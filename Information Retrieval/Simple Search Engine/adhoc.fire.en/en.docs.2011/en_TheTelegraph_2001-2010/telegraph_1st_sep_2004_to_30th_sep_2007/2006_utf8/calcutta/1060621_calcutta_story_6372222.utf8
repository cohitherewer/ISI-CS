 She was lying badly injured on the road near the Maidan after being hit by a speeding vehicle and would have died a slow and painful death. However, an anonymous phone call to the office of a voluntary organisation saved the life of two-year-old Hema.

 The pony, abandoned by its owner, was trying to cross the street when a speeding vehicle hit her, inflicting serious injuries. 

 With a big fracture in her right hind limb and injuries in other parts of the body, the pony was under treatment in Calcutta for nearly two months. Now, she has found a new home at Santiniketan.

 ?The injuries have healed and she has recovered. But with no one to look after her, it would have been difficult for Hema to survive on the Maidan,? said Shyamal Kumar Chakraborty, secretary and superintendent of Calcutta Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, the nodal agency in the state for the implementation of the Prevention of Cruelty Act.

 ?In April, someone called our office and informed us that he had spotted the pony lying injured on a road in the Maidan area. We brought her here by our ambulance,? Chakraborty recalled. According to doctors at the Society, the pony was bleeding and a little more delay could have been fatal.

 She was christened Hema by the Society staff. At the hospital, she underwent a surgery on her leg and it took her almost two months to recover.

 ?She does not have space to run. Besides, there is a risk of skidding on the concrete floor here,? an official pointed out. Releasing her on the Maidan was ruled out, as she could not survive there alone. ?The injured leg made Hema?s condition critical,? said a Society official.

 At this point, a voluntary organisation from Santiniketan came forward and offered to rehabilitate her. By the end of this month, Hema will be leaving for the rehabilitation centre of the Pugmarks Society for Conservation of Natural Heritage.

 ?Here, she is having problem in walking and also cannot run around. At Santiniketan?s animal shelter, she will have an acre of open space,? said Urmila Ganguly, secretary of Pugmarks. A temporary shelter has been built for Hema at Santiniketan.

 According to officials of the animal welfare department, such incidents of horses being hit by vehicles take place occasionally on the Maidan. ?These horses graze freely and are hit by vehicles when they try to cross the roads,? said an official.

 ?Motorists should be careful while driving through the Maidan area,? said deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Javed Shamim. ?The owners of the horses, too, should be careful and keep a watch on them.?

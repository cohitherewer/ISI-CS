 What: Baby?s Day Out with

 Where: Patchi, at Forum.

 When: May 26, 4.30 pm.

 Take a look: Be it gazing 

 at the chocolate house in the fairytale Hansel and Gretel 

 or gaping at the chocolate ads on television, the world 

 of chocolates continues to fascinate children.

 So Friday evening belonged to 12 tiny tots, aged between three and eight, making the most of their new-found role as chocolate chefs.

 The workshop kicked off with a story-telling session. Nirmala Bajoria narrated the story of three friends ? Catty the hardworking hen, Benzi the playful rabbit and Sam the gleeful rabbit. The session with a visual illustration showcasing the characters? various activities on a chart paper was an instant hit with the children.

 Then came the part everyone was waiting for ? a chocolate-making workshop with chef Shaun Kenworthy. Donning aprons and chef caps, the children were all geared up for their first lessons in whipping up chocolate delights from ?Uncle Shaun?.

 Shaun began the workshop on a yummy note, giving each little participant a chocolate chip to taste. 

 Then there was a brief introduction to chocolates ? the difference between milk chocolate and white chocolate, the ingredients, the basics of melting chocolate and more.

 Shaun allowed the apprentice chefs to try their little hands at making Chocolate Drops, Chocolate Moulds and Truffles. 

 Melted chocolate was poured in moulds to give them fun shapes like the snowman, teddy bear, hens and rabbits.

 The focus then shifted to creativity as the children learnt to decorate the chocolates with colourful wrapping foils and pack them in boxes with ribbons.

 ?It was very nice and the chocolates were very tasty,? summed up three-year-old Muskaan.

 Voiceover: ?Chocolates 

 have no geographical or religious boundaries; they are a 

 world wide favourite, especially with children. Such workshops 

 help children to enjoy and appreciate their chocolates better,? 

 smiled chef Shaun.

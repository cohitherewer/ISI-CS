 In the face of stiff competition in the marketplace, the state animal resources department has decided to give its milk booths in the city a fresh look. 

 The condition of our milk booths in Calcutta is miserable and that is one of the reasons why we are not doing well. To compete with the other dairies, which have specialised management systems and modern equipment, it has become essential for us to remodel our booths, said milk commissioner Sundar Majumdar.

 All 526 milk booths in the city will undergo remodelling. The responsibility has been assigned to the public works department (PWD). 

 The PWD engineers will inspect the booths, prepare a report and provide an estimate of the expenditure. We will start the work on the basis of the report, added the commissioner. 

 A PWD official stated: We have already inspected about 10 booths. We can provide an estimate of the cost only after a thorough survey of all the booths.

 After the entry of Metro Dairy and Mother Dairy in the market, the animal resources department was forced to hand over 54 milk booths to the agencies. The booths still under the departments control are also likely to be handed over to private parties.

 We supply only 40,000 litres of milk in the city. It is not that we cannot produce more milk, but there is no demand, observed an official of the department.

 The department is looking for sponsorship and has approached Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited for taking charge of renovating the booths. The company, however, has not responded.

 To boost prospects, the department is also planning to start sale of milk products, like butter, ghee and cheese, through the booths.

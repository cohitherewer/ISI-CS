 Bengal team for tech fair

 BISWARUP GOOPTU 

 The Bengal IT bandwagon is set to roll into Europe once again. A delegation of the state IT department will attend CeBIT, the world?s largest information, communication and technology exposition, to be held in Hannover, Germany, from March 6 to March 16, for second successive time. 

 CeBIT, the leading trade show for IT solutions, products and services, will record a footfall of almost half a million visitors, including IT specialists, technocrats and policy-makers with specific investment intentions.

 ?The distorted perception issue is gone, but people expect us to deliver on our promises now. CeBIT is the ideal platform for the state?s IT industry to display its wares and highlight their growth over the past years,? said principal secretary of the department G.D. Gautama.

 The Bengal delegation hopes to attract business for the small and medium enterprises, and will be making presentations and networking with big players, such as Siemens, SAP and Motorola.

 ?The small and medium enterprises form an intrinsic part of the industry and have played a major role in generating growth. The IT department has always felt the need to promote them, and CeBIT 2006 would be an excellent platform to showcase their products and services,? explained Gautama. 

 The delegation will also meet representatives from the Hannover, Munich and Frankfurt chambers of commerce.

 The department has organised almost 60 roadshows since mid-2002 to promote itself as a preferred IT destination. The cause received a fillip with the industry registering impressive growth in 2004-05.

 ?There has to be constant visibility to generate interest among the companies in Europe. CeBIT 2006 provides the small and medium enterprises an excellent chance to forge strategic alliances and enter joint ventures,? stated B.G. Roy, regional director, Indo-German Chamber of Commerce, and a part of the Bengal delegation for the technology event.

 Lesson plans and study materials, attendance records and exam results, tests and homework assignments, polls and forums to debate issues ? all online, for students, teachers and parents to check anytime, anywhere.

 The Cambridge School, in Hazra, is taking a leap into the future of the paperless classroom.

 Using software that has been customised to suit the needs of the school, an intranet system on the Net has been created to make life easier for the students, teachers, parents and administrators. ?This is the first time a Calcutta school is going completely online,? said principal Nonda Chatterjee.

 ?The aim is to encourage lateral and vertical communication. Parents don?t have to wait till Open Day to find out about their child?s progress, while teachers can co-ordinate better,? she added.

 The first phase of the proprietary system has been in the test stage, integrating students, teachers and the school administration through an intranet. This will be extended to parents in the second phase, starting end-June.

 ?Parents will not only be able to receive real-time information about their children, but also to compare their child?s performance with his/her peers. They can participate in their child?s education by exchanging inputs with teachers whenever they want,? explained Chatterjee.

 Students will access digital libraries where teachers will upload downloadable formats of presentations, study materials and more, submit assignments, participate in discussion forums, communicate with teachers, take tests, and do teacher appraisals.

 Teachers will use the software to plan their lessons and tests in advance, enter and access their students? performance and attendance data, and point them to Net-based resources and other references. They can also message students and parents directly. 

 The Cambridge School will have relevant academic, extracurricular and teacher-management information at its fingertips. ?We have been working on it for six months, and it has been working well,? said computer teacher Neera Dubey. ?Every parent and child will have a password, and the teachers will have separate log-in and passwords.?

 The chalk-and-talk method might not have been beaten yet, but online is the way to go. ?We already make the final exam results of our students and their placements available on our website. We have just fed the details of all our students into our computer database, so that I can access it anytime a parent has queries regarding a child,? said Anuradha Das, principal of Calcutta International School. ?Some time in the future, it will be available for parents, online? For our new school on the Bypass, a big portion of our Rs 14-crore budget has been allocated for IT.?

 That is also something on the talks table at Delhi Public School. ?We are already linked via LAN to all the DPS?s worldwide. So if a programme is happening in one school, the rest can watch it live on the computer,? explained principal Indrani Sanyal. ?We have been toying with the idea of making student progress available to parents online.?

 Student traced, two held

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Class VII student Priyanka Ghosh, who was kidnapped in Barasat on Monday afternoon while returning from school, was rescued on Tuesday. One of the abductors, Biswajit Saha, was arrested and the vehicle used in the kidnapping impounded. 

 ?The girl was traced to the house of a relative of one of the abductors ? 22-year-old Biswajit Saha of Hasnabad. We have arrested him and are on the lookout for his accomplice Deba Saha, who is absconding,? said North 24-Parganas superintendent of police Praveen Kumar.

 He added: ?It seems that the girl knew Biswajit. We have sent her for medical examination.? 

 Bimal Saha, who drove the car used to kidnap the girl, has also been held. According to the cops, police stations in the area were alerted soon after the girl was kidnapped. The owner of the car was identified within hours. 

 ?Priyanka?s mother had given us the number of the car. We passed it on to the police,? said Bishal Sarkar, one of the youths Priyanka?s mother had approached for help, minutes after the abduction.

 ?Priyanka told us that though she knew Biswajit for a year, she was never involved with him in any way. He had apparently been professing his love for her for some time but she had spurned his advances. Priyanka had even told her mother about Biswajit,? said a police officer. 

 Biswajit had allegedly planned the kidnap with friend Deba after his marriage proposal was turned down by Priyanka on Saturday. He took her to a relative?s home at Hasnabad, in North 24-Parganas, and introduced her as Deba?s relative.

 Police learnt where the girl had been kept during a raid at Biswajit?s residence on Monday night. They asked officers of Hasnabad police station to search the relative?s house for the girl. The raid was conducted early in the morning.

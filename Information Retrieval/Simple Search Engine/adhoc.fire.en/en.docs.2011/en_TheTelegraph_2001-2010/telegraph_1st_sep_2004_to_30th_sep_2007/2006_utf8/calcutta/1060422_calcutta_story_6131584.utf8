 You share your birthday with...

 Jack Nicholson You like individuals who 

 are serious, sincere and honest. You?re not confident about 

 money matters, often underestimating your own worth. Learn 

 to relax and have fun on the job. You have many admirers; 

 people appreciate your social commitment. Take a few risks, 

 luck is bound to come your way. ? Kusum Bhandari

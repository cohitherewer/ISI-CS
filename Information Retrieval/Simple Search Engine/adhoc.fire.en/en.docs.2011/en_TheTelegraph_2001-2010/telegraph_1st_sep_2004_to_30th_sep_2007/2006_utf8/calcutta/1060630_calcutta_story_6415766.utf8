The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Duo held for Net contact

 PRONAB MONDAL

 Net Romeos better not call a woman whose name appears on any pornographic website.

 Chances are the woman herself is in the dark about her name figuring on the site as soliciting clients, and any attempt to reach her may land you behind bars.

 Flooded with complaints from women and girls, the CID has issued a warning to those in the habit of surfing pornographic sites and responding to advertisements posted on them. 

 ?We have a taken a serious view of the crime. A complaint will land the offender in custody,? said an officer.

 ?The sites publish the names, addresses and even phone numbers of women,? said Rajeev Kumar, deputy inspector-general (operations). ?But in most cases, we have found the women have not been taken into confidence.?

 The CID was alerted about the crime when it received a complaint from a south Calcutta resident. The woman told officers that two youths had been calling her and making indecent proposals.

 ?They talked about a Net advertisement in which I had supposedly described myself as a girl looking for physical relationships. I told them that I had no idea about the site, but they would not listen,? she complained.

 ?We asked the woman to invite the two to a spot at the same time,? said CID deputy superintendent Neelu Sherpa Chakraborty.

 A woman officer stood on the spot that day and as the youths arrived, plainclothesmen pounced on them. Both admitted to being regular surfers of pornographic sites.

 ?The two came to know about the woman?s address from a site. The landline number was traced after logging on to the Calcutta Telephones site,? said an officer.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 India has one of the the largest railway networks in Asia 

 but the infrastructure and service are far from perfect. 

 It is quite strange that none of the reservation centres 

 in our city have a special counter for senior citizens. 

 A few days ago, I had to stand for three hours in queue 

 and fell ill while coming home. In all other cities, senior 

 citizens are given special privileges, but in Calcutta, 

 we dont even have reserved seats for senior citizens in 

 most buses. This is very sad and I request the government 

 to look into the matter.

 Very often, trees are planted near the streetlights. Gradually, 

 when these trees grow and spread their branches canopy-like, 

 they prevent the light from reaching the road. The Calcutta 

 Municipal Corporation should take care while planting trees 

 and see that they do not come in the way of the streetlight.

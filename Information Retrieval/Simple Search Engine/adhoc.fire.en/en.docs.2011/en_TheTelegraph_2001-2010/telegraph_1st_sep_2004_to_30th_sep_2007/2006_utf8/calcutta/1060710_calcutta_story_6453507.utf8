 Expressing his feelings in an uninhibited style and complete lack of self-consciousness, the paintings of Anindya Roy come across as a breath of fresh air in an environment overrun with obscure and cryptic compositions. The ongoing exhibition of his works presents images of life, love and faith that offer an insight into his liberal and gentle attitude. Combining fantasy with reality, his works give perspective to the tiny fraction of time that exists between moments of sentience and sub-consciousness. Evoked with emotion and spirit, his art is ultimately born of experience. Images of children making merry in the countryside, or of men and women at work in the fields reflect his fascination for the innocence and simplicity of rural life. Romance, adventure and excitement also figure in his works, and are clearly a result of the imaginative wanderings of his creative mind. Full of action, drama and colour, Roy?s paintings invite the viewer on an enchanting, artistic journey.

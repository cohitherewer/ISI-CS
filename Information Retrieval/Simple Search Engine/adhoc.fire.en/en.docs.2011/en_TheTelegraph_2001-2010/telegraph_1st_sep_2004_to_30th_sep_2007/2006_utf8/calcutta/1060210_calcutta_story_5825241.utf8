 If busy work schedules hardly allow you two to spend quality time at home, spending February 14 on the run must be the last thing you want. So why not stay at home and just chill? All you need is a dollop of enthusiasm to stir up romance indoors.

 For a start, deck up the interiors with some nice Valentines Day home accessories that have flooded the market in the run-up to February 14.

 From cushions and bean bags to bath accessories and kitchen knick knacks, the range is sure to bowl you over.

 Says Harjeet Singh, manager of Nik Nish: Home accessories appeal to a wider age group. We have introduced an interesting range this time and compared to last year, our V-Day sale has already gone up remarkably this month.

 Gautam Jatia, CEO of Landmark, cites the utility factor for the popularity of V-Day home goodies. These are value-additions that complete the Valentine Day gift range, he adds.

 GoodLife shop hops to check out some of the stuff on offer.

 Cuddly cushion

 Replace your old square cushions with heart-shaped ones available at almost every lifestyle store, from Pantaloons and Landmark to Archies in City Centre.

 Bright red hearts in sizes small and big are on offer almost everywhere. Some greet you with bright eyes and broad grins while others give you a warm hug with lanky limbs. A few proudly proclaim I Love You.

 At Archies, you can opt for your photographs to be inserted in pink cushions, for a personalised effect. Red and mauve bean bags are special V-Day offerings from Landmark.

 Kitchen cute

 If all that is for the living room, you can take the romantic route in the kitchen too. Archies is a treasure trove of such goodies. Get yourself butter knives with heart-shaped handles, placed inside cow-shaped holders. Small heart-shaped trays in bright red with a cute frog on top, spice jars with lids atop which sits a girl, her cheeks blushing pink hearts, are the other offerings. 

 Coffee mugs with heart-shaped handles, rims and little hearts printed all over are available at Nik Nish.

 Bath binge

 Begin your day like a true romantic. A red toothbrush holder with a frog handing out a bunch of roses is available at Archies. Check out Landmark for heart-shaped steel, cane or cloth baskets containing bath gels, shower gels, heart-shaped soaps, loofah and rose-like soap paper.

 Knick knacks

 Pen-holders, heart-shaped clocks, photo frames, ashtrays are all in sync with the love theme. Archies also has tiny, red decor dolls wearing heart-rimmed glasses. Table lamps from Nik Nish in red and pink that read love are definite showstealers. For your dressing table, it could be jewellery boxes with lids that have a teddy duo holding hearts.

 At Presto in City Centre, the range has clocks, desk accessories, photo frames and pens. Crafted in real wood, they can be made to order with customised messages.

 At Landmark and Archies, there are windchimes in splashes of red, mauve and blue, all with heart-shaped extensions. You also have teddies, tiny bunnies, monkeys and giraffes carrying hearts.

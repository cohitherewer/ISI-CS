 Spread of terror tentacles

 Todays question: Is Calcutta as vulnerable to terror attacks as Mumbai? More responses will be published next week

 Day of reckoning: A TV grab of the 

 mother of all terror attacks

 D. Chakraborty,

 Cossipore 

 Terrorism has spread its tentacles 

 all over the world and no province can escape its clutches. 

 It needs to be fought and uprooted globally. State-of-the-art 

 equipment need to be installed in sensitive zones across 

 India to thwart terrorists. The Centre and the state governments 

 should articulate their stand against terrorists. 

 Rajesh Dey, 

 Parnashree

 Terrorists aim to destabilise 

 the authorities and Mumbai is perfect for the purpose. Calcuttans 

 are more humane, vigilant and aware of destabilising factors 

 than the residents of the financial capital. A huge percentage 

 of the population in Calcutta comprises illegal immigrants 

 from Bangladesh who find it easy to mingle with the masses 

 because they of their knowledge of Bengali. There is only 

 so much that the administration can do, hence intelligence 

 agencies and the public need to be on their toes.

 B.N. Bose, 

 Dum Dum Park

 Calcutta is a city of peace, harmony 

 and tranquillity. People of all communities stay here without 

 any problems. Even, today, many harijans and dalits come 

 to Calcutta from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh due to caste war 

 in their villages. Naturally, the city is not as vulnerable 

 to terror attacks as Mumbai. The administration, however, 

 has to remain alert.

 Sourish Misra,

 Salt Lake 

 Calcutta is as vulnerable to terror 

 attacks as Mumbai. Even after the blasts in Mumbai, television 

 channels caught cops napping while on duty outside important 

 buildings in the city. Police should understand that terror 

 attacks do not occur everyday, but when they do occur, they 

 occur without warning.

 Prahlad Agarwala, 

 Majdia, Nadia 

 Given that terrorist organisations 

 with their roots across the border have spread all over 

 the country, Calcutta is as vulnerable to terror attacks 

 as any other city.

 S.N. Mitra,

 Beleghata

 There is no definition of terrorism. 

 From ancient times, there have been groups that have resorted 

 to anarchism as a reaction to social problems. There are 

 such groups in Calcutta, too. Poverty is the root cause 

 of such developments.

 Ruchita Ram,

 Kidderpore

 Not at all. Mumbai is the business 

 centre of India, while Calcutta is not able to cope up with 

 international standards in many respects. A terror attack 

 in the city will not attract as much attention as an attack 

 in Mumbai. However, Calcutta being overpopulated is just 

 the right place for the terrorists to lie low after operations. 

 A .K. Mitra,

 Puddapukur Road 

 With a rock solid government at 

 the helm, chances of terror attacks in the state are minimal. 

 Also, the public and security agencies are generally alert 

 to such possibilities. 

 S. Chakravarty, 

 Unique Park

 Yes and no. Yes because Calcutta 

 is a hideout for terrorists from all over the country, thanks 

 to the diligent vigil by local security agencies. The ineffective 

 security net is full of loopholes. However, the terror-mongers 

 know that if they set off blasts here, the security arrangement 

 will inevitably be bolstered making it more difficult for 

 them to put up in Calcutta in future.

 Anuradha Raza,

 Darga Road

 Calcutta is as vulnerable to terror 

 attacks as any other part of India. For that matter, what 

 has been done for the security of Mumbai residents commuting 

 by local trains following the deadly blasts? Terror strikes 

 can be carried out in any public place at any time, anywhere. 

 The security system is ineffective all over the country 

 and the common mans life is always at risk. The future, 

 too, does not hold out much hope.

 R.M. Paulmazumdar,

 Shyamnagar

 Calcutta has been a Mecca for 

 terrorists since the days of Raj. The city now acts as a 

 shelter for extremists from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh. 

 Unfortunately, the administration is clueless about how 

 to prevent this.

 Chittaranjan Panda

 Director,

 Victoria Memorial and acting director, Indian Museum

 Anything can happen. Anybody can destroy any of the two 

 edifices I am in charge of. We are at Gods mercy. 

 Victoria Memorial still has some kind of security mechanism 

 with eight armed guards at the gates. Indian Museum has 

 only lathi-wielding guards and some untrained personnel. 

 And there are so many strangers coming, with offices, residential 

 places and a college on the premises. All vulnerable points 

 in the city should have strong surveillance systems with 

 CCTVs and round-the-clock monitoring. There is talk of the 

 CISF taking over. I hope that happens soon.

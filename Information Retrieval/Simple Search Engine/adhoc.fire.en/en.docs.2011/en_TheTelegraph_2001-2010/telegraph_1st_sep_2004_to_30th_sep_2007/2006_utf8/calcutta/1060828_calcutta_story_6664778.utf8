 Braving the early morning rain that flooded the city, the Ballroom of the The Oberoi Grand was filled with guests, including industrialists and artists, who had come to attend an auction of art works on Sunday afternoon, whose proceeds would go towards establishing the Kolkata Museum of Modern Art (KMOMA). 

 On the spot, about a crore was collected. But this is just the beginning. The local will become global.

 This is the first joint-sector project of its kind involving the state government, the Centre, Calcutta Municipal Corporation, the corporate sector and foreign governments and their subsidiaries, like British Council and Max Mueller Bhavan.

 Chief minister Buddhadab Bhattacharjee, who is chief patron of KMOMA, began his address on a familiar note. He said it is already acknowledged that Calcutta is Indias cultural capital but it must also emerge as a city of trade and business, without which culture will not survive.

 Although Calcutta has several private galleries and the Indian Council for Cultural Relations gallery on Ho Chi Minh Sarani is near completion, it lacks a gallery of international standards. I was humiliated that international art exhibitions like the one on Picasso are held in Delhi, Mumbai and even Indore but they bypass Calcutta, he added.

 The government has not only contributed a 10-acre plot in Rajarhat which he described as an ideal place for such a museum but it will also help with the funding, as about Rs 500 crore will be required.

 He had suggested to the mayor of Calcutta, Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya, present on the occasion, that CMC become a partner in the project and he agreed.

 Ambika Soni, Union minister of culture, too, had reacted positively to his request that the Centre participate in the project. 

 Work on KMOMA will start as soon as possible. Bhattacharya said Rakhi Sarkar, managing trustee, KMOMA, has been in touch with American architects for advice.

 Making an appeal to people from all sections of society to contribute towards KMOMA, Rakhi Sarkar said the museum was conceived as a vital knowledge and resource centre, besides being a museum of the visual arts, which will have special spaces for multidisciplinary exchange and discourse. 

 Art works from the late 18th century up to our times will be exhibited at the museum, which will have units on the art of the nation, Far East, West and Middle East.

 It will be a modular structure and will be built in parts according to the flow of funds, and should be functioning in three to three-and-a-half years. 

 It will tie up with the most renowned international institutions like Harvard and Goldsmiths College of London to organise technical studies in subjects such as restoration. This is expected to begin by the middle of next year. 

 International art will be brought to your doorstep, said Sarkar.

 In keeping with international practice, the museum will house stores where the best of crafts will be on offer, and restaurants where Bengali cuisine can be savoured.

 Sarkar, industrialist B.M. Khaitan, chairman, KMOMA, and Ranjit Pandit, chairman McKinsey India, which prepared the feasibility report and structural module free, stressed that the museum with a built-up area of half-a-million sq ft will be a benchmark of Asia. Pandit said next year, Sothebys will conduct an auction of the works of 100 Indian artists in New York, to be followed by another in India in 2008. KMOMA will have close links with international and national museums.

 Twenty works of 18 artists, including Paritosh Sen, Jogen Chowdhury and Ganesh Pyne went under the hammer. A tiny Banalata Sen by Pyne went for Rs 13.5 lakh. The two paintings of Jogen Chowdhury went for Rs 20 lakh and Rs 19 lakh each. Derek OBrien conducted the auction.

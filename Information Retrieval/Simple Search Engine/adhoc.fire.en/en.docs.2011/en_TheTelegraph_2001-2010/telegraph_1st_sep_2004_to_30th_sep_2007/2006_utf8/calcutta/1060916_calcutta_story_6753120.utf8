The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Talent to tap

 STAGE ON amp; OFF

 In 

 an effort to unearth fresh talent, Artistes Forum organised 

 a daylong drama festival at Madhusudan Mancha last Sunday 

 where a bunch of aspiring actors had a brush with some big 

 names of Tollywood.

 Udayer Pathe, the festival, was 

 a platform for new actors to showcase their skills and 

 also meet some directors who might tap their talent, said 

 Debdut Ghosh, joint secretary, Artistes Forum.

 A group of 40 was shortlisted 

 from 100 applicants who staged six one-act plays, directed 

 by familiar TV faces like Kanchan, Rudranil Ghosh and Sudeshna 

 Roy, among others.

 The curtains went up with Gadhabajaar, 

 an Egyptian folk tale adapted in Bengali with live music. 

 A gamut of emotions love, anguish, confusion and joy 

 formed the main facets of the other five plays Car Credit 

 Card, Kirokom Kirokom Hobey, Gopon Satya, Juto and Notun 

 Juger Bhorey.

 In the judges corner were TV 

 actors Anasuya Mazumdar, Dwijen Bandopadhyay and Dhiman 

 Chakraborty, while cheering the hopefuls from the gallery 

 were actors Kushal Chakraborty, Santu Mukherjee, Rimjhim 

 Mitra, Shantilal Mukherjee and Biplab Chatterjee. The participants 

 later mingled with Rituparno Ghosh, Probhat Roy, Kaushik 

 Ganguly, Partha Sen, Abhijit Dasgupta and Anindya Sarkar.

 Ive been doing bit roles in 

 soaps and serials so far. This festival gave me the chance 

 to meet some directors and actors who might be interested 

 in giving me better roles, smiled Madhumita Sengupta, a 

 participant.

 Life amp; death

 Taking the Rabindra Sadan stage 

 on September 20 evening will be Mrityu Ishwar Jaunota, 

 penned by Bratya Basu and presented by Srijok. Philosophic 

 and psychological explorations are okay as texts but to 

 present that on stage in the form of a 1-hour-40-minute 

 play seemed something very difficult. That is what got me 

 back to theatre, said TV actor Pijush Ganguly who plays 

 one of the leads. Love, death and god, the three greatest 

 human experiences have been the subject of a lot of speculation... 

 I believe if we succeed in communicating Bratyas vision, 

 this will be a landmark play, added stage veteran Gautam 

 Sadhukhan who plays the Sutradhar.

 At a special preview, director 

 Debashish Basu told Metro: This is a play without conflict 

 and climax. Philosophical and emotional experiences form 

 the substance of the play with small flashbacks and narration.

 The poetic play progresses through 

 three basic movements of morning, evening and night that 

 Bratya associates with love, god and death, respectively. 

 But just as these get inverted in the title, one realises 

 that the play disregards the conventional depictions of 

 time.

 So, a seven-year-old can instinctively 

 sense the presence of god, a middle-aged man can long for 

 that ultimate friend Ishwarbabu, and a prostitute 

 can accept death as a natural order. Raktim Dutta tells 

 the story of Shokal, Pijush Ganguly plays the protagonist 

 of Bikel, while Ratri (Ashesh Sengupta) links all three 

 sections. All three are social misfits.

 The sets are by Dipendra Pal and 

 the lights by Sudip Sanyal. The background score is by Satrajit 

 Sarkar and Raja Mukherjee.

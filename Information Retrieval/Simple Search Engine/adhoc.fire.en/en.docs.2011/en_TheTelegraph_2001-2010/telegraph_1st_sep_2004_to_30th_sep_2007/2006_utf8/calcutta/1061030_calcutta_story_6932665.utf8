 Builders groups in show of strength

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 A clash between two groups, engaged in supplying building material, left two bystanders injured in Bhowanipore on Saturday night.

 Of the two, Bina Bhowmik, a resident of Kundu Lane in the neighbourhood, had to be admitted to hospital.

 One of the gangs was allegedly led by Vicky Shaw, whose father is a retired policeman and who still lives in the Calcutta Police Hospital staff quarters, in Bhowanipore.

 Demanding immediate arrest of the culprits, local residents blocked the crossing of Debendra Ghosh Street and Harish Mukherjee Road for more than an hour on Sunday afternoon. Traffic was disrupted in parts of south Calcutta.

 It seems some of the accused have fled. Our men are looking for them and we hope to round them up soon, said Ajay Kumar, deputy commissioner of police (south).

 Recalling the events on Saturday night, police said Vicky and his gang clashed with Shyam Mullick and his associates on Harish Mukherjee Road around 11.45 pm.

 Vicky allegedly damaged the motorcycle of Rintu Das, a member of Shyams gang. Armed with iron rods and crude bombs, Shyams aides then attacked Vickys men.

 Once they reached Kansaripara, the youths smashed the glass panes of a few cars parked there. Some hurled bombs at pedestrians. The splinters hit Bina and the injured man, said a police officer.

 The cops raided the Police Hospital staff quarters on Sunday in search of Vicky, but he was not found. Shyam and Rintu, too, are absconding.

 Skeletal remains of youth

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Almost eight days after he went missing, police on Sunday stumbled upon the skeletal remains of 18-year-old Sabir Ali, alias Banka, in a bush in the backyard of a godown at Santoshpur, on the southern fringes of the city. 

 On July 22, Banka had left his Rabindra Nagar home around 11 am, saying he would be back soon. That was the last his father Sankar Ali saw of Banka, the youngest of his six sons. 

 ?The body lay in a bush in an isolated corner behind a godown, a few feet from the railway tracks. Family members identified him by his slippers and remains of his singlet,? said a senior officer of Taratala police station.

 Soon after, the body was sent for an ossification test and a case of unnatural death was registered with the police.

 Born into a large family surviving on his father?s small business, Sabir would at times go to work in a local factory. Otherwise, he spent most of his time with friends. On July 22, when Sabir stepped out of his house, everybody thought he was going for a stroll.

 ?Late on Saturday, a neighbour working at the tea godown near Santoshpur rail crossing learnt of a body lying in a bush behind the godown. He informed Rabindra Nagar police. We have not checked if the teenager has any criminal records. But this is too early to comment,? said an officer of Taratala police station.

 Smooth The Interior Shoppe on VIP Road. Picture by Sanat Kumar Sinha 

 Paint your room the colour of jeans, style your childs bedroom with combination furniture against wall texture that glows in the dark, flaunt a Swarovski chandelier in your living room. And you can find them all from under one roof, with some interior consultation thrown in, on the house.

 With 60-feet frontage and orange neon banner, you cant miss the brand new shopping mall on VIP Road. Smooth The Interior Shoppe at Yamunotri Apartment, Panchwati Complex, VIP Road (opposite Haldirams), raised its shutters on December 26.

 Expanding from its parent company Smooth Malaysia, Smooth Indias motto is smooth style smooth life.

 Spread across 10,000 sq ft, the store offers imported household, office, wrought iron and childrens furniture from different brands.

 Thats not all. What sets Smooth apart from other lifestyle furniture stores are interior solutions. Bathroom fittings and flooring, modular kitchen and hardware fittings, light fittings and electrical fittings complete the package. 

 Valpaint from Italy has special wall textures of different shades or magic colours that glow in the dark. Combination furniture like glass, steel or leather with wood and tables with marble and tempered mould glass lend style to variety.

 We provide personalisation to our customers, if they opt for different sizes or shades. A library for books, journals and architectural references will also be introduced to provide a space for creative talent in this field, says Rajvardhan Dewra, director, Smooth India.

 A special Kanyadaan package in wrought iron comes for Rs 10,500 comprising a wardrobe, bed, two side tables and mirror.

 The master bedroom package is priced at Rs 37,500 and offers a bed, four-door wardrobe, two side-tables, a dressing table and stool. Modular kitchens start from Rs 37,500 and office furniture starts from Rs 8,000.

 We plan to build 20 Smooth showrooms over 300,000 sq ft in India by 2008, reveals Dewra.

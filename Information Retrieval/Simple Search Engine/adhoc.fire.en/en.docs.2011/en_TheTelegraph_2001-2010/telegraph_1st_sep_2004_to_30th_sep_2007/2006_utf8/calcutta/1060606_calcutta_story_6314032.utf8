 Salute to Nature?s bounty

 More than 7,000 children (mostly underprivileged and differently abled) participated in the three-day Environment Day celebrations at Birla Industrial and Technological Museum (BITM), from June 3 to June 5.

 With support from the state pollution control board, BITM presented a number of events on how to conserve Nature. Film shows, puppet shows and one-act plays on conserving water were presented by children living in slums and also those with speech and hearing problems.

 An open-house quiz and a spot-painting competition were also organised.

 ?There is an international policy to seek out new audiences among the underprivileged and physically challenged. Museums are tailoring their programmes for this purpose. For the past two years, BITM has been running inclusive programmes to reach a wider section of society,? said director Jayanta Sthanapati, who will read a paper on the subject at ECSITE Conference 2006 in Belgium.

 As many as 19 schools and NGOs took part in the event.

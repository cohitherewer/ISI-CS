The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Tourists flock to fly out

 SANJAY MANDAL

 City-based lawyer A. Haque had planned to spend Puja in the city. But the lure of a holiday abroad proved too tough to resist. A hectic hunt for tickets later, he is set to fly off to Phuket on Thai Airways on Friday. So are many others.

 With most flights to popular domestic and international tourist destinations full, Calcutta airport is witnessing an unprecedented increase in footfall. Low fares in the domestic sector and increased flight frequency have contributed to this hike in passenger count.

 The number of passengers has increased sharply this season, compared with the past few years. There is an abnormal rush, a senior official at Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport told Metro on Thursday.

 The international and domestic terminals saw long queues of passengers. There was a shortage of chairs and passengers were seen standing in the lounge. There are not enough trolleys. We had to carry the baggage ourselves, complained Lakshmi Khanna, on his way to Delhi.

 Coup notwithstanding, Thailand has held on as the most popular tourist destination abroad for Calcuttans. The heaviest traffic is for Bangkok this weekend. Tourists have got over the initial fears about the coup, said Travel Agents Federation of India chairman (east) Anil Punjabi. According to Thai Airways general manager (Calcutta) Krisnapong Srisinwarakool, Wednesday nights flight to Bangkok was full. Tomorrows flight is also full, he added. The airlines flights to Malaysia, China and Hong Kong have registered a hike in passengers.

 The weekend flights of Singapore Airlines from the city are booked to capacity. Many passengers will proceed to Kuala Lumpur, Bali and Australia. Emirates, which launched a non-stop service between Calcutta and Dubai this year, is also flying more passengers than usual to Dubai and Mauritius. 

 In the domestic sector, the low-cost carriers have fared the best. Rajasthan and the Northeast are the top draws.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You share your birthday with...

 Elizabeth Hurley

 You perform above and beyond the call of duty. You are not career-minded; you work to look after your daily needs. You dislike repetition. Your enthusiasm is infectious. You are quick to defend or overprotect what you feel is right. You are conservative by nature, and have problems letting down your barriers. You yearn for intimacy, honesty and acceptance. ? Kusum Bhandari

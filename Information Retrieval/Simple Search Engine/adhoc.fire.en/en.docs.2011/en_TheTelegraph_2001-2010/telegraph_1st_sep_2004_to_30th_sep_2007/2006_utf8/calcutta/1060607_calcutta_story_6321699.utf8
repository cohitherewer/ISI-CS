 Cell to mall, it?s soccer fever time

 SUBHAJIT BANERJEE

 From the tiniest mobile phone screen to giant moving displays, from the comfort of the living room to the crowded cheer of the shopping mall, options aplenty beckon the Calcutta football fanatic keen to catch World Cup 2006.

 Kicking off activities on the mobile space is Heyya. The ABP mobile brand, in association with BSNL, is offering minute-by-minute updates of live matches, trivia, scores, schedules and more. 

 Send an SMS to 8243 during or 

 after a match for the live score and other details. And 

 if you want all the action all the time, join the special 

 Football World Cup Club .

 Cellular service provider Airtel has lined up a host of Cup specials for its users. Airtel is providing ?mobisodes? ? mobile episodes through preview clips, analysis and prediction ? for every match, along with news reports from ESPN?s SportsCenter.

 An Airtel mobile van beaming action from Germany on a giant screen would do the rounds of 101 paras and some residential estates in the city during the Cup days.

 From the mobile to the TV screen, official broadcaster ESPN STAR Sports is tying up with pubs and lounge bars like Underground and Venom for screenings. The Cup frenzy will also be screened at the City Centre food court and clubs such as Tolly, RCGC, Saturday and Bengal.

 With the ?greatest football tournament on earth? two days away, the rush to buy a TV set is also reaching a peak.

 ?Sales have doubled. People are going for 26-inch or 32-inch LCDs, and 42-inch plasmas,? said Manoj Bhatia of Promises Instruments. 

 The price pinch: Rs 60,000 to Rs 1.15 lakh.

 The Internet-savvy among the football fans can log on to the official World Cup site, www.fifaworldcup.com, for a taste of things to come. 

 Clips of the best action from each game will be available on the site soon after the final whistle.

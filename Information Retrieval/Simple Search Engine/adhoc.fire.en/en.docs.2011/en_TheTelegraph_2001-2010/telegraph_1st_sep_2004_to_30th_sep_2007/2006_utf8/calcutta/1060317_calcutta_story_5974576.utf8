 Owners gun for sale bar

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The day after Calcutta High Court dismissed a government notification against plying of commercial vehicles older than 15 years, bus operators on Thursday demanded withdrawal of another order that prevents sale and purchase of old vehicles.

 The transport department, in a July 2005 notification, had stopped the sale and purchase of old commercial vehicles. As per the order, the owners can only replace them with new vehicles. It also prohibits the transfer of old vehicles.

 ?We want the government to allow us to replace old buses and minibuses with newer second-hand models. If the government permits that, a significant percentage of vehicles older than 15 years will automatically be scrapped,?? said Bengal Bus Syndicate president Swarnakamal Saha.

 On Wednesday, the high court had ruled that the government did not have the power to scrap any vehicle on the basis of age. The verdict directed the transport department to renew permits of old commercial vehicles, which will, however, have to comply with the tailpipe emission standards. 

 Bengal Bus Syndicate, the largest body of passenger transport operators in the city, held a meeting on Thursday to discuss its course of action in the light of the judgment. It has decided to submit a proposal to the government.

 The proposal calls for permission to replace old vehicles with newer models, even second-hand ones. The bus operators reasoned that vehicle-owners who cannot afford to buy new models would be willing to buy second-hand ones.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

On offer, army jobs

 IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI

 Wanted: More Bengalis for the army.

 Worried over the low representation of Bengalis in its ranks, the army has come out with a string of campaigns to woo city youths to don the uniform.

 The number of Bengalis in the army has touched an all-time low, from nine per cent of the total strength just after World War II to a mere four per cent now. 

 ?To arrest the decline, we have launched aggressive awareness campaigns. Bengalis are just not aware of the several lucrative job opportunities that the force offers,? Wing Commander R.K. Das, chief public relations officer (CPRO) in the defence ministry told Metro.

 ?Bengalis do not want to join the army for fear of going to battle. For them, a job in the armed forces means fighting battles. This mindset prompts parents to discourage their children from joining the army,? said a senior officer at Fort William, headquarters of the Eastern Command.

 The ?basic idea? of the campaign, he pointed out, is to make people aware that even if a war breaks out, all armymen need not go to the front. ?You can also serve the force as engineers, IT professionals, teachers, doctors or technicians. I believe with their knowledge and skills, Bengalis will do a far better job in these fields than people from other states.?

 The state government has lent a helping hand to the army in the campaigns, which include organising rallies and fairs, motivating students in schools and colleges and launching a publicity blitz in the media.

 ?We had approached the state government and they agreed to help us. Following a nod from the education department, we have visited several schools and colleges in the city. Besides, we have set up stalls at Swabhumi highlighting the various job avenues in the army. The response so far has been encouraging,? CPRO Das added.

 The army has also launched a recruitment drive. ?The camps were held in Salt Lake and Barrackpore a fortnight ago and we were surprised at the response. More such camps will be organised in the city and the districts,? the official added.

 ?In the 60s, there were a large number of Bengali officers and a couple of them even rose to the rank of general. Compared to other states like Punjab, Haryana, Bihar and Maharashtra, Bengali representation is much less now and is declining further. The army is the second biggest organisation in the country after the railways, and the Bengalis should not give it a miss,? another officer said.

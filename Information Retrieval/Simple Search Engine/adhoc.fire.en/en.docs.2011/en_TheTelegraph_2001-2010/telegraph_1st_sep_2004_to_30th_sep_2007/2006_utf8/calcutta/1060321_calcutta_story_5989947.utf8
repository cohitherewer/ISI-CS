 What: The 

 Telegraph Merchants Cup Cricket Night.

 Where: CC amp;FC.

 When: March 18, 7 pm onwards. 

 E-zone: The entertainment line-up for the evening was impressive, with never a dull moment. The evening kicked off with a fancy dress competition for children under 13.

 Judged by Ash Kapoor, Prochi Mehta and Anindita Bose, the winners of the colourful competition were Anjali Mandapaka who came as a carnival girl, Riyan Vatcha who dressed as Fred Flintstone, Raizan Vatcha who was Zorro and Sanjana Ray who aped Nikki Bakshi from Neal Nikki. Also noticed were some other cute contestants: the cricketer, the cowgirl, the commando girl.

 Next in line was a parade, carnival-style. Present on the club lawns were all the quintessential elements of a Mardi Gras. Lots of club kids along with professionals came up to bring the gala alive. Led by tennis player Danielle Jones, flying the CC amp;FC flag high, kids in sporty gear and with related props took to the decorated floats. Balloons, hats, beads and streamers added to the fun.

 Mingling with the kids were fire-eaters, acrobats, jugglers and clowns. A live band, a Mickey Mouse and a Donald Duck also accompanied the parade.

 Fireworks lit up the sky and led the evening to the dance floor. Stints by three bands, one after another, kept the night young and the crowd going. Latino music by Orient Express, perennial favourites by The Jazz Band and Bangla beats by Insomnia had the revellers rocking. The night also saw the return of Clive Hughes, noted jazz musician, on stage after almost 10 years. 

 Sip n bite: A 

 counter by Astor served delicacies like Hara Bhara Kebab, 

 Dahi ke Kebab and Fish Tikka; China Bistro cooked up favourites 

 like Devils Chicken, Pan-fried Fish and Chicken Lollipop. 

 The club counter served rolls, cheese balls and chicken 

 nuggets and a vegetarian counter by Gupta Brothers offered 

 chaats, south Indian snacks and mithai. 

 A separate shamiana served an elaborate dinner spread by Trincas. Popular picks like Mutton Tawa, Fish Amritsari, Mushroom and Green Peas found a place on the table.

 The well-stocked bar kept spirits happy and high, just what the club needed after a hard month of cricket and competition.

 The winners: The prize distribution after 135 keenly contested matches drew the loudest cheers and the biggest fanfare. VCK Forex took home the Main Plate Winners and ITC was the Main Plate Runners Up.

 Judajit Mukherjee from TCS was declared the Best Batsman and Noomi Mehta from Selvel won the Best Bowler trophy. Best Fielder went to Ganesh Dutta from VCK Forex. Sayantan Banerjee from HSBC was declared the Best All-Rounder.

 Voiceover: The entertainment factor just cant get bigger than this. Be it the fancy dress, live bands or the grand parade ? there is something for everyone, smiled Deepankar Nandi, CEO and managing member of CC amp;FC.

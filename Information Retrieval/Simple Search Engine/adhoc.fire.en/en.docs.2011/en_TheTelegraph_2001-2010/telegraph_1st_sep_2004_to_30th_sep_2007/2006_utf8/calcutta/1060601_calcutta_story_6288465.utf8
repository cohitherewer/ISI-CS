 Autonomy cloud on registration 

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 With only days to go before the start of the new session of undergraduate courses, there is no clear directive on who would register students taking admission to St Xavier?s College, which is set to start functioning as an autonomous institution.

 ?We still have not received any instruction from the University Grants Commission (UGC) regarding registration of St Xavier?s students,? said Suranjan Das, pro vice-chancellor of Calcutta University (CU).

 Till last year, like other affiliated colleges, St Xavier?s, too, would register its students with the university.

 College principal Father P.C. Mathew said: ?We are awaiting a clarification from the UGC. As soon it comes, we will settle the matter with the CU authorities.?

 The results of the 2006 Higher Secondary exams are scheduled to be announced by June 10, and the new academic session of undergraduate courses will start soon after.

 Students who will take admission to B.A, B.Sc or B.Com courses at St Xavier?s this year will be the first batch after the college has been declared an autonomous institution. They will be taught the curriculum framed by the college itself.

 ?All the formalities are complete and St Xavier?s, which has earned the distinction of being the state?s first autonomous college, is ready to admit students to undergraduate courses under the new system,? Das said.

 But the university authorities admitted they were yet to receive a ?clear directive? from the UGC regarding registration of the students.

 Das said the directive is necessary because though the college will be following its own curriculum, the university will continue awarding degrees. 

 And according to the existing regulations, students will have to registered with the body that awards degrees.

 From whatever the university has heard from the UGC, it is clear that St Xavier?s students will be registered under a special category. ?We will finalise the procedure as soon as we receive the necessary instructions from the UGC,? the official added.

 Sources in the university?s examination department said that going by the rules, registration of students who are admitted to the first-year undergraduate courses in colleges affiliated with the university should be completed within three months of admission.

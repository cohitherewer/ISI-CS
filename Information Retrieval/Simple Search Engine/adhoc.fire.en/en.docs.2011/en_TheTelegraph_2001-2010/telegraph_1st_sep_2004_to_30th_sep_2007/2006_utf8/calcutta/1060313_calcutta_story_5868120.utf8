Life

 An aura of simple style

 SHRADHA AGARWAL

 A sense of space, a whole lot of cream expanse arrestingly disturbed by two scarlet leather couches and one bright red wall with some easy stands to display an exotic style story.

 Welcome to Aara, the six-month-old fashion destination at 54, Chowringhee, a store that promises to take the citys style saga forward with its fashionable sensibilities and more.

 I dont want Aara to just be a run-of-the-mill store where one is obliged to buy something. Im happy with people dropping by for a coffee, relaxing and simply looking around ? all without any sales pressure, smiles Anusri Pramanik, the lady behind Aara, opposite Rotary Sadan. 

 Sense of space

 The ambience in Aara is very relaxed and cool. Not too many collections of object dart lying around, not too much of a clutter ? instead, two huge red leather couches form the focal point in this lifestyle zone along with some space-saving racks that are rearranged every now and then. 

 Vitrified beige tiles give an added dimension to the floor and interesting runners around the parameter catch the eye at a closer look. Swatches of fabrics and leftover printed pieces form these runners. Some are also framed on the walls. 

 Three interesting sketches add further detail to the store as do the silk roses and dried flowers. The sheer organza drapes in off-white lend a lovely dreamy feel. 

 I didnt want a very showy place where people feel that they are also spending for the ambience. They are only paying for the goods and that should definitely come across in the interiors, clarifies Ansuri. 

 Pretty prints

 Available in Aara is a wide array of designs ? liners and florals, played around on an extended colour palette ? and as Anusri puts it: There is something for everyone. Though they specialise in exotic prints, the beauty of the garments lies in their fuss-free low-maintenance.

 The quality is fine and as long as the outfit isnt extremely embellished, theres no need to run to the dry-cleaners, smiles Anusri. 

 The fabrics used are mostly crepes and georgettes and a generous amount of cottons and muls is also added to the summer stocks.

 This print-house boasts techniques such as acid printing, discharge, pigment printing for organzas, mud printing batiks, shibori and more. Though we prefer prints, ornamenting some outfits with glitter or a pearl-like finishing lustre looks good too, adds Ansusri. 

 Aara houses salwar suits, saris, tops, skirts and scarves. The range of cotton salwar kameez is priced at Rs 1,500-plus while the heavier, double-lined ensembles are tagged around Rs 3,800. 

 so available is a line of mens shirts, printed by Ansuri and stitched by Shiraz Ali of Barkat Ali. These funky designs for men are priced at Rs 1,500.

 The exquisite scarves and stoles, some of which are hand-painted, come for Rs 700 and Ansuri assures that nothing in her store costs more than Rs 5,000.

 Just like that

 Recount the number of times you wished that your designer ensemble could be transformed into something brand new and fresh, ready to be flaunted once again at the society dos. 

 Well, heres some good news: Aara is also open to taking back its creations and reprinting them, readying for you new-look outfits. 

 Yes, if youre tired of wearing your printed georgettes and crepes, we are more than willing to work on them again, changing the texture and printing them again. Our fabric boasts high quality and our ozone-friendly dyes work as added insurance, smiles Anusri.

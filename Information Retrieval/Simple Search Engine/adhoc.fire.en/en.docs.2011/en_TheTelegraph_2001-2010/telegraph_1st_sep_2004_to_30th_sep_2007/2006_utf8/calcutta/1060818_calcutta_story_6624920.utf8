The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Return to Shantiniketan

 Back home: Tulsi 

 Bees saal baad, she is 

 back to Shantiniketan. The 20 years of vanwas is 

 over and the most loved icon on the small screen, Smriti 

 Iranis Tulsi Virani, can return home. 

 Thanks to the shrewd and scheming Meera, Tulsi not only lost her home, but her most prized possession, her family. However, she is now back where she belongs and is ready to fight out the evil Meera. Having discovered the truth about his wifes innocence, even Mihir now wants Tulsi back in Shantiniketan. But being the righteous woman she is, Tulsi refuses to come back. But fate, Balajis favourite character, has its own ways. 

 With Baa falling ill and wishing 

 for Tulsis return, Indian televisions most-loved bahu 

 has to return to Shantiniketan. Once back, Tulsi realises 

 that in her absence, the very house she nurtured has lost 

 all the values she taught everyone. Now, will she be able 

 to turn things around again? Watch Kyunkii Saas Bhi Kabhi 

 Bahu Thi, Monday to Friday at 10.30 pm on STAR Plus.

 Rock n 

 roll: Hiten Tejwani and Gauri Pradhan

 Dance dance 

 Get ready for the newest Dwitiya 

 on the block Nach Baliye 2. The much-awaited second 

 season of the hugely popular celebrity dance show hits TV 

 screens this September. The STAR One show, which saw Sachin 

 and Supriya Pilgaonkar crowned champions last time, returns 

 with a brand new line-up of real-life celebrity jodis. 

 While the format remains the same, there will be a special Wild Card round. The 10 couples chosen for Nach Baliye 2 include Narayani Shastri and Gaurav Chopraa, Gauri and Yash Tonk, Shweta Kawaatra and Manav Gohil, Shweta Tiwari and Raja, Ketaki and Rasik Dave, Gurdip Kohli and Arjun J Punjj, Gauri Pradhan and Hiten Tejwani, Tina and Hussain Kuwajerwala, Keerti Gaekwad and Sharad Kelkar, and Tanaaz Lal and Bakhtyaar Irani.

 There will be a change in the judges line-up too. While Saroj Khan and Malaika Arora Khan will return from the first season, Fanaa director Kunal Kohli will replace Farhan Akhtar, who would be busy with the post-production of Don.

 Announcing the launch of Nach 

 Baliye 2, Sameer Nair, CEO of STAR India, said: We 

 had an idea and turned it into a reality and our audiences 

 made it an outright success. And now Nach Baliye 

 returns with the promises to deliver the same magic, if 

 not more.

 In style: Pierce Brosnan

 On the Bond beat

 He may no longer have the martini 

 shaken but Pierce Brosnan still stirs minds across the globe. 

 This Sunday you can catch the most popular James Bond at 

 the box-office on the small screen in an exciting episode 

 of Inside the Actors Studio. 

 Born in Ireland, Brosnan, the original Remington Steele, moved to England at an early age. Which explains his ability to play men from both backgrounds convincingly. But while the world still loves him as Bond, Brosnan says on the show: There was only one Bond for me Sean Connery.

 Theres more trivia. The scar Brosnan has on the right side above his top lip is because he was hit by a stuntman on the making of Tomorrow Never Dies. Also, Brosnan got three BMW cars along with his pay cheques for his work in Goldeneye, Tomorrow Never Dies and The World Is Not Enough. Catch the man on Sonys English movie channel PIX, this Sunday at 7 pm.

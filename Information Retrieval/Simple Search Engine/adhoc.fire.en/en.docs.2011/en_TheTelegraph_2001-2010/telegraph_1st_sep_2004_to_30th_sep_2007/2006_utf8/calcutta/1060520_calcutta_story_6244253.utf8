 Based on a story by Mahasweta Devi, Mukti, a touching tale of freedom from bondage, is Rangakarmee?s first Bengali production. It narrates the story of its eponymous protagonist Mukti, an old woman, widowed early in life. She spends the better part of her life working, for all practical purposes, as a maid in the houses of her affluent relatives, her exploitation barely veiled under the pretence of kinship. Late in life, she develops an endearing relationship with a young daughter of one of the families she works for. This girl, aware of the tragic circumstances of Mukti?s life, encourages her to fight for her rights and takes a stand for her. Mukti, too, summons the strength to assert her own independence. A chance meeting with a man who had once been in love with her, but is now lonely like herself, helps her decide to shed the humility of her present state of existence. She finally resolves to claim her life?s savings and break free. Design and direction: Usha Ganguli.

 Parking plaza in Thursday trial run

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 The hi-tech, underground parking plaza on Lindsay Street is set for a trial run from Thursday, ahead of a formal commissioning on June 30. The joint-venture project is three years behind schedule.

 A team of experts from EWW Technesche b.v., Holland, led by its director J. Visser, is in the city to oversee the trial run. 

 ?Of the five lifts on the surface of the road, one will be operated on a trial basis for about a week before the first phase of the parking lot is commissioned on June 30,? said deputy general manager of Simplex Projects Goutam Dasgupta. The company is Calcutta Municipal Corporation?s (CMC) partner in the project. 

 According to regional manager of Simplex Arup Chaudhury, 281 cars can be parked in the plaza. During the trial run and in the first phase of the project, parking facility will be available for 50 cars.

 At a computerised parking plaza, the motorist leaves his vehicle on a lift that takes it to the floor where space is available. A mechanical carrier then picks up the vehicle and assigns it to the slot.

 The lift that will be put on trial is on the JL Nehru Road side of Lindsay Street. The rest of the project, including a commercial complex and a pedestrian plaza, will be commissioned before Puja 2006. It will cost about Rs 33 crore to complete the project.

 Simplex Projects will run the parking plaza for 20 years, before handing it over to the CMC. During the period, the company will share five per cent of the gross revenue with the civic body.

 There is a plan to beautify the Lindsay Street area by planting trees and setting up fountains and telephone booths. Fearing loss of business, a section of New Market traders has demonstrated against the construction of the commercial complex and the pedestrian plaza. Last Friday, they attacked the Dutch engineers while they were working underground, forcing the municipal commissioner to seek police protection.

 ?Traders cannot dictate terms on the city?s development. If they do not cooperate, we will have to take harsh steps against them,? mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya said on Sunday, on return from a week?s tour of Canada.

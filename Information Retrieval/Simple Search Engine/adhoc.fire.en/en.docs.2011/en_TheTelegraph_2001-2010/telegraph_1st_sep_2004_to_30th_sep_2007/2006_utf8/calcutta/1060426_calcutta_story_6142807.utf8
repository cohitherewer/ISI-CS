 What:

 Where: 9 Jagmohan Mullick 

 Lane, Kalakar Street (near Satyanarayan A/C Market).

 When: April 23.

 Take a look: This is the ninth showroom of its kind in the city. 

 The launch on Sunday was marked by a fashion show. Models Jessica, Tina, Pamela, Neeraj and Abhay displayed the Wall Street Nebula, Raga (9-5), Fastrack and Bandhan collections from the house of Titan.

 The show was divided into four sequences. Models dressed in city-based designer Tejas Gandhis outfits showcased casual, formal and bridal wrist watches.

 In the first sequence models in casual denims and tees sported funky timers and cool Fastrack shades. With broad straps, cool dials and bright colours the collection was young and sporty. 

 The formal sequence had blazers, smart skirts and well-fitted trousers co-ordinated with watches simple and sleek. 

 Among bands, toned-down shades of blue, brown and black ruled. 

 Two consecutive bridal sequences followed. While the ladies were draped in pretty saris and lehengas, the men stuck to suits. 

 The watches in this section were a fine mesh of conventional and contemporary tastes.

 Fine finish peppered with minute ornamentation made the watches real show-stealers. A gold and silver finish accentuated the look. Some with leather bands were trendy, too.

 Pocket pinch: Prices start from 500.

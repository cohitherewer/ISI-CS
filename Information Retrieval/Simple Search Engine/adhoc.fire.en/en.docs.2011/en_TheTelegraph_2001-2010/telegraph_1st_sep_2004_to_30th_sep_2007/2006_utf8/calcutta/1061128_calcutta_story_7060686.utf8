He is my hero!

Screen On amp; Off

 Much has been written about Amitabh Bachchan, but much remains to be written. This is proved by Susmita Dasguptas sociological study of his film roles, published by Penguin as Amitabh: The Making of a Superstar.

 The paperback is actually a revised version of Susmitas PhD thesis at JNU titled Sociology of Hindi Commercial Cinema: A Study of Amitabh Bachchan. Despite being a research work, it is an interesting and racy read devoid of academic jargon.

 For this, I must thank my publishers. It took three exhausting years to rewrite my thesis into a popular non-fiction, in a chatty style without cutting off the complexity, she says. Apart from selling 3,000 copies in four months, the book is now also in the prescribed reading list of SOASS, London.

 Susmita engages in a dispassionate academic study of Amitabhs works from the perspective of a very central fan, not an outsider engaging in a discourse on popular culture in subaltern studies. She is the protagonist who has grown up watching him, and his audience, internalising his roles and the portrayal of them, laughed, revelled and cried at his success and failure, even spent considerable time at his house (over a week at Prateeksha, all expenses paid!) and finally sat down to deconstruct it all.

 Remember in Shubha Mahurat, Rakhee tells Sharmila, Dont forget, Im your fan, I know you more than anyone else? Its just the same for me and Amitabhs other fans. We know him so well that each and every of his foibles are caught in our eyes, says the author.

 The book is chronologically structured with Amitabhs early Hrishikesh movies to his Zanjeer, Deewar, Sholay and Don days to Laawaris, Silsila, Sharaabi and the rest, and finally, his comeback films. The writer studies the popular psyche shaped by the political and socio-economic conditions of the 70s to find out how everything from the Emergency to the green revolution shaped the Vijays, Jais and Anthonys. Susmita finds a lot of Indira Gandhi in Amitabh. Just as she is authoritarian and autocratic, so is Amitabh who frequently assumes the roles of the lawmaker, the lawbreaker, the executor as well as the appellant.

 From that angry young rebel, today Big B is content playing the eminent but ineffectual patriarch, and this is what has left Susmita and her compatriots disappointed. She also dwells on Bofors, on ABCL and on the commercials. In all this, she finds her hero fallen. Amitabh has consciously walked away from the anti-hero of the 70s to be a survivor of the 90s and it is this that his fans cannot stomach, concludes Susmita.

 The final chapter of the book is devoted to his fans, to Sonia in the slums who identified her struggle with that of Amitabh in Muqaddar ka Sikandar, to Pankaj Ganatra who dressed up like Amitabh and drove an Amitabh vehicle to an Amitabh film, first day, first show.

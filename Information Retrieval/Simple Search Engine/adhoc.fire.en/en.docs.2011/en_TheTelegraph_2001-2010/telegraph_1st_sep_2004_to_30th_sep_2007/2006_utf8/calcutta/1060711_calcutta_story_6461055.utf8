 Furore over traffic mess at station

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The government on Monday was criticised in the Assembly not only by Opposition legislators but also by members of the treasury bench for its failure to ease traffic congestion around Howrah station.

 Participating in the transport department budget debate, CPM legislator from Howrah Lagan Deo Singh said the station area had become chaotic and it takes at least 20 to 25 minutes to cross the zone.

 ?Buses on 86 routes ply through the station area, besides thousands of taxis and long-distance buses. The entire zone and Howrah bridge are witness to traffic snarls throughout the day. Commuters have to suffer. The government should take immediate steps to decongest the area,? stated Singh.

 He suggested diversion of bus routes, shifting of the long-distance bus terminus from the station compound and revamp of the traffic dispersal system.

 ?The south-bound buses should be diverted to Vidyasagar Setu. Only north-bound vehicles should be allowed to ply on Howrah bridge. The long-distance bus terminus should be shifted to Babughat or some other place. Restrictions must be imposed on the movement of goods vehicles on the bridge,? the CPM legislator stressed.

 RSP legislator Id Mohammad said the area around Howrah station, which is a gateway to the city, has become a traffic nightmare.

 Trinamul Congress MLAs Subrata Bakshi, Tarak Bandopadhyay and Sonali Guha criticised transport minister Subhas Chakraborty for his failure to reduce traffic congestion around the station.

 ?The transport sector is grossly neglected. Road rules are absent and the department has no control over autorickshaws. Buses, taxis and three-wheelers are continuing to pollute the air, but the government remains a silent spectator,? said Bandopadhyay.

 Chakraborty argued that his department had taken several steps to reduce traffic congestion and improve infrastructure to increase vehicular speed. ?We have laid emphasis on upgrade of transport infrastructure by constructing flyovers, underpasses, bypasses and introducing a mass rapid transit system to cope up with the rising number of vehicles,? stated Chakraborty.

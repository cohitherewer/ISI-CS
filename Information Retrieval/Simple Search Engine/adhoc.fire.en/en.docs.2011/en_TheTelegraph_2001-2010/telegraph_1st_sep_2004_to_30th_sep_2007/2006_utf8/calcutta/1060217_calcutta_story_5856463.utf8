 The convocation ceremony on Thursday may have gone off without a hitch, but there is little hope of normalcy returning to the Bengal Engineering and Science University (BESU) campus in a hurry.

 Following the clashes that broke out between two student factions on Tuesday night, BESU vice-chancellor N.R. Banerjea ruled out resumption of undergraduate classes till next week. ?I had asked the students to vacate the hostels by Wednesday but the students? union has said its members will not do so. I have already sent a report to the disciplinary committee for further action.?

 Debroop Sengupta, cultural secretary of the students? union, said: ?Suspending classes indefinitely will not solve the problem, it will only go against student interests.?

 Banerjea aims to convene a meeting of the guardians of all undergraduate students next week and urge them to rein in their wards. ?BESU alone cannot take responsibility for such acts of violence by students; let the guardians shoulder some of it,? he said on Thursday, soon after the eighth annual convocation of the university that was attended by chancellor Gopal Krishna Gandhi.

 The vice-chancellor said students found guilty of destroying university property would be fined Rs 5,000. The students? union denied that any property had been damaged in Tuesday night?s violence.

 The matter was raised in the Assembly on Thursday, with Trinamul Congress MLA Saugata Roy asking chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to intervene and restore normalcy at BESU. 

 ?Such an incident is not expected in an institution like BE College,? said Roy.

 Vice-chancellor Banerjea hinted at a sinister design to malign the university when it is poised to gain IIT status. ?Everything was going in the right direction till the clashes between the rival student unions broke out,? he rued.

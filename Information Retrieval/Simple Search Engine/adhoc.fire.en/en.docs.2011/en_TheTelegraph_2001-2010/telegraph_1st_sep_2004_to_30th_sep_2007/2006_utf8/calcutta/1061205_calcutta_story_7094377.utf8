 MOHUA DAS

 Jackie Shroff is back in town, 

 this time to shoot for Raatporir Roopkatha with Indrani 

 Halder (picture by Aranya Sen). After playing Chunnilal 

 in Devdas and a zamindar in Antarmahal, he 

 sheds his dhoti-clad Bangalibabu image and dons an urban 

 look in Sanghamitra Chaudhuris second feature film. This 

 is what Jaggudada had to say at Ghoshbari on 

 Harish Mukherjee Road...

 On Raatporir Roopkatha: One fine morning I got a sudden call from Dev, the cinematographer who introduced me to Sanghamitra. She gave me the story idea and I immediately agreed to do the film. I really liked the concept of a lonely widower falling in love with a sex worker. A portion of the film is based in Sonagachhi and Ive heard of it being a red-light area that is most active and conscious in AIDS awareness and prevention.

 On his role: I play an urban middle-class man called Kamal who works in an event management company. He is a soft-spoken person leading a normal life. After his wife dies, he is taken to Sonagachhi by a friend, where he meets Rajani. This is the point from where Kamals life takes a turn. The character is extremely sensitive... I shot a couple of scenes with Indrani, who I met for the first time. She came across as a fine actress... Im using a prompter but would love to dub for the film and improve my Bengali diction. I try talking to the crew here in Bengali jol khabo, ami tomake bhalobashi (laughs).

 On Calcutta: The city makes me a more tame person unlike my wild self in Mumbai. I have always been awed by Bengals literary and cultural richness. The city has produced great directors like Satyajit Ray and Mrinal Sen. Some of the most beautiful women also come from this land. Take Sharmila Tagore and Rani Mukherjee, for example. I am also fascinated by Calcuttas rosogolla and mishti doi. My father was an astrologer who would travel to Calcutta very often and I remember waiting for the white spongy balls dripping with juice he would bring back... I would love to visit a tram yard and if possible take a ride.

 On regional films: After Antamahal, I have been very keen on doing more Bengali films. Im supposed to act in Ujjwal Chatterjees Shesher Kobita in the role of a freedom fighter. Talks are also on with Anjan (Dutt) for a short role in his next project. That apart, I have been doing a couple of films in Telegu and had a great experience working for a Kannada film called C/o Footpath directed by a 10-year old boy, sure to make it to the Guinness Book of World Records!

 On future 

 projects: Im waiting for the release of Vidhu Vinod 

 Chopras Eklavya, where I play the bad guy, and Priyadarshans 

 Bhagam Bhag where I am a police commissioner. 

 Ive also done a cameo for Feroz Nadiadwalas Fool 

 and Final.

 And Im really excited about acting in this Hollywood film First Fear directed by an American film-maker called Paul Nicholas. I take on five different roles in this magical thriller where Im supposed to be this ageless and casteless devils advocate called Nagaar who appears in the guise of a blind beggar, antique keeper, toy seller and a multimillionaire. I would have to sit through five hours of make-up every day while shooting in Hyderabad; I have another schedule in Goa. The film should be ready for release in 2007... 

 I do films out of my absolute love for acting. Its been 27 years and the passion still hasnt died.

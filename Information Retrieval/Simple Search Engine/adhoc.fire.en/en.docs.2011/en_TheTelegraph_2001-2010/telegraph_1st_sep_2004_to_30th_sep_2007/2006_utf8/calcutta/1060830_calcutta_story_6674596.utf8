The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Water tax for better drainage

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Pay water tax if you dont want flooded streets next monsoon.

 Imposition of the tax by 2007 is one of the conditions laid down by the Asian Development Bank for sanctioning any more money for the ongoing Calcutta Environment Improvement Project (CEIP), that includes revamp of the citys drainage system.

 The bank has asked us to instal meters for all water consumers in Calcutta by January 2007. Unless we impose the tax, it will not release the next instalment of the CEIP funds, municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya said on Tuesday. 

 The minister admitted the process of installing meters may take a little longer than the deadline set by the bank.

 Calcuttans have to cough up water tax unless they want to be flooded. We will use the money to improve drainage. Eventually, the tax will be imposed across the state, Bhattacharya asserted.

 Area-based property tax is another qualifying clause for the ADB money. Were ready to introduce the system. A bill is pending with a House select committee, the minister said.

 Of the planned expenditure of Rs 1,803 crore under the CEIP, the state has spent Rs 157 crore on improving drainage, slum development and solid waste management.

 The earlier Trinamul Congress board of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation had tried to impose water tax, but had to back out following opposition from party chief Mamata Banerjee.

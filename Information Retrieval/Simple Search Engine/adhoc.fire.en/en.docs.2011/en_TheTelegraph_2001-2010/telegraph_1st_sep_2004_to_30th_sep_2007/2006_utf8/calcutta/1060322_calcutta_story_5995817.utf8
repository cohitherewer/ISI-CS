The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Where streets 

 have no lights

 Calcutta, we hear, is firmly in the 

 spotlight. Yet, driving in the dark is a norm every night 

 on several thoroughfares. Take the plush and pitch black stretch 

 from Victoria Memorial to Alipore. CESC says power is provided 

 to all the lampposts in the area; it?s up to the maintenance 

 agencies to ensure that there is light. Police are wary of 

 car crash and crime in the cover of darkness... 

 Spot: 

 Bordering Victoria Memorial

 Time: 

 8.40 pm

 What we saw: Not 

 one streetlight for speeding traffic.

 Copspeak: ?Our patrolling 

 units have lodged numerous complaints. A serious accident 

 is waiting to happen? ? South Traffic Guard official.

 PWDspeak: ?Had police 

 informed us earlier, we would have repaired the lights... 

 We will start repair work soon? ? minister Amar Choudhury.

 Spot: 

 Alipore zoo/ National Library

 once? ? Sadhan Banerjee, vice-chairman.

 Tech twist to beauty basics

Be it the dual colour lipstick or the lash 

styling mascara, innovation is the name of the make-up game. Shradha Agarwal 

puts on some popular picks

Make-up shopping isnt the same anymore. Not since technology has taken over. The good old days of picking up one pinkish-brown lipstick, peach blush-on, black mascara and neutral eye-shadow are over. The list today reads more like this: Glam Shine Cream, a long lasting shiny lip-gloss with hydrant, Volume Shocking, a two-step volume construction mascara, multi-coloured mosaic eye palette and more.

 I always hoped we would reach this stage and I am so glad that we finally have, says make-up expert Ambika Pillai, who has been in the profession for the past 15 years. And whats best is that everything is available in India now.

 A dedicated research team, expected to come up with cutting-edge technology every day, is an essential part of any make-up brand today.

 The technology team is by far the most crucial in any beauty company these days, stresses Fiona Caroline, national training manager of Christian Dior.

 She explains the working of the technology team in Paris. Our very existence is based on three pillars of technology ? molecular biology that studies cells minutely, ethno-botany that is constantly finding plants and fruits to add to the natural ingredients, and sensorial science that concentrates on the smell, feel and look of the product.

 Such extensive research goes into producing couture products like the dazzling Princess Ring (that houses a lip balm) or Dior Gourmette (the bracelet that flaunts dual lip tones).

 Advanced make-up products are an instant hit, especially with women who are always on the move and are hard-pressed for time. There is a marked increase in interest in the make-up segment, resulting of course in consistent growth in sales, says Naveen Misra, unit head of Shoppers Stop, Forum.

 But not every beauty product needs a technological touch. The kajal for instance, is one make-up article that is better off without any fancy facelift. Thank god, they havent tampered with the kajal and I sincerely hope they never will, says Ambika.

 But for other things that are not so naturally perfect, a touch of technology is more than welcome. GoodLife profiles some such make-up products.

 Base buy

 Light, medium or dark? Easy days that involved such simple decision-making are long gone. Enter the stressful chore that involves finding your undertone first. Especially so if youre shopping at the LOreal counter, where they urge you to find your true match, a latest on the foundation front.

 This involves three steps ? finding your skin tone level (fair, medium, dark), then understanding your undertone (warm, neutral, cool) and finally the right combination of ivory, beige-sand or beige ? for Rs 600.

 Wonder-finish, a stick from Maybelline combines a concealer, foundation and compact in one. Priced at Rs 399, talk about three-in-one thrills.

 The texture and consistency of the make-up base has also undergone quite a change. Foundation, earlier, used to be liquid or too cakey ? either too runny or too thick. But now the consistency is perfect, says make-up artist Abhijit Chanda.

 Ditto for the application procedure, thanks to fancy blenders and brushes. The newer tools are super fast, enabling us to do four faces in the time that used to be reserved for just one, adds Abhijit.

 Eye array

 A simple tool to define the eyelashes? Well, think again because todays mascara is as jazzy as it gets. It is one product that has been given a complete high-tech makeover, says Ambika.

 After LOreals Double Extension Mascara, promising 60 per cent longer lashes, Volume Shocking that involves a base coat for a scaffold effect and a top coat for explosive volume, the latest to join in is the Lash Stylist Mascara by Maybelline. A two-tiered, V-styling comb applicator to design, grab, lift and thicken the lashes is its USP. False lashes, anyone?

 so available is a range of coloured eye pencils that triple as lip pencil, eye pencil and kohl.

 Shimmer and shine apart, the most cutting-edge eye-shadow on todays shelves is the ColorStay 12-hour Eye Shadow by Revlon. Available in four hue combos, this claims to be waterproof, crease-proof, fade-proof and smudge-proof.

 Lip line-up 

 The world of make-up has not quite been the same since the kiss-proof lipstick was invented. Very matte in nature, the next natural step was to take this forward to a gloss version ? precisely what some brands have done.

 Be it Chambors Moisture Plus lipsticks or LOreals Glam Shine Cream, long-lasting shimmer on the lips is the new way to go.

 But the latest in lip line is Happy Hour Lipcolor ? a dual shade (creme and shimmer) combo in the same tube, meant for mornings and evenings. Quite a steal for Rs 165. Also check out lip-stainers, something that Abhijit dubs the greatest gift of technology to the world of make-up.

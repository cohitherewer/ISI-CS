 Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya, along with municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay and legislators Dinesh Bajaj and Mohammad Sohrab, undertook a tour of Marcus Square last week, ahead of the January 1 inauguration of the temporary facility for College Street market shopkeepers there. 

 Single-floor, tin-roofed structures, divided into blocks, have come up on the 16.5-bigha park to accommodate 1,200-plus shopkeepers of the market, which will be razed to construct a seven-storeyed book mall.

 We hope to rehabilitate the shopkeepers in the mall within 18 months of the start of construction, said Bhattacharya. 

 Bengal Shelter Housing Development, along with the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), has constructed the temporary facility. Potted plants have been used to beautify the area and police have been deployed near the park entrance.

 We will run our shops in Marcus Square till the mall is ready, but the infrastructure at the park needs improvement. We require better lighting, water supply and an entrance facing Central Avenue so that customers can visit the market easily, said Bimal Kumar Nag, president of College Street Market Byabosayee Samity. He also called for safeguards against rain.

 The CMC is conducting a camp at College Street market to hand out licences to irregular traders, after assessment and mutation of their shops. The camp will continue till December 31.

 The demolition of the College Street market will start on January 15, 2007, and will be carried out in phases. Managing director of Bengal Housing Shelter Development Samar Nag, who accompanied the mayor, said: We hope to raze the building by March-end and start construction of the mall soon after. The shopkeepers will be rehabilitated on the ground and first-floor of the mall by the middle of 2008. We intend to complete the rest of the construction in another 18 months. 

 The shopkeepers had initially protested the move to raze the 89-year-old market under the banner of College Street Market Byabosayee Samity. They agreed to shift to Marcus Square after a meeting with the mayor on November 24.

 The guru strives towards the peak

 ?It is like the billi and chuha, your hand is the chuha and eyes the billi, your eyes will always follow your hand like the cat and mouse??

 ?Like Tom and Jerry,? quips one young voice, and there is laughter all round.

 Few would have guessed that the workshop in progress was being conducted by one of the greatest Indian dancers, Pandit Birju Maharaj.

 From the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award in his 20s to the Padma Vibhushan, Kalidas Samman, Nritya Choodamani, Andhra Ratna, Nritya Vilas, Adharshila Shikhar Samman, Soviet Land Nehru Award, Shiromani Samman, Rajiv Gandhi Peace Award and more recently, the Deshikottam award, he has won them all. 

 Yet, while instructing the participants at the annual Kathak workshop by Padatik, the maestro remarks: ?All my awards I heap at the feet of my gurus, father Achchhan Maharaj and uncle Lachchhu Maharaj. I am still a student striving for perfection.?

 At 68, he takes daily nine-hour training sessions in his stride because ?dance is water, I am a fish that swims in it?.

 Tucking a paan into his mouth, he continues to enunciate the rhythm ?digi digi thei, digi digi thei.? His hands demonstrate the gestures and one can see him mentally working out the movements. 

 ?The most important thing is that even in this age, when every film is a nightclub where heroines do the cabaret, young ones like these are coming to learn Kathak.?

 The guru has reservations about fusing Kathak with modern dance. ?You wouldn?t normally enjoy sugar, salt, chilli and imli in your fruit juice, would you? What is it nowadays ..kursi ke upar, kursi ke niche? totally meaningless? I still remember working with Satyajit dada, he understood me,? said Maharaj.

 ?There is a message for this age of communal violence,? said the guru. Tolerance is the theme of his forthcoming dance drama on different percussion instruments, called Nad Gunjan. 

 ?There will be no songs. Just the sound of all the different drums I can play,? said Birju Maharaj.

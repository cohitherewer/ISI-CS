The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 In search of a new stage space

 Passing 

 Through

 Jean-Guy Lecat at 

 The Stadel on Friday evening. Picture by Sanat Kr Sinha 

 Jean-Guy Lecat is here to examine 

 some prominent city theatres in terms of how well the architecture 

 helps in concentration and enlivens the relationship between 

 audience and actors. And who is Jean-Guy Lecat to examine 

 and evaluate our theatres? Well, he is credited with the 

 design, transformation and creation of more than 200 theatres 

 around the world. And if that is not enough, he has worked 

 with a certain Samuel Beckett and been Peter Brooks set 

 designer for over 30 years.

 All around me I find theatre 

 houses which remind me of 15th Century Italy. It is not 

 just India, this is true all over the world... we seem to 

 be trapped in boxes within boxes! But this is the 21st century, 

 and it is high time we tried to change the relationship 

 between stage space and audience, declared Lecat, who will 

 also conduct workshops and interact with local theatre directors, 

 technicians and architects during his five-day stay in town.

 Organised by Anya Theatre and 

 Aarshi Theatre groups in collaboration with The French Association 

 and Eastern Zonal Cultural Centre (EZCC), the events will 

 be spread over the newly-opened Anya Theatre Bhavan in Salt 

 Lake, Max Mueller Bhavan, Bharatiyam, Bangla Akademi and 

 Sujata Sadan.

 A hundred years ago someone said 

 of theatres, we cannot make new food in an old pot. But 

 we still havent been able to figure out what a new space 

 for theatre must look like. In Europe, some theatres have 

 given way to multifunctional spaces but even these are not 

 perfect. We are too comfortable, less willing to experiment. 

 India must think of something for herself. If the plays, 

 actors and audience are Indian, why not have Indian spaces? 

 asked Lecat.

 The Frenchman, who started as 

 a factory worker, took up architecture and then moved to 

 set and theatre designing, feels theatres should never be 

 treated like temples. They should be neutral zones, open 

 to interpretation. The right way for architects to build 

 theatres is to begin by asking and then working in collaboration 

 with set designers.

 One reason why there was no 

 problem with sets in ancient theatre is that the architect 

 was himself the set designer, said Lecat.

 In the Avignon version of Peter 

 Brooks Mahabharata, the theatre was an open limestone 

 quarry outside the city where spectators sat on scaffolding 

 facing massive boulders, rose-tinted cliffs 100-ft high 

 and a vast playing space filled with luminous yellow sand.

 A canal of real water, constructed 

 by Lecat, flowed across the back of the space with a small 

 pond reflecting the action down front. Lecat, who has also 

 worked in car parks and built temporary stages in abandoned 

 music halls, warns against giving too much importance to 

 space.

 For me, sets come last in the 

 list of priorities in any theatre production. First comes 

 the idea, second the text, third and fourth are the actors 

 and audience, next comes costumes which tell you when and 

 where and lights which can create the illusion. Space comes 

 last and if you have a good show you can even do without 

 sets, stressed Lecat, who now prefers to work with young 

 theatre professionals who drive him on to continue searching.

 Theatre is complex, he feels, 

 because one has to take so many human beings into consideration 

 and all questions should be resolved within the time frame. 

 But it is also about keeping things simple and freeing 

 ourselves.

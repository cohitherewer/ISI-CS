 Poll appeal has CMC off guard

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The city civic authorities are in a dilemma over South 24-Parganas magistrate Roshni Sen?s request to sink 40 tubewells and construct 31 latrines for the use of security forces serving in the district during the Assembly elections. 

 The tubewells and the latrines are to be provided on the school compounds where the paramilitary forces will be stationed. The district magistrate has also requested 30 water tankers for the troops. 

 ?We have to examine first whether the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has the resources and manpower to satisfy the requirement after meeting the commitment to our tax-payers,? said mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya on Wednesday. 

 Municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay met chief engineer (water supply) Bibhas Maity in the evening to discuss the issue. Maity reportedly told Bandyopadhyay that it was beyond the capacity of the water supply department to sink so many tubewells in a week?s time. 

 During the general elections, the CMC provides 35 tankers to the booth offices where there is a shortage of water. It also keeps about 20 tankers ready to meet possible crises in city pockets due to power failure or pipeline breach. 

 The civic water supply department has about 50 tankers, according to the chief engineer. ?It is the first time the CMC has been asked to sink tubewells for an election. It will take quite a bit of time to complete the job. We are trying our best to do as much as we can,? said Maity. 

 The district authorities have requested for the tubewells to be sunk and the latrines built on school compounds in Alipore, Behala, Jadavpur and Metiabruz, among other places. 

 The water supply department had got in touch with contractors, but almost all of them expressed their inability to sink tubewells in such a short period of time.

 According to civic engineers, some of the schools on the district magistrate?s list do not have a tubewell. The majority of the schools have one tubewell and one or two latrines. 

 During meetings, district police authorities had repeatedly told the civic officials that the CMC need not make any arrangement for the state or district police this year. 

 The cops asked the civic body to, instead, provide for the paramilitary forces from outside the state.

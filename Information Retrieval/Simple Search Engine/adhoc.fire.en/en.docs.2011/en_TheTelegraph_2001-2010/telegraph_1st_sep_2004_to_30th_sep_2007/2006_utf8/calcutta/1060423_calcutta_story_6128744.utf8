 Combat for 

 the cause of animals

 Stray dogs on a 

 city street. A file picture 

 One grew up in a family of animal 

 lovers, the other in a family indifferent towards animals. 

 Today they are both forerunners in the welfare of stray 

 animals of Mumbai. Goodicia Vaidya and Fizzah Shah of IDA 

 (In Defence Of Animals, India).

 Goodicia has been attending to 

 stray dogs and cats since she was 16 years old. Now she?s 

 50 and still raring to go. All day in the sweltering summer 

 heat, she does the rounds of Mumbai streets picking up sick 

 and ailing dogs, accident cases and dogs for sterilisations. 

 Her childish streak is palpable when she lets me in on a 

 well-guarded secret. Goodicia was working in a shipping 

 company. Every day for 18 years, she would step out during 

 her lunch break to feed the stray dogs. Since she was low 

 on funds she made them a meal of discarded pieces of bread 

 slices (generously given to her by sandwichwallahs), a little 

 milk (worth Rs 2) and a lot of water.

 Today her commitment towards these 

 animals has grown a hundred fold and she has long forgotten 

 her promise to her husband of cutting down on the animal 

 welfare work! Though she is a perfect example of a guardian 

 angel for animals ? always by their side, she?s sensible 

 and practical enough to admit that if an animal is seriously 

 injured or has a terminal illness, it must be put to sleep 

 and not kept alive for sentimental reasons. These animals 

 deserve a healthy and qualitative life and there?s no sense 

 in prolonging an ailing animal?s deteriorating condition.

 Though her family was not supportive 

 of her love for stray animals, today Fizzah Shah has turned 

 out to be the toughest crusader leaving no stone unturned 

 to fight for the rights of animals. When her building society 

 objected to the presence of stray cats and physically assaulted 

 them, she took them to court. She fought a lone battle against 

 the 60-odd flats and used her personal funds to fight the 

 case. The ruling was in her favour and today the cats roam 

 the building premises freely. Fizzah has faced a lot of 

 flak from all quarters, be it neighbours, police officers 

 or people who believe animals and their rights are frivolous 

 issues.

 Not anymore, because she has been 

 given a special card by the Mumbai high court whereby every 

 police station in Mumbai has to take cognisance of her complaint. 

 Fizzah believes that for any kind of welfare one needs to 

 have the ?fighting spirit? and ample funds. Fortunately 

 for the strays of Mumbai, she has both. She works with missionary 

 zeal, feeding 325 dogs and cats daily and is currently in 

 the process of setting up an animal shelter for injured 

 and old animals and abandoned pets on her five-acre plot.

 IDA, established in 1995, has 

 struggled hard to protect the rights of animals in Mumbai 

 for eight years now. It is progressing by leaps and bounds. 

 In 1978, 252 dogs were sterilised, while in 2002 the number 

 was nearly 10 times more at 2,448! It has been working on 

 other fronts too ? from running an OPD and ambulance service 

 for sick and injured animals to organising adoption programmes, 

 wildlife rescue and vaccination drives to educating schoolchildren.

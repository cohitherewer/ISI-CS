The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

On amp; Off

Brick Lane to Bengal

Screen On amp; Off

 Tannishtha Chatterjee: 

 Looking up

 Calcutta is all set to become the backdrop for the much-debated filming of Monica Alis Brick Lane, sometime later this year. Starring Tannishtha Chatterjee and Satish Kaushik, the film came under attack from a group of Bangladeshis who felt certain portions of the novel were insulting. The uproar had forced the production house to shoot the film in the Chapel Street area instead of on-location Brick Lane.

 Some childhood portions of my character Nazneen will be shot in West Bengal. The team had earlier intended to shoot in Bangladesh. But since the two places have similar landscapes, they thought of Bengal, said Tannishtha from Delhi.

 Nazneen is a first-generation Bangladeshi immigrant leading a claustrophobic life in Londons Brick Lane. Satish Kaushik plays her much older husband, Chanu. The film is being directed by Sarah Gavron.

 Tannishtha feels the controversy over Brick Lane was completely uncalled for. Those who protested the shooting were only a handful of people and they hadnt even read the book. I have read both the novel and the script and havent found anything offensive, added the National School of Drama graduate who bagged the role after an audition.

 But before Brick Lane brings her down, the dusky actress will breeze through Calcutta when her Bengali film directed by German film-maker Florian Gallenberger, Shadows of Time, releases on September 8.

 Tannishtha will return to London in September-end to finish some leftover scenes of Brick Lane.

 Padma Lakshmi: Food fetish

 As reports spread of Salman Rushdie feeling lonely at home with Padma Lakshmi coming into her own professionally and staying away from the authors Notting Hill home, here is a taste of what the young and restless wife has been up to.

 As the host of Planet Food, a Discovery Travel amp; Living show to be beamed on Wednesday at 3 pm, Padma Lakshmi travels to India in order to provide viewers access to an array of unique recipes from hot-and-spicy southern India.

 From the scrumptious Hyderabadi 

 Biryani to the staple Sambhar, she seems to be enjoying 

 every bit that is on offer on the platter of life that 

 is.

 The programme is meant to bring 

 viewers face to face with the sheer vibrant lifestyle of 

 a region through its cuisine. Wonder how palatable Mr Rushdie 

 would find the fare!

 Boman Irani, Parvin Dabas 

 and Anupam Kher: Laugh riot

 The makers of the film Khosla Ka Ghosla have shot a promotional music video featuring Anupam Kher, Boman Irani and Parvin Dabas. It is a satirical take on the concept of the film slated for a September release. 

 Khosla Ka Ghosla is about 

 a common mans struggle to build his dream house and keep 

 his family under one roof.

 Apart from the trio, the film stars Kiran Juneja, Tara Sharma, Ranvir Shorey and Navin Nischol.

 This is just a promotional tool to convey the kind of film Khosla Ka Ghosla is. I have tried to encapsulate the entire film in this song, says director Dibakar Bannerji.

 So, the music video features Khosla (Anupam Kher), a vulnerable person who is being manipulated by his family, his son, played by Parvin Dabas, and a larger than life villain, Boman Irani.

 I am playing the quintessential common man found in RK Laxmans cartoons and represent the middle class of today The film is a slice of life and there will be a lot of people who will be able to identify with Khosla, said Anupam Kher.

 My character Khurana is loud 

 and pompous but not a very bad guy just a very very north 

 Indian Punjabi man! This video symbolises the claustrophobia 

 that Khosla faces in making his dream house and keeping 

 his children under one roof. So his own son and I are trying 

 to bury him alive inside his own dream or dream house, 

 added Boman Irani.

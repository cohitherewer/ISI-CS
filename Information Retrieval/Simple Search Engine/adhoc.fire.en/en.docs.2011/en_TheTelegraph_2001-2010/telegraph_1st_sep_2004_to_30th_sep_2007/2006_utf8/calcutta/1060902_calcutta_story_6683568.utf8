The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Pool car deadly menace for 24x7 team

 DEBASISH CHATTOPADHYAY AND BISWARUP GOOPTU

 Early on August 27, Sunday, as the skies opened up, six youngsters headed for work at Aegis BPO, a call centre in Sector V, were involved in a car crash on EM Bypass. Their speeding pool car, a Tata Sumo, skidded off the wet road near Science City and hit the railings, before turning turtle.

 Kaushik Pandey and Rekha Mohanty, both around 22, died in the accident; their colleagues Manish, Baisakhi, Arunima and Dinesh are undergoing treatment in Ruby General Hospital.

 All occupants of the car were taken to hospital, where Kaushik and Rekha were declared dead. We will interrogate the driver once he recovers, said S.N. Gupta, superintendent of police, South 24-Parganas.

 Why did it happen? Aegis employees, on condition of anonymity, told Metro that this was not the first time such an accident had occurred. The pool cars have been involved in minor accidents before, said an employee. Such a fatal accident was just waiting to happen.

 The drivers, they alleged, are fined each time they miss a drop/pick-up-and-return deadline. So, rash driving is the norm. On the Bypass, they drive at over 100 kph. Its scary, admitted an employee.

 Some employees claimed the BPO management had tried to hush up things.

 The official line: Aegis, a US, $150-million organisation headquartered in Irving, Texas, has gone into damage-control mode. This is a shocking incident, and we have plans to initiate strong measures to ensure something like this never happens again, said Aparup Sengupta, CEO, Aegis BPO, in Sector V. Sengupta denied the matter had been hushed up or that pool cars were penalised for delays.

 The victims: Kaushik, from Contai, in East Midnapore, lived in a rented flat with his family at Survey Park. His father and brother have gone to Contai to perform the last rites, said his landlady.

 Rekha lived with her husband at Bijoygarh. They were married less than two months ago. The husband has gone to Orissa to perform her last rites, said her landlady.

 Why the scare: Rash driving by pool cars is the bane of all odd-hour employees. This is especially true of the 24x7 industries. If the pool cars are not slowed down, late at night and early in the morning, the accident toll is bound to rise.

 HUM TUM: Kunal Kohli strikes 

 more than a pose with his Nach Baliye co-judge Malaika 

 Arora Khan

 Its been more than six years since Kunal Kohli has appeared on a television show. In the meanwhile, he made a dud directorial debut on the big screen only to follow it up with two big Bollywood blockbusters. And if the last time round he was tearing apart movies on the small screen, in his new telly stint he will be dissecting dance moves.

 This time, its by invitation, says the new Nach Baliye judge over phone from Mumbai. STAR called me up some time back and asked me to take last years judge Farhan Akhtars place. Farhan is, of course, busy with the post-production work of Don. Now, I have no ego issues, I do not get complexed about these things. And I have also loved the show. So we froze all the details pretty quickly on the phone itself.

 Kunal, who delivered the Aamir-Kajol superhit Fanaa earlier in the year, is very clear that he is not judging the second season of the popular STAR One show because of money matters. I havent struck any big financial deal, he laughs. I am also not doing this just because I am free. I got hold of all the DVDs of Season One and I loved Nach Baliye. You have to take into account the kind of hard work and effort that these couples give on the show. They have started practising a month before the show goes on the floors and that too eight hours a day!

 The man, who shot to fame with the Saif-Rani rom com Hum Tum, makes no bones about the fact that he has two left feet. I am not a good dancer, Kunal spells it out. But when it comes to songs in my film, I prefer to be involved with the moves. Most directors leave it to choreographers when it comes to picturising songs, but I prefer to be around all the time.

 When it comes to his own dance favourites, Kunal doesnt surprise. I love Shammi Kapoor and Hrithik, he says at one go. Aamir is a good dancer, he was so good in the Rang de basanti track. Also, Mr Bachchan, who has his own style of dancing.

 Unlike most of the judges on talent hunts and reality shows on Indian TV, Kunal doesnt want to take a stand when he eases into the judges seat with Malaika Arora Khan and Saroj Khan. I want to be my natural self, he offers. I am told that my natural self is brutally honest. But I wouldnt like to hurt the feelings of any of the participants. It is sad in itself when somebody is knocked out from the show. I would rather try and make them feel good.

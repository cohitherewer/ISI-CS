 7 killings, a life term

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Alipore court on Monday sentenced Biresh Poddar to life imprisonment for killing his wife, five minor daughters and a neighbour in 2000.

 On the night of December 16, 2000, Poddar strangled Rima, 13, Priti, 11, Smriti, 8, five-year-old twins Sweta and Bhavna, and wife Rita, 33, at their Muraripukur Road home in Maniktala. He then stabbed their neighbour Digvijay Sharma, before fleeing. He left a confession note.

 Poddar suspected Rita of having an affair with Digvijay. He was also upset that she had borne only girl children, said deputy commissioner (detective department) Gyanwant Singh. Sixth additional district and sessions judge S.P. Chatterjee sentenced Poddar to life imprisonment and fined him Rs 5,000.

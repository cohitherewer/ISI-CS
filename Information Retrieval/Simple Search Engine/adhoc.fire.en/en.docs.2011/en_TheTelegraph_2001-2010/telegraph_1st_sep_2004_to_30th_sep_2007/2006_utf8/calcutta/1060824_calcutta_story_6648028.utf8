The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Kicking up a fillip for football 

 - Hunt on for sponsors to fetch Arsenal, Everton and Inter Milan clinics

 SUBHRO SAHA

 Thierry Henry: An Arsenal 

 of soccer skills

 A kick of life for Calcuttas favourite sport from Thierry Henrys Arsenal and Luis Figos Inter Milan? Thats what a brand new initiative promises, if some star clubs of Europe and some sponsors agree to play ball.

 The shot is being fired by High Life, a division of the Selvel Vantage Group. We have already spoken to Arsenal, Everton and Inter Milan for coaching clinics, coach exchange programmes and even branded townships with a football focus, and they have specified their requirements, reveals Noomi Mehta, managing director, Selvel Advertising.

 This comes in the wake of football firsts like the path-breaking East Bengal-Leicester City partnership and city boy Chiraag Pauls induction into the Birmingham City Football Clubs academy.

 Luis Figo: Inter Milan 

 on the Maidan? 

 Now, soccer skill could get gift-wrapped from the Emirates Stadium (Arsenal), Goodison Park (Everton) or the San Siro (Inter) for city rookies struggling to make a mark on the Maidan of mediocrity. The hunt is on for sponsors and a start-up corpus. The Gunners have demanded Rs 4 to 5 lakh per month for image rights, while the rest will be against actuals, according to Jahan Mehta, who has turned out for Wari FC in the Super Division League and is now helping out dad Noomi in the soccer push.

 Everton has also spelt out its fees for sending coaches, conducting camps and entertaining Calcutta colts outfits periodically. The two primary infrastructure requisites are top-of-the-line training and match surfaces and residential accommodation for the camp trainees.

 The catch is watertight branding. For instance, you have to name the programme an Arsenal camp or an Inter Milan camp depending on which club runs the coaching scheme, stresses Noomi. Efforts are also on to get the foreign clubs to invest in land to set up soccer-centric townships, which will become prestige addresses.

 The buoyancy is echoed by Nigel Empson, CEO of sports management firm Prosporta, liaising with the overseas clubs. Most top European clubs have a global scouting network and everybody is now trying to link up with Asian players. India, with its sheer size and talent pool, throws up a very interesting option, he says.

 Empson, who also coordinated East Bengals Leicester tie-up, feels the task is to identify talent at an early age and expose them to quality coaching and international opposition.

 Selvel has been sounding out local corporate houses for the telling assist. Its not just an investment in soccer, but great brand-building for the company willing to join hands with an English Premier League or Serie A giant. We need a 100 Chiraags to ignite the ball park, smiles Noomi, also president of CC amp;FC.

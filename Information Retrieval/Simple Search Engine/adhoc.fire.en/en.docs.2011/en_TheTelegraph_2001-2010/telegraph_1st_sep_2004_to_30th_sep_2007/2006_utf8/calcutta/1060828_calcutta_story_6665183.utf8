The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Makeshift stalls clog streets

 Sovan chatterjee, chairmain of Borough XIV, Calcutta Municipal Corporation, met readers of The Telegraph at his office to answer their queries. 

Participants included Tapan Dutta, Somnath Chakraborty, Narayan Bhattacharya, Sumitra Pal, Radharaman Ghosh, Rama Dasgupta and Raja Mukherjee

Tapan Dutta: Several garbage vats in wards 125, 126, 132,131 and 124 are being broken down and makeshift shops and stalls are replacing them. Though we have informed Behala police and the local councillors, nothing has been done. The police officers hinted that the ruling party cadre and some political leaders are behind this. Can you take some steps to prevent such a practice? 

 This is an important matter, I have noticed this in many areas in Behala. The vats belong to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) and no one can demolish them for their personal use. This is illegal.

 Besides, these shops are also bothering the local residents, who have to bear the stench of garbage collected outside their houses. Even the buses and the autorickshaws are suffering due to traffic snarls on the roads. 

 Earlier, I had informed the matter to Behala police. But, as you said, the ruling party cadre is involved, so nothing has being done. 

 Are you aware that most of the councillors in these wards are not from the ruling party? The ruling party cadre are trying to tarnish the image of the Opposition.

 I will take up the matter in the corporation meeting and ask the mayor to look into such illegal practices. 

Tapan Dutta: The conservancy staff are erratic in these wards. We tried speaking to them and have even requested them to come regularly, but nothing has changed. 

 I will look into the matter. If you can give me the address of the conservancy office in your area, I can assure you that I will take some step. 

 We will first try speaking to the workers and persuade them. If the situation remains same, I will speak to the mayor. 

 During our tenure, we never faced such a situation because we controlled these errant workers. But the present CMC board hardly pays any attention to such problems. As a result, the common people, who are regular tax-payers, have to suffer. 

 It is quite obvious that the mayoral council member for conservancy is not supervising the units on a regular basis. 

 Hence, he and the board are not aware of the current scenario. I will discuss this matter in the corporation meeting and will try to reach some consensus.

Narayan Bhattacharya : There is a severe drinking water shortage in our area. Earlier, water was supplied between 11 am and noon every day. But now, the supply is quite irregular. Has the CMC decided to stop supplying water during this particular time? 

 I was not aware that the afternoon water supply has been stopped or is irregular. I will have to discuss this matter with officials of the department concerned. 

 I think the water supply has been stopped due to the falling pressure of water. Let me inquire the matter thoroughly, I will get back to you. 

Sumitra Pal: The mosquito menace has multiplied manifold in several areas in Behala. Will you please help us out? 

 Mosquitoes are creating havoc in many areas in the city, including Behala. Five people have already died of mosquito-borne diseases in the past eight months. 

 Unfortunately, the civic body has discontinued the services of the two people, who were engaged for spraying mosquito oil and pesticides in the area. 

 I had repeatedly requested the mayoral council member for health and other officials in the health department for appointing new workers. But nothing has been done, not a single worker has been engaged for spraying pesticide in the area. 

Raja Mukherjee: I have noticed that whenever the box drains in Behala Chowrasta are cleared, the soil or the mud is kept just next to the drain. After a shower, the soil flows back into the drain. Why cant you have the soil carried to the garbage vans as soon as the drains are cleaned? The soil litters the area and the stench is unbearable.

 Right now, we are clearing the drains on an emergency basis to prevent waterlogging. The problem you have mentioned is absolutely correct. The soil kept beside the drains is collected after a few days, when it dries up. Recently, we have got some funds to clean up the drains in the area, which are badly choked. The work will start as soon as the festive season is over.

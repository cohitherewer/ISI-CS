The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

On amp; Off

 Just for a few good films 

Screen On amp; Off

PRASHANT NARAYANAN, who plays Ravi Gupta in Shadows 

of Time, tells Reshmi Sengupta why he doesnt mind picking and choosing his 

roles.

and Florian Gallenberger at the Berlin Film Festiva.

What is your role in Shadows of Time?

This role has been a huge showcase for me... Ravi 

Gupta is an extremely strong personality, in terms of strength and values. His 

sense of perseverance and patience leads him to different situations that affect 

all the others in the story. It is an extremely honest portrayal, right in peoples 

faces.

How did the casting for the film happen?

Well, they had met quite a lot of actors, and their 

uncles and aunties too (!), and they were not happy. Then Aubin, one of the assistants, 

showed Florian (Gallenberger) Chhal, and he was interested in meeting me. 

There were a series of make-up tests and a couple of scenes shot here and there. 

Florian told me that the producer apparently jumped on the sofa when he saw me.

How was it to work with Florian?

 Prashant with Irrfan in Shadows of Time

He has an uncanny sense of framing things magically, 

which I am sure no film school can ever teach. He is a complete director who has 

been blessed with great skills of communication. We both were working in a foreign 

language, so it was rather important that we communicate with each other correctly. 

There were some initial hurdles but it was all resolved smoothly.

How different was the film-making set-up from that of an Indian film? 

Everything was organised and all kinds of production 

demands met with a strange sense of precision that the Germans are in any case 

famous for. I was thoroughly pampered, I must say. And surely Indian films and 

film-making could derive a lot out of this simple love story.

Was learning Bengali a problem?

I have had Bengali friends, so I understood the sound 

of the language before actually getting into the grammar. I dont like following 

a strict script so it was important that I understood the language just in case 

one needed to improvise. A little bit of mehnat for a good shot is really 

worth it. I have been to Calcutta many times before. One of my closest friends, 

Indranil Goswami, stays there. I am really looking forward to going there again.

How did the shoot in the red-light area go?

Most of them were sex workers and they were all such 

wonderful people to work with. I just hope they all go and watch the film. I remember 

we were shooting at Prabhat theatre and in the middle of the night I sang to at 

least 100 people there, a mini concert happened!

What happened after Chhal and Waisa Bhi Hota Hai Part II?

Both of them, being such good films, did not really 

get box-office results. But the critical acclaim for me especially in both these 

films has been really overwhelming.

But why do we see so little of you on screen?

Because I feel actors should be seen less on screen. 

Even when I was doing TV, I had the same belief. I want to make a really good 

DVD collection of my own where I could show my work in films to anybody, whenever. 

I am sure a lot of actors would be grimacing with their earlier work. I dont 

want to be part of that brigade. I would rather do a small role in a good film 

than a big role in a bad film.

What kind of offers do you get in Bollywood?

I think I have some 13 scripts lying at home with 

people who are trying to make them. It at least gives me hope that people still 

remember me, even with my idiosyncracies. I left Rang De Basanti. I do 

miss the fact that I am not part of the songs from Rang De. Theres nothing 

else I miss about not doing the film.

Are there more offers after Shadows? Any project that you have signed?

Well, I have been approached by an agent who used 

to be associated with Sean Penn when I had gone for the screening of Shadows 

in Toronto. She has told me that she would like to get in touch with me once 

the film hits America. Lets see.

I have just come back from England after shooting 

a British movie called Bombil and Beatrice directed by Kaizad Gustad. It 

has me playing Bombil and Katie McGuiness playing Beatrice. This also is a love 

story. It is a big-budget film, almost Rs 15 crore, a love story which begins 

in 1905 and gets its redemption in 2005. I play the same person in two lives, 

and it is quite amazing how different they both are. 

What are your plans from here on?

I am into music in a big way. My friends have a band 

called Agnee and I write songs for them. We have just been signed on by Sony BMG. 

They are working on the tracks in Pune.

I have also written some four feature films and am 

trying to make them happen. Film direction surely is an interesting avenue that 

I would love to explore.

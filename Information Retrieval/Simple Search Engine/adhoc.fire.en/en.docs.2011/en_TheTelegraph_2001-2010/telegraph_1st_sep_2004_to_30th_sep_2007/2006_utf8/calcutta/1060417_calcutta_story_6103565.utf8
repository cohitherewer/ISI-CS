 Human relationships form the basis of civilization and society. Our lives are nurtured and built by the relationships we share with our near and dear ones. Unfortunately, the so-called progress of society has brought in its wake the destruction of this core, sustaining fibre of life. Exposing the hollow sham of modern inter-personal kinships, Gandhar?s latest production, Satyaasatya, offers an ironic reflection of the falsity, deception and pretence we practise in our daily lives. Based on a play by J.B. Priestley, it presents a bitter portrayal of the utter dishonesty and futility of human relationships. Rooted in a bed of shallow, inane promises, they are kept alive by carefully concealing the essential void beneath, and shrouded under a veil of false amity and harmony. When this veil is accidentally lifted, we hide our faces in embarrassment, hurriedly endeavouring to restore social propriety by putting on our masks of deception once again. Direction: Shyamal Chakraborty.

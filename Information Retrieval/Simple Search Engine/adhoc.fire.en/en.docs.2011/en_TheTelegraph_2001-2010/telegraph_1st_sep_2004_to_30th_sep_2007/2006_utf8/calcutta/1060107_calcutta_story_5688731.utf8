 What: An exhibition of bridal collection by Roopa Vohra.

 Where: The Oriental Hall, Taj Bengal.

 When: January 7 to 9.

 The exhibition: The three- day fare is home to a variety of simple and elaborate pieces. Gold has been combined with diamond, precious stones like rubies, emeralds and semi-precious stones. 

 While some have a Victorian charm, others are very contemporary in appeal where the designs are an amalgamation of traditional and modern patterns.

 One can either choose from a complete set that includes a earring, neckpiece and hand accessories to match or can opt for single pieces.

 Then there are multipurpose ornaments where a baajubandh can be worn as a choker. Also on offer are beautiful rings and maangtikas.

 Pocket pinch: Starting from Rs 10,000, the price tag could move into lakhs.

 Voiceover: In keeping with todays fashion, I have used a lot of colour. Each item is a statement piece. They have been crafted with a lot of detailing and style, says Roopa.

 The collection not only caters to jewellery for the day but other occasions that surround a wedding. We are displaying jewellery for the bride as well as her family and friends, adds the designer from Mumbai who caters to some of the leading glamour girls of Bollywood and has even designed a piece for Hollywood star Liz Hurley recently.

 Roopas earlier exhibition in Calcutta, also at Taj Bengal, was a runaway hit and the designer plans to set up shop in the city soon.

 Bag it

 What: Salsa and Hidesign Couture, two new ranges from the house of Hidesign.

 When: The collection will hit the racks on Tuesday, January 10.

 Where: While Hidesign Couture will be available at the labels boutiques in City Centre and Forum, Salsa will be available at Landmark.

 The collection: Salsa is a range with almost 35 different kinds of designs. It targets young customers within the age group of 16 to 25. Interesting embellishments, colourful and functional, the range draws from the street fashion in Europe. The collection mostly catering to young women has some wallets and cross-bodied bags that men can opt for.

 The Hidesign Couture is a complete range that includes bags, jackets and other accessories. The collection has been done by Italian designer Alberto Siaschini. The line stands out because of the leather quality, detailed finish and a more evolved look.

 Pocket pinch: While Salsa starts at Rs 800, bags from the Hidesign Couture range would cost Rs 2,000-plus.

 Voiceover: We have come up with the collections after a lot of research. We realised that when it comes to the young brigade there is huge potential for a fashion product. So we came up with Salsa, a flamboyant and pocket- friendly line, says Kunal R. Sachdev, CEO of Hidesign.

 Hidesign Couture is a premium range and there are choices to compliment every mood. We are confident that the collection can compete with any other international brand, adds Kunal.

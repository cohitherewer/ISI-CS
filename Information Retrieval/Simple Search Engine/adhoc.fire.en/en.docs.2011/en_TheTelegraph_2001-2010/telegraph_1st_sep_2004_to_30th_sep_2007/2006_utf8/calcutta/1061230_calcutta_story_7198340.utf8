 The bards muse

 Pragya presents an evening on Tagores tryst with his inspiration, reflected through select readings and songs by reputed performers like Rakhi Sen, Dipak Rudra, Sumana Bhattacharya, Subroto Sengupta, Ananda Gupta and Dr Sudeshna Basu. Like a true visionary, Tagore never spaced out life and death, a beginning and an end. His only muse has been life which has manifested itself in different facets for the bard. He heralded humanity and love above everything. His tremendous zest for life amidst all melancholy found expression in verses, novels, short stories and, of course, music. Life for him was like a boundless ocean where he was a solitary sailor. In fact, Tagore was always a traveller in quest of love. Ideator Sujoy Prosad Chatterjee will weave together the musical evening with excerpts from the poets Chaturanga and Chokher Bali. The repertoire of songs would range from Bhalobashi bhalobashi to Ratri eshe jethai meshe diner parabare.

 Saoli Mitra performs Putulkhela at Tapan theatre

 Sixty years after Nabanna, even with the Left in power, we still don?t have a decent government hall where people can go to see plays and nothing but plays every day of the week? ? Saoli Mitra, during Sayak?s annual Natyabaktrita Mala at Bangla Akademi.

 For Saoli, the fact that in this digital age theatre workers have to make do with a handful of halls with shabby curtains, filthy green rooms, dated sound and lighting gadgets is galling. Nothing, she alleges, was being done to enrich minds. ?Why don?t we get together and create a space for ourselves? A theatre where one could be certain of getting all the basic facilities essential for good performance??

 Not too long ago, stage veteran Kumar Roy was ruing the fact that not enough dates were available for the annual Bohurupee theatre festival. ?Normally our shows run for a week but this year we had to cram three shows a day because only three days were free at the Academy of Fine Arts, where we have had this festival for 52 years,? said Roy.

 A common allegation is that auditoriums allot dates according to ?their preconceived notions? about a group?s importance and popularity. Also, theatre has to jostle for attention ? and space ? with music, dance and more. ?With the death of the north Calcutta theatre para, the scope has become extremely limited. The people who took the old halls on lease didn?t have the vision of those who started Biswaroopa or Star. So they allowed the halls to disintegrate,? said Meghnad Bhattacharya of Sayak.

 Sayak, along with Anya Theatre, Theatre Workshop and Sohan, has adopted Bijon Theatre for a 10-year term. ?During this period we will try to bring it on a par with the other popular halls,? promised Bhattacharya.

 Today Bijon is functioning primarily as a rehearsal centre for groups. Charges for a 24-hour rehearsal booking is a nominal Rs 125, while for shows the amount is just Rs 1,200 a day.

 Usha Ganguli, director, Rangakarmee, puts the space crunch down to the mushrooming of theatre groups all over Calcutta. She felt it acutely during the rehearsals for Visarjan. ?We need a place like Prithvi with small 200-300 seater auditoriums. Few groups can afford the large halls we now have,? she explained.

 For Swapnasandhani, space was a real problem till the group gained the support of Niva Arts, which owns Sujata Sadan and allows rehearsals there for just Rs 1,000 a month. ?Since we perform only at Sujata Sadan (except on call shows) we can tailor our performances to the map of the map,? said Koushik Sen.

 But most Calcutta theatre groups are not as lucky. Unable to hire rehearsal rooms on a regular basis, they turn to clubs, residences, rooftops and even school buildings after class. Anya Theatre, however, is set to change things a bit. To be inaugurated in June is the Anya Theatre Bhavan at CK-43 in Salt Lake. The land bought by the group 10 years ago wasn?t big enough to build an auditorium but the plan was to build rehearsal rooms, workshop space, guestroom, dormitory, a library and facility for audio-visual training.

 A timely grant of Rs 25 lakh by 

 veteran film-maker Mrinal Sen from the Member of Parliament 

 (Rajya Sabha) Local Area Development Fund and an additional 

 Rs 15 lakh from the department of culture helped complete 

 the building. Apart from hosting various projects by Anya 

 Theatre, the premises will be available on hire to other 

 theatre groups. Acknowledging the support of the Calcutta 

 Film Society and private donors, Bibhas Chakraborty said 

 that in a city of theatre lovers such contributions could 

 be expected to help stage endeavours.

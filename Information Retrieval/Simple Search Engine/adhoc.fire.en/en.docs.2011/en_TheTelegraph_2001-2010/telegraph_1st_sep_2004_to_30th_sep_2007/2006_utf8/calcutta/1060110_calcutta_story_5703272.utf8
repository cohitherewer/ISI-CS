 Music match: Anu Malik with the Idol finalists

 All the preliminary work taken care of, now it?s inching towards the big stage in the second season of Indian Idol. Of the finalists, there are three Calcutta girls ? Antara Mitra, Monali Thakur and Jolly Das ? and they have a lot of support from last year?s finalists in Abhijeet Sawant, Amit Sana and Aditi Paul.

 In fact, in Tuesday?s episode, you can catch five of Season One?s finalists performing and then introducing this year?s finalists before the Galas begin next Monday onwards. Don?t forget to catch judge Anu Malik in a special jig with the young aspirants singing Kab maine yeh socha tha from Duplicate.

 Not just that, hosts Aman Verma and Mini Mathur get into a friendly tiff as to whether the boys or the girls should take the first shot at the Gala rounds. Indian Idol comes on Sony, Mondays and Tuesdays at 8.30 pm.

 Most of their films together have flopped big time but when it comes to on-screen pairing, it seems Bunty and Babli, Abhishek Bachchan and Rani Mukherjee, can do no wrong these days. In the Best Jodi contest that STAR is running, the Abhishek-Rani pairing is way ahead of the rest (Shah Rukh-Rani of Paheli, Salman-Katrina of Maine Pyar Kyun Kiya, Saif-Preity of Salaam Namaste) even though the last date for the entries is Tuesday.

 So if you want to change the equations and not have Abhishek and Rani take the cake, you can vote in at www.indya.com. The lucky winners will get to watch the STAR Screen Awards live in Mumbai.

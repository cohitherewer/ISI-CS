The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Stroke by stroke 

 on cell screen

 TechTalk

 You?re 

 a cricket fanatic who dreads missing a single delivery of 

 an India-Pakistan tie. But you?re on the road and with no 

 television in sight, the insipid SMS score update is your 

 only option.

 That could change if Airtel?s 

 Cricket Genie has its way. The service launched by the cellular 

 service provider during the India-England series allows 

 a subscriber to watch ball by ball action, replays and highlights 

 on the mobile phone screen. Only, the action is not real-life 

 but simulated.

 ?If you?re near the television 

 or the radio, this is not for you. But today?s young people 

 are always on the move,? said Hemant Sachdev, director (marketing 

 amp; communication), Bharti Tele-Ventures.

 The service works on any GPRS 

 and Java-enabled handset. The user needs to first access 

 the Airtel portal and download the Cricket Genie application. 

 He can then choose from the menu of matches currently being 

 played and select whether he wants live action or highlights.

 ?The content is provided by Cricinfo.com. 

 Till we have 3G networks and full visuals, this is the next 

 best thing,? explained Sachdev.

 The rates for ?watching? the matches 

 vary from Rs 50 to Rs 99. In the past three weeks, ?over 

 15,000? users have downloaded the application, according 

 to Airtel.

Feng Shui Matters 

Pinky Kapoor

 According to Feng Shui, 

 the best source of fire energy is the sun and hence 

 people who lack fire energy should worship the sun god. 

 Also, people with weak earth elements can draw nourishment 

 from fire energy by worshipping the sun god. Being surrounded 

 by fire-related colours also helps

 Q: 

 My son was born on February 8, 

 1991 at 6.34 am. He is studying in Class IX. He cannot concentrate 

 on his studies and finds it difficult to memorise his lessons. 

 His room is situated in the north-east corner and while 

 studying he faces west most of the time, although he has 

 been provided a study table in the northern direction. Kindly 

 suggest the kind of career he should opt for. Also, is his 

 decision to study science correct?

 Name withheld

 THE SOLUTION: Your son is a weak earth person with creative and intelligence elements in abundance. Usually, with this configuration, the mind becomes overactive and gets distracted. As a result, the child gets exhausted and finds it difficult to concentrate on one thing. 

 The best way out is to strengthen his weak earth element with fire-related energetic colours. Fire represents education for him and will help him concentrate. Since the best source of fire energy is the sun, he should religiously worship the sun god. Encourage him to face his auspicious directions, either east or north, while studying. West is not favourable according to his kua number. 

 The best career option for him 

 would be pursuing computer engineering.

 Q: 

 I was born on 22.06.1982 at 1.10 

 pm. I dont have any friend and when I feel sad, I 

 keep myself aloof and isolated from the rest of the family. 

 I live with my parents and a younger brother, but there 

 is a huge communication gap between each of us. My bedroom 

 is located in the northern sector of the house and is painted 

 light green. I am a student of BA final year and also a 

 diploma holder in software engineering from NIIT. Please 

 guide me so that I can come closer to my family, make friends 

 and also enjoy a good career.

 THE SOLUTION: The four pillars of destiny reveal that you are loaded with four fire elements. These can be doubled to eight because you were born in mid-summer when fire is at its peak. Unless you interact with friends and family members, the excessive fire energy could become detrimental. 

 The green colour in your room further fuels the fire element. Change the colour scheme to cool shades of water with a touch of earthy hues. Activate the north-west area of the room with pictures of friends or a group of people chatting, partying and dancing.

 Similarly, adorn the eastern wall 

 of your room with family pictures in happy moods. These 

 will strengthen the bond and bring the family close. The 

 next year shows a good job for you.

 Cruel cut 

 Q: 

 We live in a joint family where 

 two bedrooms were built for the children last year. These 

 rooms were extended towards the north-west side of the house, 

 resulting in a major cut in the north-east side. Things 

 are not the same since. The children are not studying and 

 our family business has also hit a downward slope, which 

 has brought with it a lot of mental unrest. Please help.

 THE SOLUTION: Small projections in the house generally do not spoil the overall shape of the house. But if the projection is more than half of the length or the width of the property, then the remaining area gets a major cut. North-east is the most precious sector of the house without which it will undoubtedly be difficult to maintain tranquility, calm and peace in the house. I would recommend you construct a room towards the north-east so that the house regains proper shape. Then convert this space into a prayer or meditation or study room. Gods blessings flowing from this area will now bless you all and everything will fall into place. 

 If you cannot construct in this area then lay a copper strip underneath the ground in such a way that the strip completes the missing corner of the foundation. Then create a visual effect by having flowerbeds on the new line. Keep this corner well lit in the evenings to attract back the lost energy.

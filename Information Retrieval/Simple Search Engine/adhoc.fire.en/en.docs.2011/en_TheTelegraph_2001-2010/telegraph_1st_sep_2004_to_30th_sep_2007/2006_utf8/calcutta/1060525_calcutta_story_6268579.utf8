The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Not what the chemist ordered

 Can Aamir and Kajol do in Fanaa what Shah Rukh and Kajol did in Dilwale...? Or will the most anticipated pairing go horribly wrong like many in the past? Metro takes a look at some of the Bollywood twosomes more awful than awesome...

 SALMAN amp; PREITY

 She has struck gold with all 

 the other Khans ? SRK, Aamir and Saif ? but with Sallu miyan, 

 Preity hasn?t quite got the act right. The sparks that both 

 Chori Chori Chupke Chupke and Har Dil Jo Pyar 

 Karega managed to generate were all scored by Rani from 

 the sidelines. They have had their share of off-screen controversy 

 but kissing and making up has never been a problem. So, 

 will Jaaneman turn the tide for the twosome?

 HRITHIK amp; AMEESHA

 Yes, yes they debuted in one 

 of Bollywood?s biggest hits, but Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai 

 would have been as big a hit, if not bigger, had any other 

 actress done the sob job in place of our Stanford gold medallist. 

 It was their next outing Aap Mujhe Achche Lagne Lage 

 where the beans were spilled; it was all too evident 

 that the two were as flat as a flat tyre (forgive the Siddhuism). 

 No wonder, the pair hasn?t been repeated and is unlikely 

 to be seen together again.

 VIVEIK amp; AISHWARYA

 She rushing to his hospital bed 

 and he nursing her wounds. Oh... what love! But when the 

 two did come together on the big screen, it all went limp. 

 Kyun...! Ho Gaya Na? Since then the two have parted 

 ways in real life and Viveik has even turned down a meaty 

 role in Mani Ratnam?s Guru, which stars Ash in the 

 lead. Viveik had once told us about the debacle called Kyun...: 

 ?Bas! Ek bar ho gaya naa.?

 SHAHID amp; KAREENA

 They may be good in biology on 

 the small mobile screen but when it comes to big-screen 

 chemistry, Kapur and Kapoor just can?t get it right. While 

 the audiences refused to go Fida over their first 

 outing, their last haunt 36 China Town also went 

 empty. And in the upcoming Chup Chup Ke, Bebo is 

 mute and her beau pretends to be mute. Sure signs of a horrid 

 hat-trick. They can just yell Milenge Milenge...

 UDAY amp; TANISHAA

 It?s not without reason that their 

 film was rechristened Neal ?N? T***y by audiences 

 and critics alike. Tanishaa?s going under the scalpel must 

 have eaten into her costume budget for Neal ?N? Nikki 

 and she just ended up promoting multi-coloured lingerie. 

 Uday forgot his clothes too but not the pancake, making 

 him look straight out of an Interview with the Vampire. 

 Bad news: they managed to spoil Yash Raj?s dream run. Good 

 news: they won?t be seen together again.

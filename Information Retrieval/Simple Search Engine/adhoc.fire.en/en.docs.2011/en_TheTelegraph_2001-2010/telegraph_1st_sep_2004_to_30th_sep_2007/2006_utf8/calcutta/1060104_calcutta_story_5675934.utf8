 The sari, the simple stretch of a whole nine yards, has been there and done that. And now, the Bollywood screen sirens are endorsing it big time. Think Sushmita Sen, Shilpa Shetty and think Aishwarya Rai. Brand India in a sizzling sari.

 Much has been discussed and done about the various innovative drapes of a sari. Right from Shaina NCs 17 different techniques of draping a sari to Neeta Lullas twists and turns for Aishwarya and Madhuri Dixit in Devdas, the possibilities of playing around with the elegant yards is immense.

 But getting more out of your nine yards while sticking to the common drape of the sari is where the trick lies.

 A twist here and a twist there, say experts, can turn your look around totally, creating an illusion of a slimmer and taller you. Presenting the GoodLife guide to perfect sari draping.

 The way you carry yourself in a sari is most important, says designer Mona Lamba. By that she means the hold of the pallu and the stature in general.

 eating the pallu and fixing it up with the blouse looks cool no doubt, but for that you need a perfect figure too. If you are not confident enough to carry off the air-hostess look, then tighten your grip on the pallu near your waist, or better still, take the pallu around your neck, explains Mona.

 Tightening the pallu near the waist creates an illusion of a shapely waist. For a quick reference, just glance at any model sashaying down the ramp in a sari. Models invariably leave the pallu loose to showcase the design, but at the same time they have a tendency to keep their left hand close to their waistline ? all for that right effect.

 According to designer Pali Sachdev, tightening the last pleat to smoothen over your midriff is a great cover for fat.Hold the pleats from the inside and the last pleat that you make has to be flattened around your waist. This has to be tucked in tightly, she explains. 

 This is the same end of the sari that goes up to the pallu and hence, Mona too advises you to keep it neat and tight. After smoothening out the pleat on your left side taking it almost to your opposite side, tuck in any extra fabric on the right side of your pleats. This trick of tucking in any excess ensures no untidy bits and hence goes a long way in showcasing great posture and a slim appearance. 

 You should always go for many smaller pleats, rather than making a few wider ones. According to style consultant Sunipa Samadder, smaller pleats give an illusion of a slim figure. A five-and-a-half-metre sari when tied on a heavier person will manage only three pleats as opposed to the 10 pleats that a thin person will end up making, she says. The human mind is so geared to this idea that when you see a large number of pleats on a person, you naturally think the person to be slim.

 Smaller pleats have another advantage ? they do more justice to showing off the design of your sari. Broader pleats dont open up while you walk, hence hiding a considerable part of your sari. Smaller pleats tend to flare out while you walk, giving away the design details and any vertical illusions that your sari is trying to create, says Sunipa. 

 Most of us tuck in the pleats below the navel, but that gives an imbalanced look to the ensemble. With the pallu all over your left shoulder and then the pleats beginning at the navel and spread towards the left side, the weight of the sari looks shifted to the left. The pleats should always be tucked in such a way that the end of the pleats lie below the navel. Tucking in the pleats a little towards the right side and ending at the centre of your body ? your belly button ? lends a balanced look to the sari, confirms Sunipa. 

 Ever noticed how all the Bollywood actresses suddenly acquire a perfect hour-glass body as soon as they drape a sari around them? Well, the trick here is to create a nice V-shape with your sari. Make sure that your sari is slightly higher at the back and a little lower towards the front, says Sunipa. 

 This results in a V-shape, giving an illusion of a slim and svelte waistline. Another point to watch out for, says Sunipa, is to tie the petticoat and sari at the correct position.

 You should not tie the sari way below the waistline. Instead of covering your paunch, it highlights it even more, she says. 

 In fact, the best place to tie the sari is on the waistline. Not only can you tighten the petticoat string comfortably, you also end up hiding any excess fat.

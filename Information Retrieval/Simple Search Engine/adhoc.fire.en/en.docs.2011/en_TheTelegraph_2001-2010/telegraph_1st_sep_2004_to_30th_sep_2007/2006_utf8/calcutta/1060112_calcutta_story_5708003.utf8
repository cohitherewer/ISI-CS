 Creative inspiration is often born in compassionate souls that care for the well being of humanity. A visual project of Forum 91, Creativity and Concern for Humanity, the ongoing exhibition of paintings, drawings and sculptures, represents the collective efforts of artists who genuinely wish to make a difference to other people?s lives. Featuring works of art that emphasise the importance of man?s archetypal relationship with nature, it also reminds us of our responsibility to preserve and nurture our natural environment. While paintings in bright, cheerful shades evoke joyful emotions, the sculptures express the need for universal peace and harmony. Participants: Satyendranath Banerjee, Gopal Ghose, Dhiraj Choudhury, Tarak Garai, Dwijen Gupta, Katayun Saklat, Damayanti Sharma and Tapan Mitra, among others.

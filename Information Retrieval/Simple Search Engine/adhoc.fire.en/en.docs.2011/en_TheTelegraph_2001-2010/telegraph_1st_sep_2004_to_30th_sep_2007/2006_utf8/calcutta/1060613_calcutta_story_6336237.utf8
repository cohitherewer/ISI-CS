 Support scheme for 5000 slum kids

 SAMARPAN DATTA

 A city-based NGO is opening a centre that will sponsor the education of 5,000 children living in city slums.

 Children aged between three and 19 years will come under the support scheme of the centre, being set up by Sahay, an organisation working for child development across the state for the past 30 years.

 ?We are carrying out a survey in and around Jorasanko to identify families living below the poverty line,? said Sahay director Niraj Agarwal. ?Our volunteers will obtain information on the families and then we will draw up a list based on the standard set for selection.?

 Sahay is affiliated to Children International, a non-profit humanitarian organisation based in Kansas City, Missouri, in the United States. ?We are now supporting around 20,000 children across the state. Once the Jorasanko centre becomes operational, we will add 5,000 more to the list.?

 The annual budget for supporting the 25,000-odd children is over Rs 200 crore. ?Educating the underprivileged has long been an issue that has troubled our society, but little attention has been paid to it,? said Sahay member Rangan Sengupta. 

 ?We not only sponsor the education of underprivileged children, but organise free health camps for them regularly and help them develop values. We also invite the children?s families to various programmes that stress the importance of maintaining a healthy ambience at home,? he added.

 Those who prove themselves to be leaders get a chance to represent the country at a youth conference at the Children International headquarters. The conference takes place every two years. ?The representatives, named by their friends, interact with children from across the globe,? Sengupta said.

 Yeasin Khan, 17, and Sunanda Kundu, 16, will attend the Kansas City event this year. ?Yeasin is from Mondolpara village, in Bankura, and lives in abject poverty. Sunanda, also a resident of Bankura, is the daughter of a daily-wager,? Sengupta added.

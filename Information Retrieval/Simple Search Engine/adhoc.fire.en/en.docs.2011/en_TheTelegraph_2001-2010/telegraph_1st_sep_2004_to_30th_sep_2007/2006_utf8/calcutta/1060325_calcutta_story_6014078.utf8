 Shakespeare?s secrets

 Bengali and Sinhalese, kathak and Bharatanatyam ? A Midsummer Night?s Dream takes on a dramatically different form this summer

 Moments from A 

 Midsummer Night?s Dream during rehearsals in the 

 countdown to the Delhi show 

 Demetrius confronting Helena in Sinhalese, Lysander professing his love for Hermia in Bengali, Oberon and Titania matching kathak steps or fairies staging a stylised stick fight ? Does this edition of A Midsummer Night?s Dream belong to Shakespeare, or is it truly from the Indian sub-continent?

 Both, insists Tim Supple, who is helming this ambitious multilingual project incorporating seven languages and spanning two years in the making.

 From 40-something Ashwatthama JD of Jana Natya Manch to nine-year-old acrobat Ram Kanwar, the acclaimed theatre director from Britain has gathered a bunch of actors and stage hands criss-crossing the length and breadth of India and Sri Lanka. His aim is to prove that language is no barrier on stage.

 A 20-minute edited highlight of A Midsummer Night?s Dream staged at the Indira Gandhi National Centre for Arts in Delhi on Thursday evening gave a glimpse of the first of its kind Indo-UK theatre production commissioned by the British Council. It is being mounted at an approximate cost of 200,000 pound.

 The play is set in the Indian context, using seven languages ? English, Hindi, Marathi, Malayalam, Tamil, Bengali and Sinhalese ? with 22 actors whom Supple has picked after extensive auditions in Delhi, Jaipur, Calcutta, Mumbai and Chennai. A list of 100 was whittled down to the final 22 after a rigorous workshop in Mumbai.

 The company rehearsed for two months at Veenapani Chawla?s Adishakti complex in Pondicherry where the performers trained in everything from Kalaripayattu to Bharatanatyam, stick fight to rope climbing on a nine-to-nine routine.

 ?You find the most surprising secrets in Shakespeare and we are trying to look deep into the play and touch those and reach them to the people? I am working with an extraordinary range of actors with different life experiences and tremendous individual skills,? says Supple.

 For the trio from Calcutta that made it to the final list after several rounds of tests, The Dream has truly been a dream come true. Says Kaushik Dutta, who plays guitar for Bangla band Saanko: ?There are more than 270 cues in this play and initially it seemed just impossible. But everything fell into place in the course of the rehearsals. I am playing four string instruments and percussion in the music scored by Australian composer Devisarro.?

 Tapan Das, who has been associated with Prabir Guha?s Alternative Living Theatre in Bengal for some time, has fetched the role of a fairy, while Joyraj Bhattacharya, a performer with theatre group Chetana, plays Francis Flute. The other Bengali in the team is Chandan Roy Sanyal, a Mumbai-based stage actor who is fleshing out one of the more crucial characters ? the love-struck Lysander.

 ?The inclusion of seven different languages in the script seemed a little difficult in the beginning since we had to retain the meaning of the lines and also the meter ? iambic pentameter in which Shakespeare wrote. But that was sorted out through trial and error,? says Chandan. 

 ?Shakespeare?s characters are never what they seem. I never liked Helena and thought she was a whimpering heroine, but now I find her so strong? It is because Shakespeare provokes actors to explore their characters,? says Shanaya Rafaat, who plays Helena and whom Calcutta had seen last summer in Pushan Kripalani?s The Maids.

 A Midsummer Night?s Dream premieres in Delhi in the first week of April and touches down in Calcutta for three shows (Aril 28, 29 and 30 at Tollygunge Club), after having travelled to Mumbai and Chennai.

 The most eagerly awaited stint of the tour, of course, is the one at Swan theatre in Stratford-on-Avon, where Tim Supple and gang goes to in mid-June for the Royal Shakespeare Company?s The Complete Works of Shakespeare Festival.

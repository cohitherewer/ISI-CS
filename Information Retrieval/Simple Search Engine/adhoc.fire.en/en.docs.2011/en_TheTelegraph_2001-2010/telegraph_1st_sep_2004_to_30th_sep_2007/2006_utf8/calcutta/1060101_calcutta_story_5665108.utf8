The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Heart beat, campus call

 Maidan: to be green...

 Health Plus

 If 2005 was a year of planning for the Left Front government, 2006 better be one of implementation. Health will remain a key thrust area where chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee would like to see changes happening, and happening fast.

 With elections barely months away, the CPM think-tank has already decided to retain Surjya Kanta Mishra as health minister and the party has cleared certain policy decisions for effecting a change in the primary, secondary and tertiary segments of state healthcare.

 A significant development is the decision to rope in Department for International Development to provide a grant of Rs 750 crore over five years to redo the state health sector.

 The Health Services Development Initiative, as the programme is known, would see funds being spent on a key area ? bringing down the mortality rate of children and women in Bengal. Part of the funds would also be spent on immunisation programmes and improving services in the state health sector.

 In keeping with the observations of the British funding agency, the state government has already transferred 161 senior doctors of the rank of medical officers and above from all major teaching hospitals in Calcutta.

 Two hundred-odd clerks, too, have been shifted from their posting at teaching hospitals to other institutions.

 For the first time, an order has been passed on setting up a hospital committee in all major institutions with the brief to bridge the gap between doctors and patients.

 The committee, with elected representatives including MLAs and MPs, will have a corpus fund. It will also be authorised to mop up money through donations to improve patient care in hospitals. 

 ?The state government appears to have rushed through with the order to ensure that the chief minister can carry the message to the masses in the election campaign,? said a senior officer of the health department.

 In the private sector, the keyword would be improved service. The Wockhardt Hospitals and Kidney Research Institute in the city has decided to revamp its services on the lines proposed by the US-based Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organisations. Besides, the hospital has decided to invest Rs 1 crore in equipment in the current year.

 ...or not to be green?

 The AMRI Hospitals, while adding to its pool of doctors, has decided to fly in experts from abroad for periodic evaluation of its clinical facilities. ?We will set up an ultrasonic aspirator costing around Rs 45 lakh for doctors to pinpoint brain cell and kidney tumours,? claims S.B. Purakayastha, president of the hospital. 

 Others will go in for major expansions. While CMRI aims to develop a tertiary eye hospital, BM Birla plans to start an air-ambulance service to lift patients from places like Haldia and Siliguri and rush them to emergency medicare.

 Health City, being built by Devi Shetty?s Asia Heart Foundation, will see two of its 10 speciality hospitals, the 500-bed cancer and neonatology units, up and running in 2006. 

 Rabindranath Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences will augment its services with gastroenterology and dental departments.

 The new St Xavier rsquo;s campus

 Education Aim

 The government will encourage new need-based and job-oriented courses in emerging areas of science and technology, like biotechnology, IT, molecular biology and biochemistry. Universities will be encouraged to increase industry-institute partnership in these areas.

 An information and communication technology institute is being planned by Reliance, probably at the education village to be set up in Kalyani. At least eight big institutions will be allotted land there. The idea is to convert Kalyani into an education hub. The most significant among the institutes that may set up campus in Kalyani include the central government-funded Indian Institute in Science Education and Research. 

 The West Bengal University of Technology and the Netaji Subhas Open University will be shifted to Kalyani from Calcutta. Plus, the two existing institutions, Kalyani University and Vidhan Chandra Krishi Vidyalaya, will be expanded.

 Indian Institute of Foreign Trade (IIFT) Delhi is poised to set up its first full-fledged branch outside the Capital in Calcutta. Coming up initially is a functional temporary address followed by the campus proper on a seven-acre plot.

 The RPG group has submitted a scheme for setting up a business school in Calcutta. The government is also considering the proposals of B.P. Poddar and the Techno India groups for setting up two private medical colleges ? in Calcutta and Howrah. 

 The city-based Shrachi group is keen on opening a college for girls offering new-age courses.

 Calcutta University will get funds worth Rs 100 crore from the state government and the Centre, and the World Bank. Bulk of the money will be spent on renovation of buildings, modernisation of labs and libraries. 

 If the Centre?s proposal to upgrade the status of Jadavpur University and Bengal Engineering and Science University, Shibpur, to that of the IITs is accepted, the two institutions will get an additional Rs 2,000 crore by March 2006.

 The Church of North India will open branches of schools like St James, Pratt Memorial and La Martiniere in Rajarhat.

 St Xavier?s College Calcutta plans to mark its 150th year in style, by unveiling a sprawling new-age campus off EM Bypass in 2010. Work on the second campus is set to kick-off in the middle of this year. 

 A fair distance from the Park Street landmark founded in 1860, it is being touted as a global centre of excellence for higher learning. 

 Spread over 17 bighas, the second campus will, for starters, play host to postgraduate programmes in management, media studies, bio-sciences and information technology. Expected to cost around Rs 60 crore, the campus will have infrastructure for tomorrow.

 SSKM Hospital: foreign funds boost to state health sector

 Environment Appeal 

 Clean air to breathe and a patch of green to enjoy that much-needed breather. Will these seemingly simple demands of Calcuttans be met in 2006?

 That will depend entirely on whether the government is finally able to take a stand on environment issues in election year.

 If the auto-emission deadlines are maintained, the year will begin with the phasing out of taxis and autos, buses and minibuses. If clean-air rules are followed, nearly a lakh vehicles would be grounded.

 But if the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government?s poor record in enforcing the norms and the go-slow in creating infrastructure for the process are any indication, Calcuttans better brace for another year of poison fumes.

 Wetlands is the other focal point when it comes to greens and the city. The government has, recently, issued an ordinance and formed an authority to save the Ramsar-designated East Calcutta Wetlands. 

 Setting up a multi-crore wetlands interpretation centre is also supposed to be a top priority in 2006, even as unauthorised constructions continue to dot the restricted area.

 Calcutta High Court had recently ordered demolition of two such constructions. A special officer, appointed by the court to carry out the order, takes charge on January 1.

 There may be more bad news for the Maidan in 2006. With fairs falling foul (post another ?last? Book Fair on the grounds, of course) of its custodians, but the greens remaining fair ground for political rallies and public meetings, the mauling of the Maidan cholchhe, cholbe. Unless, of course, the courts step in and save the city?s lungs.

 Environmentalists will be looking out for the government actually enforcing the blanket ban on plastic, according to promises made by both the chief minister and the environment minister recently.

 That includes production, storage, transport and use of all kind of plastic carrybags ? not just those below 20 microns as per the Centre?s rule ? in the Calcutta Metropolitan Area and some other parts of the state.

 Noise pollution and disposal of solid waste are some of the other issues in the spotlight.

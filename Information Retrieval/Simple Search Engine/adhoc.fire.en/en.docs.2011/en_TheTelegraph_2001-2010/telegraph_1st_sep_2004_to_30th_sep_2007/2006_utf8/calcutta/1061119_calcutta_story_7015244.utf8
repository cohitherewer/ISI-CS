The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Game of the name

 Bengalis are exploring a whole new world of novel nomenclature, from the brief to the bizarre

 His ineffable effable/Effanineffable/Deep and inscrutable singular name. The Naming of Cats, Old Possums Book of Practical Cats, T.S. Eliot.

 The hunt began five months before the event. When Gargi was pregnant with her first child four years ago, the family left no stone or website unturned for a name. It must be a short, handy name that would not burden its owner. It must cause no inconvenience abroad (the parents were in Australia then). It must have a contemporary ring. Yet, it must be traditional. 

 Every day my sister would search sites on the Net, make a list and mail it to us. We also talked about it on the phone over the weekend, says Ratnabali Bhattacharjee, Gargis sister. The family members looked up three or four baby-name books, thought of favourite characters from storybooks and of people they were fond of. Every evening we sat and discussed which names were nice and which were not. We drew up a shortlist, but it was still pretty long, remembers Ratnabali.

 Finally, the day before the birth, the family landed on the name: Oormi. You cant go wrong with Oormi, says Ratnabali. Having suffered long names we decided to keep it short, especially as she lived abroad and we did not want her to go through the trouble of correcting people all the time, adds Ratnabali. Oormi means a wave; my niece is a Piscean...

 The couple went through the same process before their son was born a year later. This time an astrologer told them the name had to start with a D and they settled on Dhruv. (Oormis name was changed from Urmi, too, on the advice of an astrologer.)

 Naming a baby is no longer simple. Gone are the days when Thakurda carelessly named the child Arun or Amitkanti or Ashok. Naming is now a matter of much thinking, strategy and aesthetics. The babys name, for contemporary urban couples, is the first personal ID to effect a smooth entry into the highly competitive, globalised world ahead.

 Starting point 

 A popular source for names today is not gods and goddesses, nor the family, but the Internet, where websites and links like www.iloveindia.com/babynames, www.matrimonialbank.com/babynames.html or www.indiaparenting.com thrive. There are 9,810,000 hits for Indian names in 0.23 seconds (1,200,000 for Bengali names) on Google.

 Baby-name book sales are on the rise and the most wanted is Hindu Names by Maneka Gandhi. There has been an increase in the demand, mostly from people who dont have access to the Internet, says a sales executive at the Oxford Bookstore.

 Be different

 The most important reason is that parents want their childrens names to be different from others, says lexicographer Ashoke Mukhopadhyay. The trend has changed drastically, especially among middle-class Bengalis. Names like Priyamvada and Mrinalini are coming back now. 

 The trend seems to pull in two directions. One set of parents would like short, sweet, easy, universal-Indian names, like Oormi, Neha, Rahul or Abhishek. Or Snehil. Says Shikha Raghav, mother of 13-year-old Snehil: It means affectionate and this is the name that came to our minds after he was born. Moreover, we needed something different to stand out.

 The other set of parents would look for imaginative, unique, traditional or traditional-sounding Indian names in keeping with a new trendiness. Names like Priyamvada or Mrinalini or Sarbajaya or Saimantika or Katyayani, all of which are not required to be etymologically correct and which would easily turn into the Anglicised abbreviations of Pri or Mri or Sam or Katy in the peer group.

 Tanish Mitras name was found this way. The one-and-a-half-year-olds parents searched the Net and the books for babies names and consulted relatives. At last a relative found the name from a name book, says Subrata Mitra, Tanishs father. Sukanya, Tanishs elder sister, was supposed to be named Sannanti or Sanasthita (names from the Upanishads). But the idea was dropped as the parents thought they would be too tough for the child to spell or even pronounce.

 Pranaadhika Sinha, director, operations, Opus Global Suggestions, is proud of her name. It comes from a poem written by her fathers aunt. In Tripura, we have a tradition of feminine names ending with ka. My name is also quite unusual. We were looking for a name and I suddenly came across Pranaadhika. It sounded beautiful and unusual, explains mother Kirtika.

 Star struck

 Lexicographer Mukhopadhyay also points out the influence of numerology, famous personalities and movie stars. The right name will bring luck. So, the practice of consulting an astrologer or numerologist before naming a child has gone up. Some parents go with the kundali and ask what the first letter of the name should be. Others choose the name and then ask the numerologist to juggle the letters for the lucky number.

 The pandit told us to give a name starting with V to our daughter. We hit the Internet to search for something that had a nice meaning and was easy to pronounce. We settled for Vandita, says Poushali Mittal, mother of the four-year-old.

 The earthly stars exercise their own influence. After hundreds of Amartyas and Souravs, it is not uncommon now to find toddler Aishwaryas growing up all over Calcutta. There is even a trend to name children after popular TV serial characters, from Aditya to Laksh.

 The alphabetical order is also crucial. Many parents prefer the first letters of the alphabet, to give their children the first-called advantage in school, college and possibly at interviews. So Aryaman will score over Biman as a new-age name as well as its positional advantage on the roster.

 Paperwork is another consideration. We named our son Srayan, which apart from being uncommon and having a nice meaning (support), is also short. We went for a short name because it would be easier to write and long names dont always fit into the numerous forms we have to fill throughout our lives, laughs Debjani Bhattacharya, mother of the three-year-old.

 Blame it on globalisation: certain neutral names have suddenly gained currency. The name Neel, for example. There are so many Neels around and their names do equally well in any culture, Bangali or Phirang.

 But ultimately it is the spirit of reckless adventure of the parents that leads to certain names. Calcutta always had its share of the extraordinary names like Shyamsohagini Emily Ranee Ghose, or Neelakasheektitara Das, or brothers Lenin, Stalin and Bulganin Roy or sisters Shyamalimaya, Bitapichhaya and Atasikaya.

 Some contemporary names can give them close competition. My grandfather gave me the name and it is a derivative of the English bowler Derek Pringle, admits Pincle Nandi, 23, an MBA student. His name makes him the centre of attraction.

 Gauresh Mehra, presumably a naming expert, sums it up on the Net: A rare name is like a coat made out of the finest material. Envied by those who dont have it. Worn with pride and confidence by those who do. A rare name surprises you, makes you exclaim that I have never heard this name before! What does it mean?

 Indeed.

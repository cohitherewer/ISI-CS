 WHY DONT THE BOLLYWOOD 

 HUNKS TURN US ON ANY MORE, WONDERS CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA. 

 THE ANSWER, SHE FEELS, LIES IN HEALTH DRINKS 

 Throughout history, whenever the 

 ratio of the height to the width of a rectangle has been 

 equal to 1.61803398874989484820, or 1.618 in short, the 

 effect has been pleasing. The number is called phi, after 

 the Greek sculptor Phidias. It is also called the Golden 

 Ratio and is the formula of beauty.

 The greatest works of art are 

 built on the ratio of phi. Many claim that if a rectangle 

 is drawn around the face of Mona Lisa (which one wouldnt 

 under ordinary circumstances), the ratio of the height to 

 the width of that rectangle will be the Golden Ratio.

 The exterior dimensions of the 

 Parthenon in Athens form a perfect Golden Rectangle. The 

 pyramids dimensions too. Even Salvador Dali is said 

 to have based the measurements of his painting Sacrament 

 of the Last Supper on the Golden Ratio.

 An American professor who else 

 would be up to the task? applied the Golden Ratio to determine 

 the origin of facial attractiveness of live human beings. 

 It was found that the distance from the chin to the eyebrows 

 on the attractive faces divided the face in a Golden Ratio, 

 whatever that means.

 Now theres nothing to suggest 

 that Leonardo Da Vinci consciously used the Golden Ratio 

 in Mona Lisas composition. But when God made Hrithik 

 Roshan, he certainly did. 

 Look at the man. He is composed 

 entirely of Golden Ratios. If you divide his forehead by 

 his chin, I am sure the result is 1.618. If you divide his 

 chest by his hip, it is 1.618. If you divide his hip by 

 his waist, it is 1.618. If you divide his upper thigh by 

 his lower thigh, the result is 1.618. If you divide his 

 nose by his nostril, the result is 1.618. If you divide 

 his lower body by his upper body, the result is still 1.618. 

 He is a paragon of male beauty, perfection itself, the golden 

 hunk. 

 Why the hell then doesnt 

 he turn me on? 

 I, a mature woman, 

 have thought long and hard about it and come to a disturbing 

 conclusion. Bollywoods biggest hunks are little boys. 

 They dont like women. They are only out to bond with 

 other children.

 Why else would Hrithik in Krrish 

 be fixated on Bournvita? Every time he comes back panting 

 to his granny from one of his innocent escapades overtaking 

 the horse, flying, scaring people sweetly he drinks Bournvita. 

 When the little boy who is always with him his alter ego, 

 of course comes visiting, Hrithik holds forth on the life-affirming 

 qualities of Bournvita, and asks the boy to, what else, 

 have a drink of Bournvita. His dining room always displays 

 a jar of Bournvita. The drink that a growing child needs 

 is Bournvita.

 Hrithik Roshan is Bournvita.

 Now which woman in her right mind 

 would prefer a health drink to a real man? But does Hrithik 

 care?

 It wouldnt even matter if 

 Priyanka Chopra wasnt really there as the love interest 

 in his life. But you cant take away his love for Bournvita. 

 Or the kids out of his film. Or the kids who are his fans 

 outside his films. In Koi... Mil Gaya, he even acted 

 as a kid.

 Its the same with John Abraham. 

 He is so perfect that you feel that even the Golden Ratio 

 in its abbreviated form is not enough to describe him 

 you need to go into all the decimals. 

 A childrens channel did 

 a survey, which said that it is with kids that our John 

 is most popular. He is now the brand ambassador of that 

 channel.

 The hunks, even in Bollywood, 

 were not like this always. Remember Amitabh Bachchan in 

 Salaam-e-Ishq and Rekha getting hit? The dangerous 

 gleam in his eyes? Sanjay Dutt, Salman Khan or Akshay Kumar 

 had their moments, too, though they are all ageing now.

 But then the world had not gone 

 cute. Now there are too many children buying too many soft 

 toys, soft drinks, Superman dolls, Krrish masks. 

 You cant ignore the young consumers. They are more 

 important than women. 

 A more disturbing thought is that 

 now perhaps women like their hunks that way. Then they would 

 fit in perfectly in the soft toy world. That makes you wonder 

 about the index of development and the female psyche. Hrithik 

 and John really have no choice.

 So my fear is that the way things 

 are going, hunks will become more and more like the dolls 

 that they inspire. That is, they will be as featureless 

 underneath their clothes as a Superman doll is.

 Its a terrible prospect 

 for women (and some men, too). My only hope is Shiney Ahuja.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

When the economy is moving towards decentralisation, 

the trend cannot be reversed in education. If a college has the credentials, the 

infrastructure and can provide the basic services, there is no harm in granting 

it autonomy. I had fought for St Xavier?s College to be granted that status. But 

I would add a rider. The autonomy move will bear fruit only within the rubric 

of a guiding role for the parent body. Otherwise, there will not be equity in 

matters like fee structure and social security for employees. Teachers in other 

parts of India have suffered this way. Liberty is not laissez-faire.

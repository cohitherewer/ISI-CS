 This January, Prinsep Ghat will emerge as a playground for performing arts. 

 On January 5 and 6, Pandit Birju Maharaj and Priti Patels troupe Anjika will feature in a show on the riverfront on the theme life as a game. The dancers will use traditional disciplines to interpret games.

 It is difficult to arrange such programmes. Setting up the stage and lights are troublesome. The dancers are the best in the country, so we have a budget of Rs 6 lakh. The twin goals are promotion of traditional dance forms and projection of heritage buildings as things to cherish and protect, said G.M. Kapur of INTACH, which is organising the show.

 We hope to make this an annual event and add music and theatre performances. We are thinking about flying in foreign troupes from next year. Maybe, we can start an annual programme at Prinsep Ghat, on the lines of the Khajuraho or Konark dance festivals, he added. 

 INTACH, which works for restoration and preservation of heritage structures, will ensure that erection of the stage for the programme does not harm Prinsep Ghat.

 The pillars will lend a unique feel to our presentation. After all, Indian dances are not meant for the stage. They were performed in durbars and temples. I find stages really boring, remarked Priti Patel.

 Entry to the show, to be inaugurated by Governor Gopal Krishna Gandhi, will be by invitation only. Birju Maharaj will be felicitated at the show.

 Patel said: Birju Maharaj will decide what game to address and how to interpret it. I have chosen the Game of Dice. 

 Using the dice-throwing sequence of Mahabharata, Patel will offer a picture of contemporary Manipur. I dont think dance can or should remain indifferent to the present. My message is that after chaos, there should be peace. The choreography combines the vigorous Thangta and graceful Rasleela techniques of Manipuri dance. Inspiration has also come from indigenous Manipuri games. 

 The dancer rued that there are no institutions like Sangeet Research Academy for dance. There is scope for much research and experimentation and we have so many heritage spaces, she observed.

 Malini Thadani, head of public affairs, HSBC Mumbai, sponsor of the show, told Metro: We hope the event will help raise awareness about conservation of heritage places, which are a part of the environment. We want the festival to make Calcuttans proud of their heritage.

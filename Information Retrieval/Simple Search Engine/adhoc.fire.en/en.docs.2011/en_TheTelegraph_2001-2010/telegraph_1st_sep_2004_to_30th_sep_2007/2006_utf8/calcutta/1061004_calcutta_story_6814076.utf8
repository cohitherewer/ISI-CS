 Glimpses of Winter 

 Magic, a show launching Hidesigns fall-winter 

 collection in Pondicherry 

 What: Winter Magic, a show 

 launching Hidesigns fall-winter collection.

 Where: The Promenade in 

 Pondicherry. 

 When: September 26, 8 pm 

 onwards. 

 The show: The ramp stretched 

 from one end of The Promenade to another, beginning by the 

 poolside and extending well into the hotel interiors. 

 The Bay of Bengal breeze and the 

 sound of crashing waves formed the perfect background score.

 The stage was set for Winter Magic 

 as it kickstarted with a burst of modern dance, showcasing 

 the labels latest lines.

 First up were men in black and 

 the bags they wore. 

 The collection showed a wide variety, 

 anything but boring and flat black designs.

 Borrowing heavily in detail from 

 their women counterparts, the pieces were characterised 

 by heavy zippers, chunky buckles and raised surfaces.

 The styles comprised not-so-regular 

 laptop cases, cross-body bags (both regular and body hugging), 

 sleek document carriers and interesting carry-ons.

 The ladies came next and the trend 

 for their bags reiterated summer 2006 styles the bigger 

 the better. 

 These bags were almost tote-shaped, 

 large enough to hold a laptop with ease. The party bags 

 were not tiny either, with the only element breaking the 

 trend being the shorter grab handles.

 The colours for her were very 

 spring-summer, too. Lots of white and a lot more corals. 

 Some eclectic pieces in turquoise were sudden surprises, 

 while for men browns ruled. 

 The leather story revolved around 

 suede, croco (crocodile finish), punched, and 

 a variety of heavy natural grains.

 The story extended beyond bags. 

 Winter Magic showcased a range of jackets for men and women. 

 Washed, scrubbed, worn-out and 

 dip-dyed, these pieces were cut in various silhouettes and 

 styles. Sporty jackets to formal, blazer-like ones, the 

 lengths varied from short to mid-calf.

 The show was choreographed by 

 Meetu and Meenu and the highlight of the sequences was definitely 

 the infusion of modern dance. Choreographed by Delhi-based 

 Briar Chatterjee, the idea behind her creative input was 

 simple As if you have fallen in love with your bag. 

 The models sashayed down in designer 

 outfits by Anju Modi, Rohit Gandhi and Rahul Khanna. 

 Ramp scorchers: The model 

 mix from Mumbai, Delhi and Bangalore saw familiar faces 

 like Muzammil Ibrahim, Rajneesh Duggal, Amarpreet Wahi and 

 Devdutta Banerjee walking the ramp along with others.

 After-party: Post-show, 

 the party venue shifted from one Hidesign property to another. 

 Friends, family, crew and models marched across to Le Dupleix, 

 a heritage hotel located in the heart of the French Quarter. 

 (The hotel used to be the house of French General and Governor, 

 Marquis Joseph Francois Dupleix.)

 Aroma candles, exotic blooms and 

 a five-course sit-down dinner The party was all this and 

 more.

 Voiceover: This year 

 is huge for Hidesign. We are going to be available in Shanghai, 

 Johannesburg and Abu Dhabi and are also expanding in existing 

 markets like Russia and Dubai. This apart from positioning 

 ourselves as a mass luxury brand abroad and in India, 

 said Dilip Kapur, president of Hidesign.

 New housewife: Felicity 

 Huffman as Bree in Transamerica 

 For most actresses it would be the culmination of their dreams: a hectic round of awards shows, film festivals and personal appearances, all the time besieged by cameras and interviewers. But for Felicity Huffman the red-carpet demands are becoming a problem. ?I always feel like someone?s going to come up and say, ?Who the hell do you think you are? You?re not pretty or glamorous or thin?.?

 For more than 20 years, the Desperate Housewives star has been known as a ?working actor? ? not a star but a reliable supporting actress whose face is vaguely familiar. Now, with an Emmy award under her belt, a Golden Globe for her first leading role in a film and an Oscar nomination, she is suddenly one of the hottest ladies in Hollywood.

 Normally a private person who likes to keep a low profile, she finds all the attention she has been getting for her disparate roles ? a working wife and mother on Desperate Housewives and a man having a sex-change operation in Transamerica ? a bit overwhelming.

 ?Nobody has ever been this interested in me before and probably never will be again,? she says. ?People ask me what my favourite red-carpet moment is, but they might as well ask about my favourite root canal moment. As a matter of fact, my favourite moment comes at the end of the red carpet when I take off my $500 shoes and put on the little plastic sandals I keep in my bag.?

 Huffman, 43, was talking backstage at the Golden Globe awards, having successfully negotiated yet another red carpet and picked up the Best Actress trophy for her role in the low-budget Transamerica as Bree, a pre-op transsexual man who discovers that he?s the father of a teenage son. For his psychologist to approve the final surgery, he must meet and get to know the young man, who has a complicated life of his own. 

 Her performance as the self-conscious and self-obsessed Bree has won rave reviews, as well as multiple awards and nominations. ?I?ve never been a beauty,? she says matter-of-factly. ?So playing a man wasn?t a problem for me.?

 Ironically, even after she landed the part, Huffman did not want to tackle it. She feared she would not be capable of it and tried to persuade first-time writer and director Duncan Tucker to recast it with someone else. ?Essentially, it was fear. I thought I would fail,? she says. ?In the end, Duncan persuaded me, and I did it anyway. But I was frightened every single day.?

 Now, she says, ?I am proud of Transamerica. I really am. There are moments where I go, ?Oh God, I should be shot?, but for the most part I?m proud.? It is the sort of role that Oscar voters love, but Huffman is not one to allow the talk and publicity that is surrounding her to go to her head. 

 ?This has been a great year, a fantastic year,? she said. ?But I am very aware of the shelf-life of the spotlight. There have been so many times people have said to me after I?ve done some project, ?Oh, now you?re going to take off.? And then I didn?t work for a year. If I start feeling I?m anointed, all I have to do is remember how many times I?ve been fired.?

 It wasn?t easy becoming Bree, though. ?First, I had to understand the internal journey,? recalls Huffman. ?I had to figure out who Bree was and where she was going internally, which was to become who she really is. She was starting from a place of extreme self-consciousness and self-loathing.

 ?Then I worked on the externals, which were tough. I met a lot of transgender women, I went to conventions, I read every book and autobiography I could find and I was coached by a woman who coaches men who become women later in life, so I sort of cobbled Bree together.?

 She worked for days with a New York voice coach to deepen her voice. During filming she stuck with the voice off-camera, too. ?To tell you the truth, when I got the voice, that was the key,? she says. ?It took me a long time to put all the elements of her together ? the voice, the walk and the emotional life. I warmed up to get in the right zone as Bree for two hours every morning before I showed up in front of the camera. It was helpful to have Bree?s clothes, nails, underwear, wig and make-up.?

 It was also helpful to have a prosthetic penis she nicknamed Andy. ?When we started shooting I realised there was something missing so I sent my assistant to one of those sex shops where they have prosthetics for guys for their bathing suits. He brought back a medium-sized one and we immediately started calling it Andy. Andy became part of my costume because it actually informed my performance. I wore Andy throughout the movie.?

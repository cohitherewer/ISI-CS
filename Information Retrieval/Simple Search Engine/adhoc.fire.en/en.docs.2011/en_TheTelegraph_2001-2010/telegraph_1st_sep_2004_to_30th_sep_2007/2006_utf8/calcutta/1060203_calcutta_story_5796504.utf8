 Trader trail throws up no leads

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Four days have elapsed since he went missing, but the police and family members are still in the dark about the fate of 45-year-old timber trader Raj Kumar Seksaria.

 ?The situation is the same as it was on the day of his disappearance,? said Raj?s brother Mohanlal. ?We have no idea where or how he is. We have not received a phone call since Monday, the day he disappeared. Police are visiting our house every day, but have failed to make any headway.? 

 Superintendent of North 24-Parganas police Praveen Kumar said: ?Right now, we are not in a position to say that the trader has been abducted, as his family has not received any ransom call. My officers are probing every possible aspect. A Topsia-based client has confirmed that Raj met him on Monday, but we have no clue what happened thereafter.?

 A section of police officers, however, is not ruling out the involvement of a big-ticket gang in the disappearance of the merchant, a resident of Salt Lake. 

 ?Such gangs never call up the hostage?s family immediately after the abduction. They wait for three or four days, or even a week. It?s part of their tactics to build up pressure on the family members, so they agree to cough up a hefty amount as ransom,? said an officer working on the case.

 An officer of Bidhannagar (East) police station admitted that the sleuths would have come across a lead, had the family received a ransom call.

 ?We are now clueless. As Raj does not use a cellphone, we cannot ascertain the places he visited after leaving his DL Block apartment on Monday afternoon,? he pointed out.

 Police are also trying to find out whether any dispute, related to business or family, had led to his disappearance.

 ?We are talking to family members to gather an idea of his clients. But we drew a blank, as Raj did not disclose his business dealings to his family. We are also trying to find out whether any family dispute had forced him to leave home,? said an officer.

 Back in the Salt Lake apartment, every moment now is a test of patience for Raj?s wife and two daughters, one in her 20s and the other 14 years old, who are waiting eagerly for any news of him. 

 ?He left home around 2.30 in the afternoon, after taking a shower and lunch. He said he would go to Topsia and then to Ultadanga,? said wife Ritu.

 In Topsia, he was scheduled to meet a client who owed him money. The family searched for him throughout Monday night and lodged a missing diary the next morning.

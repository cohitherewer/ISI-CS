 Laxity taxes town fathers of crores

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 The Howrah Municipal Corporation?s (HMC) failure to keep track of the construction and occupancy of 165 multi-storeyed buildings in the town has led to property tax revenue loss of more than Rs 46 crore.

 The Assembly?s public accounts committee made this revelation in a report tabled in the House on Wednesday.

 After presenting the report, committee chairman Saugata Roy said: ?The HMC had shown severe negligence in respect of keeping a watch over construction, completion and occupancy of the highrises. The records of the buildings had not been properly maintained.?

 The standing committee?s observations are based on the Comptroller and Auditor-General?s 1999-2000 report. 

 It has been found that the HMC sanctioned the construction of 165 multi-storeyed buildings in the town. Of them, only 29 were shown to have been completed between 1988 and 1993.

 According to the report, the HMC was not aware of the status of construction and occupancy of the 136 buildings and it could not trace the construction completion certificates. 

 As per building rules, occupancy is not allowed in a building that doesn?t have a construction completion certificate. However, the HMC didn?t prevent occupancy of the buildings, even when there were no such certificates. 

 The HMC also failed to update the status of the buildings, allowing the owners to evade property tax. This led to a revenue loss of Rs 46.27 crore, the public accounts committee report states.

 The committee has observed that the HMC?s special officer (revenue) had insisted on recovery of tax from the builders/occupiers. 

 However, this was not done as the HMC had not formed a review committee.

 When the standing committee asked for details, the HMC authorities conceded the lapse and informed them that of the 136 buildings, nine were in the added area and would be assessed during general revision. Sixty-three of the remaining 127 buildings had been completed, occupied and assessed later. 

 The HMC authorities also told the public accounts committee that the occupancy of a building would be allowed only after submission of the completion certificate by the occupier and receipt of the occupancy certificate by the municipality. ?This has been made mandatory in respect of buildings whose construction had been sanctioned after April 1, 2004,? the authorities told the committee.

 The committee chairman said he is going to wait for a few months to find out whether the recommendations are being implemented or not. ?If they are not being implemented, we will have to pull up the municipal affairs department,? Roy stated.

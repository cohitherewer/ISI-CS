 Drive for disability awareness

 - Parents? 

 association heads to take part in workshop 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Don?t hide your child. If you want your child to be part of the mainstream, attend public functions, like film shows and plays, with him. 

 This is one of the suggestions J.P. Gadkari will give parents of special children at a workshop organised by his NGO, Parivaar, at Roop Kala Kendra from June 22 to 24. It has been conceived to enable the parents to spread awareness about disabilities and interact with media in a way that will prove beneficial to special people. 

 Leaders of parents? associations from all over the country will take part in the workshop. 

 ?There are some 200 such associations in the country. The first association was started in Mumbai in 1968. As many as 150 of these associations are now a part of Parivaar, which began in 1995 as a national federation upholding the cause of such units, applying for grants and fighting for the rights of the disabled,? said Gadkari, president of the Bangalore-based organisation.

 Father of a mentally-challenged child, Gadkari feels strongly about the need to spread awareness about disabilities among parents and media persons. His long association with the media has proved useful.

 ?There still are parents who believe that a challenged child is the result of sins committed in past lives. Social acceptance is another problem ? parents of healthy children often hesitate to allow their wards to interact with challenged children. The media should learn that ?mentally ill? is not the same thing as ?mentally retarded?. You can cure a disease, but not retardation,? he stressed.

 ?It?s high time people realised that there are different grades of retardation, from borderline cases to those with profound and severe behavioural problems. The mentally disabled are not ?useless?, as most people believe. With the right kind of training and assistance, they can contribute to society. Sheltered work areas (where they will not be disturbed or teased by colleagues) can help people with profound and severe disabilities to prove what they are capable of, as they have done in Bangalore and other places. I know of disabled youngsters who work as lift operators, make 3D models and candles and even do a bit of journalism,? added Gadkari.

 A.V. Iyengar of Inclusion International, which is supporting the workshop, said: ?We know of 200,000 parents of disabled children and that is just the surface. In many villages, parents are not even aware that their children are mentally retarded.?

 Of the 10 parents? associations from Bengal affiliated to Parivaar, representatives of three will participate in the workshops ? Behala Bodhayan, Mentaid and Partner of Hooghly. The parents will also get the opportunity to test themselves in front of camera and media representatives on June 23.

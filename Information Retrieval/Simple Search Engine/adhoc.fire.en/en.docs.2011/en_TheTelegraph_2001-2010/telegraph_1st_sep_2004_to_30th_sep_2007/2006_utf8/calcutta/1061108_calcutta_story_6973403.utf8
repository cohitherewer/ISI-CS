How Bond goes Green

Screen On amp; Off

 License to thrill: Eva 

 Green and Daniel Craig

 Vesper is not the classic Bond girl, wearing a bikini and firing guns, says French actress Eva Green who plays the alluring and enigmatic beauty who steals the heart of the seemingly impermeable 007 in Casino Royale, releasing worldwide next Friday. 

 The relationship between Vesper and Bond is the spine of the story, and we needed an actress who could hold her own against Bond, says director Martin Campbell . Eva has all the qualities we were after: shes a terrific actress, shes gorgeous and she has an air of mystery about her.

 The Parisian-born Green, who made her film debut in Bernardo Bertoluccis The Dreamers, says: Its one of the best scripts Ive read in a long time. Its deep, with lots of twists and turns, and the love story moved me. Vesper is a complex person. She is full of secrets and I think that is why James Bond is attracted to her because he cant really see through her. She has many layers shes sharp, sassy, quick-witted, but also vulnerable. 

 Hypnotic and magnetic are the words Green uses to describe her co-star Craig. He is sexy and not self-conscious. I definitely feel theres chemistry between us on screen.

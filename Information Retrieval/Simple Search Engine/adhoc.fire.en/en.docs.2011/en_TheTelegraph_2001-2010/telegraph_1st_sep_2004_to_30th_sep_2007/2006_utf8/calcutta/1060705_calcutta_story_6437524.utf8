The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Travel scam duo in cop net

 A STAFF REPORTER

 After being on the run for days, travel scam accused Pannalal Mitra and son Indranil fell into the police net early on Tuesday, even as victims kept trickling in at the city police headquarters to lodge complaints about how they had been cheated of lakhs by the duo.

 Hours after Indranil was arrested in Mumbai ? he was taken into custody as soon as he landed there en route from London ? a Zurich-based travel agency moved a Calcutta court, seeking criminal proceedings against him. 

 Agency officials alleged that Indranil ? owner of travel agency Endeavour Holidays ? had cheated them of Rs 26.34 lakh by producing forged bank documents.

 The chief metropolitan magistrate allowed the petition and directed the city police to probe the charges.

 Pannalal was arrested in the morning after several rounds of interrogation. He had left the city for Venice on June 26, two days before Indranil had slipped out. Both, police claim, had conspired to script one of the biggest travel frauds in recent times.

 ?The father has been arrested, as we have found conclusive evidence of his involvement in his son?s activities,? said Gyanwant Singh, deputy commissioner (detective department). ?We have also received separate complaints from victims who have held Pannalal responsible for leaving them in the lurch in Venice,? Singh added.

 Among Indranil?s alleged victims were 32 football lovers, who had paid Rs 1.5 lakh each to catch the World Cup matches live in Germany. They include football coach Amal Dutta and Mohun Bagan secretary Anjan Mitra.

 Four members of the Cup group returned to the city 48 hours after they had landed in Frankfurt.

 The hunt for Indranil began on Sunday, soon after Pannalal returned to the city from London. The detective department came to know about his arrival late on Monday and picked him up for interrogation, that continued for hours.

 ?Late on Monday, we visited the office of the travel agency and examined several key documents. That gave us an idea about the functioning of Endeavour and also the role played by the father-son duo,? said a senior officer of the detective department.

 On Tuesday, Pannalal was produced before a city court that remanded him in police custody.

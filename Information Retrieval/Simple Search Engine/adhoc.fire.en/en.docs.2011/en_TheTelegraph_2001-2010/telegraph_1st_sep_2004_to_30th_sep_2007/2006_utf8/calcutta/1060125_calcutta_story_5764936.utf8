The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Back in the club

 Action replay: Rahul Dev in Fight Club

You last saw him hosting a gaming show on TV but Rahul Dev dubs it ?a one-off thing?. The model-turned-actor, who shone as the bad guy in Champion, is back on the big screen with a host of releases, starting with Fight Club this February. 

 ?Doing Games Bond was like doing an advertisement,? he tells Metro. ?It was an eight-day job and I did it just for the fun of it. It has always been movies for me and I haven?t even taken up modelling assignments because I don?t get time after doing films.?

 Fight Club has Rahul playing a bad guy who has a humane side to him. ?My character of Sandy is grey,? he says. ?He is working on the wrong side of the law but is not that bad inside. In fact, in the second half of the film, he goes totally black to defend his younger brother (Ashmit Patel).?

 Ask Rahul about the off-screen ties on the sets and he can?t stop talking about them. ?There was a huge male bonding which used to come alive during the lunch break,? he reveals. ?Come on, you have so many of us ? Ashmit, Suniel Shetty, Riteish, Sohail Khan, Dino Morea, Zayed Khan, Ashish Chaudhry, Yash Tonk ? together all the time. It was like going back to our childhood days.?

 But isn?t there a chance of going unnoticed in such a multistarrer setup? ?See, there are 12 actors in the film and if you count Kulbhushan Kharbanda, there?s 13. When you have an 80-page screenplay and so many actors, it?s obvious that not everyone has lots of scenes. Everyone?s done the movie for our friend Sohail, who?s the producer of the film and director Vikram Chopra, who?s making his debut. But yes, I do have 10 scenes in the movie.?

 Returning to the big screen after quite some time, Rahul is optimistic about Fight Club. ?It?s not a deep film,? he says. ?It?s a hardcore commercial film and it?s good clean entertainment. And it?s also not a guy film and is aimed at family audiences. In fact, there?s a message at the end of it all and that is not to get into a fight.?

 After Fight Club, Rahul has Anees Bazmee?s Benaam to look forward to, where he plays a ?black character? alongside Ajay Devgan and Sameera Reddy. Next, he?s slated to start shooting for Mani Shankar?s new film starring Sammir Dattani and Om Puri. Rahul has also committed to the debut project of director duo Glenn-Ankush. ?I will get to play a white character in that one,? he promises.

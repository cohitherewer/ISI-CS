 The Corporate 

 Goodlife Talk Show

 GoodLife Talk Show at ABN Amro Bank on Thursday. Pictures

 On Thursday evening, busy bankers 

 at the Trinity Tower, ABN Amro Bank (83 Topsia Road, South) 

 were not discussing investments, interests or home loans. 

 Instead, 115 of them were busy lapping up the finer points 

 of playing perfect party hosts at The Corporate GoodLife 

 Talk Show.

 The topic for the day Weekend 

 Parties and Party Tips found men and women hurling questions 

 that ranged from mixing drinks to managing home bars, getting 

 the guest-list right to handling passes.

 Moderated by Rita Bhimani, the 

 one-hour show kicked off with the public relations veteran 

 stressing how home parties are best enjoyed when not 

 only the beverages blend perfectly, but people blend well 

 with each other too.

 Mixologist Irfan took over from 

 there. Keep the right age group in mind, he 

 said, before touching upon the ways in which a drink was 

 best enjoyed. The bar guru recommended whisky with a splash 

 of water rather than soda (The purer the water, the 

 better).

 The discussion vaulted a gender 

 divide when Rita asked: Why do women always prefer 

 drinks like vodka? Is it a trick to hide what they are sipping 

 on? Pat came the reply from Irfan: All that 

 is passe. A lot of women today enjoy good whisky Gone are 

 the days when they would tell their male counterparts mere 

 liye kuch order karo na. In fact, today, 

 you have women ordering for men.

 Moving over to the kind of glasses, 

 Irfan pointed out: When at home it is difficult to 

 always get the right kind of glasses. Do not be over-conscious 

 about glass guidelines. Get the closest you can. A 

 crash course in the suitable glass touched upon Pilsner 

 for beer or iced tea, basic whisky tumblers, champagne and 

 martini glasses.

 And what should one watch out 

 for when glass shopping? There should be no bubbles 

 or layers. Thick rims are important, they make your glass 

 last long, explained Irfan.

 The talk then veered towards home 

 bar management. Be creative. Remember you are the 

 host and do not want to end up being a bartender. Start 

 off with an alcohol punch prepared beforehand. It saves 

 you the energy, all your guests are equally attended to, 

 and the finding fault ones will hardly complain, 

 offered Irfan, the iceman (A drink without ice is 

 like half-cooked food, was one of his top lines).

 A shaker, lemon juice, sugar syrup 

 and juice variations are the other key ingredients. A 

 prior chit-chat with your guests, their likes and dislikes, 

 works to your advantage, suggested Irfan.

 When a woman in the audience asked 

 how she should handle a pass at a party, Rita took over: 

 You do not necessarily have to be rude, but one-liners 

 like it is your privilege to ask, now its my 

 prerogative to answer keep them at bay.

 Irfan rounded things off with 

 a mocktail-making demonstration Cranberry Passion Cooler.

 It was a wonderful experience 

 and a welcome break from our usual business talk. It gave 

 us a different perspective on drinks and ways to manage 

 a party, smiled a participant, sure to stir it up 

 soon.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You share your birthday with...

 Hema Malini

 You are thoughtful and careful; contemplating first, then acting decisively and fairly. You enjoy life; dull routine is not something an individualist like you can stand, unless it includes lots of freedom. You take emotional setbacks in your stride and always move on. You are conscientious, efficient and a natural diplomat. Kusum Bhandari

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Super kids in Q amp;A spotlight

 An under-10 world chess prodigy. An under-15 world squash champion. An international mridangam player at 13. An inventor of Newtonian reflector telescope at 14. They all come together to pitch their wits and skills against each other in the all-new show on Sony, Cadbury Bournvita Quiz Contest Confidence Champion.

 Conceptualised and hosted by Derek O?Brien, the show to premiere this Friday at 7.30 pm, has Calcutta written all over it. Apart from Derek and his city-based ?associates?, Confidence Champion has model Shonal Rawat playing the Hindi hostess alongside the new-look quizmaster. And although the first nine episodes of the show have been shot in Mumbai studios, the rest will surely be shot in Calcutta.

 ?If the Bournvita Quiz Contest tested the general knowledge of students, Confidence Champion promises to scout talented children in any sphere,? says Derek, sitting in his Ballygunge Circular Road office. ?It?s no longer about just recall of knowledge, it?s about being good at things like painting, skating, cycling or even academics.?

 More than 1,00,000 nominations came in from schools across India, of which Derek and his team handpicked 1,000. ?Then we met these children in their cities and brought the number down to 90,? reveals Derek. ?These 90 kids will go on the show and rounds of GK and interviews will help us get to the final six. Those six will then be up for voting through SMSes by the viewers.?

 There?s a lot to play for since the eventual Confidence Champion will get to fly to the seven wonders of the world with his or her parents, right from the Great Wall of China to the Empire State Building in New York.

 It?s also the first time in 12 years ? the telly version of BQC started on Zee TV in the mid-1990s ? that Derek?s coming on a prime-time show on the small screen. ?I found the whole experience of meeting and interacting with these super kids quite humbling,? he says. ?In one of the episodes, there was a talented young dancer who taught me a couple of steps. After I did a jig, he said, ?Pappu pass ho gaya!?. You know, when I was doing the quiz show, my questions used to become my script but here I was just reacting.?

 For co-host Shonal, Confidence Champion has been a learning experience. ?After meeting these students ? I choose not to call them kids because they have an individuality of their own ? I myself have become more mature as a person,? the former first runner-up at Miss Asia Pacific says. ?It is easily the best thing I?ve done so far in my career.?

 Through Confidence Champion, Derek wants schools to look at the bigger picture. ?Today, a parent would want his child to come fifth in studies but be good at something else,? he explains. ?Principals and parents, too, have to open up to new ideas. It?s not without reason that the state chief minister has dropped five of his education ministers.?

 Perhaps, girls like Antara De ? a student of Mansoor Habibullah School in Kudghat who?s won the Balshree award from the President for her painting and made it to the Sony show ? can lead the way. ?It?s not a safe thing to do but we had to do something out of the box,? feels Derek.

 It?s certainly not curtains for the original favourite, Bournvita Quiz Contest. Once the 24 episodes of Confidence Champion wrap up, BQC will return on Sony as Cadbury Bournvita Quiz Contest Classic. Even the popular BQC books have been re-launched by Penguin.

 Right now, it?s all about Confidence Champion asking: Kya tum mein hai woh baat?

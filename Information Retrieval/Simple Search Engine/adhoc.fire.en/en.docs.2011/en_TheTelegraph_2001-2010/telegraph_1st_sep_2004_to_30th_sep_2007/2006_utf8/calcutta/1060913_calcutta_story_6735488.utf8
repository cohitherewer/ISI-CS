 A riot of colours for your wall 

 and wardrobe thats what Art in Life, the annual 

 exhibition by CIMA Gallery, promises to offer Calcuttans 

 just before the Puja.

 The exhibition that picks on one 

 particular region of India every year focuses on Punjab 

 this time. And when it comes to Punjab, the colourful Phulkari 

 work that forms the states craft signature is clearly 

 the main attraction.

 We decided to focus on Punjab 

 this time, but sadly the state doesnt have a very 

 rich crafts heritage. The only thing we found interesting 

 was the Phulkari work. Unlike most other states of India, 

 Punjab doesnt have any typical metal or wood work, 

 observes Pratiti Basu Sarkar, chief administrator of CIMA 

 Gallery.

 The exhibition is on at the gallery 

 at Sunny Towers (adjacent to Birla Mandir), from September 

 15 to 28, from 11 am to 8 am.

 The vibrant pieces of fabrics 

 with intricate embroidery can be used as wall hangs, throws 

 on furniture, dupattas and shawls. You can also tailor 

 them to make skirts and jackets. While some of the pieces 

 on display are 20-25 years old, others are modern, lighter 

 pieces commissioned by CIMA. Phulkari work is very 

 rich and fine. To contemporise it for modern use, we commissioned 

 some pieces with lighter embroidery, explains Pratiti.

 While the lighter pieces start 

 from around Rs 4,000, the heavier ones go up to Rs 14,000 

 (approx). There are stools and floor cushions decorated 

 with Phulkari work, too.

 The focus on Punjab, however, 

 ends with Phulkari and beyond that is a rich variety of 

 craft forms carefully handpicked from the country over. 

 Though we focus on one region every year and showcase 

 the best of that region, we also show a variety of artefacts 

 from other parts of India, explains Pratiti.

 The show-stealer is a range of 

 polished dokra pieces from various parts of Bengal 

 and Bastar in Chhattisgarh idols of Durga, Jagaddhatri 

 and Ganesha, tribal motifs, temple decorations like statuettes, 

 bells, lamps and other showpieces such as bullock carts, 

 rickshaws and more. A piece with a Durga statuette on a 

 boat catches the eye. Theres another one where Durga 

 with her family is depicted on the cover of a jewellery 

 box.

 While traditional dokra 

 has a matte finish, these days craftsmen innovate and lend 

 a shine to it through polish to suit modern tastes, 

 explains Pratiti. Another innovation is carbonising dokra, 

 seen on a set of statuettes of a tribal couple with a kid. 

 Another eye-catcher is a nagordola made of traditional 

 lustreless dokra, priced at Rs 15,000.

 Many of the 70-something dokra 

 pieces have been created by master craftsman Rameswar from 

 Bengal. The dokra pieces start as low as Rs 200 for 

 a small lamp and go up to around Rs 55,000.

 Tribal masks from North Dinajpur, 

 used in dance performances, find place at the exhibition. 

 Also on offer is an exquisite array of brocade bedspreads, 

 woven by CIMAs own set of weavers in Varanasi. Suitable 

 picks as wedding gifts and very popular with foreigners, 

 these come for around Rs 7,000. All our pieces in 

 every section are created by master craftsmen, reveals 

 Pratiti.

 The well-stocked costume jewellery 

 section at the gallery is a popular draw every year and 

 this year promises to be no different. Housing the latest 

 in junk jewellery long neckpieces with beads and stones, 

 chunky bracelets, rings, a variety of earrings and much 

 more this section offers trinkets for as low as Rs 10. 

 Theres another corner dedicated to sparkling silver 

 ornaments and semi-precious stones.

 South Indian metal work, wall 

 hangs with dashabatar cards from Bishnupur, carpets, 

 dhurries, natural fibre handbags made of shitol pati 

 and water hyacinth, matir putul from Bengal and more 

 jostle for attention.

 Art in Life has become a 

 much-awaited show now and since we keep the gallery open 

 even on Sundays, many families make this exhibition their 

 Sunday outing, smiles Pratiti. The exhibition is usually 

 slotted just before the Puja because this is a time when 

 people are ready to spend on nice things.

 I think theres no 

 division between fine art and poor 

 craft; we create the division. We see these craft pieces 

 as works of art and so we price them accordingly. We know 

 that theres a small group of people who can afford 

 them but these works must get their due price, concludes 

 Pratiti.

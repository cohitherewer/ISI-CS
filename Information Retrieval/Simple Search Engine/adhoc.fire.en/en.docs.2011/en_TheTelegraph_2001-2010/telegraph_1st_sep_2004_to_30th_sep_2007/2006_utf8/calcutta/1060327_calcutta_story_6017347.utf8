The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Traffic monitors remain defunct

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Notwithstanding the spate of fatal accidents in the city, officers of the traffic control room at Lalbazar are at their wit?s end, as two of the 11 closed-circuit televisions (CCTVs) installed to monitor rash driving and violation of traffic regulations have been lying defunct over the past couple of months.

 To add to the problem, these CCTVs often develop technical snags that take weeks to be repaired, despite several reminders to senior officers.

 According to an officer of the traffic control room, the installation of CCTVs has definitely helped the cops to keep a tab on errant drivers and monitor traffic movements at important crossings. 

 ?It has been almost two months since the CCTVs at the five-point crossing at Shyambazar and the one at All India Radio have stopped functioning. This has led to problems in managing traffic and rule violation by drivers at the two crossings,? an officer said.

 As part of the drive to modernise Calcutta Police, 11 CCTVs were installed in August 2005 at 11 major crossings. Officers sitting in the traffic control room monitor vehicles at busy intersections and file cases against those flouting traffic regulations. 

 Besides, these CCTVs come to good use during massive rallies in the central areas of the city and when law-and order problems arise.

 ?It becomes difficult for constables to monitor traffic movement as well as keep an eye on law violators at busy intersections. The camera zooms in on errant drivers with the help of the CCTV and we trace the number plates of the vehicle and file cases from here. There has been a substantial rise in traffic violation cases since the CCTVs were installed,? the official added.

 Deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Jawed Shamim said: ?There are some technical problems and the two defunct CCTVs will be repaired at the earliest.? 

 He admitted that the installation of CCTVs did make a difference in vehicular regulation and cracking down on traffic violators as well.

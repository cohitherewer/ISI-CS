The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You share your birthday with...

 Dino Morea (actor), Nick Lachey (singer)

 You are resourceful and with experience under your belt, you are the perfect business partner. Outgoing, confident and with plenty of energy, you need to keep an eye at the top. You are not selfish; you merely know what you want. People recognise your drive, independent mind and determination. You are not really competitive, you simply hate losing. Kusum Bhandari

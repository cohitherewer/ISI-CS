The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Trapped in sleaze Net

 IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI

 CASE I: Anjali Sharma (name changed), a 21-year-old management student in Salt Lake, is in a state of shock. Over the past month, she has been receiving unwanted calls on her cellphone.

 The callers make indecent proposals and threaten her with dire consequences if she refuses. Much later, she comes to know that somebody has created a profile on the Internet with her personal details and a photograph. A shattered Anjali lodges a complaint with the CIDs cyber-crime cell.

 CASE II: Roshni (name changed), a 23-year-old from Patna, attempts suicide after not being able to bear harassment any more. She has been getting obscene calls from across the country. Following a complaint with the CID, she comes to know that someone has posted her address and phone number, along with a nude photograph of a model, on a pornographic website.

 The cyber-crime cell is flooded with such complaints. Neelu Sherpa, deputy superintendent who heads the cell, said the complaints of harassment are mostly from college girls and working women.

 Our officers are tracking the numbers from where the calls are coming. Thats the only way to identify the culprits, said Sherpa.

 The modus operandi is the same. People create a user account in a Net chat room and post personal details of girls, including their address and phone numbers, on it. In most cases, the culprits indulge in such activities out of jealousy or enmity, Sherpa added.

 Sleuths said that among the most vulnerable are the women who stay alone.

 Citing an example, Sherpa said two engineers of a central government unit were harassing one of their woman colleagues. A probe revealed that they had posted her residential address and phone number, along with a semi-nude photograph of a model, on a pornographic website. 

 A statement I am a housewife in Calcutta. Good-looking men can call me on this number was attributed to her on the site. People from across the world started calling her and some even visited her at home, the officer added.

 The CID cracked the case with help from Interpol. The culprits had created the account through a US-based server.

 The engineers had planned to harass their colleague out of jealousy. One of the accused is a gold medalist in computer science. This is the first cyber-crime case in which we have filed a chargesheet, Sherpa said.

Life

 She wants to break free

 CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA FINDS SOLACE AT AN ALL-WOMANS HOUR IN A NIGHTSPOT, SURROUNDED BY WOMEN IN THEIR KURTIS AND THEIR THIRTIES, FOOTLOOSE AND FRISKY

 Theres a place middle-aged women go to die after visiting a nightclub in Mumbai. For what does she see when she steps into a nightclub? Rows and rows of Priyanka Chopras, all in their 20s or less, flashing their navel-rings in an assembly line. Why, there is even Priyanka Chopra herself.

 Then she sees herself. She has age, obesity, frizzy hair, the open pores, the bulges, a 36-inch jeans and facial hair blond from bleach.

 I am short and hirsute, too. Once in a lounge bar toilet, where the lights made me feel more naked, my friend told me that if I did not wax my moustache immediately I would look like Mangal Pandey, the one we knew best.

 I would, therefore, order a Sex-on-the-Beach for Rs 450 (most of the cover charge) and think about life. Then I would order a small beer for Rs 110 and think some more. Then I would ask about the place where middle-aged women went to die.

 And all the while, bump-and-grind, bump-and-grind, bump-and-grind ? they went. And bump-and-grind, bump-and-grind, bump-and-grind.

 So I wanted to check out the Calcutta night scene. There was a crazy offer from a lounge bar: it was holding an all-womans night every week where everything ? entry, drinks and even small eats ? was free. No men, of course. 

 The lady doorkeeper did not stop us ? I was with a journalist friend, both in office clothes ? and we entered the jungle. It was around 10. The dance floor was a press of gyrating female bodies.

 But we headed for the bar. It was a flickering rectangle of fluorescent bars, changing from red to orange to flame. 

 We checked the offer. It was true. The spillovers from the dance floor, in twos and threes, were hanging along the bar. Most of them were in their kurtis. Better, most of them were in their thirties. 

 But more reassuring were the waiters. They did not discriminate. One of them called me gently and asked me what I would like to have. Then he suggested it himself: I could have a fiery whisky shot followed by a cool vodka one. He worked a little at the counter and came back with the whisky shot.

 Then he did something unexpected. He asked me to turn around and grabbed my head from behind and banged it down on the counter, but without the thud. Next thing I knew was a steel cocktail-shaker above my head. 

 The waiter poured the drink down my throat with his right hand, while with his left he held my head down. I saw flames going out of my mouth. 

 Before I could recover, he was ready with the second. Again I stretched my neck across the counter. It was a supercold, rattling-with-ice-cubes drink, which I gulped, but while it was yet to go down, I felt the kind man grabbing my head again and giving it a good shake, like a cocktail shaker. I heard the ice rattling again.

 No man had done this to me before. That too in public. I repeated the drinks. Then a soft haze formed before my eyes, beautiful thoughts were popping up like beaded bubbles winking at the brim and I began to see into the life of things.

 As soon as I thought beaded bubbles, the giant screen began to show a foreign ramp with pale boys in white tees. One T-shirt said Keats ? at the back. Though another said: Our Man Victoria. I knew I had been blessed.

 Then I saw the lady who was the centrepiece of the dance floor. She seemed to be in her forties and was resplendent in a maroon chiffon. Her head was tied in a loose, but neat bun. She held her beer bottle close to her heart. She rocked. So did her bun at the nape of her neck, as she moved sexily to Sajna ve sajna. Main teri ho gayi yaar sajna ve sajna....! 

 As she danced on, she drew wolf whistles from the floor around her, most of whom, again I couldnt help noticing, were in their kurtis ? and thirties. Her pallu soared, the not-so-firm abs jiggled and the beer bottle did circles in the air. It was a glorious sight. She had broken free.

 Three women strayed when the sweetest of the waiters jumped on to a platform with three lighted bottles, performed a blink-and-miss act with three bottles on fire. As he threw them in the air and caught them in a perfect circle, the three came charging at him, bent low, and with their heads at the level of his knees, shook their hips. 

 The strays returned to the floor. I also joined them. I went up to the lady in maroon, thrust my hands just above my thighs, and went bump-and-grind, bump-and-grind, bump-and-grind. And bump-and-grind, bump-and-grind, bump-and-grind. Twelve times.

 I also told her a legend from MTV. Sexy, crajee, groovy, jajjy, baby, you are my love kamakajee.

 Well, I didnt do any of these things really. I am caught too much between behnji and cool. But I could have. In Calcutta.

 Next time, I will take my Ma and Mashi there.

Get set to be manhandled

 madam in the middle: Vrajesh Hirjee and Ash Chandler with a model in The Man?s World Show

 It?s a show for men, by men and of men. Sounds boring? Well, there?s ?enough eyecandy? in the form of famous models and actresses, promise the hosts of The Man?s World Show to go on air from Wednesday, 10.30 pm on AXN.

 ?There is no real programme targeted for the male viewer other than news or sports and this show tries to cater to that empty space,? Rohit Bhandari, director, South Asia, SPE Networks explains to Metro. 

 ?Even when it comes to the print medium, we think of the semi-pornographic magazines available with small-time dealers at street corners. So, moving away from the pure reality shows that we were dishing out on AXN, we have come up with this new concept where we try to answer a lot of common queries that men have always had but never knew whom to ask.?

 The presentation of The Man?s World Show, however, is very stylish and wacky and that?s got to do with the two hosts of the show ? comic actors Ash Chandler and Vrajesh Hirjee.

 Says Ash, who recently appeared in Shikhar and will also be seen in My Bollywood Bride and Mixed Doubles: ?Everything on TV is catering to women, from their feelings and thoughts to their clothing and make-up. It?s time someone did something for the 49 per cent of the Indian population.?

 So, tune into The Man?s World Show, which guides you through spicy things like how to seduce a woman and how to juggle girlfriends, and more sober things like what gadgets should you be seen with and which is the best style statement for a particular occasion.

 ?Three years ago, if you walked into a clothes store, you would have workwear on one side and maybe some T-shirts and check shirts on another. But now, you have separate sections dedicated to partywear and nightwear and what not. With our show, we are just accentuating the whole thing and putting that in perspective,? adds Bhandari.

 Apart from the two hosts, a host of quirky characters make The Man?s World Show very, very watchable. There?s Benny, a 30-year-old virgin, who has a novel approach to dating but without much success. Then there?s Tara, the sizzling hot bartender who helps Ash and Vrajesh by giving them a female point of view and insight into female logic. Dr Love is the guru of advice, helping them to deal with matters of the heart. And then there?s the attractive Demo Girl Benny approaches at the bar with his pick-up lines.

 But it?s ultimately about the chemistry Ash and Vrajesh share. ?It?s quite incredible that despite knowing more than half the people who turned up for the audition, I vibed best with Vrajesh, someone I had never met before,? recalls Ash. ?We have a very different style and a very different sense of humour and that keeps us going.?

 If nothing else entices you to surf across to AXN, Wednesday nights at 10.30, you may like to check out the very best of Bollywood beauties, who are slated to come as chief guests on the show. From Tanishaa to Amrita Arora to Dia Mirza, there will be a lot of hot women trying to walk into the men?s world.

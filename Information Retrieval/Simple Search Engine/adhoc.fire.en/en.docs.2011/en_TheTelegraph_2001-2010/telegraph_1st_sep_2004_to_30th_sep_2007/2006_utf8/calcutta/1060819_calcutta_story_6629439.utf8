The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 They disturb the universe 

 One of the things that make good 

 theatre good is, ironically enough, its capacity to disturb 

 us. What we regard as classics often shocked viewers on 

 their first appearance.

 Two Bengali productions have been 

 doing just this: Sandarbhas Gahwar has upset supporters 

 of the party in power, while Drishyapats Aguner Barnamala 

 has scandalised the moral police. Both, incidentally, 

 premiered outside Calcutta, in Barrackpore and Howrah, as 

 part of the Odeon Festival, but have now begun their Calcutta 

 runs.

 Sandarbhas playwright-director 

 Soumitra Basu normally composes lighter drama, some of them 

 fit for children too. This time he undertakes some serious 

 soul-searching, which leaves a very disillusioning picture 

 of Bengali society. Gahwar tells the story of an 

 older teacher, her daughter estranged from her politician 

 husband, and an unemployed stranger who enters their lives. 

 Each member of this quartet faces a dilemma or crisis of 

 conscience.

 The married couple polarises good 

 against evil: the wife (Jhulan Mukhopadhyay) adheres to 

 leftist idealism but finds it has got her nowhere; the husband 

 (Basu) has become completely corrupt, cynically explaining 

 politics as pragmatic opportunism. The mother and youth 

 represent the compromised ethics of the common people in 

 the middle. 

 To save herself from investigations, 

 she (Sima Dey) denies that in a fury she pushed a groper 

 off a running bus to his accidental death. To save his family 

 from starving, he (Rajarshi Mukhopadhyay) blackmails her 

 for money that he needs to pay someone who promised him 

 a job. The denouement is tragic, and without any ray of 

 hope. 

 Presented simply in an ordinary 

 drawing room presided over by a portrait of Tagore, Gahwar 

 seems to ask, is this what Bengali civilisation has 

 come to?

 Basu has written a strong original 

 play, whereas the strength of Aguner Barnamala in 

 fact comes from England. The author, Hara Bhattacharya, 

 merely adapted it from Peter Shaffers electrifying Equus, 

 which he duly acknowledged when it was first printed in 

 SAS magazine a few years ago. How come Odeon, who 

 financially support original scripts only, overlooked this 

 obvious debt? Did Drishyapat conveniently forget to mention 

 its source?

 Audiences in Howrah overreacted 

 to the treatment of sexuality, which is actually quite tame 

 by todays standards. Instead of the boy blinding horses 

 that witnessed his sexual initiation, here he is obsessed 

 by fire that cleanses all sin. He burns to death his father, 

 who had set ablaze his wife on suspicion of adultery, which 

 the son had erroneously confirmed. 

 We feel sorry for Shaffers hero, 

 but nothing of the kind for Bhattacharyas, whose psychology 

 is more warped. So is Bhattacharyas own thought, which 

 for reasons unknown takes unnecessary cheap shots at the 

 expense of Ramakrishna and Vivekananda. All these changes, 

 and his additions of the teenagers grandparents and several 

 youths to the dramatis personae, are unwarranted.

 Anirban Bhattacharya directs the 

 show reasonably well, but the finest scenes like the blue-film 

 screening come directly from Shaffer, who deserves all 

 the credit. Debshankar Halder (the troubled psychiatrist), 

 Saunak Sanyal (the boy), Chhabi Talukdar (his indulgent 

 grandmother), Jayeeta Goswami (his spirited mother) and 

 Ankita Chakraborty (his immature girlfriend) portray their 

 characters commendably. 

 The weak link is Rwita 

 Dutta Chakraborty, who acts the psychiatrists love interest 

 so stiffly, no wonder he lost interest in her!

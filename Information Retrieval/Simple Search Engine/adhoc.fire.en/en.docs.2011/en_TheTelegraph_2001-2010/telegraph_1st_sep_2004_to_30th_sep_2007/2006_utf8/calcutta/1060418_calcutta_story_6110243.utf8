 The Bondel Gate flyover, the third corridor to EM Bypass from south Calcutta, will not be ready for evening traffic before June. The incomplete flyover had to be closed within two hours of its commissioning on Poila Baisakh.

 Local MLA Rabin Deb is reportedly pressuring the public works department (PWD) contractor, National Project Construction Corporation (NPCC), to complete the civil work by this week. ?You will see smooth movement of traffic along the flyover in three or four days,? promised Deb on Monday.

 However, an engineer in the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA)?s lighting department disclosed on condition of anonymity that the tender for the illumination of the structure had not been floated.

 According to him, until the PWD gives the CMDA a completion certificate, the illumination work cannot start. The work is likely to continue till June, the engineer added. 

 During the day, NPCC engineers and workers were busy casting the guard railings at the western end of the flyover, which meets Rifle Range Road. Construction of the proposed staircase for pedestrians is yet to start.

 ?The work will be over soon. We will reopen the flyover to traffic by Friday,? stated NPCC executive engineer S.K. Mukherjee. 

 PWD minister Amar Chowdhury said: ?The construction work is over. Traffic movement over the flyover has been temporarily suspended to facilitate quick completion of some extra work.?

 Local residents refuted the claims of the authorities. ?They can only present us a dark flyover by next week. Movement of traffic would be dangerous at night,? held A. Pal Chowdhury of Bondel Road. He also had doubts regarding the manner in which the work was being completed. 

 ?They have played politics with the flyover for years. Now that the election is knocking on the door, they are not hesitating in compromising on the safety of the motorists and the passengers of buses and minibuses,? alleged Javed Ahmed Khan, who is contesting against Deb in the Ballygunge constituency. 

 Malay Biswas, a resident of Palm Avenue, pointed out a fault in the planning of the flyover. ?Buses, minibuses and fire brigade trucks will no longer be able to access Bondel Road. Only cars, taxis and autorickshaws can ply under the flyover,? he observed.

 The grind takes a pamper turn every day when 20 finalists competing for the Vatika Honey amp; Saffron Soap Sananda Tilottama 2006 step into VLCC for a truly therapeutic beauty experience.

 Very much part of the daily activity schedule, this is probably the only session that no girl minds being put through.

 The beauty ball was set rolling by a complete hair and skin analysis at VLCC. After scrutinising their general body and skin conditions, we formed an individual package for each of them, revealed Dr Srikanta Das, assistant vice-president, VLCC, Calcutta.

 Right at the onset, the girls were given a mane makeover. Some needed stylish cuts, colours or streaks while others needed hair straightening or slight perms, observed Dr Das.

 She also noticed how many of the contestants had a problem of rough and lustre-less hair due to excessive dry and damaged tress conditions. These contestants underwent various spa treatments and other packages like VLCC Deep Hair conditioning, VLCC Hair Strengthening and VLCC Clear treatment for dandruff. 

 We also cured common skin problems and gave them dermabrasions for pits and scars and treated pigmentation with glycolic peels. The girls were introduced to our new Ericson Line too, added Dr Das.

 Apart from the regular features, all the finalists were given whole-body bleaches, scrubs and body polishing. Even an ordinary manicure and pedicure took the aroma route for this pampered lot.

 In fact, VLCC also helped the girls with classes on make-up and home care of hair and skin.

 With the big night so near, how does the grooming partner pump up the pampering? We have special facials lined up for each one of them ? Skin Purifying Facials for acne-prone skin, Radiance Booster Facials for lustre-less skin, Organic Facials or Hydra Facials for dry skin. Also, all the girls will get a final touch-up in the form of full body polish, manicure and pedicure, concluded Dr Das.

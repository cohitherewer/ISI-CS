Selling of sublime art

Poetry, too, needs to be governed by the business philosophy 

of marketing

Shiloo Chattopadhyay

The invitation came a few days back. I was deeply 

honoured and pleasantly surprised. It said that an eminent publishing house and 

a Bengali magazine of poetry are organising a three-day workshop next week. That, 

of course, was par for the course. The real reason for my bewilderment was that 

the letter invited me to participate in the workshop. It is true that I am a proud 

and passionate lover of my mother tongue. But it is equally true that I am an 

untrained and infrequent reader of poetry. More importantly, I have never been 

able to pen even four lines that rhymed. My first worry was whether the organisers 

of the seminar knew this as well as I did.

It is then that I saw the topic of the session for 

which I have been invited. It was mercifully not about the recent trends in Bengali 

poetry, nor was it, I found to my utter relief, a comparative analysis of the 

styles of Shakti Chattopadhyay and Purnendu Patree. The topic was: whether poetry 

should be marketed! That indeed was amazing. A form of sublime art was debating 

whether it needs to hold the hand of a discipline that is associated with crude 

commerce.

The conflict between these two is at their very core. 

At its simplest, marketing aims at satisfying consumer needs. Since consumer is 

rarely singular, the preceding sentence can easily be rephrased as ? marketing 

recommends pandering to popular tastes. That is simply because it is easier to 

sell what a consumer wants rather than selling what you have already made.

Poetry, the little that I understand of it, is an 

instrument of self-expression. The thoughts and emotions of the poet are encoded 

in his own semantics. I wondered, therefore, how on earth could anyone write poetry 

keeping in mind the multitude who might buy his book? The slated debate was over 

in my mind before it actually began on the stage.

My relief was short lived. Fortunately the other side 

of the coin soon became visible. Much as a poet indulges in selfish creations, 

he also wants to be read, understood, and discussed. For that his poetry must 

reach the reader. Looking at it from this point of view, marketing certainly has 

a role to play. It is at this juncture I realised that I had fallen prey to a 

common folly. Marketing as a business philosophy, for the umpteenth time, was 

being confused with marketing as a set of business activities that catalyse the 

process of a consumer acquiring his desired goods.

Fine arts cannot, very few will debate, adopt the 

business philosophy that marketing embodies. That will completely destroy the 

fineness of the art form. Thus, it is only the engineering side of marketing that 

poetry needs; a handbook of activities that helps its propagation. For that to 

work there has to be, of course, a clarity of the end goal ? get more people to 

read poetry or get the existing constituency to read more of it.

I know the obvious answer will be both. But the mechanism 

and the cost involved are so different that a choice may become unavoidable. Incidentally, 

by cost one does not mean only the financial ones. For instance, the degree of 

compromise demanded by the first task ? expanding the market ? may well be unaffordable 

in value terms. Would any poet be happy to take any brief, let alone a brief to 

write poetry that attracts non-believers? The task for marketing will therefore 

necessarily be limited to increasing the intensity of usage of poetry among believers. 

That will mean creating awareness, engineering trial and generating favourable 

impressions about the publications. A routine that will be much like what will 

be needed for marketing a brand of soap or a shampoo. This could well be a comfortable 

solution. For, this route will demand action from the publisher rather than the 

poet. Poetry will remain unpolluted despite it being ?marketed?.

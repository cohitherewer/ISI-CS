 Reins shift in LSE courses

 NISHA LAHIRI

 Ritanjan Das took a University of London external studies undergraduate course in Calcutta and went on to graduate in the first class. He got a scholarship to London School of Economics (LSE) for his post-graduation. He is now a teacher in Portsmouth, UK.

 Rohan Ghosh is another success story. The Bengali boy took the degree in Dubai, got a scholarship to LSE courtesy another Indian student?s generous father from Singapore, and now lives in the US. 

 It is because of the ?excellence? of Indian students, particularly Bengali ones, that Rosemary Gosling, director, LSE external study, is happy that The Cambridge School (TCS) will take up the reins where Techno India left off. The institute ran the course for around a decade, till last summer. TCS will start off this September.

 The courses offered will be in economics, management and banking and finance. Those who taught the courses in Techno have agreed to continue at TCS, said Sarojesh C. Mukerjee, director of TCS. ?But the course fees will be cheaper than the Rs 10,000-odd per month it used to be,? he added.

 The curriculum in economics, management, finance and social sciences are designed by LSE, and the degree is conferred by the University of London. For A-level students, it?s a three-year course. For others, it?s four years. 

 The subject material is available online. Students can transfer to LSE in the second year, with two scholarships for the external study students and one for postgraduates. 

 ?We have 13,000 students overall, with 200-plus from this country. The Indian students, from around the world, are second only in excellence to the Chinese,? smiled Gosling, on a day?s trip to town. 

 ?We have some very good students from Calcutta doing exceedingly well at LSE, in the UK,? added the white-haired woman with a special Calcutta connection. 

 ?My parents used to live here. I was brought up on Bengali nursery rhymes,? she signed off with a smile.

 Just as well that Rajeev Samant 

 didnt do a hullabaloo in his alphonso orchard in Nashik. 

 The late Nineties saw this young Stanford graduate and finance 

 manager at Oracle in San Francisco quit his job to come 

 home to a family-owned 30-acre plot, 2,000 feet above sea 

 level. Growing mangoes, tomatoes and even roses was what 

 he was initially spurred on to do. But the salubrious climate 

 and the terroir were far too perfect to farm such 

 mundane produce and he set about transforming it into grape 

 country. He teamed up with a leading winemaker, Kerry Dempskey, 

 from Californias Sonoma Valley, and his first vines 

 were planted.

 Between then and today, we are 

 told that the wine industry is growing at 25 to 30 per cent 

 per year, and vintner and sommelier Samants Sula Vineyards 

 in Nashik is producing wines of international class. Of 

 the sort that a group of the citys epicures could 

 savour over a multi-course sit-down French repast last Friday 

 at The Park hotels brand new banquet, Galaxy.

 For Italian chef Davide Cananzi, 

 who has earlier taken many of us through the subtler techniques 

 of pasta making and cooking a mean risotto, the challenge 

 of curating the cuisine of France and pairing it with some 

 of the delightful Sula wines on offer proved to be a worthy 

 one.

 The profile of the guests was 

 one that did not need the hand-holding initiation that Samant 

 had done when he made his first appearance in Calcutta at 

 the turn of the new millennium. They could certainly tell 

 a Chablis from a Chardonnay, and even facilely describe 

 both body and bouquet of a Beaujolais or a Bordeaux.

 The evening started with the celebratory 

 bubbly a Sula Brut complemented with a range of canapes 

 with salmon, caviar, prawns and asparagus.

 As we moved to the more formally 

 laid out round tables where we had been name-allocated and 

 which also bore the names of famous French cities, the guests 

 were all set to expertly roil their glasses with the Sula 

 Sauvignon Blanc. Paired with the first course of Salade 

 Nicoise, with its subtle undertones of anchovy (there was 

 a choice of a vegetable terrine with raspberry mustard), 

 this herbaceous wine seemed a perfect match, with a green 

 pepper-asparagus bouquet with a fruity aftertaste.

 Guests continued to swirl and 

 sip their Sauvignon Blanc with the Crme Dubarry (a cream 

 of cauliflower soup) but were adept at switching to the 

 jammy, luscious, red Zinfandel wine that matched 

 the main course a salmon steak with Provencale sauce and 

 creamed potato.

 The vegetarian choice that I also 

 requested for came as a puff pastry with a delicately grilled 

 vegetable mlange filling, capers and butter. The 

 Zinfandel gave this due accompaniment, redolent as it was 

 with blackberry aromas and cinnamon and plum flavours. The 

 connoisseurs at our table certainly seemed to find its body 

 and bouquet most agreeable.

 As the Camembert, Goat cheese, 

 Gruyere and Roquefort platter made their appearance, the 

 Taylors Port wine did its partnerly duty. There was 

 more to come with the dessert finale, which turned out to 

 be a quartet of apple creations apple tartlets, apple 

 turnovers, stewed apple compote and a red apple sorbet, 

 to be complemented with a Sula Late Harvest Chenin Blanc.

 Described by the vintner himself 

 as a semi-dry, refreshingly light wine bursting with 

 pineapple and stone fruit, this came as a perfect 

 finish to an evening that proved the elegant and discerning 

 nature of the palettes of the handpicked guests. 

 And probably also gave more elbow 

 to The Park to continue to spearhead its culinary nights 

 and widen its Roxy Wine Club membership to steer the whisky-vodka 

 tippling brigade to the refinements of wine drinking, teamed 

 with new menus. On the cards is an Oriental spread, again 

 to be fashioned at the hands of chef Cananzi, and we can 

 wait to find out what sort of wines will find favour with 

 our Far Eastern delicacies.

 Talking of pairing, we need to 

 taste a few new items not just complemented by wine, but 

 cooked in it. When the invitation came from The Park, there 

 was also an email from my friends the Faulkners, from Le 

 Grand Cros, their magnificent 25-acre vineyard in the South 

 of France. Jane Faulkner, whom many in Calcutta will remember 

 as a charming hostess and wife of Hugh Faulkner who headed 

 Indal in those days and subsequently gave in to the thrills 

 of viniculture, has begun to set up some recipes on their 

 website. Her Poached Pears in Red Wine might do with a trial 

 run here, cooked, if not with their Esprit de Provence, 

 but with a dash of our own Dindori Reserve Shiraz from Sula.

 Or from the larger selection of 

 Australian, French and South African wines that are accessible 

 to us today. Home entertainment will never be the same again, 

 and requesting for a glass of red or white will surely expand 

 to asking for specific wines for todays discerning 

 diners.

 I overheard GoodLife food 

 columnist and former executive chef of The Park Shaun Kenworthy 

 talk of getting a wine license rather than a liquor license 

 for a place he intends to set up soon. Wining and dining 

 may not be such a cliche any more.

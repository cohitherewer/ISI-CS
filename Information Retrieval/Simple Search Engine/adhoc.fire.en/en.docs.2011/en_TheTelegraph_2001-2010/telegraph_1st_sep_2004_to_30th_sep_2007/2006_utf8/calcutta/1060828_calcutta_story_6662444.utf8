 Study of the stars debuts at college

 SHALMOLI KUNDU

 Students aspiring to specialise in astronomy and astrophysics will no longer have to move out of the city to pursue their academic dreams. 

 The physics department of Presidency College has tied up with Inter University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA), Pune, to introduce the subjects on the city campus. This is the first time such a pact has been forged. 

 Apart from starting an elective course on Astrophysics of Stars and Stellar Systems at the M.Sc. Part II level from the current academic session, the college authorities also have plans to introduce holiday schools on the subjects. Interested students can enrol for these short-term courses. 

 Interest in astronomy and astrophysics has increased over the years. The subjects have received a further boost after discovery of celestial bodies in the farthest reaches of the solar system. This has generated considerable interest among the students, who want to know the true nature of the solar system, said Debiprasad Duari, director (research and academics), MP Birla Institute of Fundamental Research.

 People have started questioning the movement of the planets. Unfortunately, no educational institution in Calcutta used to offer the subjects. The introduction of astrophysics and astronomy at the M.Sc level and also as short-term courses in holiday schools will fill this void, Duari continued. 

 The holiday schools will be organised during the long vacations in summer, autumn and winter. They will be open to students from other educational institutions, too. The short-term courses will provide elementary information about stars, meteors, solar system and the universe as a whole. 

 Our primary objective behind organising these holiday courses will be to extend our facilities and resources to the students. Those who are interested in learning about astrophysics and astronomy and are not a student of Presidency can also apply for admission. However, modalities are yet to be sorted out with IUCAA. We hope to start the holiday schools soon, said Mamata Ray Choudhuri, principal of the college.

 Experts like Duari and professors of the IUCAA will conduct classes for the holiday schools. 

 Ajit Kembhavi, professor and dean of IUCAA, along with his colleagues, will help Presidency College in setting up of an astronomy database server and develop a data analysis software. 

 IUCAA is satisfied with the infrastructure available on the college campus. What we now need is a high-speed Internet connection. This will help the students access the astronomy database server from their homes through the Internet, added the Presidency principal.

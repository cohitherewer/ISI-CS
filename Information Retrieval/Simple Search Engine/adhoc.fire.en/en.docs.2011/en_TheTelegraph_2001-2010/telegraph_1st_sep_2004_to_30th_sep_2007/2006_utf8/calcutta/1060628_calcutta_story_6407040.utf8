 What brings together a group of students, teachers, doctors, engineers, mountain climbers and retired executives for an hour every Tuesday evening? A common love for the cosmos.

 Around 80 astronomy enthusiasts gather at the MP Birla Planetarium every week to learn about the birth of the universe, the evolution of stars and other mysteries of the galaxy.

 ?But owing to the great surge in interest for the course in the recent past, we have been unable to accommodate a lot of enthusiasts,? said Debiprosad Duari, director (research and academics) of the planetarium and the course director.

 ?The waiting list has grown to 115 and a lot of people have already sent in their names for next year,? Duari said.

 The growing popularity of the course has prompted the planetarium to consider introducing another class in the week. 

 ?It would have the same curriculum as the existing course, but would allow us to fit in those on the waiting list,? Duari explained.

 The free evening course on introductory astronomy was started in 1965. 

 ?The course was started keeping in mind the general interest of the people during the planetary shows,? recalled Duari. To attend the 10-month course, the participant must have passed at least Higher Secondary.

 Participants present and past includes academicians, doctors, politicians and students.

 ?It is an extremely interesting course,? offered Gayatri Solomon, principal of South Point School, one of the students of the current batch that started in April. ?The sky is very fascinating. The lectures and multimedia presentations bring the subject alive,? she added.

 Solomon?s batchmates are aged 18 to 78 and include her former students and teachers, besides a host of people from other professions.

 Often, the interest is so high that some of the participants carry on studying the subject on their own through alumni groups, after the course ends.

 ?I have always been a nature lover and fond of adventure. Though I was not a science student, attending the course was a great experience,? said mountaineer Basanta Singha Roy, a past member.

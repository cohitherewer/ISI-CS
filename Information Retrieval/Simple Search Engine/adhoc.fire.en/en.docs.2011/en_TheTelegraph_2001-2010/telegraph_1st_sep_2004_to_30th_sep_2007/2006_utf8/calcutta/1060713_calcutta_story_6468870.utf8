 Dining diktat for healthy living

 Feng Shui

 Pinky Kapoor

For the wellbeing of all family 

 members, it is important to create a niche area in the house 

 for dining. This area should be in the east. It should be 

 well-ventilated to increase appetite. Being in the east, 

 it derives power from the rising sun, which creates a bright 

 ambience and generates radiant vibrations. Dining can be 

 a pleasure in such a nice and healthy environment. Dark, 

 dull, gloomy, depressing and lifeless dining rooms affect 

 our appetite and health adversely.

 Make sure that the dining area 

 is on the same floor level as other rooms on the floor. 

 It should never be on a split-level. Single floor levels 

 help the smooth circulation of Chi and also aid in containing 

 it more than split floor levels.

 Never make the mistake of setting 

 up the dining area below a toilet on the upper floor or 

 below a room that contains heavy machines. Any heavy object 

 pressing down from above would bring direct pressure on 

 the food and the people dining. Restrooms for guests should 

 not open into the dining area. Negative energy emitted by 

 the toilets mingles with the healthy energy circulating 

 in the environment.

 Eat Right : 

 Feng Shui recommends placing the dining area of the 

 house in the east. This area derives power from the 

 rising sun and creates a bright ambience. Make sure 

 that the dining area is on the same level as other rooms 

 on the floor to ensure smooth movement of Chi. One should 

 also be careful about the artefacts, paintings or pictures 

 displayed here 

 One should be very careful of 

 what is being displayed in this nourishing area as the surrounding 

 energies are very subtle and delicate yet have a strong 

 impact on our subliminal mind. Abstract art displayed on 

 the walls immediately starts playing on our subconscious 

 mind as we try to sort out what the painting depicts while 

 we are eating. Instead, select pictures, paintings, figures 

 or images that ensure a fine balance of relaxation and eating.

 Pictures depicting kings or warriors 

 hunting or killing animals should be avoided. Soothing and 

 peaceful landscapes, flowers in full bloom, fruit orchards, 

 family or friends dining on special events can be comfortably 

 displayed on the east of the dining area. A picture of the 

 family dining together when displayed on the eastern wall 

 will strengthen family ties significantly. 

 The peaceful environment thus 

 created should not be stimulated with a moving clock anywhere 

 in this area as this leads to an increase in time pressure 

 while dining. Do not place the dining table in an area where 

 there is too much breeze or in a busy area where too many 

 doors open into it. These disturb and dissipate the prevailing 

 quite energy of this region. 

 Equally important is to ensure 

 that there are no poison arrows around in the form of pointed 

 and sharp edges of furniture and artefacts. These interfere 

 with the circulating cosmic energy and weaken it to a great 

 extent. Imagine what would happen to the digestion of a 

 person who is directly confronted by a sharp edge of the 

 tabletop pointing towards his stomach. 

 Different shapes of dining tables 

 impart different kinds of energies. Rectangular tables are 

 considered the best as they impart gentle energy that is 

 beneficial for dining. Square tables represent the stable 

 earth energy where the family and friends can sit for long 

 hours and enjoy meals. Round tables tend to make guests 

 leave early as the Chi circulates around them fast. These 

 are ideal for restaurants and fast food centres where customers 

 vacate the tables fast. They are doubly auspicious in commercial 

 areas as their coin-like shape is suggestive of wealth.

 All the family members can boost 

 their appetite and health by facing their auspicious health 

 directions. These are calculated according to the kua 

 formula where your year of birth is taken into consideration. 

 The Chinese believe that god comes from heaven to bless 

 you with good health when you face your auspicious direction 

 while eating. People who suffer from indigestion and chronic 

 health problems must tap their health directions while eating 

 and taking medicines.

 Do not clutter your dining table 

 with knives, forks and pickles. They attract conflicting 

 and contradictory energy and unnecessarily bring disagreements 

 among family members. Instead, place an attractive vase 

 of fresh flowers or float some fresh petals in water with 

 a candle lit in the centre. This will attract positive and 

 beneficial energy. 

 The ambience of the dining room 

 can be changed according to the season by bringing in fresh 

 plants and changing the colour of the tablecloth, napkins, 

 tableware and curtains. Shades of green is good for spring, 

 cool hues of blue with water fountains for summer, warm 

 earthy tones along with crystals and sparkling semi-precious 

 stones for autumn and vibrant tones of red with pretty candles 

 is excellent for creating a warm ambience in winter.

 Tip of the 

 week

 Place a large mirror on the eastern 

 or northern wall of the dining area reflecting the surface 

 of the table. This ensures doubling of wealth as the food 

 that is laid on the table is also doubled, which is symbolic 

 of wealth and prosperity according to the Chinese.

 IIT Delhi in tie-up

 SHALMOLI KUNDU

 The Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Delhi, is tying up with a Calcutta campus and bringing its expertise in management studies to the table.

 NSHM Academy, a city institute, is investing Rs 55 crore to set up a business and management school and a media and communications school in Calcutta.

 The institute will tie up with IIT Delhi?s department of management studies to draw up the postgraduate curriculum for the new school.

 IIT Delhi will collaborate with NSHM in more ways. It will determine faculty positions for the management school.

 The IIT will also ensure quality control by monitoring the teaching standards.

 ?Nowhere else in the country has an IIT entered into such a tie-up. This is also for the first time that IIT Delhi is making a foray into the eastern zone of the country,? said Cecil Antony, chairman of NSHM Academy.

 The academy is affiliated to the West Bengal University of Technology for its undergraduate courses.

 ?We have spoken to Harish Chaudhury, professor of the department of management studies, IIT Delhi. He is helping us prepare the methodology and the format of the courses on the lines of IIT Delhi,? Antony said.

 Chaudhury, speaking from Delhi, said: ?The teaching format at most B-schools is not up to the mark. We also have plans to conduct special classes in the Calcutta institute by teachers of IIT Delhi.?

 The undergraduate programmes start from August this year and the post-graduate schedule from next year.

 The academy has obtained a 2.2-acre plot in Tollygunge, adjacent to South City Garden on BL Saha Road. The organisation can build on an area of 160,000 sq ft, and it has already built on 50,000 sq ft. The construction will be ready by 2008. 

 The campus will house the management and media schools, and accommodate over 300 students.

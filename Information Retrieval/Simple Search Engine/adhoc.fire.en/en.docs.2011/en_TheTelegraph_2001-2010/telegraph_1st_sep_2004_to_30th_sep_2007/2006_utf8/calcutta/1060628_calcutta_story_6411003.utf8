The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 On my recent visit to Surat, I saw that garbage is collected twice a day and 

is a door-to-door service. But the scenario is different in Calcutta. The garbage 

vats have turned the city into hell. People living near the vats cannot put up 

with the stench. Why can?t the civic authorities modernise the system and chalk 

out an alternative plan for garbage collection? If the garbage is picked up in 

an organised manner, it can be recycled and power can be generated from it. 

 S.S Almal,

Lower Rawdon Street. 

 More than half of the the footpath in front American Center is occupied by 

the armed policemen. It is quite difficult for commuters to walk down the stretch. 

There is sufficient space inside the Center, where the policemen can sit and keep 

a watch from. This problem is no less than hawkers encroaching on the roads. I 

feel the authorities should look into the matter.

 Supreme sacrifice

 A tragic tale of love and sacrifice, Mohua Sundari rekindles finer human sentiments and passions that have all but withered away in an age of self-interest, self-seeking and gross materialism. This evenings dance presentation of the love-story explores nuances of human emotion and sensitivity with a maturity of expression rarely found in this genre of the performing arts. Based on a tale in the Mymensing Gitikabya, it tells the story of Mohua, a beautiful, young, gypsy girl, who would dance, sing and perform magic acts as part of a travelling circus. When Mohua and Nouda Thakur, the zamindar of a village where the troupe had gone to perform, fell in love, the relationship was strictly opposed by the troupe leader, who wanted Mohua to marry his son. However, the two lovers secretly left the village and got married. When the couple was found, Nouda was captured and Mohua was ordered to kill her own husband. Seeing no way out, Mohua stabbed herself, after which her husband was killed by the troupe leaders son. Choreography and direction: Sutapa Awon Pradhan.

 Event: Dance-drama Mohua Sundari, presented by Nrityalok 

When: Today at 6 pm 

Where: Bharatiyam Cultural Multiplex, IB-201 Salt Lake

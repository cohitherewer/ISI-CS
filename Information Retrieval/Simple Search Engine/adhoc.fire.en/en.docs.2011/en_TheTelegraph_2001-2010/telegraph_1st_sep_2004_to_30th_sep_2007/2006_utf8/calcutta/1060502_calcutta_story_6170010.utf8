 Saraswati Sinha, her teenaged son Somnath and daughter Runu were hounded out of their Kalidham residence, near Dum Dum, on Monday and forced to take shelter in a relative?s house. But a ray of redress did appear, with Alimuddin Street forced to get into the act.

 Three days of terror tactics by CPM activists hell-bent on taking over a portion of their premises and setting up a club there took its toll on the Sinha family. The hapless mother-children trio turned up at the CPM headquarters on Monday to plead with the party brass and stop the muscle-flexing by the partymen in Dum Dum.

 They finally did meet CPM state secretariat member Benoy Konar and narrated their ordeal.

 On Friday, Swapan Saha, CPM councillor of ward 14 of the Left-controlled Dum Dum municipality, with his aides, had ransacked the Sinha house, and beaten up Runu and Somnath for refusing to hand over a portion of their land to set up a club.

 ?Konar gave us a patient hearing when we told him how the local councillor was tormenting us. He instructed us to report the matter to the party?s zonal secretary,? said Saraswati Sinha.

 Cornered, Swapan Gupta, CPM zonal committee secretary of Dum Dum, termed Friday?s attack on the Sinhas a ?very unfortunate?.

 ?It appears that the family has the proper documents to substantiate its claim on the land on which we wanted to construct a club. So, we have decided not to go ahead with the proposed construction,? added Gupta.

 The Sinhas said police apathy had forced them to approach Alimuddin Street. ?We had first gone to Dum Dum police station on Monday morning but nobody was willing to help us. In fact, they behaved rudely,? alleged Somnath.

 Though a specific complaint has been lodged against CPM councillor Saha, he added, no action had been taken against him so far.

 ?If we do not get justice, we may have to appeal to the state human rights commission,? felt Somnath.

 His sister Runu, who had suffered severe head injures during Friday?s assault, underwent treatment at NRS Medical College and Hospital. ?I am too weak to walk and in pain? But we don?t know when we will be able to go back home.?

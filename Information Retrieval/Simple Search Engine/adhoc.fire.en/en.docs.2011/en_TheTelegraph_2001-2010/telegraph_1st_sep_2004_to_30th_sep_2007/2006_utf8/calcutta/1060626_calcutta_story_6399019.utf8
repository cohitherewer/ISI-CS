 Death trap on incomplete bridge

 Ashok Kumar Hore: The Bondel Gate bridge is the only U-shaped bridge in the city as well as in the country. Can you tell us why the design plan of the bridge was changed and why it was opened before the public works department (PWD) issued a completion certificate? 

 The Bondel Gate bridge, the third corridor to EM Bypass from south Calcutta,has been a death trap. So far, four people have died after the commissioning of the bridge on Poila Baisakh. I will demand a detailed report on the bridge from our PWD minister Kshiti Goswami.

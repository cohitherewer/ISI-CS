The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Loan for drainage 

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation will take an additional loan of $400 million (Rs 1,500 crore) from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to bring all 41 wards in the added areas of Behala, Garden Reach and Jadavpur within the underground drainage and sewerage network.

 The money will be spent on laying drainage lines in 15 of the 41 wards ? six in Jadavpur, seven in Behala and two in Garden Reach. 

 Work in the rest of the wards in the added areas is already in progress, along with six wards in north Calcutta, under phase I of the Calcutta Environment Improvement Project (CEIP). The ABD had granted a loan of Rs 1,700 crore for the project.

 The civic body decided to take the second loan under CEIP after realising that the funds for phase I were not enough for all 41 wards in the added areas. 

 ?An imbalance exists with regard to civic services between the city proper and the added areas,? mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya said on Thursday. 

 ?The first phase of CEIP, scheduled to end in 2010, would have resulted in an imbalance among the wards in the added areas. To avoid this, we decided on taking an additional loan of Rs 1,500 crore,? he added.

 The mayor has held talks with bank officials, who have ?in principle? agreed to sanction the loan.

 ?The officials told me that this time they would send money to the civic body directly or through the state government, and would not demand a guarantee from the Centre,? the mayor pointed out.

 CEIP project director Rajiva Sinha said: ?We have prepared the project report in advance after conducting a field survey in the 15 wards that will come under phase II of the drainage project. Work will start soon after the funds reach us. Both phases will run simultaneously.?

 An official said there would be a gap of three months between sanctioning of the loan and start of work. 

 The gap was three years for phase I.

 The last rays of the sun cast their parting light on a clutch of women and children gathered at the backdoor of The Heritage School. Their clothes suit more the shanties across the pond than the mansion whose iron doors stay firmly shut.

 But the anticipation that lights their faces tells a different story. In a few minutes, the gates would open and let them in. It is World Literacy Day, and Kalyan Bharti Trust that runs the school will be inaugurating Surya Kiran, a free evening school for underprivileged children on the school premises. 

 We are poor people. We never dreamt of entering this complex, leave alone sending our children here to study, Baby Goldar beams at daughter Kajali.

 Most of the parents stay close by, in Chowbhaga. Some come from Colerite, across the pond. I used to send Apsari to the club for classes, says Arati Mandal whose husband works as a daily labourer. Kali Shakti Sangha, the club, has been the sole teaching pad for many of these children.

 Surya Kiran would give them the first taste of school. Loknath, who would hurry his mother to take him to classes at the club, prefers this school as there are so many cars here to gape at. He has cleared the alphabets in both English and Bengali as well as the numbers to earn his passport.

 We looked at economic criteria, literacy level and proximity of address to choose 50 from the 500 applicants, says Prabir Ray, executive director of the trust. The brilliant among these children will be added to the mainstream. We will bear their educational expenses.

 Meenakshi Atal, headmistress of The Heritage School, insists that the evening school was always a part of the plan. 

 The senior students, who have a social service class, will also share their knowledge with these children. There will be free books, stationery and snacks.

 By then, the gates open and in march the children with mothers in tow. When Mahendra Swarup, chairman of the trust, holds up the candle for the inauguration, the sun has set but the literacy lamp is burning bright.

 Serious quizzing business

The best of corporate minds in 

 Calcutta battled it out among themselves for over two hours 

 on Saturday evening.

 But the fight was not over market 

 share or consumers mind space. Instead, the professionals 

 were engaged in a war of wits.

 It was the third edition of Biz 

 Quiz, the annual quiz show promoted by the Indian Institute 

 of Management Calcutta (IIMC) Alumni Association. The show 

 was organised in association with The Telegraph.

 Corporate quizzes such as 

 these provide a great opportunity to increase interest on 

 business matters besides spreading awareness on whats 

 happening in corporate world, said Mrinmoy Roy, chairman 

 of the alumni associations local chapter.

 We started the quiz in 2004 

 and its getting popular with every edition. Thirty 

 teams from prominent corporate houses in the region took 

 part in the competition and we are very happy with the response, 

 said Ashok Banerjee, secretary of the old boys and girls 

 body of the countrys leading B-school.

 But only eight teams could qualify 

 for Saturdays finale. These included teams from ITC, 

 TCS, ICICI, Ernst amp; Young and four teams with representatives 

 from various corporate houses. Gautam Ghosh, an IIMC alumnus 

 himself, conducted the evenings proceedings. Dona 

 Ganguly, guest of honour for the evening, also conducted 

 a round.

 In the initial rounds, the teams 

 matched each other. But as the rounds progressed, the youngest 

 team, We Are Like Them Wonly, emerged the clear winners. 

 The Pot Hunters, an outstation group, came second and the 

 ITC team bagged the second runner-up prize. The awards included 

 cash prizes, air tickets and gift vouchers.

 I never knew quizzing could 

 be so stressful. Its no longer just plain and 

 simple fun, summed up Sunil Alagh, former Britannia 

 Industries managing director and a third batch IIMC student, 

 after the fiercely-fought competition.

 And the element of competitiveness 

 and excitement kept not only the participants, but even 

 the 100-plus audience tied to their seats for over two hours.

 Falling on the map

 There are two maps of the world 

 in front of me. One is in a book and dates from 1490. Prepared 

 by Henricus Martellus, this blue and silver map shows the 

 world as one unbroken continent, with Africa attached to 

 Asia and Europe by a thin strip of land. India is hard to 

 find, though there is a caption in the middle of the sea 

 saying sinus gangetic.

 The other map in front of me is 

 on a computer screen. It is an online map resource called 

 Wikimapia and was created by Alexandre Koriakine and Eugenia 

 Saveliev. It has been available from May 24 this year on 

 www.wikimapia.org and has a simple, one-sentence slogan: 

 Lets describe the whole Earth!

 The homepage of Wikimapia shows 

 a glittering blue and green planet on a flat screen, while 

 Greenland and Antarctica make up the fluffy white bits at 

 the top and the bottom. For a moment we are fooled into 

 believing that this is how the earth looks from space, but 

 in fact it doesnt. To any artificial satellite orbiting 

 the earth, the planet is visible as a sphere whereas the 

 Wikimapia homepage shows the earth in a Mercator projection, 

 in which parallels and meridians are straight and perpendicular 

 to each other. 

 By using the zoom and direction 

 toggles on the top left corner of the screen, one can go 

 literally anywhere, up close and personal. When I first 

 discovered Wikimapia my first impulse was to find out if 

 I could see my house. I hovered over south Calcutta, located 

 the seemingly endless Raja Subodh Chandra Mullick Road, 

 and then began to descend like a parachutist over my para. 

 Soon I could see our two-storied house and even the faint 

 outline of the attic on the roof. In an orgy of nostalgia, 

 I even revisited the house where I lived as a doctoral student 

 and was gratified to discover that the dustbin is exactly 

 in the same place it was 10 years ago.

 Now that we have seen the world, 

 it is time to describe it. The top right corner of the screen 

 has a menu which enables one to draw rectangles on the screen 

 and then type text in it. In most of the major cities in 

 the world, these boxes have been used to describe important 

 civic structures such as monuments, stations, hospitals 

 and the like. But not so in Calcutta. The people of Calcutta 

 have taken the task of describing the world very, very seriously 

 indeed. They have described everything in merciless detail, 

 leaving the screen littered with labels such as Potlar 

 mamabari, Harudar chaer dokan and Tarun 

 Sathi Boys Club. Never have the local and the global 

 come together with such vengeance as on Wikimapia.

 But my favourite description comes 

 from somewhere near Charu Avenue where some thoughtful soul 

 has made the following entry: Tollygunje Railway Station: 

 the shortest distance by rail in the world: Lake Gardens 

 to Tollygunje. Today Calcutta, tomorrow the world!

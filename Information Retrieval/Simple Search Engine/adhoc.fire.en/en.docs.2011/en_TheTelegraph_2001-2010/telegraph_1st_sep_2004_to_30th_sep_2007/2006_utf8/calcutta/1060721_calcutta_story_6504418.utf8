The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Washout fears at bay

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The city awoke to no more than a drizzle on Thursday, the morning after the deluge. Though the evening brought some brief, sharp showers after a day of mere pitter-patter, the Met office held out the assurance that no repeat of the Wednesday washout was in sight.

 The weatherman based the forecast of ?light to moderate rain? in the next 24 hours on the trough of low pressure, that extended from Bihar to central Bay of Bengal across Calcutta on Wednesday, shifting slightly away from the city on Thursday.

 ?Due to this, we expect heavy rain in the coastal areas of south Bengal, but not in Calcutta,? said G.C. Debnath, director, weather section, at Alipore.

 The forecast will draw sighs of relief, nowhere louder than the pockets of Calcutta that remained under water 33 hours and more after Wednesday?s ?waterfall?. Metro visited some of these flooded spots on Thursday afternoon, hours after the Opposition staged a walkout from the House on the waterlogging issue.

 Time: 3.30 pm.

 Place: Paikpara

 Waterlogged Zone: 

 Tarashankar Sarani, Indra Biswas Road, Raj Kumar Chatterjee 

 Lane, Khelat Babu Lane, Raja Manindra Road and Anath Nath 

 Deb Lane.

 Residentspeak: 

 This is a low-lying area, so whenever it rains, we have 

 to wade through water for hours. We have accepted this as 

 our fate, something we have to live with... The CMC must 

 do something about this but what can I say when former councillor 

 Chhaya Banerjee, living next door, has accepted such a plight? 

 ? Kaushal Basu.

 Time: 5 pm

 Place: Kasba

 Waterlogged Zone: 

 Stretches of R.K Chatterjee Road and its lanes and bylanes 

 near Bakultala.

 Residentspeak: Every 

 year, it?s the same story. Kasba is notorious for waterlogging 

 and we are the worst hit. Water recedes very slowly, as 

 it is a low-lying area and the drains are clogged? If the 

 CMC takes the initiative and desilts the drainage system, 

 the water would drain out faster. The rickshawwallahs 

 force us to pay through our nose to travel the shortest 

 of distances ? Ranjan Ghosh.

 Time: 6.30 pm

 Place: Behala

 Waterlogged Zone: 

 Silpara, near Sakherbazar.

 Residentspeak: 

 This is one part of our heritage we cannot be proud of it... 

 But how can we blame the CMC or any other organisation when 

 we, the residents, are equally at fault? Residents throw 

 garbage at the crossings of lanes and bylanes. This is a 

 low-lying area and on top of that, all the drains are completely 

 blocked. The condition can only improve if both local residents 

 and the CMC work in unison. ?Gopal Malakar.

 LAST WORD: Most of these 

 areas have no drainage structure, for which an ADB project 

 is on, to be completed by 2008. This is transitional trauma 

 for the people. ? civic commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Focus on medical matters 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Good health for the common man at a price he can afford will be the agenda of the three-day Health and Lifestyle Show 2006, organised by the Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry (BCCI), in association with the state government, Calcutta Municipal Corporation and The Telegraph.

 The event at Taj Bengal from Friday will strive to create awareness on various aspects of healthcare and initiate a drive to build infrastructure. 

 In a curtain-raiser on Tuesday, chairman of the BCCIs health sub-committee Amit Ghose spoke about the exhibitions, workshops, demonstrations and check-up camps that would be held as part of the show. Information kiosks will be set up and blood donation campaigns launched.

 Health has to be one of the mainstays of any chamber of commerce, Ghose observed. He added that organising such shows is part of corporate social responsibility. 

 The chairman explained how lifestyle disorders were causing obesity, stress, diabetes and hypertension. 

 Investing in health insurance is a good option for most people, he suggested. Yet, despite health insurance being the cheapest in this part of the country, the number of insurers has not grown significantly. The practice is to buy insurance cover only when one is in trouble, not when one is young and healthy.

 BCCI president Aloke Mookerjea said the chamber was ready to share platform with any institution that wishes to introduce insurance education as part of its academic curriculum. BCCI cannot change the world, it can only show a path to success, signed off Ghose.

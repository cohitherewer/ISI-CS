The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You share your birthday with...

 Kareena Kapoor

 You are a serious worker and a philosopher at heart. You love intrigue and exploration. You have a progressive and realistic outlook. At work, you climb the ladder faster than the rest. You believe in planning and setting goals. You are intuitive and a bit superstitious. You keep your head in a crisis and are loyal to friends and family. Kusum Bhandari

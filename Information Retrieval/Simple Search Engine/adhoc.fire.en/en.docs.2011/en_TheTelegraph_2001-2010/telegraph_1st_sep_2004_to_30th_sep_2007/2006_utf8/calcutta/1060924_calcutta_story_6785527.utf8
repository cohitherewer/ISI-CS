The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Next weekend you can be at ... 

Sandeswar Temple

 Only two kilometres from Chinsurah railway station is a 

 beautiful Shiva temple called Sandeswar. Like most places 

 of pilgrimage, the temples surroundings are congested. 

 Maybe thats why it is not popular among tourists yet. 

 To the right of the temple is a lush green garden on the banks of the Hooghly. There are seating arrangements inside and one can spend hours watching the river. Country boats can be hired for a cruise.

 The 85-ft-high temple in white is built somewhat like a church and betrays influences of Dutch architecture. It has a spacious courtyard and well-defined rectangular pillars. The shivling is in the basement. Devotees generally offer puja on Fridays. Shivratri is celebrated with fanfare. 

 Adjacent to the temple is the natmandir and smaller temples where Shiva is worshipped in different avatars. A renovation of the structures is in progress. Tiny flower and sweet shops dot the area.

 The temple was built by the local zamindar in the 19th Century and reconstructed by the government in the 1950s. A trust is now responsible for its maintenance. The best time to drop in is in the evening, when a cool breeze blows in from the Hooghly. The boats return from fishing trips then and local residents head for the ghats for a bath. The riverbank is bordered by an abundance of catkins (kash) serving as hideouts for jackals.

 The other tourist attractions in the area are the Dutch church, cemetery, Imambara and the ruins of the East India Company barracks.

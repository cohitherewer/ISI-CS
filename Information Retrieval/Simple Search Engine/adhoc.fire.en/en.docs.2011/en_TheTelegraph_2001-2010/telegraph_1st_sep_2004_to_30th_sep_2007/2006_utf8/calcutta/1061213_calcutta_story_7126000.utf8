 The metallic sheen of gold and silver and the brilliant sparkle of crystals. If the big fat Indian wedding is about all this and much more, so is the countrys biggest annual exhibition of wedding finery Bridal Asia.

 Back after a one-and-a-half year gap, the wedding extravaganza to be hosted by Delhi in January, will wear an opulent look, the decor done up in matte gold, silver and crystals.

 All the three elements are very big internationally and this will be the theme look of Bridal Asia 2007. The decor by Rajeev Goel will, however, not be like a shaadi; the elements will be used keeping the corporate look in mind, reveals Divya Gurwara, CEO of Bridal Asia.

 The bridal bonanza brings under one roof trousseau creations by 70 designers including clothes and jewellery, mehndi and sangeet artists, stationery designers, gift packers, choreographers, caterers, wedding planners, venue decorators, travel companies and all those who make up the great Indian wedding industry.

 This time we are doing the show just before the wedding season kicks off in mid-January. We have made the show more compact by bringing down the number of designers from 90 to 70, but the line-up is comprehensive, adds Divya.

 While there are designers from all over India and Pakistan, Calcutta will be represented by Anamika Khanna, Monapali, Abhishek Dutta, Arnab Sen Gupta, Minaxi Dadoo and Suman Nathwani for clothes, Vasundhara Mantri, Nemichand Bamalwa amp; Sons (a bestseller at Bridal Asia every year) and Siltouch for accessories. 

 Bridal Asia has always got very good participation from Calcutta and we have worked with all big designers here. This time we have Anamika after a long gap and Monapali is there like every year. Plus, we have young talents like Abhishek, Minaxi and Arnab, says Divya.

 The event will begin with fashion shows at The Grand in Delhi on January 10 and 11. The evening of January 10 will see shows by Karma from Pakistan, Malini Ramani, Surily Goel and Rina Dhaka. The ramp on Day 2 will feature collections by Suneet Verma, Falguni and Shane Peacock, Bhairavi Jaikishen and Pallavi Jaikishen. The shows will be followed by exhibitions from January 13 to 15 at Hotel Ashok.

 Return of the roll

 The carpets are rolled out, the cash register regularly rings out ching-a-ling, bright yellow boards with the name proudly scrawled across welcome back to Nizams.

 With two sections re-opened and another two set to open before the Pujas, Calcuttans can once again flock to their favourite food stop for kathi rolls, near New Market.

 The look is brand new even if the brand name stays the same. Nizams is a landmark of Calcutta and changing the name would be close to a crime, says Aviral Kapoor, director of Algologix Ltd, the software company that has tied up with Nizams in agreement with its labour union.

 The 4,500 sq ft hall has been divided into three sections, for 150 diners, with a separate room for families. A few metres around the corner of the front entrance sits the beef section, with a capacity for 90. Vibrant hues are splashed across the walls; orange, red, yellow and blue make up most of the colour palette. Centre pillars stand strong with umbrella-shaped fibre canopies overlooking the once-tiled-now-marble flooring. The tiny cabins are missing, present only in the beef section, the tables are glass-topped and even the waiters are ready to sport black corduroy pants with white shirts.

 In time to come, the area will be air-conditioned, assured Kapoor, adding that the structure has stayed the same because we couldnt tamper with a heritage building.

 After close to three years of closure, the menu and the prices have been nominally upgraded. A chicken roll that would have cost you Rs 17 earlier, now comes for Rs 25; biryani earlier priced at Rs 45 now comes for Rs 60.

 The inventors of kathi kebab rolls and fast-food clearly have more to offer this time, focussing not only on rolls but also on Mughlai food. A live food counter serving kebabs and takeaways is a novelty, as are the kulfi and paan corners adjacent to the main entrance.

 With the Ramazan month setting in and the Pujas just weeks away, Nizams unplugged gives yet another reason for Calcutta to rock and roll.

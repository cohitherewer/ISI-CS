What: The Telegraph Merchants 

Cup Golf 2006 Nite.

Where: The Ballroom at The Oberoi Grand.

When: Friday, 8 pm onwards.

The big bash: The extended Merchants 

Cup family turned up in strength at the star hotel to celebrate the finale of 

the annual golf tournament. Even before the awards presentation could get underway, 

the ballroom was chock-a-block with golfers, their wives, colleagues and supporters.

Casuals and champagne, solitaires and smiles it 

turned out to be quite a party as guests caught up with friends and shared a good 

laugh.

Moving away from tradition, there were no long speeches 

this time. Master of ceremonies Brandon D Souza kicked off the proceedings 

as Mandira Bedi, in a sizzling red cocktail sari with trademark noodle straps, 

admitted before an admiring audience how she was a veteran beginner 

when it came to golf (unlike cricket).

The evening kicked off with the awards presentation 

as loud cheers and enthusiastic applause followed each announcement.

Most of the initial awards were given out on a daily 

basis for the four-day golfing competition. There were prizes for putts closest 

to the pin, longest drive, best nett, Challenge Cup, division runners-up and winners 

and best nett team.

McLeod Russel, Tata Steel and Oil India were winners 

in the three Divisions. Tata Tea B was the best Nett Team. Ranjit Singh of Oil 

India took away the Best Gross Merchants Cup while Shyamal Mullick of Flenders 

won the Best Nett Challenge Cup.

 Debutant participant Cognizant Technology Solutions 

won the Wooden Spoon, while Euro Design Home World were the winners of the Challenge 

Cup.

The best was saved for last, with Madhya Bharat Papers 

Ltd being crowned Merchants Cup 2006 winners.

The evening was far from over as singers Francis Lepcha 

and Chanelle Grosser belted out some Bollywood as well as English numbers. With 

tracks like Dus bahaane, Bin tere sanam, Im alive, 

Bailamos, My heart goes sha la la la and Mama mia, it was 

not too long before the assembled audience took to the dance floor. The party 

rocked past midnight.

Sip 'n' bite: Free-flowing beer, whiskey and 

wine livened up the cocktail session in the earlier part of the evening. The delectable 

dinner spread had guests digging into Tandoori Salad, Vegetable Pulao, Aloo Udaigiri, 

Paneer Makhani, Methi Murg, Lamb Roganjosh, Chocolate Mousse and Gulab Jamun. 

A live pasta counter also drew many guests.

Voiceover: Having done away with some 

of the traditional bits of this event, we have tried to give a whole new dimension 

to this evening. Guests can simply let down their hair and enjoy themselves after 

a good tournament, said Brandon D Souza, president of Tiger Sports 

Marketing.

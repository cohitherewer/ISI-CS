 I appreciate the appeals by the CPM leadership to stop 

 filling up waterbodies. The waterbodies should be preserved 

 to maintain the ecological balance. These waterbodies can 

 used for pisciculture or recreations like boating and swimming 

 by involving some private organisation. But they should 

 be maintained as they can turn into breeding grounds for 

 mosquitoes.

 Recently, the parking facility at the Woodburn Road-Elgin 

 Road crossing and Sarat Bose Road-Elgin Road crossing has 

 been withdrawn. There are three educational institutions 

 on this stretch (Bhawanipur College, United Missionary School 

 and Diocesan School). Students and their guardians are facing 

 great difficulties while dropping and picking up their wards. 

 I request the authorities to look into the matter.

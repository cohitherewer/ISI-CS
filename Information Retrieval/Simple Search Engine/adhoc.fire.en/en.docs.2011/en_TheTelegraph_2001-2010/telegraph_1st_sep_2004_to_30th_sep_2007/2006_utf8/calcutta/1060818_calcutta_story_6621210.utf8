 Doyens of literature, music, art and theatre like Shakespeare and Tagore, R.D. Burman and Ramgopal Verma, as well as other lesser-known figures of popular entertainment in their time, come together in Swapnasuchanas latest production, Hemlat The Prince of Garanhata. A play that takes Shakespeares Hamlet and places it in the present milieu, it is a criticism of the extreme nonchalance and destructive character of the present generation. As in the original, the protagonists father, Sadhan, has been murdered by his uncle, Kadu. Kadu, who now lives with Hemlats mother, Manorama, runs a catering business and is trying to sell the family home to promoters. Other residents of Garanhata are Hemlats childhood love, Shefalia, her drunkard father, Paul, the local councillor, Sukhen and a host of other characters who are awaiting the dawn of a new day. The plot thickens when the ghost of Hemlats father suddenly appears, and events rush on to their inevitable end. Drama, direction and acting: Bratya Basu.

 Cops rescue abducted trader

 - Call clue nets accomplice

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Officers of Muchipara police station on Tuesday rescued a 32-year-old trader from a hideout in Murshidabad, four days after he was abducted from the city. The man who had offered the abductors shelter in his home was held in the raid.

 Around 7.30 in the evening on March 17, a man in his mid-40s walked into the PC Boral Street shop of Debabrata Roy and offered to show him a specially-manufactured iron valve. Roy, who dealt in cast iron products, expressed interest and asked the man to bring the item to the shop. The man, however, asked Roy to accompany him to his car, parked a few yards away, to take a look at the item. 

 When Roy reached the car, he was pulled inside and driven away. When Roy did not return after a few hours, the employees of the shop informed his parents at their Rajani Gupta Lane residence.

 ?The next morning, Roy?s father Purna Chandra received a call from the abductors demanding a ransom of Rs 10 lakh. They wanted the money to be handed over at Bhagwangola, in Murshidabad,? said deputy commissioner of police (central) Ajay Kumar.

 Soon after the call was received, a team of cops left for Murshidabad. They got in touch with the local police and traced the PCO from where the call was made. ?We also met the locals and tried to obtain a description of the man who had made the call. Once a rough sketch was available, we started looking for him,? said an officer of Muchipara thana. 

 On the morning of March 19, Purna Chandra received another call, this time from Kazipur, under Ranitala police station. The caller claimed that he was not one of the abductors and that Roy was in his custody. He said he was willing to let Roy go for just Rs 1 lakh.

 The sleuths figured out that Roy had been shifted to a village close to the Bangladesh border. The team moved to Kazipur, where they identified the telephone booth from where the second call was made.

 On the basis of the description provided by the booth-owner, the cops started a hunt for the man. Early on Tuesday, he was spotted outside a house. The cops barged in and rescued Debabrata. House-owner Sheikh Sadik, 47, was arrested. He later confessed to making the second call.

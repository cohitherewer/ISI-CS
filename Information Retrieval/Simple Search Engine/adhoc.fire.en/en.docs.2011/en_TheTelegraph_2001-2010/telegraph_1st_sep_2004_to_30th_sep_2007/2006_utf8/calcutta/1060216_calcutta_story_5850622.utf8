 - Snip stops see dashing keeper?s locks setting trends for college crowd

 M.S. Dhoni: Long, 

 peppered with colour

 Kunal Kapoor: The 

 long, feminine cut 

 The Pakistan team dreads it, the Pakistan President likes it and the female fan following in India just loves it. If Mahendra Singh Dhoni at the crease is making it a habit to give the opposition bad-hair days, at trendy saloons he?s helping fuel a long-hair fad in the days of short-hair fashion.

 The long and the short of it at snip stops around town is simple: Dhoni joins the likes of John (Jism and Dhoom) Abraham and Kunal (Range De Basanti) Kapoor in keeping the long-hair look in business at a time when everyone, from Tom Cruise to Akshay Kumar, is cropping it close.

 ?Fashion statements are no longer only about Bollywood. With the whole nation glued to the ongoing India-Pakistan series, Dhoni?s hairstyle will definitely catch on,? feels hair expert Jawed Habib. ?Dhoni is young blood and full of talent. Youngsters find in him a role model and his style is more suitable for the college crowd,? adds Habib, who describes the keeper-cum-batsman?s hairstyle as ?long, peppered with colour? and also digs Sachin Tendulkar?s ?trendy, wispy and unkempt? hair.

 But bat-and-ball can?t beat Bollywood, stresses Habib?s pupil Zahid Khan, who recently opened a signature snip stop in town. ?Star cuts always find a steady fan following in the 18-to-21 age group,? says the Zahids man, picking Aamir Khan, John Abraham, Shah Rukh Khan and Hrithik Roshan as the hairstyle heroes.

 Raman Bharadwaj of A.N. John picks the ?messy, out-of-bed look of Aamir (DJ) Khan in Rang De Basanti and the long feminine cut, accentuating the rugged facial structure of Kunal (Aslam) Kapoor? as the looks to watch out for.

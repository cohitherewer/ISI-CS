Life

 First flight for fact, fun and fantasy

 Years ago, they started with a seven-day basic cabin crew course. Today, Frankfinn has soared into music and magazine, and is now preparing to scale new heights ? a Bollywood venture, an aviation school, pilot training, and then an airline within three years.

 Our vision is to feature among the top aviation and entertainment companies. That is the reason for our diversification and future expansion, says K.S. Kohli, chairman of Frankfinn Group.

 amour is the glue for an institute offering air hostess/steward training to venture into music, claims Kohli. The aviation institute caters to the youth, and a music video is also most viewed and enjoyed by the youth brigade. So, venturing into music had its surrogate benefit, he adds.

 The first album from the Frankfinn Music stable was Ranjhan Yaar, an album on Sufi music. Aaja Pyar Karle, releasing soon, will feature British artistes. The third album will have a host of Pakistani and Indian singers.

 The target date for project Bollywood to hit the floors is October 2006. Ashtra Shastra is an action thriller, for which Kohli hopes to rope in brand ambassador Soha Ali Khan, Abhishek Bachchan, Akshay Kumar and others.

 But these flights of filmi fantasy are still secondary to the flying facts being taught at the Frankfinn Institute of Air Hostess Training. With around 60 centres in 45 cities, the institute now offers an international vocational qualification, BTEC Higher National Certificate (HNC) in aviation, hospitality and travel management from Edexcel International, UK. Edexcel is recognised in more than 110 countries.

 Apart from classes on self-development and grooming, the one-year diploma course also includes sessions in English language (with BBC Active), Galileo, a computerised reservation system for the travel industry, and Fidelio, a hotel reservation package essential for front-office operations. The broadened course spectrum allows students to be absorbed in various segments of the hospitality industry, explains Kohli.

 An institute in Dubai will open up next month, followed by those in Colombo, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur and Muscat.

 For some vital practical exposure, Tuesday evening saw 150 students from the Calcutta centres in Salt Lake, Gariahat and Camac Street taking a one-hour flight over Calcutta.

 A loud cheer greeted the take-off of the Jet Airways craft. As the air-hostesses and stewards on duty explained the use of oxygen masks and seat belts, the trainees sat in silence taking note of each and every move.

 It was work and play rolled into one as the Frankfinn flock exchanged places and tried out various passenger service units. Though we were trained in an airbus in Delhi, this experience of flying was quite different. It gave us the essence of how we would put our learning to use once on board, said an excited student from the Salt Lake institute.

 Kohli labelled the exercise a much-needed confidence boost for students.

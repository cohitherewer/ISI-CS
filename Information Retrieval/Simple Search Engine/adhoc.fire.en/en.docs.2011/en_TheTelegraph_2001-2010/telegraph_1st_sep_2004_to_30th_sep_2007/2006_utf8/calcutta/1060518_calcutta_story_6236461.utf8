 Ransom lost for house

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Had they managed to find a room to hide five-year-old Mayurish Tarsaha, they might have earned Rs 10 lakh from her father after kidnapping her.

 A day after rescuing Mayurish and arresting her two kidnappers in the Garden Reach-Metiabruz area, police said that though the abduction plan was ?neatly chalked out?, the duo did not succeed as it failed to locate a ?proper house? to hide the girl.

 ?We caught Shoeb Alam and Imraj red-handed when they came to collect the ransom along with the child,? said an officer. 

 Mayurish, a resident of Garden Reach, was kidnapped from her school on Paharpur Road on Tuesday afternoon. 

 Imraj called Mayurish?s businessman father Wazid Ahmed a number of times for ransom. Tracking the calls, the cops came to know the whereabouts of the kidnappers.

 Mayurish did not raise any alarm in the company of the kidnappers, as she knew both. ?The two were arrested late on Tuesday in Ramnagar, where they had asked Ahmed to come with the money,? said Gyanwant Singh, deputy commissioner (detective department).

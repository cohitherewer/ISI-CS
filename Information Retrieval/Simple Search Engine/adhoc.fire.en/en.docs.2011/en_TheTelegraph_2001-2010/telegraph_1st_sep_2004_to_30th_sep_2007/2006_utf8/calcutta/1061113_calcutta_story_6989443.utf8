collection for Adijex 2006, a jewellery show in Abu Dhabi.

 Where: Ocio, Belvedere Road, Alipore.

 When: Friday afternoon.

 Take a look: Just back from a show in Dubai last month, jewellery designer Varda Goenka is all set to repeat her success story at Adijex 2006, to be held from November 15 to 19 in Abu Dhabi.

 On Friday, members of Jyotirmai Club, a 560-member womens charitable organisation, witnessed a preview of the jewellery line. Contemporary and mature, the collection has bold jewellery that speaks for itself, says Varda. Elaborating on her design patterns, Varda says: I have incorporated a lot of western influences along with Indian sensibilities. The collection is apt for any part of the world. 

 Big pendants, necklaces, earrings, bracelets, unconventional rings and chokers have been set in yellow and white gold. Diamonds are used extensively along with rubies, sapphires, topaz and turquoise. Broad mesh-worked bracelets have been combined with diamonds, some boasting inspirations from nature, some fitting snugly like a watch. 

 Chandelier earrings with pearl droplets, geometric patterns embellished with jade and big studs, intricate neckpieces there are Victorian styles with contemporary twists. 

 Models Jessica, Ishika, Priyanka Kohli and Rusha showcased the collection, while the audience picked up some jewel facts from Varda. The trend talk revolved around big bracelets and rings being in fashion along with gold. Gold has made a comeback, but not in its usual sparkling avatar. Matte, hammer-polish or antique-finish, the dull look is in, said Varda.

 Cake craze

 What: Cake-mixing ceremony.

 Where: Hotel Hindusthan International.

 When: November 7.

 Take a look: One festive season is over and another beckons. With less than a couple of months to go for Christmas, chefs at the AJC Bose Road hotel rolled up their sleeves, put on their gloves and mixed 250 kg of dry fruits including almonds, cashewnuts, raisins and a few more exotic elements like dried dates, imported all the way from South America and Iraq. With free-flowing alcohol and lots of colours, the cake-mixing event was all about preparation with a dash of fun. 

 The procedure involves 45 days of fermentation in airtight containers at room temperature. Thereafter, flour and eggs are added and the mixture is baked in the ovens before it hits the shelves. And if youre lucky, you might just find a coin in your cake, a couple of which are thrown in as part of tradition. Actresses Locket Chatterjee and Ananya were present to lend a helping hand.

 Voiceover: The cake-mixing ceremony marks the advent of Christmas and the festive season. All chefs at the hotel and a few celebrities participate in this traditional event, said Utpal Mondal, executive chef, HHI.

 Beauty tips

 What: Launch of Aroma Magic Chocolate Facial by Blossom Kochhar. 

 Where: The Galaxy at The Park.

 When: November 7.

 Take a Look: The launch kicked off with a workshop presided over by mother-daughter duo Blossom and Samantha Kochhar. More than 200 beauticians lapped up various skincare and make-up tips.

 Samantha demonstrated bridal make-up on model Tanushree. In a bridal make-up, spend a good amount of time on the eyes, a bit of here and there and you can lose it. Kathakali eyes are not happening any more, the beauty expert cautioned. 

 Blossom introduced Chocolate Facials for oily and dry skin types. I was into chocolate making and soon realised that chocolate had a nourishing effect on my hands. A lot of research followed and I realised chocolate not only has an exotic value, but excellent toning and lightening properties. We have been using chocolate packs in spas for a long time and a venture like this puts it out in the salon range as well, smiled Blossom. The chocolate pack includes milk, cream, cocoa butter and essential oils like cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, peppered with jasmine and orange.

 Blossoms prescription of essential oils this winter: orange for zest, lavender for relaxation, jasmine to pep you up and sandalwood to calm you down.

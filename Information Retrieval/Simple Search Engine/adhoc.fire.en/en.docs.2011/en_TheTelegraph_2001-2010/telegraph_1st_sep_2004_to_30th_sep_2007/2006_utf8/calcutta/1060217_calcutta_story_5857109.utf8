 Medicos ask for more, services hit 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Services were hit at SSKM Hospital and Medical College and Hospital as junior doctors started a 48-hour ceasework to press for a rise in monthly stipend. 

 The Medical College Junior Doctors? Forum on Thursday said its counterparts at RG Kar and Nil Ratan Sircar medical colleges and hospitals and BC Roy Memorial Hospital for Children would possibly join the agitation from Friday. 

 Forum members threatened to continue the strike till February 20 if the authorities did not give a written assurance by Friday evening on meeting their demands. 

 At SSKM, services in all the departments were affected by the ceasework. According to officers, the number of surgeries fell by 20 per cent. ?Some elective surgeries could not be carried out because of the agitation,? said S.K. Tripathi, medical superintendent.

 Senior trainee nurses were deployed to provide support during surgeries and other treatment and stand in for junior doctors. Sources said both at SSKM and Medical College, non-emergency patients may not be admitted on Friday because of insufficient medical staff.

 House staff, postgraduate and post-doctoral trainees of these medical colleges charged that their monthly stipend is much less than what their counterparts in other states receive. They have demanded a cent percent rise in their stipend.

 ?We get a monthly stipend of Rs 6,340, Rs 6,830 and Rs 7,320 in the first, second and third years, respectively. We pay tuition fees of Rs 1,000 a month and so, our effective stipend is only Rs 5,340 to Rs 6,320,? a forum spokesperson said. 

 Junior doctors at institutes in other states receive considerably more. Those at All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, get a monthly stipend of Rs 22,000, Rs 23,000 and Rs 24,000 in the first, second and third years, respectively. 

 The authorities have hinted at an increase in their stipend but ruled out their demand for 100 per cent hike. ?We are seriously considering their demand. The stipend will definitely be increased but not by 100 per cent,? said Jayasree Mitra, director of medical education. 

 ?But we cannot support their strike. Patients are being harassed,? Mitra added.

 Patients on Thursday had a harrowing time in the emergency wards of the two hospitals. Biseswar Chowdhury, 40, a businessman from Bansdroni, waited from 11 am at the cardiology department. Till 5 pm, no doctor attended to him.

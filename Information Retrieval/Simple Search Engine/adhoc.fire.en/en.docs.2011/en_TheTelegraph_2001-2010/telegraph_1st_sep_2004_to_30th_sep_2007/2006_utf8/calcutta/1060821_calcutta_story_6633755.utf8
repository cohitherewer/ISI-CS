 To preserve and restore old books and files of the Raj Bhavan library and record room, the Centre for Development of Advance Computing (C-DAC), a government of India undertaking, has taken up a major library digitisation project.

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee unveiled the digitisation project on Independence Day. Raj Bhavan officers said Governor Gopal Krishna Gandhi took the initiative to get the digitisation project through.

 According to the governors wish, our plan is to digitise books and files till 1947. We have already started the process and expect to finish it in a couple of months, librarian Uma Majumdar told Metro on Sunday.

 She said the primary aim of the project is to preserve priceless books and records with the use of information technology. Books and records often get damaged with time. Included among these are some books that have gone out of print. Computerisation will make these books available to the readers all the time, she added.

 The library has a collection of about 7,000 books and 16,000 files, of which about 1,000 books and 1,300 files will be digitised. The process is expected to take about six months to be completed.

 Over the years, the library has grown in size and has been enriched by the personal collections of the past governors and their initiative and interest in collecting books for the library. 

 Some of these books that find their place in the library include rare titles such as The Works of Sir William Jones (1799) and The Ruins of Gour (1870). 

 Similarly, the Raj Bhavan Record Room has more than 16,000 invaluable files. These files contain records and documents of immense historical value relating to some of the important events that took place during the tenure of different governors-general and governors of both pre-Independence and post-Independence Bengal.

 Extensive curative and scientific conservation, cataloguing and shelving of the books are also on the cards with the help of the State of the West Bengal government, National Library, National of India and Khuda Baksh Oriental Library of Patna. 

 They will provide specialised help in restoring the library archives and preserving the documents and books.

 We are in the process of preparing the metadata, which is a computerised form of database. Itll have all the bibliographical information about the books. This will furnish the students and scholars with some basic information like the name of the author of the book, the year in which it was written and other such information, added Majumdar.

 Act leash on schools

 - Key clause to give government the right to punitive action

 MITA MUKHERJEE 

 An Act is on the cards to regulate around 350 ICSE and CBSE schools in the city and districts. A key clause will, for the first time, empower the state government to take punitive action against such institutions.

 Academics and school administrators are examining a proposal to formulate an Act for private English-medium schools. We will soon be in a position to announce our decision, said school education minister Partha De.

 The bill would be tabled in the next session of the Assembly, stressed department officials.

 At present, the government does not have the power to take penal measures against private schools even if there are proven irregularities in their mode of functioning.

 A 13-member committee, set up by the government last year to chalk out measures to regulate ICSE and CBSE schools, submitted its report last month. It proposed the formulation of an Act to establish control over the schools.

 The panel was set up in July 2005 following a string of complaints of irregularities by guardians and teachers. Most of the complaints were regarding poor infrastructure and high tuition fees.

 According to officials, the drafting of the bill is almost complete. The government is exploring ways to introduce special regulations concerning Anglo-Indian schools. Once it is passed, the government will aim to enforce the legislation by next year, said a senior official.

 After the committee submitted its report, the authorities of Anglo-Indian schools had offered a string of suggestions to the government stressing the need to protect the minority rights of the 69 Anglo-Indian institutions. We are examining the suggestions closely, added the senior official. 

 The Anglo-Indian schools should not be clubbed with any other category of schools. There should be a separate provision in the Act for the Anglo-Indian schools. We have made this clear to the government, asserted J.K. Sen, principal, Julien Day School (Ganganagar), and general secretary of Association of Heads of Anglo-Indian Schools. He was part of the 13-member panel.

 The Anglo-Indian schools have supported the government move to table the bill. But they do not want to be clubbed with institutions run by private trusts, agencies and individuals in the bill.

 A fine blend of couture and canvas, 

 combined for a cause. That, in a nutshell, describes The 

 Art and Design Show put together by Canvas Unlimited. 

 On Saturday, the banquets of the 

 Hyatt Regency Calcutta will witness a fashion and art gala 

 featuring works of some big names in both fields.

 Renowned designers in the fields 

 of apparel, jewellery, and accessories will showcase their 

 designs. Fashion biggies Sabyasachi Mukherjee, Rohit Bal, 

 Shantanu Goenka, Rohit Gandhi amp; Rahul Khanna, Anita 

 Dongre, Monisha Thahryamal, Raj and Neetu of Ravage, Anjalee 

 amp; Arjun Kapoor will display their creations.

 Jewellery designers Alka Javeri, 

 Abhishek Haritwal and Falguni Mehta, lifestyle and accessories 

 labels Shawlwart, Bea Accessories and Bags, and Window Passions 

 will also be part of the day-long extravaganza.

 Fashion will go hand-in-hand with 

 art in the show with artists like Sekhar Roy, Ananta Mandal, 

 Asit Sarkar, Avisankar Mitra, Subroto Sen, Sudipta Tewari, 

 Saikat Patra and Bibekananda Santra displaying their works 

 at the event.

 The show will highlight the efforts 

 of Ekal Vidyalaya Indias foremost national 

 organisation dedicated to rural education among backward 

 sections of society as it takes forward its mission 

 to connect the urban with the rural and, in the process, 

 the mind with the heart of India.

 The proceeds from the event will 

 go towards the Friends of Tribals Society (FTS) or Vanabandhu 

 Parishad, a society dedicated to the cause of tribal Indians 

 since 1989 and a pioneer in tribal uplift, striving 

 to make a difference in the lives of over eight crore tribal 

 brethren.

 The event will be unveiled with 

 a special auction by silent bidding at 9.30 

 am on Saturday for a very select audience. The 

 participants of the show have donated a work each for the 

 auction that will double as preview.

 Canvas Unlimited, as the 

 name suggests, is an unlimited expression of talent from 

 across the country. It is an effort to galvanise more people 

 to come forward and associate themselves with a serious 

 cause, said Sumedha Bansal from Canvas Unlimited. 

 We will showcase some of 

 the finest designers and artists and continue to tap the 

 unlimited potential of the countrys fraternity year 

 after year, added Sweta Tantia.

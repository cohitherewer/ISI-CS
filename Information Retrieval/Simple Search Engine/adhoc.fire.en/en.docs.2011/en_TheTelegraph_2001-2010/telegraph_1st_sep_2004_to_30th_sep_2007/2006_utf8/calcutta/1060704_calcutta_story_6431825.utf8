 Con man conned in revolver deal

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Tamal Chakraborty, a tour operator in New Barrackpore, was arrested on Monday for selling a nine-mm revolver to Bhaskar Mukherjee. The television investment guru and his father Smriti were arrested in Balasore on Saturday for allegedly duping over 100 small investors of crores. 

 The revolver, which was found in the Balasore hideout of the Mukherjees, is country-made and does not cost more than Rs 30,000. Police believe Bhaskar was conned into paying Rs 1.2 lakh for the weapon.

 The two had bought a house in Balasore and had planned to move in on Sunday. Records of fixed deposits of Rs 1.2 crore, Rs 2.8 lakh in cash and postal instruments worth a few lakh rupees were found in their hideout.

 Calcutta Police have decided to move court to ensure that the money is returned to the people who had allegedly been defrauded by Bhaskar.

 ?The people who have suffered losses are desperate to get their money back and even we are keen on it. We are working with legal experts to appeal to court for distributing the money among Bhaskar?s victims,? said city detective chief Gyanwant Singh.

 The 31-year-old had started a company named Biniyog in November 2005. Drawn by his television credentials, many invested in the share market through the start-up. Smriti helped out in the operation. The duo first started avoiding customers and then disappeared from the city in May. 

 Bhaskar lured those who watched his programme into investing through his company by promising interest rates between five and 20 per cent per month. Over 100 investors put in at least Rs 2 crore in the stock market on his advice. The television stock market expert provided the promised returns for the first few months, drawing more clients in the process.

 Before he started the company, Bhaskar used to charge Rs 5,000 from those who approached him for tips. ?When we told him that his tips were not working, he said he was too busy handling the big portfolios,? stated Sudip Saha, who had invested through Biniyog.

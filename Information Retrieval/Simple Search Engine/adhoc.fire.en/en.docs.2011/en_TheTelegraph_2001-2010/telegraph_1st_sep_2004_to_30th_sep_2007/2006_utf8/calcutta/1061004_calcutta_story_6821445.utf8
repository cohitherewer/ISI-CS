The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 1,500-cr hub for transport

 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE

 Undeterred by Opposition protests over acquisition of agricultural land for Tatas small-car factory, the chief minister has cleared a 250-acre integrated transport complex in Rajarhat. It will cost around Rs 1,500 crore.

 The transport department has joined hands with two firms to implement the project, named Paribahan Nagar. A consortium of Hyderabad-based Southern Engineering Works and Prasad Infrastructure Development will be the Transport Infrastructure Development Corporations (TIDC) partner.

 The cabinet showed the green light to the departments proposal last month. The name of the complex speaks for itself. Paribahan Nagar will be the first of its kind in the country. Everything related to transportation and automobiles will be available on the premises, stated transport minister Subhas Chakraborty.

 The department decided to go for a joint venture as the government is not in a position to fund such a huge project, explained the minister.

 Officials of TIDC said the consortium was selected through an open tender and after assessment of its efficiency and financial capacity.

 According to the agreement, the companies will invest the entire cost of the project, while TIDC will assist in procurement of land and provide administrative and other support. The consortium will also share its income from the complex with the department.

 Within the complex, a truck terminus will be built on 50 acres, with facilities to park at least 500 trucks. Warehouses, bus terminuses, vehicle showrooms, malls, wholesale markets, weigh bridges, petrol pumps, emission test centres, rest houses, eateries and entertainment centres for truck operators, drivers, their help and traders will take up the rest of the space.

 As part of the deal, the consortium will also build, with its own money, a 10-lane road connecting Jessore Road with New Town.

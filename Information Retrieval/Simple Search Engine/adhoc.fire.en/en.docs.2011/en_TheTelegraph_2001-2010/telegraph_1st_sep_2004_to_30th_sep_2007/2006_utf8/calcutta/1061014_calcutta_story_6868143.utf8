The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Star upkeep huddle

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The sudden shower in the Star wings that cut short chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees speech and caused quite a flutter has thrown up more questions than answers about the upkeep of the revamped theatre address.

 The task of maintenance was transferred to Priya Entertainment on September 1, when the company took charge of the theatre. But the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) could have played a part in Thursdays flash flood, as civic work was pending at the Bidhan Sarani hall.

 According to the conditions of the leasing-out of Star, maintenance was entrusted to the private company. But Priya Entertainment had drawn the Corporations attention to some problems, like water leaks. There also seems to be some structural defect in the outflow of stagnant rainwater which will be addressed, deputy mayor Kalyan Mukherjee told Metro on Friday. 

 The problems will be discussed at a meeting involving mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya, CMC officials and Arijit Dutta of Priya Entertainment at the civic headquarters on Saturday.

 There are some defects and unfinished work which have to be looked into. All this will be taken up in Saturdays meeting, said Dutta.

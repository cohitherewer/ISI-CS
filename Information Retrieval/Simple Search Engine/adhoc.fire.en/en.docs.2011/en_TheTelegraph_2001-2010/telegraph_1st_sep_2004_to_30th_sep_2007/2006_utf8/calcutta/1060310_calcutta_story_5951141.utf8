 Dutt?s the way

 Sanjay Dutt with Simi Garewal

 He can hardly be accused of being media-savvy. In fact, Sanjay Dutt has often tried to avoid the media glare which in turn has refused to avoid him. This Sunday at 9.30 pm on STAR World, though, ?Baba? shares the ordeals he has undergone at almost every step, in a Rendezvous with Simi Garewal.

 From his fight with drug addiction, the on-going serial blast case, the trauma he went through in jail, his mother?s illness, his wife?s death, and of course the special bond he shared with his father, Sanju talks about it all on the show.

 On his drug habit, Sanjay recalls how he took to it just as a style statement. ?When I came back from boarding school in college it was just the in thing,? he recalls. ?That time somebody said try it and I tried it and that was it for nine years of my life.?

 He did not give it up during the rehab, but on the day he threw the drug vendor out of his home. ?It was that one second I had to decide ? either I take it or tell him to get lost and I chose the latter. That day I knew it... I had won that battle. I did not want to get back into the nine years of hell,? the Khalnayak star says.

 Sometimes the chat gets emotional. ?Every day dad used to come and meet me in jail and used to tell me kal ho jayega and this went on for three to four months,? Sanjay says, ?and I just broke down. And told him, dad kab hoga, when? And it was for the first time he held me by my collar, with tears in his eyes, and told me, ?Sanju I can?t do anything, I am sorry son?. I went to my cell, I cried for four-five hours, but after that I said nothing is going to make me break.?

 When asked why does it happen to him every time, a smiling Sanjay says, ?Maybe I am the chosen one.?

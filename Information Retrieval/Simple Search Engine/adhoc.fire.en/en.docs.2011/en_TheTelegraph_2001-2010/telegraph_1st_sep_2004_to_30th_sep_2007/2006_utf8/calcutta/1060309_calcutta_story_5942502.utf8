The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Fog drives away four flights

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Four Calcutta-bound flights, including two from abroad, were diverted to Dhaka and Bhubaneswar and several were rescheduled on Wednesday morning because of dense fog over the airport. 

 Among those stranded at the airport was Sourav Ganguly (picture on left by Gautam Bose), whose early-morning flight to Delhi was rescheduled to the evening. The former Indian skipper?s car had left the airport by then, so he had to take a taxi to Taj Bengal, where it was waiting.

 The airlines affected by the fog included British Airways, Druk Air, Gulf Air, Indian, Jet Airways, Air Sahara and Air Deccan.An airport official said visibility had dropped to 50 metres in the morning. ?For take-off or landing, pilots need a minimum visibility of 550 metres on the runway.?

 Met officials said chances of fog on Thursday were slim.

 Deputy director-general at the Alipore Met office J.V.M. Naidu explained that moisture over the runway could not shift on Wednesday as there was no wind. ?The heat from the land dissipated quickly on Tuesday night as the sky was clear. The accumulated moisture turned to fog in the morning.?

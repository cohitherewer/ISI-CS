The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 The decorative tiles that were laid on footpaths in the central office and market areas in the city have started showing their true colours. Though just a few months old, most of them are coming loose. Taking advantage of this, the roadside vendors have started using these tiles as legs for their makeshift stalls. This can be seen on a particular stretch of Chowringhee, in front of Lindsay Street, and further towards Esplanade. In a way, it is good that the vendors are using the broken tiles, or else pedestrians would be tripping over them on the busy pavements. The civic board should come up with a better, lasting alternative for doing up the the pavement surface.

 On December 23, my car stopped at the traffic signal at the JL Nehru Road-SN Banerjee Road crossing. I saw an ambulance carrying a patient stuck behind a queue of vehicles. Though the ambulance?s siren was continuously playing none of the traffic policemen manning the spot came forward to clear the way for it. A similar story was seen repeated at the Lenin Sarani crossing too. When the policemen are trained to give priority to VIPs, why can?t they be instructed to clear the way for ambulances?

 The squatters along railway tracks from Ballygunge to Tollygunge were evacuated, ostensibly, for the sake of the environment. But now the railway authorities are chopping big trees near Tollygunge station that the squatters had probably planted years ago. Is this also for the environment? 

 Tapan Pal,

 Budge Budge.

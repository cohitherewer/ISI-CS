 Colourful contrasts

 Contrasting individual styles, set against a variety of themes, moods and hues, is the hallmark of Colours on Canvas, the ongoing exhibition of figurative works by well-known artists. Subrata Gangopadhyays portrayal of a bejewelled young woman (appears left) has been done in his typical style, with an eye to detail. Sanatan Dinda attracts attention with his stark, life-like painting of a woman with vermilion smeared on her forehead. Ashoke Mullick is remarkable for the unique balance of his vibrant canvases. Manoj Duttas pastel on canvas stands out for its symbolic content, depicting birds, flowers, leaves and a vase in a robust, folk style. A similar feel is expressed in K. Muralidharans work though his style is more subdued and solemn. Dwijen Guptas Eternal Love in pen and ink deserves mention as the only black-and-white work amongst a colourful canvas collection. Also featuring works of Partha Bhattacharjee, Sekhar Roy, Sekhar Kar, Suman Chowdhury, Suman Roy and Manoj Mitra.

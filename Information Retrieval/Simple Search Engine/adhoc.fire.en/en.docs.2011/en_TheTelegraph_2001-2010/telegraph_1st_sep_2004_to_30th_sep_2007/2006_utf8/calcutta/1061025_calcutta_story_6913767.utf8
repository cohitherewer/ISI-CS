The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

On amp; Off

Lucky seven for Ghai

Screen On amp; Off

 Pop pick: Salman Khan

 After two duds in a row Yaadein and Kisna Subhash Ghai will now return to direction with two back-to-back projects. The first one titled Black N White, to be made under the Mukta Searchlight banner, will start by November 21, introduce a new hero Anurag Sinha and star Anil Kapoor in a stellar role.

 The other project is the real biggie. To star Salman Khan and two big heroines who are yet to be cast, this Rs 30-crore film under Mukta Arts Entertainment will be shot from mid-April 2007 for next Diwali release. A.R. Rahman will score the music for the film. 

 Apart from these two directorial ventures, Ghai will produce five other films in the coming year. Nagesh Kukunoor will direct Bombay 2 Bangkok while his chief assistant Shashi Sudigala will make Cycle Kick for Ghais Mukta Searchlight Films. The other three directors confirmed are Anees Bazmi, Anurag Basu and Abbas Mustan. The cast and crew of the films are under finalisation and will be announced at a later date.

 Its high time that we focus on good stories and scripts rather than mere proposal making, said Subhash Ghai. All the projects and stories with its respective team and genre of the film have been very carefully chosen and I predict three new stars shining and making it big in 2007.

 Discovery dudes: Rahul Khanna and 

 Sanjay Suri

 The aim is to help them navigate the channel better, highlight the channels programme variety and seek appointment viewing, says the channels associate director, marketing and communications, Rajiv Bakshi.

 Discovery Week will also showcase exclusive and entertaining behind-the-scenes footage hosted by actor Rahul Khanna.

Though I am mostly into news and sitcoms, I have always been a huge fan of Discovery, he says, explaining why he picked up another television assignment though his focus is now on films. 

 The bonus will be studio-interviews and on-site interactions with experts who will share their experiences on the subjects covered on Discovery Channels programmes.

 The personalities who will feature in the first few episodes include film-maker Ketan Mehta and his take on Discovery Marquee a reconstruction of some of the most fascinating historical epics featuring the likes of Hannibal, Genghis Khan and Jim Corbett.

 Actor Sanjay Suri recollects his real-life experience similar to that of the nine-year old boy Arif, featured in Floating Lamp of The Shadow Valley. The film explores the world of young Arif a victim of terror and his desires, aspirations and indomitable spirit. 

 Again, sharing her views on Discoverys Womans Theme Night special Runway Moms will be television host and actor Malaika Arora Khan. Each episode of Runway Moms highlights a model mom-to-be and her unique pregnancy story like choosing between natural and medicated births, midwives and doctors, prenatal yoga and more.

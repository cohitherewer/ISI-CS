Metal mayhem in the bedroom

Feng Shui Matters 

Pinky Kapoor

Q: 

We have just shifted to a new house and all our furniture, including the bed, 

is made of wrought iron. I am married for the past two years, but am still childless. 

Someone told me that wrought iron is not good for the home and for a happy married 

life. Please let me know whether this is true. If yes, please suggest a way out.

Dirghayu Oza

THE SOLUTION: Feng Shui is all about a balanced 

environment where all the five elements of nature are introduced in a balanced 

way. 

Having too much of metal in the form of wrought iron 

could weigh heavy on the family members, especially ones who are already loaded 

with this element at the time of their birth. 

As the date and time of birth of your family members 

are not known to me, I would suggest you to balance the metal element with water 

and wood elements and their associated colours like green and blue. Placing fresh 

green plants close to the heavy metal furniture will instantly soothe its heavy 

effect. 

You can comfortably place the metal furniture in the 

north, west and north-west areas of the house and keep the east and south-east 

areas clear of this element. Metal cuts down the ruling wood elements of east 

and south-east areas that are connected with health and wealth.

 Career chaos

Q: I was born 

on 29.10.1984. I took my B.Com final exams this year. Despite having a good educational 

background, my career is not moving ahead. I have also given my CA inter exams 

this year. I dont have any particular study corner in my room. I also suffer 

from immense mood swings. Please suggest ways that will enhance my earning capacity 

and ensure a secure future.

THE SOLUTION: Your pillars of destiny reveal 

that you are a weak fire person and you are presently passing through the water 

period. Water brings unnecessary pressure on fire people, especially if they are 

weak. This is the cause of your suffering from immense mood swings and mental 

pressure. 

But this period will also give you positive results 

where you could succeed in your studies and become a professional. Your fire element 

is being strengthened from next year, which promises a bright future with financial 

gain. 

You must study facing your auspicious direction, which 

is north-east. Surround yourself with shades of green to nourish your weak fire 

self.

 Jewel jam 

Q: We own 

a branded jewellery outlet in a south-east-facing room in Guwahati. For the past 

five years, it has not given us any profit as the sales and footfall are very 

low. The market building inside which the store is housed also faces the south-east. 

The entrance to our shop is in the south-east and we have placed the cash box 

in this direction, too. Please advise us where to create a puja area. Also provide 

a solution to the problem. My date of birth is 15.08.1969.

Kaveri Goswami

THE SOLUTION: According to your pillars of 

destiny, you are a strong water person. You need to be balanced with wood and 

fire elements. Your showroom started when you were in your favourable wood period, 

which meant expansion for you. 

But soon after that from the year 2002 you entered 

into the water period, which aggravated the existing water element and went against 

you. In this period, usually a person struggles through life and faces competition 

and financial loss. 

Fortunately, you will be stepping into the fire period 

from next year, which means there will be a good effortless flow of money in your 

life. 

In the meanwhile, introduce wood element in the showroom 

in the form of fresh green plants and a green doormat near the entrance. Also 

place a fresh growing bamboo plant on top of the cash box with nine metal coins 

or its multiples immersed in it. The temple is best placed in the east or the 

north-east corner.

Business bane

Q: 

 I was involved in my family business of chemicals and general order 

supplies. I was not happy with my work so I decided to venture into coal business 

in partnership with my friend. Now, due to a cash crunch my partner has left me 

and found a new partner who is supporting him financially. As a result, I am left 

with no work. Kindly suggest the kind of work that is best for me. I am an introvert 

and cannot interact with people properly. I was born on 13.09.1982 at 11.14 am.

M.C.

THE SOLUTION: Your pillars of destiny reveal 

that you are a strong earth person and will benefit from any business that is 

connected with metal, water and wood. The business related with metal could be 

iron and steel or computers. Water is connected with lubricants and chemicals 

and wood brings money from furniture, medicines, paper and crops. 

Coal business is associated with the earth element 

that goes against you. It is a blessing in disguise that your friend broke the 

partnership with you. I would suggest that you stick to your family business. 

From 2007 onwards you will be under the influence of water element, which will 

bring a windfall for you.

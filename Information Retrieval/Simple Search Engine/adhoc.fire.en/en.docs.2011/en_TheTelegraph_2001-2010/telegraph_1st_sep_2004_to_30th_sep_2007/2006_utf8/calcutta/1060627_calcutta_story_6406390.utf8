 It was a mixture of protest and 

 celebration at the start of Rainbow Pride Week in Calcutta 

 on Sunday, marked by a considerable turnout. Various community 

 leaders elaborated on the line-up for the week at a meeting, 

 after which around 150 activists gathered by the Mahatma 

 Gandhi statue on the Maidan and marched to Nandan. The walk, 

 one-of-its-kind in India, heralds a week of programmes ranging 

 from staging of The Alien Flower ? India?s first 

 ballet on the subject of same-sex love ? to film screenings 

 at the Pratyay Resource Centre in Jodhpur Park.

 The name Rainbow was particularly apt considering the wide cross-section of people who attended the march ? transexuals, homosexuals and heterosexual sympathisers. The majority of the participants were in their 20s, actively taking part to put forth their position on the generally taboo subject.

 A multitude of issues inspired the march, but the prominent one was the repeal of the Indian Penal Code Section 377. At a gathering prior to the walk, representatives from Amitie, UNAIDS and Solidarity and Action Against The HIV Infection in India (SAATHII) voiced their concerns about the continuing implementation of a legislation that dates back to the 19th Century. Pawan Dhall of SAATHII pointed out that ?the country that put this law into practice in India in colonial times abolished it many years ago. Surely an independent India should not still be using such outdated legislation.?

 Anis Rai Chaudhuri of Chandernagore-based Amitie echoed: ?This law is often an excuse for some people to abuse individuals from India?s LGBT community. Today?s march is designed to bring awareness about this injustice.?

 There was a minimal police presence at the march, which was enthusiastic yet orderly. While avoiding discussion on gay rights, an inspector of Calcutta Police explained his views about the event: ?It is good to see people addressing the issue of HIV/AIDS. It is becoming an increasing problem here. There have been no problems with the march. It has been a success.?

 While emails circulated by various leaders of the march beforehand strongly asserted that there must not be too much spectacle involved in the event, this did not stop a fairly obvious degree of flamboyance from edging its way into the proceedings.

 Perhaps telling of the problems still faced by India?s LGBT communities, many of the younger participants chose to hide their identities by wearing luminous yellow face masks. Other activists, however, were less preoccupied with identity. Many carried banners and placards as the march progressed.

 Leaflets in English and Bengali were distributed to passers-by, with the attention of many of the Maidan?s Sunday footballers being distracted as the Rainbow Walk made its way towards the Rabindra Sadan complex.

 Global vs local

 The British Council was the venue for a debate, held by the English Studies Centre, that validated Amartya Sen?s conclusions about the positive effects of Indian cultural heterodoxy. The Argumentative Indian theory jumped out of the printed page and was enacted in technicolour animation on June 14. The motion was ?Globalisation is a local disaster?. The arguments put forward in Thomas L. Friedman?s book The World Is Flat was a recurring reference point for teams both for and against the motion.

 Dipak Rudra, a former civil servant, set the tone for the motion by evoking nostalgic images of the India that will be lost with globalisation. ?Local interests are being substituted by the Baristas and KFCs. One need only look at the international flesh and drugs trades to see that not all of it is positive.?

 From the team arguing against the motion, journalist and documentary film-maker Ananya Chatterjee highlighted the advantages of globalisation. She cited an example: ?Following the Gujarat riots, the BJP-led government wanted to impose censorship only on Indian documentaries at the 2004 Mumbai International Film Festival. As the result of an Internet campaign, the censorship clause was revoked.?

 Speaking for the motion, Prof Ishita Mukherjee of CU attacked the ?subordination by developing countries to policies dictated by economically-powerful countries? in response to JU professor Saikat Singha Roy?s assertion that ?full liberalisation must take place to reap the full benefits of globalisation?.

 Neurosurgeon Sandip Chatterjee, however, added fireworks to the debate. Speaking against the motion, Chatterjee surgically demolished the arguments presented by the other side and compared those for the motion to ?well-frogs? that do not believe in anything beyond their immediate surroundings. The audience, however, overwhelmingly voted for the motion.

 Chit Chat

 On screen, with John

 There are a few days left for young guns to grab screenspace with John Abraham. Hungama TV, India?s first Hindi channel for kids, has launched a contest whereby a boy and a girl, between seven and 14 years of age, will get to star in a Hindi film alongside the popular actor. ?Our company will produce a film in which there will be significant roles for the children,? promises Siddharth Roy Kapur, senior vice-president, marketing and communication, UTV.

 More is in store for the winners. 

 There is a booty of Rs 5 lakh, as well as a contract with 

 UTV to manage the budding film careers. Auditions will be 

 held in Mumbai, Delhi, Calcutta, Ahmedabad and Hyderabad. 

 But before that participants have to send in their photographs 

 and fill in a form. Log onto to johnaurkaun.indiatimes.com 

 to download the entry form. A ground event was held 

 at Inox Forum recently to promote the contest where kids 

 lined up to take part in the various games surrounding the 

 contest. ?The response from Calcutta has been good. And 

 no, Hindi has not been a problem,? said Kapur who had come 

 down from Delhi for the event.

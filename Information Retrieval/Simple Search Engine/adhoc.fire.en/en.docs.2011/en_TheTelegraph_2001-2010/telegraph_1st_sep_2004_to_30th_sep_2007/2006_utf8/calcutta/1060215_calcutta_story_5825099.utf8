 What: Kebab and Paratha 

 Festival. 

 Where: Seths Cuisine, 

 The Food Court, 850, Block P, New Alipore.

 When: Till February 28.

 On the menu: The parathas include Aloo, Warqi, Gobi, Mooli, Methi, Pudina, Paneer, Mattar, Onion, Lachha, Kashmiri, Cheese, Dhania and more. All the parathas are accompanied by Kali Dal, salad and pickle.

 Pocket pinch: The dishes are all priced between Rs 50 and Rs 110.

 Voiceover: Kebabs and paratha make a perfect combination in north India. This is our effort to popularise it in Calcutta as well. We have organised individual kebab and paratha festivals earlier, but this is the first time we have brought the two together. And people are already loving it, says owner Sumer Seth.

 New eatery 

 What: Launch of Chinese speciality restaurant Over The Top.

 Where: 49/2, Gariahat Road (behind Pantaloons).

 When: February 8, afternoon.

 Take a look: Spread over an area of 1,000 sq ft, this 68-cover restaurant is done up simply, but tastefully. The widely spaced out seating arrangements make this place an ideal hangout for friends and family.

 On the menu: The restaurant serves the popular Chinese fare. For a complete meal, vegetarians can opt for the Tam Yum Soup and American Corn Salt Pepper as starters. Move to the main course and dig into the Vegetable Singapore Noodles and Vegetable Tempura and Mushroom and Vegetable Tofu.

 Non-vegetarians can start off with Golden Prawns and choose the Chicken Shanghai Noodles along with Chicken in Red Wine or Shredded Lamb with Pepper and Onion. To round off the meal there is the Date Pancake and Toffee Walnut.

 Pocket pinch: A meal for two costs anything between Rs 250 and Rs 300.

 Voiceover: Our restaurant Mirch Masala, next door, has received an overwhelming response from food lovers of Calcutta. We decided to open this eatery because of the number of requests that poured in from our clients for a Chinese restaurant in the area. We have also kept the prices very reasonable, smiles proprietor Ronika Singh.

 Station stop

 What: Second anniversary celebrations of Monginis Food Plaza.

 Where: The food court at Howrah station.

 When: February 9.

 The bash: The sprawling food plaza, the first of its kind in a railway station in eastern India, celebrated its second birthday with a child RJ hunt in association with 93.5 Red FM. The RJs of Red FM handpicked talented children who will get a chance to host programmes on the channel, in addition to winning prizes and certificates. Model Priyanka Pal added the glam factor.

 The occasion also saw the launch of some new sections at the food court and some additions to the menu. The new offerings are a chaat counter, a fresh juice bar and a corn corner. The menu saw additions like the Hyderabadi Mutton Biryani and Hyderabadi Chicken Biryani, priced at Rs 60 and Rs 50 respectively. The eatery boasts Chinese, Indian, Tandoori and south Indian dishes.

 Voiceover: At Monginis, we treat customers like one big family and any celebration is incomplete without the participation of the whole family. So, on our second birthday we decided to give our customers some royal treatment with gifts, goodies and fun galore, said Arnab Basu, managing director of Dream Bake, the parent company of Monginis.

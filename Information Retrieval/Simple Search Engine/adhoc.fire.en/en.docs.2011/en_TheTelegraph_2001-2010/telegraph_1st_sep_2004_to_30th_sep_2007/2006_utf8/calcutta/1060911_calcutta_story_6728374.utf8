 More than 2,000 slogan-shouting pandas on Sunday marched down Kalighat, fearing ouster from the temple premises, as the high court has intervened and is expected to deliver a verdict to ensure smooth functioning of the pilgrimage centre. 

 We will not move out of the temple premises under any circumstances. We will also appeal to the court, if necessary, to allow us to continue working as pandas as we have our families to feed, said Moloy Ghosh Dastidar, chairman of Sathi Brahman Sangathan, a body of pandas.

 Ghosh Dastidar said pandas operating in Kalighat temple also known as Sathi Brahmans do not have any licence. We have issued identity cards to these pandas so that they can be easily identified in case of complaints from devotees, said Ghosh Dastidar.

 Members of Sathi Brahman Sangathan and Kalighat Kalimandir Brahman Sahakarmi Sangathan, another body of pandas, took out the rally around noon along Kali Temple Road. 

 We will submit a memorandum to the Kalighat temple committee on Tuesday, requesting it to consider our demand, said Ghosh Dastidar.

 The temple committee maintained that its primary concern was the safety of the devotees. The matter comes up for hearing in the high court again on Friday.

 Mangal Pandey figures high on the list of Kailash Khers playback achievements 

 He shot to fame with the haunting and melodious Allah ke bande in 2004. He chanted his way into the heart of the audiences with Mangal mangal in 2005. And this year, he is touring the length and breadth of the country to promote his new album. Kailash Kher (in picture by Amit Datta) was at the 107.8 Power FM studio on Saturday afternoon to promote his new album Kailasa that he has cut with two friends, Naresh and Paresh Kamath. 

 I am completely living out of a suitcase. I am part of A.R. Rahmans world tour. Then there are my own concerts and Bollywood engagements. I do not even have time for myself, says the pony-tailed playback from Meerut.

 Kailash insists that his album is not just a compilation of eight songs but the creation of three dedicated musical people. We are quite emotional about the album. Usually an album does not have more than two songs worth listening to. We have made sure that every song in Kailasa presents a distinct feel.

 And yes, he figures in the first video, Teri Deewani, which is currently on air. It has been shot at the Golconda Fort in Hyderabad. The producers shoot the songs on me because they consider me lucky. So, why should I not be a part of my own song? argues Kailash, who is lending his voice to Fanaah, Corporate, Babul and Salaam-e-Ishq.

 Kailash has many songs to his credit but why is he still known for his first, Allah ke bande? I have sung many songs that have gone to become big blockbusters. But Allah ke bande has become my identity. Even when I am walking down the road people address me as Allah ke bande!

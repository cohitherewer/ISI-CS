I know of people just tuning in to see what I am wearing, 

rather than the match! No extras for guessing that this is Mandiraspeak.

Yes, Mandira Bedi is back on the ball and bolder 

than ever before. Her new look in Extraaa Innings for the Champions Trophy, 

a far cry from her zardosi-strappy image of World Cup 03, has generated 

its fair share of pre-Diwali crackle.

Just when tongues were wagging (or drooling) about 

her in-your-face sexuality heavy-duty hairstyle, bare shoulders, cleavage peekaboo 

and all she slipped right back into a familiar sari-and-strappy-blouse look 

on Diwali.

Experimental, saucy, glamorous... Mandiras wardrobe 

this season has had the desired effect like it or lump it, you just have to 

notice it. GoodLife takes a closer look.

The story so far

Mandira Bedi rewrote cricket-viewing history three 

years ago from the studios of Cape Town. She appeared on match-day screen in a 

whole six yards and strappy blouse, talked cricket and made quite a statement. 

She set fashion meters flashing fast, especially with her blouse story hot halters 

to not-there noodles...

And now, Mandy is back in the game. With cricket skills 

honed and a brushover to boot, she is busy boosting the TRP for SET Max.

In World Cup 2003 she flaunted Ritu Kumar saris, in 

Champions Trophy 2004 she slipped into Satya Paul crepes, and this time she is 

sporting Manish Malhotras makeover.

For Bollywoods favourite designer, life came 

full circle with this Mandira assignment. I designed the look for her first 

film Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge and when she came to me two weeks before 

the show, I was more than happy to work with her again, says Manish.

Fashion facts

DDLJ saw Manish giving Mandira the girl-next-door 

look. This time, she looks more like the neighbours sexy wife, to be coveted 

at your own peril.

She wanted to look different from last time, 

to break the sari mould. Thats why we decided to keep the look basically 

Indian, yet boast an international appeal, explains Manish. Many brainstorming 

sessions followed and the result is now out there for all to see and then salivate 

or scowl, covet or cringe.

She has a great body, lovely smile, warm persona 

and, above everything, she is very intelligent. Thats what makes it tick, 

adds Manish. And its all showing the sporting purist would grumble too 

much is showing.

Manish picks highlights from Mandiras Champions 

Trophy look, for GoodLife:

All the ensembles are India-centric.

The fabric story is varied theres georgette, 

silk, cotton, velvet and net.

The colours follow a scheme. We began with nudes, 

gold, beige and salmon pinks but as the series progresses, we see her in brighter 

shades like turquoise and red.

Lots of skirts, dresses and corsets.

The detailing is a melange. Different forms of embroidery, 

prints and sequins interplay to create the desired effect. We also developed 

some Rajasthani embroidery as a printing block for one of her outfits.

Her accessories are not OTT (over the top). Pretty 

earrings or a string of beads, thats it.

Shes done hair and make-up herself as by 

now she knows what works for her.

Glamorous is the one word that describes her 

new look, concludes Manish.

Viewer voice

Serious cricket devotees have been joined by ma 

and mashi to frown on the all-glam look of Mandy baby. 

This time, shes overdone it with the corset dress code. Maybe 

she felt her earlier image had become too staid and it needed to be sexed up further 

to hook the TV viewer. I feel the sari suits her and the occasion better, 

grumbles an ex-cricketer not wanting to be named.

But for every grumble or gripe, theres a gape 

or grin. Mandira has brought a dash of glamour in the good ol proceedings 

of good ol cricket. She has hiked up the oomph quotient for sure and her 

sense of fusion style is great, feels percussionist-actor Bickram Ghosh.

Not only men, women too have given the nod. Says designer 

Agnimitra Paul: Shes looking refreshingly different. There was an 

overdose of saris last season; this time Manish has got it right. It complements 

the festive mood of the season.

Mandiraspeak

With the earlier editions of Extraaa Innings 

I had broken the rule of women having nothing to do with cricket. So during 

the first few episodes, there was a lot of skepticism on not only what I was doing 

there but also about what I wore. But now, no one criticises what I wear but they 

review it and expect me to wear something exciting everyday!

This time I am wearing a lot of organzas, tissue, 

nets and crepes. Manish was on top of my wishlist. He had a lot of commitments 

but he said Id love to do your clothes.

Thanks to Manish, I am wearing a lot of dresses on 

the show. I have never worn dresses on TV before. But there is an Indian feel 

somewhere. All the clothes have an Indian theme with a Western concept. I have 

been wearing lovely brocade skirts. For Diwali, I am wearing a sari and for Id, 

too, Ill wear something Indian.

The other thing I am excited about this time is my 

hair. I used to have curly hair when I started out and then I straightened it 

out and now I have it back after so many moons. Bhajji (Harbhajan Singh) will 

make it a point to compliment me everyday about my hair. I am really excited!

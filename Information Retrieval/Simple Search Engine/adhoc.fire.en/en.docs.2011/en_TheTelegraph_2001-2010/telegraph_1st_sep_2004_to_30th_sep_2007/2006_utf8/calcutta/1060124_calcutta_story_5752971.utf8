 After a brief break, the GoodLife Talk Show was back this week, in an all-new avatar. Moving out of residential complexes, the event this Sunday returned at a new time and place. 

 The venue was Little Angels Montessori House of Children in New Alipore, and it was held in the morning instead of the evening, so the tiny tots could accompany their parents. 

 On the panel were actress June and paediatrician Dr Chayan Ganguly. The topic was Parenting and Childcare.

 While the parents picked up tips from the speakers, the kids were busy enjoying themselves with diversions provided in the form of colourful balloons, candy treats, popcorn and fancy caps.

 Moderated by Rita Bhimani, the Q amp;A session opened to a packed house. She started off by asking the doctor if it was right on the part of todays parents to send their wards to school at the tender age of one-and-a-half years.

 I really do not think so. A child hardly has any mental development at this stage to fully understand whats going on around him or her. Lessons in school, even in a Montessori, should be totally out of the question. If there is no option for the parents to leave their children back home while at work, they should consider a play school at the most, stressed Dr Ganguly.

 A group of young working mothers admitted that they felt guilty going to work and leaving their little ones at home. 

 With the kind of society we live in now, it has become very important for both parents to work. And if you look around, you will find that a lot of people are managing it with great ease. Certain compromises have to be made and maybe you cannot have the kind of social life you had before. Squeeze out as much time as possible from your day and when you come back home, be with your child, advised Rita.

 She added: Never feel guilty about going to work, because its as important as your child. Gradually you will see that your child, too, is adjusting to your schedule. Also, remember that bringing up your child is not your responsibility alone. The father should contribute equally. If he does not feel guilty when leaving for work, why should you?

 June, who walked in 45 minutes late looking lovely in a simple white dress, joined in the discussion without much ado. Rita directed a question at her, asking the actress to share her experiences of bringing up two kids despite her busy schedule.

 When I started off with acting, my kids were very young. I, too, would suffer from guilt pangs about not being able to spare enough time for my children, she admitted. 

 This even prompted me to give up working for six months. But those six months gave me the surprise of my life. I found that my kids did not have any time for me at all. They had set a routine for themselves and they didnt seem to miss me not being around. It was such a huge revelation that it helped me get back to work with a greater zeal. So, your children also learn to adjust and it is not as big a problem as it is made out to be, she smiled.

 The issue of the advantages of staying in a joint family came up quite quickly during the interaction. 

 Grandparents have a big role to play in the upbringing of a child. It is sad that a lot of young couples these days consider them backdated. To those who think so, I would like to say that a lot of grandparents might not have had a fancy education, but they have seen the world much more than you. It is their experience that comes in handy when bringing up your child. And no governess would take more care of your child than them, said the doctor, with Rita promptly agreeing. 

 The debate included the variety of problems parents face when admitting their children into schools. The panelists answered the queries with help from Arpita Bose, principal of Little Angels.

 The session came to a close a little over an hour later, with a discussion on the importance of Montessori education. They work as a great preparatory base, but without the pressure of grades. They also allow children to see the outer world for the first time along with others their own age, summed up both Rita and June.

 Higher than hoops

 - Teen talent tripped by poverty

 SHOOTING STAR: Sukurmani Oraon hones her skills. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya

 She has been slam-dunking her way to victory for the past three years, playing at the state-level in three categories ? mini, youth and junior ? in the same year. 

 Fifteen-year-old Sukurmani Oraon is a rising star in the world of basketball. And this tribal girl from Jharkhand, who stays with her aunt in a slum off Swami Vivekananda Road in Howrah, has had to fight harder than most for success. 

 Her aunt works as a domestic help, while Sukurmani studies in Class IX of Howrah Siksha Sadan. When she is not in school, she is busy doing household chores. But as soon as the clock strikes 4.30 pm, she slips into her jersey and sneakers and heads for the Howrah Basketball Coaching Centre in Dumurjala. 

 ?My first exposure to basketball was through my uncle, who represented the state in the game. I would accompany him to the court every evening and watch kids shoot baskets. Three years ago, I decided to try my hand at basketball,? recalls Sukurmani.

 By the next year, she was playing in the nationals. She represented Bengal in the mini national championship, youth national championship and junior national championship in 2005. Her family?s financial situation, however, is becoming an impediment to her pursuit of basketball glory. 

 ?The fact that she has stuck to the sport for three years is surprising and speaks a lot for her talent. For children like her, it is very difficult to pursue any sport, leave alone basketball. She comes from a very poor family and lacks nutrition and family support,? feels her coach Aloke Banerjee.

 ?Despite the odds, she has performed well and played for the state in various categories in the same year. She has also participated in the national camp at Ludhiana. But I do not know how long she will be able to continue with basketball,? he adds.

 Sukurmani, who plays in an attacking position, wants to rise higher than the hoop. ?I know one thing: basketball will help me, even off the court. So, I will pursue it at any cost,? asserts the youngster. 

 Whenever she is selected for a tournament, her coach and other well-wishers take care of clothes and footwear. ?She does not even have a power connection at home. We cannot expect her to buy the expensive footwear required for the game. But we also cannot let the talent fade away,? says Banerjee.

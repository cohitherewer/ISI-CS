 You share your birthday with...

 Queen Elizabeth II

 You have great enthusiasm and live life to the fullest. Sometimes, compromise is tough for you. You have a subtle magnetism. You need greater self-discipline to funnel your creative enthusiasm into specifics. You are not too good at savings. You are a good speaker but often lack tact. ? Kusum Bhandari

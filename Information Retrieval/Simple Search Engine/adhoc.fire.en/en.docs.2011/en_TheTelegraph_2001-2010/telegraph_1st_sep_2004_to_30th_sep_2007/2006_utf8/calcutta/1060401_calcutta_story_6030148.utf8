 Sir Gary Sobers and the rest of the Calypso heroes had paid a visit to this address on the evening of that fateful day when the Eden Gardens was on fire. They had turned up to thank the management for rescuing petrified team-mate Charlie Griffith, and ended up digging into the sumptuous spread of Tandoori Chicken and Brain Masala.

 Dara Singh and his grapple gang had gorged on the trademark Rogan Josh and Barra Kebab when they were in town as Calcutta was introduced to competitive wrestling in 1960.

 The late Rajiv Gandhi is known to have made a dash from the airport for his favourite north Indian fare when in town for his night sortie flights.

 After dishing out delicacies to foodies at home and beyond for half a century now, the Amber group is gearing up to mark its golden jubilee in style. Kicking off on October 9, there will be a three-week-long celebration.

 We started our food trek with Sagar in 1956, two years after the West End Hotel was opened. But Amber is really our flagship restaurant and gives us our identity, stresses owner S.K. Khullar, who along with elder brother (late) Rajpal Khullar, had launched the popular eatery in 1959.

 In keeping with Ambers stature and popularity ? 80 per cent of all Tandoor dishes served all over the country today was created by our chef Nanak Chand, runs the claim ? most of the groups celebration plans are being drawn up at the 11 Waterloo Street address. The idea is to take a trip down memory lane and recreate some of the old ambience which made Amber what it is, says S.K. Khullar.

 The management is planning a Senior Citizens evening, when food and drinks would be served at a 50 per cent discount in keeping with the mood of the 50th anniversary celebrations, according to son Sanjay Khullar, director of the restaurant. There would be a special treat for the kids as well. We had realised even in the 60s that if you pamper the children, they would drag their parents back to our property, smiles Khullar Senior.

 The history of Amber and its chemistry with Calcutta will also be traced in an audio-visual presentation, to be laced with quotable quotes from significant patrons. Not many among todays generation know that when we took over the premises in 1959, it used to house the Central Hotel, which boasted the citys oldest excise licence, reveals S.K. Khullar. He remembers giving Griffith a lift in his car from outside Eden and dropping him off at the Great Eastern Hotel.

 While the British-style bar on the ground floor was retained, the few rooms on the first floor were renovated. The new building was constructed in phases and completed in 1967. The pioneering centralised kitchen supplies food to the four floors of Amber, the two floors of Sagar down the street, the two takeaway counters at Waterloo Street and Gol Park, besides Calcutta Swimming Club, Saturday Club and the outdoor catering services.

 While its no secret that the late Indira Gandhi always had her favourite Tandoori Chicken and Chicken Butter Masala parcelled from Amber whenever she was in the vicinity, other political luminaries like Mujibur Rahman, Morarji Desai, Jyoti Basu and Atal Bihari Vajpayee have all savoured the fabled Amber fare as well. Cricket greats from MAK Pataudi to Sunil Gavaskar have also dropped in more than once to dine here. We would like to acknowledge the unstinting support we have received from one and all that has helped us grow, says S.K. Khullar.

 A special guest list is being drawn up, while the management plans to call the industry over during the celebrations to share the Amber glow. However, our most important guests remain our patrons in Calcutta who have been with us through rain and shine, concludes Sanjay Khullar.

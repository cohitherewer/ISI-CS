 Centre for lonely children

 DEBASISH CHATTOPADHYAY

 Children of working parents are often forced to spend the majority of the day in front of the television or in the company of the maid. Come June, they can have a better time after school, thanks to Ashiana. 

 Being opened at Hindustan Park by Innocent Smiles, the centre will play host to children in the afternoon till their parents get back from work. The kids can, meanwhile, play a sport, learn an art or simply finish homework. 

 ?It is modern-day babysitting. We plan to provide an atmosphere where children will feel at home. We will remain open from 2 pm to 7 pm. Parents can either drop the children at the centre or we can pick them up from their schools,? explained Gunjan Tibrawalla, director of Innocent Smiles. 

 ?There was a time when grandparents or other members of a joint family would take care of the children if the parents went out to work. This is not possible in the modern nuclear families. Our programme has been designed to take care of the emotional needs of children,? he added.

 Children between 6 and 13 will be eligible for admission at the centre. Apart from lessons in various sports like roller-skating, taekwondo, table tennis, football, basketball and cricket, Ashiana proposes to organise classes on music, arts and crafts, dance, dramatics, computer and communication. Trained teachers will be at hand to help the children complete their homework. Facilities for swimming and tennis might be introduced if enough children are interested.

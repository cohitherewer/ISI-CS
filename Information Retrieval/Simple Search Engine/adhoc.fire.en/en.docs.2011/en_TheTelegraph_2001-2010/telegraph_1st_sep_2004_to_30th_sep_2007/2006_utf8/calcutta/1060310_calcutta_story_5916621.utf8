 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has decided to set up an urban arts commission, on the lines of the one in Delhi, to preserve the ambience in the older areas of the city, and to maintain an aesthetic balance between the old and fringe areas where new constructions are coming up.

 Apart from Delhi, Goa, too, has recently set up an urban arts commission. Calcutta will be the third Indian city to have such a panel.

 Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya has okayed the proposal and it has been duly ratified in the mayoral council meeting last week.

 The CMC will send a team led by chief municipal architect and town planner Anindya Karforma to Delhi next week for a first-hand idea about the functioning of an arts commission. ?We have decided to include historian Barun De, architect Samir Rakshit and artist Ramananda Bandopadhyay in the commission,? said municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay.

 All future building construction proposals, billboards and beautification schemes in Calcutta will have to be approved by this watchdog body.

 Bandyopadhyay said old Calcutta stretches between Shyambazar and Tollygunge, where almost every inch is covered with buildings. About 87 sq km of the new suburban areas of Behala, Garden Reach and Jadavpur were added to Calcutta in 1985. The eastern fringes are emerging as the city?s new hub.

 In old Calcutta, buildings are mainly reconstructed, whereas large-scale construction activities are going on on the eastern fringe of the city along the EM Bypass and in the added areas of Behala, Garden Reach and Jadavpur.

 In the absence of any monitoring authority, growth in these areas is unplanned, without any architectural link with the old city area.

 The commission will determine whether the architecture and fa?ade of a proposed building or beautification scheme of a particular area is distorting the ambience of the area where it is coming up.

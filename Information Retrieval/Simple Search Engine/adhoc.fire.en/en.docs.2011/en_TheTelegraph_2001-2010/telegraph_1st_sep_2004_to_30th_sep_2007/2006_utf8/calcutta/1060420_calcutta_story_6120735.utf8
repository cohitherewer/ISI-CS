The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Demand channels to beat dues row

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Speak up and demand the channels of your choice. 

 That was the message from STAR India officials, who visited the city on Wednesday to ?clarify? issues related to the ongoing STAR blackout in around 75 per cent of Calcutta?s cable households.

 ?Contrary to what viewers are being informed on their screens, we are not trying to extract money from them and our rates haven?t increased in a long time,? said Tony D?silva, executive vice-president (distribution) of STAR India.

 Owing to the dues disputes, the STAR bouquet of channels is currently off the networks of multi-system operators Manthan and SitiCable. While STAR switched off Manthan over a month ago, SitiCable blacked out the STAR feed in solidarity with Manthan last Saturday.

 SitiCable and Manthan, who accuse STAR of ?high-handedness?, argue that their operators cannot raise subscription on the ground to meet STAR?s demands.

 STAR officials on Wednesday urged viewers to ?demand the channels? from their cable operators. ?Over 11 networks, including a part of SitiCable, are carrying the channels. Operators can take the signal from there,? D?silva said.

 ?Viewers can call our helpline at 1250177, SMS ?GET? to 7827 or approach TDSAT or TRAI with their grievances,? he added.

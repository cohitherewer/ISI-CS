 Friday, the penultimate day of 

 the ongoing Lakme Fashion Week in Mumbai, saw some serious 

 fashion. Savio Jon first made a mark with his stark simplicity 

 and Narendra Kumar followed it up with the most dramatic 

 show the fashion week has seen so far. 

 Savios collection, without 

 a title (I dont like to name my collections), 

 was all about minimalism. Fluid cottons, pure silks, linen 

 and fishnet were intensely layered by piling three-four 

 pieces of garments. Oversized blouses and shirts, dresses 

 long and short, pinafores, long maxis, jackets were piled 

 on. The colours were soft whites, beige, grey, black, 

 browns and pale yellow.

 While most of the collection went 

 embellishment-free, for evening glamour the designer added 

 some shimmer to the same kind of silhouettes. I dont 

 believe in bling and I like to make clothes that can be 

 worn all over the world at any occasion, explained 

 the designer.

 Low necklines, both front and 

 back, cowls and raw edges were some of the highlights. If 

 only there was a little more variety; the silhouettes did 

 seem repetitive.

 Narendra Kumar finished the evening 

 with a show that made quite an impact. The designer had 

 kicked off the fashion week on Tuesday with his mens 

 wear collection, providing eye candy in the form of John 

 Abraham. His womens wear show, however, was star-free, 

 and it stood out for the brilliant clothes and the choice 

 of music. Titled When Love Touches You, the collection 

 was all about romance, inspired by a letter written by the 

 designers father to his mother that initiated their 

 courtship. The letter written in 1956 had been slipped into 

 a book, The Pavilion of Women, at a train station 

 and handed over to Laxmi, his mother. The background music 

 for the show was almost entirely the sound of a running 

 train, accompanied by the chaos of voices in a train. A 

 tribute to all love and romances that have flourished despite 

 social pressures, the show culminated with the song 

 Waqt ne kiya (from Kagaz ke Phool).

 Drama apart, the clothes were 

 quite simple with a distinct international feel. Golden 

 yellow, sea blue, navy blue, beige, brown and rust coloured 

 the subdued creations. The fabrics used were linens, cottons, 

 poplins, knits, organza and taffeta silks.

 The silhouettes boasted volume 

 and elements of tailoring at the same time. Light embroidery, 

 textures, pleating, ruching, applique, smocking and abstract 

 prints were used extensively. A variety of dresses often 

 stopping above the calf, nipped-at-the-waist jackets, skirts 

 (mostly balloon) and more made up the collection.

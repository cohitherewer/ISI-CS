 A THOUGHT FOR FOOD

 What: 

 Launch of Arsalan. 

 Where: 119 Mirza Ghalib 

 Street (Ripon Street).

 When: October 12.

 Take a look: With a name 

 that means lion in Urdu, Arsalan is doing just 

 what it should occupying a lions share of the Mughlai 

 food market in the city. There is an increased demand 

 for Mughlai cuisine like biryani, chanp, kebabs and 

 curries, so why not expand when the time is right? 

 said Akhtar Parwez, director of the popular chain that launched 

 its third outlet in the city. 

 Only two months ago, Arsalan took 

 over Porto Rio at Circus Avenue and now Chino Bistro, the 

 Italian-Chinese restaurant, has given way to the Mughlai 

 eatery. Thats not all. By the year-end, Calcuttans 

 can expect a couple of more branches.

 The 4,500 sq ft restaurant spread 

 over two floor levels boasts 150 covers. The eatery has 

 been divided into a barbecue counter, mocktail bar, kathi 

 roll takeaway counter and dining area. 

 The spread: The menu includes 

 signature Arsalan dishes, from biryanis to kebabs. But its 

 not just the Mughlai selection that the outlet is offering. 

 To cater to all tastes, this branch will also serve 

 Chinese cuisine along with our traditional Mughlai platter. 

 A new addition is the mocktail section that does not exist 

 at any of the other branches, said Parwez. So the 

 menu is a mixed bag comprising everything from Murg Chatpata, 

 Pudina Paneer Tikka and Hyderabadi Biryani to Hunan chicken, 

 Garlic Noodles and Toffee Walnut.

 Pocket pinch: Biryanis 

 start at Rs 50, chanp at Rs 45 while kebabs and curries 

 are priced at Rs 45 onwards.

 Voiceover: The management 

 is the same, so the quality of food will be maintained, 

 assured Sarafat Ali, head chef of all the three branches 

 of Arsalan.

 Bengali bite

 What: Bhai Phonta and Id 

 festival.

 Where: Kewpies at 

 2 Elgin Lane.

 When: Till October 29.

 The spread: There are Jamjamat 

 Thalas in both vegetarian and non-vegetarian options. Besides, 

 there are the regular Kewpies Sadharon Niramish Thala 

 and Mithus Amish Thala. 

 You can choose from a host of 

 vegetarian and non-vegetarian main course items like Doi 

 Begun, Pomfret Posto, Muri Ghonto, Chicken Jahanara and 

 Chitol Petir Jhaal. Round off with sweet treats like Shemai 

 Payesh, Patisapta and Malpua.

 Pocket pinch: While the 

 thalas are priced between Rs 155 and Rs 360, a la 

 carte dishes cost anything between Rs 50 and Rs 325.

 Sea spread

 What: Underwater Delicacies 

 festival.

 Where: Baan Thai at The 

 Oberoi Grand.

 When: Till October 28.

 The spread: If you can 

 enjoy crabs even after the arduous task of breaking the 

 oh-so-tough shells, try Poo Phat Prik (stir-fried crab in 

 chilli paste) or Poo Nue Phad Phong Karee (curry dusted 

 mud crab tossed in onion, chilli and celery). If scampi 

 is your choice, you are spoilt for choice. There is Kaeng 

 Kari Koong (scampi in yellow curry with coconut milk and 

 fresh red chilli), Koong Phad Nam Prik Phao (stir-fried 

 scampi with chilli paste, spring onion and Thai basil), 

 Koong Phad Bai Krapaw (scampi stir-fried with chilli and 

 hot basil) and more. Like lobsters? Dig into Koong Mangkorn 

 Makhampiak (broiled lobster in tamarind sauce with coriander 

 root and shallots), Koong Mangkorn Pao (grilled lobster 

 with garlic, Thai herb and light soya) or Koong Mangkorn 

 Takrai (grilled lobster marinated with lemon grass, kaffir 

 lime, galangal, onion and garlic). Sometimes sweet, sometimes 

 spicy, this seafood spread is sure to impress.

 Pocket pinch: Dishes are 

 priced between Rs 650 and Rs 1,100.

 Voiceover: This is 

 undoubtedly the best season for fresh and nice seafood, 

 smiled Manas Krishnamoorthy, F amp;B manager of The Oberoi 

 Grand.

 Champion of choice

 A ballroom brimming with women 

 of all ages was the perfect setting for encouraging words 

 from a successful woman who has been an accomplished actor, 

 a member of Parliament and an activist.

 Saturday evening turned out to be most engrossing as Shabana Azmi held forth on empowerment of women at an award ceremony hosted by the Ladies Study Group at the Taj Bengal Crystal Room.

 ?Economic empowerment doesn?t come with economic independence,? observed the actress-cum-activist, who works for underprivileged women in Mumbai.

 ?Being a housewife doesn?t make you less empowered. Taking care of a family is a huge responsibility. But if it?s a lack of choice that has made you a housewife, then it?s not being empowered,? observed Shabana, who felt women?s issues in Parliament are perceived to be ?soft?, like health and education.

 ?These are not central to the issues of policy? Just putting women in Parliament or police stations won?t change anything. We have to change our mindset for any positive change.?

 Touching upon a range of issues from gender bias at home to unjust inheritance laws that trigger dowry and female infanticide, the actress who has played strong women characters from Ankur to 15 Park Avenue dwelt on the small screen that show women in a poor light.

 ?It?s surprising that women are driving the television industry from behind and in front of the screen, but that hasn?t led to anything positive? but it?s interesting that more working women are being shown in films these days. I always do characters that are working women; it?s a conscious decision I have taken... Similarly, a woman film-maker need not necessarily make a film on empowerment; she can make a murder mystery but with a feminine ? not feminist ? gaze. Because, the male gaze has been dragged around for too long,? signed off Shabana.

 Also at the function, the Ladies Study Group Charitable Trust Annual Award 2005 was conferred on Mentaid for its work with challenged children.

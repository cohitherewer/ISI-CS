 An ethnic lowdown

 Crushed skirts, embellished churidars or Babli patialas, the lowers are being decked up with liberal doses of drama, discovers Riddhima Seal

 Be it the heavily-embellished churidar, the Babli-look patiala, the gypsy skirts or the embroidered trousers, the fashion focus below the waist has been fairly ethnic almost throughout last year. And the rage promises to continue even as the new year rolls on.

 The trend triggered off by Preity Zintas flowing skirts in Lakshya reached new heights with Rani Mukherjee flagging off the biggest Bollywood-inspired statement of 2005, the loose patialas she sported in Bunty Aur Babli.

 Even as these items became wardrobe musts for every woman in the know of fashion facts, GoodLife checks out the other ethnic lowers that are ruling right now.

 Skirt story

 Originally an out-and-out western garment, the skirt has of late emerged as the latest way to add that touch of ethnicity to your look. Ethnic skirts make for a strong fashion statement. They look very dressy and smart at the same time, says young designer Meenakshi Dadoo. 

 And the variety of skirts flooding the market is almost too flattering. From the crushed kinds in cotton with khari prints to the bright silk ones embellished with bells, beads and shells, the choice is as wide as it gets. 

 Sequin work on skirts is finding a lot of favour with my clients. In shades of brown, black and red, they make for the perfect party wear. The ones with tribal prints, laces and zari work on them make for good evening wear. Ethnic is the mantra of the moment globally and depiction of folklore on skirts is also very happening, feels Meenakshi.

 Designer Agnimitra Paul is all for corduroy and suede skirts done up in a very Indian way. While the fabrics are western, introducing a panel with heavy embroidery goes a long way in adding that touch of ethnicity. Even pencil, straight or knee-length skirts can be given that Indian feel with some embroidery on the side slits or introducing some ornate mirror work on them, she offers.

 The best thing about these dressy, desi skirts is that you can even wear them with elan to traditional functions. According to designer Sayon Mitra, fishtail skirts, handkerchief skirts, and lehnga cut skirts easily lend themselves to Indian treatments.

 Not just skirts, the touch of tradition is even seen on sarongs these days. The typically floral beach accessory is reborn in materials like velvet and satin, with lots of hand-embroidery and patchwork.

 Trouser talk

 Its time to move out of your plain one-coloured trouser, for this western garment is going the desi way as well. Heavily embroidered in fabrics like silk, raw silk and also cotton, these dressy trousers are rocking right now. Trousers with ethnic detailing and tribal motifs on black are very hot. The other hit is the one-coloured trouser with just the pockets or the knees embroidered, says Meenakshi. 

 With Agnimitra, its the fully-embroidered ones with Gujarati mirror work or phulkari work that are doing well. Alternatively, one could go for the half-embroidered ones with kantha work. These look best on a bright raw silk base, feels the designer.

 Patiala pick

 Even though Shaad Alis romantic comedy left the theatres months ago, the Babli patialas continue to be as hot as ever. A look at the racks of Westside, housing these in a variety of bright colours, confirms this.

 The patialas came up with Veer Zaara, where Preity was seen sporting these lowers in fabrics like mulmul. But they became a real rage after Ranis Babli look, smiles Agnimitra.

 And while the striped ones and the floral printed ones in bright colours are still very hot, there is now a shift to pastel shades as well. The embroidery up to the knees, with thread work, zari, crystals or sequins, continues to be popular. Team them with short-length, three-quarter, plain kurtas and you are ready to rock, adds Agnimitra.

 Churidars, too, are witnessing a similar change. Heavily embroidered with zari or simple thread work, either full or up to the knees, the focus here has shifted to the lowers. The fitted gathered look is very much in. Churidars with embellishments like little bells, mirror work or sequins is very very in, stresses Sayon.

 Team right

 As the lowers get dressier than ever before, the trick lies in teaming them right. If you are sporting a very dressy lower, it is important that you keep the upper mellow. For instance, an embroidered black trouser should go well with a simple shirt in soft tones or maybe a simple white tee, recommends Meenakshi. 

 Agnimitra agrees: The feel of the garment would be largely lost if both the upper and the lower are dressy. To highlight your gorgeous lower, team it with a spaghetti in an earthy tone or a halter neck in black. Dressy patialas or churidars are best worn with light-coloured simple kurtas.

 And dont dare neglect your footwear. An ethnic look remains incomplete without matching shoes and since the focus is largely on the lowers, they are bound to get noticed even more.

 Go for ornate mojris or Roman tie-ups.

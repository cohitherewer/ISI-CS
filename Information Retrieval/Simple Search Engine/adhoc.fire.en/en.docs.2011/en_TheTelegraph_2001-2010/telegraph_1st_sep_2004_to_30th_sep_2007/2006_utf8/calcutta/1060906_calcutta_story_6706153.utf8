 Soumitra Chatterjee with Sova Sen in Shadows of Time

Why did you agree to do the bit role in Shadows of Time? 

 Maybe the role is small but its not a bad one, so I thought why not. That apart, I knew about Florian and so was interested in working with him. We shot in a jute mill somewhere near the Dakshineswar bridge for a week or so.

How different was the set-up from Bengali films?

 Not much different, basically. But the foreign production houses are updated in terms of equipment and finances. And its also true that they are more professional and disciplined. Foreign productions are technically very sound. This is something I had noticed while working in other foreign collaborations too. But whether a film will be good or bad ultimately depends on the director.

Did Florian meet your expectations of a good director?

 Florian is a very promising film-maker. I had heard about him long before working with him. He had won an Oscar for a short film. I was very impressed with the way he handled Shadows.

 School vigil on students

 - Teen 

 crime spurt worries principals, parents 

 SAMARPAN DUTTA

 To prevent students from keeping bad company, the authorities of some prominent schools have decided to keep a tab on their activities until their guardians pick them up after class. The heads of some schools have also instructed the teachers to interact with the guardians and find out if students are spending a lot of time in transit between home and school.

 St Augustines Day School principal C.S. Gasper said: It is certainly worrying that many students tend to keep bad company. One can keep a tab on children at the primary school level, but students studying in Class VIII and above are more difficult to deal with. Visiting pubs and discotheques is a way of life now. Condemning students for doing so may well prove disastrous.

 He continued: What we need to do is make them aware of the pros and cons of their actions and restrain them from mixing with the wrong kind of people. I have designed a roster assigning teachers with the duty of keeping track of students activities, monitoring them till their guardians arrive and counselling them if there is a need.

 St Augustines is also maintaining a diary so that the guardians can find out if a student bunks school.

 Bishop of the Calcutta diocese of the Church of North India (CNI) Reverend P.S.P. Raju said he was aware of the trend among students, especially those studying in higher classes, to loiter around after school hours. 

 I have requested the principals of the 11 CNI schools in the city to be more vigilant and monitor the activities of students after school hours, the bishop stated. 

 Sucheta Roy, mother of two teenagers, echoed the concern of the school authorities: With the spurt in crime involving students across the city, many parents like me have expressed concern about the role of schools in keeping a check on our wards. We do not deny the importance of the parents role, but we do need some assistance from the schools in bringing up our children properly.

 She added: The children usually get influenced by what is shown on television and the lifestyles of their peers. In trying to lead a similar life, they often find themselves in trouble.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Petition against examiner

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 A medical student at SSKM Hospital, Gouranga Pramanik, has moved a petition in Calcutta High Court, alleging that he was being victimised by one of his teachers for leading the anti-NRI quota stir in 2004.

 He alleged that the teacher, Debabrata Kar, head of the anatomy department, was not allowing him to pass in the subject.

 Talking to Metro, Kar denied the charges. ?I was not the only examiner for anatomy. There were three others. The student failed because all four had ranked him low.?

 Pramanik, son of a labourer in a bidi factory in Murshidabad, had cleared the joint entrance examination in 2003. But he got a berth in the college in 2004, after the Supreme Court cancelled admissions under the NRI quota.

 Pramanik?s lawyer Kartik Kumar Roy said on Tuesday the case would come up for hearing on July 5.

 ?From the very beginning, the professor has not been behaving properly with me. He often threatened me that he would not allow me to pass the exams,? Pramanik alleged.

 He stated in his petition that he was not awarded the qualifying marks in the professional anatomy paper in the first semester exams, the results of which were declared in July 2005.

 ?My classmates told me that the professor would keep failing me till I quit the Democratic Students? Organisation, an affiliate of the SUCI (which had spearheaded the anti-NRI quota movement),? Pramanik claimed.

 He sat for a supplementary test in November 2005. ?The qualifying marks was 87 out of 200. But I was awarded only 77,? he added. 

 Pramanik pleaded with the court that ?the examiner for anatomy be changed?.

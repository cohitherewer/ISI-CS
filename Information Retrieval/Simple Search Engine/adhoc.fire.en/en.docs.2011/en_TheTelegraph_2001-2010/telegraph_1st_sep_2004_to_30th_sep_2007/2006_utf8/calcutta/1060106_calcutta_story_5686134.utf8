The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Across-board slash in Asia Pacific fares

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Two days after Singapore Airlines announced a 50 per cent slash in fares for a round-trip from Calcutta, Thai Airways has fired a bigger salvo by cutting rates across the board in the entire Asia Pacific region.

 A visit to Petronas, one of the world?s tallest buildings in Kuala Lumpur, shopping in Singapore or sightseeing in Sydney on a budget to-and-fro ticket is now a closer reality for the city?s holiday-makers.

 Thai Airways on Thursday announced that Calcuttans could avail of a round-trip to Bangkok for just Rs 7,600. 

 Courtesy Thai, which now flies out of the city seven days a week, Calcuttans can travel to Penang, Kuala Lumpur and Singapore for Rs 12,000, instead of Rs 14,000-plus.

 ?In order to tide over the lean season, we decided to announce special fares for the next few weeks. We will review the situation again on February 15. But by then, we hope that many Calcuttans would have availed of these fares,? said Krisnapong Srisinwarakool, general manager (Calcutta) of the airline.

 Besides the great fares and grand holiday packages, Thai has also decided to slash fares for long-haul flights to Australia and New Zealand. 

 From now, round-trips to Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane will be possible for just Rs 27,000-plus and to Auckland for Rs 37,000.

 Beyond air fares, Thai has also decided to project traditional tourist destinations, like Pattaya, Krabi and Phuket, in an all-new avatar. 

 ?There are numerous festivals and events in these places lined up throughout the year. We will promote the tourism potential of Thailand and also the other regions where we fly every day, so that we can add to our customer base,? added S.C. Kapur, the district sales manager (Calcutta) of the airline.

 Thai Airways International is also holding talks with aviation department officials for making their flight schedule of seven days a week out of Calcutta permanent.

 ?We are keeping our fingers crossed,? he added.

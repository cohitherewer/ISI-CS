 US study tour 

 PATRICK PRINGLE

 In an attempt to get a wider picture of the education system and resources in India, a 16-member group of American educators, librarians and museum managers will visit Calcutta on July 25.

 The members of the group, chosen from various educational institutions across the US, have been sent under the US Department of Education-funded Fulbright-Hays Seminars Abroad Program. 

 The all-India programme (from June 30 to August 4) is being hosted and executed by the US Educational Foundation in India.

 The group is affiliated to the Centre for Cultural Resources and Training, an autonomous organisation under the government of India?s ministry of culture.

 During their visit from July 25 to July 28 in the city, the participants will go to various schools, like St John?s Diocesan High School for Girls, to learn about the education system in Bengal and interact with the principal, teachers and students. 

 Their focus is to discuss the economic and political influence on educational policies and the changing role of women in the Indian society. 

 The group will also participate in a panel discussion on the contemporary knowledge situation in eastern India, with special reference to special education, at the Indian Institute of Cerebral Palsy on July 26. 

 Reena Sen, of the Indian Institute of Cerebral Palsy, explained: ?We want to highlight the progress made by the challenged people in the city, especially in the education sector.?

 As part of the programme, the group has attended a five-day orientation lecture in Delhi and has also visited schools in cities like Ahmedabad, Mumbai, Mysore, Varanasi and Agra.

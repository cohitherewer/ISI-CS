The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Mum is the word

It is not just multi-tasking; it is a never-ending game of racing against the clock, a woman exclaims in between taking a phone call, dealing with a kettle on the boil and attending to a squealing baby. 

 The woman may be speaking from a different continent via the small screen but many housewives here would identify with her situation. That is why Discovery Channel has dedicated a full hour to such shows, through the week. ?Though Discovery is watched by everybody in the family, not every programme appeals to each viewer. Since noon is when women finish housework, we are having programmes specifically appealing to ?her? during this time,? said Rajiv Bakshi, associate director, marketing and communication. 

Thus there is a programme like Yummy Mummy (picture

teaches sign language to parents. Then a babbling infant is shown indicating that 

he is hungry, he wants more food and he has wet his diaper ? vital communication 

in his and the new mother?s life ? all after the mother has learnt the language 

and soundlessly passed on the knowledge to the new-born. ?The benefits of sign 

language are enormous ? higher IQs, a larger vocabulary, better bonding and the 

ability to tell when it hurts,? an expert says in the show. 

 Yummy Mummy deals with other problems mothers face ? finding a job after a pregnancy-induced lay-off and fighting a mummy image in dressing and hairstyle. A counsellor talks a woman through various phases of appearance and attitude before she is ready to face the job market.

The other premier show that follows on the Wednesday 

Woman?s Hour is a proposition India is light years away from. Runway Mom is 

about pregnant models. The show centres round Plum Magazine, a lifestyle 

magazine for pregnant women. There is even an agency that supplies models to the 

magazine. 

 The programme drives home a reality that is a greater truth perhaps in India ? that a woman gets drowned in motherhood and forgets her own needs. She is taught to talk sharp and dress sharp, and even bare her belly in public places for photo shoots!

 But as actress Churni Ganguly, who spoke after the preview of the shows, pointed out, the whole point is to help women raise their self-esteem in a period of their lives when they think of themselves as ugly and unwanted. ?The spouse?s attention is the best antidote to such a feeling but such programmes should also work well,? she said, suggesting that husbands too watch the show to empathise with what their partner goes through.

 That might be too much to ask. Especially at that hour.

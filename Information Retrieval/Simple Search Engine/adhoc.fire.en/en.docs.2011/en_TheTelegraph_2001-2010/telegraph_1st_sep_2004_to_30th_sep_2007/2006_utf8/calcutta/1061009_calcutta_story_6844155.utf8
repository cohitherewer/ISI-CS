 Does Bengal have any state animal, plant or bird? What is the significance of the rhino and bull statuettes found in Mohenjo-daro? Why are animal images used for visualising ragas and raaginis in Rajasthani miniatures? Why do we revere the animal vahanas of our gods and goddesses? 

 For answers to these and other queries, visit Living with Wildlife, a unique and splendid exhibition to open at Indian Museums Ashutosh Memorial Hall on October 9. 

 To continue till October 13 as part of the Wildlife Week celebrations of the state directorate of forests, the show has been supported by Zoological Society of India (ZSI) and the Indian Museum. 

 There is a wide selection of historical artefacts in metal, terracotta and stone from the museum and rare specimens from the ZSI. Attractive display panels and multimedia presentations by the forest department will inform the audience about endemic, endangered and extinct animals, national parks, sanctuaries and captive breeding.

 People forget just how beneficial wildlife is and how much we depend on it. The exhibition will, hopefully, make them more aware, said V.K. Yadav, deputy chief wildlife warden.

 The awareness campaign will hit the road on October 10. A Wildlife Quiz for school students, in collaboration with TTIS, at St Xaviers College auditorium on October 11 will be followed by a drawing contest at Nandan II on October 12. 

 The action swings out of Calcutta on October 13, the day a seminar on the Santragachhi Wetlands, Birdwatching and Elephant Conservation will be held in Bankura. 

 Between October 14 and 15, the forest department and Aranyak will host wildlife film festivals in north Bengal.

 Also as part of Wildlife Week celebrations, a forest department film on wildlife conservation and management will be shown on DD Bangla at 9.40 pm on Monday.

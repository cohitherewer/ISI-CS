 It rocks, for the true blue brigade

 Nothing beats the experience of buying a brand new pair of good ol Levis denims. Add to that the backdrop of a brand new store The Original Levis Store that too eastern Indias first flagship one. Lets just say, its a fashionable trip and nostalgic one at that.

 A bright red Levis signage urges you to step into 19A Shakespeare Sarani (near Camac Street crossing). The 1,850 sq ft store is a Mecca for true blue fans. Blue as in the colour, because musically, The Original Levis Store has a more rock feel (the plasma on the wall running a Guns N Roses concert is no coincidence).

 Two mannequins pose happily, looking out on the main road, dressed in mining gear rough denims, gum-boots and canary yellow mining hat. Again, this is no coincidence.

 Originally, jeans were developed for miners They wanted to invent a sturdy, easy and low-maintenance fabric and thats how denims came about. The mannequins tell that story, says Vijay Dugar, franchisee of The Original Levis Store. 

 Inside the store, old ad campaigns hang on a wall of fame. A crash course in the brands history, since most Levis loyalists today werent around through the middle of last century!

 Famous images of more famous models and a few famous lines find pride of place, framed smartly, on a white textured wall.

 There are two striking, signature features of the store bright red walls and antique oak flooring. The oak floor blends with the walls at places to form an effective backdrop for the famous brass Levis 501 button, a symbol of sorts, says Vijay.

 The front section is the largest of the store. It is strictly all-male collections from Red Loop, Red Tab and 501s jeans, tees and shirts. It also houses some belts, bags and caps but with a dash of denim of course. 

 Here, the mannequins are showing off 501s and Red Loops. A must-mention is the styling, for they sport a gamut of cool accessories: spiked, leather wristbands, designer shoes, glares, hats, watches... the works. 

 The next section is dedicated to Sykes, an Indian sub-brand from Levis, targeting the cool and hip school and college student. Candy-striped walls, graffiti posters and sporty accents like basketball props and roller skates set up the scene for garments on display lots of mock tees, funky printed shirts, bright and fun striped shirts and cargo pants for guys and girls.

 A small zone is reserved for Workers, a mens office wear range by Levis. Highlights of the section: sober, classic shirts, formal trousers and a wide range of current hottie corduroys. They are back with a twist and boast a two-tone effect, says Vijay.

 The last section of The Original Levis Store is exclusively for girls. Pink and lilac wallpaper, maple wood flooring, a girlie dressing table, a pink twin seater and dangling crystal beads as partition 

 The merchandise available is a mix. Lots of girlie elements like chiffon and silk, empire-lines, glitter, shimmer and shine blend with the denim fare in the form of jackets and jeans. Hot property is the Sushmita Sen-endorsed Diva Collection and extensive Red Loop and Red Tab lines.

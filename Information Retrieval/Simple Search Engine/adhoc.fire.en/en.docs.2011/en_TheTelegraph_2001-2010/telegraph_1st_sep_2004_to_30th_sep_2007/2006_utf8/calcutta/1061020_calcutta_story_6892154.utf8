The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Euro home grant goes to NGO hand

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A strong network, intelligent but flawed accounting style and contacts at the top Shaukat Ali had allegedly used all these to siphon off thousands of euros sent by a German national for a child welfare project in 2003-05.

 Ali, a chartered accountant in his mid-thirties, was arrested early on October 13 in a south Calcutta hideout following a complaint by the German national, Made Helgo Mayer Hamme.

 Criminal Investigation Department (CID) officers said Ali had embezzled around Rs 1.15 crore Mayer Hamme had sent on behalf of a Hamburg-based firm, Hecgo EV, to a students home on Bellilious Road in Howrah.

 The home is run by a Cooch Behar-based NGO, of which Ali is the official accountant. His brother is the secretary of the organisation.

 Sleuths said Ali would regularly withdraw money from the account where Mayer Hamme used to send the grant and transfer it to his account and also that of other members of the NGO.

 The organisations members include Alis father-in-law, a former IAS officer who had served as a district magistrate in Bengal.

 The audit report that Ali had sent to the Hamburg-based firm appears to be riddled with irregularities, prompting the officials there to go for a second check. After auditors in Germany noticed the fraud, the firm hired two other Calcutta-based auditors to go through the report. It was then that the fraud came to light, said a senior officer of the CID.

 Probing the functioning of the students home in Howrah, the CID has learnt it was once run by a Christian missionary with funds provided by Hecgo EV.

 At that time, Ali was hired to go through the accounts of the home. He had reportedly come across several anomalies and pointed them out to the Germans.

 The responsibility for running the home was then given to a prominent English-medium school in south Calcutta.

 This time, too, Ali found irregularities in the use of funds to run the home.

 He again got in touch with the German firm and suggested that the authorities hand over the home to the Cooch Behar-based NGO.

 While recommending the NGO to the Germans, he didnt mention that he was involved with it as auditor or that his brother was its secretary, said an officer.

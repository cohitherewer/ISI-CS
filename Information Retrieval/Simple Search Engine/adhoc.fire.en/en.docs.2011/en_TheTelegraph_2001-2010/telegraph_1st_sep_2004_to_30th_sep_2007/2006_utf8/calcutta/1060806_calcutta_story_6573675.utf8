 The basics of bunny care

 Pet Passion

 Dr. Goutam Mukherjee

 Sneha Das Gupta wrote to me, wanting 

 to know how to take care of her rabbits. Here are some dos 

 and donts for all of you to follow for your bunnies.

 Rabbits drink water and they 

 are not allergic to it. But never wash a rabbit unless it 

 is very dirty or has soiled itself. Rabbits can go into 

 shock if you immerse them in water. They do a very good 

 job of keeping themselves clean and only need help when 

 they are very ill.

 If you need to wash your rabbit, 

 fill a bucket with inch-level water. Place a towel at the 

 bottom of the bucket, so that your bunny has some gentle 

 grip. Try to keep the front half of your rabbit out of water 

 so that you can clean only its legs and back. You can use 

 a gentle soap or shampoo.

 Dont use a hair dryer. You can 

 use a soft brush to remove excess hair. You should clean 

 your rabbits ears regularly with spirits to avoid ear infection. 

 Anti-rabies vaccine should be given once a year. De-worming 

 is very essential at regular intervals. Piperzine and Albendazol 

 are the drugs of choice.

 The diet of a rabbit can comprise 

 grass, apple, reddish beetroot, carrot, spinach, wheat grass, 

 hay, banana and almond. If your rabbit has loose motion, 

 Chloramphenicol (enteromycitin) can be administered.

 Coat un-coat: Coat development 

 in rabbits is influenced by nutritional, hormonal and environmental 

 factors. Baby rabbits develop their first coat of guard 

 hair and undercoat within a few days. When they are five/six 

 weeks old, the baby coat is replaced with the intermediate 

 coat until they are four/five months old.

 In the adult rabbit, shedding 

 follows a seasonal pattern. There are usually two complete 

 coat changes every year. During shedding, there are patches 

 of fur in various stages of growth throughout the rabbits 

 body so its not unusual for your rabbit to look patchy. 

 Hair loss usually begins from the head and progresses down, 

 towards the neck, back and then stomach.

 Chew on this: Chewing is 

 part of a rabbits natural behaviour. To keep rabbits engaged 

 and entertained, you may put untreated wood blocks or cardboard 

 in their cages. Bowls, balls and rings made of willow are 

 favourites with rabbits. These can be bought online or from 

 stores. You can also use toilet paper rolls and other chewable 

 cardboard materials that can later be thrown away. Avoid 

 objects with sharp edges, loose parts or soft rubber that 

 rabbits can swallow.

 Overgrown teeth are usually limited 

 to incisors in rabbits, but can extend to the molars. Rabbits 

 teeth grow constantly throughout their lives. If the teeth 

 are not trimmed, your rabbit may not be able to eat and 

 may even develop mouth ulcers, abscesses and other problems. 

 So, if they are not aligned properly, periodic trimming 

 may be necessary (every three to eight weeks). The proper 

 way to trim a rabbits teeth is with a Dremel tool. Anaesthesia 

 may be necessary if the rabbit is very skittish or if the 

 molars need trimming. Nail trimmers may cause dental damage. 

 Not all rabbits need teeth trimming, though.

 Appetite loss: If your 

 bunny stops eating, you must find out why within 48 hours. 

 Rabbits, like cats, can have fatal liver problems if they 

 dont eat. Common conditions that result in a loss of appetite 

 include dental disease, hairballs (rabbits cant vomit), 

 and low-fibre diet. Less common problems associated with 

 loss of appetite include respiratory, gastrointestinal, 

 uterine, bladder, kidney and middle ear infections along 

 with toxin ingestion.

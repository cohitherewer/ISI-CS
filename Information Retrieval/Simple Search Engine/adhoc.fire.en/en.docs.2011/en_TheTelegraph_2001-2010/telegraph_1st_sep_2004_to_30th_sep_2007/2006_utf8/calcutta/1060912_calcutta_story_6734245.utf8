The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Metro Movie 

 Meter 

 The Bong Connection

 US-based Bengali Andy (Shayan) wants to return to his 

 roots and make music in Calcutta while Apu (Parambrata) wants 

 to leave the city and make it big in the US. Apus girlfriend 

 Sheela (Raima) helps Andy in his musical quest in Calcutta 

 while Rita (Peeya) walks with Apu in his search for life.

 A Bong is a Bong is a Bong. Not mincing words, writer-director 

 Anjan Dutt examines the extremes of the Bengali mindset, 

 from Houston to Hatibagan. Through characters that border 

 the cliched and the conventional, Dutt is able to rustle 

 up a modern-day bittersweet tale of the unique brand called 

 Bongs.

 The performances are top notch. Shayan shines as the non-resident 

 Bong who cant come to terms with the unprofessional approach 

 and the archaic values around him. Wife Peeya is equally 

 effective as the spoilt America-born desi. Raima 

 looks gorgeous. Parambrata tries hard, but sadly that shows. 

 Victor Banerjee is spectacular in the one scene he does. 

 Newcomer Shauvik is effortless as Hasan. Biswajit is natural.

 The music by Neel is zippy and catchy. While people will 

 sure hum the new Pagla hawa, Shaans Majhi re 

 is fresh and frothy. 

 The handheld camerawork, slick in parts, is too jarring 

 at places. Also, the rapid staccato editing doesnt let 

 the film settle down and while the transitions work at times, 

 the untimely jump cuts disturb the visual flow. 

 Last word: Food for thought 

 couldnt have been more delicious. Whenever it hits theatres 

 the sad news is that the release date hasnt been fixed 

 as yet this should make you go Bong Bong!

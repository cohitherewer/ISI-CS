 Travelling to seductive Darjeeling this winter? You can order your choice of meal way before you board the train, access clean toilets with soap and toiletries and enjoy the luxury of personalised service. All this, at approximately Rs 150 extra per person

 An innovative package introduced by a city hospitality group is geared to ensure your next vacation to the North Bengal hills begins at Sealdah station itself, with a room-on-the-railroad concept.

 In a first-of-its-kind arrangement with the railways, Sinclairs Hotels will run exclusive three-tier AC coaches on the Kanchenkanya and Uttar Banga Express from Sealdah to New Jalpaiguri, with the inaugural hotel-on-tracks coach set to chug out of town on November 30.

 A lot of people come to us for hotel reservations and then realise they couldnt get a berth on the train. So, we hit upon this idea of a single-window arrangement where you dont have to worry about making railway bookings or hotel reservations. We take care of everything, says Navin Suchanti, CEO and managing director, Sinclairs Hotels Ltd.

 Guests are promised a hassle-free experience, as the coach will have its own service and cleaning personnel. Our dedicated staff will ensure that the toilets are clean through the journey and little needs on board are taken care of, adds a Sinclairs spokesman.

 As passengers board the train, they will be greeted with a welcome drink and a gift hamper, including a duffel bag. At the point of booking, passengers can indicate meal preferences, including low-calorie or diabetic, vegetarian or non-vegetarian. Tea, coffee, biscuits, packed snacks and mineral water will be on sale.

 At NJP station, the vacationers will be welcomed with a steaming cup of tea and transferred to Chalsa or Darjeeling, depending on the choice of destination. The three-night package includes sightseeing, transfers and stay at Sinclairs Hotel in Darjeeling or the Sinclairs Retreat at Chalsa. 

 According to our calculations, the additional cost for an individual opting for this package works out to something like Rs 150, which is worth it, given the basket of conveniences. No other hotel group has offered a package like this before, stresses Suchanti.

 The package has received an encouraging response from travel agents, who wont have to worry about arranging tickets for their clients. Its definitely a novel and welcome move and our fraternity will support the scheme. An integrated approach like this benefits everybody down the line, observes Anil Punjabi, chairman (east), Travel Agents Federation of India.

 Since the concept is new, we will assess the response and then work out a long-term arrangement with the railways. For the moment, we will run the package during long weekends and then, maybe during the vacations, says Suchanti.

 There was a long shot where Sarit (actor Kaushik Chakrabarty) and I are seen travelling in a cycle-rickshaw down a village road. But halfway through, the rickshaw-puller turned around and voiced his incredulity at the possibility of ever conveying to the film?s audience that we were a couple in love without the usual song and dance. In the end, Kaushik had to assure him that we were just travelling in the rickshaw to the place where the real ?action? (including song and dance) would happen!? recalls Trina Neelina Banerjee, who recently won the Best Actress Award at the 7th Osian?s Cinefan Film Festival.

 Trina?s performance as Sonali in Nisshabd also helped its director Jahar Kanungo clinch the Best Film Award at Osian, which showcases the best of Asian Cinema. 

 Nisshabd marked the debut for both director and lead pair. It was Kanungo?s first feature film and Trina and Kaushik were from theatre backgrounds. ?Though Kaushik now acts in several tele-serials, he was then a Delhi-based singer and theatre person,? says Trina. The daughter of Salil and Arundhuti Bandhopadhyay of Theatron has been acting in plays since she was 12.

 So how did Sonali happen? By sheer luck. ?The actor selected for the role had fallen sick, and someone who had seen me act suggested my name. After a brief screen test, I was finalised for the 15-day shoot.? The film centres around the strange neurotic problem of Sarit, a 30-year-old based in Delhi who loses his job because of his extreme sensitivity to noise. Sarit cannot tolerate loud sounds and after dreaming continuously of his native village escapes to his friend?s rustic home. Here he not only finds a soothing world of quietness, he also finds his love, Sonali.

 ?Sonali is an articulate and lively person but she loves Sarit and tries her best to adapt herself to his likes and dislikes. There is talk in the village of their imminent marriage. But the film climaxes in a refusal. Sonali realises that marrying Sarit would mean changing herself altogether and she refuses to change,? narrates Trina who found this ?conflict between love and personal identity very interesting in a girl who has never been out of the village?.

 Recalling her stay on location at Harikhali in Midnapore, Trina says: ?Every day, we used to travel from our resort near the Haldia border to the village where I changed from my short kurta and jeans to a sari worn the traditional way and act like a local woman. But at all times I was conscious of the distance. There was no real communication between us and them.?

 And what was it like, being a heroine? ?Very, very scary,? laughs Trina. ?I remember before an outdoor shoot word had got round that Prosenjit and Rituparna were coming and when we arrived there was a huge crowd. There were people even on the trees and some 40-50 of them rushed to the car I was in, to peer through the window!?

 So is a foray in commercial films on the cards? ?Why not, if the script is interesting. But interesting me won?t be easy, because I am not ambitious; doing good work is more important to me. At the moment I am working in a Satyajit Ray Film and Television Institute diploma film and awaiting the release of a telefilm (tentatively titled Kichhu Megh Kichhu Roddur) by Partha Bhattacharya,? signs off Trina.

 Members of Iron 

 Maiden; (below) Bruce Dickinson 

 He is a writer, a champion fencer, 

 a researcher on train technology and a pilot. But the world 

 knows Bruce Dickinson as the lead vocalist of Iron Maiden. 

 The 48-year-old singer from Nottinghamshire started out 

 with bands like Styx, Speed and Samson but in 1981 found 

 his voice in the band that was named after the medieval 

 torture device used in the movie The Man in the Iron 

 Mask.

 One of the conditions for Bruce 

 joining Iron Maiden was he give up his stage name Bruce 

 Bruce. Well, I havent been Bruce Bruce for almost 

 30 years now, laughs the man, on the phone from London. 

 I am happy with the name my mom and dad invented for 

 me, and thats definitely Bruce Dickinson.

 ong with Steve Harris and Dave 

 Murray, Bruce has become synonymous with Iron Maiden, which 

 with 74 million album sales worldwide is easily one of the 

 most successful and influential heavy metal bands under 

 the sun.

 We established ourselves 

 as a top live act and we have never let people down We 

 have the loyalty of our fans and in return we look after 

 them, is how Bruce spells out the secret of the bands 

 three-decades old success story.

 so, unlike some other bands, Bruce 

 and gang dont change our sound around to be 

 fashionable. Iron Maiden, he stresses, has always 

 been popular but not fashionable.

 It not only helps us to 

 lead normal lives without being hassled, ordinary people 

 can relate to our music. Iron Maiden has never been about 

 personalities. We just do something we love and we work 

 hard at it.

 Despite being a wordsmith himself, 

 Bruce believes it is the sound that makes Iron Maiden what 

 it is. I am a singer and I am very fond of words but 

 it is the sound that clearly defines us, he explains. 

 Yes, lyrics are important but between sound and words, 

 I would have to go with sound.

 Iron Maidens new album A 

 Matter of Life and Death is doing well everywhere and 

 has been released in India under the EMI label. It 

 is a departure, musically, reveals Bruce. With 

 our new album, we have moved in the direction of more progressive 

 rock. We have been playing with this sound for quite some 

 time now. Lyrically, the topics we deal with in the album 

 include problems like global warming, pollution and corruption.

 Movies have always played a big 

 role in the music of Iron Maiden. Not only is the name inspired 

 from a film, many of their songs are actually movie titles 

 The Duellists, Where Eagles Dare and From 

 Here To Eternity. We tend to write lyrics in pictorial 

 fashion, explains Bruce. Movie titles always 

 evoke fond memories and they themselves are loaded with 

 images. So by naming a song after a movie title, it takes 

 on a picture.

 Having always used music as a 

 message against social demons, Bruce insists that music 

 cannot change the world. I dont think words 

 can change anything, he says. The music of the 

 60s, the Beatles they were a delusion. Music at the most 

 has the power to affect peoples emotions. If they 

 feel something after hearing the music, they may just go 

 out and change themselves. Music cannot change the society, 

 rather society actually changes musicians.

 Twelve years of Iron Maiden later, 

 Bruce left the band to pursue a solo career. I just 

 wanted to find out if I could do anything outside the band, 

 he recalls. As part of Iron Maiden, everybody is your 

 friend. You are looked after, even protected from bad Press. 

 So, I thought perhaps outside Maiden, I am not any good. 

 After a few years, in Austin Powers language, I found 

 my mojo again. After a couple of sparkling solo 

 records, I went back to the band in 1999.

 But despite singing for close 

 to 20 years, Bruce calls himself an amateur. Thats 

 what I like about being part of Maiden, he says. Im 

 a true amateur. All musicians have to be amateurs. If you 

 are too professional, then you will kill the soul of everything 

 you do. I give two or three months of a year to the band 

 and Im a kid during those days. Its all play, 

 no work!

 That play includes starting a 

 tour in October that will go on till Christmas. We 

 have just started rehearsals Then we take the entire 2007 

 off before we go for this big summer tour in 2008. And we 

 might be visiting India during that tour.

 Bruces brush with India 

 has been interesting, to say the least. As a pilot of the 

 UK charter airline Astraeus, he flies around a lot and has 

 even been to Agra on a couple of occasions. 

 I have been there for all 

 of 14 to 15 hours but I can tell you that the Taj Mahal 

 is stunning. I believe India is fascinating. My wife will 

 be going on a holiday to the Himalayas soon but I guess 

 I have to wait till 2008 to come there.

 And what about Eddie, the Iron 

 Maiden mascot, a permanent fixture in the bands horror-influenced 

 album cover art, as well as the live shows? All I 

 can say is that he has become pretty ferocious, chuckled 

 Bruce.

 The Penn Masala concert at Rang Durbaar in Swabhumi, presented by Hutch, on the chilly winter evening of January 11, found chairs filling up fast and those late by even minutes were left standing to catch the musical show devoid of any instrument but the mouth. Not a grumble could be heard from the spellbound audience, seated or standing.

 As the name suggests, the repertoire of songs of the a capella student band, straight from the University of Pennsylvania, is pure masala. The Wednesday show included a blend of Indian classical, Hindi film melodies, English rock and hip-hop peppered with lyrics in Arabic, Punjabi and Tamil.

 It is a social responsibility to reach out to music lovers in all parts. We are a pack of 15 where some are classically trained for 12 years and some are bathroom singers, but then we all love the music that we do, said Varun Sureka, a band member.

 The first half had the boys in white shirts and denims standing in a semi-circle, belting out Maa tujhe salam and Om shanti om, following which they joined hands as if to greet the audience with a grand namaste.

 Members took up the vocal leads, percussion, base, baritone and tenor in turns. Craig Davids Walking Away, combined with the Rangeela track Kya kare ya na kare, was most interesting.

 A live demonstration by the members showed us just how the Penn Masala members mimick instruments and sounds to perfection. After we decide on the song, verse and music, the arrangement is broken up and we assign ourselves the parts. Practice sessions are held for six to seven-hours a week on a regular basis, but before a show there are sessions for over 70 hours a week, added Varun.

 The next segment had the boys in traditional garb belting out melodies like Dil kya kare accompanied by an appeal to the crowd for a big hand for Kishore Kumar. Mix-and-match numbers like Every Breath You Take punched with Bheegey honth drew loud applause.

 At the beginning of the third session, four boys split up into two camps for a mock percussion contest. What followed was a medley of Sade dil te and Turn Me On, Dheere jalna with an enthralling classical beginning, and also Aap jaisa koi... Repeated shouts of one more called for Mere sapno ki rani.

 Calcutta has been very kind to us. It was the best audience we had, signed off the band of extraordinary boys.

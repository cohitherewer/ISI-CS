 Force in funds wrangle

 KINSUK BASU

 Calcutta Polices grand plan to upgrade in its 150th year has hit a funds flow freeze.

 The Union home ministry is ready with the Rs 18 crore required for the project, but the force has been deemed ineligible for it, having failed to spend around Rs 64 crore of an earlier central grant between 2000 and 2005.

 The ministry has attached two conditions to the release of around Rs 27 crore in fiscal 2006-07 for the modernisation of the city and state forces the state government must send a utilisation certificate for the unspent amount and also commit to pump in 25 per cent of the central funds.

 As of now, there is no indication that the government will part with its share of around Rs 6 crore, casting a cloud over the central grant coming through in the 150th anniversary year of Calcutta Police.

 The city forces share of the central grant is Rs 18 crore, which will be spent on the Calcutta Mega City Project, aiming to set up one of the most advanced systems of policing in the country.

 Weve come to know about the Centres conditions. It will not be proper to comment on it now, said Kuldiep Singh, special joint commissioner (administration).

 Sources said police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee, briefed about the developments, has asked senior officers to find a way out of the funds tangle.

 The record of Calcutta Police, or the state government, in spending funds is in stark contrast to that of the forces in Maharashtra, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, which had sent utilisation reports for earlier grants to the Centre on time and have bagged the modernisation funds.

 The top brass of the city force has drawn up a number of schemes under the Mega City project, with area traffic control topping the list.

 The system, implemented in Delhi, entails installation of micro chips at 30-plus crossings across the city. The chips will calculate the traffic volume at a given time and regulate the signals accordingly.

 Besides, the stage was almost set to instal closed-circuit TV cameras, linked with the Lalbazar control room, at 12 major crossings. This will enable officers at the headquarters to monitor traffic round-the-clock and send necessary orders to cops on the roads, said an officer. Now, all the plans will have to be put on hold.

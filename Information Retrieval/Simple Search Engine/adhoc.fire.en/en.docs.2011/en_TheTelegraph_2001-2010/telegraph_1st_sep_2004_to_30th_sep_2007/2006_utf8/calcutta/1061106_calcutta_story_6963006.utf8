 Decibel devils terrorise two households

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A week after an engineer was thrashed in Bally for protesting his wifes harassment at the hands of local youths, two families were meted out a similar treatment on Saturday night. 

 They had complained to police about local residents violating noise pollution norms. 

 The Garpar Road residence of Eastern Railway officer Sudipto Moitra and his doctor wife Suchandra was attacked thrice by local youths, who broke windowpanes and locks and threw human excreta at it. No one has been arrested.

 According to Sudipto, a soiree was held in front of his home of seven years on Saturday for Jagaddhatri puja. Even after 10 pm, the loudspeakers continued to blare. My 77-year-old mother-in-law suffers from heart disease. So, I called the local thana. 

 Policemen visited the spot and requested the organisers to turn down the volume, which they did. But after the officers left, the volume was increased again. This time, I informed deputy commissioner (eastern suburban division) Partha Sarathi Ghosh. Within minutes, policemen arrived in a van and stopped the soiree, recounted Sudipto.

 The organisers allegedly turned violent after that. They smashed the windowpanes and kept kicking the doors until the locks broke. They were screaming that they would teach us a lesson for informing police. We again called Ghosh, said Suchandra.

 Two policemen were deployed outside the house. The constables left around 5 am and immediately afterwards, the youths started throwing excreta at the house. We had no option but to call the deputy commissioner again, Sudipto said.

 Secretary of the club that organised the soiree Sipra Sinha claimed the Moitras frequently harassed its members.

 At Sonarpur, Shobha Das, in her late 30s, was beaten up and slashed in the hand with a blade. According to the complaint she lodged with police, her neighbours were using loudspeakers above the permissible volume at a private gathering a few days ago. She was beaten up when she protested.

 I could not immediately lodge a complaint because they were threatening me and my husband was out of town. I registered my complaint today after my husband returned, Das told police.

 Four persons have been detained over the incident.

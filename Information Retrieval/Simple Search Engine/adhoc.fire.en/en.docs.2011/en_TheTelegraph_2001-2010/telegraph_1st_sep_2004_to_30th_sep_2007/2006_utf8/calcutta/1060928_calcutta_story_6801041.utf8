The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Life

 Words worth

 After two-and-a-half years of 

 its existence in Calcutta, Crossword is all set to unveil 

 its second outlet at Technopolis in Sector V, Salt Lake, 

 on Sashthi. The outlet on the first floor of Indias 

 first green IT infrastructure is spread over 750 sq 

 ft, next to the food court.

 We had many choices, but we opted for Technopolis as it would have a presence of 5,000-6,000 people at any given point of time, says Sidharth Pansari, managing director, Crossword.

 The merchandise mix at the Technopolis 

 outlet would not be as deep or wide as the Elgin Road one 

 (picture above), but a title would be made available within 

 hours of placing the order. We would stock bestsellers, 

 fiction, non-fiction and Bengali books. And there would 

 be a lot of books on self-grooming too, says Sidharth.

 Based on lessons from the first store, there would be a few novelties added to the second one, to make book browsing and buying a more satisfying experience. For example, the entire place would be carpeted as it has been seen that customers prefer carpeted stores for their warmth. The display of books will also be different to help consumers, Sidharth. 

 Crossword II could even become the first 24-hour bookstore of the city if the people working in Technopolis show encouraging signs of shopping at night.

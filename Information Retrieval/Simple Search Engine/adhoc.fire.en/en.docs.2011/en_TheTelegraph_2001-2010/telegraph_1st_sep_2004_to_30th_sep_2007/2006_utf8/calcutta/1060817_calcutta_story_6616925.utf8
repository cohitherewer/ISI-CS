 What: 

 Monsoon Carnival.

 Where: Steeljunction, 

 Trinity Tower at 83 Topsia Road.

 Take a look: Its steel all the way, sexy and strong. From the bid and win contest at the stylish retail store, you could take home furniture items like dining table sets, lounge chairs and floor lamps. 

 While children got their portraits sketched, teens could get funky red crab tattoos painted on their hands or shoulders. 

 Shoppers gorged on sticky pink candy floss or enjoyed a hot cup of coffee at the Nescafe counter. All this while the live band played numbers like Another brick in the wall, Hello and Roadhouse blues.

 And the fun didnt end there. To reward customers for their loyalty, the Steeljunction privileges programme was launched for regular customers and for those who make purchases of Rs 3,000 and above. 

 The privilege card entitles you to points that may be redeemed over time through cross-promotional benefits with other stores, free home delivery, invites for seminars and workshops, and more.

 Actress Pallavi Chatterjee dropped by with plans to do up her second home entirely with the new steel look.

 Voiceover: The post-monsoon season is when most home-makers go on a buying spree. So we thought this was the perfect weekend to start a fun trend in tune with the festive season coming up, says Sumit Ray, chief of Retail Initiative, Steeljunction.

 What: Dance Carnival 2006.

 Where: Kala Mandir.

 When: August 17 and 18, 6 pm to 8 pm.

 Take a look: Get into Krrish and Munnabhai groove in what has been billed as eastern Indias largest dance carnival. Organised by Dance World Padatik (DWP), Dance Carnival 2006 will be Calcuttas biggest dance competition with some 2000 DWP students from 26 centres in Calcutta fighting it out.

 Showcased will be all major styles of western dance from salsa to hip-hop to Bollywood jazz to traditional Indian, classical and modern dance styles, said Sachetan Jalan who is heading the project. Judges will include leading artistes and industrialists.

 The presentations being put together by each DWP centre will offer a rich variety in performance styles and conception. 

 The Phoolbagan centre is working on the Rang De Basanti theme, while the AJC Bose Road centre is presenting Lage Raho Munnabhai in a medley of dance styles like kathak, kalaripathyu, thang-ta and chhau.

 It will be like an inter-para football championship, only what they will all be trying to excel in is dance. The participants have all received training at our centres, added Sachetan.

 With some 2,000 sets of costumes, 

 1,200 sets of props, plus a huge backup of light and sound 

 gizmos, the stage is set for a grand finale.

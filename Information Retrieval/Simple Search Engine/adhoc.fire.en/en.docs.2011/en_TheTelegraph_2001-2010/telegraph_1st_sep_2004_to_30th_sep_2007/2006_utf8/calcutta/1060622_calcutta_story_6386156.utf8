 Bipasha Basu with Shekhar 

 Suman and Navjot Sidhu: Laughing all the way

 She may be the surprise entry on the big screen in Phir Hera Pheri, but the small screen has a lot of Bipasha Basu to offer too. 

 She will be in the hot seat of chief guest in the mega finale of The Great Indian Laughter Challenge Dwitiya. Sporting cropped hair and dressed in a blue polka frock, Bipasha will be flanked by Shekhar Suman and Navjot Sidhu on the panel of judges.

 The show airs on Friday, June 23, at 10 pm on Star One. The finale will pick the winner of the coveted Hasi Ka Shahenshah title from among seven contenders ? Khayali Saharan from Chandigarh, Rajkumar Javkar, Tushar Shah and Rajeev Nigam from Mumbai, Pratap Fauzdar from Agra, Rauf Lala, and comic duo Ali Hasan and Irfan Malik from Pakistan. 

 They will take the stage with one goal: to get maximum number of viewer votes. SMS the first three letters of your favourite contestant?s name followed by the first letter of the surname and send it to 7827. Apart from the title, the winner will also drive away in a Chevrolet Aveo.

 On Saturday, Bipasha will be back in the small-screen spotlight in the finale of Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Ek Main Aur Ek Tu, alongside the two final Jodis. Bipasha will co-host a segment of the show and unwrap a bunch of surprises for the winners. 

 The finale, in Dubai on June 23, will be performed in front of a 4,500-strong audience. The finalists, Aishwarya-Ujjaini and Sharib-Banjyotsna, will be joined on stage by Hariharan.

 The programme airs on Zee TV on Saturday, June 24, 8 pm onwards.

 Shin Chan: Prankster

 The Nohara family is at its wit?s end coping with the little hurricane ? five-year-old Shin Chan. With a devilish charm, carefree attitude and unending curiosity for new things, Shin Chan is always up to something. 

 The adorable kid, who has a huge viewer base in Europe, Latin America and the Far East, will now come to Indian homes at 5 pm, Monday to Friday, on Hungama TV.

 ?Shin Chan, like Doraemon, 

 is one of the top three shows in the Asian region. His innocence 

 and antics form a deadly mix for children and their families,? 

 says Hungama TV COO Zarina Mehta. So, look out for the adventures 

 of Shin Chan, with sister Daisy and pet dog Lucky 

 for company.

 If you thought rock ?n? roll is wild, you haven?t watched any of them on The Simpsons yet!

The programme airs every Thursday at 8 pm on Star World.

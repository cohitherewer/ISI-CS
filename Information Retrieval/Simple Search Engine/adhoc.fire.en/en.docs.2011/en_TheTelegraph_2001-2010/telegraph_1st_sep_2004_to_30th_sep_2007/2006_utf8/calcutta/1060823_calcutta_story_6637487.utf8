 Bipasha Basu: Legwork

 Bipasha Basu, they say, does it to keep road Romeos at arms length and John Abraham does it to keep Bipasha on his arm. Preity Zinta may have been doing it to hit Shah Rukh Khan hard for limping off to Rani Mukherjee in KANK, but one wonders who Sourav Gangulys kickboxing target is C for Chappell or D for Dalmiya or

 With the Prince of Calcutta joining the growing list of celebrities jumping into the kickboxing ring, this form of martial arts that evolved in the United States in the 1970s has become todays sport in town.

 This full-contact karate has become so popular in such a short span of time because it is effective and produces instant results. A three-month stint in kickboxing increases fitness level, raises stamina and improves reflexes and concentration, says Mehul Vohra from Mumbai.

 In the ring 

 And Vohra should know, for he trained Akshay Kumar in Thai kickboxing for Seven Deadly Arts, a series on National Geographic Channel, and is training small-screen celebrities like Ronit Roy and GenX stars-in-waiting like Mahesh Bhatts son Rahul and Shatrughan Sinhas son Luv.

 Calcutta from stars to students is fast catching the strike-kick-punch craze. I had a session with Sourav last week where I started with basic exercises and some meditation. He has taken up kickboxing because he wants to be faster, more agile and completely fit, says Montu Das, who was taking Sourav through the ABC of kickboxing at the indoor gym of Eden Gardens, till his star ward came down with viral fever.

 Das is also the founder and general secretary of Kickboxing Association of West Bengal and is associated with more than 20 coaching centres suddenly flooded with youngsters wanting to master this martial arts form.

 Many youngsters are showing an interest in kickboxing because their favourite stars are taking up this sport. And yes, it does keep one fitter than any other sport does, it teaches self-defence and then there is the sporting component. Even parents are encouraging their children to kickbox, reveals Das.

 That is the reason why schools and other institutes are adding kickboxing to their list of extra-curricular activities. Das is the kickboxing coach on campuses like MP Birla, Sunrise and Marine Engineering College.

 The sport has already been recognised by the School Games Federation of India and later this year, the first National School Kickboxing Championship will be held.

 Kickboxing improves concentration levels and physical fitness. Moreover, this is a new sport and so it seems more attractive to youngsters, says B.K. Roy Choudhury, sports faculty, Marine Engineering College.

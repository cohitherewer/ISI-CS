The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 The footbridges built by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation 

 (CMC) at Dhakuria and Ballygunge (Rashbehari Avenue) are 

 useless. Most of the time, the pedestrians do not use the 

 footbridges to cross the roads and increase the risk of 

 accidents in the process. The subways at Jadavpur and Tollygunge 

 Metro stations also seem to be of no use. The commuters 

 are reluctant to climb the steps of the subways and beggars 

 and vagrants often take shelter there. What is the use of 

 investing lakhs on subways and footbridges that are hardly 

 used?

 The functioning of the Institute of Company Secretaries 

 of India seems to be peculiar. After the results of the 

 foundation course were declared, the students were given 

 only two days to enrol themselves in the intermediate course. 

 The arrangements made for enrollment by the institute were 

 not adequate. Only two staff members were distributing and 

 receiving the application forms of more than 500 students. 

 No drinking water was available to the applicants, some 

 of whom had travelled great distances. It was only after 

 the students agitated that the authorities took some steps 

 in this regard. Such negligence on the institute?s part 

 is not acceptable. I request the authorities to ensure that 

 students do not have to face such problems.

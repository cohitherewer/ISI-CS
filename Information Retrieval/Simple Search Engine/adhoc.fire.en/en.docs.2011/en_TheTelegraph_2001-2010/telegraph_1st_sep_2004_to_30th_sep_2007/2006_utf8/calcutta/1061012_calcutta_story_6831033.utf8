Ive always been fond of 

 the idea of making home-made ice-cream. Im not saying 

 that Ive made much at home myself, but Ive spent 

 years in the workplace contemplating it. I cant say 

 Im all that fond of what has happened to ice-creams 

 in recent years. When I was little, ice-cream seemed a lot 

 simpler and a lot more creamy or milky, though the world 

 just has no respect for anything thats real anymore. 

 From what I remember, ice-cream 

 was supposed to be made with fresh dairy cream, egg yolks 

 and sugar. Other than a couple of the good quality expensive 

 ones, all ice-creams these days are made with vegetable 

 fats! Just read the packaging its horrifying. 

 If you buy vanilla it will have 

 no real vanilla. Strawberry, only strawberry flavouring; 

 chocolate, no real chocolate. There should be laws against 

 that. Over the past 10 or so years there has been a big 

 push in the West to try to make even convenience foods more 

 like food again by stripping them of all the chemicals and 

 rubbish.

 Its you the people who can 

 make a difference. If you want ice-cream with cream actually 

 in it, boycott everything else.

 Ice-creams should be flavoured 

 with natural things such as fruit pulps, fresh vanilla, 

 freshly ground coffee or good quality chocolate. Sorbets 

 are generally made with a syrup base plus a fruit puree, 

 even though Ive made fantastic yoghurt and cream cheese 

 sorbets in the past. 

 The final one in this category 

 is the granita, another Italian marvel. Made with a lightly 

 sweetened liquid, favourites tend to be wine, champagne 

 and freshly brewed coffee, which is then frozen and shaved 

 or crushed before serving. Im going to give you a 

 quick simple recipe for each but then the rest Ill 

 leave up to you. 

 Vanilla ice-cream

 Boil together 500ml milk, 500ml 

 of cream and I dont care how difficult they are to 

 find or how expensive they are even if they do grow in south 

 India, but youll need two vanilla pods split down 

 the middle and the seeds scraped out. Vanilla essence here 

 just wont do. Once boiling, remove from the heat and 

 allow to infuse for one hour so you get the most out of 

 your vanilla pods. Beat together six egg yolks and 250g 

 of sugar. Boil the milk again and pour over the yolks and 

 sugar. Whisk together and pour back into the pan. Cook on 

 low heat until you see the first bubble pop on the surface, 

 quickly whisk and strain, then allow to cool. (Wash and 

 dry the vanilla pods and stick them in a jar of sugar). 

 Once cool, whisk vigorously once more then. If you have 

 one, use your ice-cream maker. Otherwise, place in the freezer 

 in a clean plastic container and beat well every hour until 

 frozen. 

 A few great things to adorn a 

 simple vanilla ice-cream: 

 Chocolate sauce, maple syrup, 

 fruit purees, a handful of roasted nuts, chocolate shavings, 

 muesli, the best of all for me, are fresh or dried fruits 

 preserved in alcohol (for instance, cherries, prunes and 

 apricots in brandy, strawberries in vodka or raisins in 

 rum).

 Fruit sorbet

 Make a syrup using equal quantities 

 of sugar and water. Bring to boil and allow to cool. Next, 

 whisk together equal quantities of the syrup and a fruit 

 puree (mango, apple, guava or grape). Then again, if you 

 have an ice-cream maker use it. Otherwise, place in the 

 freezer in a clean plastic container and beat well every 

 hour until frozen.

 Granita

 The easiest of them all. Add a 

 litre of wine or freshly brewed coffee to 120g sugar. 

 Whisk until dissolved. Place in a tray in the freezer 

 and once frozen, shave and serve immediately.

 Twin scans on soft drink

 - Doubts over outcome after hush-up of earlier probe

 JAYANTA BASU

 The Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) expos highlighting pesticide contamination in soft drinks has spurred the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government into ordering two inquiries. 

 I have asked the state pollution control board (PCB) to immediately test soft drink samples and find out the truth regarding contamination, said state environment minister Mohanta Chatterjee. 

 At Writers Buildings, consumer affairs minister Naren De confirmed that his department would also collect samples of soft drinks from various localities and conduct tests to probe the extent of pesticide peril in soft drinks. 

 We will carry out a study in our laboratories, and if we find any harmful substance in the samples, we will take action, said De. 

 The state government had initiated a similar probe three years ago, when the CSE first broke the story on pesticide contamination in soft drinks. 

 But while the government made the report on waste discharged from bottling units public and confirmed the presence of heavy metals, it remained silent on the findings on soft drinks. 

 If the government had any concern about public health, it should have made the soft drinks contamination results public, said environmentalist Subhas Dutta, expressing apprehensions about the outcome of the twin inquiries the government has ordered. 

 Echoing Dutta, Sunita Narain, director, CSE, also raised questions on the government not making the earlier report public. 

 In 2003, the governments official line of defence was the report has been forwarded to Delhi. 

 But, according to sources, the PCB report found traces of toxic pesticide Lindane and the heavy metal lead in most of the samples. While the presence of Lindane residue was around twice the limit permitted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, the lead level found in the samples was 1.2 to 1.7 times more than the WHO limit.

 According to the latest CSE report, the pesticide concentration in samples collected in Calcutta is the highest in the country around 52 times the draft BIS-standard. 

 We are absolutely confident about our results, as state-of-the-art technology was used while conducting the study, stressed Narain. 

 She, however, pointed out that variation in pesticide concentration in different soft drink samples may be due to different factors, ranging from ground water quality to quality-control measures in the bottling plants.

 Mother turns madam

 A STAFF REPORTER

 While busting a prostitution racket on Tuesday night, police raided a hotel on Sarat Bose Road and discovered that the four minor girls they rescued had been forced into the flesh trade by people close to them.

 Five persons, including two women, were arrested on the charge of intimidating the minor girls into servicing clients.

 One woman, identified as Aneesha Fatma from Ekbalpore, had pushed her 15-year-old step-daughter into the fray.

 Police found that all victims had been lured by their kin on the pretext of going on a short trip.

 ?After reaching the hotel, their kin revealed what the girls were actually required to do. The girls then started crying, but their five agents threatened them with dire consequences,? said Gyanwant Singh, deputy commissioner of police, detective department.

 Elaborating on how police busted the racket, Rajeev Mishra, deputy commissioner (special) of the detective department, said: ?We were tipped off about a group of people supplying virgins for some clients. We contacted the agents, who charged Rs 7,000 per girl for a night?s stay. They were told to come to the hotel with four girls on Tuesday night.?

 During interrogation, Fatma?s step-daughter told police about her nightmarish experience.

 ?She told me that we would go to see a movie and then have lunch in a restaurant. After reaching the hotel, she told me that I would have to spend the night with a man I had never seen before. I started weeping. She slapped me and said I would be murdered if I did not comply,? she cried.

 Singh said all the girls were from the city?s adjoining areas. ?Apart from the foster mother, the other accused had developed cordial relations with the girls and took them into confidence,? he said. 

 ?The arrested persons confessed that had they successfully pulled off Tuesday?s operation, all four girls would be sent to red-light areas the next morning,? the deputy commissioner added.

On a two-week trip to India, SUSAN FLANNERY, better 

known as The Bold and the Beautifuls Stephanie Forrester, told Pratim 

D. Gupta about what keeps the show going even after 18 years

 Susan Flannery who plays Stephanie Forrester in 

The Bold and the Beautiful

When you tell her that most of the square-eyed folks 

in India know her as Stephanie Forrester, Susan Flannery breaks into a laugh quite 

uncharacteristic of her serious scheming demeanour in The Bold and the Beautiful. 

?Most of my friends will tell you that I am totally different from the character 

I play,? she quips.

Thankfully, Susan didn?t need to play Stephanie for 

a few days. Although she is required to shoot for the longest running daytime 

soap ? shown in India on STAR World ? almost everyday, she, along with the rest 

of The Bold and the Beautiful cast and crew, was given two weeks off. And 

it was during this break that Susan had come to India, a country she ?always wanted 

to visit?.

Even though it is charity which brought Susan to India, 

she took time out to visit the Taj Mahal. ?I have come to visit the Habitat for 

Humanity centre in Chennai,? she reveals to Metro. ?After spending a week 

there, I went to Rajasthan and am now in Agra. I am really liking my stay here.?

A winner of three daytime Emmy Awards for playing 

the Forrester matriarch, Susan had even won a Golden Globe for Outstanding Acting 

Debut in a Motion Picture for Towering Inferno. ?In the US, at that time, 

working in films was considered to be good unlike working in television,? she 

recalls. ?Then the situation changed and it became fashionable to work in TV.?

But Bold and Beautiful wasn?t Susan?s first 

success story on TV. She became a big hit as Dr Laura Spencer Horton in Days 

of Our Lives, when she replaced Floy Dean in the lead role in 1967. Lack of 

motivation saw her quitting the soap in 1975. 

?I stopped acting for five years in the middle and 

was just into television production,? says Susan. ?Then Bold and the Beautiful 

happened and I returned in front of the camera. The reason I agreed to do 

it was producer Bill Bell, who is bit of a genius and I knew he would make it 

work.?

And work it did, as Bold and Beautiful not 

only went on to redefine American television but also gained incredible following 

in all the countries it was beamed in. ?The success was pretty extraordinary and 

it was special since it came at a time when the international TV market was just 

opening up,? says Susan. 

?I believe there are two reasons why the serial became 

such a huge hit. First, because it is the only daytime show to be set in Los Angeles 

and in the glamorous world of fashion. And the other reason is because it is a 

love story.?

But how has she been able to command the same respect 

and popularity through 18 long years? ?I think it?s got to do with the attitude 

I have in the soap,? feels Susan. ?When it started, the makers told me that Stephanie?s 

character is that of a woman who just really loves her family and will do anything 

to protect its interests.?

And that she has been doing even if it has meant being 

at constant loggerheads with Brooke Logan, played by Katherine Kelly Lang. ?Off 

the sets, we are all very good friends. Of course, we don?t socialise that much 

because that would mean we would keep talking about our work. But to be honest, 

we four ? John McCook (Eric), Ron Moss (Ridge), Katherine (Brooke) and me ? have 

been very lucky to be there right from Day One.?

Incidentally, Susan has also directed some episodes 

of the soap. ?It?s always fun but it is technically very challenging too. Then 

again, creatively a big high. The best thing is since the actors trust me as a 

co-actor, they trust me as a director. That?s essential to have as a director.?

Soon to be back in front of the arclights for more 

episodes of The Bold and the Beautiful, Susan doesn?t know when she will 

be back in India again. 

?It will be great if I can come back as Stephanie 

to shoot a few episodes here,? she concludes.

 Next weekend you can be at ... 

Latpanchor

 Even at the peak of the summer 

 tourist season, Latpanchor is practically deserted. And 

 that is perhaps the most attractive feature of this picture-postcard 

 hill station, 44 km from Siliguri.

 A 13-km drive from Kalijhora along the Siliguri-Gangtok national highway (NH 31A) will take you to Latpanchor. There is little traffic on the road, so the journey is pleasant. The last few kilometres are uphill, through a dense but scenic forest.

 At 4,500 ft above sea-level, Latpanchor is the highest point in Mahananda Wildlife Sanctuary. Since the hill station constitutes the core of the sanctuary, there is a high probability of coming across wild animals.

 One of the disadvantages of Latpanchor not being developed enough as a tourist spot is that there are not many lodging options. Some utility stores cater to the local residents and the few tourists who come along. 

 The British, who set up Cinchona Plantation, were also behind the establishment of Latpanchor in 1920. The plantation is spread over 1,400 acres and houses four factories that manufacture medicine from the cinchona plant.

 The Latkothi, which was once the 

 residence of the British administrators of the facility, 

 has been converted into a forest department bungalow. Cinchona 

 Plantation is four km from Latpanchor. 

 The road to the plantation is lined with cinchona, sal, teak and pine. It is ideal for a relaxed morning walk. Birdsong pervades the air at daybreak. During the stroll, you are likely to encounter rosy-cheeked children on their way to school.

 Surprisingly, this sleepy town boasts of three schools. The beauty of the local ladies is likely to leave you mesmerised.

 It?s quite fun to find the short cuts (chor bater in the local language). Rein in your exploratory zeal though, because many of the lanes and bylanes lead to the backyards of residences. With lilies and orchids in bloom, the town is a riot of colours in summer.

 Jholi Basti is ideal for an encounter with wildlife. Don?t forget your binocular and camera. Herds of deer and elephants often drift towards the area. 

 To the right of Jholi Basti, a trekking trail leads to Kurseong, while the mountain path to the left heads towards Kalimpong. 

 Those who would rather walk on the wild side can explore the jungle between Latkothi and Raja Rani Hill. Do not venture up the hill without an armed guide. There is an elephant corridor in the zone and you might find yourself in front of an unfriendly group of pachyderms. That?s not all. An encounter with a mountain bear or a leopard perched on a tree cannot be ruled out.

 The residents, however, regularly trek to the top of Raja Rani Hill to offer puja to Lord Shiva. The expedition takes eight to 10 hours. 

 Another attraction just outside Latpanchor is Aahal View Point. An early morning drive or a long walk through a beautiful road will get you there. On a clear day, Aahal offers a spectacular view of Kanchenjunga, Terai plains, Dooars and the Teesta up to Haldibari in Bangladesh. Don?t miss the sunrise here. 

 At the base of Aahal View Point, there are two lanes apart from the road that leads into town. The uphill track through cinchona and pine will take you to Namthing Pokhri, a lake around which Himalayan salamanders can be seen.

 A project on salamander breeding has been planned here, but most of the work is yet to be started. If the caretaker is in a good mood, he might catch a salamander and offer you a closer look. In summer, the lake dries up. 

 The road downhill passes Sephu, an orange orchard. One can trek from here to Sukna watchtower, located at the foothills of Mahananda Wildlife Sanctuary.

 From Latpanchor, there is also a trekking trail to Kalijhora. The route is downhill, but rather tricky. There is a distinct possibility of coming face-to-face with wild animals. 

 There are many species of birds in Raja Rani Hills, but for a bird-lover, Mana Hills is a must-visit. Swallow, babbler, swift, thrush and sunbird can be found in abundance. With a bit of luck, one might even come across a rare specimen like Fairy Bluebird. The more adventurous can go right up to Mahaldiram tea estate.

 The high-pitched call of cricket 

 and the mysterious dark jungle add to the aura of Latpanchor 

 at night. The residents of the town are not interested in 

 outsiders, but can be very warm if you strike a rapport 

 with them.

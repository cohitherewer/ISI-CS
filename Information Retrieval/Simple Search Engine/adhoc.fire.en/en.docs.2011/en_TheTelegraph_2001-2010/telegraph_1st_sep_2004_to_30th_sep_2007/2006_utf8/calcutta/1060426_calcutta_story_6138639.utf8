 Franchise denied

 - ELECTION OFFICER NOT ON VOTER LIST 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Uttam Chakraborty is part of the team that is conducting the Assembly elections, but he does not have the voting right himself. 

 A resident of Sonarpur for years, his name does not figure on the electoral list, following a change in his address.

 The 45-year-old South Eastern Railway employee, who has been appointed as a polling officer, had been living in a rented house on Ram Ratan Ghosh Road, under Sonarpur police station, since his birth. 

 He has been a regular voter, but a problem cropped up when he shifted his residence to MN Roy Road, in the same locality, two years ago. 

 His name, and also of his parents and brothers, were deleted from the voter?s list.

 ?I contacted the office of the returning officer and was told to apply in an official format with all supporting documents. I did that. After going through the documents, they scheduled the hearing for December 15, 2005. The officials were satisfied with my submission, but after the final list was published, I found my name missing,? Chakraborty told Metro.

 While he was doing the rounds of the district election office to get his name included in the list, he received a letter from the Election Commission stating that he had been appointed as a polling officer. ?Just imagine my condition, I have no right to vote but I will conduct the poll,? he said. 

 Chakraborty later came to know that not just his name, but that of his parents and brothers, too, were deleted from the list.

 ?I approached the election officials again. They asked me to submit separate applications for my family members but could not give any assurance that we would be able to exercise our franchise this time,? Chakraborty said.

 When contacted, South 24-Parganas district magistrate Roshni Sen, who is also returning officer of the district, said she would look into the matter. ?I will check what exactly has happened. But right now, nothing can be done.?

 even young artists from Santiniketan exhibit their works in this exposition titled, Wait for Us. The title here is an elaboration on the concept of the waiting room which, in turn, is a retake on the idea of contemporaneity/ modernity used here as inter-changeable terms. Anirban Mitra works out a design, based on his perception of the external world and then projects his configurations in hieroglyphic forms. Bilasindu Sils world revolves around plush advertisement hoardings peering from highrises and chic models appearing in glossy magazines. He imagines a surrealistic world when these segments will become reality. Swapna Biswas world is one of friction where public and private experiences clash. Mrinmoy Deb Barmas universe is fragmented by violence and bloodshed. Haraprasad Tripathy (one of his paintings appears above) tries to bridge the gap between the past and the present. Shova Chowdhury works on a memory space where the narratives of past and future projections work on the layered planes. Sandip Sen explores the surface and depths of the canvas where sexual imageries and the possible transformation map are addressed together. 

Event: An exhibition of paintings by a number of budding talents from Santiniketan 

When: Till November 27; 11 am - 7 pm 

Where: Gandhara Art Gallery, 1B Gurusaday Road, Flat 5A

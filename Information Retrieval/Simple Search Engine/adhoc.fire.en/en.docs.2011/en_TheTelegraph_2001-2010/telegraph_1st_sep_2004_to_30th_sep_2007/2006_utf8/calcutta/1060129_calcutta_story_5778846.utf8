E-tools for tourists

- Downloads bridge barriers 

TechTalk

Have you ever wished for a free translator on a holiday 

to a foreign country, where the language barrier is too daunting and difficult 

to cross? Come April, the wish of thousands of tourists will turn into reality.

With the onset of new technology, leafing through 

language dictionaries and struggling to get the message across by playing dumb 

charades will become a thing of the past. Playing genie in this case is Rough 

Guides, the company most famous for its travelogues. 

In April this year, all 16 of its phrase books will 

be relaunched in new editions ? each book is updated every two years. To make 

them user-friendly, the actual phrases will be available in an audio format on 

the Rough Guides website. These can be downloaded onto palmtops, iPods and even 

MP3 cell phones.

?So you can get your pronunciation right, or even 

plug the headphones into the other person?s ear to make them understand what you 

want, without a hitch in a foreign country,? explained Kevin Fitzgerald, managing 

director, Rough Guides. 

In town for the Book Fair ? Penguin is the Indian 

publisher of the series ? he added that the masterplan is to use technology to 

help travellers. There are already about 30-40 e-books available for download 

from the Rough Guides website at around ?3-4 (about Rs 300), said Fitzgerald. 

There will be more titles added to the list in 2006. 

?These can be downloaded into PCs, laptops, palmtops 

and even iPods, but how much is possible depends on the platform,? he clarified. 

The interactive digital city maps are also downloadable from the website, at a 

price.

But it is the popularity of the iPod compared to the 

palmtop that has prompted the company to be even more user-friendly. A new feature 

is podcasts, which run to about 45 minutes each, and can be downloaded for free. 

There are about 10 at the moment, with more to be added soon. 

?It was launched in December, so we have to wait a 

few months to see how people respond to that. But listening makes the experience 

more alive and expressive. Maybe, in future, there will be walking tours in cities, 

like a guide through Park Street!? smiled Fitzgerald.

A few years ago, the publication branched out into 

other areas, including music, movies and technology, with The Rough Guide To 

The Internet selling over five million copies. The company has over 300 titles 

under its banner, with a sale of approximately 10 million books last year.

?We have grown by 50 per cent in the past three years,? 

claims the managing director.

The expansion plans are influenced by technological 

innovations. So the focus for the future is dissemination of information through 

multiple media, rather than more new titles.

?We do add titles, but they have to be economical. 

Our non-travel segments have been very popular, like The Rough Guide To Conspiracy 

Theories and The Rough Guide To The Da Vinci Code (it was on the top 

35 list on the Amazon.com charts). Among the new ones released in 2005 are Macs 

and OS X (September) and Book of Playlists (October).? 

New Zealand and Croatia are two bestsellers among 

the newer travel titles, while the all-time favourites are New York and London.

India has a big part to play in Rough Guides?s plans 

for 2006 and beyond. The India office?s claim to the company?s fame, set up three 

years ago in Delhi, is that it has done the content management system and design 

for the new-look website to be updated this year. The existing talent pool and 

?product potential? has also prompted the company to start publishing books in 

India.

Coming up are Rajasthan and Kerala for the global 

market, and Bangladesh and Karnataka for the local market. And a rough guide to 

cricket.

?Also, we have decided to do one on Bob Dylan with 

an Indian perspective. We already have a book on him, but this country seems to 

have a special relationship with Dylan?s music. For us, India is an important 

market because it is an emerging destination internationally and nationally, while 

Indians are increasingly travelling abroad, too,? said the Londoner.

He attributes the success of the various titles and 

the popularity of the different mediums to ?a cultured sort of reader?, who wants 

not just the basic information of how to go and where to stay. The traveller today 

wants to derive the essence of the destination.

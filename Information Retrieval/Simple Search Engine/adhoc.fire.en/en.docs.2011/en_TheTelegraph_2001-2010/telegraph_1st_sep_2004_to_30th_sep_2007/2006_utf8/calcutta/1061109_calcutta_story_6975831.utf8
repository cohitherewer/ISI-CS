 Sip champagne on a swing or laze 

 with a Lady Perfect on a double-sized deckchair by the iridescent 

 blue pool, even as you tuck into a Seafood Salad in Salsa 

 Picante or a portion of Grilled Tenderloin 

 The Cal Pinxo in Barcelona, Da 

 Puny in Portofino or La Decolle in Brittany would promise 

 you almost everything from fondue in the Alps to shellfish 

 by the sea.

 Aqua, the brand new wine-dine 

 den at The Park poolside, brings an al fresco bar 

 and dining experience for the first time to the eastern 

 part of the country.

 Aqua is yet another boutique 

 experience, an outstanding designer outdoor concept that 

 will offer a completely different level of personalised 

 entertainment at a super-premium luxury level, promises 

 Salmoli Mukerji, director, public relations, The Park Hotels.

 The cool pool, with the sky as 

 canopy, forms the centrepiece around which wooden loungers 

 and deckchairs are placed and interesting nooks and corners 

 are created. The pool, with underwater illumination, captures 

 the changing colours of the sky.

 The restaurant has two sections 

 the open sundeck and the indoor air-conditioned lounge-seating 

 dining area. The mood in the spacious outdoors keeps changing 

 all the time, in sync with the tone of light falling over 

 it. So, the daytime lounging area by the poolside becomes 

 a chill-out zone in the evening, complete with DJ tracks.

 Its 12 to 12 fun-food 

 dining with an easy international menu and an exhaustive 

 list of cocktails, and both classic and contemporary world 

 wines. The outdoors concept is extremely popular in Europe 

 during fair weather and we are proud to create that luxurious 

 ambience in the heart of busy Park Street, declares 

 Anirban Simlai, director, food and beverage, The Park, Calcutta.

 Perched on top of the pool at 

 one end is a jacuzzi where you can take a dip while enjoying 

 a Flaming Lamborghini (vodka, kahlua, cointreau and Baileys), 

 an Ants in the Pants (gin, sweet vermouth, Grand Marnier, 

 lemon juice) or your favourite malt.

 The open sundeck, at the other 

 end next to the AC lounge-restaurant, provides a marine 

 mood, morphing into a pad for relaxed repartee at night. 

 Two champagne pavilions overlooking the pool are intimate 

 zones for lounging, drinking and dining, while there are 

 mushroom settee-seating contraptions to complete the chill 

 feel.

 The cuisine is fun and eclectic. 

 You can help yourself to a Mexican Tortilla Wrap with peppers, 

 tofu, onions, jalapeno and sour cream or a rare Prosciutto 

 e Melone (Italian Parma ham, rock melon and oregano oil), 

 besides a spread of pastas and risottos.

 A sandwich and panini corner rustles 

 up international delicacies like Grilled Panini with artichokes, 

 mushroom, onion, cocktail dressing, coleslaw and French 

 fries and Multi-grain Tomato and Mozzarella Grilled Sandwich 

 with Russian salad and chilly sauce.

 Among Aqua specialities, there 

 are dishes like Stir-fried Tofu with Garlic and Peas Pulao, 

 Thai Green Curry with Chicken or Vegetables, Steamed Rice 

 and Grilled Jumbo Prawns Head on Soft Vegetables and Potenta 

 Mash and Asparagus.

 The Aqua dessert menu beckons 

 with Hot Chocolate Fudge, English Sticky Date Pudding, Walnut 

 and Lemongrass Parfait and much more

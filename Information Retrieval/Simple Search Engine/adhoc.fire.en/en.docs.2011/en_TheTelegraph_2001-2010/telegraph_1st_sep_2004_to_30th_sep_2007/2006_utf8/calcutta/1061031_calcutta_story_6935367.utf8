 Master of colours

 Beginning his love affair with landscapes over three decades ago, painter K.C. Murukesan has remained unconditionally loyal to his favourite theme of representation. His forte lies in mixing colours and creating uncommon shades that give his works their distinctive appeal. Awesome, breathtaking blues that spring upon the viewer in staggering succession (Sea Rock; picture above), magnificent white snow-clad landscapes, mountains wrapped in cloudy mists of hazy colours and a close-up of blossoms in bright shades highlight Murukesans expertise in handling colours. Partially realistic and partially abstract, his paintings are remarkable for their unusual backgrounds. He uses canvas-space effectively to produce an effect of vastness, often employing the long-shot technique of photography to great advantage. The artists chief achievement, however, lies in a near perfect combination of colours, making the mood of the weather come through in most of his works.

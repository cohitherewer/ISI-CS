 A moment from Shadows of Time

Bobby Bedi, best known as the producer of Mangal 

Pandey The Rising, on distributing Shadows of Time and targeting 

the multiplex audience. 

What prompted you to take up Shadows of Time for distribution?

The film was shot nearly two-and-a-half years ago. 

I knew about the film then, and I also knew the director and the script. Its 

an outstanding film and also very expensive a Bengali film made at a cost of 

Rs 17-18 crore. Shadows is a sentimental film, so we thought it would do 

well in India.

What ingredients does Shadows have for it to click with the audience here?

Its a film with Indian sensibility. But Shadows 

is not a Monsoon Wedding, which was set in a traditional Indian background 

but where the sensibility was western. Shadows is a tear-jerking Hindi 

film, but more understated. You will cry when you see it. Florian has handled 

both the language and the city of Calcutta very sensitively. He is a very sensitive 

director, and considering that he didnt know the language he has done a splendid 

job.

Do you feel that the essence of Calcutta and of Bengaliness have come 

out well in this film?

I lived in Calcutta in the Eighties and I havent 

seen Calcutta being captured so beautifully in any film other than Shadows 

of Time. I was very impressed with the way the city was shown in 36 Chowringhee 

Lane, but I wasnt so impressed during a more recent viewing.

I thought Florian would see the city dispassionately 

as an outsider. But he is as passionate and possessive about the city as a Calcuttan. 

Though its an external view, I think Florian has understood Calcutta better than 

many non-Calcuttan Indians.

Where all in India will Shadows release?

We wont go for a massive release. After the Calcutta 

release on September 8, we will take Shadows to Mumbai, Delhi, Pune, Bangalore 

and Chennai.

Are you primarily targeting the Bengali audience in other Indian cities as well?

We are targeting Bengalis as well as non-Bengalis, 

but mainly the multiplex audiences. The idea is to make the film successful in 

the multiplexes. I think the film has got enough melodrama.

What other films does your company Kaleidoscope have in the pipeline?

Next we are doing Lajjo, with Aamir Khan and 

Kareena Kapoor. It will be directed by Mani Ratnam and A.R. Rahman is doing the 

music. Then theres Shaji Karuns Suryamukhi that is based on painter Raja 

Ravi Varmas life; Vidya Balan is playing the female lead.

We are also doing the Mahabharata for both 

TV and celluloid. Its a huge project. We have broken up the stories and a years 

research has already gone into that. JJ Vallaya is designing the costumes.

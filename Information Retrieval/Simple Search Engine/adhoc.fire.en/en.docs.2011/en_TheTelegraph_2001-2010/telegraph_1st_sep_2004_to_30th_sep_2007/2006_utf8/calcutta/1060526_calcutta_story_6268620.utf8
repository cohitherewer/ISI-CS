The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Take off, health tours

 SANJAY MANDAL

 Emirates airline will fly down a team of Dubai doctors to Calcutta this year in a bid to boost health tourism.

 ?Patients from West Asia traditionally travel to Mumbai for treatment. But other Indian cities like Calcutta also have much to offer,? said Nabil Sultan, senior vice-president (commercial operations, West Asia and Indian Ocean) of the airline. ?The team will visit hospitals in the city and interact with the doctors.?

 To encourage patients from West Asia to visit the city, the airline, which launched flights between Calcutta and Dubai two months ago, will also offer other services.

 ?We will book hotel rooms for the patients and their relatives and set up appointments with doctors,? Sultan stated.

 ?This is part of our strategy to create business in the sector where we start operations,? he explained.

 The airline followed the same tactic in Hyderabad, where it started operations recently. ?A good number of patients who used to fly to Mumbai are now flying to Hyderabad. We are expecting a similar response in Calcutta,? the executive claimed.

 Last year, a Confederation of Indian Industry delegation visited United Arab Emirates to showcase Calcutta as an affordable and quality healthcare destination.

 ?Entrepreneurs in Dubai had shown interest in setting up hospitals in the city,? said Sajal Dutta, president, Association of Hospitals of Eastern India, and a member of the CII delegation. 

 ?Patients from West Asia used to visit hospitals in the US or UK. The trend has changed. They are now looking at healthcare destinations in the East,? he added.

 According to Dutta, Calcutta has the potential to become a popular healthcare destination as it provides medical services at affordable rates.

 Emirates is also eyeing other kinds of tourists, including those from outside West Asia. The airline will bring delegations of tour operators from Europe and West Asia to Calcutta.

 ?We will hold talks with the state tourism board for a possible tie-up. Calcutta has the potential to attract leisure traffic from Europe, the US and other parts of the world,? said Sultan.

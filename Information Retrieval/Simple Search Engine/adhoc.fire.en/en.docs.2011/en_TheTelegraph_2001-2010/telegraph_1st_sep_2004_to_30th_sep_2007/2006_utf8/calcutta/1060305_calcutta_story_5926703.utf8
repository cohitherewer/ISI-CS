 Next weekend you can be at ... 

Ravangla

 The South district, with an area of only 750 sq km, is the smallest district of Sikkim. Hemmed in by the other three districts, South Sikkim is garlanded by its two major rivers ? the Teesta and the Rangit.

 The area, in fact, is longitudinally divided into two approximately equal watersheds by the mountain ridges.

 Through the lush greenery, the Teesta meanders down to the plains, making for a mesmerising sight. On clear days, one can view the mighty Kanchenjunga from as far off as Namchi.

 Ravangla, a small town in the district, has made a place for itself on the tourist map of Sikkim because of its natural splendour and the number of getaways surrounding it.

 Situated at a height of 6,000 ft, the town also serves as a transit for tourists heading for various destinations in South and West Sikkim.

 Right in front of the town is the Mainam Hill. The 3,140-m summit is a five-hour walk from Ravangla bazaar. Close by is another hill called Bhaleydunga, which means a stone shaped like a rooster, in Sikkimese.

 The view of the Yanggang village, its marketplace and the Teesta from the top of Mainam Hill will take your breath away. Those suitably trained can retrace the famous British botanist Sir Joseph Hooker?s treacherous route to the village.

 Numerous short nature trails start from the town. Take the one to Borong for a glimpse of the rural life and traditional Sikkimese culture. One of the two hot springs in the area is located here.

 The Tendong, rising to an altitude of 10,300 ft, overlooks the Ravangla bazaar. The view from the summit is unmatched in this part of the world.

 Kanchenjunga dominates the horizon, dwarfing the richly forested mountains around it. When the sun is out, Kalimpong and Darjeeling can be seen in the south, while the India-China border is visible in the north.

 A rocky spur juts out from a ridge near the hill and remains suspended above the Yanggang village.

 Namchi, the district headquarters, is just 33 km from Ravangla. On the way is the only tea estate in Sikkim, the Temi Tea Garden. Its produce is highly sought after in the international market. The Temi Guest House, in the midst of the garden, is a legacy of the Raj and the perfect place to spend a leisurely day. 

 Back at Ravangla, drop in at the Kemphemnling Tibetan settlement for some shopping. Beautiful Tibetan carpets and other souvenirs are sold here. On one of the mornings, head for the Rayong Sunrise View Point on the Ravangla-Rayong road for a spectacular start to the day.

 A walk down to Shar Chok Bhepu, one of the four holiest caves in Sikkim, is just as memorable. It is located in a village called Sangmo, a few km from Ravangla, on the slope facing the Teesta.

 According to local lore, Guru Rinpoche emerged as a vulture from Shar Chok Bhepu after prolonged meditation at another holy cave, Khando Sang Phug.

 The famous Kagyupa Monastery is in Ralong, 12 km from Ravangla. It was built in 1730, during the time of the ninth Karmapa Wangchuk Dorjee.

 Some distance above it is the newly-built Palchen Choeling Monastery, one of the largest in Sikkim. The annual Mahakal ritual dance is performed here in November every year.

 Ralong also has the other hot spring in the region, the Ralong Tsa-Chu, an hour?s walk downhill from the settlement.

 About three km down the Ravangla-Kewzing road, in a thick forest, is the Doling Gompha. Drive on some more towards Kewzing and climb up two km to visit the Mangbrue Gompha.

 Built on a ridge in 1850, the Bhutanese army had built bunkers and an outpost here in the 19th Century.

 On the way to Kewzing is the only Bon monastery in Sikkim. Established in the late 1980s, it symbolises the determination of the local community to preserve its religious roots.

 Village tourism is being aggressively promoted in Ravangla. Infrastructure has been developed in hamlets around the town, like Yanggang, Kewzing, Berfung, Bakhim and Tinkitam, to attract tourists.

 Ravangla is also the perfect destination for those with an appetite for adventure. The Sikkim Tourism Development Corporation organises a hike in October-November, known as Coronation Trek.

 It starts from Rumtek and finishes at Yuksum, via Ravangla. A favourite among adventure tourists, the trek is a great way to discover Ravangla?s charms.

 A bold, experimental production with a distinct political message, Sansriti?s latest play, Phataru, challenges the audience to accept it with its radical message or leave it as it is. Based on a story by Nabarun Bhattacharya, it indicates a movement towards building a classless society. The plot revolves around the revolutionary struggles of the subaltern class in its attempts to destroy the foundations of capitalism. Structurally supported by an apparently absurd and loose plot, the play introduces the audience to its three eccentric characters: Madan, Purandhar Bhatt and DS. In its use of unrealistic dramatic devices, such as its flying militants who can take flight on chanting their magical mantra, Phat Phat Sai Sai, and a richly metaphoric but imaginary language, the radical thoughts and ideas of the three protagonists can be found hidden. Direction: Debesh Chattopadhyay.

 Event: Play in Bengali, Phataru, produced by Sansriti 

When: Today at 6.30 pm

 Verbal vet for hospital odd jobs

 KINSUK BASU

 A reference is all it took for Munna Guchhait to become a Group D employee of Belle Vue Clinic. In some other hospitals, Group D appointments are made through a token screening test. The rest leave it to the judgment of employment agencies.

 Late on Monday, Guchhait allegedly molested a 15-year-old girl while he was wheeling her to her ward after a skin-graft surgery on her leg, following a road mishap. 

 We generally go by the recommendation of our employees. We had recruited Munna on the basis of his father Nagendras recommendation. Nagendra was one of our best cleaning staff members. We had no reason to suspect anything. Its unfortunate that such a thing occurred. But then, at times, you do have black sheep in a flock, said Pradip Tandon, spokesperson for Belle Vue Clinic.

 The nursing home generally appoints Group D staff on the basis of word-of-mouth reports. Most other hospitals in the city rely on employment agencies. At times, the experience of other hospitals determines the selection of agency. New firms are also taken on.

 We supply candidates to nearly five major hospitals and nursing homes across the city. The system works basically on trust. We seek the bio-data of candidates, containing the family background, and voter identity card. Those who have cleared at least Class IX are considered, explained Babloo Hait, who runs Golf Green-based Ritu Enterprise.

 At times, I have received complaints about attendants seeking tips from the patients kin. But there has never been a case where the moral character of one of my boys has been questioned, he asserted.

 AMRI Hospitals president S.B. Purakyastha claimed: When we appoint an agency, we give it our criteria. We insist that the candidate should have a clean chit from police, a pleasant personality and should have cleared Class XII.

 According to Sajal Dutta of Ruby Hospital, as a safeguard, a nurse accompanies the attendant while a female patient is being shifted. 

 The unions make recommendations regarding appointments but those are handled with care. Besides, we hold a screening test. We have outsourced the appointment of cleaning staff to a Malaysian agency a few days ago, stated Rupak Barua, director (development), CMRI and BM Birla Heart Research Institute.

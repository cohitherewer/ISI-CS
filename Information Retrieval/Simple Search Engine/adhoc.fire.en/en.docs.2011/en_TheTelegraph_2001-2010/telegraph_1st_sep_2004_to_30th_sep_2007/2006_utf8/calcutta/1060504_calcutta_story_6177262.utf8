 Theatre is a potent vehicle of social reform. As such, people involved in it are considered to be socially conscious and responsible citizens. Ek Rasik Doubarik, however, raises an important question regarding the morality of those supposed to lead by example. Tragedy strikes the village of Abinashpur, when Balai, a local youth, is killed by anti-socials at the venue of the performance of a play by Anyamanan, a popular theatre group from Calcutta. Naturally, the performance is abandoned midway and the group heads back to the city. A year later, the group is again asked to stage the same play on Balai?s death anniversary. But, on that very day, it has been invited to perform at the prestigious national drama festival in Delhi and is sure of winning national accolades. Subhajit Sengupta, its leader, is now faced with a dilemma between professional success and humane obligation. Drama and direction: Ramaprosad Banik.

 Event: Play in Bengali, Ek Rasik Doubarik, produced by Barasat Anusilani 

When: Today at 6 pm 

Where: Bharatiyam Cultural Multiplex, IB-201 Salt Lake

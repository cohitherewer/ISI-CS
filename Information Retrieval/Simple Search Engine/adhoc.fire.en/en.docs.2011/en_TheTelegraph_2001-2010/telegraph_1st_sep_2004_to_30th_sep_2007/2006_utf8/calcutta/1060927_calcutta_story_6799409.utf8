The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Hips dont lie for her 

 FARAH KHAN talks to Pratim D. Gupta about Shakira and Kareena, Jaan-E-Mann and Om Shanti Om

 Shah Rukh Khan and Kareena Kapoor in Don

 Lets get this straight first Is Shakira doing an item 

 number for your next film Om Shanti Om?

 It is a figment of imagination of the Mumbai newspapers. She is doing no such number for my film. The only thing Shakira ever said was that the only person shes heard of in Bollywood is Shah Rukh Khan. Now, that was made out to be that Shakira is dancing in my next film which stars and is produced by Shah Rukh.

 So there has been no agreement between you and Shakira?

 See, she wants me to do a music video for her. But you know, with these people you cant take it for granted. She is saying something now but later on she may not necessarily do it.

 What was it like to make her dance?

 Oh nice. Very nice. She is a fantastic dancer. Theres no two ways about that. Her body is very flexible. What helped was the fact that Indians and Cubans have similar hip structure.

 And hips dont lie

 (Laughs) No they dont. I gave her a few Indian mudras and she looked very good doing that. There has been talk that I didnt give her a lot of steps.

 But you have to keep in mind the fact that unlike here, where our stars just lip-sync the songs, Shakira was actually singing it on stage and dancing at the same time. And to dance and sing together is really difficult. So I kept the steps simple, yet Indian.

 Farah Khan 

 Jaan-e-Mann is looking stunning. You have used 

 a lot of silhouettes in the song picturisations

 The reason we have kept that look is because for Jaan-e-Mann I didnt get the 100 dancers from New York that I got for Karans (Johar) film (Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna). So we just used four to five dancing couples who would dance in silhouettes in the foreground while the main characters Preity (Zinta), Salman (Khan), Akshay (Kumar) would dance in the background.

 I can easily say that Jaan-e-Mann is one of my best works till date.

 You got very emotional on Jhalak Dikhhla Ja when 

 Rati Agnihotri was eliminated

 Thats more because of her dancing partner Feroze, who has been my assistant for the last 12 years. So, it got really touchy. They didnt deserve to go out so early.

 Who should win Jhalak Dikhhla Ja?

 I think Shveta Salve and Mahesh Manjrekar are the two best dancers in the competition. In the final four I would like to see Sveta, Mahesh, Ajay (Jadeja) and Mona (Singh).

 Coming back to movies, you have done the Yeh mera 

 dil number with Kareena Kapoor in Farhan Akhtars Don

 Yes, there was a lot of pressure on me. It is a legendary Helen number. Anything different or modern I would have tried to do with that dance would have looked like a T-Series remix dance. So I kept it very retro and tried to keep some of the original moves. Kareenas looking gorgeous and shes danced well. Poor Shah Rukh does not have much to do in the song apart from standing and being seduced by Kareena!

 Did you watch the original song-and-dance again before 

 choreographing?

 Yes, I did watch it again but let me tell you it is not one of Helen auntys best numbers. There is a nostalgia involved for sure, but thats it.

 Farhan has been saying how Don is like a dream 

 project for all the cast and crew members. Was it special 

 for you too?

 Not really. I liked Don but it is not one of my all-time favourite films. I also do not believe in remaking films. I still have original stories to tell. Good, bad or ugly, my film will not be compared to some other film made at some point in history. But if other people want to do it, they can go ahead.

 And at one point, there was talk of Om Shanti Om 

 being a Karz remake

 My film is a completely original script because I would personally never remake another film. Its like people have been there, done that; why do it again?

 After your husband Shirish Kunders Jaan-e-Mann, 

 now its your brother Sajid Khan

 Oh, he will make a fabulous film I can tell you that. Hey Baby is a very emotional script. I may just do a couple of songs because it will coincide with Om Shanti Om, which starts mid-December. And I am sure we will be fighting all over again.

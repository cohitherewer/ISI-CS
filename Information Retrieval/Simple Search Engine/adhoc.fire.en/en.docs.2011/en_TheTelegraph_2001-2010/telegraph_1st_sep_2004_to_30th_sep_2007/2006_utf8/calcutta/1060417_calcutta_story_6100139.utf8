What: Thats Amore, a pizza and pasta 

promotion. 

 Where: La Terrasse at The Oberoi Grand.

 When: Till April 30.

 The spread: With Bengali flavours ruling the tables for the past one week, this definitely comes as a welcome change for foodies. On offer is an assortment of exclusive pastas and pizzas. Spaghetti Rustici (rustic-style spaghetti with sun-dried tomato, red wine, chilli flakes and tomato), Penne All Amatriciana (traditional Pancetta and tomato sauce with chilli flakes, from the region of Amatrice), Ravioli Alla Boscaiola (ricotta, porcini and fresh mushroom filled ravioli with cream cheese sauce) and more form the pasta section. Here you can choose from varieties that serve as the appetiser (a smaller portion) as well as the main course.

 If you like your pasta light then opt for Fusilli Pinolati (with peanuts, roasted bell pepper, garlic, spinach and parmesan).

 The pizza menu includes Pizza Margherita (thin crust pizza with tomato, mozarella cheese and basil), Pizza Ai Frutti Di Mare (with shrimp, squid, crabmeat and salmon) and Taverna (with Parma ham, goat cheese and arugula). To dig into a complete cheesy delight, go for Pizza Quattro Formaggio (mozarella, gorgonzola, goat cheese and parmesan).

 Pocket pinch: Prices start at Rs 325.

 Voiceover: We are not serving Indianised versions of pastas and pizzas. It is an effort to serve food lovers classic authentic delights, smiles Manas Krishnamoorthy, F amp;B manager, The Oberoi Grand. 

 Cool cuppa

 What: Opening of Infinitea, the tea room. 

 Where: 18, Rabindra Sarani, Gate 2, Poddar Court.

 When: April 14, 4 pm onwards.

 Take a look: The place done up with antique lamps, photographs of old Calcutta and tea gardens, and walls in cheerful orange and yellow, is an eclectic blend of the old world cha haunt and a modern hangout zone. 

 To mark the launch, the 5,000 sq ft tea address was done up with colourful balloons and streamers. Peppy English numbers played in the background. 

 From the regular Nimbu Cha and Masala T to the special Darjeeling in a cup, Kashmiri Kahwa and Assam Liquid Gold, there are 89 varieties to choose from.

 For some like the Blue Curacao, Banana and Butter Scotch, it is the tea tang that rules. Varieties like Black Currant, Grape, Strawberry and Pomegranate are sweet with a distinct flavour.

 Open from 7 am to 11 pm, Infinitea offers breakfast, lunch, brunch, high tea and dinner. The food spread focuses on continental delicacies. 

 The menu includes Scrambled Eggs, Baked Beans On Toast, Spaghetti Puttanesca, Mousakka, Spicy Malay Noodles and more.

 Pocket pinch: Prices of tea start at Rs 20 a cup.

 Voiceover: It is an effort to promote a healthy and unadulterated drink along with good food and a warm ambience. Five more outlets are in the pipeline, said director B.K. Saria, aiming to revive the romance over a tea cup.

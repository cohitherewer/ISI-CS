 we are family: Preity Zinta with the Pogo Amazing Kids Awards 2006 finalists

 All of Saturday, they practised how they would react when they were called up on stage to receive the prize. But none of the children knew which one of them would get the trophy the day after, when the eight winners of the Pogo Amazing Kids Awards 2006 were announced.

 So on Sunday, at Goregaon Film City, when the victorious name called in the artist category turned out to be Pallavi Mazumder, the Class IX student of Vidya Bharati Girls High School, New Alipore, knew exactly what to do.

 I got my prize from TV star Mona Singh, says the quiet girl who kept her promise before the finals of making Bengal proud.

 The POGO Kids Awards recognises exceptional talent among youngsters upto 14 years of age in eight categories. The eight winners from the 24 finalists were decided by votes received from kids across India. The finalists had been selected through detailed assessment by a jury comprising Kiran Bedi (for leader), Shakuntala Devi (for genius), Shantanu Moitra (for musician), Bose Krishnamachari (for artist), Kunal Kohli (for entertainer), Anita Ratnam (for dancer), Charu Sharma (for sports), Vasundhara Das (for singer) and Derek OBrien who judged all the categories with the panel.

 Winning entailed other duties, like dancing with Preity Zinta. I met her backstage. She congratulated me and said I was becoming a celebrity like her. The surprise of the Preity show was when the children were told to to dance with the heroine. A team from Shiamak Davars institute had taught us a few steps but when we joined her, we were just asked to freak out. Jani na ki rokom dekhte lagbe, mused the young painter from Nehru Childrens Museum, sounding worried about the telecast on Sunday.

 Pallavi also made a number of friends Isha Dang (leader category finalist), Rajkumari Sanathoi (winner, dancer) and Varsha Mahapatra of Orissa. The universal favourite was six-year-old skater Muskan Vijay from Gwalior. She ran to the stage to take the entertainers prize from Anupam Kher and then came to console a namesake older to her in my category!

 Now, with exams approaching, the brush with stardom is over and its back to books for Pallavi.

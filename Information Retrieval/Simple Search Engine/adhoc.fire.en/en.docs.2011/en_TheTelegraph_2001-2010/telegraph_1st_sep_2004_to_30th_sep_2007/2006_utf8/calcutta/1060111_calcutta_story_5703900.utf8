Life

 All for a classy clink 

 HOUSE PROUD 

 Choosing them, keeping them and placing them right... a lot goes into raising that perfect toast. Shradha Agarwal draws up a guide to glasses

 Glasses as we all know can make or break a drink. How many to buy, what kind to stock, how to prevent a crack... the list of glass-related worries is long but it all looks worthwhile when raising that special toast with the people who matter.

 Presenting the GoodLife guide to glasses, to help perfect that clink.

 Set it up

 If an elaborate set-up is not what you are looking at, three kinds of glasses are enough to make a comfortable combination.

 Every house must have a few sleek Collins glasses that go with water, juice, lassi, cold drinks and other cocktails and drinks. Next in line are some short old-fashioned glasses that hold whisky and other drinks served on the rocks. The final variety should be wine glasses, says Sovan Mukherjee, manager at Shisha, the citys first hookah bar. 

 While this order makes for a minimalist home, Yuvraj Johar, executive assistant manager of F amp;B at Taj Bengal, suggests an elaborate glass gallery with a wider range. Include eight champagne tulips, about four martini glasses and some shooters to complete the picture. You can also buy champagne saucers for setting mousse or serving fruits. 

 Once you zero in on the kinds you want, choose the individual pieces with utmost care. Sometimes the rim of the glass can feel very sharp. You should choose slender rims that are well hardened, says bar expert Irrfan Khan. 

 While designer glasses look charming, comfort shouldnt be ignored. Pick glasses that feel right when you hold them, the stem not more than three or four inches, adds Irrfan. 

 Pick a place

 Placing them right is also important. A traditional European table, says Yuvraj, sees a large water goblet near the tip of the knife on the right hand side of the plate, with a smaller white wine glass and a medium red wine glass placed at an angle near the water goblet. Though the water glass is usually set on the right internationally, traditional Indian tables can afford to take some liberties, he adds.

 Bar basics 

 The right drink in the right glass is just the beginning for bar dos and donts. Keep the glass in the freezer for a few minutes before you pour a drink like white wine or an exotic cocktail, says Sovan.

 Rolling two cubes of ice inside the glass also brings the temperature down. Hold the glass by the stem while serving or sipping, lest you end up warming up your chilled drink too fast.

 Crystals, coloured or cut glasses are great to look at, but Irrfan warns that these glasses can sabotage the drink itself.

 The garnishing too has to balance the size and shape of the tumbler. Your glass should not end up looking like a salad bowl, says Irrfan. So, while a slice of lime or cherry is enough for a martini glass, you can play around with a pineapple cone or a fancy arrangement on a taller one. But make sure that it complements the shape of the glass and drink, keeping the colour contrast in mind.

 Mind-it mantra

 Glasses are the most easily breakable items in any kitchen all over the world. But the right way to wash them is to soak them in lukewarm water to which some soap solution is added. Rinse them finally in regular flowing tap water if warm tap water is not available, suggests Debabrata Roy, associate director, kitchen stewarding, at The Park. 

 While lipstick marks usually come off with soapy water, heavier stains are removed by adding a few drops of vinegar in it. Be extra careful about the base of the glass stem that tends to be extremely fragile. 

 Irrfan recommends only a dedicated glass cloth that is 100 per cent cotton to wipe glasses. This cloth will not leave behind any hanging threads and stuck fibre on the glass, he says.

 Display dos

 Almost all houses have a small cabinet that shows off the glasses in the most mundane manner. Blame it on the shortage of space or simple lack of home decor ideas.

 Though a cabinet is sometimes mandatory, beautifying it is always a welcome way out. Leaving the cabinet without a shutter will draw dust particles and so architect and interior designer Vivek Rathore suggests a sleek glass cover. Illumination inside this cabinet is also a must.

 Cabinet apart, there are many other ways of adding visual appeal to your set of glasses. 

 Vivek suggests playing around with glasses in terms of interesting shapes, sizes and colours instead of stocking them in order like a shopkeeper.

 Dont discard the glasses from an odd-number set. They can become an exclusive piece of art, says Vivek. Let creativity flow in its fullest forms. Metallic fringes, funky graffiti, exquisite acrylic brushing, pretty paintings... You can also put in some fillers into the glasses, rather than keeping them empty. 

 Display candles, preserved grains and cereals, jelly balls, coloured sand, broken glass pieces or even flowers, fill them up any way you like, smiles Vivek.

 You can also nurse your green thumb by planting tender saplings in your favourite glass shape.

 Portrait of a city

 Picturesquely located on the crescent-shaped left-bank of the river Ganga, Varanasi is one of the most ancient cities of India. A city of temples, it has been one of the most sacred places of pilgrimage for Hindus from time immemorial. A mute witness to the progress of civilization over centuries, it presents a living picture of change, at the same time bearing evidence of its close alliance with an illustrious, historical past. Varanasi, the exhibition of photographs by Norwegian photographer Wera Saether, attempts to highlight the conflicts and contradictions of the city, caught between the need to keep up with the present and its reluctance to dissociate itself with its antiquated heritage. Besides portraying popular images of noisy pilgrims, ancient temples, crowded ghats and devout sadhus, the show, interestingly, also captures the pulse of the common inhabitants of the city, as they go about their daily activities.

 Event: An exhibition of photographs by Wera Saether 

When: October 18 - October 25 (except October 21), 3 pm - 8 pm 

Where: Academy of Fine Arts

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Varsity duo wants poll date shift

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 In a desperate attempt to ensure that their students do not lose a precious year, two universities in the state have moved the Election Commission ? one directly and the other through the government ? for a change in the schedule of the five-phase Assembly polls.

 The vice-chancellor of Bengal Science and Engineering University, N.R. Banerjea, said on Thursday that he had written to Chief Election Commissioner B.B. Tandon, informing him that the Joint Entrance Examination had been scheduled for April 22, one of the election days. Around a lakh candidates would be inconvenienced if the test had to be postponed because of the polls.

 Calcutta University (CU), meanwhile, has requested the state higher education department to request the poll panel to change the election dates. The university has also sought the government?s opinion on whether exams could be held during election time.

 Soon after the poll dates were announced on Wednesday, the university deferred all its undergraduate examinations as the higher education department directed it not to hold any exams between April 17 and May 10.

 The new schedule will inconvenience the Part II (BA, B.Sc and B.Com) examinees the most ? the exams were to begin from April 18 ? as quite a few of them are planning to pursue higher studies outside the state or even abroad. If exams don?t start before May 15, the results will not be out in time for them to apply to institutions outside the state.

 ?We are extremely worried with the crisis arising out of the postponement of the Part II exams,? said Mamata Roy, principal, Presidency College. ?Students from almost all our departments seek admission to postgraduate courses of reputed institutions across India and also abroad. I wonder if a single student will be able to make it this year.?

 Pro vice-chancellor Suranjan Das said: ?Before we start revising the exam dates, we have appealed to the higher education department to appeal to the Election Commission for a change in the poll dates.?

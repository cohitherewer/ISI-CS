 Private parties have a blast

 Night clubs no longer have to depend entirely on the Friday footfall and Saturday surge to set their cash registers ringing. The growing trend of private parties is keeping the bars filled to the brim midweek, as well.

 If weekends are still reserved for the quintessential party hopper, weekdays are taken over by the family crowd. Birthday bashes, anniversary parties or small sangeet ceremonies, more and more people are giving their drawing rooms a miss and opting for the dance floor.

 Most night clubs host 15-18 private parties a month. ?The private party trend in a night club has caught on in the city in a big way in the past six to eight months. Parties that were hosted at home are now celebrated in night clubs, with family and friends. We host at least 15 private parties a month,? says Ashim Mewar, director, Red Kitchen and Lounge, in Alipore. 

 So what are the basic requirements for the private party crowd? ?The family or the individual hosting the party wants to have as much fun as the guests. They do not want to be running around for every small thing,? says R.K. Palta, general manager, The Astor. Cloud 9, the Astor discotheque, is booked almost five days a week for private parties.

 The private party crowd does not comprise more than 40 people, including children and teenagers, who can easily be accommodated in a night club. 

 ?Food, drinks and dining space are the prerequisites for a private party in a night club. The DJ music and the dance floor are the add-ons, which are a big attraction for many. Sometimes, people even decide on a venue on the basis of the DJ playing in the club on that particular night,? says Palta. 

 The private party phenomenon is proving most viable for the night clubs also because these are over before the regular party crowd troops in. And the boost to the bar and buffet sales is substantial. 

 ?These parties normally happen between 6 pm and 10 pm when in any case there is no activity in the club. And these being family affairs, night club authorities do not have to worry about the security issues either,? adds Mewar.

 But there?s no floor space for private parties over the weekends, which is when the party people take over the dance floor. 

 ?Hosting a private party on weekends is not a very good business ploy? an open house does generate revenue but it?s also a very good way of brand building. After all, if the regulars like the place, food and service they are going to book us for their family dos,? says Hem Dhillon of B.E.D on Ballygunge Circular Road.

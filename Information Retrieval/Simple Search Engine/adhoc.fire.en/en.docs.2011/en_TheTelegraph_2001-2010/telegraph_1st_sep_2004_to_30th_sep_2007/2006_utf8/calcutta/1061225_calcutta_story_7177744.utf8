 HOT SPOT: Christmas parties this year will not be jacket and wrapped-up affairs. A Telegraph picture

 This Christmas, its going to be hot, hot, hot. As if the bikini tops were not enough, the mercury at the Met office is also going up, up, up. 

 Met officials said December-end usually sees a minimum temperature of around 14 degrees Celsius. But this year, on the night before Christmas Eve, the minimum temperature was 17.2 degrees Celsius. The officials predict that the temperature is expected to dip very slowly over the next few days. 

 Which means trouble for the man who has invested in the Christmas look. We have a family lunch on Christmas where all the men and boys turn up in their suits. But this year, the very idea of attending the lunch in a jacket is making me break into a sweat, said a 26-year-old Ivan Jackson, who has been planning the look and shopping for it for two months. 

 The mercury level has impacted the retail racks, from where the woollies are not moving as steadily as they did in the previous years. 

 The sale of the woollens and warm clothes have been low compared to the past few years. We expect sales to pick up after the mercury starts to dip, said Naveen Mishra of Shoppers Stop. 

 The party people, however, are heaving a sigh of relief. For girls, it is going to be a perfect evening to flaunt their vital statistics, on which they have been working for months. They would not have to wrap themselves in tonnes of leather or wool. 

 It will also give the boys a chance to flaunt a sporty look, instead of smothering themselves in jackets and pullovers. Thank god I wasnt buried under a heavy jacket this Christmas Eve, my corduroy sufficed, said Shreevardhan Poddar, 20.

 I am glad it is a warm December and I am wearing exactly what I wanted to. My strap top and capris will just be fine to see me through the night. For once, I wasnt going around borrowing jackets from my friends, said 23-year-old Manu Aggarwal, giving finishing touches to her look before taking to the dance floor at the Tollygunge Club. 

 The various clubs of the city are expecting a huge turnout for Christmas Eve parties. This is the warmest Christmas I have seen in the my six years as DJ. Some members who would avoid the party due to cold weather will be out in the middle, said DJ Akash, just before taking to the console at RCGC.

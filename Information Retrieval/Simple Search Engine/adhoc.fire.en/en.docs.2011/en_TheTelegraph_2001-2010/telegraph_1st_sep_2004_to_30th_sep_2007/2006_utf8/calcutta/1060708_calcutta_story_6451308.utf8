 The City Diary

 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation will launch a drive from Monday to destroy 

the dengue-causing Aedis aegypti larvae. Educational institutions, offices 

and commercial estates will be brought within the ambit of the drive, mayoral 

council member (health) Subodh De said on Friday. 

 He also announced that the strain of the dengue virus was found in the blood 

sample of a resident of Narendrapur, on the southern fringes of the city. ?The 

person has been cured.?

 The civic health department has opened an information centre, where residents 

can report suspected dengue cases or instances of accumulation of clear water. 

The centre, which can be reached at 22861238, will remain open from noon to 4 

pm on weekdays and noon to 2 pm on Saturdays. 

 Sudhir Jha, 45, who was lying at the Park Street-Russel Street crossing and bleeding profusely, was rushed to hospital by a traffic constable on Friday morning. Police said the constable, B.N. Roy, saw Jha lying on the road after being hit by a car. He ran to the spot, hailed a taxi and took the victim to SSKM Hospital. 

 Justice Soumitra Sen of Calcutta High Court on Friday upheld Indian (airline)?s 

decision to sack Shyama Prasad Singh for making a hoax call. The airline authorities 

had reportedly received a hoax call around midnight on August 16, 1999, from the 

landline number of Singh, a peon. 

 The caller said bombs had been planted on all flights scheduled to leave Calcutta 

the next day. Singh was sacked in February 2002, following a departmental inquiry. 

On an appeal by Singh, the Mumbai-based National Industrial Tribunal had ruled 

that the airline?s decision was ?not proper?. The airline challenged the order 

at the high court. 

 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation on Friday pulled down two illegal billboards on SN Banerjee Road. Municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay said the drive against illegal billboards would continue.

 Five persons were injured late on Thursday when the Matador they were travelling in overturned at the crossing of AJC Bose Road and JL Nehru Road after being hit by a truck. Police said the injured, all vegetable vendors from Rabindra Sarani, were admitted to SSKM Hospital. The driver was arrested and the truck seized.

 Amit and Manish Agarwal, both in their mid-20s, picked up another youth, Ashish Pusp, from Park Street on July 4. They released him after keeping him in custody for a few hours. Following a complaint by Ashish, the duo was picked up by Park Street police late on Thursday. On Friday, when the two were produced in court, Ashish said he had nothing against them. The judge allowed Amit and Manish to walk free.

 Asit Shaw, 38, a daily-wager, was injured when he was knocked down by a truck on Paharpur Road, in the port area, early on Friday. He was admitted to SSKM Hospital, where his condition was stated to be critical. The truck was impounded, but the driver fled.

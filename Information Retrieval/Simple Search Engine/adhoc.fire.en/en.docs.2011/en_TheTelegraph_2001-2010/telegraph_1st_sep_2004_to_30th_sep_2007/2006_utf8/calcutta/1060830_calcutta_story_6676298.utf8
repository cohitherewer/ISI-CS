 Im too old to change now

 Spanish auteur Pedro Almodvar talks on coaxing a grand act from Penelope Cruz and his dislike for Hollywood

 He is only 56 years old, but already the great Spanish film director Pedro Almodovar is brooding about mortality. This has only happened in the last three years, he says with a resigned shrug. But I cant help thinking about death. I think about it all the time. Ive lived more than half of my life. Im agnostic, so I dont have that religious support that can give me comfort. He sighs deeply.

 Its ironic, because the mantle of enfant terrible still clings to Almodovar. He became globally famous in the 80s, presiding over Madrids gay, transgressive night scene and devising a string of subversive, lurid, faintly hysterical films in Day-Glo colours: Dark Habits, Law of Desire, High Heels and most famously Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown. I lived so quick in the last 30 years, he says ruefully.

 Yet now hes troubled about his lifespan and fretting that he will leave no trace. One might think his body of work was legacy enough, but he demurs: I live in the present and look to the future, not the past. I dont like to watch my films.

 Thats unfortunate, because he might derive comfort from them; their progression parallels the mellowing of a remarkable life. The youthful exuberance of his 1980s films gave way to more reflective, complex work: The Flower of My Secret (1995), Live Flesh (1997) and All About My Mother (1999). Since attaining middle age, Almodovar has looked like a mature artist on top of his game.

 And, despite his protestations, his latest film Volver (it means return) finds him looking back beyond his wild younger years to early childhood. Almodovar grew up in the flat, rural backwater of La Mancha, a region of Spain he recalls as backward, almost 19th-century.

 It feels that way from the opening scene, a lovely tracking shot of elderly widows in a cemetery, scrupulously brushing leaves and dirt from graves. As usual in his films, the dominant characters are women: three generations of them. Penelope Cruz stars as Raimunda, a feisty hard-working mother in Madrids suburbs. 

 Her teenage daughter has stabbed Dad to death after he sexually attacked her; Raimunda hides his body in a restaurant freezer. When her timid hairdresser sister Sole (Lola Duenas) returns to their childhood home village in La Mancha for a funeral, she encounters their mothers ghost (Carmen Maura). A sense of place unifies these diverse plot strands: the film is a love letter and a return to La Mancha.

 I was eight years old when my family moved from there, Almodovar recalls. The men were out working in the fields, so I was raised by women like these. They were superstitious. They certainly believed in ghosts. The relationship with the dead continued, but in a different way. So those women inspired the film. Its about a female universe. quot;

 Volver was rightly feted at Cannes in May, and though the Palme dOr for Best Film eluded Almodovar (he received the Best Screenplay prize), his female cast shared the jury prize for outstanding actress. I was moved by that, he says. These actresses trust me completely and will do anything for me. They are more generous to me than to other directors.

 Penelope Cruz returned to a major film role in her native Spain after an artistically unhappy six years in mostly dismal Anglophone movies (Sahara, Vanilla Sky). Cruz, 32, is a revelation as Raimunda. Almodovar rightly compares her to actresses in Italian neo-realist films such as Sophia Loren and Anna Magnani.

 Penelope wanted to work in Spain again, and I wanted to work with her, Almodovar reflects. In Hollywood, actresses dont have many chances after 35. No one there would have given her a role like Raimunda. I know her so well. When it comes down to it, those down-to-earth roles are the ones shes best at.

 Physically she was perfect. The only thing we had to give her was a fake bottom. He laughs a little. Penelope has big tits, which was important for the role, because its about maternity and motherhood. She also needed a good ass, and as shes slim, we needed a prosthetic. You walk differently, the centre of gravity changes. I was looking for that heavy, tired walk.

 Almodovar disagrees with the long-term speculation that he might be tempted by Hollywood. Im an artist. Im part of every decision in a movie. This is not how they work in Hollywood. Also, its about power, but there the director is part of the crew, not the main creator. Im too old to change now. I wouldnt know how to do it.

 Im amazed anything comes out of that system. Everyone there has power: agents, stars. They forget that the most important thing is the script, and the scripts get weaker and weaker. Technical effects advance, but the literary quality is worse. Not your kind of films, then? No! he almost shouts.

 Meanwhile, Almodovar is looking outside film. He revealed that he was in London to discuss a stage adaptation of his film All About My Mother. And American and British producers have approached him about a stage musical of Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown.

 But the stage is a different medium, and as a creator without a specific title, he would not be calling all the shots. Isnt he worried about relinquishing control? Almodovar smiles: Yes. Im not accustomed to that.

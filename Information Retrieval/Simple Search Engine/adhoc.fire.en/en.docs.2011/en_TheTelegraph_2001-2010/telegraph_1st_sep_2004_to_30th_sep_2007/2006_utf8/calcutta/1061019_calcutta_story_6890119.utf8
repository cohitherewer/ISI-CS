 Surprise check for pure gold

 POULOMI BANERJEE

 The Bureau of Indian Standards 

 (BIS) will conduct surprise tests at jewellery showrooms after 

 Diwali to check whether what is sold as 22-carat gold is really 

 that many carat. The bureau has long been stressing the need 

 to hallmark jewellery. 

 Gem and Jewellery Export Promotion Council chairman (east) and industry representative in the bureau Pankaj Parekh was recently in Delhi to attend a meet on the modalities of hallmarking. He cautioned those in the trade about lapses in quality.

 The BIS has decided to make hallmarking mandatory from January 1, 2008. The surprise tests were thought of to prod jewellers into starting the process and to introduce the semblance of a standard for gold jewellery as soon as possible, Parekh said.

 Explaining how jewellers often inadvertently end up selling less than 22-carat gold, he added: To make jewellery, it is necessary to blend some alloy with gold. In addition, some more impurity needs to be introduced in gold to keep the melting temperature of the solder lower than the rest of the ornament. Modern technology allows us to significantly lower the melting temperature of the solder without adding the extra impurity. However, small jewellers in the districts are ignorant of the development.

 It was to give these jewellers time to learn the new techniques that the hallmarking deadline was set on January 1, 2008. Even then, the aim of getting every jeweller to hallmark his jewellery is idealistic, observed Parekh.

 The surprise checks can help. The BIS will employ NGOs for the test. Representatives of the NGOs will pose as buyers and purchase jewellery from various stores. The items will be tested for content. If the gold content is found to be less than 22 carat, a case might be filed against the jeweller. It will be impossible for the jeweller to run a business after that, asserted Parekh.

 Large jewellers are happy with the idea of surprise checks. A. Sirkar has been getting its jewellery tested for years and proprietor Chiradeep Sirkar welcomed the idea of surprise checks. The market will become more organised. The jewellers who make supernormal profits by duping customers will be erased from the industry, so the competition will be fairer.

 Anargha Choudhury, proprietor of Anjali Jewellers, also supported the surprise tests: Since a third party will guarantee the jewellery, the jeweller gains on goodwill.

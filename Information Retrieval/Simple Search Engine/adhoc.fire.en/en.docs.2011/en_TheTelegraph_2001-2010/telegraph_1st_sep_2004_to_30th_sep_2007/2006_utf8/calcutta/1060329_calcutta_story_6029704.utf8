The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

On amp; Off

A great game

Screen On amp; Off

 Highest One-Day cricket score ever made, highest score ever chased, most sixes and fours in a day and four other world records. No wonder the epic battle between South Africa and Australia on March 12 is being hailed as the greatest One-Day ever.

 The good news for the India-cricket starved ESPN STAR Sports is that the match has delivered great television ratings, too. During the crucial run-chase, ESPN managed almost thrice the channel share of its nearest competitor STAR Plus and scaled the ratings for the day?s India-England Test among its core audience.

 Among the male 15-34-years viewer category, across the country the run-chase ratings were 3.8 compared to Doordarshan?s 2.8 for the India-England match.

 The match viewership data among the metros throws up some surprises. Mumbai leads the pack with a rating of 4.5 while Hyderabad is next with 4.4 and Delhi at 3.1. Calcutta ranks fourth with 2.8, followed by Bangalore at 2.2.

 The repeat telecasts on ESPN and STAR Sports, too, found a significant section of cricket fans ? led, of course, by those who missed the working-day match ? tuning in. 

 The eight repeats saw ratings hovering between 0.85 and 0.25 among 15-plus males, compared to Zee TV?s 0.79 or MAX?s 0.63 for the week.

 Non-India featuring cricket, claims ESPN STAR Sports, is fast becoming a draw. 

 ?This signals the coming of age of the Indian audience?s appreciation for sports in general and cricket specifically. Growing competition, old rivalries and emergence of new ones help, too,? feels Sanjay Kailash, vice-president, ad sales amp; business development for ESPN Software India.

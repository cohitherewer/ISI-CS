The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

On top from reel to ramp

Screen On amp; Off

 In demand: Sushama Reddy

 Her debut in Chocolate may not have made that big a splash but Sushama Reddy is making all the right moves in tinsel town. Ready to shed the ?Sameera?s sister? tag, the model-turned-actress has the very best queueing up to sign her.

 First up is Priyadarshan?s Chup Chup Ke, which has Kareena Kapoor and Shahid Kapur in the lead but Sushama claims she is the surprise package. ?I play a very pivotal role in the movie and it is very, very different from what people expect a conventional heroine to do,? she tells Metro from Mumbai.

 Next, Sushama will be seen in Mahesh Manjrekar?s Big Bazaar. ?It is like a hark back to his old ways of making films when he made films like Vaastav,? she says. ?I am an integral part of a huge ensemble cast.?

 After these cameos, Sushama will get to play the quintessential Bollywood heroine in Puneet Issar?s next film, post-Garv. Sushama also walked the ramp on Wednesday after two whole years to open Maheka Mirpuri?s retro Bollywood collection at the Lakme Fashion Week. ?It was a whole lot of fun, getting to meet my old friends,? she says.

 From the heart: Hrithik and Sussanne 

 Roshan with Simi Garewal

 The Roshan family just got bigger with its new member Rayhaan. Yes, that?s what Hrithik and Sussanne are calling their baby boy. The new father is so ecstatic that he has already taken a month off from work ? Dhoom 2 and Akbar Jodha ? to be with his wife and child.

 This Sunday, though, you can catch Hrithik and Sussanne in Rendezvous with Simi Garewal, which was shot a few weeks back. On the show, Hrithik is all praise for his wife: ?She is very expressive with her love for people and I wasn?t. That?s something I learnt from her.?

 For Sussanne, married life has meant knowing Hrithik better. ?He is a very private person as in he likes his space,? she explains. ?When he used to want to be by himself, I didn?t take it personally, because when we were going out he never wanted space.?

 But ultimately, it?s the love that keeps them ticking. ?The only source of brightness is when I see her smile,? Hrithik admits. ?I always wish to God that she?s really happy forever... ?cause I know when she?s happy, I?m ok.?

 Catch the full show, on STAR World, this Sunday at 9.30 pm.

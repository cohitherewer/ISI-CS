 Thats designer Sabyasachi 

 Mukherjees self rating for his brand new collection 

 for the forthcoming Lakme Fashion Week, versus his most-appreciated 

 collection till date that catapulted him to international 

 fashion fame.

 This is a winner and I know it will take me very far internationally, declares Sabyasachi about his most mature and most evolved collection till now.

 No trademark layering, no patent patchwork, no signature silhouettes and no brocade borders? The Snail with its clean simplicity is a complete deviation from the style elements Sabyasachi is identified with.

 Structured, classic silhouettes, controlled volume, dull hues, subtle texturing with stitch detailing, ancient embroidery and discharge printing inject an old-world charm into the post-modern, neo-romantic collection. The inspirations are basic: school uniforms and maternity wear.

 Its a non-gimmicky, serious line, completely in sync with the international forecast of a clean and fresh mood in fashion. Worldwide there is a move to get away from bohemia and bling, and Indian fashion, I feel, is saturated with these. Internationally, aristocracy and simplicity is coming back with a bang, says the designer.

 The shapes are unusual, with a strong Japanese bent. A variety of dresses ? oversized T-shirt ones, hobble of the 1930s, box-pleated, school uniform, coat, cowl, Sixties long, 1940s Wimbledon costumes, church outfits and more. There are hobble skirts teamed with kimono tops, coats, mini-skirts and even some saris paired with unusual blouses. Then there is sexy eveningwear with surprisingly sporty inspirations.

 Cotton dominates the line totally, with muls aplenty, combined with a dash of organza, handmade silk and velvets. Kantha is the most prominent form of threadwork used, with some touches of French embroidery too. A fair amount of quilting can be noticed.

 Theres a leitmotif in the entire collection. The sash, thats attached to almost all the garments, be it dresses, blouses or skirts, smiles Sabyasachi.

 But why call it The Snail? Painstakingly laborious means of stitch detailing, mud and discharge printing, obsolete techniques of embroidery? in an era of mass production, the collection is all about slowing down...

 The accessorisation is unique too. Instead of the staple stilettos, models on the Mumbai ramp will walk in plain black leather floaters and mens shoes. Make-up free faces, with just a dash of mascara and red lip colour promise to make a strong mark.

 So, is the deviation from the signature a reaction to the repetition cry from the audience at India Fashion Week 2005? Not really, clarifies Sabyasachi. Bohemia ruled for the last four years and hence both my Frog Princess and Nair Sisters (India Fashion Week 2005) lines had a bohemian feel, though the collections were totally different. Post-modern is the look now and so I am doing it this time. This look will continue and next year I will again do post-modern and people will again say its a repetition. By now I know it doesnt pay to be bothered by reviews.

 That apart, doing a radically different look every year doesnt make much business sense, feels the designer. 

 On the commercial front, you need to carry on a certain look for two-three years to percolate down to people, he feels.

 The Snail, hes quite certain, will not score big with the Indian buyer just now.

 I am not looking at the Indian market at all. I know they will find this collection too dull and plain. I am targeting big international buyers and might also launch it in Paris, he says.

 Sabyasachi takes the Lakme Fashion Week ramp at 2 pm on March 30.

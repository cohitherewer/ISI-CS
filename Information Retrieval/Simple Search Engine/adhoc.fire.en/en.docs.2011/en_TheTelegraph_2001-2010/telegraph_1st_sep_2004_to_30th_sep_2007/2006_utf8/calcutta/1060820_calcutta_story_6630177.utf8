 Trademark with a twist

The show started off with a line in pure ivory, with crochet, the seasons flavour, being the highlight. A fair amount of tone-on-tone chikankari also embellished the clothes. 

 Skirts, both long and short, teamed with tops in various styles and dresses were accessorised with sling bags bearing the same look. The look here was crushed, light and causal yet elegant.

 The show rolled on with a collection of club wear tops teamed with blue denims. This comprised shirts, empire-lines, fitted blouses and spaghettis with traditional prints in various shades of beige. The look was crinkled and crushed.

 Up next was a line with a trademark 

 gypsy feel. Full-bodied, flowing skirts in vegetable colours 

 flaunted African and Indian tribal prints. The bohemian 

 look was typically Ritu, but also fairly fresh. 

 The skirts, for one, stopped mid-calf, unlike the floor-kissing silhouette the designer had presented the last few seasons. These were teamed with tops, shrugs, tweed jackets and more.

 The finale went all-out sexy, with a line of black cocktail wear of ample shine and shimmer. Metallic embellishments and tonal embroidery defined the look of the skirts, tops and dresses. The silhouette was strikingly slim.

 The fabric-driven collection used cottons, voiles, organza, linens, laces, jerseys, crepes and chiffons. Fabric treatments and textures created the desired distressed and crushed look that tied together all four sequences.

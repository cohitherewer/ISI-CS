 About three days ago, tenants of 2, Camac Street, listed as a heritage structure by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), saw some workmen defacing some heritage features of the building. 

 Early on Sunday, scaffolding was erected all around the building and workmen, armed with crowbars, once again attacked the distinguishing features of the building, such as the arches at the gateway and other ornamentation.

 The tenants fear that the landlord is up to no good ? trying to get delisted the building in which lived Arathoon Stephen, the Armenian millionaire who founded Grand hotel. They have complained to the mayor and the Shakespeare Sarani police station and it remains to be seen what action is taken. Knocking down heritage features is a dirty trick by which landlords get their buildings delisted.

 Earlier, this was done at Alexandra Court, the huge apartment block on Chowringhee Road opposite the Calcutta Port Trust guest house and officers club. 

 Here, too, the first thing the promoter did was to remove all the distinguishing features and embellishments. Now, it lies half-demolished.

 The same was done at 5, Russell Street, the old residence of the bishop of Calcutta. One of the most striking features of this building, next to the ITC glass box, was its arched gateway. It was demolished on the night of August 25, 2001.

G.M. Kapur, convener, INTACH, says these bungalows, including Meghalaya House and 5 and 6, Middleton Row, all part of the Royal Calcutta Turf Club, represent an architectural typology which will vanish now that they have been delisted.

 About three weeks ago, the residence of pioneering film director Pramathesh Barua on the street named after him was demolished. The local executive engineer was suspended by the CMC but he was just a fall guy. Neighbours were just bystanders. Which is why Banani Kakkar of PUBLIC feels markers should be put up in front of heritage structures for local involvement.

 Promoters have struck once again at La Martiniere for Boys. Plans are reportedly afoot to knock down the masters? quarters on the excuse that these buildings have a Moira Street address. The monstrosity called Constantia has already been foisted on the school compound that is a listed heritage precinct. Earlier, the building department of CMC did not have a list of heritage buildings. Now it does, but that makes no difference.

 G.M. Kapur says the CMC has been a ?mute spectator? of these acts of vandalism. What is the use of the ?protected list? when no protection can be provided? 

 The laws operative in Bengal are weighed against landlords, who are barred from taking advantage of their properties. Most landlords are wary of the ?heritage? tag, for it turns their properties into burdens. In lieu of forgoing development of a heritage building, the owner should get transferable development rights in the form of a negotiable instrument in any other location in the city, as was done in Mumbai long ago.

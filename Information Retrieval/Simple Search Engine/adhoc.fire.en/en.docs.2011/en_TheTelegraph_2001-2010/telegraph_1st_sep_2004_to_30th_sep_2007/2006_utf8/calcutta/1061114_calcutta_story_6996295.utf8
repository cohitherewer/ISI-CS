Not getting the right fit for a pair of denims you 

have been long wanting to buy? Think you could slip into a T-shirt somewhere between 

medium and large? Wondering why the garment houses dont ever make anything 

to suit your body shape? The answer to all these may soon be at hand, thanks to 

a research initiative being undertaken by the National Institute of Fashion Technology 

(NIFT).

The research project by NIFT aims to address the long-felt 

need for standardising Indian body shapes and sizes and creating standard measurement 

charts. Another simultaneous initiative for trend forecasting intends to generate 

design intelligence for the Indian fashion industry.

Both plans were unveiled at an Industry Convention 

organised by NIFT Calcutta on Monday.

For the sizing project, the institute plans to undertake 

a scientific and analytical study of the human body to create standard measurement 

charts.

Approximately 25,000 subjects all over the country 

will be assessed for the project, revealed S.K. Bhardwaj, head of academic 

affairs at NIFT. The entire project would be carried out by a five-step 

process involving classification of the total population into groups, determination 

of sample size of subjects to be measured, collection of data using 3-D scanners, 

analysis of data and subsequent creation of size charts, he added.

The grouping of population to create the size charts 

would consider factors like regional, ethnic, gender and age.

The forecasting project would carry out trend-spotting 

exercises followed by brainstorming, trend analysis and fashion forecasts for 

every season. This project aims to create consortia of all stakeholders 

in the fashion value chain for trend-spotting and analysis of fashion in the Indian 

context, said Bhardwaj.

Both the projects will be carried out in collaboration 

with industry houses. In turn, this would enable the houses to produce proper 

ready-to-wear garments and reduce wastage owing to poor measurements and fittings.

NIFT would also provide professional assistance to 

the industry for customised size charts and trends. Talks are already on for industry 

partnerships with companies like Reliance, Pantaloon and Lifestyle. 

NIFT Calcutta director Shantmanu called upon industry 

leaders to join hands with the institute for the projects.

Having recently been accorded the statutory status 

for promotion and development of education and research in fashion technology 

vide NIFT Act 2006, the institute will now award its own degrees instead of diplomas. 

The batch of 2007 will be the first to receive four-year undergraduate degrees 

and two-year postgraduate degrees. NIFT has also signed MoUs with more than 25 

international universities for student exchange programmes scheduled to begin 

from the next academic session.

The NIFT Act has proved that the institute has 

emerged as a centre of excellence, said Banhi Jha, chairperson, fashion 

and apparel, NIFT.

NIFT Calcutta alumni and leading city designers Sabyasachi 

Mukherjee and Shantanu Goenka have been assigned the role of goodwill ambassadors 

of NIFT Calcutta along with S. Jhunjhunwala, MD of Turtle (India) Pvt Ltd, and 

P.K. Bothra, MD of Creative Exports.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Teenager whisked into taxi alleges gang rape

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 A 17-year-old girl was reportedly raped by four men in the port area late on Tuesday. 

 The girl, a resident of Belilious Road, in Howrah, was allegedly picked up near her house around 10 pm and dragged into a speeding taxi, police said.

 She was then taken to an abandoned house at the crossing of Diamond Harbour Road and Remount Road, where she was repeatedly raped. The men dumped her there.

 The girl left the house and started walking down Diamond Harbour Road, when she was spotted by a police patrol.

 She was brought to South Port police station around midnight, where she lodged a complaint of rape, making a mockery of the repeated claims by chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee that Calcutta is the safest metro for women.

 Medical tests were conducted on the girl to ascertain the nature of the assault. The reports are due on Thursday. 

 The girl lives in a slum on Belilious Road, a crowded area near Tikiapara. She lives with her parents and her brother. Her father is a daily wage-earner.

 She said she was taking a stroll outside her house when a taxi screeched to a halt and two men got off from the rear seat and pushed her in.

 It all happened very fast, the girl said in her complaint, and the men gave her no chance to react.

 She was produced in Alipore court on Wednesday morning. After police contacted her family, her father came to the court and took her back home.

 The girl was traumatised, police said. ?Once she is better, we will try to get more information from her,? said Rajeev Mishra, deputy commissioner of police (port division).

 Police said the goons seemed familiar with the port area, as they chose to drive all the way there from Howrah.

 The girl told police she did not know any of the four men, but could identify some of them if they appeared before her.

 The house in the port area where the incident took place is an abandoned Calcutta Port Trust officers? quarters. 

 The cluster of the old quarters ? there are about a dozen houses there ? has become a hub of criminals.

 The empty rooms are often used to store bombs or as liquor dens. Murders have also been committed in these buildings and the adjacent area over the years, people in the neighbourhood said.

 Police termed Tuesday night?s incident ?unusual?, as in most cases where minor or young girls have been raped, the culprits were either known to them or were from the neighbourhood.

 But apparent strangers from a different part of the city picking up a girl and raping her elsewhere is more reminiscent of New Delhi, they observed.

 Second death in drunk cop mishap

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A drunk cop speeding down Canal East Road in Maniktala claimed two lives since Monday evening. 

 While Debu Sen, 42, died on the spot, Minati Chowdhury, 35, succumbed to injuries at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital on Tuesday morning.

 An intoxicated Naruddin Kabir, driving a van of the Government Railway Police (Sealdah), knocked down Minati, husband Kamal, their three-year-old son and Sen around 7.30 on Monday evening.

 Sen was a resident of Biprodas Pulindas Road, in central Calcutta, and the Chowdhurys live in Bagmari. The child escaped unhurt.

 A 1,000-strong mob, comprising mostly local residents, gathered on the spot, dragged out the driver and started assaulting him. 

 A section blocked the road, demanding a traffic outpost to curb reckless driving in the area. Police had to fire three rounds of teargas shells to disperse the protesters.

 Three bottles of liquor were found in the van Kabir was driving. A medical examination on him, too, proved that he was drunk. ?High levels of alcohol were detected in Kabir?s blood and urine samples,? said an officer of the traffic department?s fatality squad.

 According to officials, Kabir was sent for the medical test following complaints from witnesses that he was in a drunken state while driving down Canal East Road, which is flanked by shanties.

 Local residents, however, alleged that Kabir was chasing a speeding lorry in a bid to extort money from the driver. ?Police turn a blind eye to such incidents that are common in the area,? said Bapi Debnath, a resident of the locality.

 Denying the charge, a senior Government Railway Police officer said: ?He was returning home after dropping other employees. We have asked police to send us a report. A departmental inquiry will be initiated after we receive it. If Kabir is found guilty, lawful action will be taken against him.?

 The traffic department is yet to slap any charge on Kabir. ?He is under treatment at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital. He has suffered injuries in the assault. The injuries could have been critical had not cops rescued him.? 

 Another officer of the department said: ?As the medical report has confirmed that he was drunk, he will have to face serious charges, including reckless driving, drunken driving and culpable homicide not amounting to murder.?

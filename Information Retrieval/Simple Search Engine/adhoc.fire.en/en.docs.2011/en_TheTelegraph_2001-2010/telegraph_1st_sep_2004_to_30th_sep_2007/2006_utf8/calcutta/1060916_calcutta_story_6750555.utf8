 After sweating it out for 80 minutes on court, Martina Hingis lies flat on her back on the Netaji Indoor Stadium floor, stretches her hamstrings, almost in halasana. 

 The shutterbugs in celebrity-starved Calcutta go crazy.

 The click crescendo causes the world no. 9 to break her cool-down routine, steal a glance at the photographers, catch mother Melanies eye and then dissolve into petite peals of laughter.

 Welcome to our world, Swiss Miss.

 Friday began early for Martina Hingis, touching down in town for Sunfeast Open 2006. At 7.15 am, she entered ITC Sonar Bangla to a warm desi welcome tika (under the trademark white cap), garland and smiles galore. Then, off she skipped to her suite, adjoining the other smart-suite booked for mom.

 After a morning confined to her suite where all she asked for was some hot water and tea she stepped into the coffee shop Eden Pavilion for lunch. In white tee, shorts and a cap that covered most of her face, lunch lasted 35 minutes. No special requests, just picking and choosing from the buffet spread.

 Martinas menu soup, fish, naan and a little bit of this and that. Martinas marks a smashing smile for an awesome (her word to the chef) meal. She rounded it off with Diet Coke and packaged drinking water her two travelling companions.

 The liquid diet was back by her side at the stadium around 3 pm, to help her cool down after a focussed hitting session with local talent Saurav Panja. 

 The former world number one on a comeback trail only allowed herself an occasional smile when Saurav shouted, Good shot, Martina.

 She looked good, both in form and fashion. Her cool combo for the day was white and orange wristband, tee, shorts, socks, sneakers, and even the elastic band that tied her hair back into a ponytail.

 Plus, understated accessories brown leather strap watch, small silver hoops and signature black cord around her neck, with a pendant.

 Game over, Martina sat and sipped on a 500 ml bottle of Diet Coke leaving just the last sip for mom-cum-mentor Melanie.

 If Day One was anything to go by, Calcutta will be praying for power to the petite.

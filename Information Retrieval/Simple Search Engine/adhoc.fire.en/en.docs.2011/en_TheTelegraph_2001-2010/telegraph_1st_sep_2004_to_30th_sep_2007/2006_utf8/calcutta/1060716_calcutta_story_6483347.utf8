 Head-butt howlers and...

 Tech Talk

 (Top)The World Cup 

 final head-butt and a screenshot of the the Real Butthead 

 game 

 What can the spiciest incident 

 of the World Cup spark besides world-wide media attention 

 for days after the tournament is over? An industry of spoof 

 videos, online games, spin-off tracks and jokes ? of the 

 Zidane-Materazzi head-butt, of course.

 The Cup is over, Zizou has confessed, 

 France has forgiven its favourite son, Materazzi has been 

 heard out by Fifa, but the fun on the Internet has only 

 just begun.

 Kick-off with the Real Butthead 

 game at http://www.wallak.net/zidan. ?Wanna feel 

 like Zizou? That is your chance, come and kick off Materazzi,? 

 beckons the tagline. Poor English but great game. With the 

 click of the mouse, simply head-butt an endless stream of 

 clueless Materazzis within a certain time to earn as many 

 red cards as you can. When the countdown ends, the referee 

 dutifully flashes the red card and the fallen hero walks 

 past the World Cup trophy.

 If developing a game needs programming 

 skills, stitching together a video spoof is an easier affair. 

 A fast computer, video-editing software and a sense of humour 

 are all you need. On YouTube, the most popular online video 

 repository where users upload everything from home movies 

 to music videos to the weirdest clips on TV, one of the 

 hottest items is ?A New Way to Solve Problems?. From Austria, 

 this clip is all about how a series of innocent street encounters 

 culminate in a head-butt. When a tourist asks a bicyclist 

 for directions who fails to give a satisfactory answer, 

 he is rewarded with a head-butt to the chest.

 If Zizou?s sole-drags and step-overs 

 were the draws on the site so long, they have all been replaced 

 by head-butting specials. In one, Materazzi erupts in flames 

 after being hit, while another video trickery finds Zidane 

 head-butting Fidel Castro, using footage of the Cuban leader?s 

 famous trip-and-fall sometime back.

 The head-butt has been immortalised 

 in music too, as a French trio?s cure to post-defeat disappointment 

 has become a national anthem. Coup de Boule (French 

 for head-butt), written by brothers Emmanuel and Sebastien 

 Lipszyc and composer Franck Lascombes, has record labels 

 and ringtone sellers fighting for its rights.

 Finally, there?s that home-grown 

 Chlor-mint joke doing the rounds via SMS. For the uninitiated, 

 the ad finds the most mild-mannered of men exploding when 

 asked, ?Hum Chlor-mint kyun khatey hain?? 

 That, says SMS wisdom, is what Materazzi asked Zidane.

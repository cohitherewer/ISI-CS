Positive paintings on the walls 

Feng Shui Matters 

Pinky Kapoor

 Feng Shui does not recommend hanging pictures 

or paintings portraying the dark side of human nature in the house. The negative 

energy emitted by these can affect the well being of the residents. Paintings 

with inner meaning that emit positive energy make people looking at them happy

Q: I 

am very fond of paintings and keep buying them from exhibitions and art events. 

I would like to know what kind of paintings are recommended in Feng Shui and which 

ones should be avoided. 

Smriti

THE SOLUTION: Many of us hang pictures and 

paintings that express the dark side of human nature. When we look at these images, 

their negativity can interfere with our well being. So be careful about the art 

you pick up from exhibitions and display on your walls.

Always look for the ones that have some inner meaning 

and emit positive energy and make you feel happy and cheerful every time you look 

at them.

Doc dreams

Q: 

I am studying in Class XI with science subjects and it is my dream to be a doctor, 

with specialisation in surgery. I would like to know my kua number, elements, 

my auspicious directions and career prospects. Please suggest measures that will 

help me become a successful surgeon. I lack confidence and concentration, but 

I am quite hardworking. My date of birth is 29.04.1988, at 11.48 am.

Madhulika Sah

THE SOLUTION: Your kua number is 3 and 

east, south, north and south-east are your auspicious directions. According to 

your pillars of destiny, you are a weak wood person and need nourishment from 

the water element. God has blessed you with wood and water elements throughout 

your life journey.

Metal element represents status for you in life. You 

can become a successful surgeon because metal is the main tool of a surgeon.

Give your best to your studies as this is the time 

to plant the seeds of success.

To increase your confidence and concentration, try 

to surround yourself with water and wood elements and their respective colours 

like shades of blue and green. 

Energise the north wall of your study room with a 

confident-looking picture of yours and surround it with pictures of successful 

doctors. This should have a blue background to activate your future career and 

at the same time nourish your weak wood self-element. 

 The rising

Q: I 

have heard that ones signature should give the effect of rising upwards 

to be successful in life. Is this true according to Feng Shui? Also, do we need 

to be careful while writing other personal details like our address and contact 

numbers?

Shruti Agarwal

THE SOLUTION: Rising things are very auspicious 

in Feng Shui as they symbolise the rising of Chi. We always want to rise in life 

and be successful. Hence, it is always better to give numbers and signatures a 

rising effect.

Your signature should be such that it goes up. Many 

people have signatures that are rising but their last stroke is sloping downwards. 

This ruins the rising effect and should be avoided.

Similarly, your house number should also be rising, 

and never slope downwards. Each digit of your house number should be such that 

it rises towards the right.

 Business talk

Q: My 

husbands date of birth is October 15, 1978. He is a businessman and is struggling 

a lot without much results. I want to know when he will be successful in his career. 

Also, please let me know his kua number and auspicious directions. 

Name withheld

THE SOLUTION: He is struggling because there 

is a clash between the rat and his own animal sign horse, in the 10-yearly pillars. 

This clash is troubling him and is not letting him progress.

Fortunately, he is moving into wood period from January 

19 and this means money for him. He will be extremely successful in this period 

and will make lots of money.

Your husband is a strong metal person and his kua 

number is 4. His auspicious directions are north, south, east and south-east.

Since north is his best direction, he should face 

this direction while working in the office and also introduce a water feature 

in the north. 

This will help activate and maximise his business 

luck. He should be balanced in an environment that is suggestive of blue and green 

colours.

 Future facts

Q: My 

date of birth is 06.06.1993. Please let me know my animal sign and lucky colours. 

Also, I want to know my career possibilities. Will it be possible for me to settle 

abroad?

Satarupa Sarkar

THE SOLUTION: According to your pillars of 

destiny, you are a strong earth person with two elements of yang fire. 

You were born in mid-summer when fire is at its peak. In your case two elements 

of fire can be doubled to four, which represents high qualifications for you. 

You have a very bright future and should excel in 

computer science, banking, finance, mass communication, etc.

From 2013, you will enter your metal period, which 

will last for 20 years. This is the time when your intelligence will be at its 

peak, and your creativity and hidden talents will surface.

This is your most favourable period and you will be 

able to decide whether you want to settle abroad or not. You are too young to 

take that decision now. 

Your animal sign is rooster and your lucky colours 

are white, blue, black and green.

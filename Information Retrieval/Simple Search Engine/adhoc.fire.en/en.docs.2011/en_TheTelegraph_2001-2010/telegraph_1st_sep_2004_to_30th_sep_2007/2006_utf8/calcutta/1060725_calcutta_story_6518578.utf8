 Urchin turn for salesmen on move 

 SAMARPAN DUTTA

 Street children in south Calcutta have found a novel way to make money, courtesy travelling salesmen. The conveyance allowance policy of consumer durables companies has paved the way for this intrepid collaboration. 

 The travelling salesmen of the companies ask the urchins to manually spin the rear wheels of their motorcycles while they relax in tea stalls. This hikes up the kilometre reading of the two-wheeler, allowing the salesmen to claim conveyance allowance in excess of the actual expenditure.

 The phenomenon is most commonly seen in Gariahat and near Deshapriya Park. 

 Soumitra Pal (name changed), salesman in a consumer durables company, is one of those who resort to such practices. He is entitled to a travelling allowance proportional to the distance travelled in a month.

 ?As I have to go around to market my company?s product, I am reimbursed the expenses on fuel. At the beginning of every month, I submit the kilometre reading on my motorcycle. We are paid conveyance allowance according to the reading,? says Pal. 

 ?We, however, feel victimised by the way we are treated. We are asked to meet deadlines that are next to impossible and the company sets targets that can never be achieved,? adds Pal.

 Shankhasubhro Basu, another travelling salesman, echoed Das. ?We have found a way out to beat the company at its own game. When the heat takes its toll, we take a break and have a cup of tea, but make sure that the rear wheel continues to turn,? smiles Basu. 

 By rotating the rear wheels of two-wheelers for an hour, the street children earn between Re 1 and Rs 3. They are also paid in proportion to the number of kilometres they have notched up.

 For most of the urchins, rotating the wheels with their sticks is a game. ?I don?t know why the salesmen pay us for playing with their motorcycles,? says Raghu, a street child. ?However, it is fun. We keep competing with each other. The one who rotates the wheel the maximum number of times in a minute earns an extra Re 1.?

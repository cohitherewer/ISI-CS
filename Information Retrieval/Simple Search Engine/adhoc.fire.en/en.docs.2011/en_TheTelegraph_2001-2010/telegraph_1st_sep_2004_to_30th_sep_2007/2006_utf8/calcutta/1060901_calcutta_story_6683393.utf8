 Cousin killer in custody

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Mohammad Noureen, 23, who kidnapped and murdered his nine-year-old cousin before dumping the body in the Hooghly, was arrested on Thursday after a daylong detention. He has been charged with abduction and murder and remanded in police custody till September 13.

 The body of Zunaid, son of Rabindra Sarani-based trader Gulam Rabbani, has not yet been fished out.

 Sleuths are not clear about the motive behind the murder. Noureen told us he had abducted Zunaid to extract a ransom from his father. But Gulams family did not receive any ransom call. It seems the killing was a fallout of business rivalry or a family dispute, said an officer.

 Zunaid was at home on Monday afternoon when Noureen called him out and took him to his apartment in an adjacent building. 

 He was crying. It could have attracted my neighbours attention. So, I strangled him within a few minutes and kept his body in a jute bag. On Wednesday morning, along with my neighbour and friend Faiyaz, I took the body to a launch and dropped it mid-river, he told police.

 Faiyaz has not been arrested for lack of strong evidence against him. Though Noureen told us that Faiyaz had helped him commit the crime, our probe and statements provided by local residents have not provided any lead against him, said Gyanwant Singh, deputy commissioner (detective department).

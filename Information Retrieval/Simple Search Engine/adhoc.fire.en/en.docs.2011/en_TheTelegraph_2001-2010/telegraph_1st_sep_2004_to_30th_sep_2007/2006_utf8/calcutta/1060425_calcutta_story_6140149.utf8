The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Key to dream groom: grooming

 SAMARPAN DUTTA

 The 

 venue: A south Calcutta marriage bureau

 The candidate: 

 Lopamudra, daughter of a bank clerk who completed her master?s 

 in English literature from Burdwan University a year ago 

 The reason: ?I 

 am looking for someone as macho and rich as Bollywood star 

 Aftab Shivdasani. An NRI ? nothing less!? she declares

 The answer: A 

 grooming course for prospective brides to ready them for 

 nuptial challenges.

 With social status and financial standing the most-sought-after qualities in the marriage market, more and more girls from modest backgrounds are turning up at grooming centres to land an NRI husband.

 ?The majority of the girls who come to us are on the lookout for an NRI groom or at least someone who has visited the US, the UK or Germany at least a couple of times. The number of such prospective brides from the middle class and the lower middle class has increased,? said Anindya Sanyal, proprietor of Relations, a marriage bureau.

 He added: ?We have had a positive response from NRIs. They feel middle-class girls turn out to be the perfect bahus.? 

 Jaytas is the package on offer to make the NRI dreams come true. ?We have been able to successfully prepare both boys and girls for the challenges of married life. The parents are ready to spend a fortune to find the perfect son-in-law or daughter-in- law,? claimed Sanyal. 

 Dream Merchants Fashion Grooming School is another institution cashing in on the trend. It helps girls upgrade themselves to fit into the role of corporate wife.

 Proprietor Sanchita Kushari Bose explained: ?We have a personal grooming programme that caters to the demands of the girls who lack interpersonal skills. Most young ladies are looking for men working in multinational companies or NRIs. Our aim is to help them realise their dream.? 

 Both packages focus on helping women adjust to a world very different from the one they know. The would-be brides are trained in language proficiency ? English and French ? so that they can communicate with people around them. They are instructed on using modern cookware, table manners, housekeeping, interior decoration and how to dress for corporate parties.

 For men, it is mostly counselling. 

 ?I have had several cases where either the husband or the wife complains of the other not being able to adjust with him/her. If the expectations are too high and there is no will to cooperate, marriages are bound to fail. One should learn to be committed to the institution called marriage,? stated psychologist Pranab Basu.

 Sanyal echoed Basu?s view. He also stressed on the need for parents to understand the modern world to make good matches.

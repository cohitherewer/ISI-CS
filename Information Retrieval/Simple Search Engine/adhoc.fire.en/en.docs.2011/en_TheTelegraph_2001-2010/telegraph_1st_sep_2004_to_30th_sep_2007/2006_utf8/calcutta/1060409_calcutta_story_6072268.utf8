 Did you know that Alipore zoo 

 attracts the maximum number of visitors (over 20 lakh a 

 year)? It has a history of 130 years and it was from this 

 zoo that the first ever handbook on management of wild animals 

 in captivity was written by Ram Brahma Sanyal! Facts that 

 would make any Calcuttan?s face light up with pride. Not 

 quite, given the current state of the zoo.

 According to Bipul Chakrabarty, 

 scientific officer Central Zoo Authority (CZA), zoos are 

 improving, developing and expanding across the world but 

 Alipore zoo lacks professional management and has not shown 

 the eagerness to progress. There are more than 1,000 animals 

 displayed in the small area and the conditions are deplorable, 

 he adds.

 PETA volunteers, who visited the 

 zoo in February, think the zoo does not serve its purpose 

 of conservation and education and the animals are displayed 

 to draw crowds with no thought for the animals. Keeping 

 in mind the regulations laid down by CZA, here are PETA?s 

 observations and suggestions (in italics) on the Alipore 

 zoo.

 Tetrapacks, polypacks and food wrappers were strewn all 

 over. Children were being fed on the zoo premises by their 

 parents who threw the food packets all around. This attracted 

 stray dogs and other scavengers. Garbage bins were overflowing, 

 food was being sold by authorised and unauthorised vendors, 

 the bed of the deer moat had ice cream cups and plastic 

 bottles, and had probably not been cleaned in months.

 The zoo premises must be ?plastic-free?. There should be 

 strict checking at the entrance of the zoo and guards must 

 make it a point to keep a vigil to prohibit plastic in any 

 form within the area.

 The elephants were starving and could be seen looking for 

 food in the mahout?s room. The mahout, instead of feeding 

 them, was seen beating them to shoo them away. There was 

 no drinking water seen inside their enclosure.

 Adequate food and water must be provided to every single 

 animal. 

 Visitors to the enclosures of the tiger and lion were seen 

 banging on the mesh of the enclosure and hooting to get 

 their attention. Children were seen stoning bats that are 

 nocturnal animals and should be allowed to sleep in the 

 day.

 Teasing of animals must be checked. 

 Heavy traffic on the road that runs beside the deer enclosure 

 was causing sound pollution. 

 Animals will be happier if the surroundings are quiet. 

 Sounds that animals make can also be heard if silence is 

 maintained.

 The rhino enclosure had piles of garbage in it and there 

 was an open-air restaurant in front of the hippo enclosure 

 where stray animals could be seen loitering. The water in 

 the deer enclosure was filthy and full of flies, and they 

 could be seen swarming on the deer.

 The water in the enclosures/moats must be cleaned regularly 

 to prevent water from stagnating.

 The enclosures of the tiger and lion were barren with no 

 vegetation at all. The floors were cemented which can be 

 very dangerous as they tend to develop cracks and get heated 

 to very high temperatures during the day.

 All enclosures must be enriched to resemble the natural 

 enclosure of the animals as much as possible and prevent 

 the animals from going mad in this enforced captivity.

 Sajid Khan with the baby during a test shoot

 Even though his Jaan-e-Mann hasnt yet hit the marquee, producer Sajid Nadiadwala is on a spending spree for his next film, the Sajid Khan directorial debut Hey Baby. Starring Akshay Kumar, Fardeen Khan, Riteish, Boman Irani and Vidya Balan, the film is a romantic drama revolving around a baby. The music of Hey Baby will be composed by Shankar Ehsaan Loy.

 For the launch of the movie, the makers went for a test shoot, which is almost a norm in Hollywood. This is usually done for the the director and actors to hit a comfort zone together. For Hey Baby, getting the baby right was the most important job on hand.

 In terms of special effects too, the film is breaking new grounds. Says Sajid Khan: We are using a new technology called Motion Capture. It has nothing to do with the more popular device Motion Control. Motion Capture is generally done on a 3D animated CGI but for the first time ever in the history of world cinema, we are doing this on an actual person the baby.

 Nick Nickolai from Sydney, who has earlier worked in movies like The Matrix, Babe and Power Rangers, will be roped in. Of the Rs 40 crore budget, nearly Rs 5 crore will be spent on this Motion Capture device.

 Thanks to the technology, even if the baby cries when he has to laugh during a shoot, he will be showed smiling through the special effects, which is simultaneously done during the shooting process.

 Sajid has already conducted two test shoots for the film and will be conducting one more in New Zealand, the outdoor location for the film. The budget of a test shoot can go upto Rs 8 lakh. But that obviously is not a problem with the producer.

 I had told Nadiadwala that I want to shoot in an Udaipur fort with 200-300 junior artistes, Sajid reveals. Instead, he has given me a Rs 3 crore set, 1,000 junior artistes, 50 elephants, four helicopters, a big stage and a colosseum.

 The real shooting for Hey Baby will get underway soon and the film will release some time next year.

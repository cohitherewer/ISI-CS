 What: 

 Dzone Sananda Smart Interiors. 

 Where: Dzone at 229, 

 AJC Bose Road, near the Minto Park crossing.

 When: April 23.

 Take a look: Around 60 participants lapped up decor tips shared by panelists including model-turned-painter Piu Sarkar, interior designer Anindita Saha and fashion designer Sunipa Samadder. 

 Piu highlighted the importance of picking the right paintings for the home. She explained the need to connect with a piece of art spiritually and aesthetically. 

 Do not get yourself a painting just because it suits the wall colour or carpets. Instead, go for pieces that you can relate to and grow up with, said Piu. 

 Sunipa shared her views on the old-world charm of inherited antique pieces. The designer stressed on blending conventional and contemporary styles in the interiors. 

 Anindita focussed on layouts that give dimensions and character to the rooms. She spoke on how furniture with European styles and moulds are suitable pack-ins when comfort is the priority.

 The interior designer also emphasised the use of wood in home decor. Wood has an appeal that cannot be duplicated by any other medium, felt Anindita. She also touched on aspects of blending the antique look with modern feel. 

 Voiceover: Workshops like these are very useful as they help homemakers learn and assimilate newer ideas. Such sessions also help to keep them updated on decor trends, smiled Anindita.

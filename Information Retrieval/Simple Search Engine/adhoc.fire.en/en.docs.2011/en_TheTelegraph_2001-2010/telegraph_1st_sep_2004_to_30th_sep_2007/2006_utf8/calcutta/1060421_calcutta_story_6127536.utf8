The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Four bags full of films

 The black-and-white Dosar is just a week old 

at the theatres, but Rituparno Ghosh is already busy plotting a string of projects.

 First in the pipeline is Rahgeer, starring Akshay Kumar and Vidya Balan, to be produced by Pritish Nandy Communications.

 Then, with Planman Motion Pictures, which produced Dosar, Rituparno will be doing three more films. Leading the trip will be a bilingual venture. If Dosar dealt with a tragic slice of life, Sunglass will turn the spotlight on the lighter side, and will be made separately in Hindi and Bengali. The Hindi version of Sunglass, ?a comic take on today?s life?, stars Konkona Sen Sharma and Arshad Warsi. 

 ?I have wanted to do a comedy for a long time and since Konkona is a very good actress I thought of making it with her. I had met Arshad at the Locarno Film Festival where he and his wife Maria had gone with Raghu Romeo... The story is very contemporary and has an element of fantasy,? said Rituparno from Mumbai.

 The same story will be shot in Bengali, with Konkona and a young Tollywood actor, who is yet to be finalised.

 The Hindi version of Sunglass is meant for a national release, clarifies Arindam Chaudhuri who heads the Delhi-based Planman Life.

 ?Our Bengali films are not reaching out to the national market and so I don?t want to make Bengali films only. I feel Faltu should also have been a bilingual. We just need to spend a few more lakhs as the cost of the sets remains the same and we can reach a wider market. The Hindi version of Sunglass will not be released in Bengal... We thought Arshad would have a bigger appeal nationally,? said Chaudhuri.

The other bigger and more ambitious project is London 

Summer. The Hindi film will bring Naseeruddin Shah and Shabana Azmi together 

after a long time, and will be shot in London. The contemporary story will have 

Shabana playing sister-in-law to Naseer. ?It?s on relationships and there is also 

a younger couple,? said Rituparno. 

Time to chill

 The sub-zero heroes from the worldwide blockbuster 

Ice Age are back. Manny the mammoth, Sid the sloth, Diego the sabre-toothed 

tiger, and the squirrel/rat Scrat (in picture right with an army of piranhas) 

welcome you to Ice Age ? The Meltdown.

 In the sequel (releasing on Friday at city plexes) from the Oscar-winning creators of Ice Age and Robots, the Ice Age is coming to an end and the animals are enjoying the melting paradise.

 Ray Romano, John Leguizamo and Denis Leary return to voice the three heroes ? Manny, Sid and Diego. New cast members include Queen Latifah (Chicago), Seann William Scott (American Pie) and talk show king Jay Leno.

 Manny, Sid and Diego learn that a huge glacial dam holding off oceans of water is about to break, threatening the entire valley. 

 So the three, along with the female mammoth Ellie and her two possum brothers, form the most unlikely family, as they embark on a mission across an increasingly dangerous landscape towards their salvation.

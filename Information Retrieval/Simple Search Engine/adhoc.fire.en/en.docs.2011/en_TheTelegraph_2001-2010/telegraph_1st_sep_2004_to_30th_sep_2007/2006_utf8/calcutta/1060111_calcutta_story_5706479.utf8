 Sucharita Roy, a Class III student of an English-medium school in south Calcutta, had to stay home on Tuesday as a group of agitating Citu activists locked the gates of the housing estate where she lives.

 Hundreds of residents of Manjulika Cooperative Housing Society in Tiljala ? one of the biggest housing estates off EM Bypass, with 544 apartments ? on Tuesday incurred the wrath of the CPM?s labour arm activists, who did not allow them to go out. The only fault of the residents was that the security staff of the housing estate had been replaced with new ones. The guards beat up a number of the newly-appointed securitymen. They also heckled a team of policemen who arrived on the scene.

 Around 9 am, a group of 50-odd men stormed into the housing estate and closed all the gates. ?I was about to leave for my office when I heard a commotion. I went out and found that a group of people had shut the gates,? said one of the harried residents. 

 ?They would allow nobody to enter or leave,? he added. ?They ordered us to go back to our apartments and threatened us with dire consequences if we tried to force our way out.?

 According to witnesses, the Citu supporters warned the newly-appointed security staff against opening the gates.

 When they tried to open one of the gates to let in a vehicle, the Citu activists beat them up mercilessly.

 Trouble started way back in September last year. In the last annual general meeting of the housing society, it was decided that the existing security agency would be replaced by a new one.

 ?We were not satisfied with their services and there were a number of thefts,? said Santosh Dutta, secretary of the housing society. 

 But after the agency was informed about termination of contract, the security staff working for it refused to vacate the housing estate. 

 ?They demanded that they be reinstated, even if a new agency was given the contract,? said Dutta. 

 In spite of their protest, the housing society decided to replace the old staff. Annoyed with the decision, the staff, most of them local residents, went to the Citu leaders of the area and asked them to intervene.

 The new set of security staff took charge on December 25 and since then, talks have been held between local Citu leaders and members of the housing society. 

 On Tuesday, the trouble snowballed into a major crisis, as the Citu leaders decided to use muscle power. 

 Three police stations sent their officers to the housing estate to bring the situation under control. 

 ?Tension still prevails in the area, but we have managed to persuade the former security staff to leave the premises,? said S.N. Gupta, superintendent of police, South 24-Parganas. Till late in the evening, the Citu supporters continued to shout slogans from a makeshift stage erected outside the gates of the housing estate. 

 District CPM leaders denounced the incident. ?This kind of muscle-flexing is unfortunate. We do not support such agitations,? said Shantimoy Bhattacharya, CPM?s district secretary.

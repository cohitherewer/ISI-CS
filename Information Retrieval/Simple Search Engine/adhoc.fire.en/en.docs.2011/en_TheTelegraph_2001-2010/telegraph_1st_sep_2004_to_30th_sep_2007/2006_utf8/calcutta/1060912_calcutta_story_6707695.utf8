The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Crores to cut through traffic chaos

 - Terminuses, off-street parking and re-engineering of routes on the agenda

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Criticism from all quarters regarding chaos on the city roads has prompted the state government to draw up a Rs 191.7-crore plan to ease traffic congestion on important thoroughfares and intersections.

 The urban development department has prepared the scheme in consultation with the transport department. The Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) will be the nodal agency for its execution. The transport department, traffic police and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation will be the CMDAs partners in the project.

 The blueprint envisages construction of 12 bus terminuses, shifting of existing bus terminuses, creation of off-street parking facilities, re-engineering of traffic movement and diversion of routes.

 We are focussing on 16 intersections in the city and Howrah. Our plan is to ease the chaos at these intersections to increase vehicular speed. Roads and pavements will be improved, guard rails erected and automatic signalling systems and road dividers installed under the scheme. We will also set up electronic lighting and realign bus and minibus routes, stated P.R. Baviskar, chief executive officer of the CMDA.

 According to the plan, bus terminuses will come up at Science City, Dum Dum, East Calcutta Township, Rajarhat, Howrah, Shalimar, Mahestala, Bakultala, Bally and Kalyani, and under Vidyasagar Setu. The project cost is Rs 31.5 crore.

 Off-street parking facilities will be built on the northern side of BBD Bag, the western sides of Strand Road and Curzon Park at a cost of Rs 31 crore.

 Steps will also be taken to improve traffic dispersal at the Metro Railway and Circular Railway stations. 

 The state government will provide the major portion of the funds, with the Centre providing the rest under the Urban Renewal Scheme.

 In August, the traffic and transport departments had conducted a survey on the movement of vehicles and identified 15 over-saturated roads where vehicular speed is about five to six km per hour.

 Park Street, Shakespeare Sarani, BB Ganguly Street and Rashbehari Avenue are some of the roads identified as over-saturated. These roads are designed for comfortable movement of about 1,100 vehicles per lane per hour. But several times the number uses each lane of the roads every hour. 

 The CMDA has also earmarked 20 intersections in the city as most chaotic, with movement of vehicles far beyond their capacity.

 We have found that the major reasons behind the traffic chaos in the city are rapid rise in number of vehicles, roadside bus terminuses, poor condition of roads, encroachments on roads, illegal car parking and excessive number of buses and minibuses plying on a single route, said a senior CMDA official.

 He stated that parked cars and bus terminuses occupy a large chunk of the roads. At least 5,000 private buses and minibuses and 50 state buses have no terminuses and are parked on roads, impeding vehicular movement.

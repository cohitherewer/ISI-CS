 Crores to improve conservancy

 Sandip Banerjee: The CEIP is supposed to improve the city?s environment. From our experience we know that schemes such as these come and go and funds are spent, but the residents of the city have to live with garbage vats spilling over and stench emanating from them. What projects have you taken up to improve the conservancy service under the CEIP?

 We have earmarked Rs 70 crore for the purpose. Utilising this allotment, a new 60-acre dumping ground, about three times the size of Dhapa, will be created. It would cost Rs 35 crore. We are yet to decide whether the landfill site will be created as a joint venture project with private parties or not. Mechanical sweepers, trucks, hand trolleys and other equipment will be procured with the rest of the allotment.

 A proposal is now in its final stage to generate power and produce manure from the garbage. Firms from the UK, Canada, China and Indonesia have shown interest in the project.

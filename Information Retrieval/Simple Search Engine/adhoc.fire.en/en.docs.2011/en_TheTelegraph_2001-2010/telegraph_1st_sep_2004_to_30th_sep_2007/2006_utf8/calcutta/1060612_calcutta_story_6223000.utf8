 Mediterranean makeover

 Ah Mediterranean? The very name conjures up a picture of bliss. Cool blue skies, cooler blue seas, flirty breeze and lots of greens. If only half of that found its way into homes, stepping out of such inviting interiors would be a tough ask.

 But its not such a tough task to pick up essential Mediterranean traits and blend them into homes. Or better still, go entirely Mediterranean the next time you overhaul your house interiors. 

 Interior designer Ajay Arya says that a Mediterranean theme is the only one that can be adopted for the complete home. All other themes can somewhere look like an overdose or seem out of place, but the clutter-free, Mediterranean theme looks great all over, explains Ajay.

 The Mediterranean concept of living in apartments or bungalows, adds interior designer Karan Jain, mirrors nature. The beauty and simplicity of this style involves extensive use of natural materials, feels Karan.

 Bedroom, bathroom, or your private space, GoodLife tells you how to give your home a Mediterranean makeover.

 Design detail

 A serene atmosphere, broken mosaic, hard wood, Terrazo or net cemented flooring, and textured walls. A Mediterranean home boasts unique detailing. Ajay lists some essential design elements that make a Mediterranean set-up: 

 Light wood furniture. 

 The furniture need not be straight-lined. It could be avant-garde. For example, logs of wood can be put together to make an unusual piece. 

 The upholstery is simple and light ? soft linens, silks or cotton.

 Wooden blinds look good.

 White sets up the mood of the house, and an aqua palette comprising greens and blues makes suitable accents.

 Wall effects 

 A Mediterranean home, most often, boasts various wall effects. 

 The colour palette revolves around white, blues and greens, sometimes offset with a splash of butter yellow.

 Jaya Chatrath of Perfect Finish, dealing in wall and furniture finishes, says: The effect is rough and textured, achieved through rough plaster and paint. The edges are kept uneven or rounded, both the wall corners and pillars. 

 The look has to be played up against distressed wood or cast iron.

 For instance, you can work on a wall next to a wooden window, door or balcony. The contrast looks good, adds Jaya. 

 Payal, her partner at Perfect Finish, suggests a polished cement floor, slate or bricks.

 Rough wooden beams on the ceiling enhance this look, she explains. 

 Light lustre 

 A Mediterranean home is synonymous with lots of light. Ideal are French windows and wooden panel doors that allow sunshine to stream in.

 This also gives you a chance to view nature ? be it a waterbody or lush greenery ? and enjoy the sunrise or dusk, says Karan. Here is his list of pointers for the right light effect:

 Use yellow lights and mild coloured lamps. 

 Indirect lighting is preferred.

 Lights placed on wall brackets create the right mood. 

 Add-on appeal

 A wide selection of greens and fresh flowers lends a breezy feel to a Mediterranean home. Choose anything from bougainvillaea, mimosa, roses, jasmine or a composition of many to recreate the atmosphere.

 The other artefacts and pieces of interest in the house are also essentially natural. Cane pieces merge with other interesting elements like coconut shells or banana leaves for centrepieces or simply to liven up tabletops.

 Ajay says candles can add distinct character. They can be square blocks of wax, preferably in white or aqua tones, he adds. 

 No elaborate glass items or intricate sculptures here; simplicity is what sets a Mediterranean home apart from every other theme.

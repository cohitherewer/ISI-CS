The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Strait is the gateway

 - Howrah bridge woes: potholes, eroded pillars, vendors amp; vehicles

 KINSUK BASU

 Brick bits shoot out like bullets from potholes as cars fail to steer clear. Craters eat up most of the road surface in a pattern that makes the bridge resemble a beach. The river below is visible through gaps at the corners. The approach roads are a mess Rabindra Setu, the gateway to Calcutta, could not be less inviting.

 Metro takes a horror ride 

 on Howrah bridge

 Crater calamity

 Potholes and craters galore greet 

 you between pillars no. 1 and 2, as you start moving from 

 the Howrah station end. Deep and round, they are here, there 

 and everywhere; between pillars no. 4 and 5, 15 and 16, 

 21 and 22 From the Calcutta end, where vehicles hit the 

 bridge, some craters are so deep that the steel base of 

 the bridge is visible.

 Mind the gap

 The iron casings at the base of 

 the pillars are either worn out or have fallen off. At some 

 points, the river is visible through the cracks. Other pillar 

 peril points: ragged iron sheets, wire-ends sticking out 

 at the approach from the Mullickghat Pumping Station end.

 Hello hawkers

 Rabindra Setu is the gateway 

 to Calcutta/Please take care to preserve it the giant 

 signs at both ends of the bridge are all but blocked out 

 by a brigade that hawks everything from apples to potatoes, 

 flowers to rubber sandals, litters the road and further 

 narrows the carriageway.

 Whos to blame?

 Calcutta Port Trust (CPT) is in charge of Howrah bridge. Beautification is priority number one, so lights are being put up. Basic repairs will follow soon, one learns. Officially, mums the word. P. Bala, senior executive engineer, refuses comment.

 We have been trying to draw the attention of the CPT to the condition of the road surface for so long, but, complains an officer of the Howrah Bridge Traffic Guard.

 Buses on 80-plus routes ply on the bridge. And now that the toll plaza on Vivekananda Setu has tightened the net, many more vehicles are taking Howrah bridge. The load on the bridge is tremendous and its condition terrible, says an officer of the traffic police.

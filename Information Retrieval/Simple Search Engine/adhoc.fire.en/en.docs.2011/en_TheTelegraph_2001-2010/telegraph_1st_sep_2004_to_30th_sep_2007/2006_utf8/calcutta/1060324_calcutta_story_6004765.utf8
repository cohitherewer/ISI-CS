 Pale palette, soft silhouette

 Models Jenny and Bidita sport outfits from the spring-summer collection of Ekru 

 What: 

 Launch of spring-summer collection.

 Where: Ekru at 1/4, Rowland Road.

 Take a look: The new in-house line by designers Ekta Jaipuria and Ruchira Kandhari boasts a soft, feminine, romantic look. 

 There are kurtas that can be teamed with churidars, patialas or salwars and tunics that can be paired with churidars. 

 Then there are skirts in different lengths and fits like slim-fit, asymmetrical long and flowing gypsy silhouettes.

 The colour palette consists of soft and elegant hues like white, off-white, pale blue, avocado green, sage, candy pink, lime, peach, jasper, magenta and mauve.

 Chiffons, georgettes, crisp linen, poplins, muls, nets and laces make up the fabric story here.

 Pocket pinch: The collection starts at Rs 1,000 for a single piece and goes up to Rs 8,000 for co-ordinated sets.

 Voiceover: The collection is aimed at women of all ages. It combines striking prints, textures and traditional embroideries. We have used a lot of layering and panelling in the Indo-western outfits, says Ruchira.

 Turning back time: A moment from Seven Islands 

and a Metro

Ismat Chugtai and Sadat Hasan Manto discussing modern 

day Mumbai on a stroll in the middle of the night? Its not a dream sequence from 

an arthouse flick, but the premise of Madhusree Duttas new documentary Seven 

Islands and a Metro.

I choose to call my work non-fiction feature just 

like Truman Capote called his books non-fiction novels, Dutta tells Metro. 

The veteran documentary film-maker, who has won many international awards, apart 

from two National Awards, is in Calcutta for the premiere of her latest film, 

to release at Nandan on Friday.

Seven Islands and a Metro is basically about 

the city of Mumbai, says Dutta. It is a metaphorical title trying to show what 

a vicious circle we are in. Every year, Mumbai reclaims more land from the sea 

and slowly, more and more people are becoming like islands.

The documentary is shown through a fictional walk-and-talk 

between the famous writers Chugtai and Manto. They were close friends and were 

very close to the city of Mumbai, Dutta reveals. When Manto left for Lahore 

in 1950, Chugtai didnt approve of his move and felt he was betraying the nation 

and the city. Manto lived till 1954 and in those four years wrote extensively 

about Mumbai. Chugtai lived till 1992 but all those years she didnt write anything 

about Mumbai. That intrigued me and I wanted to explore who is an insider and 

who is an outsider. I myself is a migrant having moved to Mumbai from Calcutta 

and felt I had the edge to make this film on the city.

Seven Islands and a Metro is one of the first 

Indian documentaries to be commercially released. When I had a screening in Mumbai, 

one man from the 650-strong audience stood up and said: Hi, I am Shyam Shroff 

from Shringar Cinemas, can I distribute your film? recalls Dutta. It was truly 

a historical moment as it marked the return of documentaries after a year-long 

jinx. If Michael Moore can be seen, why not us?

After Munnabhai makes an exit from the plexes 

and before the Dons and Jaan-e-Manns storm in, the Fames and INOXes 

in Mumbai will get a taste of the Seven Islands and a Metro. Then Dutta 

is ready to take her film to Berlin for the International Film Festival early 

next year.

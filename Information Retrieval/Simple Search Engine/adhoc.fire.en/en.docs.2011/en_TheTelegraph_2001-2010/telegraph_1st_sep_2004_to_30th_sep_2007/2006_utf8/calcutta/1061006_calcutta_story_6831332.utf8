 Strokes and sketches

 Nurtured by multi-cultural experiences during her vital growing-up years, the art of Saswati Sengupta has developed and imbibed a ubiquitous yet distinctive style that transcends boundaries of local customs and traditions. The ongoing maiden solo show of her works, featuring watercolours and digital graphics, bears clear evidence of this important aspect of her creativity. What is remarkable about her paintings is that she expresses no concern for current trends. Her work takes into its expanse thematic and stylistic elements from the past and present with equal ease. Depicting partially-abstract figures and objects, her creations articulate ideas and opinions that are of universal relevance. Alternating bold and fine outlined strokes filled with colours smudged at the edge, give her paintings a fluid, flexible quality. Simple, pictorial scribbles and scrawls on her canvases are a common characteristic of her works, rendering an almost childlike innocence to her creations, at the same time bearing testimony to her talent in composing poetry.

 Event: Paintings and graphics by Saswati Sengupta

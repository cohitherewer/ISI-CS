 Global hospital majors look set to put Calcutta on the healthcare highway, and aiding them in their investment efforts is the industry, which has laid out plans to provide single-window assistance.

 The biggest name eyeing a base in the city is Bumrungrad, one of Asia?s largest healthcare groups. According to sources, officials of the group met those of AMRI Hospitals to discuss the setting up of a multi-speciality unit.

 ?We are interested in investing in Calcutta and have held discussions with a hospital group,? an official of Bumrungrad International (BI), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bumrungrad Hospital Public Co. Ltd, told Metro from Bangkok. He refused to divulge any details.

 Hospitals of the group treat more than nine million patients a year. One-third of the patients is from abroad. 

 Sources said the BI authorities recently held talks with the Emami and Shrachi groups, the stakeholders of AMRI Hospitals, regarding setting up of a multi-speciality clinic at New Town, Rajarhat. 

 ?We have initially applied for a five-acre plot. It will be a Rs 120-crore project,? revealed Brigadier S.B. Purkayastha, president of AMRI Hospitals. He added that the new hospital was being planned along the lines of Bumrungrad?s facility in Bangkok. 

 ?There will be a shopping mall, food court and multiplex within the hospital,? elaborated Purkayastha. The hospital is likely to have cardiology, orthopaedics, neurology, nephrology, urology, trauma care and other speciality units.

 ?Bumrungrad has the expertise in managing foreign patients and health tourism. We will be utilising their experience,? Purkayastha stated. 

 Besides the Bangkok-based group, Indian healthcare majors are also planning to increase their city presence. 

 ?A number of groups from other parts of the country are either applying for land or are planning tie-ups with existing hospitals. Officials of several groups have already visited Calcutta for preliminary assessment,? said Amit Ghosh, chairman of the health sub-committee of Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry (BCCI).

 BCCI is planning a platform to help entrepreneurs in the smooth implementation of healthcare projects. From assistance in the process of land procurement to settling smaller issues, BCCI will provide single-window solutions for entrepreneurs, claimed Ghosh.

 In a bid to attract investment to Calcutta in the health sector, BCCI has also drawn up a plan to honour healthcare entrepreneurs. P.C. Reddy, chairman of the Apollo group, will be the first entrepreneur to be felicitated.

 Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals, which has set-up a 325-bed clinic off EM Bypass, will invest nearly Rs 100 crore in satellite hospitals elsewhere in the state. ?We have applied for 30 acres to start two or three hospitals. We are waiting for the government sanction,? said V. Satyanarayana Reddy, chief executive officer of Apollo Gleneagles, Calcutta.

 Two other international healthcare players have voiced interest in setting up hospitals in Calcutta. ?Parkway Holdings of Singapore (promoters of Mount Elizabeth and Raffles hospitals) and Singhealth Group of Singapore are waiting for more infrastructure development before unveiling their plans,? disclosed Sajal Dutta, president of Association of Hospitals of Eastern India.

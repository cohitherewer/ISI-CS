 A figurative vision

 Lacking the intellectual coldness of conceptual art as well as the emotional clamour of Neo-expressionism, the art of Ashok Bhowmik is characterised by a thoughtful imagery that derives its strength from the artists own visionary world. In Symbolic Expression, Multiple Charade, the ongoing exhibition of his recent works, one finds him less concerned with style. Instead, he emphasizes on creating a visual surface full of inaccessible meanings often shrouded by explicit hints, but remaining undefined till the end. In all the paintings of the series, he remains faithful to colours like black and a mysterious shade of white. Hints of colour, deliberately used with camouflaged intensity, endow his canvases with a breathtakingly simple appearance and a classic elegant look with deeply philosophical meanings, when reviewed over time.

 Event: Recent paintings by Ashok Bhowmik 

When: Till October 21, 3 pm - 7 pm 

Where: Galerie 88, 28B Shakespeare Sarani

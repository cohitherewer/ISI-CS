 What: Launch of Community, the third and final edition of the limited edition Wonders Of The Sea trilogy from Swarovski.

 Where: The Swarovski outlet at Forum.

 When: December 15. 

 Take a look: Harmony, the first edition, depicted Clownfish in their natural habitat. Eternity, the second series, was all about a turtle.

 The third edition, Community, carries forward the marine charm. The Community measuring around eight inches has been designed by Heinz Tabertshofer. It illustrates a set of three Banner fish in coral reefs of the tropical ocean. While the fish in shining crystals are floating right, corals in frosted and clean-cut crystals on the left make for a stunning background.

 Community could be crystal clear or touched up with colours here and there. The tail and fins in black and yellow look pretty. 

 This edition will be available to collectors through 2007. Purchasers of the complete Wonders Of The Sea trilogy will walk away with complimentary Swarovski goodies. 

 Pocket Pinch: Community is tagged at Rs 22,495. 

 Voiceover: Nature has always been an inspiration for us. The Community is exotic. All the maritime creatures depicted in the trilogy are endangered. This is our way of raising awareness about this problem, said V. Shiv Kumar, country manager, consumer goods business, Swarovski India Pvt Ltd. We will add to our collection of flowers and butterflies in the coming year, he added.

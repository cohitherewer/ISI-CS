 Based on a story from Jhalapala, a collection of Sukumar Roys plays, Chalochitta Chanchari is a satirical comedy that awakens and sharpens our conscience by making us aware of our hypocrisies and egotisms. Samya Siddhanta Sabha and Srikhandadever Ashram are two religious institutions at loggerheads with each other. While the former considers esoteric yogic practices as a means of salvation, the latter professes a modern, scientific outlook. The heads of these two orders, as well as their followers, bear a relationship of bitter animosity. When Bhabadulal, the favourite disciple of a popular holy man, enters the scene, both parties are equally eager to win his confidence. Bhabadulal announces that he is going to write a book on all the valuable information he has gathered from the two groups. But later, it is found that he has described the paths to deliverance as explained by both groups in a derisive, ludicruous light. Enraged, the heads snatch away the book and tear it up. Direction: Shyamal Dutta.

 Event: Play in Bengali, Chalochitta Chanchari, produced by Gobardanga Rupantar 

When: Today at 6 pm 

Where: Bharatiyam Cultural Multiplex, IB-201 Salt Lake

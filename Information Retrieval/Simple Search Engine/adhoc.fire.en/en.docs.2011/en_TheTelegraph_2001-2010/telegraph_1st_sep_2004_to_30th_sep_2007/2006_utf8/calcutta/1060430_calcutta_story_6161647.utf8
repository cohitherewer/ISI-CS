The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Brand hero, 

 brand zero

 The rise of Dhoni as product pusher 

 is understandable, but the fall of Ganguly from grace is not

 Shiloo Chattopadhyay

 On 

 Election Day, a small news item appeared in the morning 

 papers. But for a photograph that accompanied the story, 

 many would have missed it. A smiling Big B was snapped standing 

 next to Mahendra Singh Dhoni. The news said that AB was 

 very keen to meet Dhoni as he had become a fan of his. Dhoni 

 is the new sensation. His new-found celebrity status has 

 given him many contracts. These days, he is appearing in 

 public functions, shooting for ad films and receiving the 

 honour to be the ambassador for some of the best brands 

 in the country. This is only the beginning. As he hits more 

 sixes and wins more matches for India, demand for his endorsements 

 will increase.

 One cannot but be reminded of 

 another man who not so long back had all this and some. 

 He also had the best brands begging him to sign on the dotted 

 line. There were sports management companies vying with 

 each other to earn the right to represent him. Yes, I am 

 talking about the Prince of Calcutta, Sourav Ganguly. Today, 

 the chips are down and so all but one advertising contract 

 has been terminated. His lone companion is, incidentally, 

 a brand of chips.

 There, of course, is a very simple 

 explanation for these two contrasting stories ? that of 

 sunset and sunrise. Everyone prefers to worship the sun 

 in the sky, not the one that had set yesterday. I am not 

 too sure about the scriptures but that at least is the prevailing 

 notion in the world of advertising. It does not appear to 

 be an unreasonable notion either. Unless of course one pauses 

 to examine the basic issue: why are celebrities used in 

 ads in the first place? 

 There are three simple reasons. 

 The most popular of them is that a celebrity mug shot on 

 your ad makes it more noticeable. In these days of infinite 

 ad clutter, this is a million-dollar prize. Many stars are 

 paid a million dollars for it. The second one is more optimism 

 than reasoning. One hopes that the love and affection that 

 the public have for the star will rub off on to the brand. 

 Most Amitabh Bachchan ads are created with this hope in 

 mind. Then there are some, unfortunately only some, who 

 seek the benefit of a higher order. They borrow one of the 

 attributes of the public persona. So Akshay Kumar?s macho 

 image is exploited by Thums Up or the ethereal beauty of 

 Ash by a leading brand of diamond. A new entrant like Dhoni 

 will thus be most amenable for use with any brand that wishes 

 to promise power: Eveready or Exide, Tata Steel or TVS bikes.

 That brings us back to Sourav. 

 Is he still an attractive property for endorsing brands? 

 The haste with which the advertisers have dropped him would 

 tend to make the question superfluous. Yet the doubt remains; 

 opinion polls in the media and posters at the cricket grounds 

 would tend to suggest that a strong affinity still exists. 

 There is an even stronger argument. Sourav in this last 

 phase of his cricketing career has epitomised courage, fighting 

 spirit and a never-say-die attitude. He has demonstrated 

 a rare ability to stand alone and fight. Spare a thought 

 for the lone warrior who walked in to face Shoaib Akhtar 

 knowing that a failure would mean an end to his cricketing 

 career. That the fate did not alter even after a decent 

 performance on the pitch is a different story altogether. 

 Cricket by then had become a game of not so glorious certainties. 

 Some years back an ad had said, 

 ?When the going gets tough ? tough get going ?. Can you 

 think of a better model for this ad than Sourav?

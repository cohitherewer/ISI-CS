 Go for glass

 Social Register

 What: Exhibition of Leonardo glassware.

 Where: 85 Lansdowne.

 When: Till October 18.

 Take a look: The German glassware brand is displaying 

 close to 300 pieces vase, platter, cheese tray, frames 

 and more.

 ass takes various forms, flaunting 

 a vibrant colour palette that extends from naturals like 

 olive and amber to more striking shades of aqua and wine. 

 Lots of abstract forms and linear proportionate lines find 

 a place in the collection.

 The focus is on selling 

 a story instead of isolated pieces and so complementing 

 accents like artificial flowers, pebbles, candles and more 

 are also available.

 Leonardo is imported by Maple 

 Lifestyle, its sole selling agent in India, and it will 

 be available at 85 Lansdowne after the exhibition too. 

 Pocket pinch: Prices vary between Rs 300 and Rs 5,000. 

 Voiceover: Artefacts these days fall into two 

 categories either very modern or very classic. These pieces 

 suit many more sensibilities, said interior designer 

 Ajay Arya, on behalf of Leonardo.

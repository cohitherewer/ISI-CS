 Retiring workers to cut civic flab

 - Recruitment only in select wings

 Exit: 5,000-odd. Enter: 50-odd. 

 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) is shedding its flab, finally. Come 2007, the count of civic workers will be down by 5,000. 

 The 13 per cent-plus reduction in workforce is not linked to any manpower rationalisation exercise. Ageing of employees leading to retirement will cut down the number of CMC workers from 37,000 to 32,000. 

 We have decided to keep recruitment limited to specialised cadres. The number of new entrants will not be more than 50, said mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya.

 Most of the recruits will be inducted in the e-governance wing of the CMC, which is in the process of creating positions for information technology engineers. The CMC top brass has also decided to abolish several clerical and other support function posts over the next few years. 

 The authorities at the civic headquarters are happy with the sudden spurt in retirement because it will bring down the annual wage bill by approximately Rs 48 crore, from the existing Rs 360 crore. 

 While retirement benefits to employees around Rs 6 lakh to each will lead to an outgo of around Rs 300 crore from the coffers, the CMC is not worried. 

 The outgo will be one-time, but the savings on the salary front will benefit the balance sheet every year, explained a senior official in the accounts section. 

 Flab in the CMC workforce dates back before Independence. According to a civic body veteran, recruitment in most cases was not need based and people with political connections were given employment without conducting any workload assessment. Many believe that the situation worsened in the mid-1970s, when the civic body came to be known as an employment factory. 

 As the wage bills shot through the roof, the CMC tried workforce rationalisation in the mid-90s by offering early retirement schemes to employees. The exercise, however, did not yield the desired result. 

 Retirement due to ageing has achieved the target. Over the past six years, about 7,000 employees have retired. According to the civic personnel department, the total number of employees will come down due to retirement to around 25,000 by 2010. In 1996, the staff strength was almost double.

 What had happened earlier was a crime against the society and the city. The civic body was crippled financially and became dependent on the state government for footing the annual salary bill. The basic objective of taking up Calcuttas development was compromised. We want to change this, stated mayor Bhattacharyya.

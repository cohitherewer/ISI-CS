 Solid black and a rustic charm making for an impact imposingly impressive?wrought iron has over the years moved on from being just an easy-to-maintain medium for archaic gates and grills. Moulding into mainstream home decor, wrought iron lifestyle accessories are much sought after today. 

 Bed, sofa set, table lamp or showpieces?they are a great combination of looks and space-utility. The metal has been given a colour makeover, too. Wrought iron figurines and artefacts at Irony outlets are quite in contrast to its characteristic black that this metal is synonymous with. The showpieces look striking in bold and bright hues.

 The decor pieces are a part of the Irony Lifestyle collection that the store came up with about two and a half months back. 

 Says Indranil Dey, managing director, I. Irony Pvt Ltd: Wrought iron is a medium that you can create wonders with. Earlier we produced showpieces on a small scale. But with the Irony Lifestyle collection, we have ventured into this segment in a big way. The products gel well with different furniture forms and are economical, too.

 The themes Radha-Krishna, Ganesha, Rajasthan and Punjab are prominent. Elaborates Indranil: The subjects are all colourful enough to spruce up your room ambience. Radha-Krishna and Ganesha are eternal favourites. Traditions and costumes of rural Rajasthan and Punjab are gorgeous in their own way. 

 The products are hand-painted. A special lacquering gives them an eye-catching polish. The colour lasts for more than six years. We also provide refinishing services, adds Indranil. From six inches to three feet, choose from a wide range that suits your home the best. Indranil suggests a backdrop in white, beige, off-white, tangerine or pale blue. 

 The smaller items include a dansuese posing gracefully. Adorned in a bright red drape, kamarbandh, anklets and bangles, she chooses to dance over a tabla. Music plays an integral role. 

 A set of four Punjabi musicians with long curled moustaches and golden mojris play musical instruments. Their dress code is yellow and blue. Ten Vaishnavites are singing, their harmoniums, dhol, kartals in place. A Rajasthani villager is selling toys, looking pretty in an orange lehnga. She carries a host of musical instruments in a basket on her head. 

 Some serve utility purposes. Tribal figurines playing drums make for nice ashtrays. The Krishna Hook has Lord Krishna playing the flute on which are attached the hooks.

 Among the bigger decor pieces are colourful Radha Krishna illustrations swaying on a swing. Olive green banana leaves have been given a Ganesha makeover. Those with an eye for abstract pieces can go for the striking Six Hand Musician that depicts a consolidated portrayal of palms playing the sitar, dhol and tabla.

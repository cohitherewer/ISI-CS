 Abandoned newborn finds home

 - Police allow couple to keep baby girl

 A STAFF REPORTER

 An infant was recovered near the Bata Bridge in Mahestala, on the southern fringes of the city, on Friday morning. 

 While passing by the deserted area, some local residents heard a baby wailing and found the abandoned newborn girl. 

 The incident occurred two days after a 10-day-old boy was found buried in a house in Jodhpur Park. 

 Shocked to see an abandoned infant, the residents alerted the police about the incident. They suspected that somebody must have left the baby on the spot at night.

 Soon after the baby was found, a childless couple, Sanjit and Gita Poddar, expressed their desire to adopt the child. With the help of local residents, the couple took the child to Mahestala Maternity Hospital for a check-up. 

 ?The baby is perfectly fine and healthy. However, the doctor has given her few medicines to keep her fit,? beamed Anil Basu, one of those who found the baby on Friday morning. 

 After the check-up, the Mahestala police took the child and the Poddars to the police station. 

 Inspector-in-charge Chandra Kanta Das Mahapatra, after listening to the details, made all the necessary arrangements so that the Poddars could adopt the baby, if nobody claimed it. 

 ?We have told the couple that they will be allowed to keep the child if no one claims it. After checking their financial status, I think that they can bring up the baby without any problems. They can keep the child, but I have suggested that they legalise their adoption at the earliest,? said S.N. Gupta, district superintendent of police, South 24-Parganas. 

 The local police had already started a hunt in different nursing homes to find out where the infant was born. 

 ?I have instructed the officials at Mahestala and other police stations to check up the records of the nursing homes and to inquire about all the newborns and their family members,? superintendent Gupta said.

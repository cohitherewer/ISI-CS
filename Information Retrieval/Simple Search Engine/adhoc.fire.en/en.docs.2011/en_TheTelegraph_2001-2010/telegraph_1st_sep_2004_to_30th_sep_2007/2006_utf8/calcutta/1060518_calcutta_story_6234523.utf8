The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Hospital pact with research titan

 SUBHRO SAHA 

 Cracking the genetic predisposition code in cardiac conditions, nurturing neurosciences through fresh frontiers, taking transplants to the masses, doing intelligence work for the American healthcare industry? 

 India?s leading private-sector healthcare provider, the Apollo Hospitals Group, is bringing a clutch of global best practices and the ?world?s best in medical research? to Calcutta. The prime plume in the cap is a tie-up with Johns Hopkins of the US, voted the ?best research hospital in the world? for the 18th consecutive year. 

 ?Our association with Johns Hopkins is a reality now and we are the Indian arm of this global centre of research excellence. The alliance gives us access to their latest research work, which they are extremely keen to bring to our doorstep, to tap the volumes in our healthcare scenario,? Prathap C. Reddy, chairman, Apollo Hospitals Group, told Metro on Tuesday. 

 The association with the premier US institution comes into effect on July 1 and Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals Calcutta will be a beneficiary, Reddy promised. Apart from research results, Johns Hopkins has pledged one-to-one faculty exchange and sharing of all new programmes. 

 ?One of the first programmes we will share is Hopkins?s latest research on genetic predisposition in heart diseases, which is absolutely critical in our context, since Indians, who have smaller arteries, have been proven to be genetically more prone to coronary artery disease,? the chairman stressed. 

 Next in line is neurosciences and neurosurgery, both thrust areas at the Calcutta hospital. 

 The group?s relationship with Gleneagles is also set to break new ground, with the Singapore medicare major on the verge of getting FDI approval to bring its research on heart-muscle transplant to town. ?It?ll be a huge boon to myocardial infarction (heart attack) patients whose heart muscles become damaged,? the chairman explained. 

 Another tie-up with US cell therapy major StemCyte has also been finalised. 

 It will help in extraction and storage of cord blood for stem cells, which can later be used for transplants, with a defined focus on treating paralysis caused by spine injuries. 

 Cord blood stem cells are now known to treat over 70 diseases. 

 Together with John Hopkins, Apollo Gleneagles is setting up an institute for minimally-invasive and cosmetic procedures, with 20 rooms in its new building.

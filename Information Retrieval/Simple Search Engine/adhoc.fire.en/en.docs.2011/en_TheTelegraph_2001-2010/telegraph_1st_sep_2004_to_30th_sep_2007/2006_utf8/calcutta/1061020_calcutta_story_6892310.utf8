 S for smooth, S for sexy, S for supreme 

 The new Mercedes-Benz S-Class, touted to be all of the above, has just rolled into town. And by early next year, it will be steered into garages of first movers smitten by the S350L.

 Privileged Merc customers of Calcutta caught a first glimpse of the new model on Wednesday evening at a closed-door meet in the Alipore showroom of Interkrafts. Even before the sneak peek, the sole Mercedes dealer in town had completed two sales for the new model and had four more bookings in hand. The price tag of Rs 75 lakh-plus is enough to ensure queries galore but bookings few in the Calcutta market.

 Customer response to the newly launched and refurbished S-Class has been tremendous, said Hiteshwar Singh, CEO of Interkrafts, adding that all-India bookings were closed till January 2007. An aggressive muscular sedan that combines the look of a roadster is how the updated S350L is being described. Launched six months back in Stuttgart, the luxury on wheels from the Daimler Chrysler stable reflects a new design paradigm.

 The car on display at Interkrafts was Carneol Red, a rich dark chocolate colour, but it is available in three other shades. Inside, it is all wood and chrome trim elements with ventilated reclining front and rear luxury seats.

 Other tech tools apart, the USP of this S-Class lies in its airmatic suspension, 7-speed transmission, new control and display system, an eight-inch TFT (thin-film transistor) colour display on the dashboard allowing quick access to radio, DVD/CD, telephone, plus next servicing date and more.

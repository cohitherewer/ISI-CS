The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 City Lights

 Yesterday once more

 A glimpse of the majestic 

 Calcutta captured by Jayant Patel

 For three decades, one mans Rolleiflex captured a Calcutta that is long, long lost. Now, a little bit of that history and grandeur has been reclaimed at Majestic Calcutta, an exhibition of black-and-white photographs taken between 1940 and 1971, part of Jayant Patels private collection.

 On the roofs of double-decker buses, on the terrace of whatever building he could climb, inches away from history in motion, Jayant has captured everyday Calcutta of old, recording its palatial splendour with the same mastery as he captured formative moments of a nation at the cusp of independence and beyond.

 A combination of skill, opportunity (being official photographer for Government House and the American and British militaries in Calcutta) and passion allowed the owner of one of Calcuttas lost institutions (Bombay Photo Stores) to record such a vast array of the citys moods and moments. While a few of the early images were taken by his father and older brother, most of the frames on show for the first time were taken by Jayantbhai himself.

 Having shut down the landmark studio on Park Street in February 2004, wife Lila told Metro how she tried to keep post-retirement Jayant busy by encouraging him to catalogue his photographs. The 79-year-old had been diagnosed with Parkinsons disease, which affected his legs, and the couple could no longer keep the store going. But they could not bring themselves to sell it to someone, for fear that quality may slide, ruining their well-earned goodwill. So they shut it down, though many pretenders around town still claim affiliation to Bombay Photo Stores.

 It is quite by chance that the collection is finally being shown publicly (at Victoria Memorial till December 31). When Governor Gopal Krishna Gandhi chanced upon some photographs at Raj Bhavan, his gaze went to the name of the studio in the corner. He was told that the store had shut down. When he subsequently met the Patels at a dinner party, he asked them if he could see their collection of photographs. Contrasts became embarrassing. Reality suddenly sprang out of black and white pictures, said Governor Gandhi at the inauguration on Friday evening.

 If history came alive before the lens, the eye behind it was also revealed. Jayants sense of history is as clear as his penchant for pretty things buildings, cars, monuments and his passion for the good life, or the bon vivant as Kishore Bhimani called it in his introduction.

 So, Mahatma Gandhi rubs shoulders effortlessly with the all-white members of the Aero Modelling Club basking in the Maidan sun. Howrah station stands beautiful and unthinkably serene with just two buses and a handful of pedestrians in front of it, alongside a glimpse of Old Court House Street with its streetcars and wide pavements.

 Many layers of graffiti and grime, neglect and suffering will have to be stripped away before the Calcutta of today can be recognised as the Calcutta of these pictures. Viewing these snapshots is sure to be a bittersweet experience, not only for those who lived and breathed that Majestic Calcutta, but also for those who inherited what remains in its wake.

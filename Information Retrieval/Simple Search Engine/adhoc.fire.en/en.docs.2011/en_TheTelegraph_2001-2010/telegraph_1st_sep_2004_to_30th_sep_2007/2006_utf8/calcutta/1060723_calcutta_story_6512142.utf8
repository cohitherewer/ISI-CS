 He dishes out albums as fast as Himesh Reshammiya churns out videos. But Bickram (blame the name game on Cheiro) Ghoshs latest release is special on several counts. Drumscape is the percussionists first concert DVD, showcasing a Swabhumi performance a year-and-a-half back.

 While Bickram plays the tabla and the handsonic, V. Suresh is on the ghatam, B. Rajashekar on the morching (used extensively by Ray in Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne) and R. Rajkumar on thavil.

 Live music is not about lip-syncing or pre-composed loops, it is about musicians educated in music for more than 20 years coming together and jamming, said Bickram at the launch of the DVD on Saturday afternoon at Landmark. 

 Also, at a time when we are bombarded with vulgar music videos, we musicians do have the power to blow away the audiences, he added.

 Supporting his music and attending the launch was mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya. Bickram is like my younger brother and at a time when all our young musicians have lost out to the West, he is taking the music of our roots to a global platform, he said. It is a good idea to have a concert DVD of his because when Bickram plays, his body language is worth watching.

 To give a taste of whats in store, Bickram and Suresh ? who had come from Chennai for the launch ? presented a power-packed jugalbandi. The sawaal-jawaab session on tambourine and ghatam was an instant hit.

 Drumscape punctuates Bickrams audio albums and there are quite a few in the pipeline. Coming up is Interface, an album with Rahul Sharma, he revealed. Then theres an album called Jam, a collaborative effort with a number of artistes. The new Rhythmscape album has been delayed because the video featuring Soha Ali Khan, Kailash Kher and me couldnt happen for technical problems. Right now I am off to the UK for a month to do some workshops and record an album called Bohemia with Spanish pianist Pedro Ricardo, French artiste Jamelle and Grateful Dead drummer Greg Eliss.

 Z for Zizou

 at the World Cup final. Reuters 

 I had planned to begin this column 

 on a serious and scholarly note. Perhaps by invoking Plato?s 

 allegory of the cave, or Baudrillard?s elegant conceit of 

 the simulacrum or the copy that becomes more real than reality 

 itself. Or maybe a manifesto about the longer and longer 

 hours we spend away from our bodies, locked inside the endless 

 bubble of cyberspace.

 Instead, I find myself thinking 

 about the head-butt of one Zinedine Zidane.

 On the day after the World Cup 

 final, I returned home from work and switched on the computer. 

 Within a couple of minutes I was online and was Googling 

 for Zidane + head-butt. Within 0.39 seconds, 1-10 of 10,700 

 results shimmered on the screen before me.

 Like many thousands all over the 

 world, I too was seeking consolation and understanding, 

 some explanation which would ease the hurt of Zizou?s raging 

 exit. As I scrawled up and down the page, his name winked 

 at me in blue, like the colour of the jersey he wore for 

 over a decade. Endless rows of words and headings marched 

 by, trailing their cyber-signatures in enigmatic green.

 Perhaps what I sought was not 

 understanding but a sense of community, of being part of 

 an assembly of mourners all connected to one another by 

 a common set of rituals. All over the world, this ceremony 

 is performed by billions with dial-up and cable, broadband 

 and wireless.

 I am online, therefore I am.

 The ritual performed, we are free 

 to work or play. Sometimes we seek out companions; sometimes 

 we multiply ourselves to create replicas. There are no rules 

 in this game ? no stern official will red-card you out of 

 this electronic playground for a foul. You can play an endless 

 game of yourself, slipping in and out of one self into another. 

 And when you are done with work or play, you can log off 

 and return to whatever passes as the real world for you.

 At least, that?s what you think.

 So, regardless of whether Zinedine 

 Zidane steps on a football pitch again, there will be millions 

 of dreams in which he will keep running with the ball. A 

 click of a mouse will freeze his image, or make him perform 

 one of his outrageous turns. We can visit him anytime we 

 wish, either inside our heads or on a computer screen.

 So many places to visit, so little 

 time. Let us go then.

 we leave a book on a train

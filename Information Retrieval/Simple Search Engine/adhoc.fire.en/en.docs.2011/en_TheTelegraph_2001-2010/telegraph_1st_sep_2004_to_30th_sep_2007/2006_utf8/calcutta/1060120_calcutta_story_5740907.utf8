 It's Your Birthday So...

 You are emotional, yet mature enough to hide your feelings when need be. You know the art of keeping your co-workers inspired. You are quick to perceive what others are thinking or feeling. You are not only a quick learner, but also a good retainer. You have the gift of realising and correcting your shortcomings. You have it in you to be successful in what you choose to do. ? Kusum Bhandari

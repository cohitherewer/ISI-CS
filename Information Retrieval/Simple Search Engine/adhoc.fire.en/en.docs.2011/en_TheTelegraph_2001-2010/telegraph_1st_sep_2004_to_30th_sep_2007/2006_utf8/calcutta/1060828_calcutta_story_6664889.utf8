 Hideout raid nets snatcher gang

 A STAFF REPORTER

 They are in their 20s and earned a living by snatching valuables from women while whizzing past them on motorcycles. And the young men managed to elude police every time they were given chase.

 The gang ran out of luck on Saturday, when the officers of Bhowanipore police station arrested them at a hideout in south Calcutta. 

 Three gold chains were seized from their possession.

 We were trying to track down the gang members for the past couple of months. There are a number of cases registered against them with almost all the police stations in the south division. We are finding out from our counterparts in South 24-Parganas whether the youths committed crimes there, too, said deputy commissioner of police (south division) Ajay Kumar on Sunday.

 According to police, the six youths were operating in south Calcutta for the past six months.

 Elaborating on the arrest, an officer of Bhowanipore police station said: After all our efforts to track down the youths proved futile, we activated our source network. We had to wait a couple of weeks to receive specific information about their whereabouts.

 Following the tip-off on Saturday morning, a team led by sub-inspector S.S. Roy conducted the raid. The youths were held in a house under construction.

 During interrogation, the gang-members told police that they used to cruise on their two-wheelers looking for women walking down deserted streets. They would close in on the women and the pillion rider would snatch the gold chain. They generally sped away before the victim could raise an alarm, elaborated Kumar.

 Investigation has revealed that the gang had carried out snatchings at Ballygunge, Tollygunge, Bhowanipore, Rabindra Sarobar, Kalighat and Shakespeare Sarani over the past couple of months.

 The miscreants have so far snatched 20 gold chains. Now our job is to recover the rest of the jewellery, said the deputy commissioner (south).

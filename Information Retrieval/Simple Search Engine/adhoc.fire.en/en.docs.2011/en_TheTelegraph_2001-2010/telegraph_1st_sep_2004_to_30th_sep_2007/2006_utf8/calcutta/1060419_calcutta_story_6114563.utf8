 Beam denial fans exodus

 - STAR damage control team due, customers demand return of bouquet

 SUBHAJIT BANERJEE

 Caught in a beam battle and missing out on your favourite movies, soaps and shows? There?s little that almost three-fourth of the 20-lakh cable television homes in greater Calcutta, denied the STAR bouquet of channels, can do besides complain to their local cablewallah.

 But the customer crib ? from viewers under multi-system operators (MSO) Manthan and SitiCable ? seems to be piling pressure on cablemen to rush to other MSOs and independent control rooms offering the STAR beam.

 Payment disputes involving STAR, Manthan and SitiCable have seen channels like STAR Plus, STAR Movies, National Geographic, STAR Gold and Channel V come and go on the two networks for the past few weeks. SitiCable yanking the beam off on Saturday night rendered almost 75 per cent of the city STAR-less.

 ?There?s a fair amount of interest and inquiries from cable operators. Almost 20 hours in a day, we are meeting operators who want to join us,? said Dileep Singh Mehta of MSO CableComm, which is carrying the STAR beam. ?There will be more churning in the next 15 days if the stalemate continues,? Mehta added.

 Apurba Banerjee of upcoming MSO Silverline Services agreed: ?We have connected around 30 operators from Garia and central Calcutta. Regular switch-off was one of the main reasons for us to launch our own operations.?

 Some operators feel that such blackouts are only pushing cable viewers to alternatives like direct-to-home. ?If viewers are paying operators regularly and operators are paying MSOs, why should the channels be off air?? asked Mrinal Chatterjee, an operator in north Calcutta.

 With no solution in sight till April 27 ? when the dispute is next heard by a tribunal ? STAR officials are rushing to the city on Wednesday to assess the situation and control the damage. ?We cannot do much, since the matter is in court but we would like to urge operators to get their STAR feed from MSOs which have the channels,? said Yash Khanna, senior vice-president, corporate communications, STAR India.

 On the thunder trail

 Talk about pushing a metaphor to the limits where the vehicle fuses in reality with the tenor. If Coca-Cola India has so far been asking viewers to ?taste the thunder?, this time it is actually reaching out for the real thing from the skies.

 In a campaign throwing a Hai Dum? challenge to the thirsty, Thums Up had started off by plumbing the depths of daring, bringing bungee-jumping to Indian homes years ago. This time, it is raising the bar to as high as the top of a lighthouse, and is striving to touch the sky.

 The ad, starring Akshay Kumar and boasting technical wizardry of the highest order, hit the small screen this Sunday. It has been shot over three locations in Cape Town, South Africa. 

 ?There was no way that we could get the three things we wanted at one place ? a desert with white sand, a sea surface and a lighthouse. So, we shot all three, spread at about half an hour?s distance from each other. Then the three elements were fused together in post-production,? says Ram Madhvani of Equinox Films, which has produced the ad.

 The climax is a breathtaking achievement in visual drama. Frustrated at finding his bottle empty, a parched Akshay at last reaches the top of the Cape Town lighthouse and raises the bottle to the cloud-covered heavens demanding a refill. ?Helicopter shots were taken of the top of the tower. It was at least seven to eight storeys high,? recalls Sainath Saraban, creative director of advertising agency Leo Burnet, who has conceptualised and scripted the ad. Then the clouds part to send a bolt from the dark blue. And Akshay?s bottle is filled with fizz, ready for him to taste the thunder. 

 ?Akshay is sporting long hair for this ad. The larger-than-life twist in the tale needed a mystic flair. Gods and mythological heroes are depicted with long tresses. Also the style agrees with the elements (especially the wind) to accentuate the drama,? Madhvani says. 

 The action star also did much of the stunts. ?It was amazing the way he rode a Quad bike to go dune buggying as if he had been doing this all his life. Sand, after all, is in a different league as a surface to ride on,? Madhvani exclaims.

 The greatest catch lies in the fact that Akshay never got to the tower top. ?It was too risky. Even the viewing gallery was much below,? they explain. So, in came the blue screen against which Akshay was shot, back in Mumbai. ?Mind you, we did not use Motion Control, so there was no way of matching the camera movements,? the director adds. Akshay was filmed in the studio and the angles immediately checked on the monitor for compatibility with the aerial shots. 

 ?Technology hides more than it reveals,? Saraban smiles.

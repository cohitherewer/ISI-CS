 Let the first rays of light on the first day of new year?s dawn usher in joy, peace and harmony in the entire universe (Anandodhara bahichhey bhuvane...) ? Rabindranath Tagore had felt it coming from the core of his heart and with this prayer he heralded a new beginning. Hence, in the first half of today?s programme, siblings Manoj Murali Nair and Manisha Murali Nair will render selected numbers from Tagore?s Puja compositions. Tagore had felt and understood the inner essence of Indian classical music and this is evident in the varied use of ragas and their amalgamations in his compositions. The song, Aaj Shyam Moha Loi was composed in Khambaj raga and the poet used the same structure when he composed Tomari gehe palichhey snehe at the age of 38. Again, he composed songs steeped in the typical Kirtan genre of Bengal and then used the leit motif of Kirtan and amalgamated it with classical ragas like Kafi to create new compositions. In the second half the duo will render a bouquet of popular Rabindrasangeet numbers. 

 Event: Tagore songs by Manisha Murali Nair and Manoj Murali Nair 

When: Today at 6.30 pm

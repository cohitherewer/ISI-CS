 Singers Indrani Sen and Sumitra Sen at Sananda 

Tanishq Moner Mita on Sunday,Picture by Pabitra Das and Aranya Sen 

What: Sananda Tanishq Moner Mita.

 Where: Topaz room at HHI.

When: Sunday afternoon.

Take a look: In the final session of a month-long 

event organised by Sananda in association with Tanishq, eight lucky mother-daughter 

pairs made it to the last six rounds held at the AJC Bose Road hotel. 

An ever-smiling Paroma Banerjee compered the programme 

and quizzed the contestants (sample: Name Rabindranath Tagores wife 

and any of their daughters who is the one mother and daughter pair 

not biologically connected in Bollywood rapid-fire questions on celebrity 

mother-daughter relationships like Jennifer-Sanjana Kapoor).

The other rounds saw couples vying for pole position 

in the jewellery-making round while also sharing their experiences and thoughts 

on the close bond of family and friendship, even reading letters that revealed 

fond memories and precious moments spent together.

The event took quite an emotional turn when several 

mother-daughter participants broke down on stage while recalling how the other 

had been a ray of hope in the darkest moments of life. My mother is everything 

to me, said five-year-old Sanga Mohanty, the youngest participant, who expressed 

her deepest feelings for her physically-challenged mother. Ma, tumi handicapped 

na, tumi amar Ma, she cried.

At the end, Dwaipayan Sen, regional business manager 

for Tanishq, handed over gifts to Indrani Sen and Sumitra Sen, chief guests and 

also judges for the event. Winners Saswati and Sanga Mohanty and all other contestants 

were handed out prizes from Tanishq. This was followed by high tea.

Voiceover: We wanted to emotionally connect 

with the women in society, especially because families in Bengal share closer 

bonds, said Dwaipayan Sen. Sharodiya Sundari will be the next promotional 

event, where women wearing their finest in dress and jewellery visiting any of 

the three Calcutta Tanishq showrooms will be given special gifts.

 We Ask You Answer

 Ploy to grab more votes

 Today?s question: Do you support the mayor?s call to bring hawkers back to the pavement? More responses will be published next week

 Chock-a-block: Portrait 

 of a footpath as a market 

 Kajal Chatterjee,

 Sodepur

 The non-Bengali hawkers of Esplanade, Chandni Chowk, Brabourne Road and Kidderpore were never evicted from the pavements, so the question of their return is redundant. Only the Bengali hawkers, displaced by Operation Sunshine, are being invited to come back to the pavement. In no civilised city of the world are the pedestrians evicted from the pavements to make space for hawkers. No sane person can ever support the mayor?s call. 

Biswajyoti Bagchi, 

 Alipore

 We still remember the young lady who lost a parent in a mishap because there was no space for them to walk on the Hatibagan pavement. The mayor obviously doesn?t. How can anyone support the mayor?s call? If the hawkers must return, they should not be allowed to set up business within 100 m of a crossing.

Danish Khan, 

 Address not given

 No. If Calcutta has to transform itself into a modern city, the pavements must be freed of hawkers. It is the government?s responsibility to provide them some other means of earning a living. The mayor knows that well. He is likely to forget the call once the elections are over.

 N. Datta Roy,

 Howrah

 The return of hawkers to the pavements cannot be justified. Our roads aren?t spacious enough to allow stalls on the footpaths. The mayor?s call will increase mishaps. 

 A. Bose Chowdhury,

 Barrackpore

 The mayor?s decision is imprudent. Allowing hawkers on the pavements is inviting trouble and ire of the common people. If the commuting time within the city increases, its investment-friendly image will also take a hit. 

 D. Chakraborty,

 Tallah 

 No, definitely not. The mayor has given the call only to garner votes. Politicians, irrespective of the party they belong to, are opportunists. No one should believe them.

 Manasi Chakraborti, 

 Address not given

 Footpaths are for pedestrians, hence the mayor?s call cannot be supported. It is a fact that hundreds of thousands of youth are unemployed, but allowing hawking is not the right way of providing them a livelihood.

 Satyen Biswas, 

 Behala

 There isn?t another city in the country as congested as Calcutta. Its pavements should always be kept clear for pedestrians. The mayors call is whimsical.

Sukumar Ghosh,

 Mukundapur 

 The mayor?s call is politically motivated. It will lead to clogging of pavements and loss of lives.

 Sandhya Banerjee,

 Salt Lake

 For the safety of pedestrians, there should not be any encroachment on the pavements. It is strange on the part of the authorities to invite hawkers back to the footpaths when they are being forced to build flyovers for easy movement of vehicles.

 Apurba Kumar Mitra,

 Puddapukur Road

 I support the mayor?s call 100 per cent. 

 Prahlad Agarwala,

 Majdia, Nadia

 I do not support the mayor?s call, especially since most footpaths are already occupied. As a result, pedestrians are forced to walk along the carriageway, risking mishaps.

 R.M. Paulmazumdar,

 Shyamnagar

 The mayor?s call cannot be supported. Allowing hawkers to take up the pavements in Calcutta is tantamount to the murder of pedestrians.

 Prantik Sanyal,

 SP Mukherjee Road

 The hawkers had never left the footpath, so the question of their return does not arise. If the hawkers must stay, the authorities should ensure that they do not occupy the major portion of the footpath.

 Ajit Kumar Das,

 Howrah

 If the footpaths are for pedestrians, why should they be forced to walk along the carriageway? If the law-makers allow the flouting of rules for their personal interest, the court should come forward to protect the rights of the citizens.

 Sayon Roy,

 New Alipore

 Not only do the hawkers create problems for the pedestrians, but they also cause traffic jams, which is another nuisance. Due to the hawkers, people are forced to risk walking along the carriageway. The hawkers should be rehabilitated in markets.

 Anil Kumar Sen,

 RC Chatterjee Lane

 Mishaps and traffic snarls are the outcomes of hawkers occupying the pavements. The government was once forced to undertake Operation Sunshine to reclaim the footpaths, so why are they now looking to reverse the gains? Actually, the mayor wants more votes at any cost.

 Chandan Ray,

 Sakuntala Park

 With lakhs of people unemployed and the ballot box the only means of retaining power, it is impossible for the government to make the footpaths hawker-free. Since the political leaders and cops benefit from the hawker trade, there is nothing that the common people can do except suffer in silence.

 S. Chakravarty,

 Unique Park

 It is a matter of shame that the mayor is robbing the pedestrians of city pavements. He is betraying the common people. The chief minister?s call for peaceful coexistence of hawkers and pedestrians on the footpath is ridiculous. If he was sincere, he would have made alternative arrangements for the hawkers.

Screen On amp; Off

 Yash Chopra was honoured last week with the lifetime achievement award for his contribution to world cinema at a gala dinner party in Melbourne as part of the Indian Film Festival in Australia. The event took place at the spectacular Great Hall of the prestigious National Gallery of Victoria.

 Simi Garewal presented the personal journey of the film-maker to the audience before the award was handed over to Chopra by the Lord Mayor of Melbourne, John So. The award was hand-crafted from rare Australian timbers, specially designed to evoke a unique and quintessentially Australian tribute in Chopras honour.

 Mayor So spoke of the close ties between India and Australia, referring to the Commonwealth Games and the filming of Salaam Namaste. He then welcomed the filming of Chak De! India, the Yash Raj production starring Shah Rukh Khan, to Melbourne.

 The Indian Film Festival had started with the screening of Kabhie Kabhie in Sydney on October 6 and Chopra was overwhelmed to see a full house for Kabhie Kabhie after so many years.

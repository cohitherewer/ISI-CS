 Pamper your plant passion

 February is the right month to start flexing your green thumb. Shradha Agarwal tells you why and how

 HOUSE PROUD 

 We have all heard stories of long-lasting therapeutic friendships shared with plants. But to reap the benefits of such a relationship, we need to sow a seed or two well in time. And time, say experts, means the month of February. 

 The congenial feel happy conditions of spring gives February an edge over the pre-monsoon season, the other time of the year when you can start nurturing your green hobby.

 February is indeed the perfect time to sow seeds. With the dormant winters out of the way, this is the time when sap starts flowing again. So, most people begin to nurture their green thumb at the advent of spring ? returning after a long break during the colder months, says Kavita Poddar, secretary of Pushpa Bitan Friendship Society.

 Spring is also a great time to re-pot your plants because the plants are at their growing best, with new leaves and buds, explains avid gardener Shanti Agarwal.

 Helping you break into a smile, acting as a super stress-buster and infusing lively energy into your home ? the greens can do all that and much more. So heres a GoodLife guide for beginners on the green mile. 

 Pot perfect

 Matters pertaining to size need to be sorted out at the very onset of a plants life. Apart from the usual balanced look factor, the shape and size of the pot can make or break a plants aesthetic appeal. Thoughtful and planned selection of the pot leads to appropriate soil preparation. Here is landscapist Sonali Roy Chowdhurys soil recipe for a standard 10-inch pot size:

 Ingredients: Two parts of garden soil, one part of coir dust, half a portion dung manure, one teaspoon bone dust, half a teaspoon crushed lime.

 Method: Cover two inches of the pot with broken bricks or shards and then pour in half of the prepared soil. Place the plant and then put in the rest of the soil. Strike the edges of the pot with a dipper or a rod, staying away from the roots, lest you cause irreversible damage.

 Press down with your thumb to minimise air gaps and then pour water leaving the top inch empty, explains Sonali. Slowly start introducing the plant to sunlight and acclimatise it according to your preferred location. 

 Home facts

 When it comes to nurturing indoor plants, there are three things to keep in mind ? source of light, correct quantity of water, and feed. 

 Establishing the right source of light is very important right in the beginning of the plants innings. While some green friends are happy sunning themselves partially, others are most comfortable in the darkest corner of the room. So, you must understand your plants needs.

 First, get the nursery staff to guide you through your plants placement. Also get their precise sun dose instead of randomly pushing and pulling the pots around.

 Acclimatisation is the key to having any healthy plant at home, says Sonali. A close watch must be kept to pick up any signal that the plant might send out. 

 Plants will definitely let you know if the light source isnt suiting them. Their revolt and anger is often evident, adds Sonali.

 Some indoor, shade-loving plants get used to sunlight in the nursery, thanks to lack of covered storage space. Put them in the sunny areas of your home, offers Sonali.

 The sun factor decided, watering your plants is the next big task. Romantic as it may seem, the Bollywood-style swinging and singing along hosepipe in hand is the biggest blot in any gardeners book.

 According to Deepak Erasmus, secretary and CEO of Agri-Horticultural Society of India, this display of over-enthusiasm is a common mistake. People tend to think that all a plant needs is water and as a result, they land up over-watering their plants.

 Experts say you should always let the water run through your plants and not rain down on them every day. Watering them on alternate days is a better idea and that too, only after feeling the existing moisture content of the pot. The size of the pot is essential too, since a smaller pot dries faster, explains Sonali.

 Finally, the quantity of food is vital for the healthy growth of your plant. Beginners are advised to pick up balanced plant food available over the counter rather than experiment with chemical fertilisers, that are best left to trained hands.

 The essential factor here is to feed the plants twice a month with an exact gap of 15 days, says Sonali.

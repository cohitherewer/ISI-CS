 Cadre revels in Maidan maul

 Green. No prize for guessing the only hue that was missing from the Maidan on Sunday. Scene of a 30-lakh footfall, the precious lungs of our over-polluted city suffered silently for more than six hours.

 But the Maidan maul had other defining sights, too. Hours after the Left Front rally gave over and the mammoth gathering dispersed, the green was an assortment of newspaper heaps, fruit peels, plastic bags, khullars, paper plates and plastic cups. 

 The assault was evidently on a scale much larger than on December 28, when the CPM-backed Coordination Committee celebrated its golden jubilee on the same spot.

 The familiar open sprawl turned into seemingly endless rows of saal poles and bamboos. Some 250 poles were dug ? each hole was two feet deep ? to support around 450 microphones. According to a modest estimate by the representatives of Jayshree Decorators, entrusted by the Front to deck up the Maidan to death, around 150 poles were dug to set up the VIP enclosure, VIP car park and the dais. 

 And even they failed to say how many bamboos were used. ?It?s difficult to estimate. Apart from the ones used to hold the microphones, we had to set up so many enclosures, all of which were of bamboo,? said employee Abdul Hossain.

 Vendors didn?t miss the chance of tapping such a huge, though short-lived, market. Almost everything was on sale ? leather belts, bags, ghugni, chaat, apparel, oranges, bananas, papayas, omelettes... 

 The comrades did not let them down, buying things in bulk and scattering around the waste in wild abandon. As if that was not enough, they made it a point to leave behind in the evening whatever they were carrying in the morning ? newspapers, plastic bags, sweet packets and water bottles. 

 ?You?re missing something,? pointed out Kanai Lal Tripathi, of Dum Dum. ?Look at the number of people relieving themselves at Dancing Fountain and Victoria Memorial.?

 Left Front chairman Biman Bose urged his comrades to clear up the mess by Monday. Optimists saw a ray of hope in the call. Cynics were reminded of what happened after the December 28 rally.

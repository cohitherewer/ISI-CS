The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Father or mother? Why must I choose, asks son

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Soumya Talapatra, 14, stood before the imposing desk of justice at Calcutta High Court on Monday afternoon, wringing his fingers nervously, waiting for the dreaded question.

 Who would you like to live with, your father or your mother? asked Justice K.J. Sengupta, explaining that at age 14, he was legally entitled to decide which of his estranged parents, Swarup and Gargi Talapatra, he would like to be with.

 Slowly and softly, Soumya replied: I need both my parents. My mother loves me very much, cares a lot for me... But somewhere deep inside, I know I need my father very much, as well.

 The Kramer vs Kramer moment can be traced back to the time when Soumya was barely a year old. His parents had separated then, his mother leaving their Baguiati home for a rented apartment in Bally, Howrah.

 Gargi had taken Soumya with her. He was admitted to Ramakrishna Mission School in Sarisha. His parents later initiated divorce proceedings. Soumya never saw his father, and was told that he lived far away.

 On Monday, the teenager revealed the scars of his growing-up years: The parents of all my friends at school would come and meet them regularly, but in my case, it was only my mother Some of my friends would also make fun of me.

 The trauma soon got to Soumya, whose grades began to drop. Finally, his mother had to shift him to a school in Bally. It was here that Swarup suddenly came to visit him, a few months ago. Soumya recognised his father from the photographs at home and was thrilled to see him. Swarup gave him Rs 2,000 to buy books and promised to be back.

 That visit inspired me to work really hard and I came first this term, Soumya told the judges. Even though I get the entire love of my mother, which is very fulfilling, there is still a void within me because of the absence of my father. What this feeling of emptiness is, I cannot explain.

 Soumya then pleaded with the bench that something be done to reunite his parents so that I can stay with both of them. Gargi, who was present in court, told the judges that for the sake of her son, she was willing to be with her husband again.

 As a first step, judges Sengupta and Sanjib Banerjee said Swarup could visit his son every week. The matter will be reviewed in three months.

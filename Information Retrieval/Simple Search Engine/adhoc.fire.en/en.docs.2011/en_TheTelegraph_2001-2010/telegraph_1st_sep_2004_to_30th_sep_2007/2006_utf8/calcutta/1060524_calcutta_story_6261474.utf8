 Shooting for both the big and small screens came to a stop in the city on Tuesday following a showdown over work distribution between two rival groups of Tollywood technicians.

 The Federation of Cine Technicians and Workers of Eastern India, that stands accused by rival group Video Guild of monopolising work, called for an ?indefinite strike? till the matter is resolved.

 Members of Video Guild, a trade union of video technicians, ransacked NT1 studio on Monday and stopped work on four TV serials ? Bonhisikha, Tamasarekha, Dhyatterika and Jaya. They were back on Tuesday morning when the production teams began shooting, forcing them to stop work.

 ?Around 90 men from Video Guild stormed the NT1 premises at 9.30 am today when we had just started shooting. It was a repeat of yesterday and we were forced to stop,? said Atanu Roy of Sweet Melody that produces Bonhisikha, Tamasarekha and Dhyatterika. Roy is counting losses of around Rs 7 lakh for two days of ceasework.

 Tuesday?s trouble also took a toll on a Probhat Roy feature film starring Jeet and Swastika Mukherjee, at the studios.

 ?They manhandled the production team at NT1 and threatened to smash the cameras if we didn?t stop work,? alleged Cine Federation joint secretary Alok Bhowmick. 

 Industry sources said trouble over work distribution between the two unions had been brewing for about a year. Things took a turn for the worse over the past week and came to a head on Monday.

 But the hard times have brought friends and foes in the acting fraternity together in a show of strength and support. Members of Artistes? Forum went into a huddle at Technicians on Tuesday afternoon to find a solution. Those present at the meeting included forum secretary Prosenjit, Soumitra Chatterjee, Indrani Halder, Jeet, Jisshu Sengupta, Swastika, Sabyasachi Chakraborty, and rival politicians Tapas Pal and Biplab Chatterjee.

 Seeking government intervention to resolve the crisis, Artistes? Forum, along with Cine Federation, Video Guild and Producers? Section, will meet officials at Writers? Buildings on Wednesday afternoon, said forum spokesperson Arun Banerjee.

 But it was a Tuesday of torment for Tollywood as the shooting of all feature films, telefilms and TV serials, at the studios as well as outdoors, remained suspended. 

 Anindita Sarbadhicary, who was to shoot her telefilm at City Centre but had to call it off, said: ?We want skilled technicians in our teams; we are not concerned with who belongs to which trade union. The industry has lost at least Rs 40 lakh today.?

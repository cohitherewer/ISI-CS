 B-school lessons at marketplace

 CHANDREYEE CHATTERJEE

 For two days, some Indian Institute of Management Calcutta (IIMC) classes will be shifting from Joka to 22 Camac Street to ensure students get hands-on experience in market research.

 The wannabe managers will get an early exposure to the tricks of the marketing trade, courtesy a festival being organised by the IIMC this month.

 Census 2006 will provide students the opportunity to be part of marketing research projects. This will give them hands-on exposure, said Ankit Gupta, second-year student at the institute.

 The data collection will be done on November 30 and 31 at 22 Camac Street, a popular hangout.

 Marketing research is the gathering and evaluation of data regarding consumers preferences for products and services. Gauging customer satisfaction, estimating brand awareness, perception and loyalty and study of customer attitudes and usage habits are vital parts of the exercise.

 Census is going to be different from conventional marketing research. We are not using questionnaires to do the survey. Instead, the respondents will be led through a series of carefully designed interactive games, added Gupta.

 The data collected over two days will be analysed by the students with help from experts. The reports will be submitted to the companies.

 The festival will be an interface between companies and IIMC students. We hope the interface translates to more research projects, said Gupta.

 The institute has tied up with AC Nielsen-ORG MARG to train the 100-odd students taking part in the festival and provide them guidance. Both first-year and second-year students will be part of the event. The IIM faculty will also be at hand to provide guidance.

 Project offers started coming to the institute a month back and the students started work a week ago. The participants, in teams of 13, have been working on seven projects for companies like the ITC, Tata Tea and the RPG group. 

 The companies are paying the expenses involved in the projects. The amount varies from project to project, stated Gupta.

 The initiative will provide an excellent opportunity to the students to experience marketing research first-hand. The exercise will allow students to study Indian consumers, which is not possible in the classroom as the textbooks are written mainly by Americans. However, the sample will not be representative, observed veteran market researcher and Metro columnist Shiloo Chattopadhyay.

 Census will not only provide an opportunity for students to work with stalwarts of the industry, it will also be an exposure of the companies to IIMC students, observed a student taking part in the event.

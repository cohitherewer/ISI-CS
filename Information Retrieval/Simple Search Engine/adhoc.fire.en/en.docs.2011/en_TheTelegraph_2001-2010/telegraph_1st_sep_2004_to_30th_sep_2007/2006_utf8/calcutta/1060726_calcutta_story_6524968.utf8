The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Eye clinic in expand schedule

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Chairman and president of Rotary Narayan Sankara Nethralaya S.S. Badrinath met chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on Tuesday, to discuss an extension plan of the eye hospital in Salt Lake.

 After meeting the chief minister at Writers? Buildings, Badrinath said that they are planning to increase the number of doctors, so that more patients can be treated at a given time. Currently, the hospital treats 250 patients every day, of whom more than 50 per cent come for surgery. 

 ?We intend to extend our services to more people, especially to the poor ,who cannot afford an eye surgery. We need more trained doctors and nurses. I hope this plan will materialise in a year?s time,? said Badrinath. 

 He added that the Calcutta branch of Sankara Nethralaya would be upgraded on the lines of the Chennai wing. ?We will have the same facilities in both the branches, so that patients from this region do not have to rush down South for treatment.? 

 He claimed that both the institutes are equally equipped to meet the patients? demand.

 ?We just need a few more trained doctors here. Else, I think both branches are equally good,? he explained. 

 Plans are also afoot to open another branch in Siliguri. A research institute, called National Institute for Research in Vision Sciences and Ophthalmology, is also on the cards in Chennai. A similar research wing will also come in Calcutta, Badrinath claimed.

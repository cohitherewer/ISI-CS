 British Council, in association with Hutch and Tollygunge Club, presents an exciting new performance of Shakespeare?s A Midsummer Night?s Dream. The concept of this multi-lingual (English, Tamil, Malayalam, Sinhala, Hindi, Bengali, Marathi and a smattering of Sanskrit) production, bringing together acting talent from all across the Indian subcontinent, is unique. Besides reflecting the innovativeness of the UK arts scene and its openness to working in a multi-cultural context, it also makes a clear statement about how Shakespeare?s works can cut across cultural boundaries even 400 years after they were written. One of the most popular romantic comedies ever, the play offers a delightful mix of sense and nonsense, reality and fantasy, love and animosity, uncovering depths of meaning underneath apparently simple surfaces. What is most important about the play is that it approaches the text from a completely Indian perspective, attempting to illuminate with fresh clarity one of the world?s great folk plays. Direction: Tim Supple.

When: Today and tomorrow; 6.45 pm

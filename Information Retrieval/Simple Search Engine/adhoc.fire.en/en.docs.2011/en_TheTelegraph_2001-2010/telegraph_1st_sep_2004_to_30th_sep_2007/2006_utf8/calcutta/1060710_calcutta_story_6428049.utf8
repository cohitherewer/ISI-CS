Life

 On track with Tagores tunes 

 ANUMITA GHOSH

 For some, music is an accompaniment 

 while doing math or reading books. For me when its 

 music, its only music and nothing else, stresses 

 Smartya Majumdar (in picture ), a 22-year-old management 

 student who prefers Aakash jure shuninu over Aashiq 

 banaya.

 The second-year student at IISWBM, busy making a mark as a Rabindrasangeet singer, was introduced to the world of music as a toddler. My mother would often sing at home. I would also listen to a lot of music on radio and television. And before I knew it, I wanted to sing myself, says Smartya.

 He received a few months of classical music training in Bhubaneswar before his family moved back to Calcutta. The young boy, then in Class VII, was schooled in Rabindrasangeet by the late Piyush Kanti Sarkar. Smartya marks this as his serious foray into the world of music, for it was during this phase that his passion for Rabindrasangeet deepened.

 There has been no looking back since. School fests and inter-school competitions followed, along with the Voices Best Singer award in 2000. In 2002, Smartya started training under Rabindrasangeet exponent Sraboni Sen. This has been the most enriching experience. Srabonidi is more than a mentor, she is someone who has helped me achieve whatever I am today, he adds. 

 The young man is clear that he wants to build a career in music. I am ready to struggle, but if nothing substantial happens I will have my MBA degree to fall back on, says Smartya, marrying passion with pragmatism.

 But with regular stage shows and a music album to his credit already, nothing substantial happening is only a distant possibility.

 Smartyas debut album titled Nabin Asha, launched in May, is a compilation of 10 Rabindrasangeet songs.

 Rabindrasangeet was a definite choice. Composed years ago, it continues to fit just fine in modern-day life situations. It is a genre that explores every mood, every emotion, he feels. 

 The album features tracks with varying themes ? Pinakete lage tankar, exploring natures adverse effects, Tumi rabe nirabe, a romantic melody, and Bhengechho duar eshechho jyotirmoy, on revolution. Some, like Shraboner dharar moto and Aaj jyotsna raate have been made into music videos.

 Juggling studies, stage performances, riyaz and learning piano from Shankar Chatterjee, Smartya spends his spare time listening to music ? melodies ranging from the 1940s to 2006.

 An ardent Shah Rukh Khan fan, Smartya loves watching movies too. Some day I would love to sing playback for the King Khan, he smiles.

 CID steps into campus

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) on Friday took over the probe into the death of Soumik Basu, a third-year student of Bengal Engineering and Science University (Besu).

 A team of sleuths comprising additional director general S. Ramakrishnan, inspector-general D.P. Tarania and deputy inspector-general (DIG) Soumen Mitra arrived on the campus at 3.30 pm and went around hostel no. 11, in front of which Soumik was found lying injured on the morning of August 9. 

 Initial reports suggested that Soumik had died after falling off the second floor of a hostel on the Shibpur campus. But his family suspected foul play and demanded a thorough probe.

 The university, too, had made a similar appeal to the government, following which the probe was handed over to the CID.

 University registrar Indranath Sinha and senior officers of the district police accompanied the CID team, which spent 30 minutes on campus. The CID on Friday took over the probe into Soumiks death, announced Sinha.

 Earlier, vice-chancellor N. R. Banerjea pledged full cooperation with sleuths.

 DIG Mitra later said: A team of officers visited the spot on Friday and talked to a few students. We have received a complaint from Soumiks family about the death and are investigating the case.

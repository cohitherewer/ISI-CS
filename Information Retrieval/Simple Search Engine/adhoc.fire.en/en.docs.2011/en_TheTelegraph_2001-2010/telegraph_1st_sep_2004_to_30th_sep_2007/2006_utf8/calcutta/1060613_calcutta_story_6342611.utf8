Life

 Liplock laws

 A nightclub smooch is 

 common, but is it correct? GoodLife checks 

 with some party regulars, in the wake of Rakhi Sawants 

 kiss and yell

 Devdutta,

 model 

 Kissing is okay but it depends 

 on how you are doing it and where you are doing it?I think 

 its about knowing your limits. Rakhi Sawant? Well, 

 nobody knows the real story. It could be a big case of misunderstanding 

 or it could well be a publicity stunt. I think for once, 

 we should give her the benefit of doubt. Maybe he (Mika) 

 tried to do something against her wishes.

 Naveen Pai, 

 restaurateur 

 As long as any form of kissing is done aesthetically, in public or private, there should be no problem. Aesthetically also means the mutual consent of both parties involved. In this case, Rakhi Sawant is accusing Mika of coming on to her forcefully, which is not done. Having said that, I think Rakhi should have sorted out the problem with him, instead of going public.

 DJ Vicky, 

 Venom

 These days, most party regulars refrain from such public displays of affection. They are smart enough to reserve such intimacy for later, when they are alone. But as far as the Rakhi Sawant episode is concerned, I had a major fight with her myself during an event in Calcutta. Knowing her the little that I do, she is someone who can stoop to any level for attention. All this is nothing but a publicity stunt from someone who is always trying desperately to be in the news.

 June, 

 actress 

 A couple should be careful about how they are behaving if they are in public scrutiny? I think a girl invites attention only of the kind she wants to. Its not all about Rakhi Sawant and it is not about the clothes a woman wears. Even someone covered from tip to toe could send out wrong signals. No man can suddenly come and grab a lady. Her body language, her conduct and above all, the vibes she gives out to the opposite sex matters.

 Sovan Mukherjee,

 manager, Shisha

 Kissing in public is quite acceptable these days, but smooching is definitely not a done thing in a nightclub. Not only does it raises eyebrows, it also invites trouble for the couple. We, at Shisha, surely do not encourage a liplock; stern action is taken against those who do it.

 Anirban Simlai,

 director F amp;B, The Park

 Smooching in a nightclub is definitely not acceptable. Affection is okay, but you have to draw the line with a peck on the cheek or lips. This current episode is blown out of proportion. It is nothing but a cheap gimmick.

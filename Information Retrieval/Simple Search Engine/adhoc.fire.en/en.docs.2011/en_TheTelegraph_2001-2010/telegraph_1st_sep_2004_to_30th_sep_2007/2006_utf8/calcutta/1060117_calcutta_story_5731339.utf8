 Long way to home

 Around the world: Ewan McGregor and Charley Boorman

 A novel journey crossed the starting line on Monday at 9 pm on Discovery Travel amp; Living. Christened The Long Way Round Week, the show is a gripping, no-holds-barred account of an epic motorcycle journey through Europe, Asia, Canada and the US undertaken by actors Ewan McGregor and Charley Boorman.

 The series, to come every Sunday at 9 pm from Episode Six, follows the expedition through nine roller-coaster months of planning. In the first episode, we saw Charley explaining how they went out to Australia where Ewan was filming Star Wars so they could go on a trial run. While Ewan is a seasoned camper, Charley is not. Back in England, the boys set up HQ for preparations in Shepherd?s Bush.

 Starting in January, Ewan and Charley undertake in-depth training and intensive route planning research to ensure they are prepared for departure in April. Signing up with an organisation that assists and prepares groups to face hostile situations through their activities, the duo learns how to deal with rogue border officials, bear attacks, freezing temperatures and even handle guns.

 As they start mapping out their route, they have meetings with fixers and officials to get more information about the places where ?people never come back from?.

 The preparation involves fitness training, kidnap avoidance, difficult border crossings, first-aid instruction, gathering and testing of equipment and clothing, and getting the required vaccinations. 

 Tuesday?s episode is a montage of last-minute preparations. Ewan and Charley with heavily-laden BMW bikes are sent off from the headquarters down the streets of London with a world-shaped cake, banners, cheering and applause from the crew, family and friends. 

 The first stop is Prague. Ewan and Charley enjoy playing tourists: having a caricature done, seeing the sights and visiting the Church of Bones at Kutna Hora. Trouble arises in the form of forgetting to get the carnet signed at the last border as they proceed to Slovakia. ?Negotiations? with the border guards finally grants them passage. Then starts their struggle with the language at a market, even as a flashback cuts to their Russian lessons in London. 

 The viewers get to share destinations the two are taken to ? a coal mine, a beautiful 14th century mausoleum in Kazakhstan, a goat polo match... In need of pampering, Ewan and Charley go to a traditional Kazakh spa. The massage they receive involves a brutal beating and rubdown! 

 After the ride through France, Belgium, Germany, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Ukraine, Russia, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, Siberia, Alaska and Canada, the reel stars reach their final destination, New York City, after 115 days.

 Ewan heaves a huge sigh: ?I can hardly believe we?ve made our dreams come true and although at times it?s been very, very tough, the people and places on the way have touched me to my core. It?s been a Long Way Round but I?m glad to be home.?

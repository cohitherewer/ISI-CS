 Woo the husband or the Wandering He

 CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA 

 CHANCES UPON A PAGE FROM THE CONSULTATIONS OF MA SHENG FUI, 

 OFFERING A SOLUTION TO EVERY PROBLEM BY REARRANGING THE FURNITURE

 Dear Ma Sheng Fui, after 

 coming back home every day, my husband heads straight for 

 the sofa, grabs the remote and starts to switch channels. 

 He only moves or looks up if he gets a call or a message 

 on his mobile. The sofa is in the north-east of the drawing 

 room and the TV is directly opposite it, i.e., south-west. 

 The mobile is in hand. Should I shift the furniture around 

 a bit? I have the greatest regard for you and I believe 

 everything that you say on your website. Kindly advise 

 Sumita Dhar, Baguiati. 

 Dear Sumita, this is a 

 very common problem now. In many homes women have to compete 

 more with gadgets than with other women. But Sheng Fui has 

 a solution to every problem. Check the manufacturing dates 

 of the TV set and the mobile phone. If they were manufactured 

 before 2000, chances are that your husband will tire of 

 them soon. But if he doesnt, or if the TV and the 

 handset were made later, there is a problem.

 You have to build an alcove in 

 the south-south-west-west corner of the room, just below 

 the ceiling, and place the TV there. Then you have to stand 

 between the TV and your husband. That will stop the free 

 flow of energy between the TV and him. To keep him off the 

 mobile, remain standing where you are and keep sending messages 

 to your husbands phone from yours. It should work.

 Dear Ma Sheng Fui, my 17-year-old 

 son doesnt study Sunetra Agarwal, Salt Lake.

 Dear Sunetra, it must be 

 the abstract painting on the southern wall in the room where 

 he studies. You didnt know what to do with it, so 

 you dumped it on him. It has circles with circles inside 

 them in various colours, doesnt it? It is confusing 

 him. 

 You must remember that children 

 should not suffer from any abstract art. They are only allowed 

 landscapes, pictures of flowers, fish, the blue sky, a cuddly 

 small boy and a cuddly small girl in oversize sunglasses 

 saying I love you to each other, dolphins diving 

 and other things that make one crow Cho Chweet. 

 You are also recommended to go every week and stand before 

 a billboard on EM Bypass, which is a wild spread of pink 

 and crimson roses. Life will soon be a bed of roses, 

 it says. 

 Sheng Fui also recommends a particular 

 wallpaper, manufactured by a company I know where you get 

 25 per cent discount if you mention my name. The wallpaper 

 is designed entirely with Gandhijis quotes. 

 Your son will not be able to look anywhere else but at his 

 books. He will grow up to be a fine, balanced individual 

 and have a prosperous career as a bore-well tube manufacturer. 

 Dear Ma Sheng Fui, I cannot 

 sleep at night. Its the toilet bowl. Just when I am 

 about to fall asleep, theres a loud, croaking noise 

 from the toilet. I wake up with a shudder. Then I hear the 

 sound of flushing. I doze off, but I wake up, because this 

 time there is a distinct noise of someone clearing the throat 

 while his chest remains heavily congested. I try to doze 

 off again, but this time there is a deep, angry growl, then 

 the sound of someone being strangled, followed by this huge 

 noise of flushing.

 I have a speaking commode, dear 

 Ma. It also flushes by itself. Its scaring my wits 

 out. A friend suggests that it could be the ghost of things 

 that I cast out trapped in the commode. I live on the eighth 

 floor of a highrise. The toilet is in the north-east of 

 the flat. I was born on 10.10.75 and am still single. Help 

 Anamitra Mukherjee, Ballygunge.

 Dear Anamitra, its 

 the Wandering He, the principle of male energy on which 

 the nine pillars of destiny are afloat, struggling to escape 

 into your life.

 Foolish girl, this is just what 

 you need and you are so blind and foul-mouthed. You can 

 do two things. 

 One, since the toilet is not supposed 

 to face the kitchen, you can install it right in the middle 

 of the bedroom. Then float three scented candles on the 

 water in the pot, one green, one maroon, one blue. Maroon 

 is for passion, green is for environment and blue is for 

 the sea. And the Wandering He. That will turn your life 

 into a beautiful postcard. 

 Two, you can install the Aquaguard 

 with its music option switched on in the bathroom. That 

 will shut the commode up. I suspect my Aquaguard plays the 

 theme song of Love Story, but I cant make up 

 my mind.

 Dear Ma Sheng Fui, my girlfriend 

 is addicted to Himesh Reshammiya. What to do? Name withheld, 

 Dum Dum.

 Throw her out of the window and 

 dont look down.

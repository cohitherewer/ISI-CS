 Art holds the unique distinction of being able to forge unlikely links between peoples and cultures. The ongoing exhibition of paintings by Norwegian artist Alfred Vaagsvold (Toward Light) and the Indian painter Ganesh C. Basu (Ancient Love) provides a fine illustration of this quality. Conspicuous for their abstract patterns created through interlocking lines and rhythmical colour effects, the paintings of both artists bespeak a desire to discover the truth of life. Vaagsvold?s art reveals a free and playful spirit, whence all his creations burst forth in a flood of intense joy. At the same time, in the language of his shapes and the choice of his colours, one notices a movement from darkness and suffering to hope and enlightenment. Inspired by primitive and folk art, Basu?s works draw on ancient culture to convey the universality of human emotion.

 Event: An exhibition of paintings by Alfred Vaagsvold and Ganesh C. Basu

 Classes at Bengal Engineering and Science University (BESU), suspended following campus violence on Tuesday night, will resume on Monday.

 At a two-hour meeting of the university?s disciplinary committee on Friday evening, it was decided that a white paper on the regular flare-ups on campus would be prepared and sent to the guardians.

 Vice-chancellor N.R. Banerjea had earlier suggested that classes remain suspended till a meeting with guardians was convened.

 The change of tack on Friday was forced by the teachers at BESU joining ranks with the students in demanding that classes be resumed with immediate effect.

 In a letter to the vice-chancellor, the Bengal Engineering and Science University Teachers? Association made it clear that it would ?intervene? if the stalemate continued.

 Association secretary Manas Hira said that under no circumstances should the academic schedule be disrupted. ?The vice-chancellor?s primary responsibility is to run BESU,? he stressed. ?There was violence on the campus last July and September. Three students had been identified for indiscipline, but they were not given exemplary punishment.?

 The disciplinary committee meeting on Friday was attended by the four deans, 13 heads of departments, the registrar and Banerjea.

 ?This is, indeed, good news,? said Kaustav Banerjee, spokesperson for Bengal Engineering College Students? Union, once word trickled out after the meeting.

 Before the meeting, the vice-chancellor had gone to meet higher education minister Satyasadhan Chakraborty.

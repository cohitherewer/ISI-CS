The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Fine more, flout less

 KINSUK BASU

 The penalty pinch for flouting road rules is set to become a penalty punch, if traffic police have their way.

 To make punitive measures an effective deterrent against violation of traffic rules, the department has proposed a steep hike in fines. Officers believe higher fines will curb rule flout and lower the accident count.

 The proposed rates are two to five times the current fines (see graphic).

 For instance, failure to halt at the stop sign now attracts a penalty of Rs 100 the first time and Rs 300 thereafter. The traffic department wants to raise the rates to Rs 500 and Rs 1,500.

 For reckless driving, the offender either has to pay a fine of Rs 1,000 or be imprisoned for six months. The amount might be increased to Rs 5,000 and the prison term to two years. 

 The proposal is part of the Comprehensive Plan for Improving City Traffic and awaits the state law department?s approval.

 ?The idea is not to fleece the offenders. If the fine pinches you hard, you will be extra careful the next time you are on the road,? said deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Jawed Shamim, adding that the proposal drew heavily on traffic systems abroad. ?The British, for example, pay a hefty amount for traffic violation.?

 Violations under Section 177 of the Motor Vehicles Act, including taxi refusal, use of cellphone while driving and parking within 30 ft of a crossing will also draw sterner punishment.

 ?The proposals are not limited to raising the fines; we have also called for basic changes in the law. For instance, driving without a licence shall be made a cognisable offence under section 279A of the IPC, while offences like rash and negligent driving shall be made non-bailable,? said a senior officer of the traffic department.

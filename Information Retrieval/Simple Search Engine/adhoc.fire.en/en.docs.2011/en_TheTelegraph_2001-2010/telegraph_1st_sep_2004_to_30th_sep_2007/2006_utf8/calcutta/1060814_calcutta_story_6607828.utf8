 Rebuild at cave-in flats after scan

 Broken dreams: The collapsed balconies of the CIT apartments in Kasba. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya

 Sovan Ghosh:The balconies of the one-room tenements in Kasba 

 have collapsed within 30 years of their construction due 

 to lack of maintenance. Are you planning to repair them? 

 Why didnt you repair them earlier, considering that you 

 collect rent from the tenants? 

 We have asked our engineers to inspect the Kasba apartments. We will try to find out which type of repairing work is needed to avert loss of lives in future. We will take action on the basis of the report. We had asked the tenants to buy their flats but most of them were not willing to do so.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 TV rules redefined

 - Showcase 

 for finest programmes 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 A still from Brain Damajd

 Innovative, creative and risk-taking programming across all genres fact and fiction extending the boundaries of television, by finding new ways of attracting audiences.

 Thats what INPUT (acronym for INternational PUblic Television), the largest television organisation in the world in the domain of public TV, fosters in an annual weeklong television showcase of the finest programming from around the world, where rules of broadcasting are redefined.

 While international televisions most important conference is held in a different country every year (Taiwan in 2006), Calcutta will host a Mini-INPUT to show our young film-makers the best television programmes that get selected.

 The three-day screening sessions of 17 award-winning TV films (at Max Mueller Bhavan, September 1-3) have been organised by INPUT jointly with the Goethe-Institut, Max Mueller Bhavan Calcutta.

 INPUT exists to give exposure to programmes for their own merit, without regard to national pride or commercial interest. It also stimulates discussions with critical emphasis on the role of the producer and broadcaster as socially responsible communicators, says Abhijit Das Gupta, the first Indian to be elected to the international board of INPUT.

 As national coordinator for INPUT, Das Gupta selected two programmes in 2005 the first two Indian programmes to get picked by the jury for international consideration in 29 years. These are Thinking Allowed by Judhajit Sarkar and Kaya Taran by Sashi Kumar.

 The package also includes such acclaimed programmes like Luiz Fernando Carvalhos Today is Marias Day (Brazil), Stefan Randstroms The After Life of Einsteins Brain (Canada), Scott Dalton and Margarita Martinezs La Sierra (Colombia), Heinrich Breloers Speer and Hitler (Germany) and Paul Nadlers Brain Damajd (Canada).

 Showcasing the very best of world TV programming, this festival can open up a floodgate of ideas for local TV channels, many of whom are often starved of quality software, observes S.V. Raman, programme director, Max Mueller Bhavan.

 Das Gupta feels that in India, we lack neither skill nor technical knowhow to compete effectively with the rest of the world. Like the IT sector, in video software generation, too, we can take a lead role only if we think a little differently in terms of style and treatment, he adds.

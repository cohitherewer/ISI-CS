 It was Rahul Dravid in 2004. It was Shah Rukh Khan in 2005. Who will it be in 2006? The hunt for India?s Youth Icon has never looked more enticing with Pepsi?s brand ambassadors Priyanka Chopra and Rahul Dravid inviting the country?s youth to vote for their choice of the year. The two stars will kick-off the hunt by announcing the final six nominees of the Pepsi amp; MTV Youth Icon 2006.

 The competition is as tough as it gets with the finalists including Mahendra Singh Dhoni (Sports), Navjyot Singh Sidhu (Television), Vijay Mallya (Business), President Dr APJ Abdul Kalam (Science), John Abraham (Films) and Abhijeet Sawant (Music). The final nominations have been arrived at after a 10-city study conducted by the research agency IMRB.

 Before the eventual winner is announced in June, specially branded Pepsi 600 ml PET bottles, with Youth Icon labels carrying the SMS voting codes will be up for grabs. Five lucky contest winners will get a chance to meet his or her Icon on MTV.

 On air, Priyanka Chopra will call for votes and Rahul Dravid, in his capacity as former Youth Icon, will introduce the six nominee specials.

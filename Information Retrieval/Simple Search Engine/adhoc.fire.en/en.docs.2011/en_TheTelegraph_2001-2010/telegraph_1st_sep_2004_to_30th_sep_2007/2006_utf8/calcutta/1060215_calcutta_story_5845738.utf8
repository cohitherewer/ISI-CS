 We Ask You Answer

 Variety spice of book fair fare

 Today?s question: Should sale of products other than books be allowed at the Book Fair? More responses will be published next week

 Food, for thought and more: People 

 grab a bite at the Book Fair

 Atif Ayaz,

 Serampore 

 Why not? There is nothing wrong 

 in selling products other than books at the Book Fair. Honestly, 

 visitors will get bored if there were only books on sale 

 at the fair. Food and other refreshments are a must since 

 many people visit the fair from far-off places. The idea 

 of a ban on other products is preposterous. 

 Dipashri Biswas,

 Beleghata 

 Over the past couple of years, 

 the Book Fair has become a maze. Not only food, but all 

 kinds of other products having no connection with books 

 are sold there. I wonder why the fair is still called Book 

 Fair? The authorities seem unwilling to understand that 

 things contrary to character of the fair draw the wrong 

 kind of people as well.

 Biman Bose, 

 Lake Town 

 Sale of toys, CDs, calenders and 

 stationery can be allowed at the Book Fair. However, the 

 basic purpose of the fair should not be lost in the process. 

 Sale of food and drinks can be allowed in an enclosure on 

 the fairground to prevent littering.

 Anil Kumar Sen, 

 Ram Chandra Chatterjee Lane 

 It is wrong to merge the Book 

 Fair with other fairs. However, it cannot be denied that 

 food and music stalls are part of the Book Fair attraction. 

 R.M. Paulmazumdar,

 Address not given 

 Sale of other products should 

 not be allowed at the Book Fair since that would affect 

 the sale of books. Few people read since the spread of television. 

 Products other than books should not be allowed at the Book 

 Fair to preserve the reading habit.

 Ronita Dutta,

 Jadavpur 

 There should definitely be restrictions 

 on the sale of products other than books at the Book Fair. 

 But the strictures can be relaxed for CDs and food products.

 Mahasweta Saha,

 Garia 

 Sale of products other than books 

 can be allowed at the Book Fair, only if its name is changed. 

 What is the use of calling a fair Book Fair if all kinds 

 of products are sold in it?

 Ajit Kumar Das,

 Ghusury 

 It takes not less than two hours 

 to cover even a portion of the Book Fair. To browse and 

 buy books to the heart?s content it is essential to take 

 breaks. Hence, tea or coffee stalls can be allowed on the 

 fairground. But I am against the sale of other food items 

 at the Book Fair.

 Bhupen Bose,

 Dum Dum 

 Thousands of people from the suburbs 

 visit the Book Fair with their families. They would be inconvenienced 

 if no food is available on the fairground. Over the years, 

 sale of CDs, greeting cards and paintings have become an 

 integral part of the fair. Sale of schoolbags and stationery 

 can also be allowed. In addition, presence of first-aid 

 and fire brigade stalls are a must in any fair spread over 

 a large area.

 B.N. Bose, 

 Dum Dum Park 

 Several other fairs are held for 

 those who want to buy other products. Students and book-lovers 

 visit the Book Fair to browse and buy books. So, why allow 

 the sale of other products here? Book Fair is Calcutta?s 

 pride. Nothing should be allowed to tarnish its prestige.

 Ahasan Jahir molla, 

 Bangalore 

 Yes, because it is a ?fair?. Presence 

 of various types of products in a fair is natural. A bit 

 of colour at the Book Fair will not displease most visitors, 

 plus small traders will get a platform to make some money.

 Prasenjit Das,

 Jadavpur 

 There should be restrictions on 

 the sale of products other than books at the Book Fair. 

 Otherwise, visitors might be lured away by other products. 

 The danger of selling food is that it will inevitably lead 

 to the venue being dirtied.

 Mahesh Prasad,

 Hooghly 

 The Book Fair is a unique event 

 and plays an important role in promoting education and a 

 reading habit. We must take measures to ensure that the 

 visitors to the fair do not face any distraction.

 Satyen Biswas,

 Behala 

 Book Fair does not mean a food 

 fair. It is an exhibition of books, and only books. At most, 

 a few teastalls can be set up on the fairground.

 Asmita Kundu,

 Gobinda Sarkar Lane 

 It is not just bookworms who visit 

 the Book Fair. The fair authority should decide on the basis 

 of what the majority wants. I feel the sale of other items 

 should not be banned.

 Nirmalendu Datta Roy,

 Rajkrishna Kumar Street 

 Food stalls should not be banned 

 at the Book Fair. Thousands visit the fair from distant 

 places and spend several hours on the fairground. Arrangements 

 for their refreshment do not affect the sanctity of the 

 fair.

 Helping hand for torture victims

 DEBASISH CHATTOPADHYAY

 Rabin Basu (name changed), a primary school teacher, was arrested in Jadavpur last year in connection with a bank robbery. He was punched on the face and ribs, and beaten with a baton over his left ankle in police custody. Two left ribs and five right ribs were fractured. 

 Basu was produced in court and remanded in jail custody. However, he soon had to be admitted to the Alipore Central jail hospital in a serious condition. 

 Arfan Sheikh (name changed), a carpenter, was arrested in September last year in Debgram, Naihati, on the northern fringes of the city, for allegedly stealing fish from a local pond. 

 He was sent to Barrackpore jail, where a warder demanded Rs 1,200. As he failed to fork out the amount, he was terrorised and beaten up. The violence affected him so much that even after being released from jail, he refused to interact with people. He had to be taken to a psychologist. 

 Both Basu and Sheikh were looked after by the Centre for Care of Torture Victims, an NGO engaged in providing medical therapy, rehabilitation and legal counsel to torture victims. 

 The NGO is an affiliate of the International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims in Denmark. 

 We visited Basu at Alipore Central jail after the authorities approached us. We made arrangements for his treatment. We heard about Sheikhs case from our sources and went to his house in Naihati several times, said secretary and legal advisor of the NGO Jayjit Ganguly. 

 Most of the members of the NGO are doctors, social workers, and womens and human rights activists.

 We have been working since 1996 to provide relief to those who are tortured in jail or police custody. We also try to help those who are tortured and harassed by their family members. The government is now reluctant to allow us to work in jails, though. In addition to providing medical and psychological relief, we conduct awareness programmes and educational campaigns, Ganguly added.

 The NGO has so far helped about 750 torture victims in the city and the districts. Most of them suffered from fear psychosis, burns and bullet injuries, forcible tooth extraction and orthopaedic problems. 

 The victims are both adults and children. In some cases, even old people are not spared, stated Minakshi Chaudhuri, executive secretary of the NGO. 

 When the victims need economic and social rehabilitation, the organisation tries to put them in touch with other organisations working with such people, she said.

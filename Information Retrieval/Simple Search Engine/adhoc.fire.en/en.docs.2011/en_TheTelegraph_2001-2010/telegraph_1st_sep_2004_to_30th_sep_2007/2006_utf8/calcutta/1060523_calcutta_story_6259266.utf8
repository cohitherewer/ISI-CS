 Hot Shots, Scary Movie, Austin Powers? Add Ghoom to the list. India now has its own parody movie with MTV?s popular comic filler Fully Faltoo going celluloid.

 Come June 2 and Ghoom, a 45-minute spoof of the 2004 Bollywood blockbuster Dhoom (starring Abhishek Bachchan and John Abraham), will release at multiplexes in Mumbai, Calcutta, Delhi and Pune.

 ?We at MTV have been wanting to do this for a long time as a natural evolution of the small vignettes of Fully Faltoo on the small screen,? Ashish Patil, vice-president and general manager, creative and content, MTV Networks India, tells Metro. 

 ?We had initially planned Ghoom as a television film but when we were into our fourth or fifth draft of the screenplay, it got really interesting. Some like-minded partners got on board and we decided to blow it out of the water.?

 With a plot similar to the Yash Raj Production hit, MTV brings in its own sense of quirky humour to make Ghoom a non-stop laugh riot. Directed by Saket Chowdhary, who helms The Great Indian Comedy Show on STAR One, the big-screen spoof stars known TV faces like Sumeet Raghavan (Sarabhai Vs Sarabhai), Ajay Gehi (Milee) and Gaurav Kapoor (Dil Kya Chahta Hai).

 While the cast may not be a patch on the Abhisheks and Johns, MTV has gone for good production qualities. Shot on high-definition video ? the same format Robert Rodriguez used for Sin City ? it plans to use the process of reverse tele-cine to convert the format to 35 mm.

 With INOX multiplexes as one of the partners, Ghoom is assured of a proper release at its properties in the four cities. Says Shrikant Hazare, vice-president marketing of INOX: ?Ghoom is an unprecedented initiative that is sure to create excitement in theatres and we are glad to partner MTV on this.?

 The popular music channel claims that this is only the start. ?We plan to make many such parody movies in the coming months and even make them of feature film length,? assures Patil. ?For Ghoom, we have already planned a proper red carpet premiere here in Mumbai and then a world TV premiere in a few weeks.? Even a DVD release is on the cards after the theatrical screenings.

 And that?s not all. The ?full-on theatrical release? will be supported by round-the-clock trailers on MTV, AXN and Zee. There?s a contest planned with Coca Cola, punning on the punch line ?Thande Ka Tadka? and making it ?Ghoom Ka Tadka?. The winner gets to meet Aishwarya Rai. ?Yes, she will be for real, not a dummy,? promises Patil.

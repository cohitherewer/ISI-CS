 Quixote bow in Bengali

 SEBANTI SARKAR

 The cover of Don Quixote 

 ?Don Quixote is a familiar name in Bengali households, even if few have read Cervantes? book,? said Dibyajyoti Mukherjee, director of Indo-Hispanic Library that has just released the first Indian comic book Don Quixote, in Bengali. 

 The book, appreciated by the Spanish delegates at Calcutta Book Fair, is the city?s tribute on the fourth centenary of the literary classic.

 Very little of Spanish literature gets translated into Bengali or other Indian languages, rued Mukherjee. ?Over the years, Spain has translated so many Indian classics. But we have so little to show. Take Don Quixote, there are several English versions, but I can recall only one other Bengali translation of it,? said Mukherjee, who also teaches Spanish at Ramakrishna Mission (RKM).

 One reason why Indo-Hispanic Library was established was to bridge the gap. Spanish students at RKM and other institutes found a dearth of reading material. The library at 17, Palit Street, which began two years ago, is the only one in Calcutta dealing exclusively in Spanish books and audio-visual material. 

 Thanks to support from the embassies of Cuba, Spain and Chile and various writers, the library boasts over 3,500 titles and an enviable film archive.

 With limited resources, it has undertaken translation projects ? like a collection of the writings of Maria Fernanda Santiago Bolanos and a bilingual version of a book of award-winning children?s writer Antonio R. Almodovar. 

 The comic book initiative began as a student?s project. The black-and-white, 62-page book is priced at Rs 60.

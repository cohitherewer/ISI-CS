The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Oil pumps in strike cry

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta is on the edge of a fuel crisis, with pump-owners deciding not to draw diesel and petrol from the oil companies, starting Thursday midnight.

 The fuel stored in the city petrol pumps is likely to last only a couple of days if the no-purchase protest continues.

 According to the pump-owners, the oil firms are short-changing them by supplying ?only 11,900 litres or less for the price of 12,000?.

 Pumps have to order 12,000 litres of fuel at a time and make the payment in advance. Petrol and diesel are brought in tankers to the pumps and poured into underground wells. ?The flow meter used reads 12,000 litres, but when we measure the volume of oil in the underground well, it reads 100 to 150 litres less,? claimed Petrol Pump Association secretary Joydeep Sarkar.

 An ?understanding between the oil firms and operators of the tankers that deliver fuel to the pumps? causes the shortfall, alleged Sarkar.

 General manager of Indian Oil and coordinator of oil companies Goutam Dutta labelled the allegation ?baseless?, adding: ?Whatever measurement variation is recorded is negligible. The legal metrology department certifies the measuring devices, so there is no chance of any discrepancy.?

 The system of measuring oil is the same all over the country and the petroleum ministry formulates its guidelines, Dutta clarified. ?No oil company can introduce a new and separate system for a state,? he pointed out.

 The rise in fuel prices not being matched by a commensurate increase in commission for petrol pumps is the cause of the dispute, felt industry insiders. The Centre determines the commission for the oil pumps.

 Dutta appealed to the association to call off the strike and suggested that the pumps could send the tankers back to the companies if they carry less than the stipulated quantity of fuel. The pump-owners, however, want to pay the companies after measuring the oil on their own.

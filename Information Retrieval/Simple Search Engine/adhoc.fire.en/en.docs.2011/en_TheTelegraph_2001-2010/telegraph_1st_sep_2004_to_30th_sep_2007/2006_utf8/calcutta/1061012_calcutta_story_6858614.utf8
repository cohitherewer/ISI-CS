 Dengue drive in Salt Lake

 A STAFF REPORTER

 With one of the two dengue patients from Salt Lake being termed critical, the township will witness its first awareness drive against the disease on Thursday.

 Hamola Mondol, a 65-year-old resident of Duttabad, admitted to an HC Block hospital on October 6, was in the critical care unit on Wednesday and her condition was not stable.

 At the same hospital, Subhasish Nath, a 33-year-old resident of Sarat Abasan, adjacent to Kestopur canal, was pronounced out of danger.

 An 11-year-old boy from West Midnapore was admitted to a private nursing home in Salt Lake, but his condition is stated to be stable.

 We are keeping a watch on the situation. All councillors have been asked to start an awareness drive in their wards from Thursday, said Biswajiban Majumdar, chairman of Bidhannagar Municipality. He claimed mosquito repellents are being used since last year, when the first dengue case was detected in Salt Lake, and 10 fog machines were in operation.

 In Calcutta, four more people tested positive for dengue, according to the Indian Council for Medical Research, taking the total to 39.

 Four residents of the Burrabazar area were admitted to a central Calcutta hospital, while a 14-year-old girl was admitted to a private nursing home in Chetla.

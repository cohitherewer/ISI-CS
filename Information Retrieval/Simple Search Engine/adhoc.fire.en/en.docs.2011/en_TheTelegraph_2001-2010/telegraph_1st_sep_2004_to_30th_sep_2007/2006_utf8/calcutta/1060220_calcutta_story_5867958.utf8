The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Crushed by rear wheels of bus

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 After a 68-year-old neurological patient fell victim to two racing buses in Jadavpur on Saturday, it was the turn on Sunday morning of a bus conductor to die under the wheels of the bus on which he served.

 The victim, Shyamal Ghosh, in his early 30s, was a resident of Vidyasagar Colony, in Naktala.

 The accident occurred on Mahim Halder Street, off Basusree cinema, in south Calcutta, around 11.50 am. 

 Conductor Ghosh was outside the rear entrance of a private bus on route 47B, waiting for passengers to get in. 

 After all passengers were inside, the man had just placed his right foot on the footboard, when the bus suddenly surged ahead, leaving him dangling from an iron rod. 

 Within seconds, Ghosh fell off, and even before passengers could raise an alarm, he was crushed by the rear wheels. Witnesses said the driver was in a hurry to race ahead to pick up more passengers on a Sunday morning. 

 ?It happened in a flash, near the intersection of SP Mukherjee Road and Monoharpukur Road,? recounted Partha Sarathi Chatterjee, a passenger. 

 ?The bus was not crowded. The conductor was about to step in when the bus suddenly sped off. The conductor at the first gate had not checked if Ghosh had boarded the bus or not, and rang the bell for the bus to start. Even before anybody could help, Ghosh fell off and it was all over,? he added.

 Ghosh was rushed to SSKM Hospital and he died in the emergency ward even before he could be put on the drip. The driver is absconding and the police have made an appeal to the bus union of route 47 B to provide details about the man.

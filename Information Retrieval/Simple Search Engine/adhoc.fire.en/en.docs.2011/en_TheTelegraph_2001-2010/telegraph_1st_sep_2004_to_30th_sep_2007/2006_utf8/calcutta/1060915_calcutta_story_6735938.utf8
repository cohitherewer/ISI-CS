The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Cops fall for lottery lure

 - Husbands running up huge debts, complain wives

 IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI

 The cops are taking the short cut to riches, even if debts are all they are ending up with. In desperation, their wives are turning to other cops to rein in their husbands.

 Over the past four months, the womens grievance cell of Calcutta Police has received over 50 complaints from wives, accusing their policemen husbands of blowing away their salaries on online lottery tickets. The problem is most prevalent among constables.

 The senior officers are not sure how to deal with the complaints. This is really a matter of concern. A section of policemen is incurring debts by buying online lottery tickets. Their families are writing to us, but what can we do? We are planing to hire a psychiatrist to tackle the problem, a senior IPS officer told Metro.

 Another senior officer of the womens grievance cell, a wing of the detective department, said: We have been receiving complaints from the wives of policemen who have found themselves in dire straits due to online lotteries. Most of the policemen belong to the lower ranks of the force and have run up huge debts in an attempt to get rich overnight.

 She said about 15 such constables against whom complaints had been received were summoned to the Lalbazar police headquarters last month and counselled. Some of the constables had even sold their wives jewellery to buy online lottery tickets.

 Most of them now live in penury, as they have taken hefty loans from several people. The constables have realised their mistake, but it is too late now, added the officer.

 The families of the constables said in their complaints that creditors have started harassing them. The policemen who have run up debts are depressed. They dont know how to repay the loan. It is an embarrassing situation for us, observed another officer. 

 According to psychiatrists, the phenomenon is widespread and disturbing.

 N. Mukherjee, consultant psychiatrist at SSKM Hospital, said: More and more people are buying online lottery tickets. I have come across more than 25 people driven to desperation by it. This is a recent trend in Calcutta and the eastern part of the country.

 Psychiatrist Animesh Dasgupta stated those who come in for counselling are in their mid-30s and early-40s.

 An official of HDFC Bank corroborated the trend.

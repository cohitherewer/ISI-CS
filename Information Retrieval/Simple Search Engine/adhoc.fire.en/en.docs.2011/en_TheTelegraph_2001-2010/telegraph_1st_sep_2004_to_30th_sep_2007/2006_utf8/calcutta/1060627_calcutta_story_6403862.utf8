 Last refuge from debts

 On Sunday evening, Manas Mukhopadhyay had performed the last rites of sister-in-law Gouri and nephew Aritra. On Monday evening, he was back at Nimtala Ghat, this time for the last rites of younger brother Manoj.

 With this ended the tragic suicide pact of the Mukhopadhyay family, that chose death over a life of debt.

 The father, mother and teenaged son had taken poison in a central Calcutta hotel on Friday. While Gouri did not make it to Medical College, Aritra died on Saturday, and Manoj succumbed on Sunday evening. 

 ?After three days, I will return to Santipur tonight,? said a weary Manas.

 But what drove Manoj to the brink of despair and beyond? Friends and acquaintances blamed the tragedy on his ?indiscriminate borrowings? over the past few years.

 For the 53-year-old railway clerk, most of the additional money he was taking home apparently went towards the treatment of his mother-in-law, who was taken ill in 2001 and died three years later of cancer. Wife Gouri was then diagnosed with severe diabetes, causing another drain on the resources. Also, Aritra?s expenses began to rise.

 Manoj first started borrowing small amounts from his colleagues. But it soon added up to a hefty amount, and he sank into a debt trap. Embarrassed to face creditors at work, he started skipping office. He was soon slapped with a showcause.

 ?Gouridi then suddenly opted for a VRS. She said it was for her son,? said an officer at the engineering department of the DRM office in Sealdah.

 Manoj, meanwhile, was approaching everyone for a loan, almost out of habit. ?Of late, Manoj would visit Santipur but never step into our ancestral house. He would borrow money from our acquaintances and leave. More than a month ago, he called up to inquire about us but when I asked about his whereabouts, he hung up,? rued brother Manas.

 With banks and moneylenders hounding him, Manoj even turned to friends from the table tennis fraternity. ?Recently, he requested money for his wife?s arthritis treatment,? said a former table tennis referee. ?I then found out that he had approached many others for money, too.?

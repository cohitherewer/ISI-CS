 What: Wine appreciation 

 evening hosted by Champagne Indage Ltd in association with 

 Calcutta Round Table 41. 

 Where: Princeton Club.

 When: Saturday evening.

 Take a sip: A video clipping showing a man shaking hands with a bottled Chantilli Merlot set the mood for the evening. The enthusiastic crowd was all geared up to sip, savour and satisfy wine queries.

 The session kicked off with wine educator Clive Castelino describing the experience of sipping wine as the greatest pleasure?an experience that needs little knowledge and wisdom to make it enjoyable and worth it. Then it was time for a brief brush with wine history. 

 Clive threw light on table wine, 

 sparkling wine and fortified wine and the various types 

 of grapes used like Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot Noir and more. 

 Also discussed were the important elements of wine-making 

 ? geographical condition, soil, weather, viticulture and 

 vinification. The wine-making process was illustrated through 

 a diagram representation on screen.

 Clive then moved on to some commonly 

 used wine terms. Sample this: Sec means slightly sweet, 

 extra brut means totally dry, balance means all the major 

 components are in harmony, and body describes the weight 

 of the drink in the mouth.

 If all this was historic, geographic and technical knowhow, Clive also stressed on the ideal temperature, the food to accompany each kind of wine, and choosing the right kind of glass. 

 As the evening progressed, Clive demonstrated the art of tasting wine as Ivy-White Zinfandel, Marquise De Pompadour, Chantilli Cabernet Sauvignon and Chantilli Chenin Blanc flowed in the glasses. 

 Voiceover: The best wine is free wine. Enjoy your wine to the hilt, dont let anyone dictate your taste, Clive ended on a lighter note.

 Rakhi riot

 What: Unveiling of a Rakhi collection.

 Where: Shagun Wedding Mall on Shakespeare Sarani.

 When: Tuesday.

 Take a look: Besides displaying a wide range of saris, salwar suits and accessories for the coming festive days, the mall is also offering a stunning range of rakhis. 

 In line with the trends of the season, the rakhis are designed with zardosi, crystals, silver and semi-precious stones. A woman applying mehndi on visitors palms is an added attraction at the mall.

 Pocket pinch: Prices of the rakhis range from Rs 5 to Rs 125.

 Voiceover: Our collection is by far one of the best in the city and our prices are competitive, said Jaydeep Khaitan, promoter of the only wedding mall in town.

To life was a dance-visual montage by Sapphire advocating acceptance of people living with HIV/AIDS.

 The production was staged at the 15th International AIDS Conference in 2004 in Bangkok. The dancers were Sudarshan Chakravorty, director and choreographer, along with Dibyendu Nath and Paromita Saha. Photographs in the background accentuated the performance.

Among them were actresses Chandrani Ghosh and Kamalika Sinha Roy, make-up artist Anirudha Chakladhar, director and co-founder of Sanlaap Indrani Sinha, and project manager of Doctors Without Borders Leena Menghaney.

 This was followed by Tell-a-tale by Rina Gayen, an HIV-positive person who shared the struggle of her life with the audience. Rhythm of Life, a dance performance by Sanlaap that followed, was an exploration of love, sympathy and life in the context of HIV/AIDS a unique effort by a team of trafficked girls who were rehabilitated. Eight-year-old Pompa Sardar was the youngest in the group.

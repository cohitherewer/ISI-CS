 Dolling-up diktat

 His brushstrokes define the looks of the screen sirens, from Kajol to Kareena, from Sush to Ash. Mickey Contractor shares his mantra with Shradha Agarwal

 (From top) Aishwarya Rai flaunts the smoky look in Shabd; Jaya Bachchan looks her glamorous best in Kabhie Khushi Kabhi Gham; Preity Zinta sports the no-make-up look in Kal Ho Naa Ho 

 How does one look like a Mickey Contractor maiden? Excuse me?! was the stunned reply. The voice and style were most unassuming, somewhat shy and modest ? not quite what one had thought when dialling the man whose brushstrokes define the looks of our near-perfect screen idols.

 Kajol, Rani Mukherjee, Aishwarya Rai, Tabu, Preity Zinta, Sushmita Sen? The most beautiful screen faces have been under Mickey Contractors brushes ? all for that one stroke here and one touch there.

 Director of cosmetic major MAC India, Mickey feels that beautiful is anyone who is herself and has a personal style and that clear complexion is a sure pre-requisite for beauty.

 So what role does make-up play in creating those picture-perfect faces? Lots actually, he says. Because you cant really form a whole base on make-up but you can surely lend yourself a distinct personality, an all-new spark. 

 So, heres a host of Mickeys mantras, just for the readers of GoodLife.

 Bare basics

 Mickey believes that he is most famous for his no make-up look, but this, he says, involves more effort than full make-up. Heres the how-to from the guru himself? 

 Choose a foundation that is closest to your skin colour.

 The eye colour should be very neutral ? just enough to help contour and bring out the best.

 No false eyelashes feature in this natural look.

 Use lots of mascara and separate your lashes well, leaving no clumps. 

 Blend the eyeliner well. Very fair skin can also use brown liner. 

 Keep the lip colour natural and pale. 

 The blush ? a shade of peach or pink ? should begin from the apple of your cheeks. Work upwards and outwards.

 Sultry smoky 

 This dark-eyes-and-pale-mouth look is always a winner. Be it Kajols sexy act amongst the pyramids in Kabhie Khushi Kabhi Gham, Aishwarya Rai in Shabd or Rani Mukherjees sultry peepers in Chalte Chalte, the smoky look is always a stunner. Heres the rocking recipe?

 Prepare your face with the right shade of foundation.

 Use darker colours on your eyelids and blend well.

 Line your lower lids with kohl and smudge it with some black eye-shadow. 

 Top off with at least two coats of mascara. 

 Line your lips with a liner and blend well with a pale shade of lipstick, leaving no sharp lines.

 Finish with lots of gloss. 

 Accentuate your cheekbones with a deeper shade of blush. 

 Old is gold

 Remember Jaya Bachchan as the super-glam Ma of K3G and as pretty Jennifer in Kal Ho Naa Ho? Well, who said that moms have to look like Nirupa Roy? After waving his wand on Shah Rukh Khans favourite screen Ma, heres Mickeys advice for the granny divas in the making.

 Choose appropriate skin products and look after your skin regularly.

 Always remember that less is more. 

 Use make-up not as a cover, but as a highlighter of your beauty. 

 Use minimum foundation as it tends to show up the creases and folds.

 Eyebrows form the frame of the face and at this age, they tend to get sparse. Concentrate on them to get the look right. 

 Choose colours for the shadows, liners and lipsticks that suit your personality. 

 Keep with the make-up trends but always re-work them to complement you.

 Perfect points

 The crux of perfecting your art of make-up lies in the finer details, stresses Mickey. Here are some expert tips, to make all the difference.

 Choosing the right foundation is half the beauty battle won.

 Use an eyelash curler to open up the eyes, especially if you put kajal inside your eyes. 

 Understanding your source of light is vital.

 You can use transparent MAC lip glass on your eyelids. Try not to smudge it with liner; stick only to mascara.

 To look dramatic, introduce some colour to highlight and some glitter wherever you are comfortable.

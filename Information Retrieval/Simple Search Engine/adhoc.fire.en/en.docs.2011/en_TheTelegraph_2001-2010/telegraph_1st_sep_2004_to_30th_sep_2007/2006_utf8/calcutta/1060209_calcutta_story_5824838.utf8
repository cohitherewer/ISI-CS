 Adding a twist to an ordinary tale is Rajat Kapoor?s film-making forte. If the bar waiter in Raghu Romeo was obsessed with a TV character who steps into his life, Kapoor?s forthcoming film Mixed Doubles has a bored husband trying out wife swapping to revive the missing spark in his marriage.

 Starring Konkona Sen Sharma and Ranvir Shorey as a couple married for 10 years, along with Koel Purie and the director himself as the couple that injects a sense of sexual tension in their lives, Mixed Doubles is ready for release on February 10.

 ?The film is not about wife swapping. It?s just an aspect in the film. I wanted to make an urban film about a middle-class couple in Mumbai and look at their marriage,? says Kapoor, who auditioned several actors before selecting his lead pair.

 ?The film explores sexuality in a marriage. My character Sunil is a middle-class married guy who loves his family very much. But marriage for him has become a set routine; there?s no spark in it, especially in the bed section. With his middle-class sensibilities he tries to rekindle the spark,? explains Ranvir, who played Manisha Koirala?s lover in Ek Chhoti Si Love Story.

 Mixed Doubles is the first big project for the former Channel [V] VJ who has also dabbled in theatre. Ranvir has worked in two of Kapoor?s stage productions ? C for Clown and The Blue Mug. Next up are supporting roles in Dibakar Banerjee?s Khosla ka Ghosla, Saurabh Shukla?s Aye Dil and Saket Chowdhury?s Pyar Ke Side Effects.

 For Konkona who plays Malti ? ?a regular housewife in her early 30s, has a career and also a kid? ? Mixed Doubles is ?a very mature and dignified film about marriage, with a lot of sense of humour?.

 ?It?s a film about a marriage going stale. About a couple that has been married for 10 years. It?s a comedy about the trials and tribulations of marriage,? says Aparna Sen?s daughter who signed the film because of the script and the director.

 ?I liked Rajat Kapoor?s work ? his film Raghu Romeo and also theatre. His C for Clown I think is one of the best plays I have ever seen. And I also liked the film?s script,? adds Konkona, whose alleged off-screen involvement with her on-screen co-star is the talking point in the run-up to the film?s release.

 ?I don?t want to comment on personal issues. The hero and heroine of a film have often been linked up before a film?s release. This may help in the publicity but ultimately everything depends on whether the film is good or bad, whether people like it or not... But I really enjoyed working with Ranvir,? says she.

 The man in question is more forthcoming about Konkona the co-actor. ?Not just her ease, what I really like about Konkona and her craft is her ability to bring out the finer shades of life,? says Ranvir. And the link-up? ?No comment.?

 Konkona moves on from a contemporary relationship to a Shakespearean tragedy. She starts shooting for Vishal Bhardwaj?s Othello in mid-February. The film starring Ajay Devgan and Kareena Kapoor as Othello and Desdemona will feature her as Iago?s wife Amelia.

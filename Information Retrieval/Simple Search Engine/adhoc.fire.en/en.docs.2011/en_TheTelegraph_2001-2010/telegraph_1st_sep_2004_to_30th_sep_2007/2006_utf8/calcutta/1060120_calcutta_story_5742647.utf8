 Cops cold to threat

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Subrata Hazra: Missing

Subrata Hazra, a Behala trader, went missing two months ago. His family has so far received four threat calls from the ?kidnappers?, but police are yet to come to their aid.

 The last call came on his wife?s cell phone around 3 pm on Tuesday. ?Do not try to look for your husband. Otherwise, you will find only his body,? a man warned Anita. She immediately went to Behala police station and informed officers about the call. 

 ?As on the previous occasions, the officers just listened. They assured me that nothing will happen to my husband and he will return safely. The only action the policemen took was note down the phone number from which the call was made,? recalled Anita.

 When she went back to the police station in the evening to find out if any progress had been made in the case, the officers told her that they had lost the phone number.

 Hazra was a member of a vigilante group formed by residents of Behala?s Rai Bahadur Road. He regularly served as a night guard in the locality.

 The 45-year-old, with a son and a daughter, owned several garages that he had rented out. On November 19 last year, he went for a morning walk and never returned.

 A complaint was filed with Behala police station two days after he went missing. ?The first threat call came within a week of the disappearance. The same man ordered us not to inform the police,? said Anita.

 ?Three more such calls followed. On each occasion, we informed the police, but the officers took our complaints very lightly,? she added.

 The cops said they were doing their best to trace the trader. ?We have already informed the Criminal Investigation Department?s missing persons? squad. What else can we do?? asked an officer of Behala police station.

 ?We cannot bear the tension any more. I have requested the police to do something to bring my lost son back,? said Subrata?s 76-year-old father Chittaranjan. According to him, his son was popular in the locality, but had made some enemies after joining the resistance group. ?He had been threatened several times by local goons,? Chittaranjan stated.

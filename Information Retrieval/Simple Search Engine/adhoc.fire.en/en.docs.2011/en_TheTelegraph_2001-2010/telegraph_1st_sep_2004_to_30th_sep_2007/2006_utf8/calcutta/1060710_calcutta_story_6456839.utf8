The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 One held for gang rape

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Mohammad Jafar, alias Gora, was arrested on Saturday night in connection with the alleged rape of a 17-year-old girl in the port area on Tuesday night.

 Jafar, in his early 30s, was held at his residence in the South Port police station area. The girl identified him as one of the four rapists.

 The men forced the teenager into a taxi while she was taking a stroll near her Belilious Road home, in Howrah, on Tuesday evening. They sped off to an abandoned Calcutta Port Trust quarters before the girl could raise an alarm.

 According to Jafar, two of his acquaintances visited his residence on Tuesday night. ?When I reached the abandoned quarters with them, I saw a girl standing there with another acquaintance. The three entered a room and raped her. I stood outside and heard her cry. I left after the three came out,? he told police. 

 ?We have no reason to believe Jafar?s claim. It seems he was directly involved in the crime,? deputy commissioner of police (port) Rajeev Mishra said on Sunday.

 The hunt for the other three is on, he added.

 Elaborating on Jafar?s arrest, an officer of South Port thana said police had a hunch that the culprits were from the locality. ?They selected the abandoned quarters to commit the crime. Though there are a number of such houses, it is difficult for an outsider to know their exact locations. Besides, no one will dare commit a crime in an unknown area,? he pointed out.

 Civic body washes hands of markets

 In a policy reversal, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has decided not to construct or develop markets. The decision is likely to lead to the abolition of the market department of the civic body.

 The CMC has been constructing, developing and maintaining markets in the city for more than 130 years. New Market was the first market to be developed by the civic body. 

 A close look at the bottom line of the existing municipal markets has prompted mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya to ask municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay to privatise them after renovation under the public-private partnership scheme. 

 The civic body is currently considering proposals to redevelop New Market, College Street Market and Entally Market under the scheme.

 The decision has put a question mark over the takeover of four markets in Garden Reach, Karunamoyee, Shivarampur and Thakurpukur by the CMC. 

 The civic body runs 23 markets in the city. The annual revenue collection from the markets is about Rs 10 crore.

 Told that Section 31 of CMC Act, 1980, imposes an obligatory responsibility on the civic board to construct and develop markets, the mayor said: ?If necessary, we will amend the act to move market development from the list of obligatory activities to the list of discretionary duties.?

 The obligatory clause has outlived its relevance in the era of supermarkets and malls, held the municipal commissioner. The CMC should, instead, invest more in creating infrastructural facilities for better delivery of basic civic amenities to the people, he added. 

 The finance and accounts department of the CMC has welcomed the decision. 

 According to chief of municipal finance and accounts Debotosh Dasgupta, the annual maintenance expenditure of the markets is over Rs 30 crore. If the power bill is included in the expenditure, the annual loss will be enormous. In the civic budget, the power bill is not shown under the market head.

 In New Market alone, said an official of the civic personnel department, there are more sweepers than the average number of sweepers in a ward.

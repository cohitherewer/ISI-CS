The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Trade hub odds see no Left sweep

 ZEESHAN JAWED

 The chances of a Left Front sweep are as remote ? and, therefore, lucrative ? as challenger Sujit Bose toppling champion Subhas Chakraborty.

 If you go by the betting buzz in Burrabazar, that is.

 After Team India?s fortunes against Pakistan and Sandeep Acharya?s chances on Indian Idol 2, the betting machinery in the city?s trade hub is busy putting money on Polls 2006.

 And on election eve, the odds doing the rounds threw up quite a few surprises, the biggest one being the overall seat-share prediction. 

 Contrary to every exit poll, the betting circuit of Burrabazar expects the ruling coalition?s seat count to be between 175 (20:100) and 200 seats (40:100).

 A Left Front sweep of 210 seats would be an upset (200:100) similar to Trinamul?s Bose beating CPM?s Chakraborty at Belgachhia East (200:100).

 Not many in Burrabazar are betting on the ruling coalition improving on its 2001 seat count ? as predicted by the exit polls ? mainly because of high voter turnout in an Election Commission-controlled poll. ?This is an unprecedented scenario in Bengal. This is a free and fair election and these are all genuine voters, With the party cadre not controlling the polls, this election might throw up some surprises for the Left,? a bookie told Metro on phone.

 Burrabazar on Wednesday was abuzz 

 with talk of the polls, but the odds were only being disclosed 

 via the anonymity of cellphones. 

 ?One can only break into the syndicate through strong contacts,? explained a trader on Kalakar Street.

 When contacted, a senior police officer said he had ?heard of? betting picking up on poll-eve, and stepped up vigil.

 Alternate energy sources and proper utilisation of the scarce natural resources dominated the CEO conclave organised by the Indian Institute of Social Welfare and Business Management (IISWBM), on Wednesday.

 The guest of honour at the institute?s annual event, CEO Speak, was the Dutch Ambassador to India, Eric F. ch Niehe, while the chief guest was P.K. Misra, chairman of Ordnance Factory Board.

 ?We need to upgrade technology constantly in order to meet the demands of tomorrow,? said Misra. 

 ?Solar, wind and hydel energy must be developed and utilised. Technology has already shown that solar panels can provide energy that is safe and which can meet the requirements. Most importantly, it is reusable,? Misra added.

 Niehe presented a number of awards to the Indian chapter of the Association of Energy Engineers, which is housed on the IISWBM campus. 

 The Indian chapter was awarded the best international chapter with the overall performance award for 2005 and the best community service award for 2004-05, among others.

 Lauding the association?s achievements, Niehe echoed Misra?s comments. ?It is vital for both the industry and the general populace to understand the extent of the global energy crisis that we are facing today.?

 Niehe said that the Netherlands was well on its way to develop alternate energy sources and suggested that India could follow its lead.

 The ambassador also praised IISWBM ? the first management institute of the country ? for setting up the programme at such a short notice. 

 ?Although I had confirmed my attendance so late, the institute was gracious enough to accommodate me,? he smiled.

 Ashoke K. Dutta, director of IISWBM, said: ?We stand for a number of things, social welfare being a predominant one. Our areas of specialisation include energy and environmental logistics. Energy conservation and proper utilisation is of great concern in today?s world. At IISWBM, we are always on the lookout for reusable energy sources. Sustainability and proper governance is a prime motive for us.?

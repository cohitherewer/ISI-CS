 School code on teachers

 - Transparency the thrust in proposed recruitment rules

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 Christian missionaries have announced that they will set up a uniform set of guidelines to run their schools, especially with regard to recruitment of teachers.

 The 69 founder bodies of the 700-odd missionary schools across the state will soon sit together and discuss how to frame the guidelines, Reverend Sailesh Mukhopadhyay, secretary, Association of Christian Schools, said on Sunday. 

 The main objective is to make the recruitment process transparent, he explained.

 The move follows school education minister Partha Des announcement on Friday that a piece of legislation would be enacted to empower the government to exercise minimum control over all private schools, aided or unaided.

 The government would like to frame the law on the basis of suggestions from the schools themselves to ensure that the minority rights of the missionary institutions are not infringed upon.

 While conveying the governments decision to the missionaries on Friday, minister De had stressed the need for transparency and uniformity in the functioning of their educational institutions.

 At present, the recruitment procedure followed by the missionary schools, including the required minimum qualification for appointment of teachers, is mostly based on the system the government has enforced for state-aided schools.

 The fee structure and admission procedure, however, are different.

 The new set of rules would primarily focus on the recruitment policy. The Christian organisations will decide later whether issues like students fees and admission procedure will be brought within its purview.

 Since the government will frame the law based on our recommendations, the onus will be on the schools to abide by them, said Herod Mullick, general secretary of Bangiya Christiya Pariseba.

 To ensure that the schools comply with the proposals, we need to adopt a uniform system for appointment of teachers, he stressed.

 Father Faustine Brank, secretary of the Parisebas education cell, said: We will give some specific suggestions to the government on the eligibility of our teachers. Apart from the educational qualifications and teaching skills, the teachers must be respectful of the values and the discipline that the missionary schools have been following for decades.

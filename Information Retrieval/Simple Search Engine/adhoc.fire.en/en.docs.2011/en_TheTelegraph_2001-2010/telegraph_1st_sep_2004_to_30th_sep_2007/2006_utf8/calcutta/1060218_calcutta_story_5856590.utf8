 It was selection time once again for Maureen Wadia, the force behind the popular Gladrags contest. In town to scan the walk-ins for Britannia Gladrags Mega Model and Manhunt Contest 2006, the glamorous lady in navy pantsuit looked every bit the star spotter she is.

 Held at Tantra, The Park, the scanning process went on through Thursday afternoon with close to 100 hopefuls making a beeline for the auditions.

 Their numbers increase each year, but sadly, the quality shows hardly any improvement. Though beauties like Koena (Mitra) ? who was a Gladrags Super Model ? have done Bengal very proud, the manhunt has never been won by a contestant from this part of the country, rued Maureen.

 The Calcutta chapter will be followed by similar rounds in Delhi, Bangalore and Mumbai between February 19 and 24, and the results will be announced on March 1. 

 The finalists will then have to go through the Maureen Wadia Survivor Course, a gruelling month-long training programme. 

 They will be groomed to perfection for a month, from March 8 to April 8, said the lady. The finale will be at Spring Mills, Wadala, Mumbai on April 8.

 Talking about the Bollywood dream that every aspiring model nurtures, Maureen had no qualms admitting that the appeal of the film world is far greater than model-dom. I am more than happy to act as an incubator or a stepping stone to the movies, she smiled.

 This generation perpetually stuck to the mirror desperately needs to get over the I-am-the-best syndrome. Modelling is fine, but only for pocket money. Youngsters should get a degree, get a real job and then dream of the stars. This is exactly what John (Abraham) and Dino (Morea) did and see where they are today, added the model maker.

 Stressing the importance of getting a real job, she also announced her plans of launching the Maureen Wadia Academy, a career training and placement agency based in Mumbai.

 Aviation, banking, hospitality, call centre... come March 15, and training courses in all these fields would be conducted by international experts at the academy. Also on the cards are grooming sessions for to-be brides and homemakers.

 Experts will train the youngsters as per their needs. This international exposure will surely help the students, explained Maureen.

 If I can make models legends, then how about making legendary ordinary citizens? smiled Maureen.

 The duration of these courses would vary from two to three months, just right for todays fast-track youth.

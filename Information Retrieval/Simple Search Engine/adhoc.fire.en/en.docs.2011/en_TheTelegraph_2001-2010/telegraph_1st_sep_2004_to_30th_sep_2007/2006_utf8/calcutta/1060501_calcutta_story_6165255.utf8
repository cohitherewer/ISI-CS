 And physics comes alive

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The invitation to the new gallery at Birla Industrial and Technological Museum

 Out of the black-and-white pages of school textbooks and into living colour.

 Fascinating Physics, a 2,700-sq-ft gallery debuts this week at Birla Industrial amp; Technological Museum (BITM) with the aim of making physics come alive for students and the common man alike.

 ?Physics is a branch of science which unravels the mysteries of life. We are trying to capture the entire subject within one gallery,? said Jayanta Sthanapati, director of BITM.

 Major breakthroughs and developments in physics and astronomy since the 17th Century are being chronicled in Fascinating Physics through displays, diorama, interactive models and more.

 ?The gallery has been divided into two sections, classical and modern. Classical has 28 exhibits and covers events up to 1900. Modern takes off from there, with 38 exhibits,? Sthanapati explained.

 Topics touched upon by the classical section include mechanics, gravitation, optics, sound, electromagnetism and thermodynamics, while those in the modern section include X-ray, radioactivity, electronics, cosmology, laser and nuclear energy.

 There are two special enclosures dedicated to Albert Einstein and Indian physics, the latter profiling notable physicists such as C.V. Raman and Meghnad Saha.

 A demonstration room adjacent to the gallery will have live demonstrations of experiments that cannot be carried out in the exhibition area.

 ?We have tried to follow the school curriculum so that students can see some of the things taught in class come alive. The common man will also find the gallery interesting,? Sthanapati added.

 The final section of Fascinating Physics highlights challenges faced by physicists today. These include unification of the forces, unravelling the mysteries of the human mind, gauging how far the universe extends and probing whether there is life in other parts of the universe.

 May 2, when the gallery is scheduled to be inaugurated by Bikash Sinha, director of Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics, happens to be the anniversary of BITM. The museum, the first science and technology museum in the country and the second in Asia, was set up in 1959. 

 ?2009 is our golden jubilee year and we aim at presenting a new BITM to the society with new and updated galleries,? the museum director said.

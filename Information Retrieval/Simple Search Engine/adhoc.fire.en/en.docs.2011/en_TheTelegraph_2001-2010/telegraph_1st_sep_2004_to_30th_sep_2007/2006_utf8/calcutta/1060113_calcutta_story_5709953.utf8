Life

 Snip amp; lounge in style

 The interiors of Bridgette Jones, coming up near Maddox Square 

 After lounge bars and lounge cafes, get ready to step into a lounge salon complete with cool comforts and a cafeteria. By the end of the first month of a new year, Bridgette Jones will be a novel addition to the citys lengthening list of luxury haunts.

 The brainchild of beauty expert Bridgette Jones, the 3,000 sq ft fashion salon for women will be spread over two floors at 78B Sarat Bose Road.

 Right from the furniture to the tiniest hairpin, each and every article in my salon is being imported from China, the hub of the beauty industry that supplies salon equipment to the world. You can say that my whole salon is made in China, smiles Bridgette.

 Add to that her two-month stint with a salon in Gold Coast, Australia, last summer and the experience at this first-of-its-kind beauty stop near Maddox Square promises to be truly global.

 I have not only groomed the entire staff specially for this salon, each girl has been given a makeover for her hairstyle and look so that she portrays the right image of the salon, says Bridgette.

 The place is divided into separate sections ? a nail bar, hair cutting and colouring, shampoo, spa pedicure and kids zone on the ground floor; hair therapy, facial rooms, waxing room, bridal room and the cafe on the first floor.

 The focus of the nail bar is on nail art, with an amazing variety of motifs and colour combinations on offer. Different styles of French manicure are also on the cards. 

 While the speciality of the hair cutting and colouring section are the lounge bucket chairs that offer a relaxing experience, the shampoo beds steal the show in this particular area. The shampoo beds allow you to lie flat on your back while your hair is being washed. This prevents any pressure or stress on the neck that usually happens while shampooing when seated, says Bridgette.

 The special spa pedicure chairs massage the neck and the back during the pedicure, while jets of water caress the feet. The feet are pampered with different types of pedicure like Dead Sea, Rose Petal and Aqua. The small but complete kids station offers the little ones services like mini manicure, mini pedicure and mini facial. Apart from the services, I will educate little girls on the how to take care of their hair, skin and nails from an early age, promises the beautician.

 Done up in fluorescent green and canary yellow, the mood of the ground floor is hip and trendy, in contrast to the serene ambience of the floor above. The decor here is in white and silver, with pink neon lights breaking the monotony.

 The lighting is going to be a speciality of my salon. There are three different types of lights on the ground floor ? spotlights on individual chairs, white daylight and soft green lights. I can change the mood whenever I want by playing around with the lights, says Bridgette.

 The ornate bridal room, done up in shocking pink and gold, is the show-stopper on the first floor. Antique, carved, gold-leaf chairs and mirror frames set the tone here. The idea is to make the bride-to-be feel like a princess and offer her a day to remember for life, smiles Bridgette. 

 In fact, the pampering can start months ahead of D-day. As soon as a bride enrols with me, I will guide her about everything from hair, skin and dental care to body toning and care of hands and feet. Plus, I will help her put together her make-up trousseau, advising her on the colour co-ordination, she assures.

 The other highlight of this floor is the 12-seater cafe that boasts a menu of exotic coffees, herbal teas, homemade cookies and fresh popcorn. 

 A newsboard here will display information of events happening across the city as well as articles on beauty by Bridgette. 

 While the cafe will act as a waiting area offering light bites, we have tied up with a pizza chain that will deliver at the salon if a customer wants to order.

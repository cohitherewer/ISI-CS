 What: Launch of Mezze (Mediterranean restaurant) and Soho (lifestyle kitchen and bar).

 Where: Ideal Plaza, 11/1 Sarat Bose Road (off Minto Park).

 When: December 23, 9 pm.

 Take a look: The bright orange neon lights are bound to catch your eye where Golden Harvest once was. Spread over 5,000 sq ft, the 40-seater Mezze restaurant offers authentic Mediterranean cuisine. Soho has three sections mdash; a kitchen and bar, Soho Deli and Soho Ultra Lounge.

 The bash: The launch party of Mezze and Soho kicked off with a performance by vocalist Penelope from Australia, joined by percussionist Bickram Ghosh in a jamming session. DJ Denzil from Mumbai got the crowd moving in tune with the management rsquo;s idea of being ldquo;strong on performance and music rdquo;. The dance floor was jam-packed with party people till the early hours of Christmas Eve. 

 The spread: The ldquo;slow fine-dine restaurant rdquo; served up exclusive Mediterranean cuisine from Italy to Greece. A lot of food items have been picked to suit the Indian palate like Kebaps (a pure Turkish dish), Tapas and Fondue. The spread also went the Italian way with a buffet including risotto, fricassee and pastas.

 Voiceover: ldquo;We will concentrate on excellent service even on the busiest of nights. Entry into Soho will be exclusively profile-based with sufficient privacy and space that is missing at other lounge-bars in the city, rdquo; promised Vishal Kapur, joint-partner.

 Sporty bash

 What: Polo Ball.

 Where: Terrace Garden, Taj Bengal.

 When: December 25, 8.30 pm.

 Take a look: To celebrate the success of the annual polo season that commenced on December 10, the 144-year-old Calcutta Polo Club, in association with the Fort William Polo Club, organised a grand polo bash on the last day of the tournament.

 Far removed from the overcrowded and boisterous bashes, the candlelight party on Christmas Day made for a gentle evening of quiet conversation and a dinner spread.

 Star trek: The spotlight was firmly on Rajmata Gayatri Devi, who had come down from Jaipur to attend some of the matches, as she walked in escorted by her grandnieces Raima and Riya.

 A picture of elegance and poise, Gayatri Devi took time out to meet and encourage some of the young polo players in the Indian team selected to play World Cup 2007.

 Seated next to parents Moon Moon Sen and Bharat Dev Burman, Raima looked elegant in a Sabyasachi ensemble while Riya sported a backless gown in black. Some others in the guest list included Keshav Bangur, president of the Calcutta Polo Club, Col Tarsem Singh, Brig. Balbir Singh and Major-Gen. P.K. Mehta.

 Commentary from a widescreen display of some polo matches kept most guests engrossed over drinks and dinner.

 Voiceover: ldquo;I was here for the polo season and shall return to Jaipur on Tuesday. It also feels special to see my grandnieces who I rarely meet since they are in Mumbai most of the time, rdquo; Gayatri Devi told GoodLife. 

 Im meeting her after almost two years. We would interact a lot more during our visits to Jaipur when we were quite young. I dont think she watches too many films but I am glad that she saw a bit of my Chokher Bali, smiled Raima.

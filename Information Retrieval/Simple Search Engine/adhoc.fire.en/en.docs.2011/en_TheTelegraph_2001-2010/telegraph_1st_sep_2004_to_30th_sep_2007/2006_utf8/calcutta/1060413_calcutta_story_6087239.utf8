 Disc tribute to Shankar?s true disciple

 SEBANTI SARKAR

 Shanti Bose in a moment from Chitrangada

 He was Kartikeya to Uday Shankar?s Indra during the maestro?s 1968 US tour. The Houston Post had described him as ?Shankar?s heir apparent?.

 For the past 30 years, Shanti Bose has produced, directed and performed various dance compositions all over the world. And this month, Bhavna has paid him tribute with three video compact discs (VCDs) on his renditions of Tagore?s Chandalika, Chitrangada and Tasher Desh. 

 A teacher at Loreto House for many years, the 66-year-old has his own troupe called Nrityangan. 

 Priced at Rs 100-150, the VCDs have songs by Arghya Sen and Debarati Ghosh and readings by Jagannath and Urmimala Basu. The colourful and innovative costumes are by Bose?s danseuse wife Shantana.

 ?In these compositions, elements of Uday Shankar?s dance style combine with folk elements I imbibed during my interactions with the various traditions brought to Calcutta by Jogendra Sundar?s Indian Revival Group. This makes the presentations different from what people are used to,? said Bose.

 Bose began his career at age 16, when Chaitanya Dasgupta of the Jana Natya Manch took him to Panu Pal?s dance classes. ?I never thought of taking up dance in earnest. I actually dreamt of becoming a body-builder,? said Bose. 

 Pal changed all that. Overriding family objections, Bose got hooked to the art form. He joined the Academy of Dance and Music (now Rabindra Bharati) and did a diploma course in Kathakali, Manipuri and Bharatanatyam. NK Shivashankaran, a teacher of the Academy, took Bose to Uday Shankar.

 ?I was left speechless the moment I saw him (Shankar). With such magnetism and beauty, he was like a devdoot. I was honoured the day he allowed me to wear his costume and dance as Kartikeya,? said Bose.

 Bose also functioned as Shankar?s assistant for 13 years, performing in Samanya Kshati, Shankar Scope, Prakiti Anand and other compositions. He also worked as a ballet master of the Academy until he founded Nrityangan in 1969.

 A true disciple of Uday Shankar, Bose is not afraid of changes and novel styles. He is certain that GenX will continue to cherish the beauty of Indian dance forms. ?Young people are coming to me every day, asking for a chance to dance,? he said.

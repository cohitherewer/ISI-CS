 Fare slash to snare tourists

 Sentosa Island, off Singapore, a major tourist draw

 To counter the post-winter holiday slump in tourists, the Singapore Tourism Board and Singapore Airlines have joined hands to come up with a discount package.

 At Rs 12,799 per head, the round-trip offer can be availed of by residents of the major cities between February 1 and April 15. Special gifts and discounts will be the highlights of the package. An online contest has been started for six free tickets to Singapore. 

 ?For the urban sophisticates in India, there is a growing desire, and even need, to take short breaks from their busy routines along with friends and loved ones to reconnect, rejuvenate and pamper themselves,? felt Siew-Kheng Kang, regional director (South Asia, West Asia and Africa) of Singapore Tourism Board.

 He added: ?Many tourists think they know Singapore, but if they look a little bit closer they will find that there is always something new and interesting for discerning visitors to experience and talk about long after their Singapore break is over.? 

 After staying in Singapore for a minimum of two nights, those availing of the offer can fly to Kuala Lumpur or Penang for the same fare or to Bangkok for an additional Rs 1,000 or Bali or Jakarta by paying Rs 5,000 extra. 

 All those visiting Singapore on Singapore Airlines during the promotion period will be entitled to win Rs 12,799-worth of shopping, dining, spa vouchers or discount deals if they deposit their boarding pass at the visitors? centre there.

 ?We are extremely happy to partner Singapore Tourism Board in bringing forth this exciting and unique offer for travellers across India,? stated B.K. Ong, general manager (India), Singapore Airlines. 

 Bookings for the package are open and will continue till February 18, 2006.

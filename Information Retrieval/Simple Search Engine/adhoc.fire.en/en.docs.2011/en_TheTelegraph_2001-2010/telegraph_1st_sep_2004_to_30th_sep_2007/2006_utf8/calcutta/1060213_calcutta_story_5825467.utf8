Life

 Love laws, customised for you

 Mushy cards and red roses aren rsquo;t exactly what the doctor ordered for everyone this Valentine rsquo;s Day. Anumita Ghosh and Shradha Agarwal lay new rules

 Roaming around with a band-aid across your bleeding heart? No love life to be spotted within miles? If your answer to any of these is even slightly tilted towards the positive, chances are even that the sight of red heart-shaped balloons or chocolatey cookies make you despairingly diabetic.

 Relax, the scenes not too rosy on the other side either, because the confused Romeo in and out of love cant really decide which among his bevy of babes he wants to spend the evening with. Neither is it picture perfect for those married couples itching long before reaching the seven-year mark. The fairytale love situation, you see, is most often just that: a fairytale.

 On V-Day eve, GoodLife lays down the laws for various stages of a love life. Track down yours and blast ? or whimper ? your way into February 14.

 Still single? very ready to mingle

 Thats the mixed phase. Happy to have all the freedom to hit on the hottest hunk when he walks through that door, thanking your stars while overlooking your cosy friends spat, but on the flip side, missing that someone special as everyone else passes you holding hands. Hey, shake up. Being single aint that bad! Heres what you can do this February 14, todays Umrao Jaan!

 Keep track of house parties ? you never know the board game that might land you a Prince Charming.

 Blackmail your friends into hooking you up with their other single friends.

 Arrange a naughty bachelors blast or a crazy girls night out, go full blast with drunken bitching.

 An all-night, back-to-back session of soppy romantic flicks. 

 Shop, shop, shop. The bills are bound to make you forget your non-existent love life. 

 Spend the day at the parlour or spa and emerge with those look-at-me looks. You never know who youll bump into.

 Butterflies in the stomach 

 For months its been the eyes that have done the talking and all that the lips have said is Kuch Naa Kaho. Your friends know it too and its just a matter of time and courage that christens your sweet relationship. Movies and ads never failed to inspire any Romeo or Juliet. So get your act together and pick your own proposal plans. Innovations are always welcome for the Bunty in you.

 Go old school ? pop the question with a sparkling ring in the bubbly. (Caution her discreetly, lest it settles in her stomach!)

 Get yourself one of those ways-to-propose books. The ideas are wacky. Surf the Net, many sites are full of them too. 

 Send her an e-card, maybe it will make her less technologically challenged. And you might have to go across to help her. 

 If adventure is more your style, take her for a hot air balloon ride and ask her out for a walk in the clouds.

 Scary movies are also a sure shot way of getting closer. Hold her tight and whisper the magic question. 

 Play a game and con her into saying yes to every question before she realises her affirmation to your proposal. 

 Drowned in each other

 So much mush that your friends and family have dubbed you the poster ? or maybe Jism ? couple around town? Who cares? Everyday is not a Valentines Day, dude. Its a day when only the two of you matter, so complaining characters might as well go jump. Some things are best left traditional. Heres to good ol mush, sprinkled with the latest masala. 

 Long drives to Rajarhat and beyond, take strange turns, indulge in thrilling adventure finding your way back home.

 Spend a bomb at the five-star dinner, champagne, music, candles et al.

 Deliver multiple bouquets of red roses every hour. Ensure that the florist reaches the right hands, not the neighbouring aunty! 

 Hot it up on the dance floor. Insist on mushy, romantic melodies and live it up on tango, salsa and merengue. 

 Just gaze into each others eyes, not the blonde bombshell across the room, till reality strikes hard or boredom hits you.

 Spoilt for choice

 You are a born flirt and flattering other peoples hearts comes easier to you than a straight handshake. Result? Not surprising, your cell phones overflowing with contacts of the opposite sex. The year is spent juggling hot babes/dudes at the tip of your fingers. Alas, Valentines Day is only about 24 hours. One breakfast, a brunch, followed by a grumbling lunch, two-three coffee meets and then thank god, a dinner? all with different dates. Imagine getting caught in a No Entry lane!

 Planning and perfect co-ordination is your essential survival kit. Heres how:

 Fix time slots a week in advance and cook up urgent business meets in the remaining hours. 

 Each date should be booked in a new hangout. You really dont want to deal with the sly waiters grin.

 Make sure you have separate folders for each line. Delete text messages from the common inbox.

 Say the right thing to the right person. Do not fumble the names ? half a slip of tongue and youre history.

 Do not venture anywhere close to risky places ? roads parallel to your other loves homes, neighbourhood or workplace.

 Finances need to be managed exceptionally well. Keep them all super-pleased. The prince image, even if its a shirtless one, always works better than the pauper.

 Retrieving the romance

 If communication through the kids and the maid is all that is left in your relationship, then urgent help is what you need. Some couples face the itch even before tying the knot, so sense it well in time, before the milk of mush is spilt. Take action before you land up spending V-Days alone and not with Mere Jeevan Saathi. 

 Gift yourselves a special spa getaway or a days retreat on the citys outskirts. 

 A jog down memory lane, rewinding your most romantic moments always brings back some lost love. 

 Get inspired by Mixed Doubles? and decide for yourself ? to swap partners or not!

 Introduce lots of us-time. It could be anything from catching a cosy film to reading a book. Chat and flirt like the old days. 

 Make the effort of getting dressed specially for each other. 

 Nothing like a quiet stroll, hand-in-hand into the sunset.

 Just broken up 

 The feelings could be extreme, elated or down in the dumps. Whatever the case, rise, shine and smell the cappuccino. Heres a list of other things you Yuva can do. 

 Keep tissues handy, you are on an emotional roller-coaster ride. 

 Bitching is therapeutic. So feel free to call friends and go all out about your ex. 

 Burn old snaps, cards and empower yourself. 

 Cleanse your system, take a deep breath and detox. 

 Revert to stage one to rediscover the simple joys of being what you want to be.

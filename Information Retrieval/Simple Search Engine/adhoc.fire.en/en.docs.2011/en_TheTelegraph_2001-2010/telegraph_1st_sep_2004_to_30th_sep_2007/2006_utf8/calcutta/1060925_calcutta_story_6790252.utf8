 Ready to roll: Hussain

 Finally after weeks of wait, Nach Baliye 2 is ready to kickstart from Monday. And the road to the on-air show hasnt been easy for any of the couples.

 Hiten Tejwani has been a worried man with wife Gauri losing two kg in one week. Managing shooting schedules and dance rehearsals in the same day have forced a leaner Gauri to actually redo her wardrobe. Hiten is force-feeding her with pav bhaji lest she disappears by the time Nach Baliye finishes. 

 Gurdip and Arjun havent lost weight but have managed to get their choreographers changed within five days of rehearsals. So, exit Jignesh and Nigar and enter Rajeev and Pinky. The couples miseries, however, do not end there with Gurdip going down with stomach infection.

 Ketaki and Rasik Dave are being billed as the dark horse in the race to the Nach Baliye crown. With the oldest couple Sachin and Supriya winning the contest last time, there is a buzz that the senior participants in Ketaki and Rasik may do the trick this time. 

 When they were studying in Jai Hind College, Bakhtyaar and Hussain were touted as the best dancers on the campus and even went on to win several inter-college competitions like Malhar. Now, several years later, they are set to lock horns in Nach Baliye 2.

 Hussains wife Tina is so into her dancing routine that she reportedly sleeps in poses that are very close to her dancing postures. 

 Shweta Tiwaris husband Raja Chaudhary, on the other hand, has been taking dance classes apart from being assigned a choreographer. 

 Unlike last time, this year the couples are so well prepared that it seems only the trained eyes of the judges Saroj Khan, Kunal Kohli and Malaika Arora Khan will be able to pick the best of the lot. Catch all the action on STAR One at 8.30 pm.

 Fergie of the multi-platinum Grammy-winning hip-hop band Black Eyed Peas is on [V] Spotlight this September. And now you can catch an exclusive interview with the steamy singer. 

 Born Stacy Ann Ferguson in California, Fergie first joined the all-girl band Wild Orchid along with Renee Sands and Stefanie Ridel. When the group couldnt survive, Fergie was invited in 2003 by Black Eyed Peas to sing Hey Mama. Her performance was phenomenal and that won her a permanent place in the band as the fourth member. 

 The group went on to create a revolution with the launch of their album Elephunk, which sold almost 7.5 million copies worldwide apart from winning four Grammy nominations and one Grammy award.

 Moving away from the band, Fergie has recently launched her solo album The Dutchess, which features the hit track London Bridge. The song has been ruling the music charts since its release in July. As the song continues to climb the Billboard Top 40 and Rhythmic Top 40 charts, catch Fergie talk about her musical career on Channel [V].

 The singer shares her experience of working with numerous bands and her thoughts and excitement on the launch of The Dutchess. The interview episode comes on Friday at 6 pm.

 The fancy dress competition as part of INOXs (Forum) third birthday celebrations on Sunday morning was one big movie carnival. With filmi being the theme of the day, kids came out in all kinds of Bollywood and Hollywood avatars. There were two categories of participants one for children up to five years of age and the other for kids between six and 12 years. 

 It was fun to see kids coming in as Rani Mukherjees Babli from Bunty Aur Babli and as Madhuri Dixits Chandramukhi from Devdas. The other popular choices were Superman and Spiderman. 

 No film could have been a more fitting tribute to Hrishikesh Mukherjee than Khosla Ka Ghosla. A slice of life, the film has been dedicated to the great writer-editor-director who passed away recently.

 Says actor Anupam Kher: Most film-makers keep saying that they are inspired by Hrishida but dont make films like him at all. Khosla Ka Ghosla is truly his kind of film and we all have decided to dedicate the movie to his memory.

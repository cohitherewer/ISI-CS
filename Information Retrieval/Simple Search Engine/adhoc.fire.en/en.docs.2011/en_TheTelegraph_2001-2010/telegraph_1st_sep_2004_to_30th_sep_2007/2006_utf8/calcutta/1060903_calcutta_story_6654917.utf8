 Nothing makes the blogger blood 

 boil like a ban. Or even the prospect of it. Pakistan skipper 

 Inzamam-ul-Haqs fate hangs in the balance for crossing 

 the boundary line and not coming back for a while while 

 protesting the ball tampering verdict by Darrell Hair 

 at the Oval, prompting fans across the globe to pad up for 

 him on the Net.

 In a post titled ICC: The White 

 Commonwealth at (http://www.cricket.mailliw.com) 

 Will writes: Whatever happened to innocent until proven 

 guilty? If you assume the International Cricket Council 

 to be the court, or the judge, then Pakistan is the party 

 being tried. But without evidence, surely this incident 

 should not have progressed to its current state so quickly? 

 Pakistan hasnt so much been tried as convicted...

 Thyaga (http://thyaga-susmita.blogspot.com), 

 in the same vein, observes: I think Hairs decision reflects 

 more of a policeman attitude rather than of a judge.

 Aditya Nataraja (http://mysorean.blogspot.com) 

 also has a bone to pick with the ICC. I pity those spectators 

 who spent money to watch a cricket match (but) were shown 

 a diplomatic and political match. After two hours of waiting, 

 there was an announcement saying it was the end of play 

 What a pity!

 From the playing fields to the 

 drawing rooms. The online argument against moral policing 

 by government watch this on TV, not that is just as 

 cogent.

 Censorship is telling a man he 

 cant have a steak because a baby cant chew it Uncommon 

 Common Man (http://worldofindia.blogspot.com) uses 

 this Mark Twain epigram to begin his post against the bar 

 on adult content on cable television. He, however, concedes 

 that regulation of television content is a reality in most 

 countries In the US, for instance, broadcast stations are 

 prohibited from airing adult content from 6 am to 10 pm. 

 But then, consumers have a choice of getting adult content 

 by subscribing to several pay channels, which are freely 

 available.

 The government move has stirred 

 Ergos (http://ergosum.wordpress.com) passion deep 

 enough for him to question the Constitutions attempts 

 to codify an unlimited number of rules of behaviour in an 

 infinite number of concrete situations. India is a primitive 

 tribalistic society thats being dragged out kicking and 

 screaming into the light of modern civilisation and it does 

 not know how to deal with the bright lights. So, very often 

 it shuts its eyes in desperate attempts to remain in the 

 darkness that it is so comfortable in. (Sigh) I have 

 got to get out of this place as soon as possible, is his 

 gloomy conclusion.

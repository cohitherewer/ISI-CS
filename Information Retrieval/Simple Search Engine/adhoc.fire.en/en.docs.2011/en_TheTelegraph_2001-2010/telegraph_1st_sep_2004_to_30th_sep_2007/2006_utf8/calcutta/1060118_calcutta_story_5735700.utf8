 Tune trio: The three judges of American Idol

 She?s best known to Indian audiences as Parminder Nagra?s friend in Bend It Like Beckham. But Keira Knightley has indeed come a long way from her days with the ladies? soccer team. From bit roles in blockbusters like Love Actually, Keira has finally come into her own leading from the front in many a Hollywood biggie. 

 Having sparkled as Elizabeth Swann opposite Johnny Depp in Pirates of the Caribbean, Keira is now shooting for the two sequels, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man?s Chest and Pirates of the Caribbean 3. 

 Keira also made a lovely Elizabeth Bennet in Pride and Prejudice but couldn?t win a Golden Globe Best Actress trophy. She?s sure going to have another shot this time at the Oscars in March.

 For all you Keira fans out there, you can catch her in the television premiere of King Arthur this Friday on STAR Movies at 9 pm.

 Sitting pretty: Keira Knightley

 Even as last season?s American Idol winner and runner-up fight it out at the music stores with their debut albums, it?s time for another season of the popular international talent hunt. Starting Wednesday, on STAR World at 8 pm, you can catch the three wise judges ? Simon Cowell, Paula Abdul and Randy Jackson ? choosing the best American voices.

 Last year?s winner Carrie Underwood?s debut single Inside your heaven had shot straight to the top of the Billboard Hot 100 upon release, displacing none other than pop diva Mariah Carey. Runner-up Bo Bice?s version of the same song had peaked at number two, setting the stage for things to come. 

 When Carrie?s album finally released in November last year, Some Hearts sold 315,000 copies, making it the biggest debut album of any artiste since the current system of tabulation was put in place in 1990. Bo?s debut, The Real Thing, didn?t do too badly either selling around 227,000 copies in its first week itself. Second runner-up Vonzell Solomon is still working on her debut album,to be released in March 2006. Carrie and Bo join the likes of Kelly Clarkson and Clay Aiken, some of the most successful American Idol alumni. To watch many such talents evolve from more exhilarating rounds of American Idol, catch the show every Wednesday and Thursday on STAR World.

 Nana Patekar may come across as a short-tempered and trigger-happy person, straight out of a Krantiveer or an Ab Tak Chhappan, but in reality he is an absolute delight to work with. No wonder, all his directors and co-stars find him a very warm and caring person. 

 When Milan Luthria, director of the forthcoming film Taxi No. 9211, went over to Nana?s place in Pune to finalise details about his movie, the veteran actor personally cooked the most tasty mutton dish, in true Maharashtrian style. If that?s not enough, Nana went on to bring warm chapaatis from the kitchen himself while serving Milan lunch. 

 That was the beginning of a great relationship which translated on to the great timing that Nana shares with all his co-stars ? John Abraham, Sonali Kulkarni and Sameera Reddy ? in Taxi No. 9211, slated for release in early February. Now you know the secret recipe of Nana?s screen success.

 SANJAY MANDAL

 A note by Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose will be on display at the SER centenary celebrations

 At 98, Raghunandan Mukhopadhyay is one of the oldest living railway employees. Born in October 1908, Mukhopadhyay retired as superintendent in the office of the chief engineer of Bengal Nagpur Railway (BNR) more than 35 years ago, in October 1969.

 Mukhopadhyay, along with a handful of former employees, including authors and sportspersons, will be felicitated by South Eastern Railway (SER) on April 10 as part of the centenary celebrations of the railway?s headquarters at Garden Reach. 

 The grand edifice used to house the headquarters of the BNR and is known as BNR House.

 Its construction started on April 10, 1906. The building was commissioned a year later, when J. Masson was the agent (equivalent to general manager) of the BNR. More than Rs 7 lakh was spent on the mansion, which is spread over 53,613 sq ft. The structure has been restored to its original form and the authorities are planning to seek heritage status for it. 

 An eight-day exhibition has been organised to mark the centenary. ?The journey from BNR to SER will be captured through pictures and documents,? said Debashish Chanda, chief public relations officer of SER. Besides rare pictures and documents, coins and currencies will also be on show. 

 A note by Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose will occupy pride of place in the exhibition. On March 16, 1940, after a stopover at the refreshment room of the Muri station, Bose wrote: ?I partook of some refreshments? and found them quite good. The service was also satisfactory.?

 Nearly 40 photographs of Gandhiji taken during train rides will also be displayed. Old signalling and telecommunication equipment would put on show to capture the technology evolution over the years.

 SER is taking the help of Eastern Railway (ER) to also hold a philatelic exhibition. The world?s first railway stamp, the first stamp of Indian Railway and thousands of other such rare stamps will part of the show. The stamps had been exhibited during ER?s 150th year celebrations, held a few months? back. 

 Mohammed Mujibullah, heritage assistant of ER, has collected about 12,000 of the stamps. The first stamp on the railways, published in 1866 in New Bronwitch, Canada, is part of the set.

 Theres something about her 

 MERYL STREEP plays the acid-tongued 

 fashion editor in The Devil Wears Prada, currently 

 showing on city screens. And she has a lot to say about being 

 Miranda

 With wit, humour and perfectly 

 pitched sarcasm, she is the boss from hell. Miranda Priestly 

 appears tyrannical and Machiavellian, but is also a lonely 

 woman, who lives for her career. 

 For three decades, Meryl Streep 

 has been synonymous with cinematic excellence. Now she brings 

 her consummate skills to her latest film, broadly based 

 on the internationally best-selling novel by Lauren Weisberger. 

 Quite simply, her role as the acerbic fashion editor is 

 destined for immortality. This is what Meryl has to say 

 about the film.

 How interested are you in this world of fashion?

 I dont have very much interest 

 in trends and fashions. I dont follow the fashion shows 

 and stuff like that in my real life. But Im very, very 

 interested in how people put themselves together, how women 

 and men announce themselves to the world, through what they 

 put on their bodies. Whether we choose Birkenstocks or whether 

 we choose Burberry it all signifies something and its 

 really interesting to me. So costume, and what that brings 

 to a character, is what Im really interested in. But I 

 am not necessarily interested in the finer points of design.

 What is your view on your character Miranda?

 I wish that she could take more 

 deep enjoyment from her life, but maybe its not in her 

 physical, emotional and mental make-up to enjoy life the 

 way that I like to enjoy my own life. One of the things 

 that I admire about her is her willingness to just say directly 

 what she wants, and she has an expectation that she will 

 get it. That is not viewed in our society as an attractive 

 quality in a woman sometimes. People are very intolerant 

 of it. 

 Did you know much about the fashion business?

 I didnt know very much at all 

 and I certainly had no idea before making the film. I learned 

 a lot about global branding and the larger corporate entities 

 that rule the fashion world, as well as the different fashion 

 houses and the necessities of getting advertisers and pleasing 

 them. But I didnt do deep, deep, deep research. It is interesting 

 how fashion filters down and we discover in the film that 

 were all prey to trends, even if we think we are not. In 

 one scene, Miranda tells Andy how it all filters down from 

 a great creative designer and how it all works. Some people 

 hold themselves above the fashion business but are still 

 complicit and fall prey to it.

 How do you feel about that and the pressure that girls feel 

 of getting into a size zero?

 I just think that were all trying 

 to make ourselves emaciated, in order to pretend that were 

 all disappearing, as we move forward in every level of society, 

 and its so frightening. This is all a big reaction to the 

 fact that there are more women in medical school than there 

 are men now and I am pretty sure it will be the same soon 

 in law schools and in business. I think this is all compensatory. 

 And I think for girls it is really horrible to be 13 years 

 old at the moment, its really tough. Its much tougher 

 than when I was growing up and felt burdened by the images 

 of Seventeen magazine. I did feel that maybe I should 

 try to look like that. I think these things are very destructive.

 You lost weight during filming...

 I did lose a few pounds, I think 

 that was just anxiety. There was a lot of anxiety in this 

 character. Everybody says: Was it fun to play a villain? 

 No. It was not fun to be in this persons body, it just 

 wasnt at all. So, maybe I took the pressures that she felt, 

 too much to heart. But I felt that was in the plot. I read 

 the script and I read that there was pressure to replace 

 her in her job as editor. And I know how replaceable middle-aged 

 women are in our society and I felt that and so it wasnt 

 enjoyable to be her. It was hard work dressing like that 

 too, I felt like I was wearing or putting on underwater 

 gear. I guess a normal woman would find it extremely enjoyable 

 to wear those clothes. For me, I didnt enjoy it. It felt 

 like a straight jacket.

 Did that make the role less interesting for you?

 Well, I thought she was funny 

 sometimes. In one scene when she said, What happened to 

 my coffee? Has she died? If I were an assistant in that 

 office I would have laughed. But they didnt laugh because 

 they were all so afraid of her. That is something that I 

 do understand from being a movie star. People tremble a 

 little bit when they are around you. And then if you ask 

 for coffee on the set, the request goes down the line, the 

 chain of command through several layers of people.

 What was the particular challenge of this role? 

 Well a great deal of it was similar 

 to a film I made very early in my career, Kramer Vs Kramer. 

 In that film, the audience also judges my character very 

 harshly right off the bat, right from the start. Boom! Theyve 

 decided. Bitch. And then the challenge with both characters 

 is to find the humanity in there. What is the side thats 

 hidden? Whats the side you dont know about? Whats the 

 side youre not privileged to see? And so that was the challenge 

 of it.

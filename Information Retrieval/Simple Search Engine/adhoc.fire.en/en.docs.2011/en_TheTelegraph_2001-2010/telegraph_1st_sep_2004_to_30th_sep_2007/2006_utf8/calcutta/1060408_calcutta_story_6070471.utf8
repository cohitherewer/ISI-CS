What: 

 Andarer Atisajja, an interior decor workshop organised by 

 Sananda in association with Cocoon.

 Where: At Cocoon, the lifestyle store at 28/2, Shakespeare Sarani.

 When: April 7, from 2 pm to 4 pm.

 The panel: Actress June, interior designer Debjani Chatterjee and Feng Shui expert Sweety Arora.

 The workshop: Over 30 eager participants latched on to every word the experts uttered. 

 The workshop began with June discussing the joys of a comfortable, lived-in home and went on to practical decor tips from Debjani before the finale from Sweety on how to create the right energy through Feng Shui.

 June shared her experience of designing her 1,300 sq ft apartment and described the hazards of too much decor. She stressed the wonders of using family photographs to add a personal touch: 

 I have dedicated one entire wall to some of my most memorable snapshots in black and white?

 Debjani then made a presentation of her work. The focus of her discussion was the common problem of designing smaller spaces. 

 The thumb rule in such cases is to avoid the use of loud colours, she explained. 

 Debjani also offered solutions to everything from how to design a reading corner to how to use old brass vessels in the drawing room.

 Sweety discussed the eight directions in Feng Shui and then presented a slide show depicting some common Feng Shui products and their usage.

 The afternoon was rounded off with a fun Feng Shui quiz with five prizes up for grabs.

 Voiceover: Cocoon sets a standard for lifestyle products, hence an informative workshop like this is always a pleasure to host, smiled Ajay Rawla, proprietor of Cocoon.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Out-of-town GenX jazzes up nights

 SHRADHA AGARWAL

 They are home for the holidays, spending the days with family and living it up with friends by night. In doing so, they are sending the bar orders somersaulting, the average billing soaring and the otherwise dull party mood in the first week of the year rocking.

 Gin and tonic over Bacardi with coke; ?long drinks? over quick shots; a Rs 1,500 bill over Rs 500 ? all in the first 10 days of January ?06.

 The non-resident young Calcuttan ? taking a break from studies or internship ? is packing the bars and lounges on what would otherwise have been lull nights.

 ?These out-of-town youngsters comprise no less than 60 per cent of the footfall this week,? says Sovan Mukherjee, manager of Shisha.

 All between 20 and 25 years of age, they divide the few days they have in town between family commitments and party priorities.

 ?There?s nowhere else to go in Calcutta at night. House parties are too cumbersome. Clubbing with friends after spending the day with parents works out just fine,? says Saharsh Parekh, a first-year student from Chicago.

 For Amitesh Ray, now studying in Bangalore, it?s the time not just to disco but to catch up with friends. ?It?s reunion time while checking out the city?s new night spots.?

 And the party haunts sure aren?t complaining. ?If an average Calcutta youngster spends Rs 500 per night, these guys dish out at Rs 1,500,? reveals Ravdeep Singh, club manager, B.E.D. Not surprising, adds Singh, considering many of them save in dollars or pounds.

 The DJs don?t mind the chime of change, either. ?Say a hip-hop number that my regulars would refuse to listen to earlier is now a rage because their visiting friends rave about it,? smiles DJ Girish, adding that the musical menu for these nights is ?more international?, with some Bollywood bests, to suit the ?outsiders?.

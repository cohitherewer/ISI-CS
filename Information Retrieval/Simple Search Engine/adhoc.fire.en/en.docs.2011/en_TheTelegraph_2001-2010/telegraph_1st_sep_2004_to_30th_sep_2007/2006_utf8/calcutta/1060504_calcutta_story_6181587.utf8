 It's Your Birthday So...

 You 

 have talent; don?t let obstacles and the demands of everyday 

 life interfere with your growth. You are spiritual and possess 

 a charming sense of humour. You are understanding and forgiving. 

 You treat others as inspiration rather than competition.You 

 always learn from the past. ? Kusum Bhandari

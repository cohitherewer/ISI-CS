 Gang war leaves two shot

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Two criminals were seriously injured after a shootout inside the Gobra graveyard, in the eastern suburban division of the city, on Friday.

 Police said six goons led by Shabbir Ahmed, alias Ullu Raju, wanted in several cases, entered the Gobra graveyard around 1.45 pm and started firing at Akhtar, also wanted in a number of extortion cases, and his accomplice Salam. 

 Deputy commissioner (eastern suburban division) P.S. Ghosh said: ?The shootout was an outcome of their gang rivalry. We have identified the five criminals led by Raju. The search is on to net them.?

 Just after the Friday namaaz, when people had assembled at the graveyard to offer prayers, Raju and his associates ? Nasimul Haque, Bachcha Sona, Kamal, Majid and Aslam, all armed with revolvers and pipe guns ? started firing at Akhtar and Salam. 

 Akhtar sustained four bullet injuries on his chest, while Salam was hit once in the abdomen. Both were admitted to CMRI Hospital.

 ?Akhtar was part of Raju?s gang. But a few years ago, he broke away to form his own gang and this led to the shootout, ? an officer in Topsia police station said.

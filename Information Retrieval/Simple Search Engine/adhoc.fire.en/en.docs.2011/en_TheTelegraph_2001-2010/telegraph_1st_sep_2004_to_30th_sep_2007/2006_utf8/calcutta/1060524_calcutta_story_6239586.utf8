 Rs 1,000-cr budget for civic body

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 The first Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) budget by mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya is set to cross the Rs 1,000-crore mark.

 In a preparatory meeting last week, Bhattacharyya told municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay and municipal finance and accounts chief Debotosh Dasgupta that the civic budget for a city like Calcutta cannot be less than Rs 1,000 crore.

 The civic finance department, hence, is preparing an ambitious budget for 2006-07. It will be presented for ratification in the civic House in the second week of June.

 The CMC is now in a comfortable position financially. The total tax and non-tax revenue earned by the civic body has gone up by 10 per cent in the current year, compared with 2004-05, according to a finance officer. 

 The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, he said, has planned to spend over Rs 6,500 crore in the current year (2006-07), while the expenditure plan of Delhi Municipal Corporation for the same period is over Rs 5,000 crore. 

 The official pointed out that the Mumbai budget consists of four sub-budgets, since the civic body there operates buses, generates power, provides water supply and looks after drainage, while Delhi, being the Capital, is blessed with generous central grants. 

 The city civic budget crossing the Rs 1,000-crore mark is a major development, he felt. 

 The thrust of the budget will be on slum development and tackling waterlogging during the monsoon.

 The mayor plans to upgrade slums into housing estates for the poor. The budget will propose an amendment in the Thika Tenancy Act, since it is perceived as a stumbling block to developing slums. 

 The budget will stress on the makeover of the city under the public-private participation scheme. Markets, schools, maternity homes, chest clinics and community halls are likely to be covered by the programme.

 The Left Front civic board will also strive to reintroduce water tax, which was introduced by the Trinamul Congress-BJP board and withdrawn subsequently. 

 This time, the Left Front board is likely to link the charges for filtered water with the ferrule size. 

 The previous board had tagged water charges with the amount of property tax.

 The other highlights of the budget are likely to be:

 E-connectivity and video conferencing between the civic 

 headquarters and the outlying offices

 Mastic asphalt topcoat on more city roads 

 Ban on billboards in the Dalhousie-Esplanade-Maidan 

 area and along waterbodies

 Publication of a Citizens? Charter

 Power audit.

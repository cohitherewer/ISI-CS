The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Left sway, 

 Lifebuoy way

 Shiloo Chattopadhyay

 The 

 battle is over. This is the best time to look back, analyse 

 and learn from hindsight. All analyses of Election 2006 

 will have a political focus. There obviously can be other 

 points of view from which this election and its results 

 can be examined. Many for example believe that electioneering 

 is no different from marketing of other consumer products. 

 Both attempt to engineer perceptions to evoke a specific 

 behaviour. More importantly, both have brands, their positioning 

 and promises.

 As we discussed a few weeks back 

 in Ad Lib, the Left Front has created a brand variant. 

 The main brand continued to focus on the rural electorate. 

 For you and me, the new Brand Buddha was created. It is 

 adorned by flyovers and shopping malls, Sector V and multiplexes. 

 The brand proposition at one level was the same. They were 

 both selling hope. What was intelligently tweaked was the 

 differential translation of hope for the two constituencies.

 Targeting the extremes of a market 

 with the same brand name is not very common even in the 

 world of soaps and shampoos. Given the dissimilarity of 

 targets in such situations the manifestations of the brand 

 need to be very different. That entails a risk. Contamination 

 could tax the consumer trust on the brand. If that affects 

 the mother brand then all hell could break loose.

 That is what makes the similarity 

 with Lifebuoy interesting. Remember the original Lifebuoy 

 ? a hexagonal cake of maroon red colour with a very plebeian 

 appearance. It is one of the largest selling soaps in the 

 country. The consumer base is very male, very downmarket 

 and traditional. Its core promise is health. As its jingle 

 says: health is wherever Lifebuoy is.

 A few years back Hindustan Lever, 

 much like the Left Front in Bengal, decided to exploit this 

 huge property of Lifebuoy in an urban upmarket environment. 

 Lifebuoy Plus was launched. The target group was the early 

 teen, female and contemporary. It had the original health 

 platform as the core value. For the new target health was 

 given an anti-pimple incarnation.

 The similarity of the Lifebuoy 

 strategy with the recent game plan of the Left Front is 

 striking. The health platform is replaced by the hope platform. 

 Everything else is virtually the same. Left Front?s Lifebuoy 

 Plus is Brand Buddha. What has been the end result? The 

 original Lifebuoy, like the previous six times, has won 

 handsomely. Most have attributed the success of Lifebuoy 

 to Lifebuoy Plus, or in other words the resounding victory 

 of the Left Front to Brand Buddha. That conclusion, however 

 popular, begs a review. The promise of Brand Buddha was 

 industrial resurgence, growth of high- tech sectors, elevating 

 Calcutta to the pedestal of Shanghai etc etc. Very urban, 

 very metropolitan brand promises. The target was clearly 

 in focus.

 Now witness the results. Alipore 

 and Chowringhee, arguably two of the richest constituencies 

 of the state, did not elect a Buddha protege. Ballygunge 

 and Rashbehari, where many of the elite Calcuttans live, 

 have still not been won over. Saying that these have always 

 been Opposition strongholds is restating the point. The 

 anti-pimple soap was created specifically to break the metropolitan 

 strongholds of the Opposition. That has not happened yet.

 Maybe that is because too little 

 time has been given to Brand Buddha. Or maybe the symbols 

 of hope that brand Buddha have constructed looked too remote 

 from the bottom of the pyramid of metropolitan voters. Maybe 

 in that segment, the contradiction between the fancy anti-pimple 

 platform and the basic health soap is straining credibility. 

 These are still enigmas. What is not is that this marketing 

 game is yet to be won. Or lost.

 The state government?s infotech thrust has got a green boost, with an upcoming IT park in Sector V putting Calcutta on the global map through its commitment to indoor air quality, energy conservation and waste and water management.

 Technopolis, the 675,000-sq-ft integrated intelligent infrastructure, scheduled to be ready in June, will be the ?first green IT park in the world? to be registered under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change as a clean development mechanism (CDM) project.

 Speaking at the announcement of the achievement on Sunday, state IT and environment minister Manab Mukherjee said: ?This gives me 200 per cent satisfaction, since Technopolis is a sincere effort, not only of an international-standard IT infrastructure, but also a very good example of sustainable development.? The minister also declared global IT giant Cap Gemini will soon set up shop in Sector V.

 India?s first LEED (Leadership in Energy amp; Environmental Design)-certified IT project, designed and developed according to guidelines laid down by the US Green Building Council, Technopolis has achieved a 35.57 per cent saving in energy consumption, as measured by the simulation system.

 This contributes to an indirect reduction in emission of greenhouse gases (GHG) into the atmosphere, making the project eligible to earn ?carbon credits? it can trade. 

 ?Technopolis will save Rs 4.35 crore on energy bills every year and earn around Rs 75 lakh from carbon trading, resulting in an additional income of Rs 50 crore over 10 years,? stressed Rahul Saraf, director, Phoenix Software Ltd, developer of the project.

 CDM is a flexible mechanism in the Kyoto Protocol, which allows industrialised countries with emission reduction commitments to procure certified emission reductions (CERs) from eco-friendly, development-oriented projects, which reduce GHG emissions.

 Emissions trading is an administrative approach used to reduce the cost of pollution control by providing economic incentives for achieving emission reductions. Calculated in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e), it is one of the ways countries can meet their obligations under the Kyoto Protocol to reduce emission and address global warming.

 ?By saving 2MW of power, we are in a position to earn CERs. But the biggest achievement of Technopolis has been demystifying the concept of green buildings. Income from carbon credit will act as an added incentive for real estate developers to look at energy conservation more seriously,? said Saraf.

Life

 She would look best in a bikini

 Whether on the beach 

 or on the ramp, the bikini has always spelt sexual liberation. 

 On the 60th birthday of the atom bomb of fashion, 

 GoodLife asks a few men to fantasise 

 Rohit Roy, TV actor 

 My award for the most beautiful woman in a bikini would go to Halle Berry. Sophia Loren wouldnt have been a bad choice either, but in the end, Halle wins by a slim margin.

 I would love to see Aishwarya Rai in a bikini. Im sure she would look very graceful and sensuous at the same time. Besides, this constant speculation about whether or not shell wear one makes it all the more intriguing.

 I would also like to see Jessica 

 Alba in a bikini because shes not just pretty and 

 sexy; she has great quality. I think shed be the perfect 

 mannequin for a bikini.

 Prahlad Kakkar, ad guru 

 If it were not the girls at my 

 scuba diving school in Lakshadweep, it has to be Kamal Sidhu. 

 She has just the right statistics and spunk to carry off 

 a bikini. Very few women can carry off a bikini well. The 

 girls in the Kingfisher calendar 2006 look quite hot, too. 

 Yana Gupta is undoubtedly a scorcher in a bikini. Brad Pitts 

 latest arm candy Angelina Jolie also looks good in a bikini. 

 Though Ive seen her sporting a bikini in the movies, 

 I would kill to see her in flesh and blood and, of course, 

 in a bikini.

 Aditya Bal, model 

 Halle Berry in Die Another Day looked ravishing in a bikini and she has been my favourite woman in a bikini since then. No other actress has ever been able to match up to that look.

 If theres one woman I would 

 love to see in a bikini, it has to be Aishwarya Rai . Going 

 by her attitude, I dont think she ever intends to 

 wear one and the very idea makes it all the more interesting. 

 There have been media reports claiming that shed be 

 spotted in a bikini in Dhoom 2 and I am looking forward 

 to it.

 Rahul Khanna, actor 

 Ursula Andress coming out of the 

 ocean in that famous white bikini in Dr No is one 

 of the timeless images of a woman in a bikini. She has always 

 been my favourite woman in a bikini, even after all the 

 Bond movies and sexy heroines after her. 

 When it comes to my fantasy, I 

 would love to see supermodel Gisele Bundchen in a bikini. 

 I think she has the right curves and would be able to flaunt 

 a bikini with great ease.

 Sabyasachi Mukherjee, fashion 

 designer 

 Zeenat Aman and Dimple Kapadia 

 are two of my favourite women in bikinis. Though there are 

 many other models and actresses who have made a splash in 

 bikinis over the years, the images of Zeenat Aman in Qurbani 

 and Dimple Kapadia in Bobby have stayed on with me 

 till today. I would love to see Salma Hayek in a bikini. 

 Other than being curvaceous, she has the perfect attitude 

 to carry off a bikini very well.

 Akshay Kapoor, actor 

 Salma Hayek is my woman of choice when it comes to a bikini. Though she doesnt have an hourglass figure or a perfect body, she has immense confidence and looks very comfortable in any outfit she wears. Besides, she has got the curves in the right places.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 In-built safety kit for highrises

 Gopal Bhattacharya, director of 

 West Bengal Fire Services, met readers of The Telegraph 

 and answered their queries. Participants included Sushmita 

 Roy, Swapan Banerjee, Tapan Talukdar, Tarit Basu, Jagannath 

 Datta, Shashi Damani, Sandip Chakraborty and Talat Shalahuddin.

Sushmita Roy: A lot of towers and highrises have come up in our city. Is your department equipped in case of a fire in these highrises? Are you taking any special measures?

 Following an amendment of the West Bengal Fire Services Act in 1996, it is mandatory for every builder of any highrise, more than 14.5 metres, to get a no-objection certificate from the fire brigade before getting his construction plan sanctioned by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC). 

 Yet, fire accidents are quite common. However, if buildings are constructed with an in-built fire safety mechanism, then the possibility of a fire is minimised to some extent. If at all a fire breaks out, it can be controlled before it turns into a conflagration.

 Recently during my visit to Singapore, I scrutinised the fire-fighting mechanism in the highrises there. Singapore has a lot of highrises and due to their precautionary measures, there has been no major fire there in the recent past. 

 The difference lies in the outlook of the builders, promoters and developers in India and Singapore.

 The Singapore authorities have laid stress on the installation of proper fire-protection systems. The builders and promoters have a positive mindset and they dont try to dodge the fire-safety norms imposed by the authorities. 

 I wish that promoters here, too, develop a similar kind of mindset. Lack of awareness among the promoters and people also accounts for some of the accidents.

Swapan Banerjee: What are your plans to improve the performance of your department? 

 I feel a mass awareness programme regarding dos and donts during a fire incident is the need of the hour. We believe that prevention is better then cure. Barring a handful of cases, most fire incidents occur due to negligence, indifference or lack of knowledge among people. If you dont maintain the fire system mechanism in your building regularly, if you throw burning cigarettes here and there and a fire occurs, who is responsible? 

 We are always trying to provide you with our best services, but peoples participation is equally important and is required. 

 In many cases, we find local youths playing a great role in preventing a fire. Such an attitude should prevail among all of us. 

Tapan Talukdar: It is often found that even for a small fire incident, more than one or two fire engines from different stations come in. Tenders even come in after the fire is put out. Why are so many fire tenders pressed into service for a single job? 

 Basically, it is quite difficult to estimate how big a fire is from a mere call. So, we dont take any chance and send in a good amount of fire tenders. Also, it is possible that the nearest fire station, which attends the fire first, doesnt have the logistic support to douse the flames. So, we inform other fire stations to send in tenders to augment the logistic support.

Tarit Basu: We frequently read news reports about portions of old buildings caving in. Many are injured and some even die in such incidents. As your officers are first to reach the spot, why dont you pull down the unsafe portions of such old buildings in advance?

 It is under the jurisdiction of the CMC. They regularly slap notices on the owners of such buildings, asking them either to repair the structures or pull them down. In Calcutta, most of these buildings are either occupied by very old tenants, who pay abnormally low rent, or the buildings are under litigation.

Jagannath Datta: What is the biggest problem that your department is facing currently? 

 The biggest problem right now is shortage of water. Waterbodies are being filled up and brass couplings of the hydrants are being stolen. At times, we face a serious shortage of water in case of a big fire. 

Talat Shalahuddin: While dousing flames, can you prevent someone from entering his own shop or house?

 When we attend to a fire in any building, market or factory, at that point of time, the building is under our control. We need not take permission before entering somebodys house or shop. And similarly, we can also prevent people from entering their house during our exercise.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Time to score a Perfect 10

 Set to play as many characters in his next Tamil film, KAMAL HAASAN tells Pratim D. Gupta that movies still need to be content-savvy and not just high on technique

 Kamal Haasan browsing at Cinema Paradiso on Tuesday

 Suddenly stopped in his stride, he?s asked to pose for the flashbulbs. Just before flashing that trademark smile, he takes a swift glance at the backdrop. It turns out to be the poster of Mr amp; Mrs Smith, with that famous flash of an Angelina Jolie leg. Not liking what he sees, he moves two steps to position himself below the poster of Kieslowski?s Bleu (part of Three Colours Blue) with a rather grim looking Juliette Binoche.

 With a lesser screen idol this might have been a self-conscious act worth a snigger, but with Kamal Haasan, this slight adjustment seems to just add to his charisma.

 In cream-coloured check shirt and matching jeans, the southern matinee idol made his way through the dead and dyed Calcutta streets on Holi afternoon, and was dot on time for the launch of the city branch of the DVD rental library Cinema Paradiso at 33B Rowland Road. 

 Asked why he had picked such a holiday to make it to ?one of his favourite cities? after ?almost six-seven years?, Kamal quipped: ?You don?t have to smear colours to celebrate a day, you can make everyday colourful.?

 And that?s exactly what he did, taking a tour of the new video library, stopping and checking out certain titles and punctuating the tour with valuable suggestions.

 ?I have a home theatre system at home and around 1,000 DVDs of my own? I started making my own library long before formal lending libraries came into being. I used to get all my movies from abroad. When I used to return from my foreign trips, the customs people would take me to be a smuggler as I would be carrying 50 to 100 film titles. I used to get away with my excuse ? I love watching films,? he recounted in that rasping voice.

 His hunt for rare DVDs is still on. ?I would like to keep all of Ray?s films with me,? announced Kamal. ?I may like to watch a Sonar Kella or a Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne at a certain time. Now, it?s very difficult to get hold of these titles in the south. You also can?t rely on television to beam them. Also, what film I want to watch will depend on my mood, on the growth of my mind, rather than a TV channel. If I want to watch Ray one day, it doesn?t mean I don?t like Kurosawa.?

 Kamal?s regard for Ray was all too evident with the master?s name popping up every few minutes into the chat. ?Without Ray, we don?t graduate,? he smiled. ?I am also a great fan of Mr (Ritwik) Ghatak and had the rare opportunity of watching him work, even if it was from some distance. I also admire Mr (Mrinal) Sen?s work. The profile of Bengali cinema used to be so much better than what it is now. I don?t watch Bengali films these days. I did watch parts of Chokher Bali, since it was made by my friend, Mr (Rituparno) Ghosh.?

 While he is happy with the quality of Tamil films, Kamal wants the home entertainment market to grow properly. ?The Hindi films are released on DVDs and packaged very properly but down south they do not give much importance to home viewing? There are two types of audiences ? one that watches films at theatres and the other that prefers to watch films at home. We must reach out to these customers at home and make piracy redundant.?

 Talking about his own movies, Kamal revealed plans of his next directorial project by the end of the year. ?At the moment I am awaiting the release of a Tamil film in April called Vettaiyadu Vilayadu. Then I will start work on a film called Dashavatharam. As the name suggests, I will be playing 10 roles in it. Apart from hogging footage, I have an interesting job in the film as a writer. We are getting the technicians who worked on Peter Jackson?s King Kong to do special effects for the film.?

 In the same vein, Kamal insisted that films need not be hi-tech. ?They should be content savvy, something Bengali cinema has been very good in,? he elaborated.

 ?Most of the European films are made with one-tenth the budget of American films but sometimes they make better cinema. Hollywood should not necessarily be the Mecca of movies.?

 Before taking his leave, Kamal didn?t forget to board the time machine to return to the Calcutta he had captured on celluloid. ?I shot portions of Hey Ram here but much before that I had come to shoot a Tamil film called Mahanadhim about the kids in Sonagachhi. It was, what you can say, an earlier Born Into Brothels.? The characteristic wry grin was, of course, right in place.

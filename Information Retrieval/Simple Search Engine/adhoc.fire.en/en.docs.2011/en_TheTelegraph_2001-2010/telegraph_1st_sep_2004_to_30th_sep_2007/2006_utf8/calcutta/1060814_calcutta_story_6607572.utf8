 Triple gain for healthcare

 - Two new clinics and neuroscience unit

 SANJAY MANDAL

 Private healthcare in Calcutta is set for a boost with the roll-out of two hospitals and a super-speciality neuroscience unit. 

 Neon Healthcare and Research Institute will build a 375-bed hospital on the EM Bypass, close to Ruby General Hospital, while Sri Aurobindo Seva Kendra will set up a 300-bed clinic with super-speciality units at Labony, in Salt Lake. AMRI Hospitals, on the other hand, has finalised plans for an Institute of Neuroscience in its new wing at Dhakuria.

 The Neon hospital, the blueprint for which is also ready, will be a Rs 80-crore project. The 10-storeyed building (plus basement) with floor space of 300,000 sq ft will house super-speciality neuroscience, oncology and paediatrics units.

 Work on the hospital will start this October. It is likely to be commissioned by December next year, said Sajal Dutta, promoter of the hospital and managing director, Ruby General Hospital.

 Facilities for all types of keyhole surgeries and a gamut of neurological treatment will be available at the hospital. 

 The oncology unit will use state-of-the-art equipment, added Dutta.

 The Labony hospital of Sri Aurobindo Seva Kendra will be set up in four phases. It will be bigger than our existing facility at Jodhpur Park. A nursing institute will also be established, said A. Chanda, medical superintendent of the hospital. 

 The thrust areas of the 300-bed unit will be neuro-surgery and neuro-medicine, cardiology and trauma care. Work on the first phase will start by the end of the year. The outpatients department will be set up first, revealed Chanda. 

 Assisted Living, a unit for the aged, will be part of the hospital. A lot of old people whose children stay abroad need treatment and care. We will be providing that in our hospital, Chanda explained.

 AMRI is spending Rs 27 crore for its neuroscience centre. It will have all advanced facilities, including epilepsy and Parkinsons disease surgery and paediatric neurology, said S.B. Purkayastha, president of AMRI Hospitals. Specialists in critical care are being brought from other parts of India and abroad.

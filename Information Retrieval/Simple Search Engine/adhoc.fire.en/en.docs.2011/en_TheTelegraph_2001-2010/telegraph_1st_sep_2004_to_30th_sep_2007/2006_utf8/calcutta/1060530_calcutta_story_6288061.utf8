The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

On amp; Off

A normal man, a brilliant actor

Screen On amp; Off

 Birthday boy: Paresh Rawal

 His wife says in 30 years of togetherness his sense of humour has not changed a bit. And that?s a huge compliment since Paresh Rawal?s better half Swaroop Sampat is a class actress in her own right. 

 This Tuesday, you can get up close and personal with funnyman Paresh Rawal as he celebrates his birthday through the eyes of wife Swaroop on Jabardast Janamdin, 8 pm on STAR Gold. The show will be followed by the Paresh Rawal film festival.

 ?It is not difficult but impossible to change him,? says Swaroop on the show. ?What I like about him the most is that even when he is having fun, he does not stop caring for others. I still remember how he used to bring samosas for me in a paper napkin.?

 Paresh?s theatre friends ? Aatish Kapadia, Neeraj Vora, Umesh Shukla ? will chip in too with their birthday wishes. Finally, the man himself will speak.

 ?I want to be remembered as a brilliant actor, but as a normal human being,? are the magic words from Paresh.

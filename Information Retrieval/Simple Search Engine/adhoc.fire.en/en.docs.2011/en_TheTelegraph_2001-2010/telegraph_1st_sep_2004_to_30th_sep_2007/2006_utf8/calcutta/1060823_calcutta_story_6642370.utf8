 Hospitality training at circuit houses

 SHALMOLI KUNDU

 The public works department (PWD) has joined hands with hotel management institutes in the city to improve the service at state government circuit houses. 

 According to the plan, the hotel management students will provide free service at the circuit houses as part of their training. The department hopes that the staff at the circuit houses will pick up tips on providing better service during the exercise.

 The programme will offer dual benefit. It will help the institutes in training their students. And while working with the students, our staff will also learn more about hotel management, said P.K. Agarwal, secretary of the PWD.

 The move follows negative feedback about service from officials and guests who stayed at the circuit houses.

 The programme will kick off at the Hungerford Street circuit house. The staff strength there is around 30. Initially, 10 hotel management students will be sent for training. 

 If we get a positive response, we may introduce the programme at the other circuit houses in the state, said a PWD official. There are 34 circuit houses in Bengal. 

 The PWD has shortlisted hotel management institutes in the city for the programme. The process is on, we are preparing a list of institutes we would like to invite. We expect to start the programme from the next academic session, added the PWD official.

 There are numerous hotel management institutes in the city and the five-star hotels often fail to accommodate their students for practical training, which is a part of the curriculum. Our programme will also help the institutes in dealing with this problem, observed Agarwal.

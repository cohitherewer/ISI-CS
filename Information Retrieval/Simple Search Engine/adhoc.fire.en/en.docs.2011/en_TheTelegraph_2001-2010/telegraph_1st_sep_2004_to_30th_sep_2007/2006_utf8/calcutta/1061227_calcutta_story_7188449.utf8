The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Prashant Srivastava 

 Manager, 89 Cinemas

 Earlier I used to work in Singapore. The city has a fixed place where one can hold agitations. For that, too, one has to take permission in advance from the government. Try stopping the traffic and your head will roll. Why, even if someone litters a public place, notices come out in newspapers that the offender will clean the place at a particular time and all are invited to watch. Imagine the shame! We cannot enforce such rules because of our population. During a bandh, one set of people want to work. Let the ruling party ensure protection, and they will go out.

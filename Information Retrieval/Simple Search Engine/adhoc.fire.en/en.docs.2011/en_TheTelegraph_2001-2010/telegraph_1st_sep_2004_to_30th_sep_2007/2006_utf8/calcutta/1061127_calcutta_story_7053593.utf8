 A private bus hurtling along VIP Road towards Baguiati from Ultadanga overturned on Sunday afternoon after hitting a divider near Narayantala. All the 35 on board were injured, 15 of them critically. 

 Police had to break the bars of the bus windows to rescue the passengers. They were admitted to local nursing homes. Four of them were later shifted to RG Kar Hospital. 

 Around 12.45 pm, the bus, on route 30C/1, was travelling at high speed towards Baguiati. It swerved right, hit the divider and overturned. The passengers were trapped as the vehicle rolled over to a stop with the gates downward, said superintendent of North 24-Parganas police Praveen Kumar.

 Witnesses said the bus was being driven recklessly in a bid to overtake another bus. We will investigate if the accident took place due to mechanical failure or reckless driving. If the driver is found to be guilty, we will take action against him, added Kumar. The bus was impounded, but the driver fled.

 The accident left the passengers in a state of shock. We are thankful to the police officers for rescuing us. When the bus was overturning, we thought we would not survive. I fell off the seat and sustained injuries in the legs, spine and head, said a profusely-bleeding Abhik Roy. 

 Next to him was Arup Dutta, who could not speak even after he was taken to a local nursing home. 

 Officers of Baguiati traffic guard reached the spot on receiving the news. When we reached, we saw the passengers were trembling. Fortunately, there were no children. The only way to rescue the passengers was to break the bars of the windows, said officer-in-charge of the traffic guard Maniklal Ganguly.

 The officers fetched shovels from a nearby construction site to break the window bars. The passengers were finding it difficult to crawl out of the window and needed to be pulled out. As there was no ladder in the vicinity and the trapped people were screaming for help, officer Arun Sarkar, who is the slimmest among us, jumped inside the bus and gave each person a leg-up, recounted Ganguly.

 He continued: I, along with officers Mridul Goswami and Tapan Biswas, climbed to the side of the vehicle and pulled the passengers out. The local residents who had assembled helped the passengers to get off and took them to nursing homes in the area. Sarkar sustained injuries in his right arm during the operation.

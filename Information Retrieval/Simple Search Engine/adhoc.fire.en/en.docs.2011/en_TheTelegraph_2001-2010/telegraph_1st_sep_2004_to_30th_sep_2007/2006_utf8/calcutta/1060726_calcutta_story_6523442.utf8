 Funds key to health services

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Higher and targeted public investment in primary healthcare holds the key to a better healthcare service in the state. That?s the crux of a comprehensive report on the health sector, Health Report 2006, prepared by Bengal Initiative. 

 Representatives of the city-based NGO met health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra recently and made a presentation.

 ?We had submitted a similar report in 2003 and some of our suggestions were accepted. This report is nothing but a continuation of our efforts to improve the delivery of health services,? said Sumedha Sen, chief executive officer, Woodlands, and a member of Bengal Initiative. 

 The report checks out five fundamentals ? infrastructure, human resources management, education, funding and viability ? and comes up with recommendations.

 ?The state government spends a significant amount on health, but prioritisation of expenditure is necessary to have the desired benefits,? said Sen. 

 Identifying the key areas, it suggests major infrastructural investment to manage human resources for the health sector, to increase the number of hospital beds and to equip the hospitals with proper instruments. The government will have to fund this investment, says the report.

 ?Benefits of public-private partnership are discussed in policy circles with enthusiasm, but one has to admit that the government will have to address the basic issues at the village level,? added Sen.

 In order to improve the quality of delivery, the NGO suggests mandatory one-year house-staff training for medical students and posting, by rotation, in villages for at least six months.

 The report stresses the need to keep a tab on private hospitals to ensure a fair deal to patients. The job, it suggests, should be carried out by local government agencies.

 The existing teaching model for medical students has also been studied by the NGO. It suggests correction of the undergraduate curriculum, in consultation with the medical university, and joint ventures ? with the private sector ? for teaching. 

 On manpower management, the NGO wants government action to ensure a steady stream of qualified nurses and para-medical staff.

 This is one reservation that should bring some cheer to pedestrians and motorists alike. The state government, in a bid to inject a bit of calm in the city?s traffic chaos, has decided to reserve some driving posts for women on buses of the state-controlled transport corporations.

 ?Rash driving is one of the main causes of the spurt in road accidents. Female drivers are less inclined to reckless driving and so, more women drivers will help curb the mishap count,? transport minister Subhas Chakraborty said in the Assembly on Monday.

 More than two years ago, Chaitali Chatterjee, while steering a battery-powered bus from Ultadanga to Ruby Hospital, had told Metro: ?As far as I know, I am the only woman bus driver in the city? How can you expect women to become equal to men and move forward in life if no one is willing to give them jobs??

 Soon, Chaitali should have company. ?We are going to implement this new reservation for women from the current year?s recruitment,? said minister Chakraborty. The exact percentage of posts to be reserved for women behind the wheel will be finalised.

 He revealed this reservation plan during Question Hour on Monday, in response to Sonali Guha?s query. The Trinamul Congress MLA was demanding an explanation from the state government about the rising road accident count and the steps being taken to curb it.

 To ensure an adequate number of trained female drivers, the government will open more training institutes for drivers and make special provisions in such centres for women. Private operators will also be urged to employ more women drivers, the minister elaborated.

 Women driving their cars in Calcutta will surely welcome this move to put more women in the driver?s seat. ?State bus drivers are often the most dangerous. Forget about showing any courtesy, they often deliberately go after a car when they spot a woman behind the wheel,? complained Urmila Bhattacharjee, a young woman who regularly drives to work from Salt Lake to Hazra Road.

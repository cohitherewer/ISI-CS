 K.K. Birla and his 

 wife cut the celebratory cake on their 65th wedding 

 anniversary at Pala, ITC Sonar Bangla Sheraton amp; 

 Towers, on Saturday evening. The guest list included 

 names like the governor of West Bengal, Gopal Krishna 

 Gandhi, Arun Jaitley, Jyotiraditya Scindia, R.P. Goenka, 

 Sanjeev Goenka, Sanjay Budhia and a host of the Birlas 

 relatives from across the country. A formal sit-down 

 dinner for 250 guests had food being served from West 

 View Bar and Grill along with authentic Awadhi and Marwari 

 delicacies. Picture by Rashbehari Das 

 What: 

 12th anniversary celebrations of Someplace Else.

 Where: The pub at The Park.

 When: Saturday night.

 Tune in: The anniversary celebrations of Someplace Else kicked off on Saturday night with a performance by Indian Ocean. Even before the rock outfit could take stage, the pub was choc-a-bloc with music lovers, waiting for a glimpse of the quartet. 

 Vocalists Asheem Chakroborty on tabla and percussion and Sushmit Sen on guitar, along with Rahul Ram and Amit Kilam on drums, got the audience charged up even as they started with a jam session. With original hits like Bandeh, Kandisa, Bhor, Maa rewa and Hilla re, they had the crowds singing along and asking for more. The trademark fusion sounds of the band continued to regale the SPE audience late into midnight.

 Voiceover: The transformation from a discotheque to a place for music was difficult, but SPE has withstood the test of time. The place has seen an increase in footfalls every year. We will continue our efforts to take SPE to greater heights in the next few years, said Anirban Simlai, F amp;B manager at The Park.

 What: Monsoon Blast. 

 Where: Hotel Hindusthan International (HHI).

 When: Saturday night.

 Take a look: The evening might have been free of showers, but at HHI the monsoon was there in spirit. The poolside was a high-voltage hub of party animals set to take the plunge. Around 500, mostly GenNext, had jumped into the pool, splashing about and breaking into impromptu jigs for most part of the night. 

 While some sported denims, some chose to flaunt their curves in saris. DJ Anshul kept the party mood pumped up with his doses of pop, commercial and trance. The crowd matched steps to Kajra re, Summer of 69, songs from Gangster and Himesh Reshammiya chartbusters. The drinks flowed, spiced up with mouthfuls of Fried Fish with Tartar Sauce, Chicken Tikka and Biryani every now and then. And the rain acted as a catalyst for romance as some couples got more than a little comfortable.

 Voiceover: This was an effort to let the crowd enjoy the monsoons to the fullest, smiled Arundeep Sachdeva, executive assistant manager, food and beverage at HHI.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Not a foothold 

 to spare

 If jaywalking was an Olympic sport, 

 Calcutta would surely have grabbed a gold. Calcuttans are 

 infamous for turning a blind eye to road rules and stepping 

 off the pavement and on to the street at the slightest excuse. 

 But blaming the jaywalking Calcuttan is just one side of the 

 streetside story. The other is presented to you here in pictures 

 that speak hundreds of words. Show me the footpath before 

 penalising me for walking off it, was the common cry from 

 pedestrians, as Metro embarked on a Spot-The-Pavement 

 campaign. The top three prizes for full-house footpaths go 

 to...

 Where: The stretch in front 

 of NRS Hospital in Sealdah

 What we saw: 

 From items required for the last rites to fortune-tellers, 

 small eateries to shanties, the pavement plays host to it 

 all

 CMCspeak: ?Police 

 are enforcing the rule that pedestrians must stick to the 

 pavements. If they approach us for logistic support to clear 

 the pavements, we are ready to provide it. They have not 

 approached us for that till now? ? municipal commissioner 

 Alapan Bandyopadhyay

 Reva Devi

 Copspeak: ?Our 

 duty is to ensure that people use the pavements. But where 

 is the space to walk on the pavement? With shops of every 

 kind, there is hardly any space left for the pedestrian? 

 ? a policeman on duty

 Pedestrianspeak: 

 ?Walking on the footpath is so difficult, even dangerous. 

 There is hardly any space here, with not just shops but 

 also shanties. I once fell down while negotiating the pavement. 

 Ever since, I feel safer walking on the street. If a policeman 

 catches me, I protest? ? Reva Devi from Behala

 Where: Pavement 

 adjacent to Writers? Buildings

 What we saw: 

 The foodies? footpath, with hawkers dishing out everything 

 from Chicken Biryani to Chilli Chicken. The only thing not 

 in sight is the pavement for people to walk on

 CMCspeak: ?We 

 cannot act unless the government instructs us to do so. 

 So many people have such reasonably-priced food there? ? 

 Chandana Ghosh Dastidar, member, mayor-in-council (solid 

 waste management)

 Copspeak: ?It 

 has always been like this. The burning stoves and the lack 

 of space force many pedestrians off the footpath? ? a traffic 

 official

 Where: Brabourne 

 Road

 What we saw: Hawkers 

 and shop-owners who spread their wares here have taken over 

 the entire breadth of the pavement. No pedestrian is allowed 

 a foothold

 CMCspeak: ?We 

 had cracked down on illegal encroachments three months ago 

 after a high court directive. But they are back. More than 

 the hawkers, the shop-owners have encroached on the pavements 

 by displaying their products? ? Chandana Ghosh Dastidar

 Sourav Ghosh

 Copspeak: ?It 

 is a lost cause here. Most people using this road are hardly 

 aware that there is a pavement! As a result they all walk 

 on the road, adding to the chaos on such a busy stretch? 

 ? traffic police official on duty.

 Pedestrianspeak: 

 ?I take this route quite often and have to walk down Brabourne 

 Road only because the footpath is so congested. I 

 know it is dangerous but then negotiating the footpath is 

 next to impossible?? Sourav Ghosh from Kestopur.

 Pile-up on bridge leaves one dead 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A man in his early 30s was crushed to death under the wheels of a state bus on Vidyasagar Setu on Sunday morning. Before hitting the victim, the killer bus rammed into the railings between the two flanks and damaged a 30-ft stretch.

 As soon as the bus came to a halt, a Matador hit it from behind. And within seconds, the driver of an Ambassador collided with the Matador.

 Police said the series of mishaps occurred around 11 am, when Surojit Mandal and Kalidas Mandal, both employees of the Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners (HRBC), were cleaning the railings. 

 They were rushed to SSKM Hospital, where Surojit was pronounced dead. The condition of Kalidas was stated to be critical.

 Police blamed reckless driving for the accidents. ?The Calcutta Tramways Company bus was heading towards Bagnan from the Esplanade depot. According to the statements of the passengers, the driver started plying the bus at a high speed soon after leaving the depot. After crossing the ramp on the Calcutta side of the bridge, he further increased the speed,? said an officer of the Vidyasagar Setu traffic outpost.

 The vehicle went out of control after overtaking a private car and rammed into the divider railings, the right front wheel hitting first. 

 ?The driver tried hard to rein in the vehicle, but failed,? said an officer of Hastings police station.

 ?Both Surojit and Kalidas were standing on the median. They were run over before they could react. The bus stopped after smashing a 30-ft stretch of the railing,? the officer added. Sensing trouble, the driver jumped off his cabin and fled.

 Close behind the bus were the Matador and the Ambassador. As the bus had partly blocked the road, the drivers of both the Matador and Ambassador lost control and collided with the vehicle in front of each.

 The Ambassador was carrying three persons, who were on their way to Ghoshpara, in Howrah, to attend a wedding reception. All three were injured.

 Motorists passing by came to the victims? rescue and informed police. ?We rushed to the spot within five minutes. We took the HRBC employees to the hospital. The other injured were attended to by the motorists,? said an officer.

 In another incident of rash driving, three persons were injured when a Toyota Qualis and a Maruti van collided on Bagbazar Street, in north Calcutta. According to police, the drivers were racing against each other. 

 ?The two cars were heading towards BT Road. The race started as soon as the Maruti overtook the Qualis,? said an officer of Chitpur police station. 

 ?There persons were injured and they have been admitted to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital. Their condition was reported to be stable,? the officer added.

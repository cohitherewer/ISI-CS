Life

 She will, she will rock you

 Making music in a mans world 

 ? or rather on a mans stage ? is what keeps them going. 

 Jayashree, Anjum, Chandrani and Ananya have been independently 

 belting out folk-rock, blues, folk and pop for years while 

 their hearts have belonged to pure rock.

 And at Fridays She Rocks 

 programme at the Tollygunge Club, they will be able to dedicate 

 an entire show to the rock queens who have been their idols 

 ? Suzie Quatro, Joni Mitchell, Tina Turner, Janis Joplin, 

 Chrissie Hynde, Anne Wilson and Alanah Miles. She Rocks 

 will be the first all-women rock event in the 

 city. 

 This is India and people 

 are uncomfortable in the presence of women rock singers, 

 says Chandrani Banerjee of Krosswindz. Rock, according to 

 her, is brutally honest and totally unladylike!

 Anjum Katyal, who made her name 

 as a blues singer in the 1980s, turned to rock not only 

 because it was so avant-garde, violently critical 

 of society, but also because it was so energetic 

 that it was considered a male domain.

 Even internationally, there 

 are far fewer female rockers than male, points out 

 Anjum.

 The macho element 

 also attracted Ananya Biswas, former member of the band 

 Hip Pocket. But she reasons that the Indian public is probably 

 influenced by the reputation of alcohol and drug abuse 

 that has clung to rock singers everywhere. 

 But I dont do drugs. 

 Never needed to; I just get high on my music, smiles 

 Ananya.

 The singers at She Rocks will 

 present classic rock from the 60s and 70s, forceful no-holds-barred 

 music that is a perfect vessel for raw emotions and barely 

 contained passion.

 Music by Janis Joplin, Alanis 

 Morissette, Dolores of The Cranberries, Ricky Lee Jones, 

 Blanche, Joan Armatrading, Led Zeppelin, Sheryl Crow, Cassandra 

 Wilson, Joan Osborne and more.

 But these Calcutta rockers are 

 a different breed. For one, none of them will play the guitar 

 themselves; they have Krosswindz to accompany them. And 

 only two of the four, Jayashree Singh and Chandrani, compose 

 their own rock music. While Anjum is a trustee and editor 

 with Seagull, Ananya is busy giving shape to her new film 

 documentary unit Freebirds.

 Singing rock isnt 

 easy, you have to have the fire in you and dedicate your 

 entire self, even when all you get are snide remarks, 

 says Chandrani. While writing Bangla rock music for Krosswindz, 

 Chandrani admits that she naturally takes the womans 

 perspective and (often unconsciously) blends it with 

 local folk music.

 There is a revival of interest 

 in rock music now, much to the delight of one of the pioneering 

 women rockers in town. People are all of a sudden 

 interested in the good ol 60s and 70s, says 

 Jayashree, for whom singing rock had come naturally. When 

 I began singing, there was not much else happening, everyone 

 was singing only rock.

 Growing up on a diet of Cream 

 and Traffic, Blind Faith, Rolling Stones and more, Jayashree 

 began to perform with male singers quite early. The audience 

 then was different, but later with all the pop, trance, 

 hip hop, Indipop and Hindi remixes, rock slipped out of 

 fashion here.

 Moving from Airways to Popsecret 

 to Skinny Alley, Jayashree is proud of her own compositions 

 featured in Skinny Alleys debut album Escape the 

 Roar and the upcoming Songs from the Moonybeam.

 There is no major difference in 

 a woman singing or composing rock, feels Jayashree, except 

 that a woman probably brings a certain softness to 

 the music and adds to it dimensions male singers couldnt 

 have. 

 Being a woman in India, Jayshree 

 agrees that one cannot talk of motorcycles and fast 

 cars, so our songs mostly centre around human stories and 

 relationships, which in turn calls for an exploration of 

 a different side of music.

 Maybe the desi flavour 

 is what is making Bangla rock popular. But for committed 

 rockers, you dont have a choice. Regardless of whether 

 rock is in or out or back in fashion, you have to keep singing, 

 sums up Jayashree.

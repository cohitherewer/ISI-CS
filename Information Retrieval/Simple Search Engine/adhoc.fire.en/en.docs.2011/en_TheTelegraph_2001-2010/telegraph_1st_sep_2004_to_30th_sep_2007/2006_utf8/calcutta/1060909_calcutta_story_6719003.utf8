 What would you make of Calcuttas traffic mess if you were born on January 1, 1900? Chances are, youd be too far gone to make anything of it.

 No such luck for taxi driver Rabindra Poddar. His date of birth, as per the Indian Union Driving Licence, is 01/01/1900. But that does not stop him from slipping behind the wheel every morning, braving the chaos on the streets and driving passengers to home or work.

 Dont fret if youve just been driven around by Poddar for he is 46, and not 106 years old, as the public vehicles department (PVD) records show.

 Born on January 28, 1960 (according to his PAN card), Poddar is the victim of a typo a typographical error on his renewed driving licence (No. WB-011978376514) that was handed over to him last month by the PVD office. He had applied for renewal in July through a government-recognised motor training school on Bright Street.

 Poddar, originally from Samastipur, in Bihar, has been living at 121K, GS Bose Road, near Bondel Gate, for over 40 years, and driving a taxi on the citys streets for 26 years.

 The age-old gaffe caught the eye of a traffic police officer at Howrah station, in the third week of August, who suspected Poddar was carrying a forged licence. When I told him this mistake was made by the PVD office, the officer told me to change it immediately if I did not want to get into trouble, Poddar told Metro.

 When I approached PVD officials, they said the date of birth could not be changed, and asked me to apply for a fresh licence. Then I went to the motor training school, where I was told that since this was a mistake by the PVD, nothing could be done to rectify it. They asked me to cough up Rs 640 for a new licence, he added.

 When asked how a 106-year-old cabbie was being allowed to drive around, a PVD official at Beltala was reluctant to comment. 

 I cannot say anything without verifying the document on the basis of which the licence was issued, he said.

 He did, however, express surprise over how Rabindra Poddar had been first issued a driving licence in 1978 that was valid till 2009. For, by the book, Poddar was already 78 years old and not eligible for a licence valid beyond two years.

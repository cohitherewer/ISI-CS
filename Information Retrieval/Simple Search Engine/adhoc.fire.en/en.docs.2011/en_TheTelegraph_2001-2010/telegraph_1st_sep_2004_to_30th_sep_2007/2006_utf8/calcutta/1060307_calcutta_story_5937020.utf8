Screen On amp; Off

 Saif Ali Khan in a scene from Being Cyrus

 Why was Being Cyrus locked up in the cans all this while?

 My producers are in the process of making a whole lot of movies and so they were testing the market abroad all this while. Especially with focus groups in Europe. In fact, Being Cyrus was being screened at exclusive festivals in the last three months to gauge the response in the international market. That?s the only reason we were prolonging the release date.

 Won?t the images look dated, having been shot a couple of years back?

 Not at all, because the film itself has a unique look. Being Cyrus has not been shot in a madly modern way. In fact, it is in a kind of time warp. So, it really doesn?t bother me that the film is releasing after so long. Also, no other film has been made in the meantime with the same storyline.

 What is the storyline of Being Cyrus?

 It is adapted from a short story by Kersi Khambatta. The two of us banged it out into a screenplay. It is about this guy Cyrus, played by Saif Ali Khan, recounting a bizarre chapter in his life when he landed up on the doorstep of the Sethna family. All the family members are completely wacko and have their own agendas. They all try to use Cyrus as a pawn to carry out their dreams. Now, Cyrus himself has his own agenda.

 So is it a collision of cultures?

 What I have tried to explore through Cyrus is what happens when you are suddenly confronted with a different set of individuals. They are different from his system of values, they have a very different moral fibre. I have also treated the film very casually, tried to strip it down to as simple as possible. As an audience, you laugh at these characters who are not doing the ?right? things. There is no social message as such.

 Did you write your characters with actors like Saif, Naseeruddin, Boman and Dimple in mind?

 I have to thank my producers for giving me the cast I needed to make Being Cyrus. The performances in the film are quite incredible. All of them except Cyrus are these extreme characters and they all blend in so well. The joy of a director is to watch his actors not acting. They just threw away the lines. I guess the reason they all agreed to do the film is because of the opportunity they got to do something different. Also the fact that the film was shot in 32 days flat and each of the main actors had to give around eight days each.

 Call it luck or foresight, your leading man is now a superstar?

 Saif had already done Hum Tum when I signed him for Being Cyrus. Saif?s character in the film was the toughest to play. Cyrus?s self-conflict is tremendous ? he doesn?t know who he is or what he is doing, he is not sure what world he?s come from or what world he?s getting into? 

 Saif is very understated in the film, he has interpreted the character beautifully. He has, in fact, withheld his character to project the bizarreness of many a situation. Off camera, Saif has phenomenal sensibility of the film and his characterisation. Before each of his scenes he would want to know the motivation of Cyrus.

 And then there?s Naseer?

 He is a joy to work with. He was very clear about what I wanted from him and that?s what he likes. Everything should be like clockwork. The little bits of magic that he brings to the movie is amazing. In some situations, like in a long, long scene where he has just one dialogue, Naseer is just there and you know he?s there. He enjoyed the film so much that he would come back to just hang out on the sets even if he didn?t have any shot on a particular day.

 What?s next?

 Many, many more movies, I want to be in it hook, line and sinker. I have written two more scripts but haven?t decided which one to make next. I am also continuing with my scubadiving and recently, did a bit of photography of some olive ridley turtles.

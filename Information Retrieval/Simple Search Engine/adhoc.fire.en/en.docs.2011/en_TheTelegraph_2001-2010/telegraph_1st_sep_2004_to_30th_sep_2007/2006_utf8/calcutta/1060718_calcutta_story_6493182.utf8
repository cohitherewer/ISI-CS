 Cab ride, cricket run

 A quick game of cricket after a quirky cab ride. After the success of Taxi No. 9211, director Milan Luthria is now making a film on cricket called Hat Trick. While the movie is not entirely about the sport, elements of the game do run throughout the film.

 The maker of films like Deewaar (Amitabh Bachchan, Sanjay Dutt, Akshaye Khanna) and Kachche Dhaage (Ajay Devgan and Saif Ali Khan) has also left the Sippy camp to join hands with UTV for his new project. If Milan?s John Abraham-Nana Patekar-Sameera Reddy-starrer was produced by Rohan Sippy under the RS Films banner, Hat Trick will be delivered for the UTV Motion Pictures house.

 ?Milan and UTV have worked together closely on the highly successful Taxi No. 9211 and we are pleased to be doing Hat Trick with him,? says UTV honcho Ronnie Screwvala. ?He is a very talented director who is in complete sync with the cinematic language of today. Together we have developed a unique concept and assembled a fabulous cast to see it through.?

 According to insiders, Hat Trick is a six-in-one portmanteau film like Darna Mana Hai and Darna Zaroori Hai. The one element that binds the six stories together is cricket. Hat Trick, ?a story of the triumph of the human spirit?, also needs each of its protagonists to pull out a magic trick from the hat and hence the title, apart from the cricketspeak, of course.

 The film couldn?t be timed better, as it goes on the floors in September and will be released in February 2007, just a month before the ICC Cricket World Cup. Hat Trick hopes to make most of the cricket fever that will hit the nation during that phase and UTV will do all it can to promote the movie parallel to the World Cup marketing blitzkrieg.

 ?Ronnie and I have had a fruitful association with Taxi No. 9211, distributed by UTV worldwide, and we had been talking of doing a film together for a long time, in fact even before Taxi started,? says Milan. ?The talks crystallised when we spent time together on the hectic international promo tour of Taxi, and I am happy to be working for a producer with whom I share a great rapport.?

 While the final casting is yet to be decided, Hat Trick will reportedly bring together the very best of actors including Nana Patekar, Naseeruddin Shah, Paresh Rawal, Hema Malini and Kunal Kapoor. Last heard, Mandira Bedi was yet to be contacted!

Safdar Hashmi and his Jana Natya Mancha take on a 

life of their own in documentary film-maker Lalit Vachanis Natak Jari Hai. 

The 84-minute film, where Vachani probes the career of Delhi-based agitprop theatre 

group Jana Natya Mancha (popularly known as JANAM), was screened by the Seagull 

Foundation for the Arts to a packed audience at Max Mueller Bhavan last Friday.

I always wanted to make a film on the IPTA (Indian 

Peoples Theatre Association) for its role in the mass cultural movement in theatre. 

Jana Natya Manch is born out of IPTA and it helped me showcase the ideologies 

and significance of Safdar Hashmi who founded Jana Natya Manch and lost his life 

trying to hold on to the cause, said Vachani, a graduate from University of Pennsylvania. 

Natak Jari Hai brings together Hashmis wife 

Malashree and some of the oldest members of JANAM, like Sudhanya, alongside young 

theatre aspirants like Sarita and Nakul. Vachani documents their belief in sensitising 

people about various issues through their interactive street plays.

In the plays, the members take viewers through the 

journey of their troupe, from the time Hashmi formed Jana Natya Manch in 1973 

till today. Vachani tours places in Delhi and Srinagar with Jana Natya Manch as 

and when they staged short plays on streets or at rallies, using wit and parody 

in their language.

Vachani also visits Sahibabad, a small town in Ghaziabad, 

where Hashmi was attacked by a political group and later succumbed to his injuries. 

The footage includes archival stills, videos on Hashmi, and performances of plays 

like Aurat, Natak Jari Hai and Machine. 

While a major part of the documentary is filmed in 

colour, black-and-white snippets of Machine are interspersed. Machine 

was purposely adapted for the proscenium because it had been performed on 

the streets too many times. I wanted it to have a different visual appeal on screen 

compared to their usual street performances, said Vachani, whose documentary 

work includes the films The Boy in the Branch and The Men in the Tree.

Ashoknagar Natyamukh is presenting Bratya Basus new 

play Operation 2010 at Sujata Sadan on August 13, 6.30 pm. With the World 

Cup still fresh in public memory, this play is sure to make a mark. Written a 

year back, it is about football and the possibilities of India winning the World 

Cup in 2010. It also draws parallels between football and theatre. 

These are two things that I feel can be identified 

with a race and be the symbol of an age, yet our age chooses to look askance at 

both. The play focuses on the unscientific approach adopted for the game and the 

condescending way in which most people regard it, said playwright Bratya Basu.

Operation 2010 has been directed by Obhi Chakravarty. 

Music is by Satrajit Sarkar and stage design by Angshuman Sarkar.

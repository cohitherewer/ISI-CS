 Court orders sold as scrap

 - 355 of 800-odd files retrieved after grilling drug addict

 A STAFF REPORTER

 From the most secure section of Calcutta High Court to a kabadiwala?s dump ? hundreds of vital case files had travelled a long way before police tracked them down on Thursday. A drug addict and two scrap paper traders found themselves in the line of fire for stealing case files from court.

 Following the confessions of 28-year-old Ranjit Naik, 355 of the 800-odd lost files were traced to a Narkeldanga dump owned by Mahfooz Alam and Mohammad Shamim. Officers of Hare Street police station are still investigating the possibility of insider involvement in the theft.

 According to an officer, Naik entered the court premises through the ventilator and stole a large number of files over three to four days. He allegedly sold the files as scrap to dump-owners Alam and Shamim.

 ?Naik is a drug addict and lives on the street around the high court. Acting on a tip-off, he was picked up near GPO on Wednesday evening. Our officers raided the Narkeldanga godown after he confessed to selling the files as scrap to the duo. The 355 files were recovered after a long search. The investigation is on and involvement of insiders has not been ruled out,? stated deputy commissioner of police (central division) Ajay Kumar.

 The theft came to light on Tuesday morning when some court officers noticed that a large number of files was missing from the mandamus section, in the basement of the Centenary Building of the high court. A complaint was lodged with Hare Street police station.

 ?We are raiding scrap paper dumps to trace the rest of the files. A list from the high court, providing the exact number of missing files and their details, is awaited,? added Kumar. Preliminary investigation by the detective department, which took up the case, suggested that about 800 files are missing. Four hundred and fifty of them contain orders on land-related issues. The rest pertain to judgments on education and other matters.

 Contradictory statements by Naik have baffled the cops. ?He told us initially that he himself stole the files to buy drugs. He later said that he was accompanied by friends. It does not seem to be a one-man job,? said an officer of Hare Street police station.

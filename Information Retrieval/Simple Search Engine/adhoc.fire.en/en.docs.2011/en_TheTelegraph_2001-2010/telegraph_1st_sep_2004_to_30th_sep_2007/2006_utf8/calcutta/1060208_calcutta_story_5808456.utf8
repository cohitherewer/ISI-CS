 700-cr of fudged house tax

 - Civic body scurry to set books right, realise rightful dues

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A section of Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) employees has fudged house-tax bills to the tune of Rs 700 crore, the authorities have come to know.

 Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya has asked the assessment department to look into the false bills and rectify the records at the earliest.

 The revelation of the forgery, however, does not write off the civic body?s claim that it is saddled with property-tax dues worth crores.

 Records reveal that the outstanding amount is around Rs 1,300 crore. Even after taking into account the forged bills ? an act of assessment inspectors to harass house-owners ? the CMC can still rightfully claim Rs 600 crore.

 The mayor and municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay have held several rounds of talks with assessment and collection officials to find out a way to recover the sum.

 As for setting the forged records straight, which will involve revisions in the property tax rate in several cases, the authorities have decided to take the help of employees with long experience in assessment, but now transferred to other departments.

 A senior officer in the assessment department said that in almost 90 per cent of the disputed cases, inspectors and section clerks had forged the documents.

 Most of the disputes are related to ?abnormally high? re-assessment value, status of a building (residential or commercial) and double claim of tax (the civic body has claimed tax even after the house-owner has paid it).

 More than 300 cases of tax disputes are in tribunals and courts. ?It is better to move court than cough up the amount again,? the official added.

 One of the victims of double claim is Tapan Talukdar. When he had approached the Gariahat office for a ?no-outstanding certificate?, necessary for mutating a property, he was handed over an arrear house-tax bill of over Rs 15,000. 

 The bill was cancelled only after Talukdar produced receipts of the payments made years ago.

 In the CMC, neither are officials responsible for maintaining records of payments nor are clerks held accountable for sending wrong bills. The onus lies on the house-owner to prove that he has cleared all his dues.

 If an owner loses tax receipts, he may have to pay the amount again, with interest.

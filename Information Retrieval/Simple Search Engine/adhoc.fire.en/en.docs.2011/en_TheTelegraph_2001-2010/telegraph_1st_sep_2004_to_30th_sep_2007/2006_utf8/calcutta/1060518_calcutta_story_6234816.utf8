 Born out of the aural story-telling tradition that flourished in the temples of ancient north India, Kathak as a dance form developed in temple courtyards, being elevated to royal courts much later. The word kathak originally meant storyteller; one who would recount mythological tales while dancing in a state of devotional ecstasy. Though its religious associations were initially more pronounced, Kathak was gradually enhanced by elements of sophistication in style and presentation. Today, this classical form depicts life and is based on the philosophy of the Trinity ? creation (Brahma), preservation (Vishnu) and destruction (Maheshwar). This evening?s Kathak recital by Ashimbandhu Bhattacharjee, whose dance is a configuration of the Jaipur and Lucknow gharanas, presents a harmonious amalgamation of grace, splendour and vigour. The dancer will be accompanied by Utpal Ghosal (tabla), Debashish Sarkar (vocal), Chandrachur Bhattacharjee (sitar) and Naresh Mukherjee (pakhawaj).

When: Today at 6 pm

 What: Ek Shaan-dar Shaam hosted by 107.8 Power FM.

 Where: Tea Lawns of the Royal Calcutta Golf Club.

 When: Tuesday night.

 The bash: With the theme of the evening being Tishnagi ? title of Shaans new album, meaning thirst ? it was only to be expected that everyone would be in high spirits by the time the singer took the stage.

 The presence of DJ music and a lively performance by Mou Mukherjee ? she sang and danced to everything from Deedar de to Dhoom macha le ? warmed up the ambience by the time Shaan strolled in, wife in tow.

 Once on stage, the singer stole the show with back-to-back hits in the form of Dus bahaane and My dil goes hmmm.

 Bikram Ghosh and wife Jaya Seal Ghosh were present to cheer Shaan on as he moved over to his Indipop tracks. The highlight of the evening was his rendition of Michael Learns To Rocks Take me to your heart, where his Hindi lyrics punctuated the original baseline.

 The Tishnagi title song had Shaan talking music. Hindi rock ki ektu beshi beshi hoye gechhe (Is there an overdose of Hindi rock)? he asked the audiences.

 Please tell me what you felt about the song. Notun album to bujhtei parchhen khub insecure feel korchhi...

 The response came in the form of loud applause and laughter.

 Shaan then moved on to sing Shuruaat, the track which has been used in the soundtrack of Chronicles of Narnia.

 Reunion rules

 What: The St Xaviers College Calcutta Alumni Association (SXCCAA) Annual Reunion Dinner, in association with The Telegraph. 

 Where: St Xaviers College campus.

 When: February 4.

 The bash: One of the premier events on the college alumni social calendar, the Nawabs and Begums night saw the college grounds wear a festive look. The dinner also celebrated the 20th year of the college alumni association.

 With the evergreen Krosswindz belting out tracks to suit the mood, the strains of Enrique Iglesias and Kylie Minogue could be heard well into the night. 

 The annual dinner also served as a platform for the current office bearers of the alumni association to felicitate the old boys who had originally set up the alumni association in 1985. 

 If it wasnt for the untiring efforts of these men, we would not be standing here, said S. K. Agarwal, treasurer, SXCCAA.

 With a strain of ghazals accompanying the dinner wafting across the ground as well, a feeling of nostalgia was omnipresent throughout the evening.

 Voiceover: Father P. C. Mathew, principal, St Xaviers College and president of the alumni association, said: This is a grand event. What makes it even more worthwhile is seeing our ex-students troop in with the same expression of eagerness and expectation that they had when they walked through these hallowed halls for the first time.

 Inside track

 What: A party to celebrate Euro Fashion Inners being recognised by Lycra Images Fashion Awards 2006 as the Most Admired Innerwear Brand of the year. 

 Where: Cloud 9 at Astor.

 When: February 6, 7.30 pm onwards.

 The bash: Just as one entered the venue, a trophy resembling a feminine form in pink with a golden ribbon across reading The 6th Annual Lycra Images Fashion Awards was an in-your-face reminder of the occasion.

 Till late evening, the turnout was at best modest. Guests, mostly men in casuals, lazed about, catching up with friends and munching on finger food. A white cake inscribed with Euro and the trademark red lip associated with the brand was cut amidst cheers, claps and shouts of prepare to get assaulted (the brands catch line).

 Popular English songs along with light Hindi melodies like Chandni raatein played in the background. 

 Voiceover: The award is a great driving force for all of us, allowing us a stronger foothold in the market, said Tirtha Bhowmik, national sales manager, Euro.

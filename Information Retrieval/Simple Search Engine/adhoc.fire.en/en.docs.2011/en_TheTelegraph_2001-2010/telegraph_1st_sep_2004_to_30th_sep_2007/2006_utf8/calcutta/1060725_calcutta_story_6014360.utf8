 Experiments and innovations

 A fire gun, a crane and a security device, all home-grown. And the maker is 15-year-old Rahul Kumar Singh, a student of Class XI in Ling Liang High School, in central Calcutta.

 Sunday mornings are not for cricket or football for this teen talent, but to try his hand at newer innovations.

 ?I started experimenting with various objects since I was in Class V. But as I could not fathom the mechanisms behind the devices, the experiments were confined to what was described in textbooks,? recalls Rahul, who wants to be a mechanical engineer.

 ?As I grew up, I could see through the working of various gadgets. Now, I try to replicate whatever gadget or equipment I come across in my daily life, albeit on a smaller scale. The objects used for replication are as simple as springs, bottles and containers,? he adds.

 Rahul?s first ?invention? was a fire gun, which he made with deodorant and a cigarette lighter. ?When alcohol is kept under high pressure and then released, it comes out with a great force. At that point, if it comes in contact with fire, the spray turns into fire spray,? said Rahul.

 ?I followed the same logic, though the items used were an expired deodorant, a plastic tube and a cigarette lighter. This fire gun can be used for killing insects and also for protection,? he explained.

 He next tried his hands at producing a miniature crane. He first observed the working of a crane while the tram tracks were being repaired near his house in Burrabazar. The uniqueness of Rahul?s version is that it works with water pressure.

 The latest creation is a home-security alarm. ?It?s a simple gadget, comprising a small circuit and a few wires. Sensitive even to air, it rings when an insect passes through,? Rahul explained.

 His current project is a robotic arm that will operate without batteries or electricity, and will perform basic chores, like passing a glass of water or a cellphone. 

 Success will goad him on to making a full-fledged robot.

 Take trip or tear in stride

 SHRADHA AGARWAL

 (Clockwise from top) Actress Jeniffer Garner and her overflowing ivory gown on the red carpet at the 78th annual Academy Awards; singer Janet Jacksons infamous wardrobe malfunction; Garner reacts after nearly tripping on the hem of her dress 

 When actress Jennifer Garner tripped but did not tumble on the Kodak theatre stage, the star-studded audience and millions of Oscar viewers around the globe let out a collective ooooooooohhh.

 Drapes, silhouettes, colours and cleavage ? all need to be in the right place at the right time to make that one lasting impression when the world is watching.

 Garners overflowing ivory gown thus entered the wardrobe malfunction hall of (in)fame. Hers will remain one of the more modest entries on this dubious list for nothing tore and nothing tumbled out.

 GoodLife grabs the opportunity to present a checklist of common wardrobe malfunctions with tips on damage control.

 Wear tear

 Obsessed with the oh-so-pretty heritage weaves hidden inside moms cupboard? Well, designer Anamika Khanna suggests you let them be where they are. The lovely fabric can tear right in the middle of a do, she warns.

 If you do insist on wearing that old Benarasi, concentrate on proper lining and avoid damaged parts to safeguard you to a certain extent. But in case you do hear that precious piece rip, smile sweetly and run ? or slink away ? for cover, depending on where the tear is! 

 Zip down

 Bollywood design badshah Manish Malhotra crowns zipper snap as the most common faux pas. It can happen when the outfit is too heavy or the fit is too tight; and if it does snap, just take cover.

 Manish advises carrying it off with confidence for, Whats the big deal, it can happen to anyone. Can anyone prevent accidents?

 Rip off 

 The most common error, feels designer Sabyasachi Mukherjee, is an accidental rip or fall-off. Sounds scary if you go by what happened to Janet Jackson at the Super Bowl concert. Sounds smart if you go by how Garner came out smiling. Accept it with grace or be witty and handle it with a clever line. Nothing beats learning how to laugh at yourself along with others, says Sabyasachi.

 Wrong number 

 Another big booboo is wearing something completely out of place. Imagine landing up at a chiffon and pearls do in distressed denims and slip-ons. If you end up wearing such an inappropriate outfit, then change your stylist immediately, smiles Sabyasachi. And if your stylist happens to be you, just live and learn.

 Old akhara 

 vs trendy gym 

 Body basics: Sylvester 

 Stallone 

 Bodybuilding as a sport 

 is in a spot in the suburbs. Although youngsters from lower 

 middle class and poor families join the local akharas 

 with big dreams, most drop out in a few years because of 

 lack of infrastructure and funds. Competition from a number 

 of modern gymnasiums that have sprung up in the recent past 

 only add to the crisis.

 Those who patronise the traditional 

 clubs, however, are determined not to give in to the numerous 

 odds. When I started bodybuilding at Nawpara Kheyali Sangha 

 nearly 12 years ago, there werent many gyms around. I love 

 my akhara and stuck to it. It wouldnt be true to 

 say that bodybuilders are not emerging from the traditional 

 clubs. Most bodybuilders in this area are from such clubs, 

 says Rajkumar Ganguly, 28, a resident of Nawpara, Hooghly. 

 But the financial crunch has taken 

 a toll. Shakti Ashram Byamagar at Kanaipur, Hooghly, doesnt 

 even have a display board with the name at its entrance. 

 Still, it boasts of about 50 members and has produced a 

 number of notable bodybuilders. 

 Kesab Chandra Kar, secretary of 

 Konnagar Manashatala Bayam Mandir, one of the biggest bodybuilding 

 clubs of Hooghly, says: We dont have a gym here. We make 

 this clear to the youngsters when they join. The boys work 

 out with iron dumbbells; there are no machines. Although 

 the club has around 50 members, the membership fees do not 

 cover expenses. Its just Rs 5 per member per month. There 

 is hardly anything for the club, says Kar. The club is 

 one of the fortunate few that has members who pay the fees.

 Biswajit Pal, a member of Nawpara 

 Kheyali Sangha, rues: Quite a few good professional bodybuilders 

 who practised here have left due to the lack of infrastructure. 

 He adds: People who come here are mostly from lower middle 

 class families. It often proves difficult for them to pursue 

 the sport because of pressure both from home and at work.

 Those who are better off turn 

 to modern gyms but there always are youths who swear by 

 the efficacy of tradition over technology. Ashish Karmakar, 

 27, of Konnagar Manashatala Bayam Mandir, who has a couple 

 of district level titles in his kitty, says: Ive been 

 bodybuilding at this akhara for nearly eight years 

 now. I didnt go to gyms for lack of good coaches. The other 

 deterrent is the monthly fees, which is Rs 75 or more. The 

 admission fees are around Rs 500. Karmakars coach Panchucharan 

 Ghosh says: Manual exercises like push-ups and sit-ups 

 are bodybuilding basics. No bodybuilder can be 100 per cent 

 dependent on gyms.

 No one is too hopeful of the prospects 

 of bodybuilding as a sport. Its difficult to get sponsors, 

 says Kar. Ganguly recounts: I wanted to be a professional 

 bodybuilder, but couldnt because of the constraints. Jagat, 

 a friend of mine who was the champion in 12 all-Bengal competitions 

 and stood fourth at the India Federation Cup 2004, is yet 

 to get a job. Jagat Jyoti Charkaborty is a member of Talpukur 

 Byamagar, Serampore. Im into this sport for 10 years. 

 The traditional workouts are a must. In the gym, we only 

 get to do weight-specific exercises.

 Students film fest

 The Acethetik Film, Drama and 

 Cultural Society will organise the Indian Student Film Festival 

 for the first time in Bangalore between February 3 and 9, 

 2007. We are planning to make this an annual event, said 

 Krishna Menon, CEO of Acethetik Consultants. 

 There will be four categories 

 short documentary, short feature, animation and music 

 video under which the films will be screened. To participate 

 in the festival, students have to produce a letter from 

 their college or university along with a photo ID. The best 

 entry in each category will be shortlisted for the final 

 competition in Bangalore. The chairman of the jury will 

 be film-maker Shyam Benegal.

 The winning productions will be 

 screened in other cities. We will also forward them to 

 some of the international film festivals that will attend 

 the festival, said Menon.

 There will also be a non-competitive 

 section, which will include open forums and seminars by 

 film industry leaders, and social interactive sessions amongst 

 students, producers and programmers. Contemporary world 

 cinema and diploma films of great film-makers will also 

 be featured at the festival.

 Feeling at home

 nWe were recently taken to Vivekananda 

 Education Society for Children, a home for orphans and a 

 school for underprivileged children. A small cultural programme 

 was held in which the children of the home sang songs, danced 

 and recited poems. We also presented a song. We were then 

 offered snacks with a lot of care. It was only after returning 

 home that I realised how important our visit was to the 

 home inmates. When I grow up, I will donate money to the 

 orphan children.

 The Diary

 Flambeau

 A dirty pedlar returns home at 

 twilight,

 No more able to carry the burden on his back.

 He sits in the shade of a giant fig tree

 and dreamily stares at the scarlet horizon.

 In those weary eyes of his, youll find

 a sudden bright spark.

 It tells of the amusing panorama of his life.

 The orange sky playing a game of hide and seek

 with the smoky grey clouds hovering above.

 How easily he killed the growing hunger

 by watching the scarlet, blue flowers growing

 in wheatfields and on wastelands.

 Never did he complain nor did he demand for those lost years.

 The love-filled memories were now

 stunted thorns of his life which once were the gentle panacea.

 ...He felt sick smelling the stale air

 and slowly again he was getting morbid...

 ...A strong urge to meet her in those dark valleys

 or between the gray rocks in the winter nights.

 A wish to hold the passing time, but defeated

 by the dying desire...

 Echo of the bleak walls made him weak again.

 Ronojoy Dutta, 

 Class XI, Vivekananda Mission School

 The last few days

 All these twelve years I have 

 loved this place

 Home was so boring ... oh so very boring

 And my school... an abode of freedom.

 But now that so little is left of my school life

 A journey perilous, enjoyable yet steep,

 All sorrows are forgotten

 Left is the image of beauty... pure and deep

 In a months time I will be gone 

 And yet another somebody will replace me,

 Yet this part of my life will never be forgotten

 And this void will be there forever in me.

 Every spot reminds me of some little story,

 Every graffiti reminds me of a distant tale,

 Every tree reminds me of the time that was spent,

 Every stair how I conquered a gale.

 Yet this is the end of all that we have been 

 And all we did or dreamed. All of them 

 to be replaced by a new set of thoughts.

 Just like our names shall be struck off 

 And be replaced by another set of names...

 Now perhaps I understand why they say 

 That life is just a game!!!

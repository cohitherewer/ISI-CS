 The vegetarians can go for Marquis Pass (pizza topped with asparagus and jalapeno) or Maldinis Handball (seasonal vegetables and citrus fruits in 1,000 island dressing).

 Pocket pinch: Prices range between Rs 120 and Rs 300.

 Voiceover: This is an effort to add excitement to the football frenzy in Calcutta. To accompany the special soccer menu, we have also made arrangements to show the matches live on the giant screen, said a spokesperson for The Kenilworth.

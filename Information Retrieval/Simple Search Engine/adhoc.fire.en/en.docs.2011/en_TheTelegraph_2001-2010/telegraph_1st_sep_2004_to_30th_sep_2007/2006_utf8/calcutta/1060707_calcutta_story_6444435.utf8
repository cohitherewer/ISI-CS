The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Dangle a snake, flee with cash

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Watch out, snake-and-snatch gangs are on the prowl.

 One such gang, comprising three members, all from Andhra Pradesh, was arrested at the crossing of Sarat Bose Road and Elgin Road on Thursday morning. 

 The gang?s modus operandi was to dangle a snake in front of commuters and force them to part with cash.

 ?Around 11.30 am, the south Calcutta intersection was very busy. The three were moving around with a basket containing a non-venomous snake,? said an officer of Bhowanipore police station. 

 They approached a couple and asked for a ?few paise? as puja subscription. As the couple gave them Rs 2, the gang brought out the snake and dangled it before their faces, demanding Rs 100.

 ?The couple managed to flee and lodge a complaint with sergeant Nabyendu Bhattacharya, who was posted nearby. The sergeant immediately contacted Bhowanipore police station, from where a team arrived and took the trio in custody,? said an officer.

 He added that several such gangs are active in the city. ?They target cars waiting at the signal, windowpanes rolled down. Initially, they ask for a nominal amount, but once a person takes out his wallet, they bring out the snake and demand a hefty sum.?

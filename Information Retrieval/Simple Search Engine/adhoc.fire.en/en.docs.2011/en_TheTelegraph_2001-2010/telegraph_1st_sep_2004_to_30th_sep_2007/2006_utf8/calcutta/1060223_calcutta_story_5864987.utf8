 Big sandwich bite

 Subway Sandwiches is adding two more outlets to its now lone address at 234/3A, AJC Bose Road. The second outlet in Bengal Intelligence Park, Sector V, will start serving its submarine-shaped sandwiches by April. The third address in Dalhousie will open by June.

 Subway had started serving its Kali Mirch Chicken and Chettinad Chicken on the South Club street outlet from August 31. So, the next two outlets would be opening within a year of the American fast food chains Calcutta debut.

 Calcutta is definitely ready for these outlets, says Rishi Bajoria, area development manager (Calcutta). Though we could not gauge the demand initially, our internal assessments peg the Calcutta capacity at five Subway outlets. Keeping that in mind we have identified five locations in the city where we would be opening up over a period of time.

 First up is a 650 sq ft sandwich stop in Bengal Intelligence Park. The technology hub was chosen because it provides a huge catchment area for the fast food chain. The crowd at Sector V is our typical target group aware of good things in life and willing to spend on them. It is a catchment area of more than 100,000 people within a radius of 250 metres, says Bajoria.

 From the IT hub in April to the central business district in June. Dalhousie is a densely populated area by the virtue of its flying footfall and the number of employees in the zone, says Bajoria. 

 We had conducted a survey in the offices in Dalhousie and its adjoining localities, and the response was overwhelming. The first brand that sets up shop there would score over the others. We are keeping the address under wraps as some paperwork is still pending.

 The first Subway restaurant was started in 2001 in New Delhi. Calcuttas first Subway outlet has moved into the top five outlets all over the country. In fact, on the second Saturday after opening, the sandwich run had to be suspended for a day as there were too few sandwiches too feed too many mouths. 

 By this summer, there will be two more Subway Sandwiches counters to dig into.

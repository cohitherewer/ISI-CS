 Sundays unsafe on the road

 - Holiday casualty count is a pointer to reckless driving on empty streets

 KINSUK BASU 

So you thought Sunday was safest to go out for a ride or explore the city with your folks on your favourite wheels? Well, not really, if fatality figures released by the traffic department are anything to go by.

 Last year, road mishap deaths were highest on the Sundays. At least 82 lives were lost on the road on those days in 2005, against 57 people the year before (a rise by 43 per cent).

 ?It is difficult to pinpoint the reason, but people go out on joyrides in larger numbers on Sundays than on any other day. And since traffic is much less on Sundays, people tend to drive recklessly,? said Jawed Shamim, deputy commissioner of police (traffic).

 Though the increase in the city?s overall road space is not commensurate with the rise in the number of cars (56 per cent from 2002 to 2004), the space on certain stretches has increased significantly. Besides, the condition of certain roads, including some arteries, has improved.

 All these may have combined to contribute towards increasing the average speed of vehicles. But for the traffic police, it means more deaths on roads. The most vulnerable, officers said, are pedestrians above 45 years of age. In 2005, as many as 194 persons aged 45 or more died in mishaps, against 160 the year before.

 Going by the casualty figures, a better road means more speed and reckless driving, and a higher number of accidents.

 A case in point is the newly-done up BT Road, which tops the list of 13 most-accident-prone thoroughfares in the city. 

 The artery was witness to 24 accidents last year, followed by Strand Road (19) and AJC Bose Road (18).

 ?We have noticed of late that the number of accidents beyond the traffic hours, that is between 10 at night and six in the morning, has gone up considerably. With the roads almost empty at that time, drivers throw caution to the winds,? said deputy commissioner Shamim.

 Against 420 deaths beyond traffic hours in 2004, 484 people died last year. And this year, till May, the count stands at 226.

 ?Compare this with the number of traffic cases registered: 8,746 in 2003 to 735 this year (till May). While the number of accidents has gone down, those that occur result in casualties,? said an officer.

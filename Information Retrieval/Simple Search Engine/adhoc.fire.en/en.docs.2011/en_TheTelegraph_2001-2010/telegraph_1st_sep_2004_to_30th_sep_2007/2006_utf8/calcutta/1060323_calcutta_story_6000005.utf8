The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Theatre on a compact disc

 - STAGE PERSONALITIES ADMIT THERE?S A MARKET, BUT PREFER TO GO LIVE

 SEBANTI SARKAR

 A scene from Pancham Vaidic?s Hajabarala

 When Kaushik Sen of Swapnasandhani was returning from a theatre workshop in Pune, members of the Mumbai theatre fraternity handed him VCDs to acquaint him with their work. 

 Veteran stage director Bibhas Chakraborty says that though making and marketing VCDs is beyond Anya Theatre, the group often makes amateur video recordings of performances for reference. ?These are more like home videos but theatre groups abroad often sell VCDs at show venues,? said Chakraborty.

 Nandikar?s VCDs of plays like Antigone and Football (priced between Rs 200 and Rs 250), which grace stalls during their annual festivals, do find takers.

 And come Poila Baisakh (April 14), Bhavna records and cassettes will release the first four of the seven-play VCDs of Pancham Vaidic. Hajabarala, Putul Khela, Lanka Dahan Pala and Chandali will appear first, priced at Rs 150-200 each.

 So will play VCDs give that extra fillip to Calcutta?s theatre? According to Biswa Ray, owner of Bhavna: ?Most people are so busy these days that they can?t see plays even if they want to. As organisers, we have repeatedly had to face empty or half-filled halls. So, we are taking theatre to the people, hoping that the VCDs will tempt more people to visit the theatres.? 

 Rudraprasad Sengupta disagrees. ?Nothing can beat a live performance. Play VCDs are, at best, good films. For VCDs, there are cameramen and editors intervening in the viewing process, whereas during live stage shows, viewers are unconsciously doing their own personal editing and interpretation of plays. VCDs offer actors no scope for the essential interaction with the audience,? he said.

 While admitting that there was a market for VCDs abroad, he said Nandikar uses them only as reference points. ?Groups from Bangladesh and other places do send us VCDs while festival selections are on. But we ultimately depend on the opinion of actual viewers for our decisions,? said Sengupta. Usha Ganguly, too, has no plans of making VCDs of Rangakarmee plays. 

 Saoli Mitra said that the difference in medium had necessitated some changes. She was not sure how the plays would look after editing but every effort was being taken to preserve the effects of a stage performance. Some Vaidic members said that the use of a single camera had necessitated several repeat performances. 

 But Biswa Ray is optimistic of the outcome ?We hope to take up other theatre groups later on,? he said.

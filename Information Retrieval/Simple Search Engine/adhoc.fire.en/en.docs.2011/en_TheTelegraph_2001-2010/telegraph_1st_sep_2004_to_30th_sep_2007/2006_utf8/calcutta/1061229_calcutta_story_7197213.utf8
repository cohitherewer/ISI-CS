The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 KBC king-size

 If Ummeed se dugna was 

 the catchline for the Amitabh Bachchan-hosted Kaun Banega 

 Crorepati, for Shah Rukh Khan it will be Kuchh sawaal 

 zindagi badal saktey hain.

 At 9 pm on Friday night, the entire STAR Network STAR Plus, STAR One, STAR World, STAR Movies and Channel [V] will flash the first SRK campaign for KBC. Till date it has been only a teaser playing with the three letters of SRK and KBC apart from the viewer questions.

 The campaign for Shah Rukhs entry to KBC starts with an enactment of his childhood in Delhi. How as a young boy he would keep asking questions till he reaches a point where he realises that he is not getting the answers. 

 The boy then packs his bags, leaves town and lands up in Mumbai. To his surprise it is the city of Mumbai that is now asking him the questions. The promo picks up pace from here and goes on to show how having answered some of these questions, the young lads life comes a full circle. And now he is in a place where he is doing all the asking. 

 So, catch the first glimpse of 

 King Khan as the new host of KBC (picture above).

 Telly party 

 For the year-end telly party, 

 STAR World is making an offer tough to refuse. It all starts 

 on Saturday at 9 pm with the 40th Annual Country Music Awards, 

 being held in Nashville, Tennessee. Showcasing the best 

 of country music, the three-hour event features newcomers 

 and superstars alike. 

 Up next on Sunday, at noon, watch beauty in the making in Miss Teen USA 2006, the annual celebration of American youth and grace. Miss Teen USA spends her year building relationships with organisations committed to education and action, such as Best Buddies, Do Something and D.A.R.E.

 Pan-Indian tang to hotel course

 - Study 

 tie-up with Thai University 

 SUBHRO SAHA

 Tourist traffic to Southeast Asia is soaring every year as airfares keep crashing and new, alluring destinations keep cropping up. And since taste buds are inextricably linked with wanderlust, Oriental cuisine is unveiling its myriad magical mixes.

 Recognising the need to look eastwards for meaningful long-term bridges, a city B-school has swum against the UK-US tide and for the first time, tied up with a Thai campus for study and internship options in Thailand.

 An MoU, signed between Siam University (SU) hotel amp; tourism management international programme and Calcutta-based IIAS Group of Institutions (IIAS), acknowledges the two as active educational partners. 

 The purpose of this agreement is to facilitate the transfer of students from IIAS to SU. This will allow them to further their education as undergraduate students and supplementing their diploma earned at IIAS with a degree awarded by SU, explains Abhijit De, chairman and president, IIAS Group of Institutions.

 Students enrolling for the three-year course will have the option to study the final year in Thailand, including an internship stint at a five-star hotel there. 

 The course fee (approximately Rs 2.2 lakh) would be around 10 per cent higher for those who opt for the final year in SU. We will also organise a one-week familiarisation trip to Thailand during the first year itself, declares Moloy Dutta, senior assistant vice-president, operation, IIAS.

 This is a wonderful opportunity for city youths to study in a highly-evolved hospitality environment. We will also have faculty exchange as part of the pact, says Shaun Kenworthy, visiting faculty at the IIAS Ultadanga campus.

 Kenworthy, who is also on the advisory board of the IIAS Group, adds: In this industry, as a chef, you are as good as the last meal you cooked. Thailand has a very interesting food culture, with a presence of all three elements salt, sweet and sour in most of their dishes. This provides invaluable exposure to would-be chefs and F amp;B managers.

 The Thai university will recognise students education achievements in terms of credits earned during their studies at IIAS. The transfer articulation is specifically designed to allow transfer students from IIAS who satisfy the conditions set forth in the agreement to obtain a Bachelors degree in business administration majoring in hotel and tourism management within at least an additional year of successful studies at SU.

 In the West, we all start off peeling potatoes and you have to prove yourself all the time. Besides, there wont be anyone cleaning after you in the kitchen. Its the work ethic thats so important. An education alliance like this can also go a long way in popularising pan-Indian cuisine in Southeast Asia, and not just the done-to-death tandoori stuff, observes Kenworthy.

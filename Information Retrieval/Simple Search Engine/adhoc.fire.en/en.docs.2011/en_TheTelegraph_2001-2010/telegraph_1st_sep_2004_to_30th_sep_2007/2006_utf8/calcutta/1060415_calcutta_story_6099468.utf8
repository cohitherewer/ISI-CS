 This Baisakh, go easy on fish

 - Snare ban at river-sea confluence will lead to scarcity and price hike

 DEBASISH CHATTOPADHYAY

 Poila Baisakh brings bad tidings for fish-lovers this time. The first month of the Bengali new year will bring little cheer at the dining table, with Calcuttans having to cut down on hilsa, pabda, tangra, bhetki, aar, boal and parshe.

 The reason for the dry run is that fishermen will not be allowed to snare the tasty morsels at the confluence of the river and the sea, the source of a wide variety of fish, from April 15 to May 31.

 Rohu and katla, most of which come from Andhra Pradesh, will be the only options on the menu. With chicken already flying out of many a kitchen, the scarcity of fish will push up prices.

 The fisheries department is responsible for the ban. ?The circular says no fishermen will be allowed to catch fish in the sea from April 15 to May 31, because during this period, fish lay eggs. So, if we consume the egg-laying fish, the supply is bound to dwindle in future. Moreover, the mechanised boats of some fishermen pollute the water. The order may inconvenience fish-lovers, but it will ultimately be a blessing,? said Surajit Bag, district fisheries officer, South 24-Parganas.

 The order was issued last year, but was not implemented properly, added Bag. This time, an all-out effort will be made. The coast guard has already been alerted.

 The clampdown has created a stir in fish markets, and caused resentment among fishermen. Bimal Nag, president, Traders Federation of Calcutta Municipal Markets, said the directive would hit consumers as well. ?In the city, consumers are choosy. It would be better if the government implements the order in phases,? he said.

 Mahadeb Mondal, secretary, West Bengal Fishermen?s Association, felt the government should be more cautious before issuing such orders. ?It does not specify how fishermen will maintain their livelihood,? he alleged.

 Bag clarified that each registered fisherman would be given Rs 1,800 as compensation, alternative work like weaving nets and making papad from dry fish, and a Rs 1,200 health insurance cover for the period.

 What: 

 Dance Masti, kids dance party organised by Calcutta 

 Central Ladies Circle No 27. 

 Where: Big Ben at The Kenilworth. 

 When: April 9, afternoon. 

 Take a look: It was a house full of bubbling energy and limitless excitement as Big Ben played host to a guest list of a different kind this Sunday.

 Gathered at the club were more than 250 children, enjoying their summer day out to the brim. The decor was as cute as the guests with bunches of silver and baby pink balloons with many twirls of glossy ribbons adding colour and funk to the venue. 

 The agenda seemed simple: dance till you drop. But if you thought Ashs jhatkas and matkas were reserved for the adult discs alone, you should have been there at Big Ben to see the young ones have a blast. Sundays party saw Kajra re, Dhoom and Dus bahane rocking the floor and the kids going berserk.

 Another corner hosted a magic 

 show to engage the tinier tots. Also on the fun list were 

 lucky draws along with a sports and Bollywood quiz. Masti 

 unplugged it was.

 Sip n bite: 

 The menu was short and simple and consisted of kids 

 favourite munchies like chips, sandwiches, pizzas and pastries. 

 This teamed with an endless supply of chilled cola and orange, 

 the children couldnt have asked for more.

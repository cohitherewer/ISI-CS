Its arguably Calcuttas biggest style extravaganza 

in a long time, with a line-up that reads like the Indian fashion roster. With 

four style stalwarts Tarun Tahiliani, Rocky S, Rohit Gandhi amp; Rahul Khanna 

and Manish Malhotra showing back to back in a span of two days, the Calcutta 

edition of the Blenders Pride Fashion Tour 2006 is as big as it gets.

While Tarun and Rocky will rock the ramp at The Oberoi 

Grand ballroom on Friday evening, Saturday evening will wrap up the event with 

shows by Manish and Rohit amp; Rahul. The event is being organised in association 

with The Oberoi Grand.

This is my fifth year with Blenders Pride and 

I have always opted for the Calcutta shows. I have quite a good market here. Though 

I dont retail in this city, I get a lot of Calcutta clients at my Mumbai 

store, Rocky tells GoodLife from Mumbai.

The designer will showcase a collection from his Noir 

line, meant for the end of fall-winter and beginning of spring-summer.

The look is innocent, very feminine, soft 

and fluid. The line has a look of a girl lost in the woods, explains 

Rocky. All in pastels icy blue, soft peach and baby pink.

Tarun, in contrast, is set to show a rich and heavy 

diffusion look for fall-winter. I will showcase my fall-winter line that 

I had unveiled at the India Fashion Week in April. The look is very dressy, for 

winter festivities and parties; I have added a few heavy pieces to my IFW line, 

reveals Tarun.

The line might be a little too much for Calcutta, 

but I cant tailor my collection to every city. My look is my look; a city 

has to grow up to it, declares the designer.

The look is opulent and luxurious, in trademark Tarun 

style, with the designers signature jewels. Sun-kissed bronze, rust, ochre, 

antique gold and burnt umber highlighted by ivory and the colours of the night 

on silks, satins and velvet fabrics underline the creations. The silhouettes, 

though form fitted, are comfortable, and fabrics have the feel and fall of luxury. 

The line focuses on jamevar and the intricacies of Victorian lace textures.

The show over, Taruns collection will be displayed 

at 85 Lansdowne between 11 am and 7.30 pm on Saturday. I want to understand 

the local market. Though I get a lot of top-end bridal orders from Calcutta, I 

dont know the market much, he admits.

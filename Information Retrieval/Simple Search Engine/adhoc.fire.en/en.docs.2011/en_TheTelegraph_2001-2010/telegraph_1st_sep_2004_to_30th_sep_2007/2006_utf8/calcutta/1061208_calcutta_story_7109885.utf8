 What: Exhibition of Mughal jewellery collection 

 from the house of Bharanys.

 Take a look: Bharanys, a Delhi-based house of 

 jewellery crafting and textile designing, specialises in 

 the production of handcrafted ethnic Mughal jewellery and 

 textiles. 

 The new wedding line includes 

 Magars or long earrings, tapering with fishes to bring 

 harmony to the newly-weds, pachelis or bracelets 

 that are symposiums of flowers to bring happiness 

 and bangris or bangles formed like the overflowing 

 cup to symbolise abundance. 

 Other pieces are tinmaniyas, 

 chokers, necklaces, bangles and belt buckles. Each piece 

 is enamelled on the reverse, and set with precious stones 

 like rubies, emeralds and diamonds. 

 Voiceover: Bharany is an extremely coveted brand 

 and we are proud to be associated with them. It is part 

 of our constant endeavour to bring the best of national 

 and international brands to Calcutta, said Kavita 

 Khaitan from Prana.

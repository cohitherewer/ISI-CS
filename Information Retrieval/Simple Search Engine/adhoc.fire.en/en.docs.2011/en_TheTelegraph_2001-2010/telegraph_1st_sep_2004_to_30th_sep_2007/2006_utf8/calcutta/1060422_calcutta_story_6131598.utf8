The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Comedy comeback

Stage On amp; Off

 The moon over the bamboo thicket and the incense-filled burning ghat is filling the spirits (the entire range of bhoot, petni, bemmodoitti, shakchunni etc) with longing. That?s Parashuram?s classic comedy Bhusundir Mathey, which is about to make a comeback in a double cassette audio drama, featuring the likes of Kharaj Mukherjee, Srikanta Acharya, Haimanti Shukla, Subhankar, Shubhomita, Paran Bandopadhyay and Jojo.

 Rajshekhar Basu?s story, dramatised by Amitabha Chaudhury, has been presented on stage by Ajantrik since 1983. The humorous songs written by Chaudhury and set to music by Sujit Chatterjee have contributed greatly to the play?s popularity. ?But it is important for people to have access to classics like these all the time. We have roped in a lot of talented artistes from the TV and music worlds,? says Sandip Chatterjee, owner of production company Shloke Entertainment.

 Singer Srikanta is most excited about the project. ?Bhusundir Mathey has been a great favourite for a very long time. Kharaj used to act in it when we were in St Xavier?s, and also used to sing the songs at our addas. Later, I saw the play at Muktangan and was very impressed. The songs seemed perfect ? the tunes were as rich and sensitive as the lyrics were funny. I think we have a lot of space for this kind of subtle humour,? says Srikanta, who has sung two tracks. All 16 songs of the musical are based on Hindustani classical music that occasionally blends with the Carnatic style, like the Shivaranjani raga and Bhojpuri music, says composer Sujit Chatterjee. 

 The audio cassettes will reach the market by the beginning of May. This may be followed by an animated version for television.

 The Creative Arts stages

 The Creative Arts?s Upon a 

 Yarn, co-presented by Kora, strikes viewers with its 

 imaginative content and flexible use of space inside Kanishka 

 on Hindusthan Road. It is a brief, 40-minute reminiscing 

 of women?s lives from childhood to death, the stories seamlessly 

 stitched together into a quilt-like structure, sourced from 

 stories in Jhumpa Lahiri?s Interpreter of Maladies 

 like A Temporary Matter and This Blessed House, 

 and poems by Calcutta-based Arthur Cardozo. 

 Most movingly, it imparts to objects like textiles and saris a permanence beyond human mortality, showing that they carry inscribed within them the personalities of their owners, lasting much after those women themselves have perished. 

 This is the best manifestation of Ramanjit Kaur?s direction that I have witnessed so far since she started The Creative Arts four years ago, mainly because of its conciseness and her economy of expression, yet conveying sensitively the relationships and bonding in female lives. 

 Unlike many women activists, she does not banish men from this magic circle ? her balanced cast consists of four men and three women. Sanika Kakirde?s costumes are artistic, while the decor by Samik Chakraborty and Piali Sadhukhan creatively transforms the sunken wooden stairwell at the back of Kanishka. 

 However, the choice of I Could Have Danced All Night on the soundtrack did not gel with the mood of the production.

 Further performances of Upon a Yarn will be held at Kanishka over the weekend.

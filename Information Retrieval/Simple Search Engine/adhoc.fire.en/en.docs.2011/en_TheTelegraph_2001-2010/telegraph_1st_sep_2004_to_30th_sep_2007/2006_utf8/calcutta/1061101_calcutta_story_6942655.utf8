 Landlord grilled for arrest

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Police are grilling Ajay Chaudhury, who had rented out two rooms on the first floor of his CN Roy Road house, in Tiljala, to two youths arrested on Saturday night by a Delhi Police team on a murder charge.

 The two had holed up in the house for three weeks.

 A team grilled Chaudhury for hours on Monday night and again on Tuesday evening, trying to ascertain why the 42-year-old, who runs a restaurant and a cable business, had not dug deep into the background of the two youths before letting them in as tenants.

 Chaudhury even did not ask them to fill up the tenants form while accepting Rs 3,000 from them as advance.

 Chaudhury claimed that he did not doubt their identity after they produced student identity cards. They told him they would stay for a short period. Chaudhury said he would have checked their identity at the time of signing the final agreement, said a senior officer of Tiljala police station.

 Late on October 28, a Delhi Police team swooped down on the Tiljala house and arrested Yogesh Sharma and Sri Bhagwan, alias Manu. An officer said the duo had murdered Sunder Lal Jain, a businessman based in New Delhis Chandni Chowk.

What: Launch of Diamond Dimensions, a jewellery 

house.

 When: April 7.

 Where: 19B Jawaharlal Nehru Road. 

 Take a look: Spread over two floors, this design den promises to redefine the luxury of picking and choosing diamond necklaces, earrings, rings, pendants and nose pins. Semi-precious and precious stones are set alongside diamonds to create stunning designer pieces. Theres also quite a platinum range. Other than the usual ladies designs in earrings and chains, the sparkling metal also finds favour in a collection of subtle bands for the metrosexual male. 

 Pocket pinch: Prices begin at Rs 3,500. A special inaugural offer is on till April 15.

 Voiceover: Diamond Dimensions stands for exotic designs, authentic products with lifelong service warranty and a competitive buy-back policy, said partner Sanjay Modi.

 Kid couture

 What: The summer collection launch at Studio 119.

 When: April 5.

 Where: 119 Park Street.

 Take a look: Kurtas, churidars, dhotis, sherwanis, ghagras, dresses ? the collection comprised all this and more, designed especially for kids. All the outfits were accessorised with co-ordinated bags, shoes, hair gear, bangles and hats. The ready stocks are made to fit youngsters up to 13 years. You can also get an outfit custom-made for your teenager.

 Pocket pinch: The outfits are priced between Rs 350 and Rs 3,500.

 Voiceover: Calcutta is an expanding fashion market, but with practically nothing fashionable for the young ones. Studio 119 is a design hub for the age-bracket one to 19, smiled Bhavna Khemani, designer and proprietor of this address.

 Bridal bazaar

 What: A Rendezvous? With Indian Weddings, an exhibition put up by NiFD students.

 Where: 20A, Lindsay Street, Humayun Court, second floor.

 When: April 8.

 Take a look: As a part of their curriculum, 40 students from third and second semester diploma courses and second year degree course put up this project. The colourful display drew inspiration from wedding cultures across the country. The states depicted were Rajasthan, Goa, West Bengal, Meghalaya, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Kerala.

 Participants draped themselves in their own creations and also served traditional food, in sync with the state they represented. In the Rajasthan corner, there were young designers draped in pretty orange and deep red ghagras adorned with intricate embellishments. Illustrations showcased models of typical traditional villages, mandaps along with tiny tots posing as the dulha dulhan and the purohit.

 In Goa, it was an eclectic blend of a Roman Catholic wedding and some Goan funk. The girls here were dressed in eye-catching white gowns. Punjab found women in embroidered ensembles putting on mehendi, while Gujarat had saris with traditional motifs. A traditional outfit of Meghalaya was draped interestingly with a western wrap in black and ochre, while the Bengal corner had women displaying saris in traditional reds and oranges.

 The judges ? directors John and Susan Mantosh, designer duo Dev and Nil and former model Piu Sarkar ? ruled for Rajasthan in both Overall Presentation and Peoples Choice.

 Voiceover: The students worked for about a month with the faculty approving of dresses and props. The event allows them to put forward their creations as well as have fun, said Ruth Patchiah, regional head, NiFD.

 Shoe stunner

 What: Launch of Namrata Kanois bridal collection of bags and footwear.

 Where: At Kali, 17/1E Alipore Road, Anant Apartments. 

 When: April 11. The collection will be available at the store all month. 

 Take a look: The footwear collection comprises formal designs and chic summer wear. While the formal range is about ornate embellishments with metallic coins, stones and intricate embroidery, the casual range boasts eye-catching buckles in funky shapes and light embroidery.

 Slings, clutches, beaded bags, formal money bags and cocktail purses are also a part of the collection. A lot of metallic leather and brocade have been used. The colour story in this collection revolves around neutrals and common colours like gold, red, white, blues and blacks.

 I have steered away from odd hues that make an accessory so restrictive and hence seldom wearable, explains Namrata.

 Pocket pinch: Between Rs 1,100 and Rs 1,500.

 Voiceover: The current collection is quite formal and has a glitzy appeal to it ? perfect for a summer night out, says the young designer.

 Inside out

 What: Bra-tops from Necessity.

 Where: Necessity The Bra Store at 9, Hindustan Park.

 Take a look: The fancy bra-tops can be described as bustiers that can be teamed with skirt, jeans or sari. The collection comes in a wide range of colours from grey, brown and ivory off-white to brighter shades like red and turquoise blue.

 The material is a mix of high-quality fabrics: suede, velvet, jacquard, fine satin, embossed and embellished textures.

 The store has also expanded to a spacious 500 sq ft, flaunting freshly done interiors in shades of pale pink and peach.

 Pocket pinch: The range is made-to-order and is priced upwards of Rs 2,000.

 Voiceover: The bra-tops are made to size, which means the cuts will depend on the customers body. One can also choose ones material, says Necessity proprietor Swati Gautam, who feels the niche product has a great demand because the mass-made products are all similar and come in limited shades.

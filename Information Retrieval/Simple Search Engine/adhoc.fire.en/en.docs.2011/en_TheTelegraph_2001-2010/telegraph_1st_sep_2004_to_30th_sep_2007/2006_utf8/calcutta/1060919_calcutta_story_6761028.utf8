 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has given the nod to mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyyas proposal to turn Calcutta Panorama at Town Hall into a full-fledged museum.

 Earlier this month, the mayor had approached the chief minister, who is also ex-officio chairman of the 10-member Calcutta Museum Society, with a proposal for revamping the story-telling museum. 

 The civic authorities have started drafting a proposal of revamping Calcutta Panorama, which is currently incurring an annual loss of Rs 40 lakh. After the proposal is passed by the museum society, it will be placed in the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) house for ratification, post-Puja. 

 The civic officials plan to approach the citizens for collecting artefacts, which will be displayed in the museum, said municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay. 

 We want tourists to get a feel of Calcuttas rich heritage and tradition, said the mayor.

 Apart from renovating the Town Hall, a Rs 2-crore beautification and conservation scheme is also being planned for heritage-compatible commercial utilisation of space on the campus and the basement of the building, said Town Hall director Dipankar Sinha.

 Town Hall was renovated at a cost of over Rs 3 crore in 1998, with the active collaboration of commercial houses in the city. A fund of Rs 1 crore was raised by selling paintings of Bikash Bhattacharya. The rest was borne by the CMC and the state.

If you are stylish, so is your house. Theres no doubting that your pad reflects loads of style and character and the style story is carried into the bathroom too ? spick and span, textured tiles, a modish jacuzzi and beautiful shower curtains?

 But hey, do we spot shabby plastic soap cases and worn-out holders with toothpaste, brushes and razors in a corner of the wash basin? This just doesnt go with the rest of the room.

 Wondering what to replace the junk with? Porcelain bathroom accessories from Nik Nish at 22 Camac Street could be your pick.

 A complete set includes a soap case, toothbrush holder, paste holder and a liquid soap container. Imported from China, it is the dog clan that dominates here. Each set illustrates Mr Doggy in various moods ? sitting alert, relaxing or at play.

 One set has Poodles in pristine white, with ears and tails a cheerful yellow. Another with colourful polkas all over and a red muffler around the neck is yet to get over the winters. Those in sunny brown are adorable, too.

 With the fashion week fad still on, the Swiss cows seem to have drawn some inspiration. Along with patches in black or blue each has put on large stylish shades in electric red. Smiley green frogs with bulging eyes and a broad grin also jostle for attention.

 Gifting is not only about giving a token of love that is appealing, but an item that is a combination of looks and utility. These accessories fit the bill and are flying off the racks fast, reveals Kamal Baheti from the store.

 For the sporty kind with little time for the animal kingdom, footballs should find favour. With the Champions League semis in full swing and the World Cup less than two months away, these footballs come in splashes of red and blue.

 Some in stripes resemble beach recliners. Feminine ones with thin floral borders look pretty. 

 If love is in the air, heart-shaped accessories in pink and mauve, with broad red borders is sure to catch your eye. The sober ones are peppered with yellows and blacks. Some in linear patterns have squarish designs in indigo blue and then there are those in combinations of solid pink and slate.

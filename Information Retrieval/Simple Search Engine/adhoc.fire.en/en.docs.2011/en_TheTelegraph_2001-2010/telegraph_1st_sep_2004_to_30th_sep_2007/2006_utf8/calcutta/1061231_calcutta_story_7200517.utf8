The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Life

 Glam girl on the greens

 ANUMITA GHOSH

 Its a Calcutta performance, the second time this month, and take my word, I already feel good. The spirit of the city is very high and the food is good, says Manasi Scott in her trademark deep voice.

 While the Lufthansa airlines launch performance earlier this month was good fun, the vivacious vocalist is all set to rock bigger with her second show The Telegraph 31st Nite at the Royal Calcutta Golf Club (RCGC).

 In the past two years, I have been to Calcutta a number of times. The audience is discerning, they appreciate talent, is Manasis verdict on the citys party people. People spend a handful to see you perform; one cannot let them down, she adds.

 So the glamour girl is determined to put together a rocking show on Sunday, which also happens to be her birthday. 

 Going through last-minute rehearsals, the Capricorn counts on audience appreciation as her birthday present.

 As for the celebrations, the birthday girl is all for a family affair: My husband and child are travelling with me. Hopefully, my parents should be there too!

 A Calcutta band will accompany Manasi, but that should not strike a wrong chord on stage. I had already sent them VCDs of my performances and songs. So things should work out fine, adds the former software professional.

 aborating on her Sunday performance, the globetrotter who has performed in the US, Canada and Spain, observes: For a New Years Eve performance, the energy level has to be high. Everyone wants to have fun and be on the dance floor. I have geared up for a power-packed performance that includes a lot of audience interaction. My repertoire will be quite open latest Hindi movie hits and English numbers. If security is not an issue, I might even touch down on the dance floor shaking a leg or two with the audience.

 Manasi admits things have been different since Naach Le, the album in 2005. The concerts are larger than life, events woven around your concept During the making of the album in 2003-2004, I went through voice training for the first time. Over the years I have grown. The seriousness and dedication is more. 

 Dwelling on the advantages and disadvantages of trained versus untrained singers, Manasi says: In live singing, a trained vocalist makes all the effort to get his/her notes perfect. The rendition of an untrained singer is all about tunes from the heart and soul. I try and get the best of both worlds.

 Manasis next album is nearing completion. Featuring 24-instrument man Raghav Sachar in some parts, it is a compilation of 16 songs. The album is all about pop, jazz, the rains, some fantastic shows, good memories Inspirations have come from all walks of life, she reveals. 

 That is not all. Manasi is all set for her second innings in acting. I featured in the first 30 episodes of the Star Plus serial Miilee. However, international performances came along and I had to quit, says the all-rounder, who hosted the Wisden Cricket Awards for ESPN-STAR Sports in 2004 and the Bollywood Fashion Show in the US in 2002 and 2003 among many other feats. 

 So how does Manasi juggle it all? As a performer, youve got to be able to whip them up with equal ease, she smiles.

 The once wannabe fighter pilot, going ga-ga over Tom Cruise in Top Gun, also dreams of making it into playback singing.

 It is a different ball game altogether. I do not have the standard Bollywood voice, but the industry is changing. Music direction can follow, she signs off.

PET PASSION

 What dogs? These are my children, little people with fur who make my heart grow a little wider ? Oprah Winfrey on her cocker spaniels Sophie and Solomon.

 Ronnie in Mumbai and Nutty in Calcutta, and their doting human parents ? I just had to write on them. Ronnie came to the Dattas as a gift when their child shifted base to the UK. Ronnie is gentle and affectionate, yet full of life and exuberance.

 Though I haven?t met Nutty, I have seen some beautiful pictures of him with Dr Apurba Ghosh and can?t get over his soulful cocker eyes. So here?s to the popular pet with merry disposition and ever-wagging tail.

 General appearance: Cocker spaniel is the smallest member of the sporting group. It has a sturdy compact body and a clean chiselled head. He is capable of considerable speed, combined with great endurance.

 Temperament: Most cocker spaniels have a friendly, affectionate and kind nature. They make wonderful family pets and are very faithful. They are amongst the most popular of all dogs worldwide. And because of their medium size, they are adaptable to various environments.

 Exercise: They need a moderate amount of exercise, a brisk walk for 20-30 minutes in the morning and evening. Or else, they will become couch potatoes.

 Training: Sensitivity may be their only drawback because discipline must be inculcated in a gentle manner, or else a cocker spaniel will wilt. As sweet as the breed generally is, the untrained cocker can be a handful. A dog trainer is unnecessary as long as the puppy is gently taught to sit, stay and come on command, and can walk on a leash without pulling.

 Health: Well-bred cockers are subject to few diseases or genetic abnormalities but look for a puppy whose parents have been cleared for progressive retinal atrophy, a genetic eye disease that causes blindness. Also make sure they are free of heart problems and epilepsy. Cataract, glaucoma and haemophilia can be other problems, as can chronic skin and ear infections.

 Grooming: Try to give your cocker a quick brush and comb daily. Once a week, give him a thorough comb and brushing to keep the coat soft and silky.

 Cocker ears: Cocker ears hang downwards and are prone to infection, as the long ears prevent air circulation. They should be taught from an early age to have their ears handled because they will need to be groomed to remove dirt, tied back to encourage air circulation and cleaned in case of infection. Check the ears daily and if there is dirt, use a medicated solution to clean them; never water or alcohol. To avoid injury, use cotton balls or a bit of cotton on a finger; not a cotton bud. In summer, make sure the hair inside the ears is trimmed short.

 Cockers should be fed in deep narrow bowls so that they eat and drink without getting their ears in the food and drink.

 A word of caution: Good temperament depends on good breeding practices. Backyard breeders have flooded the market with poorly bred cocker spaniels that are snappy, high-strung and difficult to handle. Please remember it?s where you get your puppies from that make them a good breed. Always buy a cocker spaniel from an experienced specialist breeder.

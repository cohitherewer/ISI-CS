 Roman holiday: 

 romancing the ramp 

 Shes the second 

 Indian designer, and the only one this year, to have been 

 invited to show at the Rome Couture Week. Kiran Uttam 

 Ghosh recounts how the land of Valentino and Versace 

 made her dream come true 

 KIRANS 

 CALL

 Glimpses from Kirans 

 show at the Rome Couture Week

 Everyone, 

 soon or late, comes round by Rome. When Stefano Dominella 

 from Alta Roma invited me to show at Rome Fashion Week 2006, 

 that Robert Browning line came to mind. I felt a little 

 like Gregory Peck when he first saw Audrey Hepburn in Roman 

 Holiday a little short of breath.

 Rome, the land of Valentino and 

 Versace, has its own place in the world of fashion weeks. 

 Its a city that has, apart from the Romans, a population 

 of statues. Its been high on style since the toga. 

 In some ways, it reminds me of 

 Calcutta replete with history, a city that knows its cabbages 

 as well as it does its kings. Both cities have, of course, 

 rewritten traffic rules.

 I couldnt have asked for 

 a more impressive venue The prestigious Parco De la Musica 

 where legends like Bob Dylan have performed.

 I took with me the pinstripe collection, 

 a masculine yet feminine line. 

 Down the ages, the pinstripe has 

 been the preserve of the powerful, the legacy of the lads. 

 In an age where gender is passe, and women are the new men, 

 it seemed like the perfect time to usher in the pinstripe 

 and fuse it with female fashion. 

 The Rome collection had cufflinks 

 jostling with brooches, Kolhapuris colliding with wedges, 

 shirts pitted against saris.

 Backstage was a tower of Babel, 

 with liberal doses of Hindi, English, Italian and even Czech, 

 given the cocktail of local and Indian models and helpers. 

 At one point I thought I felt 

 Bob Dylan whisper over my shoulder, chaos is a friend 

 of mine.

 To make things worse, just two 

 hours before the show, celebrity make-up artist Carlo Pinca 

 pancaked model Lakshmi Ranas face stark white, as 

 the sample look for the show. And then, to counter the horror 

 on my face, he turned her chocolatey. 

 I dont know what turn 

 means in Italian, but when I asked an Italian model to turn 

 around, she removed her garment in a flourish! 

 With 30 seconds to go, Ive 

 never dressed anyone faster. Crisis, in retrospect, always 

 sounds funny, but this was fodder for a heart attack!

 Eventually, as I took the catwalk 

 and namaste-d the crowd, I realised we had a packed 

 house. Some of the most fashion-savvy press of the world 

 was applauding.

 The next day, with some time to 

 kill, I went to the Trevi Fountain. Fable has it that if 

 you throw a coin in and make a wish, you return to Rome.

 Theyve just mailed me to 

 be a part of Rome Couture Week again... Que Sera Sera.

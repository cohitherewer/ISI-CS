 An image makeover begins at the 

 top. If you thought otherwise, you should have been at the 

 second regional final of the LOreal Professional Colour 

 Trophy 2006 held at ITC Sonar Bangla Sheraton amp; Towers 

 on Saturday night. 

 The event saw 27 hairdressing 

 talents from the east zone battling it out. They snipped 

 and trimmed, cut and chopped, and worked away to give radical 

 makeovers to their models and reveal an array of glamorous 

 hair colours and styles. 

 The LOreal Professional 

 Colour Trophy is held in 31 countries worldwide. In India 

 it was held for the second time. This event celebrates 

 creativity, fashion, professionalism and passion. Calcutta 

 stylists have great potential and the entries have only 

 got better than the last time, says Smira Bakshi, 

 manager, L Oreal Professional Colour Trophy, India. 

 Before the main event on Saturday, 

 workshops threw light on interesting techniques, styles 

 and stage presence. For the hair stylist sharing ramp 

 space with his/her model for the first time, these are great 

 confidence boosters, said Smira. 

 The Calcutta leg followed the 

 first regional final in Bangalore. The north and west zone 

 finals are scheduled to be held on August 11 and 16 respectively. 

 Winners from these elimination rounds make it to the grand 

 finale to be held at Grand Hyatt Mumbai on September 26 

 and 27. 

 An international panel of judges 

 presided over the initial photo entry level. There were 

 more than 300 regional photo entries. Out of the 50 plus 

 entries from the east, 27 were called to east zone round 

 in Calcutta.

 The judges for the evening were 

 fashion designer Kiran Uttam Ghosh, photographer Colstan 

 Julian, make-up artist Michelle Tung, publisher of the Ogaan 

 group Archana Pillai and winner of the first LOreal 

 Professional Colour Trophy in India and Cosmopolitan Fashion 

 Award, Neeru Radhakrishnan. 

 Contestants were judged on the 

 basis of how international a look was, its universal appeal, 

 the techniques involved: the cut, colouring process, the 

 flow, movement and the extent of hair quality retained. 

 Last but not the least, whether 

 the hairstyle was in sync with the models overall 

 style and persona. From frizzy locks to poker straight razors 

 to soft fringes to voluptuous curls, one saw it all. And 

 the colour palette was a riot of hues cool coppers, bright 

 oranges, burgundy, purple, honey blonde While some tress 

 lengths went below the shoulder level, some kept it to the 

 shoulders and others shot up to the nape as well. 

 One of the three primary categories 

 for which participants were competing was the New Generation 

 Award. This is for budding hairstylists below the age of 

 25 and in the first year of their careers. Out of the eight 

 participants, Sunita Thakuri of Satin Rose and Shakeel Ahmed 

 of Head Turners walked away with the trophies.

 Male models showcased cool colours 

 and snazzy cuts for the Mens Image Award, a challenge 

 to create a hairstyle for men. There were eight contestants 

 here, too. Manoj of Hair N Face, Jamshedpur, 

 was judged runner-up in this category, while C. Lalkhumtira 

 of A.N. John was crowned winner.

 The third and the most coveted 

 was the Colour Trophy Award. And why not? The winner of 

 Colour Trophy, India, besides intensive training, gets a 

 chance to go to the UK for training with a top academy, 

 an exclusive seat at the UK Colour Trophy, opportunity to 

 work with top fashion magazines and goes on to become the 

 judge for the LOreal Professional Colour Trophy, India, 

 in 2007. 

 Th event was the showstealer. 

 There were 11 contestants. Rakesh Kaushal of A.N. John bagged 

 the first place. Saddique Alam of Head Turners and Susan 

 Francis of Kesh Twacha walked away with the first and second 

 runners-up trophies. 

 There were definitely some 

 good hands. But some overdid it, felt Colstan. This 

 is a great platform that blends creativity with opportunity. 

 There were definitely some sparks, said Kiran.

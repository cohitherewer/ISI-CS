The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Shared vision, joint effort

 - Umbrella initiative to re-brand, improve and promote city

 SUBHRO SAHA

 London 

 First: Christmas lighting scheme on Oxford Street, 

 regeneration of the Paddington station area, transformation 

 of the Docklands and Canary Wharf into world-class business 

 centre?

 Calcutta First: 

 Cleaner and friendlier Dum Dum airport, directional signage, 

 a reborn Park Street and Dalhousie Square, a mega festival 

 as top tourist draw, a rejuvenated riverfront...

 Re-branding Calcutta tops the agenda of Calcutta First, a cross-sector lobbying body taking shape on the contours of London First, a non-profit-making company launched in the early 1990s as a vehicle to improve and promote London.

 ?London First is surely the inspiration, if not the role model. The idea is not to duplicate efforts of a CMC or a CMDA here, but to work with a shared vision and try and bring piecemeal initiatives under one broad umbrella,? Indian Chamber of Commerce secretary-general Nazeeb Arif, a prime mover, tells Metro.

 Besides blending its heritage and its contemporary outlook, Calcutta First is about leveraging the city?s core strengths, providing a definitive roadmap and being involved from ideation to implementation.

 ?It?s a very good idea,? says industry secretary Sabyasachi Sen. ?This is more like a huge public-private partnership, which could work wonders for the city if all the stakeholders can be engaged gainfully. The government departments will provide all the support.?

 Urban renewal of critical zones like Dalhousie Square, Park Street, the riverfront or the old brick-building quarters of north Calcutta will very much be on the cards for Calcutta First. ?These proposals are aligned with the chief minister?s overall vision plan for Brand Bengal, and we want Buddhababu to be chief patron,? says Sumit Dabriwal, managing director of Calcutta Metropolitan Group, who is joined by the likes of Forum MD Rahul Saraf on board.

 For starters, Calcutta First has designed Discover Calcutta booklets offering basic information, to be distributed at the airport and hotels.

 Calcutta First also draws impetus from Bombay First, driven by the Bombay Chamber of Commerce amp; Industry, to improve socio-economic infrastructure of Mumbai.

Why would a successful documentary film-maker like you try his hand at mainstream 

Bollywood?

The 260-odd channels on Indian television have killed 

the space for documentaries. They prefer low-budget soaps. My documentaries are 

expensive because I shoot in places like Afghanistan and Burma with an international 

political backdrop. They have to be commissioned by international bodies from 

the US or Europe or networks like Discovery. While channels like NSK in Japan 

and Canal in France buy my films, they do not get seen in India. Thats frustrating 

for any communicator. So I missed being seen in my country and I thought a feature 

film would be a good idea.

How did you cater to the commercial aspects of the industry while making Kabul 

Express?

There was no commercial consideration while making 

the film. There are not even elements of what people call crossover. And thats 

what producer Aditya Chopra liked about my script it was fresh, it was new. 

He told me not to get diluted by any commercial aspects. John Abraham and Arshad 

Warsi, who signed the film even before Yash Raj Films came on board, liked Kabul 

Express the way it was. I could have put in a gypsy song if I wanted to, but 

I would not have been needed to make a normal mainstream film.

Why did you go to Yash Raj known mainly for their romantic movies?

They called me. I was doing the regular rounds of 

producers with my script. I didnt know anybody in Mumbai. I was a documentary 

film-maker from Delhi who had shifted to Mumbai just five years back. And my idea 

was too radical for these producers. They all loved my idea but they did not put 

their money where their mouth was. Yash Raj came forward and backed me totally.

Were you tempted to cast the Shah Rukhs and Aamirs with the Yash Raj banner behind 

you?

 Yash Raj did ask me to pick and choose anybody but 

I had no such temptations. Arshad was an old friend who was with me right through 

the scripting stage. John too had committed to do the film. They were both keen 

to go and shoot in Afghanistan. And that was important to me more than casting 

people who would do the film because it was a Yash Raj production.

You have already made two documentaries on post-Taliban Afghanistan. Did you have 

to tamper with the realities for Kabul Express?

Yes, I made The Taliban Years and Beyond and 

The Titanic Sinks in Kabul. In Kabul Express, certain incidents 

were straight from the documentaries. There are many things you can show in a 

feature film that you cant show in a documentary. I wanted to show those off-camera 

moments in Kabul Express. The script was changed to make it into an entertaining 

story.

I did glorify some of the scenes in the film but at 

places I had to tone it down. Because the incidents were so bizarre that people 

would have found them crap if I kept them like they were. We were in Tajikistan 

for 14 days trying to somehow sneak into Kabul. Finally, we bribed a Russian military 

captain and he took us in his helicopter over the Hindu Kush mountains. We were 

dropped from the chopper in a no mans land and there was this burly Mujahideen 

interrogating us. When he heard we were Indians, he actually broke off into Hindi 

film songs. If I had shown that, people would have thought it was my attempt at 

slapstick comedy.

Was it less dangerous to shoot a big-budget feature film as opposed to a small 

documentary?

When we shot the documentary, we were in middle of 

the action and we had no idea what we were getting into. When we shot the feature, 

we were just recreating that period. But small-scale wars were still on in Afghanistan, 

the Talibans were around and there were landmines here and there. As a documentary 

maker with my two or three member crew I could blend in the background. I could 

grow a stubble, dress up like an Afghan and hang around the most dangerous of 

places. But with a feature film crew of 70 to 80 people, it was a spectacle, a 

mela. We were naturally a target of the Taliban.

You must be used to death threats but the Taliban must have sent ripples across 

your cast and crew

While making documentaries, I am not used to such 

threats. There, I may step into a minefield or get caught in a crossfire but when 

somebody actually targets you, thats something else. Also, here I was taking 

the responsibility of more than 70 people and taking a decision was a tough one. 

At one point of time, when the Taliban threatened John and Arshad, I almost aborted 

the shoot. And that would have meant that the film could not have been completed 

because no other place in the world resembles Afghanistan. But then I did background 

checks with the Afghan and Indian intelligences and the government there gave 

us 60 armed guards.

Now that you have shot both, what do you prefer shooting feature films or documentaries?

Both have their own thrills. My friends often ask 

me whether it is a bye-bye to documentaries, now that I have made a feature. But 

I want to continue doing both forms of cinema. Because my documentaries form the 

raw materials for my feature scripts. Also, they are more personal. There are 

many things that you cant do while shooting a feature. It is so unpredictable.

Will you do a full round of festivals before the commercial release?

Kabul Express is premiering at the Toronto 

International Film Festival next month. We have also got very good feelers from 

Pusan. But we are keen to release the film commercially rather than do the full 

round of festivals. We feel the film will be immensely enjoyed by Indian audiences.

 You share your birthday with...

 Shania Twain

 Youre pleasant, sociable and friendly. You avoid chaos and distraction. You crave for diversity on the job. Youre a good administrator; theres no malice in you. A little stubborn, you shun hard work. Versatile and spontaneous, you learn quickly and easily. You never forget a favour or opportunity granted to you. Kusum Bhandari

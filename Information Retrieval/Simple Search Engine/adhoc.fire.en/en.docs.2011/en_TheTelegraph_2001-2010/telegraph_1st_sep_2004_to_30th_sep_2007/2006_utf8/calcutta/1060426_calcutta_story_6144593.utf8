 Four new faces present their New Works at the CIMA Gallery exhibition beginning Wednesday evening. They represent the new generation of artists coming to the fore in West Bengal. Three of them use traditional skills and crafts enriched by their training abroad to express themselves, while the fourth employs the devices of popular art. 

 All four of them have something in common ? at some point of time, they were all trained at Santiniketan, although their modes of expression are divergent.

 To begin with the most senior of them ? Shreyasi Chatterjee ? who teaches art at Rabindra Bharati University. Her inspiration being domesticity and her interest lying in the traditional craft of stitching, she has created a series of works using textiles, thread and sometimes spangles and beads that hark back to the embroidered pieces of cloth, often with adages, that used to be proudly displayed in Bengali homes half a century ago.

 Chatterjee, however, distorts and exaggerates certain elements in these, carefully folding the material whereby each acquires an identity of its own along with its overlay of memories. 

 As an extension of her interest, she has collaged the detailed lay-out of a home, which is reflected in the ?designer? costume on display.

 Chatterjee has also done a series of fine drawings where everyday objects turn into delicate webs of filament, as it were, like the woof and weft of life.

 Both Kingshuk Sarkar and Rashmi Bagchi Sarkar were trained in calligraphy and Sumi painting in Japan and both use the technique of iwa-enogu employing stone pigment, animal glue and cotton stretched on panel, and often gold, creating a smooth surface which sparkles when the light catches the stone particles.

 In Rashmi?s intricately detailed works she creates strong images of femininity that she equates with nature?s regenerative powers. She sits in a field where a mango tree is in fruit, while the saplings thrust their heads out of the seeds. In a beautiful work, tumbleweed floats around the fast-disappearing red soil of Santiniketan.

 Kingshuk produces compositions that are eye-catching when he uses brilliant colours and either an exaggerated body part or a collage of images where a wide range of images are placed next to each other. There are ?quotes? from Indian miniatures as in the painting of the man with a gun.

 Application of colour itself can be a point of interest in Kingshuk?s work. The colony of ants has a rich backdrop of viridian and red paint trickling down the surface like a stream of colours. His image of the thumb sticking out attracts immediate attention if only for its monumentality. However, the crocodile shedding tears looks cluttered.

 At one time, Sumitro Basak used to create well-crafted, innovative and witty pop-up images that used to be quite delightful. For this artist, the youngest of this group, papiers coll?s was another mode of expression.

 Sumitro creates the same effect here albeit on a much larger scale with very pretty colours ? often a bit too pretty ? forms and their shadows. Where his tones are strong they stand in stark contrasts. Sumitro?s work has become slick and smooth as silk, losing something on the way.

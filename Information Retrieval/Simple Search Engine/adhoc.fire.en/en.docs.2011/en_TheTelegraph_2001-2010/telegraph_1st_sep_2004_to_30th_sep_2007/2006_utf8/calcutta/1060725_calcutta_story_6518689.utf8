 Teacher in tenant eviction trap

 - Detective 

 agency employs musclemen for job 

 SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE

 Be on your guard the next time you employ a detective agency to evict the tenants from your house. P.K. Roy, a retired teacher at a government polytechnic in Jadavpur, realised the need all too late. By then, he had no option but to move out of his own house. 

 Roy approached the detective department for help a week back and is now planning to sell the building.

 ?Three years ago, I employed a detective agency called Eyewitness to remove the tenants from my three-storeyed Dover Lane house. There were six tenants in the building. I, too, used to stay there with my wife and two daughters,? said Roy, who has shifted to a single-storeyed building at Thakurpukur.

 The agency allegedly engaged musclemen to evict the tenants. ?When I had got in touch with the agency, the officials had assured me that they would not violate any law while removing the tenants. Since I was busy with my work, I did not keep a tab on them,? added Roy.

 In September 2003, the musclemen engaged by Eyewitness allegedly threatened the tenants with dire consequences if they did not vacate the house. ?The tenants, in turn, lodged a complaint against me at Gariahat police station. I was in the dark about the entire matter,? claimed Roy.

 The detective agency did not find anything wrong with its course of action. ?We had been asked by Roy to remove the tenants. We acted accordingly. He is unnecessarily raising a hue and cry,? said Gopal Banerjee, owner of Eyewitness, on Pratapaditya Road.

 Soon after, Samir Banerjee, an employee of the agency, sought permission from Roy to move into a vacant portion of the house. ?Samir and Gopal told me that if they were allowed to stay in the house, they could convince the tenants to vacate the premises. I did not figure out their evil design,? Roy said.

 He later came to know that the duo had planned to provide shelter to criminals in the house to intimidate the tenants into leaving. 

 Samir said he was only ?protecting the house from encroachers?.

 Unable to control the process he had started, Roy moved to Thakurpukur early this year. ?I was confused and did not know what to do. The tenants had started to leave, but the owner of the detective agency was pressuring me to hand over the house to a promoter. Unable to find a way out, I approached the police.?

 A senior detective department official said that he had referred the matter to the local police station and started a case. ?We are finding out if the teacher was cheated by the agency,? he said.

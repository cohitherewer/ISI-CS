 Points of peril in police fatal file

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 The fact of the growing traffic mess in the city has been borne out by figures with four vital intersections figuring on a traffic police list of the most accident-prone zones.

 The SP Mukherjee Road- Rashbehari Avenue and EM Bypass-Ultadanga Road intersections, along with the crossings at Moulali and Shyambazar, are the perilous crossroads that have found a place in the traffic police survey for 2005, released on Thursday.

 The eastern slope of Howrah bridge and the BT Road stretch between Shyambazar and Tallah Post Office are some of the other stretches that made it to the fatalities list.

 While the number of accidents has come down, the number of fatal mishaps has shot up. This implies that vehicular speed has gone up, but better traffic management has cut down on accidents, was the conclusion deputy commissioner (traffic) Jawed Shamim drew. 

 According to statistics, BT Road is the most accident-prone road in the city with 24 accidents in 2005.

 Strand Road, with 19 accidents, comes second, followed by AJC Bose Road (18 accidents). Most of the mishap deaths have occurred on Sunday. Monday comes next.

 On Sundays, more people seem to hit the road to drive fast. As for Monday, its the first day of the week and drivers seem to be in a rush to reach office on time, explained a senior traffic cop.

 Male pedestrians over the age of 46 are most often the victims of road mishaps. Last year, the maximum number of accidents took place between 5 pm and 10 pm.

 The survey found pollution cases registered by cops going up, with private buses being the prime culprit. Buses also turned out to be the killer wheels more than others.

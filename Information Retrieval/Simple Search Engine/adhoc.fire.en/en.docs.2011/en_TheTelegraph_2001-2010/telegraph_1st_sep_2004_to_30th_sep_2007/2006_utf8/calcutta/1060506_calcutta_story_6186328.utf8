 Glimpses of European 

 Design Destiny at Underground on Thursday night. Pictures 

 by Rashbehari Das 

 What: European 

 Design Destiny. 

 Where: At Underground, 

 the nightclub at Hotel Hindusthan International.

 When: Thursday, 9 pm onwards. 

 The competition: Organised by educational centre Erudite and Options Unlimited, the semi-final of this design event saw talent from five fashion colleges showcasing their best. The participating colleges were National Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT), NIFD (Salt Lake), Wigan amp; Leigh College, Bhawanipur Gujarati Education Society and IIFT (Jamshedpur).

 The quarter-final round saw a three-member jury comprising designer Sunipa Samadder, academician Bobby Sen and Shivang Dhruva from Options Unlimited pick a list of 32 design students. The creations of these semi-finalists then took to the bartop-turned-ramp in front of the judges for the evening, designers Abhishek Dutta and Snehasish Bhattacharya. 

 Twenty-four finalists will showcase their ensembles on May 16. The winners of this contest will bag partial scholarships and comprehensive support on availing admissions to design schools like Istituto Europeo di Design, Milan, and Cavendish College in London. 

 The catwalk: Choreographed by Ria Mitra, the fashion extravaganza saw city models like Tanushree, Ishika, Tina and Jessica strutting the clothes. Each participant showcased two creations ? one of his own choice and the other chosen from the three given themes, Chic amp; Sexy, Bold Motifs and Clean Straight Cuts.

 The results, as expected, were a diverse mix of ideas, sensibilities and trends. Lots of colour, interesting cuts, bold patterns and quirky knitted accessories were the highlights of the evening.

 Out-of-the-box headgear stood out in many entries. Some, of course, chose the safer path and stuck to classics. 

 Voiceover: The idea is to provide students a platform to project their talent and ideas globally to gain a competitive edge, said Joyce Johar from Erudite.

 Death sparks hospital row 

 - Family members allege negligence by doctors

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Trouble broke out at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital on Saturday night following the death of Shyamali Bhowmick, 19, of Barasat, on the citys northern fringes. 

 She had been admitted to the hospitals gynaecology department in the morning as she was expecting a child. According to doctors, her condition was so serious that they decided to perform a Caesarean section to deliver her baby. 

 But the bleeding did not stop and she was shifted to the intensive care unit of the hospital. Doctors then decided to perform another surgery to staunch the bleeding. 

 The doctors took the familys consent and planned another surgery but unfortunately, the patient died before that, an officer of the hospital said. The baby was doing well.

 Soon after her death, Shyamalis family members alleged that there had been negligence on the part of the doctors. The doctors kept us in the dark throughout the day and did not inform us about her condition, alleged Shila Bhowmick, Shyamalis mother-in-law. 

 Thereafter, there was tension at the hospital and a police team was sent there. 

 Angry family members had an altercation with the doctors and hospital staff at night and later lodged a complaint with Tallah police station. Police have sent the body for post-mortem. 

 The doctors did not do enough to save Shyamalis life. If they had taken a little more care, my sister would not have died, said Gobinda Sarkar, her brother. The doctors did not tell us anything whenever we asked them about her condition. Later, when we sought an explanation, the doctors manhandled us, he alleged.

 The hospital authorities denied the allegations. Our doctors tried their best to save the patient but her condition was really bad, said K. Roy, medical superintendent of RG Kar hospital.

 Reality check at rehab centre

Festive frenzy-

A group from Raja Rajeshwari Girls Model Corporation School is now having a whale 

of a time at a five-day childrens festival in China, performing 17 items 

of dance, mime and drama, courtesy Loreto Sealdah Rainbow Home. The 10 smiling 

faces posed for the camera before leaving on the trip.

 The National Service Scheme (NSS) of St Xavier?s College embarked on an eight-day trip to Antara Gram Centre for Deaddiction and Rehabilitation in Baruipur on June 9.

 The experience was one of its kind for NSS-ers, because in the process of interacting with the patients they came face-to-face with another reality that exists in our society.

 The camp included orientations on mental health, drug addiction, the science of psychiatry and other related topics. The technical sessions on the working of a deaddiction and rehabilitation centre helped the students get rid of the countless pre-conceived notions they had about drug addiction and mental health. A few reflective and meditative sessions were also thrown in.

 The inmates of the centre soon made friends with the students. Shared sessions of drama, dance, singing and art-and-craft worked as confidence-building measures for the patients and made them feel part of the mainstream.

 The camp concluded with a cultural programme, in which the inmates of the centre put up a lively show of dance, drama and songs.

Dais debut

 After weeks of frantic preparation, the new auditorium at Delhi Public School (DPS) Megacity, in Rajarhat, was inaugurated by Governor Gopal Krishna Gandhi on June 28. From trustees to the junior-most students, all were in attendance.

 The amphitheatre will act as the centrepiece in the school?s development and will be used for a wide range of events, from theatre and music performances to school assemblies.

 After performances by the school bands, dance troupes and choirs, the governor released the school?s new magazine, Shrishti, a publication that is designed to outline the school?s progress and capabilities and serve as an indicator for parents of prospective students.

 Much to the children?s delight, the governor?s speech was aimed almost exclusively at them, with Gandhi interacting with the youngsters. He even engaged in a bit of banter about the World Cup.

Gandhi?s address later took on a more serious tone when he reminded the students that ?there are many children who unlike you don?t have beautiful grounds to play on?. He encouraged DPS Megacity students to ?make contact with streetchildren, invite them to play with you at your school?.

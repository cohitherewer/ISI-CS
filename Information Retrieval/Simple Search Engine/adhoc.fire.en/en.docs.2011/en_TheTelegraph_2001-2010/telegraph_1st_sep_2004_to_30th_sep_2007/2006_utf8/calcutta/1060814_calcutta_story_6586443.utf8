The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Seminar tour to combat traffick

 PATRICK PRINGLE

 One of a multitude of organisations that are seeking to address human trafficking in eastern India, NGO Prem-E-Asha is now seeking to take a seminar on rehabilitating victims of trafficking to various states in eastern India.

 The seminars will consist of panel and group discussions, a field trip and policy recommendations.

 The Calcutta-based organisation has also called upon the state and central governments to devote more resources to tackling trafficking.

 Vinod Tiwari of Prem-E-Asha stressed the need for more cooperation among NGOs in the fight against the problem. At the moment, many NGOs are wary about releasing information they have gathered on the issue. This needs to change; only by working together and sharing information will we able to progress in our fight against this widespread problem. 

 Tiwari added that Calcutta receives an appropriate amount of attention with regard to trafficking, in contrast to other areas of eastern India. Of course, it is important to have events in Calcutta, but I think that NGOs should also focus on the root of trafficking, which is simply poverty, he stated.

 Prem-E-Asha held a two-day, state-level seminar on the issue in the Capital in March last year. It was sponsored by the National Commission for Women. Tiwari felt that such Centre-funded seminars are not as frequent as they should be.

 Both the Centre and the state have earmarked chunks of their budgets to tackling trafficking. With the money that has been allotted, seminars could be held every few months, he elaborated.

 Another area in which Prem-E-Asha feels there could be a great deal of improvement is corporate participation. Some of the big corporations that are investing in Bengal do have and stick to very good corporate commitment programmes (CCPs). Tata and HSBC are two that come to mind. But there are many corporations that dont stick to their CCPs, asserted Tiwari.

 He pointed out that corporate bodies could help in a much more direct way. Companies could easily offer jobs to victims of trafficking once they have been rehabilitated. Big corporations have numerous low-rung jobs that do not require a person of considerable education. Nobody deserves the stability of employment more than victims of trafficking.

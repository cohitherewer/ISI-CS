The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 Lately, I have noticed that the footboards of private and mini buses in the 

city have been modified. Instead of two steps, now there are three steps, which 

are tremendously low. Though they have been modified for the benefit of passengers, 

they can be dangerous too. Due to their usual habit, passengers may skip the third 

step and fall off the bus. This can lead to fatal road mishaps. I request the 

authorities to look into the matter.

 The Metro Railway should immediately stop displaying the train time schedule 

at the entrance of the Metro stations. Owing to the time display outside the stations, 

the passengers, especially youngsters desperate to catch the trains, run on the 

stairs and fall hurting themselves and others in front. The Metro officials should 

settle this matter soon.

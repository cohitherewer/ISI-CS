 When the gods began drinking milk again and thousands rushed to the seaside to fetch their infants a sip of the sweet sea water, we realised that it was the perfect time to revive the old science magic show, said Jayanta Sthanapati, director, Birla Industrial and Technological Museum (BITM). 

 A month-long programme, Science Magic Miracle: A Show of Science Tricks, conducted by BITM, aims at making people aware that all miracles are based on scientific principles. 

 Even educated people believe in the supernatural when the basic science involved is beyond their ken. But if they do a bit of research, they will realise that everything under the sun is based on scientific principles, said Sthanapati.

 The museums daily magic menu includes a show and explanation of supernatural powers, like relaxing on a seat of nails, producing bibhuti (ash) out of thin air, making a plastic dog drink water etc. We are not competing with magicians, who are better trained. But we can teach you how to get a book to burst into flames the moment someone opens it or get a series of coins to form a chain with nothing visible joining them, explained Sthanapati. 

 On the first day of the show, conducted by education officer Ramen Banerjee, students from three schools and several science enthusiasts across the city assembled at the BITM auditorium.

 This is nothing but science. When you sit on a seat of a thousand nails, your weight is evenly distributed and therefore, the nails dont hurt you. Similarly, the presence of excessive moisture and carbon dioxide inside our mouth extinguishes the fire when you eat it, smiled Banerjee.

 On the miracle of idols drinking milk, he explained that liquids like milk and water would on contact with any solid object, (stone, metal or plastic) follow the principles of surface tension. Due to adhesion, water sticks to the solid object (in this case the plastic dog) and there is a break in surface tension. Gravitational force makes the liquid run in a continuous stream till it loses contact with the solid. 

 Show timings are 3 pm to 4 pm daily, including Sundays. Entry fees are Rs 15 for the public and Rs 7 per head for school groups.

All eyes were on one person on the penultimate day 

of the Wills Lifestyle India Fashion Week (WLIFW) in Delhi on Saturday. 

 And Rajesh Pratap Singh, or Pratap as he is popularly known in the circuit, didnt disappoint. 

 The designer did what he does best ? present a line remarkable for its stark minimalism and clean cuts.

 Straight lines, structured construction, and a palette comprising greys, greys and more greys defined the no-frills Pratap look. 

 With paintings inspired by Satyajit Rays Jalsaghar (The Music Room) forming the background and sounds of a chandelier crashing being part of the music, the mood was set right from the start.

 ared minis with tights, pleated slim trousers, off-shoulder dresses, coat dresses, knee-length pleated skirts, track pants, shirts with large buttons, bubble dresses, empire lines and more formed the collection. A bit of applique and some prints embellished the starkly clean garments.

 Pintucks, gathers, ruches and pleats were used extensively. The fabrics picked on fine wool, silk velvets, cotton voiles, georgettes, silk muslins and wool-silk blends. The greys were touched with prune, brass, gold and petrol. Its a very architectural collection, with shapes being the focus, explained the designer, who doesnt quite understand the business of inspiration.

 The collection that preceded Prataps evening show was by Calcuttas veteran duo Mona Lamba and Pali Sachdev.

 The designers did manage to break out of their conventional brief with a fresh new look. But the garments ? skirts being the key silhouette ? often came across as over-embellished and a little too heavy on the eye. Soft fabrics like georgettes, chiffons, silks and linen were juxtaposed with structured materials like brocade.

 A wide range of skirts had company in the form of cropped jackets, wraps, saris and pants. The look was soft, sensual and voluminous.

 Lots of asymmetry, layering, unfinished edges and cutaways were used. A little too heavy on surface ornamentation, the collection used wool embroidery, threadwork, appliques, patchwork, diffused prints and hand paint.

 The colours were vibrant ? turquoise, purple, pinks,violets, magenta, plum, aqua, ivory, beige, grey and black.

 Earlier in the day, designer duo Shantanu and Nikhil presented an impressive autumn-winter line inspired by the luxury and romance of the camel safari. Their inspiration was a woman belonging to the glamorous 50s who travels through Rajasthan and discovers the vibrant carnival in the heart of Rajasthan.

 The stunning classic evening wear collection was restricted to just two colour combinations ? black-and-white and lime green-and-brown. The silhouettes varied from evening dresses, crisp and fitted skirts, short and chic capes to flared skirts, tees, jackets and vintage tops. Ruffles and laces, intricate kantha embroidery, jaal work, geometrical patterns, Rajasthan-inspired print motifs like camel and florals decorated the garments.

 Sensual silks, chiffons, structured hand-woven herringbone, wool, jersey knits and more shaped the outfits.

 Our inspiration is the woman of the bygone era with subdued sophistication, yet entrenched in the modern-day sensibility. A woman who loves travelling and discovers the camel safari of Rajasthan, explained the duo credited with creating Amitabh Bachchans wardrobe for Kaun Banega Crorepati II.

 The final sequence of the day by designer Ranna Gill recreated the Victorian look. Simply titled Elizabeth, the line drew from the lavish and luxurious styles of the Elizabethan era. 

 Lace, crochet and appliques, blended with polka dots and fresh floral prints and paisleys defined the super-feminine look. 

 Empire tops, empire and halter dresses, skirts of various styles from pencil to pegged to circular, Edwardian jackets, peplum jackets, crochet-worked waistcoats and long appliqued coats form the glamorous line.

 The colours were vibrant ? red, black, white, teal, peacock and midnight blue.

 The highly stylised collection was accessorised with long pearl necklaces,Victorian brooches and ruffled collars. Models with bright red lips catwalked in ballerinas, wooden wedges and crystal-strap sandals.

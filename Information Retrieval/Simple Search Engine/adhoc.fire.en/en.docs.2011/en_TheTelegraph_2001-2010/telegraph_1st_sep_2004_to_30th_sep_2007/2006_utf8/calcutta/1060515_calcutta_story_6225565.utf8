The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Return of a heroine

When Priyanka Trivedi tied the knot and said goodbye to films two years ago, Tollywood reeling under a dearth of heroines was dealt a body blow.

 And now, when the race for Heroine No. 1 is hotting up between Koel Mullick and Swastika Mukherjee, Priyanka has decided to stage a comeback and grab some of the spotlight.

 Based in Bangalore, where husband Upendra is a Kannada film star, the mother of two toddlers is gearing up to face the camera for a film with Prosenjit, no less.

 The untitled project, hitting the floors later this month, will be directed by Ravi Kinagi and produced by Mohit Kochar.

 ?I got married and had two babies. Now that they have grown up a little ? one of them is a year old and the other is two years old ? I thought of returning to films. I have been in touch with a few friends from the industry and even got a portfolio shot in Mumbai. And this film happened quite by chance,? says Priyanka, who and Jeet had emerged as the top twosome in tinsel town when their Saathi became the runaway hit in 2002.

 Shooting for Bengali films will hardly be a problem because Calcutta still means home, with her parents and relatives here. ?I have lots of people to take care of my children when I will be shooting for this film. It will take a month and is mostly an indoor shoot,? says the student of Calcutta International School and Bhawanipur Education Society.

 But Priyanka has no plans to camp in Calcutta and reclaim the Tollywood turf she has lost in two years. With a bustling family to look after, she is just not willing to go on a signing spree. ?I don?t want to do films that only want me to run around. I want to do something substantial? This is not a typical commercial film. I have a good role; it?s parallel to the hero and gives me a lot of scope to perform.? 

 Adds Tollywood?s leading hero: ?It?s not a typical romantic film and the female lead is a mature character. So, the producers thought of taking Priyanka.? 

 With director Kinagi, who had scripted last year?s superhit Juddha, Priyanka was to have done Champion, which didn?t work out. She also has offers from the Kannada film industry, of which one is a home production. ?I had done a film with Upendra, Gokarma, before we got married. So it will be nice to work with him again in the film later this year,? she says.

 Her actor-husband has no problems with Priyanka?s screen comeback. ?He is very supportive. We are actually more concerned about the kids. In that respect, Calcutta is a good option for me,? she adds.

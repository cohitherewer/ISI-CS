 Struggle for salary

 - Teacher on Rs 21 PAy for 30 years

 TAPAS GHOSH

 To Pranab Kumar Sengupta, teacher of a city-based primary school drawing a salary of Rs 21.75 per month since he joined work in 1973, life is a protracted legal battle.

 The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government?s refusal to carry out repeated court orders, asking it to regularise Sengupta?s service, has prompted the teacher to file a contempt petition in the high court for the second time.

 On Friday, Justice K.J. Sengupta of the court again asked the education department to ratify Sengupta?s service since his joining the school and disburse all his dues within six months from the date of communication of the order.

 Justice Sengupta, in his order, asked the district primary school council to pay the teacher Rs 34,000 as the cost of the case. The judge also asked the education department to pay Sengupta his current salary forthwith.

 ?They (the state government) are habitual violators of court orders. A division bench court had passed a similar order in 1995. But the department, instead of obeying the order, continued the legal battle. This time, my petitioner will go to the Supreme Court if the government flouts the order again,? said advocate Saibalendu Bhowmik, who has been fighting the case gratis for the past 12 years.

 Since joining the school, Sengupta had received his actual salary only for a month in 2004, when Justice K.J. Sengupta directed that the pay of the chairman of the North 24 Parganas primary school council would remain attached till the teacher?s salary was paid. 

 Thereafter, the department had issued a salary cheque to the petitioner, who had joined Basak Bagan Primary School, in north Calcutta, as an assistant teacher. 

 Twenty-nine years on, Pranab Kumar Sengupta continues to serve in the same position, drawing the same princely salary. 

 Today, a primary school teacher draws Rs 6,000 a month when he joins work. Ten years ago, Sengupta obtained a Calcutta High Court directive asking the education department to regularise his service and pay him his dues with retrospective effect. 

 The then school education secretary informed the court two years later that the order had been carried out. 

 In 2006, Sengupta is still moving one court after another with a contempt petition in hand but with no one to hear him out. Education department clerks aren?t impressed by a court order. ?Don?t show us a court ruling. If you want your job and your dues, you will have to pay Rs 60,000,? was what the 55-year-old Sengupta was told when he went there with the order. Even his lawyer, Saibalendu Bhaumik, who was once his student, is despairing.

 Sengupta started teaching in the school on May 21, 1973. When even after two decades of service, the school authorities were reluctant to regularise his services, he went to Calcutta High Court. 

 Justice Paritosh Mukherjee had ruled that Sengupta be made a permanent employee with retrospective effect.

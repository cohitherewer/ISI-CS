 War with the self

 More often than not, our lofty, utopian intentions are overridden by selfish, petty motives, and the journey to our idealistic goals remains unfulfilled. Chhotku narrates the story of its eponymous protagonist, whose ideological march towards a classless, egalitarian society had lost its track amidst the corrupt, lustful and depraved path of power. The play begins with Chhotku, now a middle-aged man, standing at the crossroads of life and reminiscing the days of his fiery youth. Besides being driven by emotional exuberance and the dream of a socialist world order, an intense, unbridled passion had also resulted in fatherhood, which he had failed to acknowledge. Repenting his grave mistake, he now wants to make amends to his forsaken daughter. He also realises the many compromises he has made along the way, in order to secure a position of prestige and honour in society. With bleeding heart and tearful eyes, he lodges a symbolic war against himself. Direction: Swapan Sengupta.

 Event: Play in Bengali, Chhotku, produced by Natya Ranga 

When: Today at 6.30 pm 

Where: Girish Mancha

 Hospitals in security beef-up

 - REGULAR PURGE PLAN

 KINSUK BASU

 The state health department has ordered a security beef-up in all five medical colleges in the city to prevent entry of outsiders who have no reason to visit the campuses, especially at night.

 The principals of all the medical colleges have been asked to carry out frequent raids to flush out those who are illegally staying on. 

 The security supervisers, who are in charge of the private guards deployed at all five institutions, have been directed to prepare a list of potential trouble-spots and suggest how best unauthorised entry could be prevented.

 ?We are going to review the situation at our next meeting with the principals of the medical colleges. It?s not that things will change overnight, but a concerted effort has to be made to root out the sources of trouble,? said director of medical education Jayshree Mitra.

 The move to step up security on the medical college campuses follows two incidents that rocked the state healthcare service.

 The first was a rape at Medical College and Hospital on March 5. This was followed by violence on March 17 at National Medical College and Hospital, where a group of outsiders allegedly attacked a few junior doctors, prompting them to go on a token strike. 

 ?Immediately after the incident, the number of private guards at National Medical College and Hospital was increased and the other institutions were put on alert. Besides, the colleges were asked to keep tabs on those staying in the waiting rooms at night,? said a senior health department official.

 Sources in the department said SSKM Hospital and Medical College and Hospital have identified the spots on the premises that are most frequented by outsiders.

 The zones under the scanner at SSKM are the vicinity of the nurses? hostel and the pathway leading to Bangur Institute of Neurology, while the trouble zone at Medical College and Hospital is the stretch behind Green Building.

 The low boundary wall and the lack of proper lighting make the area adjacent to the gynaecology building at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital easily accessible to outsiders.

 ?The most crucial step towards beefing up security is installation of lights. No corner of the campus should remain dark after sundown,? said Gautam Mukherjee of the Association of Health Service Doctors.

 ?Besides, the hospitals have to frame norms on who would be allowed entry and implement them strictly. We have placed our proposals with the health department. It?s now up to the authorities to react,? he added.

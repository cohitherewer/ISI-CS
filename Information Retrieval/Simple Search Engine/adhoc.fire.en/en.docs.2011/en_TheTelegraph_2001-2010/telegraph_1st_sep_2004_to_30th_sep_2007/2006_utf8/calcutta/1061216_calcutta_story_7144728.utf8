 Designs on Down Under

 A two-year-old label walking the international ramp might be just the stuff designer dreams are made of, but for city boys Dev and Nil, its a reality now. The designers from Howrah, who celebrated their labels second anniversary on December 1, will be unveiling the spring-summer 2008 collection at the Rosemount Australian Fashion Week in Sydney next year.

 The duo, having showcased at the Lakme Fashion Week (LFW) in Mumbai twice in succession (March and then October-November this year), has been selected by the LFW board to participate in the prestigious Australian fashion week between April 30 and May 4, 2007.

 We have been taken completely by surprise and are obviously very excited. Australia is a young country in terms of fashion and so we can relate to it, Dev told GoodLife.

 It is a big challenge since this will be our first international fashion week. Also, its just one month after the LFW in March 2007. We have to produce two distinctly different collections for the two fashion weeks as they cater to different seasons, he added.

 The excitement is a trifle more for Nil, for whom its a homecoming of sorts, having studied fashion in Australia and launched his first solo label there.

 The young designers plan to unveil a resort wear collection. Resort wear is big internationally and Australia is famous for its beaches, so we thought it would be a good idea to showcase that line, explained Dev.

 But the resort wear line will not be restricted to bikinis and sarongs. Lots of summer dresses, flowy silhouettes, sheer, glamour with a touch of India is what we are looking at, revealed the two.

 Dev and Nil will be joined by another Indian duo Rahul and Firdous who also get an opportunity to show at Rosemount Australian Fashion Week.

 Designers Surily Goel, Nandita Mahtani and Narendra Kumar have been chosen to showcase at the Mercedes Benz Fashion Week in Los Angeles in March, while Savio Jon, Rocky S and Anshu Arora Sen will make it to the Singapore Fashion Festival, also in March.

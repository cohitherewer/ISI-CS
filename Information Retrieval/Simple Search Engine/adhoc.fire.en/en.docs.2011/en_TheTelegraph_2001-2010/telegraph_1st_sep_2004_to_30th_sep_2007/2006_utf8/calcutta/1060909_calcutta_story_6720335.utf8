 Calcutta High Court Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurkar has expressed the desire that district magistrate (south) Roshni Sen depute a representative who, along with representatives of the Sebayets Council and Kalighat Temple Committee, will be present when the offering box of the Kalighat temple is opened.

 The chief justice, while hearing a case relating to the development of the temple, desired that the district magistrates representative take the responsibility of depositing in banks cash collected from the offering box.

 The chief justice expressed his desire following an affidavit submitted by P.S. Dutta, former district judge of South 24-Parganas, who was also ex-officio chairman of the Kalighat temple Committee. 

 In his affidavit, Dutta (now a high court judge) alleged that sebayets were misappropriating funds.

 On Friday, the division bench of Chief Justice Sirpurkar and Justice Nadira Patherya directed the sebayets council and the temple committee to take all possible steps to maintain cleanliness in the temple. The judges asked both the council and the committee to file affidavits suggesting steps to beautify the temple.

 I had a horrible experience when I went to the temple a few days ago. My feet sank into mounds of mud. Why dont the authorities clean the temple properly? the chief justice asked. 

 The assistant commissioner (south) and officer-in-charge of Kalighat police station are directed to be present during the hearing of the matter next Friday (September 15) when the matter will come up for hearing again, the division bench said in its order.

 The court also declared that it would pass a comprehensive order on the beautification and renovation of the Kali temple on September 15. 

 Appearing for the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), advocate Aloke Ghosh on Friday told the court that the money sanctioned by the Centre for developing the temple could not be utilised as the sebayets council and the temple committee were not allowing the CMC to implement the scheme. The petition relating to the temple was moved in the high court by Prahlad Goenka, a devotee, who charged that sebayets were misappropriating funds.

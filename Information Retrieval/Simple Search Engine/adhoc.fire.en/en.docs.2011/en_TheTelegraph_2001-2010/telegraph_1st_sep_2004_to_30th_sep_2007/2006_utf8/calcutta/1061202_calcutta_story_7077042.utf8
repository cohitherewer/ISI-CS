 A melodious journey

 Revisiting the aura and era of the legendary singer and thespian on whose life it is based, K.L. Saigal beautifully blends fact and fiction to present an engaging musical drama. Besides portraying him in his immortal, popular image, the play also traces his childhood days in Jammu and his struggling days in Delhi and Calcutta, much before he gained recognition as a superstar in the Hindi film industry in Bombay. Reliving the music and cinema of yesteryears, it is full of interesting events and anecdotes which centre around figures of no less stature than Saigal himself, like Ustad Fiyyaz Khan, D.V. Palusker, Punkaj Mullick, R.C. Boral, K.C. Dey and Naushad, to name a few. One of the most attractive elements in the play is that it is dotted with live recitals of Saigals ghazals, dadras, thumris and film songs like Aah ko chahiye ek umr asar hone tak, Lag gai chot karejva mein hai Rama and Baalam aaye baso mor-e man mein ... Script and direction: Dr M. Sayeed Alam and Niti Sayeed.

 Cash plenty, projects few

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 For years, Calcutta University complained about a cash crunch that crippled its research projects. Now, it has crores in hand, but is clueless about how to spend it.

 Over the past few months, the 

 150-year-old institution has been flooded with funds, mostly 

 for research, from the Centre and the state government. 

 The money will have to be returned if it is not spent within 

 the stipulated period.

 The university has set up a committee to monitor utilisation of the money, but has not identified a single research project that will benefit from it. 

 ?Research has suffered immensely because of the financial crisis the university had gone through in the 1990s. We now need to work overtime to utilise every rupee of the funds within the deadline,? said Arindam Gupta, convener of the Calcutta University Research Scholars? Association.

 Admitting that the funds are all time-barred, pro vice-chancellor (finance) T.K. Mukherjee said: ?We are taking necessary steps to utilise the money in an appropriate manner. The university will not take any hasty decision.?

 In the past three months, the Centre and the state government had announced a total grant of over Rs 220 crore for the varsity, a bulk of which is to be spent on research. 

 The University Grants Commission had made an additional allocation of Rs 50 crore after the university was declared a centre of excellence. The first instalment of Rs 10 crore has been released. The second will come only if the money is spent by March 2007.

 ?The funds have arrived, but we still don?t know the specific areas where the authorities are keen to conduct research,? said a scholar in the bio-technology department.

 The scholars alleged that the university intends to spend a portion of the funds for constructing buildings, including students? hostels and staff quarters, in the name of infrastructure development.

 ?We will not allow the authorities to spend a single paisa on buildings,? warned Gupta.

 Model hunt for results on time

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 How can Calcutta University publish results within 45 days? By learning how universities in Mumbai, Pune and Chennai do it like clockwork.

 Driven by the need to publish results faster and increase accountability of affiliated colleges, Calcutta University (CU) is planning an overhaul of its examination system.

 And realising that meeting result deadlines means not doing what comes naturally in Bengal, the varsity officials have decided to first study and then maybe adopt the Mumbai-Pune-Chennai model.

 It has become extremely important to follow a system that will allow us to publish results of undergraduate examinations within 45 to 60 days. Universities with more students and affiliated colleges manage to do that. We need to revamp our system, asserted CU pro-vice chancellor (academic affairs) Suranjan Das.

 A team comprising controller of examinations Onkar Sadhan Adhikari recently visited several universities to study the practices there. It is now preparing a report on the basis of which proposals will be made to the government in January, said Das.

 The proposals will be placed before the CUs undergraduate council for approval before they are submitted to the government.

 Around 80,000 students take the undergraduate examinations of CU. The declaration of results often takes much more than 60 days.

 University officials said the Maharashtra government has made it mandatory for universities to declare undergraduate results within 45 days.

 The universities need to provide an explanation to the government if they fail to do so. CU may urge the government to incorporate a similar clause in its act.

 The authorities also plan to urge the government to allow them to decentralise the examination system by handing over the responsibility of conducting BA, B.Sc and B.Com (general) examinations to the 160 affiliated colleges. This system is followed in a number of states.

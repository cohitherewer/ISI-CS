 Patient dies in fall

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A 34-year-old patient of a private hospital off the EM Bypass allegedly went berserk on Tuesday morning and injured six persons before jumping to death from the roof. A complaint has been lodged with Jadavpur (East) police station.

 Shyamal Biswas, a resident of Krishnaganj, in Nadia, had been suffering from a lung ailment and was admitted to Rabindranath Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences on November 28. Relatives of Biswas, an insurance agent, doubted the hospital authorities version of his death.

 The patient was in desperate need of treatment for haemoptysis (coughing up of blood from the respiratory tract). He had spent the past year in various hospitals for the problem, said Sujay Ranjan Deb, deputy medical superintendent and consultant, emergency medicine.

 Biswas was scheduled to undergo surgery for left thoracotomy and lobectomy on Wednesday, he added.

 Biswas, described as being quite well-mannered, suddenly turned violent when a nurse went to his third-floor bed to administer medicines around 6 am on Tuesday.

 He grabbed a rod used to hang saline bottles and started swinging it wildly. He broke the window panes and the nursing station of the ward. Those who tried to pacify him including doctors, nurses, the manager on duty and securitymen were injured, said Deb.

 The authorities then called police constable Subhasish Mukherjee, posted at the hospital. He, too, was hit by the patient and suffered a fracture in his left hand. Biswas then ran to the roof, from where he jumped. He was rushed to the emergency, where he was resuscitated, and then shifted to the ITU. But he died at 12.50 pm, Deb said.

 Relatives of Biswas did not accept the official version. We cannot believe he could behave in this way. True, he had been depressed because of his ailments, but that was no reason for his alleged violent behaviour. Besides, why did the securitymen not keep the door to the roof locked? asked a relative.

 Superintendent of police (South 24-Parganas) S.N. Gupta said: We are waiting for the post-mortem report. I have asked Jadavpur (East) thana to conduct an inquiry.

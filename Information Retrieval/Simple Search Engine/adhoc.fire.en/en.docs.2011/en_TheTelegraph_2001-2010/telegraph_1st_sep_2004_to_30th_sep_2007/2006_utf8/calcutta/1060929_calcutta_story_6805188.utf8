 Plays with a purpose

 Presenting three plays that carry a message for children and adults alike, Nandikars latest productions try to spread the light of faith, confidence and optimism in a world that is increasingly becoming unfriendly, biased and shrunken. Written by Leela Mazumder, Natun Chhele Natabar (a scene from the play appears left), the first among the three, narrates the incidents that follow the admission of Natabar Chandra to a school full of rowdy, mischievous students. Weak in appearance and wearing odd-looking clothes, he becomes the butt of ridicule of all his schoolmates. But, much to their horror, he becomes the darling of the teachers. His schoolmates try to harass him, but only end up being fooled by him. Finally, they lay a trap to have him punished by the headmaster, leading the play to its hilarious climactic end. Direction: Goutam Halder. Ashapurna Devis Raater Kutum, tells the story of two petty thieves, Nasu and Gada, who enter the dilapidated house of an old woman. Posing as friends of the caretaker of the house, they declare that they have come to look after the woman. What follows is, to say the least, an incredibly chaotic experience! Pakhi (written by Leela Mazumder), the final play of the evening, draws poignant parallels between a little girls walking disability and that of a wounded goose which cannot fly. Direction: Swatilekha Sengupta.

 Event: Plays in Bengali, Natun Chhele Natabar, Raater Kutum and Pakhi, produced by Nandikar

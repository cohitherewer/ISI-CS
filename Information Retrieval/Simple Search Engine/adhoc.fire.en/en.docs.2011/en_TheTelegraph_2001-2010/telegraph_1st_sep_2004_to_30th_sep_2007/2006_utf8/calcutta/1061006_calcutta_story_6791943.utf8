 Showcasing rural Bengal

 - Art 

exhibition in UK

 A STAFF REPORTER

 An exhibition of works by city-based artists Anita Roy Chowdhury, Arpita Basu and Swapna Sen is set to tour various venues in the UK from October 2006 till October 2007. 

 Starting on October 12 at the MP Birla Millennium Gallery, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan Centre, London, the show will be mounted at the Bruce Castle Museum and subsequently at venues like Manchester and Liverpool.

 Though the artists had their individual shows abroad, this will be their first major art show together. 

 In the current series based on oils, Chowdhury has tried to express her intense vision of man and nature through vibrant swirls of lines and colour. Trees, hills, stars and rivers merge inseparably on her canvasses with human forms. 

 In comparison, Sens works are more stylised, replicating folk art in their depiction of rustic lifestyle. She has developed a medium using layers of mud on paper before tempera. Basu has used familiar ritualistic motifs to convey the traditional nature worship in various forms. 

 The shows will also be the first presentation of Aami Gallery at 186A, SP Mukherjee Road, which will be inaugurated on the same day (October 12) in London. 

 Owner Ashok Chanda, an art enthusiast, believes that it is important to increase global awareness about Bengals rich cultural achievements and historical traditions. 

 He claims that the current show will develop wider public interest and a profile for contemporary visual art from Bengal in the UK. Nature and traditional rituals are the common factors in this series. I feel these will draw the foreign art lovers, smiles Chanda. 

 The initiative has already secured the support of Bhavan Centre, London, and the Indo-British Partnership Network and many art-lovers, adds Chanda.

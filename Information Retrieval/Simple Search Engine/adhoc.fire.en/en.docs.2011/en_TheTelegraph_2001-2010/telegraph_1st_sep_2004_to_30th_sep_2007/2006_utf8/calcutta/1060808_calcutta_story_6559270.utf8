 Disaster combat tips for people

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The civil defence department will soon launch a programme to spread awareness among the people on how to combat disasters. This follows a training for officers of the department in disaster management.

 Sources said the department will take recourse to various methods, including distribution of leaflets and pamphlets, to spread its message among the people.

 In the course of the programme, special emphasis will be laid on Metro Railway, as officers believe most commuters are unaware of the safety-related nitty-gritty of this mode of transport. 

 Metro stations, being vulnerable spots, will be given special attention, pointed out civil defence minister Srikumar Mukherjee. 

 The programme will try to familiarise Metro users with the certain basics, like where fire extinguishers are kept in the stations, how one should raise an alarm when there is a danger on the train or in the station, the placement of electric wires and other details that commuters must be aware of to tackle an emergency.

 People tend to lose their cool when faced with a threat, said Mukherjee. Not knowing how to react, they panic, resulting in a stampede or other mishaps. The problem becomes more acute in the Metro. During the programme, we will explain to commuters what to do and in which order to tide over a crisis.

 The department will also set up user forums in every Metro station for helping passengers.

 So far, we have been training officials. But it is equally important to spread awareness among the common people, so they make an effort to escape a danger themselves. This is the first time that the department is launching such a programme, Mukherjee added.

 A team of 20 officials, trained for a month in disaster management by Sharon Nilson, of the UK-based NGO Scientology International Volunteers, will prepare a list of dos and donts that will be displayed prominently at all Metro stations.

 The officials will also provide training to the disaster management team of Metro Railway from the second week of August. This will be the second phase of the training that started in June.

 After they are through with the Metro disaster management team, the officials will start training teams from the airport, shopping malls and other places where a large number of people converge regularly.

 Civil defence minister Mukherjee said several factors have prompted the department to launch the programme, the recent serial blasts in Mumbai being one of them. 

 But it was always there in our mind to launch awareness programmes for the safety of the common people, he signed off.

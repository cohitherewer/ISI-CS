 Laser beam boost for urology surgery

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Not just in eyecare, laser technology will soon be used here to treat urological problems.

 Claiming credit for introducing the technology in the city is Anandalok Hospital, in Salt Lake, which has decided to treat every patient with a urological problem with lasers. 

 ?Doctors all over the world have found that laser technology could revolutionise the management of urological problems,? said Amit Ghose, city-based urologist. 

 D.K. Saraf, secretary, Anandalok Hospital, stated: ?We are proud and happy that we are the first to bring the technology to the eastern part of the country. We are sure that it will bring relief to patients suffering from various urological problems.? 

 Surgeries to remove kidney stones and treat problems arising out of prostate enlargement are likely to benefit the most from the advent of laser technology.

 The standard method of removing kidney stones is by open surgery. The kidney is exposed and cut open to retrieve the stones. The operation is complicated and morbidity high. 

 ?Using laser technology, the stones can be disintegrated and vapourised,? explained Ghose. This, experts said, would result in complete removal of the stones without loss of blood. The patient will only need to be in hospital for a short duration. 

 Some other advantages of using laser technology to treat kidney stones are:

 4Effectiveness for complex stones

 4Higher success rate with single treatment

 4Minimal risk of future stone formation

 4Effectiveness for uncommon stone composition. 

 The new surgical technology will prove a boon for elderly people with cardiac disease and other complications along with prostate gland problems.

 Removal of the prostate gland through open surgery is fraught with risks. On the other hand, use of laser does not cause loss of blood and minimises morbidity.

 ?The beam actually vaporises the prostate gland and does not leave behind any tissue. This will also enable operations to be done on anti-coagulated patients,? another doctor explained.

 Extra advantages of use of laser technology for prostate surgery are short catheterisation time, less complications and cost effectiveness.

 Feast of the arts for better education

 Sapphire Creations Dance Workshop in performance

 Interface 2006, an international festival of alternative and contemporary expressions, opens on Tuesday in the city. American Center, Max Mueller Bhavan, Science City, British Council, Bharatiyam and other venues will play host to the performances till April 22.

 From Indian classical dance by Japanese performers and French Mezcal Jazz unit jamming with Bikram Ghosh to a puppet show by Pierre Renaud of Canada, the festival promises to be an interdisciplinary and cross-cultural feast. Various seminars and workshops will be held in tandem with the performances.

 The event has been organised by Young Indians (Yi), in collaboration with Sapphire Creations Dance Workshop. It aims to generate funds for the latest Yi project, called Akshara. The Yi comprises business heads, doctors, bankers and other members of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII). Its motto is ?Country before self, pride and patriotism?.

 ?Instead of just criticising society, we believe in doing something for its betterment,? said Rajesh Poddar, who chairs the Calcutta chapter of Yi. The organisation has several chapters across north and south India, each striving to bring about changes in their region. 

 The city chapter has been supporting two ventures for street children, with the help of Hope Home and another organisation. ?We have vaccinated some of the children, something that has never been done,? said Sareeka Kediaa, a doctor and a member of Yi.

 Surplus funds from Interface 2006 will get the Akshara project off the ground in the city. The aim is to make it as successful as it is in Mumbai and Chennai.

 ?Akshara are support units for schools that have no funds and no infrastructure,? explained Yi member Siddharth Pansari, director of the Pansari Group of Enterprises.

 The cultural world stands to gain much from the Yi support. ?There are only two other such festivals of contemporary arts in India. One of them couldn?t be held this year due to shortage of funds,? pointed out festival director Sudarshan Chakravarty.

 On the opening night, several celebrities will be felicitated, including Usha Ganguli, Harshvardhan Neotia, Mamata Neogi Nakra and Suresh Dutta.

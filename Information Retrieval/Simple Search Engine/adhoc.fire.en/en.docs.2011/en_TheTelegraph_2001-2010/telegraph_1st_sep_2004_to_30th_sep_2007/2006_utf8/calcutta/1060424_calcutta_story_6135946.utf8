The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Gill net takes heavy toll on hilsa

 Kajal Bose: Why has hilsa from the Hooghly and Kolaghat become scarce in the market? Will you import hilsa from Bangladesh this year? 

 Farakka barrage, silting of the river Rupnarayan and indiscriminate use of gill net are the root causes of the decrease in hilsa population in the Hooghly in monsoon.

 Fisheries department has stopped importing hilsa from Bangladesh. But private parties will import hilsa as usual. About 5,000 MT of hilsa is brought to the state every year.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 One-way traffic will ease congestion

 Md. Akram: How to solve the traffic problem in the Burrabazar- Mechhua area is a million-dollar question. Have you chalked out any plan?

 Traffic congestion is a chronic problem in the Burrabazar-Mecchua area. Burrabazar has grown up as the busiest market place for over 150 years, but in an unplanned manner. Hence, free movement of traffic and wholesale markets cannot co-exist here. However, dispersal of the markets and one-way traffic can be one of the solutions. The state government is planning to shift the Burrabazar-Posta markets to Rajarhat. The fruit traders in the Mechhua area have also decided to shift their wholesale transactions from Calcutta to Ankurhati, close to Kona Expressway. If the fruit markets at Posta and Mecchua fruit are shifted out of Calcutta, the traffic problem in the area will be solved automatically.

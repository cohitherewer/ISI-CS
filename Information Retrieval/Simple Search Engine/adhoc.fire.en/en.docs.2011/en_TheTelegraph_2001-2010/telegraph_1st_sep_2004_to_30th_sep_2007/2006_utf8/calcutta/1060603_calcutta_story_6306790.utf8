 The wedlock 

 deadlock

 A moment from Dampati

 Nothing like a Manoj Mitra comedy 

 to cheer you up after a dogs day at work. That is the prevailing 

 response while watching Pratikritis Dampati, one 

 of Mitras many lighter pieces. Of course, he has made his 

 name on the strength of his deeper dramas, that he normally 

 reserves for his own group Sundaram, while providing others 

 with racier scripts like Dampati.

 As the title suggests, Dampati 

 deals with wedlock, rather, deadlock. In the same building 

 reside an older couple (the owners) and a younger couple 

 (the tenants), both not on the happiest of terms in their 

 married lives. The seniors constantly squabble at the top 

 of their voices, but we realise gradually that this is their 

 way of expressing affection. The juniors, stressed out by 

 the drudgery of their daily jobs, cannot manage to keep 

 their flame burning. 

 In both relationships there enters 

 a third party: the neighbourhood doctor, the owners good 

 friend, of whom the wife is enamoured; and the tenant husbands 

 college girlfriend, a femme fatale who appears out of the 

 past to ensnare him.

 The situations could well turn 

 out grim, but Mitra goes down the farcical path, and it 

 is enjoyment most of the way if one wants merely to laugh. 

 The thrust and parry of the senior citizens (acted by the 

 director Alok Deb and Chhanda Chatterjee) appeals most of 

 all, heightened by his fragile health and her shrill soprano.

 Jayanta Datta Barman and Aditi 

 Banerjee portray the more unexceptional young pair, whose 

 story moves in a more typical direction, too, as they head 

 on triangular trysts to Bakkhali shades of many seaside 

 resort adulterous comedies, whether English (Noel Coward) 

 or Bengali (Badal Sircar). There they and we meet perhaps 

 the funniest cameo in the play, Tapan Dasgupta as the stark-eyed 

 hotel manager, who pretends to be hard of hearing so as 

 to get to know of any hanky-panky among his guests.

 Out of the blue, however, in the 

 second act, Mitra throws melodramatic spanners into the 

 works of both plots. Tragedy mixed with comedy has a hoary 

 lineage, but melodrama with farce forms a strange kettle 

 of fish indeed. Suddenly, the stage resembles the tear-soaked 

 screen of a TV soap, equally lathery, making the cast look 

 distinctly uncomfortable. But once Mitra removes the spanners, 

 as arbitrarily as he inserted them, Dampati hastens 

 to its happy ending.

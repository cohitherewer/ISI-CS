In her latest tryst with Bollywood, London-based film-maker 

NASREEN MUNNI KABIR has come out with a book on Guru Dutts letters to wife 

Geeta Dutt. She tells Pratim D. Gupta why every work of an artiste should 

be preserved and published

How did you chance upon these unpublished letters 

by Guru Dutt?

Guru Dutt?s son Arun showed me the letters two years 

ago where the film-maker had written to his wife Geeta Dutt. At that time what 

we had to decide was whether it was good or not to publish these personal letters 

written by a husband to his wife. They were very sad letters and there was nothing 

controversial in the content. It couldn?t have affected his image 40 years after 

he died. All it could have done was help understand his thinking and their relationship 

better. And when Guru Dutt?s son said yes, there was no problem whatsoever.

So why did it take you all this while to come out 

with the collection?

First of all, we wanted to release the book in 2005, 

the 75th birth anniversary of Geeta Dutt. Then, the design for the book was quite 

elaborate. The letters themselves were quite frail. So it took some time to materialise.

Do they offer a deeper insight into Guru Dutt the 

film-maker?

Two Guru Dutt films ? Pyaasa and Kaagaz 

Ke Phool ? are considered to be very autobiographical. That?s something we 

assume. When we see a film and then meet the director, we do not necessarily meet 

the same person that comes across in his work. But when you read that person?s 

letters, you can observe that same character in both his film and his writings. 

Everything of an artiste is worth recording, everything should be preserved.

And do the letters throw any light on his relationship 

with Geeta Dutt?

We usually talk or write or even know very little 

of Guru Dutt?s marriage. We are only concerned about his other relationships. 

But here was this woman who had put her career on hold for her family. So, to 

know about her and their relationship directly from the person 40 years after 

he?s gone is quite a find. It?s a little treasure.

Do you have any of Geeta Dutt?s letters to her 

husband? Did she reply to his letters at all?

She must have, because Guru Dutt mentions in his letters, 

?I got your reply? and ?It was good to hear from you? quite a few times. But we 

do not have any of her letters. Either he did not keep her letters or they were 

destroyed when he died.

Is there any mention of Waheeda Rehman?

There is nothing personal written about her.

Did Guru Dutt write to Geeta Dutt about his film-making 

craft?

He did write to her about the logistics of his work. 

Like, ?Today I finished shooting a song? or something as mundane as that. There 

is not one line boasting of his status as a film-maker. He seems full of self-doubt 

in the letters.

Did he write about the renunciation of the world, 

something that came across often in his movies?

He writes, ?I wish I could be as dead as death can 

be?. He asks often in his letters, ?Why am I living?? Yes, there is a lot of suicidal 

thinking in his letters.

Do you guide the readers to what the letters mean?

The letters are self-explanatory. I did not go for 

assumption or speculation because one has to respect the dead. You have to remember 

these letters were not meant for publication. I did it because there is the archival 

rule that 30 years after a person?s death, his personal things can be made public 

with consent of his family. All I have done in the book is given footnotes to 

each letter to put the writings in minimum context. Say, if in one of the letters, 

he mentions ?Mama?s place?, I have written that Mama is Mr Benegal, his uncle?

For a documentary film-maker like yourself, what 

was it like working on a book like this?

I had done a long biography on Guru Dutt in 1996. 

So this was like a natural progression for me. You can say I just pressed the 

reset button on the computer.

This comes just after your documentation of Shah 

Rukh Khan?s life in The Inner World and The Outer World of Shah Rukh 

Khan?

Yes, when I spoke to Shah Rukh, I could see a certain 

sadness in him. Despite all the success and the glamour that is there, the personal 

conflicts are always there. That Shah Rukh lost his parents so early in his life 

will always haunt him. I saw a similar sadness in Guru Dutt around his personal 

life. I guess that?s the commonality between the two works of mine.

Compared to this, translating Javed Akhtar?s songs 

(Talking Songs) must have been a lot easier?

Not at all. Translating poetry is difficult in itself. 

And it becomes terribly difficult to translate songs. Without music, the lyrics 

are just half the story. Even Paul McCartney?s Yesterday sounds so flat 

on paper. It is the music, the instruments, the voices? that make all the difference. 

What I did was just translate the meaning of the words of Javed Akhtar?s songs 

so that people who do not understand Hindi or Urdu can at least follow the meaning. 

Say a Kuch na kaho is Don?t say a word?

What are you on to next?

I am documenting the making of the stage version of 

Lord of the Rings in Canada, which has music by A.R. Rahman. That?s the 

only Indian connection.

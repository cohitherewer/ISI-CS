 Lakh damages for cancer test flip-flop

 ANINDYA SENGUPTA

 The state consumer disputes redressal commission has slapped a penalty of Rs 1 lakh on a diagnostic centre for wrongly diagnosing a person with cancer.

 Suraksha Diagnostic and Eye Research Private Limited, at P-116, CIT Road, has been asked to pay Rs 1 lakh as compensation to Dipak Ranjan Sen, 63, managing director of Peak Chemical Industries Ltd, Siliguri. Chief pathologist of the centre K.K. Bhattacharyya will have to shell out Rs 10,000.

 The commission?s June 6 order states: ?There is no denying the fact that the complainant moved like a shuttle cock from Siliguri to Bangalore to Calcutta to Siliguri and to Bangalore again? (and ) had to incur substantial expenditure as the journeys were by air? all these days he was subjected to severe mental distress and agony till he got the green signal that there was no cancerous growth in his tissue.??

 Sen undertook his trip from Bagdogra to Bangalore, via Calcutta, in July 2001.

 The order says that the compensation will have to be paid within 60 days, failing which an interest of 10 per cent per annum will have to be paid on the amount till it is paid in full.

 Sen, suffering from abdominal pain, underwent a laparoscopy in June 2001 and had his gall bladder removed. The gall bladder and a gall stone were sent to Suraksha for histopathology test. The centre?s report, signed by its chief pathologist, says: ?The section from the gall bladder shows picture of mucin secreting adino-carcinoma infiltrating the gall bladder associated with cholecystitis??.

 It meant aggressive cancerous cells were found in the gall bladder. Two slides were enclosed with the report.

 The report left Sen and his family disturbed. His brother suffered a heart attack. 

 On the advice of doctors, Sen consulted G. Kilare, chief oncologist at Bangalore-based St John?s Medical College. Kilare advised Sen to send the slides to consulting surgical pathologist Kanan Gharpure for a review. Accordingly, the slides were sent in July 2001. 

 Gharpure, in his report of July 20, 2001, said: ?Please check if the slides are correct??.

 Sen then asked the diagnostic centre to find out the gall bladder sample and gall stone, mentioning that its report was not in conformity with Gharpure?s findings.

 After having found out the sample, Suraksha?s chief pathologist conducted another examination and stated that there were only infective disorders in the gall bladder and that nothing cancerous was found.

 The complainant again sent the slides to Gharpure, on the basis of which the latter prepared a report stating that there was ?no malignancy??. 

 Asked about his misleading report, chief pathologist Bhattacharyya said he had apologised to Sen. 

 Sen is happy that ?justice has not been denied? to him.

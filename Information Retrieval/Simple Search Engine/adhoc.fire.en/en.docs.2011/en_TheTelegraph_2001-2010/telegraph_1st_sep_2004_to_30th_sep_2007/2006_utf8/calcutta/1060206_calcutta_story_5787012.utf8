 LIFESTYLE ZONE 

 Tucked away inside a narrow, dingy lane in Bhowanipore is a treasure trove of designer wear. Virgo, a multi-label boutique at 19A, Ram Mohan Datta Road, is home to fashionable collects from all over the country.

 Proprietor Ritu Sonthalia took over the boutique two-and-a-half years ago. Designing has always been a passion. Earlier I used to retail on a smaller scale from my home but ever since Virgo happened there has been no looking back, smiles Ritu.

 Virgo started off with in-house creations and gradually made space for mid-level design labels of Calcutta and other cities.

 Earlier the store with its in-house creations catered mostly to the youngsters. But I made an effort to provide options for all ages. Variety and diversity are essential to build a steady clientele, she feels.

 The in-house label Rave rubs shoulders with various local ones as well as brands like Ravina from Bangalore and Chhaya Modi from Mumbai at this 480 sq ft store.

 Suit style

 The salwar suit section is an assortment of formals, semi-formals and casuals. In keeping with the current trend, the uppers stop just above the knee in almost all the lines. The fabrics are cotton, cotton silks, georgettes and crepes.

 Formal suits are co-ordinated with crushed, applique work dupattas. Suits with coin work catch the eye. If sober is more your style, block print pieces with a bit of highlighting here and there, batik crepes and georgettes could be your pick.

 The casuals are mostly in cottons. The designs are a melange of floral and abstract patterns and there are innovations on the dupattas in the form of frills and ruffles.

 Unstitched materials with aari, stones and mirror work are also on offer.

 Prices start at Rs 1,500 and go up to Rs 8,000.

 Sari saga

 Sensuous chiffons and georgettes rule the sari section. Simple printed ones with crochet edges, florals highlighted with sequins, kantha stitched and the embroidered variety make up the range. Lucknow chikankari saris come in hues of peaches and blues.

 The drapes come with matching blouses, often heavily embroidered. The price tags read anything between 2,500 and Rs 10,000. 

 Party pick

 A separate section of party garb is a recent addition to the store. Here the fabrics used are georgettes, cottons, stretch materials and crepe. 

 If you have a figure to flaunt tank tops, ones embellished with a series of closely placed sequins could be your pick. In summer you team them with skirts or trousers, in winter a blazer over it would look stylish, says Ritu. Georgette ponchos, printed or in vibrant solid hues, look cool. Then there are tops with leather embellishments and some with crochet sleeves.

 The range of skirts, mostly in earthy hues, will spoil you for choice. There are kantha embroidered ones with slits on the sides, those with tiny bead work all over and some with zari borders. 

 The showstealer, however, is a layered skirt in a combination of pink, mauve and purple. Just below the waist, a beautiful floral pattern accentuates the effect. The skirts can be teamed with an array of matching stoles.The collection starts at Rs 500. 

 Add ons 

 Smart and sleek, earrings and wristlets from the brand Acme throw up good buys.

 l in silver, they are studded with semi-precious stones in blue, lemon, orange and pink. Some ornate and others simple, the jewellery is a blend of traditional and geometric motifs. Danglers in dewdrop shapes and pyramid motifs with long extensions from the edges can be teamed with Indian as well as western outfits.

 You also have jamevar bags, hard bags with aari work and batuas with beaded tie ons. The jewellery is priced at Rs 1,500-plus.

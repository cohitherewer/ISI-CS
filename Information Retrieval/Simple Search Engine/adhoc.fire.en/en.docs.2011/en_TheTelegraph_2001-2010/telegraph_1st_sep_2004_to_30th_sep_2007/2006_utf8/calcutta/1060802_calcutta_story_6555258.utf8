 Late result trips students

 - Part II examinees unsure about joining outstation courses

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 After the delayed examination, the after-effects.

 In the balance hangs the academic careers of a few hundred meritorious students, who had appeared in the current years BA, B.Sc and B.Com (honours) Part II examinations of Calcutta University (CU) and have already managed seats in reputable institutions outside Bengal.

 These students are unsure about whether or not they will be able to continue with the courses in the outstation institutions as the CU authorities still have not announced the final date of publishing the results of the Part II examinations.

 University officers said the process of declaring the results is getting delayed because the Part II examinations had to be postponed for more than a month this time. 

 The exams were originally slated from April 17. But they had to be deferred till May 23 as the earlier dates overlapped with the five-phase Assembly elections.

 Many of the bright BA, B.Sc and B.Com Part II examinees have got berths in postgraduate courses in institutions such as Jawaharlal Nehru University, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Delhi University, Benaras Hindu University and also in a number of postgraduate institutions in other cities such as Mumbai, Chennai, Pune and Bangalore.

 After clearing an admission test, I have got a seat in a postgraduate course in AIIMS, Delhi. My career will be jeopardised if my Part II results are not declared within the next few days, said a student of physiology of Presidency College.

 The AIIMS authorities have set August 16 as the deadline for the student to submit his marksheet.

 Another student of Gokhale Memorial College said she has given up hopes of studying MA in English in Delhi University, despite managing a seat there after clearing the admission test. She has not been able to submit her BA Part II (English honours) marksheet. The admissions to the MA English course in Delhi University closed about 10 days ago. 

 The students grievances are genuine and we are sorry for the way they are suffering. But we are helpless, Suranjan Das, CU pro vice-chancellor (academic affairs) said. 

 Although this year about 200 students were issued provisional marksheets, institutions outside Bengal are not accepting these, students said.

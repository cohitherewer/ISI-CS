 Upgrade for abattoirs

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Acting on orders of the Supreme Court and the Central Pollution Control Board, the civic authorities are preparing a modernisation programme for the old and unhygienic abattoirs in Tangra and other places. 

 The state animal husbandry department has offered Rs 3.5 crore for the modernisation of the century-old slaughterhouse in Tangra, the biggest and oldest among the four abattoirs run by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC). 

 The others are in Allen Market, Halsibagan and on Govinda Khatik Road (where pigs are slaughtered).

 The state pollution control board (PCB) has drawn up technical guidelines for the upgrade of the Tangra unit and asked the CMC to submit a status report on it and a ?rough sketch? of the modernisation plan by March 30.

 The PCB will forward the status report to the central board, which will submit it to the Supreme Court in April.

 Municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay will visit the slaughterhouse on Wednesday morning. He will be the first civic commissioner to inspect an abattoir.

 ?Under the CMC Act, 1980, animals cannot be slaughtered in the open or even in a meat shop. However, open slaughtering is rampant in the city. We want a central abattoir with all modern facilities,? said Biswajit Mukherjee, senior law officer in the PCB.

 The Supreme Court order, he pointed out, is not applicable to the CMC alone, but to all civic bodies across the country. Last year, the court had directed the central green board to submit status reports on the condition of slaughterhouses in all cities and towns.

 An attempt at modernising the abattoir was made in 1999, when it was included in the Rs 1,830-crore Calcutta Environment Improvement Project, funded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB). But nothing came out of it.

 Australian firm Aegis, engaged by ADB to prepare a report on the slaughterhouse, had commented: ?The environment is primitive, aesthetically degrading and absolutely unacceptable in modern days.?

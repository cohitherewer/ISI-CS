 Her claim to fame may primarily be as an environment scientist/activist. But the woman being Vandana Shiva, you can always look forward to some meaty arguments and a new perspective from her, even if the subject of her speech is ?Women?s Right in Today?s India?. 

 And the lady did not disappoint when she took the podium at the Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture to deliver the Mrs Sukhnandan Bhagat Memorial Lecture on Tuesday.

 Shiva, who as a child had participated in the Chipko movement of 1970s, when ?women were hugging trees to protect them?, has always been quick to take in the wider scheme of things. She is an environmentalist, physicist, ecofeminist and philosopher rolled into one. 

 Director of the Research Foundation of Science, Technology and Natural Resource Policy, Shiva is credited with successful movements like Navdanya (1991) and Bija Vidyapeeth. Her life is a war against patenting of life, water privatisation, mutation, monoculture and intellectual property rights.

 Shiva?s RKM lecture was a reiteration of her belief that today?s sanskriti is really ?vikriti?, which instead of holding society together was causing an erosion of values. 

 Women in the new age of globalisation were losing their right to ensuring food and water security for their families, a role they have played for thousands of years. ?Instead of a society which sees women as an extension of the sacred feminine, we have a commodification of women.? 

 The new patriarchy is threatening women even before birth. Shiva quoted billboards ? ?Better Rs 5,000 now than Rs 5 lakh later? ? advertising female foeticide as the best way to avoid paying a dowry. To Shiva, this attitude is linked to the collective selfishness and callousness displayed towards environment.

 Instead of adopting time-tested indigenous wisdom and methods like neem extracts, farmers are urged to use chemicals and toxin-producing bacteria to control pests. 

 Putting words to action, Shiva is, in 2006, stepping up her plans for organic farming and is currently in Calcutta sounding out NGOs, corporate and government officials.

 No film star has a stake in it, but the sizzling steaks have made the likes of Salman Khan, Madhuri Dixit and the John-Bipasha duo a regular at Kobe, the sizzlers address in Mumbai. 

 The star connection does not end there. Quality Leisure and Lifestyle Private Limited, the company that has tied up with Sushmita Sen to open her lounge on Shakespeare Sarani in August, is bringing Kobe to Calcutta.

 Kobe, the Mumbai-based sizzlers restaurant, was started in 1977. It has been named after the Japanese city famous for its beef and steaks. The 30-year-old Kobe is coming to West Bengal by the Bengali New Year. And the first restaurant where Kobe will serve its Pepper Steaks and Chicken Satellites will be in City Centre.

 ?The City Centre restaurant will be spread over 2,000 sq ft. The sizzlers segment in the city is completely uncharted. Our aim is to fill up that void,? says Abhradeepa Dutta, spokesperson for Quality Leisure and Lifestyles. ?The target clientele will be the youth. Sizzlers fit their lifestyle because they are fast, filling and affordable,? adds Dutta. 

 The first Kobe outlet came up at Opera House, Mumbai, in 1977 and over the years, its sizzlers became famous specially with film stars and industrialists. ?We decided to expand Kobe in 2000 and now, we have six outlets in Mumbai and two in Pune,? says Kailash Sheth, co-owner of Kobe. 

 The sizzlers chain will expand in the east much faster. ?After the standalone restaurant comes up, the priority will be the other malls in the city,? says Dutta.

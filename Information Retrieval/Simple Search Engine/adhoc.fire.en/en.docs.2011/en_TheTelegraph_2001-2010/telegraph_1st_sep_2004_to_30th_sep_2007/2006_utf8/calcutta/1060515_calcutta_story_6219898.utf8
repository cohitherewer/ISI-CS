 Realty gets green monitor

 - Motivating builders to use eco-friendly resources

 A STAFF REPORTER

Bengal?s realty has seen a tremendous surge in recent times. While Calcutta?s skyline continues to have new additions on a regular basis, a more serious issue of the ecological impact of such large-scale construction on the environment is being raised increasingly.

 With regulations on building norms coming into effect and environment-impact assessment (EIA) becoming a byword, an increasing number of real estate developers are abiding by the ?green? norms.

 To motivate city realtors to use environment-friendly resources in their buildings, the Indian Green Building Council (IGBC) launched its Calcutta chapter on Friday. 

 The IGBC, which has a one-point agenda to create a green building movement in the country, promotes usage of recyclable materials like fly-ash bricks and high-performance glass in construction.

 Rahul Saraf, chairman, IGBC Calcutta chapter, said: ?The objective of a green building is to save on power and fresh water consumption, cut down on sewage discharge and achieve reduction of carbon emission. A green building is much more eco-friendly and cost-efficient than a normal building.?

 The IGBC has a tie-up with the US Green Building Council (USGBC) and has signed an MoU with the state of Victoria, Australia, to promote research and networking. 

 ?The construction industry uses up almost 10 per cent of the energy generated and 10 per cent of water consumed in the country. Natural resources are dwindling at an alarming pace and we need to take quick measures so that the resources sustain over a longer period of time,? Saraf pointed out.

 Also present at the launch were Sudip K. Banerjee, chairman, Pollution Control Board, and representatives of the USGBC, Sabrina Morelli and Scott Horst.

 ?Since the energy used in India is mostly thermal power, the impact on the environment is even greater. Buildings that follow green norms end up conserving energy through measures such as ground water recharging and rainwater harvesting,? said Banerjee.

 He also stressed that henceforth, all new buildings will have to get a certification from the pollution control board that they do not violate environment norms. He said the government was open to offering certain tax benefits or incentives for buildings adhering to green norms.

 ?The formation of the Calcutta chapter is critical to take the green movement forward. Realty in Bengal is seeing unprecedented movement and we have to make sure that developers understand and implement environment-friendly methods in their construction activity,? signed off Saraf.

 Leather in 

 the line of fire 

 - Exporters face flak from buyers in Topsia blaze wake

 SOHINI MOOKHERJEE

 The flames that leapt up in a Topsia sweatshop early on November 22, claiming the lives of 11 workers who had been locked in for the night, are now licking at the heels of the local leather industry.

 Facing the heat from international clients are leather goods exporters, many of whom run sweatshops manned by boys in the Topsia-Tiljala-Tangra belt. The tight-lipped leather units are facing a barrage of queries from buyers on the nature of the blaze, the working conditions in the factories, the alleged use of child labour and more.

 A lot of websites prominently featured the horrific accident, many of them referring to The Telegraph reports. This is bound to impact exports, said an official of the Council of Leather Exports, the apex body of leather exporters.

 An Australian client of a leading leather exporter has asked its city-based supplier to clear the confusion over employing child labour before despatching its next consignment of leather bags.

 Annual leather exports from India stand at $2.7 billion, with around 15 per cent coming from units in Bengal. With the export earnings projected to grow to $7 billion by 2010, the leather industry has sounded the alarm bell and planned damage-control measures.

 Child labour and other inhuman practices are prevalent in outsourced units making leather items, admitted an industry veteran.

 To keep a vigil on such units, the leather council has decided to despatch inspectors for random checks. The council will also push for a ban on leather units irrespective of size in residential areas.

 33C Topsia Road, the site of last weeks blaze, housed leather bag-making units in the middle of a crowded residential area.

 Our objective is to generate awareness so that the owners press for best practices from vendors. This is a must if they have to do business with international clients, said a member of the council. 

 Disciplining the industry is the need of the hour. The carpet industry in Jammu and Kashmir and the Sivakasi fireworks companies treaded the same path, after being slapped with charges of labour law malpractice and use of underage children, said S. S. Kumar, former chairman of the council.

 That would be easier said than done in the Topsia-Tiljala zone where illegal buildings housing illegal leather units have mushroomed in the past few years.

 To avoid a repeat of the Topsia tragedy, the council set up in July 1984 to promote leather exports and steer development of the leather industry in India will be hosting a team of German experts next month to introduce cost-effective safety measures in city-based leather units.

 The council has also decided to place a demand before the state government that smaller leather units be to provided space near Bantala Leather Complex, till now the preserve of big tanneries.

 In a related development, the state government said on Tuesday that showcause notices would be slapped on tanneries that had booked space in the Calcutta Leather Complex (CLC) in Bantala, but are operating illegally from elsewhere in the city.

 Commerce and industry secretary Sabyasachi Sen said these tanneries are foiling government plans. Of the 200-odd tanneries that had booked space at the CLC, only 75 have moved in so far.

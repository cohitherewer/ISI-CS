 Its not your regular, run-of-the-mill sanitary ware showroom. Situated in the heart of the city at 38B, Elgin Road, opposite Forum Mall, Designer Home is a swank one-stop shop, which offers customers a wide range of solutions for bathroom and flooring needs.

 Spread over 5,000 sq ft, Designer Home aims at being a complete home solution provider, cashing in on Calcuttas love affair with real estate.

 Most of the establishments dealing in sanitary ware in Calcutta are built on small concepts. They do not sell solutions, only products. This is where we feel there is a lot of potential yet to be tapped. We aim to cater to everybody, regardless of his or her budget, pointed out Rohit Sarda, director, Designer Home Solutions Pvt Ltd.

 Designer Home, which stocks some of the leading Indian and international sanitary ware and flooring tile brands including Kohler, Jaguar, Palladio and Frande, has a team of in-house designers and customer executives to guide you in choosing what suits your needs best. You can choose from over 400 varieties of floor and wall tiles, including brands such as Johnson Tiles and Ratnagiri Designer Tiles.

 Flooring and wall tiles is a booming sector today, a cost-effective answer to marble. We have tied up with some of the best in the market and imported a lot of them from Italy, Spain, China and Turkey, said Sarda.

 From 3D images of bathrooms to live working displays of taps and showers to check the flow of water, the lifestyle designer showroom plans on offering a number of value additions to its customers. If a customer buys any product from us, the designing fees are completely waived, said Sarda.

 The price ranges for the sanitary ware products vary, depending on the brand. Basins can range from Rs 2,000 to Rs 90,000, while showerheads and WCs can set you back by Rs 2.5 lakh. Designer Home keeps complete bathroom packages as well, which includes shower mixers, showers, spout and basin mixers. The price of the package ranges from Rs 6,000 to Rs 15,000. 

 oor tiles price ranges between Rs 25 per sq ft and Rs 50 per sq ft. Imported floor and wall tiles from Europe are little more expensive, ranging from Rs 100 to Rs 400 per sq ft. If you are not too ecologically conscious, you can always go for the complete wooden flooring, which can set you back by a cool Rs 240 per sq ft. 

 But as Sarda pointed out, the budget consumer would definitely find something appropriate for his or her home as well.

 With a tagline of Where bathrooms talk, Designer Home aims to capture the citys lifestyle market in a big way. There is a huge market for this in Calcutta, especially with the economy doing well and people willing to spend, signed off Sarda.

 A play that provides clear insight into the common destiny of women, Shanu Roychowdhury lays bare the apathetic, depressing life-story of its eponymous protagonist. It reveals how, in fulfilling duties and obligations to their families, women are crushed by their own unspent energies and unrealised dreams, and burn out before they get a chance to discover themselves. The play begins with Shanu, a middle-aged wife and mother, recounting her past on reaching the twilight of her life. As she introspects, she realises that she has changed a great deal, so much so, she can barely recognise herself! Lively and playful in her youth, she now dreads life beyond the four walls of her house, having been confined within them for years. Her existence limited to the care and welfare of her husband and children, her own identity has slowly, inexorably been buried beneath the burden of responsibilities, and she has become a mere shadow of her former self. Performed solo by Swatilekha Sengupta. Direction: Rudraprasad Sengupta.

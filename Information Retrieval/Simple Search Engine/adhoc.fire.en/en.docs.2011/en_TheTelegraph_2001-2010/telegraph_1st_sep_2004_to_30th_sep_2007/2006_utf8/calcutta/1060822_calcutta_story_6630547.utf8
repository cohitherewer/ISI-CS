 Dual affiliation.

 Calcutta schools are opening up by introducing a new school education system that of one address offering courses under two different boards.

 The state government has received nearly a dozen applications from schools seeking permission for dual affiliation. Some are gunning for an ICSE/CBSE plus Madhyamik combination, others for ICSE /CBSE plus an international board, and a few for Madhyamik plus international board, confirm officials of the state school education department.

 Dual affiliations will give students the chance to choose a board depending on their requirement. That, say officials, is often dictated by their parents pursuits.

 A new segment of parents has emerged in every big city, particularly with the information technology (IT) boom, that frequently has to move from one city to another in India and also abroad. This trend is now increasing in Calcutta and so many schools are wanting dual affiliations, observes Sukumar Mahapatra of the state school education department.

 Since the state government can only issue no-objection certificates for ICSE and CBSE courses, schools aiming for affiliation with an international board like Cambridge or Edexcel or International Baccalaureate must apply to the Centre.

 Nanda Chatterjee, principal of Cambridge School, says: The international system of education is recognised nationally and internationally. The classes are small and so, the individual attention is greater. Students are encouraged to think, express and hone skills, and so they enjoy this method of learning more.

 Chatterjee, who was with Calcutta International School for 28 years, feels that compared with some other metros, parents in Calcutta are more conservative and so they prefer the state and Delhi boards. But the trend is changing, she stresses.

 South Point is one prominent name in the dual-board crossover mode. It will soon add CBSE to its current quiver of Madhyamik and Higher Secondary boards. 

 We have got a green signal from the CBSE and also the state government for the new affiliation, says Krishna Damani of South Point. The CBSE course will enable us to cater to the parents engaged in the IT industry.

 The St Augustine group, now following ICSE, is aiming to add Cambridge or Edexcel, while Future Campus School hopes to add an international board to its CBSE curriculum.

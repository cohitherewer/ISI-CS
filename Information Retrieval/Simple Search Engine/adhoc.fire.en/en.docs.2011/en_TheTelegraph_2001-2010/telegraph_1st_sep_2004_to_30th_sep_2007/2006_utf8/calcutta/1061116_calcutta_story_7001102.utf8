 After Lufthansa, Eurofly, an Italian carrier, which will launch operations between Delhi and Rome in January 2007, is planning direct flights from Calcutta, too.

 Airline officers, during a visit to the city on Tuesday, conducted a market survey and also held meetings with travel agents in the city. 

 After Delhi, we have plans to launch operations from a number of cities in India, including Calcutta, said Lalit Khosla, area manager, India, Eurofly.

 The airline will operate between Delhi and Rome three times a week, from January 15, on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays.

 Launched in 1989, Eurofly was earlier the official chartered airline of Alitalia. Presently, it is owned by Effe Luxembourg, a private equity fund. 

 Eurofly operates direct flights to international destinations like Sri Lanka and the Maldives. It also operates chartered flights to the Caribbean and New York.

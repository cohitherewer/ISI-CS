 Cable owes, viewer pays

 SAMARPAN DUTTA

 A cable crackdown could cost the consumer dear. The state government has decided to freeze the bank accounts of four city-based multi-system operators (MSOs), for their failure to clear amusement tax dues. The service providers, in turn, have threatened to pass on the burden to the consumer.

 Representatives of the MSOs Manthan Broadband, SitiCable, Indian Cablenet and Cablecom said anything between Rs 10 and Rs 40 could be added to the subscribers monthly cable bill if the government stuck to its pay-or-freeze stand.

 Amusement tax is meant to be picked up from the viewers. Why should we suffer? demanded an MSO official.

 Sources in the state finance department, however, ruled out a rollback, saying the rules clearly empower the government to freeze the accounts of the MSOs for payment default.

 They refused to pay the tax and then dragged the government to court. When the high court ruled in the governments favour, they moved the Supreme Court. That appeal was rejected in June, explained an official.

 MSO representatives then met finance minister Asim Dasgupta and requested for a waiver. The plea was turned down and a pay-up date set. That deadline has passed.

 According to sources, Manthan, SitiCable, Indian Cablenet and Cablecom owe the government around Rs 6 crore, Rs 7 crore, Rs 11 crore and Rs 19 lakh, respectively, for the fiscal 2003-04. 

 They will also have to pay an interest on the outstanding amount, said an official.

 As for the hike in the subscription rates, Sudip Ghosh of Manthan said: If the rollback does not happen, we will raise it by Rs 30 to Rs 40.

 Dilip Singh Mehta, of Cablecom, said the hike will not be less than Rs 10. We hope the government will agree to our plea and waive the arrears accrued since 1999. Otherwise, we will pass on the amount to our subscribers.

 But will the tax tussle trigger a cable blackout? Under Trai regulations, there must be a months notice before any channel is taken off air. So, there is no immediate danger, said an MSO official.

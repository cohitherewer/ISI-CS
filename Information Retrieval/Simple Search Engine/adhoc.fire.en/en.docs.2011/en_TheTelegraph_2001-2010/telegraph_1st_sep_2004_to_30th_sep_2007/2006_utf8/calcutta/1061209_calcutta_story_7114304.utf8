 An honest, ordinary man

 What does Ratan Chakraborty do when he stumbles upon a folder carrying cash that adds up to more than his annual income? He pauses for a moment, fights back a brief bout of temptation, and then sets out to return the money to its rightful owner.

 Ratan is like any other autorickshaw driver. For seven years, day in and day out, he has been ferrying passengers between Garia and Gol Park to sustain his family.

 Monday began no differently, but ended with a dramatic twist for the man from Jadavpurs Sree Colony.

 Around 7 that evening, Ratan found a folder in his auto after some passengers got off at Garia. I kept the folder with me and continued ferrying passengers. After a couple of trips, I opened the folder out of curiosity and found Rs 39,500 inside, along with some documents. For a while, I was not sure what to do, recounted Ratan.

 For the man who earns Rs 3,000 a month to make ends meet wife Tripti is a housewife and son Rahul studies in Class IX of a local school this could have been a windfall. But it did not take him long to make up his mind.

 Ratan went straight to the Garia-Gol Park Auto Union office and deposited the folder. It was opened by union secretary Dilip Das in the presence of others. He then alerted Garia police outpost.

 The folder contained the address of an artists association named Forum 91. At the thana, we learnt that its secretary Tarak Garai and member Tapan Mitra had reported the folder missing at Jadavpur police station, said Das.

 On Thursday, Ratan handed over the folder to Garai. Forum 91 will felicitate him during its annual exhibition in February for his extraordinary act.

 I am working hard to help my son build a career. If I resort to dishonest means, my dream will not be fulfilled. My family and the drivers on the route are proud of what I did, smiled Ratan.

 Bird flu test drive put off

 KINSUK BASU

 The scheduled start of the bird flu tests in Calcutta on April 15 has been put off, following the Centre?s inability to send the antigen, serum and the necessary kits and documents.

 The state government had planned to conduct the test for detecting the H5N1 virus (which causes avian flu) at the Regional Disease Diagnostic Laboratory, in Belgachhia. 

 The state animal resources development department has thrice placed requests for the kits with the High Security Animal Disease Laboratory, in Bhopal, the only centre in the country where such tests are conducted.

 But with no response from any quarter, the department has decided to abandon the project for the time being.

 ?We have sent several reminders for the items, but in vain,? said Jawahar Lal Chakrabarty, assistant director in the animal resources development department. 

 ?As of now, we can?t do anything and will have to depend on the Bhopal centre for the tests. The assurance for the kits has not been withdrawn. The project will roll on as soon as we get them,? he added.

 Besides the antigen and serum, the laboratory needs to have a detailed specification of a bio-safety security cabinet and a letter of authorisation from the director of the Bhopal centre to conduct the tests. 

 ?The bio-hazard cabinet is a must, as it helps control air flow. It allows 70 per cent of the air in the laboratory to be released outside and also treats the air being released with formalin to kill the viruses. Unless we have the specification, we can?t place an order for the cabinet,? pointed out a laboratory insider. 

 Had the kits and the necessary documents arrived, the Regional Disease Diagnostic Laboratory would have been the second facility in the country equipped for the avian flu tests. 

 The animal resources development department had made a strong pitch with the Centre for the Belgachhia facility, which caters to 11 states, including the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. 

 Even two senior scientists from the laboratory had attended a training session in Bhopal on March 23 and 24 on how to conduct the tests. 

 State representatives had also rooted for the Belgachhia centre at a meeting with WHO officials in Pune on April 7 and 8.

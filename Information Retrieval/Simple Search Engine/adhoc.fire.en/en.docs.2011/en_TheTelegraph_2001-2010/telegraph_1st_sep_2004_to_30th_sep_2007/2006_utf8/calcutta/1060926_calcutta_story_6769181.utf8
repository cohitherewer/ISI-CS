 When Barbie visited India, her pink skin turned wheatish and she wore a sari. When Barbie went to Africa, she was very tanned, with a hint of African features. The same seems to be happening to Ma Durga.

 Members of Jukta Sangha, on Dhakuria East Road, have taken Durga out of her known environs and placed her in a temple in Africa. Banners put up in the locality announce Chalo Jai Africa. 

 This year, our theme is Africa not any particular place or area, but the culture of the continent in general, said Subhendu Saha, a committee member. We started experimenting with themes from last year. In 2005, we built a fishing village and got a very good response. 

 The pandal will be modelled on a temple in Ghana. Jute and thatch are being used to achieve a raw, rustic look. Colourful masks and handicrafts will also be put up and huge African drums will be played along with dhaks. 

 But the real innovation is the image of the Devi. She will look Afro, too. 

 Our idol has to blend with our theme. We plan to dress the idol in the bright colours of Africa, said Saha.

 But the Durga has not won everyones devotion. One of them is the idol-maker, Sanatan Rudra Pal. We had wanted the idol to have a completely African look, but our protima shilpi was not keen on it, Saha added. 

 Pal was reluctant to gift the Mother African features. How can we worship someone who doesnt look like Durga? asked the unhappy artist, known for his sabeki (traditional) idols. He said he accepted the job because the para people were insistent. 

 I will only give the Devis features a hint of an African look. Also, the complexion wont be completely black, added Pal.

 Does the city mind? Prasanta Roy, who teaches sociology at Presidency College, believes there are no deep social implications. As to why Durga is fair and Kali black, I think it is simply to differentiate their forms. As far as I know, it has no scriptural backing. Nor is there any debate of Aryan and Dravidian forms involved.

 Arijit Raychoudhury, proprietor of the Gupta Press, the almanac, pointed out: Traditionally, she is to be dudhe-alta (rose-complexioned), because her abode is in the hills.

 Pranabeswar Nanda, principal of Sri Sitaram Vaidik Mahavidyalaya, asserted that worshipping the Devi is meaningless when her image is distorted.

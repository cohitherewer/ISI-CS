 Extortionists shoot at trader kin

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Two men, in their early thirties, opened fire on the brother of a circus-owner at their residence on crowded Sandal Street, off Ripon Street, around 10.30 on Monday morning. 

 The men were apparently trying to extort money from Jainul Haq, alias Vicky, the circus-owner. His brother was not hit.

 Sandal Street falls under the jurisdiction of Park Street police. The cops said only one round was fired, but people in the area claimed to have heard two rounds. 

 ?We have so far learnt that two men, named Sadik and Nanu, entered Haq?s house in the morning and shot at his brother. It appears that the duo had been demanding money from the circus-owner for the past few days. Unable to get anything out of him, they turned up at his residence. No one was injured and the men couldn?t take away any money,? stated N. Ramesh Babu, deputy commissioner of police (south).

 Sadik and Nanu had been calling up Haq on his mobile phone and asking for Rs 1 lakh, Babu added. 

 Sadik, a resident of Rajabazar, had reportedly teamed up with Nanu, from Topsia, a few months ago and had been extorting traders in the Ripon Street-Park Street area. According to police, Sadik was associated with Sona, a dreaded extortionist, in his heyday.

 On Monday, Sadik and Nanu arrived in the area on a motorcycle and asked a few local residents about the location of Haq?s house. They parked the two-wheeler outside and stepped in, claiming to be the circus-owner?s acquaintances.

 Unable to find Haq, who was not in the house, they stepped into the room of his brother Md Rabiul, alias Rabi. Once inside, Sadik opened fire. The two escaped before others in the house could raise an alarm. 

 ?Sadik is a known face and had been arrested in the past. He is going to be held again soon,? asserted Gyanwant Singh, the detective chief of Calcutta Police.

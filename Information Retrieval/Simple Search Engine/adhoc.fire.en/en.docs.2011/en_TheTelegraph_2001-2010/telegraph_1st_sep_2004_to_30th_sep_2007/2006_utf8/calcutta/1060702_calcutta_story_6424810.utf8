 A new challenge

 Ujjaini: Not being able to make it in Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Challenge did hurt, but the elimination turned out to be a great motivation for me. After I lost out in that contest, I did get to sing for Aadesh Srivastava in Alag. Then Gajsaab (Zee TV show producer-director Gajendra Singh) called up and told me about the concept of Ek Main Aur Ek Tu and I was really happy to find a new challenge.

 Aishwarya: I was very disappointed when I couldnt progress in the Challenge rounds. The whole world had come crashing down. It was only because of the support of my parents that I was able to recover from the shock. I had gone back to my hometown in Muzaffarpur and regrouped in 10-15 days. Then Gajendraji called me and described the new jodi concept he had in mind. I was back in the reckoning! 

 Picking a partner

 Ujjaini: Before the start of the new show, we were given options to choose our partner for the contest. I was to pick two names and if any one of them picked me, we were to become partners straightaway. So I chose Aishwarya and Aishwarya chose me and we were on. The reason I picked him in the first place was because I felt we two have great vocal chemistry. 

 Aishwarya: Of the two options I had, Ujjaini was my first choice. She has a thorough musical understanding and our thoughts match. Also, we have the same lucky number ? one. The first time I saw her singing in Challenge, I felt that there was something about her. Our choice of songs was also similar and that made me confident that maybe we can go all the way. 

 Duet vs solo 

 Ujjaini: Singing with someone is very different from singing solo and very difficult too. When I am singing alone, I dont need to care about anybody but when its a duet, I have to be very aware of what he is singing, when I have to pick up the cue and make sure that the chemistry works. Its a much larger effort.

 Aishwarya: I am well aware that the people have not picked me alone and they have voted for the two of us. But I would like to point out that it is the individual effort from both of us that has resulted in such great performances. So, I am sure now that we will go about our individual careers, we will be appreciated for our solo efforts. Of course we will be performing at a lot of shows together but I am confident I will also make it on my own.

 Judges as mentors

 Ujjaini: Hariji (Hariharan) and Lezji (Leslie Lewis) were just great and they gave us a lot of support. They turned out to be our mentors as they pointed out our flaws without even letting us realise that we were making mistakes. 

 Aishwarya: I owe my success to the two judges, Leslie Lewis and Hariharan. I always used to sing with a very husky voice and they pointed out that it was not the best thing for me. It took a lot of effort but I was able to get that out of my singing. Meri gayaki un dono ki liye hai. I dont know what it is about me, but whenever there are musical greats around I am able to give 200 per cent.

 Dream as drive

 Ujjaini: We have enough talent and with gods blessings we will do what we couldnt the first time round. I know everyone back home in Tollygunge is waiting for me to return and treat them! That will surely happen but I have to be now based in Mumbai as thats what the contract demands. With Aishwarya, I am singing a medley for Madhur Bhandarkars Corporate and I have also recorded an item number for Himesh Reshammiya in the Emraan Hashmi-starrer Dil De Diya.

 Aishwarya: I know that other talent-hunt winners havent been able to make an impression in the world of music. But I feel that what they havent done is keep their wins out of their minds. Its such a big industry that you have to start from scratch despite winning big titles. So I intend to tap my contacts afresh and try and make it big in the music industry.

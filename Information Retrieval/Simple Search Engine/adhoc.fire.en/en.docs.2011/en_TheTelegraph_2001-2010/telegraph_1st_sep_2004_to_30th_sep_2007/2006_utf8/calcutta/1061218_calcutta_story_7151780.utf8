The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Ride rate up, amenities down

 Bus passengers rsquo; forum (II)

 Dhananjay dutta, general secretary of West Bengal Rajya Bus Yatri Samity, met readers of The Telegraph and answered their queries. Participants included Sandip Banerjee, Sushmita Roy, Sandhya Majumdar, Tapan Das, Kajal Ghosh, Ranjan Talukdar, Kalyani Mitra and Swapan Dutta

 Sandip Banerjee: In 2003, while revising the bus fare, the state government had announced that nine per cent of the total rise would be used to improve the amenities for passengers. But it is a well-known fact that the money raised is never used for that purpose. Please tell us what has been done with that particular fund.

Well, you have come forward with an important question. We will include this point in our charter of demands to the state government in January 2007.

 But personally, I feel a good government should be accountable and transparent while handling public funds. Unfortunately, the transport department has done nothing in this regard. Over the past 30 years, the government has revised the bus fare 18 times, promising better services for passengers. 

 But, as you can see, those were false assurances. The ministers and bureaucrats in the transport department are so arrogant that time and again, they have refused to meet the passengers forum. Hence, I cannot tell you about the funds allocation. 

Sushmita Roy: A number of chartered buses are plying regularly from Kalyani to Dharamtala. They follow the route (private bus) 235, which is very crowded. As a result, office-goers have to suffer during the peak hours. We will be grateful if the chartered buses stop at Kaikhali and New Barrackpore. Can you help us?

 It is already on our agenda. But it is quite unfortunate that in the past six months, we could not meet the owners and the authorities concerned. We have written to the association of chartered buses in that area, as well as to transport minister Subhas Chakraborty. But we havent got any feedback till date.

 It was only once that transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury had called us to Writers Buildings. But we could not meet minister Chakraborty as he was busy in a meeting.

Kajal Ghosh: There is a lot of difference in the bus fares in Calcutta and in the districts. A passenger in Calcutta can travel 20 km for just Rs 6.50. But in the districts, we have to cough up more than Rs 10 for the same distance. Why is it so? 

 It is gross injustice for the people in the districts. Just like you, we are in doubt over who is monitoring the public transport service. Is it the state transport department or the bus owners forum. In most cases, bus operators change the actual readings and the bureaucrats accept the figures without any verification. 

 Second, the bus operators have managed to remove the milestones. As a result, the passengers are not aware of the distance they are travelling. We have asked the government to revise the bus fares and rebuild the milestones lining the highways and roads. 

Kalyani Mitra: You are accusing the transport department of a hike in bus fares, but we know that the hike is made keeping in mind the bus owners interests. Can the passengers association deny its responsibility in this respect? Why have you agreed to the governments proposal?

 You are not aware that representatives of the passengers association are not entertained during any of the discussions or while revising the fares. It is a strange situation. The burden of extra fare is imposed on the passengers without even listening to their representatives. Hence, I feel you should not blame us for the hike. 

 We have demanded a permanent committee on fare revision, with a retired justice, an economist and representatives from registered passengers associations, bus owners and bus operators.

Swapan Dutta: Do you think the condition of private buses in West Bengal is better than that in other states like Andhra Pradesh or Gujarat?

 If I say yes then that it would be a false assurance. People from states like Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat, when they visit our city, laugh at the deplorable condition of the private buses. 

 But the conditions here are better than in cities like Patna. In Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, all the seats are front facing and covered with comfortable cushions. In most states, the minimum fare is just Rs 2 and the bus service and frequency are very good.

 Novice drivers equal road mishaps

 Sandhya Majumdar: Rash driving by novice drivers is a major cause of road mishaps across the city and its fringes. What are you doing to check this growing trend?

 According to the state motor vehicle rules, a driver, with less than five years of experience, cannot ply a private bus in the city. The driver should at least have eight to nine years of experience. 

 But the corrupt officials, bureaucrats and bus union leaders do not pay any attention to this aspect. Therefore, you can find young drivers or sometimes, even helpers or conductors in their twenties, driving private buses. Most of these drivers are from Bihar, Orissa, Jharkhand or even down South. We cannot do anything about this trend. Please write to the state transport department for a solution.

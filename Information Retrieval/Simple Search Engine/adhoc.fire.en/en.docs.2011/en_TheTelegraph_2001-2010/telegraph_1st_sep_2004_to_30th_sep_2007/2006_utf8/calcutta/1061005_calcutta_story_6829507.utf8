 Unputdownable: Sonu Nigam

 Sonu Nigam recently collapsed while performing on stage in New Delhi. The reason? A slipped disc! According to sources, Sonu had been ill prior to the show and was on medication but once he got on stage he forgot about all his ailments and started entertaining the crowds in his usual style. But after some time, he began feeling acute pain and was forced to take a break. But the packed show had to go on and Sonu came back out and started singing again.

 As the singer bent down to shake hands with a little admirer he heard a loud crack in his back and collapsed in pain. He had to be removed from the venue on a stretcher but he refused to go to a hospital, as he had to perform in Ludhiana the next day.

 Sonu says: I slept on the floor of my room and the next day we drove eight hours to Ludhiana with me lying down in the back of the vehicle, but the show was great and so it was worth it.

 If that wasnt enough, the singer was back in Mumbai the very next day to perform in Vashi for the Durga puja festivities.

 Feline fall: A moment from the Animal Planets Action Big Cat Week

 Leap into the lives of the stealthiest predators on the planet. In conjunction with World Animal Day, Animal Planet celebrates the big cats of the wild in Action Big Cat Week airing till October 7, showcasing how these magnificent beasts hunt prey, battle threats and develop relationships in some of the most dangerous communities in the world. 

 Taking natural world film-making to another level, an award-winning team employs remote-control buggy cameras, buried periscopes and state-of-the-art night vision technology to enter the lions den in the one-hour programme, Lion Spy In The Den, airing October 6. 

 When a lion charges, the viewers charge with it; when it rests, viewers lie alongside. In what is a new achievement for lion specialists, the show is able to examine the fragile alliances between proud males and their relationships with rivals. 

 Action Big Cat Week also explores the magnificent and mysterious cats of Sri Lanka in Leopard Hunters, airing October 5. Ancient temples and Buddhist dagbas ruins of a lost civilisation remain scattered throughout the wild Yala National Park. The stretches of golden sands along the coast and miles of steamy jungle make the park one of the most beautiful sights on the island. 

 The untouched wilderness is home to herds of elephants, buffaloes, sloth bears, crocodiles, jungle cats and the elusive leopards. It is these magnificent and mysterious cats that have fascinated two young men, Ravi and Jehan. This programme reveals the intimate story of the lives of Sri Lankas top predators as never seen before, including the birth of tiny cubs and fights with sloth bears.

 The show airs at 8 pm and repeats the next day at 3 pm.

 Call it a back-door entry if you want, but Nagesh Kukunoors Dor is back two weeks after it released and one week after it was taken off. The Ayesha Takia-Gul Panag-Shreyas Talpade-starrer had released on September 22 and just after one week, it was taken off the multiplex screens.

 Too many new releases was the official reason as Woh Lamhe, Snakes on a Plane, Krishna and Jai Santoshi Maa jostled for space on Saptami Friday, September 29. Add to this the reigning blockbuster Lage Raho Munnabhai and the 50-day celebrations of Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna.

 Naturally, small film Dor had to suffer and despite great reviews and good occupancy percentages, the film had to be pulled off. Onirs Bas Ek Pal also faced the same music and could only run for one week.

 But now with most of the September 29 releases flopping and just one exciting new release in Zindaggi Rocks, Kukunoors film is back by public demand this Friday at INOX (Forum).

 The other two new releases this Friday are the Keanu Reeves-Sandra Bullock-starrer The Lake House and the Koel Purie film Mera Dil Leke Dekho.

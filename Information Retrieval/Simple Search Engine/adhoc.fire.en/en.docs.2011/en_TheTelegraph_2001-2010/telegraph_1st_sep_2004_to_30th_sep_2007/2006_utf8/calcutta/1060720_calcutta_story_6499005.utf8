The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Civic order under siege

 HERITAGE REVISITED: BBD Bag (Dalhousie Square). A Telegraph picture

 Two city-based advertisement companies ? Display Advertisement and Selvel ? have challenged the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC)?s authority to declare certain city areas heritage zones. BBD Bag (Dalhousie Square) and Esplanade are on the civic body?s list of heritage sites.

 During the hearing on Wednesday of a case relating to displaying advertisements at Metro Railway stations, Ashok Banerjee, counsel for one of the companies, argued that the CMC had no right to issue any order on heritage affairs following the enactment of the West Bengal Heritage Act, 2001.

 By virtue of the act, the state government had constituted a commission to look after heritage affairs. ?Following the enactment, the CMC has no authority to set up a heritage committee on its own. Its order to remove billboards from certain areas is contrary to the law,? Banerjee stated in the court of Justice Jyotirmoy Bhattacharya.

 Opposing the argument, CMC lawyer Aloke Ghosh said: ?If the heritage commission does not object to any decision of the civic authorities on heritage affairs, the petitioners have no right to intervene in the matter.? He also submitted that his client had stopped accepting applications for putting up billboards in the heritage zones.

 The case was moved by the advertising firms after the CMC on June 16 asked them to remove billboards from the Metro Railway stations at Esplanade and Park Street. 

 CMC counsel Ghosh alleged that the companies had not obtained the ?mandatory? permission from the civic body for erecting the billboards.

 ?Both stations fall in the heritage zone, as declared by the CMC?s heritage committee, extending from Lenin Sarani to Park Street,? he submitted.

 The case will be heard again on July 24.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Cars in walk zone

 - Lindsay St parking lot to miss deadline again

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 Two motorable stretches running right through a pedestrian plaza is the highlight of a compromise formula worked out to salvage the Rs 33-crore underground Parkomat in front of New Market, that has been under construction since April 2003. And there is little chance of the latest deadline of December 25 being met for its unveiling.

 The first phase of the joint venture project involving the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) and Simplex was ready in September, but instead of commissioning it, mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya chose to institute a technical expert committee to decide on the feasibility of the demands raised by New Market traders, with the backing of some local CPM leaders.

 I had appointed an expert committee as I wanted a peaceful and unbiased solution to the dispute, said the mayor.

 The three-member expert committee of Prabir Mitra, Nitin Som and Samir Rakshit has set aside the demand for a thoroughfare in front of New Market, but agreed to two motorable roads cutting through the pedestrian plaza right up to two entrances to the market near the Clock Tower. The load-bearing capacity of the plaza does not permit a thoroughfare to be green-signalled, but the 5,000 traders of New Market have refused to allow the Parkomat to open without a thoroughfare.

 The committee submitted its report to municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay on Wednesday. When asked how a passage for cars could be allowed through a pedestrian plaza, an official said the two motorable stretches would be used only in an emergency.

 The traders lobby had also demanded the waterbody be dropped from the Parkomat-plus plan, but the committee has concluded that creation of a five-lakh-gallon-pool of water is essential for fire-fighting.

 The committee has advised that hawkers be removed from the Bertram Street entrance to the parking plaza and that the entry point from the eastern side be made more prominent.

 With space for 281 cars and 15,000 sq ft for shops, the Lindsay Street venture is the first underground hi-tech parking plaza in the country. Political power play and civic soft-pedalling have seen it miss a dozen deadlines from December 2003. It is now eyeing an early 2007 debut.

 The City Diary

 Mithun Mondal, a 13-year-old blind student, was found hanging 

 in a bathroom of his hostel at Blind Boys? Academy, of Ramakrishna 

 Mission Ashrama, Narendrapur, early on Sunday. Assistant 

 warden of the hostel, Swapan Bhuniya, noticed the Class 

 V student hanging around 3.30 am. He immediately informed 

 academy in-charge Swami Sarvavedananda, who contacted Sonarpur 

 police station. Police took Mithun to a local hospital, 

 where he was declared dead.

 Son of a farmer in Murshidabad, Mithun was admitted to 

 the academy in 2003. ?He was an introvert, but well-behaved, 

 and friendly with all his fellow-inmates. He was also good 

 in studies,? said Swami Sarvavedananda. ?We are yet to know 

 what led the boy to end his life. At yesterday?s weekend 

 programme, he behaved normally.?

 S .N. Gupta, superintendent of police, South 24-Parganas, 

 said an unnatural death case has been lodged. ?We will start 

 an inquiry after receiving the post-mortem report.? 

 Two youths were arrested on Sunday on charges of acting as agents of Bhaskar Mukherjee, who had cheated more than 100 persons who had invested in shares through his company Biniyog. Soumen Roy and Nayan Mukherjee were picked up in Barasat, on the northern fringes of the city. Most of Mukherjee?s victims are residents of Barasat. 

 Traffic will be regulated in Salt Lake during Prime Minister Manmohan Singh?s scheduled visit on Tuesday. Singh will arrive in the township at 11 am to lay the foundation stone of Indian Institute of Science and Research. Praveen Kumar, superintendent of police, North 24-Parganas, said parking of vehicles would be restricted in Salt Lake from Monday night till the Prime Minister leaves the venue. 

 Pinky Roy, 16, a resident of Manindra Mitra Road in central Calcutta, has been missing since Friday. Her father, Shib Shankar Roy, has lodged a complaint with Muchipara police station, alleging that a local youth, Mohammed Riyaz, had abducted Pinky. A police team has left for Gorakhpur in search of the girl.

 Low percentage of polling was recorded during the civic byelection in two Calcutta wards, 48 and 123, on Sunday. The wards fell vacant after the death of the Congress and CPM nominees during last year?s polls.

He has identified the alleged extortionists as Azizul Rehaman and Ajay Shaw. According to the complaint, the duo assaulted Jaiswara with a revolver butt. No one has been arrested.

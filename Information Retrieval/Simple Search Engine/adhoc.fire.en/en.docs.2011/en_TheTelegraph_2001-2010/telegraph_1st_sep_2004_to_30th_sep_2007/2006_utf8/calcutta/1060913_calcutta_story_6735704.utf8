 Kasba will get a swimming pool and a childrens park by winter. Samannoy, on BB Chatterjee Road, is carving out the pool from a local waterbody. The park will be set up on its banks.

 There has long been a need for a swimming pool and a childrens park in the area. Due to a combination of factors, especially lack of funds, we could not take up the work. If everything goes according to plan, the projects will be ready by winter, said club general secretary Swapan Chakraborty.

 The waterbody being developed as the swimming pool belonged to the Calcutta Improvement Trust (CIT) and was being used as a dumping ground by local residents. The CIT handed over the waterbody to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC). The CMC asked us to maintain the waterbody as it is near our club. We then thought of turning it into a swimming pool. We will release swans and fishes on a portion of the waterbody, added Chakraborty. 

 According to him, about Rs 2.5 lakh has already been spent on the project. Trinamul Congress leader Mamata Banerjee has sanctioned Rs 3 lakh for the scheme and we have got a letter to that effect from her office. After receiving the funds, we hope to complete the work quickly, the general secretary said.

 Once the swimming pool is ready, the club plans to employ trainers to provide swimming lessons to children between the ages eight and 12. We also want to beautify the park in such a manner that the kids learn while playing there. But more funds will be needed to give the project proper shape, said Chakraborty.

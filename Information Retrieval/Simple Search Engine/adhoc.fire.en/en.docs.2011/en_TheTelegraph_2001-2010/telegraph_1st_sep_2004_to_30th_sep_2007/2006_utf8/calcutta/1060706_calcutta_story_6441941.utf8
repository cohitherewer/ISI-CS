 OUR BUREAU

 Flight services on the Mumbai-Calcutta-Mumbai route were topsy-turvy for the second successive day due to heavy rains in Mumbai. 

 According to officials at Calcutta airport, all flights between the two metros were delayed by around two hours on an average from Wednesday afternoon.

 Jet Airways, Air Sahara, Indian and Air Deccan flights suffered due to the inclement weather. The Mumbai-Calcutta Indian flight left at 9.30 pm instead of its rescheduled departure at 7 pm, an airline spokesperson said.

 Air Sahara?s Mumbai flight, scheduled to leave Calcutta at 4.45 pm, was combined with the one leaving at 7.50 pm. The airline?s Calcutta flight scheduled to arrive at 12:30 pm was late by nearly two hours. Jet Airways flights were also delayed.

 Train services between Mumbai and Calcutta, too, were hit due to the rains. According to South Eastern Railway officials, the Howrah-bound Geetanjali Express had to be rescheduled and left Mumbai five hours late.

 Met officials in Calcutta, meanwhile, reiterated on Wednesday that there was little chance of heavy rains lashing Calcutta and the rest of south Bengal in the next 24 hours.

 ?It will take a few more days before Calcutta gets some heavy showers,? said G.C. Debnath, director of weather section at the Regional Meteorological Centre in Alipore.

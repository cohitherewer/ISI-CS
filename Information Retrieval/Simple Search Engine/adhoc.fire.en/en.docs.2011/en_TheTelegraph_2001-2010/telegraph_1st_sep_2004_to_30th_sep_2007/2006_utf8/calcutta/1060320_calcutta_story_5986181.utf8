 Teachers rage at service bill

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 West Bengal United Minority Forum has organised a rally on Monday to protest the School Service Commission (Amendment) Bill, 2006. The rally will start from St James School at 2 pm and proceed to Rani Rashmoni Road. 

 Teachers of Calcutta?s most-sought-after English-medium schools are poised for a confrontation with the state government over the School Service Commission (Amendment) Bill, 2006.

 The bill, passed in the Assembly on February 20, makes it mandatory for state-aided minority schools to recruit teachers through the West Bengal School Service Commission.

 Teachers of nearly 60 Anglo-Indian schools held an emergency meeting on Saturday and called for an immediate amendment to the bill. They sought incorporation of a clause that will ?clarify in specific terms that teachers of Anglo-Indian schools will be kept out of the bill?s purview.?

 During the passing of the bill, school education minister Kanti Biswas had said in the Assembly that the 60-odd Anglo-Indian schools that receive financial aid from the government for paying a portion of their teachers? salaries would be exempted from meeting the commission clause. 

 ?But after examining the bill, we found that it does not spell out clearly whether schools like ours would be kept out of the purview of the bill or not,? said Ismail Nehal, former teacher of St James School and president, Association of Teachers of Anglo-Indian Schools.

 ?The government must clarify this point and amend the bill accordingly. Else, we will have to draw up a plan for launching a sustained movement,? he asserted.

 Biswas was prompt to dismiss the demand. ?I have clearly said in the House that the Anglo-Indian schools will not come under the purview of the bill,? he stressed. ?It was passed with the objective of making it mandatory for minority schools that receive full assistance from the government to recruit teachers through the commission. We will not amend the bill to incorporate any clause.?

 The Anglo-Indian schools, most of them run by Christian missionaries, receive a substantial amount of state assistance that goes towards meeting the dearness allowance of teachers. The allowance constitutes a major portion of the teachers? salaries.

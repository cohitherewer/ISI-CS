 Divine Dare: Koena Mitra

 She might not have had a hit to her name but Koena Mitra is still riding high on the glam quotient. The actress is this month?s Channel [V] Goddess as she struts her stuff on the popular music channel. 

 In an interview Koena gives to the channel, to be shown on Monday, the actress recounts her childhood days in Calcutta. ?My father always used to dress me up in striped shirts, shorts and sneakers; I was never dressed like a doll, a girl.?

 She also talks about her tinsel town experience, from Ram Gopal Varma choosing her for the Road item number to Rangita Pritish Nandy picking her for Ek Khiladi Ek Haseena.

 The highlight of the tete-a-tete is Koena revealing her fitness secrets. ?Whenever I have time, I go to the gym. I do ab exercises occasionally, but I hate cardio. And in terms of diet, I don?t eat rice and roti every day. I eat it perhaps once a week. I eat a lot of egg whites in the morning, fish and chicken grill,? she says.

 Watch the rest of Koenaspeak, this Monday, 7 pm on Channel [V].

 In its continuing endeavour to ?tell stories?, PIX, 

Sony?s new English movie channel, now introduces the international series Inside 

the Actor?s Studio.This unique talk show has been on air in the US for more 

than 11 years and is now broadcast in over 125 countries.

 ?It has the host James Lipton interviewing famous actors and directors and learning their stories,? reveals Gitanjali Murari, programming head of PIX. ?It is Lipton?s studious research that makes the show a fascinating watch.?

 Since its inception in 1994, Lipton has interviewed ?more than 200 of the world?s most talented and accomplished artistes?. The probing interviews have also raked in countless awards including 11 Emmy nominations and The New York Festival Award for the World?s Best Talk/Entertainment.

 PIX has acquired 47 exciting episodes of this series. Some of the guests interviewed include Will Smith, Antonio Banderas, Hugh Grant, Charlize Theron, Richard Gere, Renee Zellweger, Tom Cruise, Angelina Jolie and Al Pacino.

 The hottest faces of the latest edition of Channel [V] Get Gorgeous have been picked. Anurita Jha from New Delhi and Meenal Thakur from Mumbai have both bagged a one-year contract with the music channel and the international modelling agency Matrix Model Management.

 After eight weeks of nerve-wracking build-up, the jury members ? Dino Morea, Surily Goel and Marc Robinson ? took the crucial call. ?It?s not just another competition for me. It?s about having beaten all odds,? gushed an overjoyed Anurita.

 For Meenal, this was a whole new world. ?I had no exposure to the fashion industry and I was really apprehensive at the beginning,? she recalled. ?Get Gorgeous has been a turning point and has changed my life completely.?

 Marc summed it up: ?Anurita had the attitude and the oomph essential for any successful model. As for Meenal, she has the ideal body for ramp modeling.?

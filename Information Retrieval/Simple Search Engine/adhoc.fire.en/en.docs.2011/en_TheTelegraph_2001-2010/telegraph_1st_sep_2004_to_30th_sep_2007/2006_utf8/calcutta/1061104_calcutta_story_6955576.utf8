 Epic at its folksy best

 Virasat 2006, the annual cultural 

 festival organised by Spicmacay (Society for the Promotion 

 of Society and Culture Among Youth), is being held from 

 October 30 to December 15. Like every year, the festival 

 has a cultural treat in store for young enthusiasts.

 One of the numerous events of Virasat took place on October 31 at our school. The students of classes XI and XII had the honour of enjoying a magnificent performance by Padmabhushan Teejan Bai. The students, teachers and Spicmacay volunteers gave a hearty welcome to the renowned artiste and her group.

 Teejan Bai is famous for her enacting of the Pandavana, an episode from the epic Mahabharata, in a grand style, weaving in music, dialogues and general conversation.

 At our school, she lighted the ceremonial lamp before beginning her performance. On stage, she appeared in the familiar colourful sari, heavy silver bangles and trinkets, and neatly oiled and braided hair. A stringed instrument decorated with peacock feathers completed the look.

 She decided to enact the scene Draupadi Swayamvara from the Mahabharata. She narrated the hardships Pandavas faced to reach Draupadis swayamvara. Her passion for the art form showed in her presentation and soon the audience, too, was mesmerised by her powerful voice, expressions and body movements. 

 Occasionally, the other musicians joined in in a chorus, which made it even more interesting. The use of Chattisgarhi colloquial language gave the recital a rustic feel. 

 Although the story of Draupadi swayamvara is familiar to most of us, her inimitable style of delivery made the audience relish the experience as much as she did while performing it.

 lVirasat was inaugurated at Eastern Zonal Cultural Centre, Salt Lake, on October 30. Besides performances by Teejan Bai, the practitioner of the Pandavani folk art, the festival will include performances by Manipuri danseuse Preeti Patel, Malabika Mitra and troupes of Yakshagana in schools and institutes across the city.

 Sambalpuri dance, animal-masked dance, puppet theatre, scroll painting workshop, sessions with the Bihar School of Yoga and many other programmes are also on the cards. Jadavpur University professor Ananda Lal will deliver a talk at Apeejay School on November 18. The festival rounds off with the screening of Satyajit Rays Ghare Baire.

 Speed kid

 Calcutta boy Karan Goenka is off to Portugal to represent India at the World Finals of the Junior Rotax Karting Championship.

 Before leaving for Bangalore on November 2, the Goenka family organised an evening of celebration for the speed kids achievements.

 Present were Rajat Kumar Majumdar, president, Federation Motor Sport Club of India, Karans uncle and rallyist Vijay Goenka and Mukta Nain and principal of Birla High school, where Karan studied before shifting to Sarala Birla High School in Bangalore. Footballer Bhaichung Bhutia dropped by to boost Karans spirits and wish him luck. India is still not developed when it comes to sports, so all young sportspersons need the encouragement of their family and friends, said Bhaichung.

 Karting has been Karans passion ever since he sat at the wheel of a go-kart at Clown Town four years ago. The current national Junior Rotax Karting Champion is itching to hit the international tracks. I am not setting my sights too far as the tracks will be new and there will be other national champions too, but I will give it my best shot, he smiled.

 Majumdar revealed that talks are on for a karting championship in Calcutta. Talks are on about a karting championship on Red Road. A decision will be taken by January next year, he said.

 Foxed by the dog

 Only Connect

 Abhijit Gupta

 This weeks offering could also be christened: The 

 Curious Incident of the Lazy Dog. One remembers Sherlock 

 Holmes drawing Watsons attention to the curious incident 

 of the dog at night, in The Silver Blaze. When Watson remarked 

 that the dog did nothing, Holmes said that was the curious 

 incident. In a similar vein I ask, why does the dog do nothing 

 when the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog? 

 No marks for guessing what I am talking about: probably 

 the most typed or keyed-in sentence of all time, used as 

 an exercise as it contains all the letters in the alphabet, 

 or in other words, is a pangram. Originally developed by 

 the Western Union to test Telex/TWX data in the dim and 

 distant past, it has proved to be remarkably durable even 

 in the age of machine-readable texts. Nowadays it is often 

 used as a sample text for different fonts but is still perfectly 

 serviceable as a keying-in exercise. Just try doing it once 

 without looking at the keyboard: the wuicxh brownh fow junmps 

 over the laxy doigI am obviously not very good at 

 this.

 But that is not the point of this column. The point is 

 the lazy dog who does nothing, absolutely nothing, even 

 when attacked by the fox. For, in the Portuguese language, 

 the brown fox is not merely content with jumping over the 

 lazy dog but attacks it: a r aacute;pida raposa marrom ataca 

 o c atilde;o pregui ccedil;oso the quick brown fox 

 attacks the lazy dog. The average Romanian typist, on the 

 other hand, is a more peace-loving individual and is content 

 with the jumping fox: agera vulpe maronie sare peste c acirc;inele 

 cel lenes.

 But no one, not one language in the world, has stood up 

 for the dog. Believing in letting sleeping dogs lie, they 

 have conspired to perpetrate a shameful stereotype, one 

 from which even the fabulist Aesop would have recoiled. 

 The brave, energetic and faithful dog has been portrayed 

 as lazy, dim-witted and completely oblivious to the dangers 

 of a fierce fox in its vicinity. This flies in the face 

 of all available evidence. The time has come to give the 

 dog its due. This can easily be done by a simple role reversal, 

 i.e. by making the dog the jumper and the fox the jumpee: 

 the quick brown dog jumps over the lazy fox. Simple. 

 For those who would rather not tamper with a three-century 

 old sentence, there are other, lesser-known pangrams to 

 choose from. Unfortunately, most of them are laboured and 

 contrived, such as Jackdaws love my big sphinx of 

 quartz preferred by Windows XP. Pack my bags 

 with five dozen liquor jugs is marginally better, 

 as is Heavy boxes perform quick waltzes and jigs. 

 For even more implausible pangrams, look at www.rinkworks.com/words/pangrams. 

 Happy typing.

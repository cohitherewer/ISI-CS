A group of 16 teachers from various 

 institutions in the US started their three-day tour of the 

 city with a visit to the Indian Institute of Cerebral Palsy 

 (IICP).

 They spent their first morning in the city learning about the institutes work in schooling, counselling and therapy. The tour was arranged by the United States Educational Foundation in India, with the Americans travelling to India under the Fulbright-Hays Seminars Abroad programme. The teachers were introduced to the students and staff of the institute, from pre-school toddlers to older students taking vocational courses.

 For many teachers in the group, the trip to India was a first, as Robert McHugh, a high school history teacher from Millbrook, New York, confirmed. This is the first time Ive been to a developing country, so there has been a lot to take in. Im looking forward to taking a look around the city. Joyce Millman, an art teacher from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, added: Im especially interested in the use of textiles in the art classes here. I hope to take back some new techniques for my classes in the States.

 The tour culminated with a presentation by Ankur, a Calcutta-based advocacy group, which campaigns for the rights of people suffering from cerebral palsy. The visit was rounded off with biscuits and cakes baked by members of the institute. The guests gifted several books to the institute. The next port of call for the visitors was St Johns Diocesan Girls High School.

 Founders day

 St Thomas Day School celebrated its 62nd founders day on July 26 with a special prayer service at the St Pauls Cathedral. A host of dignitaries, students, parents and teachers of the school were present. The service began with the processional hymn, followed by readings from The Bible. The school choir Incarnith presented many hymns. Mellifluous renditions by the junior school choir (nursery and KG students) were much appreciated. The Bishop in his speech called for todays youth to be more compassionate towards the poor. The service was then closed by singing the school hymn and the national anthem.

 Famous fibber

 This week, Only Connect pays tribute 

 to George Psalmanazar (1679-1763), one of the outstanding 

 liars of all time and creator of a virtual persona so successful 

 that three centuries of research has failed to uncover his 

 real name.

 Enlightenment Europe crawled with 

 charlatans and con men, but none as notorious as Psalmanazar 

 who burst upon London society in 1703, in the identity of 

 a native Japanese Christian. In reality, he might have been 

 born to Catholic parents in France in 1680s but this has 

 never been conclusively proven. He arrived in London in 

 the company of a Scottish chaplain, who claimed that he 

 had converted this heathen and christened him George Psalmanazar, 

 after the Biblical Assyrian king Shalmaneser.

 Not satisfied with this rather 

 tame imposture, Psalmanazar soon revealed the full scope 

 of his mendacity. He claimed to be a native of Formosa (modern 

 Taiwan) who lived on raw flesh, roots and herbs. He gabbled 

 volubly in an invented Formosan and even presented catechism 

 in it to the Bishop of London. In 1704, he published An 

 Historical and Geographical Description of Formosa, an Island 

 subject to the Emperor of Japan, which was so convincing 

 that he was invited to teach Formosan in Oxford.

 George Psalmanazar

 Psalmanazar laboured hard to make 

 his imposture credible. He publicly ate raw flesh 

 though heavily spiced and slept in a chair with a 

 lamp burning, which he claimed was common practice in Formosa. 

 The chattering classes in London were completely bowled 

 over. Samuel Johnson practically sat at his feet and declared 

 that hed rather disbelieve a Bishop than doubt Psalmanazar.

 Psalmanazars description 

 of Formosa was a farrago of such nonsense that one wonders 

 how so many people fell for it. He stated that Formosan 

 men wore gold or silver codpieces and ate their wives for 

 infidelity. The staple diet was a serpent hunted with branches 

 while the hearts of 18,000 young men were sacrificed yearly 

 to various deities.

 Not everyone believed Psalmanazars 

 fables. He was challenged by astronomer-royal Edmund Halley 

 while speaking at the Royal Society. This had no effect 

 whatsoever on his reputation and he continued to be lionised 

 by the beau monde. Eventually he called his own bluff and 

 confessed, first to his friends and then to the public. 

 The rest of Psalmanazars 

 life was spent in miscellaneous literary activities, including 

 a real history of Formosa. But one secret he never let on: 

 the true identity of the man who challenged our notions 

 of the virtual and the real. Three centuries later, the 

 mystery still abides.

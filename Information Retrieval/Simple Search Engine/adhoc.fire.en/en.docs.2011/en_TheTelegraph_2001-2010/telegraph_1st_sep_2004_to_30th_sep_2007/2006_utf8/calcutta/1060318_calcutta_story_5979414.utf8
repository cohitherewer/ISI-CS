 Suicide over TV chide

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Scolded by his mother for watching television and neglecting his studies, 12-year-old Bapi Mondal committed suicide by consuming insecticide in a Tollygunge slum on Thursday afternoon. 

 He was taken to Sambhunath Pandit Hospital, where he died in the evening.

 Around 11.30 am on Thursday, Bapi?s mother Shila told her son to study and left for Kalighat market to buy vegetables. When she returned 45 minutes later, Bapi was still watching television. 

 Angered, she scolded him for wasting his time. Bapi was to sit for his annual examination in a south Calcutta school from March 20.

 An officer of Tollygunge police station said Bapi, unable to bear the humiliation, went into a room and consumed insecticide his mother had brought a couple of days earlier to use as a mosquito repellent. ?The post-mortem report confirms that the boy had consumed a large quantity of pesticide,? said the official. 

 Shila, who is yet to recover from the shock, told the police, that she had lost her cool after seeing her son watch television. She switched off the set and rebuked him. 

 ?He started weeping and I went to a neighbour?s. I returned around 1 pm and found him lying unconscious on the floor, with froth coming out of his mouth,? she said.

 Neighbours rushed in as she raised an alarm and took Bapi to hospital. 

 Bapi?s father, Basu, a decorator by profession, was not home when the tragedy took place.

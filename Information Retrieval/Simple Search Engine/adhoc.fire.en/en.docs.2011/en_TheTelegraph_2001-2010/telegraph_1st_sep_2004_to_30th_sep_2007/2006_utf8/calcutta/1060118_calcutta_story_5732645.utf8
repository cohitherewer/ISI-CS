 Suit to fill HC posts 

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Dismayed over the indifferent attitude over filling the vacant posts of judges in Calcutta High Court, the Bar Association resolved on Tuesday to move a case in the Supreme Court seeking its intervention in the matter.

 ?This is the first time that members of a high court Bar will move the apex court under Article 32 of the Constitution,? claimed L.C. Behani, president of the association.

 The attitude of both the Centre and the judicial administration has prompted his association to knock the door of the Supreme Court, he added.

 ?It is a terrible situation. The court is running with only 30 judges. Twenty posts of judges are lying vacant for years. Repeated appeals and threats to launch a movement have not had any effect on the authorities,? Behani alleged.

 About a month ago, a delegation from the association had met Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurkar of the high court and sought his intervention in the matter. The delegation informed the chief justice that the lawyers have been pressuring the association to take a drastic step against the judicial administration.

 ?The chief justice had sought a month?s time and assured the delegation that he would take all possible steps to meet the demand. But more than a month has passed, and nothing has been done yet,? a member of the delegation stated on Tuesday.

 According to former secretary and senior member of the Bar Uttam Majumdar, the members had shown great patience. ?A Supreme Court ruling in 2003 had banned declaration of ceasework by lawyers. But how long can we wait for a legitimate demand to be addressed?? he asked.

 The Supreme Court also plays an important role in appointing high court judges. So, the Bar Association will have to make the apex court a respondent in the proposed case.

 High court sources said the chief justice has already started the process of judge recruitment.

 Platform for gadgets from grassroots

 In an attempt to look beyond tomorrow in our own backyard, Discovery Channel has joined hands with the National Innovation Foundation (NIF) to bring into focus India?s untapped talent. A show on technologies of the future, that has started being aired on the channel from Monday, brings Indian grassroots innovations on the same platform as foreign gizmos.

 Thus for every episode on a carver (a cross between car and scooter) or a hand-held translator or a smart home that takes voice commands, there is an Indian answer in a tree-climber or a pedal-operated washing machine or a scooter for the challenged.

 Many of these unknown talents from the east who have received national awards were present at a meet in the city along with their inventions. Kanak Das, a 30-year-old from a farming family in Assam, brought his cycle up the bumpy roads of his native district of Morigaon. ?Kanak has managed to transmit vertical energy into horizontal energy in the form of propulsion in the rear wheel. As that supplements pedalling action, the cycle moves faster when it hits a bump,? explained Professor Anil Gupta, executive vice-chairman of NIF.

 Dulal Choudhury of Guwahati is ready to shelter people from ultraviolet radiation. His umbrella has muga silk fabric, a local product, which, according to a study at his behest by the University of Tezpur, absorbs up to 80 per cent of the rays. ?I have made changes in spinning and weaving technology to make the fabric softer,? he said.

 A friend?s need to increase incense stick production made Usman Shekhani of Chhattisgarh devise a stick-maker. The electronic goods repairer works with a slicer and cutter, costing a mere Rs 450, that produces more uniform sticks from bamboo poles than a Rs 45,000 machine does. Next to him, Uddhav Bharati of Assam was demonstrating his pomegranate-peeling machine. A sexagenarian honey-seller from Bihar could not come to exhibit his amphibious bicycle. But Saidullah?s story inspires equal awe. ?He was waiting for other passengers to fill the boat. Once across the river, he would have to travel again on land. To save time, he fitted a bicycle with four buoys which support it in water and can be folded when it is back on land,? Gupta said.

 Prof Bikash Sinha of Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics was all praise for the ?ingenuity that is part of Indian innovations?. ?They are cheap and bring a very Indian approach to Indian needs.?

 Yet, as the market place recognises only efficiency and cost-effectiveness, the need of the hour is to marry formal science with untrained brainwork, said Prof Gupta. NIF has received orders for many of these innovations from Pakistan, Singapore, US... ?The tree-climber made in rural Kerala has found buyers in Miami. The Americans can send man to the moon but not to the top of a tree. This is the niche in technology we can fill.?

 A clarion call also went out to innovators in Bengal from where NIF gets few entries. ?We have a micro-venture single-signature, no-collateral fund which we can use to push off-beat research.? Are there any takers?

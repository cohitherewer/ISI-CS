The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Carriers eye comeback

 OUR BUREAU

 German carrier Lufthansa is set to land again in Calcutta, after more than three decades, and KLM Dutch Airlines is keen to bring the city back on its radar.

 A Lufthansa spokesperson told Metro over the phone from Delhi: ?There are definite plans (to launch operations from the city).? 

 Sources said the airline will start operations on the Calcutta-Frankfurt route in December and a KLM delegation will touch down next week to conduct a market survey on its proposed resumption of services.

 On the back of the two high-fliers announcing their comeback schedule, Nepal?s Yeti Airlines, along with the Pailan Group, has submitted a proposal to the state government on introducing short-distance flights from Behala Flying Club.

 Transport minister Subhas Chakraborty on Thursday discussed the proposal with officials of the two companies.

 The companies, which want to take over the flying club jointly, plan to operate flights with a 30-seater aircraft to Haldia, Digha, Malda, Balurghat, Cooch Behar, Bagdogra and Jamshedpur, and maybe even Gaya, Lucknow and Port Blair.

 Lufthansa, meanwhile, has written to the airport authorities, stating its requirement for starting operations.

 ?They have sought space for an office, counters and parking bay. According to the plans, they will start operations between Calcutta and Frankfurt,? an airport official confirmed.

 ?Lufthansa is coming to Calcutta and we have the capacity to handle the additional aircraft,? said airport director V.K. Monga.

 The airline, which had wound up its city operations in the 1970s, now operates only cargo flights to Calcutta.

 The KLM team, sources said, is scheduled to hold talks with the Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the state industrial development corporation. The airline first withdrew from the city in 2002. It returned in 2003, only to fly out again the next year.

 Teen trio of girls rescued

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Kajali Chauhan, Puja Roy and Sumi Das all in their teens left home in Murshidabad to live a life they had often dreamt of in Calcutta.

 They reached the city all right on Monday afternoon, but unable to locate their cherished way to success, they landed up at Muchipara police station.

 Choking on tears, the girls narrated their story to the officers, who gave them food and arranged for their overnight stay in the custody of an NGO.

 On Tuesday, all three will be sent back to their parents.

 It all started on Saturday night, when Kajalis father rebuked the 14-year-old for making an unjust demand for money. A tea-seller in Kantanagar, Behrampore, the father scolded Kajali: Why dont you try doing something on your own?

 Early next morning, Kajali called two of her close friends Puja and Sumi and they decided to leave for Calcutta, where they were certain they would land some plum jobs, said an officer of Muchipara police station.

 The three gathered some clothes and Puja collected around Rs 300. On Sunday night, they boarded a Calcutta-bound bus from Behrampore.

 The girls got off the bus at Sealdah in the afternoon and strayed towards NRS Medical College and Hospital. As they could not figure out which way to go, they sought the help of a constable.

 The constable heard their story and decided to bring the girls to the police station for detailed interrogation. At the thana, it took some time to pacify the girls and bring out the truth. Their parents were informed right away, the officer said.

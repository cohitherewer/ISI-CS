Where: The Calcutta Swimming Club lawns.

 When: Sunday afternoon.

Sip n bite: With an exotic selection 

from American, Mediterranean, Indian and Japanese cuisine, the menu had something 

for everyone. 

 Fast-food fillers like burgers and jacket potatoes blended beautifully with Wild Rice and Kibbeh ? a popular Mediterranean pick.

 Some guests sampled Japanese Yakitori while the rest enjoyed the tried and tested dishes from the Tandoor. 

 The dessert section saw favourites like Gur Rossogola, Crepe Suzette and a gateau selection.

 A bar was constantly busy and while most guests predictably sipped on an endless supply of Fosters, some raised glasses of vibrant cocktails concocted by the bartender. 

 The style statement: Sunday casuals, cool and classy. Pretty pastels for the women, with their sunglasses right in place. The menfolk stuck mostly to sporty jackets and loafers.

 The guest list: Mostly members of the Young Entrepreneurs Organisation, tea biggies, some close friends and family, this close-knit affair also saw some top cops mingling freely with the guests. 

 Voiceover: It carried on at a leisurely pace almost till 4 pm and turned out to be a very relaxed and casual brunch. Quite a change from the usual, smoke-filled late night clubbing affair, smiled Ravi Todi.

Remix night

 What: Bollywood remixed and ZeeBra cheerleaders.

 Where: Tantra.

 When: Saturday night.

 The show: It was one of those rare nights where music and maidens became the recipe for a rocking party. DJ Kiran from Mumbai took control of the console before midnight with the ZeeBra cheerleaders setting the bar top ? and not the soccer pitch ? on fire.

 The DJ churned out tracks like Right Here Right Now, Dus bahane, Kajra re and not to forget Tere liye, his original remix from Veer-Zaara that is currently topping the console charts.

 If the DJ kept the feet busy, the eight cheerleaders kept the eyeballs busy. 

 Voiceover: The Bollywood remixes of DJ Kiran are very popular with the party crowd. Whenever he is playing here, we have a full house. Today, we also have the ZeeBra cheerleaders in the house so its killing two birds with one stone for party hoppers, said a spokesperson for Tantra.

Samba sway

 What: Flavours of Samba.

 Where: Big Ben at The Kenilworth.

 When: Saturday night, 10.30 pm onwards.

 The show: The music band from Brazil Mandu Sarara was in performance to ensure that you put on your best dancing shoes for some Samba.

 The five-member band that has travelled around the globe treated party lovers of the city to a unique style of Samba based on rhythms ranging from frevo, bias and aracatu to choro, samba and bossanova. There were interesting improvisations and harmony to create an all new urban style of song and dance. And Britain met Brazil as Big Ben swayed to the sound of Samba.

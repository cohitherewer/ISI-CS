The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Staying alive, in pain

 ANUPAM KHER takes Pratim D. Gupta through some of the highs and lows of a journey that began exactly 22 years ago with Saraansh

 It hasn?t been a happy morning 

 for Anupam Kher (picture by Aranya Sen). On his flight from 

 Mumbai to Calcutta, he chanced upon a film tabloid and found 

 some chhota-mota production company making a film 

 with the title Hindu. 

 ?That?s the name of my next production ? Hindu: The Outsider,? he tells Metro. ?After Maine Gandhi Ko Nahin Maara, I am planning this film about a Kashmiri refugee living in Jammu who decides to go back to Srinagar. The script has been developed by Ashok Pandit, Raman Kumar and me. Since it is very close to my heart and because of my association with the Kashmir migrants, I will play the main protagonist. Pandit will direct the film.?

 After a quick call to Pandit stressing the fact ?we did register the title?, Kher talks about the book that has brought him to Calcutta. ?I was recommended by a lot of people who matter to me to attend the reading session of Kiran Nagarkar?s God?s Little Soldier,? he says.

 The other metros have seen the likes of Aamir Khan, Naseeruddin Shah and Girish Karnad reading out from the book. ?I will be honest enough to say that I haven?t yet read the full book but whatever little I have, I felt that the author has got a very original style of writing. It?s important to endorse your name or faith to such projects.?

 Having once been an avid reader, Kher confesses that his reading habits are no more that prolific. ?I have given around 9,000 books to my acting school,? he reveals. ?My focus has been my school, An Actor Prepares, which is not my business but my passion for acting. It?s a school where admissions are not taken on the basis of whose sons and daughters they are. They will get work anyway. The students should have the same profile as I had 30 years back ? stars in the eyes and a hunger to learn.?

 With Shabana Azmi, Mahesh Bhatt and Boman Irani as guest lecturers, Kher is happy with the way his school has been shaping up. ?Some of them have already started getting work,? he says excitedly. ?They have been taught to do all kinds of roles, from small ones to lead roles. The school is not my money-earning device or my source of income. It should of course be self-sufficient, earn enough money to run the school comfortably.?

 Hindu being his next project as producer, Kher is also looking at direction again. Four years after the debacle named Om Jai Jagadish, he is ready to don the director?s hat again on his bald plate.

 ?It will be a romantic comedy with mainstream stars,? he declares. ?I am happy that it is original and that?s why it is taking so much time to script? since there is no source material. It should start by the end of the year.?

 Acting assignments continue to punctuate Kher?s career, which now encompasses different roles like producer, director and educationist. He rattles off the list, almost mechanically: ?My next release will be Priyadarshan?s Chup Chup Ke. There?s Khosla Ka Ghosla which has been ready for quite some time now. I am also doing Sooraj Barjatya?s Vivah and Dharmesh Darshan?s Aap Ki Khatir. Then there?s Shirish Kunder?s Jaaneman where I play a dwarf for the first time. And let me tell you, being on one?s knees is really painful. Then again, to be alive as an actor, you have to do things which are painful.?

 Settling into a philosophical state of being, Kher starts counting the films he has done till date. ?It?s been 312 films? in what 21 years. Hang on, it?s almost 22 years. What date is it today? May 17? Don?t tell me? It?s exactly 22 years today. Saraansh released on May 17 in 1984!?

 As he slipped into solitude, Anupam Kher certainly looked happier than he was a at the start of the chat. For an artiste, there?s nothing like a trip down movie memory lane.

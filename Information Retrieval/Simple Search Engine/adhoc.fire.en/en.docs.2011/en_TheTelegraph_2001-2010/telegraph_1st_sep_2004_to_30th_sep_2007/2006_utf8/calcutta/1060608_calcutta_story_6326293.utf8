The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 The league 

 of extraordinary men

 Forget Gotham City and Metropolis, 

 superheroes are now making a beeline for Hollywood. Green 

 skinned rageaholics, crippled mutants or lovesick webslingers, 

 there is space for all in tinsel town. They may wear their 

 inner wear as outside wear, but these superheroes on celluloid 

 sure mean box-office gold.

 Yes, there have been some films 

 that have been greeted with howls of derision (Barb Wire, 

 Judge Dredd, The Fantastic Four and Catwoman 

 immediately spring to mind), but most have tasted commercial 

 success and some have even earned critical acclaim.

 The immensely successful X-Men 

 series and Spiderman franchise have raked in over 

 $2 billion at the box office, a figure that?s more than 

 the GDP of 51 African countries!

 ?You cannot dumb down a comic 

 book. One has to stay true to the spirit of the story, maybe 

 not necessarily to the minute details. The popularity of 

 comic books stems from the fact that they act as security 

 blankets when one is a child, and you get that same feeling 

 of comfort when you watch it on the big screen,? pointed 

 out Stan Lee, the creator of Spiderman, X-Men 

 and The Incredible Hulk.

 The popularity of comic book superheroes 

 gone celluloid may stem from the fact that they represent 

 modern day society?s cultural mythology. Add to the fact 

 that comics are perfect for screen adaptation, being full 

 of spectacle and adventure with an emotional arc for the 

 hero.

 Sam Raimi?s Spider-Man 1 

 and 2 had Peter Parker (played by Tobey Maguire) 

 with endearing human characteristics, while the Batman 

 movies had alter ego Bruce Wayne questioning his abilities 

 and fighting his inner demons.

 Hollywood has more often than 

 not successfully managed to portray the ?human? side of 

 the superheroes and capture their vulnerabilities, while 

 not missing out on their crime-fighting exploits. No longer 

 is it simply about the mask; it?s also very much about the 

 man behind the mask. 

 As Christian Bale, star of 2005?s 

 Batman Returns said: ?Batman is Travis Bickle with 

 billions in the bank.?

 Today, the process of movie making 

 has gone into territories where it?s practically impossible 

 to tell where cinematography ends and the blue screen begins. 

 Special effects have revolutionised the art of movie making 

 and proved to be a boon for the action adventure genre.

 Spidey?s web slinging all over 

 New York, Wolverine sinking his metal claws into Mystique, 

 and Batman using his gadgets to get out of trouble seem 

 more plausible than ridiculous thanks to F/X.

 Country cousin Bollywood, too, 

 has jumped onto the superhero bandwagon, with film-maker 

 Rakesh Roshan about to release his magnum opus, Krrish, 

 starring son Hrithik Roshan.

 The film, sequel to the 2003 super 

 hit Koi? Mil Gaya, has been made on a budget of Rs 

 50 crore, and promises special effects that haven?t been 

 witnessed by Indian audiences, whose only exposure to ?superhero? 

 films has been the ilk of the cringe-worthy Ajooba. 

 But then, Bollywood has more superheroes 

 than heroes filling up the screen ? they jump like Superman, 

 cast a web like Spiderman, zip around like Batman, fight 

 like The Hulk and love like Don Juan?

 Wonder what the likes of Roshan 

 or Subi Samuel (who has produced the other superhero movie 

 of the season Alag) would churn out if they had Hollywood 

 budgets.

 The budgets in the West are bolstered 

 by ancillary profits through television, video and merchandising 

 making this genre even more effective and attractive to 

 studios and producers. 

 Most movies today recover almost 

 their entire production costs through such avenues. Do some 

 smart and aggressive marketing and Spiderman becomes as 

 wealthy as a small European country!

 Superhero films are here to stay. 

 Films such as X-Men 3 have grossed close to $250 

 million on their opening weekends. The world now waits for 

 Superman Returns, the fourth installment of the caped 

 wonder?s adventures.

 Starring a relatively unknown 

 Brandon Routh, the film is not just about ?truth, justice 

 and the American way?; it rather examines the fact that 

 the world has changed and the need of a superhero has become 

 somewhat diluted.

 Directed by X-Men and X-2 

 director Bryan Singer, the movie is one the most anticipated 

 ones of the year.

 We have always adored our superheroes, 

 those larger-than-life figures who rescue the weak, preserve 

 the species, and fight evil in all its forms. And as long 

 as there?s money to be made, superheroes will continue to 

 rule our screens.

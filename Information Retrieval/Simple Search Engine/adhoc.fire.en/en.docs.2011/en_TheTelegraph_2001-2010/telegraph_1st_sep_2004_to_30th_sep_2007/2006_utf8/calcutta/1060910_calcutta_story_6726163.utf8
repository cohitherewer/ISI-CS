 9 Reasons to return to New Market

Much has been said about the long-pending Parkomat, the power cuts, the waterlogging, the encroachment of hawkers... But for so many, New Market remains New Market. A place to pick up a few things you cant or dont want to go anywhere else for. A place where the familiar face behind the counter and the natural warmth in the greeting make the tedious trip well worth it.

 Heres revisiting New Market for all the nice things one still gets at this 132-year-old landmark set up by Sir Stuart Hogg in an advanced state of decay.

 Silver splendour

 Chamba Lama, Khattrys Gift Palace, Heritage or Curio Cottage if its silver, it still better be from New Market. Some of us dont even know the name of our favourite silver stop here, but then we really dont need to. Not when every little lane and bylane that leads to the 10-odd silver shops is so well mapped in memory.

 The big question crops up once you enter the silver corridor: what not to buy? Tibetan trinkets, sterling silver stunners, little charms, exquisite earrings, neckpieces, bracelets, nose-pins, anklets, bangles, pendants

 Our list of loyalists remains intact and thats because of the prices, variety and quality we offer, smiles a spokesperson for Chamba Lama, into its 49th year at New Market now.

 Nahoums niceties

 The aroma and the array as you walk past F-20 force you to go the Oscar Wilde way (The only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it).

 The cheese puffs and cheese straws, jam tarts and cakes (fruit, plum, Madeira or plain), brownies and fudge the sweets and savouries that nestle in Nahoums remain timelessly tasty.

 Everything from the recipes to the Italian ceiling remains the same. And that is the speciality, says David Nahoum, carrying the familys pride well into the third generation. We have been here since 1902 and will never move out, declares David.

 And no ones complaining!

 Fabric focus

 Plain poplin at Rs 25 per metre to beautiful brocade at Rs 500 every kind of fabric (natural or synthetic) is available here in pretty patterns, smart solids, fancy weaves, khadi prints and more. From older favourites like Geetas Circle and Asha to newer ones like Menka and Meenakshi, every kind of fabric to stitch a grooms sherwani to a grandchilds school uniform can be found here.

 New Market has never disappointed me in so many years. A rare Japanese polynosic or a tanchoi, New Market has it all, says designer Sunipa Samadder, a die-hard fabric fan of the Lindsay Street shopping address.

 Garden path

 New Market is a one-stop shop for green thumbs. Neem oil, exotic manure, flowering bulbs, vegetable sheets, exotic hybrid sheets, gardening tools and equipment, vases and pots Globe Nursery is the place to head for. Whats more, the shop has books on the subject and is all too willing to guide beginners.

 Globe Nursery has everything a beginner could need in the garden, says Sonali Roy Chowdhury, a landscape artist. 

 Floral fusion

 The brightest section of New Market is the fragrant FR row. From its rose and rajnigandha days, the flower range now flaunts Oriental lilies, birds of paradise, gerberas, orchids and more. Some shops like AC Bose offer to deliver anywhere in India.

 Fresh flower bouquets and bunches apart, the range also boasts seven-eight dry flower shops and one artificial flower shop. The dry flower section employs each part of the plant flower, stem, shoot, root and fruit to create amazing artefacts.

 Pet passion

 Corona, set up in 1945, has been the capital of pet products for generations. Nothing has changed even today, says Uday Krishna Basu Roy, partner.

 And why should it? Chewing sticks, games, balls, leashes, collars, fancy jackets, medicine, de-tangle conditioners, feeding bowls and various food items NB 5 and 5/1 is where your dog will surely go woof and wag.

 New Hindustan and Olympic also stock some pet picks. Dogs and cats apart, New Market is home to a host of pet-related products fish feed, aquarium accents, bird seeds

 Fish n pork

 Hilton Towers and Grand Hyatt Regency in Mumbai, Park Streets Mocambo and our kitchens the common factor is only fish, courtesy New Market. Leading the way is Dulals seven-stall hub (where S.K. Ojha is the celebrity fish fillet man), but the rest of the fish family is not too far behind.

 Ditto for the piggery products. Sausages, salami, bacon and ham New Market remains the hub of it all. 

 Christmas cheer

 Xmas aint no Xmas without buying some cheer from New Market. The gorgeous green trees (any size, height or type) and all the accompanying paraphernalia (shiny balls, angels, shimmer, bells, dolls and candles), candies, Santa Claus dolls, cakes, music, lights, crackers For the sheer range of Christmas budget buys, life comes full circle every winter at the merry roundabout of New Market so what if the cannon has limped away! 

 Miscellaneous mix

 Also in New Market: Bipin Behary Dass, one of the oldest shops in New Market that started off with imported goods, went on to be a one-stop lingerie shop with Tollywood stars as loyalists. The Royal Stores remains a rare place that can manage the fancy MAC make-up range for you lip-stains, gel eyeliners, fashion pigments and whatever else you want. Then there are the suitcases, fashion bags, laces, trimmings, fashion wigs, sewing stuff, shower curtains, bath mats, crockery, clips, plastic goodies, Chinese shoes, knick-knacks from Thailand

 No one keeps em all like New Market does, even now.

 School denies Hrithik do purge

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Chowdhury Dasgupta: CID probe welcome

 A school has denied that it expelled two students for posing as thalassaemia patients for an NGO at a Hrithik Roshan event.

 Yatindra Kumar Singh, headmaster of Vivekananda Hindi Vidyalaya, in Garia, said on Thursday that Shabnam Parveen, 13, and Mohammad Sajeed (Vicky), 9, were not expelled from school after they attended the Hrithik event in the city for thalassaemic children on June 27, 2003.

 Singh added that he had issued a certificate after the event on their fathers request, saying the children needed treatment for thalassaemia.

 Calcutta High Court on Wednesday ordered the CID to probe the role of NGO Smile Earth Foundation in organising the event for thalassaemic children.

 Shahjada Salim, father of the two children, has filed a case in the high court, alleging that the NGO projected his healthy children as thalassaemic. He also told the court that their school had expelled the children after finding out about the dupe.

 But his daughter is still a student of Class VIII in our school and he pulled his son out on his own, said headmaster Singh, with Salim present. Salim, an autorickshaw driver, lives with his family of six in a slum in Srirampur Pally, Garia. 

 Sonali Chowdhury Dasgupta, who used to run the NGO that is now defunct, said she had not said all the children at the event were thalassaemic. I said only one child suffered from the disease, she said. 

 She said that the photograph published in a Bengali daily was misleading, suggesting all the children were thalassaemic. The daily later clarified that only one child was thalassaemic, she said. 

 Sonali, a former coordinator of the Thalassaemia Society of India, filed a defamation suit against Salim for Rs 2,50,000. Salims case was first heard at Alipore criminal court, which dismissed the petition. Then, his lawyer Subrata Mukhopadhyay moved the high court.

 Return to nature for a meal that nurtures

 Industrialist Karan Paul has been into organic food for a while now. His home garden, in Alipore, boasts an inviting green patch, growing the choicest of vegetables, organically of course. I must admit that I really relish my home-grown supply of organic spinach, cabbage, avocado, tomatoes and herbs, smiles Paul.

 The luxury of food items grown without synthetic fertilisers or pesticides blooming on home turf is rare, but more and more retail racks around town are giving Calcuttans the option of going organic and monitoring their intake of calories.

 Though priced higher than conventional farm produce, the organic food movement is catching on, driven by both exports and by discerning domestic customers. 

 Agricultural scientists estimate that tens of thousands of farmers across India are now practising organic cultivation across two million hectares of land, just a fraction of the total area under cultivation, nation wide.

 Using bio-fertilisers ? cocktails of soil bacteria and fungi ? and an appropriate choice of crops to cultivate in different seasons, they produce organic cereals and legumes, tea and spices, vegetables and honey.

 Rajasthans Churu, Jhunjhunu and Sikar districts have the nations highest density of organic farmers ? more than 5,000 farmers growing a range of crops that end up on food shelves in speciality stores and on special organic menus.

 It has acquired a momentum of its own, and is growing, says Mukesh Gupta, executive director of the not-for-profit Morarka Foundation in Jaipur that pioneered organic farming in the mid-1990s through a range of technologies, including the rearing of earthworms to aid organic cultivation.

 IMG Organic Farms, which markets its organic products directly, is an affiliate of Uttaranchal Organic Community Board. 

 It sells the basmati and red rice varieties, chilli powder, turmeric powder, groundnuts, soya flour, urad dal and rajma.

 While the red rice costs about Rs 80 per kg, the chilli powder costs Rs 150 per kg and the rajma Rs 76. The ordinary variety of these products would range anywhere between Rs 30 and Rs 70.

 There are no chemicals involved and the farmers produce also comes down when they go for organic cultivation. To make up for these losses incurred by the farmers, the government levies a tax of 25 per cent, sending prices soaring. All varieties of organic foods also go through process certification where the products have to be monitored from day one. The effort that goes into growing organic food is extensive, says Dibyendu Ghosh, partner, IMG Organic Farms.

 Shop stop

 The IMG Organic Farms products do not reach the racks of Calcutta where organic food sourced from a few sources is steadily gaining ground.

 Departmental stores like C3 (Lee Road, City Centre and The Gariahaat Mall), Health Food Centre on Loudon Street and Health Shoppe on Rowland Road have been stocking a host of organic products for some time now.

 Of late, more than 40 per cent of people who shop at C3 opt for organic food. The intake of calories is automatically monitored and the natural factor associated with it plays a greater role in its growing popularity, says Partha, a spokesperson for the store with three outlets in Calcutta.

 And even though priced much higher (almost double that of the regular variety), people actually dont mind shelling out more for health and fitness, he adds.

 Apart from the variety of rice and pulses, the organic food section at the City Centre C3 also boasts green vegetables like beans, cabbage, cauliflower, carrots, apples, turnips, green peas and the like. 

 The store grows these at its own farm Keventer Agro Ltd in Barasat.

 All these vegetables are fresh from the soil, and no chemicals are used whatsoever in cultivating them. Production costs are a little high and hence prices of the products are also higher than the ordinary variety. Since people have now become very health conscious, they do not mind spending that extra buck for something that is good for health, says Sabyasachi Ghosh, spokesperson for the City Centre outlet.

 The spices are moving very well as people have become health conscious and are willing to experiment, adds Deepak Saraf, proprietor of Health Shoppe on Rowland Road.

 So, is organic food the future? The jury is out on whether organic farming is indeed viable at a national level. Its unlikely that organic food alone can meet all of Indias food demand, says Paritosh Bhattacharya, director of the National Centre for Organic Farming in Ghaziabad, which has developed bio-fertiliser technologies and demonstrated organic cultivation techniques to over 125,000 farmers.

 With organic cultivation, the yield of crops that require high levels of nitrogen can drop by 20 per cent, warns Jashwant Purohit, head of the organic foods division of FabIndia, the clothes and handicrafts store that diversified into this domain two years ago.

 Many of FabIndias outlets now have organic food sections, offering staple cereals, spices, coffee, jams and pickles, among a range of about 200 products. 

 Its still a nascent business, but the repeat buyers are growing in numbers, adds Purohit.

 With eating what comes naturally becoming a matter of fitness and fashion, and disposable incomes growing steadily, organic food can only grow bigger on the retail racks in the metros.

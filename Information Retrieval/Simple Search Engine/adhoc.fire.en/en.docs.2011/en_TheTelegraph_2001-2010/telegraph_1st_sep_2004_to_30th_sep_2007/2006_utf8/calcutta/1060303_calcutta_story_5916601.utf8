 Haute home to designers galore

 Ritu Beri, Neeta Lulla, Suneet Verma, Niki Mahajan, Anita Dongre, Kilol? all under one roof in the heart of the city.

 Belong, the latest to join the growing list of fashionable addresses around town, promises to be home to around 35 designers at 99 Park Street. Fancy Italian marble flooring over 3,000 sq ft, cool wooden lamps and unusual artefacts catch your eye as you glance around the design den with happy hues. 

 Sharing floor space are some of Indias big names, established Calcutta labels and young talent. Apart from showcasing well-known brands, we also wanted to provide a platform for budding designers, says Seema Sarawgi, proprietor of Belong.

 The Calcutta line-up has names like Dev and Nil, Preeti Jhawar, Chhuti, Sayon Mitra, Akriti, Svayam, Priyanjali Roy, Elaichi and Ksara. Others that make their presence felt are Charissa, Anupama, Linarika, Shalini, Shashi, Neha Agarwal, Ohsaas, Aksh, Khushi, Natasha, Inkasso and Facini.

 The thrust here, too, like in most other city boutiques, is on ethnic, that forms about 80 per cent of their stocks. 

 Westerns in the form of long skirts, embroidered pants and tunics can also be spotted. Available here are all kinds of suits ? from everyday smart cottons to intricately embroidered georgettes and crepes. People in Calcutta are a little conservative. Though this is my first fashion venture, I always go by one simple rule ? if only I feel that I would buy and wear a particular outfit does that piece find space in my store, says Seema. 

 After scouting the country for a complete list of designers sharing similar design sensibilities, Seema and her team are happy with the citys response.

 We are not looking at an in-house brand immediately but yes, building the brand Belong outside the city can be looked at, she adds.

 The jewellery is handpicked from Mumbai, comprising an eclectic mix of silver, fancy stones, beads and mother-of-pearl. The range is wide and is tagged suitably, with prices starting from Rs 250.

 Another interesting section is the display of bags and footwear. Designed by Namrata Kanoi, the collections boast both formal and funky pieces. The emphasis this season is on bag handles, says Namrata. The range at Belong flaunts exquisite metal and chain handles and ornamented clutch bags. I have converted some neckpieces into handles. Even the clutch bags have a brooch on top that can be used separately, she adds. 

 Potlis for the wedding season and summery printed bags in citrus hues also find favour. The footwear ranges from regular slippers to stone-studded sandals, all priced at Rs 1,000-plus.

 The relentless rain and slow-moving 

 traffic were hardly hurdles for youngsters as more than 

 500 of them showed up at Corporate Careers 2006 at Hotel 

 Hindusthan International on July 29. The event was the last 

 in a series of programmes held in the city over four months 

 as part of Yuva ? the Power of Youth, a festival organised 

 in Calcutta by AIESEC and The Telegraph Careergraph.

 Corporate Careers stood out among 

 the usual career fairs with its focus on round-table sessions 

 with the representatives of the participating companies, 

 mock group discussions and interviews conducted by IMS and 

 interactions with alumni of IIM Ahmedabad.

 The companies that set up stalls 

 were IMS, Tata Steel, SREI, ABP Pvt Ltd, Bengal Ambuja, 

 Hutch and 2COMS. For them, the meet was an opportunity to 

 create a database of potential employees. Indrani Chatterjee, 

 an assistant manager (human resources) with Hutch, said: 

 ?We have received over 200 registrations. We will decide 

 on whom to recruit after taking into consideration our requirements 

 and the youngsters? profiles.?

 The youths, on the other hand, 

 got a peek into what the companies? recruitment policies 

 were and the nature of job openings. A group of current 

 and graduate management students from Heritage Institute 

 of Technology was clearly impressed after interacting with 

 the representatives of ABP Pvt Ltd and Bengal Ambuja. They 

 felt that the forum had helped youngsters groom themselves 

 to fit the respective requirements of the companies.

 Also on the lookout for greener 

 pastures were executives. ?I am working with a reputed company 

 after a masters in environmental sciences. With increasing 

 stress on corporate social responsibility, there seems to 

 be quite a few openings that I can consider,? said a young 

 woman. At the mock group discussion that started from 2 

 pm, a group of youngsters debated heatedly on whether or 

 not politicians should step down after a certain age to 

 make way for fresh blood.

 On July 28, six students from 

 schools, colleges and B-schools battled it out in Big Fight 

 at Kala Mandir. Vishesh Kothari of St James School, Abhishek 

 Sanyal of St Xavier?s Collegiate School and Surma Guha of 

 Presidency College bagged the top three prizes in the debate. 

 St Xavier?s College, Presidency College and St James School 

 emerged winners in the western music competition that followed.

 ?Yuva is the first youth festival 

 of its kind in Calcutta and we are overwhelmed by the response, 

 especially at Corporate Careers,? said Umesh Bhutoria, president 

 of AIESEC in Calcutta.

 The minimum age requirement for 

 joining AIESEC is to be a first-year college student. Even 

 young graduates and postgraduates seek membership to help 

 secure internships abroad. Moiz Rangoonwala, vice president 

 (public relations) of AIESEC Calcutta, said the organisation 

 has a strict screening process for granting membership.

 ?Parents pay your bills?

 TV host turns film director

 Host of many chat and countdown 

 shows on the small screen, Sajid Khan, who doesn?t spare 

 anyone, was in town recently to judge a contest for a TV 

 channel. A Young Metro reader caught up with the anchor-turned-film 

 director.

 How is Sajid Khan in real life?

 I?m the same person as you see 

 on screen. I love movies and I like talking about them. 

 I hate people who don?t love movies.

 Were you naughty as a kid?

 Naughty is being cute. I was dangerous 

 (laughs).

 Who is your favourite comedian?

 Johnny Lever.

 You have made fun of almost everybody in Bollywood 

 on your shows. Has anybody taken offence?

 No, because all that I do on screen 

 is just fun. I never ever mean to hurt anybody. But I have 

 reduced my antics now.

 What makes you laugh ?

 Funny films, funny people and 

 funny moments.

 Does your sister Farha influence you in any way?

 Of course! She taught me that 

 if you work hard and honestly, nothing can stop you from 

 reaching your destination.

 Do you want to change anything about yourself?

 I want to lose 10 kgs soon.

 Are you doing anything new at present?

 I?m directing a film for Sajid 

 Nadiadwala called Hey Baby. It?s a multi- starrer. 

 What is the worst mistake you?ve made since you 

 joined the film industry?

 Falling in love (laughs).

 Any message for Young Metro readers?

 Always listen to your parents 

 because they pay all your bills. Also, never get caught 

 cheating (laughs)!

 my diary

 Loss

 It was the end... almost

 Every teardrop had dried up,

 Most lives were over

 It was a closed chapter

 The air laden with sorrow and anxiety

 Laments strewn everywhere

 They had done it

 Ruthless savages

 With a heart of lead

 Had torn through our soul

 Leaving life ablaze...

 This poem is dedicated to Ashis 

 Ghosh Roy, a disaster management expert with Geological 

 Survey of India, who died in the recent blasts in Srinagar. 

 He was a close family friend and a truly wonderful person.

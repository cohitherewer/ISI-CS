 A 

 spring stripped of colours is a rarity but the spring of 

 2007 promises to be just that. The ongoing India Fashion 

 Week in the Capital showcasing the countrys line-up 

 for spring-summer 2007 held a clear pointer on the very 

 first day (Wednesday) that white would be the flavour of 

 the seasons style. The collections of design biggies 

 Rahul Khanna and Rohit Gandhi, as well as Rohit Bal, were 

 all dominated by whites and ivories.

 The trend was re-established on 

 Day II, with the ramp replete with whites, off-whites, ivories, 

 creams and beiges. The fashion extravaganza at The Grand 

 on Thursday was a pointer to another strong trend neat 

 and crisp silhouettes sans embellishments and opulence.

 An impressive collection by design 

 duo Manju amp; Bobby Grover embodied both the trends, with 

 clean and minimalist clothes broken up in three distinctly 

 different lines. An all-white lounge-wear line with balloon 

 skirts, trapeze dresses, bubble dresses, wraparound pants 

 and more boasted detailing in the form of pleating, hand-tucking, 

 applique and cutwork.

 The second collection was feminine 

 and flirty baby doll dresses, empire lines, knee-length 

 skirts with pink, orange, aqua and lime highlights on 

 white base. The next line of daywear clothes in ivory, ecru 

 and beige had semi-fitted and smart shapes, and the final 

 line was striking in black and white.

 The next show Ashima and Leena 

 shared pretty much the same palette to start with. Clean 

 lines and a general soothing feel dominated the flowing 

 and layered chiffons and georgettes. High-waisted trousers, 

 tunics, shorts, A-line skirts, layered saris and more made 

 up the collection. Shades of ivory, cream, vanilla and sand 

 were a strong contrast to the pure blacks that finished 

 the show.

 The day dominated by design duos 

 came to a close with Shantanu and Nikhil showing a beautiful 

 collection inspired by nature. Rich taffeta silks, nets, 

 knits and chiffons shaped the fluid lines loose tops with 

 knee-length lowers, knee-length skirts, shorts, and a variety 

 of knee-length dresses. Beige, gold, champagne, pink, grey, 

 with a dash of cherry and green formed the colour story, 

 one of the high points of the collection. The other highlight 

 was the use of a varying combination of box pleats and embroidered 

 pleats. The stylish and understated collection reminiscent 

 of the vintage 50s had a soft, romantic and feminine 

 feel.

 The only exception to the otherwise 

 subdued day was a show by Falguni and Shane Peacock, and 

 one by Manav Gangwani earlier in the day. The Peacock duo 

 displayed a trademark jewelled line marked by in-your-face 

 glamour. Animal prints in multiple hues, colourful flowers 

 and stripes were accentuated with semi-precious stones, 

 diamantes, beads, sequins and crochet. Slip dresses, kaftans, 

 jackets, balloon dresses and long shirts made up the very-Bollywood 

 collection.

 Manav Gangwani took the ramp next 

 and showcased a line that could hardly be differentiated 

 from the Peacock collection. The same riot of colours, the 

 same jewelled look with crystals, beads and sequins and 

 even the same florals and a hint of animal prints made Manavs 

 collection look somewhat like a clone of the earlier one. 

 The otherwise missable show managed to generate a buzz as 

 the sarod siblings Amaan and Ayaan made a couple of 

 appearances on the ramp, looking their coolest best.

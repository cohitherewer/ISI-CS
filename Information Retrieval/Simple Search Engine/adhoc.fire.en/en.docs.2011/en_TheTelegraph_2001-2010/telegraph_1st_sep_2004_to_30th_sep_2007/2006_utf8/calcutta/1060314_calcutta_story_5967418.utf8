The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

On amp; Off

 Holi spirit, look who?s with who 

Screen On amp; Off

From Rang barse to Rang de basanti, movies 

have epitomised the mood of the festival. Metro picks a few oddball pairs 

to colour things up

MALLIKA SHERAWAT amp; JACKIE CHAN

No myth here. He likes her ?great pair?. She likes 

his international tag. Together, they are the most colourful ? and clicked ? couple 

to have graced the global red carpet in the year gone by. Reason enough for the 

Haryana Hurricane (sorry, Kapil paaji) and the Chinese Chan to go all bawdy 

in the boldest festival of the year. And if a maudlin Mallika can have Jackie 

crash-landing in Mumbai, a whimper here and a scamper there can sure melt the 

action star to run after Miss Murder, crying ?Malika, Malika? with a pichkari 

in hand. 

Aishwarya Rai amp; Daniel Craig

All she ever wanted was to Bond with the best. As 

long as it is a 007 tux, Ash won?t mind smearing some gulal on it, doesn?t 

matter who is in it, Brosnan or Craig. Of course, it would have helped had her 

Bluffmaster been cast as the British super-agent. But that?s asking for too much 

from our hip-hop AB Baby (Jr). So, before Craig has Bond girl Thandie Crash 

Newton shaking and stirring his martini, Ash can try her nimbooda tricks 

on the blue-eyed British blond. The height difference may pose a petty problem 

but having sworn hum dil de chuke sanam to Sallu Miyan and matched her 

taal with Akshaye Khanna before, Ash knows how to make men look up to her. 

And since she?s all geared up to slip into a bikini for Dhoom II anyway, 

don?t be surprised if Ash does a Halle Berry either.

rani mukherjee amp; will smith

The Black woman with the Man in Black in a 

riot of colours... The buzz is she doesn?t like him all that much for all the 

Rai reasons. But then again, isn?t the love-hate relationship streaked with more 

colours than drab devotion? If Rani can go Vari, vari with Aamir for Holi, 

she should surely be happy to get Hitch-ed to Mr Holly.

alice patten amp; aamir khan

Ya, ya, he?s just got married but then what has marriage 

ever got to do with a Holi-daying silsila? Don?t we all want to see what 

we couldn?t in Rang De Basanti? Don?t we all want DJ to remix Sue kar 

mere mann ko... one more time? Yeh sab tu mila mila re aur rang tu khila 

khila re aur dono ko rang de...

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

On amp; Off

Video call of a cause 

Screen On amp; Off

 Director?s cut: June

 She had turned director with telefilms some time ago. Now June is all set to direct a set of two music videos on AIDS awareness. To be recorded in Bengali and Hindi, the four-minute track will have music by Kanishka Sarkar, Tanmoy Bose and Ratul Shankar, and boasts a strong line-up of singers.

 Names tipped for the Bengali version are Usha Uthup, Nachiketa, Rupankar, Raghab, Rupam (Fossils) and KC (Lakkhichara), while the Hindi number is likely to feature Usha again, along with Babul Supriyo, KK, Shaan and Sagarika.

 The Bengali lyrics will be penned by Anindya (ex-Parash Pathar member), while Sanjeev Tiwari of Power FM fame will script the Hindi words. ?Women and children are the worst sufferers as victims of wrong notions on how AIDS spreads. I intend to break these myths and hope to throw some light through these music videos,? says June, who hopes to start shooting in September.

 ?It?s all for charity, so anyone who supports the cause is welcome. I plan to release the Hindi music video on various national channels, especially MTV, in order to generate a mass appeal that this cause requires,? the actress adds.

 June plans to jazz up the music videos with star names from the sports-and-entertainment arena ? Sourav Ganguly and Bhaichung Bhutia, Prosenjit and Koel Mullick.

 The Hindi version will star Sunil and Rohan Gavaskar. ?I will talk to John Abraham and Bipasha Basu and I am sure they will be willing to endorse the cause,? feels June.

 The backdrop for both the music videos will be Calcutta, as June wants to showcase the city. ?I plan to shoot in Calcutta and Mumbai and I will start the project as soon as the rains stop,? she stresses. 

 HIV-positive women and children will join the stars to spread awareness.

 Kanishka, who is composing the music, said: ?We?ll start recording by the end of this month. The chorus of the song will have an up-tempo and bright feel while the song will carry the appeal of an inspiring anthem.?

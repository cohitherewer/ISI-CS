 Misplaced movements

 Throughout the course of history, a number of independent attempts have been made by enlightened individuals to improve the lot of the common people in our country. They have tried in vain to eliminate superstitions and have failed to spread the light of education and knowledge. Based on episodes during the Bengal Renaissance, Aagantuk analyses reasons for the failure of the different isolated movements for the uplift of the people. Derozio had created the Young Bengal Association with the idealistic vision of social reform through education. Unfortunately, the young revolutionaries led by him went astray, and the movement died an untimely death. Proponents of liberal thought and supporters of womens education like Raja Radhakanta Dev were also inconsistent in their efforts to bring about change. Perhaps, lack of proper leadership and guidance was one of the main causes for the failure of Bengals reform movements. Direction: Swapan Sengupta. Hosted by EZCC.

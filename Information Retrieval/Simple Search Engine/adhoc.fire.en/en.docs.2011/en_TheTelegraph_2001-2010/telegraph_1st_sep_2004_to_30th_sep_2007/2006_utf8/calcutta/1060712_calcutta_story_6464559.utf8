 Mandate framed for Sector V monitor

 A STAFF REPORTER

The government has framed rules for Nabadiganta Industrial Township Authority, a new set-up entrusted with looking after the basic amenities, including infrastructure, in Salt Lake?s Sector V.

 The rules, specifying the mandate of the authority, have been passed in the Assembly.

 The authority has been formed following an amendment to the West Bengal Municipal Act, 1993, to keep the industrial area of the township out of the purview of the Salt Lake municipality.

 It will be run by a panel comprising eight members, excluding the chairman and vice-chairman. S.A. Ahmed, special secretary in the chief minister?s secretariat, has been nominated chairman.

 Among the members are three representatives of industries located in the authority?s jurisdiction, North 24-Parganas superintendent of police, Bidhannagar sub-divisional officer and a representative each of the municipal affairs department, urban development department and the CMDA. 

 The government will nominate the members, who will hold office for five years.

 A person convicted of an offence punishable under sections 171E and 171F of the Indian Penal Code or holding an office of profit or elected to a local body will not be eligible for membership of the panel.

 The authority will have nine departments, including general administration, public works, water supply, public health, education and revenue.

 The panel will hold regular meetings to adopt plans for upgrading infrastructure, such as roads, lights, water supply, sewerage, drainage and environment. The authority has also been empowered to impose taxes or tap other sources for revenue.

 It has asked the CMDA to set up two food courts and two modern bus terminuses, augment drinking water supply and beautify the area by involving private companies.

 ?Four private firms have submitted expressions of interest for setting up the food courts,? said CMDA chief executive officer P.R. Baviskar. 

 ?We have also invited bids for beautification of the area and providing miscellaneous services, like operating PCO booths, parking lots and maintaining electricity posts. So far, 18 companies have expressed interest in the projects,? Baviskar added.

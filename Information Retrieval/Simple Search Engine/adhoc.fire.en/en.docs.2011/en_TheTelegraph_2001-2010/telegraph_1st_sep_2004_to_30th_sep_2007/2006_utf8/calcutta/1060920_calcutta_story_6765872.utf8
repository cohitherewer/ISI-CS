 Tech aid for trench-less sewer fix

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 Experts from Europe, the US and Japan have offered the civic authorities technology to overhaul underground sewers without digging roads.

 Two former technical experts of Thames Water Authority, London, and engineers from Austria, Japan and Michigan approached the civic body last week, expressing interest in rejuvenating the brick sewers without excavating the roads. 

 Before leaving for Delhi, municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay had held a meeting with the experts on Saturday evening. Former Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority chief engineer Basishtha Sengupta was present, along with civic engineers.

 Two sewer revamp schemes, worth Rs 500 crore, will soon be undertaken in the city under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission. The projects a Rs 100-crore overhaul of the non-man entry brick sewers in north and central Calcutta and a Rs 400-crore rejuvenation of the man-entry brick sewers are expected to solve the waterlogging problem. They will be the first overhaul of the underground brick sewers since Independence, claimed mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya.

 Bandyopadhyay confirmed from Delhi on Tuesday evening that a technical committee of the urban renewal scheme had approved the Rs 100-crore project. The second scheme, also submitted for approval on Tuesday, was received positively at the secretary-level meeting, he added.

 Most of the more-than- 100-year-old brick sewers in the city, the mainstay of the citys drainage system, are in a bad state and in desperate need of a revamp. Deposition of silt and collapse of walls have narrowed the drains. 

 The brick sewer system laid by British engineer WW Clerk in 1874 had the capacity to drain out surface run-off of 16 mm rain per hour. The capacity has now come down to less than four mm per hour due to choking of the sewers..

 Their revamp will be carried out by the trench-less process to allow traffic flow on the road. It will be the largest trench-less project in the country, said Bandyopadhyay.

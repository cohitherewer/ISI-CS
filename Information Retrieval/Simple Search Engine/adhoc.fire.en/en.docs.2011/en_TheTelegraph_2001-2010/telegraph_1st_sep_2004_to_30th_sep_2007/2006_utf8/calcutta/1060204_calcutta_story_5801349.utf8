 David Holly: Some of the best is on offer

 Cricket isn?t the sole connect with the Kangaroos any more. 

 Australia is now keen to give Calcutta a taste of its cultural history, hopes and aspirations, while striving to foster ?people-to-people? linkages through various art forms.

 ?AusArts India: film, arts, literature?, a two-year programme of Australian contemporary arts, will be formally launched in the city by Australian high commissioner in India John McCarthy on February 7.

 Supported by the Australian government through the Australia International Cultural Council, the presentation will ?showcase the vitality and innovation of current Australian practice? by focusing on film, visual art and design, literature and the performing arts.

 ?Australia is very multi-cultural, and AusArts India presents an opportunity for Indian audiences to connect with some of the best that Australia has to offer,? says David Holly, minister and deputy high commissioner, Australian high commission in India.

 The ?guest of honour? country this year, Australia will be the ?focus country? at the Calcutta Book Fair in 2007. 

 ?We had a delegation of 10 noted Australian authors at the book fair this year, and we sure hope to top that in the next edition,? says Holly, in town for the book fair.

 The authors are also conducting workshops and masterclasses and contributing to a conference at Calcutta University on ?Globalisation and post-colonial writing?.

 The tenor for the cultural collage from Down Under was set last November itself, with a package of Australian films at the Calcutta film festival, including ?some of the most significant features and shorts produced in recent years?.

 As part of AusArts, Calcutta will also host an aboriginal arts exhibition ? Seasons of the Kunwinjku (pronounced goonwinggoo) ? at Genesis Art Gallery from February 8 to 12. 

 The collection of works reflects the lyrical grace of West Arnhem Land?s rich artistic tradition.

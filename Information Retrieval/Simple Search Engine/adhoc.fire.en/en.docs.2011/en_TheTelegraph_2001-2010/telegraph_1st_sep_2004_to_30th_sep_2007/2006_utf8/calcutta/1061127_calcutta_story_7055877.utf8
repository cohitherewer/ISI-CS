The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Abhi amp; I the real machinery

 Now a veteran of the Dhoom game, UDAY CHOPRA tells Pratim D. Gupta why he doesnt mind getting lost in the star crowd and why he is not doing any other film

 Uday Chopra with 

 Bipasha Basu in Dhoom 2 

 His director Sanjay Gadhvi feels he is five times funnier in the sequel and going by the laughs Uday Chopra garnered in the first day first show of Dhoom 2 in Calcutta, he is not far off. As Abhishek Bachchans sidekick in the years most awaited film, Udays Ali gets the best lines in the film. Watching him do a David Hasselhoff by running on the Rio beaches in Baywatch gear with Bipasha Basu in tow is one of the highlights of D:2. 

 Seen on the big screen after a year his last release was the immensely forgettable Neal N Nikki Uday takes off from where he left off in the 2004 bike blockbuster. Resorting to his mummy up in the heavens whenever he sees a possible match, the Mohabbatein debutant holds his own against the more seasoned stars. This time he gets to romance Bipashas Monali Bose, twin sister of Mumbai cop Shonali Bose, and the two even sing a song on the sands of Brazil which goes My name is Ali, kahaan chali manchali...

 But it is in the closing reels of Dhoom 2 when he gets to vroom-vroom again that Uday is in top gear. He may not quite be in favour in the industry but just like it happened with Dhoom, D:2 may get the hilarious hunk back in action. This is what he had to say a day before the release of Dhoom 2.

 Did you expect Dhoom to become such a cult film when 

 you shot for it?

 When we made Dhoom, we were attempting something like this for the first time. It was new for all of us. We didnt know at that time that the film will be accepted as a genre in itself and our characters will be loved so much. And now that Dhoom 2 is releasing we are excited all over again and hoping that it receives the same adulation like last time.

 Do you think Dhoom 2 can be bigger than Dhoom?

 Dhoom 2 is definitely bigger than Dhoom and there is much more in it than what one got in the first part. So yes, I think it should blow the first part right out of the ballpark but thats just what I hope for. All I can tell the audience is that all those who enjoyed Dhoom 1 will like Dhoom 2 two times more.

 Was it difficult to reprise your character when you started 

 shooting for D:2?

 Not really. All the mannerisms and gestures and throwing of the one-liners came pretty naturally to me. It was like an extension of the first film. My look in the sequel, like the overall look of the film, is very different. Instead of giving him the same long hair, we cut it short, but at the same time retained the bandana. We also cut out his jackets and the layered look and gave him more of a leaner feel in the film. But the character remains the same. So it wasnt so difficult to play Ali again. He is like the North Star, always constant, whatever situation he is in. 

 Here you are a cop but in your usual tapori style

 Ali has become a cop because he turned over a new leaf in the last film. He is very proud of being one but besides that everything else in his mind is pretty much the same. He is the same innocent, funny, smart alecky kind of person. According to him, if he is not in Nagpada then all he knows is that he is somewhere else. So be it Goa or Rio, Ali is totally comfortable wherever he goes.

 This time the star cast has gone even bigger. Any fear of 

 getting lost in the crowd?

 If I am getting lost in the crowd, it is a crowd of huge stars. And if I am noticed amongst these people, nothing like it. I think looking at everyone as stars is a wrong way of looking at them. Whether its Hrithik or Abhishek, they are playing characters and for the film to be good these characters have to be written really well. 

 But isnt the film all about Hrithik and Aishwarya?

 See every film is a different creature. Hrithik and Ash may be the central characters of Dhoom 2 but they cannot move without us. Abhishek and I are the real machinery of Dhoom. And not just this one, for every Dhoom. That is how the plot has been approached. 

 Why are we getting to see so little of you?

 I would rather do no work than do stuff that I dont enjoy. To be honest, Im not really in a position to be picky and choosy but then again any project has to work for me mentally before I agree to do it. I dont believe that the industry has not given me my due. I will not use the excuse of being Yash Chopras son as a means of justifying why other producers have not cast me. Maybe someone else in my place would have pushed things around a bit more.

 Are you planning a switch behind the camera?

 Not as yet. I know, as I am the son of Yash Chopra and brother of Aditya Chopra, people think I should make movies but I dont think I am ready. I do give my opinions at the meetings and all but the decision has always been with my father and brother. I want to do some more acting before taking a call.

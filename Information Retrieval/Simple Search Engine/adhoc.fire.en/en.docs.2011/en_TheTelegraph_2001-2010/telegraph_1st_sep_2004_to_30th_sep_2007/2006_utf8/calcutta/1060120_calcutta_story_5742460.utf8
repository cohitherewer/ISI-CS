 A lily pond off Victoria

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 An expert committee constituted by the high court on Thursday opined that the Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners should construct a lily pond instead of a fountain in the park being built in the southern portion of the Victoria Memorial Hall compound.

 According to the committee, depletion of groundwater by operating the fountain could cause problems for the Memorial. The court also emphasised the need to plant mango, neem and kanakchampa trees in the park.

 In a report submitted in court during the day, the Memorial authorities said Jessop and Company was trying hard to make the angel atop the monument twirl again.

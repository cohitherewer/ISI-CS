 SANJAY MANDAL

 Foreign airlines are going in for another round of fare cuts to lure Calcuttans into flying to southeast Asia and Europe this summer.

 While Singapore Airlines is readying to slash its fares to Kuala Lumpur and Zurich from Calcutta, Malaysian Airlines has announced a cut. Also on offer are promotional prices by low-cost carriers and new entrant Emirates. 

 Singapore Airlines currently charges Rs 30,000 plus taxes for a round trip to Zurich. ?We are planning to bring down the fare to the Rs 20,000-25,000 range,? stated Bharat Mahadevan, manager (east). 

 On the Calcutta-Kuala Lumpur sector, a Singapore Airlines ticket costs Rs 10,000 minus taxes for a round trip. Mahadevan said the amount would be reduced by nearly 40 per cent. ?The new rates will be announced soon,? he added.

 Malaysian Airlines fares to Kuala Lumpur, Langkavi and Penang from Calcutta have been slashed on specific days this month and the next. The ticket price to these destinations has been brought down to Rs 7,000 from Rs 11,580 (plus taxes) on March 22, 25 and 27, and April 12 and 15.

 The round trip fare for Calcutta-Kuala Lumpur-Singapore on these dates will be Rs 7,500, said airline officials.

 Malaysian Airlines is coming up with packages for Kuala Lumpur, Langkavi and Penang. For Rs 14,999, the airline is planning to offer a three night-four day holiday. 

 ?We have also decided to reduce the taxes,? said Mohammed Safri Abdullah, manager (east India), Malaysian Airlines. The levy of $37 per ticket has been brought down to $25 from March.

 The airline will replace the Boeing 737 used for the Calcutta operations with Airbus 330 and Airbus 220 to accommodate more passengers.

 Apart from these two airlines, Jet Star Asia is offering a promotional fare of Rs 4,500 (plus taxes) for a return trip to Singapore. The regular fare is Rs 9,000 without taxes. 

 Emirates, which will start operations from Calcutta to Dubai on March 26, will offer a promotional fare of Rs 15,500 (plus taxes) for a round trip. 

 ?The tourist season will begin from March. Southeast and west Asia, and Europe are the most sought after destinations,? said Anil Punjabi, chairman (east), Travel Agents Federation of India.

Doing this and that

Screen On amp; Off

 Shes all set to make it to the small screen with Sahara Ones new talent-hunt show Super Stars. URMILA MATONDKAR speaks to Sudeshna Banerjee about her debut on television, about matching steps with Helen in the Sholay remake, and about her aversion to bad films.

 Why launch this innings on 

 television?

 I have received offers to do TV shows earlier also. But this one involved full-fledged judging rather than just putting in an appearance. The concept was exciting. It will not be just one particular quality that Shiamak (Davar) and I are supposed to judge in a contestant, but all-round ability as a performer. Its related to me professionally.

 Does this open the floodgates 

 for the mimics who perform at parties?

 Not at all! Then it would have been called Super Mimic. The performers have to bring out the special quality that makes a particular superstar who he is. Id enjoy watching the Amitabhs and the Shah Rukhs.

 Wouldnt you want to see yourself 

 being mimicked as well? 

 I am a judge. I cant be on the list. And in all modesty, I have seen a lot of people trying to be Urmila Matondkar. Its nothing new to me. But yes, on a less serious note, I love watching children perform Chhamma chhamma on TV shows like Boogie Woogie. Some of these five to seven-year-olds do it better than me!

 Does it take it back to 

 your Masoom days? 

 I was in Standard IV when I did Masoom. I come from a simple Maharashtrian family where everyone on my mothers side is a doctor and all lawyers and engineers on my fathers. So I did that one film and was promptly sent back to school. It was a twist of fate that I became an actor. My family did not want me to join this industry. As far as my parents were concerned, it could at best have been a hobby. 

 Has the attitude towards Hindi 

 films changed?

 Absolutely. Today, the word filmi does not carry a negative connotation any more. Parents understand their childrens wishes and they are ready to push them this way.

 Is it because Hindi films deal 

 with a different social reality and address a more upper-class 

 audience? 

 Yes. In my next film Bas Ek 

 Pal (picture with Sanjay Suri), which should be releasing 

 very soon, I am playing a civil engineer. She is absolutely 

 a todays girl ambitious, sexy, confident, and also quite 

 sensitive. There is nothing of the typical Hindi film heroine 

 in her. The character has a beautiful, real quality about 

 her. It makes people in the audience think This could happen 

 to me. I had seen Onirs last film My Brother... Nikhil. 

 I was so impressed that I wanted to work with him. This 

 movie is about relationships and how one incident changes 

 ones life, ones ties.

 After Benaras, Bas 

 Ek Pal. Are you moving away from mainstream cinema? 

 As a creative person, I want to do something different from the run-of-the-mill films. At this stage of my career, I can keep doing these roles or take a road less travelled. Benaras received critical acclaim. I dont want to waste time with bad films. But I am doing such (mainstream) work as well. I am doing the Helen song in Sholay. Even when I do commercial cinema, the challenge is to do things in a better way.

 Is Mehbooba mehbooba 

 one of your favourite dance numbers?

 Audiowise, it is a favourite. Id like to do a good job. But Helen is Helen. Who can compare with her? 

 What comes next? 

 I have just signed a film. Work will start next month. My next release will be an action-packed thriller by Vikram Bhatt, produced by Harry Baweja. I am the central character. The cast also has Zayed (Khan), Aftab (Shivdasani), Sanjay Suri again (after Bas Ek Pal) and Tanushree Dutta. Only the climax is left to be shot. I have some free time now. So youll see me on TV.

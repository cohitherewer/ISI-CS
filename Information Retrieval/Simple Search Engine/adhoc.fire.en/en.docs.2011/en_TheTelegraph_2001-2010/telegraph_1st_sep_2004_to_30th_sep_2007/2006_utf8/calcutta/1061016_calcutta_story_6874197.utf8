The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Pill that works within 72 hrs

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Bunty, 18, met Rahul (both names changed) at a discotheque. Their subsequent outings drew them closer to each other and they finally got physical.

 She was not on pills, and worse still, not far from her period. As this dawned on her, Bunty panicked. She became evasive, but her watchful mother could manage to get the truth out of her.

 The mother called a gynaecologist she knew well without wasting time. The doctor prescribed just two tablets, to be taken at an interval of 12 hours. The Emergency Contraception (EC) saved the young girl from a probable trauma and unwanted pregnancy.

 Many adolescent girls, married women without proper ideas about contraception and pregnancy, and victims of rape have now within their reach a very effective method to ward off unintended pregnancy, thanks to the EC. 

 The only problem, experts say, is that the method has not gained wide acceptance in Calcutta, due to lack of awareness.

 With change in lifestyle, teenage premarital pregnancies are increasing in the city, said a city-based infertility specialist. Doctors can provide emergency contraception to check unwanted pregnancies followed by abortion.

 The issue will also be discussed at the 50th All India Congress of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, to be held in the city from January 5 to 7 next year. The conference will be held under the aegis of the state unit of the Federation of Obstetrics and Gynaecological Societies of India. 

 Close to 10,000 delegates, including a hundred from other countries, are expected to participate in this first-ever meet in eastern India.

 Gita Ganguly Mukherjee, organising chairperson of the meeting, said that to intercept pregnancy, two Levonorgestrel tablets would have to be administered, 12 hours apart, as early as possible after sexual intercourse. The doses will not work if they are given after 72 hours. 

 It is not a substitute for regular contraceptives, but an effective backup. Its need is being felt more and more as studies indicate the rising incidence of unwanted pregnancy and a high mortality rate due to abortions, she said.

 Infant battles all odds to survive

 - PREMATURE MORTALITY RATE DOWN

 A STAFF REPORTER

 In a rare case of survival, a girl born 14 weeks premature overcame a series of complications to stay alive. Bottles of blood, platelets and plasma, along with a number of intravenous drugs, helped the baby ? born on the 26th week of her mother?s gestation period ? survive.

 ?Its nothing less than a miracle. She has overcome a number of complications to stay alive,? said paediatrician Santanu Ray, who treated the baby at Woodlands Medical Centre. She was in the neo-natal intensive therapy unit (NITU) for more than a month.

 A few years ago, the mortality rate of premature babies in the city was nearly 60 per cent. But now, it has come down to less than 30 per cent. ?The improved neo-natal facility has brought down the mortality rate,? explained Apurba Ghosh, director of the Institute of Child Health.

 ?These premature babies have a lot of problems, like chronic lung diseases, cerebral palsy and learning disorder. But with the advanced neo-natal support systems, such complications have also come down,? a doctor said.

 Paediatrician Ray elaborated: ?These babies are deficient in surfactant, an important component for lung maturity.? 

 The lungs of an embryo start forming after 28 weeks and after 32 weeks, they get well developed, he added. 

 Hence, babies born before 28 weeks tend to develop respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) immediately after birth.

 ?Just after her birth, we started a rescue therapy and surfactant was administered externally,? Ray said. This ensured that the baby doesn?t have a shortage of oxygen supply and has no respiratory problems. She was put on ventilation on the day of her birth itself,? he added.

 A number of intravenous drugs were administered but simultaneously, the child developed jaundice and had to be treated with photo-therapy and high doses of antibiotics. ?She had many complications, like passing blood through stool and later, septicaemia,? doctors said.

 The baby had required 25 units of fresh frozen plasma, three units of blood eight units of blood platelets for survival.

 The doctors said her mother, Sumitra, came with ruptured membrane and after one-and-a-half months in the hospital, she had a premature delivery. ?In such cases of premature ruptured membrane, the survival of the child is very risky,? said Ranjit Chakraborty, the gynaecologist who treated Sumitra.

 ?A day after her birth, the baby was a tiny clot of blood and I thought she wouldn?t survive. It was a month of sleepless nights for me and I had almost given up hope,? Sumitra said. However, a month after the birth, the child is ready to go back home. ?We are yet to choose a name for her,? her mother smiled.

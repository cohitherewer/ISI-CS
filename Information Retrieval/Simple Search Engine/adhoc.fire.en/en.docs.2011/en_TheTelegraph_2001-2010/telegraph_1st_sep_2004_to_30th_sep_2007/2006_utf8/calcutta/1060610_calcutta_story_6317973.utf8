 The third Left Front civic board has finally decided to get rid of the stillborn child of the first Left Front board ? Vidyasagar Mancha, on Sundari Mohan Avenue.

 The unfinished auditorium, that can seat 1,200 people, and an incomplete, six-storeyed commercial complex, both on the same campus, are up for sale at Rs 20 crore.

 ?Any private party can take it over on an as-is-where-is basis,? municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay announced. The sell-off proposal, mooted by mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya, was unanimously approved by his council members last week.

 Shoe-makers and other leather traders who ply their wares on the road in Padmapukur, causing traffic snarls, have been offered a 15 per cent discount on the price if they intend buying the auditorium and the commercial complex by forming an association or a cooperative.

 A similar discount will be offered to other parties, too, if they agree to run Vidyasagar Mancha as an auditorium. But if the buyer wants to use the structure for any other purpose, the non-negotiable price is Rs 20 crore.

 Before floating tenders, the authorities will spend Rs 20 lakh for installing a lift, providing water connection and setting up toilets.

 Work on Vidyasagar Mancha started in 1986, when the first Left Front board (1985-90), led by mayor Kamal Bose, decided to construct a community hall on a one-bigha civic plot on Sundari Mohan Avenue. The six-storeyed commercial complex was planned to make the project self-sustainable.

 After spending around Rs 1.2 crore on construction, the project was unofficially abandoned for dearth of funds.

 Though work never resumed in the past 20 years, the authorities had let out three floors of the commercial complex, each 5,000 sq ft, to a private firm. In 1998, a group of 40 hawkers, among those evicted during Operation Sunshine, was rehabilitated on the ground floor.

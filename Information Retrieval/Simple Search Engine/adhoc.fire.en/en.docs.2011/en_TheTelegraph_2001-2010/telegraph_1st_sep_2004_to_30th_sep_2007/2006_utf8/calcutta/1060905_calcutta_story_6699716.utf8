The cradle for clay idols will soon have a new address.

 The state government announced on Monday that Kumartuli would be shifted to a five-acre plot on Rabindra Sarani, 200 m from the present site, within a year and a half.

 The public health engineering and health departments jointly own a godown on the plot, which in a year will be developed into a residential area for the artisans.

 Around 350 artisans and 550 families live in Kumartuli. We will ensure no one is evicted during the shift. The plot on Rabindra Sarani is similar to the size of the present hub. So, we dont think there will be any space crunch once the people are shifted, urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya said on Monday.

 He discussed the issue during the day with member of Parliament Sudhanshu Sil, chief executive officer of Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority P.R. Baviskar and others. The project cost has been pegged at Rs 27 crore. Half of it will be provided by the Centre under the Jawaharlal Nehru Urban Renewal Mission and the rest by the state and the artisans. A committee has been set up to decide how much the artisans will have to pay.

 The most important job now is to vacate the godown and construct quarters for the artisans, so they can settle down there, said Sil. We have chalked out a detailed plan to reorganise Kumartuli.

 The government plans to introduce some modern facilities in the new hub and put in place the necessary safety measures. A fire station will be set up in the vicinity.

 We have decided to construct an archive where the artisans can preserve their works. The artisans can also keep there the statues and idols that have won them prizes and recognition abroad. We will also have dormitories for artisans coming from other countries, minister Bhattacharya signed off.

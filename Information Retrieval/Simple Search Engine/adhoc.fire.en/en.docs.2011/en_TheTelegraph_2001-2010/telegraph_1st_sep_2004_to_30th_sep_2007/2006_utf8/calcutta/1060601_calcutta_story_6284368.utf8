 It came, it saw and it conquered?The 

 kurtis journey into the wardrobe of an Indian 

 woman is history. The same woman who had hid herself long 

 in her saris and salwar suits finds it cool to buy 

 herself a pair of jeans, only to team it with a kurti. 

 Now the kurti is set for a makeover. Fashion is about the it silhouette and the seasons flavour is the tunic. Any resemblance to the kurti is certainly not co-incidental.

 The kurti suddenly became the coolest garment for youngsters and old alike. No other garment has liberalised Indian women so much, feels designer Sabyasachi Mukherjee. The tunic, like a kurti, is a hit because of its silhouette ? flattering yet not body-contouring, adds Sabyasachi. 

 Several designers are flirting with the sexy silhouette this summer. They include Kiran Uttam Ghosh, Meera and Muzaffar Ali, Anamika Khanna, Suneet Verma, Wendell Rodricks, Monapali, Nandita Mahtani to name a few.

 So wear it to work hard or dress it up to party harder. GoodLife tells you more about the tunic. 

 Back to basic 

 Originally a short, sleeveless dress worn by ancient Greeks and Romans, this straight, tubular garment has evolved since. Back then too, it was usually tied about the waist. 

 Style consultant and designer Sunipa Samadder traces the journey of the tunic. It appeared as a coat-like garment worn over long skirts and dresses in the 19th and early 20th century. Designers like Poiret used it too. The tunic shape again became fashionable in 1960s when they were layered with slightly longer versions, worn belted or unbelted over pants. 

 At a time when the waist is back in focus, the tunic could not be left far behind, says Sunipa. So enter multiple focal points in this fashion fiesta. 

 Choose from empire lines, fitted hour-glass shapes or low waists, the tunic will help you flaunt it all. 

 Cut to present and now this ancient western garment reeks of Indian influences in styling and embellishment. Worn tied with a belt, sash or cord to lend shape and length to the upper torso, the tunic seems here to stay. 

 Designer Agnimitra Paul attributes the comeback of the tunic to convenience because she feels it is a fantastic garment that is perfect to camouflage a paunch or broader hips. 

 She says: It essentially looks western but at the same time covers up like many other ethnic silhouettes. 

 By day

 The tunic can be the perfect answer to the boredom of wearing classic button-down shirts day in and day out. Not only does it look with it, it is also comfortable enough to carry you all day through. 

 Sunipa draws out the tunic style 

 file: 

 Choose 

 from fabrics like cotton, soft denim, linen and mul. 

 Add collars for a smart look. 

 The belts are narrower for the day, preferably attached.

 Team with linen pants, denims or pastel capris. 

 By night

 The tunic, says Sunipa, is also a perfectly stylish ensemble for after sundown. A tunic by itself is nothing. Team it right to create your distinct look, she suggests.

 The fabric choices could be endless when it comes to an evening tunic ? lace, net, printed chiffon or georgette? you can add a touch of naughtiness by lining your sheer tunic with an embellished inner.

 Here are some tips by Agnimitra 

 to jazz up the tunic, perfect to party in: 

 Embellish with chunky sequins.

 Concentrate on the lapels, collars and rim of the 

 pockets. 

 Play up the sleeves, flare them or style them. 

 Layer with a shrug. 

 The belt should be extremely funky. It completes 

 the glam look.

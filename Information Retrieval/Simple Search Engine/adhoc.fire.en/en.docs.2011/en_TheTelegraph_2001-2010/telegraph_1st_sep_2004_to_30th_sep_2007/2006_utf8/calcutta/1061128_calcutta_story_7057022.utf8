The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Life

 Muscle men, bikini babes

 Super-cool Hrithik, fall-flat 

 Abhishek, sexy-for-once Ash, body Bips and shirtless Uday... 

 Shradha Agarwal checks out the D:2 oomph 

 quotient 

 Hrithik 

 Roshan 

 Undoubtedly the best thing about Dhoom 2, Hrithik Roshan as Aryan, the perfect thief, manages to capture all eyes hers and his. Hrithik sizzles, much like Raj in Kaho Naa Pyar Hai. He is stylish, sexy and oh-so-natural.

 Theres a dash of hip-hop in the form of relaxed, 

 super-low denims. Something GeneratioNext can totally relate 

 with. (Thank god, he has ditched the fitted, mid-waist jeans.)

 There is ample influence of street wear tees under 

 shirts, casual scarves and camouflage prints.

 Thrown in amidst it all is a sprinkle of metrosexuality. 

 We love his comfort level in those daringly pretty pinks.

 Lakshya had taught him to experiment with his 

 mane and the ripple effect reaches Dhoom 2, in style. 

 Lots of volume, some natural waves and some more curls, 

 Hrithik has got it just right. 

 And finally, what a bod! He has never looked in better 

 shape. Men went green in the face as the women on their 

 arms couldnt stop drooling.

 Aishwarya 

 Rai

 She wanted to look different. She wanted to look sexy. And so she did, as Sunehri. If in Kajra re she got the oomph factor right with an Indian act, (gravity-defying lehnga and super-plunging choli), in D:2 she dares to bare the Western way. She does look hot, but 

 She forgot to pull in her breath in the first sexy scene. 

 Military shorts and teeny black sports bra-top is fine. 

 But hello, next time, can she please tuck in her tummy? 

 Convex abs is oh-so sloppy especially when Ash doesnt 

 have one. 

 Mini skirts make her long legs look longer; and her 

 cellulite more visible too!

 Otherwise, what she shows is great to see. Well-toned 

 and well-curved. We like the bikini tops and tiny tennis 

 skirts. All of it is very young, very cool and very, very 

 hip. 

 Her make-up is magical. The sun-kissed look, the creamy 

 blush, the smoky eyes in charcoal and aqua, her wild streaked 

 tresses And topping it all, her name-defining tan (Sunehri). 

 Ash is hot, but her kiss was cold (a liplock doesnt 

 mean you keep your own lips locked).

 Bipasha 

 Basu 

 Bipasha, as the Bose twins Shonali and Monali is all there. Lots of flesh flash amidst lots of sun and sand. Her weight issue had almost reached national-crisis status when both she and John in all their interviews reminded us just how hard she had worked on getting back her body. Now, after all that hype and weight-loss, something else is missing: her natural oomph appeal... 

 Cool cop Shonali has her look worked out, maybe to compensate 

 for the lack of a character-sketch. Drainpipe dark denims, 

 sporty vests and girlie blow-dried tresses The make-up 

 and accessories are bare and subtle, just like they should 

 be. 

 Beach-babe Monalis look is very with it, too. 

 Strings of beads in happy hues, red streaks in her hair 

 and a riot of rainbow colours on her striped bikini, dresses 

 and sarongs. 

 There was not a whiff of vulgarity, even in those they-end-before-they-start 

 numbers. When Bips says she wanted her D:2 look to 

 be sensual rather than sexual she knew what 

 she was getting at.

 But that doesnt mean shes not conscious 

 about her body. The spontaneity of Jism is missing 

 as she seems forever aware of the camera ogling her.

 The famous Bips body is back in shape. Just like her 

 modelling days. Maybe she should make a (re)run for the 

 ramp. With all that celeb status, exposure and grooming, 

 she would surely be a supermodel.

 Abhishek 

 Bachchan 

 Why, just why, did ABs baby do this film? Dhoom took him to all-new heights and sadly, in Dhoom 2 he almost sinks without a trace.

 He is looking like Hrithiks chauffeur, someone was heard saying at an INOX night show. Abhishek as Jai Dixit was all too awkward. His OTT (over the top) attitude comes a cropper against Hrithik the rage.

 Lots of black on one hand, lots of florals on the other. 

 A signature style statement was missing. And so conspicuously 

 covered. No body, no show?

 His stubble was all over the place. Firstly, there was 

 a continuity problem, and secondly it looked messy and way 

 too beardy to be cool.

 Okay, so cops can be well-dressed too. Can Jai Jr please 

 take some style tips from his father, the original Jai, 

 please?

 We miss his yellow, tinted shades from Dhoom. 

 Did John take them away, along with all the bikes?

 Uday 

 Chopra

 Mr Monster Muscle crosses the line of law this time and joins Jai Dixit as sub-inspector Ali in the big A Hrithik as Aryan chase. Maybe he should have picked up a tip or two from hottie Hrithik instead of blindly (and foolishly) chasing him around.

 Clothes and style all come later, the body has to be 

 drastically worked upon. With no film in hand, Uday is obviously 

 spending all his time in the gym, that too building up. 

 Maybe its time to change the trainer, for someone 

 who has heard of the lean look.

 The blue velvet suit and the ruffled shirt from Touch 

 me. Just not happening. 

 All said and done, at least he provides a few laughs. 

 Hes shirtless, but at best sweet.

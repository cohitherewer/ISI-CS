The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 At tethers 

 end at twin ends of town

 MOHUA DAS

 Book Unfair 

 One is in Bagbazar, the other 

 in Bijoygarh. One is 123 years old, the other just 25. The 

 libraries are separated by decades and miles but bound by 

 a common government grant of Rs 25,500 each and a common 

 fate of keeping precious book addresses in town alive 

 against all odds.

 So, while Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees 

 Book Fair is set to flourish on the Maidan yet again, two 

 book addresses at two ends of the town are engaged in a 

 fight to avert a fadeout.

 Both Bagbazar Reading Library 

 and Dipayan Library, in Bijoygarh, had started out as primary 

 library units sponsored by the state, before being upgraded 

 to town libraries in the 1980s, ranking in importance 

 next only to State Central Library and Kolkata Metropolitan 

 Library. The sorry state, of course, belies the status.

 Bagbazar Reading Library is a 

 dilapidated building with around 90,000 books and journals, 

 an acute space crunch and no money or infrastructure to 

 preserve its rare collection.

 The library, located at 2, KC 

 Bose Road, off Bhupen Bose Avenue, looks lost. This despite 

 having 1,100 members on its rolls and a strong demand for 

 books. Based on the readership and demand for books, we 

 got an additional grant of Rs 30,000 in 2004 and 2005. But 

 even thats not enough to meet the expenses. We need racks 

 and cabinets, says Anamika Pal Chowdhury, librarian, Bagbazar 

 Reading Library.

 With no tools for preservation 

 in sight, the library has recently shifted out a chunk of 

 its tomes to State Central Library for the content to be 

 transferred on compact discs.

 Dipayan Library, at 8/41, Bijoygarh, 

 is in a far worse shape, despite 7,000-odd books and 1,400-plus 

 members. 

 Forget tech tools of preservation, 

 the place does not even have a telephone. A library assistant 

 and a junior library attendant struggle to manage books 

 and readers.

 We got Rs 25,000 in 2004 and 

 2005 to buy text and career guidance books. We got an additional 

 Rs 15,000 in the past two years on the basis of the librarys 

 performance, which we used up in buying more books, says 

 Rajat Das, library assistant at Dipayan. Another Rs 15,000 

 would probably help us revive the library, renovate the 

 building and get more racks and cabinets. We overshoot our 

 budget on furniture, binding and preservation of books, 

 he explained.

 Going by the directorate of library 

 services rules, a town library should have four staff members 

 librarian, library assistant, daftari-cum-bookbinder 

 and a night watchman. 

 Dipayan has gone without a librarian, 

 a daftari-cum-bookbinder and a night guard for close 

 to two decades. And Bagbazar Reading Library has had no 

 night guard for a year.

 So much for books finding pride 

 of place in Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees Bengal.

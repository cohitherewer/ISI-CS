The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 A trip to the wild and back

 COUNTING SMILES: Calculating 

 multiple-digit problems was childs play for the participants 

 at a demonstrative session conducted by Abacus at Space 

 Circle on August 20. Picture by Sanat Kumar Sinha

 It was a tale of a carefree zebra, a psychotic lion, 

 a composed yet amiable hippopotamus and a panicking giraffe 

 all desperately in love with New York, so much so that 

 they were ready to give up anything to share their lives 

 with their human friends in the US city. 

 St James School, in association with The Telegraph in Schools (TTIS), presented Wild Unwild, an adaptation of the animated movie Madagascar, at Kala Mandir on August 26. The play was directed by Aniket Deb Roy, a former math teacher of St James School, now based in Dubai. The story is about four friends Marty, the zebra, Alex, the lion, Gloria, the hippopotamus, and Melman, the giraffe and their journey from a New York zoo to an island.

 On his birthday, Marty in an emotional outburst expresses the wish of getting back to the wild after three penguins suggest the idea to him. Alex, Gloria and Melman are taken aback at Martys desire, but follow him when he flees the zoo. Unfortunately, they get caught and sedated, and later find themselves on a ship, in wooden boxes. They land on a desolate island and are introduced to the new wild world there.

 It is a sudden encounter between the unwild and the wild and the four feel tense. Alex is appalled, especially at the spiders! Melman, a jumpy character, is traumatised and can hardly stop trembling. Only Marty seems excited.

They meet a bunch of monkeys and their vivacious 

self-proclaimed King Julien (picture left by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya). With 

time, the bunch of pansies, as Julien calls the four newcomers, become accustomed 

to the wilderness. But still, they decide to go back home to the New York zoo.

 The team of 40 managed to put up a coordinated performance despite rehearsing only for three weeks. Vikram Bhattacharya (the lively zebra) was a spirited dancer. And Rajatri Biswas (of La Martiniere for Girls, Class XI), the hippopotamus, was most popular with the crowd. Not to forget Lav Kanoi, the nerve-racked giraffe, who did not miss a single chance to slip and fall on his back with perfection.

 However, the star of the evening was the hip-shaking King Julien, Anubrata Basu, a Class XI student of St James School. Even the day before the performance we did not know our dialogues properly. My dance was mostly impromptu, said Anubrata.

 The music by Neel Adhikari and the choreography by Sylvester Mardi added to the lively performance. Most of the students who participated in the play were from St James, though there were a few from other schools as well. Then there were a few ex-students who flew down to the city just to be part of the project. I am studying in the UK and I have come down for the summer, and of course, to be a part of the play, said Navkaran Singh Bagga, a former student of the school who played the role of Alex, the lion.

 On August 26, The Academy of Animating 

 Arts and Technology held an animation film-making workshop, 

 conducted by ace animator Kireet Khurana, CEO of 2nZ Animations 

 (picture on right). The company had produced the 

 mini television series Chhota Birbal.

 Animation, according to Khurana, is emotion in motion. An animator has to be very creative while visualising the characters on celluloid. While comparing animation to film-making, Khurana pointed out that there were no re-takes in animation and that cartoons are only a part of it.

 The workshop included explanations on the history of animation and films, right from the silent era to the first animation film. Khurana told the students about the principles of classical animation such as stretch or squash, weight, inertia, drag, anticipation or reaction, follow through and the theories of ease-in and ease-out.

 On course

 The AICTE has approved the introduction of a three-year Master of Business Administration (MBA) Evening Programme at Heritage Institute of Technology from 2006. The course is affiliated to the West Bengal University of Technology and approved by the government of West Bengal.

 The programme was launched on the campus on August 17. Aloke Mookherjea, president, Bengal Chamber of Commerce, spoke on Globalisation and positioning of India at the function. He reflected on the various economic and social phases of India and the slow, but-sure influence of globalisation.

 He added that though India has the potential to grow, it cannot afford to follow the economy model of the US because of the huge population it accommodates in the relatively small area. Hence India should formulate a new economic policy if it wants to rule the world economy, he said.

 Media role

 Arin Ghosh, managing director of West Bengal Forest Development Board, addressed a group of students at JU on Medias role in environment preservation on August 12. The session was organised by the mass communication department of JU. Ghosh emphasised that the media should make people aware about the worth of a pollution-free environment.

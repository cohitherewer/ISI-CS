The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You cant 

 get through this week without 

 Clearing the clutter

 Diwali cleaning, therapeutic for 

 some, in a de-stressing sort of a way, stressful for others. 

 But then, you can love it, hate it but you just cannot ignore 

 it. The light and sound festival is round the corner and 

 its high time you rid your space (work and play) of 

 clutter. If youre painting the house, the junk is 

 taken care of but if youre giving the rang mistri 

 the skip this year, gear up for a marathon spring-clean 

 spree, and pronto. Soap the walls, wash the curtains and 

 dont forget the cupboards. You know the rule junk 

 anything you havent worn in the last two years.

 Reading Brick Lane

 Too serious for the festive season, 

 eh? But then, Monica Alis bestseller is now too close 

 for comfort for you to say Nazneen who (clue: she is the 

 protagonist of Brick Lane). If you missed the Metro 

 story, heres a ready reckoner. The filmi adaptation 

 of the book is coming to Calcutta soon, with director Sarah 

 Gavron set to recreate a bit of Bangladesh off the Bypass 

 and capture Nazeens childhood with local artistes. 

 If you dont manage to finish the book, make sure you 

 know three talking points: a) the filming in London had 

 to be shifted from Brick Lane to Chapel Street due to protests 

 from a section of Bangladeshis; b) this sparked a war of 

 words between Germaine Greer and Salman Rushdie; c) Tannishtha 

 Chatterjee (Bibar and Shadows of Time) plays 

 Nazneen.

 Seeing them dance

 The reality dance shows on TV 

 are really hotting up and that too for all the wrong reasons. 

 While Akashdeep Saigal has accused old flame and Jhalak 

 Dikhhla Ja judge Farah Khan for being unfair to him, 

 Nach Baliye judge Saroj Khan has been accused of 

 giving more points to Shweta Tiwari because of pressure 

 from the show producer. 

 Whatever be the reason, both the 

 shows, on Sony and STAR One, do pack quite a punch and if 

 you do not want to be left out of the fun, watch em 

 on Wednesday and Monday nights.

 Shopping for bro

 Hes been sweet. Hes 

 been naughty. But what the heck, Bhai Phonta is his day 

 all the way. Make it special for him. Cook you will, but 

 other than that, get the gift he so deserves. 

 A laptop bag, cool cargo pants, 

 his favourite cologne Or if ideas fail you, then gift 

 him a voucher from his favourite store. Go ahead, indulge 

 him once a year!

 You never know, maybe he will 

 decide to return the festive favour, soon.

 The 

 eastern zonal Balshree Selection Camp was organised by National 

 Bal Bhavan, New Delhi, at Nehru Childrens Museum on August 

 22 and 23. 

 The camp is a part of the Balshree Scheme that aims to identify, nurture and honour children, aged between nine and 16 years, with exceptional skills, under four categories creative art, creative performance, creative writing and creative scientific innovation.

 Under the scheme, the best of the lot are awarded the Balshree Honour by the President. The candidates are put through a rigorous three-tier selection procedure at the local, zonal and national levels.

 The zonal-level camps are the second level of the selection procedure the children who qualify at the local level participate in this camp. Some of the children are then handpicked to attend the national-level camp at New Delhi.

 At the two-day local camp in the city, the participants were expected to excel in more than one field. They were required to perform various activities, both individually and in groups. 

 A panel constantly scrutinised the participants and judged them on the basis of their originality, flexibility, elaboration and diversity of thought.

 This year the eastern zone camp drew children from all across eastern India.

 Clean cause

 The senior boys of Birla High Schools Nature Club recently undertook a cleanliness drive at the park at 1, Albert Road. The park had been neglected for long and the children wanted to draw the attention of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation to the issue.

 The park has a big waterbody with trees around it. Office buildings such as the British Council and Gorky Sadan are located in the vicinity of the park.

 The school children have named the park Green Dream Park and hope that their cleanliness drive has got their message across to mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya.

 They now eagerly await the Calcutta Municipal Corporation to take steps to beautify and maintain the park.

 Bengals bond

 Samalay, a centre for cultural exchange between the two Bengals, paid respect to Utpal Dutt, Tapas Sen and Gyanesh Mukherjee at a programme at the Government Circuit House recently.

 Actor Subhendu Chatterjee in his address recalled how his mentor Gyaneshda taught him the nuances of acting. 

 Bangladeshi dramatist Mamunur Rashid and theatre artiste Keyamat Molla were then felicitated. They acknowledged the contribution of Dutt and Sen to their countrys theatre.

 Sobha Sen also recounted how as a guru Dutt taught her everything about theatre. She was presented a memento by Samalay.

 Fact-free diet

 All hail the new Uncyclopedia, we said at the end of our 

 last column and we say it again. For too long have we been 

 brainwashed into believing that the formula of salt is sodium 

 chloride, that London is the capital of England and that 

 Shakespeare wrote Hamlet. Down with the tyranny of dull 

 and boring facts purveyed by dull and boring encyclopedias! 

 As Oscar Wilde infamously said, I am on a fact-free diet.

 Ok fine, Oscar didnt say it, just as he wasnt 

 responsible for the 3,000-odd quotes attributed to him in 

 the pages of Uncyclopedia, the content-free encyclopedia 

 that anyone can edit. 

 Originally intended as a parody of Wikipedia, which takes 

 its facts very, very seriously indeed, the Uncyclopedia 

 is equally serious about its complete and utter lack of 

 seriousness. Its articles are governed by a strict editorial 

 code of stupidity and pointlessness. Anyone failing to meet 

 its exacting standards is, of course, free to write for 

 Wikipedia.

 Examples: yesterdays News page of the Unc informs 

 us that 8 September is International Precision Day and that 

 on this day in 1985, plurals were banned in the Netherland 

 (formerly known as the Netherlands). We are introduced to 

 a new hand-held gadget called the Pontius Pilot and are 

 solemnly informed that your sister caused the Zidane 

 headbutt. We are further reminded that JPEG stands 

 for Japanese Porn Erotic Graphic and that god created Finland 

 as a test of masculinity.

 But for more substantial fare, one should go to the articles, 

 of which there are exactly 18,485 in English at the time 

 of writing. Certain themes recur, such as the country called 

 Poland, Geoffrey Boycotts grandmother and random quotes 

 by Mr Wilde. Examples: He was a hack, and a drunkard, 

 and stole my stuffed penguin! (on Shakespeare), What 

 a nice bloke! (on Harry Potter), and He is a 

 man I greatly admire (on himself). But even the great 

 Oscar is reduced to silence when it comes to Geoffrey Boycotts 

 grandmother who is described as one of the all-time cricketing 

 greats, leading her nation to over 130 test victories in 

 a career spanning over 50 years. She scored 45,022 Test 

 runs but her average could not be calculated due to the 

 lack of a calculator.

 One could go on and on but I will only restrict myself 

 to the article titled Causes of Death of English Cricket 

 Captains. Did you know that Tony Lewis was trampled 

 under the drinks cart (nobody noticed) and Colin Cowdrey 

 was bored to death watching Boycott bat? Or that Mike Brearley 

 was deemed as too crap to live by the ECB and 

 terminated on his 40th birthday? Or that Andrew Strauss 

 was mistaken for Johan Strauss by an enraged punk and battered 

 with a guitar? You didnt? Then go to http://uncyclopedia.org/wiki/Causes_of_Death_of_English_Test_Match_Captains 

 and find out. And may the farce be with you!

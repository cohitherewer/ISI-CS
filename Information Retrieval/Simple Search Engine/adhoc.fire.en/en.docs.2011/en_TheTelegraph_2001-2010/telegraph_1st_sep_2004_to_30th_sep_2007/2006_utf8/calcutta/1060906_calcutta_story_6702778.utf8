 Ethnic synthesis

 In the context of modern Indian art, the term folk refers to the artistic expressions of rural people, who create beauty from a collective consciousness, out of their inherent, natural sensibilities. Modern art, as it has evolved over the last 100 years, has consistently made attempts to synthesise and assimilate folk elements in paintings with contemporary themes. Folk in Modern, the ongoing exhibition of paintings, is an effort to trace and locate the nature of this synthesis. A decorative, formal treatment of folk by artists of the pre-Independence era gave way to a more deep-rooted and subtle attitude to it during the 1960s. Gradually, folk forms came to be used in works with urban subjects, often building a modernist identity from an entirely rural ethos. Such experiments created a vibrant and poignant space, further extended by artists of subsequent generations. Participating artists: M.F. Husain, K.G. Subramanyam (a painting by him appears above), Haku Shah, Sanat Kar, Ramananda Bandyopadhyay, P.R. Narvekar, Biswapati Maity and Jogen Chowdhury, among others.

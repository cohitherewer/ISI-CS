 Monitor panel for New Town fringe

 - PLOY TO FOB OFF LAND SHARKS

 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE

 A development authority has been formed to check the free run of land sharks in the areas adjoining New Town.

 The 10-member Bhangar-Rajarhat Development Authority, headed by former Left Front chief whip in the Assembly Rabin Mondol, will monitor land use and infrastructure development within a km around the township on the eastern fringes of the city.

 Other members of the authority ? to function from a two-storeyed building in New Town ? will include the district magistrates of North and South 24-Parganas; engineers and town planners; and representatives of Hidco, the public health engineering department and local bodies.

 ?No land can be sold in the peripheral areas and no construction, private or government, will be allowed without the authority?s approval,? said R.K. Tripathi, managing director of Hidco, the implementing agency of the township.

 ?Each and every plan in the peripheral areas of Rajarhat and Bhangar, ranging from building a house to sinking a tubewell or laying a sewage line, will have to be cleared by the authority,? he added.

 The emergence of New Town, which promises to have all modern infrastructure and amenities, has set promoters on the prowl, eager to cash in on the spin-offs on the fringes. Already, the cost of land on the peripheries has shot up tenfold. 

 Several large chunks of land have been grabbed and buildings and shops have started coming up in an unplanned way.

 ?We do not have any intention of resisting owners from using their land as they wish. But we want the development to be planned. Unplanned activities in the adjoining areas will affect New Town?s master plan,? said housing minister and Hidco chairman Deb.

 The authority, he stressed, has been formed for the benefit of the people living close to the township. ?We are in the process of preparing a master plan for a comprehensive development of the peripheries.?

 In May 2005, Hidco had appointed a 12-member committee, headed by former IIT Kharagpur professor and planning adviser to the state government R.L. Muni Chakraborty, to recommend on land use and development patterns on the New Town fringes.

 The committee had suggested a 25-year master plan and strict monitoring of land use. ?We had made it clear that a lack of restrictions and a carte blanche to promoters would result in a collapse of the New Town infrastructure. People both in the township and the adjoining areas will suffer,? warned Muni Chakraborty.

 ?Some promoters had grabbed vast tracts on either side of VIP Road, along Kestopur canal, which forms the boundary of Salt Lake, and converted them into concrete jungles. No provision has been made for sewerage, drainage or drinking water supply. We should learn from the disaster and avoid a repeat around New Town,? he pointed out.

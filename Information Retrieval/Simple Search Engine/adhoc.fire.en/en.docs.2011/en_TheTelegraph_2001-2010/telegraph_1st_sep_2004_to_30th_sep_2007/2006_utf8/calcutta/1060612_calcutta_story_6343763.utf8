The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

On amp; Off

Bebo?s getting it right

Screen On amp; Off

 crazy comedy: Cyrus Broacha, host of Bakra

 It seems Kareena Kapoor?s jinx at the box-office is finally beginning to break. The actress, who has hardly scored a hit barring a Mujhe Kucch Kehna Hai and the multistarrer K3G, has delivered to some extent with real-life beau Shahid Kapur in Abbas-Mustan?s 36, China Town. The film has done very well in Mumbai and average business in the other metros.

 And now she is earning kudos for her role in Chup Chup Ke where she drops her fiery image to play a simple mute girl. Kareena has even singled out the two reasons why she enjoyed doing the Priyadarshan film. ?It was a challenge to play this role because I had to emote purely through sign language and expressions, and secondly for the first time in my career I didn?t have to go for dubbing!? she is all smiles.

 The word doing the rounds is that Kareena has also patched up with Karan Johar. The two had fallen out during the casting of Johar?s production Kal Ho Naa Ho. But now all is well and she may well be in the running for a plum role in Soham?s next after Kaal, to be produced by Johar.

 From MTV, Bakra has now hopped on to Nick, the TV channel for kids. The popular hidden camera comedy show will feature on Nick?s popular Nick Hahaha comedy block. The Bakra episodes on Nick, chosen from the existing library, have already run on MTV over the last few years.

 Hema Govindan, vice-president and general manager Nick India, says, ?Bakra, whose popularity transcends all ages, will be a valuable addition to our already laugh-riotous block which also includes Kenan amp; Kel, Drake amp; Josh and Laurel amp; Hardy.?

 So get ready as host Cyrus Broacha and his team put regular junta through strange situations with hilarious results. Bakra on Nick will air every weekday at 6.30 pm, with a repeat at 9.30 pm and one-hour specials at 4 pm on weekends.

 Calcutta?s second multiplex celebrates its second anniversary this month. Come June 18 and INOX (City Centre) turns two. To celebrate its filmi journey in the city, the multiplex has lined up a host of activities this week.

 Every cine goer who visits the Salt Lake multiplex during the anniversary celebrations stands a chance to win lots of prizes. Hundred tickets are up for grabs every day ? when you buy three tickets, you get one free on a first-come-first-served basis.

 In addition, radio listeners can win tickets through a contest run exclusively on Red FM. Also, one lucky winner gets a chance, every evening of the week, to hitch a holiday ride to various picturesque destinations in India, courtesy Club Mahindra.

 Patrons sharing the same birth date as INOX (City Centre), June 18, can also win tickets during the anniversary week by furnishing proof of their date of birth!

 But the clincher comes on B?day. On June 18, patrons visiting the four-screen multiplex will be treated to a glass of sparkling wine, courtesy Chateau Indage.

 Reasons enough to catch a movie this week at INOX (City Centre)?

 After the best singer and the best actor, the search is now on for the craziest movie buff. Sabse Bada Deewana by SET MAX is trying to find the one filmi fanatic who can go to the most extreme length to show his love for movies.

 ?It comes from the concept of our channel ? deewana bana de,? Albert Almeida, executive vice-president and business head of MAX, told Metro. ?We will travel to six cities and do an audition to find out the craziest of them all.?

 Sajid Khan, a huge movie buff himself, will handpick six deewanas from the six cities before they are put up for junta SMS voting. While all the finalists get home theatre systems to watch movies better, the winner will get free tickets for the next five years at a screen near him or her. And yes, Calcutta is one of the search cities.

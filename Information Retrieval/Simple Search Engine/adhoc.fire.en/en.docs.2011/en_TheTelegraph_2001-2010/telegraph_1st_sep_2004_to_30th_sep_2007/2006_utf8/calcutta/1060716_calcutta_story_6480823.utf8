The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Messenger of jazz music

 - Madhav Chari tunes into town

 His academic training is in math 

 (Dartmouth College and the University of Illinois, USA) 

 and his thinking about jazz is ?cutting-edge?. At 39, Madhav 

 Chari is arguably the country?s greatest jazz pianist-musician-composer, 

 and one of India?s strongest figures in the international 

 music world. His philosophy remains simple: use jazz music 

 as a template and reach out with an interdisciplinary viewpoint.

 Chari, who started the first-ever 

 jazz and modern music outreach programme in India with his 

 hometown Chennai as the focus in 2004, is keen to replicate 

 the project in Calcutta, where he spent the first 19 years 

 of his life. ?Jazz music was too niche even 40 years ago, 

 and this interdisciplinary model is aimed at touching a 

 wider audience,? he explains. The various venues/platforms 

 for the outreach programme are Montessori schools (?I even 

 teach the kids African polyrhythms?), colleges and institutions, 

 performances and lecture demos/workshops.

 This is also the ?most comprehensive 

 music outreach programme within India?, integrating multiple 

 disciplines and viewpoints, even using music as a ?unique 

 pathway? to understand creativity. Corporate and institutional 

 sponsorship willing, the virtuoso pianist is confident he 

 can bring this interdisciplinary-viewpoint project to Calcutta, 

 which ?has the cutting edge because of its egalitarian perspective?.

 Chari feels Calcutta has an ?amazing? 

 talent pool and a ?most discerning? music audience. ?All 

 it needs is an intense window like we have with the Carnatic 

 music fest in Chennai, where all the energy can be focused 

 into one high-octane frame. It has put Chennai on the world 

 music-tourism map and a structured effort can do likewise 

 with Calcutta,? he says.

 ?Both Chennai and Calcutta have 

 international cultural profiles and perspectives, but not 

 even one-tenth of the collective potential of both the cities 

 has been exploited. By linking music with diverse disciplines 

 and elements like dance, storytelling, creativity, cognition, 

 spirituality, architecture, history or intellect, we can 

 develop a common language and achieve a powerful connect,? 

 he adds.

 Chari has studied and interacted 

 musically with six-time Grammy nominee Kenny Barron, saxophonist 

 composer Henry Threadgill, and more recently with multiple 

 Grammy-winning and Pulitzer Prize-winning jazz composer 

 Wynton Marsalis. He has performed extensively abroad, working 

 with jazz legends Max Roach, Lester Bowie, Ed Thigpen (who 

 was Oscar Peterson?s drummer in the early 60s), saxophonist-composer 

 Chico Freeman and Grammy winners Carlos Gomez and David 

 Murray. ?Music has to be a healing therapy, and for that 

 to happen the form must come from a high consciousness, 

 delivered with high energy that comes from within, like 

 a Coltrane or a Vilayat Khan,? stresses Chari, who is working 

 on a book on music and consciousness.

 The jazz artiste is scheduled 

 to return to the city at least thrice this year, following 

 his Friday evening solo recital of Duke Ellington?s works 

 at the Calcutta School of Music. The Madhav Chari Trio (also 

 featuring Adrian D? Souza on drums and Karl Peters on guitars) 

 will perform at Someplace Else on August 5. ?I?ll come back 

 in end-August for a WorldSpace project at Gyan Manch where 

 I?ll demonstrate the deep connect between language and music,? 

 he declares. In October, he will perform in Calcutta again 

 as part of a pan-India tour with a jazz group from France 

 presented by the French ministry of culture, followed by 

 a live CD recording of the group performing in Paris.

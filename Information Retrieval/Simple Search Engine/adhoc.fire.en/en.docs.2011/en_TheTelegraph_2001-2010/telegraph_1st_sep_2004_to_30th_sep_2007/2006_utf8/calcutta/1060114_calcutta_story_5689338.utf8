 Board status raises brows 

 - Court joins students in debate over shift in JEE test pattern

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Can the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) board take policy decisions without being a statutory body? The question, earlier asked by students, has now been raised by Calcutta High Court.

 Formed in 1962 by a government order, the board came close to becoming a statutory body in the 1990s, when the then JEE authorities prepared a draft proposal for the government?s approval. But the Left Front government, desperate to retain its grip over the board, turned it down.

 The issue cropped up again recently when a group of students moved court against the board?s decision to change its question pattern from the ?broad intensive? to ?multiple choice? type.

 ?Without being a statutory body, the board cannot make such policy changes, even in regard to the question pattern. That is why we have filed a case against the board,? said Alauddin Mondol, who is appearing for the students, along with Apu Biswas and S.M. Ismail. ?We have raised 22 questions, including the legal status of many important posts in the board,? added Biswas.

 The matter came up for hearing a few weeks ago and Justice Kalyan Jyoti Sengupta had asked the board to file a reply. ?It has done so, but is silent on the issue of the statute,? Mondol pointed out.

 Late last year, the JEE board had announced the change in the question pattern, to be effective from this year, to make the test more competitive and enable students from Bengal to excel in similar exams outside. But as only a few months were left before the test, students and the guardians lodged protests.

 ?There is no proper test paper and the Higher Secondary textbooks are of no help. Before changing the question pattern, the board should have effected sweeping changes in the education system,? said Anumesh Chatterjee, the father of a student preparing for JEE 2006. Over a lakh students will sit for the exams; around 30,000 from the city alone.

 JEE officials are reluctant to comment on the issue. ?It has taken such an ugly turn that I do not wish to comment at all,? said board registrar P. Kar.

 Red signal to bandh call

 Todays question: What should be done to tackle bandhs? More responses will be published next week

 No entry : Party flags show the red light to life on a bandh day

 Saptagram, Birati 

 We should ostracise the political parties as well as the leaders by boycotting elections. People should come forward and speak against frequent political bandhs. Political parties often call bandhs to protest against policy, decision or project proposed by the administration. But bandhs should be used only as the last resort. They paralyse business, schools, offices and our daily routine. 

 Swarik Das, 

 Park Street

 Dictatorship is the only solution to tackle bandhs in our country. Bandhs are mere pastimes for political leaders in the name of democracy. It seems that India is under the attack of a bandh virus. Everyone calls a bandh on any issue under the sun.

 Prahlad Agarwala, 

 Majdia, Nadia

 The Supreme Court should ban the concept of political bandhs. Mahatama Gandhi used bandhs to free our country. But today, they disrupt our daily routines and work suffers. The government should try other alternatives before taking such an extreme step. 

 Kanai Saha,

 Gauri Bari Lane 

 Mass awareness about our rights is the best way to tackle bandhs. In addition, the government should ensure that emergency services like medicine, hospital and transport facilities will not be withdrawn at any cost. The government should also beef up the security to avoid any untoward incident. 

 P. Pramanik, 

 Santoshpur Avenue

 Bandhs should be tackled through discussion and dialogue. If two political parties fight on a matter, a neutral party should intervene and try to find a way out. Bandhs should be the last resort, only if nothing works out. 

 Debabrata Paul,

 Anupama Housing

 There is no way that we can do away with bandhs. But we can take steps so that our work doesnt suffer. After a bandh, working hours at all offices should be doubled for a day or employees should work on holidays to overcome the loss. 

 Mohammed Zakaria,

 Imdad Ali Lane

 A strict law should be introduced to tackle political bandhs. There should be some guidelines for calling a bandh, which all parties must follow. Also, the political parties should think of a peaceful alternative to protest without disturbing our routines.

 Debaprasad Bhatta, 

 Sonarpur

 To tackle bandhs, all parties should come forward and form a common platform to solve the problem. We should think of developing our state. Bandhs obstruct the development process.

 Kajal Chatterjee, 

 Sodepur

 Offices, banks and hospitals should be kept open and workers should be encouraged to go to their workplaces. To dissuade workers from bunking office, steps like salary deduction should be adopted. Extra security should be given on bandh days to encourage private buses, autorickshaws, cinema halls and shopping centres to work peacefully.

 D. Chakroborty, 

 Cossipore

 People should come forward fearlessly to defy bandhs. The Supreme Court should ban bandhs. Protesters should be arrested and put behind bars. 

 Mohammad Ayub, 

 Bright Street

 The apex court should ban bandhs. Then, the government and police should help in implementing this rule. People should also come forward and defy bandhs. Proper security measures should be adopted on bandh days. Such disruptions obstruct the development process of a state and even the country.

 Rathin Chatterjee,

 Dum Dum

 The best way to tackle bandhs is to ignore them. I dont support bandhs. And many others will echo my sentiments. So, the government should try to solve problems and opt for other peaceful alternatives.

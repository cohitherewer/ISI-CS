 Death sparks mob fury at clinic

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A mob went on a rampage after a patient, Mrinal Mullick, 23, admitted three days earlier in Ekbalpur Nursing Home at 9, Ibrahim Road, died on Sunday morning.

 Alleging that medical negligence was responsible for the death, the mob comprising relatives of the deceased and some local residents ransacked the office, damaged furniture and assaulted doctors. However, no one was arrested.

 According to police, the youth was admitted with serious illness. ?After his condition deteriorated on Sunday the doctors told his relatives that he would have to be put on a ventilator-system,? said an officer of Ekbalpore police station. 

 ?But he expired while he was being shifted to the unit. Doctors announced his death to his relatives and said they hardly got any chance to treat the patient,? he added.

 Relatives of the deceased refused to buy that story. ?They blamed the nursing home staff and doctors for not taking care of the patient,? said the officer. 

 ?The situation worsened when the nursing home authorities asked relatives of the deceased to pay the treatment cost before taking the body. Local people, too, were angered by the demand and they raised their voices against the doctors alleging negligence on the part of the nursing home authorities,? he added.

 A 50-strong mob stormed into the office of the nursing home. ?Before entering the building of the nursing home, they threw stones and smashed the window-panes. Scared employees of the nursing home had no option but to flee or silently witness the rampage,? said another officer who rushed to the spot.

 The mob then entered the main office. ?Initially, some of the doctors and nursing home staff tried to resist the angry group by blocking the main gate. A scuffle ensued. They assaulted a doctor who had treated the deceased,? the officer stated.

 Once they were inside, the mob barged into the office and ransacked it. They damaged the chairs, tables and other office furniture.

 All the bulbs and tube-lights inside the room were smashed. They continued for over 15 minutes. 

 The situation was brought under control after the local councillor Faiyaz Ahmed Khan intervened. Those involved in the ransacking had fled by then.

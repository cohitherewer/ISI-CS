 SANJAY MANDAL

 State-run teaching hospitals in the city are set for a major revamp.

 The health department has sanctioned several crores for adding facilities to four medical colleges in Calcutta. The institutes will have full-fledged neonatal care departments with Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) and Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU).

 Indoor departments with advanced facilities will also be set up for treating psychiatric patients.

 The four institutes awaiting an upgrade are RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, Medical College and Hospital, NRS Medical College and Hospital and National Medical College and Hospital.

 The health department has also okayed funds for NICU and PICU at BC Roy Memorial Hospital for Children.

 Sources said around Rs 1 crore has been sanctioned for each hospital to set up the NICU and PICU.

 The plans have been sanctioned and the departments will be operational soon. Advanced gadgets will be installed in these departments, said Jayasree Mitra, director of medical education.

 According to a health department official, most state-run hospitals have level-2 intensive care units for newborns. NICU and PICU will have level-3 facilities, such as ventilators, the official said.

 With these facilities, even newborns weighing less than 1200 grams can be treated properly, the official pointed out. SSKM is the only state-run hospital to have a full-fledged neonatal department.

 Along with NICU and PICU, the hospitals will have facilities for complete psychiatric treatment. The most advanced treatment and diagnosis will be available. Dedicated beds will be available for children, director of medical education Mitra said. 

 According to officials, around Rs 50 lakh has been sanctioned for each hospital to set up the facility.

 Besides the scheduled upgrade, RG Kar is having another facelift. The gastroenterology unit is being expanded. It will have more doctors and better facilities, a hospital official said.

 Four operating theatres of the hospital are also being renovated at a cost of Rs 1 crore. The OTs were in a bad shape and needed immediate uplift, said an official. Once the revamped OTs are operational, the hospital plans to set up an Intensive Therapy Unit for critical care treatment.

 Predictmeter 

 Even before Lage Raho Munnabhai has hit theatres, a study suggests that the Sanjay Dutt-Arshad Warsi-starrer will be the biggest hit of 2006. 

 The Euro RSCG Predictameter is a forecasting tool that aims at providing insights into any given category. Euro RSCG has used this tool to predict the fate of 18 of the top-draw Bollywood movies to be released later this year.

 An official communiqu stated: Critical to the science of predicting the future are a set of people who Euro RSCG calls prosumers. Prosumers are special customers who are more knowledgeable in a given category. They love new products, search for the best valued products and are very demanding. But most of all, prosumers love sharing their knowledge.

 According to the Euro RSCG Bollywood Predictameter, the Munnabhai MBBS sequel is slated to be the most successful movie of the year. Close to 61 per cent of the prosumers indicated that Munna and Circuit would earn superhit status with the movie.

 But the other Sanjay Dutt-Arshad Warsi caper Anthony Kaun Hai? will not really get the cash registers ringing as 57 per cent believe it will be an average grosser.

 With 36 per cent of prosumers indicating that Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna would be a super hit, but a distant second to Munnabhai.

 Even before their release, much-awaited 

 Bollywood flicks like Don (in picture), Umrao 

 Jaan and Dhoom 2 have been written off as miserable 

 flops according to the Predictameter. The study that had 

 stated how The Killer would make bigger bucks than 

 Naseeruddin Shahs directorial debut, Yun Hota Toh Kya 

 Hota, has been proved right on that count at least. 

 Close to 57 per cent of the prosumers have indicated that both Don and Dhoom 2 would be stupendous flops. The novelty value for the products does not exist at all, according to the prosumers. 

 The new Rajshri venture, Vivaah slated for November and starring Shahid Kapur and Amrita Rao does not make a mark with 61 per cent prosumers having no opinion about the movie.

 The Euro RSCG Bollywood Predictameter is the first ever attempt at successfully measuring the influence of marketing and buzz on the fate of a film. It based its results on a research conducted in four important markets Mumbai, Delhi, Lucknow and Bangalore administered across 1,200 respondents exposed to critical information about the films.

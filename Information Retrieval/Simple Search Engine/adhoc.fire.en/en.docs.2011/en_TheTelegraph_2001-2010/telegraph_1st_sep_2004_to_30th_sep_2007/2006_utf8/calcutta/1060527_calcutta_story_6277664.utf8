 Nature know-how

 A photography show on wildlife 

 was put up on the premises of Birla Industrial and Technological 

 Museum on May 22 to mark World Biodiversity Day. Slide shows 

 on various species of fauna were shown before an open discussion. 

 Questions on the decline in the vulture population, filling 

 of wetlands, greening of Calcutta and more were answered 

 by a panel of experts. Cherub of the Mist, a film 

 on the Red Pandas of the Singalila national park and Sikkim 

 was screened.

 Some very interesting facts about West Bengal?s wildlife were brought to light through a multimedia presentation by Aranyak. Our state comprises 11.19 per cent of the country?s fauna and more than 500 species of birds are found here. We would love to attend more such events where we come to know about nature and all its glory.

 Filmi funda

 Reading Films, the annual film 

 appreciation course organised by the Seagull Arts and Media 

 Resource Centre, began on May 9 and will continue till June 

 10. Between 2 pm and 6 pm, a large group of film aficionados 

 gather at the SP Mukherjee Road address for discussions 

 on cinema.

 Films are being treated as texts at the workshops, with the help of screenings, illustrated lectures and interactive discussions. Readings materials, exercises, an introduction to the history of cinema and its different genres are exposing the participants to the entire range of cinema, from classics to documentaries, popular media, animation and experimental films.

 The course aims to develop the analytical abilities of the participants in looking at film from various angles.

 Abuse alert

 An awareness programme on child 

 rights and abuse was organised by the NGO Prayas for fourth-year 

 students of South Calcutta Law College last month. Three 

 persons from the NGO conducted the programme which commenced 

 with a discussion on the basic rights of a child. Cases 

 from real life were cited where children have been brutally 

 abused, both physically and mentally, by child traffickers 

 and employers.

 A questionnaire was distributed among us to measure our awareness on the issue. The questions ranged from personal details to experiences of abuse, if any.

 Overall, the programme stressed on awareness of the prevalence of the problem, laws against child abuse and the scope of their enforcement.

 In a trance

 He who sleeps, awaken him

 He who is wide awake, put him to sleep

 For he is not awake,

 but only under the trance 

 of open eyes

 and the trance of the pendulum

 moving your tongue forever

 in the vacuum?

 He who sleeps, awaken

 capsules of light

 play between the dust

 the fire casts its shadow

 on the wall

 and the seagull cuts the twilight

 but the motor starts again,

 talking to the weak bones

 Bones that never saw the secret moon

 and the motion of the bus

 through the streets of men

 throws up an amoeboid dream?

 He who is awake, sleep

 and let the sleep be broken

 only by the seagull?s cry?

 Chit Chat

 Metal movement

 Reaching music to the masses in Calcutta means the language must be Bangla and talking about social issues means the sound should be loud. That?s the logic behind Calcutta?s ?first heavy metal band?, Rikterscale.

 The two-and-a-half-year-old line-up of Saurav on vocals, Abhishek and Siddharth on guitar, Aakash on bass, Amit on keyboards and Romie on drums, is a regular on the college and university circuit, playing a blend of original compositions and covers.

 ?We talk about social issues through our songs. The words have to come out with power. Metal means power,? says 24-year-old Abhishek.

 Rikterscale started out in 1999 as Charondal with a repertoire of ?love ballads and pop rock numbers?. After a different line-up and image makeover, Rikterscale was born in 2003.

 ?Man causes so much destruction in this world. An earthquake is God?s revenge on man and a Richter scale measures that,? offers Abhishek who came up with the name.

 Rikterscale counts among its influences groups like Iron Maiden, Pantera and Children of Bodom.

 The band has already released an album of original tunes called Reincarnation. Shantibongo talks about a state under political turmoil, Bhoy deals with the internal conflicts of man, while Ostityo highlights the identity crisis we face every day.

 ?The album sold well initially, particularly in the Northeast,? says Abhishek.

 A music video of Jago is up next. A new batch of compositions is also ready to be recorded and released.

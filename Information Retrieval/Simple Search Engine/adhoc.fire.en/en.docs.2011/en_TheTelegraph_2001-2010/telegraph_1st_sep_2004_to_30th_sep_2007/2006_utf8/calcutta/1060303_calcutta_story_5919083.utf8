 Mumbai duo held by cops 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 This morning, when the three arrived from Mumbai, they had resolved to make some fast money by picking pockets and lifting items before returning to Maharashtra. But the cops proved smarter. 

 Officers of the detective department nabbed two of them even before they could actually get into the act of lifting bags and other valuables from a multi-storeyed market off Burrabazar. The third, however, managed to escape.

 The incident took place around 1.30 on Thursday afternoon on the first floor of Mehta Building, on Canning Street, sending customers and shops-owners into a tizzy. 

 While Rafiq, in his mid-30s, managed to give cops the slip, the two others, Ravi Kishan and Selim Sheikh, alias Munna, were rounded up for their suspicious movements after half-an-hour. Of the two, Munna had made a last-ditch attempt to run away by jumping from the first floor of the building but ended up hurting his leg. He was rushed to a local hospital and later handed back to the police. 

 ?So far, we have gathered that all of them are residents of Kasar, in Maharashtra, and had hit the city with the sole aim of lifting precious items and valuables from shops. We are trying to trace the third to get a detailed picture,? said Gyanwant Singh, city detective chief.

 The detective department suspect the trio has strong city contacts and may have links with another Maharashtra-based gang that had earlier hit the city and snatched Rs 50,000 from two customers on Park Street and Camac Street.

 Surgery for baby vision

 SANJAY MANDAL

 She was born in a remote village in north Bengal with a layer of skin over her eyes, instead of eyelids. The threat of blindness loomed large, till plastic surgery brought a ray of hope into her life.

 It was a traumatic experience for us. We told the doctors that if they could not somehow make my daughter see, we would leave her at the hospital, mother Eshma Tara recalled the reaction of the family after she gave birth on July 14 this year. 

 The baby was first taken to Institute of Child Health in the city, where doctors diagnosed that she was suffering from cryptopthalmia, a rare disorder in which the eyeballs are formed, but the openings of the eyes are absent. After several examinations, doctors concluded that the babys eyes were functioning properly under the layer of skin. 

 A CT scan and ultrasonography confirmed that the eyeballs were present, as were the muscles of the eyes. But the eyes were hidden underneath a thick membrane, consisting of skin and other tissues, preventing vision. 

 For cryptopthalmia patients, the eye must be exposed to light within three months of birth, said plastic surgeon Manoj Khanna, who, along with a team of doctors, performed the surgery that gave the baby eyelids.

 In these cases, the macula (the centre of the eye, where vision is perceived) does not develop, leading to blindness, the doctor explained. 

 The surgery was performed a few days ago. The incision was made in such a way that the upper and lower eyelids were created from the covering over the eyes, said Khanna. 

 The baby can now move her eyeballs, but still lacks the muscles to open and close the eyes. Reconstruction will have to be carried out to develop the muscles to open and close the eyes. It is important to prevent undue damage to the eyes, added the doctor. 

 The eye surgeons will be monitoring the developments. The chances of preserving the babys vision, if any, have increased manifold, said Sasanka Chatterjee, associate professor, department of plastic surgery, SSKM Hospital and a member of the surgical team.

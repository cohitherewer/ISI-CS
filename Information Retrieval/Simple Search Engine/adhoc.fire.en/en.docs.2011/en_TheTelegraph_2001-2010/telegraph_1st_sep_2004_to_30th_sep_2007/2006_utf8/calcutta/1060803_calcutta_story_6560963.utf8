The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Enter, the Xbox experience

 - Microsoft to put gaming console on retail racks before Diwali 

 BISWARUP GOOPTU AND ZEESHAN JAWED

 Microsofts Xbox gaming console

 Gamers can look forward to a great Diwali. For, Calcutta will be part of a seven-city, pre-Diwali roll-out of the latest version of Microsofts popular gaming console, Xbox, in India. This will be first time the gadget will be available on the retail racks in this part of the world.

 A gaming console is a specialised desktop computer dedicated to games and entertainment. The hardware is generally proprietary and software is available separately. 

 Its great news. Xbox 360 is the seventh generation of the device and supposed to be better than the options we have right now. It has some great titles, like Halo, and Im just looking forward to it, said Rishi Nathany, a hardcore gamer.

 With significant demand in the market, Mohit Anand, country manager (entertainment and devices division), Microsoft India, is bullish about Xboxs prospects. 

 We expect Calcutta to act as gateway to the so-far unexplored and potentially-lucrative Northeast. The gaming market here is still not well-defined; its a great opportunity for Xbox to make a mark, he explained.

 Microsoft is the first company to formally launch gaming consoles in India. Its main global competitor, Sony (Playstation), is slated to follow suit. 

 The Redmond giant has tied up with Redington for the distribution of the consoles in the country. In Calcutta, the company is targeting 150 retail stores from supermarkets and hypermarts to standalone shops. It will also set up 1,000 demo kiosks for a first-hand feel of the Xbox experience. 

 Estimates suggest India has around 1.6 million gamers. Mumbai and Hyderabad are the gaming hotspots, but Calcutta is fast catching up. The market is growing at 100 per cent annually, and Calcutta contributes about six to seven per cent to nationwide sales. These are good numbers and we expect them to grow steadily, stated Anand. 

 The retail establishment is happy with the entry of the gaming console into the local market. Microsoft and Sony are continuously upgrading their gaming devices. In this combat, it is the consumers who stand to gain, observed Gautam Jatia, CEO, Landmark.

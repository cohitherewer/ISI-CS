The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 German biz team recce this week

 SUBHRO SAHA

 Before the state?s crack IT squad embarks for CeBIT to sell Sector V and more to the world, and ahead of the international industry fair in Hannover in April where India is the partner country, a huge boost for Brand Bengal is in the offing this week.

 A 45-member German business delegation, the largest ever to this city, will come calling to Buddha bastion this Friday, to explore partnership possibilities in various sectors, from infotech to education, biotech to biscuits, tourism to tech solutions and law to limestone.

 Led by W. Hirche, minister for economics in the German state of Lower Saxony, the diverse group will meet state industries minister Nirupam Sen, IT and environment minister Manab Mukherjee, principal secretary commerce and industry Sabyasachi Sen from Writers? Buildings. One-to-one meetings with prospective business partners are also lined up.

 ?We are seeing this as a great opportunity, not only to carry the state?s IT thrust forward, but press home other core strengths like education and arts. It?s also a scope to showcase the changing facets of Calcutta that remain largely obscure in the West,? stresses B.G. Roy, regional director, Indo-German Chamber of Commerce, Calcutta.

 To kick off the trade team?s trek on a positive note, German consul-general in Calcutta G?nter Wehrmann will chair a breakfast meeting, highlighting the healthy momentum of recent progress in the state. The delegation will then split into specialised groups for focused forays.

 ?We will take the IT team to IBM, Acclaris and Skytech in Sector V, before concluding the programme at the IT minister?s office, where they can offer suggestions,? says Roy.

 Another group will visit the Texmaco factory on Jessore Road, while Werner Meyer, regional director of the international college B.I.B. Bildungszentrum, will meet officials of Indian Institute of Social Welfare amp; Business Management to discuss a student-exchange programme.

 Roy attaches great significance to the presence of Markus Nehmer, managing director of leading travel agency First Reisebuero, in the delegation. ?If we can market the tourist attractions like the river, the old golf clubs, the race course and the heritage brick buildings with gusto, Calcutta could well come within the loop for the German tourist,? he points out.

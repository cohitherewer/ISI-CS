The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 With the bird flu scare, a lot of people are trying to avoid chicken as a precaution 

measure. But it is equally shocking to see that the vegetables, which we buy from 

the market, are dipped in artificial colours. The vegetable vendors dip them in 

colours like green or red to give them a fresher look. These colours contain lead 

and are quite harmful. Consumption of such vegetables may lead to skin problems, 

dysentery and other digestive complications. In a few extreme cases, it may also 

lead to cancer. To prevent these diseases in such a situation, shall we stop having 

vegetables, too? I request the health inspectors of the civic authority to look 

into the matter as soon as possible.

 On my recent trip to Delhi, I saw that taxis, autorickshaws and buses all run 

on compressed natural gas (CNG). Delhi was one of the most polluted cities in 

India, and by adopting CNG, it is trying to tackle the problem. Recently, the 

Central Pollution Control Board has also rated Calcutta as one of the most polluted 

cities in the country. But our government is not at all bothered to take any constructive 

steps to curb the menace. Even the high court has overruled the government ban 

on commercial vehicles more than 15 years old. It is very unfortunate that no 

one is concerned about people who have to walk the city streets and inhale the 

polluted air. I request the concerned authorities to take appropriate steps for 

a healthier future.

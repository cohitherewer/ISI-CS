 Local aid for free school

 SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE

 A government-sponsored high school near Sodepur, on the northern fringes of the city, got a new lease of life when a group of local businessmen decided to bear the expenses of running the school. 

 The school education department has refused to sanction funds for its upkeep.

 Sagar Dutta Memorial Free School, celebrating its centenary, was founded by businessman Sagar Dutta in 1905. 

 Two years ago, it was taken over by Dugar Trust, set up by a group of local businessmen, following the school education departments refusal to provide grants.

 We took over the school as the building was in a shambles. It needed urgent repairs and more space was required. The students were suffering due to a dearth of funds, said S.L. Dugar, chairman of Dugar Trust.

 We requested some of our business partners to construct the new building and they agreed, Dugar added.

 The school has more than 600 students on the rolls. According to school officials, funds were needed for a new building and other expenses. 

 They added that despite help from a few CPM leaders, the school education department was not sanctioning funds. 

 All the students are being educated here free. The government just pays the salary of the teachers. We needed a new building and funds for other activities. And according to the founders wish, we could not even take money from the students, explained principal S.K. Hazra. But thanks to Dugar Trust, we can now educate more poor students, smiled Hazra.

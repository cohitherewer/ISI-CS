 A toy factory and two godowns on Chetla Road, in south Calcutta, were destroyed in a fire on Tuesday morning. There were no casualties.

 It took 11 fire tenders almost two hours to douse the blaze. The fire broke out in a chemical godown and spread to the adjoining godown and the toy factory. 

 ?The cause of the fire is yet to be ascertained. Highly-inflammable chemicals might have been stored in the chemical godown. Its owner is absconding,? said a senior officer of the fire department. 

 Around 8.30 am, residents of the area noticed thick smoke billowing out of the godown. Within a few minutes, it was ablaze. 

 They informed Chetla police station and the fire department. 

 According to the local residents, the tenders reached the spot 45 minutes later. 

 A large group from a slum in the neighbourhood, including women and children, tried to put out the flames with water. After some time, more tenders arrived and the fire was extinguished around 11 am. 

 ?It could have been a disaster, as the locality is thickly populated. Besides, several small factories are located here, side by side. The local people worked in tandem with the firemen to put out the blaze,? said Manoj Kumar Das, an officer of Chetla police station.

 Owner of the destroyed toy factory Sandeep Doshi stated: ?Had the fire tenders arrived in time, my factory would have been saved. Some of my employees, who stay in the factory, called me and I rushed to the spot.?

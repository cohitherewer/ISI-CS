 Kareena Kapoor and Priyanka Chopra on the sets of Indian Idol on Saturday

 One has sung for Dev and the other has been getting offers to cut private albums. So, when Kareena Kapoor and Priyanka Chopra walked in on the sets of Indian Idol to judge the Galas, they meant business.

 ?I am very scared to judge this show because I know one comment from me and their dreams may be shattered,? Kareena said. ?But the cause is so good that I had to come. You have participants coming from remote places in West Bengal and Rajasthan. It is the hope they have of winning that keeps them going.? 

 For Priyanka, though, it wasn?t the first time she was donning the judge?s hat for Indian Idol. ?I had come last year too,? she said. ?It?s great to hear these young people sing their hearts out.?

 While all the Idol finalists were at their very best, the ones to impress Kareena and Priyanka most were Panna Gill, Amey Date, and the Calcutta girls, Antara Mitra and Monali Thakur.

 Kareena was very impressed with the red sari Antara wore for the performance. ?You look so beautiful,? said the actress, who herself looked stunning in the backless golden top she wears in the new Pepsi commercial.

 The showstopper of the evening, however, was Priyanka who sang the Karam number Tinka tinka to thundering applause from the Idol judge trio of Anu Malik, Farah Khan and Sonu Nigam. Catch all the action on Monday at 8.30 pm, on Sony.

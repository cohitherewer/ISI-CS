 Of values and virtues

 Nandikars 23rd National Theatre Festival concludes today with the performance of five plays by the group. The plays being presented are part of a bouquet of 14 productions specially designed with women and children in focus. Featuring two plays for children (at 10 am) to be performed by young actors themselves, the first, Bhalobhasa Bhalobasa, explores the relationship between love and language. Having lost his feelings of love, along with the sweetness of his language, a child goes out in search of both with help from his family, friends, neighbours, and even his feline companions. Leela Mazumders Natun Chhele Natabar is a funny play in which a boy, teased and harrassed by his classmates, gets back his own at them. Among the women-centric plays, Leela Mazumders Dulia and Tarashankar Bandyopadhyays Chokh Gyalo (at 2.30 pm) pay tribute to womens natural capacity for generosity, kindness and love, even amidst adverse circumstances. Jasimuddins Sojon Badiyar Ghat is a poetic, tragic tale, highlighting the unfortunate conflict between religion and love. All plays are directed by Goutam Halder.

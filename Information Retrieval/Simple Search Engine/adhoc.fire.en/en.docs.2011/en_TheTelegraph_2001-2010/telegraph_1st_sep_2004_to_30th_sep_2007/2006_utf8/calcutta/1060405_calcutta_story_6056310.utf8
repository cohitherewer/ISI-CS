 Two die in road mishaps

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Two men were killed and another is battling for his life at a city hospital in separate accidents in Calcutta over the past 24 hours.

 On Tuesday morning, a 38-year-old unidentified cyclist was crushed to death under the wheels of a CSTC bus near Gol Park, while a pedestrian, aged about 50 is fighting for his life at Nil Ratan Sircar (NRS) Medical College and Hospital after being hit by a private bus on AJC Bose Road. 

 According to the police, the first victim was riding a bicycle in a ?no-cycling zone? when the accident occurred. Around 9.15 am, the CSTC bus on route 5, coming from the opposite direction, hit him. He fell before being crushed under the bus?s rear wheels.

 ?The man sustained serious injuries on his head and died on the spot. His identity is not known, but it seems he was a daily-wager. The driver of the bus has surrendered to police,? said an officer of Lake thana.

 Police added that although it is a no-cycling zone, people always flout the rule. Measures are taken against those cycling in prohibited areas; cycles are seized and fines imposed on the offenders. But that has not made any difference.

 Soon after the accident, a large crowd gathered on the spot. Local residents rushed the victim to MR Bangur Hospital, where he was declared dead. A mob chased the bus but in vain. They put up a road block for half-an-hour near Gol Park, demanding the immediate arrest of the driver.

 In the other accident, a 50-year-old pedestrian, Basudeb Dutta, was hit and run over by a private bus on route 45B on AJC Bose Road around 9.45 am. Dutta, a resident of Gardner Lane, in the Amherst Street area, sustained injuries on his chest and legs and was taken to NRS Medical College and Hospital, where his condition is said to be critical.

 Another pedestrian, Dipak Kumar Ghosh, 52, was knocked down by a taxi on Raja Manindra Road, under Tallah police station, on Monday night. He succumbed to his injuries at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital.

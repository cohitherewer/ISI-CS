 - CAMPUS CONFERENCE AT RAJ BHAVAN

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Governor Gopal Krishna Gandhi on Tuesday reviewed the functioning of all state-aided universities at a marathon session with the vice-chancellors and other senior officials.

 He later held a meeting with students? representatives and sought their views on the universities? administration.

 The governor, also chancellor of the universities, ?discussed at length? various measures to enhance the coordination among the universities, a Raj Bhavan official said. 

 Research was another thrust area. Gandhi suggested that the universities conduct joint research, as that would ensure optimum utilisation of resources. 

 Among other topics touched upon at the daylong meeting at Raj Bhavan ? the first of its kind in recent history ? were infrastructure development, students? counselling and opening courses in emerging areas like bio-technology. 

 The governor also stressed the need for boosting the financial condition of the institutions.

 ?The meeting was fruitful. We exchanged ideas with representatives of other universities and also with students,? said Calcutta University pro vice-chancellor Suranjan Das.

 Principal secretary in the state higher education department Sathia Bhasan and University Grants Commission joint secretary A.K. Dogra attended the morning session with vice-chancellors, pro vice-chancellors and registrars. 

 In the afternoon, Gandhi sat with the students? representatives, in the presence of university, UGC and government officials.

 ?It was an open discussion and we were asked to voice our opinions,? a student said.

 Some of the representatives wanted to know why absentee teachers are not punished, though rules debar students without the minimum of 60 per cent attendance from appearing in the examination.

 The students also told the governor that immediate steps should be taken to introduce placement facilities at the universities.

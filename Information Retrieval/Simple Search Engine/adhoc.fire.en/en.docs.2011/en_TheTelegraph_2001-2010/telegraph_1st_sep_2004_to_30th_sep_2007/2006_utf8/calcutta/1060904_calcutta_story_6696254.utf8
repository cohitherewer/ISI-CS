Screen On amp; Off

 Twenty-one-year-old MBBS student of Mumbai Trupti Gilada has won the Best Film at MTV International and Staying Alives 48fest Film Competition.

 The competition empowered 48 youths across the globe to tell their own stories about HIV/AIDS. They had to write, shoot, edit and deliver a three-minute film in just 48 hours at the International AIDS Conference in Toronto.

 Trupti was a part of the winning team that made a three-minute film about stigma titled Fear and Loathing. All participating films were critiqued by a distinguished panel of judges, including Peter Piot, executive director of UNAIDS, Fefe Dobson, Canadian-born rock artist, and singer- songwriter-actress Mya.

 48fest is the first film competition from MTV International and the companys ongoing HIV and AIDS prevention campaign, Staying Alive. All 48 films will premiere in September across all of MTVs worldwide platforms on air, online and on mobile phones.

 Mr evil: Boman Irani with 

 a co-actor in Khosla Ka Ghosla

 He is on the big screen this week as the evil builder Laxman Singh in Lage Raho Munnabhai. But soon, you can catch Boman Irani playing another Punjabi character, that of stockbroker Khurana in Dibakar Banerjees Khosla Ka Ghosla.

 The UTV film is a sweet black comedy revolving around the life of a dysfunctional middle-class family that gets together to upstage Boman, the biggest goon in town.

 In keeping with his research and homework before a film, Boman went to great lengths to make the loud Khurana his own. Firstly he grew a real moustache, cut his hair very short (almost crew cut), and put on almost 10 kg for the character to look the part.

 I had a very particular sketch of a stockbroker in my mind, which I had drawn and given to Boman, said Dibakar. He was very keen to be true to the character and wanted to look real.

 While Khosla Ka Ghosla will release later in the year, you can catch Boman as Laxman in Lage Raho as he poses with the biggest of celebrities in his photo gallery. 

 You can get lucky too and win complimentary beverages in select shows at INOX (Forum), courtesy Starstruck Sports Zone. You can also pamper yourself with some cool and trendy nail art at INOX (City Centre) before you catch Munnas 2nd innings.

 Two youths were arrested on Monday afternoon for allegedly ransacking the house of Eastern Railway officer Sudipto Moitra in Narkeldanga and harassing his family on Saturday night.

 According to Moitra, the duo and several other members of a local club attacked his Garpar Road residence thrice, breaking the windowpanes and locks and throwing excreta at it, after he lodged a police complaint against them for violating noise norms by blaring loudspeakers after 10 pm.

 Besides picking up the duo, police went to the houses of 16 other members of the club and asked their parents to send them to the thana at the earliest. The duo was later granted bail.

 A simultaneous effort has been launched by police to resolve the dispute amicably. 

 A meeting was held among Moitra, the club members and local MLA Sadhan Pandey at the police station.

 Both Moitra and the youths agreed that they would be friends, said an officer.

 Shipra Sinha, secretary of the club, denied knowledge about who had attacked Moitras house. He should not have complained to police, as our members had switched off the loudspeakers after 10 pm. Anyway, the matter has been resolved, she said.

 The members requested Moitra to withdraw the complaint, but he refused. 

 The members had earlier accused Moitra of harassing them by providing misleading information to police.

 Moitra had called deputy commissioner of police (ESD) Partha Sarathi Ghosh after the youths continued to play loudspeakers after 10 pm. His 77-year-old mother-in-law, who stays with him, is a cardiac patient. After police stopped the programme, the members allegedly turned violent and attacked Moitras house. 

 In Sonarpur, four youths were detained for allegedly assaulting a woman and slashing her hands after she complained against them for violating noise norms. Weve sent Shobha Das for medical tests to know the nature of the wounds, said additional SP (industrial) D.P. Singh.

 A BACHELORS PAD IS AN UNINHIBITED REFLECTION OF HIS LIFESTYLE AND PERSONALITY, GIVING AWAY MORE ABOUT HIMSELF THAN HE WOULD OFTEN LIKE TO REVEAL. SHRADHA AGARWAL TAKES A PEEK

 Flaunt your freedom

 Freedom is what best describes a bachelor. Freedom, again, is what best describes his space. An uninhibited reflection of his lifestyle and personality, his pad gives away more about him than what he himself would often like it to reveal.

 GoodLife delves deep into bachelor territory. 

 Bedroom rules

 The mood and feel of this room is extremely young. The bedroom, after all, is a fashion statement in itself. A bachelors bedroom immediately gives away his personality traits, marking off corners to house his hobbies and interests.

 The design pattern could either employ dark walnut-like furniture or it could be a light cedar or white spray look. In any case, the tapestry should be cheerful and bright, says interior designer Karan Jain. The bed, adds Karan, should preferably be low and boast a one-foot mattress.

 Architect and interior designer Vivek Rathore lists some other high points of a bachelors bedroom:

 Low maintenance and high comfort are the key points.

 Chequers and stripes make for cool upholstery.

 A neat table for the laptop and other gizmos is a must.

 Wooden flooring looks great.

 Throw in lots of cushions for that zing factor.

 A small seating area facing the bed completes the look.

 Though most bachelors would put up his bonding snaps, an unusual painting or a mural looks good too, feels Karan. 

 Just chill

 A bachelors social life is invariably busy and his chill-out den drives this point home. Vivek points out that the hangout zone is usually larger than his private space.

 The seating ? lazy-boy chairs, bean bags, recliners, futons or plush leather sofas ? has to be as relaxed as the high-tech entertainment package ? home theatre, plasma TV ? is rocking. His proud collection of CDs and DVDs find pride of place here.

 It is also common for a bachelor to team up single pieces in his own ? often erratic ? style. Say, an Italian leather couch with a Rajasthani side-table. A bachelors home rarely follows a particular design theme.

 Leather tiles or wooden flooring, says Karan, looks good here but the walls should be preferably foamed to absorb sound well.

 Uplifters, halogens, niches, table lamps and other form of indirect lighting is the way to go here, explains Karan.

 The other details, like decorative pieces, Vivek adds, are not thought through too carefully. His idea of touching up with accents is displaying travel collectibles and souvenirs and also putting up each gift he has received down the years.

 Bar basics

 The bar area, says Karan, should boast minimal straight lines and is best kept precise. The counter should be a half-height unit (3.5 to 4 ft) and at best five 5x5 ft. The top could be marble, granite or glass but the real character is enhanced by the barstools. Jazz it up by using psychedelic prints or retro animal prints, says Karan.

 Now, for what lies on the bar-top. Glasses ? a combo of a few beer tankers, old-fashioned glasses, stemmed shooters ? are a must for a bachelor. Dont forget to add a couple of delicate stemmed-glasses when the lady friends come visiting.

 Swizzle sticks, a large ice bucket, tongs, coasters, a bottle opener and a peg-measure are other essentials, says Yuvraj Johar, executive assistant manager of F amp;B at Taj Bengal. 

 And the drinks to be stocked? Well, if the bachelors a connoisseur who likes to serve in style, then the sky is the limit. But if a basic list is what is needed, a bottle each of whiskey and vodka should suffice. And dont forget some Baileys, some Bacardi and some wine.

 Kitchen call

 The kitchen, when it comes to a bachelors pad, is an open area because it often serves as more than just a cooking space. A good space-saving idea is a fuss-free modular kitchen backed by a retractable dining table and folding chairs. The kitchen, says Vivek, mostly overlooks the living area in most bachelor pads to add a sense of comfort and space.

 The external designing done, what is stocked inside a kitchen is as important. Yuvraj draws up a list of must-haves on the bachelors kitchen shelves, at least for an emergency situation (or when he is sick of dialling for pizza):

 A non-stick frying pan. 

 Three sizes in deep pans for boiling, cooking and sometimes serving the food. 

 A wooden spatula.

 A microwave.

 A set of knives and a chopping board. 

 Cooking oil and a spice box. 

 Non-stain, non-breakable plates with bowls and glasses. 

 A packet of paper napkins.

 Housekeeping basics like kitchen towels, foil sheets, cling wrap, dish washing bar liquid soap and scrubbing sponge.

 Lots of instant food like ready-to-eat noodles and soup packets. 

 Munchies ? both desi favourites like bhujiya and Kurkure and non-desi ones like cereal, popcorn, nachos, pretzels and wafers.

 A jar of instant coffee, teabags and cookies (fat-free if the bachelor is attached).

 The refrigerator should also be loaded with goodies. Other than stocking breakfast basics like packaged milk, eggs, cheese and bread along with all its accompaniments ? jam, marmalade and cheese spread ? the fridge should also hold a collection of cold cuts. Another must is soda, coke and beer, adds Yuvraj.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You cant 

 get through this week without

 Pampering brother dear 

 for a day

 The Diwali mood lingers and your 

 fridge is still jammed with laddoo and barfi, 

 so its time to move on and gear up for yet another 

 festival, Bhai Phonta. And pamper is the name of the game 

 this Tuesday. So, sisters get set to pamper bro dear with 

 gifts and goodies. If you still havent hunted down 

 the gift, make most of the Diwali discounts that 

 are still on at many stores. His favourite fragrance, the 

 latest gizmo, a designer shirt... the options are endless. 

 And dont you forget to line up his favourite meal 

 for him.

 Catching Don, if you still 

 havent

 Zara dekho kaun aa gaya hai... 

 After weeks of wait, Farhan Akhtars Don is 

 finally here. From the 1978 dhobi ghats of Mumbai, 

 the chase has reached the Eiffel Tower in 2006. King Khan 

 has taken over from the Big B and the knives are out whether 

 SRK has been able to do an AB. Whatever be the outcome, 

 you aint gonna miss this one.

 Grabbing your copy of 

 the Booker book

 If you havent yet read The 

 Inheritance Of Loss, grab your copy today. Theres 

 lots to enchant you the story of Sai, the backdrop of 

 the Himalayas, and the simple truths some of us love reading 

 (love lies not in the fulfilment but in the absence)... 

 And if you are waiting for the movie, theres hope 

 because unlike Arundhati Roy, Kiran Desai has consented 

 to her book being filmed.

 Threatened with arrest, Sonia Karwalia, a former cycling champion who slapped a constable on Sunday for not doing his duty, said she would hit him again in such a situation. 

 ?Aisa agar hum dekhen ki dubara ho raha hai, hum phir kaske ek jhapad marenge. Mujhmen yeh takat hai (If I see such an incident being repeated, I will slap him hard again. I have that strength in me),? asserted Sonia. 

 On Sunday morning, she had slapped a constable at the Ultadanga crossing when he refused to take down the number of a speeding bus that hit her motorcycle. 

 She and her pillion-rider rolled away to safety, but her helmet was crushed under the rear wheels of the bus.

 Police seem to be in two minds about the incident. ?We will arrest the lady as she assaulted a police officer on duty,? said deputy commissioner (traffic) Jawed Shamim. He added that there was ?no dereliction of duty? on the constable?s part. 

 But the constable denied that there had been any assault. Prosanto Adhikari, who was on duty on the spot at the time of the incident, said no woman had hit him.

 Police at Shyambazar Traffic Guard said they have not been able to trace the bus on route 237 that had hit Sonia?s two-wheeler. A case has been registered against the bus driver and crew.

 Sonia, who represented Bengal in the 2003 cycling nationals, was returning from the airport. 

 ?Senior officers should keep an eye on their personnel and see if they are doing their duty properly,? she said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Saltlec stage for global IT player

 BISWARUP GOOPTU

 Cap Gemini, the $8 billion consulting, outsourcing and technology solutions provider, is the latest high-profile name to make an entry into Bengal?s booming information technology (IT) sector.

 The global IT consultancy firm headquartered in Paris will be inaugurating its new 23,000 sq ft facility in Asyst Park in Sector V by mid-March, with an option of adding to its built-up area in the future. According to IT department officials, the company is expected to start its ITES operations in Calcutta with an employee count of around 500.

 With the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government determined to position Calcutta as the preferred IT destination, the coming of Cap Gemini bodes well for the state?s IT sector. ?It is great news for us, as Cap Gemini is a global leader in the global outsourcing, consulting and technology services field. It just goes to show that the perception issues about the state have been laid to rest,? said G.D. Gautama, principal secretary, ministry of information technology.

 Cap Gemini has its presence in more than 30 countries, with centres in Mumbai and Bangalore. On February 2, the IT firm cornered a significant share of a $7.5 billion contract awarded by General Motors. The company also announced that it would be increasing headcount in India in order to service the GM account.

 Paul Spence, global CEO, Outsourcing, India, had said: ?This contract will be another step in increasing the Cap Gemini India staff from 3,800 today to 10,000 by the end of 2007.?

 The IT major?s scope of operations has so far been largely centred in the United States, Canada and Europe. But now the company has identified India and China among its fastest growing markets.

 Over the years, Cap Gemini has evolved as a RightShore delivery model, by which the location of the resources does not matter and results are delivered by pooling resources as a single entity across multiple locations.

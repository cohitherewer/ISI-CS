 While the next three days will 

 require you to deck up in traditional finery, Saptami 

 is the day to flaunt your fusion or western bests. Swastika 

 Mukherjee dons the Saptami look in a white silk skirt 

 from Monapali, embellished with block prints and metallic 

 danglers. This has been paired with a fuchsia halter top 

 with embroidery at the front. 

 The make-up is bright and fresh. 

 The eyes boast a combination of fuchsia shadow on the sockets, 

 with greyish blue extended ends and silver highlights. Pink 

 blush and purplish pink lips complete the look. The hair 

 has been straightened out with volume at the roots.

 Him

 A casual yet smart look is what 

 Saptami calls for. Max Benitz strikes a pose in a 

 plain white, cotton shirt with embroidery in blue, olive 

 and emerald at the cuffs. The shirt by Neha Saraf of 99 

 Grams, has been teamed with denims. The look is retro 

 and very smart, says Neha.

 So Rang De Basanti is Indias entry for the Oscars this year. In March 2007, we will know whether it makes it to the Kodak Theatre. But havent there been Indian movies in the past which should have swept the Academy Awards? At least win the Best Foreign Film Oscar?

 Metro asks you to choose one of the five films below which should have won an Oscar. 

 A. Sholay Ramesh Sippys classic remains one of the most loved Bollywood blockbusters of all times.

 B. Mughal-e-Azam K. Asifs magnum opus is a visual spectacle high on emotions.

 C. Bandit Queen Shekhar Kapurs best film is a modernday classic.

 D. Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge The SRK-Kajol romance lives on after 11 years.

 E. Kaagaz Ke Phool Guru Dutts celluloid poem remains a cinematic gem.

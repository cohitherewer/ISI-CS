 hospital in growth in mode

 DEBASISH CHATTOPADHYAY

 Ramakrishna Mission Seva Pratishthan has taken up an expansion plan to cater to more patients in a much better way.

 A new building will be set up and dedicated to the suffering humanity on July 24, 2007, the day the institute completes 75 years of service, announced Swami Sarvalokananda, secretary, Ramakrishna Mission Seva Pratishthan and Vivekananda Institute of Medical Sciences.

 It will coincide with the launch of a year-long programme to mark the platinum jubilee of the hospital.

 Many of our departments are facing an acute space crunch. We hope the new building will solve the problems, he added.

 The building, to come up on a 14-cottah plot, will house a bigger general emergency department, a paediatric ward which will have an intensive neonatal care unit, a 24-hour pharmacy, a waiting hall for patients relatives and an auditorium for medical seminars.

 The basement will be used as car park, with a capacity of 60 vehicles.

 Everyday, several patients come to the hospital with their relatives. The need for a waiting hall is badly felt. The average daily turnout at the outpatients department is 2,000.

 The hospital now has 550 beds and it is expected that the number will rise once the new building is commissioned.

 We have long felt the need for an expansion, but there was no vacant plot adjacent to the hospital on Sarat Bose Road. So, we had to relocate 74 slum-dwellers living next to the hospital to Maniktala, the secretary said.

 The Paikpara zamindar family is contributing a major part of the project cost of Rs 10 crore, he added.

 The hospital was started in 1932, when it was known as Ramakrishna Mission Sishumangal Pratishthan, a maternity and child welfare centre operating from a rented house.

 In 1956, it became a multi-discipline general hospital and was renamed Ramakrishna Mission Seva Pratishthan.

 The largest non-government medical institution in the state, the Seva Pratishthan now has in its compound the Vivekananda Institute of Medical Sciences (a postgraduate institute and research centre), Ma Sarada College of Nursing and a school of nursing.

 The institute runs courses on community health service, X-ray, physiotherapy and a diploma course for laboratory technicians.

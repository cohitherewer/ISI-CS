 Bed basics 

 for sound sleep 

Feng Shui Matters 

Pinky Kapoor

 The bed is the most important furniture 

 in the bedroom and this should be carefully designed 

 and placed to ensure a peaceful environment where the 

 Chi can move freely. The bed should have solid headboard 

 and footboard without sharp projections. The headboard 

 should not be pointing towards the north. It is advisable 

 to sleep with the head towards the south. The bed should 

 never be pointed directly towards the entrance door 

 or the toilet 

 The best reward for tired limbs is a good nights sleep. This is possible only in a peaceful environment where the Chi can move freely. 

 The bed is the most important 

 piece of furniture in the bedroom and should be carefully 

 designed and placed in the right direction. 

 Head space 

 It should have a solid headboard and a footboard without sharp projections in any direction. Pointed projections in the bed or anywhere in the bedroom resemble poison-arrows and must be avoided. 

 The headboard should not be placed in the north because the head in a human body is considered to be the north pole. When we sleep with our head pointing towards the earths magnetic north, the two like poles repel each other. This causes disturbed sleep and insomnia. 

 It is best to sleep with your head pointing south. Here unlike poles interact and this results in peaceful sleep. But other factors should also be taken into consideration. 

 Bedrooms normally have attached 

 toilets and it is not advisable to sleep with your head 

 pointing to a wall that is also shared by the toilet. This 

 allows the negative energy to penetrate the body. It is 

 also not good to wake up in the morning facing the toilet 

 door. 

 Door dos 

 To avoid obstructing the smooth flow of Chi in the bedroom, the bed should not be placed directly in front of the entrance door. It deprives you of privacy and also directly hits the person sleeping on the bed. 

 Care should be taken to avoid 

 the feet pointing towards the door while sleeping. The best 

 position is always to have the bed placed diagonally to 

 the door. It is essential to have a solid wall behind the 

 headboard because this provides you with support and a feeling 

 of security.

 Couple corner 

 Marital discords often happen when the bedroom is in the north-west. This is because this area is ruled by movement and this becomes the major factor for destabilising the relationship. This leads to a disturbed mind. 

 For a happy conjugal relationship, it is best to occupy the south-west room of the house. South-west is ruled by the earth energy and its gravitational pull works wonders in stabilising marriage relationships. 

 This area can be further enhanced 

 by placing a couples photos and a figurine or anything 

 in a pair that suggests togetherness. 

 Kids comfort 

 It is often seen that the kids rooms are designed to have the bed in a corner to give space to the children to play around. This hinders the free growth of growing children. 

 The bed should also never be placed under a beam as it causes headaches and tension.

 North-west rooms are bad for kids as the excessive movement here does not allow them to study and also keeps them away from the house. This sector of the house is best used for entertainment where the television or the home theatre can be placed. 

 Rooms in the eastern part of the 

 house should be occupied by growing children. Here the energy 

 of the rising sun aids their growth. 

 Shape up 

 Do not keep strong electronic items like television, DVD, music systems, computers or electronic alarm clocks too close to where they sleep. The electromagnetic radiation from these gadgets cause disturbed sleep. It is best to unplug them or cover them at night. 

 Do not forget the shape of the 

 bedrooms. These should ideally be square or rectangle. Normally 

 the attached toilet is built into the bedroom that spoils 

 the bedrooms shape. This can be remedied with a soft 

 curtain that would demarcate the projected area and give 

 a regular shape to the room. 

 Mirror musts 

 Finally, do not have mirrors in 

 the bedroom as their reflection disturbs the healing process 

 that takes place within the body when it is at rest. 

 Tip of the week

 To clear the bedrooms of any kind of negativity and to have a good nights sleep, light an aromatherapy candle placed on a plate with flowers in water in the east of the north-east corner.

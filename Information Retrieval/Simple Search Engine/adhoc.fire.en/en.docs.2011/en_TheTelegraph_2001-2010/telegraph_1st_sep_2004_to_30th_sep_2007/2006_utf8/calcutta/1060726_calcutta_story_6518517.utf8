 Dupe slur on Orissa firm

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The ninth judicial magistrate of Alipore court on Tuesday directed Partho Roy, finance adviser, and S. Majumdar, chief consultant, of Regional Resource Development Organisation (RRDO), an Orissa-based financial institution with its office at 261, CR Avenue, to appear before it.

 The court order was passed on the basis of a criminal complaint lodged against RRDO by Rilton International, a city-based company, for duping it of Rs 60,000.

 According to the complaint, the owner of Rilton had applied to RRDO for a loan of Rs 2 crore last year. He paid a processing fee of Rs 60,000 in two instalments ? Rs 10,000 in April and the rest in June 2005. But the loan is yet to materialise.

 ?I was planning an ambitious project in Bangalore, for which I required Rs 2 crore. I came to know of the organisation through its advertisements, in which it had claimed to be an international funding unit, working as a link between businessmen requiring funds and international funding agencies. I submitted a detailed project report and they promised me a loan,? said the owner of Rilton.

 RRDO informed him in August 2005 that the money would be sanctioned soon. 

 ?Accordingly, I went ahead with my plans in Bangalore. I negotiated with a property-owner and paid him Rs 1 lakh as advance for the plot, on condition that the money would be forfeited if I failed to pay the balance,? the businessman recalled.

 ?I tried to get in touch with officials of the firm, but failed. While promising me the loan, they had claimed that their operation was RBI-approved and that they were associated with IMF. I later came to know that they had no links with the organisations,? he added.

 The court had issued summons to the accused. RRDO had sought exemption from personal appearance, but on Tuesday, Alipore court made it clear that the officials must make an appearance.

 No one from RRDO could be contacted, as the CR Avenue office was closed on Tuesday.

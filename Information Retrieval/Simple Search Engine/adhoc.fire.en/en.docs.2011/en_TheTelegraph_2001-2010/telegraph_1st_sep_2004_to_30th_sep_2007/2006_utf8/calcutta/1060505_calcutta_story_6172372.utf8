 Splurge till the middle of the month and go slow for the rest. Or travel till the middle of the month and then splurge till it?s time to turn the calendar page. With the young professional ? largely from new-age offices ? working hard by day and partying harder by night, the nightclub roster is reflecting the spend-it pattern of the salaried pocket.

 From offering sops like complimentary entry and discount on food and beverages to tailoring the events calendar, the nightclubs are going all-out to woo today?s spenders.

 ?Compared with the last financial year, there has been a 40 per cent rise in revenue from Tantra, Someplace Else and Roxy. Of this, 25 per cent has come from salaried individuals of the IT, BPO, advertisement and banking sectors. So, there is an effort to cater to them in a big way, from planning various entertainment options to creating ambiences that match their mood,? says Anirban Simlai, F amp;B manager, The Park.

 If The Park attempts to cater to these youngsters ?with greater disposable income? and a party spirit throughout the month, DJ Harish of Dublin, at ITC Sonar Bangla, spies a distinct tilt towards ?beginning-of-the-month? action.

 ?The big events are invariably organised over the second and third weekends of the month. The salaried party people often start feeling the pocket pinch towards the end of the month,? observes Harish.

 That is when too many party places scrounge for too few party people. ?They are not very big spenders, but frequent spenders,? says Ramnik Sabharwal of The Golden Park of the ?big BPO work force? that is ruling the party arena these nights.

 ?Earlier, there were only a handful of places which relied completely on the business class, the only exception being the crew from various national and international airlines. But now, every nightclub and lounge bar in town has to try and attract the salaried people from the IT and banking sectors,? adds Sabharwal.

 With party places spreading from Park Street to the EM Bypass, from Salt Lake to Survey Park, the numbers needed to keep the addresses afloat means supply is outstripping demand.

 ?With salaries taking a huge jump in the last two to three years, young people working in big corporate houses, IT companies and BPOs have become the biggest consumers today. So, everyone in the service sector is out to grab their attention and the nightclubs are no exception,? rounds off Saikat Sarkar, general manager, Sourav?s: The Food Pavilion.

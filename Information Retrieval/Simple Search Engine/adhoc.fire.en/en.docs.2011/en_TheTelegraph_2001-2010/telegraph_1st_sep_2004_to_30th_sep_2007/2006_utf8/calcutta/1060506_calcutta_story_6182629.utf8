 Shining nice and pricey

 With gold prices in the city soaring to an all-time high of Rs 10,000 (for the 10 gram grade) on May 3, the yellow metal finds itself at the centre of a big-time buzz.

 The price rise comes at a time when the wedding season is on in full swing in this part of the country, a prime reason why most jewellers in Calcutta have not felt the hike hit.

 For the regular gold buyer it might be a wait-and-watch game, but for the necessity-driven wedding jewellery purchaser there is no shying away from jewellery stores. The quantity perhaps is compromised but the value of gold buy is not.

 Gold purchase during Indian weddings is customary. For the gold customer it is like following traditions and social norms, says Sankar Sen, CEO of Senco Gold.

 Reiterates couture jeweller Raj Mahtani of Satramdas Dhalamal Jewellers of Park Street: Consumerism is on a high and weddings are becoming extravagant by the day. So price hike in the long run will not make a significant impact.

 At the Senco Gold store at Moulali there has neither been a dip nor a rise in profit margins. There is no loss but the profit path has not followed the natural trend. Given that the Bengali wedding season is on, we would have expected a higher demand without price fluctuations, says Sankar.

 Prices may have soared, but gold retains its grip on the market. Gold is a part of our culture and its regal appeal cannot be duplicated by any other medium. For the jeweller, the fluctuations might be a deterrent in long-term planning, but for the buyer, whatever the price theres no alternative to gold, he adds.

 For the big spender, gold buy is not affected by price fluctuations. As Sanjiv Agarwal, the Indian subcontinent managing director of World Gold Council puts it: Aspects like design and fashion continue to be their priority. 

 Brinda Ganguly Sirkar from A. Sirkar agrees: The quantity rules and not the budget. This section does not mind going a bit over-budget too.

 But the mid-segment is cutting down on volumes. To meet the budget deficit of this market, the expertise of the jewellery designer plays a vital part. The purchaser might be constrained by the budget factor but she obviously eyes heavy pieces for the wedding. Here the jeweller comes into the picture creating an ornate piece using grams of gold well within her means, points out Chandrakanta Roychowdhury of MP Jewellers.

 The one arena where jewellers are feeling the heat is the gift segment. For, the yellow metal is no longer the most preferred gift option for weddings. 

 If all that the gift budget of Rs 5,000 gets the buyer is a tiny gold trinket, one might as well go for a refrigerator, smiles Brinda.

 For a section of the regular jewellery buyers, theres a temporary tilt towards diamond and precious stones, points out Raj. 

 But he is quick to add: Gold is perennial and it is only a matter of time before they start indulging in gold again.

 Some jewellers like Brinda forecast 18-carat gold finding more favour than 22 carat if the price does not dip below the Rs 10,000 mark.

 Others point out the positives of the scenario. With the price hike, it is the right time for intelligent investment, says Chandrakanta.

 Gold is a reliable investment. 

 Something that is convertible and will reap benefits once 

 you decide to cash in. We now find buyers coming up and 

 selling gold coins purchased from us a few years back. Imagine 

 another such hike and the profit margin of gold investors, 

 he says.

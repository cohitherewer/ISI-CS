 Room rules for little ones

Feng Shui Matters 

Pinky Kapoor

 According to Feng Shui, a kids 

 room should be located in the eastern part of the house 

 as the energy of the rising sun aids their growth. Once 

 they grow up, they can be moved to the western part 

 of the house

 Feng Shui rules should be followed while doing up a childs room. For kids it is best to choose rooms that are located in the eastern part of the house as the energy of the rising sun aids their growth. Once they grow up and the space permits, they can be moved to the western part of the house, the logic being that the sun sets in the west and helps grown-ups to settle well in their lives.

 Colour code

 The colour combination in a childs room has a major impact on them. The best way is to check their elemental composition with the help of the four pillars of destiny and nourish them with colours accordingly. The other way out is by seeing their outer personality. 

 Usually you will find that many children are placid, lethargic and lazy and feel exhausted most of the time. This shows that they are loaded with the water element. An overdose of blue colour in their rooms will further aggravate their water element. A room that is decorated in vibrant colours with dashes of red, maroon, purple, mauve and peach on bedspreads, curtains, pictures, toys and rugs, will change the childs energy level. 

 If your children are over-energetic, naughty, disobedient, restless and have a hot temper, then their anger and irritability should be calmed down by giving them a cool environment. A well-balanced room with shades of blue will be a blessing for them.

 Picture perfect

 You should take special care when deciding on the theme of your childs room. Many children want pictures of animals painted on their walls. One has to be careful with the choice of animals. Friendly and pleasant pictures of a group of penguins, dolphins, rabbits and birds of different kinds would be more appropriate than hostile figures of ferocious animals like lions, tigers, panthers and cheetahs. 

 Do not put up an abstract or a confusing image on the walls. What ever the children are surrounded with should be meaningful to them. 

 Study time

 Once they reach their teens, the surrounding environment should be a more realistic one. Now their priority changes from fairytales to educational world maps, inspirational quotations and role models. 

 The orientation of the study table becomes significant now as they start thinking of their career seriously. North-east is the sector for educational success. You can enhance the childs education by placing an image of god in the north-east of the study table and give him the assurance that any complicated formulae, which he finds difficult to memorise, can be placed in front of the gods image or put up on the soft board. This area, apart from being connected with the mind has gods blessings in abundance. 

 Bed basics

 After the study table, next important is the bed. Normally, parents get bunk beds made for their kids to provide them with more space to play around. This is not encouraged by Feng Shui. First, the top bed works as a beam for the lower one and second, they prevent the child from expanding in life as these beds are built against the wall. Again do not try to save space by having the study table below the bunk bed or by having play area above the desk. In both the cases, the pressure comes on the child studying below. 

 Do not plan to place the bed in the centre of the room if the room happens to be a spacious one. This gives the feeling of floating in the room, which disturbs the childs mental and physical well being. The bed by no means should be placed in line with the bedroom door as the inflowing energy directly hits the child sleeping on it. Moreover, it does not provide any kind of privacy as the bed remains totally visible and exposed in this kind of arrangement. Ideally, the bed should be placed diagonal to the entrance with the headboard against a solid wall to provide children with complete privacy and a feeling of security. 

 Tip of the week

 Display photos of your children in the western part of the room to strengthen and maintain a harmonious relationship between them.

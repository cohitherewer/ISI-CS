 The second Writer?s Bloc is beginning in Mumbai this month. This script-writing exercise was born out of the intense need felt by the members of theatre group Rage for formal training in scriptwriting. They wanted to write plays about their experiences and ?create a relevant, powerful voice for our theatre?.

 In 2001, the Rage team of Rahul da Cunha, Shernaz Patel, Rajit Kapoor and others approached the Royal Court Theatre, London, for help. Three years later, Writer?s Bloc was launched as a unique British Council/Rage/Royal Court collaboration.

 ?If you have a full-length or one-act play, monologue or anything that shows your talent as a playwright, contact us on letsragehotmail.com. If your original play is in an Indian language please send in an English translation. Script submission: June 5, 2005.?

 That was the advertisement greeting aspiring writers. ?It is not the plays but the playwrights that get selected,? Shernaz Patel tells Metro from Mumbai.

 This time round there were a hundred entries in six different languages. Four plays were sent from Calcutta but none made the grade. The 12 finalists are from Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore, Chennai, Nagpur and Pune. The final stage presentations will not happen before January 2007.

 The project, says Shernaz, ?is picking up momentum? and ?contributing in a small way to curing the lacuna that surrounds scriptwriting?. In India, playwriting doesn?t get the educational or financial support it deserves, she rues. So most playwrights picked for the first Writer?s Bloc have moved on to other things or returned to 9 to 5 jobs.

 So does an occasional event like Writer?s Bloc really help? For a fortunate few, it can provide the ideal platform to perform. There are two weeks of residential workshops with experts from the Royal Theatre Company, reading and interpreting scripts, creative brainstorming and writing of original scripts. Then, more sessions of fine-tuning followed by another round of selections when some scripts get chosen for production.

 After the first Writer?s Bloc, four chosen playwrights travelled to London for another session with Royal Court Theatre and Asian theatre groups. ?This time we have more sponsorship and hope to take the festival to different cities across India,? says Shernaz.

 Despite film assignments like Black and Family, Shernaz Patel has kept up her decade-and-a-half affair with Rage and the stage. With plays like The Diary of Anne Frank, Nuts, Six Degrees of Separation and more recently Breathe in Breathe out to her credit, she has led various Rage workshops and training projects.

 Apart from Writer?s Bloc, Rage hosted the Chhattis Ghante (36 Hours) experience, last November at Prithvi Theatre. Twelve experimental plays were written and produced in the span of just 36 hours!

 ?We do theatre work mainly out of passion. It is a very, very difficult territory. Most of the time we work only as groups limiting ourselves to the limited circle of writers, actors and directors. But there is so much talent out there? Events like these make for a sharing and exchange of ideas. We are no longer working in isolation. Suddenly it is one big family of creative people,? feels Shernaz.

 As far as scriptwriting is concerned, seeing the scripts produced remains a learning experience. ?These are plays we are talking about, so unless you hear the dialogues and see the play enacted you don?t know what works,? says Shernaz.

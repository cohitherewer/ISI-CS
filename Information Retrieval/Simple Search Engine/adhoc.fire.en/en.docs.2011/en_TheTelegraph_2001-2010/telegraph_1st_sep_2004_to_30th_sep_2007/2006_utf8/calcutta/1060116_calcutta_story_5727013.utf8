 It's Your Birthday So...

 You?re bright, attractive and charming. You have patience and common sense to take the good with the bad. You are good at forming long-term work relationships. You?re a natural diplomat and can express something unpleasant without generating ill feelings. Young at heart, regardless of age, you believe there?s no limit to love. ? Kusum Bhandari

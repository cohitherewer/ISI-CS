The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Life

 Kings of the console

They have revolutionised the sounds of 

Calcuttas party scene over the past few years. GoodLife zooms in on the 

famous five DJs who keep the bash alive with their music medley

Who: DJ Girish

 Where: Shisha Bar at 22, Camac Street

 Age: 27

 Turning the table since: 2002. Girish has been disc jockeying for the past four years. I was part of a band and wanted to make a career as a singer. But in 2000 the band scene was quite lukewarm in Calcutta. So, I started remixing music. Gradually, I got offers to do shows in leading clubs of the city. Shisha Bar happened in 2002 and since then there has been no looking back.

 Turning point: He is still waiting for a turning point.

 Specialises in: House and hip-hop.

 Has moved: Abhishek Bachchan and almost all the stars who drop in to Shisha every now and then. I really love Abhisheks attitude. He was glued to the dance floor for over five hours when he came to Shisha.

 Wants to move: Amitabh Bachchan to Dekha na hai re socha na?

Looking ahead: I want to go to Europe 

and the US with my music. I also want to travel to West Asia to promote my kind 

of music. I will also release my own album with my original compositions very 

soon. 

Who: DJ Akash

 Where: Fusion, the resto-bar at The Golden Park

 Age: 27

 Turning the table since: 2000. We had thrown a party on New Years Eve, but could not get hold of a DJ. So I took out my collection of CDs and started playing. The party was a hit and after that I just started off with disc jockeying.

 Turning point: A chance to play at the Merchants Cup at CC amp;FC got me a lot of publicity. That was the turning point. 

 Specialises in: Churning out Bollywood remixes. You like it or not, but the party people just love Bollywood music and I believe in playing to the gallery. 

 Has moved: Suniel Shetty, Shilpa Shetty and Zaheer Khan. 

 Wants to move: Big B on Jahaan teri yeh nazar hai.

Looking ahead: My album will be hitting 

the racks very soon. I will also produce an album with some original music composed 

by me.

Who: DJ Harish 

 Where: Dublin in ITC Sonar Bangla Sheraton amp; Towers

 Age: 35

 Turning the table since: 1998. Prior to that, Harish was part of a band called Eyes. Once the band broke up, in my quest to stay in tune I tried my hands at disc jockeying. He started out as a freelancer and then became the resident DJ of Dublin three years ago.

 Turning point: Harish was lucky to have bagged shows from leading music channels like MTV and Channel [V] whenever they had a programme in Calcutta. He also started playing for various big corporate houses.

 Specialises in: If you are playing in Dublin you have to have a huge repertoire of retro music as that suits the guest profile. 

 Has moved: Viv Richards, Waqar Younis, Mallika Sherawat and Mandira Bedi. 

 Wants to move: Shah Rukh Khan. He is the king of hearts and having him move to my tunes will be a major morale boost. I would go for a lively or a funny track because Shah Rukh is in his best elements in these situations.

Looking ahead: I want to cut my own album 

that will have original songs by me. I somehow do not like the idea of picking 

up songs at random and remixing them.

Who: DJ Vicky

 Where: Venom in Fort Knox

 Age: 29

 Turning the table since: He started playing in Pink Elephant in 1996. Then he shifted to Anti-Clock, which later became Winning Streak. Now he is playing in the brand new night spot Venom on Camac Street.

 Turning point: Things were quite smooth for me right from the start. I never had to struggle to take control of the console.

 Specialises in: Commercial Hindi and English music. 

 Has moved: Aamir Khan, Preity Zinta, Shahid Afridi and Shoaib Akhtar. 

 Wants to move: Big B on Jahaan teri yeh nazar hai in the way he does the best. 

Looking ahead: Vickys sights are now 

focussed on Venom and he wants to make this new night club one of the best 

discotheques in town. 

Who: DJ Lloyd

 Where: B.E.D. on Ballygunge Circular Road

 Age: 33

 Turning the table since: 1991. I started off with the small music collection that I had. In 1995 I came to Calcutta and joined Anti-Clock. After another small stint in Mumbai I joined Tantra in 2002.

 Turning point: Bagging a job with Fire and Ice in Mumbai in 1999. Fire and Ice could be compared to any of the best clubs in the world. It gave me a lot of exposure. 

 Specialises in: Everything that is popular. 

 Has moved: Mallika Sherawat and Celina Jaitley. 

 Wants to move: Aishwarya Rai to Kajra re. 

 Looking ahead: Lloyd has his own DJ training school called Logical Project. He wants to expand the school and is also waiting to release his album next month.

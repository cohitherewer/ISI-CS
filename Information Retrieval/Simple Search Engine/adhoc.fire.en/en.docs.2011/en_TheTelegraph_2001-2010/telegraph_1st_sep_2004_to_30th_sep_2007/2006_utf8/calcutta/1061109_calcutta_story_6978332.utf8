 Wild ways: Rohit Roy

 After his Viraasat stint on STAR and an Extraaa Innings with MAX, Rohit Roy, one of the more popular stars on television, has signed up a show on Zee Muzic that finds him playing out his fantasies. Fortunately, I am getting paid as well, Rohit laughs out loud over the phone from Mumbai. 

 What has him all keyed up is anchoring a one-hour theme-based musical show, Wild 10. Launched on November 4 at 7 pm, it plays 10 hottest tracks of the week and five choices from various segments such as DJs pick, regional hits, viewers choice, old is gold (retro and international).

 Wild 10 need not mean just naughty; it is about exploring anything that one loves to see and hear about. So, I could talk about wild actors, gizmos, sports, beaches, bars, Rohit says.

 But Viraasat is where his heart still lies. That serial will remain a priority for me, he says. Just 15 days a month are allotted to it while this weekly show will take up two. That leaves enough time for my film assignments as well.

 Rohit has just completed Apoorva Lakhias Shootout at Lokhandwala and is shooting for Delhi Heights with Jimmy Sheirgill and Neha Dhupia. J.P. Duttasaab says I am film material. But TV has given me so much.

 If it will be movies, it will be behind the camera. I want to direct my first film next year, he states. 

 The Bengali actor who speaks the language in bits and pieces with mother and big brother (Ronit) at home is confident of working with star director Rituparno Ghosh soon. We met a couple of times while he was in Mumbai. But the project has not been finalised.

 Kids once more: Rakshanda Khan and 

 Mera Star Superstar host Shilpa Saklani

 Slipping into the celebrity chair this Friday on Mera Star Superstar will be the sexy Rakshanda Khan. The actress who absolutely adores kids has frequently associated herself with them in various ways. During her college days she volunteered for the NGO Akanksha. She has also sponsored the education of a child. And now she will be seen choosing young talent on the Childrens Day special episode of the STAR Plus show.

 In school, Childrens Day was an absolute fun day, recalls Rakshanda. We would have an assembly where all the kids would gather and then there were special programmes put up by our teachers. I just hope that I can make this Childrens Day special for the Mera Star Superstar contestants as well.

 While shooting for the episode, Rakshanda was particularly impressed with seven-year old contestant Kiran Sarkar and six-year-old Rituraj Mahalim. 

 Tune into the Childrens Day special of Mera Star Superstar on Friday, STAR Plus, at 7.30 pm. 

 Unveiled last week, Bigg Boss on Sony is finally getting controversial, and that precisely is the idea of the show, adapted from the international format Big Brother. The 13 contestants living under the same roof have started on a good note but not everyone is happy with the other. A big question mark is the presence of south Indian actress Ragini, who many believe to be a representative of Bigg Boss himself.

 Contrary to her image, Rakhi Sawant is turning out to be the sweetest of the lot (or at least she is posing to be). On tomorrows episode she would be seen washing all the clothes of the contestants. She did tell co-contestant, Bhojpuri filmstar Ravi Kishen: Ravi mere fans mujhe kapde dhote hue dekhenge to kya sochenge!

 Ravi is on a trip of his own. The actor who has appeared in most of the recent blockbuster Bhojpuri films, including the Amitabh Bachchan-starrer Ganga, wants to win a National Award for his performances.

 Meanwhile, model Carol Gracias, better known as the wardrobe-malfunction model, is cooking for all the other contestants. Find out whether they like the taste of things to come on Thursday before Shahid Kapur comes visiting the inmates on Friday. Bigg Boss airs at 10 pm on Sony.

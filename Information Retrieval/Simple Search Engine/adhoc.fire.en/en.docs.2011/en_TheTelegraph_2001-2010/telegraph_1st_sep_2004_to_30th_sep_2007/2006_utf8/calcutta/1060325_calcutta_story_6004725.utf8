Life

 Feminine 

 focus

 Brazilian model 

 Claudia shows off an outfit from the India Fashion Week 

 line of Monapali 

 Mingling a glorious tradition 

 with modern sensibility, old-fashioned charm with contemporary 

 ecleticism, rich sensuality with urban serenity, Monapalis 

 autumn-winter 2006 line celebrates elegance, innocence and 

 romance.

 Its an ode to the 

 beauty of the feminine form, the mix of absolute opposites 

 ? rawness and luxury. An almost seamless fusion of contrasting 

 colours, cuts and fabrics lends the collection individuality, 

 says the designer duo.

 GoodLife takes a sneak 

 peek at the line that will be unveiled at Wills Lifestyle 

 India Fashion Week in New Delhi next month.

 Theme: Panch Tattva (Five 

 Elements).

 Inspiration: Stems from 

 scented gardens, sun-drenched beaches, the cool breeze over 

 the brook, exotic plant life and the ripples of wind-blown 

 desert sand.

 Look: A mix of styles conjures 

 up an all-season romantic feel.

 Colours: White, black, 

 pink, lilac and turquoise.

 Fabrics: Linen, brocade, 

 chiffon, silk and georgette.

 Silhouette: A mix of modern 

 and classic cuts ? cropped jackets, skirts, wraps, saris 

 and pants.

 Embellishment: Wool is 

 the choice for embroidery along with thread. Surface texturing 

 in the form of cut outs, applique, patchwork, diffused printing, 

 hand paint.

 Show: On April 8, at 5 

 pm, The Grand in New Delhi.

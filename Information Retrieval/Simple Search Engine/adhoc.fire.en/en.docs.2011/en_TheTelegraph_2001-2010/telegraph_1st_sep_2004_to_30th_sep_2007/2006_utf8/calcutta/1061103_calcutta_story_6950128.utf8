 Cameras to rein in civic staff

 A STAFF REPORTER

 All civic offices will be armed with closed-circuit TV cameras and smart card devices to keep a tab on the employees.

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on Thursday gave the go-ahead to mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya to implement the project to revamp the poor work culture of the civic employees.

 Sources said the TV cameras would be installed in the 15 borough offices and the central stores in the first phase. The headquarters on SN Banerjee Road will be covered in the second.

 The smart card device will record the time the employees are entering or leaving office, while the TV cameras will help the authorities monitor whether the personnel are working or whiling away time.

 The scheme will be implemented as part of the capacity building programme being funded by the British governments department for international development (DFID).

 The DFID has allotted Rs 212.25 crore to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation as technical and financial support for the programme.

 The mayor got a taste of his staffs work culture during a recent visit to departments in the headquarters. Most employees were seen entering office only after 11.45 am, though their duty starts at 10.30 am.

 The attendance scene is worse in the borough offices, where a large section of the staff walks in at 12.30 pm and makes it a point to leave at 3.30 pm. There have also been instances of employees signing the register 10 days in advance.

 Car thieves sans border

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Subho Acharya had parked his car at the Nagerbazar crossing in Dum Dum on Monday night. It was gone when he returned to the spot on Tuesday morning.

 With thieves becoming smarter at cracking door locks and driving away the vehicles even in daytime, car thefts are on the rise. 

 According to police, about 1,800 vehicles have been stolen from the city and its outskirts, particularly from areas like Park Street, Shakespeare Sarani, Ballygunge, Tollygunge, Dum Dum and Behala. In most cases, police have failed to recover the cars.

 Trying to explain their poor recovery record, police said most vehicles are smuggled out of the state and sent to Bangladesh. Their number plates are changed before they are sold.

 ?Car-lifting gangs are extremely active here. While two-wheelers are smuggled out to Bangladesh, the four-wheelers are sent to the Northeast via Siliguri. Some of them even make their way to Uttar Pradesh,? said inspector-in-charge of Dum Dum police station Sunil Bhattacharya. 

 ?We have recovered a few of them from pockets close to the Bangladesh border, like Swarupnagar, Bongaon, Basirhat and Barasat... A couple of years ago, we had arrested a few Bangladeshi nationals. They had admitted that they bribed the BSF and BDR personnel manning the border to smuggle their vehicles out,? he added. 

 Each two-wheeler is sold between Rs 45,000 and Rs 80,000 in Bangladesh, depending on the brand. In case of cars, only expensive models like Bolero, Scorpio and Tata Sierras are in demand.

 ?Car theft can be prevented if the owners are a bit more alert. Car companies should come up with upgraded locks and alarm systems,? said Bhattacharya.

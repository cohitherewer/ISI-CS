 Con probe reveals job scam

 Television stocks guru Bhaskar Mukherjee was not the first in his family to try a con, according to police. His father Smriti, who was arrested in Balasore with Bhaskar, had allegedly cheated people in the mid-1980s by promising them police jobs. 

 The two had disappeared in May with crores of rupees invested in the stock market by over 100 people through a company named Biniyog, add the cops. Bhaskar founded the company in November 2005. His 66-year-old father helped in the operations.

 Smriti, a former home department official posted at Writers? Buildings, had collected money by promising jobs in police, an investigator said. The sexagenarian allegedly told his victims that he was close to a joint secretary of the department.

 The Mukherjees then lived in a housing estate on SK Deb Road, near Kalindi. They moved to Dhakuria about a year and a half ago.

 ?We have found several leads and are trying to piece them together. It will take us some time to get to the root of the matter,? said city detective department chief Gyanwant Singh.

 As Bhaskar went about charging fees for his services as ?portfolio manager?, Smriti claimed to be a former district magistrate of Murshidabad or a former senior official of the home department. 

 ?When I visited the housing estate near Kalindi where the father and son lived, the neighbours said they were tired of answering queries by people who had been cheated by Smriti. Some of them even said Mukherjee senior had duped them by promising plots in Salt Lake,? stated Bangur resident Atanu Das, who had invested through Bhaskar?s company and had later lodged a complaint against him.

 ?While it is not clear why the family suddenly decided to leave the flat and move to Dhakuria, it appears that they wanted to avoid facing their victims,? Das added.

 ?Smriti dealt firmly with the clients at Biniyog?s office. He, in fact, told us how he was once gheraoed by a youth for over 12 hours in Behrampore when he was the district magistrate there. We thought he was a powerful man,? said Ratan Dhar, who had invested Rs 28.25 lakh through Biniyog and has not got the money back.

 The twain didn?t meet

 - Images of Germany

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A photograph at the exhibition, from a series called Childhood, by Anne Schonharting

 The evolution of modern Germany, its known and unknown faces, the small often forgotten things is what Images of Germany is all about. 

 The clutch of photographs on display at the Seagull Arts and Media Resource Centre, is an attempt by eight members of the Ostkreuz Photographic Agency to encapsulate the changes in German society over the last twenty years. 

 The Ostkreuz started as an autonomous venture by seven East German photographers 15 years ago. The images of this group have documented pre-unification anger at East German reality, the sense of alienation in the new western society and interpretations of the new world. With 17 members hailing from East and West Germany, Ostkreuz is now famous for its ?authorial? and ?reportage? photography.

 One of the concepts featuring in most of the mounted frames is that of ?heimat?, involving both identity and homeland, seen beyond geographical, political and social grids. An image by Jordis Antonia Schlosser, for instance, shows the feet of a middle-aged couple standing together, overlooking a vast landscape scarred by lignite mining. The ?lost root? of the displaced residents of two towns Halle-Neustadt and Garzweller.

 Anne Schonharting touches the fear and insecurity about heimat. Sensitive and memorable images of streetchildren are steeped in immeasurable loneliness as they eat or play in temporary shelters. 

 With enlarged polaroids, Sibylle Bergeman?s retraces her East German experience ? from Lenin in a red salon to a forgotten towel hanging on yellowing wallpaper.

 More memorable and experimental offerings come from Wolfgang Bellwinkel, Annette Hauschild, Ute Mahler, Thomas Meyer and Linn Schroder. The show will be open from 2-7 pm till February 14.

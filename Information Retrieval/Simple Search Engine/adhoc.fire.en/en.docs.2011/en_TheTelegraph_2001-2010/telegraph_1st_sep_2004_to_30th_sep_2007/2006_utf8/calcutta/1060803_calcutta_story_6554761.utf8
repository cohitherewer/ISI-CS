 When: Monday, 3.15 pm.

 Where: The art gallery at ITC Sonar Bangla Sheraton amp; Towers.

 The speakers: Priya Paul, chairperson of Apeejay Surrendra Park Hotels Limited, and Rajshree Pathy, chairman and managing director of Rajshree Group of Companies. Oindrilla Dutt moderated the session.

 Take a look: The session kicked off with Rajshrees e-presentation titled Managing it all. And enjoying the process, which she had put together trying to say something about her life.

 She traced her growing years, the years when she showed no great aspirations for the corporate world but the sudden death of her father determined otherwise. This personal loss transformed itself to become an opportunity to realise and fulfil my destiny, she said, as she continued to relate her journey, her hardships and finally sweet victory. Rajshree also revealed some key points to success and what goes to define her freedom.

 She expressed her belief that the balance sheet does not provide for gender performance. This explained her recent withdrawal from women entrepreneur awards, too, a concept she equates to nothing less than reservation.

 It was Priyas turn next to carry the afternoon forward. She shared that she had pretty much decided her career strategy when she was 10 years old and spent all her vacations after standard X at work. Priya eventually took over as head of the hotel segment of the family business after her fathers death, also a time when the now glamorous hospitality industry was not quite like it is today. What followed in 1991 was a series of re-positioning measures and carving a niche in the boutique hotel segment when she started creating spaces where she herself would like to hang out.

 Priya revealed her firm belief that fun has to have a huge role in any career. It is important to understand your limitations and manage your own expectations. We cant do everything perfectly all the time but what does count is enjoying every minute of life, felt Priya.

 A brief interactive finale wrapped up the programme as the audience wanted to find out more about required skill sets for success (intuition topped the list), the Indian political scenario and the role of Indian women in the global context.

 Sip n bite: The 

 stimulating talks ended with an equally stimulating tea 

 session at Pan Asian. A selection of fine teas from jasmine 

 to English Breakfast, Earl Grey and lemon and an eclectic 

 vegetarian spread comprising exotic Japanese bites contrasted 

 with a Lebanese Mezze provided food for thought. For sweet 

 endings, it was over to classic mango pudding, baked pie, 

 vanilla ice-cream and date pancakes.

 Voiceover: I will try and invite special lady achievers during my tenure as LSG president. This particular topic is extremely close to my heart and we hope to host many such interesting programmes in the coming few months leading to a very grand year-end finale, said Bharti Deveshwar, president of LSG. 

 Beauty basics 

 What: A seminar by The World of Beauty Aesthetic Association.

 Where: Press Club on Mayo Road.

 When: Monday afternoon.

 Take a look: Discussing the aims of the association, the seminar focussed on promoting certain advanced beauty practices by increasing awareness and guiding beauty professionals. 

 A Bengali beauty book titled Cosmetology written by general secretary of the association Sarbani Ghosh was released on the occasion. 

 The book intends to educate students on the anatomical and physiological aspects of beauty.

 Members of the association including president Julie Sen and chief advisor Threety Irani were present at the seminar. 

 The associations monthly beauty publication called Ruploke, which aims to provide information to beauty professionals, was also released. 

 Voiceover: We are planning our next seminar on skin analysis, pigmentation and its causes that will serve as an educative workshop for beauticians to upgrade standards to international levels, said Sarbani Ghosh.

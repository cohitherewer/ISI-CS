 Fair ground too small

 Work on the much-delayed permanent fair ground, off EM Bypass, will kick off in February, but the 18-acre facility is unlikely to ever host the Book Fair.

 Delhi-based Ahluwalia Contracts (India) Ltd, which built the recently-inaugurated India Export Mart in Greater Noida, showcased their model of the fair ground, named Milan Mela, to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee at Writers? Buildings on Wednesday evening.

 ?Work on the Rs 45-crore project will start on February 15. It will be completed in 18 months,? declared commerce and industry secretary Sabyasachi Sen said.

 Government officials, however, made it clear that the ground will not be able to accommodate the Book Fair crowd.

 ?Milan Mela will comprise eight halls. Two of them will have a total seating capacity of 4,000, while the others will accommodate another 6,000. There is no way 200,000-300,000 people can get in there,? pointed out a senior government official after the meeting.

 The larger halls will be air-conditioned. In addition, there will be a food court and a car park for 200 vehicles.

 The chief minister, who had promised GOC Bengal area Major-General Arun Roye in November that Book Fair 2006 would be the last on the Maidan, sought to play down the issue.

 Asked if Milan Mela would host the Book Fair in future, Bhattacharjee said: ?I will not comment on the Book Fair. I know (the problem).?

 ?We?re thinking of acquiring another four or five acres behind Milan Mela for extending the parking lot,? revealed an official.

 Bhattacharjee reportedly liked the model shown to him and suggested the creation of a dais for seating VIPs, as well as separate washrooms for them.

 ?The chief minister said we could do up the interiors in terracotta,? said an official of the architect firm.

 The firm was chosen among three bidders, including L amp;T and a joint venture of Sapoorji Pallonji and Tata Housing, in mid-December.

 The trade fair complex is being promoted by the West Bengal Trade Promotion Organisation Ltd, which has been set up by the ITPO, West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation Limited and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation. The plot belongs to the civic body.

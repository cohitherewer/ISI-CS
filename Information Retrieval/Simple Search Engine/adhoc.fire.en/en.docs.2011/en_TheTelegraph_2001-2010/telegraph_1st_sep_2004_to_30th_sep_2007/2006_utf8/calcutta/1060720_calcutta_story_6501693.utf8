 A moving internship

 For me, foreign internships only 

 happened in Hollywood movies. And honestly, my two-month 

 internship in Poland, arranged through the student organisation 

 AIESEC, was like a movie. Drug addiction is a major social 

 problem there, and we went as volunteers with Monar, the 

 biggest NGO in Poland working for this cause. They have 

 drug rehab centres all over Poland for various age groups. 

 There were six of us on the project ? three Indian girls, 

 two Turkish boys and one guy from Ukraine. Each pair was 

 stationed at various centres all over Poland. We lived in 

 Monar Centre in Lodz.

 It?s a big city, but we lived on the outskirts in a quiet neighbourhood of cobblestone streets and dim street lights. We stayed for one-and-a-half months with 40 ex-addicts our age. They didn?t know English and we didn?t know Polish, but they loved us from the moment we stepped in. We told them about our culture, cooked Indian food for them, taught them English and some Bollywood dance steps, and listened to their stories.

 Some of them were sent to Monar by police, others were thrown out of homes. Lonely and shattered, each had a different story. From playing football to making bonfires, we spent every day with them till we became a family. We finally bid tearful goodbyes with promises to keep in touch.

 From Lodz in the southwest of Poland, me and my friend left for the small port town of Gdansk in the extreme north on the Baltic Sea, where our other Indian friend and one of the Turkish boys were stationed. The port towns are known for yummy waffles and amber jewellery. Gdansk was terribly cold, with freezing rain. But I still had ice cream! We looked like walking teddy bears, wearing three socks and two jackets and two T-shirts, but it had got warmer later ? from five to 20 degrees Celsius. We even played basketball in the sun.

 Gdansk is very European with a cobblestone market square and tall churches with 400-step towers. Gydnia and Sopot, two other port towns, are smaller but very beautiful. From there, since we didn?t have much money or time, we split ways and I travelled alone to Krakow, the old capital of Poland. I reached there knowing only the name of the person I was going to stay with, a therapist with Monar. He would pick me up in the evening after work. 

 I arrived in the morning and had the entire day to myself. But it was raining and my fingers froze. And I was lost. I bought the map and told the lady to show me where I was. And then finally in the crazy rain I got to the market square, the biggest of its kind in Europe. I fell in love with the city. I am a history student and I know about the two World Wars. From Krakow, after a three-hour journey by train, one reaches Auschwitz, the biggest concentration camp in Poland during Nazi Germany?s rule. The weather here is always gloomy, cloudy and sometimes rainy. 

 Whether you know the history of the place or not, you go there and you see it all and you feel it in the air, the mass murders that took place. Alone and at the age of 20, it made a huge impact on me that I?ll never forget. I met an old man from the US. He was 14 when World War II ended and he saw the pictures in paper and promised himself that he would visit the place one day. He finally made it. Tourists break down and cry there. It?s not easy to take it all in.

 The entire city of Krakow lives the history. Any traditional Polish family will ask you if you have visited Auschwitz. There is a guide there who is a survivor of the camp. Everything is just the same here. I walked along the river with some fellow travellers and crossed the bridge into the Jewish ghetto. It was a powerful experience. The town square in Krakow is the biggest in Europe. And romantic, especially for a lone traveller.

 Our last two days in Poland was spent in Warsaw with a Polish family who hosted us. The lady of the house cooked Polish food for us and gifted us two kgs of chocolates and two litres of Polish vodka! We spent our night packing and repacking. I ended up leaving behind clothes to make space for the goodies!

 The Diary

 The Silent I

 As dew drops trickle on paths 

 awry, 

 Across the woods on the Himalayan high, 

 A silent voice greets my heart 

 Through the blue canopy of the askance sky. 

 I feel, I ignore it. 

 I walk down the jungle with my spirits high. 

 Suddenly I stop; I don?t know why; 

 And realise that the truth of beauty is not in the grandiose 

 of grosser lies...

 There is something deeper, something subtler, 

 That beats with my heart every time. 

 I don?t know what, I know not why 

 But there is a voice that is the calling of the blissful 

 ?I?.

 Across the blue seas and Himalayan high, 

 Over the plains and communities that thrive, 

 There lies this beauty of the silent ?I?.

 It?s not for you but someone else...

 I can only live with your memory

 With you in my thoughts

 Till tomorrow takes over and 

 There is someone else

 Or more

 And there is no reason or incentive to remember you

 Since memories are only a game to pass time with

 Empty time

 That now takes over from then

 And I forget you

 Happily enough

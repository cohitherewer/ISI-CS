The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 In search of spirited shows

 Jhoom cultivation 

 on the steps of Himachal Pradesh created by Suruchi 

 Sangha in New Alipore. The crowd is under CCTV monitoring.

 Kidderpore-New Alipore

 An example of a near-perfect 

 effort falling to the compulsions of a clever theme is 25 

 Pally. The electricity management draws kudos for overload 

 protection, with circuit-breakers for each switch. Even 

 the giant generator is soundproof. But the bid to reproduce 

 the inside of a conch shell (the pandals shape) stifles 

 the interiors. A feeling of claustrophobia is also the problem 

 under the fibreglass ceiling of 74 Palli as well.

 Scoring for homely ambience are Pally Saradiya and Kolahal Goshthi, both works of artist Suman Basak. The formers effort is even more praiseworthy as the organisers were wading through knee-deep water till the weekend. So the fire-retardant is yet to be sprayed on the mats (sitalpati) making the Devis platform. 

 Suruchi Sangha, taking Calcuttans to Himachal Pradesh, was the star on this leg of the True Spirit tour. The New Alipore puja has installed CCTVs at 12 points in the heavily-insured pandal to keep an eye on power points and pandal hoppers.

 Kasba-Picnic Garden

 From a Jaisalmer palace to Raghurajpur 

 village of Orissa, from artistic to quirky, the route provided 

 a cross-section of pujas.

 The highlight was Rajdanga Naba Uday Sangha in Kasba, which has everything going for it, from decor to facilities. Sahidnagar Sarbojonin impressed with effective crowd management. Bosepukur Sitala Mandir has made innovative use of burnt brick rings used in wells with terracotta artwork from Bankura as decoration. Neighbouring Bosepukur Talbagan Sarbojanin, showcasing Madhubani art, shows true Puja spirit in undertaking various social service programmes in the locality.

 Eco-friendly material like jute, straw mats and clay have been used predominantly and organisers seemed clear about the need for the fire-prevention measures being taken. Only a few pujas seemed to be struggling to keep pace with the True Spirit movement. 

 The idol at Shib Mandir

 Market

 According to local connoisseurs, 

 the standard of pandals on the streets of south Calcutta 

 has never been higher. A typical example of the high standards 

 was exhibited at Mudiali Club. This year we wanted to create 

 a pandal that resembled an old colonial building, said 

 club secretary Sujoy Ghosh. So the glass windows and ornate 

 lamps.

 The Ballygunge Cultural Association displays a detailed mosaic effect on the whole pandal, a water-lined approach to the idol with fish swimming around in the two large moats created on either side. Music plays an important role here.

 Ballygunge Sarbojanin Durgostab Samity in Maddox Square is, as usual, one big fun fair. The main theme of the pandal was the beautiful game, with every manner of net and football hanging from the ceiling. An impressive edifice, but err, what is the puja point?

 The pandal at 27 Pally Sangha seems to have been severely hit by the rains, with vital work still on. The dragon motif that characterises the stage, though, is most impressive.

 While some pandals have taken on titanic proportions, others have opted for a more low-key, homely feel. The Lake Youth Corner Puja Committee is a small, refined pandal, with wooden wicker exterior and muted colours. The papier mache pandal at Pratapaditya Road-Trikon Park deserves special mention, with a waterfall for good effect.

 New Market- Amherst Street

 The 97-year-old Brindaban Matri 

 Mandir Puja, Sukeas Street, is well organised and attractive. 

 Constructed entirely with bamboo, the pandal is well-decorated 

 and houses exquisite, traditional idols.

 Madhya Kolkata Sarbojanin, near Medical College and Hospital, is another long-running event. Access from the main street is nice and easy and the puja has good medical facilities and fire-fighting equipment on site. The organisers are numerous and helpful. In its 48th year, the Ram Mohan Smitri Sangha has opted for an eco-friendly theme sporting a pandal intricately patterned with seashells.

 The Interact Club at Chowringhee High School, Sudder Street, has been organising a puja for 10 years. The teenagers stress their commitment to year-round social work in the neighbourhood. There are toilets on the premises, along with first-aid facilities. The puja is held inside the school and whilst the setting is modest, this is one puja that is certainly striving towards the true spirit of the festival.

 Maniktala-Beadon Street

 The north Calcutta pujas like 

 Maniktala Chaltabagan Lohapatty and Nalin Sarkar Street 

 manage to score high marks again, in keeping with the essence 

 and norms of celebrating Durga puja. While Nalin Sarkar 

 Sarbajonin manages to infuse an ethereal feel with optimum 

 provisions, the Chaltabagan puja with its striking Surya 

 Rath has turned out to be quite a crowd-puller equipped 

 with adequate first-aid and safety measures and also proper 

 seating arrangements for the aged.

 First-time True Spirit participant Azad Hind Bag Sarbojanin Durgotsav at Hedua displays a shocking lack of puja spirit live pigeons with clipped wings adorning brackets on the walls of the pandal. The steep slope at the exit is most precarious. Beadon Street Sarbojanin has traditional idols of the deity towering well above the prescribed 12-ft mark. Both Goabagan Sarbojanin and Kashi Bose Lane have taken adequate measures to safeguard their elaborate pandals against fire, but failed to provide for proper drinking water and waste management.

 Simulia Sarbojanin leaves a blank mark with a lone pandal and the organisers missing in action. But a bunch of young volunteers at Tekiapara Sarbojanin in Maniktala, with their innovative concept of a pandal wrapped in saris, conforms to most of the parameters of the True Spirit of the Pujas. 

 Garia-Kudghat

 Amader plan-ey achhey, 

 they will be installed by evening. That was the standard 

 answer in most of the 10 pandals on this route. Provisions 

 for drinking water, first aid, even fire management unfortunately 

 remain secondary must-dos at pandals where one otherwise 

 wished there were marks for artistic excellence, like the 

 make-belief ancient Durgadalan built by Nehru Colony. 

 But sometimes where the so-called big pujas like the Garia Sarbojanin (Nabadurga) failed, small pujas seemed to set an example. The Naktala Udayan Sangha pandal, designed exquisitely by Susanta Pal using patterns with ropes, strings and cloth, also had all the True Spirit requirements. They had provisions for the disabled and contributed to social causes. So did Putiary Sarbojanin Durgotsav which apart from exploiting sar reeds as an artistic medium had a wheelchair, trained nurse and fire-fighters on the premises. 

 Golf Green Sarbojanin had Mohanbansi Rudrapals idol and had taken care of all True Spirit requirements but for some unknown reason they had installed a narrow rickety bridge for viewers to cross at their peril.

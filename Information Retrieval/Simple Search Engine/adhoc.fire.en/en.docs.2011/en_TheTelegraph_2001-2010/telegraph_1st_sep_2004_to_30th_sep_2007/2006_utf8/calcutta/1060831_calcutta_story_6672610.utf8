The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Lack of upkeep behind flooding

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 The mayor might cite the rainfall figures to justify waterlogging in the city, but a Calcutta Environment Improvement Project (CEIP) report puts the blame squarely on the civic body and the state irrigation department.

 The CEIP, which is funded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), claimed in the recently-published report on the citys drainage and sewerage condition that the waterlogging is largely a man-made phenomenon in the city.

 According to the report, besides the volume or intensity of rain, there are five human factors, like lack of maintenance of pumps, their low capacity, poor condition of valves and lockgates and back flow of water from delivery channels that aggravate the waterlogging in Calcutta.

 Acting chief engineer (drainage and sewerage) N.R. Samanta admitted that the current drainage capacity of the sewerage network in the city is 6 mm, half the capacity of a century ago, but declined to accept the charge of laxity on the part of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC). 

 According to civic engineers, during showers, the water flows down the underground drainage pipes to the canals in and around the city and finally to the Hooghly in the west and the Kulti Gang in the east. While maintenance of the underground sewer lines and most of the pumping stations is the CMCs responsibility, the maintenance of the outflow channels and the canals belong to the irrigation and fisheries department. 

 CEIP experts, who did not want to be quoted, observed that reduction in the citys drainage capacity by half means doubling of the waterlogging problem. The drainage capacity would not have come down if the pumping stations were overhauled and outflow channels desilted at regular intervals, they asserted.

 The Hooghly is connected with the citys pumping stations through Tollys Nullah, Manikhali and Churial canals, Bagjola, Circular, Kestopur and Town Head-cut canals and Storm Water Flow and Tollygunge-Panchannagram channels connect Kulti Gang with the drainage network.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 A crore for vectors

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has allotted Rs 1 crore for the purchase of equipment to fight dengue and malaria.

 At an unscheduled meeting on Monday, municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay also ordered the civic health department to activate the health management information system (HMIS), which was started during the dengue outbreak last year.

 Chief municipal health officer (CMOH) Deb Dwaipayan Chattopadhyay and executive health officer of borough 1 T.K. Mukherjee have once again been entrusted with running the programme.

 The building, drainage and sewerage and the civil engineering departments have been asked to take part in the vector control programme.

 As part of the HMIS, health officials at the borough level have been directed to prepare reports on the status of mosquito-control activities, new cases of dengue or malaria and the most vulnerable pockets. 

 The CMOH will have to collate the reports and provide daily updates to the mayor and the municipal commissioner.

 ?We know that due to the sustained effort of the civic health officials and the field staff, dengue and malaria are under control in the city. But we don?t want to be complacent. Prevention is always better than cure,? said mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya on Wednesday. 

 Twelve people died of dengue and three of malaria in the city in 2005. 

 Encouraged by the success in bringing down the malaria death count, the civic authorities in January announced a programme called ?Target 0? to prevent any deaths due to the disease this year.

 According to the municipal commissioner, the dengue outbreak last year was sudden and the CMC was forced to undertake vector control activities on a war footing from August to November. ?For better results, we have decided to undertake intensive vector control activities from June-July to November,? stated municipal commissioner Bandyopadhyay.

 Air club bids on Oct. 30

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The bids of the two private companies vying for the Behala Flying Training Institute will be opened on October 30.

 The five-member committee set up to assess the offers of the Pailan Group and Manpower Development amp; Management Private Limited held its first meeting on Monday. 

 We discussed the issue in the presence of the representatives of the bidders. The committee decided that the offers were in order and the bids would be opened on October 30, said Sumantra Chowdhury, transport secretary and convener of the committee.

 The panel includes a representative each of the director-general of civil aviation (DGCA), Airports Authority of India, air force, and the state transport and finance departments.

 The Transport Infrastructure and Development Corporation had invited expressions of interest from private firms in June for taking over the flying institute. Pailan and Manpower had submitted their bids, but the government decided to scrap the tender on the grounds of unsatisfactory response.

 However, following transport minister Subhas Chakrabortys talks on the matter with CPM state secretary Biman Bose, the government announced that it would go by the advice of experts.

 Officials said the committees decision to open the bids suggests that the contract would be awarded to one of the two firms.

 Besides opening the bids, the committee will view video presentations of the companies on their efficiency and concept plans for running the flying club.

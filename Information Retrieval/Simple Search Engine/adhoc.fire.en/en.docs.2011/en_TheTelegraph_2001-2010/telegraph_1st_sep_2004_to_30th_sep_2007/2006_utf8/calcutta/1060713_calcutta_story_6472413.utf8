Voice box wows

Screen On amp; Off

 Garfield, that feline staple of kid?s TV and newspaper comic strips, is about to take a stroll down the red carpet later this year in Garfield: A Tale of Two Kitties. Following the success of the 2004 live-action film, Bill Murray will be reprising his role as the voice of the world?s laziest cat. Murray?s vocal turn is no doubt a major draw at the box office, adding yet another chapter in the recent trend of leading actors lending their voices to animated characters.

 A moment from Lion King

 For years, voice actors were the forgotten stars of Hollywood, a job in which an actor?s voice would have to match the usually hyperactive on-screen events move for move. For all their vocal exertions, they seldom became household names. With the exception of Mel Blanc, the voice of Daffy Duck, the men and women behind some of the most famous animated voices never got recognised.

 The spotlight came to voice actors as late as The Simpsons, when it became simply impossible to ignore the vocal talents of people such as Dan Castellaneta (The voice of Homer Simpson and many other characters) and Nancy Cartwright (Bart and Lisa Simpson ad infinitum). Even this fame was somewhat obscure, with Cartwright eventually ceasing to perform Bart?s voice for kids off screen, as many were upset that ?Bart? was actually a middle-aged Scientologist from California.

 The Nineties were good times for voice acting. The desirability of the role increased ten-fold, enough for many established actors to surrender to the drawing board. Typically, Disney was at the forefront of this change in fortunes for voice acting. With the almost monolithic influence in the realm of animated feature films, Disney enlisted the increasingly mawkish Robin Williams to be the Genie in 1992?s monster hit Aladdin.

 Inspired, many actors of similar standing jumped at the chance to be involved in Disney?s next major venture, The Lion King. Boasting a strong voice cast ? James Earl Jones, Matthew Broderick, Jeremy Irons and Whoopi Goldberg ? The Lion King went on to become an even greater hit than Aladdin.

 The true watershed was yet to come, with Toy Story not only proving that 3-D computer animation was pointing the way to the future of animation, but further establishing voice acting as a fashionable and respected medium for actors. Tom Hanks, an actor at the peak of his powers at the time of Toy Story?s production, was a crucial recruit, and he turned in a decent, distinctive performance for his character Woody. Tim Allen?s extroverted performance as Buzz Lightyear was a perfect riposte to Hanks?s typically understated effort.

 Perhaps the most star-studded of any animated casts was 2002?s Shrek, with Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz and Mike Myers providing their voices for Pixar?s biggest hit to date. Shrek was the first winner in a new Oscar category for Best Animated feature film. Shrek 2 then went on to become the biggest grossing animated film of all time, raking in $920 million, well over double of what Toy Story grossed in 1995.

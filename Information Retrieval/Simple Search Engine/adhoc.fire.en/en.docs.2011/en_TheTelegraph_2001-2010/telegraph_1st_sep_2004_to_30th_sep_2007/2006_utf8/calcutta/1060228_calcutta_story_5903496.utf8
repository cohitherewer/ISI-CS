The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Heat hits a new high

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The mercury soared to record heights in the city on Monday, even as weathermen warned of no relief for at least the next 48 hours.

 The day?s maximum temperature shot up to 38.4 degrees Celsius, seven degrees above normal, past a 54-year high. The highest recorded temperature in February was 36.7 degree Celsius, registered on February 23, 1952.

 Around end-February, the maximum temperature generally stays below 30 degrees, while the minimum hovers around 17 degrees.

 ?The moisture content in the air is very low for this time of the year. Hence, the sun?s rays are hitting the ground directly, pushing up the temperature,? explained G.C. Debnath, director of the weather section at the Regional Meteorological Centre in Alipore.

 According to him, the incursion of moisture is less than usual this February, as no strong low-pressure troughs, which attract moisture-laden wind, have been created. ?Low-pressure troughs are quite normal around this time,? Debnath stated. 

 The Met officials also attributed the rise in temperature to a change in the wind pattern. For more than a week, dry, warm winds from Orissa, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat have added to the heat factor. 

 ?We need the wind to blow in from the north or the east to bring down the temperature,? said an official. ?Around this time, an easterly wind sometimes brings in moisture from the sea and leads to rain. Under the present circumstances, rainfall seems a remote possibility.?

 Adding to the temperature torment in vast areas of south Calcutta was the bursting of a 33KV feeder cable at Jadavpur sub-station, around 8 pm. 

 The entire belt was plunged into darkness and supply was only restored late on Monday.

 Troubleshooting 

 tips for video worries

 techtalk

 A screen projects images from Xboxs 

 new game FIFA World Cup Germany 2006 as Microsoft Japans 

 Xbox division general manager Takashi Sensui speaks 

 in Tokyo recently. Microsoft said Xbox 360 game console 

 users will have more than three times as many game titles 

 available by December. The move is seen as preparation 

 for an upcoming battle with Sonys PlayStation 

 3. (Reuters)

An 

 odd thing happened the other day. I had just reinstalled 

 my operating system (Windows 2000) and some of my video 

 files just wouldn?t play on Microsoft?s own Windows Media 

 Player.

 The files had ?.mpg? extension 

 and had worked fine with both Windows Media Player 9 (the 

 most advanced version of the player for Windows 2000) and 

 Windows Media Player 9 (the default player included with 

 the operating system) before the OS reinstall.

 But now they only threw up error 

 messages.

 Quite a bit of Googling and tech 

 forum hunting later, a simple and lightweight (only 213 

 kb) piece of software helped locate the cause of the problem, 

 and more importantly, a solution.

 Gspot (www.headbands. com/gspot) 

 not only identifies the video format of a file, but also 

 manages to come up with the name of the video codec required 

 to play the file.

 A video codec is a software module 

 that enables compression of video. Since raw video takes 

 up a lot of space, for delivery over Internet, it is always 

 compressed into some format or another.

 In this case, Gspot analysed the 

 files and reported that they had been marked with the wrong 

 extension. In fact, the ?.mpg? files were actually Windows 

 Media Video files that should have been marked ?.wmv?.

 Due to the presence of standalone 

 codecs that might have been installed at some point, Windows 

 Media Player 9 had been able to play them. But a fresh installation 

 brought things into perspective.

 So for acute video-related ailments, 

 try Gspot or other troubleshooters like VideoInspector 

 (http://www.kcsoft wares.com/?vtb), MediaInfo 

 (http://mediainfo.sourceforge. net/), and AVICodec 

 (http:// avicodec.duby.info/).

 The business of video formats 

 is rather tricky with several formats, encoding techniques 

 and tools in use and several media players to play them. 

 Here are some common file formats you will encounter while 

 trawling through the Internet: 

 Windows Media Video (.wmv), 

 Advanced Systems Format (.asf), Audio Video Interleave (.avi): 

 Windows Media Player 9 (www.micro soft.com/windows/windowsm 

 edia/player/9series/default.as px) can handle all of 

 these. Older versions of the player, like 6.4, can also 

 do the trick, but only after installing necessary codecs 

 from the Internet. 

 (Quick tip: after you instal Windows 

 Media Player 9 on Windows 2000, you won?t find any trace 

 of the earlier version, 6.4. To access the old player, click 

 on Start and then Run. In the dialogue box, type ?mplayer2?). 

 Another option is the Media Player 

 Classic (http:// sourceforge.net/projects/guliv erkli/).

 Real Video (.rm): You?ll 

 need Real Player (www.real. com) for this proprietary 

 format from Real and for playing Real Audio files (.ra). 

 Or, try Real Alternative (www.free-codecs.com/download/Real_Alternative.htm)

 QuickTime video (.mov): 

 Apple?s proprietary format. It plays with the QuickTime 

 player (www.apple.com/quick time/download), which 

 is bundled with the iTunes software (www.apple. com/itunes). 

 Non-Apple fans can try the QuickTime alternative from www. 

 free-codecs.com/download/Qu ickTime_Alternative.htm.

 DivX (.divx): Fast gaining 

 popularity for compressing entire movies into one CD without 

 compromising much on quality. You?ll need the DivX player 

 from www.divx. com to play these files.

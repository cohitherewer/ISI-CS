 From earthen diyas in traditional 

 shapes to designer candles with exotic aroma, theres 

 no end to the variety of wax and wick wonders that promise 

 to duel the dark.

 With a day to go for the festival 

 of lights, its time to fill up your space with lights, 

 lights and more lights. GoodLife goes Diwali shopping.

 Candles

 Candles at Nik-Nish come in various 

 shapes Christmas trees, stars, crackers and explosives. 

 The large ones boast three-to-four-hour durability. Handmade 

 candles shaped like fruits such as orange, apple, lemon 

 and mango boast the colour and aroma of the specific fruit. 

 There are some candles designed with images of Ganesh, Swastika, 

 Om, Shree and other religious symbols.

 oating candles seem to be the 

 rage this season, in different hues and shapes like flower, 

 ice-cream and more. Some are placed inside aluminium moulds, 

 fruit baskets, crafted wooden boxes and coconut shells.

 We decided to do away with 

 the block candles that come in every year and go for something 

 different. Small candles in aluminium moulds dont 

 stain the floor and are less messy, says Gautam Jatia, 

 CEO of Landmark.

 The Lord Sinha Road store boasts 

 quite a collection of imported, scented floating flower 

 candles priced between Rs 15 and Rs 49. 

 Giggles on Park Street has a wide 

 selection of designs like mocktails, flower candles atop 

 fish-shaped coconut shells, snails, shoes, balls and watermelons. 

 Bedecked with sparkles and available in vibrant hues of 

 pink, orange, red, green and blue, most are perfumed. These 

 are available in pretty sets of two or three.

 Gel candles last longer than their 

 wax counterparts and the drip-free factor is a bonus. At 

 Pantaloons, the range is not elaborate but serves the purpose. 

 Translucent in nature, the base of gel candles are adorned 

 with tiny shells, coloured stones, sea-horses and thermocole 

 fruits, and take the shape of long cylindrical glasses or 

 champagne bottles. They are priced between Rs 25 and Rs 

 150.

 Diwali platters with candles, 

 kapur, Gangajal, haldi, an idol and other 

 puja items are also available.

 Diyas

 Nothing seems to match the festive 

 appeal of the traditional earthen diya, with ghee as fuel 

 and cotton wool as wick. The market is flooded with diyas, 

 starting from Rs 2 and going into the thousands.

 At Landmark, artistically crafted 

 in leaf pattern, diyas are adorned with coloured kundan 

 beads. Ganesha earthen diyas, shankh-shape terracotta 

 wax diyas with auspicious threads, mirrors and ghungroos 

 are popular picks.

 Giant clay ornamental diya holders 

 at Nik-Nish and Landmark are a new entry this year. With 

 space to hold 21 to 50 diyas, they are just right for the 

 entrance.

 Like Christmas trees, they 

 can be re-packed into boxes and used next year, said 

 a shopper at Landmark. They are priced between Rs 1,400 

 and Rs 4,000. 

 Lanterns and figurines of lehnga-clad 

 women holding diyas are interesting decor pieces at Nik-Nish.

 Lamps

 While most people still opt for 

 traditional forms, others invest in electrical lighting 

 that lasts. Mahal Lampshades on AJC Bose Road has introduced 

 a new collection of illumination this Diwali. Wall-mounted 

 lights, chandeliers, childrens lights with cartoon 

 motifs, hanging shades, lanterns and floor lamps are only 

 a few of the lights on offer. A finish with Swarovski crystals 

 gives the lamps a designer look. 

 At Giggles on Park Street, electrical 

 lights in shapes of fruits are also in stock. Prices of 

 these bulb chains start from Rs 110.

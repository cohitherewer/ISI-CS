The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Marriage bureau in growth mode

 A STAFF REPORTER

 From the matchmaker and his scroll to knots tied over the Net. And now something that combines the best of both the maximum number of options with a personal touch. 

 Meet new-age matchmakers Sonika Dewan Dasgupta, Namrata Agarwal and Shweta Agarwal. The three from the Shaadi Point centres in the city have registered 10,000 members in less than a year. 

 Shaadi Point, the offline division of Shaadi.com, has 96 centres in 61 cities across India, including five in Calcutta. Suman Chattaraj, in charge of the regional headquarters at Chowringhee, said the company is planning to open another eight to nine centres in Calcutta by November, when it will hold a swayamvar. Also in the pipeline is a centre for pre-marital and wedding services. 

 Shaadi Point takes on women entrepreneurs who have 400-600 sq ft of commercial space and can invest Rs 5-10 lakh. They also need to have a pleasant personality and treat this as a full-time job. Women in the 35-45 age bracket are preferred for their maturity, explained Chattaraj.

 Namrata and Shweta, who run the Gol Park Shaadi Point centre, however, are in their early twenties and have brought about 25 couples together over the past year. We thought people would hesitate to talk to a couple of girls in jeans or salwar suits, but I guess they find our confidence reassuring, smiled Namrata.

 What makes Shaadi Point click? The privacy it offers is one of the reasons. A customer at the Gol Park centre said: There is no guarantee that my daughters picture and other details will not be misused after I put it up on the Net. Since the Shaadi Point database is only accessed by members and they have to produce proof of identity, it is much safer.

 Apart from proving their identity, Shaadi Point members have to fill up a form that helps run a search on 15 parameters like diet, occupation and complexion.

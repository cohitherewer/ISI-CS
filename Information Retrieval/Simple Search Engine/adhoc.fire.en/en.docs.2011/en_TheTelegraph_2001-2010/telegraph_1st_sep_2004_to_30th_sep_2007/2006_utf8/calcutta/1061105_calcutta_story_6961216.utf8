 section 

 A retrospective of Ingmar Bergman, 

 films revolving around Franz Kafka, an exhibition on New 

 Theatres and a visit by Chilean film-maker Miguel Littin 

 are some of the highlights of the 12th Kolkata Film Festival, 

 starting November 10. A package of 225 films from 53 countries 

 is making its way to the eight-day spread to be screened 

 at Nandan I, II and III, Rabindra Sadan, Sisir Mancha, Purbasree, 

 New Empire, Chaplin, Globe and the all-new Star theatre.

 Films have been sourced from Asia, Europe, North America, Latin America, Africa and Oceania. There will be 20 short films and five documentaries in the total of 225.

 We are getting more films and more delegates this time on a budget of Rs 1 crore, which is the same as last year, claimed chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on Saturday with festival chairman Soumitra Chatterjee by his side. We had asked the central government for funds but they didnt extend any help, added Bhattacharjee, keeping the festival details under wraps. The state government is pumping in Rs 65 lakh; the rest will be raised through sponsorships.

 The inaugural film on November 10 is Danish director Andres Thomas Jensens Adams Apples, earlier screened at Carlovy Vary.

 The unveiling will be marked by a new signature tune scored by the students of Roopkala Kendro and a fresh festival poster designed by Jogen Chowdhury. Among those present would be governor Gopal Krishna Gandhi, mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya, Nandan chairman Tarun Majumdar and Mrinal Sen.

 Around 90 delegates have confirmed participation, the star attraction being Littin, four of whose films will be screened as part of the Celluloid Diamonds section, alongside the works of Jan Nemec from the Czech Republic.

 The centenary tribute will feature two films by Luchino Visconti and four by Roberto Rossellini; eight films by Bergman will be shown in the Great Master segment. 

 Contemporary Chinese films, French comedies, a homage to Japanese director Shohei Imamura and a special tribute to Italian film-maker Nanni Moretti are the other attractions.

 A separate Discovery segment has been carved out to showcase Jeon Soo-il from South Korea, Patrice Chereau from France, and Bela Tarr and Zsolt Kezdi-Kovacs from Hungary.

 A bunch of childrens films to be screened at Sisir Mancha is coming in from Finland, Russia, Cuba, Chile, Sri Lanka, the US and Brazil. The Indian Select comprises 21 films.

 The aim of the festival is to promote film appreciation and film culture, and that to an extent is reflected in the local film industry, signed off festival chairman Chatterjee.

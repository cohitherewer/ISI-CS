 After grading around 150 heritage buildings in the first phase, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) is drawing up a plan to ensure the structures are properly preserved and the owners adequately compensated.

 The authorities have devised the concept of transferable development right (TDR) or floating floor area ratio to strike the balance.

 When a building is declared a heritage structure under Grade I or II(A), the owner loses his right to make any addition or alteration to the property. By introducing the TDR system, we want to provide some financial relief to the owners and also ensure that the buildings are well looked after, said municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay.

 Under the proposed system, the authorities will first calculate the extra floor space that a heritage building under Grade I or II(A) would have yielded, had it been demolished to make way for a new structure.

 If an owner gains 4,000 sq ft, he can add this to the sanctioned floor space of the building he intends to develop at some other place in the city. Or, he can sell the additional space to a developer, who can add it to one or several of his projects, explained an official.

 Before availing of the scheme, the owner will have to give an undertaking to the CMC that a certain part 25 or 30 per cent of the money to come from selling the extra space will be spent on preserving the heritage structure, said director-general (building) Gora Chand Mondol.

 The building department is working out the permissible limit of adding floor space in various pockets of Calcutta. The limit will vary from area to area. For instance, if a developer buys TDR on 10,000 sq ft, he will be allowed to use only up to 2,000 sq ft in a project coming up in the Park Street-Camac Street area. But if the project is on the Bypass, the extra space can be utilised at one go, Mondol pointed out.

 The CMC has categorised the heritage buildings under Grades I, II(A), II(B) and III. No change is allowed to buildings under Grade I and for those under Grade II, construction is allowed only on vacant space on the premises.

 Among the structures under Grade I are the houses of Rabindranath Tagore, Iswar Chandra Vidyasagar, Jagadish Chandra Bose, Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, Satyendranath Bose and Raja Subodh Chandra Mullick.

 Under Grade II A are buildings belonging to Bidhan Chandra Roy, Moulana Abul Kalam Azad, Sarat Chandra Bose, Ashutosh Mukherjee, Harinath Dey and Pankaj Mullick.

 A roof for needy children, a green canopy for the elderly and a bond between the two generations. On a sprawling two-acre plot tucked away in a village on the city?s outskirts, Anubhav-Kolkata is trying to give shape to a self-sufficient residential estate that cares.

 To raise funds for the project, the society is organising Art for Giving, a show in association with Spandan Art Gallery and ITC Sonar Bangla Sheraton amp; Towers, at the star address from March 10. Last year, Anubhav-Kolkata had garnered funds by hosting a fashion show with Bangladesh designer Bibi Russell.

 The three-day exhibition will showcase around 30 paintings by some renowned but mostly aspiring artists. Participants include those from the Government Art College, self-taught artists and a few names like Wasim Kapoor, Suhas Roy and Abhijit Dutta.

 The first phase includes a building ? the site is in Mousal village, behind the leather technology complex in Bantala ? which will house a dormitory for up to 30 girl children. Boys will be included in the day curriculum only.

 ?The villagers there are very needy and we hope to provide a shelter for children where they can have a square meal and also learn something that would help them stand on their feet. The plan is to make the children self-sufficient by giving them basic education and some vocational training,? says Doel Sen, who has conceived the project and plans to start off by the year-end. The chief patron of Anubhav-Kolkata is Rajasthan chief minister Vasundhara Raje.

 ?We will train the girls in housework so that they can get jobs as domestic help when they are 16 or 17 years old,? adds Sen. A free clinic for local people is also on the cards.

 The second phase of the plan involves building small cottages for senior citizens. ?It will be something like a home away from home. People with some money can buy the cottages and live there, away from the hustle bustle of the city. They can mingle with the children at the shelter, which will forge a grandparent-grandchild kind of relationship,? explains Sen.

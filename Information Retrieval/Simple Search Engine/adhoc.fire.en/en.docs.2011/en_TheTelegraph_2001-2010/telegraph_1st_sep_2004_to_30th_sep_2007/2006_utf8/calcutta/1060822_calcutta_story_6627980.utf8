 Students revel in virtual life

 - Web-based email helps schoolboys connect after hours 

 NABAMITA MITRA

 At La Martiniere for Boys, everyone is connected.

 Students of the school, the first in the city to introduce web-based email for all students and an interactive website, are gushing over their new virtual life.

 Its amazing, says Raghav Fomra, a Class XII student. Almost 10,000 people, including ex-students, entered the site since the launch last month. I could even contact a few former students I had lost touch with. 

 Says his classmate Akshay Dewan, who is also the proud president of the schools computer club that helped launch the virtual services: The network is working perfectly. The response from students is very good, as 2,500 email IDs are already in use. 

 Started on July 21, the service provides individual email IDs to all students above Class VIII. The website, www.lmbcal.com, allow students, current and former, and teachers to be always in touch. Beyond school hours. 

 We will soon increase the number of email IDs, says Sumit Shah, founder and CEO of You At, the company that is providing the service. An email address comes in the form of firstname.lastnameschoolname.com with a 50 MB capacity.

 Though many city schools and colleges have websites, they do not provide students with email IDs.

 Shah, an ex-student of the school, came up with the proposal. Members of the computer club of the school, especially Class XII students Dhawal Bavishi and Subhasish Deb, worked with him on the project. 

 An instant messaging service through the Net may be planned within six months. Also, they are looking forward to have colleges in their network.

 La Martiniere principal Sunirmal Chakravorthi, who welcomed the project, said that the mail service would go beyond academics. A student is always welcome to exchange ideas and innovations that may not be a part of the regular syllabus, said Chakravorthi. 

 Other institutions are eager to have such networks. Father T.V. Jacob, principal, Don Bosco Park Circus, said the school was planning such a network within a month or two. 

 You At has approached other schools. The service also provides access to SchoolScrool, a site that provides an online society of students and alumni of various institutions of the country. 

 The site is going to feature exam toppers, guidance counsellors and other experts who can help students.

 This network system can really benefit us, as we can relate to students of other schools as well as the teachers, which is a wonderful idea, says Abhishek Saraf of Lakshmipat Singhania Academy. He still does not have such a network in the school.

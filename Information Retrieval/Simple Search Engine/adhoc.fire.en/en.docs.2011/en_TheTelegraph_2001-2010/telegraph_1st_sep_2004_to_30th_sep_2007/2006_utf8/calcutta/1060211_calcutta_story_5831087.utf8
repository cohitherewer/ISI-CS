 Safety first in trader hub

 - Burrabazar call to combat terror tactics at unity forum

 A STAFF REPORTER

 We are all responsible for the situation in this area and we must collectively take the responsibility of improving it as well ? Tapash Roy, MLA of Burrabazar, summing up the mood and message of the ttforcity interaction between the people?s representative and traders in the Burrabazar-Posta area on Friday.

 The return of terror to the trade hub was the immediate concern, steps to make the place a safer and better place to work and live in was the larger goal.

 A senior member of the trading community, Haribansh Rai, was badly beaten up by local hoodlums on February 4. Despite Rai identifying three of his assailants, police finally managed to arrest them three days after the attack.

 ?We are scared of taking our complaints to police anyway because of the goons. Even when we do, they refuse to accept FIRs,? was a common cry from businessmen at the interaction.

 ?If police refuse to act, take up the matter immediately with senior police officials and approach the local MLA, MP or even the chief minister,? suggested Roy.

 ?But do not blame the cops alone. We are all responsible for the environment here. You as a trading community must get together and fight crime. You are scattered now and the criminals will only take advantage of it. You cannot afford to be scared,? the Congress MLA said.

 Agreed P.R. Goenka of Onkar Chitpur Vyabsayik Samity: ?The criminals are a part of our own society. The goonda system is also being funded by money from the trading community. Some traders feel it is better to buy peace for Rs 15,000-20,000. But we don?t want to pay these extortionists.?

 Along with complaints, suggestions poured in from the business community. These ranged from demands that complaint redress cells be set up by local people?s representatives like councillors, MLAs and MPs, to a call for stopping the ?stepmotherly? attitude of the administration towards the Burrabazar belt.

 Other issues brought forth were the need to rein in autorickshaws and prevent flesh trade rackets to thrive under the guise of beauty salons in the locality.

 ?Traders are largely self-sufficient. All they require is safety and security. There is a need to provide special protection to this trading zone,? summed up Roy.

 Saying it with dance

 - Montage 

 of images and music tells stories of people with HIV/aids

 ?Living with AIDS needs loads of courage and strength. Our presentation aims at boosting morale and spreading understanding,? said Sudarshan Chakravorty of the Sapphire Dance Company on Monday. 

 Sapphire, an experimental dance unit, along with two Calcutta-based NGOs, Sparsha and Saathi, is set to stage the premier show of Positive Lives at Gyan Manch on May 16. The montage of images, performance and music tells the stories of people living with HIV/AIDS, the social stigma and how difficult it is to lead a productive and dignified life under such circumstances. ?The project is a tribute to those who have perfected the art of survival in spite of pain, alienation and traumatic stigma. Those who have dared to say YES to life,? said the organisers.

 Initially sponsored by Saathi and Sapphire with partial support from Elton John AIDS Foundation, London, Positive Lives was also a part of the Silabha cultural programme for the 15th International AIDS conference in Bangkok, 2004. ?It was such a huge success that during a recent conference in Montreal, David Gere had devoted an entire paper on it,? said Chakravorty, who conceived the ballet. Joining him on stage will be dancers Dibyendu Nath and Paromita Saha. 

 Photographs that will appear on the background to accentuate the abstract dance were shot in various locations across Bengal and Orissa by fashion and art photographer Ranjit Sinha. ?It took us more than a year to give shape to the entire concept,? said Chakravorty. The main five scenes in the ballet were inspired largely by anecdotes and case histories supplied by different AIDS support groups and patients. 

 The surrealistic presentation works through a rich pattern of symbols, like the broken pot which remains empty even after life-giving water is poured into it, or the vertical screen that falls between two dancers blocking out relationships. ?One of the images of a dancer tossing up a red cloth that forms the AIDS symbol in air was adopted as the 2005 AIDS day campaign by the University of California,? said Chakravorty. The organisers hope to take the show to California and 30 Indian cities.

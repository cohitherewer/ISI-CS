 Pipe work cracks homes

 Residents of Sagar Manna Road 

 and its adjacent areas in Behala are living in constant 

 fear, as a few buildings have developed cracks following 

 laying of pipelines to revamp the drainage and sewerage 

 networks.

 The civic authorities have asked 

 the residents of the affected buildings to evacuate at the 

 earliest.

 While local councillor and borough 

 chairman Sovan Chatterjee (Trinamul Congress) said the CMC 

 would pay the rent for their temporary accommodation, the 

 private firm executing the project promised to repair the 

 buildings at its cost. Chatterjee said the contractors should 

 have been more careful while laying the pipelines.

 The scheme, part of the Calcutta 

 Municipal Corporation (CMC)s environment improvement project, 

 is being funded by the Asian Development Bank.

 Work for laying the pipelines 

 began in December last year and stopped midway in July. 

 It resumed a week ago, said Chhabi Pain, who has been living 

 in the locality with her family for 45 years.

 Yesterday, I asked the contractors 

 men whether they had taken adequate measures to ensure that 

 the old buildings were not damaged. They told me not to 

 worry but by the evening, huge cracks were noticed in our 

 building. The house subsequently tilted to one side and 

 the ground floor sank, Pain recalled.

 The family called the engineer 

 who was supervising the project. He asked us to vacate 

 the ground floor as soon as possible. They then fixed some 

 wooden poles to support the building, Pain added. 

 After a while, councillor Chatterjee 

 visited the area and requested the Pains to shift elsewhere. 

 I told them that the CMC would foot the bill if they moved 

 to an alternative accommodation for the time being. They 

 can come back once the repairs are over, Chatterjee said.

 Pain, however, is reluctant to 

 move. Finding an alternative accommodation is not easy. 

 Besides, both me and my 78-year-old husband are cardiac 

 patients. 

 Sanjib Karmakar, of the firm executing 

 the project, said houses close to the main road have been 

 damaged. The buildings that are at least four feet from 

 the road have not developed cracks. We have given an undertaking 

 to repair all the damaged buildings.

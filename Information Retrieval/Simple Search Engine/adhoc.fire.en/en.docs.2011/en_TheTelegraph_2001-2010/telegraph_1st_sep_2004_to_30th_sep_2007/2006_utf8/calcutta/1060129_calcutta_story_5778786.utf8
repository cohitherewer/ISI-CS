 Muddled marriage

For him, it?s like catching up with an old friend 

every time they perform. For her, their different approaches to the characters 

helps them spar better.

 On Friday evening, a near full house at GD Birla Sabhagar got to see how that relationship played out on stage when Mandira Bedi and Samir Soni turned into Seema and Anish for Anything But Love.

 Produced by Raell Padamsee?s Ace Productions and directed by Vikranth Pawar, Anything But Love is a ?romantic comedy? about an estranged couple who try to give their relationship another chance after bumping into each other several years post-divorce.

 ?It?s a peek into the lives of these two characters who can?t live with or without each other,? says Raell, who has visited Calcutta with productions like Two to Tango, Games People Play and Laughing Wild (also starring Mandira and directed by Pawar).

 But it took over 30 performances in India and Dubai ? ?I?ve lost count, it could be 35,? admits the producer ? for Anything? to reach the city. ?We always wanted to bring it here but the logistics somehow didn?t work out,? offers Raell. The Calcutta leg, presented by Spandan, has three shows from Friday to Sunday.

 There?s something special about the play, feel Mandira and Samir ? the only two actors in it ? that prevents it from becoming monotonous.

 ?I love my character,? says Samir Soni. ?In real life I?m an introvert. And through Anish I can do and say a lot of things I?d like to.? 

 As for his co-actor, Samir feels they?ve ?grown up together? through the play. ?We?re poles apart and there were lots of clashes early on. But she?s become one of my best friends,? offers Samir.

 ?Even if I?m sick, I?m completely into the play for the two hours on stage,? says Mandira, who lost her voice recently after a hectic shooting schedule for Sony?s Deal Ya No Deal.

 With Calcutta offering an audience which ?appreciates plays with substance?, the cast and crew hope the production will receive nothing but love here.

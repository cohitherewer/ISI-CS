 One of the most distinguished and prolific artists of our times, Paritosh Sen expresses through his works the sheer joy of spontaneous creativity. The ongoing solo exhibition of his paintings at the newly opened Gallery Royal presents a selection that bears testimony to the consistent quality of his works. Simple, colourful and with a direct appeal that can capture the imagination of the common viewer, they are, more often than not, laced with satire based on his observation of contemporary social mores. Sen depicts animal life with realism and rare sensitivity. However, much of his works bear a strong undercurrent of sexuality, that he discerns even in familiar, everyday situations. The woman talking on her cellular phone (picture above) is suggestive of erotic desire, and perhaps, an impatient anticipation of its fulfilment. At the same time, his portrayal of children, though unsentimental, reflects a naivete and innocence that borders upon the romantic.

When: Till April 30 (except Sundays); 3 pm - 7 pm 

Where: Gallery Royal, 30B Judges Court Road, 5th floor

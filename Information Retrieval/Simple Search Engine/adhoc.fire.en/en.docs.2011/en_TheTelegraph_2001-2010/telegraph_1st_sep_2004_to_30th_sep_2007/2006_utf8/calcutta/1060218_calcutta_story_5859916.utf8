 Bengal handicrafts are famous the world over for their intricate designs and delicate craftsmanship. Mrittika Foundation, an NGO promoting underprivileged rural artists, weavers and craftsmen, presents Leela, an exhibition that introduces to the urban milieu for the first time, a line of ethnic sarees, garments, dokra figurines, terracotta pieces and finely woven dhurries. Besides assisting the group of talented yet struggling artisans from various parts of Bengal by providing them shelter and the means to carry on with their ancestral vocation, the NGO also helps them with contemporary design inputs that enhances the marketability of their products. Created by these rural weavers and craftsmen at Mrittika, a novel crafts-village on the northern fringes of the city, the entire range of weaves and artifacts appeals to the taste of the discerning collector.

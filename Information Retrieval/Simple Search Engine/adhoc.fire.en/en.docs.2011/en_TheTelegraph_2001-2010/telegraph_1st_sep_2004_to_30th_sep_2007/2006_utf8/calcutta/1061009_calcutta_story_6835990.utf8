 There is more to an interview than knowing what the interviewer will ask The Telegraph Careergraph Career Talk Show on Thursday at Globsyn Business School in Salt Lake Electronics Complex, XI 11 and 12, Block EP, was about all this and more.

 More than 100 students lapped up the nuances, dos and donts of cracking the final test (tiring, testing and taxing for many). The topic: Group Discussion and Interview Soft Skills. The panellists: S.M. Devadason, management consultant, Docon Training Division, and Tushar Basu, director of Analytic Consultants.

 A brief Art of Living session by Atika Khandia stressed the need for a good mindset. To be a good manager, employee or entrepreneur, peace of mind is a must Live in the present, dont carry baggage from past or future, said Atika.

 The talk show moderated by Rita Bhimani took off from there. Our parents think the world of us. We are either LC (lakkhi chhele), LM (lakkhi meye) or LB (ladla beta) for them. But the truth remains it is a wide wicked world and it is professionals you are judged against, began S.M. Devadason, who hit it off with the audience with a combination of one-liners, lengthy explanations and crisp humour.

 First up, touching upon the nuances of group discussion. Your confidence, clarity, assertiveness and role (i.e. initiator, system generator, focus generator) are observed. Remember to be clear and brief, disagree pleasantly, summarise fairly and analyse intelligently, prescribed Devadason. 

 Next, interview basics. Many are called and few chosen most candidates fail much before the interview remember the interviewer is trying to decide on your suitability for his company not for a day or week but a long time you and only you can sell yourself. Get your basics right some research on the organisation, getting your papers in order, planning dress and appearance, being rested and fresh, arriving well in time, appearing confident, looking pleasantly at the interviewer, answering each question calmly and, finally, looking at the questioner but answering to the panel.

 Your curriculum vitae (CV) is your identity. For a fresher it should not be more than two A4 sheet papers Keep it simple and neat, continued the management consultant. Some questions are generic and can be prepared before hand. Sample this: Tell us about yourself... Why do you want to work with us... Tell us about your weaknesses...

 Analyse your strengths and weaknesses. Make questionnaires for yourself. Practise interviews and group discussions, stressed Basu. A good way to practise is in front of the mirror, added Devadason.

 When we recognise our weaknesses does it have a negative impact on the interviewer, asked a student. A certain amount of introspection is a must. Select your weakness intelligently. Answer positively, replied Basu. A quiz session rounded off the event. Informal discussions are really beneficial. We ask questions and blurt out things we normally would not, said participant Dilshad Ahmed Khan.

 We would love to participate in more such sessions, smiled Priyanka Prasad.

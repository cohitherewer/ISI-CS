The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Targets of cell tease

 OUR BUREAU

 A 40-year-old teacher in a city school was receiving at least 10 blank calls and 20 text messages from an unknown number every evening. Tired of ignoring the calls and messages, she confronted the caller one evening and asked him not to disturb her anymore.

 We are just calling you up, said the unknown caller, who started harassing her from a new number from the next evening.

 As the cellphone revolution spreads far and wide, women are fast becoming the target of lewd telephone lines and the harassment count is rising alarmingly.

 With the number of complaints of cellphone trouble from women in various age groups crossing the 200-mark every month, police have decided to mount a crackdown on crank callers.

 Tracking the caller is not a problem for us. We can easily trace the address and handcuff the troublemakers, asserted Gyanwant Singh, deputy commissioner of police, detective department.

 Preliminary data collected by police indicates that crank call crime is more rampant in south Calcutta than in other parts of the city. 

 It has also been observed that shop-owners selling recharge coupons or top-up cards are the primary source for collecting numbers of women subscribers.

 Armed with these facts and a number of complaints, police have decided to go an overdrive in the coming weeks and book the bad boys.

 They will be booked under the Information and Technology Act, which has stringent provisions. It is a non-bailable section and attracts a minimum imprisonment of two years and a hefty fine, explained an officer.

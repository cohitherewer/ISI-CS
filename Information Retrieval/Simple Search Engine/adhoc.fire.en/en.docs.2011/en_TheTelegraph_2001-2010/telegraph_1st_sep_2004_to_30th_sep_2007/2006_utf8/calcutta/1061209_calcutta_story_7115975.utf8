 Cops and cops in fisticuffs

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Cops grabbed cop collars and engaged in verbal abuse and fisticuffs over unpaid allowance at the Divisional Reserve Office (DRO), on Park Street, on Thursday afternoon. One of the warring groups also ransacked furniture and threw away office documents.

 A complaint by policemen against policemen has been filed at Shakespeare Sarani thana.

 The incident has left the force red in the face, with senior officers trying hard to keep it under wraps.

 Ajay Kumar, deputy commissioner (south), whose office and residential quarters are in the same building as the DRO, said: There was an altercation between two groups of policemen. And the matter ended there.

 On being prodded, Kumar added: I will try to get the details.

 Sources said a group of policemen came to the office around 2 pm to inquire about the allowance bills they had submitted earlier. The cops lost their cool on being told that the bills had not been cleared.

 They demanded an explanation but personnel at the DRO, owing allegiance to the faction controlling Calcutta Police Association, said they were not bound to provide any.

 This sparked a fight, with collars being grabbed and punches being thrown. In the melee, some cops demanding their dues overturned tables and chairs, said an officer.

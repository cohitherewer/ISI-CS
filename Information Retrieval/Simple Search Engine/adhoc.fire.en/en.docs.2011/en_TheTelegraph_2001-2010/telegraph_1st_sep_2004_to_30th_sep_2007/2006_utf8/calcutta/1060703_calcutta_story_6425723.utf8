The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Life

 You cant 

 get through this week without

 Flaunting your football 

 frenzy

 Drooling over the jersey-clad 

 hotbods, sporting football-shaped danglers on your ears, 

 flooding the home with soccer knick-knacks, and finally 

 being glued to the television screen from 8.30 to 2.30 on 

 match nights to cheer ? you must let the FIFA fever rule 

 your life this big week. No ones asking you to understand 

 the intricacies of the off-sides or back heels, but being 

 on the ball is a must (must know: Zizou means Zinedine Zidane 

 means soccer guru). Also remember that OTT (over the top) 

 is the way to go these seven days.

 Getting yourself some 

 cool rain gear

 The monsoon might be acting 

 as coy as a Bollywood heroine before item numbers happened, 

 but that shouldnt stop you from spending time in malls 

 in search of some haute rain gear. After all, you must be 

 armed with the right tools to make a splash as soon as the 

 raindrops hit the ground. Must haves: a cool raincoat with 

 flashy floral prints, a see-through polka-dot umbrella with 

 a long stem that can double as a stylish walking stick, 

 rainwear sandals and high boots, a fold-up denim and a few 

 capris to save your bootlegs from getting soiled, a range 

 of waterproof basic make-up, and a few chiffon and georgette 

 saris for, ahem, special occasions.

 Catching Superman Returns

 The familiar red cape is fluttering 

 again as the Man of Steel comes storming back two decades 

 later in his red undies over blue tights. Bryan Singers 

 homage to the Richard Donner movies is evident in every 

 frame as Superman Returns in style on the big screen. 

 While Brandon Routh is lovable as Clarke Kent and passable 

 as the iconic hero, it is Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor who 

 shines as brightly as his bald pate. Dont miss the 

 opening credits as Jon Ottman redesigns the legendary John 

 Williams theme. Keep your eyes glued to the screen and ears 

 open for crowd comments like, Yeh Krrish ka baap 

 hai!. Watch it as a tribute to childhood fantasy, 

 or better still as a tribute to Christopher Reeve.

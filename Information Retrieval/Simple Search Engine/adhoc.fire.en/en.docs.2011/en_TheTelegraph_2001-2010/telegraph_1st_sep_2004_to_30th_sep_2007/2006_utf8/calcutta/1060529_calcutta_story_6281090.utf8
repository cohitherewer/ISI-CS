 Two persons from abroad have, in the recent past, published two books on Calcutta, against one by Nilina Deb Lal of this city, to whom goes the credit of producing the first handbook on our built heritage, published by Intach. 

 As to the foreigners, the first book is by Brian Paul Bach. It is so washed-out that it looks like it were salvaged from the Titanic wreckage.

 The second and more recent one, titled The Forgotten Palaces of Calcutta, by Joanne Taylor from Sydney, was launched on Saturday by Pratap Chandra Chunder, chairman, state heritage commission, Bengal government, and mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya. It is an encouraging sign that the faded glories of Calcutta are catching the eyes of foreigners, however casual that interest may be. 

 Taylor has worked under Jon Lang, who has done pioneering work on architecture in post-Independence India. 

 Chunder spoke of the thousand-and-more listed heritage buildings of the city, most of which are in a state of disrepair. The previous mayor was belligerently anti-conservation, dismissing the legacy of history as ?heritage-feritage?. 

 Although the destruction of old buildings, some listed, continues unabated, Bhattacharyya said since the government cannot afford to maintain heritage structures, he will seek funds from industry houses. Taylor?s book will come in handy as a ?weapon? to that end, he added

 He hoped the city will bounce back and billboards will not be allowed to be displayed in heritage zones even if revenue suffered as a consequence. He claimed: ?A few crores are nothing? where the beauty of the city is concerned.

 Taylor?s book tells the story of the ?comprador? urban rajas of Calcutta and their neglected palaces in the alleyways of north Calcutta. She has taken the photographs herself, but most are without captions. There is a section on the Andul Rajbari.

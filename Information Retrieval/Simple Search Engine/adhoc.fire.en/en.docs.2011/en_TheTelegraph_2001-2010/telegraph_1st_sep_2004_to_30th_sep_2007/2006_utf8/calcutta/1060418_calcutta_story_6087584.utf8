 A fracture or bone cancer

 SANJAY MANDAL

 Purna Roy suffered an injury in the upper arm while exercising at the gym. An X-ray revealed a hairline fracture and the arm was plastered.

 The plaster was removed a month later, but shortly thereafter, he received another injury while turning on the bed at night. The 18-year-old started having a severe pain and could not perform normal work. Detailed investigations revealed a tumour in the arm and a biopsy showed it was a primary bone cancer.

 Sourav Chakraborty was suffering from a pain in his knees. In his late 20s, Sourav works for a multinational company. A few months ago, he suffered a fracture in his knee while trying to get up from a chair, and investigations revealed that he had a bone tumour near his left knee.

 According to doctors, a fracture sustained by a trivial injury is usually an indicator of an underlying major bone disease that may even included malignancy. 

 ?It is usually not just a fracture, but something more serious than that. An early check-up can prevent the advancement of the cancer,? said Buddhadeb Chatterjee, orthopaedic surgeon of Apollo Gleneagles Hospital, Calcutta, who had operated on Purna. 

 The upper one-third of Purna?s right arm bone was completely destroyed. Whatever little was left of it was removed, along with the tumour. Purna, however, could retain his right arm following a massive reconstructive limb-saving surgery. ?We had lost all hope. But now our son can move his hand,? said his father.

 For reconstruction of the arm, a dispensable right leg bone was used.

 ?The thinner of the two bones of the leg was used for the purpose and normal functioning of the leg will not be affected,? Chatterjee explained.

 ?A fracture caused by a trivial force can either be osteoporosis or a space-occupying lesion,? explained P.K. Banerji, head of the orthopaedic department of Peerless Hospital. If an individual between 20 and 40 years age suffers such a fracture and has a continuing pain, it usually is a tumour,? Banerji said. 

 In case of malignancy, it can either be a primary tumour with roots in that bone or a secondary tumour, which is usually formed in some other part of the body and then spreads to the bone, doctors said.

 ?People suffering from such pain tend to take pain-killers and react only after a fracture. By then, it is too late,? Banerji pointed out.

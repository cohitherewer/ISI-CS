The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Strike cry echo in two hospitals

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The anti-quota protest in the city gathered momentum on Wednesday, with junior doctors of Medical College and Hospital on a daylong strike and their counterparts in two other state-run hospitals planning to follow suit on Thursday.

 ?The strike was against the police lathicharge on protesters on Tuesday and the Centre?s silence on the reservation issue,? said Debjit Shah, a hospital intern and member of the Calcutta chapter of Youth for Equality, the national body of anti-quota medical students and junior doctors. 

 The students and junior doctors will go on strike at Chittaranjan National Medical College and Hospital and SSKM Hospital on Thursday, said another Youth for Equality member. 

 A general body meeting of the organisation will be held during the day at Medical College and Hospital to decide the course of the protest. Other students have also been invited to be part of the movement.

 Services at Medical College and Hospital were partially hit by Wednesday?s strike. The interns, house staff and postgraduate trainees of the hospital did not attend to their duties in the outpatients departments. Senior doctors, however, were in attendance.

 According to deputy superintendent A.N. Biswas: ?Work in the emergency and other departments was not affected and no surgery was cancelled.?

 Patients narrated tales of woe. Kartik Nath of Haringhata, who had brought his two-and-a-half-year-old daughter to the outpatients department of ophthalmology, said: ?We had to sit for hours before the doctors attended to my daughter. She was getting restless.? They came to the hospital in the morning and could leave only at 3 pm. 

 ?My 11-year-old son is finding it difficult to pass urine. A local doctor advised us to bring him here. But we do not know how long we will have to wait,? complained Sandhya Basak of Maniktala, standing in a serpentine queue at 1 pm.

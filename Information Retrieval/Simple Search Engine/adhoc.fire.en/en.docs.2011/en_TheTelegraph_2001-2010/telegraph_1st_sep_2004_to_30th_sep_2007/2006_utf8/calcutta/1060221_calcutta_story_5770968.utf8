 Koena hit, Yana miss

 What: Koena Mitra making a guest appearance at Venom on Camac Street.

 The party: The Khullam khulla girl made her entry a little after midnight. Though it was just a guest appearance, she extended her stay to an hour. I performed at an awards ceremony in Nicco Park. I was quite exhausted and needed to unwind, said the sultry siren.

 Koena was soon unwinding on the dance floor, moving to Saqi saqi re and Khullam khulla. I am quite surprised at the party scene in Calcutta. So many nightclubs have come up in recent times, said the city girl who has made quite a mark in Bollywood.

 The party hoppers at Venom were more than happy to have Koena in their midst. Though her acting career may not have taken off, she is one of the best item girls around. I think her dancing skills and sultry looks work to her advantage, observed a party regular.

 Prior to her jig at Venom, Koena was on a Nicco Park stage for Sangeet Purashkar, an awards ceremony hosted by Zee Bangla. She danced to latest blockbusters like Deedar de, Dus bahane and Saqi saqi re. Her performance was followed by Aashiq banaya aapne-fame Himesh Reshammiya. I have tried to innovate with my music. There is a tribal touch to it. I guess that is the reason the songs are working, said Himesh. 

 What: Czech model and item girl Yana Gupta at the Lee Perfect Fit Contest party at Tantra on Saturday night.

 The party: A damper of sorts. The crowd thronged the Park Street night club expecting to share the dance floor with the Babuji zara dheere chalo girl. What awaited them was an anti-climax. Yana was supposed to make an appearance around 11.30 pm. As the crowd grew, so did the anxiety. But the lady ? who earlier in the day had attended the Lee contest also at Tantra ? remained elusive. She will be here in five minutes, was the common refrain from her public relations executives. 

 Yana finally made an appearance at 1 am. But by then, most party people had left for other night spots. She is hot, but Yana or no Yana, the party must go on, said a disc hopper.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Panel for stamp publication

 P.K. CHATTERJEE, chief postmaster-general of West Bengal Circle, met readers of The Telegraph in his office on Friday to answer their queries. Participants included Diptimoy Ghosh, Sreekumar Chattopadhay, Arun Ghosh, Koyel Bhattacharya, Md. Amiruzzaman, Sayani Ganguly, Debashish Ghosh and Sunil Agarwal

Diptimoy Ghosh: What is the philatelic advisory committee and who are its members? How can one become a part of the panel?

 Philatelic advisory committee is the apex body that determines the nature of stamps to be published by the postal department. It also decides the theme of the pictures to be embossed on the stamps. Eminent persons from the fields of arts, sciences, literature, politics and social service are generally made members of the panel. As of now, there is little scope for the general public to make it to the committee, which is under the direct supervision of the ministry of communication. 

Diptimoy Ghosh: In that case, how can we suggest themes for stamps?

 Anyone can directly write to the chief postmaster-general providing details of the suggested theme and, if possible, photographs relevant to it. We screen the proposals sent to us before forwarding them to the philatelic advisory committee.

 There are several instances of suggestions from the public being taken. For example, we received a proposal from a group of ordinary people regarding the publication of a stamp on singer Pankaj Mullick. We forwarded the suggestion to the committee and a postage stamp was issued in his name. Similarly, we acted on a suggestion to publish a stamp on Calcutta Girls? School to commemorate its 150th anniversary.

Sayani Ganguly: We have heard a lot about barefoot mailbag carriers known as runners. They apparently used to run from place to place at night to provide postal service. Does your department still employ runners?

 Technically, runners are mailbag carriers from one post office to another. They used to travel on foot at night carrying a lantern and traditional weapons like spears. Strictly speaking, runners no longer exist, though in some remote villages, postmen still travel on foot to deliver letters. Moreover, transportation of postal documents at night is not encouraged now.

Md. Amiruzzaman: Is there a regulatory authority for postal services to create a level playing field between government and private service providers.

 Till recently, only our department was authorised to provide postal service in the country. Now, several private companies are providing postal service as well. They are in a scramble to increase their business with scant regard for ethics and the law of the land. 

 In France, Germany, Belgium, and the UK, private operators are prohibited from delivering consignments below 150 gm. Moreover, these countries have a postal regulatory commission to strike a balance between private operators and government agencies. Thus the only distinguishing factor between the two sectors is the quality of service. In contrast, the government postal service in India has to abide by the labour laws, while the private operators rampantly flout rules.

Md. Amiruzzaman: What kind of laws do the courier companies flout?

 We have to pay deliverymen in accordance with the labour laws. Hence, there is a limit to our lowering of rate. Couriers enjoy a free hand. They exploit unemployed youths and don?t hesitate to offer them an absurdly low wage. Thus, they can provide the same service at a lower rate than us. You might be shocked to know that some couriers charge Rs 50 for quick delivery of a letter, but pay the deliveryman between 15 paise and Rs 1.50. The worst part is that the deliveryman is not paid if the addressee has shifted. Can you imagine the postal department treating employees this way?

 A self-taught artist, the paintings of Mihir Maitra depict innocent and frank emotive feelings of human beings. Lokayata, the ongoing solo exhibition of his works, features paintings that deal with traditional themes. Inspired by folk art of Bengal and Kalighat pata-chitra style of painting, his creations provide a picture of the moods, sentiments and attitudes of Bengal of the 19th and early 20th centuries. Mythological, spiritual and religious themes also find prominence (Bull Ride; picture above) on his canvases. His unique style of expression and uncommon compositions complement his rare virtuosity in handling colours, which range from muted and sober shades in some works to bright and flourescent tones in others. Love, both human and divine, is expressed with sincerity and candour. An interesting feature of Maitra?s works is his representation of babu culture. He portrays the reckless extravagance of the babus with great indulgence, rather than being critical of their wasteful habits.

 Suicide at girl?s doorstep

 - Spurned Calcutta youth shoots himself at dawn in Bandel

 OUR BUREAU

 Unable to come to terms with the end of an affair, a youth shot himself outside the Bandel (Hooghly) residence of the girl he wanted to marry on Thursday morning. 

 Biswajit Saha, Laltu to his friends (photograph on right), left his Azadgarh residence, under the jurisdiction of Jadavpur police, on his motorcycle at dawn and reached Kailashnagar around 5 am.

 ?I had just woken up and was seated by the window. I saw Laltu park his motorcycle in front of our house and call out for my granddaughter. Her mother opened the door and told him she was not home,? recalled Gopal Krishna Bhadra. 

 He continued: ?I wasn?t paying much attention thinking Laltu would leave, but was jolted by a gunshot. For an instant, I thought the sound came from somewhere else. However, Laltu had slumped to the ground and was lying in a pool of blood.?

 The couple knew each other for years. ?But for the past four or five months, the girl was trying to avoid Laltu as she had fallen for someone else. It seems that he committed suicide as he realised the relationship was falling apart,? said Subrata Das, a neighbour.

 Laltu, 23, was the youngest son of Subol Saha and worked in a private company. He lived with his parents and elder brother. His three sisters are married.

 ?He used to leave the house around 8.30 am, but today he said he had some urgent work to do,? said Laltu?s cousin Mousumi Chakraborty. 

 He appeared in fine spirits the night before and had purchased sweets for the family. ?Laltu was amiable and very popular in the locality. I can?t believe he committed suicide,? Mousumi added.

 Even the neighbours of the Bhadras expressed shock at the incident. They, along with the girl?s family, had rushed the youth to Bandel ESI Hospital. As Laltu?s condition deteriorated, he was shifted to Chinsurah Imambara District Hospital, where he succumbed to the injury.

 Inspector-in-charge of Chinsurah police station Pulak Sen Sharma said the girl and her family members would be interrogated. ?The body has been sent for post-mortem. We have seized the improvised gun used by Laltu. We will investigate how he got the firearm,? the officer said.

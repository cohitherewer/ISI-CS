 Church debut in nursing education

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 After achieving success in running schools and colleges, Christian missionaries are now set to enter the field of medical education. 

 Taking the lead, the Church of North India (CNI) has decided to open a nursing college in Behala. It will be the seventh nursing institution in the state, and the first to be controlled by the church.

 ?Most schools and colleges run by us in Calcutta and elsewhere in the districts have been highly successful in imparting quality education to students from all sections of society. We now feel we should open medical institutions to produce efficient doctors and nurses,? said Reverend P.S.P. Raju, bishop of Calcutta Diocese of CNI.

 The state government has already issued a no-objection certificate for the Behala institution, which will be called Florence College of Nursing. The Indian Council of Nursing, which regulates nursing education and curriculum in the country, will conduct an inspection by the end of April, Bishop Raju said.

 The institution, to be affiliated with the West Bengal University of Health Science, will offer a two-year B.Sc course in nursing. Candidates with a diploma in general nursing and midwifery will be eligible for studying the course. 

 Christian missionaries, despite their success in running some of the best medical colleges in southern states, could not open a centre in the city or the districts because of a state government law that prevented private groups from opening such an institution. The law was repealed only three years ago.

 Bishop Raju said if the nursing college functions successfully, the CNI will take the initiative in opening medical colleges.

 Apart from the CNI, other Christian organisations, too, are planning to open medical institutions in the city. One of them is Welland Gouldsmith Educational and Charitable Society, an organisation run by city-based Anglo-Indians.

 ?We have already prepared a proposal for opening a medical college,? said Rosemary Gillian Hart, principal of Welland Gouldsmith School and an official of the trust that runs the charitable society.

 ?We will approach the state government for land in the Rajarhat area or on Eastern Metropolitan Bypass,? she added.

 Father Peter Arulraj, priest in-charge of the educational institutions controlled by the Roman Catholic Church, said: ?The dioceses under the Roman Catholic Church functioning in Calcutta and in other parts of the state were unable to extend their services to the field of medical education due to certain technical problems. We will gradually extend our services to medical education once we find the situation here as favourable as in the south.?

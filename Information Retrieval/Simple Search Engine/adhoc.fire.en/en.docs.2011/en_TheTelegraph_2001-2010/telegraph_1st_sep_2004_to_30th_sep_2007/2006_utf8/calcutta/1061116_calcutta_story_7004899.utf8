 What: Cookery demonstration.

 Where: The Phoenix at The Saturday Club.

 When: November 7.

 The spread: It was back to school as members of the club jotted down instructions and tried to keep pace with chef Kaushik Saha from The Park, as he demonstrated live cookery. The food expert chopped, sliced and then stirred up delectable finger food, cocktail snacks and party poppers.

 First on the list was Potato Skin Filled Salsa Hollow Potatoes stuffed with Mexican-style Salad, spicy enough to suit the Indian palate. Then came the recipes for Mushroom Spring Rolls in Popiah Skin and Roesti Pizza. Non-vegetarian dishes included Parmesan and Vermicelli-coated Pomfret Fingers and Caribbean Grilled Chicken.

 The get-together was organised by The Saturday Club Entertainment Committee in association with The Park. Women dominated the audience, though a few men were spotted. The demonstration was interspersed with party tips and valuable cooking advice. A huge round of applause concluded the afternoon lesson followed by coffee and snacks.

 l club members were then offered a 10 per cent discount on any meal at Saffron at The Park. The Park was glad to be part of this event and chef Saha has some fantastic recipes and secrets that he was happy to share with The Saturday Club members, said Namrata Ray, assistant manager, events and entertainment, The Park.

 Voiceover: Our annual cookery demonstration is a wonderful way of getting the ladies together. It benefits not only the homemakers present but also their families, smiled Rajen Sood, joint convenor, entertainment committee of Saturday Club.

 South spread

 What: From Kanyakumari to Eden.

 Where: Eden Pavilion at ITC Sonar Bangla Sheraton and Towers.

 When: Till November 20.

 Take a look: Chef Jacob Sahaya Kumar, professor at Coimbatores Cherraans Arts and Science College, has brought to Calcutta a most evolved cuisine of Tamil Nadu. Naadar is popular for its unusual combinations: fish with okra, prawn with banana flower and lamb with aubergine. The presentation at Eden Pavilion is a melange of various food cultures of Naadars across different cities of Tamil Nadu.

 The spread: Start off with appetisers like Kari Bonda (minced-meat vada in typical Naadar style), Poonkothu Varuval (crisp-fried cauliflower florets) and Kanyakumari Meen Varuval (fish crusted with coriander powder and deep-fried). In the soups section, there is Sigappi Thakkali Soup (made from tomatoes, red chillies and Bengal gram flour), Aattukkaal Rasam (lamb leg) and Meen Rasam (fish and hand-pounded masala).

 In the main course, there are vegetarian curries like Keerai Thakkali Puli (spinach and tomato curry), Kasa Kasa Saalna (a thin curry made by simmering khus khus) and Thakkali Thengai Masiyal (tomato and coconut minced curry).

 Non-vegetarian curries include Vimalakka Kari Saalna (a thin extract made from lamb chunks) and Marryam Yeral Kolambu (prawn curry), Vaazhaipoovum Nandum (crab simmered in banana flower masala) and Sattampillai Meen Kolambu (fish curry made with only the heads).

 For accompaniments, you have Virudunagar Parotta (layered parathas, shredded and deep-fried) or Muttai Kothu Parotta (an adaptation of kathi rolls down south). There are vegetarian and non-vegetarian biryanis Mulangi Biryani (made with diced radish), Tirunelveli Thengai Biryani (with coconut), Kottar Kaima (minced lamb), Sattampillai Kozhi Biryani (chicken biryani) and Muttam Nandu Biryani (delicate biryani made from crabmeat and coconut milk).

 Round off your dinner with something sweet Mascoth Halwa (rice and green gram flour cooked in jaggery syrup), Karuppatti Seerani (jalebi made of rice flour and dipped in black jaggery syrup) or Thaen Kinnam (made of sweet potatoes).

 Pocket pinch: The dinner buffet is priced at Rs 800-plus.

 Voiceover: Though Chettinad food is the most well-known cuisine from Tamil Nadu, Naadar also has its set of followers. Thanks to people like chef Jacob, who has extensively travelled and learnt the intricacies of the cuisine, now we are being able to taste all these delicacies, said executive chef Ramesh Javvaji.

 Thai treat 

 What: Thai food festival.

 Where: Baan Thai at The Oberoi Grand.

 When: Till November 19.

 Take a look: In Thailand, its Loy Krathong or the festival of lights thats keeping the festive feel going for food-lovers and party hoppers. The festival is similar to Diwali, except for its duration a few weeks, instead of a single day.

 Baan Thai recreated the candle festival of Thailand, the years biggest, beginning on the first full moon night of November. 

 The spread: For starters, there is Kai Rue Koong Hor Bai Toey (marinated deep-fried prawn wrapped in pandana leaf) and Yam Hooa Plee (banana blossom salad with chilli dressing). Move on to the Khao Tom Soup (rice soup flavoured with ginger), Kaeng Phed (traditional red curry cooked with coconut milk), Phad Phak Morakot (stir-fried greens with garlic soya sauce) and Patani (stir-fried lamb with a dash of ginger, spring onion, pepper and mushroom). For dessert, indulge in Ngow Ice Cream Krati Sod (rambutan served with homemade coconut ice-cream)

 Pocket pinch: A meal for two would cost Rs 1,800-plus.

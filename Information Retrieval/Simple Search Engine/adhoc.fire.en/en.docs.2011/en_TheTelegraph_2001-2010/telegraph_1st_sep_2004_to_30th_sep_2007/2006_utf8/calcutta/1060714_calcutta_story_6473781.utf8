 Considered to be the vital link between perception and understanding, imagination is the stimulus that drives creative activity. Uniting the sense and the soul, it also summons up for the artist a world of magic, romance, adventure and excitement, which he tries to portray through images. Celebrating the free play of creative imagination, Masters of Imagination, the ongoing exhibition of paintings by well known artists, also attempts to highlight the way in which contemporary painters visualise and interpret their private and public milieu. Featuring works on diverse themes like social problems, relationships, temporality and spirituality, it attempts to help the common viewer understand all that moves and incites a creative mind. Participating artists include Ramananda Bandyopadhyay, Subroto Gangopadhyay, Prokash Karmakar, Kartick Chandra Pyne, Pramathesh Chandra, Suhas Roy, Sanatan Dinda (Yogi Purush; picture above), Bratin Khan, Aditya Basak and Sumon Sibsaday.

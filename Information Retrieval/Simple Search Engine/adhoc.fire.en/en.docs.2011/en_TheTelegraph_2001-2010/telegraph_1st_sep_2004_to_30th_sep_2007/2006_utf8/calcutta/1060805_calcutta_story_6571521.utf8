 Stage On Off

 At last someone in Calcutta even if a visiting US director, Brian Russo has staged Lorraine Hansberrys A Raisin in the Sun. A milestone in American drama, it became the first play by a Black woman to reach Broadway (in 1959) and the longest-running Black play on the Great White Way for 25 years (notching up 530 shows). It catapulted to fame such unknown actors as Sidney Poitier, Louis Gossett and Douglas Turner Ward. Some critics called it the Black equivalent of Death of a Salesman, but it was much more than just a slice of oppressed African-American life. It said something universal about deprived families striving for equality, proved by the predominantly White spectators who flocked to see it. 

 That is why Russo chose it, and why the audience on the opening night responded so warmly to the American Center-Spandan production. They recognised that we, too, have minorities that face segregation when house-hunting, and a lower class that encounters great difficulties making an honest living so the script needed no Indianisation. 

 The acting communicated the emotions earnestly. The quiet Meghna Mukerjee impressed the most, as the suffering wife. It did not surprise as much that Nivedita Bhattacharjee put in a strong performance as the matriarch. Dhruv Mookerji gave the cynical husband the right amount of desperation, and Pradipta Sarkar (his Afrophile sister) captured the percipience as well as self-importance of the educated. Unexpectedly, the juniormost actor, Rishav Ray Kumam (the grandson), appeared the sharpest in terms of knowing exactly what to do. Outside the family, Bikram Ghosh played the Nigerian student bemusedly, yet from the perspective of a not-yet-independent African. 

 Towards the end, the meticulously-coached Black accents began to waver, though not the body language. Russo himself made two false moves. He restored the utterly superfluous gossipy neighbour rightly deleted from the original text and made up Ghosh in blackface. What logic motivated the latter, since Mookerji is just as fair-complexioned? It almost seemed that Russo believes a real African should be blacker than African-Americans! The theatrical downside was that the soot rubbed off on Sarkars cheek when Ghosh kissed her. 

 Theatrecians first workshop culminated in two short presentations improvised collectively by the trainees. Both struck me by the morbidity of their themes, from necrophilia in the adulterous 64 Squares to suicide in the wittier Is It Real? Is It Fake?, and the violence the cast did to the furniture. However, their success can be measured by the fact that they contributed one actor to Russos team: Shadab Kamal, the only White character in Raisin.

 Fairy tale revisited

 Mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the fairest of them all? asks Snow Whites evil stepmom in the fairy tale. And when all efforts to be the one up fail, her face, distorted with anger, is so ugly that the mirror shatters. The mirror in Anindita Sarbadhicaris play, Mirror... Mirror, on the Wall, also shatters to bits in the end, but for different reasons.

 Less a play and more a personal pondering, this performance allowed itself to be shaped any way one chose. 

 With minimum props, the act opened with Anindita sharing notes with actress Shahana Chatterjee on the mirror and the power it has had over them since childhood. They recounted the torments they have endured, urged on by the reflected image. The actresses even asked the audience for their opinion before proceeding to introduce the first character, a nameless Bollywood star who had through surgery become a bombshell overnight.

 The bomb, played to the hilt by Shahana, stressed the need for commitment to attain physical perfection (which she equates with salvation). 

 But also revealed is her deep-seated fear that there may come a time when the body cannot be crafted into perfection any more and one has to give in to age. 

 A lot of this has come from real life experiences. From my social service work in Mumbais red-light areas, from stories I had read on the Net. The eunuch Asha was someone I had really met on a bus in Chennai a woman trapped in a mans body, said Anindita.

 Folk flavour for classical moves

 - CREATIVE ODISSI

 SEBANTI SARKAR

 An Odissi dancer at a performance

 It was introduced as an incentive, something to keep the young generation interested in classical dance, said dancer Sutapa Talukdar, about her recent experiment of blending classical Odissi with folk and other Indian dance forms at the Gurukul Creative academy.

 The academy, after a series of group presentations, staged Krishna Madhuri at Eastern Zonal Cultural Centres Bharatiyam on Monday. It will stage repeat solo performances at Rabindra Sadan on Tuesday and Madhusudan Mancha on September 5. At the Calcutta Port Trust anniversary bash on October 17, the academy will present Megh Utsav.

 There was a time when there was a demand for solo shows and as classical dancers we used to prefer that. So, solos were what I was urging my students to aim for. But that wasnt working because there was no one to sponsor solo shows anymore and the girls didnt want to work hard on mastering techniques that had no market value, the dancer offered.

 So, I decided to travel extensively in Ganjam and Mayurbhanj districts and assimilate attractive elements from folk dances and yogic and tantric postures, and used Tagore songs. I even began to bring experts of folk dance and music for workshops. The classical training has been going on simultaneously. My students seemed to realise that the sooner they learn the intricate classical footwork and mudras, the sooner they will be ready to try out the other styles, added Talukdar, who has distinguished herself after many years of training under Kelucharan Mahapatra.

 Krishna Madhuri was first staged two years ago, but it changed completely following Talukdars tryst with folk music and dance. The performance depicts the four stages in the life of Krishna Bal Gopal, the slayer of demons, the lover and the politician without whom the battle of Kurukshetra could not have been fought, explained the dancer.

 Not only have the sets and costumes been designed like the patachitras of Orissa, but the songs have also made extensive use of typical folk beats. Bichitrapuri saris, Ranihati khol and bits of the Mahabharata in Oriya enrich the production.

 It was always my intention to use hasya rasa for the interpretation of the Krishna legends. Here, the folk songs came in handy. Krishna even as slayer and politician comes through as a loveable, mischievous character, said Talukdar.

 Gurukul has a core team of 12 to 15 proficient dancers. The youngest student in the academy is only four-and-a-half years old.

 For Megh Utsav, to be staged at New Millennium Park, a group of 35-60 Odissi dancers will be needed. Talukdar is thrilled that despite the usual artistic differences, no dancer she has approached has refused to join her. 

 Dancers from other schools are joining Gurukul Creative and I feel that I may have finally found a way to make Bengal shrug out of its infamous lethargy to dance, signed off Talukdar.

 The menace of missing manhole covers

 Ashok Hore: Picnic Garden Road, CN Roy Road and Sridhar Roy Road in the Kasba-Tiljala area have turned into death traps due to rampant theft of manhole covers. Few pedestrians dare to use these roads, particularly after heavy rains or power cuts. Why has there been such a sudden spurt in such thefts? What steps have you taken to prevent this? 

 I feel such incidents of manhole theft have increased suddenly before the Assembly election. I have taken the matter up with the CMC and the police. But nothing has been done yet. The civic authorities are reluctant to replace the manhole covers. I have decided to discuss the matter with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and request him to direct the police to raid the godowns and shops of the scrap dealers.

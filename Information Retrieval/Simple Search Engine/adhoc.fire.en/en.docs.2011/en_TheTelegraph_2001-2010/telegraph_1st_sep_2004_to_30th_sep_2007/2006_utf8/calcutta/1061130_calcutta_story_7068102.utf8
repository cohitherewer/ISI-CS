 Private eyes spy public role

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Private security agencies are keen to play a larger policing role. With the gap between policemen and private guards widening by the day, they are now keen to get into areas where they have till now been denied access.

 The numbers are surely on their side the city has over three lakh private security guards and just under 25,000 policemen.

 Satnam Singh Ahluwalia, CEO of Oxford Security and Detective Agency, said on Wednesday: We have submitted a proposal to the home ministry, detailing how private guards could be deployed for traffic control, disaster management and intelligence gathering. They can be the eyes and ears of the government to curb crime rates.

 The agencies are also joining hands to protest some provisions in the Private Security Agencies (Regulation) Act 2005, scheduled to take effect from March 15. The clauses they would like reconsidered involve elaborate training of guards, issuing of licences, police verification and training of the licencee.

 These clauses do not make sense. Industry representatives should be allowed to give their inputs, said Lt.-Col. (retd) Pritam Mehta of the Association of Private Detectives and Central Association of Private Security, now forming an eastern India chapter.

 Balm for family in wake of assault

 A STAFF REPORTER

 First the blows rained down and now the bouquets are trickling in things have started turning in favour of the Ghosh family in Bally.

 Last Thursday evening, Prasenjit Ghosh was roughed up by a group of CPM supporters for protesting his wifes harassment. Since then, the family has been living in the fear of a cadre backlash.

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee came out in support of the family on Tuesday. All the miscreants should be arrested, said Bhattacharjee. His party colleagues in Bally echoed the chief ministers views. 

 We have told police to bring the accused to book, irrespective of party affiliation. The family has been assured that there will be no backlash, said Sridip Bhattacharya, secretary of CPMs Bally district committee. Bhattacharya had a one-and-a-half-hour meeting with Sharmistha, wife of Prasenjit, on Tuesday at the party office in Shibpur. 

 Sharmistha briefed him about the condition of Prasenjit, who is still nursing an eye injury at a city nursing home, and requested the leader to ensure the familys safety. He (Bhattacharya) gave me a patient hearing and assured me that our family is safe in the locality, said Sharmistha, relieved after the meeting. 

 Her harassment by Krishnendu Halder, who was clicking pictures of her on the sly from a neighbouring building, sending her lewd text messages and also calling her up, was the trigger behind the October 26 incident. 

 A gang of 15 beat up Prasenjit in full public glare, barely a few yards from his GT Road residence. Krishnendu and two others Kishu Bhaduri and Rana Ganguly have been arrested in connection with the case. But the other three accused Sudeb Guha. Rabi Bose and Shankar Maitra are still at large.

 We are conducting raids and the people who are absconding will soon be arrested, said superintendent of police Neeraj Kumar. 

 Besides posting policemen in plainclothes near the Ghosh residence on GT Road, the district police have started preparing charges against the accused. We have contacted the telecom service provider to get Halders call details. Prima facie, it is clear that he was harassing her, said an investigating officer.

 Buladi in pandals

 - Puja message from mascot

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A Buladi installation to be put up outside pandals. 

 Buladi will land up at pandals this Puja to increase AIDS awareness. And this time, she will be in 3D.

 Behala Young Mens Association, Maddox Square Sarbojanin, Golf Green Sarbojanin, College Square Sarbojanin and Sreebhumi Sporting Club will play host to nine-ft-high installations of the popular HIV prevention mascot, adopted by the West Bengal State Aids Prevention and Control Society, for the four festive days. 

 All five installations will be animated, with moving lips, eyes and hands. They will prominently display 1097, the number to dial for AIDS-related queries. The installations have been conceived, designed and made by Nandita Palchoudhuri, with help from SD Electric of Chandernagore.

 Nandita, who has been working with the patuas of the Midnapores and lighting experts of Chandernagore in finding ways to generate AIDS awareness for the Gere Foundation India Trust, hopes that these exercises will open avenues of sustenance for traditional craftsmen. 

 She states: Lighting experts in Chandernagore traditionally use cheap products low-cost bulbs hand-wrapped in coloured cellophane. I persuaded them to use bulbs of a better quality, which would last not just a day but for long periods. About 17,000 bulbs will illuminate each Buladi installation.

 The response of Puja organisers to the installation proposal was mixed. Quite a few were hesitant to put up a mascot associated with disease prevention near the pandals since they thought it would not go with the spirit of Puja.

 Some organisers even asked for money because they thought it was a kind of government advertisement, recalls Nandita. She hopes to make a video of the installations and the crowd, for a Gere Foundation show in December.

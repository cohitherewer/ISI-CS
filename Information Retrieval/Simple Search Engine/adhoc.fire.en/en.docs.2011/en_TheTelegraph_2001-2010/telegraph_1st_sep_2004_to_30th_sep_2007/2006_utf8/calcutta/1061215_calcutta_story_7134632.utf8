 An ardent AC Milan supporter, 

 young Mauro Zanusso with his winning smile and funky red-rimmed 

 glasses hardly looks the kitchen kind. But his core competence 

 re-styling classic Italian cuisine suggests 

 otherwise. In town as the new Italian chef of La Cucina 

 at Hyatt Regency, the tall, lean man from Biella (Italy) 

 says he enjoys cooking thoroughly.

 You dont choose it, 

 the kitchen chooses you. I was born a chef. Ever since a 

 kid I loved observing my mother in the kitchen. When on 

 the streets, I would see pastries and cakes and feel that 

 one day I want to make them too.

 Zanussos culinary career 

 took off in 1995. I would cook at home and then I 

 enrolled myself in a catering school and read extensively. 

 The Italian with a diploma from Ipssar E Zejna (a catering 

 school in Biella) stresses the need for theoretical education. 

 As a chef, hands-on experience is of course important, 

 but one needs to get the basic theories right.

 Cooking is a mixture of 

 passion and understanding the chemical situations in the 

 kitchen seeing the colours change, gauging the proportions, 

 blending ingredients, innovations smiles the chef.

 Talking about passions, Italian 

 cuisine is way up there for Zanusso. I have grown 

 up on them. The ingredients are fresh, theres no big 

 mixture in your mouth, its simple yet worth tasting. 

 That is what makes the cuisine special.

 His profession has taken him places 

 Bologna, Paris, London and more. This is the globetrotters 

 first visit to India but he is quite upbeat about serving 

 the Indian palate.

 It is different whipping 

 up food for the European and Indian foodie. Here people 

 like their food more flavoured. The challenge lies in keeping 

 the base Italian and moving over to the Indian kitchen in 

 a delicate way, observes Zanusso.

 The chef has been busy in the 

 kitchen ever since he landed in the city, but he has already 

 taken in Infocom 2006, the crowded streets and the 

 traffic.

 A little time off work and 

 I will explore the city better, says Zanusso who is 

 already in love with moong dal and mishti doi.

 Talking about his plans for La 

 Cucina, the chef who loves whipping up meat and fish 

 preparations more than desserts dreams of the 

 restaurant being the best venue for food in the city.

 The team I am working with 

 is good, but they have the potential to be great. Training 

 is on, the chefs are understanding the nitty-gritty of 

 the cuisine, he adds.

 As part of La Cucinas second 

 anniversary celebrations, one gets to taste Zanussos 

 specialities on the menu till December 17. You will find 

 Mushroom Soup with Taleggio Ravioli, Pan Fried Gnocchi with 

 Thyme Butter, Arborio Rice with Fresh Rosemary and Parmesan 

 Cheese, Ginger Creme Brule with Apple Sorbet and other delicacies. 

 The La Cucina menu on the 

 whole will receive a makeover, he reveals.

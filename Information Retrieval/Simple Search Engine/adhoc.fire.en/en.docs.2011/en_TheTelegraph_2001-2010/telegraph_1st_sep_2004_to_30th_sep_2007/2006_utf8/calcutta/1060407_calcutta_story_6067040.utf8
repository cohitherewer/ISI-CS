 Team India soccer captain Bhaichung Bhutia was on Thursday slapped a warrant by a judicial magistrate for contempt of court. Bhaichung was rapped for his failure to appear before the Howrah court despite several summons in connection with the case of his stolen bag.

 On July 1, 2003, Bhaichung had lodged an FIR with Shalimar GRP outpost that a brown suitcase of his had been stolen on the Bangalore-Howrah Express, on October 31, 2002.

 Police had then arrested Harekrishna Ghorai and retrieved a bag. A case under Sections 379 and 411 IPC was lodged. Despite several court summons, the football star failed to appear to identify his bag.

 First judicial magistrate Sadhan Mandal of Howrah court issued the warrant on Thursday to ensure Bhaichung?s presence in court on May 20. The warrant will reach the relevant Salt Lake police station ? Bhaichung is a resident of BE 167 ? on Friday.

 On Thursday evening, Bhaichung denied having ?received any information from any court?.

 At a hurriedly-convened media conference at the East Bengal tent, he recounted how four weeks ago, he had received a summons order from the Howrah court to identify the bag. ?I told the policeman I cannot appear by May 20 as the National Football League was on,? Bhaichung said. ?He asked me to sign on the order and write the reason, which I did.?

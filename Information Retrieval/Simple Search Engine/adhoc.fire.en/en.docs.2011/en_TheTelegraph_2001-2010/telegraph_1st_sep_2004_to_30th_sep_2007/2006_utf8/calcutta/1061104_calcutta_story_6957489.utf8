 The City Diary

 The pandas of the Kalighat temple moved Calcutta High Court 

 on Friday, seeking modification of an order restraining 

 them from entering the sanctum sanctorum to offer puja on 

 behalf of pilgrims. But the bench presided over by Chief 

 Justice V.S. Sirpurkar held that the Supreme Court scheme 

 on running the temple, issued in 1957, did not give any 

 such rights to the pandas. 

 The court, however, ruled that the pandas could plead for 

 the right before the South 24-Parganas district judge, who 

 is ex-officio chairman of the temple committee. 

 Around 70 Congress supporters blocked the Hazra crossing 

 on Friday afternoon and damaged four state buses to protest 

 the health departments inaction in checking faulty blood 

 test kits supplied by Monozyme India Ltd. They also demanded 

 immediate resignation of health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra. 

 The blockade continued for over half-an-hour and was lifted 

 after a police contingent reached the spot. Five protesters 

 were arrested, said Bikash Ray, officer-in-charge of Kalighat 

 police station. 

 The body of Swapan Das, 49, was found in a truck in Baruipur, on the southern fringes of the city, on Friday morning. Police suspect Das was killed elsewhere. The body has been sent for post-mortem.

Police said Tahmina got married to Abbas Ali three months ago. Soon after, Abbas took her to Madhya Pradesh. Tahminas father told police he had not heard from his daughter since then.

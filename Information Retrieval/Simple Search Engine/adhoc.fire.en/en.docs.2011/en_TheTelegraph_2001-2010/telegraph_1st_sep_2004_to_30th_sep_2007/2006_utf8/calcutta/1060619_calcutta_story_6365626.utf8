 Cruise along the shores of Singapore and Malaysia, fest on the Food and Fruits Fiesta or enjoy the Colours of Malaysia, all at One Perfect Price. The latest offer from Tourism Malaysia is a seven-day-six-night land-and-cruise package for Rs 17,777.

 The trip includes two nights in Kuala Lumpur, two nights on Star Cruise-SuperStar Virgo and two nights in Singapore. The package includes accommodation on twin-sharing basis with breakfast, a half-day city tour in Kuala Lumpur and Singapore and airport transfers. It is valid till September 2006.

 ?This package was in great demand last year. This time, we expect higher bookings from not only the leisure segment but also from the Indian corporate sector for meetings, conferences, etc,? said Manoharan Periasamy, director, Tourism Malaysia, India.

 Malaysian arrivals from India have shown a ?remarkable growth? of over 30 per cent in the year ending 2005, with over 225,000 Indian arrivals. Over 3,000 people travelled on this offer in 2005.

 The air fares are not included in the package since there are ?frequent revisions? and ?more airline choices?.

 The package was offered during this period because from July to September, Malaysia celebrates a number of festivals, including Annual Mega Sale Carnival, Colours of Malaysia and the Food and Fruits Fiesta.

 The six-week sale carnival from July 23 to September 1 features discounts in all malls and shopping centres around the country, clothes to cosmetics, footwear to electronics and more. It includes a daily line-up of games and contests at various venues.

 Citrawarna, or Colours of Malaysia, celebrates its ethnic and cultural diversity with art and craft exhibitions, food festivals, song and dance performances and sports. The month-long fest coincides with the King?s birthday and includes a spectacular royal parade.

 Sample the sumptuous local cuisine and exotic fruits at the Food and Fruits Fiesta in July. Roadside stalls to fancy restaurants, they all serve up a variety of delicacies. Cooking contests, games and other events are also held during the festival.

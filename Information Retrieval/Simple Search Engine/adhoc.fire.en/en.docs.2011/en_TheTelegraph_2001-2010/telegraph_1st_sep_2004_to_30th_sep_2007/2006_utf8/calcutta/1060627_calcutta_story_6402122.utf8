 Police deal with distress

 - HELPLINE HAPPENINGS

 PRONAB MONDAL

 Calls of distress they are, but the requests range from recovering a book to pacifying a neighbour?s dog.

 The police helpline for the aged has opened the opportunity for cops to play the role of a ?good friend? to the most vulnerable section of society. 

 Instead of seeking security cover in the dead of night, the callers, mostly lonely couples, ask officers to solve problems in their personal lives. And the men in uniform happily oblige.

 Citing an example, police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee said an officer had once received a call from a woman in her late 70s, who requested him to help her recover one of her books. ?She said a friend had borrowed the book a few months ago. She had promised to return it in a couple of days, but did not keep her words,? Mukherjee said.

 On receiving the complaint, the officer met the woman, a south Calcutta resident, and heard the episode in detail. He then met the friend and collected the book. 

 While returning it to its owner, the officer was overwhelmed with the old woman?s display of gratitude.

 Another officer said he once received a call around midnight. The caller, in his early 80s, asked him to rush over as the German Shepherd Dog of his neighbour was barking for the past couple of hours. ?I and my aged wife, a cardiac patient, cannot sleep. Please come and help us.?

 A group of four cops rushed to the house. ?It was tough. The neighbour told us that the dog was barking as it had spotted someone scaling the wall of his house,? the officer recalled. A patient effort, lasting over two hours, could finally pacify the dog.

 An officer said: ?Most of the callers live alone. Thanks to the helpline, they now feel they have someone to turn to in hours of need.?

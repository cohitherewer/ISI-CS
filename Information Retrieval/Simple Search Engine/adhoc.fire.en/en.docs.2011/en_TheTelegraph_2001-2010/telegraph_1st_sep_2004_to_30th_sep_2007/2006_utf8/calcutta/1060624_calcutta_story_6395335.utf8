The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Applause and exotica

Stage On amp; Off

 The cast of A Midsummer Night?s Dream

 You?ve seen the play. Now read the reviews. Tim Supple?s A Midsummer Night?s Dream, which completed its engagement at the Swan Theatre in Stratford on June 17, received unanimous accolades from the British press. The Daily Telegraph predicts that it ?will be remembered, and talked about, for decades to come, just like Peter Brook?s landmark staging in 1970?. The Independent deems it the first ?outstanding? event after seven productions so far at the unprecedented Complete Works of Shakespeare Festival. A friend who lives outside Stratford and sees a lot of plays confirmed this on e-mail: ?At the end the audience stood up to applaud immediately! I have never seen that before.?

 Such glowing praise all around should silence any naysayers. But some of the words used tell another tale, too: ?fantastical? (not fantastic), ?sexy?, ?savage?, ?strangeness?. Innocuous by themselves, but tricky when applied to non-Western performances because of their associations with alien otherness. Despite Tim?s rejection of exoticisation, despite the media?s acceptance of his disclaimers, despite post-politically-correct sensibilities, despite 21st-century sensitivity, the West?s fascination for difference and novelty continues to raise an off-key voice amid this chorus of encomia.

 Alongside this intriguing discovery, I find that the general Western ignorance about the non-Western world persists, most surprisingly in the press, prime purveyors of information. In the venerable Times, a preview by Raekha Prasad introduces the play as ?performed for almost 200 years throughout India ? in English and a smattering of the sub-continent?s 20 major languages?. I can bet that every major Indian tongue, not just a smattering, has seen at least one staging of the Dream. But knowledge of the deep Shakespearean impact on India seems thin in England.

 Or, if that is too esoteric to expect, it still strikes me as odd that no sub-editor in the Guardian ? leave alone its critic for 35 years, Michael Billington ? cross-checked and corrected Billington?s spelling of ?Kolkota? and the Asian languages spoken in the production: ?Hindi, Bengali, Malayalam, Sinhali, Marathi or Sinhala?.

 Amusingly, the reviews attempt to display some familiarity with Hindi films. According to the Daily Telegraph, ?The lovers are Indian rich kids, gorgeous in their silks, like the stars of Bollywood movies.? The Times considers Bottom (appreciated by all the newspapers) ?as vain as a Bollywood heart-throb?. I doubt Tim ever had such ideas, nor do I see any similarities between Joy Fernandes and any of the Khans. At the other extreme of popular entertainment, the Daily Telegraph refers to ?fire-eaters? in the show; they certainly weren?t present when we watched it. India?s artistic image seems caught between fire-eating and filmi gyrating.

 I am happy at the overwhelmingly positive response to our young Indian cast, but somewhat disgruntled that old Orientalist habits die hard.

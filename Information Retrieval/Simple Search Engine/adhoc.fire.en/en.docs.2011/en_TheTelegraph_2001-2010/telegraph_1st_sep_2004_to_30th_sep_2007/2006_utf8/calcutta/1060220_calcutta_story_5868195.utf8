The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Crisis management in slums 

 RAJIVA SINHA, project director, Calcutta Environment Improvement Project, met readers of The Telegraph to answer their queries. Participants included Sandip Banerjee, Srikumar Chattopadhyay, J.N. Das, Kali Shankar Ghosh, Anjana Dasgupta, Rupayan Datta, Debasish Guhathakurata, Ashok Das and Subhadyuti Datta

Kali Shankar Ghosh: What are the projects being taken up under your model slum scheme?

 I would like to make it clear that no model slum scheme has been taken up under the Asian Development Bank-funded Calcutta Environment Improvement Project (CEIP). But we have undertaken crisis management activities in 100 slums in the city. 

 Under the crisis management project, we are providing basic facilities like lights, paved roads and drainage facilities in the selected slums. A sum of Rs 50 crore has been allotted for the purpose. Each slum will be allocated Rs 50 lakh.

Subhadyuti Datta: Does this mean that slums will remain slums in the years to come? Can?t you turn the slums into highrises, make the roads wider and set up parks and community centres in them?

 The CEIP is only involved in slum improvement. Everyone wants better living condition for the slum-dwellers, but it requires huge amounts of money. The policy-makers will have to consider the issue.

 Before any such project is started, it is necessary to bring about a change in the behaviour pattern of the slum-dwellers. Otherwise the move to erect multi-storeyed apartments would fall flat.

 The CEIP has decided to carry out a pilot scheme in eight slums, where NGOs would be engaged to bring about a change in the behavioural pattern of the slum-dwellers. The list of the slums will be supplied by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) soon.

Srikumar Chattopadhyay: The CEIP was started for the benefit of several wards in north Calcutta and 41 wards in the added areas, consisting of Behala, Garden Reach and Jadavpur. Wards in east Calcutta were subsequently brought under the purview of the CEIP. Can you enlighten us about the development schemes for east Calcutta?

 A Rs 100-crore development plan has been accepted by the funding agency and six wards (wards 56-59 and 66 and 67) in east Calcutta have already been brought under the CEIP. But the project report is yet to be prepared. The work will be undertaken in the next phase.

Sandip Banerjee: About 98 per cent of the roads in Behala, Garden Reach and Jadavpur are nothing more than lanes and alleys. Will it be possible to lay underground sewer lines in these narrow lanes? Is there any proposal for announcing the road alignment for those areas?

 I would like to point out that the CEIP does not have the authority to announce road alignment. It is the responsibility of the state government, CMC and the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority. I don?t know of any such proposal.

 Most roads in Behala, Jadavpur and Garden Reach are only 12-ft wide. It was planned that sewage pipes of 2,000-mm diameter will be laid under the wider roads. The lanes and bylanes will have sewage lines of 300-mm diameter.

Ashok Das: Does it mean you will discharge raw sewage in the river?

 Certainly not. We are setting up a sewage treatment plant for the south suburban zone in east Calcutta, at Bangur and Garden Reach. Before discharging, the sewage will be intercepted and treated.

Debasish Guhathakurata: When will we notice an improvement in the city?s environment?

 By 2010, you will start to notice the improvement. There will be less waterlogging, more greenery, less stench from the drainage canals, less skin diseases and diarrhoea and fewer mosquitoes. You will even see improvement in the attendance of schoolchildren.

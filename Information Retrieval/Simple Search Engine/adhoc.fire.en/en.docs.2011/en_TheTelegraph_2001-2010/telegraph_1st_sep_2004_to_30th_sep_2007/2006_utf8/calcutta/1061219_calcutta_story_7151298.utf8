 What: Aqua Blast.

 Where: SRC Waterways barge. 

 When: Saturday night. 

 The bash: Foot-tapping music, lip-smacking finger food and favourite flavours of hookah. All this and more but not in a disc on Park Street but on the Hooghly.

 A barge, decked up with lights, set sail from the Millennium jetty at 10 pm and remained on the river till the early hours of Sunday. The crowd comprised regulars at party places like Venom, Shisha and Underground. 

 Amidst all the dance and music, there were flair bartenders from Mumbai who kept the crowd entertained with their juggling act. The fact that one did not have the option to hop into the car and head off to the next dance floor seemed to go down well. When you are partying in or around Park Street, you tend to follow the herd and end up visiting all the nightclubs at one go. On a barge that is not possible, hence the party stays at one place, said Manish Kanodia, a Shisha regular. 

 Seeing both the bridges, the Howrah bridge and Vidyasagar Setu together, is such a nice feeling, said a guest at the party. 

 Voiceover: Our barge bash last year was a hit so we decided to host it once again. It is popular because it gives party people a chance to get away from the usual nightclubs, said Samrat Roy Choudhury of SRC Waterways.

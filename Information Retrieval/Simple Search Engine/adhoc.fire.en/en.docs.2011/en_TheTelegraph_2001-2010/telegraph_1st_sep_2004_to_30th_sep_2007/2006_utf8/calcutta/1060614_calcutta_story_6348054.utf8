 ?Insolence? of cop irks minister

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The minister-in-charge of Sunderbans development Kanti Ganguly has lodged a complaint with Beniapukur police station against an assistant sub-inspector for ?insolent behaviour?. 

 On Tuesday morning, assistant sub-inspector Utpal Chakrabarty allegedly refused to listen to the pleas of a few youths from Mathurapur, in South 24-Parganas. 

 They had turned up seeking Chakrabarty?s intervention to ensure the early release of the body of Mujib Sardar, a panchayat member from Sankarpur, who died early on Tuesday at Calcutta National Medical College after an accident on Sunday.

 ?We tried explaining to him the urgency, as Mathurapur is far away from the city. Even minister Ganguly was keen to know about the body,? said Chandicharan Naiya, panchayat pradhan. He added that he had even handed over his mobile phone to Chakrabarty, so that he could talk to the minister. But Chakrabarty refused to speak and allegedly abused Naiya.

 Shocked at the ?audacity? of the officer, Ganguly lodged a complaint. He was, however, pacified by the officer-in-charge of the thana, Anil Jana, who sought an apology from the sub-inspector.

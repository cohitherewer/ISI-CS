 Survey of wetlands

 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE

 The state environment department has started an on-the-spot assessment of the condition of wetlands in and around Calcutta. 

 ?In collaboration with the science and technology department, we had prepared a satellite map of the wetlands in the city and its suburbs in 2004. We are now verifying whether the waterbodies still exist or not. If a wetland has been filled up, we will take steps to restore it,? explained environment minister Mohanto Chatterjee.

 The civic bodies have also been asked to conduct a physical verification of the waterbodies in their area and submit a report to the government.

 According to the satellite map, there are 250 medium and large waterbodies in and around the city and Howrah.

 Government officials believe at least 50 of them have been filled up and more are in the process of being filled. ?We will get the real picture after the physical verification,? stated Chatterjee.

 The government had tabled a bill named Wetland Conservation Bill, 2006, in the Assembly in March to check the filling of wetlands. It is under scrutiny of the select committee.

 ?If the waterbodies are protected well and properly utilised, the promoters will not dare to fill them up. Unclean and unused wetlands can cause pollution problems,? pointed out the environment minister.

 To protect the waterbodies, the government is planning to build a wall around them and plant trees on their banks. It also wants to use them for resource generation.

 The large wetlands will be used for pisciculture. Unemployed youths of the area will be allowed to cultivate fish by forming cooperatives. Swimming pools will be built in the smaller waterbodies. They will also be used for cultivation of ornamental fish.

 The civic authorities will come up with blueprints for such projects following the guidelines of the environment department. Private partners can be utilised for the purpose.

 Chatterjee said the government was considering another legislation for the preservation and utilisation of the city?s waterbodies.

 The ruling CPM has also expressed concern about the filling up of waterbodies. At a recent meeting in Howrah, party state secretary Biman Bose told the workers: ?No one will get involved in any incident of wetland filling. On the contrary, the party workers will have to take steps to protect the wetlands. The party will not spare those found guilty of filling waterbodies.?

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You share your birthday with...

 Pete Seeger and Engelbert Humperdinck

 You?re efficient and cooperative but never aggressive. For you, there is no such thing as failure. You prefer to run things rather than take orders. You must allow room for discussion and debate. You?re ambitious, but understanding and encouraging with others. You prefer peaceful relationships. ? Kusum Bhandari

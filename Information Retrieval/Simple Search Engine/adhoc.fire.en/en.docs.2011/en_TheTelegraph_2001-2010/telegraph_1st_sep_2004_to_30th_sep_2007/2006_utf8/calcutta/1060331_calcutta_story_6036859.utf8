The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Air crew cradle in foul play storm

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The air hostess academy that flew into rough weather with charges of duping being levelled against some officials, has hit another air pocket.

 The police on Thursday informed a city court that they needed more time to interrogate Atul Chawla and Kaushik Bhawal, arrested officials of Air Hostess Academy (AHA), since they were receiving more verbal complaints ?from students who had also been cheated?.

 Mamata Bhatt, public relations manager of AHA, however, told Metro from Delhi: ?I have no idea of any fresh complaints having been made? We have ensured that there is no reason for our students to complain about anything. I am coming to Calcutta to have a talk with any student who might have something to say against the academy.?

 Refusing to go into the details of the complaints trickling in, public prosecutor Sasanka Sekhar Chaudhuri, on behalf of Ballygunge police, argued that since more students had levelled allegations against the institution, it was necessary for sleuths to probe deeper.

 The veracity of the claims of these students must be matched with those of complainant Soumyajit Bhowmik, a student of AHA, he added.

 After hearing the plea and the appeal of the advocate defending Chawla and Bhawal, the chief judicial magistrate remanded the two in judicial custody till April 4.

 ?There are several intricacies in this case and we wanted to interrogate the two arrested men thoroughly to get to the bottom,? said N.R. Babu, deputy commissioner of police (south division).

 Last Saturday, officers of Ballygunge police station had arrested Chawla and Bhawal at the academy after receiving a complaint from Bhowmik. The student alleged that he had paid the academy Rs 32,000 after being assured of a placement as a flight steward. The promise was never kept, he alleged.

 ?We arrested the two after probing the matter... And on Thursday, we informed the court about the other complaints we are receiving,? Babu said.

 The academy officials had claimed it was a concerted effort to malign them.

 Maidan orchard to bring in birds

 SHALMOLI KUNDU

 The state forest department is planning to set up an orchard on the Maidan.

 According to the blueprint, about 1,000 fruit trees will be planted on a one-acre plot near Fort William, opposite the Mohun Bagan club. 

 The project will be a part of the Calcutta greening programme taken up by the department a year ago. Permission to set up the orchard has been sought from the local military authority. 

 ?We have decided to plant as many fruit trees as possible in the city this year. Some portions of the Maidan are never utilised. We have planned to set up an orchard on one such portion. This will beautify the area, as well as act as a boon for the environment,? said Somnath Mukherjee, deputy conservator of forests (urban and recreational forestry). 

 Another important reason for setting up an orchard on the Maidan, Mukherjee added, is to attract birds to the city. ?Birds mainly feed on fruits. As most of the trees have been cut down, many birds have almost vanished from Calcutta. The orchard will provide food and shelter to the birds.?

 The department wants to involve the chief minister in the programme. Before that, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee will be taken to Mayo Road to evaluate the success of a plantation programme. Two years ago, the chief minister had launched the drive. 

 ?We are often questioned about the success of the plantation programmes. We want to take the chief minister to Mayo Road, so that he can see for himself the success of the project. About 98 per cent of the seedlings planted have survived,? claimed the official.

 From next month, the department will take up plantation programmes at various places. Scented floral plants will be planted at the Alipore and Presidency correctional homes. Presidency College has also invited the forest wing to plant trees on the campus. 

 The state government has sanctioned Rs 50 lakh to the department for the plantation programmes. About 100,000 trees will be planted in and around the city. Half the work will be done by the department. The civic body and Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority will do the rest of the work.

 ?We have decided to only plant seedlings that grow over six feet,? stated Mukherjee.

 Happenings, a group of self-proclaimed die-hard Calcuttans, is determined to bring the citys biggest holiday onto the map of domestic and global tourism.

 We are a group of people who are avid about Calcutta and want to see it getting the attention it deserves. We think if more people realised the carnival atmosphere that grips the city during Durga puja, it would be an excellent starting point for Calcutta to become a major holiday destination, said Indrani Misra of Happenings. 

 Happenings organised a four-day trip during the Puja for people from all over India and abroad to sample Calcutta at its most exuberant. Visitors from Mumbai, Hyderabad, Bangalore and Punjab, as well as a few Britons, geared up for an action-packed stay in the city. The Happenings plan is that these invited guests, once they return home, will pass on their experiences to their friends and family and get the ball rolling in terms of tourist numbers during the Puja.

 The Autumn Festival Programme kicked off with a cruise on the Hooghly and a visit to Belur Math, along with a variety of programmes, including classical dance sessions and an evening at Marble Palace.

 Were trying to change some of the perceptions about the city, said A.V. Iyengar, a retired businessman-now-turned cheerleader for Calcutta. It has been difficult, especially as we are a voluntary organisation without a large marketing budget.

 The main event was, of course, an evening of pandal-hopping across the city. This is my first Puja and Im enjoying my stay in Calcutta, said Shanbhag, of Mumbai. And when I get home, Ill be telling my friends that Durga puja is something you must see at least once.

 Its unique, explained Iyengar to his guests. Durga puja is the only festival in the world that is not organised by any central body. Its spontaneous and totally citizen-led.

 He vowed to turn the Puja into a global fest, like Mardi Gras or Oktoberfest.

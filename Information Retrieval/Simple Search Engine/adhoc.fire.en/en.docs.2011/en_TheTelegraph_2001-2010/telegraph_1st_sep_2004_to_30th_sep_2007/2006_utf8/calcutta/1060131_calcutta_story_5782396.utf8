 Making a mockery of true love and romance as popularised in fiction, Choopkatha?s production, Mrs. Soriano, is a satirical comedy that clearly exposes male hypocrisy in matters pertaining to marriage. Full of ironical humour, the play focuses on certain social mores that govern human character. A contemporary take-off on 17th century Jonsonian comedies, it subtly criticises the patriarchal social structure which leaves women with little or no means to lead their lives in an independent, dignified manner. The Bengali adaptation of Eduardo de Filippos Filumena Marturano, it tells the story of Filumena, mistress and housekeeper to wealthy Domenico Soriano for 25 years. When she learns that he intends to marry a young, socially-acceptable girl, Filumena pretends to be dying and tricks Soriano into marrying her. But, no sooner than the ceremony is over, the truth is revealed and Soriano is left with no choice but to accept Filumena as his wife. Acting and direction: Dolly Basu.

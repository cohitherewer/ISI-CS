 Venue: INOX (Forum)

 Time: Evening show of Rang De Basanti on January 26

 Dialogue: ?My gulabo, you can come with us, baby?? ? Aamir Khan to wife Kiran Rao

 For a man who?s never gone public with his private life, to actually display his affection for his new bride in front of a 300-strong crowd was a welcome surprise for the lucky Calcuttans watching Aamir?s new film on Thursday.

 While Aamir and his Rang De team were hopping plexes to promote the movie, wife Kiran had sneaked into the 5.10 pm show at INOX (Forum) to gauge the audience reaction first-hand, something Aamir would do himself earlier.

 He may have been silent to the media about the controversies dogging Rang De in the recent past, but Aamir kept nothing from the audience as he interacted with them at the end of the screening. 

 ?The ministry of defence took a very mature decision by not asking for a change in the film. As for the horse sequence, we left it out because of the request from the animal welfare board. But in reality, I was getting killed because I was asked to keep my hands off the horse while riding,? he flashed his trademark smile.

 If his words had everyone in raptures, Aamir?s song-and-dance had them going crazy. He not only crooned Sue kar mere mann ko ? a parody his character DJ sings for his lady love in Rang De ? Aamir swung to his Pathshaala steps.

 Though he went out of his way to mingle with the crowds, Aamir hasn?t forgotten his earlier visit to the Elgin Road address last August, when frenzied fans had nearly caused a wardrobe malfunction for Kiran on the Forum escalator.

 ?Missed the escalators this time,? was Aamir?s comment on the INOX guestbook. No surprises then that his bespectacled bride was wearing a red T-shirt teamed with denims on Thursday and not the elaborate sari-choli ensemble that almost came off last time.

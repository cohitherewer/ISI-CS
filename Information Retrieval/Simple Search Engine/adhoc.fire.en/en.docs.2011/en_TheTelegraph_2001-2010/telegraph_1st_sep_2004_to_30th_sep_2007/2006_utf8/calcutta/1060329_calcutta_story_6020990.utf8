The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 The central and state governments should change the criteria 

 on which any building gets the heritage tag. A building 

 should be declared a heritage structure only if the owner 

 or the government is willing to bear the cost of its maintenance. 

 A number of heritage structures in Calcutta, like the old 

 mint on Strand Road , are in a deplorable condition due 

 to lack of proper maintenance. Such buildings should be 

 allowed to be dismantled if restoration is not possible 

 and the plot used for other purposes. The state government 

 or the Corporation should frame proper rules on the use 

 of the cleared plot. This will ensure that the land is not 

 grabbed by unscrupulous promoters for their own profit. 

 Raj Bagri, Ho Chi Minh Sarani. 

 The state government should develop a green belt in the 

 city and its suburbs to better maintain the ecological balance. 

 They should develop parks and gardens in urban areas which 

 can be used for morning and evening walks. Our city is chock-a-block 

 with constructions. Now, with more highrises coming up we 

 will have fewer gardens and parks for recreational purposes.

 Amit V. Sengupta, Sarat Colony. 

 Solving the traffic problem in Calcutta is the most difficult 

 task for the traffic authorities. People just do not follow 

 road rules and meet with fatal accidents. Two-wheelers, 

 cycles and autorickshaws are quite careless and add to the 

 chaos on roads. I request the transport authorities to educate 

 people about traffic rules. 

 Shiv Shanker Almal, Lower Rawdon Street.

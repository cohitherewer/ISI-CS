 Office in flames

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A fire broke out at Remington Building, on Council House Street, on Wednesday evening. 

 No one was injured, as the building has been lying abandoned for years. Ten tenders took more than an hour to control the blaze.

 As all entrances were sealed on a court order, firemen had to break open the main door, on the western side. Once inside, they were handicapped by the darkness, as the building has no electricity connection.

 ?We were informed around 5.20 pm and immediately sent three tenders. Later, seven more were rushed,? said divisional fire officer Joy Narayan Adhikari. 

 ?The fire started on the second floor and spread to the top and first floors. It?s a mystery how the building, sealed for years, caught fire,? he added.

 Local residents said a fire had broken out in the building in 2003. Forensic experts will visit the building on Thursday. 

 Employees of an office in an adjoining building panicked on seeing the blaze. They rushed out, prompting police to restrict traffic on Council House Street. Senior officers arrived on the spot. Even the police commissioner stopped on his way back home, seeing the flames leaping out of the second floor of the building.

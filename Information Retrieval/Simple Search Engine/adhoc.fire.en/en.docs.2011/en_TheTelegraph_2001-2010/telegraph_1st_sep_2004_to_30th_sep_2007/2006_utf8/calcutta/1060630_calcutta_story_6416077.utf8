 Bolly bloke versus Holly hunk

 - Box-office showdown ahead for superheroes as soccer stars warm up

 Krrish and Superman: 

 Caped crusaders 

 Krishna Mehra and Clark Kent are the unlikeliest of adversaries, but the two are set for a box-office showdown of superheroes this weekend. He might have taken a giant leap at the city box-office in Week One, but Krrish will have to vault Superman once theatre doors open on Friday ? the day soccer superheroes line up for the Cup quarterfinals.

 If advances of the two movies at the plexes are anything to go by, the Krrish vs Superman Returns tinsel tie is assuming Argentina vs Germany proportions ? to be screened live at Fame (Hiland Park).

 After registering an average of 95 per cent footfall at the two INOX properties, the Hrithik Roshan starrer already has 50 per cent of its tickets booked in Week Two. Compare this to the 52 per cent advance bookings for the Brandon Routh film and you know that the caped crusaders are too close to call.

 Says Kushagra Jalan, the Bengal distributor of Superman Returns: ?It?s a very exciting phase for cinema, with three back-to-back blockbusters in Fanaa, Phir Hera Pheri and Krrish. Superman Returns should carry on the trend, with 20 prints running in 25 theatres in the state. While Calcutta has got the English prints, the suburbs will get to watch the Hindi version.?

 At the INOX screens, at Forum and City Centre, the Bollywood bloke and the Hollywood hunk are tied at six shows each. ?Superman is a big movie and we have gone in with six shows, which is pretty huge for an English film,? says INOX (Forum) general manager Vikas Syal. ?Despite the franchise returning after more than 20 years, Superman always has its followers. Krrish should also continue its dream run, now that we have brought down the number of shows from eight to six. Only time can tell which film does better.?

 The jumping jack is playing the Made in India card to beat the man who flies. ?Ours is an Indian hero, above anything else,? stresses Krrish creator Rakesh Roshan. Son Hrithik adds: ?His power lies in his ability to make people around him stronger, rather than feel powerful himself.?

 Try telling that to the man who wears his red underpants outside.

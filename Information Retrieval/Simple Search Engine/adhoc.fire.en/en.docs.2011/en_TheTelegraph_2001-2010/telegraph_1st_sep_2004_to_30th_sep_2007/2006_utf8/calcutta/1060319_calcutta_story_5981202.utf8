 What: Hope 

 Charity Ball to celebrate the foundation day of Hope Foundation.

 Where: The Park banquets. 

 When: Friday evening, 7.30 pm onwards.

 The bash: Organised by Hope Foundation and supported by The Park in association with Spandan and A4 Creation, the cocktail and dinner party was a good mix of fun and business. The evening began with a welcome address by Maureen Forest, director, Hope Foundation, Ireland, to celebrate the anniversary of the organisation. She also announced plans for a new 25-bed childrens hospital in the city.

 The welcome address was followed by a documentary that showcased the work done by Hope Foundation in Calcutta over the years for the uplift of underprivileged children.

 The party that followed starred the band Hip Pocket. While Rila Brien belted out one popular number after another, Nondon Bagchi accompanied her on the drums. A few in the crowd took to the floor.

 Spotted: Alok Mukherjee, president of Bengal Chamber of Commerce who was the chief guest, and Ravi Poddar, chairman of CII (eastern region). Also seen were some delegates who had flown in from Ireland especially for the celebrations. This included employees and volunteers of Hope Foundation.

 Sip n bite: 

 The food spread was extensive with an assortment of both 

 vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes that included Paneer 

 Pulao, Grilled Bekti, Mutton Roganjosh, Stuffed Potatoes 

 and more. The salad spread that included bacon, mushroom 

 and pasta found many takers.

 Desserts included gulab jamun and chocolate mousse. The bar counter was kept busy with vodka and beer flowing fast.

 Voiceover: Hope Foundation has been working in this city for seven years now. This is the third charity ball we are hosting. It is an effort to recognise the kind of work Hope Foundation has been doing in Calcutta, said Maureen Forest.

 Sip style

 What: Launch of Magic Moments vodka, from the house of Radico Khaitan Ltd.

 Where: Poolside of Hyatt Regency.

 When: Friday evening, 7:30 pm onwards.

 The bash: An open-air ramp in white and blue overlooking the pool saying Create Your Magic, white tables dotted with candles and a not-so-warm evening made for a pleasant setting. 

 The event kicked off in style with a fashion show featuring outfits by designers Pooja and Mona Nihalani of Purple. The colour palette, in sync with the packaging of the drink, comprised blue, white and silver.

 The fashion show choreographed by Nicola Gomes had models Anchal Kumar, Tina, Konkona, Jessica, Neeraj and others walking the makeshift ramp.

 The show was divided into four sequences ? beachwear, gypsy skirts, denims and clubwear. The first sequence had girls showcasing skirts with floral prints, flowers tucked in tresses. The gypsy skirts with a bohemian feel were teamed with cool summery tops.

 The denim collection had capris paired with sporty tees. The clubwear round showed off minis, harem pants, tunics and cocktail dresses in simple yet smart cuts. 

 In between the sequences, dancers matched steps to peppy numbers and hostess Priyanka Chaudhuri kept the mood going.

 Finally, it was time to unveil the drink. Raju Vaziraney, president sales and marketing, Rahul Gagerna, assistant vice-president, and Anil Arora, general manager sales (east) were up on stage to launch the drink, while crackers filled the night air.

 The drink: A frosted bottle with a clear glass guitar embossed on it makes for smart packaging. The first vodka brand from the company, Magic Moments is a grain vodka made from natural extracts and goes through triple distillation.

 Pocket pinch: The 750 ml bottle is priced at Rs 260.

 Voiceover: The vodka 

 market has great potential and thats the reason behind 

 this venture. The quality and packaging make it another 

 mark of purity from the Radico cask, smiled Raju Vaziraney.

 Take a look: A splash of happy bubble gum pink on the walls, cool grey in-built racks, funky graffiti as part of the graphics? all this and more complement the designs stocked at No Code. 

 Western outfits for women in the form of distressed denims, capris, vests, strappy tops, tees, shorts and skirts are seen in both pastels and vibrant hues. 

 Funky prints, some sequins and occasional thread detailing up the glam quotient further.

 Voiceover: This summer collection attempts to break the fashion code because todays teens are tired of both ethnic and normal Indian wear. No Code takes the style story forward catering to the age group of 14 to 30, says Aditya Banthia of No Code.

 The ambience: Chequered flags, in all forms, shapes and sizes set the high-energy, racy mood at Venom. 

 On the wall, at the bar and on each wrist ? the black-and-white famous chequers were played up all around. Huge plasma screens and every other set in the house was tuned to only one channel, official broadcaster ESPN STAR Sports. 

 F1 enthusiasts turned up in large numbers, in their sporty best as they supported their favourites over endless supply of Fosters beer and finger food.

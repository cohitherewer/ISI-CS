 We Ask You Answer

 Publicity fuel for flu fright

 Today?s question: Is the drop in chicken consumption more panic than precaution? More responses will be published next week

 Distant face of fear: Animal rights activists march in front of a chicken outlet with a green message 

 Indranil Bag,

 Chinsurah

 The drop in chicken consumption is certainly more panic than precaution. This is due to lack of awareness among the so-called educated and rational public. What is surprising is that the media is being blamed for spreading confusion.

 Sebanti Chakraborty, 

 Tollygunge

 People are taking preventive measures since an attack of avian flu can prove fatal. Isn?t it quite natural to avoid chicken rather than risk one?s life? 

 Mehjibin Yunus, 

 Bright Street

 Most people believe prevention is better than cure, so the drop in chicken consumption was only to be expected. A declaration by the authorities that the spread of flu has been checked would assure the public to a great extent.

 Rabin Dey,

 Bhowanipore

 Very few people have died of avian flu in Asia and no human case has been reported in India. Experts have stressed that the disease cannot be contracted by eating properly cooked chicken. Even then, the chicken consumption has fallen alarmingly due to panic, causing loss of crores to the poultry industry. Multinationals can check the drop by coming up with medicines.

 Kanai Saha, 

 Gauri Bari Lane

 Health is wealth and most people are understandably reluctant to risk their well-being. It is wrong to accuse the government and the media of spreading panic. They are only trying to make the public aware.

Md Tanweer,

 Gariahat Road

 It is quite possible that there is no basis to the perceived dangers of consuming chicken. However, it is human nature to minimise possible threats to life. No egg and no chicken is the right choice now.

 Chandan Ray,

 Sarsuna

 The boycott of poultry products is a result of panic, partially spread by the media. There is no need for an extreme reaction in our country, since no human case has been detected here.

 Satyen Biswas,

 Behala

 The advent of avian flu has put the fear of death in people. It is natural that most would go off chicken totally. However, chicken can be consumed without any risk after taking the necessary precautions.

 Dinabandhu Mukherjee,

 Behala

 The drop in chicken consumption is definitely a result of panic caused by the media. The majority has chosen to avoid chicken altogether instead of eating it after taking precautions. They are also not sure of the efficacy of the prescribed steps.

R.M. Paulmazumdar, 

 Shyamnagar

 Prompt action by the government to prevent spread of avian flu and timely publicity by the media are the reasons behind the drop in chicken consumption. Is there any reason for the public to risk an infection, for which there is no cure?

P. Pramanik,

 Santoshpur Avenue

 The possibility of an epidemic inevitably leads to panic. The fear manifests in the form of boycott of poultry products. People have become more circumspect since the government has gone on the back foot.

 Atif Ayaz,

 Serampore

 The media plays a pivotal role in people?s lives and can spread panic, as it has done in the case of avian flu. People have stopped consuming chicken without determining whether there is any risk involved. According to experts, chicken can be safely eaten after boiling.

 Govinda Bakshi,

 Budge Budge 

 In our country, the policy-makers 

 cannot care less about public health and dishonest poultry-owners 

 would not bat an eyelid before selling their diseased stock. 

 Naturally, the need for self-preservation overcomes all 

 other considerations. Any sensible person would avoid chicken 

 for the time being. 

Bhupen bose,

 Dum Dum

 Prevention is better than cure, which is why educated people have been avoiding chicken totally, resulting in a sharp drop in prices. This in turn has lured the poor into eating chicken. The media has played a part in spreading panic in this regard.

 Debahuti Bhattacharjee,

 Budge Budge

 The drop in chicken consumption is an outcome of precautionary measures. This is no panic reaction in eastern India, though no bird flu case has been reported here. It is certainly prudent not to consume egg and chicken as there is hardly any cure for the human version of the disease.

 Anirban Rudra,

 Behala

 Properly cooked chicken cannot spread the avian flu virus. However, the confusing actions and statements by ministers and government officials, and ban on chicken at important places have caused alarm among the people. Moreover, infrastructure to combat the disease is also absent.

 Anil Kumar Sen,

 Ram Chandra Chatterjee Lane

 It is the duty of the government and the civic body to warn people about possible threats to their health. But in the process, they spread panic among the people. The media, too, played a part in scaring people regarding avian flu. Unfortunately, other potent threats to public health, like sale of cut fruits on the road, seldom receive such attention.

 B.N. Bose,

 Dum Dum Park

 The drop in chicken consumption is definitely a result of panic, since most people are not aware of the causes and characteristics of bird flu. The poultry owners need to take precautions so that the disease does not spread, but the people can go on consuming properly cooked chicken as the infection has not been detected near Calcutta yet.

 Susanta Kumar Bedajna,

 KB Sarani

 People are not avoiding chicken due to panic. Poultry products are easily substitutable and that has caused a drop in their sale. Since there isn?t a reliable testing system in place, people have thought it prudent to be cautious. The media, too, has played a role in scaring people.

 Sourish Misra,

 Salt Lake

 People these days are well-informed and health conscious. They do not want to risk their lives and hence have stopped eating poultry products. I don?t think people are panic-stricken, they are just taking precautions.

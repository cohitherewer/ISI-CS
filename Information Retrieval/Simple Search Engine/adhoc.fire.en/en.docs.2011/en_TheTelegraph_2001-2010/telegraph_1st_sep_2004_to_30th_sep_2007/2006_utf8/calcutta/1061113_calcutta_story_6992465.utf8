The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Health zone, hooch den

 Hard Talk -Borough 

 X

 AROOP BISWAS, Trinamul 

 Congress MLA and chairman of Borough X , met readers of 

 The Telegraph to answer their queries. Participants included 

 Atanu Mukherjee, Radha Kanta Mukherjee, Tapan Dasgupta, 

 Anil Sinha, Subrata Chaudhury, Md. Kasem, Narayan Chakraborty, 

 Dilip Halder, Joydeep Mukherjee, Sandip Banerjee, Md. Aramatullah 

 Gazi, Ashok Basu and Suprobhat Mukherjee

 Atanu Mukherjee: MR Bangur Hospital is the common mans 

 mainstay for healthcare facilities of the area. 

 But it is confusing now 

 whether it is a state-run hospital or a resting place for 

 the dead or a free trade zone for illicit liquor and drugs. 

 It is unthinkable that 

 even after the news of the kit scandal came out in the newspapers, 

 contaminated kits were used in the hospital till November 

 3. It received World Bank funds for setting up a burns unit 

 and an ICCU, but they did not materialise. Can you do something 

 to help?

 Matters are so at MR Bangur Hospital 

 and, for that matter, at every state-run hospital because 

 over the past 10 years or so, our health minister Surjya 

 Kanta Mishra himself has become smarter as health minister 

 but his lack of initiative and vision have throttled the 

 health department and the common people .

 It is fact that if a patient dies 

 at MR Bangur Hospital, it takes 12 to 15 hours time to 

 remove the body.

 I had written to the health minister 

 three months ago, but he did not feel it necessary, even 

 for courtesys sake, to reply till date. I have come 

 to know that 156 posts are lying vacant in the hospital. 

 However, it is good news that 

 our leader Mamata Banerjee has granted Rs 10 lakh from her 

 member of Parliaments local area development fund for a 

 burns unit in the hospital.

 Joydeep Mukherjee: We are now bored with the governments 

 promises of cleaning up the Adi Ganga (Tollys Nullah). 

 Nothing has been done to clean it over the past five years 

 or so. 

 It is the failure of the state 

 irrigation department. When our Trinamul Congress-BJP board 

 in the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) had commissioned 

 the Southern Avenue drainage pumping station, the civic 

 authorities gave the state irrigation department Rs 2 crore 

 to clean up Tollys Nullah. The irrigation department 

 did nothing with the funds. 

 Radha Kanta Mukherjee: Tollygunge has a chronic problem 

 of water scarcity. When will it be solved? When will we 

 get water from Garden Reach?

 Before Trinamul took over the CMC board (2000-2005), water 

 crisis was a part of daily life all over the city. During 

 our Trinamul-BJP board tenure, Rs 400 crore was pumped in 

 to augment the water supply network. 

 It is unfortunate that thousands 

 of people living in the Tollygunge area have been suffering 

 unduly due to the worthlessness of the present Left Front 

 board. The suffering is due to a missing link of 150 meters. 

 Before we could complete the job, the new board had taken 

 over charge from us.

 Since our present mayor is a part-timer, 

 I think people living in this area will have to suffer for 

 two or three more years.

 There is no ward health unit in ward 94. A room on a CMC 

 plot which was proposed for a health unit has been occupied 

 by a local club and the then Left Front councillor Pranab 

 Mukherjee, instead of raising a protest, had supported the 

 encroachment. Can you recover this civic property and start 

 a ward health unit there?

 It is a good proposal and I will 

 working on it. I have already taken up the matter with the 

 parks and gardens wing of the CMC. I am told a notice has 

 been slapped on the club to vacate the room on CMC land.

 Tapan Dasgupta: About 10,000 residents living in 2,520 flats 

 in the Golf Green area have been subjected to rampant smoke 

 and sound pollution since the roads have been converted 

 into stands for private buses. Drivers and conductors ease 

 themselves in the open and a host of garages have mushroomed. 

 If this continues, we will have to shift elsewhere.

 You are a victim of politics. 

 There is a strong base of Citu activists there and your 

 voice will never be heard by our transport minister Subhas 

 Chakraborty. 

 The CMC is also responsible for 

 your plight, since it has allowed night parking of buses 

 on the roads in exchange of money. 

 I would suggest that you people 

 hit the streets and stage a movement. Make your grievance 

 heard. I will be with you.

 To be concluded

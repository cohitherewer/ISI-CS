 Two 12-hour bandhs, followed by a 24-hour bandh, and a 48-hour bandh that almost happened. It has been a December of disruption for those waiting the whole year round for a month of festivity.

 Preparations for Christmas start weeks in advance. There is so much to be done before hand, family and friends coming down With so much disruption this month, it definitely hurts preparations and sentiments, says Eugene Gonsalves, president, Catholic Association of Bengal.

 Even at New Market, the pre-Christmas spirit seems subdued. Was the Parkomat less of a hindrance? To add to our woes, a flurry of bandhs struck us just before Christmas, grumbles David E. Nahoum at Nahoums.

 Things are far worse for the Christmas decor shops on Free School Street. Business has been really small, compared to last year, complains S.K. Nooruddin from Gift Palace.

 Xmas business has taken a beating because of three bandhs in three weeks and the threat of more. With Christmas and New Year shopping, business does well... The bandhs, the unrest are taking a toll on the festive feel, laments David Chen, of a shoe shop on Bentinck Street.

 Mamata Banerjee did call off the pre-Christmas bandh, but some damage had already been done. Kookie Jar, for example, is counting its losses. There has been a substantial drop in orders compared to last time, for the December 21-22 period. We even had cancellations, says Lovey Barman.

 Some functions, too, were cancelled. Denise Smith, from the entertainment committee at Dalhousie Institute, expressed relief that the 48-hour hitch did not happen, but admitted that Fridays 22 celebrations at the club had to be pushed back by a day.

 Now, theres a small window for the festive feel to fight back. We lost three days because of bandhs, but sales have picked up well in the past few days, says Gautam Jatia, CEO, Landmark.

 Had the December 21-22 bandh happened, we would have ended up with dead stock. But now, Christmas sale is good, adds Gautam Shroff from Archies, City Centre.

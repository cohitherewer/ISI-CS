 Save the dome with the clock, from which the scaffolding has not yet been removed, Metropolitan Building on Chowringhee looks as if this century-old beauty has emerged from the plastic surgeons clinic after a complete makeover. It has a brand new epidermis and silicon implants at the right places to bolster its sagging fabric.

 But the wealth of stained glass on the Chowringhee and the SN Banerjee Road sides has been destroyed and replaced with sheet glass. If this is restoration, what is vandalism?

 Stained glass artist Katayun Saklat, who visited the building, said the rainbow-hued glass, which resembled Charles Rennie Mackintoshs, was part and parcel of the architecture. Planned with such thought and designed with such care, it could have been a masterpiece of a building, she added. This building that once used to house Whiteway Laidlaw, the most luxuriant department store on this side of the Suez, is listed as a heritage structure by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation. That makes it immune to structural change, but what could be worse than this?

 Soon after the Life Insurance Corporation decided to restore both this building and Queens Mansion on Park Street after nearly two decades of neglect, there was a concerted effort to strip the building of its Italian marble flooring. The water sprinkler, that was a fire-fighting device, was removed.

 Now, a couple of years after the restoration project began and crores were spent, the building interior looks like the contractor is trying to demonstrate what happens when a bull invades a chinashop. After Thursdays shower, it poured inside. 

 Not just the floors, even the beautiful wooden staircases were waterlogged. Work on the walls, floors and roof has all been left incomplete. So, even before the mortar gets time to set, it is washed out by the pipeline deluge.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 I regularly travel from Budge Budge to Sealdah by train. 

 Everyday the train is late by 20-25 minutes . Currently, 

 due to the introduction of special ticket checking inside 

 the train, the situation has worsened further. Every day, 

 the train is stopped for more than 10 minutes and the passengers 

 are checked. Due to this, the commuters are late for work. 

 I request the authorities to introduce a system like in 

 Metro trains, where we can punch in our tickets and automatically 

 move in. 

 Name withheld on request. 

 How to solve the traffic situation in Calcutta is a million-dollar 

 question. The traffic congestion near AJC Road and Jawaharlal 

 Nehru Road crossing (near the Haldiram outlet) is tremendous 

 during the peak hours. It is practically impossible and 

 quite dangerous to cross the roads at any time of the day. 

 I request the authorities to take some steps.

 LAST LAP : Prosenjit with Rituparna

 The two leading stars of Tollywood have finally come together to finish a half-done project, abandoned three years ago.

 Prosenjit and Rituparna Sengupta are currently shooting for Laatsaheb the film was originally named Prem Pratidan at Technicians Studio.

 Shooting for the film had begun in 1999-2000 but was shelved soon after as the two stars fell out. Filming resumed again in 2003 only to be derailed once more.

 In seven years, the film has passed the hands of three directors. It started off with Tapan Banerjee before falling into the lap of Jahar Biswas. Now, Shankar Roy is calling the shots. The storyline, too, has meandered over the years and taken on different shades for several reasons led by the continuity factor.

 Prosenjit and Rituparna have finally given bulk dates for the shooting, also at Bharat Lakshmi Studio and various outdoor locations.

 Mega water project for Bypass, Behala

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 Filtered surface water may finally flow to the areas along EM Bypass and the fringe areas of Behala, Tollygunge and Jadavpur, now dependent solely on deep tubewells.

 To achieve this, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation is planning a 30 million-gallon- daily (MGD) water-treatment plant in Dhapa and five booster stations. Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya submitted a proposal to the Centre last month and sought Rs 120 crore under the National Urban Renewal Mission. 

 The mayor has set 2010 as the deadline for commissioning the projects, which will benefit around 1.5 million people.

 ?Most of southeast Calcutta and 10 wards in Behala and Garden Reach are still served with water from deep tubewells,? said Bhattacharya.

 Municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay added: ?Supply of filtered surface water in Calcutta proper ? from South Sinthee to Tollygunge ? and a few places in Behala and Jadavpur has been regularised to a great extent. But there are still some pockets in east Calcutta and the added areas where there is no alternative to deep tubewells.?

 More and more people will move to the eastern fringe and the added areas of Behala, Garden Reach and Jadavpur. ?Keeping this in mind, we must be prepared with all civic amenities,? he pointed out.

 According to the commissioner, the supply of filtered surface water fell short of demand by 109.5 million gallons in 2001. The shortfall has been reduced to 52.15 million gallons and the civic body plans to further cut it down to 9.5 million gallons by 2010.

 The Calcutta Municipal Water and Sanitation Authority (CMWSA), too, has taken up a project to set up a three-MGD booster pumping station in Garden Reach.

 The CMC now runs 12 booster stations, including the Watgunge unit, commissioned on Sunday. Two more, in Jorabagan and New Park (Tangra), will be unveiled this month.

 According to engineers in the water supply department, the 30-MGD water treatment plant in Dhapa will cost at least Rs 80 crore. The five booster stations, part of the project for which the mayor is seeking central funds, will be set up in James Long Sarani and the Mukundapur, Panchasayar, Telipara and Siriti areas.

 The proposed station in Telipara, chief engineer (water supply) Bibhas Maity said, will serve the pockets in Tollygunge, Jadavpur and Kasba that are beyond the reach of Garden Reach waterworks and the Garfa booster pumping station.

 The Siriti station will serve residents of Behala, particularly on the banks of Tolly?s Nullah, and those in Mukundapur and Panchasayar will serve areas on either side of the Bypass.

 The booster station on James Long Sarani will be for the residents of the stretch between Sakherbazar and Thakurpukur.

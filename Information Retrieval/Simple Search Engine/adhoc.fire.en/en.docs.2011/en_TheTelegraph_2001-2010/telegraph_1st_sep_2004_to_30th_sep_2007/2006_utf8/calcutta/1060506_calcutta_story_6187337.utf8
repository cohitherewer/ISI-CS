The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Threat to family draws state frown

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The state government has taken note of CPM councillor Swapan Saha?s threat to Saraswati Sinha, that he will not allow her children and her to return to their Kalidham house, in Dum Dum.

 ?I have asked the North 24-Parganas administration to report why the CPM councillor and his men went to Kalidham after their release on bail on Thursday,? home secretary Prasad Ranjan Roy said.

 Metro reported on Friday how Saha had threatened Saraswati when she went to Kalidham to inspect the remains of her home ? a part of which the councillor and his aides had wanted for a club ? and oversee construction of a bamboo fence.

 ?Tora ja ichhey kor, eikhane toder thakte debo na (You do whatever you can, but we will not allow you to stay here),? was what the councillor had told the mother of two.

 Saha had led a mob that ravaged Saraswati?s home and assaulted her children, Somnath and Runu, last Friday. Runu had suffered severe head injuries.

 Acting on a directive from the state human rights commission, the government announced on Friday that Runu would be treated free at Nilratan Sircar Medical College and Hospital.

 A home department official confirmed that the government was bearing Runu?s medical expenses because the family was in no position to arrange for the funds.

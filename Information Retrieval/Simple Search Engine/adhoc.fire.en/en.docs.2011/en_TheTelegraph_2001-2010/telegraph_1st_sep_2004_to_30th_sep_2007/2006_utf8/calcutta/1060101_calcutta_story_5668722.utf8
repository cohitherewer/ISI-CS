The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Life

 Greens are for grooving

 The McDowells Signature and The Telegraph 31st Nite at Tolly came alive to the sounds of band Cascade from Goa on stage and DJ Tushqa at the console. With emcee Barry Brien chatting em up in characteristic style, the party was swinging well before the midnight hour. Tolly, as always, is a top draw for the 31st night party. The music is cool, the crowd decent and the ambience just right, said a club regular. Picture shows people partying at the club on Christmas Eve

 The Royal Challenge and The Telegraph 31st Nite at Royal Calcutta Golf Club teed off with emcee Shefali Talwar hogging the spotlight and DJ Akash drumming up a festive beat. The hot item to follow closer to the witching hour was a sizzling performance by Parmita Katkar. File pictures of DJ Akash and Shefali Talwar

 Cement slabs to replace kerb stones from Satna

 - Break in 200-year-old tradition

 Environment concerns forced the city civic authorities to discontinue the 200-year-old civil engineering tradition of using sandstone slabs from the Vindhya plateau as kerb channel and kerb stone for roads. But doubts have already been raised about the efficacy of the modern material it is being replaced with.

 The authorities have been using the sandstone blocks of Satna district in Madhya Pradesh ever since the first road was metalled in 1794, 20 years after Calcutta was declared as the Indian capital.

 ?As we do not get quality sandstone from Madhya Pradesh any longer following restrictions on quarrying imposed by the Supreme Court, it will be replaced with pre-cast concrete slabs,? said municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay.

 For over 200 years, engineers of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) have used Satna kerb stones to border the pavements. Sandstone was used for laying kerb channels to carry run off water from the surface of the city roads to the underground drainage system.

 The civic authorities started using RCC (concrete) slabs from last month after the CMC central store recently ran out of its sandstone stock.

 According to civil engineering department?s estimate, over 1.25 crore pieces of sandstone slabs are in use as kerb channels and kerb stones on the roads in Calcutta. The CMC?s average annual requirement was 8,000 slabs. 

 The last consignment of sandstone that the CMC received comprised 22,000 pieces in 2000-2001. The central store has almost run out of stock of sandstone, said Rihan Sanyal, controller of stores and purchase. Chief engineer (civil) Nilangsu Bose feels that by replacing sandstone with RCC slabs the cost of maintaining the kerb channels and kerb stones will spiral. 

 Bose said although a kerb stone is more expensive than a concrete slab but it lasts longer. A sandstone slab costs Rs 180 but it used to last 50-70 years unless it was damaged during maintenance work. The biggest advantage of a stone slab is that it is resistant to acid.

 An RCC slab, on other hand, costs only Rs 102 but its longevity has not yet been put to test.

 Civic engineers are not sure about the longevity of an RCC slab when used as kerb channel since the run-off water of city roads is acidic and will react adversely with the lime mortar used in the RCC. Besides, the iron rods used as reinforced material to cast the RCC blocks may get corroded in two-three years and the slabs may develop cracks.

 Chocolates and chilles

 SHAUN KENWORTHY

 Okay. Weve taken a lot of 

 flak over the years for our food and quite rightfully so 

 for most of it. But Im going out on a limb here saying: 

 We Britishers make the best cakes and puddings in 

 the world!

 Im not talking about desserts 

 here, oh no. None of that namby pamby stuff. We can leave 

 that to all other Europeans. Im talking about the 

 Real McCoy: about Treacle Pudding, Apple Pie and Custard, 

 about Jam Roly Poly, Plum Crumble, Bakewell Tart, about 

 Trifle Pudding.

 l things Dickensian, the stuff 

 that really sticks to your ribs. No nonsense use of that 

 margarine, yoghurt and whole-wheat flour stuff, but real 

 butter and suet. Proper sugar and treacle. Double and clotted 

 cream. Dirty horrible stuff that fills you to the brim but 

 keeps you coming back for more.

 Lets face it, you really 

 know youve had something after youve eaten a 

 stodgy Chocolate Pudding with a gooey filling ? you just 

 dont get the same pleasure from a Cream Caramel.

 Wouldnt it be great to start 

 a revival of all things bad? Since I cant open a restaurant 

 tomorrow, I will do the next best thing. Talk about British 

 cakes and puddings and dig out a lusty recipe.

 Wed have to go back some 

 billion and thirty years to have some understanding of the 

 great British pudding.

 Even if you are going to start 

 with the humble Apple Pie, you have to go way back to about 

 1540. The first recorded account of the Apple Pie dates 

 back to Henry Tudors days. And what would Christmas 

 be to the world without Christmas Pudding?

 The basics of Christmas Pudding 

 in a more porridgy form date back to around the 1400s. Mrs 

 Beeton wouldnt be so famous if it hadnt been 

 for her writings about cakes and puddings. Shes a 

 legend.

 Her book on household management 

 was a bestseller in Victorian England and is a good seller 

 even today. It reinvents itself every few years.

 I suppose she was the first celeb 

 chef of her time and her book was the first publication 

 that listed everything that makes a household run, from 

 stain removal and polishing copper to gardening and skinning 

 a rabbit. Ive seen a lot of old copies of her books 

 here in Calcutta. 

 Her Trifle, Victoria Sandwich 

 and Battenberg Cake are legendary.

 This weeks recipe is for 

 Mrs Beetons traditional Trifle. Enjoy! 

 Trifle Tips

 You will need a 400 gm sponge 

 cake. Cut it in half and spread on around 4 tbs of a good 

 strawberry or raspberry jam. Lay the other piece on top 

 and cut it into 2 cubes and place them into the bottom 

 of a serving dish.

 Next, sprinkle the contents of 

 1 small can of mixed fruit cocktail that has been drained. 

 You could use fresh fruit but it wont be the same. 

 Douse the whole thing in 150ml of sherry or the juice from 

 the can if you have to.

 You will then need to make the 

 custard. Bring to boil 500 ml of milk and 50 gm sugar in 

 a saucepan. In a small bowl, add 2 tbs custard powder to 

 another 50 ml of milk and stir well until dissolved. Whisk 

 this into the boiling milk and continue whisking for a few 

 seconds until the custard is nice and thick.

 Remove from the stove and strain 

 through a sieve over the sponge and fruit mixture and make 

 sure it is spread evenly. Set aside and allow to cool.

 Lastly, spread 200 ml whipped 

 cream over the top and sprinkle with toasted flaked almonds. 

 You could also garnish the top with a few halved strawberries 

 when in season.

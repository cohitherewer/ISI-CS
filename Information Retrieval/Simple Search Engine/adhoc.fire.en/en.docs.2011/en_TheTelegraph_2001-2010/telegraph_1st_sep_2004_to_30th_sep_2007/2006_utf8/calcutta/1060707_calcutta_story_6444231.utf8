 Combining imagination and art with poetic vision, the collages of Mitali Dey (one of them appears above) articulate her views on a host of personal and societal concerns. The ongoing exhibition of her collages presents seven of her recent works based on the theme of women. A riot of vibrant colours, they portray women in their many moods, miens and mannerisms. Some of her works also depict present realities, and are an expression of her own attitude to the world around her. Her most colourful collages are like illustrated verse and deal with love and mythology. In fact, a refined romanticism is the hallmark of her art, which is heightened by her technical brilliance and evocative artistry. Assembling and fusing together brightly-coloured torn paper, Dey creates multi-layered art works by balancing expansive colour fields with sketchy lines and bold application of brush-strokes. The show also features paintings by Pritwish Sikdar, Monimala Dey Basu and Naba Kishore Chhanda.

Cellu-elder VICTOR BANERJEE takes it easy as Bong Connection 

makes its way from the land of Gurudev to the beaches of Galveston on a search 

for self identity

Houston, Texas. Not far from NASA?s HQ, the Bong 

Connection had lift-off on the 14th of March, Dol Purnima, before the planetary 

ides of Chaitra descended upon adventure capitalists Joy B. Ganguly and Shauvik 

Kundagrami, who are focused on creating a new world for Indian Cinema, via Bengal.

Anjan Dutt, who has established himself as a director 

who thinks differently, is exploring new worlds and refuses to be drawn in by 

the gravitational forces of commerce and cheap popularity.

In his new film, he deals with the ?cross-over? dichotomy 

of two young Bengali men who reach eastward and westward, for their roots and 

for opportunity, only to discover that, oceans apart, the green, green grass of 

home has acquired an indefinably strange pallor on both sides of the ethno-cultural 

divide.

Film is such an expensive medium of communication 

that, if, at the end of the day, one doesn?t recover one?s investment, a director 

can find himself without a job and an investor will hiccup and go back to base 

metals and consumer durables for a positive return and a good night?s sleep. 

In such a harried and uncertain world, it?s films 

like the Bong Connection that prove that there are some people still willing 

to stake their reputations and bucks on creativity with a ?difference?. In spite 

of shooting in locations that are visually stunningly appropriate, Anjan hasn?t 

lost sight of the bottom line in his commentary on the evolution of the Bengali 

in modern society ? where traditionalism and conservatism are the essential values 

that have set Bengalis apart from the rest of the pack who have been devoured 

by consumerism and a lust for financial abundance far beyond the essentials of 

humanism.

As a cellu-elder I have had the luxury of being able 

to sit back in the shade of palm trees and watch young Bong enthusiasts sweat 

it out under blazing Texas skies. While I am fussed over and treated to fabulous 

dinners and lunches, the young turks from producers down to production hands bite 

the bullet, work long hours and survive on workers? lunches and snacks that would 

devastate Citu trade unionists in Tollywood.

But as the sun sets on the beaches of Galveston, we 

all miss Calcutta.We miss wallowing in self-pity, economic woes, gastric ailments 

and feisty recriminations about our social and cultural degeneration. To relieve 

my pains and sorrows, the unit prepared a fabulous farewell meal of ilish maachher 

tele bhaja jhaal and chingri maachher malai curry that I tucked into 

till I choked at the gills and then packed some into a suitcase for my poor daughter 

who is starving on smoked salmon and blueberry cheesecake in Ohio.

The Bong connection worldwide is a bloodstream of 

love, hospitality and compassion that will make this self-searching film a work 

to remember.

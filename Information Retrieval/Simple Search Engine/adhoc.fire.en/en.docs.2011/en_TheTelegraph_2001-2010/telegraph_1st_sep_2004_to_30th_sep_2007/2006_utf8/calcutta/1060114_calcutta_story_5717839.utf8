The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 A reason to smile

 - Superstar sojourn, straight from the heart

 PRATIM D. GUPTA

 ?SAB THEEK HO JAYEGA!? Shah Rukh Khan plants an affectionate one on the cheek of four-year-old Meghna Ghosh, suffering from a malignant tumour in her leg. Picture by Aranya Sen

 Four-year-old Meghna Ghosh was detected with a malignant tumour in her leg when she was just two. Her mother hasn?t stopped crying since. On Friday afternoon, the mother and the daughter finally found something to smile about.

 The ?something? in question: Shah Rukh Khan blessing Meghna, kissing her cheek, and whispering into her little left ear, ?Sab theek ho jayega.?

 The cancer ward of the new annexe of the AMRI Hospitals in Dhakuria was almost a replay of the final frames of Kal Ho Naa Ho. Only this time, the hero wasn?t confined to his deathbed, but was breezing through the ward, spreading charm and cheer among patients who clapped and smiled, gaped and giggled.

 ?You are not only the pride of India, you are the pride of the world,? shouted an elderly man, before clasping the King Khan?s hand to his forehead.

 ?My grandson broke his leg trying to dance like you,? complained an old lady. ?Don?t worry Ma?m, even I?ve had to get stitches while trying to dance,? was the prompt answer from the 40-year-old, bending over to hold the grandmother?s hand and drawing a grateful smile.

 And all this came straight from the superstar?s heart. ?My father died of cancer and I have always wanted to do something for people suffering from the disease,? Shah Rukh told Metro. ?I am planning to start a special ward at the Nanavati Hospital in Mumbai.?

 Bollywood?s badshah was more keen to talk medicine than movies. Checking out technical facilities in the south Calcutta hospital, he said: ?I have spent almost two years in several hospitals around the world for my back... I have come across clinics who serve Lebanese and Mongolian food to patients!?

 When it came to his own Friday lunch, Shah Rukh helped himself to some Continental-style chicken and green salad, followed by notun gurer mishti. On an even sweeter note ? for Calcutta?s ears only ? Shah Rukh said: ?I am happy Dada is there (in the team for the Lahore Test).?

 But even Sourav could not have drawn the crowds on his home turf quite like SRK did. Hundreds lined Dhakuria bridge and every approach road, waiting for hours for a glimpse and a goodbye wave.

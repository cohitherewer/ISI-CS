 Four days after the murder of Trinamul Congress vice-president Sachin Mukherjee, the police on Thursday claimed a breakthrough with the arrest of one among three assailants. The trio, on two motorcycles, had gunned down the 65-year-old leader on Sunday evening in Sonarpur.

 Twenty-eight-year-old Biswajit Saha, alias Kalu, was arrested on Friday afternoon from a hideout near Malancha cinema, in the Regent Park police station area.Police recovered three country-made revolvers and 13 rounds of cartridges from him. The black motorcycle Biswajit was riding on Sunday has been seized.

 ?The three were promised Rs 1 lakh for the strike. The first instalment of Rs 30,000 was paid the day after the killing in Kharagpur. Armed with the money, the trio kept shifting base from Kharagpur to Rampurhat to Burdwan before finally returning to the city,? said S.N. Gupta, South 24-Parganas superintendent of police.

 Police claimed to know who had given the supari to the gang but chose not to divulge details till the other arrests were carried out and the case was cracked.

 A resident of Panchpota, in Garia, Biswajit had a criminal record, claimed police. The tip-off about his involvement in the murder came following interrogation of those detained during investigation.

 Police said his two missing accomplices were in their early 30s and had criminal records.

 On Sunday, around 9 pm, Mukherjee had received a call on his mobile phone just as he was leaving his office on Kali Chatterjee Road.

 As Mukherjee stepped out, phone glued to his ear, he was gunned down by the three youths. With a Saraswati puja immersion procession proceeding down the road, not many heard the bullets being fired. Police later said two bullets were fired, of which one pierced his chest.

 Family members of Mukherjee, who had contested the Assembly by-election from Jadavpur in 1980, said the three youths had on an earlier occasion trailed them to Narendrapur. They had inquired about the leader?s whereabouts and then disappeared.

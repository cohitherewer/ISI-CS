 A successful author is one who has the ability to write, the capacity to find the backing of a good publisher, and who does not allow himself to be sucked in by publicity, thus letting his personality overshadow his work. 

 Which is why Amitav Ghosh prefers to let his books do the talking. 

 I have seen so many young authors being destroyed by the spotlight. The book becomes secondary, which is very dangerous for literature. In fact, authors get so much publicity these days that readers often approach a book through their knowledge of the writer, said Ghosh at a programme at Max Mueller Bhavan auditorium on Sunday.

 While he admitted that this is often the work of publishers, since the industry needs cult figures, he was quick to add that the writer or those around him are often as much to blame. A case in hand is that of Kaavya Vishwanathan. She was my student at the time when there was all that controversy surrounding her book. She was a bright student. She deservedly suffered for what she did. But the reaction against her was all the more fierce because the limelight had been so much on her to begin with.

 He added: The publishers had just picked up on her and tried to sell her as another pretty young face from India with a book to her credit and did not judge the actual merit of the book. But her parents, too, let slip the amount she was paid.

 The author of The Shadow Lines, The Calcutta Chromosome and The Hungry Tide, however, made it clear that all publishers arent alike. There are many publishers who have been and are very supportive of authors struggling to make a name for themselves. If they have faith in a writer, I have known publishers to go on supporting an author.

 The closest Ghosh came to having the focus on himself rather than on his books was when he withdrew his nomination for the Commonwealth Writers Prize. I knew I was inviting attention. But I was not comfortable with the tag. I had to say that. So I decided that I will give it a week of my time one week when I answered every question related to the subject, appeared on every news channel that asked me to talk about it, and then put it behind me completely. And thats exactly how I did it, he smiled.

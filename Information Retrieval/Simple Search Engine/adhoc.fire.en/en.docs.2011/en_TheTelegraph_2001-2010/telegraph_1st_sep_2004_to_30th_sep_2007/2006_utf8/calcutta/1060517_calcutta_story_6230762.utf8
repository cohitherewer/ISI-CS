The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Cell service revamp

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Cellular service provider Airtel plans to put up 400 new cell sites across the city by the end of this financial year to improve coverage and clear mobile congestion.

 ?Around 150 sites will be added by the first quarter itself,? said Ajai Puri, Airtel?s recently-appointed chief operating officer for Calcutta. 

 The company now has around 600 cell sites in the city.

 Puri admitted that there is a lot of scope for improvement of Airtel?s service in Calcutta.

 ?We have a couple of big launches for voice and data planned for this year, but the focus will primarily be on improving the voice service quality,? said Puri, who was heading Airtel?s Orissa circle prior to joining the Calcutta circle.

 The service provider has recently completed a change of technology partner from Siemens to Nokia. 

 ?We had set aside around three months for the transition. Currently, we are performing the fine-tuning and optimisation processes,? Puri explained. ?The idea is not only to improve connectivity on the road but also within buildings.?

 The new chief operating officer would be working towards bridging the gap with Hutch and making Calcutta a key focus area for Airtel.

 Hutch currently has 10.29 lakh subscribers in the Calcutta circle, compared to Airtel?s 6.47 lakh.

 ?We are looking at making the experience for new users even more delightful, from the first call to introduce him to the features to the address verification and first bill,? Puri offered. ?But at the same time, we would like to intrude as little as possible in the user?s life, stepping in only when he wants us to.?

 Value-added services are also set to play a major role in Airtel?s plans in the days ahead. ?Value-added services account for around 15 per cent of our business nationally. Globally, the trend is a higher figure.?

 Recently-launched services like Easy Music, where users are able to buy ringtones off the shelf, are catching on as well, Puri added.

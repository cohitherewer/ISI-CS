 What: 

 An exhibition showcasing the spring-summer collection of 

 Ekru.

 Where: The boutique at 1/4 Rowland Road.

 When: Till April 29.

 Take a look: Comprising both pret and diffusion wear, the line boasts a spectrum of vibrant hues, interesting prints and embellishments. Traditional embroideries like kantha and zardosi get a contemporary makeover when combined with prints and textures. A variety of womens wear comprising kurta sets, kurtis, tunics, skirts and Indo-westerns come in white with silver work and creams with gold. Theres also a line in pale hues to suit the season.

 The age-old churidar kurta is revamped with innovative silhouettes, detailing and finishes like pleating, tucking, applique, puckering, cut-work and tie-and-dye.

 Draped uppers are teamed with ruched pants, harem pants and boot-laced churidars, lending an international appeal to traditional Indian outfits. Knits have been combined with chiffons and muls with minimalist embroidery and block prints. Shell embellishments along with antique metal work decorate fluid feminine fabrics like chiffon and lace, with a lot of crochet trimmings.

 There are more formal lines in kora and gold trimmings of crochet, tissue and frayed detailing. 

 Pocket pinch: From Rs 1,500 for casuals to Rs 8,500 for formal wear.

 Voiceover: The collection is a mix of traditional and modern, the richly sensual and the serene. It is an ode to the feminine form and expresses itself in soft fabrics and vivid hues. The silhouettes are finely tailored and structured to give an ultra feminine look. It is colourful and very wearable, designed for the modern Indian woman, says Ruchira Kandhari from Ekru.

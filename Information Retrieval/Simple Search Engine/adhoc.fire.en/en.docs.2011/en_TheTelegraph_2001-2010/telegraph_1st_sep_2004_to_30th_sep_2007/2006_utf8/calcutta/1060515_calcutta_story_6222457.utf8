The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Prostitution hits the Net

 - Sleuths draw up list of youths who solicit via websites

 PRONAB MONDAL

 My name is Raksuda, 23. 5 ft 6 inch and 115 lbs (52 kg). Measurement 34-26-34. I can set your bed on fire at the cost of 100 USD for an hour.

 Raksuda is a click-of-the-mouse away, thanks to prostitution on the Internet.

 An investigation conducted by the city police has revealed that prostitution in Calcutta has hit the Net in a big way, with both girls and boys ? all educated and from well-to-do families ? declaring that they are ready to ?be with you? for money.

 Rajeev Mishra, deputy commissioner of police (special), detective department, admitted that prostitution via the Net is on the rise. ?Some are advertising on websites independently, while others are involved with agencies,? he said. ?We will crack down on those involved in such activities. Prostitution is not lawful here and no one can claim that he or she can serve a client in exchange of money.?

 As part of a drive against e-prostitution, the city police are preparing a list of boys and girls who are using the Net to solicit clients. ?Tracking them won?t be difficult, as most of them mention their cellphone numbers and email addresses on the websites,? said a detective department officer.

 Sleuths have come across at least 50 agencies that have placed lists of girls with obscene photographs on their websites. 

 ?These girls are known as escorts. The agencies claim that the girls, some of them top models and actresses, can be hired by business executives to accompany them on trips in and outside the country. Some of the girls are fluent in English, French, Japanese and other languages,? said another officer.

 He cited an example: ?An agency mentioned on its website that it offers qualified women from well-off families, who were trained in the UK to provide service Kamasutra-style. The cost of hiring the girls starts from Rs 15,000 and for some, it runs into lakhs. The agency also claims that it has tie-ups with some famous resorts and hotels.?

 Police have come to know that the agencies have links in several cities.

 An officer working on the case said: ?The girls manage to keep their families and friends in the dark about their identity as prostitutes. Many of them have good academic records and entered the seedy world to earn some fast money. Some, of course, do it for fun.?

 Mishra said: ?We don?t need to catch them red-handed. The advertisements are evidence enough to handcuff them on charges of inviting people to have sex in exchange of money.?

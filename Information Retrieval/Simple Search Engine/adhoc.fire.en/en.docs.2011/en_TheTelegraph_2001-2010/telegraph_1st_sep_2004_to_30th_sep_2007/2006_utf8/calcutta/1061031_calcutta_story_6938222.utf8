A murder mystery set in Washington, directed by a 

US-based Bengali film-maker with Roopa Ganguly and Rituparna Sengupta (picture 

right) starring as sisters, is creating quite a buzz. As much for an unconventional 

plot and Tollywood cast as for its curious title, Piyalir Password.

 Raj Basus debut in Bengali cinema is as much about sibling bonding as it is about corporate conspiracy and medical ethics, set in the biotechnology world of USA.

 Co-starring Sabyasachi Chakraborty and Kaushik Sen as the leading men with a host of Indian-American actors who have had a brush with mainstream American films, Piyalir Password hit the floors on October 16.

 Its a fast-paced suspense thriller set in the Greater Washington metropolitan area Maryland, Virginia and Washington DC where a young woman from India comes to complete the legal formalities of her scientist sisters accidental death. But she soon discovers that the death was not accidental; there was a conspiracy behind it. And shes determined to unravel the mystery, director Raj Basu tells Metro via e-mail.

 Since the story of Piyalir Password is based in the US, the characters speak English. There are some scenes where American actors interact with the principal Bengali actors, says Basu, who has written the story and co-authored the screenplay with Saumitra Neogy.

 Sabyasachi will be seen in the pivotal role of Samar Sen, a scientist who carries the thread of mystery. Local US actors include Indranil Mukherjee, Samrat, child artiste Wadia Mahzabeen and Ena Sarkar from San Francisco who will debut in the film.

 Piyali Ray is a very interesting character. I will be playing a scientist and my look will be very different. My accent will have to be slightly American too, but that wont be a problem, says Roopa, looking forward to yet another challenge.

 I am very excited. Its an unusual story of a woman who tries to find out a secret about her sister, adds Rituparna.

 The Howard County of Maryland, the upscale areas of Potomac in Maryland, Virginia, Fredrick and the Port City of Baltimore will form the main setting for indoor and outdoor shots.

 Vivek Banerjee, who was behind the camera for Escape From Taliban and Shunyo Theke Shuru, is in charge of cinematography. The rest of the crew is a mix of Indian and American technicians.

 Piyalir Password would be Basus second feature film, after Wings of Hope starring Roshan Seth, Deepti Naval and Suresh Oberoi. Made for the Indian American community, the award-winning English film explored issues like drugs, violence, pre-marital sex and abortion.

 Basu worked as writer and director of television programmes in Virginia before graduating from Hollywood Film Institute with a diploma and certification as independent filmmaker and producer.

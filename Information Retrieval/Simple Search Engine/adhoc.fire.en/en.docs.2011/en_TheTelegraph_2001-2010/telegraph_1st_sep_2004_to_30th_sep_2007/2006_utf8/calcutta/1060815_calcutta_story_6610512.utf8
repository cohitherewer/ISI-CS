Life

 Manish magic, one more time

 Grunge and glamour. Sporty 

 and sexy. The haute-o-meter of KANK is as hot as it gets. 

 The Bollywood couture king shares the starry style secrets 

 with Shradha Agarwal 

 When you design for Karan Johar, where the script is so clear, he knows when and what he wants to tell and how he wants to tell The path is clear, the characters are well-etched. What remains to be seen is who brings what to the table begins Manish Malhotra, costume director of Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna, a film that is sunning itself in its first-week glory.

 The designer has a reason to bask in his own glory, too, glad that the KANK look has worked. Glad to open his flagship store in Dubai and glad to do the finale of the Wills Lifestyle India Fashion Week in Delhi next month, Manish admits he has never been happier.

 So how was it, designing for so many sexy stars for KANK? A different ballgame, very different from the short denim skirt and bra top look, he says, hoping that KANK sets the fashion mood for the next season very classic, very stylish. 

 I think we had too much of the in-your-face sexy, hip-hop look. KANK is a bold film and the characters arent dancing in college anymore. The well etched-out characters looks had to establish them further, says Manish.

 From mad moments when he was shouting at Rani and Preity to show more cleavage, please to last-minute location changes to unfinished costumes to last-minute shopping and as a result being recognised as a shopper in New York, Manish had a crazy schedule. 

 He talks to GoodLife about the five leading looks. 

 Shah Rukh Khan

 Real yet glamorous is how Manish likes to describe King Khans look. Shah Rukhs state of mind in the film is basically bitter and his grunge, distressed look reflects just that. Thrown in between are lots of sporty elements given his professional background, he adds. 

 Just in case SRKs look is thought of as boring, Manish reminds us of the embroidered red rose on the back of the black jacket in some sequences. 

 Haute highlights 

 The colour palette is 

 very masculine lots of blacks, browns with streaks of 

 gold and silver. 

 The look is layered. A 

 jacket-tee-tracks combo seen most often. 

 Lots of prints-on-prints 

 and emblems. 

 A single textured brown 

 bag all through the film because guys dont change 

 their bags everyday. 

 Manishs pick 

 His look in Mitwa is mind-blowing.

 Amitabh Bachchan

 Everyone knows about his flamboyant character Sexy Sam and that he always manages to carry off everything he wears with such panache and style. But AB Seniors size 54 (till 50 was available) was impossible to find in any shop. We even had to buy white leather pants to extend the shoulders of his white jacket, says Manish. 

 Haute highlights 

 His collection of glasses 

 was eye-catching. Karan wanted glasses and we couldnt 

 decide on one, so we decided to go with a whole range, just 

 for fun and variety, adds Manish. 

 Mostly black suits with 

 a dash of vibrancy in the form of shocking shirts in pink 

 or red. 

 Lots of fur detailing 

 around the jacket collars. 

 Manishs pick 

 The black velvet suit I got made in Mumbai for Rock--roll soniye is my favourite. 

 Abhishek Bachchan

 Hes a media guy, an event person, so typical New York suits wouldnt be his style. His approach had to be casual, yet formal, and above all, his personality was sober, so nothing over-the-top for him, says Manish. 

 Haute highlights 

 New York isnt about coloured suits. So his look was more on the lines of black and charcoal.

 Lots of detailing under 

 the collars. 

 His hottest statement: 

 blue jeans-white shirt-black blazer combo.

 Some shirts were in happy 

 colours and striped. Some in schemes of pink and purple 

 while others in green and blue.

 Manishs pick 

 The black suit from Rock--roll soniye again. 

 Rani Mukherjee

 Ranis character in the film is obsessed with cleanliness and her outfits needed to reflect that too. Hence the structured, minimal look, very fuss-free, says Manish. 

 Haute highlights 

 Lots of skirts that were 

 fitted near the hips and waist and flared gradually. Not 

 mermaid cut and not tent-like, the silhouette was fitted. 

 The skirts were paired 

 with fitted knits, many of them V-necked.

 Lots of corsets were seen, 

 too, because corsets and skirts are the sexiest combination. 

 Also, Manish feels that non-boned corsets complement Rani 

 and have the capacity to lend a slimming effect to 

 anyones stomach and waistline.

 They played 

 with earrings and some song sequences also saw her in beads 

 around her neck, just to look more exotic. 

 Her chiffon or net saris 

 were romantic and they were paired with velvet 

 blouses and halters. Some shaded, some lace and other sequinned, 

 Karan wanted a touch of black in all, something that Manish 

 feels brings about a certain softness and femininity.

 Manishs pick 

 A rust lehnga for Kajol in KKHH, Kareenas pink in K3G and a powder-blue and skin for Preity in KHNH We didnt know what to do with Ranis bridal lehnga in KANK so it was back to traditional red and gold with a dash of green. Anyway, red and gold are the fall-winter colours for the season. I also loved her saris in the film.

 Preity Zinta

 Shes playing a fashion editor and so her look had to be very individualistic and with it. Nothing she wore could look off-the-shelf. Like, we teamed her green dress with boots instead of strappy sandals. Everything about her was glam, be it her night-clothes or even her track pants or bags.

 Haute highlights

 Her outfits had surprise 

 co-ordinates, not at all typical. 

 Lots of short skirts and 

 also some fitted gowns. 

 The colours were both 

 bright, gold and skin tone was used liberally. 

 She was seen in many New 

 York, Soho style vintage jackets.

 Up-to-date accessories 

 like the long maalas.

 Tongs were used to give 

 her hair a feminine lift.

 Manishs picK 

 I love her fuchsia and gold look in Wheres the party tonight. So sexy, so glam, so Preity!

 The civic authorities have finalised a proposal for a standardised design of guard rails and road dividers and will soon forward it to the state government for approval.

 Once the nod comes, all private and public agencies will have to follow the design while erecting guard rails and road dividers across the city. 

 The agencies include the police, Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners (HRBC), West Bengal Tourism Infrastructure Development Corporation (WBTIDC), public works department (PWD), and Calcutta Improvement Trust.

 As for the existing guard rails and dividers, a makeover will be undertaken so that they conform with the approved design. 

 As HRBC and WBTIDC do not get any maintenance funds, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation will carry out the makeover job for them.

 The two agencies have been asked to submit an estimated cost for the makeover of the dividers and guard rails they have installed.

 BBD BAG (Dalhousie Square), where the civic body has taken up a beautification scheme, will not come under the project purview, mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya announced.

 To reach a consensus on the design of guard rails and dividers, municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay on Friday held a meeting with the chief traffic and transport planner of the transport department, managing director of the WBTIDC and the deputy commissioner of police (traffic).

 All the agencies felt that road rails and dividers must have specific designs by which the thoroughfares can be identified. 

 Deputy commissioner (traffic) Jawed Shamim said his department had already accepted a design approved by the transport department. 

 The civic commissioner requested him to send a copy of the design, along with related parameters. The design, however, is yet to be handed over to the CMC. 

 ?If we find the design with the city police is compatible with the roadscape we have in mind, we will take it up with the government for its acceptance by all agencies,? commissioner Bandyopadhyay said on Wednesday.

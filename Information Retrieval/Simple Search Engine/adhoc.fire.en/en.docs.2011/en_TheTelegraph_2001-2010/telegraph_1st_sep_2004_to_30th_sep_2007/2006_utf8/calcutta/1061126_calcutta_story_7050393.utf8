The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 High on style, 

 low on substance

 BlogLog

 The cool cops and robbers have 

 blasted their way into the blogs. But the first reactions 

 are at best mixed for the Aishwarya-Hrithik-Abhishek-Bipasha 

 starrer Dhoom 2, which opened on Friday.

 Meetu (http://withoutgivingthemovieaway.blogspot.com) 

 says: A theatre screening of Dhoom 2 is not where 

 you want to be if you are looking for a slick plot, well-defined 

 characters or quality acting. But if you are an action movie 

 buff and enjoy watching good-looking people, it is certainly 

 worth a trip to the halls.

 Prashant (http://bulusu. blogspot.com) 

 feels the film is worth a watch only if you are a hardcore 

 Ash or Hrithik fan.

 Srini (http://srininoir. blogspot.com) 

 is the harshest: When the sole objective is to dump stars 

 into one rehashed effort, redundancy is a consequence... 

 The sequel bundles the blunders of Dhoom with an 

 extra dose of suffering. The movie after a while seemed 

 like an over extended special feature of a DVD.

 But it is not all downhill for 

 D:2. Sriram Iyer (http://theiyer.blogspot.com) 

 in a blog titled Style + Class + Bikes + Bikini = Dhoom 

 2 writes: Watching D:2 on the first day of 

 release at Mayajaal (Chennai) was worth the long drive and 

 the expensive tickets. Stunning stunts. Glitz and glamour. 

 Exotic foreign locales. Bikinis and Rio festival. But he 

 too admits that the story is a no-brainer and the screenplay 

 hard to believe.

 The redeeming feature is Hrithik 

 Roshan, according to most posts. Srini says Hrithik looks 

 so cool that theatres can shut off their airconditioners... 

 If you miss the title sequence of this movie, a third of 

 your investment is lost...!

 Kaushik (http://kaushikmitra.blogspot.com) 

 observes: Abhishek Bachchan... is never able to rise in 

 Hrithiks presence... The camera scans Bipasha Basus anatomy 

 at regular intervals to add some titillation to the thrills... 

 Aishwarya Rai doesnt look sexy despite wearing a variety 

 of skimpy dresses.

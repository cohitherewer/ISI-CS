 Gautam Yadav: Killed at age 7

About three-and-a-half months after the murder of seven-year-old Gautam Yadav in Kasba, Ashok Sarkar was arrested at his residence on Friday on the basis of his confessional statement.

 District superintendent of police S.N. Gupta said: ?We arrested him after he broke down during a marathon interrogation and confessed to the murder.?

 Gautam went missing on October 2 from his residence on GS Bose Road. Subsequently, his father Parmanand Yadav lodged a missing diary with Kasba police station, in which he named Ashok as the prime suspect. On the basis of his complaint, police picked up Ashok but released him on bail after interrogation.

 Not only the Yadavs, but also their neighbours had a hunch that Ashok was the prime suspect, going by his behaviour and the company he kept. But they did not dare to speak out, as he was close to some local police officers.

 But after Gautam?s skeletal remains were found in a bush adjacent to Lumbini Park hospital on January 16, police again picked up Ashok for further interrogation, and arrested him on Friday. Police suspect that Ashok had murdered Gautam as the fallout of a family feud. 

 According to police, Ashok told them that he had offered Gautam a samosa laced with sedatives. 

 After the boy lost consciousness, Ashok took him to the field and suffocated him to death at a time when the place was deserted.

 Later, he placed a heavy stone on the body and covered it with a jute bag, in the hope that nobody would ever notice it. Carcasses of animals are dumped on the spot. He felt that no one would become suspicious of the stench as they would confuse it with the foul smell of decomposing animals.

 ?But all his plans went awry after some children, playing in an adjacent field, discovered the body. Gautam?s mother later identified the body by the brown T-shirt and blue jeans the boy had been wearing,? said police. 

 ?Ashok was friendly with some local toughs and terrorised the Yadavs,? they said. 

 The DNA report of the body is awaited.

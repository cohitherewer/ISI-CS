 Growing concern: An open drain in the Santoshpur area. A Telegraph picture 

 Sandeep Banerjee: Mosquitoes have been wreaking havoc in the Jadavpur area. Have you taken any steps to check the spurt in their count? Dengue and malaria are also on the rise. 

 The mosquito problem is not restricted to the Jadavpur area only. In most pockets of the city, where there are open drains or clogged and silted drains, the mosquito menace is inevitable. 

 In our locality, there are several open drains. These are breeding grounds of the mosquitoes. Fog guns and pesticides are of little use. To solve the problem, the open drains have to be covered.

 We have taken up a scheme to phase out the open drains by widening the roads. House-owners have been instructed to convert the surface drains to underground drains. We are also planning to organise awareness campaigns for the residents.

 Greedy sharks stun court 

 - Issued legal receipt for Rs 4 lakh, couple asked for more

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 A receipt for Rs 4 lakh on court paper, issued by a group of extortionists in Sonarpur to a couple wanting to build a farmhouse in their area, stunned two high court judges on Monday.

 The extortionists were now asking for Rs 2 lakh more to allow the couple to erect a boundary wall around the plot, a division bench of Justice A.K. Talukdar and Justice R. Banerjee was told.

 We are really surprised to know that even the extortionists here dare to issue receipts on court paper. What is going on here? The administration should be more active in handling these criminals, asserted the bench, while rejecting the anticipatory bail petitions of Rakhal Haldar and nine others, who were allegedly part of the gang.

 Jadavpur University professor Rama Prosad Roy and his wife Kaberi, a head clerk in the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, had purchased the 4.5-bigha plot in Kheyadaha village, under Sonarpur police station, last year.

 The Roys, who now stay in Jadavpur, visited the village in October this year to take possession of the plot and construct a farmhouse.

 A group of 17-18 people from the area told my clients that it would be impossible to build anything on the plot without paying them at least Rs 5 lakh, the couples counsel Rabi Shankar Chatterjee told the court.

 The two initially refused to pay the extortionists. But the other landlords in the area advised my clients not to go into a confrontation with the extortionists. They also advised the Roys to negotiate with the leader of the group and convince him to accept a smaller amount, said the lawyer.

 My clients requested Rakhal to take Rs 2 lakh and allow them to start work on the farmhouse. But he was not willing to accept anything less than Rs 4 lakh. The Roys paid the amount, but obtained a receipt on court paper from the group, Chatterjee added.

 According to the Roys counsel, when they were about to start construction of the boundary wall, another group of six to seven visited them with a fake sale deed of the plot and claimed Rs 2 lakh.

 My clients were sure that Rakhal had sent the men. Instead of paying up again, they lodged a complaint with the additional judicial magistrate of Baruipur court on October 20. On the basis of the complaint, Sonarpur police started a criminal case against Rakhal and others, said the advocate.

 Appearing for the state, Jayanta Narayan Chatterjee opposed the anticipatory bail prayers.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 A scholarly sojourn in Singapore

 NISHA LAHIRI

Learning in the classroom...

 Wireless zones in school, college or university campuses, laptops that can be borrowed from the library, plug points under the desks to get connected, learning through PowerPoint presentations in class, homework uploaded online and the completed assignments submitted the same way, learning about research methods in Class VI-VII, and then conducting research on issues ranging from medicine to leadership ? an education system of the future in India maybe. But in Singapore, these are the norms, not the exceptions.

 Government schools in one of the world?s smallest countries are not to be shunned. Admission into them is much sought after. But everyone has access, because the literacy rate is 99 per cent. Just like everything else in Singapore, the education scene, too, is in a continual process of change. Nothing remains the same for more than a few years. Even the country?s national library recently made its third appearance in a glistening glass avatar. The newest thrust area in the education system is on more international interaction.

 No expense is being spared in this endeavour. In a tie-up with the tourism board, a team of educators and journalists from China, India, Bangladesh, Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Korea and Japan were taken on a tour to Singapore, to interact with schools and other educational institutions, with the opening ceremony of the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) on July 1 as the grand finale. The annual event?s 40th anniversary saw the first international participation this year in the form of a marching band and display team from a school in Thailand and another from Malaysia.

 ...And outside

The aim was to encourage inter-school exchange programmes. ?Singapore is a very small country. The students are isolated, they need to see more of the world. Through exchange programmes, they can get greater exposure. In turn, students from other countries can learn about us,? said Magdalene Lee, director, educational services division, Singapore Tourism Board (STB). Exchange programmes already exist, but the education ministry wants to expand it. 

 ?We at Hwa Chong Institution celebrate July as the International Friendship month. Students from 25 schools will be visiting us,? explained Joseph Tan, director of support services. And the award-winning choir from Anglo-Chinese Junior College (ACJC) is in Wales to participate in a competition, even as a group of Chinese students visit their school. ?They perform abroad frequently. Study must go hand-in-hand with other activities,? said principal Kelvyna Chan. 

 STB has published numerous brochures with information on how to go about planning an overseas trip for student groups. ?The idea is that the hospitality will be reciprocated. The visiting students, for whatever length of time, could perhaps not have to pay a fee, and could be put up with students? families to encourage cultural exchange through home stay,? observed John Conceicao, assistant director, educational services, STB. ?There are also different exchange programmes, like academic, music or sports based.?

 Extra-curricular activities ? or co-curricular in Singapore ? are encouraged through the Co-curricular Activities Branch under the education ministry. There is already a sports school for gifted students and a music school is underway. One non-academic activity is a must in senior school for every student. SYF is a method of supporting such activities, with a month-long schedule of events, from music to drama and sports.

 Skills in stagecraft

 Around 10-15 per cent of the students in Hwa Chong and ACJC are international (50 per cent of the students in Hwa Chong?s international school are foreign students, most on scholarships). The system follows the A-level and O-level Cambridge system, but with a curriculum that is tailored by the country for its students. After primary school is the senior section, and then junior college. 

 Finally, there are three universities or several centres for technical/vocational education. ?Singapore also houses campuses from international institutes like University of Chicago, with Australia?s University of New South Wales setting up shop soon,? added Lee. Attracting more overseas students to enroll themselves in Singaporean institutions is the long-term aim, particularly in higher education.

 Singapore Management University perhaps epitomises the country?s obsession with constant change and growth. It was set up five years ago with 306 students. Now, there are 3,800, with 20 per cent from overseas. ?The biggest piece of the pie, with 182 students, is India,? pointed out director Alan Goh See Bin. The institute has tie-ups with US universities for its programmes. The campus, too, has grown and continues to expand. Technology rules in the classroom, from the number and angle of writing boards in front of the class to the science of the semi-circular seating system.

?In the future, we want to establish Singapore as 

a hub of bio-technology,? signed off Conceicao.

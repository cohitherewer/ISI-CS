 What: Launch of Rollick Ice Cream parlour. 

 Where: 238B, AJC Bose Road.

 When: Friday afternoon with model Priyanka Pal providing the glam factor.

 Take a look: With the sweaty summer already making its presence felt what could have been better news than the opening of a new ice cream address?

 Tucked away in a narrow lane, opposite Bhawanipur college, is this new 700-sq-ft parlour. Plans of opening parlours at Salt Lake, Rajarhat and south Calcutta are in the pipeline.

 The wide range of yummy ice creams include Chocobar, Bon Bon, Nutty Roll and Keshar Kulfi.

 The array of mouthwatering sundaes on offer are Duet of Love (brownie with vanilla and chocolate sauce), Love at First Bite (ice cream cake with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce), Pineapple Passion (pineapple and vanilla ice cream topped with pineapple bits and sauces) and Wild Heart (peach halves with butterscotch and vanilla topped with sauce).

 In addition to the ice creams one can also sip on Fizzy Cola, Lime Cooler and an array of milk shakes while digging into patties, sandwiches and burgers.

 Pocket pinch: Prices start at Rs 12.

 Voiceover: ?The area is a happening place in the city but it lacked a proper ice cream parlour to be frequented with friends and family,? smiled co-owner Vinita Agarwal.

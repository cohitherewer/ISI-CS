 Open door to happy home

Feng Shui Matters 

Pinky Kapoor

 The entrance to the house 

 should always be as inviting as possible. This can be 

 enhanced by greenery in the form of lush gardens, healthy 

 plants and meandering pathways. The doorway should always 

 be well-lit, as darkness is symbolic of limitations 

 and leads to gloominess and depression. The healthy 

 energy that flows in such good surroundings keeps us 

 happy, smiling and in good health

 The concept of Feng Shui is based on inviting the vital energy in abundance into our environment. The smooth flow of Chi is essential for the prosperity and health of the occupants of a house.

 When we breathe in and out, the circulatory system is nourished by the vital cosmic energy, which is essential for our existence. Similarly, doors and windows along with hallways and passages become a part of the circulatory system of a home, which need to be nourished by the all-powerful cosmic Chi.

 The entrance to the house should always be as inviting as possible. This can be enhanced by greenery in the form of lush gardens, healthy plants and meandering pathways. 

 The doorway should always be well-lit, as darkness is symbolic of limitations and leads to gloominess and depression. The healthy energy that flows in such good surroundings keeps us happy, smiling and in good health. 

 The inflow of energy is best contained by building a threshold near the entrance. The main door should be solid and made of strong new wood. 

 Weak doors do not provide us with the protection we need. Care should be taken that the main door and the threshold are not cracked or broken.

 The walls surrounding the main door should always be well-painted and adorned with paintings and pictures. Weekly cleaning of cobwebs is a must. You should never clutter the entrance area with shoes.

 The main door should be the largest one in the house. It is considered inauspicious to have another door in the same line that is larger than the main door. 

 The height of the door should be double its width. Small doors restrict the flow of incoming energy, limiting opportunities for the residents. 

 Next, the doors of the bedroom should be smaller than the main door but larger than those of the kitchen and the bathroom. 

 Make sure that the main entrance to the building does not directly face a temple, a hospital, a police station, a hole in the ground, an electric pole or a tall tree. It should also not face a garbage dump. 

 The house should not be built at a dead-end where the main entrance directly faces the road. 

 One should not step over an underground water tank to enter the house. Water is akin to wealth and it is considered inauspicious to have a tank built beneath or near the main door. Building septic tanks in such vital areas is unfavourable, too. 

 Doors of rooms inside the house should open inwards, so that there is no obstruction to the inflow of Chi. When a door opens outwards, we find that the residents are deprived of the nourishing Chi and do not enjoy good health and harmony. 

 Drainage of health, wealth and loss of opportunity also take place when the main door directly faces a large window or a back door that is in line with it. In an arrangement like this, the energy flows right through and escapes. It also splits the rooms on either side into half, resulting in strained and split relationships. 

 Doors should not overlap with nearby doors as this leads to perpetual conflict between family members. Squeaking doors that make a lot of noise are also not considered healthy. Ensure that their hinges are regularly oiled and they open easily into the house.

 Equally important is to see that toilet doors do not open into the bedrooms. With this arrangement, the negative energy of the toilet flows into the bedroom and mingles with fresh energy. 

 If there are space constraints, sliding doors are most practical solutions. But these are never recommended for main entrances, bedroom and personal chamber doors.

 Provisions should be made to have good ventilation in all the rooms in the form of windows, where they open outside. This allows the house to inhale fresh air and exhale stale air.

 Tip of the week

 Place fresh green good-luck bamboo plants on the east or south-east of the entrance to invite new opportunities. This can be strengthened with vertical panels on the wooden main door, symbolising tree energy, which enhances growth in all areas of life.

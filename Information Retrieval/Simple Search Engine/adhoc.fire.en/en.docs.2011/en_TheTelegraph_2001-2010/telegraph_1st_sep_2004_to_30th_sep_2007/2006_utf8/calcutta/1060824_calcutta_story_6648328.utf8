 House tax judgment

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 The high court on Wednesday upheld an earlier judgment making it mandatory for the civic body to issue building-owners a copy of the hearing officers order explaining the basis of property tax revision, within 45 days of the decision.

 House-owners need the order to appeal to the building tribunal against the revised rate.

 Challenging the validity of an order by Justice B. Bhattacharya, also of the high court, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation had moved an appeal before the division bench of Justice Asim Banerjee and Justice Tapan Kumar Mukherjee. The judges rejected the plea and held that the judgment by Justice Bhattacharya was valid in accordance with law.

 Justice Bhattacharya had delivered the judgment on the basis of a writ petition by N.D. Narayan, owner of an apartment at Lipika Housing Cooperative Limited, in south Calcutta, in 2001. 

 My client was not happy with the hearing officers decision and decided to move an appeal before the building tribunal. But the officer did not issue him the copy of the order, stated Narayans counsel Alok Ghosh.

 When you are busy making plans 

 for Durga puja, dont forget to include your little pet 

 in the scheme of things. Its very difficult to get hold 

 of a veterinary doctor at this time of the year, as most 

 of them are either busy with their families or out on a 

 holiday. Their chambers remain closed. So, what will you 

 do if your pet falls ill? Dont worry, help is at hand. 

 Here are some emergency medicines that will not let you 

 down during the festivities.

 lIf or maybe when you take 

 your dog on a pandal-hopping trip, he may develop travel 

 sickness. The condition can worsen due to the crowd and 

 noise, and the dog may start vomitting.

 Tips: Administer your pet 

 Avomine or Perinorm tablet about an hour before you step 

 out of the house.

 We usually tend to gorge on spicy junk food from restaurants 

 and roadside stalls during the festive days and also feed 

 some of it to our pets. This may cause diarrhoea or vomiting.

 Tips: In case of diarrhoea, 

 administer Gramogyl syrup to a puppy, and Norflox TZ to 

 an adult dog twice a day. To check vomiting, use Domstal 

 drops for the puppy and tablets for the adult dog.

 Dont give him any food that day. 

 Instead, give home-made ORS add two teaspoons of sugar 

 and a pinch of salt in a cup of water.

 There would be lots of insects inside the pandals or on 

 the roads that your pet may want to taste. This might lead 

 to swelling of the mouth and ears. Pets also become very 

 restless, which is a symptom of allergy.

 Tips: Administer Phenergan 

 syrup to puppies and Avil 25 tablets to adults.

 You may bathe your pets with an anti-tick shampoo before 

 taking them out. If the shampoo gets into the eyes, your 

 pet may suffer irritation. If he happens to lick the shampoo, 

 there might be poisoning effects like salivation and shivering.

 Tips: Wash your pets eyes 

 with fresh water and then use an eye drop. To get rid of 

 the toxicity, give Atropine Sulphate injection.

 Your pet may suffer from sudden high temperatures, cough 

 and cold.

 Tips: Administer a paracetamol 

 syrup thrice a day to a puppy and tablets to the adult, 

 along with Mox syrup or tablet. 

 Dogs are affected by the sound of crackers during Diwali. 

 They run here and there, hide under the bed and also start 

 shivering.

 Tips: Give Gardinal 

 tablet (30 mg) twice on the day before Diwali. 

 Remember that the medicines I 

 have suggested are only for emergency use. These are not 

 permanent treatments. You should consult your vet as soon 

 as possible. 

 So, enjoy the Pujas with your 

 pet. If there are any problems, do mail me.

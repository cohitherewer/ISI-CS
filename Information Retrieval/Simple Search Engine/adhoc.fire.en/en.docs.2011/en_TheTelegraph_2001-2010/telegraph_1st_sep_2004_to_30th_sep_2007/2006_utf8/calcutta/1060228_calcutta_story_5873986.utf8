 Shift in B-school student profile

 BISWARUP GOOPTU 

 The gender profile of management students, heavily tilted in favour of the male till recently, has been charting a corrective course. 

 B-campuses across the country have been witnessing enrolment of an increasing number of girl students. 

 Case in point, ICFAI Business School. This year, the number of girl students enrolled with the Hyderabad institute from Bengal alone is around four times more than in 2003. Against 60 female students in 2003, a whopping 216 (of the 561 candidates from the state) have been admitted in 2006. 

 The same is the scene on Calcutta campuses. Analysing the reason, S.K. Bhattacharyya, dean of the MBA programme (day) at Indian Institute of Social Welfare and Business Management (IISWBM) said: ?Social and cultural values have undergone a sea change. The rise in the cost of living has resulted in families preferring more than one earning member. A working woman is no longer a taboo in India, and since an MBA means getting a white-collar job, acceptance is no longer an issue.?

 At his institute, Bhattacharyya pointed out, women comprise almost 35 per cent of the faculty. ?This suggests that landing a plum job is not the sole aim of female students. They are also interested in contributing to management education and research, a key to the success and growth of any B-school.?

 Shamita Chakraborty, programme coordinator at TASMAC Business School, agreed that women?s presence on B-campuses is on the rise all over the country. 

 Keeping pace with the changing gender profile of the student community, certain management disciplines are being designed in a way that they seem tailor-made for women. Human resources management and operations management have been identified as areas where corporates actually prefer a woman?s touch. 

 At the same time, sales and marketing, once considered too strenuous for women, have shed their exclusivist character. 

 ?A man or a woman, an organisation will always pick up the best person for the job,? said Santanu Ray, director ICFAI Business School, Calcutta. 

 Most Calcutta-based business schools say that around 20-25 per cent of their students are women, and they are optimistic that the number will rise significantly over the next few years.

 ?Since studying MBA is an intensive experience, one can say that women are better suited for it, as their commitment level has been found to be higher than that of male students,? said IISWBM?s Bhattacharyya.

 The management curriculum, too, is being continuously revamped to meet industry demands, leading to the courses being thrown open to students from a wider spectrum of academic background.

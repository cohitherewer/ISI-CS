 You share your birthday with...

 Goldie Hawn

 You excel in sports. You are smart enough to stay several steps ahead of competition. At work, you are reliable and disciplined, and perform well during emergencies. Management positions suit you well. You love devising game plans and schemes, and attack each of them with precision and vigour. Although strongly opinionated, you always play fair. Kusum Bhandari

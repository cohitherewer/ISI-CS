The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 The rapid increase in the population of stray dogs in most parts of the city is cause for serious concern. In the mating season, the dogs go on a biting spree. The lack of concern of the civic body is condemnable since the strays are a menace to pedestrians, especially the children and the aged. It also appears that the dog squad is not bothered about controlling the growth in the number of strays, most of which are diseased. 

 Sunil Banerjee,

 VIP Road. 

 An estate, consisting of 13 four-storeyed buildings, is currently coming up at 3, Jamadar Khan Lane. For about a year, the residents of the area have had to suffer the din of building material, including iron beams, being moved at the construction site in the dead of the night. The buildings are now nearly complete and the floors are being tiled. All through the day, machines used for cutting marble slabs create a terrible racket. There?s also a huge amount of stone-ash in the air, threatening the lungs of the residents. Complaints to police have borne no fruit. 

 Md Moinuddin, Jamadar Khan Lane. 

 I am a subscriber of the Home 500 plan of BSNL?s DataOne broadband service. This plan features unlimited free download between 2 am and 8 am. However, during this period, the connection speed slows down considerably. Many of my friends have even got disconnected. Repeated complaints have fallen on deaf ears.

 Tuhin Purkayastha,

 Parnashree Pally.

 Formed in 1990 in Berlin, Ostkreuz is considered one of the best-known photography agencies of Germany. As a union of photographers with individual tastes, styles and perspectives, the group stands for photography which looks beyond just showing a ?beautiful picture?. Ostkreuz: Images of Germany presents eight photographic sequences by Wolfgang Bellwinkel, Sibylle Bergemann, Annette Hauschild, Ute Mahler, Thomas Meyer, Jordis Antonia Schl?sser, Anne Sch?nharting (Childhood; picture above) and Linn Schr?der. Featuring a broad spectrum of work, its ?eight photographic positions? examine the present condition of German society, with a special focus on the changes that have taken place over the last 20 years. Touching on people?s personal desires and ambitions, the pictures portray a snapshot of society in a state of flux, in which people may be troubled by a degree of insecurity, but also see opportunities for a new beginning.

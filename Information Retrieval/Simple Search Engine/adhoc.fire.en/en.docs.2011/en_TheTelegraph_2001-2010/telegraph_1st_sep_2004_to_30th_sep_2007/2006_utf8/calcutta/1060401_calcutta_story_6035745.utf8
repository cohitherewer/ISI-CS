 Funds lifeline for child hospital

 - ELABORATE REVIVAL STRATEGY DRAWN UP

 KINSUK BASU

 The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government has finally turned its gaze on the cradle of crib deaths, deciding to pump in Rs 21 lakh for its overhaul.

 Starved of facilities resulting in the bouts of deaths over the past few years, BC Roy Memorial Hospital for Children, the only referral centre in the state for paediatric ailments, will have ?all the necessary? instruments installed with the corpus.

 ?An overhaul blueprint, with 2007 as the deadline, has been worked out for the hospital,? said director of medical education Jayashree Mitra. 

 ?As the first step, we have sanctioned a huge amount for installation of the instruments that are essential for smooth functioning of the hospital. Besides, a proposal for creating some additional posts has been forwarded to the finance department,? she elaborated.

 The amount was sanctioned a few days ago, following deliberations by senior officials of the health department, including Mitra and secretary K.K. Bagchi, on how to end the vicious cycle of crib deaths. Before finalising the blueprint, both Mitra and Bagchi had visited the hospital in phases to take stock of the situation.

 Officials said the bulk of the amount would be spent buying instruments that either the hospital does not have or are lying defunct at the 25-bed hospital in Narkeldanga. 

 The list includes paediatric ventilators, arterial blood gas analysers (required for operating the ventilator), radiant warmers and pulse oxymeters.

 Another set of instruments will be procured with the Rs 70 lakh that former Indian cricket captain Sourav Ganguly had donated to the hospital a few years ago.

 The gadgets will be installed in an annexe building of the hospital, being constructed by the public works department (PWD) for the past year and a half. The PWD has been asked to speed up construction and hand over the building by April. 

 The annexe will house 110 additional beds, a neo-natal intensive care unit and a paediatric intensive care unit.

 The health department has sought a detailed procurement list for the annexe from the hospital authorities.

 ?If you take into account the amount Ganguly had donated, we definitely have a huge corpus for the hospital?s upgrade,? said superintendent Mrinal Kanti Chatterjee.

 The requirement list for the annexe, he added, will be submitted to the government soon.

 A part of the government?s allotment will be set aside for procuring life-saving drugs and doing up the kitchen on the ground floor of the three-storeyed building.

 Other beneficiary: The 

 health department has also decided to release Rs 14 lakh 

 for Chittaranjan Seva Sadan, another state-run hospital, 

 that has been struggling for years to treat the ever-increasing 

 flow of children, including newborns.

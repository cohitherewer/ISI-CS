 What: 

 A preview of Khaddyotsov 2006 food festival.

 Where: Institute of Advanced Management, AN Block, Nayapatti, Salt Lake.

 When: Saturday, 7 pm onwards.

 Take a look: Dishes and welcome drinks from several tropical coastal islands, mouth-watering snacks and endless entertainment were served on a silver platter at the hotel school. The dress rehearsal for the island fiesta offered exotic creations from Malaysia, Hawaii, the Caribbean islands, Mauritius, Seychelles and Sri Lanka.

 If this was a treat for the taste buds, your eyes could also feast on the models sashaying down the ramp. Celebrity chefs Davide Cananzi and Shaun Kenworthy selected the best dishes served up by students. 

 The mega event is scheduled for the evenings of December 16 and 17 at Wet--Wild in Nicco Park, in sync with the theme of seafood. Along with an array of delicacies, there will be fun and games at the water world for kids.

 The spread: Guests could choose from cocktails and mocktails like Hawaiian Blue (vodka, pineapple juice, blue Curacao), Stormy Weather (grape juice, pineapple juice and Sprite) and Tropical Ecstasy (gin, cranberry juice, milk and sugar syrup).

 For starters there was Bahama Fish Fritters, Singapoori Torte (curried vegetables in a crispy spiced shell) and Pirates Coin (ground chickpea with spices). Move on to soups like Mauritius Gumbo (tangy coconut-flavoured vegetables with seafood) and a salad spread titled Captain Nemos Garden comprising items like Srilankan Banana Salad and Waldorf Salad (dices of apple with walnuts, mayonnaise sauce and garnished with celery).

 The main course or Beach View consisted of items like Jamaican Jerk Chicken, Balinese Spicy Chicken, Hiri Kodi (Sri Lankan spicy fish), Corn Lai and Vietnamese Ensuite (pan-fried eggplant with mushroom, corn and herb crust).

 There was also a live barbecue counter and desserts like Mississippi Mudpie, Bob Marley (mango nuts flan), Caribbean Gateaux (carrot pineapple walnut cakes with butterscotch ice cream) the list was endless.

 Voiceover: Khaddyotsov means great exposure for first and second-year students who learn not just about the food but also about the various cultures and traditions of the islands, said Joydeep Sarkar, F amp;B manager of the Institute of Advanced Management.

 Speed skate

 What: Sixth Annual Roller Skating Championship 2006.

 Where: Space Circle club.

 When: December 10.

 Take a look: Organised by JM Skating Academy in the basement of Space Circle, there were separate speed-skating events for boys and girls between three and 16 years old. Freshers and medal holders alike zipped by at breathtaking speed while parents sat around the skating track cheering the young ones.

 Participants were judged on the basis of time trial, speed skating and synchronised skating. A group dance on skates in step with the beats of music kept the audience entertained. Snacks and cold drinks did the rounds and the winners were handed out certificates and prizes.

 Voiceover: Our skating academy is a platform for students with potential. Besides annual championships, we also have camps. The National Skating Championship will be held later this month, said Mau Mitra, joint-director of JM Skating Academy.

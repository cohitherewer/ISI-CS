 What: Tales of Tradition, a fashion show featuring jewellery by Tanishq and designer clothes.

 Where: Calcutta Swimming Club.

 When: December 29.

 The show: Called Tales of Tradition, it was divided into Part I and Part II, comprising a total of eight sequences choreographed by model Tina. 

 Models Priyanka Kohli, Jessica, Tina and Ishika among others sashayed down the ramp, showcasing a fine blend of both traditional and contemporary jewellery by Tanishq. Special emphasis was on the wedding collection and clothes by the boutique Simaaya to go with the jewellery.

 Fashion focus: While the first sequence was entirely about traditional jewellery, the second one highlighted designer ornaments inspired from Indian motifs for every occasion, teamed with cotton, silk, georgette and crepe saris by designer Neeta Bhargava. The next sequence showcased glittering diamond neckpieces paired with silver embroidered black salwar suits and saris. The fourth sequence was about Tanishqs new Bindi Collection in rubies, highlighted along with Sayon Mitras fusion line. 

 The final sequence on Tanishqs latest collection of Kundan jewellery teamed with designer Mandira Wirks equally stunning collection of saris stole the show.

 Sip bite: Guests were seen digging into a wide variety of snacks. The kebabs and fish fingers flew the fastest, going down well with the drinks on offer.

 The grumble: Like most fashion shows in the city, this too started almost 90 minutes behind schedule with the guests waiting under the cold December sky. Lengthy announcements in between each sequence also hampered the flow of the show.

 Model Ishika showcases an ensemble from Kali, a designer boutique located at 17, Alipore Road. It houses creations by Anita Mody, Chanda Gupta, Madhu Jain, Geisha, Deepika Gehani, Cue, Aki Narula and Niki Mahajan.

 Silk splendour

 What: The annual exhibition of printed silk and south Indian sarees at Design.

 Where: The boutique at 108, Raja Basanta Roy Road.

 When: Till January 16.

 The exhibition: On offer is a whole range of block-printed saris in silk from Bishnupur, Murshidabad and Bangalore in vivid colours and fascinating designs. The printed tussar and kalamkari printed silks in muted shades on offer are also great picks. And there is a range of costume jewellery in silver and gold from the boutique Soumyas Creation to accessorise the saris.

 Pocket pinch: The silks are reasonably priced between Rs 1,100 and Rs 1,500, while the tussars start from Rs 1,900 plus. 

 The jewellery comprising earrings, neckpieces and bracelets start at Rs 200.

 Voiceover: I have been designing block-printed saris for the past 34 years and that is undoubtedly the speciality of my boutique. I am now keeping kalamkari and embroidered stuff because of the changing tastes of people, but it is still my block prints that are the main draw, says Parmita Vishwanathan, proprietor of Design.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Next weekend you can be at ... 

Pedong

 Aquiet resort town, Pedong is 

 ideal for tourists seeking solitude. But it will also satisfy 

 those looking for adventure. 

 About 23 km north-east of Kalimpong, where West Bengal, Sikkim and Bhutan meet, Pedong, situated at a height of 5,100 ft, is yet unspoilt by the ravages of tourism. The hamlet offers a panoramic view of Kanchenjunga to the north-west and the ranges in Bhutan to the east. 

 Many rewarding walks and trekking trails originate at Pedong. It is generally more enjoyable to venture into the forests than to trek the hills on the Darjeeling side.

 The village is a paradise for bird-watchers. Some rare species of Himalayan birds can be seen here.

 Those not ornithologically inclined can go for walks along paths fringed with oak, pine and birch. The shifting hues of the snow in the sunlight will take your breath away. The turquoise sky and mountains covered in snow inspire many to click or paint for hours.

 Pedong came into prominence after the end of the Anglo-Bhutan war. For close to 150 years before that, the area was the epicentre of Bhutanese administration.

 Damsang, a Bhutanese fort now 

 in ruins, is located just outside Pedong. Another must-visit 

 is the Pedong monastery, constructed in 1837. A Roman Catholic 

 Mission was established here in 1882 by a French priest 

 named Father Desgodins.

 Of the numerous beautiful walking trails around the hamlet, the road to Tinchuley deserves special mention.

 Three-and-a-half km from Pedong, Tinchuley offers a spectacular view of the Sikkim Himalayas, Kassang Valley and Cinchona Plantation. It is being developed as a tourist spot.

 You may trek to the nearby places of interest or hire a jeep. Nature-lovers should not miss Rikkissum, also known as Rissisum, at a height of 6,410 ft. It is only a six-km drive from Pedong. A terrific view of Rishi Valley in Sikkim is the other attraction of Rikkissum. 

 Ramithey is about six-and-a-half km from Pedong. You will have to drive through a thick, dark forest to get there. Apart from Kanchenjunga, one can see the Teesta snaking down the highlands from Ramithey. 

 Damsang fort, the seat of the 

 last Lepcha king Gayboo Achok, is seven km from Pedong. 

 This place, too, offers a view of Kanchenjunga and other 

 peaks.

 Silent Valley is on the road that leads to Rikkissum. There was a lake here once, but it has now dried up. One can get a glimpse of Green Valley as well as Cinchona Plantation from here.

 The other important tourist destinations 

 are Cross Hill Point and Eco-tourism Village.

 Going 

 Jeeps are available from Kalimpong 

 to Pedong at regular intervals. Buses leave Siliguri twice 

 a day for Pedong. It is also connected with Darjeeling and 

 Gangtok by road. Jeeps are available for local sightseeing

 Staying 

 Hotel rooms are available at reasonable 

 rates. However, the facilities on offer are basic. Damsung 

 Guest House is a good option. It offers rooms with attached 

 bath. For reservation, contact tourist office at 4, Shakespeare 

 Sarani

 Trips 

 There are several tourist spots 

 close to Pedong. Darjeeling is about 75 km away, while Gangtok 

 and Siliguri are about 85 km from Pedong. Lava is 25 km 

 and Lolegaon 38 km from the hamlet

 Timeshare for tour 

 During the craze to buy permanent 

 holiday homes, timeshare was looked upon as a creaky relic 

 to be filed in the history of leisure travel. But it is 

 coming back into fashion with families seeking ever more 

 cost-effective methods of holidaying. 

 Resort Condominiums International 

 (RCI) is a leader in the field ?with over 85 per cent share 

 of the global market?. The company runs 3,700 resorts in 

 100 countries, with 40,000 members and 50 resorts in India. 

 It is soon going to open an office in Calcutta.

 ?Places such as Darjeeling have 

 been favourites with Calcuttans, who don?t necessarily want 

 to break the bank to get away. In Darjeeling and many more 

 areas, RCI will be providing affordable options for holidays,? 

 said a spokesperson for the company. Nepal, Sri Lanka and 

 the Maldives have recently been added to RCI?s repertoire.

 Flexibility and diversity seem 

 to be at the forefront of RCI?s approach to timeshare, with 

 the customer paying according to the time of the year and 

 the destination. After an initial one-off payment, transaction 

 fees are charged for each holiday. The transaction fee for 

 an Indian holiday will be Rs 3,675, while an international 

 holiday will cost Rs 9,450. 

 RCI has of late been seeking to 

 broaden its appeal, with women at the top of the target 

 list. The spokesperson explained: ?We recognise that women 

 will often be the ones choosing the location and planning 

 the logistics of a family holiday, so we want them to not 

 only be attracted to the timeshare concept, but also fully 

 understand what is available.?

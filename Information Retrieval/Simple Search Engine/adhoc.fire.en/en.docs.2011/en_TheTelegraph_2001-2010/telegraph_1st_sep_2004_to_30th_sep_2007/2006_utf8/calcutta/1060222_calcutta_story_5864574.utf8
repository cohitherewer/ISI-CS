 Leather luxury lair

 LIFESTYLE ZONE

 RIDDHIMA SEAL

 Spread over three sprawling floors and 5,000 sq ft space is a brand new exclusive leather boutique, a first-of-its-kind in the city. Located on Plot No. 3, Mirania Gardens, East Topsia Road, Stanley opened its doors on February 10.

 The swank boutique done up with neon lights and designer tiled flooring houses a luxurious collection of sofas, couches, chairs and much more, in pure leather.

 At Stanley, we dont consider furniture to be mere products. They are everlasting investments in style and luxury. We have the best of world furniture here under one roof, claims Sunil Suresh, CEO of Stanley Seating, the parent company.

 The design team at Stanley can tailor the furniture dimensions to fit your space and also alter the styling to suit the ambience.

 The three-storeyed boutique, not far from Steel Junction, is divided into separate sections with model living rooms, lobbies and lounges.

 There is also a leisure section called La-Z-Boy that recreates a relaxed home ambience. The other section stocks office furniture meant to lift the mood at the work station without trivialising the setting.

 Sofa story

 Done up with glass and wooden tables and exotic stand lampshades, the sofa section displays plush leather single ones and extended sets as in a real living room.

 The show stealers in this section are sofas embellished with Swarovski crystals that add a touch of real class.

 There are also chairs in a combination of steel and leather that blend classic and contemporary styles quite well.

 The range of leather available enables you to match the shade of the sofa to the colour story of your room.

 We have placed the furniture in a way that anyone who picks up a piece can get an idea of how to display it at home, says Sunil. 

 A customer can also walk in with a design of his/her own and have the furniture crafted accordingly.

 Prices of the single sofas start from around Rs 25,000.

 Office space

 The first floor area stocking office furniture replicates a work space done up tastefully with corporate chairs and leather tables. There are also cabinets and computer tables in a combination of wood and leather. Innovative lighting wall effects and floral arrangements add to the setting. The leather used in all our products is porous, fire resistant and anti-static, offering immense flexibility, says Khagesh M. Agarwal, director of the boutique.

 Take it easy

 The La-Z-Boy section boasts the recently launched line of recliners from the brand, displayed in a home theatre set up. The range offers high recliners as well as the really low ones, all done in solid comfortable leather. Customers can lie down on the recliners and find out the model that suits them best before buying, smiles Sunil. Prices of the recliners start at Rs 65,000.

 What: 

 Celebrating 20 years of Sananda.

 Where: The Oberoi Grand 

 Ballroom.

 When: Wednesday evening, 7 pm onwards.

 The bash: A mix of professionals and some of Calcuttas most glamorous made up most of the crowd. A free-flowing bar and an exotic spread kept the guests happily busy. A chocolate cake flaunting a proud 20 was also cut amid great applause and cheering. 

 E-quotient: Pop band Aasma, the young foursome of Jimmy, Vasudha, Neeti and Sangeet, took the stage early in the evening and got the crowd grooving in no time. 

 Original Aasma tracks like Life main lafda and Chandu ke chacha alternated with popular old numbers, Chand sa roshan chehra, Om shanti om and Annies song, but the show-stealer was I am my own inspiration a theme composed specially for the Sananda bash. 

 Also spotted: Designer Sharbari Dutta, actresses Roopa Ganguly, Koneenica Banerjee, Indrani Dutta, actor Sabyasachi Chakraborty, Derek Brien, adman Ram Ray and Jimmy Tangree.

 The journey so far: The journey that began on July 31, 1986, celebrated two hugely successful decades. Targeted at the middle classes who harbour an aspiration to reach beyond and a home-loving professional, Sananda has managed to connect in more ways than one by sticking to its mantra ghare baire samaan tale.

 The content was varied and vast then and is more so even now. Fashion, health, beauty, lifestyle, career, food, relationships, sex The answer to every possible question was in Sananda. 

 Koneenica agrees: Come what may, Sananda will always be considered a girls best friend.

 Entertain right 

 for recognition 

Feng Shui Matters 

Pinky Kapoor

 According to Feng Shui, one can entertain 

 guests in the southern or north-western sectors of the 

 house. The southern sector is good for entertaining 

 business associates as this area is related to the fire 

 element. Entertaining foreign buyers in the north-western 

 sector helps increase networking with them

 Q: 

 I have bought a new flat, which is quite 

 spacious. I am into leather export business and have to 

 entertain foreign buyers when they come to India. Is there 

 any Feng Shui suggestions as to which sector of the house 

 should be kept for such guests?

 Siddartha Suri

 THE SOLUTION: The energy of the southern and the north-western sectors of the house can be tapped for entertaining guests. When they are entertained in the southern part, which is ruled by the yang fire energy, it not only gives a boost to your business but also brings lot of name, fame and recognition from your business associates. Create a vibrant and a lively atmosphere here with warm hues of reds and maroons. 

 The north-western sector is connected 

 with mentors and influential people. Entertaining foreign 

 buyers in this area would help to increase your networking 

 with them. Create an ambience with earthy and metallic colours 

 and artefacts, which will help generate favours from business 

 connections.

 Finance fracas 

 Q: 

 I quit my job in January 2006 and 

 started commodity trading with crude oil, gold and sporadically 

 with silver and copper. However, I was very successful till 

 the end of March and gained a lot out of it. But in mid-April, 

 I lost heavily and am unable to get back to the earning 

 mode again though there are plenty of opportunities still 

 existing. Should I continue with the above-mentioned business 

 or should I look for a job to sustain my living? I was born 

 on June 13, 1964 at 6.30 am.

 THE SOLUTION: According to your pillars of destiny, you are a weak water person born in mid-summer. Hence, any work related with water or metal element is recommended for you. The above mentioned business falls in this category. 

 You entered into the period of water from this year, which made you powerful to gain wealth. But unfortunately, it was the year of clash. Your animal sign Dragon clashed with the Dog, which is the ruling animal of the year. One needs to be very careful in these clash periods and derive support from the animals that work as mediators between these two animals and help in making them friendly. 

 Wear a locket of a rabbit or keep 

 its picture close by to bring you luck. You can continue 

 with this business, but at the same time be careful in investing 

 money this year. Always face east while working and surround 

 yourself with shades of blue and metallic colours.

 Trade talk 

 Q: 

 I have a small export business 

 for the last couple of years. My date of birth is 28.07.1969 

 at 1.30 pm. Please tell me how my business will fare in 

 the coming years and what will be my financial status in 

 the next five years. Also, advise measures to improve the 

 business.

 THE SOLUTION: Fire, earth and metal rule your self-element wood, according to your pillars of destiny. Presently, you are going through the fire period, which means that your creativity is at its best. This helps in expansion of business, but you must play very safe with your finances from the year 2010 to 2016. During this period you will be under the influence of the wood element, which will not be tolerated by your ruling elements. 

 Earth element being most prominent in your chart reveals that you are loaded with wealth. So always remember to keep it happy by introducing it in its actual form and its associated colours in your immediate environment. These would be beige, cream, yellow, rust and brown. Always face north while dealing with your foreign buyers.

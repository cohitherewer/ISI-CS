 Perfect place for precious presents 

Feng Shui Matters 

Pinky Kapoor

 Gifts from near and dear ones should be stored in the south-east corner since this direction is associated with wealth. Presents from people who are financially comfortable and who have given the gifts happily without any pressure, bring luck and enhance personal wealth.

Q: My relatives and friends keep sending expensive gifts to me, which I usually store in my cabinet. Does Feng Shui recommend any particular area where gifts presented by friends and relatives should be stored?

 Aditi

 THE SOLUTION: Anything expensive that comes from a friend, relative or client should be stored in the south-east corner, which is directly associated with wealth. 

 Because they come from a person who is financially comfortable and has happily given you the gift without any kind of pressure, such presents will bring you luck and enhance the growth of your personal wealth with equal ease and intensity.

 If the gift comes in the form of currency notes, then do not spend this money. Keep these notes in a red packet in your personal wealth bowl or box.

 The Chinese believe that if a handful of soil from the south-east corner of a rich mans garden is mixed with the soil of ones own garden, then it helps his or her wealth to grow in leaps and bounds. But they also stress that this is only effective if the soil is taken with due permission from the owner of the garden.

 Office space 

 Q: I am an exporter of embroidered fabrics and have branch offices in different parts of the country. I have an efficient branch manager in Delhi who has been with me for many years. He has all the qualities a person can ask for in a responsible and capable manager. Of late, he wants to quit and join elsewhere. I have tried different techniques to hold him back, but he is adamant about leaving the job. Can Feng Shui help me in this matter?

 Bobby

 THE SOLUTION: South-west of the office is the area that is ruled by earth energy and has great gravitational pull. Place the photo of your manager along with yours in this corner of your chamber and keep a small round stone near the photographs.

 Pray to god that he continues to work with you and then visualise it really happening. The gravitational pull of this area along with your prayers and positive thoughts will definitely make him stay back. The stone kept nearby will also help anchor the person.

 Career worry 

 Q: I was born on October 24, 1984, at 7.25 am. I have a lot of trouble in remembering my lessons. Will I do well and get a first division in my university examination in April 2006? Also, I sincerely want to settle abroad. Will this wish come true?

 Joan Lopez

 THE SOLUTION: According to your pillars of destiny, you are a strong metal person with five elements of earth that represent high qualifications for you. Rabbit and dog combine in your chart to give you an extra element of fire and next year dog is coming to power with fire and earth elements.

 Fire works in two ways for you. Firstly, it gives you good results in examinations and secondly a change in residence, city or country. Be well prepared to leave for abroad next year. You should have no problem in remembering your lessons with water element being presently in power, as it represents your intellect. 

 Write an affirmation on the board above your study table in bold letters saying: I am successful and will obtain first division in my board exams.

 Such positive thoughts will not only make you concentrate better on your studies, but will also help you in achieving your desired goals.

 Beam bane

 Q: I am getting my old office, which has a number of beams and columns, renovated. I am aware that Feng Shui does not recommend having beams and exposed pillars. Please suggest some ways that can help deal with this problem. I would also like to know whether cabinets with exposed shelves are allowed in Feng Shui.

 Sampat

 THE SOLUTION: The perfect way to hide the overhead beams is by concealing them with a false ceiling. Alternatively, place tall cabinets under them and use dividers at these points to make open cubicles for the staff.

 No one should be made to sit under the exposed beam. Bare columns can be camouflaged in the interiors by building low-height side cabinets or runners in continuity. 

 Do not make cabinets with open shelves. They are like daggers and are considered to be poison arrows. Instead, invest in filing cabinets or bookshelves that have wooden or transparent doors. 

 This will allow the circulating Chi to flow smoothly and comfortably over the surface of the doors. If you decide on transparent doors, then break the continuous lines of books or files with ornamental pieces. This gives relief to the eyes.

 CMDA gets 10-man board

 - Hopes rekindled of stalled projects seeing completion

 DEBASISH CHATTOPADHYAY

 The Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) has finally got a new board, after a four-month gap, raising hopes of an early execution of a slew of stalled projects.

 The 10-member board, with urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya as chairman, was appointed on July 18. Ever since the earlier board was dissolved in February, the CMDA had been functioning with a caretaker board, resulting in several projects being held in abeyance.

 The projects now likely to see the light of day include the Baruipur township, on the southern fringes of the city, where the district headquarters of South 24-Parganas is scheduled to be shifted, a Water Park, a bus terminus near Ruby General Hospital, a link road between Prince Anwar Shah Road and VIP Road, a water treatment plant in Hooghly and sewerage treatment plants in Budge Budge and Hooghly.

 The first three projects will be executed through public-private partnership and the rest under the mega city scheme.

 For the first time, the managing director of the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation (WBIDC) has been inducted into the board. The inclusion of the WBIDC managing director became necessary, as work on the upcoming industrial township in Dankuni would require exclusive supervision (of his organisation), explained P.R. Baviskar, CMDA chief executive officer.

 The department , he added, has received Rs 31 crore from a Dubai-based company that will build a luxury hotel off the EM Bypass and Rs 20 crore from the developer of the Dankuni project. The project cost for the hotel has been pegged at Rs 213 crore, and that of the Dankuni project at Rs 2,700 crore.

 The government, however, has drawn some flak over the constitution of the new board, as six of the 10 members are from the ruling party and the rest are bureaucrats.

 The board is not properly represented, as most members are from a particular political party. Earlier, representatives of all parties were inducted into the board, pointed out Pranbandhu Nag, general secretary of the Development Employees Joint Action Committee.

 Denying the charge, Amiya Das, a member of the board and mayor of the Chandernagore Municipal Corporation, said: There had been no criticism when former Calcutta mayor Subrata Mukherjee, of the Trinamul Congress, had found a place in the earlier board.

 Surpassing stereotypes

 Revealing a daring artistic imagination, the paintings of Sisir Sahana are full of innuendos and ironies that portray his vision of a complacent, paralyzed, decadent society. These Toys Are Not For Us, the ongoing exhibition of his works on canvas and glass, showcases images that are playful, transgressive and irreverent in nature. Without carrying the philosophical burden of the likes of Baudelaire and Walter Benjamin, he nonetheless succeeds in simultaneously treading the path of social comment and aesthetic merit. A central motif binding his new canvases together is the unlikely, insipid presence of the ubiquitous Barbie doll; plastic, rootless and almost alien to its environment. Set against this is the figure of an innocent, young girl, symbolising traditional Indian womanhood. Embodying the conflict between our failure to internalise modernity and our eagerness to make a fetish of tradition, they articulate a need to transcend the rigidity of stereotypes and move to a realm of rationality and moderation.

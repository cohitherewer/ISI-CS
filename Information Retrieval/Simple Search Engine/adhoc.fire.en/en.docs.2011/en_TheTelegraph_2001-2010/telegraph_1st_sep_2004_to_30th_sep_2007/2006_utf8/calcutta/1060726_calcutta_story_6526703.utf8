Return of the MLA

Screen On amp; Off

 Mithun Chakraborty will be MLA Fatakeshto again 

 What happens to MLA Fatakeshto once he is in the hot seat at Writers?? Well, we will find out by next April when MLA Fatakeshto Part II hits the halls. Buoyed by the success of MLA Fatakeshto, starring Mithun Chakraborty in the title role of a goon-turned-politician, producer Shree Venkatesh Films has decided to come up with a Tollywood rarity ? a sequel.

 The yet-untitled film will start where the original ended ? with Mithun entering the government as home minister ? and then track the political career of Fatakeshto.

 ?We thought of a sequel as we felt the story of MLA Fatakeshto could be carried forward. The character can be extended. People will watch out for what Fatakeshto does after entering the government, what opposition he will face and how he will upset everybody?s plans,? says Shrikant Mohta of Venkatesh. ?We discussed the idea with Mithunda and he has agreed.?

 Shooting will probably start in December-January, aimed at a Poila Baisakh release next year.

 ?Planning is still in the first stages but I am very excited. This sequel is a risky venture and it would be the first of its kind in Tollywood. We will try and make it as successful as the original,? said Mithun, having scored vital popularity points for his MLA act.

 MLA? was released with a record 61 prints across Bengal on April 14, seven days before the state went to the polls. By the end of four weeks, the film had grossed Rs 2.5 crore, almost a crore more than 2005?s most successful film, Juddha.

 With a plot derived from the Anil Kapoor-Rani Mukherjee-starrer Nayak, the film had Koel Mullick playing a journalist, Debasree Roy as Mithun?s wife who gets murdered and Soumitra Chatterjee as the chief minister. The sequel is likely to retain the cast and Swapan Saha as director. Scriptwriter Salil, who penned the now-famous lines ?Marbo ekhane, lash porbe shashane?, will once again put some fiery dialogues in Mithunda?s mouth.

 Has the Bollywood sequel bug finally bitten Tollywood? ?Sequels will rule the roost in Bengal very soon too, as we are running out of stories to make into films,? feels Mohta. ?But films must have sequel value like MLA Fatakeshto, which is character-based and helps you develop the storyline.?

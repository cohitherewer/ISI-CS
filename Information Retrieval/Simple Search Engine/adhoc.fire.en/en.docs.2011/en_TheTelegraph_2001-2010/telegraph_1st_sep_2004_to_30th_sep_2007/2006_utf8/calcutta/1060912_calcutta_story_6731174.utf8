The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Hall of fame and flux

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 What is to be done with the Town Hall? Thirteen years after it was restored, no one really knows.

 This fact comes sharply into focus as the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), which is in charge of the edifice, draws up a Rs 2-crore scheme to turn the 192-year-old hall into a money-spinner.

 The main objective of the current 

 CMC scheme is to make the Town Hall financially self-sustainable 

 through space utilisation. 

 The schemes will be carried out in consultation with a seven-member Calcutta Museum Society. We want to bridge the existing gap between revenue and expenditure, said municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay.

 The route to bridge the gap could have milestones as diverse as an art gallery and eateries. The CMC will soon invite letters of interest for using the lower basement as gallery or restaurant.

 That Calcutta is clueless about how to utilise the Town Hall has been clear from the time of its restoration. First, the blueprint of a mall behind the hall was blacked out. Then Calcutta Panorama, which almost makes a laughing stock of our national heroes, opened on its ground floor.

 One of the first public functions held at the renovated Town Hall was a recital by Pandit Bhimsen Joshi. Since then, the first-floor hall has not been utilised the way a space of such dimensions should have been because of poor acoustics.

 Perhaps, for the address where Rabindranath Tagore was felicitated on his 50th and 70th birthdays in the thick of the Swadeshi movement, the CMC could look towards UK, USA and even Australia, where a Town Hall is used for public meetings, concerts and arts displays.

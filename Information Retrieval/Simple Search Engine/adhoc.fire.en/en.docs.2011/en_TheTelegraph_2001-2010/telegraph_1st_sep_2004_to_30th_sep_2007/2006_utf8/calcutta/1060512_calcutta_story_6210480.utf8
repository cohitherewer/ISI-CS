 The journey to the Vatika Honey amp; Saffron Soap Sananda Tilottama crown is a good mix of glamour and grind. But late on Tuesday, the grind assumed a whole new meaning for the 20 girls as they stepped into Red Kitchen amp; Lounge at The Enclave in Alipore to boogie the night away. 

 Finally, one night of unlimited fun after keeping pace with a frenetic eight-to-eight schedule since May 1 ? and the girls sure made the most of it. 

 For once the girls could bid temporary adieu to their strict diet chart. After all, practising their newly polished table skills at a sit-down three-course Chinese meal was just an excuse. So what did these beauties dig into? 

 Well, the dinner was quite on the lines of their recommended diet, but with a refreshing twist to change their palate for that night, revealed Ashim Mewar from Red Kitchen amp; Lounge, also the F amp;B partner for the annual beauty contest. 

 The well-deserved treat came in the form of Chicken Coriander Soup or Hot and Sour Soup, Shredded Chicken Hunan Style, Steamed Fish, American Corn in Hot Garlic Sauce, Exotic Stir Fried Vegetables, Mushroom Fried Rice and Hakka Noodles topped off with Darsan and ice-cream.

 Then it was time to burn the calories and the girls did just that. For two long hours non-stop on the dance floor, moving and shaking to recent Bollywood hits and good ol favourites alike.

 The flavour of the evening was a high dose of friendship songs as a few contestants went on a sentimental trip. Lots of song dedications and bonding took centre stage. 

 The evening also taught the girls to handle both the limelight and excited fans as scores of people turned up hoping to brush shoulders with the Tilottama beauties.

 Their grooming expert Nayanika Chatterjee, as expected, was a huge draw and once she was through with overseeing the grooming bit, she readily joined the girl gang on the floor.

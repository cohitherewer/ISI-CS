 What: 

 Official unveiling of the Calcom Cement Saturday Club Inter 

 Club Sports Carnival, in association with The Telegraph. 

 Where: Saturday Club.

 When: April 29, evening.

 Take a look: The Inter Club Sports Carnival that was conceptualised 31 years ago is still going strong with the number of club participants increasing every year. Apart from swimming, badminton, bridge, snooker, squash, table tennis and lawn tennis, there are a host of fun events like tug-of-war and sack race lined up this year.

 While Friday saw the flag hoisting, handing over of flags and some sports event, Saturday witnessed the formal inauguration of the 10-day summer sporting fiesta that ends on May 7. 

 The celebrations kicked off with welcome dance performances by Bengal Rowing Club, CC amp;FC, Tollygunge Club, Royal Calcutta Golf Club (RCGC), Calcutta Club, Calcutta Swimming Club, Dalhousie Institute, Calcutta Punjab Club, Ordnance Club and Saturday Club.

 In the judges seats were jewellery designer Nilanjana Chakraborty, actor Arindam Sil, painter and sculptor Gosto, singer Vasundhara Gupta and Ritesh Bawri, executive director, Calcom Cement India Ltd. The groups were judged on the basis of theme, performance, originality, costume/make-up and overall presentation.

 The club lawn was packed with friends and family cheering and clapping the young talent all through. From fluctuating human emotions to the vision of a united world, the dance groups drew on themes from different walks of life.

 A bit of hip-hop, salsa, merengue, waltz, jhatkas-matkas, ballet movements, trademark Michael Jackson moves, freestyle... Each performance was a combination of all these and more. Some also managed to fuse Bharatanatyam movements to perfection. Props like ribbons, wigs, walking sticks, butterfly wings, colourful dresses and smiling faces added to the eye-catching sequences.

 The music was a medley of English pop, Bollywood chartbusters and even some folk melody.

 RCGC, with a captivating fusion of western and Indian, waltzed away with the first prize. The second place went to the Saturday Club team enacting the journey of a dedicated young dancer. Calcutta Swimming Club came in third.

 These young talents can give tough competition to the Bollywood stage performances.The evening is rocking and so are all the performances, smiled Nilanjana.

 Calcutta is moving with the right spirit and these youngsters reflect that, said Arindam.

 After the song and dance, it was DJ Vicky who kept the party mood swinging.

 Sip n bite: 

 While the busy drinks counter served vodka, rum, Breezers 

 and soft drinks, the food corner offered diverse delicacies 

 like kebabs, dosa, Cheese Steak, Paneer Shaslik, 

 Mutton Steak and more.

 Voiceover: With the summer vacation on in schools and the scorching heat and humidity taking a toll, most Calcuttans would love to be away from the city on a vacation. Events like these help people enjoy themselves in the city itself, said Rajen Sood, sports convenor, The Saturday Club.

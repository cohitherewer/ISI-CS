 SATURDAY EVENING, PRESENTED WITH THE TELEGRAPH AS MEDIA 

 PARTNER, WAS ALL THIS AND MORE. GOODLIFE BRINGS YOU 

 GLIMPSES FROM THE YEARS BIGGEST RAMP SHOW IN TOWN

 Calcutta got a glimpse of Sabyasachi Mukherjees New 

 York (Olympus Fashion Week) line. In a striking palette 

 of black, grey, khaki and olive with touches of red and 

 gold, the out-and-out international line comprised frocks, 

 pinafores, trench coats, blousons and long gowns. The line 

 boasted signature Sabya elements prints, cuts and 

 details. 

 Rohit Bal drew the curtains on the evening and ensured that 

 the audience left the venue with a wow on 

 their lips. With a sequence that rocked from the beginning 

 with the trademark ivory-and-gold combo, Rohit unveiled 

 the only bridal line of the show. The highlights were the 

 swirling, voluminous lehngas teamed with corsets and cholis, 

 while the men stood out in exquisite sherwanis paired with 

 pyjamas. The off-whites and ivories gave way to darker maroons, 

 as the lehngas slimmed down in the later part of the collection. 

 Rohits signature gold leaf prints in floral and bird 

 motifs and heavy embroidery embellished the collection. 

 Its a bridal line with a difference, 

 is how Rohit defined it.

 Some Mumbaiya drama from Sabina Singh added the much-needed 

 zing. A phuchkawala, a chaiwala and a chanawala did the 

 rounds; models hair tied with colourful ribbons 

 paraded ethnic wear in a riot of Indian hues, script 

 prints, panel work, rose motifs and polkas; and the music 

 drew on Bollywood retro like Mera joota hai Japani. High-point: 

 A model in a floral-printed white sari made an entry in 

 a cycle rickshaw. The collection called Phir Bhi Dil Hai 

 Hindustani sure lived up to its name.

 Designer duo Shantanu amp; Nikhil Mehra showcased a mix 

 of mens and womens wear in a line titled Naughty 

 Harem. Sherwanis, short jackets, kurtas and drapes for men 

 boasted the maharaja look, while the women sported cocktail 

 saris with a vintage look. Lots of browns and gold, with 

 a touch of pastels, coloured the collection.

 Kiran Uttam Ghosh unveiled a refreshing line in silver grey 

 and white, with metallic shine being the defining look. 

 Dresses, boleros, jackets, shirts, leggings, churi pants 

 and more were embellished with metallic gold or silver work. 

 High necklines, geometric prints and pile-ons were some 

 of the highlights.

 Bollywoods ace designer Aki Narula presented an all-black 

 glamorous line of winter party wear. Lots of high-waisted 

 dresses, skirts, leggings and boleros made up the collection. 

 Tonal embellishments and texturisation defined the look, 

 with touches of cutwork, mirrorwork and beadwork enhancing 

 it.

 Aparna Chandra showcased an impressive pret line with a 

 girlie look. Red-and-white polkas, black-and-white checks, 

 subtle tonal embroidery and sheers were some of the high 

 points. The line was made up of separates just-below-the-knee 

 dresses, culottes, skirts, tops, jackets and tunics. Reds, 

 blacks and creams formed the palette. 

 Stark in its simplicity, Vivek Narangs collection 

 entirely in black drew inspiration from the Suzani textile 

 form of Central Asia. This was carried out in the single 

 motif cotton thread embroidery in either red-yellow-pink 

 or white-green-orange that embellished all the outfits, 

 in different placements. Raw silk formed the base fabric.

 Couture jeweller Raj Mahtani started the show with a line 

 of almost-regal ornaments. Rajs signature uncut stones 

 emeralds, rubies and more set in gold, made 

 up the bold avant-garde pieces. The stress was on the neck 

 and the waist as several strands of jewels circled these, 

 lending a larger-than-life feel.

 A toned-down palette of whites, beiges, blacks and greys 

 with dashes of pink coloured Gaurav Guptas collection 

 inspired by ancient European cultures. Floral 

 embroidery in metallic hues, flowy sensuous fabrics, asymmetrical 

 hemlines made this a super-feminine line. Dresses, with 

 some pleating and ruching, and saris, with innovation on 

 the pallas, dominated the collection. 

 The collection is very over-the-top by my standards, 

 said Anamika Khanna. And so it was. A dash of shine and shimmer 

 and bright hues presented a dramatic line. The collection 

 stood out for the sheer variety of silhouettes from 

 long floor-kissing coats to calf-length dresses, wrap-tops, 

 shirts, loose pants, churi pants, leggings and more. Anamikas 

 signature texturisation and pile-on technique were also visible. 

 Hints of gold embroidery upped the glam quotient.

 One of the most important and influential dramatists of the 20th century, Samuel Beckett (picture above) transformed the way we look at theatre, banishing the fusty conventions of writing them. Presented by Jadavpur University?s department of English, Birth-Breath/Dearth-Death is a tribute to his far-sighted vision and creative genius. Comprising nine of Beckett?s little-known minuscule dramas or ?dramaticules?, written at various points of his career, it is the first of its kind to be staged in the country, and is perhaps, the first-ever attempt to put this selection of nine miniatures (Breath, Act Without Words II, Come and Go, Rockaby, Catastrophe, Ohio Impromptu, What Where, Footfalls and A Piece of Monologue) in sequence. Stark and audio-visually bleak, their theatrical minimalism and economy of expression recall Japanese Noh drama and also pre-figure Western performance and installation art. Direction: Ananda Lal.

 Event: Nine short-plays of Samuel Beckett presented by Jadavpur University Department of English 

When: Today at Padatik Little Theatre (6.30 pm); tomorrow at Birla Academy (6 pm)

 International Evening, one of Calcutta Clubs premiere events, is all set to leave a mark on the citys social calendar once again. 

 Scheduled to be held on January 28 on the club lawns, the theme for this year is We Are The World.

 Exotic varieties of cuisine from the world over, a global music and dance performance dubbed The Melting Pot, renowned band Indian Ocean and a presentation on Anjan Dutts The Bong Connection ? this is just a teaser of what is expected to be a wholesome entertainment menu.

 This year, the partner country happens to be USA. When we were approached by Calcutta Club, which is a very prestigious and historic club, to be part of an event that is so big on the citys social calendar, we gladly accepted, smiled Henry V. Jardine, US consul general in Calcutta.

 S.B. Ganguly, CEO and executive chairman of Exide Industries, who is also chairman of the committee for International Evening 2006, promised a gala for members and their guests.

 This is Calcutta Clubs 99th year and we will kick-start the centenary celebrations soon after the conclusion of this evening, explained Ganguly.

 What began as a modest international food festival is now a complete entertainment package. The three-tier stage, conceptualised by veteran architect and club member Dulal Mukherjee, is going to be an added appeal.

 While the top level is reserved for musicians, performers will grace the second and revellers will occupy the lowest tier, explained Mukherjee.

 The food from all over the world will as usual be one of the biggest draws of the Saturday evening extravaganza.

 To complete this international experience, The Melting Pot, presented by the likes of Pandit Shubhankar Banerjee, Violin Brothers, Purbayan Chatterjee, Lew Hilt, Gopal Burman and Farah with her team from Mumbai will rock the audience. 

 Expected to showcase a true global flavour, The Melting Pot will begin with American music and end on an Indian note. The programme will be anchored by Jimmy Tangree.

 The importance of the evening lies in its ambience ? a happy amalgam of four ingredients ? the layout, the lighting and decor; the multi-national and tempting cuisine; the cultural programme; the consular and foreign participation, said club president Dilip Bose.

 With an estimated footfall of about 10,000, this event that began way back in 1979, truly promises to be an evening to remember.

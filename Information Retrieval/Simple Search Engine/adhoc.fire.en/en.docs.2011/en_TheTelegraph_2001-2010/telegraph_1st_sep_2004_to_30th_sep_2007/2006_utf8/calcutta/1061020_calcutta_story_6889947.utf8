 True festive spirit

 Safe, happy and meaningful is the mantra of CESC The Telegraph True Spirit Puja award, started in 2003 with prime focus on safety measures, civic concerns and social commitment defining the essence of the citys biggest festival.

 Moving away from the trend of judging a puja by grandeur and gimmicks, the True Spirit awards is meant to encourage organisers to follow the rules, keep things clean and engage in social projects.

 In its fourth year, CESC The Telegraph True Spirit Puja once again managed to identify and hail puja organisers who have tried their best to stick to the prescribed norms and also set an example for others.

 Friday evening is when the True Spirit Puja winners will be felicitated at Vidya Mandir. The victor list: Dum Dum Park Tarun Sangha (Model), Mudiali Club and Ramkrishna Athletic Club in Howrah (Five Stars), Manicktala Chaltabagan Lohapatty, Behala Nutan Dal and Putiary Sarbojanin in Kudghat (Four Stars).

 The excitement in the ranks of last years Three Stars winner Ramkrishna Athletic Club is palpable. We are the first puja in Howrah to receive Five Stars, points out Sujay Basu of the club, which had donated half of the 2005 prize money to the century-old Friends Union Library.

 This year, too, we plan to donate a portion of the prize money to the library. We will also help poor students pursue their education, adds Basu. 

 First-time participant Behala Nutan Dal recreated a fishing hamlet without compromising on precautionary measures. We are happy that our efforts to organise a safe puja has not gone unnoticed. Our puja wasnt just about the look, observes organiser Sandipan Banerjee. Nutan Dal intends to donate a portion of their winnings to the Godakhali Fishermens Co-operative in South 24-Parganas. 

 Dilip Samajpati, senior manager of customer relations, CESC, is happy with the awareness the award has generated: There has been a considerable decline in the number of FIRs lodged concerning power theft at this time of the year. Our officials have also noticed that most puja organisers are taking special care to prevent fire hazards.

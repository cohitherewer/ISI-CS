The death of a labourer on a windswept Sunday morning at the South City project on Prince Anwar Shah Road ? the second on-site accident in three months ? raised questions about safety measures at one of the largest real estate projects in town.

 Sujan Khatua, 31, died after he fell from the 32nd floor of Tower II around 8.30 am.

 ?I heard a scream, looked up and saw him come crashing down, striking the scaffolding several times, before hitting the ground,? said a labourer at the site.

 Police had to intervene when the labourers staged a protest demanding better safety measures at the site ? they alleged Sujan had no safety belt on while working at such a height ? and also adequate compensation for the family of their co-worker.

 ?They did not allow the body to be removed till late in the afternoon. They demanded that his kin be compensated properly and safety measures be improved at the site,? said an officer of Jadavpur police station, where a case of unnatural death was initiated.

 South City?s business development manager D.J. Chakraborty, however, said: ?I have not heard of any protest at the site. It was just an accident and as we all know, accidents cannot always be averted.?

 Responding to some workers? allegations of inadequate safety measures, Chakraborty added: ?We always provide all that is needed to ensure safety of the workers, including safety belts and helmets.?

 He gave the assurance of proper compensation for the family of the accident victim by the insurance company, following a formal investigation.

 In April, a water tank on the South City premises had caved in, claiming the lives of three labourers bathing at dawn before their day?s work. A case of negligence had been initiated against the company issued the contract for the civil construction.

 S.N. Gupta, superintendent of police (South 24-Parganas), confirmed that Sujan had tumbled off the platform on which he was standing and plastering the tower.

 ?Rough winds blowing at that time may have caused the accident,? said local RSP leader Sanat Lahiri, at the site of the accident on Sunday.

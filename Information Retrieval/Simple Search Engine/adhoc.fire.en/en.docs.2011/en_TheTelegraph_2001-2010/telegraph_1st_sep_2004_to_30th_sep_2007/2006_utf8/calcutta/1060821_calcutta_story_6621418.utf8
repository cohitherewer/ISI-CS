The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Crores to draw up abortive projects

 A STAFF REPORTER

The government is hard up for cash. But it has blown at least Rs 9 crore on preparing feasibility reports and inviting tenders for infrastructure development projects and cancelling them. And all this for project reports now gathering dust.

 From leasing out tram depots and introducing high-security number plates for vehicles to construction of the Vivekananda Road flyover and the Raichak-Kukrahati bridge, the government had invited tenders for at least 13 projects and thereafter cancelled them. Most of the projects were mooted by urban development and transport departments.

 The government had planned six mega projects, including East-West Metro, light rail transit (LRT), Green Corridor, Southern Expressway, Cossipore-Jadavpur elevated road and airport-Howrah expressway and subsequently prepared feasibility reports spending a small fortune on these. But none of the projects have been implemented.

 Whenever the tenders were cancelled, the officers cited poor response or unsatisfactory offers. This was used as an excuse for relegating the projects to the backburner.

 But some officers at Writers Buildings have raised questions over this misuse of public money.

 Tenders should be invited only after assessing every aspect of a project. Crores of public money have gone down the drain owing to the callousness of some officers and inadequate planning, said an officer in the urban development department.

 Citing examples, officers said the government spent Rs 6 crore to prepare a detailed project report on the East-West Metro project and nearly Rs 40 lakh on the LRT. The fate of both projects is uncertain.

 The government invited tenders and chose SREI, a private company, to build the Vivekananda Road flyover. But even after signing an agreement with the company, the government cancelled it. SREI has filed a case in the high court and demanded a compensation of Rs 10 crore.

 The latest case is the cancellation of a tender to prepare a feasibility report for the Raichak-Kukrahati bridge. The public works department had invited a tender to select a private party for the job but cancelled it as the government wanted to award the contract to the Salim Group.

 Transport minister Subhas Chakraborty said in many cases, tenders had to be cancelled because of unavoidable circumstances. If we do not get any response from any affluent and efficient company to implement a big project, we have to cancel the tender and invite it afresh to get more offers. Thereby, we end up spending money, he explained.

 Chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb argued that preparation of a feasibility report is an essential part of any project. We have to prepare a report for any development project before looking for funds either from the Centre or from private firms. In some cases, the funds do not materialise but we have to spend money on the preliminary work, Deb stated.

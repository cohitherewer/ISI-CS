 Solid waste disposal to yield cash

 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE

 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) is planning a recast of its solid waste management, keeping an eye on revenue generation prospects. 

 Canada-based consultant Gartner Lee and an Indian company, SMG Mercantile, are helping the authorities steer the project.

 We want to overhaul the entire system of handling solid waste collection, transportation and dumping by putting in place a modern and scientific system of disposal, municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay said on Friday. The action plan will be prepared after December, when the consultants are likely to submit their reports.

 The civic authorities objective, Bandyopadhyay added, is not just proper disposal of waste, but also earning some revenue from it. 

 We have asked the consultants to prepare the report considering this aspect. There is lot of scope for earning revenue by converting municipal waste into fertiliser, gas and power. Compact garbage can also be used in cement factories as fuel.

 The city generates 3,000-odd tonnes of solid waste a day.

 The project will be implemented through public-private partnership. Expressions of interest will be issued to select the partner, the commissioner said. A meeting has been called on October 27 with all stakeholders to discuss the scheme.

 The present dumping ground in Dhapa having reached saturation point, the government has identified an alternative site, spread over 114 hectares, close by. Civic officials said the new site will be developed at an estimated cost of Rs 36 crore, under the Asian Development Bank-funded Calcutta Environment Improvement project (CEIP).

 We have got the clearance from the East Calcutta Wetlands Management Authority to develop the site, which falls within the East Calcutta Waste Recycling Zone. We are hopeful of starting work by March 2007, said CEIP director Rajiva Sinha.

 According to the plan, the plot will be developed as a greenfield landfill site with all necessary amenities, like roads, mechanical dumping system, drinking water, lights, drainage and sewerage, a weigh bridge and a modern system of segregation of waste. There will also be a recycling zone. 

 The site will be surrounded by a green belt, where pisciculture will be allowed.

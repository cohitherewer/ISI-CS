 Rooms for scholars

 - Civic help for CUs foreign students

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) will build accommodation for Calcutta University (CU)s foreign students and researchers. 

 At a meeting, mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya, municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay and CU pro vice-chancellor (academic) Suranjan Das decided that the civic body will construct two buildings on Kyd Street and the Rashbehari connector to the EM Bypass.

 There are nearly 200 foreign students and researchers in the university from different countries under the Study India Programme of the UGC. 

 The universitys own guest house on Ballygunge Circular Road can accommodate only four students. The Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture, at Gol Park, helps CU in accommodating a few students. But there is always a shortage of rooms, with an increasing number of students. 

 To solve the problem, the university had approached the civic body to build accommodation at affordable rates.

 The promoters are ready to accommodate 10 students per building. We will give them the required additional floor space. The earning from letting-out the rooms will go to the builders, said a civic official.

 He added that the proposed accommodation would be equivalent to three to four-star hotel rooms and would be priced around Rs 900 a day. Students might get some concession. 

 There will be a tripartite agreement with the builders and the university, said Bandyopadhyay, adding that the builders will have no exclusive control either on the rent rates or letting out the rooms.

 Indian Institute of Management Calcutta (IIMC) entered into a strategic alliance with information technology (IT) company NIIT on Tuesday to further the reach of its management development programme and offer executive development courses through virtual classrooms.

 The memorandum of understanding will see the Joka-based institute design course content, delivery and certification of two distance-education programmes strategic management for senior executives and applied finance for executives in finance functions. Both programmes are to be launched by October.

 NIIT will be responsible for creating the studios from where the courses will be broadcast, providing the technology platforms and marketing the academic initiatives.

 Speaking on the occasion, Shekhar Chowdhury, director, IIMC, said: This is a technology-enabled executive programme, developed to advance the theory and practice of management. With the help of the technology platform provided by them (NIIT), the programmes can be delivered to every part of the country. The course content has been developed to reach out to executives and try and meet the burgeoning demand from the corporate sector, which wants to access the high quality management education offered by the institute.

 The virtual classrooms will be set up in six centres the four metros, Hyderabad and Bangalore. The headcount for the two programmes has been fixed at 150 for each centre, with a provision for a phased hike to 3,000.

 Since we are starting off this year, we have decided to keep the batches small. But the batch strength will rise exponentially over the next two to three years. The studios have been created to accommodate 3,000 students and will do so soon, said Rajendra S. Pawar, chairman, NIIT.

 The programmes are spread over 52 weeks, including a weeklong visit to the IIMC campus. The course fees have been pegged at Rs 2 lakh for the strategic management programme and Rs 1.8 lakh for the finance course.

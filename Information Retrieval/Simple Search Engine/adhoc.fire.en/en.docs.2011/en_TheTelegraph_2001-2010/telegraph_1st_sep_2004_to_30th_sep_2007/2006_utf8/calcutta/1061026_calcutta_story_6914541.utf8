 BEAUTY 

 BASICS

Pregnancy 

 some women wear it like a badge of honour, some like its 

 an affliction, and some graciously embrace it like the natural 

 happening it is!

 Demi Moore wore it with a brazen 

 bare-all defiance that seemed to say, Im not 

 hiding the contours of this glorious episode of my life 

 for the likes of propriety; if you dont like it, lump 

 it (all puns intended)!

 Whatever be the attitude to childbearing, 

 it is a time when an expectant mother can go through her 

 highest highs and her lowest lows. Nurturing herself while 

 preparing for the new arrival, therefore, is vital for the 

 wellbeing of both her and her unborn (and not to forget 

 the man!). 

 Pregnancy affects hair, nails 

 and skin, and for an unfortunate few, it does so in not-so-nice 

 ways. The pregnancy glow remains a myth for 

 many who have to battle common pregnancy and post-partum 

 complaints like cracked nails, dry skin, breakouts, hyper-pigmentation, 

 hair fall and hair eccentricities like dry hair turning 

 oily, and straight hair curling.

 The good news is that with proper 

 care, most of these problems disappear between two to three 

 months post-delivery. 

 Your skin condition is indicative 

 of your overall inner health, so here are a few tips to 

 help your skin look best, both during and after enceinte.

 Oily skin

 During the first trimester, many 

 women notice an increase in oil production and pimple clusters; 

 this is truer for those with normally acne-prone skin. Most 

 physicians contend that this is due to the shift in hormones.

 Dont 

 Treat pregnancy-linked 

 breakouts with over-the-counter acne medicines. Many of 

 these are harmful to foetal development.

 Use cleansers, make-up 

 and moisturisers that have chemical exfoliants as they may 

 include salicylic acid, glycolic acid and alpha and beta 

 hydroxyl acids.

 Do

 Use a gentle, non-drying 

 cleanser on your face twice daily.

 Apply an oil-free sun 

 block every day.

 Use a clarifying mask 

 once a week to cajole the oil out of your pores.

 Try a cleansing facial 

 at a salon every two weeks or so for a gentle, thorough 

 cleansing. Tell them you are pregnant, and that you are 

 avoiding vitamin A preparations and chemical exfoliants.

 Dry skin

 As body fluids get diverted towards 

 the babys needs, women prone to dry skin may find 

 the skin on the face and the body getting drier and feeling 

 prickly.

 Dont

 Use anti-itch preparations 

 that contain cortisone or hydrocortisone until clinical 

 trials show conclusively that these medications are safe 

 for you and your baby. 

 Indulge in very hot water 

 bathing sessions it is drying for your skin and dangerous 

 for your unborn. 

 Do

 Drink plenty of water 

 to keep your skin moist.

 Wash your face with a 

 gentle cleanser formulated for dry skin.

 Use a rich, emollient 

 moisturiser and sun block.

 Keep rooms humidified.

 Apply oil from head to 

 toe after every shower; top with moisturising cream or butter.

 Pigment problems

 Hyper-pigmentation is due to an 

 excess production of melanin. The skin disorder, which causes 

 dark spots to appear on the skin, affects close to 90 per 

 cent of all pregnant women. It mostly disappears in the 

 months following pregnancy.

 Melasma or chloasma, known as 

 the mask of pregnancy, sees increased pigmentation 

 almost exclusively on sun-exposed areas like the face. Dermatologists 

 discourage sun exposure and urge use of a proper sunscreen.

 Stretch marks

 Stretch marks are a common pregnancy-related 

 skin problem in which deep reddish-blue lines appear not 

 only on your stomach, but also on the upper arms, hips and 

 thighs. It is often determined by heredity but you can help 

 the lines from turning into a major network.

 Dont

 nMake rapid weight gains. This 

 forces the skin to stretch too quickly, breaking down the 

 underlying dermal structure. While it is a must that you 

 gain a healthy amount of weight during your pregnancy, a 

 steady and gradual gain is best, both for you and your baby. 

 Do

 Keep your body complexion 

 (especially your stomach) hydrated, soft and supple. Stretch 

 marks are less likely to happen on skin that is moisturised 

 and has more pliant qualities. 

 Tip: A product that gives 

 you moisturising properties you need and is equally safe 

 for your baby is pure cocoa butter. 

 And if all fails, look at the 

 lines with a sense of humour. As Joyce Armor said: Think 

 of stretch marks as pregnancy service stripes.

The godfather of Indian jazz, Louiz Banks is in Calcutta 

to perform at The Park this weekend. Banks is here with his band The Jazz Messengers 

comprising son Gino Banks on drums, Sheldon DSouza on the bass and Jesse 

Sheehan on tenor and soprano saxophone. The band will play at Roxy on Saturday 

for the jazz weekend.

Someplace Else is the Mecca for musicians. The 

ambience is good and the audience supercharged. I love to play here, said 

Banks, sipping on some Horlicks yes, you read it right at The Atrium. This 

was when the fate of his SPE show on Friday night was at the mercy of the weather 

gods.

Banks, of course, is no stranger to this city. Calcutta 

is like my second home. This is where I became Louis (thats how he spelt 

his name then) Banks, he said. 

Though Banks has played at Someplace Else many times 

before, it has usually been as a guest artist with Skinny Alley. This is 

the first time I am playing with my band here, he said, confident that the 

young musicians would strike the right chord with the Calcutta audience.

The father and son duo, along with DSouza has 

done several shows together. And playing with his son has always been a thrilling 

experience for Banks. For him, Gino and DSouza, monsters at 22, 

are the future of jazz and will lead the next generation of India to jazz 

heights.

The performance showcases Bankss originals along 

with jazz standards and covers the range from traditional jazz to modern and fusion 

jazz. The jazz and wine evening at Roxy will witness some sophisticated and elegant 

pieces.

The set is entirely instrumental in order to take 

advantage of the presence of Sheehan, who, Banks says, is a world-class 

saxophone player. 

Banks recently released a number of albums like Fusion 

Yatra, Music for Romance Volume II, and Karmasutra Code. The 

premier jazz pianist of India is now working on the music score for a Bollywood 

film, I Am In Love, directed by B.M. Mirza. The film, slated for release 

next year, will have a sound that will be an integration of western, jazz and 

funk with mainstream Bollywood.

Banks, who usually plays with Atma, Asia Electric 

and Silk, is looking forward to the five-city tour with Silk that starts next 

month. Also scheduled for December is a show with Remember Shakti (without John 

McLaughlin).

Eager to leave a jazz legacy behind, Banks is currently 

working on etudes for the piano that have melodic aspects, to appeal to the younger 

generation of musicians. With three-fourths of the composition complete, he is 

hoping to have it published by the end of the year.

Life

 Cheer em in game garb

 ANUMITA GHOSH

 The men are talking, eating and 

 sleeping football. If you belong to the fairer sex and are 

 not the frenzied soccer fanatic your father, brother or 

 husband is, even then you cannot remain untouched by the 

 FIFA fever.

 Terms like off-side, back heel, corner and penalty may not make much sense to you, but you can still stay glued to the small screen and simply feast your eyes on the hot hunks sweating it out.

 But then, watching World Cup matches means much more than just sitting in front of the television.

 While men have geared up with jerseys, bandanas and flags to cheer, you cannot afford to look out of place in that flowery tee or ethnic kurti.

 So, get ready for the action in true World Cup style. GoodLife raids the racks for you.

 Team tees

 Football players today are fashion icons and young girls love sporting whatever their soccer hero adorns. Many girls do have their favourite teams and are going for team jerseys, says Partha Chowdhury, retail in-charge of the Adidas and Nike outlets at City Centre and on Theatre Road.

 Football has an immense fan following in this part of the globe. And women here are surely not ignorant about the World Cup, feels Naveen Misra, unit head at the Shoppers Stop outlet in Forum.

 But he also feels that the fashion factor takes priority while sporting soccer tees. They would go for tees with eye-catching colours like the Brazil and Czech jerseys. This way they can wear the jerseys post-Cup, as well, explains Naveen.

 The soccer merchandise has picked up quite a female fan following in the 16-to-24 age group. A certain section of working women might be enthusiastic about the game, but they hardly get the time or the occasion to sport football attire, observes Naveen.

 eeveless, collared, unfinished edges ? theres quite a wide range of tees to choose from.

 Pristine whites to soft blues to electric yellows to sunny oranges, the palette picks on the jersey codes. From Rs 199 to Rs 2,000, the range suits every pocket.

 Adidas is home to jerseys of Argentina, Germany, Spain and France for women. Also available are unisex black bags with France and Argentina inscribed. Stripes in blue at one end add a funk element.

 At Nike, you can pick from Brazil, Portugal, Dutch and US jerseys. The tees at Shoppers Stop are more colour-oriented and dont spell out the names of the teams.

 Just sporty

 If you dont want to flaunt your loyalty and stick to some neutral sporty gear instead, Pantaloons can well be your shopping destination.

 The racks here are filled with sporty tees and mini-skirts with tights. They come in hues of red and black and can be sported post-World Cup as well.

 At Shoppers Stop, white hooded tees with the message Team Spirit splashed across can serve your purpose too. 

 Tiny take

 While little girls are happy with Barbie and Little Mermaid on their pretty dresses, tiny tykes want to ape their fathers and elder brothers when it comes to sporting sporty stuff. 

 So the dress code is strictly football for little boys and the malls and stores are flooded with World Cup-theme T-shirts for them.

 With cool messages, footballs and World Cup logo illustrations on them, the tees look sporty and smart. Prices start at Rs 100.

 At Westside, the tees come in striking colour combinations. While those with blue and red stripes say Soccer, the ones in sunny yellow and orange have logos that scream Soccer Fan.

 eeveless T-shirts in white and blue illustrate a player executing a back-volley and another shooting a red ball. 

 At Pantaloons, the tees have giant footballs on them, along with Football League Championships inscribed.

 T-shirts at the Shoppers 

 Stop outlets send out the message Let The Best Win.

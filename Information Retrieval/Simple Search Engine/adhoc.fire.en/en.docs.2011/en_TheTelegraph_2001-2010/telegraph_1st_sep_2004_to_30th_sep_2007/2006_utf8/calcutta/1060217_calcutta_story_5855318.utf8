 A late-night murder triggered a pitched battle between the police and residents of Ekbalpore on Thursday morning.

 A 500-metre stretch of Diamond Harbour Road ? from the Majherhat bridge to Calcutta Medical Research Institute ? turned into a battlefield when a 1,000-strong mob attacked police with bricks and stones, alleging that the contingent had reached the murder spot seven hours late. 

 The group also set a wrecker van on fire and damaged around 20 cars parked in front of the garage where 23-year-old Mohammad Iqbal was murdered on Wednesday night.

 Deputy commissioner of police (headquarters) Anuj Sharma denied that police had arrived late. ?We were informed around 7.45 am and police reached the spot at 8.30 am,? he said. ?We had to deploy rapid action force personnel and fire four rounds of tear gas shells to disperse the mob. A local youth was injured.?

 The clash led to a bumper-to-bumper traffic snarl on Diamond Harbour Road, that spread to the Taratala crossing. ?The main south-end entry to the city was blocked from around 8.30 am till noon,? said an officer of the traffic department.

 The violence erupted as soon as police officers entered the area to probe the murder of Iqbal, a resident of Hussain Mohammad Shah Road. ?A driver by profession, Iqbal was hacked to death around 1.30 am on Thursday in the Diamond Harbour Road garage. Another youth, Abdul Aziz, was critically injured. He probably tried to save Iqbal,? said Gyanwant Singh, deputy commissioner (I), detective department.

 According to police, both Iqbal and Aziz were sleeping in the garage. ?A group of 10 drivers and mechanics was in the rest room of the garage,? said an officer of Ekbalpore police station.

 Residents of the area came to know about the killing around 5 am and informed Iqbal?s father Mohammad Shoaib.

 ?I was alerted around 6.30 am and rushed to the spot. I saw my son lying on the floor, his face slashed. Aziz was beside him, gasping for breath,? recalled Shoaib. ?I told the other workers of the garage to call police. But they said their telephone was out of order. I had to walk around 500 metres in search of a telephone booth, from where I called Ekbalpore thana.?

 Officers suspect that the murder was the fallout of a rivalry among garage workers. ?Aziz is the only witness, but he is not in a position to talk,? deputy commissioner Singh said.

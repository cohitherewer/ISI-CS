 Modern artistic representation relies more on expressing our inner world rather than merely depicting actual reality. Colours on Canvas, the ongoing exhibition of paintings by a group of young city-based artists, provides an excellent attestation of this trend. Bringing together an assortment of 16 paintings by 11 artists, the show offers amazing variety in theme, style and mood, giving each work a unique character. Created on canvas with diverse colouring material like oil-pastels, watercolours and acrylic, the paintings bear the unmistakable stamp of each artist. Mainly presenting authentic images from life and nature, they subtly convey the human predicament. Without appearing overtly abstract, the paintings serve as metaphors for the dichotomy of existence and of our efforts to escape from worldly problems. Participating artists include Subhasis Saha, Kazi Nasir, Rintu Roy, Ankita Karmakar, Siddhartha Sengupta, Tanushree Ghosh and Falguni Biswas, whose painting appears above.

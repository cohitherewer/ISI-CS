 Town Hall library turns around

 - Repository of books, papers to be set up for researchers of Calcutta?s history

 The Town Hall. Efforts are afoot to refurbish its library and bring back documents and statues loaned to Victoria Memorial Hall. A Telegraph picture

 The Town Hall will be revamped soon. 

 To begin with, its existing library, that houses the invaluable collection of Calcutta historian P.T. Nair, will be upgraded. Efforts are on to bring back ancient documents and the beautiful marble statues of British dignitaries loaned to the Victoria Memorial Hall and instal these once again at their original sites in the Town Hall. 

 And if things go according to plan, Kolkata Panorama, the gallery of grotesques that reduces Rabindranath Tagore to a senescent figure of fun, too, will be eased out. And to think that a full figure of the young Rabindranath, sculpted by Sarbari Roy Choudhury, is lying in the obscurity of his studio in Santiniketan because the organisation that commissioned it just forgot about it.

 According to a recent directive from Alapan Bandyopadhyay, municipal commissioner, the Calcutta municipal gazettes and other notable publications of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) will be shifted to the Town Hall library that is under the CMC. 

 Thereby, not only CMC employees but researchers and students, too, will have easy access to these.

 At one time, the justice of peace used to be the highest office of the Calcutta corporation. All the resolutions and proceeds from those times ? 1840 onwards ? besides the municipal gazettes from 1924 will find a place under the Town Hall roof. All reports, both administrative and technical, and records of bridges, pumping stations and plots of land and water supply will be gradually moved here.

 Cataloguing and access will be computerised and photocopying and scanning facilities, too, will be available at the library. This will come as a boon for those delving into the city?s past. Now, it is next to impossible to access these at the CMC headquarters.

 The Town Hall will, thus, emerge as the chief archive of the CMC?s old and historic documents. Thereafter, the bulk of the minutes of the proceedings of Corporation meetings (now kept in the central record section of the CMC) will be moved there. 

 The controlling officers of different departments have been directed to find out whether they have old and important documents and artefacts in their departments. These, too, will be shifted here.

 The Town Hall already has on display the chair on which sat Chittaranjan Das at the CMC headquarters. The table used by Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, now lying at the civic guest house at Ballygunge Phari, will be brought here. The antique furniture already in the possession of the Town Hall will be restored.

 The CMC on May 16, 1975, had loaned several documents and 15 statues of British as well as Indian dignitaries to the Victoria Memorial Hall because of space shortage. 

 These were statues of Cornwallis, Hastings, Duke of Wellington and busts of Prasanna Coomar Tagore, Radhakanta Deb, Prinsep and Peary Chand Mitra and oil paintings of Keshub Sen, Duff and Dwarkanath Tagore. Among the historic documents are Clarke?s plans of the city?s 150-year-old drainage system.

 From the end of the 1990s, efforts have been on to bring these back from the Victoria Memorial and CMC has written to its curator about it. If these are brought back to the Town Hall, it will be a welcome change from the Durga pandal-style figures that crowd the ground floor and eat up so much space to little effect.

 The Town Hall library has 5,500 books and records running into a few thousand occupying two rooms next to the first-floor hall. Now, it will receive about 2,500 more. Functions are not held very frequently here, but whenever they are held, it becomes difficult to work in the library here. 

 After the Town Hall was restored, architect Dulal Mukherjee wanted to build a commercial complex behind it. That plan was spiked but the rear basement remains. This space is ideal as a repository of books on the city.

 Move over paper cards, e-card is an easy option to get your love message across 

 Love is in the air, with Valentines Day just round the corner. Two weeks is not too early to start planning what to gift your beloved. On this front, the one thing that figures on top of most youngsters lists is a card ? and more of the e-kind these days.

 The paper variety from Hallmark or Archies is still very much in style, but the e-card has emerged as an easy tech tool to declare undying love ? at least till next V-Day!

 For 123India.com, the e-greetings portal is most popular on and around February 14. This year, the company is gearing up for the event by producing a wide range of Valentines specials that will encapsulate as many different variations as the designers can think of, just to say I love you.

 Manish Saraf, a senior manager at 123India.com, says: Last year, Valentines Day was one of our busiest times. We expect this year to be even busier. According to Saraf, there are approximately 25,000 different cards on the site at any given time, with virtually every form of celebration ? and mourning ? covered in the e-card format. From Pongal and Makar Sankranti to the more popular festivals like Christmas and Diwali, theres something for every occasion, including year-round events like birthdays, weddings and anniversaries.

 At the moment, there are e-cards for Chinese New Year (which was on January 29) and even Saraswati Puja. There are separate sections for movie and music cards, online flower greetings, virtual pets and much more.

 Valentines Day is one of the major events on the e-card calendar, but almost every occasion imaginable is now being highlighted by the 70-strong team of young designers, visualisers and copywriters. This team is in tune with the styles and aesthetics that attract the GeNext. A brief browse through the e-card collection reveals that it is clearly aimed at the youth. 

 Saraf estimates that most of the users of e-cards range from 14 to 25 years of age. A major attraction for youngsters who send e-cards is that they are free, with advertising covering the revenue costs. 

 A few clicks of the mouse is all it takes to choose the right message, and it is instantly delivered. The manager points out that the pace of modern life is so hectic that many people dont have the time to send actual cards. The e-card provides a simple and quick solution.

 The e-card is also a favourite among another segment ? Indians living abroad. It has proven to be an efficient way for people to stay in touch with loved ones beyond boundaries at almost no cost.

 The popularity of the medium shows no signs of flagging ? 123India.com has recorded a 170 per cent increase in e-cards sent from its site, with this form of communication covering birthdays and religious festivals. 

 The e-card has come of age, proving that its not just a passing fad, but an established ? and essential ? part of life.

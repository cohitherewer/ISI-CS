 Ramakrishna and Ronaldo ? the sentinels of the city?s walls are as diverse as they get. Evoking piety or passion, they ensure that the walls of the houses and clubs they adorn are left untouched by party cadre on the prowl with paint and brush.

With Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee determined to repeal 

the West Bengal Prevention of Property Defacement Act, 1976, and unleash writing 

on the wall, will these pockets of innovative resistance be spared or will they, 

too, be tarred by the graffiti gang?

Place: 142, Harish Mukherjee Road

What we saw: Ronaldo and Ronaldinho roar on 

one flank (unlike the Saturday night whimper), while Zidane, Figo and Ballack 

roar right back from another. Move over political graffiti, roars Goleo, lion 

mascot of World Cup 2006, on Bhowanipore?s wall of fame.

Residentspeak: ?We wanted to protect this one 

wall from the shadow of politics. We started this wall-art culture in 1986, showcasing 

Bhowanipore?s identity as a sports-loving locality. Now, it feels good to see 

the practice spreading across the city? ? a member of Bhowanipur Shilpi Sangha.

Place: 66, Prince Bakhtiar Shah Road, Tollygunge

What we saw: A lion, a bear and a little girl 

have set sail in a riot of colours, amidst a plea to not deface the walls.

Residentspeak: ?My little granddaughter used 

to get furious on waking up to a wall smeared with graffiti. We spent Rs 3,000 

and got these pictures painted four years ago. People think this is a nursery 

school; no one has bothered us since? ? A 77-year-old resident.

Place:115, Jodhpur Park

What we saw: The wall is full of inspirational 

words, including quotable quotes from spiritual leaders like Sri Ramakrishna.

Residentspeak: ?In 1995, when the CPM boys 

wrote on the wall despite our requests, we got it whitewashed and wrote inspirational 

lines on it. The words of Sri Ramakrishna touch so many people. Many think it?s 

an ashram; our wall is safe? ? A 85-year-old house-owner.

Place: Pratapaditya Road (Chetla Road crossing)

What we saw: Spiderman and Garfield on one 

side, Henry (Gablu) on the other.

Residentspeak: ?We used to be threatened by 

CPM cadre over graffiti. It was no use complaining to Tollygunge thana. 

Some local boys then came up with the idea of painting cartoons on the wall. We 

have lived in peace ever since. This is the way out for all house-owners? ? A 

65-year-old resident.

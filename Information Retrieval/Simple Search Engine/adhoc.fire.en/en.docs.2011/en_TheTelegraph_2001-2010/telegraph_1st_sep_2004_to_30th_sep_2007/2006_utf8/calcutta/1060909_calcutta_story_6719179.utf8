 Oil strike cuts off supply

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Not a drop of oil flowed into 150 pumps in and around the city on Friday, as tankers went on an indefinite strike since dawn to press for a hike in transportation fare. Pump operators said they would run out of stock if fresh supply did not arrive by Sunday.

 The seven outlets in the city owned by oil companies, however, were not affected.

 Motorists did not face a crisis on Friday, as oil was supplied from the existing stock.

 The West Bengal Tankers Association has called the strike, demanding that the current fare for transporting a kilolitre of fuel within the city (maximum distance 80 km) be raised from Rs 108 to Rs 200. Association general secretary Ajit Das said the strike would continue till the demand was met.

 Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), coordinator for all oil companies, has convened meetings with tanker operators on September 15, 18 and 23. It is unfair of them to have called a strike now, said IOC general manager Gautam Dutta.

 Transport minister Subhas Chakraborty said the association had not issued a notice before going on strike. 

 The impasse has to be resolved by the oil companies. It does not fall under my jurisdiction, though I think the hike demand is justified, as prices of everything, including fuel and tyres, have gone up, he added. If requested, Chakraborty said he would talk to the oil firms on behalf of the tanker operators.

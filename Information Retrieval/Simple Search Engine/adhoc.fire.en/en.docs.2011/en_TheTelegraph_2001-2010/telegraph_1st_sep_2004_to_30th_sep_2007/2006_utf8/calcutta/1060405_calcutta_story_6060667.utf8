On amp; Off

Speed, scandal come crashing

Screen On amp; Off

 Graceful: Sandra Bullock

 All those of you who caught Sandra Bullock in Crash on the big screen this week, must be cribbing that you didn?t get enough of her. In the huge ensemble cast that Paul Haggis got for himself, including Don Cheadle, Matt Dillon, Terence Howard and Thandie Newton, Sandra?s screen time couldn?t add up to much. She does have a delightful scene towards the end of the movie, though, where she realises that her best friend is, in fact, her dark-skinned housekeeper.

 There is good news for Sandra Bullock fans, though, with her being signed on to play tragic author Grace Metalious in a new biopic, tentatively titled Grace. Sandra will also co-produce the movie, which will be penned by Jake Gyllenhaal?s (Brokeback Mountain?s Jack Twist) screenwriter mother Naomi Foner.

 Metalious is the infamous writer of the scandalous novel Peyton Place which became one of the best-selling novels in history but was banned in several cities for its objectionable content. Metalious herself never recovered from the critical backlash, as her marriage collapsed and she received death threats from outraged readers. She went on to become a heavy drinker and died of cirrhosis in 1964, at the age of 39.

 You may also get lucky enough to catch Sandra getting back with Keanu Reeves for a third instalment of Speed. Reeves had refused to be a part of the flop sequel to the original blockbuster, but having teamed up again for The Lake House and having attended the Oscars together, the couple may be pushing the adrenaline again in Speed 3.

 Public demand: MTV Super Select VJ 

 Nikhil with guest Katrina Kaif

 One of the country?s most favourite VJs has officially made the move from his bachelor pad to the most ridiculous looking bathroom! What?s more, he?s allowing you full access to flush out your daily worries, wash out the blues and strip away your sorrows. And when not in his loo, you can catch Nikhil Chinappa yapping with the youth about mundane matters like how long nails should grow!

 ?MTV Super Select is your same favourite show MTV Select, but all on a larger scale,? says VJ Nikhil. ?Now we get to go out, meet with you wonderful people who have made the show such a success for nine straight years... We also get to discuss topics you wanna talk about.?

 That?s not all. Nikhil also reviews everything from movies to gadgets and gives the MTV Chhapp to the reviewed products. Of course, he also plays your favourite music. You can rock with the bathroom king on Super Select, Mondays to Fridays, at 6.30 pm on MTV. Katrina Kaif makes a guest appearance on the show next Monday.

 Hit man: Sajid Nadiadwala

 If you thought Rang De Basanti was big, you need to get your arithmetic right. If the UTV blockbuster was sold for Rs 4.75 crore in the Mumbai category, Sajid Nadiadwala?s forthcoming film Jaaneman has got an unprecedented offer of Rs 7 crore from Nimbus Communications for theatrical distribution in Mumbai.

 Jaaneman is directed by debutant Shirish Kunder (better known as Mr Farah Khan and the editor of Main Hoon Na) and stars Salman Khan, Akshay Kumar and Preity Zinta. According to Nadiadwala, he hasn?t yet sealed the deal even though he has been getting offers in the region of Rs 7.5 to 8 crore. Apart from Nimbus, the other distribution houses in the fray include Astavinayak and Raksha Enterprise.

 Shirish is not the only new director Nadiadwala is promoting. He has also signed funnyman Sajid Khan to direct his next production, tentatively titled Hey Baby. Like all Nadiadwala ventures, Hey Baby will star the biggest of Bollywood names in Fardeen Khan and Akshay Kumar. Sajid has, of course, directed one of the six episodes in Ram Gopal Varma?s Darna Zaroori Hai.

 This year has also seen Nadiadwala?s production company completing 50 years in the entertainment industry. The banner has given loads of superhits in Jeet, Judwaa and Mujhse Shaadi Karoge. No wonder Nadiadwala is called Mr Blockbuster in Bollywood. ?Right now, I may be celebrating 50 years of my company, but I am also looking ahead in taking the company to the next level,? he smiles.

 Lagaan at home

 On the ball: Aamir 

 Aamir Khan Productions will be 

 releasing Lagaan on DVD for the first time in the 

 country, five years after its release. The movie, which 

 was nominated for the Oscars, has foxed the piracy market 

 over the years. The satellite broadcast deal has expired 

 after the film was aired several times, but very few pirated 

 copies are doing the rounds. 

 Winner of several national and international awards, Lagaan will be available at a store near you in December 2006. Says M.N. Kapasi, managing director of Excel Home Videos: Lagaan has been one of the most famous ambassadors of Indian cinema in recent years. The long wait, clubbed with the high quality standards that Aamir Khan sought, has created huge curiosity in trade circles.

 The Ashutosh Gowariker film is 

 also the first Bollywood production in 30 years to use synchronised 

 sound, making the DVD a must buy. Says Aamir Khan: Excels 

 product expertise, innovative marketing, strong and penetrative 

 distribution chain made it a clear choice for Lagaans 

 home video debut. 

 Twin treat

 Zee Cafe is premiering two new 

 programmes this month. Launching on Sunday, at 9 pm, is 

 Without a Trace, a rivetting procedural drama about 

 the New York Missing Persons Squad of the FBI. The sole 

 responsibility of the special task force is to find missing 

 persons, by applying advanced psychological profiling techniques. 

 They peel back the layers of the victims lives and trace 

 their whereabouts in an effort to discover whether they 

 have committed suicide, been abducted, murdered, or have 

 simply run away.

 Also, starting next Tuesday and then airing every week from Tuesdays to Saturdays, at 2 pm, is the miniseries Thorn Birds. It covers 60 years in the lives of the Cleary family, which has been brought from New Zealand to Australia to run their aunt Mary Carsons ranch. The story revolves around their daughter, Meggie, and her love for the familys priest. This romantic drama has won four Golden Globes and six Emmy Awards.

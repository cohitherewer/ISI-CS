 South Point School has set on a mission of training all its students in self-defence.

 The rise in child abuse and kidnapping cases has prompted the authorities to make karate and yoga compulsory for every student. 

 ?Analysing the recent reports, we have realised that every child must be trained to tackle any kind of danger,? said Madhu Kohli, principal, South Point School (junior section).

 ?This realisation has led us to decide on introducing karate and yoga as compulsory items in the curriculum,? she added.

 The courses will begin from the new academic session, scheduled to start from the end of April.

 Kohli said that apart from developing the ability to protect themselves, the training in karate and yoga will help students imbibe qualities like self-confidence and discipline, which are a must for their all-round development.

 In most schools, courses in karate and yoga are offered as optional items and students opting for them are charged extra fees. In South Point, too, 45 students had enrolled in karate and yoga.

 But with the training becoming compulsory, the authorities have abolished the special fees.

 An official of the school said karate would be taught to the children from classes II to V and yoga to those studying between classes VI and VIII. 

 ?In course of time, both trainings will be offered to students of upper classes as well,? the official added.

 According to Jayati Solomon, principal, South Point High School, practice of yoga will help students tackle better the rising study stress.

 ?Yoga is a better form of exercise than the normal physical training (PT). We have decided to replace PT classes with yoga sessions. Besides, yoga helps students develop concentration power,? Solomon pointed out.

 Shivaji Ganguly, leader of the team that will conduct the karate courses, said: ?Around 4,000 children between classes II and V will attend the sessions twice a week. South Point is, perhaps, the only school in the entire country to introduce karate in the curriculum.?

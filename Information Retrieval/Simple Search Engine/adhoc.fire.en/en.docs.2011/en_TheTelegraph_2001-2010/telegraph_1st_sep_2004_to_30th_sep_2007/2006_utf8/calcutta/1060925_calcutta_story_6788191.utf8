 Pumping station upgrade

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 A sharp shower on Sunday morning was enough for several city roads to slip under water yet again. About 19 mm of rain in 55 minutes was four times the drainage capacity of the roads.

 After a visit to the Thanthania and Mominpur pumping stations, municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay held an emergency meeting with the civic engineers at the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) headquarters in the evening. He set up a four-member technical committee to augment the capacity of the pumping stations at Thanthania, Ultadanga and Mominpur. The panel will submit its report within 10 days.

 You have given enough explanations over the years justifying waterlogging. People are bored with your explanations. They want relief. Instead of explaining their plight, give them some relief with your expertise, Bandyopadhyay told the engineers.

 The municipal commissioner also ordered the procurement of two 265-HP heavy-duty Blow-Vac machines at a total cost of over Rs 2 crore. The device sucks out solidified silt from underground brick sewers. The CMC currently has one Blow-Vac machine.

 Gokhale Road, Elgin Road, Amherst Street, parts of CR Avenue, Ballygunge Phari, Bidhan Sarani, Vivekananda Road, AJC Bose Road, Surya Sen Street and Ultadanga Road are some of the roads that went under water on Sunday.

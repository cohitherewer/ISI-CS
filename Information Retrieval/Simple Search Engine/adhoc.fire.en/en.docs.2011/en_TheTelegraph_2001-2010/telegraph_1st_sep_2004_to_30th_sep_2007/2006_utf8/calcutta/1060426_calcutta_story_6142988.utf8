 The Bengali adaptation of Agatha Christie?s Witness for the Prosecution, Ekusher Aayna?s production Just Is? explores the theme of love, betrayal and, of course, murder. It narrates the events that follow the death of Sanchita, a middle-aged, wealthy widow, who has, in all likelihood, been killed by a young man, Victor. Sanchita had fallen in love with Victor, who had been appointed to look after her property. Sanatan, an old servant who managed Sanchita?s accounts, had strongly disapproved of their relationship. When Sanchita is murdered the day after she had made a will announcing Victor to be her only heir, he is naturally arrested. Though all evidences point toward his guilt, and even his wife Aishika testifies against him, Souvik Mukherjee, a noted criminal lawyer, takes up his defence. The climax of the play is built around how justice is delivered and the mystery finally unravelled. Direction: Biswajit Deb Roy.

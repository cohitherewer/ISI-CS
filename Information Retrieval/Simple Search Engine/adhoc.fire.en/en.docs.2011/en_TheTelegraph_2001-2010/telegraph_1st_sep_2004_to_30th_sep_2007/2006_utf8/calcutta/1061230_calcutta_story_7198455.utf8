His first game of squash, a friendly game with dad way back in 1994, had seen him being hammered big time. His most recent game of squash, in December 2006, saw Saurav Ghosal win the Asian Games bronze medal in Doha and with that a chance to be always remembered as the first Indian squash player to win a medal at the Asian Games.

 Today, Saurav holds a world PSA (Professional Squash Association) ranking of 49. And in true Bollywood style, he too doesnt believe in the numbers game I feel Im good enough for top-30.

 The 20-year-old from Mandeville Gardens is currently studying economics and management in the University of Leeds. He went to England to train morning and evening with coach Malcolm Willshrop, one of the best in the world. He was back home for the Christmas week.

 GoodLife caught up with Saurav at Calcutta Rackets Club to talk about the game, glory and, yes, girls.

 My first game got me completely hooked. I remember coming here straight from school (Lakshmipat Singhania Academy), downing my lunch in the car, and playing straight from 4.30 to 7.30 till dad brought me home, recounts Saurav.

 It has been quite a journey for this Puma-clad young boy. From reaching three National finals before 15 without any training to being the only person in India to have won three under-19 tournaments, Saurav attributes his success story to his love for the game. It is most important that you enjoy your game no matter what level you reach.

 Saurav moved to Chennai with his grandparents a few years ago to train at the ICL Academy under Cyrus Poncha and Major Maniam. When I got to Chennai, I actually woke up. I thought my shots were quite decent, but I was really unfit, admits Saurav. 

 After a new beginning, life has never been the same. Intensive training and lots of studying because he was a good student and its a habit to do well. The results showed because he finished school from Lady Andal in Chennai, with a whopping 97 per cent.

 For New Years Eve, the boy is headed back to Chennai, also the city where he found love a sporty and smart girl.

 In reel life, the Manchester United fan likes Priyanka Chopra. She looks gorgeous in Mujhse Shaadi Karogi and looks better in every film, smiles Saurav.

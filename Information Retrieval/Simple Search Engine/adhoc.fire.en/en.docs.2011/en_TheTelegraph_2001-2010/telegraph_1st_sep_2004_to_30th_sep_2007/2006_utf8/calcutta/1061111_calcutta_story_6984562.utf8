 Propertydeals to fund projects

 DEBASISH CHATTOPADHYAY

 The Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) is planning to lay out infrastructure for a number of projects with the money it will make by selling off prime plots at Dankuni and along the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass. 

 A 4,500-acre plot at Dankuni was requisitioned by DLF, a Delhi-based real estate firm, for building a township at Rs 2,713 crore. The deal was finalised in August.

 A 6.24-acre plot on the Bypass was allotted to Emaar MGF Land Pvt Ltd at Rs 217 crore for building a five or seven-star hotel and an integrated township. The deal was finalised in April. 

 Details of the projects were discussed at a recent meeting between senior officers of the CMDA and representatives of the real estate companies.

 It was decided that Emaar MGF Land Pvt Ltd would pay the entire amount by December. Construction will start in 2007 and end within one-and-a-half years. 

 We intend to start work at the earliest. It will not be very difficult, as we have adequate men and machinery, said P.R. Baviskar, CMDA chief executive officer.

 For building a satellite township, healthcare centre, educational institutions, cultural hub, mall, childrens park and other facilities, the CMDA has handed over 1,000 acres, from a 4,500-acre plot, to DLF. The department has promised to hand over the rest by 2007. DLF has pledged to build the township by 2011. It will be the third township after Salt Lake and Rajarhat.

 Welcoming the move, general secretary of Development Employees Joint Action Committee P.B. Nag said: Our department is suffering from a major financial crunch. The funds from the plots will come as a breather for us. We are planning to invest in other projects, too.

 Among them is the flyover at Parama Island that the CMDA intends to build to ease traffic snarls on the Bypass. The highroad will extend up to bridge no. 4 at Park Circus. Also, a flyover is on the anvil at Ultadanga, connecting Duttabad with the Vivekananda Road flyover. 

 Another plan is to revamp the drainage and sewerage system at Panihati and Khardah, on the northern fringes, and in North and South Dum Dum municipal areas. 

 The department also plans to take up revamp of water supply at Garulia, in Barrackpore, Kalyani and Baruipur, where the district headquarters of South 24-Parganas will be shifted. 

 We will start work with the funds we have and try to arrange the rest from the National Urban Renewal Mission or from some financial institution, Nag added.

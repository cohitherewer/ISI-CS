The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Aamir, Ash or animation

 The communication chain in the recent Coke ads has been tenuous 

 It 

 is thirst time folks. The mercury has now crossed the threshold 

 of summer. Throats are getting parched. Soft drinks sales 

 are on the upswing. No wonder almost all major brands of 

 soft drinks have commenced their campaigns on TV. That of 

 course is par for the course. Every warm season, the challenge 

 begins in right earnest.

 This season, however, it is not business as usual. Coca Cola, the quieter cola, has altered its game plan. For a start, it has been more visible on TV in the off-season. That campaign urged people to drink Coke with head held high. It is a very inspiring campaign and leaves a positive feeling. Repeat viewing remains pleasurable. That is saying a lot in an era when most ads are run more times than a viewer wants to watch.

 Yet, at another level, the Sar 

 Utha Ke Piyo campaign is baffling. Why did Coke pick such 

 a platform for its communication? It is common knowledge 

 that the Cola giants were hit in recent times with the pesticide 

 allegation. This campaign may well be a combat weapon. In 

 one version, the ad in fact makes the point that the Coke 

 we drink is the same as what is available in the West.

 It is curious that the aftertaste such a campaign leaves has less to do with quality assurance. The stronger essence is that of pride and intimacy. Indeed, the fervour that the ad manages to generate is possibly more patriotic than brand related. Aamir Khan further reinforces this.

 The confusion around this campaign got further accentuated as soon as the next campaign from Coke hit the screen in the cricket season. It is an animation film that is humorous and says Cricket Jiyo Coke Piyo. The last sequence, but for the animation format, may have attracted the wrath of the censors; something one does not associate with Coke at all. Even more surprising was that this ad came as a sequel to the Sar Utha Ke campaign. One missed the connection completely.

 The feeling of bewilderment was complete when a few days back the latest Coke ad featuring Aishwarya Rai was released. With this, Coke is back in the realm of usual fun advertising. It is in the gharana of the earlier Aamir series of ads. Not the irreverent Pepsi fun but an earthier dramatics evoking a sedate chuckle. That Ash to some will appear to be too elegant for the street-smart college girl is actually beside the point. The more important question is, if this is where Coke belongs why did it start with the Sar Utha Ke Piyo campaign?

 The campaign broke many months 

 after the pesticide controversy. Obviously people who matter 

 thought that letting a sleeping dog lie is not such a good 

 idea. Why then the subsequent switch to a completely unrelated 

 communication? Was the quality issue by then a forgotten 

 one?

 There is an even more enigmatic issue that has been underscored after the latest Ash campaign for Coke. There has always been this issue of Coke taking a post-teen position in its communication whereas Pepsi has merrily hogged the teenage mind space. Even on the scale of Western to Indian, Coke has chosen to be a bit traditional whereas Pepsi has preferred the more bindaas fusion generation. Is such segmentation sensible? Are the two segments mutually exclusive? Are they large enough by themselves to demand placement of a brand just for them?

 From Sar Utha Ke to Cricket Jiyo, and then on to a whistling Ash, the communication chain is tenuous. The positioning of the brand is getting blurred. We are thoroughly confused. 

 One hopes that there is less fog in Atlanta.

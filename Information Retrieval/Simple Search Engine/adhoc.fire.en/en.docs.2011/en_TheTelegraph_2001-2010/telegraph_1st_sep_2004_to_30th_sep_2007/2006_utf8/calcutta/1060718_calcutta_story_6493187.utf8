The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

On amp; Off

 Doing work, good amp; diverse 

Screen On amp; Off

That is IRRFANs movie mantra, awaiting two releases 

as different as they get. The actor chats with Pratim D. Gupta about Naseeruddins 

vision and Tom Cruises shoes

 Irrfan in Killer and (below) with Saroj 

Khan in Yun Hota Toh Kya Hota

Two releases on the same Friday. That?s a first 

for you?

Very much. Pehle mujhe bhi ajeeb lag raha tha. 

Then I saw the positive side of it. Yun Hota Toh Kya Hota and The Killer 

are two completely different films. Yun Hota? is a very fresh film 

by Naseersaab. Bahut alag si hai, aisi film parde pe dekhi nahin 

gayee hai. Killer, on the other hand, is a mass-oriented film. One 

is for the multiplexes, the other for the standalone theatres.

Let?s start with Yun Hota?. Naseeruddin 

Shah told us that he wrote the script with you in mind. That?s a big compliment?

See, casting is done keeping in mind the similarities 

in look of a person with a particular character. But Naseersaab?s in-depth 

understanding of the character is something that you can?t see on the surface 

level. Uski alag hi ek duniya hai. I may look the part but the character 

is completely different from me and I had to keep exploring it to get nearer to 

Naseersaab?s vision.

What is your character in the film?

My character is a little odd. I am a stockbroker coming 

from a Muslim family, which itself is not very common. Then my mother (Saroj Khan) 

is like a godmother. She is not connected to the underworld but woh logon ke 

faisle karwati hai. I am this grown-up man who is still looking for a mother 

figure in his lover. So I get attracted to this older lady (Suhasini Mulay) and 

fall madly in love with her. His love is too pure, very naive. He has complete 

dedication towards the relationship and believes in it strongly. But she is a 

modern woman and has different priorities. That?s something that doesn?t register 

with him. He is also addicted to coke (cocaine). So, this woman turns out to be 

his pleasure and ultimately his tragedy.

How was the Naseeruddin Shah experience?

We worked together briefly in Maqbool. I have 

always wanted to work with him. After working with him in Yun Hota? I would 

rate him very highly as a director. He is telling a story with a vision, with 

an understanding of life itself. He is making a film because he feels strongly 

about the theme. There?s great insight into the project. It was a very difficult 

script for a first-time director. Four different stories and there was nothing 

conventional about it. And frankly I was concerned ki picture kaisi 

banegi. But it?s turned out fantastic, something that will move you.

Are you happy with your contribution to the film?

I didn?t like myself in the film. Lots of my scenes 

were chopped off and my particular story doesn?t flow properly. So it was a kind 

of setback for me but I am sure it was done keeping in mind the larger scheme 

of things. I am really, really happy for Naseersaab. He has made a great 

film and he should make more films.

Did he act out the scenes for you?

He never told us how to do it but he kept telling 

us to probe more into our characters. He would tell me: ?You could have been thinking 

like this.? He has so many options. Being an actor himself, he loves actors and 

his perspective is no different. He knows where actors are being lazy. With Sarojji 

it was a teacher-student relationship. For her it was a guru-shishya parampara 

? sets pe dekhnewali cheez thi. Just like a sincere bachcha, 

she would do her homework on her character. And the results show. She is fantastic. 

So are Konkona (Sen Sharma), Paresh (Rawal), Ratna (Pathak Shah), Ayesha (Takia). 

You haven?t seen something like this before. Initially you may not grasp the four 

stories running parallel but then you get hooked to it.

Coming to Killer, you are playing Tom Cruise?

(Laughs) I haven?t seen Collateral and 

really don?t know what he?s done. See, let?s be realistic about this. Tom Cruise 

ke jootein ke price se hamari film ban jaati. We finished the film 

in 30 days. Killer is a quick, small film. It is humourous rather than 

gory. It?s more about one-liners, you know, masses ke liye. There?s no 

under-current, no (deeper) meanings.

How do you manage to adapt to these two diametrically 

opposite schools of acting?

For a role like the one in Killer, main 

apne hisaab se karta hoon. The demands from the director are different. The 

idea here is to amuse people rather than search for the character. It?s more of 

a performance than creating a truth. I am comfortable with both styles, I have 

got habituated now, doing different things. I just go by the script. You have 

to have different approaches to different films. If I start probing like I did 

for Yun Hota? for a film like Killer, it just won?t work.

What?s the status of The Namesake?

I haven?t seen the film but I have seen the trailer. 

It?s looking good. I have 100 per cent faith in Mira?s (Nair) capability. Also, 

the base is very strong ? the original novel is moving.

You must be banking on the film for an international 

breakthrough...

I don?t expect anything. My life has never worked 

like that. I just believe in keeping on doing different things that come my way. 

I never expected Namesake. I never expected Warrior. The desire 

is there to do good work and make most of the choices I make.

Which other films are you doing?

There?s Deadline with Konkona and a film named 

Tulsi with Manisha Koirala.

 Dune driving through the desert, cruise on the creek, shopping spree... West Asia is fast emerging as a favourite tourist destination for Calcuttans.

 Compared to Southeast Asia, which for the past few years was a must-visit for a large section of Calcuttans, European and West Asian destinations have sold much more this tourist season. ?There has been a 35 per cent increase in the number of tourists flying to West Asia and Europe this summer from the city,? said Anil Punjabi, chairman (east) of Travel Agents Federation of India.

 The hotspots in West Asia include Dubai and Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates and Muscat in Oman. ?Dubai, however, is the most popular of all stops in West Asia and is as good as any European destination,? Punjabi stressed.

 According to tour operators, a crucial factor behind the change in the preference for Calcutta tourists is the withdrawal of Malaysian Airlines and Jetstar Asia from the city and the Emirates? decision to fly in. 

 Also, the fares of all airlines operating from the city to Southeast Asia have gone up.

 ?Travel from Calcutta to Dubai and other West Asian destinations is increasing steadily,? said Jyrki Nilson, business development manager (West Asia and Pacific Rim) of Emirates Holidays, the tour operator wing of the airline. ?To promote Dubai further, we will set up a strong distribution network in Calcutta by providing special training to travel agents.?

 The travel agents will be provided with an Internet-based system that will help them check instantly the availability of hotels and airline tickets and quote a price to clients before making the bookings.

 To attract tourists, the authorities in Dubai have lined up a series of events, like golf tournaments and shopping and jazz festivals. Officials in the department of tourism and commerce marketing of Dubai said that tourists can avail of a special offer, called Summer Surprise, from June 21.

 According to officials, Dubai is being promoted both as a stopover and standalone desert destination. ?In 10 years, it will be developed as one of the biggest lifestyle destinations in the world,? an official said. Keeping in mind the growing number of tourists, a staggering 445 hotels with around 51,000 rooms are being built in Dubai. ?More budget hotels, too, will come up,? the official informed.

 There are some amongst us who stand out in a crowd by way of their unnatural, quirky behaviour. Reacting to apparently natural events and incidents in an unconventional way, they are extremely sensitive souls who appear eccentric to us. Natasena?s latest production, Katukutu Sambad, introduces the audience to such an extraordinary character. Prone to violent fits of laughter, Majaru, the play?s protagonist, has already suffered two heart-attacks and has been warned by his doctor that more such attacks may prove fatal. Inevitably, he feels induced to laugh again, and this time dies of laughter. When he is brought to the cremation ground, many dead spirits congregate there and share stories about their lives and how they died. Here, Majaru reveals that he has been tickled to death by the actions and attitudes of his family, society and of political leaders. His wry sense of humour, however, allows him to encourage others to live and laugh heartily, and discover peace and happiness in life. Direction: Durga Chakraborty.

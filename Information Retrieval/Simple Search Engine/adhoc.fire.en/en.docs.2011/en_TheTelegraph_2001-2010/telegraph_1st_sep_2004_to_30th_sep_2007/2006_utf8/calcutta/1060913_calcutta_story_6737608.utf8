The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Madan Lal Meena

 Secretary, department of environment, government of West 

 Bengal

 Some municipalities might have taken stray action against small-time vendors but the environment department is mainly targeting the manufacturers. We have carried out three raids in manufacturing units in the last one month and have hauled up 10 for manufacturing carrybags less than 20 microns thick. Our aim is to ban production of all kinds of plastic that are non-recyclable. CMC has also decided to put a condition about non-usage of banned plastic carrybags while issuing a trade licence. People have to go back to the old habit of using jute bags.

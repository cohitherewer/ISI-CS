 The City Diary

 Calcutta High Court on Monday stayed a Calcutta Municipal 

 Corporation (CMC) notification declaring certain areas in 

 the city ?heritage zones?. The notification, issued to advertising 

 companies on May 24, had stated that billboards would not 

 be allowed at BBD Bag (Dalhousie Square), Esplanade and 

 the Maidan. 

 Justice Jyotirmoy Bhattacharya, however, gave the CMC the 

 liberty to take action against advertising companies that 

 have erected billboards without its consent. he order followed 

 petitions by four city-based companies challenging the CMC?s 

 authority in declaring portions of the city heritage zones. 

 They claimed that the civic body?s act was in violation 

 of the West Bengal Heritage Commission Act, 2001. 

 CMC?s lawyer argued: ?The Heritage Conservation Committee 

 formed by the CMC had recommended that certain areas of 

 the city be declared heritage zones, where billboards should 

 not be put up. The mayoral council approved the recommendation.?

 What: Dance World, a dance carnival by Padatik. 

 Where: Kala Mandir.

 When: Thursday and Friday evenings.

 Take a look: From salsa to Bollywood jazz, the Kala Mandir auditorium saw it all as 1,200 students from 23 Padatik dance centres showcased their skills. The carnival had the students vying for the top position in three different age groups toddlers, kids and teenagers.

 The participating dance training centres of Padatik were Howrah, Phoolbagan, Girish Park, AJC Bose Road, Lake Town, VIP Enclave, Moore Avenue, Southern Avenue, Ballygunge, Prince Anwar Shah Road, New Alipore, Divyayan, Hiland Park and Salt Lake branches.

 The hall was packed with parents both anxious and excited to see their children dance to numbers like Chanda chamke, Chand sifarish, humdum suniyo re, Say na say na, Pathshaala and more. The children were in vibrant costumes complete with glitter, tattoos, pink feather earrings, pom-poms and bandanas. 

 The judges DJs Harish, Saranjit, Akash, Ravi and Krishnendu ranked the centres on the basis of synchronisation, steps, costumes, tracks and overall performance.

 The winners on the first day were Lake Town in both the toddlers and kids groups, while Moore Avenue and Southern Avenue bagged the first place in the teenager group. The second day saw Prince Anwar Shah Road groove away with the prize in the toddler section, AJC Bose Road bagging the prize in the kids section, while Salt Lake walked away with the prize in the teenager section.

 Voiceover: A mix of various Western styles like jazz, hip-hop and salsa and a dose of eastern dance like kathak gives our show combination and variety, said Sachetan Jalan, director of the dance carnival.

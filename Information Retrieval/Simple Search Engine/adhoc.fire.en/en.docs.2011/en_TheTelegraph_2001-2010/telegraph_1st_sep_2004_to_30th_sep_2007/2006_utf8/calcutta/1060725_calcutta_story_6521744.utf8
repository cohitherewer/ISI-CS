 A Yash Chopra film gone wrong 

 Screen On amp; Off

 Writer Kamlesh Pandey talks 

 to Sudeshna Banerjee on life pre and post Rang De

 Did you have doubts about Rang De Basanti?

 When I wrote the film, Rakeysh 

 asked who?d watch it. I used to define this film in jest 

 as a Yash Chopra film gone wrong. I respect Yashji 

 but this film was so different from the designer films being 

 made. Beyond good music and some weepy scenes, they have 

 nothing more to offer. 

 I grew up on a different kind 

 of cinema ? 50s, 60s, 70s ? which, besides being entertaining, 

 was aware of what was going on around us. Guru Dutt, Raj 

 Kapoor, V. Shantaram, Bimal Roy.... Film is like literature. 

 The kind of writing you grow up on, that comes out of you 

 when you start writing. hose films have gone into my DNA. 

 I cannot write a song-and-dance movie.

 When you want to entertain, you write a Chaalbaaz... 

 That happened because Sridevi, 

 Anupam, Rohini, Pankuj (Parashar) and I had such fun on 

 the sets. That got reflected in the film. I worked on the 

 story, screenplay and dialogues. Pankuj helped with the 

 screenplay. He has a wacky sense of humour, like me. We 

 had done Jalwa together, which is quite irreverent 

 in many places.

 You did many Bollywood movies in between... 

 I did some very bad films, a lot 

 of south Indian remakes. The reason was a) money and b) 

 after I did Tezaab, I became part of the Boney Kapoor 

 camp. Whichever film Boney wanted to remake, I had to be 

 there. They were done in that spirit. Like I was writing 

 Dil, when Javedsaab could not complete Beta. 

 I had to step in. There was a period when all the Anil-Madhuri 

 films were done by me. The audience then was not so divided 

 as it is now. 

 When did you start out?

 I started with Ankahi for 

 Amol Palekar. That was, I think, 1986. I have not done more 

 than 35 films. Others like Kader Khan are doing 35 a year. 

 They have a manufacturing facility which I do not have, 

 30 assistants who are writing X-Y-Z films. I don?t have 

 assistants. I love writing movies. Would you ask your assistant 

 to make love to your girlfriend? Never.

 How did you get into TV? 

 I was with Rediffusion. My friend 

 Ashok Kurien was on the board of Zee TV. He made me join 

 as the first head of programming in the country. Luckily 

 I knew nothing of TV, so we could break all rules.. Antakshari, 

 Horror Show, Campus, Banegi Apni Baat, 

 Tara, game shows... There were three lakh letters 

 from viewers every week. But after four years I got tired. 

 I began to miss my writing. 

 Was returning to films difficult?

 I knew Rakeysh for a long time. 

 He knew Amitabh Bachchan as they were doing BPL ads. We 

 got talking. That?s how my first script Samjhauta Express 

 was born. It was meant to launch Abhishek. But Rakeysh 

 was new and J.P. Dutta was a big director. Border 

 was a hit. So Abhishek signed Refugee. 

 Samjhauta too had a Indo-Pak 

 subject but a different story. I still feel Samjhauta 

 would have been a better launchpad for Abhishek. Amitji 

 asked if I had anything else. I had Rang De, which 

 was called Aahuti then. I narrated the idea to Jayaji. 

 She said Abhishek is just beginning, maybe it?s not right. 

 Perceptually the film is so ground-breaking maybe she felt 

 a little insecure. Nothing had been done in Indian cinema 

 with that kind of a backward-forward structure. 

 Were you part of Aks as well? 

 Yeah. I wrote the screenplay and 

 the dialogue in the hope that my Samjhauta would 

 get made. I didn?t have full faith in the story of Aks. 

 It was an interesting idea but what it lacked was humour, 

 relief. The relationship between husband-wife was not working. 

 But Manoj and Amitji were remarkable? Perhaps today 

 it would have been more successful. 

 What came next? 

 Then I wrote Aahuti, and 

 changed the name to Young Guns. Then I changed it 

 to Rang De Basanti to remind me of the spirit of 

 the film, of Bhagat Singh ? that was his line ? his spirit 

 coming back to haunt the youth of 2001. We took it to producers. 

 They all rejected it. When Aamir heard it, he loved it and 

 said he wanted to do it. And then Rahman came on board. 

 Things became easier after that.

 Did you dump TV? 

 I was so cynical after Aks. 

 In the next four years, I wrote Dilli 6, which Rakeysh 

 is doing now, Awaaz, Bhairavi without knowing 

 whether these films would ever get made. I was on the verge 

 of returning to advertising. But once Aamir came, I decided 

 to wait. I knew either Rang De will drop dead, or 

 it will be huge. On January 28, I went to a college convocation 

 in Bandra. The film had been released two days ago. My picture 

 was there in an afternoon daily. One of the volunteers recognised 

 me and word spread. I was mobbed by 300 students. I am no 

 Shah Rukh or Salman. This must have been a first in India 

 that a poor writer was getting mobbed. 

 What is Dilli 6 about? 

 It?s a comedy about old Delhi?the 

 Jama Masjid area. One night we were walking in the area 

 for research. One boy, who was fighting with others, shouted: 

 ?Haath na lagana, Dilli chhay ka launda hoon?? 

 I said ?Rakeysh, that?s the title.? It?s not a comedy like 

 Golmaal or Garam Masala. It?s on attitudes 

 and idiosyncracies of old Delhi. Abhishek is in the lead. 

 We have Waheeda Rehman, Kirrron Kher, Om Puri? After that, 

 we are doing Bhairavi, which has all three Bachchans 

 in it. 

 What is your Balaji connection? 

 While waiting for Rang De to 

 release, I ideated for Kahanii Ghar Ghar Ki and Kavyanjali. 

 Daily soaps are a monster. They need help to take a story 

 forward. What Ektaa has done is she has added glamour. Now 

 I have given them a concept for Thodi si Zameen, 

 Thoda sa Aasman starring Smriti Irani. It is as realistic 

 as it gets and is very unlike Balaji. If it works, it will 

 open doors for many such shows. The remote is with the women.

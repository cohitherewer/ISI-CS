The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 All-girl shoplifter gang alert

 IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI

 Beware Puja shoppers, a gang of women shoplifters from Andhra Pradesh has just landed in Calcutta.

 The women, smartly dressed and fluent in English, are on the prowl at malls, jewellery showrooms and multiplexes across the city.

 Alarmed by their presence, sleuths held a special meeting a few days ago to boost security at and around high-end retail outlets.

 Plainclothes officers, including women, are being deployed at various shopping malls and jewellery showrooms to curb shoplifting, Ajay Kumar, deputy commissioner of police (south), told Metro on Sunday.

 We have also alerted owners of the malls. Besides, sleuths of the detective department are keeping a tab on the gang, he added.

 The senior officers also discussed the strategy of identifying and arresting the women shoplifters.

 One option is deployment of more sleuths in plain clothes. Officers-in-charge of police stations, under whose jurisdiction most of the malls and shopping plazas are located, were present at the meeting, Kumar said. 

 A sleuth said that last year, two women shoplifters were arrested at a jewellery shop on Camac Street. During interrogation, they revealed that they were from Andhra Pradesh and had taken to shoplifting a couple of years earlier, the officer added.

 Police are also on the lookout for a group of amateur shoplifters from South and North 24-Parganas.

 Two women from South 24-Parganas, Pinky and Ruksana, both in their early 30s, were arrested recently at a mall in south Calcutta, said Dulal Chatterjee, officer-in-charge, Gariahat police station.

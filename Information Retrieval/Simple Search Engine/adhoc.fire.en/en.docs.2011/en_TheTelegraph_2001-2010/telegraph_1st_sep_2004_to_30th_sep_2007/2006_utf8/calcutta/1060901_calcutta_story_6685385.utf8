The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Shes back in a womans world

 Glam again: Tulip 

 Joshi

 You had first seen her as the 

 new Yash Chopra girl in Sanjay Gadhvis take on My Best 

 Friends Wedding Mere Yaar Ki Shaadi Hai. 

 Next, Tulip Joshi gave up the greasepaint and became the 

 hapless gaon ki gori in the festival hit, Manish 

 Jhas Matrubhoomi on the only woman in a mans world. 

 She returned to the mainstream with the Shahid Kapur movie 

 Dil Maange More. And then she disappeared.

 Now, Tulip is back as she returned to her ramp roots by turning out for the Nisha Jamval fashion show at Amara last weekend. Says Tulip: It was exciting, after a long hiatus from the ramp. It was such deja vu!

 She is quick to add: But it was great fun and damn cool. The outfits too looked pretty. I loved every bit of it.

 It wont be long before Tulip is seen on the big screen again. She will be star opposite Vatsal Taarzan Seth in Manish Guptas Hostel and then in the Kay Kay Menon cricket film Shoonya.

 I am so excited to be doing commercial 

 cinema again, says Tulip. Though I am proud of Matrubhoomi, 

 because it gave me an opportunity to showcase my acting 

 skills at the beginning of my career, I always relished 

 doing mainstream films. I want to play roles that would 

 suit my age. Meri Yaar Ki Shaadi and Dil Maange 

 More were essentially commercial films and I had a blast 

 shooting for them.

 Balancing act: Sayantani 

 Ghosh

 Sweet struggle 

 Slow and steady is Sayantani Ghoshs 

 mantra for making a mark in the telly town of Mumbai, where 

 she is shooting for the STAR Plus soap Kumkum. Before 

 she moved to Mumbai five months back, Sayantani was struggling 

 to make it to Tollywoods list of leading ladies.

 Currently, the girl is balancing 

 screens small and big. While playing Antara in Kumkum 

 she has scored Sujit Guhas action-drama Sangharsh 

 co-starring Prosenjit.

 I have the role of a loyal secretary to Bijoy, a business icon played by Prosenjit. I provide all the vital information, clues and links to prevent my boss and his company from falling into the villains trap. In the middle of all this I fall in love with Bijoy, but it remains unrequited, says Sayantani, who earlier starred opposite Prosenjit in Raju Uncle and Swapno.

 After wrapping up the first schedule 

 at the Tolly studios, Sayantani returns to Mumbai now, only 

 to be back here by the end of September. The second phase 

 of shooting for Sangharsh will also find her travelling 

 to Hyderabad for a song-and-dance sequence.

 Mumbai, so far, has been good 

 to this model-turned-actress. People have been very friendly 

 and generous. Im not expecting too much right now and concentrating 

 on projects for television Mumbai is more like a learning 

 school for me. Im also taking my time to get more comfortable 

 with the Hindi language because eventually I would want 

 to try my hand at films, she signs off.

 On song: Kumar Sanu

 Comeback chorus 

 After lying low for a while, Kumar 

 Sanu is resurfacing as music composer and producer with 

 Utthan. The Hindi film, starring Neha Dhupia and 

 Priyanshu Chatterjee, focuses on the dark side of media 

 and politics. Utthan is directed by Ujjal Chatterjee 

 who had earlier made Escape from Taliban starring 

 Manisha Koirala.

 My father was a music director and I would assist him in his work. The urge to turn music composer has always been there, said Sanu.

 Having composed six romantic, semi-classical and item numbers for Utthan, Sanu has roped in Asha Bhonsle, Alka Yagnik, Sonu Nigam, Sapna Mukherjee and Hema Sardesai to lend their voices to songs written by Sudhakar Sharma.

 Sanu himself has sung two songs for Uthhan, which happens to be his second venture as producer after Gaaney Bhuban Bhoriye Debo, the Bengali film co-starring Rituparna Sengupta where he had also debuted as an actor.

 I am currently focussing on both music direction and singing. Singing for me can never take a backseat but the type and quality of songs that are being composed these days have turned too western. They dont blend with my kind of singing, claims Sanu.

 The songster is now gearing up 

 for two more Hindi films, Doraha and Mausam, 

 for which he will score the music. Most of my compositions 

 will have prominent strains of Indian melodies, he stressed.

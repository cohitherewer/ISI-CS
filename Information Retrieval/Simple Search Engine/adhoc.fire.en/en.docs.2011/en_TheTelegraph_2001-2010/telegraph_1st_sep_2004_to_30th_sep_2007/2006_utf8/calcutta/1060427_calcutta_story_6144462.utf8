 The heritage committee of the civic body passed a resolution on Tuesday restricting billboards in Dalhousie Square (BBD Bag) and Chowringhee. 

 The panel considers billboards a source of visual pollution and most of the existing ones in the heritage precincts will be pulled down.

 The resolution, which was passed unanimously by the panel, will be placed for ratification in the mayoral council meeting next month. 

 ?The permission of the civic heritage committee will be mandatory before erecting a billboard in BBD Bag and Chowringhee,? asserted mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya.

 ?Regulations are needed to prevent Calcutta from becoming a billboard jungle. The walls and skyline of the city are now almost entirely covered with gaudily-painted advertisements of food, furniture, innerwear, cement, iron and steel and shoes,? he observed.

 Only the portion of Chowringhee between Victoria House in the north and Bishop?s House in the south will come under the purview of the billboard restriction.

 Municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay, Ramananda Bandopadhyay, Samir Rakshit, Debkumar Bose and Goutam Sengupta comprise the heritage committee. 

 The civic body has already declared BBD Bag, Chowringhee and Park Street heritage precincts and vowed to preserve their architectural beauty. The College Square area is also likely to be preserved for its cultural and educational significance.

 ?The first phase of the billboard removal operation will be undertaken in Dalhousie and Chowringhee. Similar restrictions might be imposed on Park Street, College Square and other areas that are declared heritage zones,? said mayoral council member (information amp; culture) Faiyaz Ahmed Khan. 

 There are about 200 billboards on civic, public works department and private land in Chowringhee and BBD Bag. 

 The civic authorities earn Rs 15.21 crore annually from billboards. The ban will mean a loss of Rs 6 crore annually.

 Municipal commissioner had directed the chief municipal architect and town planner to prepare a list of billboards in BBD Bag and Chowringhee. 

 The billboards that block the view of a heritage structure will be pulled down first.

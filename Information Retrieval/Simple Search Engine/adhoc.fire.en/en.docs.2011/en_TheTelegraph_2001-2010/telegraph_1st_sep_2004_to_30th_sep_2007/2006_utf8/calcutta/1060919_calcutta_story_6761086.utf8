What: Exhibition of paintings by Swaroop Mukherji to celebrate 150 years of 

the Calcutta Police.

Where: The Oberoi Grand.

When: Friday evening.

Take a look: The exhibition marked the culmination of months spent capturing 

various facets of the citys police force. Swaroops concern was not 

only in portraying the buildings, but also depicting the human face of the police 

force. I think it was most important to capture the people and the animals 

that make up the force, as well as some of the wonderful architecture, he 

explained.

The paintings have been compiled in a book, with the 

art works accompanied by anecdotes penned by Oindrilla Dutt. What struck 

me was the motivation of the police, whether it was on the football field or in 

the classroom, they were making a great effort in the community, Swaroop 

said in his welcome note.

Among the many speeches by, among others, home secretary 

Prasad Ranjan Roy and police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee the one that stood 

out was Governor Gopal Krishna Gandhis. Praising the paintings for the 

whole range of emotions, he went on to talk about the history of the police. 

One must remember that the police force is made up of individualspolicemen 

have to deal with crises on a daily and hourly basis, stressed Gandhi.

The exhibition is one of many events being held this 

year to mark 150 years of the force.

 Shabana Azmis tussar kurtas and antique-look silver jewellery ? perfect ingredients for the quintessential arty look. Simi Garewals pristine whites, elegant cuts and long dark hair ? all that goes to make a classic style concoction.

 If fashionistas were to be classified, there would perhaps be four forms ? classic, arty, street and filmi. Where they shop, what they buy, their style statements and trademark looks? Starting this week, GoodLife brings you the fashion mantra of these style types. Presenting a peek into the classic dressers wardrobe.

 Who is she?

 A classic dresser is a panorama of rich cultural heritage that she has witnessed over the years. Classic dressing is synonymous with an elegant sense of style and brings forward the timeless appeal of fashion, says designer and style consultant Sunipa Samadder.

 According to designer Sayon Mitra, a classic woman is one whose style is minimalist and sophisticated ? again something that has stood the test of time. It essentially denotes very chic, well-tailored garments, something that is not defined by passing fads and trends, says Sayon. On a wider note, he adds: A classic wearer has to be someone who is extremely confident and very sure of her goals and standing in life.

 Though putting together a classic look seems pretty easy, couture jeweller Raj Mahtani feels that this look is indeed the toughest to perfect. A lot of hard work goes into being effortlessly classic, says Raj.

 Theme talk

 Follow a certain theme throughout your look, especially while co-ordinating your outfit and jewellery, says Sunipa. A classic dresser will never team a south Indian sari with polki jewellery from Rajasthan. Similarly, an elegant western dresser will never sport a chunky silver neckpiece when a string of pearls is what the occasion and outfit demands. Classic ethnic combos are bomkai saris with filigree accessories and ghatchola with meenakari gold, she adds.

 Shoes and bags, too, need to be basic and muted. Not too much colour and glitter, the accessories should be simple and nice. Tie-ups, wedges or uggs (a kind of boots), whatever be the seasons saga, a neutral pair of sandals is what you will find a classic lady in, always.

 A classic stylist will keep the colour story same while she experiments with the fabric texture. Similarly, while trying out various hues, she is bound to keep the fabric front constant, explains Sunipa. Draping styles are kept close to authentic.

 Make-up expert Ambika Pillai prescribes the the perfect look for these ladies. Ethnic classy dressers look great with dark, pronounced eyes. Even if they are not the kajal type, they could use liner. The mouth looks best when kept pale and matte. Complete the look with a low bun or twist your hair into a ponytail. 

 The western classic woman, says Ambika, should highlight her brow bone and the centre of the eyelids with white shimmer. The cheeks should be kept healthy and rosy and the mouth glossy. Soft curls or straight hair complement her style best.

 Must haves 

 Ethnic or western, a classic dressers wardrobe is extremely well thought out. With unnecessary extras out of the way, their style essentials are simple and fuss free. Lots of separates, but none off the cuff. They are the sort of people who tend to team their pieces with utmost care. Many of them also follow a restricted colour story, all so that they come across more co-ordinated and stylish. The result ? a perfectly complemented couture ensemble, sometimes personally put together, at other times worn off designer racks.

 Sayon lists some wardrobe musts for her:

 A well-cut white shirt 

 Tailored black jacket and trouser suit

 A pair of blue denims 

 Soft Pashmina shawls in beige, maroon and charcoal

 White churidar-kurta set

 Paisley printed chiffon saris

 Delicate pearl jewellery ? ear-tops with a choker 

 Pointed black boots and a pair of stilettos, also in black or nude

 A branded leather handbag ? a Fendi or Gucci

 A classy pair of sunglasses

 Shop stops 

 Discounts and bargains are not really their deal in life. They would much rather spend double the price for stylish pieces as and when they spot them. Fittings are a top priority and hence a luxurious trial room is a must. They also appreciate a helpful and knowledgeable sales team to answer queries. 

 Spring-summer or fall-winter, whatever the season, the elegant lady can be spotted at international branded stores like Armani, Ralph Lauren, Marks amp; Spencer, Chanel, Christian Dior, Valentino and Zara. 

 She would also go for most Indian designer labels, especially ones like Abu Jani-Sandeep Khosla, Ritu Kumar, Raghavendra Rathore and Rajesh Pratap Singh. Stores like Anokhi and state handloom emporiums are also among her design destinations.

 Shreyashi Dasgupta,

 Address not given

 It is right because some people are in the habit of not paying property tax. If their water supply is stopped, they will have no option but to pay up. Stopping water supply is a good way of making people pay their property tax.

 Rrahul Rroy, 

 Nagerbazar

 The authorities do not have the right to deny water supply to anyone since it is impossible to remain alive without water. Moreover, property tax is in no way connected with consumption of water. Water supply might be stopped if water tax is not paid, but why should it be stopped for not paying property tax? Those who fail to pay property tax due to financial hardships should not be made to suffer.

 Ranadip Ganguly, 

 Diamond Park

 It will be inhuman to stop water supply for failure to pay property tax. Water is vital for sustenance.

 Asis Bhowmik,

 Kaikhali 

 Water supply should be stopped for failure to pay property tax. Defaulting on the levy is a serious offence and those doing so are not only violating the law but are creating a bottleneck in providing civic amenities to all. 

 Indranil Sanyal, 

 Dhakuria

 It will be too harsh to stop water supply to property tax defaulters as water is a basic necessity of life. Such punitive measures cannot be allowed in a civilised society. Instead, a stiff penalty could be imposed on the defaulters.

 Tuli Das,

 Baisakhi, Salt Lake

 The majority of the population in the country is poor or middle-class. Each and every acquisition of this section involves a lot of planning. Buying a house is probably the biggest of the purchases in the lives of most of these people. If after all the thought, someone finds it difficult to pay property tax, the authorities must look at the underlying reason instead of disconnecting water supply. 

P.K. Bhattacharjee,

 Salt Lake

 The civic body incurs expenses to provide services. If it is not allowed to recover the amount, it will have to make good the loss by stopping the services. Therefore, it is futile to start a row over water charges. Since water is essential for life, it should be supplied free to the poor.

 Lala Ttanmoy Das,

 Salt Lake

 The decision on whether water supply should be disconnected for failure to pay property tax needs to be unambiguous. But the reason behind the failure to pay the tax should be probed before a punitive step is taken. It must also be ensured that the provision to disconnect water supply is not misused by corrupt officials. 

 Muddasir Zafar,

 Narkeldanga 

 Water is essential for human life. So denying water supply for the failure to pay property tax is really unjust and unfair.

 Ranajit Chatterjee, 

 Parnashree Palli

 A civic body is not a charitable institution and cannot afford to waive taxes. The quality of service it offers depends on the amount of tax collected. Basic amenities like water supply, garbage disposal, basic education and primary healthcare cannot be jeopardised by the reluctance of some people to pay their dues. The discontinuation of services is the easiest means available to the civic bodies to compel property-owners to pay up. In fact, those who do not pay taxes are not eligible for any civic service. 

 Nidhi Poddar,

 Salt Lake

 We need to realise it is wrong to enjoy civic services without paying the taxes. The civic body must take strong action against property tax defaulters. Denying water supply should be the last step.

 Inayat Hussain,

 Marquis Street

 The corporation has every 

 right to stop the water supply if one fails to pay property 

 tax. But before such a step is taken, the corporation must 

 ensure that water is supplied to those who are paying the 

 property tax. There are several places in the city where 

 filtered water is not supplied by the corporation even though 

 the residents regularly pay the property tax.

 Biswajiban Majumdar

 Chairman, Bidhannagar Municipality

 Water line cannot be disconnected 

 for non-payment of property tax since it will be a violation 

 of a court order. One possible punishment is disconnecting 

 and sealing the sewer line. Another option is sending a 

 court notice to the defaulters and fine them.

 Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya

 Mayor, Calcutta Municipal Corporation

 We can always disconnect water 

 lines if one does not pay property tax. As there is no tax 

 on water in Calcutta, this becomes a part of the property. 

 Threat of disconnection is an effective tool to make defaulters 

 pay up. Bulk consumers, who pay for water, cannot be refused 

 supply even if they default on property tax.

 Bengali blues in CBSE

 Over the past few years, I have noted that students opting 

 for Bengali as their second language under the CBSE board 

 are scoring very poor marks, compared to those who opt for 

 Hindi or Sanskrit. This has discouraged the students. Calcutta 

 University doesnt admit students in the degree courses 

 without a second language. With poor marks in Bengali, many 

 students are not getting selected for their desired degree 

 courses in the university. They are in a fix about which 

 language to choose. Please look into the matter.

 Chandan Basu,

 Principal, Mother International School, Salt Lake.

 Our officers have discussed this particular problem and 

 some step will be taken soon in the interest of candidates. 

 P.I. Sabu, 

 Deputy Secretary, 

 CBSE, Delhi.

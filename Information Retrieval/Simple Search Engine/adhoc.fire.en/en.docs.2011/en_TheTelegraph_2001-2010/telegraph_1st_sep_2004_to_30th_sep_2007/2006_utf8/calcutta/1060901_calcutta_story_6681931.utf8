The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Low-cost flights to metros

 A STAFF REPORTER

 IndiGo, the low-cost airline that started operations in Calcutta on Wednesday, has plans to connect the city with the other metros and major tourist destinations.

 On the anvil are daily flights to several destinations, including other metros, from Calcutta, president and chief executive officer of IndiGo Bruce Ashby told Metro.

 The airline, which is offering a minimum fare of Rs 1,099 (excluding taxes) for one-way ticket from Calcutta to Delhi, will start operations between the city and Mumbai and Nagpur this winter.

 In the pipeline are flights from the city to Chennai, Bangalore and Hyderabad. Then, we plan to launch services to popular tourist destinations, to which direct air connectivity is not available, said Ashby. Jaipur is one such tourist stop. 

 The airline is also considering daily flights from Calcutta to Ranchi, Bhubaneswar, Patna and other cities in the neighbouring states. There are several cities on our radar. The opportunities are being explored, Ashby observed.

 IndiGo is a subsidiary of InterGlobe Enterprises, a travel conglomerate headquartered in Gurgaon. 

 Last year, the airline had placed an order for 100 A320 aircraft, the highest ever by an Indian company. Airbus 320 has a capacity of 180 seats.

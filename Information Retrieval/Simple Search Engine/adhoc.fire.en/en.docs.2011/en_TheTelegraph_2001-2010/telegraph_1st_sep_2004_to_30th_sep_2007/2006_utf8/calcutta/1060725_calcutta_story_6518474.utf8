 A folk play based on the ritual of human-sacrifice still prevalent in the remote districts of Himachal Pradesh, Kaheka narrates the tragic incidents that lead the people of a village to denounce its age-old, barbarous practices. Viram, a student in Delhi, hails from a family of metal sculptors, who live in a village in Kullu. He returns to his village along with his friends, Girish and Jyoti. His city-bred friends express shock when they learn that Viram?s father will not be allowed to be part of a ceremony to establish an idol he created, since he belongs to a low caste. Viram?s brother Thunia is influenced by them and steals the idol. When it is found, the village heads ask Viram to atone for the sin. As human-sacrifice is forbidden, he is given opium and falls in a deep slumber, while the sacrificial ritual is performed. But, he fails to regain consciousness even long afterwards, and ultimately dies. This becomes the turning point in the life of the village ?untouchables?, and they rise in demand for their right to self-governance. Direction: Amitava Dasgupta.

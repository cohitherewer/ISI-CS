 Lilt from a faraway land

 A presentation by Japanese and 

 Indian musicians at GD Birla Sabhagar, courtesy the consulate-general 

 of Japan and the Calcutta School of Music, on September 

 9, was a first for the city (picture below by Pradip Sanyal).

 While young upcoming musicians Mita Nag and Biplab Bhattacharyya played the sitar and tabla, the koto was played by Ai Kajigano. Kajigano said that she has been playing the stringed musical instrument, once used exclusively by a certain priestly class in Japan for religious functions, since early childhood. Her mother used to play the six-feet instrument with 17-30 strings and the music was with me all the time while I was eating or sleeping So that is what I wanted to learn, said Kajigano.

 She has also learnt the shamisen (a three-stringed instrument) from distinguished musicians. There is no demand for koto, rued Kajigano who has graduated from the NHK academy for Japanese Traditional Music. In a bid to popularise these old instruments she gives public performances, playing solo or as part of koto ensembles like Soemon and Radentai. She also plays pop music, makes arrangements on the computer, or even collaborates with sitar and tabla players, but a koto is a koto and nothing can really match it, she smiles.

 The shakuhachi player, Hiromu Motonaga, doesnt mind creating his own ensemble of traditional Japanese instruments like shakuhachi, koto and shamisen. His long exposure to western culture and music has allowed him to experiment with jazz and even pen some pop music, but his heart lies with traditional Japanese instruments. The shakuhachi, a thick bamboo flute with five finger holes, was the instrument of Zen priests of the 17th century and has survived even when the sect was banned during the Meji period, said Motonaga. Today he is both a member of the rock band Hana Matsuri and a member of the unique shakuhachi trio Hannya Teikoku. With some fine compositions to his name he cherishes memories of having played with musicians from Manipur.

 Though establishing oneself as a professional musician is as difficult in Japan as it is in India, the sho player, Naoyuki Manabe, has succeeded in popularising what was an instrument used in Japanese court music called the gagaku. He effectively combines the organ sounds of the sho, which consists of 17 slender bamboo pipes in one bundle, with the violin, double bass and lute.

 Stage-savvy

 Rangotsav, an inter-school Hindi drama competition, was held at St Xaviers Collegiate School recently.

 The productions staged were of high standard. The event was judged by Mritunjay Srivasta and Ashutosh Singh. 

 The first school to take the stage was La Martiniere for Girls, presenting Tamanna Ki Kahani, based on the topic of female emancipation. Don Bosco Park Circus rocked with their portrayal of superstitions and blind beliefs in the contemporary world. Lakshmipat Singhania were also brilliant trying to show mans over-dependence on gadgets.

 Up next was Samay, presented by Akhilesh Gupta, Aamil Khan and Anshuman Bagri of the host school. Akhilesh was later adjudged the best director and best scriptwriter. The boy from Don Bosco Park Circus bagged the best actor award.

 Caught in the act

 The new academic session for first-year students at Heritage Institute of Technology started in August. Bunking classes and abandoning lectures, we, the second-year students, waited for the freshers to pass by like famished predators. For us, it was just a year-old story. We recalled our anxiety as we stepped into the campus. Finally, it was our turn to rule the ragging sessions.

 After a long wait in vain, I proceeded to attend my lectures. That was when I spotted a boy loitering around in the corridor. Wasting no time, I hauled him up for missing lectures. Half-way through my peptalk, he asked in an almost-choked voice: Which year do you belong to? I defiantly remarked that he being a first-year had no right to question the question. His attitude changed in a fraction of a second. Stifling a laugh, he rebuked: I am your immediate senior. You are in for trouble, lady!

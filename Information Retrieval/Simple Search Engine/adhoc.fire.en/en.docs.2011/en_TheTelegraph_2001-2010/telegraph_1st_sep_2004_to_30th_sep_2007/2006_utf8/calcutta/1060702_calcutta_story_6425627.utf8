 Next weekend you can be at ... 

Varsey

 At an elevation of 3,049 m, Varsey 

 in west Sikkim is a thriving hill resort despite being relatively 

 remote. 

 Its charms are yet unspoilt by human hand. But you get the feeling that the day is not far when tourists will circumvent Darjeeling and Pelling and make a beeline for such a destination.

 You might miss the amenities of more developed tourist spots, but now is the best time to make a trip to Varsey if you prefer pristine natural splendour.

 There is a motorable road to Hilley. From there, you can trek to Varsey. There is also a walking trail, but the hour-long trek is by far the more interesting option.

 Out of the seven to eight categories of treks, the one from Hilley to Varsey is know as a ?rhododendron trek?. The complete route is Naya Bazaar-Hilley-Varsey-Dentam-Pemeyangtse.

 At Hilley, which is at an altitude of 2,744 m (9,000 ft), silver fir, hemlock, magnolia, and rhododendron are abundant. As one approaches Varsey, rhododendrons reign supreme.

 The area is a riot of colour from 

 March to May, when the flora is in bloom. The branches along 

 the trek route entwine to form a leafy canopy. Sunlight 

 filters through the fretwork of foliage to shed splashes 

 of light on the flowers. 

 Once you reach the hill resort, a vista of endless snow-clad peaks opens up under the turquoise sky. You will rarely find a better opportunity to admire nature?s might and magnificence.

 Roam at leisure along trails fringed by oak, pine and birch. Many-hued butterflies flash past from flower to flower. A breeze sends clouds scampering from one peak to another as a formation of birds soars overhead. Nature seems to exult at Varsey. 

 Once the veil of the cloud lifts, you will find yourself face to face with Kanchenjunga and other titans of the eastern Himalayas.

 Most tourists stay in the cosy and comfortable Trekkers? Hut at Guras Kunj. Rhododendron Resort is another option.

 The next day, wake up at dawn to watch the sun rise over the Kanchenjunga. Later, walk down the serpentine road to Hilley from Jorethang via Somebaria. The sleepy hamlet comes alive on Sunday, when the weekly haat (market) takes pride of place.

 Attractions abound around Varsey. In fact, many make it their base for touring west Sikkim.

 Just outside the hill station there is a spot that offers a wonderful view of Chiyabhanjan on the Singalila range. Far below is the village of Burikhop. From Varsey, it takes three to four hours to trek to Chiyabhanjan.

 Those interested in adventure can opt for treks to Ribdi, Bhareng (in Sikkim) and Gorkhey (in West Bengal). Uttarey, home to a rich variety of flora and fauna, can be reached via Dentam.

 The residents of Varsey are as 

 beautiful as its surroundings. You are likely to come back 

 touched by their hospitality.

 Going 

 There is motorable road from Siliguri 

 to Hilley, via Jorethang and Naya Bazaar. The distance is 

 135 km. Buses are infrequently available from Jorethang 

 to Hilley. Jeeps are available on the route. The closest 

 rail station is New Jalpaiguri. The nearest airport is Bagdogra. 

 The trek from Hilley to Varsey is 4 km.

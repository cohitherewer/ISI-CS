 An epic act

 A research-based production on the folk theatre of our country, Bharat Katha is built around an important episode of Vyasas Mahabharata. Exploring the raw, dynamic energy of folk theatrical forms, it is a dramatic performance that also has elements of Indian classical music embedded within it, along with folk music and dance forms like pandavani, jhumur and chhau. Apart from the core cast, a group of chhau dancers from a remote village in Purulia also features in this production. The plot revolves around the incidents of the battle of Kurukshetra, when Abhimanyu boldly ventures to penetrate the dangerous, enigmatic chakravyuh. Once within it, he bravely fights great Kaurava warriors, but Arjunas young son is tragically killed by the Kauravas. Participants have been trained in folk forms by Teejan Bai and by Amulya Kumar, a jhumur singer of Purulia. Design and direction: Manish Mitra.

 Event: Play in Bengali, Bharat Katha, produced by Kasba Arghya

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Sing, don?t swing in bars

 - SLEUTHS FROWN ON MAHARASHTRA MENACE

 PRONAB MONDAL

 The city police have resolved not to let Calcutta go the ?Mumbai way? ? pre-ban, that is ? with plans being chalked out to crack down on bars hiring dance girls.

 ?This city is not Mumbai and there is no question of allowing dance bars here,? asserted Gyanwant Singh, deputy commissioner of police (I), detective department. Bar singers are allowed foot-tapping or minimal movement of hands or legs, in keeping with the rhythm of the songs, but they cannot break into a full-blown dance, ruled an officer. 

 The detective department has prepared a list of music bars that have recruited dancers in violation of rules and regulations. 

 ?The bars were issued licences on condition that they would hire only singers. But our officers have found that several bars, particularly those in central Calcutta, have been hosting dance sessions, too. We have decided to take stern action against them,? deputy commissioner Singh added.

 Following their visit to the bars, police have found out how the owners are fooling them. ?They are playing a trick, engaging girls ignorant of even the basics of singing as singers,? said an officer.

 ?Two girls appear on the stage for a duet. While one of them actually sings, the other merely lip-synchs but keeps dancing, all the while clutching the microphone. Most of the customers, high on alcohol, cannot see through the trick,? the officer explained.

 The spurt in the number of dance-girls follows the Maharashtra government?s decision to close down dance bars. Hundreds of girls from the city and its adjoining areas, who used to work in dance bars in Maharashtra, have come back and are being recruited here.

 Bar-owners admit that their business has boomed ever since they started hiring dance girls. ?Our customers have almost doubled. Earlier, the bars would become empty after 9 pm. But now, you won?t get a seat even till 10.30,? said the owner of a bar in central Calcutta.

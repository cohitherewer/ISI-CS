 Eight weeks after the birth of 

 their second child, Britney Spears has dumped her husband 

 of two years, aspiring rapper Kevin Federline. The ink is 

 not yet dry on the divorce papers but its already big news 

 on the blogs.

 Martin (http://mus ingsofabysta 

 nder.blogspot.com) writes: Britney is barely an adult, 

 and yet shes already married and divorced twice, and now 

 shes depriving her very, very young children of a full-time 

 relationship with their father. He may be a slob, but shes 

 no princess.

 Greg Krehbiel (http://crowhill.net/blog) 

 has a legal take on the split: The way the laws are right 

 now, a woman can decide to end a marriage whether the 

 man has done anything wrong or not and shes likely to 

 get primary custody of the kids... Of course this wouldnt 

 be a financial hardship for Spears, who can go on a tour 

 and make more money than most people will make in their 

 lives. But if she wants to opt out... without proving any 

 fault on Federlines part, she should have to leave the 

 kids behind.

 A golden chapter on the golfing 

 greens has not escaped attention. Prabhu (http://prabhukrish.net) 

 is disappointed that Jeev Milkha Singhs triumph at the 

 Volvo Masters is not getting the applause it deserves. One 

 girl reaches the fourth round of US Open, the nation goes 

 gaga. Eleven men in blue, who play for the Board of Control 

 for Cricket in India, and not for India, keep losing non-stop, 

 accolades and attention And a guy wins an European Masters 

 in golf, silence. 

 Not totally true. Jeev certainly 

 has backers among bloggers. John Cheeran (http://johncheeran.blogspot. 

 com) in a post titled Jeev Milkha: Breaking into big 

 league writes: Jeev Milkha has paid us back for our faith 

 in him with a splendid triumph... He did not have many Indian 

 golf heroes to emulate. In that sense, Jeev has been a pioneer.

 Another golf hero Jyoti Randhawa 

 has his share of fans. How he will manage to hold his own 

 against Tiger Woods is the latest point of discussion. Log

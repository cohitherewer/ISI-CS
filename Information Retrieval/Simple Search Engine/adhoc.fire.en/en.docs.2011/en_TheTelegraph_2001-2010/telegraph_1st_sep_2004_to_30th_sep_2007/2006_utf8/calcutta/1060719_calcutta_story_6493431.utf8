 Police lunge buck passes

 IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI

 Lodge a complaint against rogue cops and you might be branded ?mad? by Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s people-friendly police force. 

 Four days after two constables allegedly hurled abuses and made a lunge at 26-year-old Tanushree Ghosh outside the civic headquarters for being denied a bribe, cops have made no progress in the case. That, however, has not stopped them from questioning Tanushree?s mental stability.

 ?She is a little mad. She came to the police station and created a scene because action has not been taken against the two constables. Isn?t it a bit too much?? asked an investigating officer on Tuesday.

 On Sunday, the officers had summoned Tanushree to New Market police station. They questioned her for over an hour, repeatedly asking if she could recognise the constables. 

 ?I went to the police station with my brother on Sunday afternoon. They started grilling me and I was asked to narrate the incident once again. I told them that I had already lodged a written complaint with the officer-in-charge, explaining in detail what had happened that day. But they were adamant and I had to go over the episode once more,? said Tanushree.

 The officer told her that she would have to visit the police station whenever she is called. ?Since it is a serious allegation, your presence will be required several times,? the cops reportedly said. 

 Tanushree added: ?They told me that an identification parade would be conducted on Monday and I would be called. But they have not got back. They obviously want to shield the guilty duo.?

 On Tuesday, the cops were passing the buck. Deputy commissioner (reserve force) H.K. Kusumakar claimed that the investigating officers had identified the Reserve Force constables involved in the incident. 

 New Market thana officers refuted the claim. They insisted that the constables were yet to be identified, as Kusumakar had not permitted an identification parade.

 ?We had sent a requisition to the deputy commissioner (reserve force) seeking his permission to produce 11 constables who were on duty that day for an identification parade. But he has not responded,? asserted Hiren Das, officer-in-charge of the police station.

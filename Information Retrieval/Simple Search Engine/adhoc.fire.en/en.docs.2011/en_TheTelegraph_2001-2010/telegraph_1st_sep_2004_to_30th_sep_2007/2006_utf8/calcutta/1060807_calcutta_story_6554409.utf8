The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Sharp tilt for greener fuel

 - LPG CONVERSIONS UP

 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE

 Cheering news for the green brigade. What hectic lobbying and intense campaigning had failed to achieve, the emergent price matrix has. A sharp rise in petrol prices and a cut in the cost of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) have owners of cars and autorickshaws making a beeline for a switch to the greener fuel.

 A litre of petrol now costs Rs 52.62 (premium), just double the price of auto LPG, priced at Rs 26.22 a cylinder, down from Rs 30. Most of the 45 LPG fitment centres in the city, waiting for customers even two months ago, are now doing brisk business.

 Earlier, 70 to 80 vehicles used to come at our centre every month for fitting LPG kits, said Jaswant Khara, owner of Euro-II Services, in south Calcutta. But the situation has changed radically since June. In July alone, we have fitted LPG kits in 300 cars and 100 three-wheelers.

 The turnout at Diya Automobiles, on Bangur Avenue, has doubled from 20 to 25 cars over the past month. The scene is the same at Bhutan Auto Centre in Bhowanipore, Car Kits in Salt Lake and Green Fuel Centre in Sinthee.

 The reason for the spurt in conversion, Khanra believes, is not environment, but economics. The green fuel is cheaper than even diesel, he added.

 Agrees D.K. De, a physician who converted his Maruti Esteem to LPG a month ago. Rs 52.62 a litre is too much. Even after spending Rs 20,000 on the kits, I will gain as LPG is available at half the price of petrol.

 A transport department official said: Around 2,000 three-wheelers and 3,500 cars have converted to LPG till now, half of them in the past 45 days.

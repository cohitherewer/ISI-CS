 A Metro report (Motorist at risk on fixed roads, June 12) on the dangers posed by roads repaired recently has prompted the civic body and state government agencies to set things right.

 The new mastic asphalt top coat on some of the stretches were becoming slippery after a shower, leading to mishaps, while on some other roads ditches dug for repairs but not filled were catching drivers off guard.

 Here?s what the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners (HRBC) and the public works department (PWD) are busy doing:

 Near St Georges? 

 Gate, beside Jubilee Lines Army Quarters, off Vidyasagar 

 Setu

 Following the PWD?s instructions, the contractor is re-laying the mastic asphalt top coat on three stretches of the road. The surface has already been dug. The surface will be dug three-ft deep. Then, a mix of bitumen and limestone dust, heated to 170 degrees Celsius, will be laid. Finally, the stone chips will be embedded 16 mm deep. This procedure, officials say, was not followed properly the first time.

 ?On Wednesday afternoon, a Matador skidded and hit a lamp post. We have lost count of the number of vehicles that have skidded on the road. It?s good that the stretch is being relaid,? said a Vidyasagar Setu Traffic Guard officer.

 Cossipore police station

 The CMC contractor had dug a ditch here and left it uncovered. On May 11, 36-year-old Someshwar Mukhia died when the driver of a van lost control after failing to negotiate the crater.

 ?The contractor?s men turned up recently and filled the crater. But they have dug up a portion on the eastern flank of BT Road and are yet to fill it up,? said an officer of Shyambazar Traffic Guard.

 APC Road, near 

 Moulali

 The contractor appointed by the HRBC had dug up the road for concretisation of tram tracks, but stopped the work, saying that the government agency had not given them a ?proper plan?.

 ?The HRBC officials visited the spot and cleared the tram tracks recast plan. Work has resumed and this time, going by the rate of progress, the tram tracks will be concretised by the first week of July,? said a Sealdah Traffic Guard officer.

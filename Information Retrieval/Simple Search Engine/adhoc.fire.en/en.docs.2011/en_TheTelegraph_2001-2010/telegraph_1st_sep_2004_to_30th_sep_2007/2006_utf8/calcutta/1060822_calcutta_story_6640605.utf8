 The Heroes Project, the largest non-governmental public service campaign in India, and STAR India have announced a two-year extension of the HIV/AIDS stigma reduction and prevention campaign. Launched in 2004, the Heroes Project has been instrumental in mainstreaming HIV/AIDS messaging in the country.

 The extension of the campaign through 2009 will provide the Project with $ 9.26 million worth of airtime bringing STAR Indias five-year commitment to a total of $23.16 million. The announcement was made at the XVI International AIDS Conference. 

 Richard Gere, co-chair of the Heroes Project, said: Our partnership with STAR demonstrates the strength of collaboration and the distinct leadership role media can play in dismantling stigma associated with HIV/AIDS. We are honoured that STAR has supported us in creating a great model of guidance. This model also puts us in a position to directly alter the impact of the disease in Asia.

 Peter Mukerjea, CEO, STAR Group India, said: Our partnership with the Heroes Project has been a fulfilling experience. We are extremely happy with our extended involvement and believe it will not only strengthen the campaign but will ultimately allow us to send HIV/AIDS messaging to a broader audience more effectively. 

 Brand Bollywood has now landed up on college campuses. St Xaviers Colleges Malhar, one of the most popular youth festivals in the country, had a stall to help guys who feel cornered in their relationship with todays aggressive and confident girls. Well, the theme was thanks to a tie-up with the forthcoming Rahul Bose-Mallika Sherawat movie Pyaar Ke Side Effects.

 In the Saket Chaudhury film produced by Pritish Nandy, Rahuls character is in a fix when long-time girlfriend, played by Mallika, wants to marry him. The Malhar stall even had a qualified counsellor in Dr Jyoti Dhabolkar giving tips and in-depth consultation to men about coping with this new breed of women.

 As many as 87 boys and 15 couples came to the stall and sought counsel. The results went something like this: 50 per cent of the boys are wary of being rejected and dont want to propose; they would rather wait for girls to make the first move!

 Forty per cent of the men said that women are materialistic and switch partners for a more successful or a richer guy. And they have no qualms in letting the men know that if they were doing better they could come back later.

 Also, more than 35 per cent of the boys felt that they feel very lonely in relationships as their girls dont spend enough time with them. They preferred to do their own thing and the boys needed to tag along with them.

 Mans world, eh?

 It has taken its time but the George Clooney-starrer Syriana is finally coming to the city screens this Friday. The multiple award-winning geopolitical thriller, written and directed by Stephen Gaghan, focuses on the influence of the oil industry, whose political, economic, legal, and social effects are experienced by a CIA operative (Clooney), among others.

 Clooney not only came up with a performance in Syriana that won him the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor but he was also one of the films executive producers.

 Meanwhile, Clooney along with Justin Timberlake and David Beckham have been chosen as the worlds best-dressed men, according to a new poll.

 The actor has also bought himself two new electric cars. A Tesla Roadster and a Tango will keep the actor-director from being late for his busy schedules.

 The Good Night, and Good Luck director has also found an alternative profession if he gives up movies. He is being urged to market his homemade tomato sauce by his celebrity pals who have had a taste of it at his Italian home! Cook Clooney often rustles up pasta treats for guests staying over at his Lake Como home, and now friend and music mogul Quincy Jones is calling for Clooney to put the paste on store shelves.

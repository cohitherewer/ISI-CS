The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Helpless but hopeful cops

 Top cop Prasun Mukherjee: A will to change

 Who can curb the rally raj in the city centre? Not the police, for sure.

 The day after a few thousand Congress supporters held the city centre to ransom with a rally at an illegal site, police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee admitted that his force was helpless in tackling the menace. 

 A change for the better, he pointed out, is possible only if there is ?a popular demand? for it.

 ?How many political parties ? or organisations ? think about the interest of the masses when they call meetings at Metro Channel? As rallies are held almost every day, it?s the traffic that suffers the most, bang in the heart of the city. But no one seems to care. You can?t hold police responsible for everything happening around us. There has to be a will to bring about a change,? he told Metro on Wednesday.

 Metro Channel, over the past few days, has never breathed easy. From the Pradesh Mahila Congress to medical representatives ? it?s just taken a handful or a few hundred to gather at this stretch of JL Nehru Road and throw traffic out of gear.

 And a repeat is feared on Thursday afternoon, as an ultra-Left outfit has called a rally on Rani Rashmoni Avenue.

 ?Earlier, public meetings were allowed at Esplanade East, which could accommodate a huge crowd. A rally there would keep the arteries free. But that is not possible now because of the high court ban on rallies. So, what do we do?? asked Mukherjee.

 Is there really no way out? ?Let?s not talk like that?But the problem can?t be solved by police alone,? Mukherjee said.

 For police, a major problem is the reluctance of political parties and other organisations to stage demonstrations at a site other than Metro Channel, say the Shahid Minar Grounds. ?They know they will lose out on publicity if they demonstrate at other sites,? said a senior officer.

 Mukherjee pointed out that Tuesday?s car crawl could have been avoided if the Youth Congress had called its rally at some other spot.

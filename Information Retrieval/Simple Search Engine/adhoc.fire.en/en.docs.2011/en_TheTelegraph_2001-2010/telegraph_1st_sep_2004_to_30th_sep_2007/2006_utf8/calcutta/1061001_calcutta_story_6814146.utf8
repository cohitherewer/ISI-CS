The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Other side of midnight

 CITY 

 LIGHTS

 My favourite activity when at 

 home in London is to spend all night listening to utterly 

 weird music in Londons best techno club, Fabric. When the 

 club closes at around 7 am on Sunday, I embark on my second 

 favourite London activity, having a Fry Up (two fried eggs, 

 two sausages, two pieces of bacon, fried bread, chips and 

 a load of tasteless instant coffee) at the local 24-hour 

 breakfast address, Tinseltown. Apart from family and friends, 

 this routine is the only thing I really miss about 

 being out in Calcutta, with the 24-hour nature of London 

 being one of the main attractions in possibly the most overpriced 

 city in the world.

 The 24-hour culture does exist 

 in a vague sense in Calcutta, but only really within the 

 realms of the five-star hotels. For instance, Atrium is 

 the only place around Park Street where you can get a meal 

 at any time of day. Further south in Ballygunge, an all-night 

 drive-through of sorts exists in the form of Azad Hind Dhaba, 

 where one can get a late night Chicken Tikka Kebab. That 

 is the exception, rather than the rule. For such a vivacious 

 city during the day, Calcutta really does take on an almost 

 funereal atmosphere during the small hours.

 Which is why I was rather pleased 

 to have come across a rather positive development in Calcuttas 

 nightlife during Durga puja; for one weekend only, a 24-hour 

 Flurys (picture by Pradip Sanyal). Known as a purveyor 

 of excellent croissants, good lunches, decent tea and slow 

 service, Flurys was open throughout the three main Puja 

 days. I shambled down Park Street after a pretty heavy date 

 with Miss Kingfisher at Roxy on Friday night to see Flurys 

 very much alive on the wrong side of midnight. To my astonishment, 

 it did look possible that I would, after nearly 10 months, 

 be able to have a cardiac-arrest-inducing breakfast at an 

 uncivilised time of the day!

 Drawn by the lights and action, 

 I collared Flurys team leader Saikat Bose and interrogated 

 the poor man about this development at the Calcutta landmark. 

 Im afraid that this is only for the Puja, we did it last 

 year and it was a great success, so we are doing the same 

 again this year. Saturdays and Sundays will be our busiest 

 days, and well be expecting roughly 500 to 600 people visiting 

 the restaurant during the early hours. 

 I asked if he thought that the 

 24-hour culture could take off on a grand scale anytime 

 soon. Oh, yes! he replied optimistically, I think it 

 would be excellent for businesses, and it would bring an 

 extra dimension to the city.

 I couldnt agree more.

 A few kilometres off the city, 

 on Diamond Harbour Road, is Nature Cure amp; Yoga Research 

 Institute, a wellness centre surrounded by nature ? large 

 waterbodies, ducks wading through, greenery all around and 

 cooing love birds (the feathered variety). With this serenity 

 as the backdrop, the centre teaches naturopathy ? the art 

 that strengthens the body to heal itself without medication. 

 The institute set up in 1962 was 

 remodelled in 1984 and there have been more facelifts since 

 2004. A pleasant surrounding always speeds up a healing 

 process. We want to provide facilities at par with any reputed 

 naturopathy centre, says secretary Sunil V. Khaitan. 

 The total renovation should 

 cost around Rs 2.5 crore. Rs 90 lakh has been spent. The 

 next phase requires expenditure around Rs 50 lakh, 

 adds Sunil.

 A unit of the Nature Cure amp; 

 Yoga Research Institute trust, the centre has three resident 

 doctors. There is a senior naturopathy consultant and an 

 Ayurveda consultant. Says Nagendra K. Neeraj, the senior 

 naturopathy consultant: Naturopathy is a process of 

 nature, a self-curative force that helps cure diseases. 

 Ailments are the after effects of wrong thinking, wrong 

 eating and wrong living. 

 He adds: Here our therapies 

 and treatments activate the auto-healing and monitoring 

 system within our body. Yoga, diet or a therapy prescribed 

 to a patient depends on the kind and the spread of the disease.

 The look

 Spread over nine acres of land, 

 the centre is one green stretch. On the right are the doctors 

 chambers, administrative offices, the Ayurveda centre, recreation 

 room, a physiotherapy centre and the hall where evening 

 yoga sessions take place. A few yards away is the recently 

 renovated dining area overlooking a large pond and acres 

 of green. 

 On the left is the new state-of-the-art 

 gymnasium and spa. 

 The rooms adjacent have been given 

 a makeover, very swank. Currently our accommodation 

 capacity is 43. We are increasing it by 16. More should 

 be added, says Sunil. Room charges for single occupancy 

 cost between Rs 450 and Rs 3,000 per day. 

 The colour code of peach and chocolate 

 brown in the rooms brings the feeling of warmth. Special 

 air-conditioned suites with two bedrooms have a common sitting 

 area and a verandah. There is provision for a special therapy 

 cubicle for paralytic and disabled patients. Also available 

 are single air-conditioned cottages. The spacious washrooms 

 with sleek fittings gleam class. There are non-airconditioned 

 economy rooms, too.

 Further ahead is the treatment 

 centre, a Radha-Krishna mandir and orchards where 

 banana and lime are grown. Adjacent is the open yoga hall. 

 Seasonal vegetable and herbal plants like neem and tulsi 

 are also grown at the centre.

 Cure with care

 Treatments take place through 

 hydrotherapy, mud therapy and sun therapy. These help 

 activate your healing powers within, says Neeraj. 

 There are different treatment 

 centres for men and women, more than 2,000 sq ft each. Talks 

 are on for a new womens treatment centre that would 

 spread over 5,000 sq ft. Treatments on offer are Detoxification, 

 Health Rejuvenation, Health Care, Ever Slim, Nature Cure 

 and Yoga Therapy and De-addiction packages. 

 The duration of the treatments 

 differs. While Detoxification is a three-day package, Ever 

 Slim is a 15-day package. 

 Gastro-intestinal, allergy, sinusitis, 

 epilepsy, eczema, rheumatism, hypertension, myopia, alcohol 

 addiction, obesity? the centre promises to cure all. A spinal 

 spray treatment stimulates the nervous system, regulates 

 blood pressure and metabolism and strengthens the spinal 

 cord and muscles. This is helpful for ailments like high 

 blood pressure, menstrual disorders and bronchial asthma.

 A few yards away is a mud pool 

 spreading over almost 700 sq ft. The mud therapy cleanses 

 skin tissue, relieves mental stress and balances blood pressure, 

 Neeraj adds. 

 For the Ayurveda corner, the centre 

 has a joint venture with Arya Vaidya Pharmacy (Coimbatore) 

 Ltd. Special treatments include Abhyangam, Dhara, Pizhichil 

 and Udvartanam. 

 Next in line is rhythmic therapy 

 where dance movements will be incorporated into exercises.

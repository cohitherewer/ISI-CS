 Citu behind poster protest 

 Indrajit Bose: Most people visit the zoo for pure joy. But at the moment, they are greeted with posters put up by trade unions, which is extremely disturbing. Can?t these posters be pulled down?

 The posters the visitors see near the entrance have been put up by the members of Alipore Chiriakhana Mazdoor Karmachari Union, which is affiliated to Citu, the labour wing of the CPM. They have been there since November 23, 2005, and refer to an alleged incident of sexual harassment. But till date, no woman has lodged a complaint against the alleged perpetrator. There is a management committee to look after the functioning of the zoo and they are aware of the situation. I hope they take the necessary steps.

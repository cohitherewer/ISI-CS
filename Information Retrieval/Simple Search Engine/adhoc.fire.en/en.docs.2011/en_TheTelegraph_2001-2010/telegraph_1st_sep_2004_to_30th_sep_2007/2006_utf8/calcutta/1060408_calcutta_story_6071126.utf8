 Not to be outdone by their male counterparts at the Round Table, the Calcutta branch of Ladies Circle India has been hard at work promoting education and social welfare projects of its own. 

 One of the organisation?s current nationwide projects, in association with Parryware, is the installation of toilet blocks in areas where children and women don?t have access to adequate facilities. 

 The first one to be opened was in Kalighat?s ward 83 on April 7, one of the oldest red-light areas in Calcutta. 

 Alka Poddar, national president of Ladies Circle India, said: ?I visited this area two years ago, and women and children were just bathing on the street. Now, with the new toilet block, we can afford them privacy and better facilities. It is great to see the difference that it will make to people?s lives.?

 The recipient of the new block was New Light, a non-profit trust that provides a night shelter and creche as well as education for kids who are considered to be at risk, particularly the children of sex workers.

 The sanitary works programme across the country is one of many schemes that Ladies Circle India has been involved in of late. 

 ?Supporting primary education projects is one of our top priorities. We want to educate to enlighten. We are also addressing health issues like HIV/AIDS and basic hygiene, as well as contributing towards setting up of kitchens. We are involved in a wide range of social issues,? added Poddar. 

 Ladies Circle India enjoyed the support of actress June at the inauguration of the toilet block. ?I have supported Ladies Circle?s projects for quite some time, and I think projects such as these are valuable because women and children are always the real victims in situations like these,? she said.

 June added: ?I have been trying to rope in some of my colleagues to participate, and I?ve been very disappointed at the lack of involvement. I hope my association will help to promote such causes. ?

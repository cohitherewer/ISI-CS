 Life term for soiree killing

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Gangster Dilip Banerjee, alias Hatkata Dilip, and three of his accomplices have been sentenced to life imprisonment for murdering two persons at a soiree in Nayapatti, Salt Lake, two years ago.

 Minutes before the verdict was read out on Wednesday, high drama unfolded in the packed courtroom as public prosecutor Amal Chatterjee, also chairman of CPM-led Garulia Municipality, pleaded with additional judicial magistrate, Barrackpore, Divyajyoti De to spare the convicts the death sentence.

 He argued that the Nayapatti murders could not be treated as the rarest of rare.

 Even the widow of one of the victims, Anil Pramanik, claimed that Dilip and his associates were not responsible for the twin murders.

 You are passing the judgment without caring about our security. The original criminal, Tarun Naskar, is still at large, Alpana Pramanik cried out at the judge.

 Naskar, secretary of a local committee of the DYFI (CPMs youth wing), was a witness in the case and had identified Dilip in the court as the killer.

 The court last week had convicted Dilip, Saheb Mondal, Raju Biswas and Anup Mondal of murdering Pramanik and Mithu Seikh on June 27, 2004.

 Before delivering the sentence, the judge gave an opportunity to the convicts to defend themselves. All four claimed they were innocent.

 Dilip alleged Naskar had fired the bullets. I had gone there to watch the programme. I had even paid a hefty donation to the organisers, he said.

 Later, he told journalists that police had framed him, though he did not deny his underworld links.

What: Launch of jewellery designer Nirmal Zaveris 

exclusive signature line from the house of TBZ.

 Where: The refurbished Trendsmith flagship store at 8/2, Loudon Street.

 When: May 15.

 The collection: The new display at the store caters to those for whom jewellery is an extension of their personality. Zaveris signature line is a versatile one that includes both traditional and contemporary designs in gold and diamond and also those with a fine mix of both. 

 While the contemporary line includes simple everyday pieces in rings, pendants and earrings, it is the heavy jewellery that really catches the eye.

 The bridal collection comprises neckpieces with long cascading pendants, chandelier earrings, chokers, cocktail rings, chunky bracelets set in diamonds and coloured stones.

 What makes Zaveris jewellery line stand out is that they are crafted with some of the finest gems, coloured stones, full-cut and rose-cut diamonds.

 Apart from the jewellery, also available at the store will be a range of exquisite silverware lifestyle products called Shaze, conceived and designed by Shalini Zaveri.

 Pocket pinch: Prices start at Rs 10,000 for a small pendant and go up to Rs 50 lakh for the heavy variety.

 Voiceover: Previously, our store stocked jewellery by a large number of designers. But our customers wanted something exclusive from the house of Zaveri. So, we decided to change the entire concept of the store by stocking only designs by Nirmal Zaveri? The jewellery on offer here caters to every woman, be it the working girl or the traditional bride, smiles Ranjita Singh, store manager.

 Word power

 What: Launch and reading of Shomshukllas debut volume of poems, I Have Seen That Face Before.

 Where: Oxford Bookstore.

 When: Monday, 6.30 pm.

 Tuning in: Author Amit Chaudhuri introduced the book to the gathering before Shomshuklla went on to read out several short poems from it, interspersed with personal anecdotes.

 Talk about music hogged the limelight at the reading. And there was reason for a double celebration with Amit Chaudhuri celebrating his birthday. Usha Uthup took the lead in singing a birthday song for him while June, Shilajit and Shomshuklla hummed along. 

 Usha Uthup insisted on setting some of the poems to tune, till finally the poetess relented and requested her to do the honours. Also spotted were artist Shuvaprasanna and actor Tota Roy Chowdhury.

 Voiceover: At first glance, they are poems of deceptive simplicity. What I found interesting was the sudden incursion of the personal self in its unguarded moments, said Amit Chaudhuri.

 Craft cause

 What: Inauguration of Summer Bazaar, an exhibition of handicrafts of Bengal.

 Where: 79, Raja Basanta Roy Road.

 When: Monday, 5.30 pm. The exhibition is on till May 25, between 2 pm and 8 pm.

 so on display are paper masks, candles, hand-painted T-shirts, cloth bags and handcrafted ethnic jewellery. A few young artistes have bagged the opportunity to trot out their creations at the event.

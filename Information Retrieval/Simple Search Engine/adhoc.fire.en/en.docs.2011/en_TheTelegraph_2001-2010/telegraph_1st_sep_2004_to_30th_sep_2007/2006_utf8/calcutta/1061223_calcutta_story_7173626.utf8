 Make trip, save marriage

 - Division bench sends couple in spat to Tirupati for a month

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 What does it take to call a truce in the war of the roses? A trip to Tirupati, says Calcutta High Court.

 The travel plan to salvage a marriage came from the division bench of Justice A.K. Talukdar and Justice R.N. Banerjee on Friday. The couple in question Gaurang and Neha Ganeriwala has been advised to go to Tirupati and stay together for a month.

 While passing the order, the court observed that its earlier efforts to unite warring couples by sending them out of town for a while (see box) had proved successful and hoped it would work for Neha and Gaurang as well. Sources said seven of 10 such couples had come back to court and said they were living happily together again.

 The division bench directed Neha, a fashion designer, and Gaurang, a businessman, to return on February 11, 2007, and report the experiences of their Tirupati holiday.

 Gaurang, a resident of Moira Street, married Neha, a resident of central Calcutta, on May 1, 2004. According to the prosecution, the relationship soon soured. Neha left her in-laws on December 1, 2006, and returned to her parents. On December 10, she went to Shakespeare Sarani police station and lodged a complaint of physical and mental torture against her husband, but the officers there allegedly refused to register a dairy. 

 Neha then approached the chief metropolitan magistrate, who on December 18 asked the Shakespeare Sarani police to probe the allegation and file a report.

 Apprehending arrest, Gaurang moved an anticipatory bail prayer before the city sessions court on December 18, which was rejected. He then moved high court and his case came up on December 21. The division bench asked both husband and wife to appear on Friday. The court then asked them to pack their bags for Tirupati, together.

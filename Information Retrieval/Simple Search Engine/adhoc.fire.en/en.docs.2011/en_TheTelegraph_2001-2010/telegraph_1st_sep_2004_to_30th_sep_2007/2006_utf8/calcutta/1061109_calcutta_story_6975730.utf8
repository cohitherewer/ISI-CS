 Branislov, from Slovakia, says 

 that wherever he goes in the city, he is asked if he is 

 from England.

 All white-skinned people are 

 assumed to be British. They are treated ridiculously well, 

 too, says Branislov, an undergraduate student of political 

 science at Jadavpur University.

 He was speaking at a discussion 

 on a British Council project called I, Me, Myself: Indian 

 or Global? at Bengal Club on Wednesday.

 The project, which began as a 

 debate on Britishness in the UK, is travelling around 

 the world. In India, it led to a discussion of what constitutes 

 Indianness. Which was as vast and problematic as the country 

 itself, but led to the discussion of Indian stereotypes, 

 of Us and Them that refuse to die.

 It could be skin colour. Whites 

 are still worshipped, said a participant, but not all 

 foreigners. People from Africa are not treated so well, 

 says Branislov, who has Africans studying with him.

 Its all about colour, asserted 

 Azmeen Dangri, a young Parsi entrepreneur, who says she 

 is often thought to be a foreigner. 

 But as Santanu Bose, video theatre 

 artiste, pointed out, the worship of the white-skinned may 

 not be unambiguous. We may be saying nice things to him, 

 but to make up for it, we may be saying nasty things in 

 Bengali. He added that Bengali is rich in its underbelly 

 of terms for other Indian communities.

 The marker could be a goatee. 

 Bishan Samaddar, a young NGO worker, said he was questioned 

 by police in Varanasi because he looked like a terrorist. 

 I used to wear a goatee then. I also spoke Hindi with a 

 lot of Urdu.

 I was picked up near a temple 

 by police, who said I looked like a terrorist and asked 

 me to prove I was not a Pakistani. How does one prove that? 

 he asked.

 Sangay Dolma from Sikkim, who 

 defined herself as a second-generation Tibetan, said that 

 she has many friends from the city. But I feel a part of 

 them that doesnt really connect with me because they are 

 from Calcutta and I am from the Northeast, she said. 

 There were other problems about 

 Indian identity. As Ipsita Haldar asked in her presentation 

 on food and identity: Am I emancipated when I drink tequila? 

 Is it liberating to cook spaghetti?

 The sessions were moderated by 

 Pratap Rughani, director, Lotus Films, UK, Vron Ware, a 

 journalist from the UK, and Nilanjana Gupta, who teaches 

 English at Jadavpur University. 

 Its tough being Indian if you 

 think about it.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Refreshing 

 riff rendezvous

 A Bangla band plays 

 at Princeton Club on Friday night. Picture by Rashbehari 

 Das 

 Acoustic strains of Dylan or the 

 Dead, buoyant Brazilian beats or Cuban congas, a mesmerising 

 cover of Dream Theater?s Misunderstood, or simply 

 on self-drive?

 For young musical minds in town 

 dabbling in the different, there?s an alternative rendezvous 

 now, and the riffs needn?t be straight-ahead rock.

 Princeton Club on Prince Anwar 

 Shah Road has turned Friday evenings into an eclectic tune 

 trek across hitherto uncharted terrain.

 ?We want to create a nursery of 

 music, to nurture home-grown talent and give new bands a 

 platform to express themselves without being hamstrung by 

 pre-set parameters,? Pratul Singh Rawat, general manager 

 of the club, tells Metro.

 The capacious sports bar of the 

 sleek south Calcutta club, cooled by the swimming pool perched 

 atop, becomes the concert corridor every Friday night, 9 

 to 11. Besides Princeton members, attendance is by invitation, 

 with feelers going out to the city?s fairly close-knit music 

 circuit through Congo Square?s database.

 ?They have been helping out with 

 the networking and it helps to stitch together a largely 

 like-minded audience whose primary agenda is to let their 

 hair down after a hard week?s slog,? acknowledges Rawat.

 ?Yes, the audience is surely very 

 refined and it helps that we aren?t flooded with requests 

 for popular numbers,? quips Souvik, vocalist of The Hobos, 

 an upcoming outfit that has played its ?progressive experimental? 

 sound at Princeton twice.

 The laid-back ambience has encouraged 

 young ensembles to come up with more original stuff. ?It 

 gives us the freedom to express and experiment without prejudice 

 or fear of non-acceptance,? observes Dwaipayan, who earlier 

 played with Orient Express and Krosswindz at Someplace Else 

 (SPE), the mecca of live rock in the city.

 The frontman of the new group 

 Ganga Groove now takes the stage with his colleagues at 

 the Princeton sports bar offering a spread of Afro-influenced 

 music, hip-hop and blues. The freedom is infectious. Be 

 it Rudraa or Urban Reflections, breaking barriers is the 

 theme song at Princeton.

 ?When we started, we were struggling 

 to get a band for the second week itself. Now, there are 

 so many requests from young groups keen to perform, we have 

 to hold auditions. The idea is not to turn away anybody, 

 but if there are pronounced weaknesses, we would like to 

 help them iron out the flaws under the supervision of some 

 senior musicians,? explains Rawat.

 Kochoo of Orient Express, the 

 country?s ?first and only Latin band? that is a regular 

 at SPE, is one of the musicians helping out the colts. ?This 

 is a commendable project. Once more such avenues open up, 

 more and more talent in this city will get the chance to 

 flower and new grass always looks lush,? he says.

 ?That is exactly our objective. 

 With a few other similar places, hopefully for all those 

 who want to pursue music as a career, fresh avenues will 

 open up,? hopes Rawat. He feels the ?multiplex concept? 

 in live music where one can catch quality entertainment 

 in a smaller niche, will catch on.

 And it sure needs to. When the 

 DJs are making a neat packet by just spinning discs, it?s 

 only fair that aspiring musicians practising hard and with 

 passion should get a chance to showcase their stuff.

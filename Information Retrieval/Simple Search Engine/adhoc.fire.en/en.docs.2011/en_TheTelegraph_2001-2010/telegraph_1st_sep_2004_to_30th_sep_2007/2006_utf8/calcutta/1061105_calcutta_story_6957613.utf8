The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 He who led, now follows

 In an uncharacteristic ad, Sourav 

 trades brand positioning for a fast-evaporating brand salience

 Ad 

 Lib Shiloo 

 Chattopadhyay

 Of all things, Calcutta was suddenly 

 discussing a yet-to-be-released ad on television. But then, 

 it was not just another TV ad. Much before its release, 

 news was out that Pepsi had signed Sourav for its campaign. 

 Addas of the city were agog Aare shon, Pepsir 

 kachhe khobor achhe, na holey oto taka khoroch kore sign 

 korey (Pepsi must be sure of his comeback, otherwise 

 why would they spend so much money)? Then the campaign was 

 released. Every time the ad was aired, most of Calcutta 

 squirmed. Should Sourav have done the ad?

 The ripple touched Adlib as 

 well. It is rare but not unusual to receive a request to 

 write about an ad. The difference was that neither the agency 

 nor the brand was making the request. It was a message from 

 the addas. Initially one resisted as it is at the best of 

 times risky to analyse such issues. Choice of an advertising 

 theme is more often than not based on myriad marketing reasons 

 and complex communication motives. But when the theme involves 

 a fallen star and his attempt to claw back, any marketing 

 student would be wise to remember the famous adage where 

 angels fear to tread... I remembered the adage and still 

 rushed in, possibly to confirm my affiliation to the other 

 breed.

 There are two obvious angles of 

 the story Pepsis and Souravs. What could be the reason 

 for Pepsi to choose Sourav as a protagonist? If Pepsi knew 

 for sure that he was coming back into the team, then it 

 would be a coup. That is an unlikely scenario. There is, 

 however, a strong enough logic for using him even without 

 such a tip. He is the immediate past captain. He was controversially 

 dropped. Such a person making a plea to support a team that 

 has rejected him sure makes a great emotional story and 

 thus a tremendous fit with the Blue Billion theme of the 

 Pepsi campaign.

 Sourav and his billions is a favourite 

 topic for those who do not feel too kindly towards him. 

 Yet, given the same billions that he has already made, it 

 stands to reason that money alone could not have been the 

 only motive for him to do the ad. What else could it be? 

 A reasonable guess would run like this. Cricketwise, Sourav 

 was missing the headlines. This ad would allow him to retain 

 the spotlight and give him some more time to attempt his 

 cricketing comeback. Much as pundits say that his bat should 

 do the talking, public sympathy seldom hurts. That sympathy 

 factor was on the wane and Sourav must have expected the 

 Pepsi ad to rejuvenate it. It could well have been his most 

 important reason to do this ad.

 Where does all this hurt us? The 

 nub lies neither in Pepsis motive nor in Souravs reasoning. 

 It is entirely resident in the way we see Sourav. Calcutta 

 possibly believes that in the ad Sourav is beseeching the 

 viewer to be with him. This soft Sourav is contrary to his 

 image that we cherish. It quarrels with probably the singlemost 

 important reason for Souravs popularity one of us who, 

 unlike any of us, took on the world on equal terms. Arrogance 

 was the core value of his brand. We would have loved it 

 if the Pepsi ad had projected him as one who is fighting 

 for his rightful place, with all his famous aggression.

 Yet, the truth is that such a 

 portrayal would not have fitted into the campaign theme 

 of Pepsi. More importantly, the truth is that Sourav can 

 possibly no longer afford such aggression. In doing this 

 ad, he possibly had to trade his brand positioning for a 

 fast-evaporating brand salience. That truth hurts, more 

 than anything else.

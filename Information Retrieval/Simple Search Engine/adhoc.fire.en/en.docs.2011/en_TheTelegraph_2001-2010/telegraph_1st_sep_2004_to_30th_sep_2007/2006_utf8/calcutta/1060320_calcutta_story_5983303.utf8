 Founded by a number of women artists, The Group carries forward the city?s glorious tradition of art awareness. The Spirit of Togetherness, the ongoing exhibition of their paintings, bears testimony to their persistent energy, vision and desire to create and reinvent themselves. The works on display are mostly typical of each artist. Shyamasree Basu reaches out with her commitment to social issues. Dr Anjali Sengupta remains rooted in mythological tribal magic. Sudeshna Das is a master of graphic design, evident from her floral and close-up face forms. While Ballari Mukherjee assimilates her intense feelings into her abstract canvases, Arati Das? paintings convey her thoughts in the shape of a figurative design. Anita Dutta?s sober colour compositions are dressed up in a stylised manner unlike Tapati Mukhopadhyay?s simple expositions that reveal a strong sense of the symbolic. The works of Minati Nath and Madhusree Muchhal (one of her paintings appears left) are purely emblematic, while Rina Mustaffi?s and Swagata Bose?s inward journeys are reflected in their abstract canvases.

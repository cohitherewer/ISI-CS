 LIFESTYLE ZONE 

 ANUMITA GHOSH

 On the fifth floor of Akashdeep Building at 5, Lower Rawdon Street is a lifestyle store that offers stylish solutions for home interiors. Shikara, a joint venture by Vijayanti Rana and Nayana Bhattacharya, features a wide range of sofa set pieces, modular kitchens and other decor necessities.

 The tastefully done up interiors welcome you as you enter this 1,800 sq ft swank showroom. Our collection is meant to suit the needs of modern flats where space saving is a major concern, says Nayana.

 While she looks after the design aspect of the furniture, Vijayanti handles administration. 

 I started with kitchen designing five years back. Once Vijayanti joined in, we started looking at other aspects too , smiles Nayana, who boasts an interior designing degree from the UK. 

 SOFA SEE

 The sofa sets imported from Malaysia are a classic blend of style and utility. From four seaters to 10 seaters, there are varieties to suit all kinds of space. 

 Each sofa set along with a co-ordinated centre table is displayed beautifully against colourful backdrops, some with etched walls and pretty curtains, to give the buyer an idea about the whole arrangement.

 Four seaters with steel legs and leather upholstery in jet black look smart. The pairs are joined together with clips and can be separated when required. 

 You can combine it with a low squarish centre table in white. Steel and leather are no longer restricted to the commercial field. They look equally trendy at home, too, points out Nayana.

 Then there are sofa-cum-beds where the backrest when lowered forms a comfortable single bed. You find them in hues of blue, red, wine and lemon yellow, with broad striped edges. 

 An L-shaped sofa set in white leather and red fabric cushions catches the eye. Seaters in combinations of wood and olive green fabric upholstery look stunning. You can team them up with dark chocolate showcases. 

 Theres a set of three Scandinavian stools in wood that can adorn the corners of your living room.

 The furniture requires very low maintenance. With sleek designs, dust is easily removed and the fabric and leather are easily washable, says Nayana. 

 The price tag reads anything between Rs 16,000 and Rs 65,000.

 COOL KITCHEN

 The kitchen occupies an important place in any home interiors since a major part of the household activity happens here. Our modular kitchens look at creating well-organised and stylish spaces, smiles Nayana. 

 The kitchens, too, are displayed in a realistic way so as to enable the customer to replicate the arrangement at home. A wall fitted with kitchen appliances and gadgets displays a layout for a tiny kitchen space. Interesting colour schemes, tiles with jug embellishments, easy to handle steel pull-out cabinets, glass cabinets here and there and a pine wood finish that accentuates the look further ? the choice for a complete kitchen makeover is varied. Prices begin at Rs 25,000.

 SHOW STUFF 

 The store also makes designer bedrooms to order. Etched glass, metal beads and dried flowers embellish the highly innovative beds. The beds are very creative, but we never over do the decoration, stresses Nayana. The wardrobes and flooring are in sync with the bed. 

 so on offer are shoe racks with drawers. Showpieces like wooden Buddha wall-hangs, pitcher-shaped vases with geometric patterns and interesting lampshades are worth a look. These are priced between Rs 1,000 and Rs 9,000.

 Being close to Rabindranath Tagore, a part of the circle of his students at Santiniketan, is something Rama Chakravarty still can?t get over. ?Few people realise what Tagore was like in real life, how caring and humble this great man was,? she says. 

 She has written two books ? Bhora Thak Smriti Sudha and Pothey Jetey Jetey ? but there are obviously many more tales to tell. Her felicitation, organised by Rabichhaya at Birla Academy of Art and Culture on June 27, will give her an opportunity to share stories.

 At 93, Chakravarty is one of the few remaining people who received personal guidance from Rabindranath Tagore and Nandalal Bose. Sitting in her Purna Das Road home, she talks about her treasures ? a Tagore lyric in his own script, many letters and a sketch Nandalal Bose made of her during an excursion to Rajgir.

 The memories are equally precious, like that of the solo dance the bard encouraged her to perform in Nabin. ?I didn?t want to dance because I was more inclined to singing. Gurudev insisted that I dance to Mori haye chole jaaye basanteri din. When I couldn?t pick up the steps that Dinda (Dinendranath Tagore) taught me, Rabindranath himself helped me with the movements,? recounts Chakravarty.

 In those days, Basanta Utsab was held near Singha Sadan, with the audience sitting on the ground and the balcony of the library serving as the stage. Students often visited Tagore at Uttarayan but travelling to Calcutta with him and staying at Jorasanko was special.

 ?To travel with Gurudev was itself an honour. Add to that the thrill of living in Thakurbari. We shared a room close to Gurudev?s little one on the first floor. Everything was just perfect at Jorasanko, even the paan we were given after each meal,? says Chakravarty about her visit to the city with the other performers of Nabin.

 ?That was the first time a stage was built and used at New Empire. There were no green rooms and we had to wear our costumes at home and travel to the hall in a covered sedan,? she adds.

 Memories of the long walks with Nandalal Bose and even the rehearsals for the dance drama are etched in her mind. ?We thought Dinda would always be there, so we would never need notations,? remarks Chakravarty, between anecdotes of ashram chores like cooking, sewing and taking care of guests.

 The notes struck by Dinda and Masoji (Vinayak Rao) on a giant esraj still resound in the nonagenarian?s ears. In comparison, modern instruments seem mere mechanical contraptions. But her return to Santiniketan in 1939 was sad. 

 ?I was married then and had put up with my friend Amita. One morning, Bonomali came to usher us to Gurudev?s bedside. Saying that he missed me, Gurudev asked me to stay on in Santiniketan, which I did for a month. That was when he taught Amita and me the new song he had written. I still have the lyrics of Jodi hai jibono purano nahi holo in his handwriting,? recalls Chakravarty.

 Experiments with Tagore?s music or the ?strange, unsightly presentations of most of his dance dramas? don?t worry her. ?Nothing can touch his greatness,? asserts this founder of Santiniketan Puratani.

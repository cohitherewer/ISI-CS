 The cast of Naya Office Office

 Tired of watching those re-runs of your favourite episodes of Office Office? Well, a brand new series simply titled Naya Office Office is all set to get underway this Friday, on STAR One at 8.30 pm.

 With the new season will come new problems. From rising fuel prices to corruption at BMC, Naya Office Office will tackle the most topical of topics in its inimitable way. The backdrop will now shift from the traditional sarkari office environment to the more contemporary setting we are used to these days. 

 Back with the show are the most loved characters of Mussadilal, Mr Bhatia, Mr Pandey, Mr Shukla, Mrs Usha and Mr Patel. The show continues to revolve around these true-to-life characters and the problems they face ? from ration line to electricity bills, from insurance policies to telephone exchanges.

 The original star cast largely remains the same, headed by Pankaj Kapoor, of course. There?s also Manoj Pahwa, Hemant Pandey, Sanjay Mishra and Asavari Joshi. Only Deven Bhojani will be replaced by funnyman Vrijesh Hirjee as Mr Patel.

 And Vrijesh is up to the challenge. Speaking to Metro, the man known best for his role as Hrithik?s best friend in Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai, said: ?I am already in tune, having shot for more than 15 episodes. Having worked with all these actors at some point in my life, striking up a chemistry was no problem. I am sure everyone?s going to love this new avatar, as they will immediately connect with the fresh issues we tackle on the show.?

 Announcing the launch of Naya Office Office, Shailja Kejriwal, senior creative director of STAR India, said: ?We are very pleased to have this hugely-popular show in our bouquet. Our success with comedy continues and once again we?ve looked at fresh concepts that we believe will appeal to our viewers. In its previous avatar, the show has won many hearts and many accolades and we are confident of continued success with Naya Office Office. STAR One?s march to the number two position will be strengthened with a show of this calibre.?

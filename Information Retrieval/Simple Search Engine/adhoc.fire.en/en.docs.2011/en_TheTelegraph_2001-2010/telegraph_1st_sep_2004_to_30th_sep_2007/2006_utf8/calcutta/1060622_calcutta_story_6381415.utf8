 VICTOR BANERJEE DISCOVERS THE WONDERS OF THE COLOUR, FROM BANGKOK TO BRAZIL 

 Yellow. It takes a funny day in Bangkok to reveal the wonders of that colour.

 As a child growing up in the countryside, yellow was essentially the colour of cute chicks, ducklings and goslings. In boarding school, it represented diarrhoea, either brought on by an overindulgence in raw pears we robbed from the trees that surrounded our tennis courts or the result of our Swiss nurse Sister Victorias strong dose of Epsom salts that also had some of us puking all over the place, at the beginning of every month. All said and done, it was quicker and less complicated than the Gandhian douche that our Mahatma apparently subjected his poor colon to with irritating regularity.

 Those were the days of the Lone Ranger and Tonto and their fight to protect yellow-bellied ranchers from cattle hustlers. And in a school where rugged Northeastern tribals dominated the playing fields, only the lily-livered, yeller, mamas suckling boys, afraid of being kicked in the shin or cracked across the face with a hockey stick, chose to pad up like dandies and play cricket. 

 most half-a-century after we left school, at the last old boys meet we had in Shillong this past winter, I discovered the only house colour that was missing from the old rivals Brien, McGee, McCann, Roe and Leary, was Learys: its colour used to be yellow.

 In school, the bright geeks got gold cards and were allowed to go to town on a Sunday to watch a movie. The bad card was yellow that made you suffer detention and humiliation. Slowly the geeks minds were irretrievably corrupted and in life they disappeared into academic and even corporate oblivion while those forced to suffer and sweat over an insoluble Pythagorean riddle earned fortunes heading giant corporations and even working in films.

 The Aussies, inspired by the late Kerry Packer, resuscitated a sport from its dying throes and went on to become champions in yellow.

 And their Rugger team has survived rather well in the same colour amidst the prowling green of the Springboks and the devastating black of the Kiwis.

 While the yellow ball in a game of slosh has the least number of points, and the only yellow team ever, that I can remember entering F1, Jordan, disappeared very fast down the pit lane forever, while at the other end of the racing world Lance Armstrongs yellow jersey is the most coveted award in the Tour de France.

 And, finally, who will dispute that the world is worshipping the yellows from South America as Brazil weaves its irrepressible magic in Germany?

 One of the most dangerous vehicles on the roads is a yellow cab and the most endangered is the yellow school bus. Just about everybody I know drives through a yellow light, legitimately of course, and yet, when cities around the world go to sleep, it is that same stupid yellow light that blinks on and off all night, through the night, in ignorable and ambiguous authority.

 Nearer the bone, a yellow race embarrassed us on the battlefield in 1962 and is thrashing us in our race to become the undisputed King of tomorrows economic world.

 Cunningly, our chess and draughts boards for centuries had black and yellow squares and it cannot be anything besides ingratiating racism that forced us to call the pieces white.

 So what, might you rightly ask, has brought on this writers sudden preoccupation with yellow? Well, the other day, it was nothing short of panic in Bangkok where stocks of yellow shirts and tops were fast running out and, in a city famous for incredible bargains in hosiery goods, yellow tops were going at a premium.

 My cab driver explained it quite simply. Thomolow King 60 yeer. I nodded knowingly because I had read hoardings that proclaimed 60 years of His Majestys reign in Thailand. Ouar King bery great man. Best. Best in whole world. I nodded once again. You got King in India? I told him we didnt and I wasnt about to mess around trying to explain our saral democracy that deifies one day, trashes the next only to exalt it to royalty the following day again, to confuse and confound and cause deep concern.

 After all, what would a cab driver living in a constitutional monarchy know about parliamentary democracy in a world where even the great Americans were turning blue in exasperation, literally fighting to explain it to Iraqis, Afghanis, Syrians, North Koreans and increasing numbers in the South, the Chinese and even their ally the Saudis?

 He lub ebrybody. He do good por ebrybody. You unstand? You rich, you poor, no mattah. King lub ebrybody. Uddha cuntry hab bad peepol. Dey no like, no lub peepol, only (and he slid his thumb dextrously over middle and index fingers) mony. No care por peepol only (rub-rub-rub).

 oody hell. Amartya Sen was crowned belatedly for saying exactly that. In a feudal system there were never famines. No one starved to death. The King was bound to look after his subjects. They had social security like no democracy, certainly not ours, can ever promise to provide.

 Well, anyway, to get back to the point, on June 9, I wandered around Bangkok looking at thousands of people from all walks of life; toddlers to grandparents, trendy teenagers to corporate big shots, almost everyone in the streets, in buses, in cars, in taxis, in limos and gay little tuk-tuks and even in boats along canals, almost every man, woman and child was wearing a yellow shirt, with the Royal Crest embossed on it, to celebrate and commemorate the Kings 60th year of peaceful reign.

 A completely voluntary act, by every citizen, that certainly cost the shirts on their backs; for which no one got any kudos, nobody won Brownie points with superiors or school teachers, got no promotions at work and, funnily enough, you got no dirty looks or righteous indignation if you were wearing blue, like I was.

 I know that Americans wear and display their national flag more proudly than citizens of any other nation in the world, but the loving admiration and loyalty of a people to their monarch as I saw in Thailand is something I will remember every time I see reds, saffrons, greens and stupid symbols of artistic and aesthetic disgrace painted on walls, festoons and posters, thrust down our throats even though we hate the colours and flavours of them all, without exception, and are choking on them, in free India.

 Which brings me to the end of this piece and our celebration of Saraswati Puja in Bengal. Do you think the reason why fewer girls and ladies wear yellow these days in what was a very old tradition for Basanta Panchami, is because men have traditionally refused to wear yellow trousers and dhotis on that day?

 I am beginning to realise why Brazil, the all-time favourites, still loses by a hairs breadth, more often than they win.

 Like the poor mixed up fool that I am, strutting and fretting around aimlessly on my abandoned stage, entangled in colourless flammable celluloid, I had best retire to my green room and enter into a brown study to contemplate my jaundiced view of why yellow is such an invisible colour in my rainbows.

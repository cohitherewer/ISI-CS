 Campus recruits of IT major Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTS) will soon have to undergo training at Calcutta University (CU) before starting their jobs. 

 The university is set to sign a first-of-its-kind memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the company. After that, technical graduates employed by CTS will have to undergo a mandatory short-term programme at CU before joining their job, said registrar Samir Bandyopadhyay.

 ?By entering the agreement, CTS hopes to leverage the academic expertise of CU. The university, too, stands to benefit from the establishment of an industry interface,? explained an officer of the company. 

 The university is expected to start the training from the current year. The programme will include theoretical and practical classes in fundamentals of computer science and software engineering.

 ?We will start by training the CTS recruits. Our target is to gradually offer similar training to engineers selected in campus interviews by other big companies as well,? the CU registrar stated.

 Teachers of the computer science and engineering departments of CU will provide the training. Besides, experts in the field from multinational companies will also be hired to provide their inputs.

 ?The MoU is significant as it has opened avenues for faculty members to figure out the needs of the IT majors. We have plans to engage our technology departments in the process,? Bandyopadhyay added.

 ?Teachers in the technology departments may take part in the training in the future. The trends that we learn through these interactions will eventually be used to make our curriculum more relevant,? the registrar continued.

 A financial agreement between the two parties has not been reached. The university aims to earn as much as Rs 1.5 crore every year through training sessions, once it throws open the programme to companies other than CTS.

 Sharing of research resources is likely to be a salient feature of the MoU. This will enable the company to seek the help of CU?s experts to solve problems requiring research.

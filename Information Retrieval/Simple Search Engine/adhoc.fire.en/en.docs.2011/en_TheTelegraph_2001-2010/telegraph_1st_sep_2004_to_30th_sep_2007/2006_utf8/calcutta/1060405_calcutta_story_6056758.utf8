 Mega mart work to take off in May

 - ONE-STOP BLOOM SHOP

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Work on Calcutta?s mega flower mart will finally begin in May. The Centre has already cleared the Rs 25.83-crore project and released the first instalment of Rs 5 crore.

 To be set up on the eastern bank of the Hooghly, at Mullickghat, the five-storeyed building will be spread over 34,000 sq ft, with dedicated flower stalls, a hotel and outlets showcasing the best of Bengal?s ethnic treasures, including handicrafts and garments. 

 On Tuesday, members of the Mullickghat Phoolbazar Parichalan Samity, led by chairman Sudhangshu Sil, and representatives of the West Bengal Horticulture Development Corporation met industry minister Nirupam Sen and worked out details of the project. The meeting also finalised an action plan for Phase I of the project.

 ?We have decided to start the bidding process for awarding the contract in May, after completing all formalities, including setting up of committees with representatives of the horticulture development corporation and the Union industry and commerce ministries for supervising the construction work,? Sil said.

 Sources said Calcutta Port Trust has already offered land for the flower mart, which will also be the country?s only international flower auction centre.

 The auction centre will be housed on the second floor of the five-storeyed mall, conceived by Bose Architects. 

 Complete with a state-of-the-art cold chain (meant to preserve flowers at four degrees Celsius), the mall will display the best blooms of Bengal. 

 The ground and the first floors of the address will be earmarked for plush stalls, enticing buyers to splurge.

 ?The space will be dedicated to the setting up of a mall offering everything, from rare Indian handicrafts to garments, foodstuff to flowers,? said Subrata Bose, deputy director of the West Bengal Horticulture Development Corporation.

 The endeavour, he added, is to create the right ambience along the Hooghly. So, it?s not about flowers alone, but about creating a one-stop shop for the bloom brigade.

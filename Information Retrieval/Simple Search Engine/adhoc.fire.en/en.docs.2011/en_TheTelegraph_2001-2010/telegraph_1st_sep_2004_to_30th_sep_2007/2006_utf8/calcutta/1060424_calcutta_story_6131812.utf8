 Set up as a platform to help blind women develop and strengthen their self-identity through theatre, Anya Desh is a group that is also committed towards re-awakening social consciousness. Presented by a group of abandoned and destitute visually-impaired women, Jakhon Andho Prakriti Chandalika is a play in the alternative medium that addresses issues related to social discrimination and expulsion. Drawing parallels from Tagore?s celebrated dance-drama, Chandalika, it points out the attitude of neglect and apathy that people have towards those who are sightless. Prakriti, a blind young girl, who is the play?s protagonist, goes through the same painful experiences as suffered by Tagore?s heroine, albeit for different reasons. It ends with the unfortunate affirmation of the fact that the visually challenged are social outcasts in the same way as the so-called ?untouchables?. Written and directed by Subhashish.

 Event: Play in Bengali, Jakhon Andho Prakriti Chandalika, presented by Anya Desh 

When: Today at 6 pm 

Where: Bharatiyam Cultural Multiplex, IB-201 Salt Lake

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 A helping hand for young minds

 Two initiatives for underprivileged kids were undertaken in February, finds out Patrick Pringle 

 Hope Foundation, an NGO for street children, held a workshop on January 30 at Indian Institute of Training and Development. The aim was for the children to speak their minds on issues that affect their lives, and to figure out how to deal with their problems. It was headed by Sarbani Das Roy, who stressed that the children ?would be in the driver?s seat and would guide the adults, since the day was meant for them?.

 The workshop followed a meeting on January 24 that included a talk by the Society for Peoples? Awareness (SPAN). The meeting concluded that Calcutta should be divided into four zones to make the process easier and more effective. Certain criteria were established for the selection of the children to participate in the session on January 30, including their ability to express themselves.

 The kids had to be in the age group of eight to 16 and there was to be an equal ratio of girls and boys. Das Roy also made it clear that ?there is no relation between academic qualification and the enlightenment of children?. 

 The workshop?s emphasis was on establishing communication with the children. The exercises were designed to make them express their opinions. The kids were then asked to imagine that they were political leaders and each one express personal likes and dislikes.

 The session culminated in the adults and children being split into four groups, with the youngsters constructing a story encapsulating the spectrum of emotions they experience in their lives. This was done with little help from the grown-ups. 

 The groups then performed the stories, with adults playing appropriate parts. Almost every danger and trial that street children experience was portrayed ? with rag-picking, begging, torture, domestic violence... 

 The stories were then discussed within the larger group, and positive conclusions were drawn. The 12 resolutions included stopping pickpocketing, establishing a helpline and acquiring vocational training. Finally, the kids were asked if they would stand by these resolutions. The reply was a resounding yes. Additional workshops for the facilitators and chief functionaries were held on February 13-14.

 From child rights workshops to fundraising for education. The mantra ?freedom through education? was put into practice recently with a large amount of donations to schools from the international organisation Round Table. Eight schools in Calcutta received around Rs 52 crores in funds.

 A significant proportion of the money has come from the Round Table of the Netherlands, three members of which were in town inspecting the fruits of their contributions. John Reinerie, former national president of Round Table Netherlands, visited Calcutta along with friends Henk van Heijst and Wolter Brinks.

 The Dutchmen were impressed with what they saw at Nabadisha Primary School, partly funded by Round Table 34 of Park Street. ?The school was originally one-storey high. We have provided some of the money to extend it. The capacity now is 600 pupils,? said Reinerie. Half of the funding for the schools was provided by the Dutchmen. The remainder was given by the Round Tablers of India. 

 ?We hate having middlemen involved when giving money for such projects. You?re not sure whether the money is being diverted or not. What we like about the Freedom Through Education project is that the money is being managed directly by local people,? added Reinerie.

 But what enthused Round Table Netherlands to make such significant donations to schools in India? Reinerie?s answer is disarmingly simple ? ?We understand that the best way to alleviate the position of the underprivileged is through education. Our belief is particularly relevant to India.? 

 Van Heijst was keen to point out, however, that they are not concerned with pressing their own educational ethics on Indian schools. ?We are simply providing the money with which to improve the schools. We do not want to influence the education system,? he stressed.

 Reinerie was also full of praise for the Round Table organisations that they have encountered in India. ?In the Netherlands, the Round Table is very male dominated. In India it seems to be more of a family affair. For example, there is a Ladies? Circle, which also holds fundraising events.? 

 The next major fundraiser for Round Table India is the Merchants? Cup Go-Karting Competition, at Clown Town from February 23 to 25. The proceeds will go towards the building of more schools under the Freedom Through Education initiative.

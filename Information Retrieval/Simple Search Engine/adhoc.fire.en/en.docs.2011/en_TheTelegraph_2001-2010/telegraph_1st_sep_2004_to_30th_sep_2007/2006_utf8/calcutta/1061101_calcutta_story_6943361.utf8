More twists in the tale

 Sushmita Sen plays Devi, 

 a rehashed version of Jaya Bachchans Radha

 He is facing an injunction but as RGVs quotable quote goes: If Allah, Jesus Christ and Vaishno Devi come together to plead against my doing Sholay, Id still be making it.

 And as planned, Varma has been revealing one casting coup after the other and then releasing the look of each character, one by one.

 After launching Amitabh Bachchans menacing look as Gabbar Singh amidst much fanfare in Mumbai, Varma has now given us a sneak peek into the two leading ladies in his magnum opus.

 Sushmita Sen and Nisha Kothari will be playing the characters made famous by Jaya Bachchan and Hema Malini in the original Sholay of Ramesh Sippy.

 Nisha Kothari plays a 

 modern-day Basanti. As Ghungroo, she is Mumbais only 

 woman auto-rickshaw driver

 But they wont be called Radha and Basanti. Their names in Ram Gopal Varma Ki Sholay are Devi and Ghungroo.

 With the change in names comes a change in characters. Sushmitas Devi, who loved to sing, undergoes nursing training before meeting the brother of inspector Ranveer (Thakurs character, played by Mohanlal) and falling in love at first sight. But before she can settle down, the inspectors entire family is massacred by a ruthless gangster (you know who). Devi is absent and so she survives. Devis grief is slowly replaced by a bitter emptiness that she tries to fill by immersing herself in the work of a small clinic.

 Nishas Ghungroo, on the other hand, would like you to believe shes a man, but she of course is all woman. She is Mumbais only woman autorickshaw driver who calls her vehicle Laila (not Dhanno) which resembles more a kitschy room than it does an autorickshaw.

 Ghungroo lives next to Inspector Ranveers house, with her mother, who is an all-aggro fisherwoman, known as Gangu Mummy. Ghungroos best friend is Devi!

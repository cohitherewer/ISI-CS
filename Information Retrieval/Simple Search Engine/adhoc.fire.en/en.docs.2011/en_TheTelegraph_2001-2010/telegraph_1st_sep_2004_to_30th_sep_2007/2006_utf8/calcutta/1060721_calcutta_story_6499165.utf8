 Where: Virgose, the restobar at HHI.

 When: Wednesday, 4 pm.

 Take a look: New Fusion will belt out tracks in Hindi, Chinese, Malay, Japanese and Spanish. The band, however, specialises in retro classics from the 60s and 70s.

 Having made their mark in Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and even India over the past two years, the band is now in Calcutta to set the party mood at Virgose. 

 Hindi pop numbers on their list include Kaanta laga, Made in India and Koi kahe kehta rahe, while international favourites include tracks by Ricky Martin, Black Eyed Peas, Shakira and Shaggy.

 l snazzy and flashy in their bright green outfits, Jessica Sarona and Mary Ann Buemio, the two vocalists of the band, confess sharing a passion for jazz, ballads, fast beats and R amp;B, while keyboardist and vocalist Jerry Senit prefers rock and alternative music.

 For HHI, which has replaced its existing Russian band with this Filipino one, it is all about growing the client base by offering more than a reason to drink.

 Walk in any day (except Tuesdays) from 8 pm till midnight to hear the new band.

 Voiceover: Our group concept is variety in performance, says band leader Jessica, adding that learning international songs is an interesting challenge for the trio.

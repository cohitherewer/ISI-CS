Just as Asian Dub Foundation and Talvin Singh made 

their mark with their idiosyncratic fusions of western electronica and eastern 

music, so The DArchetypes are getting set to do the same.

The London-based group arrived on the Calcutta leg 

of its India tour after having visited Mumbai and Pune. It played in Dublin at 

ITC Sonar Bangla Sheraton amp; Towers on September 12.

Two members of the group, Shane Solanki and Nikesh 

Shukla, are poets of Asian origin who use both poetry and rap to examine questions 

about race, identity and multi-culturalism.

The other half of the group comprises musicians Sam 

Alto and Amy May, the former playing everything from the guitar through to the 

didgeridoo, while the latter is an experienced viola player. 

We all come from very disparate music backgrounds 

explained Solanki. We all just seemed to meet by chance. I started off helping 

out in the very early days of Ninja Tune (a cult hip hop label), so I very much 

learnt the cut and paste ethos of people like Coldcut. Amy, on the other hand, 

has had a classical music education, he added.

Solanki then went on to expand on the origins of the 

groups ethos. London was a very exciting place to be in, in 1995-96. You 

had the Asian Underground beginning to make an impression, you had drum and bass, 

you had trip hop. All of these new forms really began to mature around this time, 

and our approach to music is strongly rooted to that time and place.

May agreed, saying, To this day, I still go 

to three or four gigs a week. I think theres a tendency for older folks 

to dismiss the music of today as being inferior to that of the past, but thats 

simply not true. 

So how have their live shows in India gone so far? 

Has India warmed to The DArchetypes sound? The shows so far have been 

really encouraging, smiled Solanki. 

The majority of the audience at the Pune gig 

seemed to be young girls, who really enjoyed the Bollywood samples that we incorporated 

into our set. We have also been using a lot of computer generated sounds at the 

moment.

And what about the brief but brimful stay in Calcutta? 

I have really grown to love the city in the few days that weve been 

here. Its got a lot of character as a place. Some of us have come to India 

as tourists before, but getting to actually play here is just brilliant.

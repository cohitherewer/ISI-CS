Each piece can be adapted to create a minimum of two different pieces of ornaments. An elaborate neckpiece can be detached and adorned as a pendant, wristlet, maangtika or a simple neckpiece. 

 They come co-ordinated with elaborate earrings, where the tops can be used as small regular wear studs.

 The designs, a mix of the traditional and contemporary, make them suitable for any occasion.

 Pocket pinch: Rs 30,000 upwards for a set.

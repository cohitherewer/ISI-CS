 Calcutta has never been on a more fashionable roll. Big labels and designer dens apart, the latest to join the race is School of Fashion Technology (SOFT) and FAME Service Training Academy.

 Come August 1, students across the city will have access to a whole gamut of professional training in the fields of fashion, glamour, hospitality and aviation. 

 The address for both will be the EILM campus at 6, Waterloo Street, near Great Eastern Hotel.

 With applications pouring in and the screening process on in full force, the courses are set to commence in three months.

 While FAME offers service training in aviation, hospitality and customer service sectors for air, maritime and earth, SOFT will focus on creating career opportunities in the fashion sector.

 SOFT offers three kinds of courses ? modelling, hairstyling and make-up, and fashion designing.

 Calcutta is home to some of the most awesome talent the nation has ever produced, yet there is something lacking here, something that slows down the process of building a career. A systematic institution such as this would reduce the struggle of the first few years, said Indrani Dasgupta.

 The model, looking as attractive as ever in jeans, tees and knitted jacket on Monday morning, is the dean of the modelling and hair and make-up divisions of SOFT.

 The basic fee structure: Rs 99,000 for 48 weeks, Rs 66,000 for the six-month programme and Rs 52,000 for the three-month course.

 Apart from comprehensive theoretical training, the courses offer hands-on training with the industrys best. Both SOFT and FAME are promising placements, with a money-back guarantee.

 Arvind Dhar, general manager of marketing of both the institutes, said: The money-back guarantee is indeed a big thing? But it also makes the admission process tougher. We wouldnt want to train anybody who wouldnt be accepted by the industry.

 Another feature of the institutes, added Dhar, would be complete industry involvement, with everything formulated through research in tandem with industry insiders.

 One objective of this venture, explained choreographer and stylist Ajay Bisht, an associate dean with SOFT, is to spot talent good enough to fit into the international scene, that too at the right age. 

 There is such a huge gap between the quintessential elements that make a pretty Indian model and those that make her an international supermodel. The Indian scene is very Bollywood-type ? cheerful, pleasant and fair ? quite in contrast with the global leaner, taller, more fashionable look, explained Ajay, who has done shows with Dior, Armani and Gucci.

 Apart from the basic educational qualifications ? 10+2 for some and graduation for others ? what will the experts be looking at in applicants? Well, the starting point is definitely dedication and aspiration. If we are satisfied and convinced with the potential then well take it from there, revealed Indrani.

 Apart from Indrani and Ajay, fashion photographer Rahul Dutta and Grasim Mr India 2004 Sunil Mann are also on the institutes panel. 

 Besides the regular teaching staff in Calcutta, some of the countrys best will be flying in frequently for special classes.

 Since there will be such a wide range of courses offered, we will be able to direct students in the right direction, depending on their potential and aptitude. After that, we assure students faster and safer contacts with the right people in the right places, smiled Indrani.

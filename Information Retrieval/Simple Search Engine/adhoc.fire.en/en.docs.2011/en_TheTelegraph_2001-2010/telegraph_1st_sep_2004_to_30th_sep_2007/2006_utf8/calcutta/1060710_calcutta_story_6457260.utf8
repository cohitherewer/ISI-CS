The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Projects that lack foresight

 Partha Chattopadhyay, Trinamul Congress 

 MLA from Behala (West), met readers of The Telegraph. Participants 

 included Asoke Dutta, Debsundar Chatterjee, Pantu Adhikari, 

 Bulu Roychowdhury, Paritosh Maji, Arup Chowdhury and Nanda 

 Lahiri

Asoke Dutta: Due to severe traffic congestion, it takes a lot of time to travel from Taratala to Behala Chowrasta. Is there any solution to these traffic snarls? Besides, there is an acute drinking water supply shortage in ward number 125 of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC). Waterlogging is also a big problem during monsoon. 

 The Taratala flyover was constructed to ease the traffic situation in this area, but unfortunately the flyover was made unscientifically. At least two flanks were needed to clear the traffic congestion. There are several problems in these areas. Cars, autorickshaws, Matadors, vans and trucks are parked on the roadside, which make vehicular movement more difficult. The government, on the other hand, has done nothing to simplify the problem. I think to ease the problem, we need one more flyover from Behala to Behala Chowrasta. 

 Second, when the Trinamul municipal board was in power, we tried our best to solve the drinking water problem. I know about problem areas like Sarsuna satellite township, where work has been carried out in an unplanned manner. The urban development minister has assured me that the problem could be solved with the funds from Asian Development Bank. And about waterlogging, the pipes in this area were laid without proper planning. However, I will see what can be done. 

Debsundar Chatterjee: Due to recent digging up of Biren Roy Road, which is the only road to Sarsuna satellite township, commuters are put to great hardship. Only one bus can pass at a time. The autorickshaws in the areas are adding to the problem. Will you look into this matter? 

 Pipes are being laid on the road for sewerage. I will take up the matter with the authorities concerned, so that daily commuters do not suffer. 

Pantu Adhikari: There are no civic services in the Paner Ara area in ward number 125. Besides, a large number of people from the minority community lives in Behala. Do you have any plans to help them in getting jobs or plying some trade? And lastly, can you tell us the status of the medical college that was planned? 

 It is very unfortunate that you are not getting any civic services. I will talk to the mayor. If money is required, I will give the funds. I will also approach our MPs and councillors to extend a helping hand. 

 Unemployment is not restricted to the minority community only, it is everywhere. A section of women in Behala is engaged in self-help groups. If the unemployed youths form cooperatives and draw up projects, I can ask the government to help them with funds. A few clubs have approached me. I have given financial help to 133 clubs. Youths should come forward and take the initiative. 

 The government has plans to start a medical college on the TB Hospital campus in Jadavpur. I have discussed the matter with the chief minister. I am also planning to start a management institute at Alipore.

Bulu Roychowdhury: Health services in ward 118 are not satisfactory. With the outbreak of dengue and malaria, people here are living under threat. Will you take some steps? Besides, the government is issuing licence for liquor shops in slum areas. This is polluting the area. Can you do something? 

 We are taking steps. The CMC authorities are spraying bleaching powder. The government is issuing licences for opening liquor shops without judging the pros and cons. Earlier, it had given a nod to a liquor shop close to a hospital. We have decided that we will force the houseowner not to let out his premises for opening a liquor shop. 

Paritosh Maji: Do have you any plan to start a vocational training institute or a garment manufacturing unit, where the unemployed youths can get employment? 

 A sizable number of tailors works at Garden Reach. So, it is quite uncertain whether a garment unit in Behala will be successful. They can start with something else, I am always there to help them. 

Arup Chowdhury: There has been a rumour that Behala police station will be included in Calcutta Police. Can you tell us what is happening? 

 For a long time there has been a proposal for an additional police station in Behala but I really don?t know when will it materialise.

Concluded

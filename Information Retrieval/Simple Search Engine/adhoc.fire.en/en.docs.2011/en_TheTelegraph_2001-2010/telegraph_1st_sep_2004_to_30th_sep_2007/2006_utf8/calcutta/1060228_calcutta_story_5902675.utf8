 What: The Royal Awards Nite, organised by the Royal Calcutta Golf Club and The Telegraph.

 Where: RCGC Tea Lawn.

 When: Sunday evening.

 The awards: The hosts for the evening were the attractive Roshni Chopra, of Doordarshan cricket coverage fame, and Brandon D Souza, president of Tiger Sports Marketing. The Champion of Champions awards were given away by fashion designer Kiran Uttam Ghosh and golfer Feroze Ali. The winner and runners-up in the Seniors category were K.P. Kapai and Aniruddh Bagri. Best Gross was bagged by Lakshman Singh and the Champion of Champions trophy was taken home by Prasan Lohia.

 Sip n bite: Parathewali Galli, Khulladwali Biryani and a Thai Bamboo Cuisine counter comprised the dinner spread. For snacks, there was an interesting mix of Masala Fish Fingers, kebabs and cocktail samosas. A busy bar kept the revellers engaged all through the awards ceremony and the after-party.

 Song and dance: The evening began with a performance by dance troupe Shubho. Dressed in shimmering blues and yellows, they took centre stage while swinging to the Kaal title track, Deedar de and Aashiq banaya aapne. Mumbai-based singer Sonu Kakkar (of Babuji zara dheere chalo fame) entertained the crowd after the first set of awards, with tracks like Ishq na kariyo, Saki saki, No entry and her own hit Babuji.

 Voiceover: Every year we organise a club prize distribution. Starting this year, we have christened it awards night because awards sound better, smiled G.S. Baweja committee member and convenor of entertainment.

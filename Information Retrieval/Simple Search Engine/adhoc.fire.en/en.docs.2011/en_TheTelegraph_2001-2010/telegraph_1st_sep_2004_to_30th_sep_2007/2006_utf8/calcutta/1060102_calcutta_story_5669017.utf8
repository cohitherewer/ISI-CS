 Can you buy pipes and cutlery or nails and sofa sets for your home under the same roof? Or maybe check out the latest bath fittings while looking out for a novel wedding gift? 

 Yes, you can.

 Calcutta is now home to steeljunction, the countrys first organised steel retail outlet, a Tata Steel venture aimed at making ?shopping for steel sexy and fun?. The one-stop store at the junction of Topsia Road and the Park Circus connector has a sweeping museum feel and is a celebration of everything steel.

 ?Steel as a category has always been extremely downtrodden and taken for granted. This is a marketing R amp;D project and embodies our quest to get closer to the consumer with the touch-feel experience, showcasing the seduction of steel,? says Sumit Ray, chief (retail initiatives), Tata Steel Limited.

 Designed to display the versatility of steel (?the strength as well as the beauty?), the split-level store stocking over 4,500 different types of steel items, is divided into two sections ? ?home construction and maintenance products? and ?home aesthetics products?.

 Tata Steel managing director B. Muthuraman, while inaugurating the unique retail outlet last month, had mentioned the ?failure to showcase steel in a structured manner before?. Ray feels the steeljunction chain can tap the huge potential of steel retailing in B2C by cashing in on the emergence of the home segment.

 ?With easy housing finance and plastic money, young adults are now proud owners of apartments and crave lifestyle products. Our endeavour is to enter all homes and boost downstream consumer spend through a friendly format and constant dissemination of knowledge,? Ray adds.

 The ground level at steeljunction houses basic home construction and maintenance products like re-bars, pipes, bath fittings and hand tools. The ?very contemporary? first floor parades slick-steel lifestyle products, from stylised furniture to elegant pedestal lamps, kitchenware and cutlery to stainless steel jewellery and even artefacts crafted from recycled steel.

 ?One of the most compelling reasons to kick off the retail initiative in Calcutta was, of course, the fact that the metro is closer to our Jamshedpur support base. Also, Calcutta is quite a steel-centric city and open to new ideas,? offers Ray. The new format, besides making shopping for steel a ?pleasurable family experience?, also hopes to sensitise vendors to innovate.

 The mid-size speciality store, retailing a range of steel-oriented products under one roof, also hopes to ?involve more and more women in the process of buying steel? with a cosy ambience, spacious aisles, attractive signage and proactive sales staff.

 From customised modular kitchens to gardening tools, recliners to rickshaw replicas that serve as cardholders ? the user-friendly display and the wide array of options encourage browsing and impulse buying, hitherto unheard of in this category. An in-store caf? serves to enhance the fun feel.

 Another unique component of the steel store is the knowledge centre, a forum that provides information on the usage of steel and its various applications, from tips to decorate your dream home to the latest innovations in steel cladding for that new-age, minimalist office.

 ?Members can access books and magazines on architecture and interiors, while the adjacent hall can be used for audio-visual presentations, seminars and even art exhibitions or a sculpture show, with steel very much at the heart of it,? observes Ray.

 The store management is keen to turn the first floor of steeljunction into a ?destination?, with music events and, loyalty schemes, in-store promos, wellness campaigns and constant innovations. 

 ?The way we move forward will depend a lot on consumer behaviour and the reaction to this totally out-of-the-box format we have launched,? declares Ray.

 The knowledge centre will also highlight steel trivia like the Bayonne Bridge in New Jersey, US, using 26,000 tonnes of steel, against 26,500 tonnes consumed by our own Howrah bridge.

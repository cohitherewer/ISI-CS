 Ceremony house order

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta High Court on Thursday asked the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) to state its policy on allowing building-owners to let out their premises for weddings or other social functions.

 In its affidavit, the CMC will have to mention how many buildings of the city are being used for weddings and other ceremonies and how many of them are registered with the civic authorities, ruled the division bench of Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurkar and Justice Nadira Patherya.

 The court also asked the CMC to clarify whether building-owners letting out their premises for private gatherings are asked to follow certain guidelines.

 The bench wanted to know whether the CMC was abiding by an earlier order prohibiting hosting of marriage receptions or other ceremonies in a building situated in a residential neighbourhood.

 The proceedings were part of the hearing of a case relating to civic tax on a building on Pramathesh Barua Sarani. 

 The building is being used as a wedding house. The owner of the building moved the court after the CMC had asked him to pay more tax for the building.

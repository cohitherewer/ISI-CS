 After the football fever, it was party time at CC amp;FC on Saturday evening. The occasion was The Telegraph Merchants Cup Nite, to raise a toast to the spirit of this popular corporate sporting event.

 The popularity of the Cup is growing with every passing year and this time we had 71 participating teams, said Deepankar Nandy, CEO, CC amp;FC. And the Cup Nite is one of the most eagerly-awaited occasions in the event calendar of the club. The mood, music and milieu create the perfect party atmosphere, he added.

 The post-Cup party kicked off at 8.30 pm, but the action on the dance floor did not really hot up till 11.30 pm. The makeshift shamiana on the club lawns was the place to sit with a drink and some snacks and catch up with friends. The talking point: football, football and more football.

 The victory of the Selvel A, Reliance Infocomm and The Telegraph teams at CC amp;FC were discussed as animatedly as the English win over Paraguay at Frankfurt earlier that evening. And if the crowd began to thin a little earlier than usual, the blame was to be shared by Hernan Crespo and the humidity. For if some succumbed to the sweat factor of the June night, the rest rushed home to catch Argentina open their World Cup campaign.

 Dinner, as usual, was a lavish spread of vegetarian and non-vegetarian fare dished out by Chickys. The non-vegetarian platter consisted of Veg Pulao, Mutton Kasha, Kadhai Chicken, Chicken Reshmi Kebab, Tandoori Fish and Butter Naan. The vegetarian section boasted Paneer Butter Masala, Mixed Vegetables and Pulao. There was a neat salad counter that turned out to be quite popular, second only to the ice cream, jalebi and gulab jamun tables.

 The food is the main attraction on this night. People prefer to have their fill before hitting the dance floor, said a regular.

 DJ Sanjay Dutta kept the feet 

 moving in the AC tent with tracks like Jhalak dikhla 

 ja, Zara jhoom, Tera Suroor and Woh 

 lamhe.

 Alternative Living Theatre stages a play in Lahore

 Borders, terrorists, wars are 

 not for the common people of India and Pakistan. All they 

 want is to get closer through more buses, more cricket, 

 more films and more theatre. That is the impression gained 

 by two theatre groups from Calcutta that participated in 

 the Panj Pani Festival in Lahore, hosted by Ajoka. Led by 

 dramatist and director Sahid Nadim and Madeeha Gauhar, Ajoka 

 has been doing meaningful theatre in Lahore for 15 years.

 The festival, from March 23 to April 7 at Alhamra Hall, featured around 28 groups, three of them from India. Rangakarmee, which had participated in the Women?s Festival in Lahore two years ago, returned with Rudali and Maiyat. Alternative Living Theatre staged the 189th show of Tritiyo Juddha and the first full-length presentation of Victimised at Panj Pani.

 ?There was a time when theatre 

 and dancing were taboo in Pakistan but now there are so 

 many groups doing good theatre and there are women who come 

 rushing to rehearsal from work and participate in backstage 

 work, just as they do in Calcutta. I didn?t see too many 

 women in jeans, but most don?t wear the burkha either. 

 Ajoka even managed to do an anti-burkha play in the 

 Assembly,? said Usha Ganguli of Rangakarmee.

 Her pet project now is to bring the Lahore troupes to Calcutta. ?They have shown so much eagerness to perform in Calcutta and I think Calcutta needs to have this kind of an Indo-Pak exposure. Maybe we can do something during Natyamela,? said Ganguli.

 Prabir Guha of Alternative Living Theatre found a kindred spirit in theatre groups like Teherik-e-Nishan and Interact Theatre. Guha?s new form of low-cost ?journey theatre? used for Victimised and the non-verbal physical drama Tritiyo Juddha went down well.

 ?People were in tears,? he said, 

 adding that Ajoka had already invited him to conduct a theatre 

 workshop in Lahore.

 All about love

 Bharat Dabholkar has done for 

 himself the unthinkable: gone to a respected Marathi author 

 and updated into English one of his best plays. So, Vasant 

 Kanetkar?s Prema Tujha Rang Kasa? has become Funny 

 Thing Called Love (a Provogue presentation brought to 

 Calcutta by Anamika Kala Sangam and Sanskriti Sagar). Unfortunately, 

 we don?t know of Kanetkar here as, like many superior Indian 

 dramatists, he has not been translated into other Indian 

 languages, let alone English. Besides, he received comparatively 

 condescending treatment from critics since he wrote regularly 

 for Mumbai?s commercial theatres. This is unfair because 

 he crafted and composed drama finely, even if fully aware 

 of the popular pulse. Ironically, Dabholkar has done Marathi 

 theatre a service by giving non-Marathis and non-Indians 

 (the production has toured the UK , Singapore and Sri Lanka 

 ) exposure to Kanetkar. 

 Everything seems deceptively simple, even commonplace, in Funny Thing Called Love. A middle-class Hindu professor and his wife, who had themselves married despite family opposition, find their daughter has fallen in love with a Christian auto mechanic?s son. The father (we remember that Kanetkar himself taught English in college) has no problems with the match, but the mother resists it initially. After marriage, the young couple have raging fights, but they still love each other. Meanwhile, the professor?s son falls for a girl who jilts him to wed a tycoon, then realises her mistake and wants to return to him. Here Kanetkar makes his one false move: conceding to public morality, he does not allow her to divorce; she goes back to her husband. 

 It?s easy to ask, what?s so special about this story? But we must not forget that Kanetkar wrote it in 1961, when onstage inter-faith weddings were few and far between. More importantly, his humorous dialogue, deep understanding of family ties and acute sense of the moment are in rich evidence, constantly reminding us of love in our own lives, thereby never ceasing to touch and move us. 

 Dabholkar directs the cast well, with help from Vijay Kenkre. By far the most exceptional performance comes from Liladhar Kambli as Mr D?Costa the garage owner. Mangal Kenkre and Shivani Tanksale, acting the mother and daughter, express many of the play?s best scenes through understatement. On the downside, the lip-synced songs are eminently disposable, while Vijoo Khote (the professor father) has trouble with his lines and Atul Parchure (the son) behaves a little too hyper and loud. Yet all four are so perfectly cast that they even look like a family.

 At a time when chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and Left Front chairman Biman Bose are stressing the need for preserving waterbodies, a 15-cottah pond has all but been filled up in mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya?s ward in Naktala. The landfill is allegedly being carried out with backing from the CPM.

 Though local residents have raised their voices against the illegal act a number of times, there has been no attempt at recreating the waterbody. 

 When contacted, the mayor said he was not aware of the pond being filled up. ?Let me first inquire into the matter. Stern action will be taken against those involved,? Bhattacharyya told Metro.

 Biswajit Mukherjee, special law officer in the state pollution control board, confirmed that he had received a complaint from a Naktala resident about the landfill. 

 ?On the basis of a complaint lodged with us, we have asked Jadavpur police station to probe the matter and submit a report at the earliest,? he said.

 The pond ? located at 6A and 6B, Naktala Road ? has been covered with sludge and other rubbish. A filthy smell emanates from the area, much to inconvenience of local residents. Though the landfill is being carried out in broad daylight, no one in the area knows for sure which promoter is behind it.

 ?Only a few months ago, we were using the pond for bathing and catching fish. Now, we are helplessly watching a group filling it up with sludge, bothering little about the environment. Whoever is behind the landfill, he must be planning to construct a highrise on the spot,? said Sudhir Das, 70, who has been living just behind the pond since childhood.

 Asutosh Dey, another local resident, alleged that a gang hired by the promoter responsible for the landfill is threatening him to vacate the place. ?I was even arrested in November 2003 on false charges of stealing fish from the pond. Now, the promoters? men have severed my water connection and sewerage line. I don?t know when this ordeal will come to an end,? he added.

 Eight Santhal families, who live near the pond, have also complained about ?regular harassment? by the promoters? men. ?We, too, are under pressure to leave the place,? said Dukhu Oraon.

 Superintendent of police (South 24-Parganas) S.N. Gupta said police are looking for the landfill promoter/s. ?But we are yet to locate the guilty.?

 The pond belongs to Anima Chowdhury and her family, who have been living in the neighbourhood for decades. ?We own the pond but I am not aware of it being filled up,? she said, denying reports that the pond has been sold.

 Siddhartha Ghosh, local CPM leader, denied the landfill charge of the local residents. ?Who told you that the pond is being filled up? It still exists, though a portion of it has dried up. A marshy tract adjoining the pond is being filled up to construct a temporary road,? he added.

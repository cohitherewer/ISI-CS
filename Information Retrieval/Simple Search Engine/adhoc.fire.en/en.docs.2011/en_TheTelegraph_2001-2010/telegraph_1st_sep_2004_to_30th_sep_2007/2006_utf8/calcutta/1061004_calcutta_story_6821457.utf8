 What: DJ Suketu Nite. Where: 

 Underground in Hotel Hindusthan International (HHI).

 When: September 29.

 The bash: All those who 

 thought Saptami night was all about pandal-hopping should 

 have caught a glimpse of chock-a-block Underground.

 The star DJ who makes party people 

 around the country groove to his remixes of Bin tere 

 sanam and Woh Lamhe made a crowd of 200-odd dance 

 till Asthami dawned. Suketu played to the gallery with tracks 

 like Kyon aaj kal neend kam, Beedi, Hips 

 dont lie and his brand new remix, Aa jaane 

 jaan.

 Voiceover: The crowd 

 comprises mostly youngsters and many of them have come to 

 a proper disc for the first time. We consider 10.30 pm as 

 kiddies hour but the house was already full by then, 

 said an official at Underground.

 What: Exhibition of Diagolds 

 new festive collection.

 Where: Diagold showroom 

 at City Centre.

 When: October 5 to 10.

 Take a look: Diagold is 

 all set to launch two new collections for the festive season 

 Vintage Green and Bold amp; Beautiful. City designer 

 Shantanu Goenka will unveil the collection designed by Meenakshi 

 Modi. 

 Vintage Green, the traditional 

 line of studded jewellery inspired by the art deco form, 

 comprises long emerald pendants, chokers and ruby necklaces 

 with chandelier earrings. The Bold amp; Beautiful line 

 consists of large stone pendants, chunky bracelets and dangling 

 or cascading earrings using precious stones like amber, 

 jade, onyx, rose quartz, amethyst, coral and baroque stones.

 Pocket pinch: Prices start 

 from Rs 15,000.

 Voiceover: While 

 the Bold amp; Beautiful collection is trendy, the Vintage 

 Green is for the festive and wedding season, said 

 Meenakshi.

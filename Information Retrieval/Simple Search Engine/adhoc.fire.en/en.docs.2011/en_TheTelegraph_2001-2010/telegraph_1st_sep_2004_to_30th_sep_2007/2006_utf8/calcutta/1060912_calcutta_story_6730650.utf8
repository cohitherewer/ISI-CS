 Rediscovering Tagore

 The pattern of the vast corpus of Tagores literary and artistic compositions reveals moods and dispositions that suggest a distinct variation in creative impulse at different periods of his life. The impulse, however, is one which constructs as well as demolishes as a means of moving ahead. In Bhanga Gorar Taley Taley, Sharmila Roy Pommot renders Tagore songs based on the theme of Tagores experiments with various art forms. Her songs illustrate the way in which Tagore, from his middle-age onwards, constantly altered mediums and their forms to express his inner self and his response to contemporary world events. The poetry, letters, drama and paintings of Tagore also help recreate a unique aspect of his artistic idiosyncrasies. The programme also features Romaprasad Banik, Anasuya Chowdhury and Debshankar Haldar (acting) and Pramod Basu (reading). Concept and direction: Sharmila Roy Pommot.

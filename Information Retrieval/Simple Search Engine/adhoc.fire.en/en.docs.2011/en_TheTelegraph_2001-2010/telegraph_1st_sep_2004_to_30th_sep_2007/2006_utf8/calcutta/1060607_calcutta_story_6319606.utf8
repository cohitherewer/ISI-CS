The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Why should I watch a World Cup in which India is not playing? That world is hardly complete. I feel ashamed to think that we do not get to play there despite having so much talent. The euphoria around the tournament is like morphine. All it does is distract people from issues affecting their lives. Playgrounds are shrinking in the city. No one is complaining. In the villages where there is space, there is no infrastructure. I bought a Baruipur club a playground. A political party now occupies it. This is our reality. It?s strange to think that we had defeated the English playing barefoot once.

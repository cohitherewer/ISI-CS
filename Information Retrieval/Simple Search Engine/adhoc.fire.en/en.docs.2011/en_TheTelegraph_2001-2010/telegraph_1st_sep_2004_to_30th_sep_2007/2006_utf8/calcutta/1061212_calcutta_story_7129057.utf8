The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You share your birthday with...

 Yuvraj Singh

 You are a livewire, always ready with an opinion and 

 a snappy line. You have a way of getting people to cooperate 

 and are a good manager. Financial security is very important 

 for you. You have tremendous empathy and dont take relationships 

 lightly. You are easygoing and rarely timid. At work, you 

 expect ethics, honesty and morals. 

 Kusum Bhandari

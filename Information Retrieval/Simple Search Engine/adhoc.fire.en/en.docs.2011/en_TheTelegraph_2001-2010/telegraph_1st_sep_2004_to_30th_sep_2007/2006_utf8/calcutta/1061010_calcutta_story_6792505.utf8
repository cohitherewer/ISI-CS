 Melodious makeover

 ZONE

 A tattoo spiralling down her right 

 arm. A silver stud piercing her chin. Oversized retro sunglasses 

 covering half her face.

 Meet Mohini Singh, former class 

 teacher, IVB, Modern High School for Girls. Meet Carlyta 

 Mouhini, musical powerhouse with Bollywood hits under her 

 belt (in picture by Pabitra Das).

 The familiar smile and the warm 

 voice give it away Mohini Singh is Carlyta Mouhini. 

 Oh god, these numerological people. But Carlyta, like 

 Mouhini, means enchantress in Portuguese, she says.

 A lot has changed since 1992. 

 Mouhini had then joined Modern High School for Girls as 

 class teacher. She taught some 45 girls till 3 pm, studied 

 thereafter in Loreto College, and then went on to spin tracks 

 at Someplace Else as the first female DJ at The Parks 

 popular pub.

 It was like living a triple 

 role, 24x7. It was lovely while it lasted. But that wasnt 

 really me. I was dying to get out of the routine and pursue 

 music my only love, she recalls. 

 And so she did. After teaching 

 for four years, and being part of a band (Trishul), Mouhini 

 joined her parents, who were settled in Sao Paulo, and lived 

 the Latin culture. 

 The future perception of 

 Bollywood had to be Latino and hip-hop and I went with my 

 gut. I learned music and dancing before returning to India 

 in 1999, she shares. 

 Jingles, big Bollywood breaks 

 in the form of Ishq chandi hai from Biwi No 1, 

 the title track from N. Chandras Excuse Me, 

 and lots of live shows later, confidence is something 

 she does not lack. I can do exactly what Madonna, 

 JLo and Shakira can do on stage, she smiles.

 Sizzling at stage shows apart, 

 Mouhini is now working on a couple of albums. She has roped 

 in Tabul Sutradhar (music director of Joggers Park 

 and No Entry) for her Hindi album Subah Ki Dhoop. 

 It has eight numbers, suiting each mood from dawn 

 to dusk. It is an amalgamation of all that I have heard 

 and loved, she says. 

 so coming up is a Bengali album 

 Roke Joto Chhele by Asha Audio. Ready for 

 a November 15 release, each of the seven tracks has a Latino 

 flavour and a title song video to its credit.

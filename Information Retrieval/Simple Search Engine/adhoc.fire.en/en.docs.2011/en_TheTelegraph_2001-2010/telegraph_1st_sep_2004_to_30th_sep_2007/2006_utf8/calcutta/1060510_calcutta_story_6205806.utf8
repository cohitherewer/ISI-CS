The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 Last year when I received my voter?s ID card, I found that 

 my name, my father?s name and our address were all misprinted. 

 This year, even after providing them with the correct information, 

 the authorities have again misprinted my name and other 

 details. How can the election officials play with what is 

 a vital proof of our identity? I request the authorities 

 to look into the matter. 

 Md Sohail, McLeod Street. 

 I am a subscriber of BSNL?s pre-paid Excel services. For 

 the past few months, I have noticed that my pre-paid balance 

 is being deducted without my making any calls or SMS. Despite 

 repeated complaints at the customer care centre, nothing 

 has been done. My balance is still being deducted everyday. 

 I request the concerned authorities to take some steps in 

 this regard. 

 Nived Kansal, Tiriti Bazaar.

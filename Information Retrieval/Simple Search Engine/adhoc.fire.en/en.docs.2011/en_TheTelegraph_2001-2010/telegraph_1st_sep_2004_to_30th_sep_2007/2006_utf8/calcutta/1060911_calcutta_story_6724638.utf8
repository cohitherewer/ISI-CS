 to textiles, dokra to dhurries, the focus is on decor 

 pieces for the home. On till September 28, from 11 am to 

 8 pm, this is one show you just dont want to miss.

 Tracking trends for summer

 The India Fashion Week is 

 over and so is the hullabaloo. You scanned the series on 

 the telly every night and saw it in GoodLife every 

 morning. The white wonders, cool cutwork, dreamy dresses, 

 knee-length silhouettes By now you should know which trend 

 has made it and which hasnt. So make use of the trends 

 you tracked and get started for spring-summer 07. 

 After all, can it ever be too soon to get your style facts 

 right?

 Grabbing the Puja numbers

 The Pujas, other than all 

 the fun and frolic, also brings with it another annual must 

 the Pujabarshiki. With all the publications printed and 

 bound, its high time you book your copies. Rewind 

 to your childhood days with Anandamela, get your 

 fill of filmi gossip with Anandalok or dig 

 into food and fashion with Sananda Pushpanjali. And 

 if you are more into Bengali literature, dont forget 

 your copy of Desh or Ananda Bazar Patrika. 

 Happy reading!

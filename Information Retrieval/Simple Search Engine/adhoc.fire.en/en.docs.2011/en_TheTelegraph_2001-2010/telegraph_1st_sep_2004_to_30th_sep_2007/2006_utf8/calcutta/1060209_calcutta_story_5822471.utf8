 Runaway groom ties knot

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 The marriage that was abandoned in the mandap was solemnised four days later in a courtroom. 

 Rajiv Shaw, who had disappeared in a huff midway into his wedding ceremony for not getting a motorcycle as part of the dowry, surrendered at Sealdah court on Wednesday afternoon. 

 He sought a pardon for his act from the additional chief judicial magistrate.

 Rajiv was accompanied by Rita, the girl he had left standing at the mandap. They later registered their marriage in the court, in front of the judge.

 Rajiv, an autorickshaw driver from Baranagar?s Kashi Nath Dutta Road, told the judge that he had committed a grave mistake and would like to settle down with Rita. 

 She, on her part, said she had no complaints against Rajiv or his family.

 Satisfied, the judge released Rajiv on bail and allowed his father Shiba Prasad Shaw and two others, arrested in this connection, to go scot-free. 

 ?Since there is no complaint, we have no case and hence, the accused are now free,? said an investigating officer of Chitpur police station.

 ?There was a small celebration of sorts, with the members of both families hugging each other before stepping out of the court together. The bride and the groom were all smiles,? recounted a senior police officer. 

 Witnesses said Rajiv turned up at the court around 2 pm in a dhoti and kurta with a garland around his neck. 

 Rita, too, had dressed for the occasion in a red sari and had decorated her hands with mehndi. 

 The two got off a taxi and walked up straight to the judge?s chamber, much to the curiosity of onlookers.

 Vehicles skip fume check

 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE

 After the ban on old vehicles was struck down by Calcutta High Court, the state government had vowed to fight the fume battle in the city with rigorous enforcement of the tail-pipe emission norms. 

 But that seems mission impossible, considering the turnout at the auto emission testing centres (AETCs).

 Though it is mandatory for all owners to get their vehicles? emission checked every six months, only 3.1 lakh of the million-odd vehicles registered with the public vehicles department turned up at the AETCs between January and June 2005. 

 In the next six months, the figure slid to 2.96 lakh.

 Till April 15 this year, the emission check was conducted on only 2.13 lakh vehicles. 

 Admitting that only 15 to 20 per cent of the owners get their vehicles tested, transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury said: ?Inadequate infrastructure prevents us from tracking down the offenders. We are preparing an action plan, involving all the stake-holders, to force vehicle-owners to go for emission tests.?

 State pollution board chairman Sudip Bandopadhyay blamed police for the rampant law flout. ?Our duty is to ensure that the machines for testing tail-pipe emission are in order. As for identifying errant vehicles and taking action against them, it is the responsibility of police.?

 Deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Javed Shamim pleaded that with the existing infrastructure, his department was hard-pressed in keeping a tab on all vehicles. 

 According to Asim Banerjee, president of AETC Operators? Association, 75 to 100 vehicles should turn up at each testing centre daily if the owners abide by the law. ?But on an average, 10 to 15 vehicles show up for the test. And the count is decreasing.?

 What is more alarming, he added, is that only two to three per cent of commercial vehicles ? that pollute the environment the most ? are tested. 

 The net result is the steady rise in the poison content of Calcutta?s ambient air. ?The levels of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxide in the air are increasing due to auto emission. All are poisonous and can lead to several diseases,?? warned automobile expert S.M. Ghosh.

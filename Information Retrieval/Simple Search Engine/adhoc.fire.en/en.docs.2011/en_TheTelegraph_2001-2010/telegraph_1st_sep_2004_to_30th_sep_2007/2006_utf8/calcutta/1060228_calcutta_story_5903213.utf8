 Arriving in a foreign country for the first time can be both a baffling and intimidating experience. Which is why, on Saturday, pupils and staff of Lakshmipat Singhania Academy (LSA) joined a fresh contingent of English and Canadian volunteers from the GAP charity based in Reading, UK.

 The interactive session took place on a ferry trip from Babughat to Belur Math.

 Most of the British volunteers were on their GAP year ? a year out between school and university that many youngsters in the UK take. 

 The Canadian volunteers were older, many of them nearing the end of their university degrees. Some have already been in India for a couple of months, but many (as their complexions suggested!) were newcomers.

 Nearly all of the volunteers are about to take five-month placements in Sikkim, Kalimpong and Darjeeling, working in organisations ranging from psychiatric hospitals to orphanages.

 Alice Salvesen, a GAP employee based in Britain, summed up the importance of such interactive exercises for the new arrivals. ?This is a way for the volunteers to adjust and adapt to life in India in an easy way. It is a big shock when one steps on foreign soil for a short-term work experience. So, interactions such as this are invaluable to a new volunteer.? 

 Saturday, which was part of a wider four-day orientation programme for the volunteers, kicked off with breakfast on board the ferry from Babughat, followed by a brief stop at Belur Math.

 The most lively part of the morning was the journey back, when the pupils of LSA performed a traditional dance to music on the ferry?s public address system.

 Mohit Bengani then lead the students of the school in a small repertoire of Hindi pop songs. The youngsters then invited the volunteers to learn some dance moves. The final stretch of the ferry ride back was accompanied by a couple of singalongs led by Canadian volunteer Mark Fossen, who played the guitar and the harmonica.

 Stressing the advantages of similar interactive programmes, Uma Doss, a teacher of LSA, summed up: ?Such programmes are beneficial for both the volunteers and the school. This way we learn a lot about each others? cultures.?

Digital delight

 As with many other creative disciplines, art is becoming increasingly adventurous as technology becomes more sophisticated. The Arena Multimedia digital art exhibition, FX 2006, at Ashutosh Birth Centenary Hall, Indian Museum, showed the possibilities of this fledgling art form.

 Arena Multimedia is the ?largest? multimedia training institute in Asia, having trained over 150,000 students since it was founded. This local exhibition (established four years ago) was an appetiser to what is taught at the institute, with over 100 students showcasing their works.

 Whilst digital art may be accepted in a popular sense, it is still not widely accepted in the fine arts establishment. Said A.D. Singh, head of Arena?s Chowringhee centre: ?This type of art is coming up strongly. We want people to understand the possibilities of digital art.? 

 However, he added that ?digital art is still in its nascent stage? and maybe viewed as a more established art form a couple of years down the line.

 Manish Srivastava, regional head of Arena Multimedia, was also optimistic about the future of digital art. ?We are trying to make people aware that art need not only be accomplished by conventional methods. More and more avenues are opening up for students of Arena. I think it will be accepted more by the next generation.?

 The progress of Arena is indicative of changing attitudes ? as of now, the company has 56 per cent of the market share.

 An expert panel, including art collector Reena Lath and cartoonist and satirist Arthur Cardozo, will judge this year?s exhibition. Part of the proceeds from the sales will go to South Calcutta Ananda Niketan Home, a school for the mentally-challenged.

 Budding band

 Kunal, Arghya, Mrinmoy, Somak, Shibankar and Moumita ? a motley crew of six, they seem to be no different from any other group of college students. But these youngsters have musical talents that mark them out from the rest.

 February 24 witnessed the launch of Blendz, a fusion band based on Indian classical music. 

 Blendz is the brainchild of santoor maestro Tarun Bhattacharya, with his disciple Kunal on the santoor, Arghya as the percussionist, and Mrinmoy, Somak and Shibankar on the tabla, sarod and the keyboard, respectively. Moumita, the only female member, is the vocalist.

 All the band members are well established young artistes in their own right and have numerous individual performances and awards to their credit. The desire to create a fusion of Indian classical with western music is what brought them together. 

 Mentor Bhattacharya said: ?Today?s generation prefers the Bollywood dhamaka music to traditional classical music. In order to bring them back to their own music, we have produced our own compositions that are based on Indian ragas but have western beats.?

 Appreciating the band?s efforts, the function?s chief guest, Bikram Ghosh, added: ?Indian classical music is the right place to start.? He added that the boys ?seemed to be in practise and willing to practice? which is a good thing?.

 Overall, the newly-formed band seemed to have a lot of potential. But as the tabla player pointed out: ?They need to practise a little more, the hands need to move a little faster.? 

 The evening ended with a scintillating performance by Ghosh.

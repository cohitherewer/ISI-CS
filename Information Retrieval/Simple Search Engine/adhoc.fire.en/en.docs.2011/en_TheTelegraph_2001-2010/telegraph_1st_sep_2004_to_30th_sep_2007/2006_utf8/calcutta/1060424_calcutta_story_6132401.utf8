What: Art for Giving, an exhibition of paintings 

and sculptures. 

 Where: The Palladian Lounge at the Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

 When: Till May 5, from 10 am to 8 pm.

 The ambience: With wooden flooring, Venetian blinds and jazz notes floating in the air, the evening of the inaguration on April 20 was perfectly set up. A well-stocked bar kept the guests busy and a wonderful display of paintings kept the art connoisseurs going. Author Taslima Nasreen, the guest of honour, was also presented a portrait by Kazi Anirban. 

 After Jeffrey Menezess musical renditions, the stage was set for a treat by singer Anjum Katyal. She enthralled guests with her signature Blues and she also belted out popular tracks like Dont Cry For Me Argentina and Jesus Christ Superstar.

 The exhibition: Presented by Spandan Art Gallery, the exhibition is in aid of Hope Foundation, Calcutta. Some of the participating artists include Kartick Pyne, Kazi Anirban, Rabin Mondal, Suhas Roy and Sanatan Dinda. 

 Voiceover: Art of Giving is our effort to send out the message that art is not the prerogative of only the rich and famous. Instead, pieces of art should be accessible to everybody, said Keshav Roy from Spandan Art Gallery.

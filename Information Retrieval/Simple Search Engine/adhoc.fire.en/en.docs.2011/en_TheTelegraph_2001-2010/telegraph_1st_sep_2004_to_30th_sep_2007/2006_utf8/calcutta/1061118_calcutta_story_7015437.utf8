 Talks on progress of French science 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Four lecture sessions are being organised in the city to acquaint the academic community, as also the common man, with the front-level research being carried out in France.

 The first lecture of the series, titled French Science Today, was held on Friday at MP Birla Planetarium. 

 Partice Courvalin, head of French National Centre for Antibiotics and Antibacterial Agents Unit, Institut Pasteur, spoke on the resistance of bacteria to antibiotics.

 The other three lectures being organised by MP Birla Institute of Fundamental Research, in association with the French embassy and the the French Association (formerly Alliance Francaise) are scheduled for November 22, December 7 and 19.

 The speakers will include Michel Waldschmidt, professor at Paris VI (Universite Pierre et Marie Curie), Srinivas V. Kaveri, director of research, INSERM U430, Institut des Cordeliers, Paris, and Alain Aspect, head of Atom Optics Group, Institut d Optique. The topics will cover microbiology, mathematics, immunology and quantum mechanics.

 The programme will enable both researchers and ordinary people to know about the latest scientific developments in France, said Debiprosad Duari, director, research and academics, MP Birla Planetarium.

 Students and researchers in the city most often have to surf the Net for their research material. Lectures of this kind will provide them with enough material for their research and give them a chance to interact with internationally-renowned scientists, he added.

 Exhibitions and film shows have also been lined up as part of the awareness programme. The lectures are open to all.

 Across the political divide, Bengalees on either side of the Bengal-Bangladesh border compulsively feel the tug of emotional bonds that binds them together and lends them their exclusive identity. Bengal Chromosome, the ongoing art exhibition, explores the focal theme of bonding as a means to rediscover and rejuvenate the ties of friendship that lie embedded in the language and culture of both countries. The show has been organised with the firm conviction that no matter how varied and complex the art of the two Bengals, artists on both sides of the border share cultural genetics as the mainstay of their creative impulse. Participating artists include Aditya Basak, Bijon Chowdhury, Ganesh Pyne, Jogen Chowdhury, Lalu Prasad Shaw, Paritosh Sen, Prakash Karmakar, Shanu Lahiri, Shuvaprasanna and Subroto Gangopadhyay (from Bengal) and Aminul Islam, Kamrul Hassan, Mahmudul Haque, Nasreen Begum, Sayed Enayet and Swapan Chowdhury (from Bangladesh).

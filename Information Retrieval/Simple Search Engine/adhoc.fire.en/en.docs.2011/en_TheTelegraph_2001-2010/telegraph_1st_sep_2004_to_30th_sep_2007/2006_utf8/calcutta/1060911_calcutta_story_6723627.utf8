 Epic parody

 For long, Sukumar Rays Laxmaner Shaktishel has been regarded as simply a childrens text. This evenings performance attempts to reinterpret Rays classic to fit these chaotic times of international war and transitory peace. It presents a brilliant satire on the farcical nature of war and the ludicrous motives that drive the powers-that-be. As irrational as games played by children, war is made fun of in the play, and thus uses childrens toys as props and games as motifs. Though its set and production design may initially shock traditional viewers, the play remains as hilarious as its original. Memories of violence and terrorism loom large throughout, and the laughter is sometimes that of bitter derision at the absurdity of it all. Interesting parallels can also be drawn with many important figures of the modern world; capricious political leaders, dare-devil commandos and even WWF champions. Direction: Joyraj Bhattacharjee.

 Driver let off in lakh loot

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Hours after Swaraj Das was robbed of Rs 1 lakh by an armed duo, the police released his driver, Jagdish Shaw, unable to find any lead from his statements. None of the suspects has yet been arrested either.

 Shaw was released from Muchipara police station late on Monday, but an officer was set up to shadow him. That is the only way of picking up clues about his associates and the places he frequents, sleuths claimed.

 ?It?s a mystery why Shaw did not stop the car somewhere between Salt Lake (the bank from which Das withdrew the money was in Sector V of the township) and Sealdah. More curiously, his injuries are superficial, though Das was seriously hurt,? said a senior officer of the police station.

 The Das family, on its part, is not really hopeful of recovering the money. Rather, it wants to be left alone, having lost hopes pinned on police.

 ?Yesterday evening, my brother went to Bidhannagar (North) police station to lodge a complaint, as the bank is under its jurisdiction,? Swaraj?s brother Sabuj said on Tuesday. But the officers refused to take the complaint. He then went all the way to Sealdah and lodged the complaint with Muchipara thana. Our money is lost and we are not prepared to be harassed any more by cops.?

 On Monday morning, Swaraj, a retired officer of the state fisheries department, had gone to the State Bank of India branch and withdrawn Rs 1 lakh from his son-in-law Manas?s account. The money in his trouser pockets, he was returning home in his car when the two youths intercepted him. 

 Pointing a knife and a razor at him, they got into the car, ordered Shaw to drive on and assaulted both him and Swaraj, before demanding the money.

 They got off and walked away when the car ran out of fuel on the Sealdah flyover.

 Debt death toll mounts

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Debt trap has claimed yet another life.

 Unable to repay the loan he had taken for his childrens education, Krishna Chandra Behra, 42, a Group D employee of the public works department, committed suicide on Tuesday afternoon by hanging himself at his Watgunge residence.

 Behras son Alok is studying at Durgapur Engineering College. His two daughters, aged 12 and six, are students of a local school.

 Behra had borrowed a huge amount from several persons to meet the educational expenses of his children. He had been suffering from acute depression as he could not pay back his debtors, said Krishnendu Sarkar, officer-in-charge of Watgunge police station.

 Behra had recently started drinking. In his suicide note addressed to his wife, he wrote: I will not drink any more. I am going very far.

 Around 11.30 am, Behra had an altercation with his wife over his drinking habits. After a while, he entered his room and bolted the door. He came out half-an-hour later, went to the toilet and hanged himself.

 Wife Sarita noticed the body hanging from the ceiling of the toilet. Her cries brought the neighbours in and they alerted police.

 Alok is a good student. He comes home every six months. We have informed him about the suicide, officer-in-charge Sarkar said.

 Behras neighbours were too shocked to react. We could not believe it. He was a nice person and spent whatever he had to educate his children. He wanted his son to become a successful engineer, said Arman Ali, a neighbour.

 Behra even worked at a local market after office to support his family. He was a responsible father, said another neighbour.

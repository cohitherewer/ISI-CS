 Footwear chemicalcause of allergy

 SANJAY MANDAL

 Chemicals used in footwear are behind a rapidly-spreading allergy in the city, a recent study has revealed.

 Institute of Allergic and Immunologic Skin Diseases, Calcutta, has found after a survey that adhesives, colours and other chemicals used in shoes are behind footwear dermatitis, a form of allergy. 

 ?It is better to wear stitched shoes than those that use adhesives. Those who do not wear socks should be careful about the colourants used,? said Sanjay Ghosh, medical director of the institute. ?The best way to prevent footwear dermatitis is to wear socks. The disease is more prevalent among women because most of them do not wear socks.?

 The socks should be light-coloured and not made of synthetic material, Ghosh added.

 Symptoms of footwear dermatitis are similar to those of eczema. The disease is chronic and often not cured by medicines. A change of shoes along with drugs, however, helps. Doctors said since the disease is difficult to diagnose, the patient often suffers for years. 

 According to the study, 62 per cent of the patients of footwear dermatitis are women. 

 Potassium dichromate (used in leather processing), cobalt chloride (used in metal buckles and eyelets), epoxy resin (shoe adhesives), black rubber mix, nickel, colophony (polishing agent) and formaldehyde (polish used on plastic shoes) are some of the chemicals behind the disease. 

 ?Those who wear slippers and sandals should be careful about the straps, which should ideally be thin to minimise the area of contact with the skin,? warned Ghosh. ?Shoes with deep colours should be avoided,? he advised.

 The inner lining of children?s shoes have rubberised clothes or rexin that cause footwear dermatitis. 

 ?The disease is becoming common among schoolchildren, who have to wear shoes for long hours. Their skin is vulnerable to allergy and infection,? opined city-based dermatologist Ashok Ghosal. 

 Footwear dermatitis can lead to leukoderma, a white patch on skin, he added.

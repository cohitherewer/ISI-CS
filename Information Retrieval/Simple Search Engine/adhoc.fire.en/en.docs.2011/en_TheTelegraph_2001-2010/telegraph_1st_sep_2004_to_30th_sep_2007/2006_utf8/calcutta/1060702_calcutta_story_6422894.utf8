 Don?t play 

 doctor to your dog

 I was in my chamber on a Friday 

 in February this year when a person stepped in with a golden 

 retriever puppy. The dog was breathing its last and it died 

 before I could do anything. But from what the owner narrated 

 to me, I realised the cause of death. Only two days ago, 

 the gentleman had returned home after a short tour. The 

 moment he entered the house, the puppy jumped on him, fell 

 to the ground and hurt himself. Without consulting a vet, 

 the owner administered Combiflam to lessen the puppy?s pain.

 After three doses, the puppy began 

 to walk normally, but started vomiting from midnight. In 

 the morning, he began throwing up blood. That was when the 

 gentleman brought him to me, but it was already too late. 

 Self-medication was the cause of the golden retriever?s 

 death. Before you give any medicine to your pet, always 

 ask your vet, otherwise it could turn fatal for your 

 loved one.

 Painkiller: Certain drugs 

 are very harmful for pets. Common painkillers like Combiflam, 

 Diclofenac, Valcox and Aceclofenac cause severe gastric 

 irritation if given in overdose, on an empty stomach or 

 without an antacid. This could cause severe vomiting, even 

 leading to death.

 A tip: In case of an emergency, 

 you can administer Arnica (homoeopathy) or paracetamol and 

 then see the vet.

 Deworming: Periodic de-worming 

 is very essential for your pets. Some people administer 

 de-worming medicine without consulting vets. An overdose 

 can damage your pet?s liver and trigger vomiting, while 

 an under-dose can develop a resistance to the drug.

 A tip: Albendazol reduces 

 roundworm infection, while Praziquantel is effective for 

 tapeworm infection.

 Growth: Vitamins and minerals 

 are essential for your puppy?s growth, but too much calcium 

 intake can cause resorption of calcium from bones, leading 

 to bending of bones and weakening of skeletal muscles.

 A tip: Give medicines that 

 have a calcium phosphorus balance of 2:1.

 Body odour: Some hairy 

 dogs suffer from bad odour during the monsoons. People usually 

 try to give their puppies a bath with shampoo to get rid 

 of the smell. But the more you bathe the dog, the stronger 

 the stench will be because the high humidity doesn?t allow 

 the hair roots to dry. So, fungal infection forms easily 

 causing bad smell and hair fall

 A tip: In such cases, use 

 a dog shampoo or a herbal shampoo. Use anti-fungal powder 

 and stop bathing them frequently.

 Ticks: Ticks are one of 

 the major problems for pets during the rainy season. Pet 

 owners usually use Asantol, Cypermethrin, Sevin to remove 

 ticks. But if your pet licks itself and swallows some of 

 these medicines, it turns poisonous. The symptoms in such 

 cases are severe salivation, convulsions and vomiting. If 

 your pet shows any of these, take it immediately to the 

 vet and get an Atropine injection administered.

 A tip: If your pet shows 

 these symptoms, feed him the white of raw eggs.

 And please don?t give chocolates 

 to your pet. Chocolate contains Theobromin that causes vomiting, 

 restlessness and cardiac failure.

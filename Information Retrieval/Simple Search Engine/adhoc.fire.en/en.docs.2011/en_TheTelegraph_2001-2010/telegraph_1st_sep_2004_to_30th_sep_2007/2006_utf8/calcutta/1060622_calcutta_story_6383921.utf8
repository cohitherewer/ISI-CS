 What do wives of tycoons do when their husbands come to Calcutta to talk business? They spend hours browsing and buying jewellery.

 At least that?s what Neeta Ambani did the whole of Wednesday afternoon, while husband Mukesh was busy making business calls.

 Neeta, the elder bahu of the Reliance empire, spent a long time at Satramdas Dhalamal on Park Street, with a friend.

 ?She is a regular client and since she was coming down to Calcutta, she decided to have a look at my couture line,? said Raj Mahtani, proprietor of the store set up in 1925.

 ?She picked up about 15 to 20 pieces ? all small by her standards ? and ordered for a few important large pieces that I will be preparing for her,? added the couture jeweller who recently designed the wedding line for Kiran Rao, better known as Mrs Aamir Khan.

 The pieces that Neeta picked up on Wednesday included earrings, pendants, bracelets and long necklaces made of table-cut diamonds, rubilites, emeralds and rubies.

 ?She is particularly fond of my Raj Mahtani couture line. She has a very classic jewellery taste with an eye for simple but important styles. She hates in-your-face jewellery,? explained Mahtani.

 Neeta Ambani ended up spending more time at the 12J Park Street jewellery address than she did in the Presidential Suite of ITC Sonar Bangla Sheraton amp; Towers.

 The Ambanis were checked into the 1,800- sq-ft suite, but Mukesh spent hours at Writers? Buildings, talking investment with Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and then environment (one of his pet passions) with tourism minister Manabendra Mukherjee.

 Neeta stuck to her jewellery date, caught up with a few friends, and headed for dinner at the Neotias, before flying back to Mumbai.

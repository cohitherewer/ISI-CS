 The futility of dreams and lofty ideals in a world ridden with competition and conflicting interests is the theme of Feriwalaar Mrityu. The Bengali adapatation of Arthur Miller?s The Death of a Salesman, the play?s protagonist, Amalkanti, is an erstwhile smart and confident salesman, now reduced to a shadow of his former self. While selling dreams to customers all his life, he had dreamt of happiness and contentment in his own life as well. But the unfortunate peddler of dreams did not know that destiny had other plans for him. Now old and infirm, he regrets the withering away of the vigour and intense activity of the past that he held so dear. Wistfully dreaming of that time, he refuses to acknowledge the harsh reality of his present, continuing to labour under the belief that better days are ahead. His pride prevents him from reaching out to his near and dear ones, and he retreats further into a shell of loneliness. Finally, he seeks refuge in death, which alone can release him from his torment. Direction: Rudraprasad Sengupta.

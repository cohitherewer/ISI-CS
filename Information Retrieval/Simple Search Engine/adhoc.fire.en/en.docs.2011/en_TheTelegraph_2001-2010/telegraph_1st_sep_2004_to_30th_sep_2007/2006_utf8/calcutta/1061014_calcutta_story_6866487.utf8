 - Residential training centre keeps budding managers in lap of Nature

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 Brainstorming business sessions in the midst of a green sprawl reminiscent of an ancient gurukul. Learning not by rote but through lively interactions between the teacher and the taught. Seminars and workshops in rooms given a coat of chalk (khari mati) paint... Welcome to Future Corporate Ashram (FCA), a residential training centre for executives that will throw open its doors in Sonarpur next month.

 Part of a B-school run by the city-based Future Group of Institutions, the ashram with a difference has already enrolled a batch of young executives from IBM, IDBI, Hutch, Usha Martin, Exide, Vesuvius and CESC for stress-free training.

 The ashram-like ambience of the FCA the serene surrounding acting as the stress-buster will help young professionals brush up their skills better than in any other formal setting, said Mousumi Ghosh, director, Future Business School. The response among companies is very encouraging. More than 15 groups have approached us for block bookings.

 The nine-acre campus boasts an engineering and a management college. Built at a cost of Rs 10 crore-plus, the accommodation at the ashram can match a four-star hotel, claim officials.

 There will be a 24-hour computer centre, a business library, audio and video projection facilities, round-the-clock Net connectivity and seminar halls with capacity ranging from 12 to 1,200.

 For fitness and leisure, the trainees will have access to meditation, yoga, gym and even angling. There will be dedicated jogging tracks.

 The secretarial back-office support includes printing, document binding and reprography. The seminar and conference halls, the classrooms, the lobbies and lounges... the entire building will make one feel close to nature, said Ghosh.

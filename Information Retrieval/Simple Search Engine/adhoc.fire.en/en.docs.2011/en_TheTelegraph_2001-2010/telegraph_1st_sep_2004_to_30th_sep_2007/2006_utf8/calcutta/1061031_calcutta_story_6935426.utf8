What: Halloween Nite. 

Where: Underground at Hotel Hindusthan International 

(HHI).

When: Saturday, 9 pm onwards.

The bash: Sticking to the theme decor, there 

were broomsticks, pumpkin lanterns and glow sticks strewn across the nightclub. 

Adding to the spooky ambience were the bartenders in black, who went around with 

special blood-red cocktails.

Prizes were given out to guests who stood out in the 

crowd with their weird looks heavy metallic chains, chunky earrings.

The music by DJ Anshul had a bit of everything house, 

hip-hop, retro as well as current Hindi chartbusters. The theme party, of course, 

continued till the early hours of Sunday.

Voiceover: We organise theme events to 

promote interaction with our guests. Though the concept of Halloween is not so 

popular here and we did not expect guests to turn up in Halloween costumes, the 

party was a great hit, said Underground event manager Amit Hathiramani.

 Dancers perform at Big Ben on Saturday night.

Ghosts galore

What: Halloween Nite.

Where: Big Ben at The Kenilworth.

When: Saturday, 10 pm onwards.

The bash: The fear factor as well as the temperature 

ran high as the nightclub resembled a graveyard with skeletons coming alive. Spirits 

came alive on the dance floor as couples in Halloween costumes shocked the crowd. 

Ghosts, pumpkins and a heady mix of sounds jazzed up the night.

 New rule for new schools

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 To set up a private school, one will now need to inform the government in advance about details of the staff recruitment procedure the institution will follow.

 School education minister Partha De said in the Assembly on Monday that the government would not issue the no-objection certificate for setting up a private school if the details were not available.

 The minister said the founders would have to clarify on what basis they would recruit teachers and other employees, the pay-scales offered, provisions of job security and whether there will be any internal dispute-redress platform.

 Earlier, for a no-objection certificate, the authorities were only required to state whether the salaries of the teachers and other employees would be on a par with those in state-aided institutions.

 They were, however, also required to state whether the institution had adequate land, spacious classrooms, proper laboratories and sufficient books in the library. 

 De said the new rule would be in force till the bill, seeking to empower the government to exert minimum control over all private schools, is enacted.Till the act is formulated, the private schools will be required to give the declaration for getting a no-objection certificate.

 De reiterated that the bill would be framed on the basis of suggestions from the schools.

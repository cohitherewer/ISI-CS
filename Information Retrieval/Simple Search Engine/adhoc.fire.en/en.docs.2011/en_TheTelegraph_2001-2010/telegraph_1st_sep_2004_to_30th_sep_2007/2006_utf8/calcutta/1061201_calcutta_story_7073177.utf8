The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 CHEERS FOR DADA, JEERS FOR DIDI

First, the good news: Sourav Ganguly is back in the reckoning. Then, the bad news: Mamata Banerjee is back on the rampage. 

 Thursday began with a loud cheer for Souravs comeback call, and ended with louder groans for Mamatas 12-hour bandh call. Metro asked a few celebrities and students about Dada and Didi...

 Inam Hussain Mullick,

 student

 Im very happy about Souravs comeback. Whatever treatment had been meted out to him was completely based on politics and extremely unfair... Fridays bandh just reaffirms my opinion that I live in a city where nothing is ever going to change I refuse to be optimistic for no reason.

 Rituparna Sengupta,

 actress

 A bandh is never desirable. It 

 stops the whole flow of life. But Calcuttans should stay 

 calm and avoid any kind of aggression As for Sourav, Im 

 very happy that he has found his place in the team again.

 June, 

 actress

 Sourav being back is such great news, but instead, we have to watch vandalism on television. The focus has entirely shifted from Dada to Didi. Its really sad. The common people are the ones who end up suffering the most, and we should call a bandh to protest all bandhs. I am feeling terrible for all those who were involved in the AIDS Day walk which had to be called off because of Fridays bandh.

 Moon Moon Sen,

 actress 

 I speak on behalf of so many Calcuttans 

 who are just fed up with bandhs. I think the CM is the only 

 person trying to do something for the city, and every time 

 he takes a step forward, he is given a hard time. Im furious 

 about these petty bandhs. As for Sourav being back, Im 

 looking forward to nothing less than a 100!

 Bickram Ghosh,

 percussionist

 Calcutta has always been a study of contrasts. Its heartening to know that Sourav is back in the team and surely calls for celebration. But this bandh thing has brought everything to a standstill

 Paramita Chakraborty,

 student

 I have my sisters wedding and 

 the bandh means inconvenience... There is mixed feeling 

 for Dada. Maybe he should have stayed away to avoid further 

 manipulation.

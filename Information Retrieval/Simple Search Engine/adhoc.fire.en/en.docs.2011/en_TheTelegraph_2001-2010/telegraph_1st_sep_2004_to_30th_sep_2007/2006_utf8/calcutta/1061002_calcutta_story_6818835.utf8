Life

 look of the day

 While you pamper your sweet tooth or indulge in sindoor khela at the para pandal, dress up in your traditional best for the festive finale.

 Her

 The vermilion splash is the highlight of Dashami, so red is the colour of choice on Monday. While your mom and aunts will queue up in front of the idol for the final rituals in red-bordered white taant, you can opt for a sari too, but with a younger look and feel. 

 Swastika Mukherjee (left) gets ready for Dashami in a red matka silk sari by designer Sabyasachi Mukherjee.

 The red sari with gold border has a heavily-embroidered pallu with peacock and floral motifs. This has been paired with a black and gold polka-dotted blouse.

 Swastikas make-up matches the ethnic look. The eyes are done up in smoky black shadow and brickish-red outer contour with lots of kohl. The lips are pale bronze and the blush-on is brickish-brown, with gold shimmer all over the face. Her hair has been tied up in a low bun, after creating finger waves.

 For the mature woman past 35, the day calls for a traditional red-and-white combo. Designer Sunipa Samadder, however, has given the look a modern twist. Instead of the traditional red-and-white combination thats very common on Dashami, one can flaunt a newer version keeping the classic look intact, says Sunipa. 

She has dressed up Bidisha Bhaduri (right) in a beige sari with a red-and-black border, pairing it with a vermilion red corset with puffed sleeves to match the mood of the moment. The cotton-silk sari with herringbone weave and naksha border looks elegant, and has been draped in a way to give Bidisha height.

 The colour code is very festive and it also goes with the attitude and maturity of the wearer, adds Sunipa.

 Bidishas make-up includes wine and gold eye-shadow with kohl; warm brown blush; brick red lips; a round red bindi. Her hair has been piled up at the back with a bouffant.

 Him

 An out-and-out ethnic code is the demand of the day and Max Benitz (left) flaunts just that in a Sharbari Datta ensemble.

 A blue-green kurta has been embellished with brush paint and discharge print, worked upon with coloured zari. This has been teamed with a black churidar. The look is that of a collage and it lends depth to the wearers personality, says Sharbari.]

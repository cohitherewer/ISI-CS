 Five hours of incessant rain from dawn caused severe waterlogging in the city, especially in the north, on Sunday. (Picture of Camac Street on left by Pabitra Das)

 The lightning that accompanied the downpour claimed a life. Saheb Ali Sarder, 35, a resident of Baishnabghata Patuli, was struck by lightning at Banabitan, in Salt Lake. His companion, Sulekha Naskar, 24, is fighting for her life at NRS Hospital.

 The rain started around 4 am and settled to a drizzle after 9 am. The Dum Dum weather office recorded 110 mm of rain till 8.30 am. In south Calcutta, the downpour was less intense 20 mm of rain was recorded at Alipore.

 Most major roads in north and central Calcutta were under water till the afternoon. The waterlogging affected the Puja shopping plans of many.

 The Met office predicted heavy rain over the next 48 hours. We expect more rain over the next 48 hours in Gangetic West Bengal, including Calcutta. In some places, the rainfall will be heavy, an official stated on Sunday.

 A cyclonic circulation (an anti-clockwise movement of air) formed over north-west Bay of Bengal and adjoining West Bengal and Orissa coasts early on Sunday, according to the official. The monsoon, which was weak over Calcutta and the south Bengal districts for the past two days, has become active again, he added.

 Alarmed at the heavy rain, mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya and municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay visited the Calcutta Municipal Corporation headquarters on SN Banerjee Road to monitor the performance of the pumping stations. Our engineers have tried their best to drain out the accumulated water, said the mayor.

 Severe waterlogging was reported in the lanes on either side of Chittaranjan Avenue. There was knee-deep water on Madan Mohan Burman Street, Kailash Bose Street, Muktaram Babu Street, College Street, Amherst Street, Sukea Street and in Thanthania, Muraripukur and the Ram Mandir area for hours. 

 The stretch between Kankurgachhi and Ultadanga and parts of CIT Road, near Phoolbagan, were under six inches to a foot of water. In south Calcutta, there was significant waterlogging on Sarat Bose Road. 

 On the eastern fringes of the city, there was waterlogging in the Topsia-Tiljala-Kasba belt. However, with less traffic on the road, there was no serious snarl.

 The accumulated water could have been drained out faster if the high tide in the Hooghly had not set in, said the municipal commissioner.

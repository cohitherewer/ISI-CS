The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Gung-ho on court order

 - CAS cascade

 SUBHAJIT BANERJEE

 The next India-Pakistan One-dayer may only be available through a set-top box

 A strong stand from the court followed by a commitment from the Centre, and the much-troubled conditional access system (CAS) finally looks set to roll out in the metros.

 On Thursday, Delhi High Court ordered the government to implement CAS in Delhi, Mumbai and Calcutta ? Chennai already has it running ? by January 1, 2007.

 ?It?s good news and we are extremely happy with the order,? said D.S. Mehta, chairman of MSO CableComm. ?We were CAS- ready from Day 1 of operations with a digital headend and provisions for set-top boxes,? Mehta added. 

 The boxes enable viewers to choose and pay for only the channels they want to see.

 ?We are happy but cautious, as there have been announcements in the past but CAS was not implemented,? offered Amit Nag, CEO of Indian Cable Net, a unit of MSO SitiCable. 

 CableComm claimed to have a set-top box stock of around 5,000 and SitiCable nearly 600,000. 

 The MSOs are also planning add-on services, like pay-per-view and triple play ? combining phone, cable and Internet services through a single wire ? when CAS comes in.

 ?The confusion about CAS has cleared significantly since 2003. Chennai has shown how the system works and everyone realises that CAS is inevitable,? pointed out Mrinal Chatterjee, an operator.

 Despite the common anti-CAS allegation against them, broadcasters do not seem against the system, either. ?Our role is only in signing the fresh agreements with MSOs. They have to make all the preparations,? Anuj Gandhi, president of SET Discovery, told Metro from Mumbai.

 The industry is now awaiting the CAS notification from the government, due by July 31, which will clarify issues such as pricing and the phases in which the system will be rolled out in each metro.

 ?There?s a continuous feedback process between the government and stakeholders,? an MSO official said. Cable watchdog Trai has also written to city MSOs, seeking details of their CAS preparedness.

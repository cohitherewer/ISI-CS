 Midsummer magic

 A sequence from A Midsummer Night?s Dream. Picture by Rashbehari Das

 A British director grooming a 

 pan-Indian cast with nine languages thrown in to mouth Shakespeare?s 

 lines seemed a little suspect when the British Council announced 

 the arrival of A Midsummer Night?s Dream a few months 

 ago. Perhaps for all the confusion that usually follows 

 in the name of fusing cultures and especially since Midsummer 

 had the potential of blowing up Indian exotica. But 

 director Tim Supple knew his mind, and knew better.

 The Indo-UK venture came to Calcutta after touring Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai for a three-evening show at the Tollygunge Club last weekend. And Supple?s presentment of the play turned out to be a truly colourful and fascinating midsummer spectacle, very Indian and yet not so Indian.

 The three-hour drama began with a 15-minute walk from the Club house to a makeshift structure tucked far away on the sprawling green grounds, where a raised brick platform covered with red soil and open on three sides formed the stage. The backdrop was a bamboo structure meant to be the woods, which the agile actors climbed, vaulted and jumped from at various points for various reasons.

 To dispel the primary doubt, the medley of regional languages didn?t rob Midsummer of Shakespeare. Rather, much of the comedy?s flavour arose from the fact that the performers retained their individual acting styles to a large extent. So, Ashwatthama JD?s Peter Quince seemed the leader of a dehati team trying to put up a natak somewhere in rural India, and Ajay Kumar?s Puck a playful spirit from a non-English folktale. PR Jijoy?s Oberon and Prasanna Mahagamage?s Demetrius were distinctly different from any ?English? take on the roles. The setting, though, remained Athens.

 Not knowing languages didn?t pose a problem in grasping the flow (such dialogues seemed a bit tedious at most), largely for the involved, impassioned and co-ordinated acting. If Lysander professed his love in Bengali, Hermia and Helena reasoned in English, while Demetrius argued in Sinhalese.

 Given that Midsummer involves man-woman relationships at several levels ? the two pairs of lovers, the king and queen of fairies, the duke of Athens and the queen of Amazons ? Supple heightened the sensuous and physical qualities of the play supporting it with strong performances even from the minor characters. The actors were remarkably easy and spontaneous with the sexual overtones. Archana Ramaswamy?s overt body language of a horny Titania chasing the half-beast Nick Bottom was especially arresting as was her dance piece with Oberon blending kathak and martial arts to resolve their fight and bring harmony to the mortal world.

 For better results, the dual roles shared by Jijoy and Archana (Oberon-Titania and Theseus-Hippolyta, a common device with most Midsummer productions) should have been avoided. The role reversals lacked clarity.

 The play within a play was one of the most well executed portions of Supple?s Midsummer. Led by Nick Bottom, played by Joy Fernandes who showed an amazing sense of comic timing, the raucous banter of the rustic team preparing to stage a play before the duke of Athens had the spirits dangling from ropes and peering down at the mortals.

 Innovative and integral to the play was the use of stage and costumes, designed by Sumant Jayakrishnan. The love tangle between Helena, Hermia, Lysander and Demetrius in Act III, Scene II for one ? the mischievous Puck weaves a zigzag pattern with ropes to enmesh the four, make them run, tumble and try to hop out of the muddle.

 As the audiences laughed, squealed, clapped and gave a standing ovation to Supple and his team, it was clear that Shakespeare?s midsummer dream had been lived out to its fullest, vaulting barriers of language and locale.

 Next stop for this Midsummer 

 Night?s Dream ? Swan Theatre at Stratford-on-Avon in 

 June.

 Fright all right

 Gothic horror on stage has gone 

 the way of obsolescence, replaced in halls by the thrill-a-minute 

 possibilities that the silver screen provides through the 

 battery of special effects at its digital command. Consequently 

 it takes courage on Theatron?s part to produce Se, 

 a ghost story translated by Salil Bandyopadhyay from Stephen 

 Malatratt?s The Woman in Black, in turn dramatised 

 from Susan Hill?s novel. The choice is all the more unusual 

 because Bengali theatre has always shied away from scary 

 spectral stuff.

 There are other things to commend, 

 too. Often unexposed to current dramatic trends abroad, 

 the Bengali theatregoer can now see a play that has had 

 a very long run in London?s West End, since 1989. Malatratt?s 

 popularity has not exactly endeared him to critics, yet 

 the original succeeded on its own terms, with no spectacle 

 or extravagant technology, just a large hamper, a chair, 

 a coat stand and three actors. It preyed on that great vulnerable 

 spot in the human mind: the imagination. And director Saswati 

 Biswas faithfully follows the same technique.

 Mystery shrouds the remote house on a desolate beach in England where an old lady dies. Her lawyer in London sends a representative to collect all her papers. This man?s hair-raising experiences form the tale, told to an actor from whom he requests (in the most unlikely aspect of the plot) tips on how to narrate it credibly to his acquaintances. The final twist lies in the ending.

 With Badal Das?s shadowy but precise lighting (including a couple of baroque projections of Gothic architecture) and Kanishka Sarkar?s soundscape offering crucial backstage inputs, the test was to suggest as much as possible, rather than make things explicit, which invariably spoils the eerie fun.

 By and large, Biswas succeeds 

 directorially, though the pressure tells on her acting as 

 the leading man, which cannot match the variegated multiple 

 characterisations of her co-actor Asesh Chaudhuri. She could 

 have surrendered the main part, the better to control the 

 performances from outside. As the only other person on stage, 

 Chaiti Chaudhuri makes some chilling appearances.

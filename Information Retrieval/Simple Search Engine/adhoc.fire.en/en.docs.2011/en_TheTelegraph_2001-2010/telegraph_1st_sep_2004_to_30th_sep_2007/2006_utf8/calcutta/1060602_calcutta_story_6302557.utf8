 How can you not be nosy about people who are so fascinating to look at?? The confession of the editor of a top gossip magazine on camera says it all about the industry.

 As Brand Brangelina grows bigger with every hour that the baby spends shielded from the media, CNN gets ready to air a documentary, Chasing Angelina ? Paparazzi and Celebrity Obsession, that puts the spotlight on the legion of lensmen and columnists and publicists feeding grist to the gossip mill.

 Chasing Angelina (June 3, 11.30 am and 7.30 pm, and June 4, 11.30 am) starts off with a photographer camping outside Angelina Jolie?s house in Malibu. Word reaches that the actress is on the move. And the hunt begins. The engine ignites and the wireless crackles to life, exchanging location details with two others posted on the same mission ? a snap worth a bounty. With six celebrity magazines feeding a readership of 8.5 million-plus, there?s a fight for the best picture every week.

 The show takes in shots of an editors? meet where reports of ?Angelina not fitting into her clothes? are as important as the Indo-US nuclear deal. Then there is Larry Hackett, editor of People, ?salivating over a scoop that the Jolie camp has promised? him. Contacts count, and how.

 It is an intricate web of a world where stars, publicists and the paparazzi are tied in a symbiotic yet stormy relationship. The publicists guide celebrities through the media minefield and control a precious commodity ? access to stars. His influence is judged best in his absence. A case in point is Tom Cruise. Soon after he parted ways with Pat Kingsby, and hired his own sister, came the Oprah Winfrey show, where the world saw in disbelief how the famous ?Cruise control? had morphed to ?Couch control?.

 Why just the channels or the print media? A potent gateway for scandal is the gossip blog on the Net. Unlike the big houses, bloggers like Mark Lisanti have nothing to lose. Mark runs defamer.com from his small Los Angeles flat, occasionally grabbing a power lunch with an industry insider and scanning tabloids for tips. He does not get or need access to stars.

 To such hardcore paparazzi, photographers like Kevyn Major are ?a sell-out?. Major, who runs celebrity photo agency Wire Images, enjoys an official status, often solicited by stars. He is on the red carpet while the rest fight for shots from behind the velvet rope. Having started his lens life sneaking in backstage after rock shows, he learnt his lesson after guards of Robert Redford threatened him on a film set. Now he always asks before he clicks.

 While Major?s pictures sell for a flat price on his site, the real scoops are the sneak peeks. The Jennifer Aniston-Vince Vaughn liplock fetched upward of a quarter million dollars, while an exclusive of Brad Pitt and Angelina on an Africa beach was worth half a million. No wonder the chase for Angelina continues.

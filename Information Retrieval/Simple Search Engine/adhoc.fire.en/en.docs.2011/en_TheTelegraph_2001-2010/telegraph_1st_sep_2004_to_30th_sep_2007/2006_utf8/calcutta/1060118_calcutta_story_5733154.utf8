 Schoolgirls untraced 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Twenty-four hours have elapsed, but three teenage girls, all students of Class X, who went missing on Monday, have not returned home. Police, too, have not succeeded in collecting any information on their whereabouts.

 ?We could not sleep on Monday night,? cried Sani Ali, mother of one of the missing girls, Sedna Ali, at her Park Circus residence. ?We have informed police and are now waiting for word on my daughter?s whereabouts. We contacted police stations on Tuesday, but they could not offer any information.?

 Three girls, Sedna, Swagata Das of Topsia and Shreyashi Talukdar of Sodepur, left their respective homes, saying they were going to school. 

 When they did not return till late on Monday evening, their anxious parents called up their schools. They were told that the three girls had not come to school.

 Later, a missing diary was lodged with Beniapukur police station. The detective department took charge of the investigation on Tuesday.

 Police said the three girls had disappeared together. 

 ?They are good friends and have known each other for the past couple of years,? said Gyanwant Singh, deputy commissioner (I) of police, detective department. 

 ?Swagata and Shreyashi are from Pratt Memorial School, on AJC Bose Road, and Sedna is a student of The Academy in the Park Street area. But we found out that earlier, Sedna used to study in Pratt Memorial. She took admission in her present school in 2005,? Singh added.

 Sani said: ?Sedna told me that since she was going for a school picnic, she would be a little late. Later, when I contacted the school authorities, I was told that there had been no such programme.?

 According to a teacher of The Academy, ?since last December, Sedna had attended school for barely two to three days. She would spend a lot of time with those who had taken admission from Pratt Memorial?.

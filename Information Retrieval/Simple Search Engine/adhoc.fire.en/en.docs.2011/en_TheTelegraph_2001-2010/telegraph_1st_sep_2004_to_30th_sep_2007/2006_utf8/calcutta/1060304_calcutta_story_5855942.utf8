The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Repair route to car flow 

 - Road restoration comprehensive plan with eye on checking mishap count

 OUR BUREAU

 Today?s traffic pain will intensify, but only for tomorrow?s travel gain of the Calcutta commuter.

 This is the assurance from the Calcutta Police as it draws up a Comprehensive Plan for Improving City Traffic.

 In keeping with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s promise of delivering a new traffic system, the police brass has drawn up an elaborate plan aimed at ensuring smoother flow of vehicles and lesser mishaps on roads.

 ?We are not just looking at improving the average vehicular speed. Once roads are repaired and tracks concretised, we also hope to cut down on the number of road accidents? Even vehicles will need less maintenance then,? said deputy commissioner (traffic) Javed Shamim.

 While the ongoing repairs on five major roads will end by March 31, restoration of seven thoroughfares will begin following clearances .

 The transport department has included three more roads to its repair list ? 940 m of Kidderpore Road, Gray Street (from Hatibagan to Rabindra Sarani) and a 100-m stretch of Rashbehari Avenue near Bijon Setu. 

 ?Fixing this additional 2.15-km stretch will cost us another Rs 7.20 crore,? said transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury.

 Apart from road repair, the Comprehensive Plan will also focus on setting up pedestrian and median barriers on busy roads, synchronisation of traffic signals, introduction of night traffic patrolling at certain vital intersections and setting up bus bays along key roads.

 Pedestrian barriers will be erected at:

 Eastern side of Strand Road

 Kohinoor Market (Topsia) Circular Garden Reach Road

 Tollygunge Circular Road, between Deshapran Sashmal Road and Tollygunge Road

 Western side of APC Roy Road (northern side of flyover to Justice Manmatha Mukherjee Road)

 Median dividers will be set up at:

 Narkeldanga Main Road, from Phoolbagan island to railway underbridge

 Vivekananda Road, between Amherst Street and Bidhan Sarani

 BT Road, between Raja Manindra Road and Sinthee crossing

 Dum Dum Road

 Synchronised signals will be installed at:

 Free School Street and Park Street crossing

 Park Street and JL Nehru Road crossing

 BBD Bag, north-east corner.

 The Comprehensive Plan also suggests formation of two committees to monitor illegal roadside garages and bus stops.

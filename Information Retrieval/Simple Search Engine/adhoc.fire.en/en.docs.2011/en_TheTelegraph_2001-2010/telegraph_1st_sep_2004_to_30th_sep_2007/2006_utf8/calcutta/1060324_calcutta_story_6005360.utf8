 Get set to make a splash on the seaside this summer. Nicco Parks on Thursday unveiled Wet-O-Wild Beach Tropicana, a water park where the waves come tumbling ashore in a muffled roar reminiscent of the deep.

 ?We?ve brought Puri to Calcutta,? smiled group chairman Rajive Kaul. If not Puri, it certainly approximates to Digha, with palm trees lining the boundary wall.

 The beach, with a sand-finished surface, is a quarter-kilometre walk. Beach chairs are laid out under thatched sheds. 

 The wave pool is spread across 40,000 sq ft, of which 28,000 sq ft is the water carpet. At the deep end, the water stands at 8 ft. So, lifejackets provided against a security deposit of Rs 150 are a must for tots. Eight life-guards keep a lookout, as well.

 The backdrop is a sheer cliff rising up to about 50 ft. From it, a waterfall comes tumbling down in three levels to drench the bathers below. One can even get up close to the big splash by climbing up to the first level. 

 A bit further off, a rain dome provides a steady sprinkle, both from a maze of nozzles above and below. ?This area is the floor for rain dance,? said Abhijit Dutta, senior vice-president, operations and projects. 

 Next to it, is the kids? play area, surrounded by a moat-like lazy river. It is the hub of sprinklers and mini slides of all shapes and sizes. There is even a bucket at the top of the central structure, which turns to a side to dump the accumulated water on revellers below wading into two ft water.

 Adjacent to it, four body slides come hurtling down from a height of 55 ft. ?It was a great ride,? smiled Yashovardhan Tagore of St Joseph?s School after a trip down the super spiral slide. ?It?s a great place to beat the heat,? gushed Ima Sarkar, a student from Salt Lake.

 Bathers can rent beachwear and towels on the spot, with the beach having its own laundry. Entry to Wet O Wild has been pegged at Rs 150, while a ticket to Nicco Park costs another Rs 50.

 ?Our USP is the quality of the water,? emphasised Kaul. A tie-up has been inked with Ion Exchange, leaders in water treatment, whereby the entire 3,000-cubic-metre volume will be recirculated through an elaborate filtering system every two hours. ?The findings of the laboratory will be put up on a display board, so that people know about the quality of water when they wade in,? Arijit Sengupta, CEO and director, Nicco Parks and Resorts.

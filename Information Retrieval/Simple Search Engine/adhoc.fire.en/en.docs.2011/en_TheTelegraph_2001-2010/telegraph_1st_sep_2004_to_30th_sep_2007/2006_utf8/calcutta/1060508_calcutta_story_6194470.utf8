The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Lack of teeth trips green body

 BISWAJIT MUKHERJEE, senior law officer, West Bengal Pollution Control Board, met readers of The Telegraph last week to answer their queries. Participants included Achyutananda Ghosh, Jayanta Sthanapati, S.M. Sharfuddin, Jitendra Nath Das, Md Aamiruzzaman, Ashok Barman, S. Adhikari, Sourish Misra, Pulin Sen Sharma, Biswaranjan Bose and Shantiram Chatterjee

Pulin Sen Sharma: I live in the Golf Green area. Of late, we have found it difficult to sleep at night due to the continuous blowing of horns by private buses parked illegally in front of our building. The toxic fumes emitted by the vehicles during their servicing at roadside garages that have sprung up in the area have also made our lives miserable. Is there any way we can protect ourselves from this menace?

 We have been getting similar complaints from other city pockets. I am sorry but the pollution control board (PCB) cannot help you in this regard at the moment. The permission to ply on a particular route is given by the regional transport authority (RTA). To make the buses park elsewhere, you have to approach the RTA.

Md Aamiruzzaman: If the PCB can impose a ban on the bursting of crackers inside housing estates and order industrial complexes to close down, why is it so helpless against private buses?

 Matters related to the private buses are looked after by the transport department. Even auto-emission checking is under the department?s control. A discussion is on to involve the PCB in these matters. We can check the emission through factory chimneys and ask the authorities to take remedial action. But as of now, we cannot check vehicular emission. 

Jayanta Sthanapati: Birla Industrial and Technological Museum has been making people aware of the importance of protecting the environment through various programmes and workshops. How can we make people aware of their rights? Is there a book on the rights of citizens in respect of the environment?

 In 1992, the PCB published a book on law and environment. Besides, books on environmental law and court orders are published by the board regularly. In addition, there are handbooks for the use of district magistrates, law students, police, common people and the NGOs. Moreover, information on environmental laws is available on the PCB website.

Jayanta Sthanapati: The common people do not like to complain about violation of pollution-control laws fearing harassment and intimidation. Do you entertain anonymous complaints?

 We entertain anonymous complaints. If a complaint is found to be valid after verification we follow it up, without bothering to find out who it came from. There is a high court order allowing the PCB to withhold the disclosure of a complainant?s name.

 Once a person was forced out of his village by someone he had complained against. We resettled him in the village and entrusted the officer-in-charge of the local police station with the responsibility of ensuring his safety.

Ashok Barman: We, in the business administration department of Scottish Church College, have come across cases of violation of PCB orders. What is the rate of compliance with PCB orders?

 The best way to gauge the rate of compliance is to calculate how many complaints are coming back to us after the orders are issued. About 90 per cent of the orders are complied with. There are three categories of businessmen who violate the PCB order. In the first category are those who instal faulty anti-pollution devices due to ignorance. The second group delays its installation deliberately. The third category of businessmen instal anti-pollution devices following PCB directives but are reluctant to run the gadget to save on power expenditure and maintenance cost. For the third category, we have produced an interlocking device with the help of Tata Consultancy Services. Production will not be possible in those factories without use of anti-pollution devices.

Sourish Misra: Some businessmen have started to serve hot rasogollas and curry in plastic packets. Plastic cups are used to serve hot tea in hospitals, trains and even in Writers? Buildings. Isn?t this practice injurious to health?

 It is very harmful to consume food from plastic containers. Because of the heat, cancer causing chemicals get mixed with the food items. There is an order by the chief secretary banning use of plastic cups to serve tea.

 The 95-year-old Budge Budge Public Library, which once organised a civic reception for Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, is now being rented out for marriages and social functions. The library has been in a dilapidated state for some time and the number of members has dropped from 4,000 to 700, mainly due to lack of facilities and books.

 ?Faced with a dearth of funds and spiralling expenditure, we had no alternative but to start letting out our halls,? said Ganesh Ghosh, president of the library managing committee and former chairman of Budge Budge municipality. ?The readers are very unhappy over the poor facilities and leaking pipes and ceilings. There are no new books and the old books are in tatters.? 

 ?The authorities could have, instead, started computer classes, job-oriented training or short-term courses. It is tough to concentrate with the music blaring,? observed Tapas Roy, a regular visitor to the library.

 Started by local educationists in a rented house in 1911, the library shifted to the current premises in 1957. Former chief minister BC Roy did the honours. The library, once popular for its collection of over 18,000 books, periodicals and journals, languished due to negligence and lack of funds.

 ?Despite letting out the halls for social gatherings and marriages, we earn little, not enough to maintain such a large library. We can?t buy books and journals, forget about developing infrastructure,? admitted Ghosh.

 The monthly subscription is just Rs 2.50, but many readers do not pay up on time. ?In addition, we have three paid employees,? stated librarian Shankar Bag. 

 Local Trinamul Congress legislator Ashok Deb had donated Rs 1.4 lakh from the local area development fund. He has also asked state library affairs minister Nemai Mal for money, but no offer has materialised yet. 

 Bhulu Kanti Sarkar, chairman of the municipality and a local CPM leader, has suggested handing over of the library to the government for better upkeep and maintenance.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Court extends breather for trucks

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta High Court on Wednesday extended its earlier interim order and asked the state government to renew licences of pre-1990 commercial vehicles to ply within the Calcutta Metropolitan Area (CMA), till disposal of the case.

 Justice Jayanta Biswas completed the hearing of the case filed by the Bengal Bus Syndicate, challenging a government notification banning commercial vehicles more than 15 years old within the metropolitan area.

 In a bid to cut down on auto emission, the Regional Transport Authority in July last year had announced that permits of all commercial vehicles registered before January 1, 1990, would not be renewed further. 

 The transport department had set December 31 as the deadline for phasing out the vehicles. While autorickshaws and taxis were allowed to switch to LPG to ply within the CMA, owners of buses and trucks were asked to replace their vehicles with new Bharat Stage II-compliant ones.

 Challenging the validity of the notification, syndicate counsel Dilip Samanta argued that the state government did not have the authority to stop plying of vehicles on the grounds of their age. ?The power rests with the Centre.?

 The lawyer might have taken a cue from a high court order ? following an attempt to phase out pre-1975 vehicles from the CMA ? clarifying that the state government was not authorised to fix age limits for vehicles. 

 This time, however, the state government has empowered itself to decide on the age limit by amending the West Bengal Motor Vehicles Rules.

 A month ago, in the initial stage of the case filed by the Syndicate, the court had passed an interim order asking the government to renew the permits of pre-1990 vehicles till January 27.

 Appearing for the state, advocate-general Balai Ray submitted on Wednesday that the government had not banned pre-1990 vehicles across the state. ?The notification seeks to restrict the vehicles in the CMA only. We are not going to cancel their registration. They can ply outside the CMA,? he said.

 Ray also drew the court?s attention to the findings of a survey conducted by the state pollution control board ? 59 per cent of air pollution in the city is caused by pre-1990 commercial vehicles, most of which are not roadworthy. 

 ?The new vehicles account for only 2.5 per cent of air pollution,? he added. 

 Smart cards: The public vehicles directorate will start replacing driving licences with smart cards from January 30. Initially, the cards will be issued only to non-professional licence-holders.

 Applicants will have to submit their licences, along with an age proof and a fee of Rs 360, to get the smart cards.

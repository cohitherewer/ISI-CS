 MONOPOLY WITH A MISSION: A game of Maalamal in progress. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya

 The game Monopoly has had many avatars. But perhaps this is the first time it is being used to create awareness in children. 

 Maalamal, a board game developed by an NGO for ?non-school-going working children?, is like Monopoly in basic ways. Depending on the number on the dice, a player lands on a certain property. 

 But the properties here have guardians ? and if he also can buy or sell houses, the player has to answer questions that test his general knowledge and social awareness to make some quick, symbolic money.

 The guardians are no less than Shah Rukh Khan as a social worker, Sanjay Dutt as a doctor, or Amitabh Bachchan as a policeman, if only as illustrations. If the player has landed on SRK?s space, he can be asked what exactly is a Child Helpline ? a number that can be dialled anytime, or a new chewing gum. 

 If he has the answer right, he gets showered with notes. One of the spaces is devoted entirely to questions on AIDS. 

 Groupe Developpement, the NGO that has come up with the game, works to prevent exploitation and child abuse. The organisation, headquartered in France, developed the game as a tool as part of its south Asian project called Sanjog in India, Bangladesh and Pakistan.

 The name and the features of the game were carefully devised, says Roop Sen of Groupe Developpement. For children who are forced to work from an early age, money is important. Hence, the name Maalamal. But more important, he said, was to send the message that through skills, one can control one?s life.

 ?The boy who works in a station often blames his plight on his fate. But if he gets the answer right and gets rewarded for it, it?s not just chance that has helped him,? says Sen. ?It?s about the power of choice, something they are not aware of at all at times.?

 The NGO wants to reach the game through a network of other activist organisations. It has tested Maalamal with children, it said, and they have responded very well.

 The organisation has also made a 12-minute animation film to address a slightly older male audience. The film, Aur Ek Munnabhai, is about a group of young men going to Mumbai from Calcutta to work as waiters in restaurants ? and falling prey to the city?s glamour, including nights at dance bars. One of them is suspected to be HIV-infected, but the results prove negative. 

 The day is saved, but the message is reached.

 The tools were launched at a conference last week, attended by Anne Marchal, head of delegation (development) of the European Commission. Groupe Developpement said that the initial response from children has been very good. It is looking to market the tools from various platforms and reach the target audience through a network of NGOs.

 Taxi strike called off

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Taxi operators called off their strike after a meeting with transport minister Subhas Chakraborty on Thursday. 

 Bengal Taxi Association had called the indefinite strike demanding withdrawal of cess and reduction in sales tax on petrol and diesel. The minister said he would look into their complaints against police highhandedness, but expressed helplessness on withdrawal of cess. ?Let the Centre cut the excise and customs duty and then the state will act,? he said.

 The showdown between showers and shoppers on Dhanteras turned out to be a no-contest in the end. Blinding rain and flooded streets at high noon were swamped hours later by a sea of shoppers, in a resounding victory for festive spirit.

 The weatherman warned of more rain and thunderstorms in and around Calcutta in the next 24 hours, but on Thursday the buyer brigade couldnt care less.

 The spirit of the die-hard shopper had to be seen to be believed at the new Sovabazar showroom of Anjali Jewellers late on Thursday. The place was packed and a few hundred waited their turn, patiently.

 It would need nothing less than a deluge to dampen the spirit of Dhanteras shopping. Come rain or shine, this day and this week is for shopping, smiled Dolon Roy, a young mother waiting in queue.

 A mix of rain and shine is what the Regional Meteorological Centre in Alipore has predicted till Diwali. 

 Thursdays showers were due to an upper-air cyclonic circulation over Gangetic Bengal. This led to heavy incursion of moisture from the Bay of Bengal and formation of rain clouds, explained G.C. Debnath, director of the weather section.

 Friday should bring a partly cloudy sky with possibility of rain or thundershower in some areas. There are no chances of prolonged heavy showers, the monsoon having withdrawn on October 17, assured Debnath.

 Neither downpour nor traffic snarl could slow the Dhanteras shopper down. Its a must-shop day and we expect a heavy rush right till midnight, said Arun Noel Baptist of Pantaloons (Camac Street).

 The shopping saga waded through Camac Street (jewellry mall Fort Knox was overrun by the family crowd), Elgin Road (Forum hosted frenzied GenX footfall), Lord Sinha Road (where Landmark was invaded by close to 2,000 customers) and more.

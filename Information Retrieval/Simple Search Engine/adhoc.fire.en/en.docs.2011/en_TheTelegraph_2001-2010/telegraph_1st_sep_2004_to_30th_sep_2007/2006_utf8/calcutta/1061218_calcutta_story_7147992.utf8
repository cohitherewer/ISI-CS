 Restructured trilogy

 Bringing together the best of contemporary Indian theatre, Nandikars ongoing 23rd National Theatre Festival, offers the citys theatre lovers the rare opportunity to experience and comprehend modern trends in theatre, from concept and ideology to style and performance. Being staged this evening as part of the festival, Wada is an edited version of the famous Wada trilogy plays by Mahesh Elkunchwar. Awishkars production, instead of beginning with Wada Chirebandi, the first play of the trilogy, deals with the final scene from Yugant, the last of the trilogy. Turning a seven-odd hour play into a short, two-hour one makes the presentation more powerful. Moreover, it provides a chance to live the texts, especially Wada Chirebandi, which has come to be considered as one of the all-time classics of Marathi literature. Direction: Chetan Datar.

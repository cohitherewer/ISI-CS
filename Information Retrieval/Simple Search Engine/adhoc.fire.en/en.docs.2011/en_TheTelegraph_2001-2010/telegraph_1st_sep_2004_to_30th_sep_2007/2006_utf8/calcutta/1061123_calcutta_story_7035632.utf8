 CAT wannabes look beyond

 - Entrance 

 tests lined up for other B-schools 

 SMITA MEHTA 

 Pankaj Ranuka has been burning the midnight oil for four months, readying for a series of B-school entrance tests, which commenced last Sunday with common admission test (CAT) for the six Indian Institutes of Management and some other institutes.

 After writing the two-and-a-half-hour exam, he is gearing up for the Indian Institute of Foreign Trade entrance, scheduled this Sunday. Entrance tests for institutes like Nurseemonjee, XLRI Jamshedpur and XIM Bhubaneswar are lined up for December 3, December 10, December 17 and even the first Sunday of the New Year. 

 I know there is still a long way to go. But after slogging for CAT and XAT, the other tests have become relatively easy, says the 22-year-old, who is now focussing on clearing the group discussion and personal interview with expert help.

 Pankaj is optimistic about his CAT performance: Everyone dreams of the best campuses, but for that you need a very high score. I am praying for at least an average score so that I can apply to decent B-schools. 

 Over 190,000 students are looking for the 1,300-plus seats at the IIMs. The names of those who have made the cut in the written test will only be known in January. Aware of the difficulty in securing a berth at the premier institutes, most of the wannabe managers are implementing Plan B.

 For instance, Roneeta, who wants to be a brand manager and is awaiting a call from MICA based on her CAT score, is preparing for the Symbiosis and Nurseemonjee entrance tests. 

 The succession of tests has worn out Kanika but she has not lost focus. I will chill out for four days and then start preparations for ICFAI Business School entrance on December 17 and XLRI Jamshedpur and XIM Bhubaneshwar entrance in January, she reveals.

 There are a handful, though, who have been demoralised by their CAT performance.

 We are trying to motivate them to concentrate on other avenues and not waste time brooding, says Vidur Kapoor of Erudite, which specialises in preparing students for B-school entrances.

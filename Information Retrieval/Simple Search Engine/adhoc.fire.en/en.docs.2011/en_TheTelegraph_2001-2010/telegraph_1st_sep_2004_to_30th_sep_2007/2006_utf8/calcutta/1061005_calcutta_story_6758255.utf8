 Cell bank insurance against ailments 

 SUBHRO SAHA

 For Manpreet Kaur, this was the best insurance she could provide her twins with. To Seema Dhandhania, it was the most precious gift for her baby boy.

 Manpreet, a 29-year-old dental surgeon, and Seema, a 23-year-old homemaker both first-time mothers are among a crop of Calcutta parents opting for stem cell banking by preserving the umbilical cord blood of their newborns.

 They were among the 3,000 expectant parents who enrolled with LifeCell, Indias first private cord blood bank, in its 20 months of operation. While Calcutta accounted for about 8-10 per cent of the enrolments, the city-based Bhagirathi Neotia Woman and Child Care Centre enrolled the highest number of members by any hospital in a month.

 They were way ahead of the 100-odd hospitals we have partnership with, confirmed S. Abhaya Kumar, vice-chairman and CEO, LifeCell. The company currently has 16 marketing and collection centres in India and plans to expand to 24 cities by December this year.

 I read about stem cell banking on the Net and in a medical journal and the potential benefits are so mind-boggling, you can hardly ignore them, smiled Manpreet who is now encouraging pregnant woman to enrol for cord blood banking.

 Cord blood, usually discarded after childbirth, is a rich source of stem cells, which can be harvested and cryo-preserved to be used for treating more than 75 serious ailments including neurological disorders and cardiac conditions. Even an answer to diabetes could be on the horizon, with the possibility of creating cells that can produce insulin.

 While LifeCell operates from its nodal centre in Chennai, Singapore-based cell therapy company CyGenics Ltd has formed CordLife Sciences (India) Private Limited, a cord blood banking company, which will launch Calcuttas first cord blood banking facility early next year.

 We really dont know what the future holds for them, but this is one gift which can safeguard them against critical illnesses in future, said Seema. She came to know about stem cell banking only a couple of months before her scheduled delivery date, and even though her obstetrician wasnt aggressively advocating it, she made her decision and scrambled to tie up procedural formalities.

 Like Seemas doctor, a large section of Calcuttas medical fraternity would still adopt a wait-and-watch policy, though. Its more like an insurance really for those parents who can afford it, but there are a few grey areas, more so in India, where its still very much an emerging science and awareness is low, observed gynaecological surgeon T. Biju Singh, attached to the Neotia hospital.

 Like CordLife, LifeCell has also promised to launch an awareness drive in the city to expel doubts. We will do presentations and counselling at clinics and hospitals, take part in exhibitions, make presentations to companies and run advertising campaigns, declared Kumar.

 As the numbers grow substantially, LifeCell will also consider setting up a cord blood bank in Calcutta. The company is setting up Indias first exclusive stem cell therapy centre at Chennai for haematological and oncological ailments.

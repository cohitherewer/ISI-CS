 The annual winter carnival of ?jazz, blues and beyond? is back to warm the hearts of Calcutta?s jazz aficionados after a one-year hiatus, triggered by the tsunami.

 The Congo Square Jazzfest 2006, a two-day international festival of world music (Dalhousie Institute, January 21-22), will feature Mandu Sarara from Brazil, the Eric Lohrer Quartet from France (courtesy The French Association), Three Raags, a French-German trio, and HFT from India.

 The major attraction at this edition of the festival will be the Brazilian quintet, which plays instrumental popular music. Mandu Sarara members are Beto Sporleder (soprano, tenor, baritone saxophone and flute), Lucas Vargas (piano, Rhodes, accordion), Rui Barossi (acoustic and electric bass), Mario Gaiotto (drums and percussion) and Rodrigo Bragganca (acoustic and electric guitar and Brazilian viola).

 ?The group aims at the preservation and dissemination of Brazilian popular music of authentic cultural value,? according to Ashok Banerjee of Congo Square, the catalyst group largely responsible for the recent revival of jazz and blues music in the city. 

 Mandu Sarara, which researches regional rhythms, will present a ?unique collage? of rhythms, ranging from ?frevo?, ?baiao? and ?maracatu?, as well as ?choro?, ?samba? and ?bossa nova? at the Jazzfest. 

 Influences of iconic Brazilian musicians and composers like Antonio Carlos Jobim, Milton Nascimento, Egberto Gismonti and Hermeto Pascoal are prominent in their works.

 ?The great bet in the future of the group is on its virtuosity in mixing improvised and arranged music in a peculiar and expressive job,? Stefan Gan writes about the young group from Sao Paolo in Jazz+ magazine.

 The repertoire of the Eric Lohrer Quartet is made up of new compositions by Lohrer, as well as other members of the ensemble (Jean-Charles Richard on soprano sax, Eric Surmenian on double bass, Patrick Goraguer on drums).

 Guitarist-composer Lohrer has taken part in many jazz projects, with Jean-Michel Pilc, Eric Lelann, Andy Emler, Eric Barret, Edouard Feriet, Julien Lourau. ?He has also been involved with projects in rock, soul, world and contemporary music,? says Banerjee.

 Three Raags is a jazz trio based in Pondicherry, Auroville, merging western and Indian musical approaches through free improvisation and fusion. 

 Violinist Holger Jetter and bassist Mishko M?Ba studied western classical, in Salzburg and Toulouse, respectively, while drummer Suresh Bascara studied the tabla and Indian classical music in Calcutta with Pandit Shankar Ghosh.

 Jetter has accompanied Joan Baez, Mercedes Sosa and Konstantin Wecker, while M?Ba has played with Ray Charles, Charles Aznavour and Didier Lockwood.

 HFT, which will open the show on Saturday before Mandu Sarara takes the stage, is very much a home-grown outfit, featuring Arjun Sen on guitar, Lew Hilt on bass and Adhiraj Mustafi on drums. The three musicians converse over the course of the performance, taking the audience through ?a jazz run, a blues walk, a funk groove or an aalaap?.

 ICCR is responsible for hospitality, while the sponsors making the two-day feast of contemporary and Latin jazz on the DI lawns possible are Aeicorp, Seagrams, Minto, Selvel Vantage and VH1.

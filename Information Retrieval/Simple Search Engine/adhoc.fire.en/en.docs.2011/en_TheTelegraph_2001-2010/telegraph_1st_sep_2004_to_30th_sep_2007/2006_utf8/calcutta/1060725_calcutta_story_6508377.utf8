 Flood jinx on central Calcutta

 - Raj engineers opted for smoother water supply over sewer lines

 A day may come when waterlogging will be a woe of the past for Calcutta, except in its central pocket. And for that, blame the British engineers who made a compromise around 130 years ago.

 Faced with a choice of ensuring uninterrupted flow of either drainage water or drinking water, the engineers opted for the latter. They consigned Calcutta to suffer the fate of a few days? waterlogging in its central zone, between Rabindra Sarani and Bidhan Sarani.

 While projects are being drawn up with funds from external agencies to solve the perennial problem of waterlogging in various part of the city ? a Rs 1,800-crore project is on for South Sinthee, Cossipore, Behala, Garden Reach, Jadavpur, Kasba, Tiljala and Topsia ? there is no end in sight of the suffering of central Calcutta residents.

 Municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay has directed chief engineer (civil) Nilangshu Bose to prepare a status report on waterlogging in the Mechhua, Chittaranjan Avenue, Mahajati Sadan, Kalabagan and Muktaram Babu Street areas and suggest ways to tackle the problem.

 Deputy chief engineer (civil) P.K. Dhua said a 36-inch-diameter brick sewer, extending from west to east, was laid by the British under Madan Mohan Burman Street in 1875 to drain out run-off water from the Mechhua area.

 But the conduit hit a hurdle beneath Bidhan Sarani (Cornwallis Street), where a 30-inch-diameter water mains had already been laid in the north-south direction.

 Because of the topography of the area, it was not possible for the engineers to alter the level of the water mains. Eager not to disrupt the water supply network, they made the narrower water mains pass through the brick sewer.

 The result: the sewer diameter drastically reduces to six inches under Bidhan Sarani, severely restricting the flow of drainage water from west to east. As a spin-off effect, water on the surface cannot be drained out fast, resulting in deluge like the one last week.

 According to civic engineers, the problem can be tackled by setting up lift-pumping stations at various points or installing low-power pumps at spots like Nimtala, Colootola and Grey Street after blocking the ?summit heads? (the starting point of the brick sewers at the Hooghly end) with pen-stock gates (which will prevent the flow of river water into the sewers during high tide).

 The tentative cost of the project is Rs 5 crore-plus.

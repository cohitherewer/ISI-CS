 Delay cry in footballer treatment

 Four days after a young footballer died, allegedly due to negligence by SSKM Hospital doctors, an upcoming footballer with a broken collar bone was left unattended to for more than two hours at the hospital on Sunday. He was treated only after the intervention of the hospital superintendent.

 Chulen Sung, 21, a left back with Calcutta Football Club (CFC), sustained the injury during the club?s practice at the Mohun Bagan grounds in the morning. Sung had represented Nagaland in the Santosh Trophy in 2005. He moved to Calcutta in May this year to play for CFC.

 Sung was taken to SSKM from the ground by his teammates around 11 am. ?They carried out an X-ray but then left me on the table. I was in severe pain but nobody gave me any medicine,? he alleged.

 Those who had accompanied Sung to the hospital demanded that a doctor attend to him. They were told the resident medical officer (RMO) could not be traced. ?When we asked the authorities to call the doctor, they said nothing could be done and we have to wait,? stated CFC coach Subrata Bhattacharya. 

 After more than an hour, a junior doctor visited the footballer but allegedly refused to treat him. ?He said he would not take the risk of treating a footballer,? alleged Satyanarayan Bhowmick, a CFC player who was with Sung.

 An RMO ultimately attended to the player around 1.30 pm. He was administered a painkiller and discharged after treatment at 2.30 pm.

 Hospital superintendent Ashok Ghosh admitted the player should have been attended to earlier. ?The RMO had gone to another ward and could not be contacted,? he offered. 

 Ghosh called another RMO at his quarters and requested him to attend to Sung. ?He rushed to the hospital and treated the patient. The on-duty doctor came later,? he added.

 The superintendent said an inquiry would be conducted into the incident on Monday.

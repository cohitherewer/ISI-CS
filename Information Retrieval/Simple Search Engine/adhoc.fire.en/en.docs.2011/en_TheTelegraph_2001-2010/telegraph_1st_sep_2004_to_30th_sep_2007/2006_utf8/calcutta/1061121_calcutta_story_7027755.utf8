The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Rajasthan reaches out

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 The historic Hawa Mahal has always drawn tourists from Bengal. Now, Rajasthan is scouting for investments from the state. A high-level delegation from the land of the desert is now camping in Calcutta to meet the objective. 

 Rajasthan can offer a lot to investors from this part of the region. We are here to touch base with industrialists and showcase the strengths of our state, said Purushotaam Agarwal, secretary in the Rajasthan governments industries department. 

 As part of the exercise, industries minister Narpat Singh Rajvi will host an open session with city businessmen on Wednesday. Representatives from all the nodal agencies Bureau of Investment Promotion, Rajasthan State Industrial Development amp; Investment Corporation, Commissioner of Industries and Rajasthan Financial Corporation will be present at the meet. 

 Things are changing for the better in Rajasthan at a very fast pace and we want to highlight that, said Agarwal. 

 So, the state government officials are criss-crossing the country to lure investments in tourism, infrastructure development and a host of other areas. The officials will move to the Northeast after the business meet in Calcutta. 

 Over 100 businessmen are invited to attend the Wednesday session, to be chaired by the industries minister, to be followed by specific one-to-one meetings. All the slots are booked and we are happy with the response, said Agarwal. 

 But the clarion call to pump in money and be a part of Rajasthans development is not limited to the sons-of-the-soil Marwari community, leading business and industry in the east and Northeast. 

 We believe that investment decisions are based on a number of factors, like stable political environment, state of infrastructure, size of market and, above all, profitability. And we are telling people to put in their money by considering all this and everyone is welcome, said the government official. 

 Besides making a pitch for investments, the Rajasthan delegation is also focusing on a cultural exchange with Bengal. A five-day fair at Swabhumi, with artefacts from Rajasthan, has also been planned. 

 We will also exchange notes with representatives of the Bengal government on how to further ties between the two states, signed off Agarwal.

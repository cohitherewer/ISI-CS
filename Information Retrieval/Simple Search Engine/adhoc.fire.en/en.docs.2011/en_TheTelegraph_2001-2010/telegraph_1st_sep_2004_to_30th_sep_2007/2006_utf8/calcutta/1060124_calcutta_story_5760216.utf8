The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You share your birthday with...

 Riya Sen 

You are charming and impressive. You have a balanced personality ? idealistic but practical, romantic yet sincere, attractive but loyal. You should try to be more social and friendly. You are very much in touch with your inner self. Sports and animals are your weaknesses. Steer clear of gambling. ? Kusum Bhandari

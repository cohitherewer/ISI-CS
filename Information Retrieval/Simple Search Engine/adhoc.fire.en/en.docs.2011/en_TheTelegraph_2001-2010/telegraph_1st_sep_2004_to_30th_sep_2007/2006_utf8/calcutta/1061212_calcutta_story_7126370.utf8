 Father Gerard Beckers died on December 9 at 6.30 pm. He was 82 and had been suffering from Parkinsons disease.

 Father Beckers joined the chemistry department of St Xaviers College in 1961 and served as head of department for over a decade.

 Since retiring from service in 1984, he had been working for the marginalised, especially the Santhals of Bengal.

 Father Beckers was laid to rest on Monday.

 Father P.C. Matthew, principal, St Xaviers College, pays tribute:

 Babu, as he was affectionately called, in his 23 years of service, had transformed the face of this college by adding very emphatically the social dimension of helping the poor and removal of all sorts of injustice.

 A doctor in biochemistry, his interest went far beyond the limits of teaching. Through the All India Catholic University Federation (AICUF) and the just-begun National Social Service (NSS), Babu tried to infuse leadership and the value of studying for the poor among young students who were attracted by his magnetic personality and commitment to help the marginalised.

 In the passing away of Babu, the college has lost a great human being who, through his being utterly human, made the reality of God closer to people. Babu has left a proud legacy for the college to carry forward, the education of young men and women, and to make the poor and the oppressed the centre of the educational formation.

 Father Beckers has left a legacy that needs to be carried forward and strengthened. This is the best tribute the college can give to this humble Jesuit.

 Father Felix Raj, vice-principal, St Xaviers College, pays tribute:

 Father Beckers was the one who brought about a social change in the college. He initiated the AICUF and NSS in the college and in Bengal, along with eye donation and body donation... He was a great inspiration for students, especially tribal students for whom he started a hostel in 1974. He was also involved in a students project in Murshidabad where they built a school and a market of commerce.

 A dynamic personality, he combined both academic and social dimension of life.

 It is a great loss in terms of a man who gave a vision to the college. But his spirit will live on through his endeavours which still continue.

 As a tribute, the B.Com students of St Xaviers will dedicate their first annual magazine called You Think, to be released on December 15, to Father Beckers.

 A mix and match of Japanese florals, Moroccan floor tiles, Rajasthani Sanganeri prints, African tribal motifs, polkas of the Seventies, florals of the Sixties, masculine stripes, old roses and more. A unique fusion that defines designer Sabyasachi Mukherjees latest creative offering.

 But theres a twist to this avant garde line from the Sabyasachi label. Instead of the ramp at a coming fashion week, this unique line will find place in your bedroom and bath zone. For, its a signature line of bed and bath linen that the designer has launched in association with furnishing major Bombay Dyeing.

 Called the Bombay Dyeing Sabyasachi Signature Line, the collection comprises double and single bedsheets with co-ordinated pillowcases, cushion covers and towels. The designs draw from The Snail, Sabyasachis much-acclaimed fall-winter 2006-07 line, his spring-summer 2007 collection to be unveiled at the New York Fashion Week next month and various other ethnic influences.

 Its a cross-cultural collection that draws inspiration from regions all over the world. In keeping with the theme motif of my New York Fashion Week line, theres a lot of Japanese florals as well, explained Sabyasachi, about his Puja offering to Calcutta.

 A set comprises one bedsheet, which doubles as a bedcover, with four pillowcases, each of a different print. The colour story is kept the same to maintain harmony. For instance, an indigo denim-look bedspread comes with four pillowcases one polka dot, one striped, one with Moroccan floor tile prints and one solid all with the indigo-and-white colour code.

 Mix and match is the key to the entire line.

 Earthy orange, indigo, browns, yellows, lime green, purple and beige make up the colour palette.

 This is a first-of-its-kind venture in the country where a designer has lent his creativity to the home furnishing category, said R.V. Sinha, general manager of Bombay Dyeing amp; Manufacturing Co. Ltd.

 Ours is a traditional and trusted brand that is venturing into the contemporary home space. Sabyasachis image as a designer suits us fine since he represents a fusion between tradition and contemporary. So we approached him to do this collection, Sinha explained.

 But we gave Sabyasachi full creative independence everything from the designs to the colour story was decided by him, added Sinha.

 The designer seemed happy enough with this signature line to observe with a smile: The best thing about the collection is the pricing; now anyone can afford a Sabyasachi creation!

 The range starts from Rs 180 and goes up to Rs 2,400. It will be available at 450 exclusive Bombay Dyeing stores across the country, multi-label furnishing stores and large-format stores.

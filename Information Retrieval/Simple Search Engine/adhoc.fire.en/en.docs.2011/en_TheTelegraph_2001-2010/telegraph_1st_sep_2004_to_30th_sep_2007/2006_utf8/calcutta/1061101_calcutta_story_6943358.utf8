Screen On amp; Off

 Garfield and his lookalike Prince, a royal feline whos inherited a castle

 The worlds favourite cat is back in Garfield 2. He has begun his very own British invasion, wreaking havoc on the entire United Kingdom. Heres a Q amp;A with Garfield (as channelled through Garfield 2 co-screenwriter Alec Sokolow).

 Describe yourself in three words...

 Surrounded by idiots.

 What do you like most about being a cat?

 I have just woken up from my first nap of the day. Jon is just finishing my brunch requirements and the TVs fired up... What was the question again?

 What kind of cat are you (race)?

 I am an Orange-American.

 You are mainly known as a cartoon cat. What is best about 

 starring in a movie?

 The food at craft services, which Ive renamed cat services. In Hollywood, I am a triple threat. I can sing, dance and eat. Oh, by the way, I do all my own stunts.

 Where do you think you look best in cartoons or in movies?

 I look best wherever I can see myself. Movies, TV, comics, billboards, mirrors, stainless steel, sunglasses, chrome bumpers, puddles, photos... Did I mention mirrors?

 You go to England in the new movie. Why?

 or the weather.

 What is the meanest thing you have ever done to Jon?

 I am not repeat, not mean to Jon. Its tough love. Somebodys got to be there to remind him hes a hopeless loser, or he might over-reach... However, I do like putting his jockey shorts in the microwave.

 What is the most annoying thing about Odie?

 His very presence in my otherwise perfect cat universe.

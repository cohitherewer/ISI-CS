The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Attention to artery

 - 70 CRORES TO WIDEN BYPASS

 A STAFF REPORTER 

The Assembly elections over, the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) has started work on projects worth Rs 70 crore to widen the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass, lay roads that will merge with it and extend the artery by 12 km to the south.

 ?We hope to start work in the first week of June,? said Debdas Bhattacharya, CMDA chief engineer (traffic and transportation). 

 While the widening will be wrapped up in six months, the extension of the Bypass from Garia to Sonarpur will take a year and a half.

 The widening of the Bypass will be executed in three phases. The stretch between Ultadanga and Park Circus will be the first phase. 

 The subsequent phases will cover the stretch between Park Circus and Ballygunge and the one between Ballygunge and Garia. The 3.5-km stretch that connects Raja SC Mullick Road with the Bypass will also be widened. 

 An investment of Rs 10 crore will be required for all the widening work.

 Another Rs 18 crore will be invested to lay five roads that will lead to the Bypass. Two of them will meet the artery near Ultadanga, two on the Park Circus-Ballygunge stretch and one between Ballygunge and Garia.

 Work on the Bypass started in 1974 under the Calcutta Urban Development Project (I amp;II) and the progress depended on the availability of funds.

 As for the proposed extension of the Bypass, the CMDA had felt the need for extending the road by 12 km following the commissioning of the Sonarpur flyover. 

 The extension has become all the more necessary, as the government has decided to shift the district headquarters of South 24-Parganas from Alipore to Baruipur. 

 Around Rs 42 crore will be required for the southward extension of the Bypass, which will be 54 ft wide.

 All the projects will be executed under the public-private partnership scheme.

 Mistake rerun in HS paper

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Barely 48 hours after a physics answer script of a Higher Secondary (HS) examinee went missing from Hare School, an error in the business economics question paper left hundreds of students perplexed on Friday.

 The confusion arose after the examinees found that a question in the Bengali version was different from its English version in the second business economics paper. 

 The Bengali version?s question number 10(b), based on the GP series said: ?If the first term is 9/2 and the fifth term is 8/2 find the tenth term?. 

 The figures and numerals in the English version were different. Both questions carried eight marks.

 ?We were confused because the entire question paper is the same for both versions,? said Anirban Dutta, an examinee who wrote the tests in Bengali at a College Street centre.

 Debashis Sarkar, secretary, West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education, admitted the ?mistake?.

 ?It?s a mistake and should not have been there in the question paper. But both the questions are solvable, so where is the problem?? he said. 

 This is the third time that an error in the ongoing HS examinations has led to confusion among examinees. Earlier, the mathematics and accountancy question papers had similar printing errors.

 Of Wednesday?s missing paper drama, officials said the answer script had not been traced in Hare School. ?We are still hunting for the script. A complaint has been lodged with the police and we hope to find a solution before the results are declared in June.?

 What: 

 May Queen Contest. 

 Where: Ordnance Club.

 When: May 27.

 Take a look: A crowd of 500-plus came to gape at 17 aspiring beauty queens, all aged between 16 and 19. They were not disappointed, if their cheers were any indication. 

 The 10-day grooming by Jyoti Luthra paid off as the contestants, if lacking the height of supermodels, made up with their graceful gait, straight-from-the-heart answers and easy confidence. 

 Jyoti, also the emcee, made sure there was not a moment of boredom. The chief guest was Lt General T.A. DCunha, chief of the army, Ordnance Corps. 

 The judges were former cricketer-turned-commentator Arun Lal, chess player Dibyendu Baruah, designer Abhishek Dutta, model Sheena Chauhan, Heena Gorsia, fashion designer-cum-cultural head of the Bhawanipur group of colleges and Raj Kiran Das, head of the department of fashion designing at Bhawanipur Gujarati Education Society.

 The first round had the contestants in colourful drapes from Rupahali Sarees. Next was the informal chill-out round, when the contestants matched steps to the hip hop music. 

 Then the judges chose the eight semi-finalists. One question, What do you prefer, cricket or chess, and why? drew out an honest reply. I prefer cricket as I can bat well. Chess is not my cup of tea, I hardly win. 

 Next all the girls walked the ramp in ensembles by designer Jaya Mishra. 

 The five finalists stayed back on stage for the one common question: What do you consider more important, to mean the world to someone or to be someone in this world? For the majority it was to be someone. 

 After what seemed to be a harrowing task, judges selected the winners. Miss Beautiful Skin Geetanjali Thapa was crowned the Ordnance Club May Queen 2006. 

 Tanya Misra was the first runner-up. Miss Perfect 10 Priyanka Poddar walked away as the second runner-up. 

 The Miss Beautiful Hair title went to Geetanjali Banik and the Miss Beautiful Smile to Lata Singh. 

 The evening also saw Priya and her dance troupe and their jhatkas and matkas and a fashion show by club members. Later in the evening singer Mou Mukherjee kept the party on in full swing.

 Voiceover: This is a platform where opportunities are provided to budding talent. The contest was open to non-members also to ensure that we can bring in talent from all parts of the city, smiled club member Ashit Luthra.

 New brew 

 What: Launch of Haywards Black, Indias first stout beer from brewing major SABMiller India.

 Where: Incognito, Taj Bengal.

 When: May 28.

 Take a look: With the scorching summer pushing the Celsius to the 40-plus mark, what better news than the launch of a beer.

 After the debut launch in Noida a couple of days ago, Calcutta is the second place where Haywards Black stout beer was launched. Stout beer is a dark beer. Haywards Black is a blend of Caledon Valley roasted barley malt, pale malt and Alpha hops from New Zealand. 

 The beer, being brewed at Rochees Breweries Limited in Rajasthan, ensures that a slow brewing process with special yeast creates a creamy head and a rich, smooth taste.

 At the launch on Friday, T.J. Venkateshwaran, operation director (central), SABMiller India spoke about the findings of a research conducted on consumers above 23 in Calcutta, Andhra Pradesh and Delhi for insight into how the Indian consumer would react to stout beer. 

 Venkateshwaran said that in keeping with the Indian palate, Haywards Black is less bitter and more smooth than regular stout beer. 

 The use of dark roasted malt renders the dark colouring along with a smoky taste.

 Currently the beer is available at Taj Bengal, The Park, Hyatt Regency Calcutta, ITC Sonar Bangla Sheraton amp; Towers and select liquor shops in the city. 

 Pocket pinch: Haywards Black is available in 330 ml bottles and is priced at Rs 32. 

 Voiceover: The consumer today wants variety in all categories and the beer market has few choices. The idea is to cater to this changing need and provide an international quality stout beer, smiled Venkateshwaran. 

 Dance do

 What: Salsa sessions for Wednesday Ladies Night.

 Where: Venom, the nightclub at Fort Knox on Camac Street. 

 When: Till May 31. 

 Take a look: The session kickstarts with a performance by salsa expert Aditya Upadhya with partner Shaneel Mukerji, followed by a half-hour workshop. Founder of the school Vive La Salsa, Aditya then goes through the basic footwork and turns. 

 The ladies are also treated to Merengue and Bachata, hot new dances from Dominican Republic. 

 Voiceover: We wanted to do something special for the Ladies Night. Salsa is hot right now and we provided a perfect ambience for them to pick up a step or two. Top it off with bites and drinks on the house and the concoction is just perfect for a rocking night, smiled Bunty Sethi, proprietor of Venom.

 Femme force

 What: Night de Damas.

 Where: Big Ben at The Kenilworth.

 When: Wednesday night. 

 Take a look: A fashion show featuring five city models in long Spanish skirts and short tops was the main attraction of the night, set against a Spanish theme. 

 Free wine for the girls who dropped in to party was another puller. 

 Voiceover: We want 

 to encourage the trend of girls going out and letting down 

 their hair without having to depend on their boyfriends, 

 said a spokesperson for the hotel.

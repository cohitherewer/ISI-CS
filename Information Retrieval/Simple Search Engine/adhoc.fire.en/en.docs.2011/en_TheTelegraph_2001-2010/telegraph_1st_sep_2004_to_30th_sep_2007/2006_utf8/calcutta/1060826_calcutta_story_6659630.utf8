The three-day programme to mark the 13th death anniversary 

of Utpal Dutt was an eye-opener of sorts, in the number and the nature of the 

turnout, and more.

For one, it was the fact that so few people turned 

up for this show organised by the Utpal Dutt Foundation, Peoples Little Theatre, 

government of West Bengal and Airtel. Then, it was the kind of people who turned 

up, who cheered and clapped every time there was a mention of class struggle, 

of Lenin or Marx.

This was Utpal Dutt labelled and packaged. As one 

of the organisers pointed out, Dutt himself had once said that his first identity 

was that of a propagandist. Of all his plays, the festival chose Manusher Adhikare 

and Louha Manab.

Held at Rabindra Sadan, the festival was also marked 

by two firsts. The release of Macbeth, translated by Utpal Dutt, and the 

first public screening of an audio-visual on the works of Tapas Sen. Macbeth, 

published for the first time by Thema and edited by Samik Bandopadhyay, includes 

Sandeho, an unpublished poem by Dutt retrieved from the Macbeth 

script.

Tapas Sens CD presentation Exposition for 

submission to the International Colloquium proved an apt conclusion to a moving 

tribute by Tapas Sens son Joy and Samik Bandopadhyay on Day Three. Joy Sens 

lighting was certainly notable both in Nati and Manusher Adhikare.

Considered a classic, Manusher Adhikare was 

presented quite well by Behrampore Repertory Theatre, directed by Asit Basu. Written 

in 1967 and representative of Dutts dramatic genius, Manusher Adhikare 

protests the racial discrimination and injustice of the Scottsborough trial of 

1931. If the trial of an innocent had been a catalyst in the Black Movement in 

America, it carried new meaning when it debuted at the Minerva in 1968.

Louha Manab, written by Dutt in 1964 while 

in jail, is based on a real trial against a pro-Stalin, ex-Politburo member by 

Kruschevites in Moscow of 1963. First staged at Alipore Jail in 1965, it was presented 

here by Peoples Little Theatre.

The event also paid tribute to the memory of Bangladeshi 

poet Shamsur Rahman. Members of various Bangladeshi theatre groups were present, 

recalling chance meetings with Dutt and how they had seen and performed his plays.

Highlighting the Peoples Little Theatres efforts 

to carry on the stage struggle beyond Dutt, Nati was a play written and 

presented by female members of the group, Sova Sen (Utpal Dutts wife), Bishnupriya 

Dutt (Utpal Dutts daughter), Averi Chaubey and others.

It had been billed as a tribute to all actresses of 

the Bengali stage from the 19th to the 21st century and a showcase of their contributions, 

trials and tribulations. It involved a lot of research, but what we had in the 

end was less play and more collective ramblings by actresses of various ages and 

backgrounds. The writers of Nati, however, believe this marks a new beginning. 

The learnt lines have exhausted themselves and with it our complacent postures, 

our self engrossment the true actresss story cannot have a grand narrative or 

even a predictable story, they claimed.

The condition of actresses working in our group and 

elsewhere has certainly improved; they no longer accept their directors as their 

gurus, they speak out, concluded Sova Sen.

Our girl, there

When the drama classes start at The Juilliard School 

in New York this month-end, there will be a Calcutta girl in the crowd of students. 

Nilanjana Bose (picture below) is the second Indian, after Jadavpur University 

graduate Mahira Kakkar, to have got through the rigorous admission process at 

this prestigious music-dance-drama school.

I had to go through five rounds of auditions in New 

York. We were divided into groups and given a number of things to do. Acting, 

monologue pieces, dance movements, voice modulation, speech, reading, improvisations 

and group work. Each round was a process of elimination, says Nilanjana, who 

studied in La Martiniere for Girls before shifting to Delhi to pursue a BA in 

history from St Stephens College.

One of the reasons for going to St Stephens was 

to do theatre, says she, having acted in a string of productions from Shakespeare 

to Oscar Wilde, Arthur Miller to Tom Stoppard. While in college, Nilanjana acted 

for Shakespeare Society, the St Stephens drama club. Later, she teamed up with 

some theatre actors a few of them from her college to form Wide Aisle Productions. 

The troupe had put up Ariel Dorfmans The Reader at Gyan Manch last year.

Last summer, she did Terry Pratchetts The Wyrd 

Sisters with Theatrecian on the Calcutta stage. The four-year course at Juilliard 

will be focussing on classes and continual performances, says the trained Manipuri 

dancer who also had a brush with the big screen when she played Sumana, a small 

role, in Bappaditya Bandopadhyays Devaki, starring Suman Ranganathan 

and Perizaad Zorabian.

A writers tale

With a bouquet of street plays, proscenium theatre 

and seminar, a three-day festival on Manik Bandopadhyay, organised by Pratikriti, 

gets underway on September 1. 

The highlight of Manik Bandopadhyay, Padma Nadir 

Majhi O Bangla Theatre would be the stage adaptation of the writers seminal 

work Padma Nadir Majhi, to be put up by Pratikriti.

The festival will be unveiled on the evening of September 

1 with a seminar on the festivals theme at Bangla Akademi. The speakers are author 

Sunil Gangopadhyay, and theatre veterans Manoj Mitra, Ashok Mukhopadhyay, Arun 

Mukhopadhyay and Chandan Sen. Sukanta, Manik Bandopadhyays son, will steer the 

discussion.

We are holding this festival to kick-off the birth 

centenary of Manik Bandopadhyay which falls in May 1908. The stage productions 

at the festival are based on his novels, short stories and poems. We will dwell 

on the marginalised people that Bandopadhyay wrote about in his masterpieces, 

said Pratikriti director Aloke Deb.

Two street plays are scheduled for Day II Haraner 

Natjamai by Atmajog Behala and Dibaratrir Godyo by Ashokenagar Natyamukh. 

An adaptation of the eponymous short story, Haraner Natjamai will be directed 

by Satyapriya Sarkar. The second play is composed of pieces from Bandopadhyays 

poetry collection Kayekti Shironamheen Kabita. With six characters, director 

Avi Chakraborty has woven a 40-minute tale of a youth losing his livelihood and 

his love. The double bill will be held in the Nandan complex.

The curtains come down on September 3 at Academy of 

Fine Arts at 6.30 pm, where Pratikriti will stage Padma Nadir Majhi, the 

novel where Bandopadhyay recreated the lives of fishermen on the Padma. This 

is a big challenge for us. No theatre troupe has ever attempted this play, says 

Deb, who has adapted and directed the production. The light effects have been 

done by Joy Sen, son of Tapas Sen.

 Lifestyle India Fashion Week on Thursday;

 Calcutta was the flavour of the afternoon on Day II of the Wills Lifestyle India Fashion Week (WLIFW) in Delhi.

 On Thursday afternoon, designer duo Swapan and Seema Suhasaria, who operate out of their Sarat Bose Road studio Vachhi, unveiled a diffusion and pret line titled Mosaic Dreams on the ramp at The Grand in New Delhi. The palette was based on beige, cream and brown, with touches of red, blue and rust.

 The diffusion line drew inspiration from rich Indian traditions and the pret series had flowing skirts, teamed effectively with sheer tops, glam belts and structured jackets.

 The collection is all about a collage of textures, embellishments and designs that results in a mosaic of colour, style and treatment, said the duo.

 Lots of delicate lace embroidery, crystals and glass beads play with different textures and applique to lend a dreamy mood and feel to the line.

 This was followed by designer Sucheta Merhs dazzling debut on the Fashion Week ramp. The designer who retails from her studio Earthy Myths on Loudon Street, launched Tree of Hope, a line inspired by the famous painting of the same name by Frida Kahlo.

 There is a strong sense of duality in the collection, with a hint of romance and joy, smiled Sucheta.

 Airy chiffons and georgettes go hand in hand with heavy crepes, linens and velvets. Greys, browns, forest greens and dull blues are lifted with brighter hues like maroons, blood reds and oranges.

 Drawing inspiration from the painting, I have tried to strike a balance between perfection and imperfection. The idea is that you dont have to look perfect to look good. In fact, sometimes imperfection is sexier. We have tried to put accents on these imperfections, explained the designer.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Sit-up slap for cop

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Those out on a leisurely afternoon stroll by the Lakes were arrested by a curious sight on Sunday ? a constable doing sit-ups, hands to his ears, while a crowd kept count. The man in uniform was being taken to task for thrashing a deranged man who had hurled a stone at his senior.

 Around 1.30 pm, the constable from the Special Branch and an assistant sub-inspector (ASI) from Calcutta Armed Police were patrolling Rabindra Sarobar on foot. Spying Tutun Das, a mentally-deranged man from the locality wandering aimlessly, the ASI shooed him off. When Das paid scant attention, the policemen collared him and drove him out. In retaliation, he picked up a stone and hurled it at the ASI. The stone grazed the ASI?s temple.

 The constable then pounced on Das and started beating him up. ?One man tried to stop the constable and within minutes, a group of 30 assembled there. They held the constable guilty and decided he must be punished,? said an officer of Lake police station.

 A brief brainstorm later, the verdict was passed: the constable must do sit-ups in front of the ?victim?. The mob threatened to thrash him if he didn?t follow orders. ?The constable had to do 10 sit-ups, holding his ears,? the officer added.

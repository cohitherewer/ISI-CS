 In a fix: Sienna Miller

 On the last lap of the shoot, the star cast of Anuranon got together for a party scene at Virgose, the restobar at HHI, on Wednesday afternoon. Rajat Kapoor, Raima Sen, Rahul Bose and Rituparna Sengupta joined the Taaltantra team of Tanmoy Bose and Ratul (son of Mamata Shankar) in a music session. 

 Tanmoy has also composed the soundtrack for the film on two married couples, which would mark the debut of ad film-maker Aniruddha Roy Chowdhury in feature-length work.

 The cast featuring Rajat, Rahul and Rituparna will fly to London for the last round of shooting.

 Behind the camera is Sunil Patel, who had canned the shots for Salaam Namaste, while acting coach Sohag Sen is helping out actors with the right expressions. The costumes and sets are designed by Bibi Ray. 

 Sienna Miller is arriving on the big screen this Friday as the leading lady of Casanova, also starring Heath Ledger and Jeremy Irons. Life has not been hunky dory for Sienna ever since boyfriend Jude Law cheated on her with his kids? nanny Daisy Wright. 

 In fact, the actress is so upset with the gruelling paparazzi attention in England that she is contemplating quitting the country.

 Even her diet plan?s gone for a toss. The Alfie beauty, who wanted to look anorexic for her portrayal of Andy Warhol?s muse Edie Sedgwick in the upcoming Factory Girl, gave in to her love for fast food and couldn?t lose the requisite amount of weight. Sienna has also committed to a road film opposite Harvey Keitel titled Camille about a twisted honeymoon adventure of a young couple.

 Madur (The Mat), directed by Jayasree Bhattacharya, has won the best film in the women?s category at the Dhaka International Film Festival held in January. The 75-minute short film has been shot in the Santhal-dominated Hanripota village on the city?s outskirts.

 ?The film is based on a real story and I have set it on the craft of mat-weaving on which I had done some research in college,? says Jayasree, who makes telefilms for Bengali private channels and is now drawing up plans for a feature film.

 Madur centres around a poor craftsman whose personal life is threatened when a trader from the city tries to lure his wife with the promise of material comforts. The film features Bangladeshi actor Raisul Islam Asad, theatre director Bibhas Chakraborty and Pijush Ganguly, among others. 

 Other films competing in this category comprised entries from south India, Iran, Australia and China.

 After movies, it?s time for TV serials to be promoted by music videos. The popular STAR Plus afternoon serial Bhabhi will be boosted by a special song, Rang miley, set to tune by Anand Sharma and sang by Shreya Ghoshal.

 The song will not only promote an upcoming track in the serial but also introduce a new character in Bhabhi. While the song promos will go on air from Saturday evening on STAR Plus, the full song will be seen on Channel [V] from March 1.

 What: Cupids Day 

 Out. 

 Where: Royal Calcutta Golf 

 Club (RCGC).

 Love blast: A combination of red and white heart-shaped balloons welcomed lovebirds at the entrance.

 Once you stepped into the open-air venue, there were more balloons thrown around for effect. With DJ Akash, DJ Vicky and DJ Ravi churning out popular Bollywood chartbusters like Ishq to, Deedar de, Aisa jadoo dala re, Salaam namaste, the crowd was on its feet throughout the musical evening.

 The stage was livened up by the dance troupe Jigs and Nigs from Mumbai.

 The colour code for the evening 

 was the predictable pink and red, with a dash of white, 

 as most in the crowd were seen sporting skirts, trousers, 

 kurtis and shirts in blends of these three colours.

 Love was very much in the air 

 under the open February sky. Youngsters were seen thronging 

 counters like Nail Art, where one could get little hearts 

 painted on the nails, and Hot Shot, which was offering couples 

 instant photographs. There was a gift counter as well, for 

 those last-minute shoppers.

 Sip n bite: 

 The food spread was extensive with a Tandoori counter, Fish 

 Fingers, Chicken Gold Coins, Chicken Drumsticks, Vegetable 

 Sandwiches and French Fries, all of which were washed down 

 with drinks being served at the busy bar counter.

 Voiceover: Its 

 a mixed crowd with youngsters forming the majority. With 

 three DJs playing foot-tapping numbers, the evening is peppered 

 with fun and masti, said a spokesperson for 

 the event. 

 What: Valentines Day Celebrations.

 Where: Shisha on Camac Street.

 Love blast: Till late evening, the crowd chose to laze around on the couches, nursing their drinks and feasting on chocolate-coated strawberries and strawberry hookahs.

 Soft melodies played by DJ Girish created the mood for romance, with some couples matching steps with the slow tracks. With red candles dotting every table and red hearts adorning the walls, the ambience was just right for couples to cosy up.

 Later at night, it was hip- hop numbers that kept the mood swinging. 

 There was an open-air dinner spread on the terrace garden, accompanied by live musical performances.

 Sip n bite: The 

 bar counter served everything from wine to whisky with kebabs, 

 popcorns and peanuts. Dil Ki Laddoo, Pyari Dal, Angels 

 Hair, Dildariya Chawal? the buffet spread on the terrace 

 offered delicacies named in sync with V-Day.

 Voiceover: We are 

 all geared up for the evening with good food, great music 

 and the perfect romantic atmosphere. The footfall should 

 be around 200-250, said Sovan Mukherjee, senior manager 

 of Shisha. 

 What: Valentine Fever.

 Where: Tantra, The Park. 

 Love blast: The V-Day fever at Tantra ran high from late afternoon, the star attraction being the king of remixes, DJ Aqeel. 

 He belted out one hit number after another, keeping the crowd on its toes.

 From yesterdays hits like Keh doon tumhein, Tamma tamma loge, Saat samundar paar to latest Bollywood hits like Ada, Dus bahane and Right here right now, the crowd grooved to them all.

 Here too, red was the colour of the decor ? from heart-shaped cutouts to heart-shaped balloons. 

 Sip n bite: Love 

 shots at the bar counter found maximum takers, apart from 

 the regular vodkas, beers and Breezers.

 Voiceover: The couples 

 are in the best of spirits. The city surely knows how to 

 celebrate special days, smiled DJ Aqeel.

 What: Valentines Day bash.

 Where: B.E.D. on Ballygunge Circular Road.

 Love blast: DJ Kiran of Veer Zaara fame was the guest DJ, along with resident DJ Lloyd. The place was done up with pink balloons and couples were treated to a glass of complementary wine.

 DJ Kiran started the evening with some old melodious tracks like Yeh zameen ga rahee hai, Saat samundar paar and Keh doon tumhein. As the evening progressed he switched over to current tracks like Say na say na, Right here right now, Aadat and the latest blockbuster Rang de basanti. 

 Voiceover: We started 

 the party as early as 4.30 pm and we had a very big crowd 

 of youngsters. After some hardcore partying they shifted 

 to the dhabas to grab a bite, said a spokesperson 

 for the nightclub.

 What: Valentines Day Party.

 Where: Underground at Hotel Hindusthan International. 

 Love blast: The party at Underground started at 4 in the afternoon and the resident DJ did not take much time to create the mushy mood.

 While in the earlier part of the evening the couples decided to lounge around, they hit the dance floor as soon as tracks like Nach baliye, Dus bahane, Masti ki pathshaala and Rang de basanti were played. 

 Voiceover: The drinks on the house and freebies that couples were pampered with added to the fun at Underground, said event architect Amit Hathiramani.

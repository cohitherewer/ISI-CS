The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Floating pool on Hooghly cleared

 SHALMOLI KUNDU

 After waiting for years, Calcutta Port Trust (CPT) has finally cleared construction of the floating swimming pool on the Hooghly at Ahiritola, in north Calcutta.

 The Rs 1-crore project, considered to be the first of its kind in the country, is being undertaken by the Ahiritola Youth Swimming Club in association with the Sports Council of India.

 In 1990, members of the swimming club had approached CPM parliamentarian Sudhangsu Sil to construct an international-standard pool for budding swimmers. Thereafter, a floating swimming pool was planned.

 ?Club members wanted to construct a 14-km, long-distance swimming pool of international standards where they would train swimmers and also hold swimming competitions. That?s when we took the initiative to construct a floating swimming pool,? Sil told Metro on Sunday.

 However, the project was deadlocked when the CPT blocked the project. For more than 10 years, the project remained dormant.

 ?The CPT had initially asked for a rent of Rs 15,000 per month. It was not possible for the club to pay such a hefty amount every month. As a result, there was no progress in work,? explained Sil.

 Recently, the CPT cleared the project conditionally. In return for the land it will provide for the construction of the swimming pool, the CPT has sought land at Taratala from the Calcutta Municipal Corporation for a road-widening project.

 ?We have placed our proposal of a land exchange offer. If everything works out, a one-rupee lease agreement will be drawn up, whereby both sides will exchange land,? said A.K. Chanda, chairman of CPT.

 According to Sil, the civic body has already chalked out construction plans, about three-fourth of which is ready. The authorities will consult technical experts from abroad for suggestions.

 The government of India will partially fund the project. Sports minister Subhas Chakraborty and MLA Parimal Mishra have donated Rs 5 lakh each to the project. Construction work is expected to begin soon after the state Assembly elections are over.

 The pool will be divided into two parts. Near the river bank will be a novice corner for budding swimmers. 

 The second part will have a floating swimming pool on the Hooghly. It will have eight lanes, besides two additional lanes.

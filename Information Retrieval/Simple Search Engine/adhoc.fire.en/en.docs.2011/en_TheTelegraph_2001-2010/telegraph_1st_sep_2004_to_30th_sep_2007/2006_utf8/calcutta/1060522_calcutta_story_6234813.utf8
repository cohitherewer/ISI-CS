The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Dead fish float in dirty lake

 - Fall in oxygen count blamed

 WATER WOES: A view of Subhas Sarobar. A Telegraph picture

 Subhas Sarobar, the largest waterbody in the city barring Rabindra Sarobar, is turning into a bog due to deposition of soap and detergents and lack of maintenance by the Calcutta Improvement Trust (CIT). 

 The waterbody, owned by the CIT, is looked after by the West Bengal Anglers? Association (WBAA), though its lease expired four years ago.

 During a recent survey, the water resources engineering department of Jadavpur University found dead fish floating in Subhas Sarobar. The abnormally low percentage of oxygen in the water is believed to be the cause of the deaths. The researchers blamed the detergents and soapsuds for the fall in oxygen.

 According to the director of the water resources engineering wing, Asis Majumdar, at a depth of three metres, the dissolved oxygen in the water was 10 per cent less than the minimum requirement for the survival of fish. They cannot survive if the oxygen content is below three mg per litre, he added. 

 ?Steps should be taken immediately for conservation of the lake. If Subhas Sarobar is not included in the National Lake Conservation Project (NLCP), like Rabindra Sarobar, its future looks bleak,? added Majumdar. 

 Research scholars Nihar Ranjan Samal and Pankaj Roy are currently doing a chemical analysis of the water samples from the lake.

 ?We have sent a proposal to the central government for Subhas Sarobar?s inclusion in the NLCP. We are yet to get a reply,? said a deputy secretary of the urban development department.

 ?The CIT is now exploring the feasibility of developing Subhas Sarobar in conjunction with private parties,? revealed the Trust?s chief engineer Dibyendu Biswas. 

 ?We will welcome the inclusion of Subhas Sarobar in the NLCP. But we are against the privatisation of the waterbody in the name of joint venture,? asserted assistant secretary of WBAA Arun Nandy. 

 The CIT itself can develop Subhas Sarobar into a recreation centre and introduce an entry fee for visitors, he suggested.

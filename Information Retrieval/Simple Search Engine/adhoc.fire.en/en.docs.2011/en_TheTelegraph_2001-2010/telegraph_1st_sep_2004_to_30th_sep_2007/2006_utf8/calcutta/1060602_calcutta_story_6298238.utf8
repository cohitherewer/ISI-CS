The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Timeout

 Full of comic absurdities and hilarious situations, Garur Garir Headlight is all about some light-hearted entertainment. A wealthy widower, Swabalambi Ghosh, wishes to set up an actors? troupe. To recruit members who will form the group of his dreams, he advertises in the local newspaper. This initiates a flood of responses, though from persons with little experience in the theatre profession. A confectioner expresses his interest to be the playwright, while a partly-deaf, retired army-man, a stammerer, a flirtatious youth, an opera singer, a couple of street-hoodlums and an extortionist make up the list of would-be actors. An eccentric gentleman fills up the post of the director. And when Ghosh can find no actress to perform in the group?s maiden production, he gets his sister-in-law to play the role. A researcher in psychology, she begins to experiment with her theories within the troupe, setting off a series of funny and, at the same time, interesting turn of events. Direction: Saroj Roy.

 SEBANTI SARKAR

 The Natya Shodh Sansthan building in Salt Lake

 Natya Shodh Sansthan, the independent city-based society devoted to researching various aspects of Indian theatre and preservation of manuscripts, pictures and other production items, is celebrating its silver jubilee. 

 The inaugural function on July 19 will feature luminaries such as Badal Sircar, Shyamanand Jalan and Girish Karnad. An exhibition on 25 years of theatre in eastern India, theatre songs by Vinod Nagpal and his group, a play by Bohurupee, a seminar on theatre archiving and screening of rare recordings from the society?s collection will be the highlights of the celebrations at Sisir Mancha and Gaganendra Pradarshashala from July 19 to July 21.

 Founded in 1981 as a wing of Upchar trust by Girish Karnad, Vijay Tendulkar, P.L. Deshpande, Satyadev Dubey, Pratibha Agarwal, Kumar Roy and others, the society now has a well-stocked archive, library, research and publication department and video and audio recording centre. One of the oldest books in the collection is a compilation of three German plays translated to English by Benjamin Thompson in 1811. Natya Shodh also has snaps of Rabindranath Tagore and Bhartendu Harishchandra on stage, models of stage decor, including that of Dakghar (by Abanindranath Tagore and Nandalal Bose), Nabanna, Kallol and Bisarjan.

 There are scores of costumes, masks, puppets, logos (dating back to 1930), letters, first editions of plays and rare audio discs. Harindranath Dutta, Manmatha Roy, Shyamanand Jalan and Jogesh Dutta have donated some of the items. ?We have manuscripts of plays by Girish Karnad, Habib Tanvir, Vijay Tendulkar, Badal Sircar, Sumitra Nandan Panth, Jochchon Dastidar and many others,? said Pratibha Agarwal, a theatre worker, scholar and translator associated with Sansthan.

 From twice-a-week meetings at Abhinav Bharati School to a nine-cottah property in Salt Lake, the organisation has come a long way. ?It has grown manifold. The library, with its audio/video section, has about 100 annual members. Since we have a system of daily reading membership against a nominal price, our reach is certainly much wider. We are now trying to redesign our website,? stated Agarwal.

 PARTY TIME: Nightspots are recording a rise in Bengali clientele. A Telegraph picture

 The Bengali bhadralok has learnt to live life kingsize. 

 Gone are the days of the occasional outings and quiet family dinners at a Park Street eatery. The bhadralok is now making a beeline for discotheques, lounge bars and resto-bars. 

 Bengalis have suddenly emerged as a strong target group for us. We have always had them as customers, but the number was negligible. Now, however, they are an important segment, says Anirban Simlai of The Park. 

 According to him, Someplace Else, Tantra and Roxy some of the most happening nightspots in Calcutta have witnessed a cumulative rise of 40 to 45 per cent Bengali clientele in the past few years. 

 The phenomenon is not restricted to The Park alone. 

 If industry sources are anything to go by, the segment has witnessed a phenomenal 45 per cent to 50 per cent increase in Bengali clientele in the past three years. 

 A number of factors ranging from comfort with the corporate culture to higher disposable incomes and global exposure to safety at party places has contributed to this shift in lifestyle, suggests Saikat Sarkar, general manager of Souravs: the Food Pavilion. 

 In the past three to four years, the business culture in Calcutta has undergone a sea change, which is reflected when these managers and executives come out in their personal capacity, explains Sarkar.

 Sociologists argue that the trend can be linked to an aspiration among Bengali youth to change the lifestyle of their parents and adopt something thats more contemporary. 

 This segment among Bengalis comprises professionals, who are always aspiring to move up and acquire status. Clubbing being the most happening thing now, they are taking to it to gain a status symbol, explains Bholanath Bandopadhyay, professor of Sociology, Calcutta University.

 But the most important factor has been the increase in the spending power of the youth segment, which gets reflected in terms of higher billing, that has gone up by 40 per cent.

 Security at these hotspots has also played a very important role in getting peace-loving Bengali customers. All the party destinations keep a vigil on the crowd to offer safe and secure partying.

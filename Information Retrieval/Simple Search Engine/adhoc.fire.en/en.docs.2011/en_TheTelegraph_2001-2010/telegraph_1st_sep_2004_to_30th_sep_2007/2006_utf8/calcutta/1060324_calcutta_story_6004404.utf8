 The most common image in the art world is the human form. Almost all visual artists depict its beauty and balance, while others turn to it as a way of expressing their thoughts about life. Celebrating the Human Form, the ongoing exhibition of Indian paintings and sculptures, offers a comparative appreciation of all styles of art that portray it, including expressions of deep emotion, spirituality, sexuality, frivolity and mindfulness. Aglow with the aura of sensual romanticism, the painting (picture left) by Bratin Khan presents a brilliant instance of the fine poise and rhythm of both male and female forms. Ranging from the sublime to the outrageous, the works attempt to arouse a refreshing curiosity about various aspects of the human body, giving us an opportunity to recognize and feel the ever-changing nature of the physical expression of our beings. Challenging current local thought patterns, behaviours, mindsets and naive perceptions, it yet does not offend our aesthetic sensibilities.

When: Till March 31, 10.30 am - 7.30 pm

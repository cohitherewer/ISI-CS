 The residents of a south Calcutta neighbourhood had a close shave on Friday morning, when two carbon dioxide-filled cylinders exploded in a car. No one was injured.

 The car, an Armada, was parked on Vivekananda Road, under Jadavpur East police station, by its owner Kanailal Agarwal, who runs a nursing home in Burdwan. He has been arrested on charges of ?gross negligence?. The cylinders, he later told police, were meant to be used during surgery.

 Around 8.15 am, residents of the locality were jolted by a deafening sound that triggered fears of the recent blasts in Mumbai and Kashmir. Witnesses said the roof of the car was blown off by the impact of the blast. 

 The cylinders, too, were blown to pieces. A part of one of the cylinders flew over a three-storeyed building and landed on another house.

 ?I was cooking when I heard the sound. Initially, I thought someone had burst a cracker. But then a chunk of iron landed on the floor through the tiled roof and I panicked. I was lucky as it fell inches away from me,? said Sarmistha Lodh, a resident.

 Susanta Dutta, another local resident, recalled: ?I was within a few metres of the blast site. I suddenly heard the sound amidst a downpour and stared running.?

 Immediately after the blast, Citu leaders rushed out of their office nearby and tried to pacify the crowd. Local CPM workers urged the residents through the public address system to remain calm.

 ?The spot is close to the Jadavpur railway crossing and there are a number of schools around,? said Tapan Dasgupta, a CPM leader. 

 ?There is also a market nearby. Besides, a large number of cars and pedestrians use the road. To prevent any untoward incident, we requested the crowd over microphone not to spread rumours,? he added.

 A police contingent, led by South 24-Parganas superintendent of police S.N. Gupta, soon cordoned off the area.

 Bejoy Agarwal, a relative of Kanailal, who owns the car, said the cylinders were filled in Tangra on Thursday night.

 ?Kanailal owns a nursing home on a partnership basis in Borhat, Burdwan. The cylinders were to be taken there. A patient from Burdwan, who came to Calcutta for treatment, was to accompany us,? said Bejoy. 

 He said they were about to start for Burdwan when the explosion occurred.

 ?It might have been a disaster. Fortunately, no one was injured,? the police superintendent said.

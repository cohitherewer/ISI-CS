The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Now, LRT from Joka to Panihati

 - Route altered on advice 

of Japanese consultant

 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE

 The route of the proposed Light Rail Transit (LRT) has been revised, as advised by the Japan Railway Technical Services (JRTS), a consultant of the Japanese government.

 Instead of one arm running from Esplanade to Salt Lake, along Beleghata Canal, the new route extends from Joka to Panihati, via Esplanade. The total route length remains 29 km and the investment, Rs 24,000 crore.

 ?The new alignment has been finalised after taking into account all aspects. Let the project start and then we can make some modifications to the route,? said transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury.

 The state government had engaged JRTS to prepare the feasibility report for LRT, as the Japan Bank for International Cooperation, which is likely to fund the project, does not accept reports prepared by any other agency. The JRTS report was submitted last month.

 The Japanese consultants, who will inspect the proposed route and meet the chief minister and senior officials on Monday, have told the government that the LRT should run along a north-south corridor. 

 For linking the city?s flanks, they suggested that the East-West Metro would be the best. 

 The Japan bank has posed a series of queries to the government. They include: 

 How the investment will be recovered 

 Which agency will implement the project

 Mode of implementation

 Source of the operation and maintenance funds

 The possible impact on the environment

 Whether uninterrupted power supply can be ensured

 Whether the project will entail eviction. 

 ?We will reply to all their queries when they come to the city,? transport secretary Chowdhury said. ?We will also submit the environment impact assessment report soon, as asked by the bank.?

 The government has decided to involve a private company in implementing the project. Consulting Engineering Services has been asked to choose one from four short-listed firms ? Amex International (USA), Siemens (Germany), BHEL (India) and SREI-Metrail (UK).

 ?The bank has stipulated that the private partner must have the experience of handling similar projects. Besides, the technology that will be employed has to be safe. Keeping in mind all these criteria, we will decide on the partner on June 27. Each of short-listed companies will have to make a presentation,? said a transport department official.

 Chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb said on Sunday: ?Now, there is no cloud over the project. We have had fresh discussions with the Japan bank. It has agreed in principle to provide funds. The Centre has also assured us of help in obtaining money from the bank.?

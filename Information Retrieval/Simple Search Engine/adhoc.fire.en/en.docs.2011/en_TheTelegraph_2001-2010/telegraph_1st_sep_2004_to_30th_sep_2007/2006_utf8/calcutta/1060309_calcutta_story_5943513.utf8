 Hired killer in CID net

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A team of six policemen from Bhabani Bhavan, headquarters of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), raided a hideout at Chhapra, Bihar, and rounded up hired killer Tapan Das late on Tuesday.

 Topa, as the man is better known, was said to be the terror of the city?s northern fringes and one of the most wanted criminals.

 The police said Topa was involved in more than two dozen murders. 

 ?Besides, a number of extortion and robbery cases are pending against him,? said an officer, adding: ?Initially, we have slapped six murder and extortion cases on him.?

 According to records available with the police, Topa shot from close quarters a local CPM activist, identified as Uttam Adhikary, a few months ago at Kalyani, and then hacked him to death in a field.

 ?A year ago, Topa had murdered Adhikary?s elder brother and local civic body member Monu in the same manner,? said the officer. 

 ?Topa stepped into the crime world with the help of gangster Bombat. But he murdered his mentor within a couple of years. He also killed Sukha, another rival, in North 24-Parganas,? added the officer.

 CID officers were trying to arrest Topa after netting Hubba Shyamal, a killer from Hooghly, as he came out of a multiplex. Though the police had activated their network two months ago, the first lead reached the CID headquarters on Monday. Soon, a team of officers from the special operation group was sent to Chhapra.

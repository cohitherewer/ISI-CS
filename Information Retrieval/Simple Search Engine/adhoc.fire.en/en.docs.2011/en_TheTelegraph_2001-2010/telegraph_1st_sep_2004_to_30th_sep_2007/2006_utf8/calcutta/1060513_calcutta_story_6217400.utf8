 The Good Samaritan cop

 A STAFF REPORTER

 While pedestrians walked past a man who lay unconscious on the pavement of Gariahat on Friday, a traffic sergeant came to his rescue. The Good Samaritan rushed the sick man, in his early 60s, to a nearby hospital, stood all the while beside his bed and finally ensured that he was back home safe.

 P.S. Mukherjee, the sergeant attached to south-east traffic guard, noticed the man, identified as Debaprasad Das. He realised that he was unconscious. No curious onlooker came forward to help him.

 ?Mukherjee hailed a taxi and rushed the man to Ramakrishna Mission Seva Pratishthan,? said Ranvir Kumar, joint commissioner of police (traffic department).

 The doctor attending to Das told Mukherjee that the man had suffered a sun-stroke. 

 ?He was also dehydrated,? said an officer of the traffic guard. ?Doctors put Das on drips and after two hours, he opened his eyes.?

 Das told police that he was from Haltu, in Kasba. ?He gave the telephone number of his residence. We contacted Das?s wife. But she was in no position to take her husband back home because she herself was ill,? said joint commissioner Kumar.

 Sergeant Mukherjee then contacted his traffic guard office, urging that a constable be sent to the hospital to escort Das back home. After returning to his office, Mukherjee called up the Das residence to ensure that he had reached home safe.

 As the news reached Lalbazar, Mukherjee?s superiors appreciated his act. It will be mentioned in the record of his service book.

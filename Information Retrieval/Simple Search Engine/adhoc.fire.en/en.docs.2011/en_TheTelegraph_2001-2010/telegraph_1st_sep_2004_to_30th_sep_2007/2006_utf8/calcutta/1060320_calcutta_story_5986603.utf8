 Tailor-made schemes to draw customers

 Diptimoy Ghosh: BSNL introduces schemes so frequently that it becomes difficult for a customer to decide whether he will continue with a scheme or switch over to a new one.

 The schemes are introduced for the benefit of the customer. If a customer goes through the features of our schemes carefully, he will definitely find one that is tailor-made for him.

 We publish advertisements in newspapers, operate helplines and upload the details of the schemes on our websites to keep customers abreast of the latest offers. We also organise roadshows and set up stalls at different fairs to promote our schemes.

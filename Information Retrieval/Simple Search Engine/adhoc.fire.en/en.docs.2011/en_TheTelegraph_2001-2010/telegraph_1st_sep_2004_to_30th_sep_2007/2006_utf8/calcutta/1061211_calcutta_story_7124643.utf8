The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Few takers for 24-hr service

 Dhananjay dutta, general secretary of West Bengal Rajya Bus Yatri Samity, met readers of The Telegraph and answered their queries. 

Participants included Sandip Banerjee, Sushmita Roy, Sandhya Majumdar, Tapan Das, Kajal Ghosh, Ranjan Talukdar, Kalyani Mitra and Swapan Dutta

 Sandip Banerjee: Recently, the state government has announced a proposal to launch a 24-hour bus service to the IT park in Salt Lake. Do you welcome such a proposal, in the backdrop of the unsatisfactory law and order situation in the city, especially in Salt Lake?

 People across Calcutta have a wrong notion about the law and order situation in Salt Lake. Most think that it is very unsafe to travel during the night. Eve-teasing, snatching, robbery and theft are quite common even during the day. 

 The government may take the credit for launching such a bus service, but what kind of response will it get is quite unpredictable. What will happen to the passengers, if the bus breaks down in midnight? I feel there are few takers for such services.

 I want to share my experience of travelling by a midnight bus in 2004. The bus was coming from Sealdah to Esplanade. A middle-aged man was travelling with his family. It was around 1 am, the bus driver and conductor asked us to get off the bus near Great Eastern Hotel. We were forced to walk down a lonely stretch to Esplanade. 

 I had written to transport minister Subhas Chakraborty, then managing director of Calcutta Surface Transport Corporation Asok Bhattacharya and the deputy commissioner of police (traffic). But none of them gave me any feedback.

Sushmita Roy: The public transport situation in Calcutta can be compared to the pre-historic era, for the private buses of 1970s are still plying on the roads. Some of the buses are older than the Left government in the state. The city has the worst private buses in the country, which are nothing but polluting machines. Can we expect better buses on the road?

 Sandip Banerjee: Our present government is quite bus owner-friendly, particularly our transport minister Subhas Chakraborty. He is always keen on protecting the money-minting interests of the bus owners. Earlier this year, when the oil prices shot up, the government decided to increase the bus fare, even before the bus owners asked for a hike. Now, when the oil prices have come down in the international market, why arent the bus fares being revised ? What is your stand? 

 Your point is absolutely right. We have already written to the transport minister on November 30, demanding a revision in the fare structure as the oil prices have tumbled down in the global market. Oil is now cheaper by Rs 10 per barrel. 

 If the state government does not take any initiative to revise the fare structure, we will launch a mass movement in January 2007.

Sandhya Majumdar: Catching a train from Howrah station is quite nightmarish. The whole stretch from Tea Board till the flyover-end is always clogged by mini and private buses from Dasnagar, Belur Math and Salkia. There are no police or traffic sergeants to control the situation. Can you help us?

 I will take up this issue with police and the government. But I think police and the traffic department are aware of the situation. 

 A section of police, trade union leaders and some government officials are being bribed by the bus owners. The passengers interests are neglected. This is a political game. 

Tapan Das: It is mandatory for trucks to display technical details of the vehicle, including the year of deployment. Why arent similar rules applied for private buses?

 I appreciate your suggestion. I will write to the transport department and steps will be taken.

 To be concluded

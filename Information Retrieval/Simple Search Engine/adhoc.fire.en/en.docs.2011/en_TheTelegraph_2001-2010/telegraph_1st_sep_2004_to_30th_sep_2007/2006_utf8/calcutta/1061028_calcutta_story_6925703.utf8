The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Cop warranty for Maidan

 PRONAB MONDAL

 Dont worry, the Maidan will soon be a safer place to go to after dark. This was the assurance held out by Calcutta Police three days after the recovery of a murder victims decomposed body on the greens.

 Metro had carried two articles 

 on how dangerous the Maidan was in the dark .

 People are welcome to the citys vast green zone, either for an evening stroll or to spend time with friends and family. We will provide them security and assistance, said Ajay Kumar, deputy commissioner of police (south).

 Elaborating on security plans for the Maidan post-sunset, Kumar said: The first thing we will do is intensify vigil in the entire 2.5-sq-km area. Starting Friday night, policemen have been asked to patrol the area, covering each and every narrow road leading to the tents of different sports organisations which remain in the dark.

 The number of policemen on night patrol duty on the Maidan is being doubled. Instead of a group of four constables on bicycles and an officer with three other policemen on night vigil, at least 14 policemen, on bicycles and jeeps, will be deployed. And they will keep patrolling the area from sunset, said an officer of Maidan police station.

 What about the other safety aspect on the darkened greens, where if criminals dont get you rogue cops in plain clothes surely will?

 From now on, if we receive even a single complaint of extortion and the policemen are identified by the victims, they will face stern action, from suspension to arrest, asserted Kumar, requesting people not to be cowed down by bad cops on the prowl but to alert the nearest policeman in uniform or approach the nearest police station.

 Police, however, had a word of caution for those keen to spend time on the Maidan after dusk. Do stick to the stretch along the thoroughfares that are illuminated and avoid the dark interiors of the Maidan... In case of anything untoward, do approach the police kiosk in front of the Fort William main gate, Kumar concluded.

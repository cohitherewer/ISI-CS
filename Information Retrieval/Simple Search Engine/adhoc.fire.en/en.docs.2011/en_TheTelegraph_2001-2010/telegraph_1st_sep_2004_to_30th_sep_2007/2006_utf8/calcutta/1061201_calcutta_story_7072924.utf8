The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Navy lines up air show

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Come January, Calcutta will have its first aerobatics show, courtesy the Indian Navy.

 Four aircraft of the navys Sagar Pawan will hold the show. Sources said the aerobatics show over the Hooghly is scheduled for January 25. 

 The aircraft will fly to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport at Dum Dum and then over the river near Millennium Park. 

 The show duration will be not more than 15 minutes, after which the aircraft will return back to the airport.

 We have sought permission from the civil aviation ministry for the show, Commodore Bhaskar Ranjan Sen, naval officer-in-charge, West Bengal told Metro on Thursday.

 Officials said the show was shifted to Dum Dum airport as the runway at the Indian Air Force base in Barrackpore was too small for holding an aerobatics exhibition. 

 There are some technical issues which need to be sorted out. The operations at Dum Dum airport will be stopped for nearly an hour for the show, a navy official said. 

 Sagar Pawan, the aerobatics team of the navy, was formed three years back and has performed similar aerobatics shows in Mumbai and Vizag with four single-seater fighter planes. This is the first time that the navy is holding an exhibition in Calcutta. 

 A big naval show with Eastern Fleet is also being planned in Calcutta in January. Plans are afoot to bring four to seven ships of Eastern Fleet from Vizag to the city for the show, Sen said.

 He added that a naval services selection board centre would be set up at Diamond Harbour. The centre, to recruit naval officers, would be the third in the country after Bangalore and Bhopal. 

 Previously, the land was a base for naval guns and was lying unused. 

 The centre would facilitate youth from the Northeast and other eastern states to take the examinations and serve the country. It will be operational in three to four years. These days, guns have become obsolete, so we thought of using the land to train the young, said Sen. 

 He denied plans to set up a missile base in Haldia. We will use the unused stretch in Haldia to build up the defence of the state. But nothing has been planned, he signed off.

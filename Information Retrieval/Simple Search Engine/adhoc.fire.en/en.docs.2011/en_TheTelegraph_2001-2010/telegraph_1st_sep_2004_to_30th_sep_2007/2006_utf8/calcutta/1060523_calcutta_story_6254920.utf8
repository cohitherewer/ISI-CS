 Though his earlier paintings were based on religion, myth and the status of women in society, the current works of Mustak Khan Chowdhury project the agony and suffering endured by our inner selves in a world steeped in dishonesty, hatred and corruption, and reflects the decadence of modern society. Using symbols loaded with religious significance like rotten apples, worms feeding on putrid fruit, angels, beasts and scenes of heaven and hell, the artist evokes the evolution of life and depicts the degeneration of man from his former ideal image to his present debased self. Working with watercolours, oil pastels, acrylic, mixed media on paper and canvas board, his experiments with different mediums have enabled him to attain textural richness with saturated colours in his paintings. His palette ranges from golden yellow and red to dark blue, green and brown. Clearly, the artist has great expertise in doing delicate arabesques of architectural detail, interwoven with graceful, lyrical and figurative elements.

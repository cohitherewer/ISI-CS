The latter half of Day I of the India Fashion Week Spring-Summer 2006 at The Grand in New Delhi clearly belonged to Rohit Bal. Though the collection held no big surprises the trademark whites and off-whites with impeccable cuts and craftsmanship thats oh-so-Rohit the recipe was just right for a rocking show that the designer is a master at putting together.

 Rohits signature white line always works its magic on the crowd and it did just that on Wednesday night. The beautifully done-up set with gold leaves printed on the ramp floor, fresh lotuses lining the stage and dreamy white curtains bordering it added a dash of drama. But the best was cleverly saved for the last when Arjun Rampal, looking super hot in all white, walked in whistling the Kill Bill tune. The show was an instant hit, with the crowd lapping up both the first Bollywood presence on the WLIFW ramp and the whistling tune that works wonders to pep up the mood of any show.

 Though a quite throwback to Rohits show at the Lakme India Fashion Week 2005 when the snowy whites and the same tune had created the same magic it brought the otherwise staid evening at The Grand to a lively end.

 Inspired by the purity and ethereal nature of Nacre: Mother of Pearl, Rohits collection had a serene feel with creams, ivories and whites. Pleating, layering, applique and tonal embroidery embellished the clothes from bolero jackets to long coats, from fitted skirts to ruffled ones.

 Devoid of any glitter or shimmer, the only hint of glint was in the form of antique metal wire work in silver or gold and exquisite gold leaf printing. The chakra formed the main motif, appearing every now and then in various forms. The wow factor: a range of long bubble skirts.

The earlier part of the evening belonged to Calcutta, with Anamika Khanna and Monapali showcasing back to back. Anamika, a regular at the London Fashion Week now, failed to strike a chord with the Delhi audience. Her nature-inspired collection titled The Botanist was dubbed boring and repetitive by many in the crowd.

 The restricted colour palette whites and beiges with a hint of green did have a monotonous effect, as did the limited silhouettes wrap-dresses, wrap-tops, shift dresses, long dresses, stretch leggings and little more.

 Textured muslins and chiffons shaped the clothes, and a general lack of lustre added to the disappointment. The central motif a potted plant in old-style floral painting dotted the garments, attempting to highlight the nature theme. A need to be in touch with nature was established more through her gesture of handing out potted plants to the first-rowers before the show, rather than through the clothes themselves.

 With a strict eye on global forecasts for spring-summer 2007, Anamika, however, is certain the collection will work at the London Fashion Week. The colour palette keeps in mind international forecast for the coming spring-summer, stressed the designer with a studio on Outram Street.

 Calcuttas veteran duo Mona Lamba and Pali Sachdev took the ramp next, showcasing a collection titled Thesis and Antithesis. While it didnt manage to generate much enthusiasm in the crowd, one must give it to Monapali for variety. Starting off with the seasons favourite white palette, the three-part collection scored on silhouettes. Pleats, pin-tucks, ruching and layers defined the look of the flowing white chiffon silhouettes dresses, skirts, halters and more.

 The collection then moved on to a vintage, textured feel with the palette getting a bright makeover with blues, yellows, blacks and neutrals. Kantha combined with handpaint and block prints marked the clothes. Back to a subdued black-and-white line inspired by yin and yang, the show ended with models sashaying saris with unusual innovations on the pallu.

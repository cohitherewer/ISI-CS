 Playing hide and seek with reality

 One of Jayashree Chakravarty?s canvases on view at Galerie 88

 Viewing Jayashree Chakravarty?s latest works, being exhibited at Galerie 88, is like peeking into her turbulent mind. Here, myriad ideas and dreams and memories keep surfacing every moment. They jostle with each other and some get snowed over by fresh ones, although they are still visible, off and on, like phantoms. 

 Then, the explosion of lines and colours and forms resolves, and the images fall into place on her large canvases. As the eyes get used to the turmoil, her paintings gradually look tranquil, like the surface of a very deep lake whose mysteries are yet to be fathomed.

 Of the painters born in the Fifties, Chakravarty?s art has the distinction of maturing and transmuting with age, and incorporating new ideas and modes of expression, to which she may have been exposed or which may have influenced her. She is among the few artists of her generation who has the courage to break out of her mould and evolve without bothering about the demands of the market. So, although her work is easily identifiable, each period has a distinction of its own.

 Chakravarty?s art has become more cerebral over the years, but all her work has one element in common. The most striking feature of her canvases is their strong painterly quality, as she adeptly creates a rich surface texture that produces the illusion of being continuously in motion. 

 She uses her brush, palette knife, fingers and imprints of what is popularly known as bubble wrap and other plastic packaging for the desired effect. Although her technique does not change, yet the effect varies from canvas to canvas.

 In her smaller works, she introduces ideas that germinate and flower in her larger paintings. The surprising variety of textures she creates on these few square centimetres never ceases to amaze viewers. She uses acrylic paint and her palette is limited to browns, black, white, ochre, yellow and indigo but the work looks enamelled.

 Quivering, nervous lines, like seismographs or electroencephelographs, undulate and creep over the canvases. These merge with nebulae created by stabs of white paint. The umbilical chord garlands the painting.

 Swimming in this amniotic fluid are shoals of fish, faces that could have been dreamt up, vaguely Oriental heads, butterflies taking wing, locusts, centipedes, flowers, mandalas, hills and mountain ranges, spires and colonial buildings. These are depicted with occasional bursts of pinks and reds and violets ? colours not seen elsewhere on her canvases.

 Drawing is Chakravarty?s strongpoint. Yet these images look like they were delineated on shifting sands, instability being a quality inherent to them. In one particular canvas, one can only see shreds and scraps of images freely floating over its surface, playing hide and seek with the eyes of the viewer. This quality that befuddles the viewer was present in her earlier works, too, but now it gives a distinctive stamp to her art.

 One of the joys of viewing Chakravarty?s paintings is trying to break through the surfaces she builds up so expertly and gaining entry into the world of her imagination. Trying to figure out what exactly she has in mind could be an intriguing task for it is difficult to pin down her thoughts. 

 It could also, perhaps, be an intimidating exercise. For, these canvases constantly challenge the viewer?s ability to confront a fractured reality. This is what makes Chakravarty so unique.

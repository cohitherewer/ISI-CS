 ?Police? in tourist robbery

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Ask for directions in Calcutta and get your purse snatched by a ?cop?.

 A Japanese tourist learned this the hard way on Friday afternoon when a man masquerading as a Calcutta Police officer robbed her of Rs 1,850, off Park Street.

 L. Tsui, a 24-year-old Japanese student, has been in the city for the past few days for a research project.

 On Friday, as she asked around for directions on Middleton Row to go to the Indian Museum, a man identifying himself as a plainclothes policeman volunteered to accompany her.

 As the two approached Loreto College, the man snatched Tsui?s purse, got into a waiting taxi and sped off.

 The Japanese student raised an alarm and then lodged a complaint with Park Street police station.

 ?We have to ascertain whether it was really a plainclothes policeman or someone posing as one. An investigation is on,? said Mohammad Akram, officer-in-charge of Park Street police station.

 ?The victim described the snatcher as a middle-aged man with a moustache, clad in a white shirt and blue trousers. He was also not very fluent in English,? an officer added, on a ?bad cop? day for the force in town.

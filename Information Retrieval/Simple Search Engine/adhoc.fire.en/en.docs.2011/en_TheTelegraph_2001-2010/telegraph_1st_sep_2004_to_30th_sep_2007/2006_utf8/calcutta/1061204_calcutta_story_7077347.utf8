 Calcutta got its first helpline for the physically and mentally-challenged on World Disability Day, November 3. Started by a private organisation, Sruti Disability Rights Centre, the helpline, 033-24418080, is available every Tuesday and Thursday between 11 am and 5 pm. In between, queries can be sent to the email address sruti.darcgmail.com.

 The disability act was introduced 10 years ago. But one can see few signs of its implementation. Working in this field for the past 15 years, I know how difficult it is to get information about services and aids, rued Shampa Sengupta, director, Sruti Disability Rights Centre.

 Many NGOs and groups across the state offer services like special schools or treatment centres, but as the information is not being spread, the centres are not easily accessible.

 Maharashtra has a helpline, which also caters to some other states. But there are no helplines in West Bengal. Parents call us to find out about vocational training or where they can get certain equipment and medicines. Many are still unaware of legal rights of the disabled. So, as soon as our centre was formed, we thought of setting up this helpline, said Sengupta.

 The helpline aims to provide information on special schools, aids and appliances, shelter homes, legal aid, government policies, special employment exchange, scholarships, counselling, loans, medical assistance, vocational training, parent groups and community-based organisations.

 Using just a handful of volunteers, Sruti has tapped various organisations in Calcutta, Howrah, Hooghly, North and South 24-Parganas. Initially, we planned to launch a website, but later thought that a telephone link can reach a greater number of people, observed Sengupta. 

 Information on various categories of disabilities, ranging from visual, speech and hearing impairment, mental retardation, cerebral palsy and autism is also available. But we have very little information on multiple disabilities. Plans are afoot to cover that area in the coming months and reach out more and more people. We also plan to increase our working hours and come up with a directory in the future, signed off Sengupta.

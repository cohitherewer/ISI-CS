 IM THE KING OF THE WORLD

 If 

 SABYASACHI MUKHERJEE struck the Titanic pose after 

 his Lakme Fashion Week show at NCPA in Mumbai, on Thursday 

 afternoon, he had his reasons. After all, Bollywoods 

 queen of hearts Rani Mukherjee had termed his collection 

 pure poetry and buyers from near and far had 

 gone ga-ga over The Snail.

 With its clean simplicity, The Snail was a complete deviation from Sabyasachis signature Frog style elements ? no trademark layering, no patent patchwork, no signature silhouettes and no brocade borders. The unusual music accompanying the catwalk ? it started off with Kamalas song from City of Joy and went on to Leonard Cohen, Evita, the theme tune of Godfather, Tshaikovskys Nut Cracker and finally U2 ? created a magical mood. Models with largely make-up-free faces (just bright red lips) had hair tied back in buns and plaits, and sported chunky wristwatches, mens wear shoes and leather floaters.

 In an era of mass production, the collection is all about slowing down, said the designer about The Snail that took four months to conceive and one-and-a-half months to execute.

 Structured, classic silhouettes, controlled volume, unusual colour combinations with subdued hues, subtle texturing, ancient embroidery and discharge printing injected an old-world charm into the post-modern, neo-romantic collection. The shapes were unusual, with a strong Japanese bent. A variety of dresses ? from oversized T-shirt ones to hobble of the 1930s to 1940s Wimbledon costumes to school uniforms and more. Cotton dominated the line, with muls aplenty, combined with a dash of organza, handmade silk and velvets. Kantha was the prominent threadwork, with touches of French embroidery. A fair amount of quilting was noticed.

 The response is much more 

 than I had expected, smiled Sabyasachi.

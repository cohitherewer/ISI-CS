The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Eating out, 

 eating in

 Why Bengalis are either flocking to 

 restaurants serving Bengali cuisine or dialling D for dolma

 Shiloo Chattopadhyay

 Diya, 

 my first cousin, was insistent. Dinner at her place was 

 non-negotiable. The first couple of hours were spent reminiscing 

 and playing Sudoku with my nephew and niece. Dinner was 

 announced. The food was delicious and brought back nostalgic 

 memories. The menu was entirely Bengali, dishes handpicked 

 and the cooking authentic. My aunt would have been proud 

 to serve the fare. I was marvelling at Diya?s ability to 

 remember the recipes of her childhood and maintain her culinary 

 skills.

 The following day, on the back 

 page of this paper, I saw the photograph of a Bengali film 

 star inaugurating yet another speciality restaurant serving 

 Bengali delicacies. The restaurant promised to undertake 

 home delivery within a 2-km radius. Indeed, in the past 

 few years Calcutta has seen a huge spurt in premium restaurants 

 serving Bengali food. Gone are the days when a visitor to 

 the city could not be taken to any presentable restaurant 

 serving local fare. There was a very plausible explanation 

 for the dearth of good Bengali restaurants. The locals did 

 not prefer their own cuisine when they were eating out. 

 Why eat food that is available at home?

 Today, however, if you walk into 

 Bay of Bengal after enjoying Fanaa in Menoka, the 

 crowd you meet will be mostly Bengalis. What has prompted 

 this complete volte-face? For the middle to upper-middle-class 

 Bengali, the in-home lifestyle has changed completely. On 

 the one hand gadgets have made daily life a lot easier. 

 On the debit side, child rearing has become more time consuming. 

 Then there are these supermarkets and shopping malls that 

 have come up. Quite a few hours of ?her? day goes in evaluation 

 of their wares. So the lifestyle of today?s housewife has 

 changed but on balance she is more harassed than before. 

 Naturally, if she has the same number of hours but more 

 things to do than her mother, then something?s got to give.

 The nuclear character of today?s 

 family has helped. There are very few ?live-in? mother-in-laws 

 to teach or to prod. We only have live-in maids who delight 

 us with their rural cuisine. There lies the catch. At home, 

 we no longer eat malaikari and kochi panthar jhol, 

 potoler dolma and patishapta. So these delicacies 

 by virtue of their rarity have now earned a place on the 

 menu of our eating-out party. Little wonder that the restaurants 

 serving Bengali cuisine are laughing all the way from the 

 kitchen to the bank.

 There, of course, is another somewhat 

 deeper sociological reason for their popularity. Lack of 

 social recognition has been the age-old grievance of the 

 homemaker. In this world full of MCPs, running homes has 

 never been given as much value as earning salaries from 

 a clerical job. Social recognition of the role of the homemaker 

 remains elusive.

 One suspects that this is the 

 real need gap that Bengali restaurants are fulfilling. Remember 

 the delicious food that Diya served me. And remember that 

 newspaper report announcing the arrival of yet another Bengali 

 restaurant that highlighted home-delivery facility. That 

 indeed is the connection. Food from such restaurants blends 

 easily with the dal bhat cooked at home. The boss 

 from office, the long-lost friend, the visiting aunt, no 

 one can tell the difference. By default, the credit goes 

 to the lady of the house. The applause in her life returns. 

 The unsung heroine gets another chance to take a bow. Long 

 live the Queen; Long live Home Delivery.

 And may God this day give me my 

 daily bread! At home!

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Tram depot plan dumped

 - Private offers on terminus estates prove insufficient

 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s plans to develop two Calcutta Tramways Company (CTC) depots with the help of private partners have hit a roadblock.

 The transport department has cancelled the tender it had floated in January. The reason: the offers are ?insufficient and unsatisfactory?.

 Faced with a severe funds crunch and the chief minister?s directive to increase revenue, the transport department had decided to build commercial estates at the Tollygunge and Gariahat depots.

 The private partner would have had to bear the project cost but enjoyed the right to sell spaces and flats. It was also required to make a one-time payment.

 The Tollygunge and Gariahat depots stand on 28 bighas and 8.5 bighas of prime land, respectively. 

 The transport department intended to raise at least Rs 200 crore from the projects, in addition to developing the terminuses. The offers did not exceed Rs 100 crore.

 According to officials, six companies responded to the tender floated by the CTC, but only two of them submitted financial bids.

 ?We have cancelled the tender as we did not receive sufficient and satisfactory offers from private developers. At the moment, we are not proceeding further with the scheme and will decide on the next course of action later,?? transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury told Metro on Wednesday.

 ?Our plan was to procure new buses, repair tram tracks and buy the building on RN Mukherjee Road that houses the CTC headquarters with the money generated by developing the two depots. We are not giving up hope, despite facing a hurdle. We cannot leave such properties unutilised. We have started exploring alternative means for the purpose,?? asserted Chowdhury.

 As the plan was taken up after the chief minister?s nod, officials said, the matter has now been referred to him.

 Officials felt the terms and conditions set by the CTC had made it impossible for private builders to look at the project as a profitable venture, forcing them to back out.

 The plan, adopted in 2004, envisaged demolition of the existing structures at the depots. The ground floor of the new buildings would have housed tram and bus terminuses, waiting halls, staff rooms and other amenities.

 The floors above would have been utilised for residential and commercial purposes.

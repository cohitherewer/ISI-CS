 One of the most well-known professional photographers in India, Susanta Banerjee is considered a specialist and a master in the art of photomontage ? a photographic technique that relies on combining images creatively to make them acquire a wholly new meaning and expression. His ?combination printing? style and his conventional method of developing photographs in the darkroom make him stand a class apart in an age of mass-produced digital photographs. Hosted by Photographic Association of Dum Dum, the ongoing exhibition of his photographs presents images that deal with Banerjee?s favourite themes related to life, death and the eternal yearning for freedom. Providing an insight into the philosophical bent of his mind, his compositions convey a sense of the despair of modern times, at the same time offering a glimmer of hope for better days ahead. Expressing his concern at the depletion of natural resources, his photographs also make a strong statement for environment conservation.

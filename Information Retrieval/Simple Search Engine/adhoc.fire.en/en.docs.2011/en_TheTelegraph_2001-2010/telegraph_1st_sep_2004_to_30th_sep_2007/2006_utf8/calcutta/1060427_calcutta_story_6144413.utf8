 Ripping off reel styles

 Whether its Sridevis 

 Chandni saris or Ranis Babli patialas, the filmi dresser 

 updates her wardrobe with every hit look, finds out Shradha 

 Agarwal 

 Filmi fashion is primarily about characterisation, but if people can relate to those trends and convert them into hit designs? What can I say, its very encouraging, says the Bollywood badshah of design Manish Malhotra when you quiz him on filmi designs and dressers. 

 But thats how filmi dressers are. Slipping effortlessly from Kareena-style bustiers from K3G to Bablis patialas. 

 With one eye on the big screen and one on the gossip mags, their tailors are summoned more often than not to churn out their favourite heroines designs. 

 If thats too much of a hassle, 

 she can always hop over to the neighbourhood market to update 

 her style statement. GoodLife explores more, both 

 the mindset and the wardrobe of the filmi dresser

 Who is she?

 Manish finds these filmi dressers among the young, yuppie college crowd. Sometimes the older women spot the salwar kameez and sari trends, he adds. 

 Fashion designer Agnimitra Paul, too, defines this woman as someone who is in her 20s or early 30s.

 Theme talk

 The styling for filmi dressers follows no strict rules. The Babli look just has to be completed with the brocade potli, dangling earrings and kohl eyes. 

 Likewise, Kareenas Yuva girl on campus is all about the sling bag and comfy shoes.

 Must-haves

 The filmi dresser takes no time to update her wardrobe with each hit film. 

 Sometimes its Bengal shining in her wardrobe thanks to Devdas and Parineeta and sometimes it is all about empire lines and flowy silhouettes, a la Bipasha Basu in No Entry. 

 Nevertheless, some looks just linger on, filmi forever. Manish Malhotra draws up the essential list for such a wardrobe for GoodLife:

 Kurti

 Skirts ? both super short like Kareenas 36 

 Chinatown look or like Kajols flowy ones from 

 Fanaah

 Churidar kurtas in chiffon

 Chiffon saris, either shaded or solid colours

 Halter or cap-sleeve blouses

 Boot-cut jeans

 Denim skirts 

 Funky, filmi accessories like large bags 

 and cool caps

 Shop stops 

 Its not that tough for these filmi fashionistas nowadays, with copies and rip-offs available at every nook and corner. 

 Sometimes, these outfits also inspire many a design collection in high-end fashion boutiques. 

 They can also look around for outfits inspired by their screen icons at popular markets around town like:

 New Market

 Gariahat 

 Metro Plaza

 AC Market

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Simple, like the Oracle

 BISWARUP GOOPTU

 Bill Gates might have pipped him to the throne of the world?s richest man, but for a group of 50 students from Vinod Gupta School of Management, the B-school of IIT Kharagpur, the meeting with Warren Buffet was surely something to remember and cherish. 

 The ?Oracle of Omaha?, as Buffet is popularly known, spent time with the managers of tomorrow and touched on a range of topics, including his life, his learning and how he keeps it ?simple?.

 To the students? delight, Buffet wished he had more managers with an IIT background in his business. Gates too, he said, holds a similar view. IIT is certainly not an unfamiliar brand to Buffet, whose self-professed ?trusted aide? Ajit Singh is an IIT graduate. ?I would like to have more Ajits from IIT,? said Buffet.

 The reason behind the trip, between May 7 and 14, was to provide the students and faculty of the B-school with greater exposure to not only global institutions like University of Omaha (UNO), but also to closely interact with top honchos from Fortune 100 corporations. 

 ?It was an opportunity many students didn?t want to miss,? said Vinod Gupta.

 The eight-day trip saw students and faculty of the management school interacting with the CEO of Union Pacific, Jim Young, and his team and discussing everything about his company.

 ?The clarity with which these companies interacted with the students speaks a lot about the relationship UNO shares with these companies and also the respect American corporations have for IIT,? said Deepak Khazanchi, faculty member, UNO.

 Conagra, another Fortune 500 company, did the same by making the same presentation to the B-school students that they use for their investors. InfoUSA (Gupta?s company) was another stop for the team.

 ?This was an opportunity for the school to fuel its growth,? said dean Probir Gupta.

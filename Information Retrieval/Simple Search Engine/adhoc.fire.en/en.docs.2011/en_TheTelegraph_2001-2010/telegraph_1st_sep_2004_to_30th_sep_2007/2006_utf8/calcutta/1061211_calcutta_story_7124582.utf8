 A few good men: Even as 

 Lage Raho Munnabhai celebrates its 100 days at 

 the theatres, the countdown for the other Vinod Chopra

 India, Eklavya stars Amitabh Bachchan, Sanjay

 After the buzz around India sending Rang De Basanti to the Oscars and Lage Raho Munnabhai entered into the competition directly, now comes the real encouraging news. On Friday, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences released a list of 56 songs eligible for the original song category for the 79th Academy Awards next year and three of them are A. R. Rahman compositions.

 Waters Chan chan (Sukhvinder Singh and Sadhna Sargam) and Rang De Basantis Khalbali (Rahman and Aslam) and Luka chhupi (Lata Mangeshkar and Rahman) are among the 56 songs up for the original song Oscar. Other biggies include The book I write from Stranger Than Fiction and You know my name from Casino Royale.

 On January 16, the Academy will screen clips featuring each of the 56 songs, in random order, for voting members of the music branch in Beverly Hills and New York City. Following the screenings, members will vote to determine which three, four or five songs become nominees in the category.

 To be eligible, a song must consist of words and music, both of which are original, and written specifically for the film. A clearly audible, intelligible, substantive rendition of both lyric and melody must be used in the body of the film or as the first music cue in the end credits.

 The final nominations for the Oscars will be announced on January 23.

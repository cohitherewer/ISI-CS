The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Centre code for bars and restaurants

 A STAFF REPORTER

 An approval from the Union tourism department will soon be mandatory to set up and operate bars and restaurants with a seating capacity of 30 or more. The owners will also have to abide by the norms to be introduced soon by the department.

 Neither the state tourism department nor the Centre currently has any control over bars and restaurants.

 The Centre has constituted a panel, comprising officials of the Union and state tourism departments, travel agents, tour operators, representatives of Institute of Catering Technology and Applied Nutrition and bar and restaurant owners, to oversee the functioning of hotels, bars and restaurants.

 The committee will be empowered to take action if any irregularity is detected in the functioning of the establishments.

 ?We had been urging the Union tourism department to introduce rules that force bar and restaurant owners to provide proper service to the customers. We are happy that the Centre has at last paid heed to our requests,? said Federation of Hotel and Restaurant Association of India vice-president S.K. Khullar. 

 According to him, the liberal policy of the state government in regard to issuing licences has made it easy to open bars and restaurants. The excise department grants the licence against payment of a fee. The mandatory ?no-objection? certificate from police is also easily available, Khullar stated.

 The licence renewal process is simple. The excise department renews bar licences without ascertaining how they are functioning. 

 The system of obtaining approval from the Union tourism department currently applies only to hotels. A central committee oversees the functioning of only the star hotels. 

 ?A few years ago, it was mandatory to obtain the Centre?s nod to operate even small restaurants, but the system was changed for unknown reasons. As a result, there is no body to oversee the functioning of bars and restaurants that have mushroomed all over Calcutta,? added Khullar.

 President of Hotel and Restaurants Association of Eastern India (HRAEI) S.S. Kothari said the organisation had urged the excise department to make changes in the bar licence renewal policy.

 ?Over 100 bars and restaurants have been opened in the city in the past year and more are set to open. There should be some way to ensure that these establishment do not violate rules,? asserted Kothari.

 The HRAEI, along with the Union tourism department, has set standards for the kitchen, toilet, furniture, washing system, waste disposal system and food quality for any bar or restaurant.

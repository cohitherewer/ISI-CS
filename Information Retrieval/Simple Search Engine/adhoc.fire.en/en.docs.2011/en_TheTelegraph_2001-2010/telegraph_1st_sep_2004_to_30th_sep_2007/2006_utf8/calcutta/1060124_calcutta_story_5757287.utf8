 - PARA-VETERINARY COURSE IMPARTED TO 10 RURAL YOUTH

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Handling of injured animals, identification of wounds and cuts, vaccination, administration of medicines and injections to animals, understanding animals through gestures, post-operative care?

 A para-veterinary course imparted to youngsters at a city veterinary hospital promises to augment village health development and address unemployment among rural youth. ?The Debagram Gram Unnayan Kendra (Nadia) had requested us to groom 10 Muslim youngsters through our three-month in-house training course,? says Debasis Chakrabarti, managing trustee, People for Animals (PFA) Calcutta, the animal welfare NGO, which conducted the programme.

 The valediction ceremony for the course was held last Sunday at Ashari (Animal Shelter-cum-Hospital-And-Research Institute) at Mukundapur, off the EM Bypass, attended by sheriff Amal Chakraborty and Left Front chairman Biman Basu, also secretary, Vidyasagar Foundation for Education, Research, Development amp; Social Service.

 Two such courses were earlier held at Ashari. In 2001, 20 boys of other backward classes (OBCs), and in 2003, five Lodha Sabar boys got certificates from respective ministers after successful completion of training.

 The young men with elementary education up to Class IX were trained in basic care of animals. These included diagnosing and treating common diseases, applying first-aid, understanding the importance of avoiding zoonotic diseases, rainwater harvesting, use of bio-fertilisers, maintenance of water bodies, herbal plants, Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act and wildlife protection laws.

 ?We are in a flood-prone zone, with 55 per cent minorities and 25 per cent OBCs often living in abject poverty. Animal husbandry, including poultry and dairy-rearing, can help uplift their socio-economic condition with proper assistance from the government and other NGOs,? according to S.M. Fazlur Rahaman of the Debagram Gram Unnayan Kendra.

 Every candidate is given literature in vernacular as well as a kit to enable them to start work as soon as the course is complete. 

 ?One earning member per family makes an unbelievable difference in the lives of the poor villagers and the livestock, which is so important to their health and economy,? observes Chakrabarti.

 The 90-day programme had experts as guest lecturers, like Dhrubajyoti Ghosh, former chief environment officer, West Bengal government, Anadi Nath Chattopadhyay, assistant wildlife warden and scientist A. Banerjee.

 ?The youngsters are now equipped to recognise and treat minor ailments. Proper treatment of cattle adds to milk and work yield, and saves ignorant villagers from various zoonotic diseases,? stresses Chakrabarti.

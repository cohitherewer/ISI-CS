 Eating sweets has never been healthier. Hindusthan Sweets of Jadavpur has obtained a patent for milk-based herbal sweets that try to combine great taste with good health.

 The patent has boosted the companys prospects on foreign shores. It is exporting herbal savouries to a number of countries, including Iraq and Japan.

 The company started out with conventional sweets. The first outlet was opened in Jadavpur in 1950. Five more outlets in the city followed. The research on herbal sweets started in August 2002. A year later, the herbal products were available in the market. The Centre granted the patent this August. 

 We are proud of the patent as it is the first of its kind in the history of the Indian sweet industry, stated Rabindra Kumar Paul, managing partner, Hindusthan Sweets. 

 Some of the patented items are carrot rasogolla and carrot sandesh, rich in vitamin A; soya rasogolla, full of protein; beet rasogolla, with digestive properties; spandan sandesh, made of arjun tree bark that boosts the heart and increases vitality; smrity or brahmi sandesh, which improves memory and soothes the nervous system, kulekhara sandesh, an anti-anaemia agent, and tulsi doi and tulsi sandesh, which are good for cough and cold, pox, measles and nasal bleeding, said a company spokesman. 

 According to Paul, herbal sweets were his brainchild, though Jadavpur University and Indian Institute of Chemical Biology provided technical knowhow. The company has recently entered an agreement with IIT, Kharagpur. 

 Most of our items are popular. Especially the Sound Sleep Sandesh, made of sushni, an Indian herb. It promotes sound sleep. We are the first sweet-manufacturing unit to have a quality control laboratory, claimed Paul. 

 The sweets, both herbal and conventional, are currently being exported to Iraq, Japan and some other countries. Our rasogolla is very popular in Iraq. Very soon, our products will be available in London, Indonesia and Singapore. We are trying to produce herbal snacks using mango, wood apple and curry leaves, he added.

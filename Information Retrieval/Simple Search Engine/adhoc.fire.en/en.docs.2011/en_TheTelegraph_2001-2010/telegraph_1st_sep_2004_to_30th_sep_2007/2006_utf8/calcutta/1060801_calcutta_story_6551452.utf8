 Neglect cry over boy death 

 - Kin demonstrate at hospital superintendent?s office

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Relatives of a seven-year-old boy held a demonstration at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital on Monday morning following his death, allegedly due to medical negligence.

 Palash Das, a resident of Nabapalli, in Barasat, was admitted to a local hospital on Sunday morning. After his condition deteriorated, he was referred to RG Kar, where he was admitted to the paediatric ward around 8.30 pm. He died at 3.30 am on Monday.

 ?Palash?s condition was serious when he was admitted here. He had some serious urinary and neurological ailments,? said superintendent of RG Kar Krishnangshu Ray.

 Palash?s mother Manika, who was allowed to stay in the ward, alleged that no doctor or nurse attended to the boy between 8.30 pm and midnight, though he lay writhing in pain. 

 ?On Sunday morning, he was taken ill. He could not eat anything and was vomiting. He was also not able to move his hands and legs, and complained of stiffness in the neck. So my husband and some relatives took him to hospital,? recounted Manika. 

 ?At RG Kar, as Palash?s condition kept worsening. I repeatedly pleaded with the on-duty nurses and doctors to do something, but in vain. My son was crying in pain and frothing at the mouth,? Manika continued.

 ?Around midnight, a doctor attended to my son and told me that he was all right and could be discharged from hospital as he was out of danger. They didn?t give him a single dose of medicine,? the mother added. Manika also alleged that Palash?s father Swapan was not allowed to enter the ward. After the boy died, the kin staged a demonstration outside the room of the hospital superintendent.

 ?This is an unfortunate and uncomfortable incident for all of us. I have set up an inquiry committee comprising our experts. If we find that dereliction of duty by someone had led to the death of the boy, we will take adequate action against him,? hospital superintendent Ray promised.

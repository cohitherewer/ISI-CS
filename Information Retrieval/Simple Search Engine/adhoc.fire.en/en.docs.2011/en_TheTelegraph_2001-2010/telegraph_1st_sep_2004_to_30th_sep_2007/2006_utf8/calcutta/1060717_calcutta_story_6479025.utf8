Life

 Haute for the 

 home

 Comfy couches, Zen accents, 

 bath beauties... up the glam quotient of your interiors with 

 the latest on the decor block. Shradha Agarwal 

 tracks the trend

 Lazy boy chair

 l Friends fans will know 

 just how many feelings of bliss a lazy boy chair can evoke. 

 The rest can hop across to a high-end lifestyle store for 

 a first-hand feel.

 The ultimate relaxing recliner 

 for the cosy den or even the bedroom, these chairs are available 

 in six models, physique specific. 

 Curl up while watching television 

 or hook up with your heart-throb (they dont come in 

 18 pleasure angles without a reason, you see).

 Numerous colour options in Italian 

 leather or even fabric can help you make the right choice 

 for your home.

 Check out the collection at Stanley 

 Boutique on EM Bypass, priced between Rs 21,000 and Rs 65,000.

 PS: Take a good hard look 

 at the F1 lazy boy series. A must for sports buffs.

 Shaggy rug 

 Soft, warm, furry and cosy, the 

 hottest floor accessory today is a shaggy rug. Used as a 

 bed throw or wrapped casually over the couch, these rugs 

 take luxury to an all-new level.

 Great in natural colours like 

 browns, off-whites, blacks and tans, sometimes a rug that 

 is scarlet or turquoise can also be effective in a quirky 

 way. 

 Match it with the drapes and cushions 

 or dont match it at all ? a shaggy rug will make a 

 statement anyway.

 Check out the imports from Australia 

 at Gianis. 

 PS: Keep pets away, to 

 keep unnecessary confusion at bay.

 Wooden floor

 Wooden floorings have been around 

 for a while, but the now flooring to possess is nothing 

 short of hardwood.

 Very different in look, feel and 

 application from the laminated kind or the engineered wood 

 variety, this hardwood flooring is huge this season. The 

 exotic flooring comes in oak, Burma teak and Merbau oak, 

 among others. 

 This is long-lasting and because 

 it needs no nailing, it can be done within a day.

 Go over to Stellar, Times or Gianis 

 and take your pick. Prices average Rs 350 per sq ft. 

 PS: Polish it yearly or 

 once in two years, depending on the usage.

 Spa elements 

 Aroma infusion, candles floating 

 on urns, fresh flowers or the serene non-clutter look ? 

 spa settings have inspired a whole new L-zone.

 Taking the concept of heavenly 

 abode a step further, spa elements ? very Zen in nature 

 ? boast de-stressing properties.

 Buy natural-accent pieces like 

 clay, wood, cane or fibre. Pick up the seasons perkiest 

 flowers and place them in simple jars. Or shred the petals 

 to sprinkle on an urn. Experiment with some essential oils 

 till you find your soul scent. 

 Raid the racks in A square 

 home at 85 Lansdowne, Hugli and Cocoon.

 PS: Opt for diffused soft 

 lighting sources. 

 Snazzy shower 

 Steam, jazzy shower cubicle, jacuzzi, 

 rain showers, body jets? And now, the latest to join the 

 list of bath bests is a range of water tiles. Launched in 

 the US last year, this Kohler product is now available in 

 India. These water tiles work as a series of showers and 

 are placed instead of a single shower panel.

 A sophisticated version of rain 

 showers, you can design your own style on the wall or ceiling. 

 Each costs Rs 8,500 and is available 

 at Designer Home on Elgin Road.

 Another trend today is the tile 

 in a rustic finish. Grey, blacks, cream, these stone-like 

 tiles look contemporary and very Italian. Available at all 

 leading sanitary stores. 

 PS: Add life to your bathroom 

 by displaying vibrant towels and bathroom sets.

 Designs on your space

 ANUMITA GHOSH

 An institute with the sole aim of consolidating, contributing, highlighting and improving the profession of interior designing. Thats what the Institute of Indian Interior Designers (IIID), set up way back in 1972, stands for. After a successful run in 14 cities including Bangalore, Hyderabad, Mumbai, Chennai and Delhi, the institute launched its Calcutta centre on Saturday.

 Under the chairmanship of Dulal Mukherjee, the Calcutta regional centre of IIID was informally launched in June last year. Saturday witnessed the formal installation of this 33-year-old body at the Hyatt Regency banquet hall.

 It is an institution that aspires to promote the best in the field. It is essentially a platform where practitioners in this profession can share their ideas and knowledge, said centre chairman Dulal Mukherjee.

 We believe in following a system, but we dont believe in being a victim of the system. So there is a kind of flexibility in all our chapters and centres and Calcutta will be no different, said IIID president Srikant Nivasarkar. 

 The inauguration included an interesting audio-visual presentation by guest speaker Prem Chandravarkar on Interiors. Images. Communication? Prof K.T. Ravindran put forward his views on designing of the interior space and the way it can modify lifestyle.

 The institute has formulated an educational curriculum that will be implemented in some leading universities in the next academic year. 

 In Calcutta, plans are on to tie up with Jadavpur University and BE College, Shibpur. A faculty training session will be held in Pune, from March 8 to 10.

 so on the cards for Calcutta is an institute offering degree courses in interior designing. The idea is to help students get a better insight into the intricacies of this field and specialise in any aspect they want to, pointed out Mukherjee.

 If education is an objective, other areas of concern include establishing sound trade practices and ethics among members. Other activities include the IIID MK Awards, a competition held at the national level annually to acknowledge excellence in the field and exhibitions that showcase the latest products and trends.

 The Calcutta centre comprises around 40 members, while nationally IIID has more than 3,000. Headquartered in Mumbai, it has 11 chapters and four centres.

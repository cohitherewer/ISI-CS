 One presented super-sexy glamour dolls, the other returned to dolls that make up childhood memories. One was about colours, colours and more colours, the other soothed the eyes with a pure palette made up of whites and porcelain blue.

 The opening afternoon of the Wills Lifestyle India Fashion Week at The Grand in New Delhi on Wednesday was one of stark contrasts.

 Day I of the first Indian spring-summer fashion week got off to a colourful start with design biggie Manish Arora kicking off the six-day extravaganza. First day first show by Manish unveiled the Delhi-based designers spring-summer 2007 line that will later be showcased at London Fashion Week in mid-September.

 Titled Life is Beautiful, the collection drew inspiration from nature animals, birds, fish, flowers, rivers, waterfalls, pearls, waves, oceans, trees, sky. The mood was set with paper birds hanging from the ceiling and a few feathered friends dotting the ramp. The models sported bird motifs as headgear and badges.

 The glamour line comprised silhouettes ranging from knee-length dresses, cigarette pants, balloon skirts, minis, knee-length pants, full dresses, tees, tops and capes. Silks, chiffons, brocade, jacquard, cotton-silk knits, nets and organza shaped the line. Digital prints, weaves, patchwork, applique and various forms of embroidery embellished the clothes.

 The collection has a little bit of everything; I have combined a wide variety of embroidery, techniques as well as prints. Its a very international line and is targeted at a global audience, explained Manish. The look was loud and elaborate, every stitch screaming out Manishs signature.

 Contrast with a capital C was played out next, as Cue by Rohit Gandhi and Rahul Khanna showcased a line in pure whites, off-whites and porcelain blue. Named Innocence Regained, the line drew influences from the happy, carefree days of childhood, when all was good and everyone was kind. The primary inspiration for the duo: Dutch dolls and Dutch porcelain.

 The pristine collection was splashed against a carefully thought out backdrop in complete white. Porcelain tea pots and vases were showcased in niches forming the backdrop, while props like corner tables, tools, chairs, tea tables with tea sets, a mirror frame, a bench and a bicycle were placed all around. The models walked to childhood music Raindrops and roses with clean faces and hair tied tightly back. The neat look complemented the clothes.

 Shirtdresses, flouncy skirts, balloon skirts, blouson sleeves and child-like frocks made up the silhouettes. While the cuts were simple and structured, the emphasis was on detailing like highlighted hemlines with cross-stitch, crochet, pin tucks, applique, chiffon braids and ribbons. We believe a designer should keep on evolving every season. And hence, this season, we have totally moved away from bling, Swarovski and glitter that had marked our fall-winter line, said the duo.

 As for affairs off the ramp, the front rows went without any glam guests till afternoon. Without any shred of star presence in the crowd, a lady sporting an unusual headgear created quite a stir among shutterbugs early in the day. 

 The lady accompanying Tarun Tahiliani adorned the first row during the Manish show, flaunting an elaborate headgear made of feathers, quite in sync with the theme of the show.

Tollywood actress Sayantani Ghosh made a special appearance on the ramp. Light green, shades of blue, orange, ochre, off-white and pink made up the colour palette. Embellished with traditional designs like teen phulia, ghungroo, chatai, kangoora and singhuali, the collection stands out for the detailing on the borders and pallus.

 The fair also showcases bedspreads and dress material, with a special discount offer.

 nPocket pinch: The saris start at around Rs 1,080.

 nVoiceover: ?Every year we come up with this festival, but this is the first time it kicked off with a fashion show at the Plaza. The idea is to reach out to the customers and let them know about the new inclusions,? says Mrignayani manager T.N. Basu.

 The exposition will include a fashion show displaying the rich fabrics of the region and information on tourism and business opportunities in the region. A video titled 5 Days In Paradise will give an insight into places like Guwahati, Kaziranga, Bhalukpong, Shillong and Cherapunji.

 nVoiceover: ?The Northeast has a lot of potential and the exposition is a platform where we can portray all aspects of this region. It is an effort to make everyone aware of the exotic destinations with ready infrastructure, especially for budget travellers.

 Wetlands plan rejected

 - State lets deadline to revise vague proposal lapse

 JAYANTA BASU

 The Centre has rejected the Rs 500-crore East Calcutta Wetlands Management Action Plan proposed by the state, calling it vague, and asked for a revised one within 90 days.

 The deadline has long passed, but the plan, to be funded fully by the Centre, is yet to be ready.

 The Centre is now asking for a plan that is pragmatic and easy to execute. I visited the wetlands a few days ago and asked the state to send a realistic, pragmatic and executable management action plan, said Siddharth Kaul, director of the Union ministry of environment and forest.

 Kaul had written twice to the state, asking for a complete revision of the plan, in tune with the guideline laid down by an expert group of the Union ministry (MoEF).

 The proposal was found to be very vague and requires complete revision as per MoEF guidelines Proposal not approved in the present shape, reads Kauls second letter on April 5, addressed to then environment secretary Asim Barman.

 Being a very sensitive area and a Ramsar site, it is all the more important to make a comprehensive M.A.P. (management action plan), stated the letter, which had a guideline of the Union ministry enclosed.

 The letter reminded the government that an earlier communique on the issue in February had gone unanswered.

 The state government took around four months to forward the second letter, which had set the three-month deadline, to Institute of Environmental Studies and Wetlands Management (IESWM), the nodal authority in charge of preparing the draft plan.

 A lot of pressure from our end had gone into activating the state, said a source in the Union ministry, who added that a proposal for immediate requirement is likely to be sent shortly.

 The rejected plan included a wetlands interpretation centre, a bird sanctuary, a watch tower, a wetlands museum, a botanical garden and ecotourism in the area.

 Anybody can make a plan, but our budget for wetlands conservation for the entire country is only around Rs 90 crore, said Kaul. The state has to plan afresh.

 Nitai Kundu of IESWM, however, said the state is going ahead with more or less a similar plan.

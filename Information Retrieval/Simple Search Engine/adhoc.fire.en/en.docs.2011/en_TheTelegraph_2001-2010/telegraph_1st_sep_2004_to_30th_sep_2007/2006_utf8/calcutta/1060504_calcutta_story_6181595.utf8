 Job jamboree after degree

 It was a riot of rhythm 

 and colours at a World Dance Day programme at Rabindra 

 Sadan on April 29. The event was organised by West Bengal 

 Dance Group Federation, World Dance Alliance Asia Pacific 

 Chapter, Rajya Sangeet Academy and Eastern Zonal Cultural 

 Centre. The evening?s performances included items choreographed 

 by representatives from Taiwan and Malaysia. In the 

 morning, there was a symposium on contemporary dance 

 and a film show. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya 

 Finance and business degrees are 

 top on the course list these days, so job security is becoming 

 an ever-increasing concern. One institution has set up a 

 scheme that it claims will guarantee a job at the end of 

 the course. The Institute of Computer Accountants (ICA) 

 has contractually given all its students the Any Time Job 

 Card. 

 When the card is produced at any of ICA?s 200 centres across the country, the owner is entitled to a job in that city, with a minimum salary of Rs 4,000 per month.

 If this sounds too good to be true, the company insisted that not only are they pioneering the job entitlement scheme, but that students are given a practice computer to take home after an initial Rs 5,000 fee.

 In addition, a loan from the State Bank Of India is available to those students who struggle to make ends meet, with the loan being repayable over three years. What?s more, the loan is interest-free, so the impoverished graduate employee has less to worry about.

 ?We believe that at the moment there is not a lack of jobs, but a lack of quality manpower, and we want to encourage good students to come to ICA. Most of our students are middle-class and lower middle-class, which means that sometimes families may struggle with the fees. The State Bank of India loan is there to help them. We are totally unique with the job guarantee scheme, which is a genuine first in the country,? said an ICA spokesperson.

 The Calcutta branch of ICA has been chosen to pioneer a new course that is designed to effectively teach the mechanics of shares and the stock market. An ICA spokesperson also confirmed that ?there is a lot of untapped talent in Bengal, and by initiating the course here first we can encourage interest in this field?. 

 ICA claims that its established courses are evolving very rapidly. In existence for the past seven years, the institute currently has 25,000 students on its rolls across India, with the majority of its graduates going into banking.

 Football fever

 The world is once again gearing up for yet another thrilling FIFA World Cup, to be held in Germany in June this year. Thirty-two teams will fight for the right to be called the world champions of a game that is almost worshipped, a game that has seen so many violent and emotional moments.

 The earliest form of football was a military exercise in China called Tsu Chu, dating back to the 2nd and 3rd centuries BC. Another form of the game was the Japanese Kemari. The Greek Episkyros and the Roman Harpastum were also ancestors of football.

 These games developed into modern-day football. France played Belgium at the first official international match in Brussels on May 1, 1904. The Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) was founded in Paris on May 21, 1904. The first major tournament where football was launched was the 1908 London Olympics with England winning the inaugural meet.

 Jules Rimet became the third president of FIFA on March 1, 1921. Under his leadership, the idea of a World Cup was evolved. The first World Cup was opened at the Centenary Stadium in Montevideo, Uruguay, on July 18, 1930. A new era had begun for the game. At that time, the World Cup was called the Jules Rimet Cup.

 World War II put a temporary stop to it. The fourth event was held in Brazil in 1950. India refused to participate as they were not allowed to play barefoot. India has since fought to qualify for the cup. Since 1930, the 17 World Cups have seen only seven different winners.

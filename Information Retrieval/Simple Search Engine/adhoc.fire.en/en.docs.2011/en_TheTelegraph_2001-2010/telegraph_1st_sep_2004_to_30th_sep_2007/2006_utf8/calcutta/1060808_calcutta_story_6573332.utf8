The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Private guards get set

 IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI

 The serial blasts in Mumbai and Srinagar have prompted Calcutta Police to start training sessions for private security guards deployed at offices, shopping malls and other places. Officers said the guards are being trained how to react during an emergency to save lives and property.

 The training session is part of the measures taken after the recent blasts to boost security in the city, Pradip Kumar Chatterjee, deputy commissioner of police (headquarters), told Metro.

 Officers from 48 police stations across the city have been asked to visit places like offices, shopping malls, hotels and showrooms and train the guards there.

 We have also asked officers from the special branch and intelligence wing to train the guards, Chatterjee added.

 We have asked the guards to intercept anyone found moving about suspiciously. They should be alert and ready to take any step. In case of an emergency, they have been instructed to inform the local police station and the Lalbazar control room immediately, said an officer of Shakespeare Sarani police station.

 Training sessions for the guards in the Park Street, Shakespeare Sarani, Gariahat, Shyambazar and New Market areas have been conducted.

 These areas record the maximum footfall in the city. Most of the malls, showrooms and cinemas are located here. It is not possible for us to deploy policemen everywhere. Therefore, it is important that we train the private guards, a senior officer at Lalbazar said. 

 It is very good move. The cops have briefed us about the dos and donts, said a guard at Forum.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Students ready to up ante

 A STAFF REPORTER

 With support pouring in, medical students and junior doctors on Tuesday decided to intensify their anti-reservation stir. They will beg on the road, organise street plays and bring out a ?massive rally? to make their point. 

 ?We held a general body meeting last night, where it was decided that our members will beg at the Park Circus seven-point intersection on Wednesday. On Thursday, we will take part in a nation-wide medical strike called by Indian Medical Association. The next day, we will perform street plays at important points in the city,? stated Satyajit Das, an intern at the hospital and a member of the Calcutta chapter of Youth for Equality, which is coordinating the anti-quota protests.

 About 5,000 members of the organisation will take part in the rally to be held on Saturday. It will start at Medical College and Hospital and proceed to the Maidan, where a convention has been organised.

 On Thursday, teachers and students of three non-medical educational institutions ? Calcutta University?s department of food and nutrition, Hiralal Majumdar Memorial College for Women and West Bengal University of Animal and Fishery Sciences ? visited Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital, where the agitators are on a relay hunger strike since last Thursday.

 The visitors said they were supporting the protesters as ?the proposed quota will discourage merit and encourage demerit?.

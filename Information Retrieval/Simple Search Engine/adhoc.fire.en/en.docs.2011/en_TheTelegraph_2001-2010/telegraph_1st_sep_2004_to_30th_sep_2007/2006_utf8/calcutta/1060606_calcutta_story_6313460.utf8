 What: 

 Boumashtami celebrations along with Art For Sight. 

 Where: Trincas on Park Street.

 When: Sunday afternoon.

 Take a look: The annual Boumashtami at Trincas, a rejoinder to Jamai Shashti, was more than just a day for daughters-in-law. It was an event that celebrated women and made an effort to give the disadvantaged old a better living.

 Boumashtami, held two days after Jamai Shashti and garnished with an art exhibition, was attended by painters Ballari Mukhopadhyay, Eleena Banik, Shyamasree Basu, Sukti Subhra Pradhan, television personalities Indrani Chakraborty, Chaitali Dasgupta, Madhumanti Maitra, elocutionists Urmimala Basu, Jagannath Basu, models Tanusree, Priyanka Pal and model-turned-painter Piu Sarkar. And a brigade of boumas, mostly in traditional attire.

 A painting by Shipra Bhattacharya, depicting a woman looking at the mirror, was placed at the entrance. The works of 15 women artists from Bengal were displayed as part of Art For Sight.

 From nature to utensils to horses to the creation of the universe ? artists Anita Roy Chowdhury, Sumana Ghosh, Dipti Chakrabarti and Sukti Subhra Pradhan drew inspiration from all walks of life. Part of the sales proceeds from the one-day exhibition will be donated to the NGO Helpage India to contribute to eye surgery for the aged. 

 The event compere was Nilanjana Chakraborty. If Mothers Day, Fathers Day, Valentines Day and even Rose Day can be celebrated, whats the harm in devoting a day to daughters-in-law? asked Nilanjana. The others took off from there. It has nothing to do with feminism. I look at it as an occasion that I can enjoy with friends, smiled painter Eleena Banik. Women today are monetarily, socially and mentally more independent and I see no harm in events like this. I am not married but I am here because I support the gesture, smiled Piu.

 Pratima Bandopadhyay, a homemaker who came all the way from Chandannagore, entertained everyone with her poems on Boumashtami. As band Jotugriho belted out numbers like Tomar aamar e shohor, Dhandhar thekeo jotil tumi and Kare bhalobasho tumi, some guests stepped on to the dance floor.

 Sip n bite: 

 The elaborate buffet spread included Indian and Chinese 

 dishes like Paneer Butter Masala, Aloo Achari, shrimp in 

 coconut curry, Parsley Potatoes and more. 

 Voiceover: This is the third year we are celebrating Boumashtami in Trincas and it always feels great to make the women feel special. This year the art exhibition was a value addition, said Shashi Puri of Trincas.

 Housing estate for seniors to live in and earn

 SHALMOLI KUNDU

 This is a senior citizens? home with difference. 

 Other than providing the basic amenities for living, Asha Kiran, a seniors? home estate, will also offer part-time jobs and business opportunities to the elderly. 

 Spread over six acres near Rajarhat town, Asha Kiran will house apartments for senior citizens. 

 And as per their interests and abilities, the professional placement agency will give them jobs and monetary assistance to start small businesses, which they can operate from their apartments. 

 The project, worth Rs 30 crore, has been undertaken by the PS Group. The estate will be based on models in the western countries and the apartments will be sold only to those above 65 years.

 ?With most of the youngsters going abroad, retired parents require some engagement for themselves. In Asha Kiran, along with housing facilities, we will give them an opportunity to be financially independent,? said Pradip Chopra, director of PS Group. 

 He elaborated: ?We want to build a retirement community, where these people can engage themselves in various sectors like handicrafts, teaching or any other small business and can earn money in return.? 

 Hailing the initiative, Saikat Nashkar, programme manager of HelpAge India, said: ?After 65, people tend to become vulnerable both mentally and physically. They start considering themselves burdens because they lose their economic independence. It is quite essential to engage them in some kind of work. This will keep them in good health. Also, with such projects, they will no longer be dependent on their children?s money or anybody else.?

 In addition to housing facilities, the complex will have gardens, morning walk tracks, community halls, 24-hour ambulance services with emergency equipment, free healthcare services, special services for the handicapped, meditation centres, a multi-purpose gym, shopping mall, library, swimming pools, jacuzzi and a canteen.

 Each apartment will cost around Rs 10 lakh and the monthly expenditure will be around Rs 5,000. The residential zone, as well as the other areas, will be connected with a sophisticated central fire alarm system, which can be operated by anyone, anywhere in the complex. 

 ?While selling the apartments, we will make sure that one who needs the assistance and facilities gets the flat. He or she will be entitled to stay with his or her spouse only. Children or other relatives will not be allowed to live here permanently,? signed off Chopra.

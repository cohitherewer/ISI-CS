The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Pipeline plant to remove iron

 RAJAT MOHAN CHATTERJEE, chief engineer, Calcutta Metropolitan Water and Sanitation Authority, met readers The Telegraph last week to answer their queries. Participants included Sandip Banerjee, Kajal Bose, Biplab Roy, Subhodyuti Datta, Bikram Majumdar, Jayanta Biswas, Debnath Sengupta, Bibhas Chakraborty, Samar Chandra, Lalit Mohan Nahar and Arun Biswas

Lalit Mohan Nahar: There are eight flats in our building. The bulk of our water supply comes from a deep tubewell. The high iron content in the tubewell water is a huge problem. Is there a way out?

 Iron in water does not pose a threat to your health. A mixture of iron and fine granules of sand can, however, choke the pipeline.

 There are two options before you. You can instal an iron elimination plant in your building pipeline. You will have to maintain it by back-washing daily. A unit of 5,000 l capacity costs approximately Rs 50,000. The manufacturer generally offers free maintenance for a year. 

 The other option is to take bulk supply from us at Rs 3 per 1,000 l. We supply filtered surface water of excellent quality. 

Samar Chandra: Why don?t you follow the ozonisation process to treat water instead of chlorination?

 Ozonisation is effective but it has no residual effect. The disinfection is effective for hardly 10 minutes. Chlorination, in contrast, disinfects water for a longer period. It also removes coliform bacteria.

Kajal Bose: Why is the mud that accumulates in rooftop reservoirs sticky? Is it because of the chemicals you use to treat the water?

 Most overhead tanks are not covered properly. Hence, dust particles enter the tank and get deposited as sticky clay. 

 We only use alum and chlorine gas to treat water. No other chemical is used.

Samar Chandra: How can we disinfect our household reservoirs? 

 Cleaning of underground and overhead reservoirs at regular intervals is a must. You can use bleaching powder to chlorinise your household distribution. After cleaning the reservoir, use 3 g of bleaching powder for every 1,000 l of water. Wait half-an-hour before using the water.

Sandip Banerjee: Has your income increased since the imposition of the water tax by the state government? Are the water bills paid regularly?

 The Calcutta Metropolitan Water and Sanitation Authority supplies treated surface water to 38 municipalities and three municipal corporations in exchange of money. Besides, we also have some direct beneficiaries.

 We are supposed to get about Rs 52 crore a year from the municipalities and the municipal corporations. We hardly get Rs 1 crore a year from them. The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) tops the list of defaulters. 

Samar Chandra: Do the waterbodies have any relation with the underground water table?

 Certainly. Especially in the urban areas, where the roads are metalled, the drains paved and the waterbodies and trees few. Wetlands are the only outlets through which recharging of the underground water table can take place.

Lalit Mohan Nahar: How effective are the domestic water filter units?

 Most of these units purify water using ultraviolet radiation, which can kill some bacteria. These units are useless against virus and arsenic contamination.

Biplab Roy: How much water is wasted through the stand pipes and what does it cost the tax-payers?

 A stand pipe supplies about 2,500 l of filtered water per day and about half the amount is wasted from each stand pipe daily. There are 16,000 stand pipes in the CMC area and we operate about 4,500 stand pipes. The daily total wastage of filtered water is about 6 million gallons, which cost about Rs 1 lakh. It would cost about Rs 12 crore to set up a 6-million gallon treatment plant.

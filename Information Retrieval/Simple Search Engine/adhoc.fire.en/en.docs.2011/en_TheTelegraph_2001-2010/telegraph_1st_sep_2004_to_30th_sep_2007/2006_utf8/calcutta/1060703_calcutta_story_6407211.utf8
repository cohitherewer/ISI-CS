 Ban no bar on bird trade

 Trade in rare and exotic birds continues to remain a draw at Rathayatra melas across Bengal, despite a ban on buying and selling of Indian birds, except a few, such as rock pigeons and crows.

 Those violating the ban face punishment but that has not deterred them from continuing business in birds in Calcutta and its adjacent areas, said a forest department officer. 

 Over the past week, more than 150 endangered birds were rescued in Calcutta by the department. On June 27, 250 parrots and muniahs were rescued in Asansol as they were being taken to the Rathayatra mela in Ranigunge.

 The department has taken some special steps to prevent trade in birds this year. Patrolling has been intensified in the forests to catch bird trappers and hunters. Vehicles are also being scanned at forest and police checkposts. Trains, especially those from Orissa, Jharkhand, Bihar and north Bengal, are being searched with the help of Government Railway Police and Railway Protection Force to stop trafficking in birds. 

 In addition, raids have been carried out at godowns and markets in Galiff Street, Kidderpore, Garden Reach, Behala, New Market and Jadavpur. 

 The forest department officials have approached market committees and NGOs for support. ?We have joined hands with some organisations to spread the message that trade in endangered birds is punishable,? said deputy chief wildlife warden V.K. Yadav..

 Apart from Indian species, birds listed as ?extremely endangered? in Brazil and elsewhere are being sold freely here. Though the country is a signatory to the Convention of International Trade in Endangered Flora and Fauna (CITES), there are no safeguards in the Wildlife Protection Act. Hence, there is little that the regional authorities can do if parakeets, lovebirds and cockatoos are being sold in the market. 

 ?It is a fact that exotic birds are bred in the city without a licence. We are not authorised to conduct raids, so we have to concentrate only on the checkposts. Laws protecting the CITES agreement are being contemplated,? said regional deputy director of wildlife preservation R.K. Samal.

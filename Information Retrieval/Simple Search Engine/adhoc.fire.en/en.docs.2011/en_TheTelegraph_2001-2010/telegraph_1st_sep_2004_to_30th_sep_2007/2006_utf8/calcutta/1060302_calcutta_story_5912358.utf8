 Suicide by reluctant bride

 A STAFF REPORTER

 What Soma Das could not accept was the prospect of remaining just a housewife. 

 And when the condition was imposed on her, the 26-year-old thought the only way to register her protest was to end her life.

 A graduate in Bengali and daughter of an electrician, Soma was preparing herself to become a teacher. She had resisted several attempts by father Dilip over the past two years to get her married.

 But she failed in the last attempt. Overruling her objections, Dilip fixed her marriage some time in May.

 However, all his dreams, and those of Soma, ended on Tuesday night, when she hanged herself from the ceiling of her Ekbalpore house.

 ?A preliminary investigation has revealed that her marriage was fixed against her will,? said Anuj Sharma, deputy commissioner of police (headquarters).

 Soma was her usual self when she had dinner with her parents on Tuesday.

 The family suspected something was amiss only on Wednesday morning, when Soma failed to come out of her room. 

 ?The door was bolted from inside. Her parents knocked repeatedly, but there was no response,? said deputy commissioner Sharma. ?Her father then broke open the door.?

 On entering the room, he found his daughter hanging from the ceiling. 

 ?One end of her dupatta was tied around her neck and the other to an iron clamp in the ceiling,? said an officer. 

 Neighbours rushed in and took Soma to a healthcare unit, but she was dead by then.

 One of Soma?s friends told police: ?She never wanted to be a simple housewife. Instead of running errands for her in-laws, she dreamt of herself as an independent individual.?

 The officers also came to know that Soma had enrolled herself with a teacher training course in south Calcutta.

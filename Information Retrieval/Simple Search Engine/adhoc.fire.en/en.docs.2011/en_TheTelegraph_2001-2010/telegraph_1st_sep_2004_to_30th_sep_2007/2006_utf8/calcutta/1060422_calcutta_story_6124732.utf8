 A serial fragmentation

 - QUEST FOR MODES OF EXPRESSION

 Many Indian artists trained in the traditional way are still sceptical about using the computer as a tool to express themselves. Nabanita Javed has no such inhibitions, since she is a self-taught. 

 She discovered the potential of Photoshop simply by tinkering with her PC, the same way she learnt to draw and paint through sheer perseverance and the will to learn. ?The computer is one place where I can synthesise painting and drawing and bring out something new,? she says.

 Javed, an exhibition of whose latest work opens at ITC Sonar Bangla on April 25, and continues thereafter at Gallery Katayun, was born in Calcutta but was educated in Kanpur, where she specialised in gynaecology at GSVM medical college. She loved to paint in school but besides doing anatomical drawings while studying medicine, she had no training in art.

 She had no time, either, because after she returned to Calcutta in 1991, she expended all her energy on establishing her practice. She got married in 1993 and this is what made the big difference in her life.

 In 1996, ?I realised that although I was doing quite well, there was a gnawing discontent. My husband insisted that I had to do something creative, and gave me an ultimatum, saying if I lived like a vegetable I would die like a vegetable,? says Javed.

 The couple had decided not have children so that they could pursue their special interests ? astrology, in the case of her husband, which she feels is a ?melting pot of cultures and sciences?. Javed took up art in right earnest on her own in 1995, and her ?main dilemma? was learning to handle various mediums. She started with pastels and used earth colours too, along with acrylics and oils.

 She had heard that Katayun Saklat encouraged upcoming artists. So, in 2000, she met the gallery-owner, who is a stained glass artist herself, who asked her to practice drawing. Later, London-based artist and teacher Amal Ghosh was enthusiastic about her work and suggested that she hold an exhibition. In 2002, Javed mounted two shows of her drawings and paintings. She was finding it difficult to divide time and decided to cut down on hospital attachments.

 In the meantime, she held successful shows in Boston at Gallery Soprafina in 2003 and the next year and sold some works there. Now, she spends at least six hours every day on what she prefers to call ?art work? ? not just paintings but using photography and digital technology as well.

 Javed describes her images that resemble warped neon signs as ?serial fragmentation of an image. I take an image and fragment it. It is during the sequential fragmentation that your participation comes in and you start making a new image.? Javed will not stop at that. Her quest for new modes of expression will continue.

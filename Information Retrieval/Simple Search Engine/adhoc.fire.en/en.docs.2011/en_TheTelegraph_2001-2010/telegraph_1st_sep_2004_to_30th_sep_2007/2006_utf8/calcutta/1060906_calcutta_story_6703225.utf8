 From Herbert to The Hungry Tide. From a Calcutta milieu and a cast of fresh faces to a film for the global market involving biggies from Tolly, Bolly and Hollywood. 

 Screen and stage director Suman Mukhopadhyay has flagged off his second film project Amitav Ghoshs The Hungry Tide to be shot at an estimated cost of Rs 20 crore from November 2008.

 The project, taken up jointly by Trityo Sutra and Xanthus Productions, will seek the support of sponsors and technicians from India and abroad. It will be shot in the Sunderbans, Calcutta, Phnom Penh, Seattle and the directors wish list includes names like Zuleika Robinson of Mira Nairs Namesake, Stephaniew Szostak of Satellite, Rahul Bose, Abhishekh Bachchan, Anupam Kher, Roopa Ganguly, Manisha Koirala, Raima Sen, Sabyasachi Chakraborty and Prosenjit! 

 The value the names of actors carry is important for the project to attract the kind of finance necessary, said the director. I know that if someone like Abhishekh Bachchan is in my team, it will automatically attract a lot of curiosity. In any case, we are not aiming for the local market, which is why it will be multilingual in English, Bengali and Hindi, said Mukhopadhyay 

 Offers to film the novel have been coming to Amitav Ghosh ever since its publication, many from well-known Bollywood directors. But Ghosh didnt give his consent because they seemed to lack commitment and he felt that only a sensibility rooted to Bengal could bring the book to life. 

 It is important for Ghosh that the film be made well, though interfering with the script writing or filming process is not on his mind. 

 The visual richness of the book makes it ideal for the screen, feels Mukhopadhyay. The landscape is a central protagonist, agreed writer Ghosh.

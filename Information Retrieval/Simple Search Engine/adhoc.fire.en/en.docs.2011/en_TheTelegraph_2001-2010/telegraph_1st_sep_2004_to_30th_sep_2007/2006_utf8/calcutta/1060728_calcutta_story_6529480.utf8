 They undoubtedly form a much-neglected 

 segment when it comes to designer wear in the city. So an 

 exclusive line of mens wear from a leading lifestyle 

 store does come as a piece of good news, especially when 

 timed just before the festive season takes off. And when 

 the creators of the line comprise design biggies like Rohit 

 Bal, Krishna Mehta, Narendra Kumar, and Shobna and Vijay 

 Arora, men in Calcutta truly have reason to rejoice.

 Titled Mensline, the collection 

 was launched at the multi-label store Prana at 13/3, Ballygunge 

 Circular Road on Thursday. The line also comprises collections 

 by the likes of Priyanka Thakur, Vandana Bagla, Mayank Modi, 

 Seyam, Rajat Tangri, M amp;N, Natasha, Medhavani Khaitan, 

 99 Grams, Gaurab and Rajvi Mohan. The collection will be 

 exhibited till July 30.

 A lot of men from Calcutta 

 come to my store in Mumbai and buy my creations. I have 

 noticed that Calcutta men shop for designer wear in Delhi 

 and Mumbai. So I think it is a good idea to make more and 

 more designer wear available to them in their own city. 

 With this collection I will be testing waters there and 

 I hope it works well, designer Krishna Mehta told 

 GoodLife from Mumbai.

 Krishnas line boasts evening 

 shirts that can be dressed up or dressed down depending 

 on the occasion. There are solid linen shirts with 

 surface texturing and kurtas with different kinds 

 of embroidery. The look is very classic, not at all 

 trendy, says Krishna Mehta.

 Narendra Kumar presents a line 

 titled Harmony on the ambience created by different kinds 

 of music. The collection is divided into two parts. While 

 one comprises cotton shirts in stripes and fresh colours, 

 the other consists of shirts in prints on dark base in a 

 mix of cotton and satin.

 Rohit Bals collection uses 

 summer fabrics like voile, cotton and linen in various hues, 

 ranging from pastels to earthy tones like beige and browns, 

 with a dash of indigo. The designs are highlighted using 

 printing, quilting and embroidery.

 Mayank Modi presents a vibrant 

 line of printed shirts in linen and cotton with the palette 

 comprising greens, pinks, maroons, white and black.

 The mens wear array in general 

 comprises smart casuals and formals. It mainly uses linens 

 and cottons, keeping the humid Calcutta monsoon in mind. 

 The design mood, however, varies in each line.

 The range starts from Rs 750 and 

 goes up to Rs 5,000.

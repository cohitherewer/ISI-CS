 After Vishal Bharadwaj?s Omkara, 

 Rajkumar Hirani?s sequel to Munnabhai MBBS went for 

 a ?title? poll. When first conceived, producer Vidhu Vinod 

 Chopra had named the Sanjay Dutt-Arshad Warsi-starrer Munnabhai 

 Meets Mahatma Gandhi.

 Then recently when the August release date of the movie was announced, the film became Munnabhai 2nd Innings. And now, after the public voting, it has become Lage Raho Munnabhai.

 Going by the success of Phir Hera Pheri and Krrish, sequels sure are the flavour of this Bollywood season and there?s no reason why Munna and Circuit wouldn?t be able to replay their magic.

 Bole toh...

 Civic code for road dig-up

 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE

 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has started formulating a code for the use of roads and pavements by different development agencies.

 ?We want to bring an end to the indiscriminate digging of roads and pavements. We are preparing a code that all agencies carrying out development work will have to follow,? said mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya.

 The Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority, Calcutta Metropolitan Water and Sanitation Authority, Calcutta Telephones, CESC, cable operators and cellphone service providers are mainly responsible for digging roads and pavements. The civic body, too, lays water supply pipes and sewage lines by excavating roads.

 The CMC has also decided to form a coordination committee, comprising its officials and those of the development agencies, to ensure that the code is followed and to oversee restoration of damaged pathways.

 As per the existing norms, any agency intending to dig a road or pavement needs to inform the CMC. The agency also has to restore the road once its work is completed.

 ?Though some agencies obtain permission from the CMC, they do not bother to repair the roads after their work is done. Some agencies do not even inform the civic body,? the mayor said. 

 ?There are agencies that keep the roads dug up for months. Most have a tendency to carry out the repair work in a lopsided manner. People have to suffer due to this. We will not tolerate this any more,? Bhattacharyya stressed. 

 He will soon convene a meeting with the agencies and service providers to inform them about the CMC?s stand on digging of roads and pavements and the code to be followed.

 The CMC is also set to undertake a thorough repair of the pavements on 18 roads. Interlocking tiles will be used for the work. Civic officials explained that the new system would reduce the time and cost of restoration work, and also make it easier.

 Interlocking tiles have already been laid on the pavements of AJC Bose Road, Chowringhee and Camac Street.

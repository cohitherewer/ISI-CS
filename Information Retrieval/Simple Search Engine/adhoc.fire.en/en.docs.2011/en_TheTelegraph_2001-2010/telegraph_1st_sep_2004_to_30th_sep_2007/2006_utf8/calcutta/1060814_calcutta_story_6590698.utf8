 Crossing the Nile in newspaper boats, with friendly crocodile aunties tugging at the shirt tails. Trying a step or two of the pasodoble with Spanish bullfight music or joining the flamenco tableau. Inventing ones own constellation with luminescent plasticine while learning more about Greek mythology or the Australian Outback

 For little Rahul, Deepshikha and the other children of New Light, a community development and HIV/AIDS awareness programme working with sex workers children and local youth of Kalighat, its around the world in 15 days, on a Spanish armada.

 Spreading a little cheer in their lives is a group of young volunteers from Mundo Cooperante, an NGO in Spain. 

 We have brought with us a programme of imaginary travel for the kids to different countries to give them a taste of other cultures and people, explains Alban Delbino, representative of the Spanish NGO working in tandem with local support group New Light.

 Through workshops involving choreography, music and other activities, the 14 young Spaniards are taking the Kalighat kids on a magical mystery tour, to a new country every day. We are flying them to Egypt, Greece, Kenya, Spain, Peru, Mexico, the US, Australia and Japan. They are even handed out play-passports and given a world map, smiles Javier Pinto Sanz.

 The 27-year-old architect from Aranjaez near Madrid, who has been coming to New Light for three years now, is anchoring the projects creative elements. Its about using your imagination and we give the children a different theme every day, focused on the country they would visit, points out Eva Marcelo, in India for the first time.

 Before embarking on their Calcutta trip, the group raised a tidy sum of 5,595 Euros for the children at a gala in Aranjaez. Mundo Cooperante, which represents New Light in Spain, is also approaching another Spanish catalyst group Meridional Fundocio to help in the Calcutta cause, develop the attention programme to make it grow and become self-sustainable in time.

 They are also helping us out with procuring more computers for the children, setting up a new home for the girls and a hospice for full-blown HIV-positive cases, says Urmi Basu, executive director of the Kalighat NGO. Urmi feels in the current international backdrop of war and violence, this chimerical global trek would teach the children more tolerance and the need to bond better with other cultures.

 Rebeca, an environment educationist, and Amaria, the sole psychologist in the bunch, couldnt agree more. Once you get over the initial shock of chaos, you are immersed in the inherent warmth of the city and you realise how important it is to teach the children to be tolerant and receptive to alien cultures, observes Rebeca.

 The culmination of the country-hop is a pageant at Tapan Theatre on August 17, when the children will be encouraged to improvise their own show. We will divide the kids into groups and each batch can create its own programme on the country they liked most. We will help them with tying up the loose ends, costumes and music and act as props, says Eva.

 To the 32-year-old translator, like her colleagues on this Kalighat cameo, the ready smile on innocent faces will be the most precious memory.

 An impermanent enclosure, where there is every possibility of the collective wishes of visual arts lovers to come true, has been created inside Galerie 88. Here, Mumbai-based, 44-year-old Bose Krishnamachari has erected walls of translucent polycarbonite sheets to house book shelves laden with tomes on the visual arts, and monitors where one can watch cinema, both popular and classic, and documentaries on artists and their practice gathered from all over the world. Knowledge, for you to pick and choose.

 Bose (named after Subhas Chandra) Krishnamachari, here at the opening of this installation last Friday evening, said the archival project is titled LaVA, short for laboratory of visual arts. It has an architectural form. I had some idea of constructing within gallery space. It is not a library but a laboratory where one can browse through my personal collection of books, said the Kerala-born artist, who studied science and was subsequently trained in the visual arts at Kerala Kalapitham and Mumbais JJ School of Arts.

 Stepping into the enclosure, one realises why Krishnamachari is all for interactive form and is against the separation of fine art from the other areas of visual arts. There is more food for knowledge from the different fields, says the artist, who, with his bald head, goatee and embroidered shirt, himself dresses in a striking fashion, nothing unusual in an artist whose interests, going by his taste in books, extends to haute couture.

 This public forum is intimately lit. Three bulbs yellow, red and green burn behind the glass-like wall forming three streaks of light on its glass-like face. The strikingly angular bookshelves are in grey and bright red. The grey is paper which covers many other effects inside the enclosure. There are seats on which one can squat while leafing through a book. 

 I am trying to make available, within my limitations, what I really missed during my student years, says the press handout of Krishnamachari, who had received a Lalit Kala Akademi award for painting, but was rusticated from the Mumbai college because he had spoken out against the restrictive curriculum.

 Krishnamachari had earlier worked on a project titled Amuseum, where he picked up books from streets and burnt them to signify the transience of knowledge. He had also curated an exhibition of works inspired by furniture in which invited artists participated. His family was in the furniture business, besides. LaVa reflects his varied interests. 

 It would be interesting to find out how many visitors grab the books with voyeuristic photographs and how many opt for the hardcore books on architecture, design, culture studies and philosophy. How many would dare to watch the bolder films on DVDs and CDs in full public view? On till November 24.

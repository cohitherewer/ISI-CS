 Connect with 

 creativity

 An ad where the head and the heart 

 are in perfect unison

 Shiloo Chattopadhyay

 This 

 was a workday evening. I had settled into my side of the 

 bed, feet up and a pillow cushioning my back against the 

 hardness of the bedside cabinet. The TV was ritualistically 

 on. I was looking at it without really watching it. This 

 is when a comment from a dear friend flashed through my 

 mind. He pays the price of his friendship with me by suffering 

 through this column every week. In return, the least I could 

 do was to give a lot of credence to what he has to say about 

 Ad Lib.

 He felt that it has been a while 

 since we discussed an advertising campaign in this column. 

 My immediate defence was that perhaps there has been no 

 ad recently that could provoke discussion. The other possibility 

 also lurked in my mind ? maybe I have not been paying attention. 

 I felt guilty and focussed on the TV screen. Some old movie 

 was on. Then came the commercial break and a plethora of 

 ads filled the screen. Being summer months, Pepsi has got 

 the new Priyanka Chopra campaign on air and Coke has got 

 its old faithful Amir Khan to do a pseudo Japanese act. 

 The former did not excite me enough to ponder, and the humour 

 in the latter ad failed to tickle me.

 This is when I saw the HSBC mutual 

 fund ad. It was promoting a systematic investment plan. 

 I guess the first thing that would strike one about this 

 ad was its form. It had an overall black-and-white texture. 

 More importantly, it was not a video but an animated sketch. 

 Together they broke clutter. It seemed like the lady in 

 white at a beach carnival, standing back a few steps from 

 the festivities when everyone else was screaming for attention 

 in their coloured beach clothing.

 That however was my first impression. 

 On repeat viewing, I recognised the master craftsmanship. 

 The ad was using small black dots, appearing one after the 

 other, to make a beautiful picture. Each sketch represented 

 a dream: a dream house, a dream holiday? On the other hand, 

 its message was simple: you don?t have to be rich to become 

 richer. If you invest small sums of money every month systematically, 

 you could earn handsome returns from the HSBC Mutual Funds. 

 The monthly investment would be as low as Rs 1,000.

 This HSBC ad signifies a major 

 development. Not too long back, the banking industry was 

 focussed totally on the corporate sector. Individual consumers 

 were then considered unavoidable irritants. All that changed 

 in the last decade or so. Home loans and car loans became 

 popular. Then the mutual funds made their entry. In a way 

 these banking products changed many consumer values. The 

 policies of the government played their part too. Savings 

 was no longer the obsession of the middle class. The era 

 of ladder climbing began. Home loans and car loans were 

 the stepping stone to the ladder. Mutual funds and IPOs 

 were then seen as dependable steps to move up the ladder.

 Banks, however, were somewhat 

 unsure in this new arena. They possibly did not appreciate 

 the huge role that they were playing not only economically 

 but also socially. Unfamiliarity of the consumer territory 

 did not help. The first few steps of the money minders were 

 thus unsure, hesitant and often amateurish. The HSBC ad 

 possibly signals the end of that pre-teen era. It connects 

 to a consumer need ? a better life now rather than 

 later.

 For more reasons than one, this 

 ad belongs to an extraordinary breed. It does not stop at 

 the promise of making money; it translates money into a 

 consumer dream. It aims to connect. Even creatively it excels. 

 The small dots making the dream picture, beautifully depicts 

 the basic concept of small sums every month yielding handsome 

 returns. It is one of those rare instances of the head and 

 the heart of the ad being in perfect unison.

 Marriages they say are made in 

 heaven. Sometimes they happen in a bank.

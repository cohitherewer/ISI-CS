 Cut-off bar rises for varsity berths

 - Trend in tune with changing times

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 In a trend never witnessed before, seats in most postgraduate science courses in Calcutta University have been filled up by students who have scored 60 per cent or above in the undergraduate exams.

 Students who have scored second class marks less than 60 per cent have failed to manage berths.

 For instance, in pure chemistry, the last student admitted has scored 67.8 per cent in the B.Sc Part II exams.

 Last year, the cut-off marks in the subject turned out to be 59.5 per cent.

 In botany, 65 per cent is the lowest score allowed admission, against 58 per cent last year. The scene is the same in subjects like applied physics, psychology, applied mathematics, applied chemistry, molecular biology, zoology and anthropology.

 The trend is encouraging, said Dhrubojyoti Chattopadhyay, dean of the universitys science faculty. For the past few years, we have been telling our students that only those with high marks in graduation should join postgraduate courses.

 According to Chattopadhyay, it is very important for a university to have only high-performers at the postgraduate level. This will help the institution excel in research and also to compete with other centres of excellence in the country and abroad.

 Unlike in previous years, students who have failed to get a berth have not expressed grievance or approached the authorities with demands for increasing the number of seats. This suggests that students denied admission have understood our policy, Chattopadhyay said.

 Records indicate that the demand for berths in subjects like zoology, anthropology and applied mathematics had been rising for the past five years and many first-class graduates could not be accommodated at the postgraduate level because of scarcity of seats.

 Souvik Chatterjee, a leader of the universitys students union and assistant secretary, Calcutta University Research Scholars Association, admitted that there had no demand among students for increasing the number of seats this time.

 There is no need for raising the demand, as a good number of undergraduate colleges are running postgraduate courses. Students with second-class marks can join postgraduate courses in such colleges, he added.

 A section of officials said most students have scored high marks this year because of the liberal evaluation system.

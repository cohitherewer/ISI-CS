 You share your birthday with...

 Suniel Shetty

 Youre friendly, pleasant and popular. You have good ideas, along with great persuasion skills. The wild streak in you makes you unpredictable. People generally are not aware of your true feelings. You are very particular about keeping your private and public lives separate. Kusum Bhandari

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Just a matter of choice

 Supermarkets may not only change the way we shop but also alter the face of Indian marketing

 We were early for our movie. She said, let?s stop for a while, I need to pick up a few grocery items. She disappeared inside a building that hardly looked like a grocer?s shop. I was confused. My wait in the car was very short. She came back with an attendant from the shop in tow. The huge plastic bags were put in the boot of the car and off we went to see the movie with hardly a bead of sweat on her brow. I realised the retail revolution?s here.

 For many like me, it is a big change. When my mother ran out of red chillies or sugar while cooking she used to send me to the corner shop. They knew me. All I had to mention were the items. The shop assistant knew exactly what grade of red chillies and what grain size of sugar had to be sent with me. If this sounds archaic then I have given away the biggest secret of my life. My age.

 Nostalgia apart, things were different till recently. It still is for many. A grocer was a small shop with too many things to sell. The shop allowed very little space for the shopper to contemplate. The most functional thing to do, and this is what most shoppers did, was to prepare a list in advance of not only the items but their brands as well. People walked into the shop having made up their minds.

 All this is set to change and I am not talking about the top-end malls but of everyday super markets. Thanks to bulk buying, prices in these super markets are often competitive. That removes the shopper?s guilt. We are all culturally tuned to decode a well-done-up shop as expensive. The supermarkets of today are challenging that notion. Air-conditioned comfort and alluring product displays are being offered at no extra cost. So, even the great Indian middle class is rushing through the gates of these latest hot spots. 

 Apart from changing the lives of consumers, this might alter the face of Indian marketing significantly. There are 4Ps in the lexicon of marketing: Product, Price, Place and Promotion. These are the weapons a brand uses to send out the message ? I am the best. That is why all four Ps need to culminate in another P: Perception. Each P has elements within. Take the product. In most branded products that we use at home, the physical product comes in two components ? the soap and the wrapper, the detergent and the carton, the shampoo and the bottle. Packaging is an integral part of the brand.

 So far, products like perfumes used to give the most attention to their packaging. Soaps and detergents had less to worry on this count. The grocer seldom allowed them to show their dresses. And after reaching home, the soap wrapper usually took shelter in the bin and the detergent pack hid behind the closed doors of the bathroom cabinet. 

 The supermarkets might disturb their shyness. The packages will be on display on the well-lit shelves. People will take them in their hands, turn them around, smell them, and feel them ? in short, put them through an inspection process that may match matrimonial scrutiny. Impressions will be created. Perceptions will crystallise. Eventually, choices will get influenced.

 Brand marketing will thus need to take a re-look at their arsenal. Their creativity will need to adopt a new platform. It is going to be as crucial as advertising, if not more, because it will be the last line of defence. The air-conditioned offices of Nariman Point and Gurgaon may have some new work to do.

 Water recycle plant 

 - State 

 to monitor project 

 DEBASISH CHATTOPADHYAY

 To increase recycling of water, the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) has taken up a plan to build a sewage treatment plant at Budge Budge town, under Ganga Action Plan II.

 About Rs 2 crore has been sanctioned for the plant by the National River Conservation Directorate (NRCD) of the Union ministry of environment and forests.

 This type of sewage treatment plants exist in Mumbai and Delhi, and the residents there have benefited a lot from the projects. Moreover, the CMDA itself will execute the project. Hence, our men and machinery will be fully utilised, said Pran Bandhu Nag, general secretary of the Development Employees Joint Action Committee. 

 The NRCD has imposed some conditions while sanctioning the funds. One of them is that the state government will have to bear any expenditure over and above the sanctioned amount. The deadline of a year also must be adhered to strictly. 

 The state government has been entrusted with the responsibility of monitoring the project and submitting a progress report to the NRCD on a regular basis. A project monitoring cell will be constituted for the purpose.

 It has been mentioned in the sanction letter that state government should fulfil legal and physical requirements of the project to enable local bodies to augment their resources for operation and maintenance of the assets created under the National Lake Conservation Plan. 

 Chief executive officer of the CMDA P.R. Baviskar said: We are quite confident of finishing the work within the stipulated time. We have floated the tenders and hope to start the project within a short period.

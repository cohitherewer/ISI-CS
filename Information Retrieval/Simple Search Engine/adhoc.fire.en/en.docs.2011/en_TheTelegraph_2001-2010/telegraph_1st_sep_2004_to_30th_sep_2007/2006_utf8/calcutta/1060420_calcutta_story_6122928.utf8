 ?Bollywood chose me?

 Billed as the next big thing, ?supermodel? UPEN PATEL tells Pratim D. Gupta why he is his only competition

You haven?t had a single release but you are being 

hailed as the next big thing in Bollywood?

 I am very humbled and I am also very excited. So many people are approaching me every day and so many great things are happening on their own. It?s like a super dream coming true. You have everyone from Suneel Darshan to Vipul Shah signing me on. I just hope I can live up to all these expectations and take Bollywood by storm.

Don?t you owe it to John Abraham for proving that 

models can act?

 He?s done really well and I will be happy if I can be half as good as him. Saying that, I would also like to say that I have never looked at other people. I am my only competition. Only I can beat myself. Then, you can?t really compare modelling and acting. They are two completely different worlds. People have seen me dance in the promos of 36 China Town and they are already over the moon. The buzz is strong, I am keeping my fingers crossed.

Do you fear your now-famous body overshadowing 

your acting skills?

 My physique cannot overshadow my acting skills. Once you see the film you will understand. I am not body, body throughout the film. Just this one portion where I dance bare-bodied. I play this really innocent guy who meets the wrong people at the wrong time. It was great working with people like Shahid and Kareena. They are my seniors in the industry. But let me tell you I am the USP of 36 China Town since I add a certain freshness to the film.

Do you regret starting off with music videos and 

TV shows like Cook Na Kaho?

 No regrets at all. Are you crazy? People started recognising me because of the videos. Everything that happens, there is a good side to it. People like Subhash Ghai and Abbas-Mustan chose me because they saw me on TV. I did not choose Bollywood; Bollywood chose me. I am not a star son. I am not an industry person. I do not have any godfather out there. Yet I became a supermodel in three years and now I am getting the best banners in movies. I am the ultimate proof that if you have talent, you can make it here. I was that guy on the streets trying to make it big.

But you are still getting to play second fiddle 

to stars like Shahid Kapur and Akshay Kumar?

 I am surprised you say that. Had I been just a second lead you wouldn?t be talking to me. 36 China Town is very much Upen Patel?s launch film. There may be other stars but it is also about me. There are full-length songs picturised on me. And all the other films that I have signed, I have very important roles to play.

What are these big films you have signed?

 After 36 China Town, there?s Vipul Shah?s Namaste London with Akshay Kumar. Then there?s a Suneel Darshan movie from July. I have signed Shoojit Sircar?s Jungle, to be produced by Percept. There?s a movie with Raj Kanwar. Then I am doing Abbas-Mustan?s next, to be produced by Ashtavinayak Films. And there?s also a film with Ajay Devgan to be produced by Kumar Mangat.

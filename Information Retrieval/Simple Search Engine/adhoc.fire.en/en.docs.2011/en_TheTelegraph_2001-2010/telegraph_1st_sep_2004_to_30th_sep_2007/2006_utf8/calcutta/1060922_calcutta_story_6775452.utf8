 Speaking pictures

 Dominated by an impulse to articulate beyond the restrictive realm of verbal language, artists seek to communicate a range of ideas and emotions that are generally considered to be outside the purview of other modes of aesthetic expression. Showcasing a fine blend of imagination and reality, The Realms of Expression, the ongoing exhibition of paintings by well-known contemporary artists, marks the success of such creative attempts. Based on diverse themes that offer keen insight into the mindset of the artist, the collection on show is both visually appealing and thought provoking. Reflecting a vibrant devotion to colour and lyrical artistry, most of them seem to speak to the viewer through the use of familiar symbols and graphic metaphors. Participating artists include Gourango Bishai, Kartick Chandra Pyne, Prokash Karmakar (a painting by him appears above), Ramananda Bandyopadhyay, Suhas Roy, Sanatan Dinda, Bratin Khan, Subroto Gangopadhyay and Swapan Das.

 Vibrant lines, fragile paper

 - Travelling exhibition affords glimpses into works of masters

 SOUMITRA DAS

 Arpita Singh?s Untitled, on display

 This is a small show of tiny works on paper by some major contemporary artists. It is a travelling exhibition and will stop over here at Gallery Katayun from May 17 to 31. It is certainly not a representative show, but it affords glimpses of the works of many of our favourite artists. 

 Most of the works are on paper, so notwithstanding their quality, they are not much sought by collectors. Paper is too fragile.

 Now, to the works themselves. Most of the better-known artists are veterans, the only exception being Rajeev Lochan, who has worked on a photographic print. 

 There is an impromptu (spontaneity acquired after years of practice) drawing of a woman?s head in profile by Kattingeri Krishna Hebbar, who was known for his mastery of the line and whose work is not much seen here. 

 K.G. Subramanyan?s lithograph is all grey and black lines, and like much of this artist?s work, shot through with dark humour.

 Portraits and sketches of nudes by Akbar Padamsee have been in the news. Here are two executed with charcoal, the jagged lines quivering with nervous energy. 

 Ganesh Haloi?s black-and-white watercolour seems to rise to a crescendo, sending shock waves all around.

 An austere-looking profile is given shape through lines almost as fine and strong as a cobweb. This is Lalu Prasad Shaw?s contribution. 

 Rabin Mandal?s portrait surprisingly resembles the stucco bearded heads often used to embellish old buildings. Prakash Karmakar?s nudes are loud and large as life. 

 Laxma Goud?s intaglio print lacks the virility of some of his more sexually-explicit work.

 There are few living artists who can wield the brush with as much finesse as M.F. Husain. Here is another proof of his mastery, although one has to admit that his earlier nudes looked more vibrant and energetic.

 The only woman artist on display is Arpita Singh. She has two tiny paper works to her credit. These are spare but powerful. A woman cringes, perhaps apprehending an invasion on her private space. Another sleeping figure floats in mid-air, her pillow an extension of a body part. 

 Mostly undistinguished works of lesser-known artists are also included.

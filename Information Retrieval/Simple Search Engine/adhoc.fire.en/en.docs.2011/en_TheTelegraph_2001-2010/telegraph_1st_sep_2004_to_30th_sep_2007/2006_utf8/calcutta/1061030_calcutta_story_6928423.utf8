 Where sandwich makes a meal

 SHRADHA AGARWAL

 A 

 Thought For Food

 Interiors of the 

 Subway outlet at New Alipore.

 They made news when they decided 

 to come to town. They made more news when they finally did. 

 And some more when they shut shop for hours supply falling 

 short when amazing demand came knocking. And 

 now, Subway is back in the buzz. 

 A brand new 1,000 sq ft Subway 

 outlet, the largest Calcutta has seen so far, opens its 

 doors on Tuesday. This is Subways third outlet in 

 Calcutta, the other two being at Woodburn Park and Sector 

 V in Salt Lake.

 Housed at 175 G New Alipore, opposite 

 Yoga Care Institute, this Subway, like all others, boasts 

 signature Tuscany design elements.

 The New York skyline pasted on 

 the walls, bricked effect across the sandwich deli counter, 

 brick red, green, and off-white tiles mark the 35-seater 

 eatery. The 15-ft counter will have a cash counter separating 

 the vegetarian and the non-vegetarian sections. 

 A special kids play zone 

 is coming up too. New Alipore is the heart of a residential 

 area and Subway sees great potential there. Its lounge-style 

 too, encouraging people to spend more time here, says 

 Rishi Bajoria, area development manager, eastern India, 

 Subway. 

 Despite sensational sell-outs 

 since day one, Rishi feels one of the biggest challenges 

 Subway has faced is to get bread accepted as a meal.

 He says: We are basically 

 a rice-eating region; getting Calcuttans to eat bread as 

 a whole meal and not as breakfast or a midday snack was 

 initially tough. 

 But Subway soon won the battle 

 and formed a strong community of repeat customers, 

 something Rishi attributes largely to the latest Eat Fresh 

 campaign. Subway claims to be the worlds only 

 fast food that is healthy. 

 Subway uses no oil, no fire 

 and hence no extra calories. Everything is baked, grilled 

 or toasted, adds Rishi. 

 Another highlight is Subways 

 Daily Specials when every day of the week sees a pre-decided 

 sandwich on offer for Rs 50. Sample this: Roasted Chicken 

 Breast on Monday, Paneer Tikka on Tuesday, Chicken Seekh 

 Kebab on Wednesday, Aloo Patty on Thursday, Tuna on Friday, 

 Chicken Tikka on Saturday and Chicken Teriyaki on Sunday.

 This is our strategy to 

 beat any form of meal deal offered by competition. It also 

 encourages people to grab a quick bite at Subway every day, 

 says Rishi. 

 Post-New Alipore, theres 

 a lot more coming up from the Subway camp in January. Roasted 

 Garlic or Hearty Italian will 

 join the existing four-bread army of whole wheat, honey 

 and oat, parmesan oregano and Italian white bread. Two more 

 add-ons to the vegetarian section are also in the pipeline.

 And is the news of McDonalds 

 winter entry into the city cause for concern? Not 

 at all, we view this as a compliment, not competition. Its 

 great for the QSR (Quick Service Restaurant) sector and 

 will bring about more awareness and with that, more eating 

 out, smiles Rishi.

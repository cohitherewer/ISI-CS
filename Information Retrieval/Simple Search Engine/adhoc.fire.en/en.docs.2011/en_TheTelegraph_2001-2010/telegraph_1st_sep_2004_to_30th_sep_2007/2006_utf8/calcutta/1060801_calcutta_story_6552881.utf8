 After his celebrated quiz shows on the small screen ? right from Quiz Time to Kaun Banega Crorepati to Heart Beat ? quizmaster-producer Siddhartha Basu is now moving on from mind games to nimble footwork. His Synergy Communications, along with the Mumbai-based company Theatre Red, will now produce a dance-based reality show for Sony Entertainment Television, touted to be the next big thing after Indian Idol.

 An adaptation of the international BBC format Strictly Come Dancing, the Indian version will go on air from the first week of September. Known as Dancing With The Stars in most countries other than the UK, the show will have celebrities from all walks of life partnering with professional dancers and competing in pairs. 

 ?It is a grand, very glamourous dance show and has been a smash hit internationally,? Basu tells Metro from Mumbai. ?We are in the process of zeroing in on the stars who will then go for a one-month training before taking the stage.?

 Sony is very excited about the show and although it will run for only two months, the channel feels it will be a TRP-topper. ?When it is full of celebrities and dance music, it doesn?t take time for a show to pick up,? says Anupama Mandloi, head of on-air programming for Sony. ?We will be having big names from Bollywood, cricket and even the hotel business taking part on the show. They have never danced publicly before and most of them have two left feet. So, that?s where the fun lies.?

 There will be a jury judging the dancing but equal weightage will be given to the viewers voting in by SMS or phone calls. ?In the international versions, sportsmen like Darren Gough, Evander Holyfield, Michael Jordan and Diego Maradona have been very popular with the viewers despite not being the best of dancers,? reveals Basu. 

 For someone known to make Amitabh Bachchan ask the questions and everyone from Sachin Tendulkar and Shah Rukh Khan guessing the answers, dishing out boogie nights is sure a novel experience. ?I started out doing theatre in Calcutta and dance is something that has always fascinated me,? explains Basu. ?And having specialised in producing studio-based multi-cam formatted shows for quite some time now, I am sure we will be able to give a whole new flavour to the international hit.?

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Terror team in the net

 - CPM councillor, five aides arrested for assault on Sinhas and wrecking home

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Swapan Saha, CPM councillor of ward 14 in the Dum Dum municipality, and five of his aides were arrested late on Tuesday for their assault on the Sinha family.

 ?We have picked up six persons today for ransacking Saraswati Sinha?s house and also beating up her two children. I cannot elaborate on the matter, since the investigation is on,? said superintendent of police (North 24-Parganas) Praveen Kumar.

 The house of Saraswati Sinha in Kalidham had been ransacked on Friday night, and her daughter Runu and son Somnath had been attacked, as Saha and Co. hounded the family to give up a portion of their premises for construction of a club.

 For the past three days, Metro had been highlighting the plight of a family living in fear and forced to flee home, a portion of which had been reduced to rubble by the CPM terror gang a day after the city went to the polls.

 Salil Bhattacharya, officer-in-charge of Dum Dum police station, confirmed late on Wednesday that apart from councillor Saha, five of his associates ? Maya Majumdar, Amal Das, Bapi Das, Dilip Das and Arati Dutta ? have been taken into custody, ?on the basis of specific complaints from the Sinhas?.

 Saraswati, who is still at her sister?s house near the airport with her children, said: ?We are happy the culprits have been brought to book. We want exemplary punishment for Saha and his men, who assaulted my daughter and destroyed my house.?

 CPM insiders said the arrest of Saha and his aides followed a complaint lodged by the Sinhas with state secretariat member Benoy Konar at Alimuddin Street on Monday.

 The matter had also come to the notice of Joydeep Mukherjee, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s confidential assistant, who was then at the party headquarters.

 Saha wields enough clout in the locality, thanks to his proximity with Dum Dum municipality chairman Dipak Bhattacharya. 

 He is also associated with several colony committees in the Dum Dum area and is known to play ?a key role? in colony land transactions.

 Amitava Bose, CPM secretary of North 24 Parganas district, said on Wednesday: ?Let the law take its own course, but we shall conduct our own inquiry. Disciplinary action will be taken against Saha if he is found guilty.?

 State human rights commission chairman Shyamal Sen, meanwhile, said deputy inspector-general of police (Presidency range) Surajit Kar Purakayastha had already started a probe following the commission?s prod on Tuesday.

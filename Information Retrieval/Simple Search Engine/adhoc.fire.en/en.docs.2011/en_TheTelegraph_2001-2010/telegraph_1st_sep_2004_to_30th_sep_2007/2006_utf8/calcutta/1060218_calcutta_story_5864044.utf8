 Poll count on current politics

 The National Service Scheme of St Xavier?s College conducted a survey on campus on burning topics like the debate on privatisation of airports and the issue of India voting against Iran on the International Atomic Energy Agency resolution to report Iran?s nuclear programme to the UN Security Council.

 The endeavour was to ascertain what the students thought about these events. The very first question was whether they were actually aware of these issues, to which 90.18 per cent of those asked responded with a yes. While 50.3 per cent were in favour of privatisation of airports, 27.6 per cent were not too convinced about the idea.

 A majority of the students ? 53.37 per cent ? vehemently opposed the strike by the employees of Airports Authority of India (AAI). They felt strikes were completely unproductive. 

 On India?s diplomatic step of voting against Iran, the survey yielded a mixed set of responses, with 34.9 per cent siding with India, 33.12 per cent against the decision and 31.98 per cent unsure of repercussions of the government?s move. 

 Rounding off the survey on a political note, the students were asked whether the Left was right in supporting the striking employees of AAI and in opposing the Centre?s decision of voting against Iran. A mere 13.5 per cent shared the party?s sympathy for the striking employees, 25 per cent felt opposing India?s vote against Iran was a correct decision. On whether the Left was wrong on both counts, 46.62 per cent of the respondents agreed. Only 14.88 per cent backed the party on both issues. 

 The survey was designed to make the college students more aware of current political situations and to get them to think about various national and international issues. After all it is we, the college students, who will run the nation in the future.

Beyond placements

 Unlike other institutes, Training and Advanced Studies in Management and Communications (TASMAC) doesn?t believe in positioning placements as its USP. ?Our mission is to educate and to train. If placing students is to be the main criterion, then we would rather open up an executive search agency,? said Giri Dua, chairman and managing director, TASMAC. The words were a change in an increasingly commercialised education scenario where dozens of small and big institutes advertise on the strength of their placements.

 ?We don?t believe in promoting our institute with the lure of placements. Management schools are for imparting training to a student and equipping him or her to face the challenges and pressures imposed by today?s corporate world,? Dua emphasised. The business school is a relatively new entrant in the burgeoning education sector of Bengal, but has managed to carve a niche for itself. 

 The Salt Lake institute, which set up its Calcutta campus in July 2005, has recently been appointed as a representative of the validation unit of the University of Wales, for South Asia and the West Asia.

 ?The University of Wales is one of the top-rated educational establishments in the UK. They have shown tremendous faith to be a partner. Financial implications and considerations do not come into the picture at all,? Dua added. Being a representative allows TASMAC to assist the university in identifying new opportunities.

 Dua is extremely upbeat about the education scenario in Calcutta. ?Big brands are coming here without diluting quality,? said the TASMAC honcho. Dua also felt that management education in India has to explore emerging avenues such as retail, hospitality and tourism. Distance learning programmes are also on the anvil.

 TASMAC is the first institute outside Europe and the only institution in India to be accredited and recognised by the British Accreditation Council (BAC) for Independent Further and Higher Education. ?TASMAC has created a platform that allows an Indian student to get a British degree at affordable prices without leaving the shores of this country,? Dua pointed out.

 However, with the autonomy issue being raked up in recent times, Dua felt that the higher education sector has to be opened up. ?Government interference has to be minimised. Market dynamics will play their role in defining quality education and meeting requirements,? he added.

 Golden jubilation

 Students of Behala Sharda Vidyapith for Girls celebrated the school?s golden jubilee from February 3 to 9 in a unique manner. 

 On February 5, the girls gathered in front of their school as early as 7 am. A group of them then performed a mime on the history of the education system in India. It charted its evolution from the gurukul parampara to the contemporary institutions of today. The script was written by the school?s headmistress, Banabani Bhattacharjee.

 Pigeons were set free and balloons released before a procession by the students started from the school. Many guardians chose to join in and even some of the local residents took part in the half-km walk. 

 A team of dhakis and an array of eye-catching tableaux were accompanied by girls riding cycles at the head of the procession, which meandered through Parnashree, Banamali Naskar Road and a portion of Diamond Harbour Road. 

 Those on foot juggled various objects, waved ribbons, pompoms and flags, and also sang songs. The placards carried messages promoting education of the girl child.

 The cultural programmes and seminars held on the other days were also well-received. Both past and present students participated in the events.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 North Wind blows, winter in the wings

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 There is a nip in the air with the North Wind blowing from Monday, but it does not signal winter just yet, the weatherman said on Tuesday. 

 The Met office recorded a minimum temperature of 17 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, a drop of three degrees from Monday. The weather is expected to remain cool for the next 48 hours. According to officials, winter has arrived in north Bengal.

 Over the next two days, the minimum temperature is expected to hover around 16 and 17 degrees Celsius, said G.C. Debnath, director of the weather section at Regional Meteorological Centre in Alipore.

 The North Wind is responsible for the chill at dawn, explained Debnath. Conditions are becoming favourable for a clear passage of the North Wind, he added.

 Clear skies are needed so that the North Wind is not blocked and winter can set in. There should be no kind of low pressure either on land or over sea. The conditions exist now and so the minimum temperature might plummet after a few days, stated an official.

 The minimum temperature of 17 degrees Celsius is par for the course in end-November, but it took Calcuttans by surprise late on Monday as the dip came after the minimum temperature had risen well past the 20 degrees Celsius mark over the past few days.

 Skill in the fine arts has brought together a group of six young people whose works show commitment to the cause of alleviating social ills. Sixth Sense, the ongoing exhibition of their paintings, reflects a clear emphasis on images of social relevance that stir the mind of the viewer. Comprising both illustrative and abstract works, the show presents a riot of stark, brilliant colours capable of evoking strong emotions. Studies in human anatomical equlibrium, the paintings of Amalesh Das betray the sense of loss of direction or motivation in life. The works of Atish Mukherjee convey a genuine concern for the natural environment. Binit Sinha (one of his paintings appears left) and Kajal Chakraborty look towards religious experience as a means of finding deliverance from sin and evil. At times, religious motifs are interspersed with symbols of profanity and amorality, adding irony to interpretation. Loss of innocence is a recurring theme in the paintings of Sekhar Basu, while Susmita Das? works protest against social vices.

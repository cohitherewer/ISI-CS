 Sec. 144 at club after CITU muscle-flex

 SANJAY MANDAL

 The CPM?s trade union wing, CITU, has threatened to stall work at Hindusthan Club, on Sarat Bose Road, after its demand for absorbing a few employees was turned down by the club authorities.

 With some of the club services already stopped, the authorities have written to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee seeking his intervention in the matter.

 In the letter, the club management has alleged that CITU is threatening to stall work, bringing business to standstill. ?Some union leaders, who are speaking on the behalf of workers, have threatened us with a cease-work,? club president J. K. Jain said.

 With the agitating workers camping outside the club, the authorities have lodged a complaint with Ballygunge police station and Section 144 has been imposed on the premises.

 The 60-year-old club, which has some of the leading industrialists on its membership rolls, has about 150 employees directly employed by it. Most of them are members of the BJP?s Hind Mazdoor Sabha. 

 In May 2006, the club had engaged a private agency for recruiting workers. Thirty-five people were taken in and engaged in the room service and cleaning departments. 

 The trouble started when the club authorities were reportedly dissatisfied with their work and asked the recruiting agency to replace five of them.

 But when the agency sought to replace the workers and offered them jobs elsewhere, the workers refused to shift and demanded permanent jobs in the club. The condition worsened when the agency discontinued its services at the club.

 ?We have stopped booking rooms because we don?t have workers. Even the daily cleaning has been affected by this agitation,? a club official said.

 One of the CITU men who met the authorities said: ?Contractors will come and go. That doesn?t mean you can throw us out.? 

 Asked Kali Ghosh, state secretary of Citu: ?When an agency gets a contract, it provides employment. But what will the employees do when the contractor goes away??

 Police said they were keeping a watch. ?We are taking all steps to ensure peace,? said Ajay Kumar, deputy commissioner of police (south).

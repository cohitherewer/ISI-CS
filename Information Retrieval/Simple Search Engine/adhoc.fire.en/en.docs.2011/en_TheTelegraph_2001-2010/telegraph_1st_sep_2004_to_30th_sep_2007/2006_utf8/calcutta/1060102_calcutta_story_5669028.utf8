 ?This year, I am not sending my New Year wishes to you all. Because I?m sending them all to Big Boss to wish him a speedy recovery??

 This is the missive Rajesh Kejriwal?s New Year card, sent to family and friends, carries in print. But Kejriwal does not care if the message upsets the recipient. His world of New Year cards revolves around one man: Amitabh Bachchan.

 ?This is the sixth year that I am producing a card themed on Boss,? grins Kejriwal, in his Chandni Chowk office. And a copy is religiously sent to Jalsa, the Bachchan bastion in Juhu.

 Kejriwal may never receive a thank-you note for the card. But then, far more important than the missive is the fact that he has met the man himself. ?I qualified for Kaun Banega Crorepati?to see Boss,? smiles the 40-year-old copper electrode manufacturer, who has not missed a single episode of KBC to date.

 His reflexes failed him in the fastest finger round and he could not make it to the hot seat. But that did not deter him. ?After the show, he was leaving the sets but I lunged forward from the audience, screaming his name. He was taken aback and stopped.?

 Kejriwal hugged him and handed over a file containing his creations. ?He flipped through the pages and promised to take a closer look at home. The crew later told me that I was very lucky, as he never waits once the shoot is over.?

 That was in 2000. His card for 2001, therefore, had Bachchan in the quiz master?s chair, asking: ?What is the single most important event of 2000?? The options were ?A. Rajesh meeting Amitabh; B. Rajesh in KBC; C. Rajesh talking to Amitabh; D. All of the above.? Inside is a TV grab showing Kejriwal waving from the KBC sets. The card wishes the recipient a chance to get invited to KBC and meet him as well. 

 Kejriwal?s first attempt the year before was a newsletter announcing his dream venture of a movie with the Big B. From 2001, he went professional with the printing. In Kejriwal?s book, his best card is his fourth ? made for 2004. The inside left page carried the heading Brand Amitabh Bachchan while the right mirrored the words, with Amitabh?s picture being replaced by Kejriwal?s. It went on to map Bachchan?s day using the brands he endorses and wished people ?more chances to be in the Big league?.

 ?I change my habits according to what he endorses. I start the day with Dabur Chyawanprash, drink only Pepsi, wear only Reid amp; Taylor suits, bank with ICICI, use Eveready batteries, write with a Parker... Only I do not have a Versa. A car involves a family decision,? he smiles.

 The only Bachchan film Kejriwal has missed is Ek Nazar, made when he was about 10. ?I have caught so many of his old, lesser-known films when they have re-released in small halls. But Ek Nazar has eluded me,? he rues, adding that he has had no qualms about buying tickets ?in black?, as the kick he gets out of a Bachchan movie is worth much more than the price of the ticket.

 Kejriwal got himself an Airtel connection just to knock on the doors of KBC 2. But some 500 calls and messages later, he has given up as the lines have closed. ?Who wants the money? I want to see my God again.? He lives in wait, of a KBC 3.

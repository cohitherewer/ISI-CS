The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Relief in evening shower

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Rain lashed the city and its adjoining areas on Sunday evening, bringing in much-needed relief from the stifling heat of the past few days. 

 This was the first proper Nor?wester ? the wind speed was around 52 kph ? since the one on April 24, that had claimed eight lives.

 The sky was cloudy for most of the day and opened up around 8.30 pm, bringing temperature down by four degrees Celsius, to 30.6. The rain continued for around 45 minutes. Several low-lying roads went under inches of water.

 ?Over the past few days, we had a favourable condition for a thundershower,? said director of weather section in the Alipore Met office G.C. Basu. ?A favourable wind and a low-pressure trough stretching from east Uttar Pradesh to Gangetic Bengal led to incursion of loads of moisture from the Bay of Bengal. That resulted in cloud formation, but the system lacked a trigger effect that could have caused rains.?

 Since Sunday morning, a low-pressure trough, two km above the sea level, extended over Bihar, Jharkhand and Calcutta. There was also a cyclonic (anti-clockwise) movement of air. ?As a result, tall columns of cumulonimbus clouds formed over the city and its adjoining areas, leading to the thunderstorm,? said Basu.

 ?Parched Calcuttans had been waiting for this shower for the past week,? said a weather official.

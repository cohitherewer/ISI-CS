The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Student?s death file sought

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta High Court on Wednesday asked the state government to produce the deputy inspector-general (Criminal Investigation Department)?s report on the death of Soumitra Biswas, a fourth-year student of RG Kar Medical College. 

 Soumitra?s body was found hanging in a room of the college hostel on August 25, 2001.

 Justice Arun Kumar Bhattacharjee also asked the government to produce the order of the Sealdah additional judicial magistrate, asking the detective department to hand over the investigation of the case to the deputy inspector-general (DIG). 

 The matter will come up for hearing on April 6.

 Wednesday?s directive followed a plea by Soumitra?s mother Sabita. She has accused the DIG of shielding the accused and not probing the case thoroughly. She requested the court to ask the Central Bureau of Investigation to look into the death.

 According to Sabita?s counsel Subhasish Roy, a group of criminals is active on the RG Kar campus. ?These criminals killed Soumitra after he came to know their secrets,? he claimed.

 Soumitra was in his Barrackpore residence on August 25, 2001. ?He rushed to the hostel on receiving a call. The body was found in his hostel room in the evening,? the lawyer stated.

 Four other students of the college had been killed by the criminals, Roy added.

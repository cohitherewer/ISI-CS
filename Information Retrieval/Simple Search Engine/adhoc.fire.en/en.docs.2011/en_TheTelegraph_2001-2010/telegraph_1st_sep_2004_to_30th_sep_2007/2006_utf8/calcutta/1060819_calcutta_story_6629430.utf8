 Six-year-old Khushi Tibrewal doesnt care much for cinema. It is television that she wants to be on. She has taught herself a dance number and is itching for her turn to perform. John might be upar, she confides in a hushed whisper.

 John Abraham was everywhere in the posters and cut-outs. The actor was the face of the contest John Aur Kaun organised by Hungama TV that had drawn the kids to the Birla High School auditorium. Calcutta is one of our best markets. I reached here at 8.30 am to see queues on both sides of the street, smiled Vinayak Warke, senior manager, marketing, Hungama.

 The kids came donning different 

 avatars (picture by Sudeshna Banerjee). Divya Pawan was 

 Basanti of Sholay, Sneha Basu became a Hungama VJ, 

 Priyanka Pandey came all the way from Jamshedpur to be Anjali 

 of Kuch Kuch Hota Hai At stake were two roles 

 of a boy and a girl in a film starring Abraham that UTV 

 will produce next year.

 The chosen eight from the city Zainab Khatoon, Chandni Debnath, Tracy Chen, Palak Vimlesh Shah, Sayantan Mukherjee, Pratyosh Pratim Debnath, Ankan Ray and Eshaan Khullar will be flown to Mumbai for the finals.

Treat of tales

 Indradhanush The Rainbow, a musical extravaganza by the junior section of Lakshmipat Singhania Academy, was held at the Science City auditorium on August 6. About 700 children participated in the programme based on the theme of Unity and stories from Panchatantra.

 Dances and dramas were an audio-visual treat, with thoughtfully and creatively designed costumes. The tales were no less charming. Mice united to rescue pigeons. The animals and birds of a forest taught the mighty elephant a lesson in good manners. Unity of effort by crows, deer, sparrows and owls brought about the downfall of a selfish cobra. A monsoon dance by the fauna in the forest. The music on the tabla and synthesiser enhanced the riot of colours on stage.

 Top talent

 Ranjan, Reshma, Vishal and many others in the finals of Rin Mera Star Super Star put up captivating performances set to Bollywood numbers. The countrys biggest talent hunt for children from five to 14 years, organised by Hindustan Lever Limited, was held at Childrens Little Theatre in Dhakuria on August 8. 

 Singing, acting and dancing were three of the categories in the competition, covering 125 city schools. The initial screening of the contestants was done through contact programmes by a coordinator in each school. The school auditions had the respective principals, vice-principals, art teachers and the school coordinators as judges.

 The talent hunt started a month ago and 150 kids were short-listed for the final auditions from amongst over 8,500 students. The auditions were held from August 6 to 8. Ranjan Naskar, a Class VI student, who performed to Jhalak dikhlaja, was thrilled that he had made it to the final auditions. The parents, accompanying their children to the auditions, were a proud lot.

 But are such talent hunts targeted just at some privileged children? Of course not. I came across many participants who were from middle-class and poor families, says John Mondol principal, Chinsurah Duff High school, and a judge at the city finals. Odissi dancer Bornali Mitra was the other judge. The five toppers from the city will battle it out at the all-India finals to be held in Mumbai. The winner will get a prize of Rs 5 lakh. The grand finale will also be aired on Star Plus in September.

 Billions in waiting

 Dear Dr Robert Sanchez, Mr Yukon of London, Mr Bruno Micar and Mrs Susan Kabila,

 Thank you very much for offering large sums of money to me over the past week. I feel so grateful that I have decided to share the story of my good fortune with the rest of the world.

 Dear Dr Sanchez, you have informed me that I am the lucky winner of the Euro Millions Spanish Lottery Winners International E-mail programmes held on August 14, 2006, and that I am therefore approved for a lump sum payout of 1.000.000.00 Euro (One Million Euro). You have also asked me to keep my winning information confidential due to some mix-up of some numbers and names. In fact, there has been such a mix-up of names that you have signed the email as Mrs Comfort Jose. Never mind, such things happen. As and when I receive my million euros, I am sure I will remember you with gratitude.

 Dear Mr Yukon, allow me to congratulate you on being named after a Canadian territory as well as a river. You have offered me 30 per cent of $18 million of your money, stored in some European embassy vault, in lieu of my agreeing to handle it and invest it profitably in some business. Mr Yukon, sir, I say YES! Let us at once join hands to create a business empire spanning the four corners of the world. As soon as I receive my cheque of $ 5.4 million, I will share with you my revolutionary business idea of producing electricity from cucumbers.

 Dear Mr Bruno Micar, I am breathless with excitement. If I understand you correctly, a certain Mr Gregory B. Wilson died in a plane crash on July 19, 2003. He left the staggering sum of 52 million sterling in his bank account which has been claimed by neither friends nor family in the last three years. You now offer me 35 per cent of the money in return for acting as the next of kin of the deceased. You also assure me that the fund is legitimate and does not originate from drug, money laundry, terrorism or any other illegal act. Money laundry Mr Micar? That would be the currency notes one forgets to take out of ones pockets before putting them into the washing machine, right? Whew, I never knew that was illegal.

 Dear Mrs Kabila, I was about to write you a fulsome note as well but this is becoming predictable. So let me say instead: stop sending me these stupid emails about being the widow of some deposed dictator whose billions are now frozen in a bank account. I am sure there are many gullible people in the world who might send you their bank account and credit card details, but I am not about to do so. So do go away, will you? On second thoughts, dont. Your emails might just give me material for another column.

 Next week: In which 

 we travel to Flatlland

 To celebrate its silver anniversary, Inner Wheel Club of Calcutta Downtown presents A World Music Show: Taal Tantra, composed and directed by Tanmoy Bose. Bose?s long and profound association with music maestros of the stature of Pandit Ravi Shankar and Ustad Amjad Ali Khan has helped him study the craft of drummers of international repute through his involvement in their projects. As a response to their music and from his keen understanding of rhythm, he has sown the seeds of his very own experimental music carnival, the taal tantra. Defining the scope of world music from the perspective of Indian music, the presentation glides from the tabla to a plethora of percussion instruments from all over the globe, capturing the spirit of universal musical harmony. Achieving the effect of familiar strokes while playing on unfamiliar instruments, it is an odyssey that traverses the diverse and distinctive melodies produced by African drums, tambourines, native American buffalo drums and a host of others, to give birth to an entirely new genre of contemporary world music.

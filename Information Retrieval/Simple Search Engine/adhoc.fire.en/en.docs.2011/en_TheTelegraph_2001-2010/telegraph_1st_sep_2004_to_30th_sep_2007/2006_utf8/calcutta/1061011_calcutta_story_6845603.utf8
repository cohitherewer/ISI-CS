 Wanted, dengue monitor

 SANJAY MANDAL

 The spread of dengue in Calcutta and the rest of the state can be attributed to the lack of an integrated and continuous surveillance system.

 There has to be an integrated system of monitoring mosquito densities and outbreak of dengue and other vector-borne diseases round the year, said an expert working on dengue-control measures of the state government. 

 Ideally, there should be a central wing for monitoring arbo viruses (those carried by vectors) and hospitals and health centres must send blood samples there for proper investigation, he added.

 Although there is no surveillance centre for communicable diseases, the Institute of Health and Family Welfare is running a programme to keep a tab on Japanese encephalitis. 

 Circulars are being sent to hospitals to forward blood samples of patients suffering from encephalitis to the School of Tropical Medicine, Indian Council of Medical Research or Burdwan Medical College and Hospital.

 But no such centre has been set up for dengue, though last years outbreak affected more than 6,000 people in the state, the expert pointed out.

 According to virologists, the Type II dengue virus is responsible for the spread of the disease in Calcutta and its neighbouring areas. The symptoms are mild fever and headache and an antibody to the virus is usually formed in the body. But the situation tends to spin out of control when the vector carries a new virus, said a virologist.

 A new virus is not difficult to identify if there is proper monitoring of blood samples. And once it is identified, the government can launch area-specific measures to arrest its spread, including controlling the mosquito population.

 Health services director K.S. Barui claimed the health department runs year-long vigil. Volunteers regularly monitor the situation and ask patients with dengue symptoms to get their blood samples tested if the fever does not subside after five days.

 Refuting his claim, experts said that till now, only a handful of samples have been sent to the School of Tropical Medicine or Indian Council of Medical Research.

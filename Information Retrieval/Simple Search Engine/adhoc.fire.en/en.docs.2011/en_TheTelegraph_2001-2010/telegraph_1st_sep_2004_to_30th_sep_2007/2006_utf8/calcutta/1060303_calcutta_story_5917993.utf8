 The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) has expressed grave concern over the static condition of the angel atop Victoria Memorial Hall. 

 In a report submitted to Calcutta High Court on Thursday, the ASI said if the stones, dislodged for repairing the angel, were not reset within a fortnight, the figure atop the monument was at risk. 

 Sushil Kumar Chowdhury, deputy superintending archaeologist, ASI, in his six-page report, said removal of the marble blocks beneath the angel was very risky. High technical efficiency is required to manage it. He alleged that the Memorial authorities did not consult the ASI before taking up the repairing work. 

 M. Bhattacharyya, former head of the department of mechanical engineering, Jadavpur University, the person appointed by the Memorial for repairing the angel, also placed a report before the court later in the day.

 He said: ?The job is quite tricky and manoeuvring the tools in the restricted space is quite a delicate task.? He added that the amount of damage to the ball bearings at the angel?s base is still not known. 

 After going through the reports, the division bench? presided over by Justice A.K. Ganguly observed that both the ASI and Memorial authorities should maintain coordination. The court also asked the authorities to complete the work ?slowly and steadily.?

 Environment activist Subhas Dutta informed the court that the British government and some of its departments were also interested in extending technical assistance for the job. The court said the Memorial was free to seek any assistance from any agency.

Multiple 

 Grammy-winning and Pulitzer Prize-winning jazz composer 

 Wynton Marsalis, the Dizzy Gillespie Alumni Band, Mingus 

 Dynasty, Roy Hargrove, Thelonius Monk Jr have all evinced 

 interest to perform in the city, according to Pamela A. 

 Hall, programme director of the Riff jazz channel of WorldSpace 

 Satellite Radio network.

 They are all keen to come 

 down to India and Calcutta and we are looking at options 

 and strategic partners to make that happen, Pamela 

 told GoodLife last week, on her first visit to Calcutta. 

 She was in town for a workshop-performance by Chennai-based 

 jazz pianist Madhav Chari, the only Indian musician to be 

 aired on Riff.

 While Chari, who has studied and 

 interacted musically with Wynton Marsalis, is trying to 

 steer the artiste to India and play under his leadership, 

 Riff is ready to jazz with the duo when the collaboration 

 clicks into gear. Upcoming trumpeter Roy Hargrove, unearthed 

 by Marsalis himself, is another name on the India swing 

 roll.

 Also John Lee, who used 

 to play bass with Dizzy Gillespie and now directs the Alumni 

 Band, has spoken to me and said they want to make music 

 in India. Ditto with the Dynasty, which is still keeping 

 the Charles Mingus music alive and Monk Junior, disclosed 

 Pamela.

 With a career in radio spanning 

 over two decades and now celebrating her fifth year as programme 

 director and an on-air personality for Riff, Pamela is also 

 scouting around for Indian jazz and blues musicians who 

 could be featured on the channel. All I need are CDs 

 and we will evaluate those, besides looking at potential 

 for hooking them up with US jazz artistes, she smiled.

 Riff is readying a one-hour blues 

 special programme to be aired on Indian prime time, 

 while a fusion window is also being eyed. On a weeklong 

 India trek stopping at Bangalore, Calcutta, Chennai and 

 Mumbai with the WorldSpace Chari shows, Pamela hopes to 

 pick up threads to help her stitch together more programming 

 for India.

 Once back at the networks 

 Georgia Avenue, Silver Spring studio on August 29, Pamela, 

 responsible for creating the sound and feel of Riff (Im 

 a one-woman army really, with just part-time jockeys helping 

 out, she says) hopes to turn to her dad again.

 William Hall, young-at-heart at 

 80 and possessing some of the finest records of jazz 

 classics, calls himself Dr Jazz on radio, 

 and helps daughter Pamela out with a hugely popular 

 show, lending his priceless collection to the WorldSpace 

 archives.

 Pamela is passionate about jazz 

 and a warehouse of information on the music, its performers 

 and the entire sub-culture that the genre has created around 

 itself.

 I owe a lot of that passion 

 to my parents who played jazz in the house all the time 

 and even travelled from Baltimore to New York to catch all 

 the greats on 52nd Street, including Ella Fitzgerald and 

 Frank Sinatra, she declared.

 Riff brings Americas indigenous 

 jazz music to a global audience, presenting legends like 

 Miles Davis and Count Basie, alongside todays artistes 

 like Arturo Sandoval, Diana Krall and Joe Sample to another 

 generation. It also blends the ever-widening range of international 

 jazz players like Antonio Carlos Jobim, Ruben Gonzales and 

 Cesaria Evora.

 A 400 sq ft space done up with plush leather sofas, wood panels, designer tiles and neon lights? All of it contributing to create an ambience more suited to a lounge. This brand new haunt, however, is not just another lounge bar or cafe, but the first-of-its-kind jewellery lounge in the city.

 An extension of the DiaGold showroom at Sumangal Apartments at 4, Lee Road, the lounge houses Sogni D Oro, exclusive Italian jewellery from Italindi Jewellers.

 After Mumbai and Chennai, this is the third standalone jewellery lounge in the country, says Hitesh Lohia, director, Italindi Jewellers (India) Ltd.

 He explains the concept: This place is different from a store in the sense that it is not just about selling and buying jewellery. It is a whole new experience, an involvement on the part of both the buyers and the salespeople to get a true feel of the design. One can spend time here, wear the jewellery and see how it looks on her before buying.

 Sogni D Oro (dreams in gold) offers over 5,000 designs of exclusive handmade and machine-made jewellery, crafted in 18-carat gold.

 The range comprises neckpieces, bracelets, cufflinks, pendants, chains, rings, stoles and several other pieces in some rather stunning international designs. With gold being interwoven with silk, textured and fashioned into meshes, ropes, braids, cubes, and extruded into hollowware, the collection has a contemporary mood. 

 The jewellery is also enhanced by different types of finishes ? matte, frosted diamond dust, enamelled and mirror look. Some of the pieces are studded with precious stones, too.

 Great designs are our brands USP. Mostly in gold, they are extremely stylish, wearable and are marked by affordability. Apart from the familiar yellow gold, our jewellery is also available in pink, white, lime green, brown, black and tri-coloured gold tones to enhance design variations, reveals Lohia.

 Not just the ornaments, the ambience goes a long way to make your trip to the lounge memorable. For one, you can relax in the comforts of the lounge while trained saleswomen show you the jewellery of your choice. You dont have to walk up to the jewellery counter. We have trained the salespeople so that they are able to understand the preferences of customers quickly. So, you could stay seated in the lounge and they will bring the jewellery to you, says Varda Goenka, proprietor of DiaGold.

 The saleswomen could also give you a tip or two about the kind of jewellery that suits your face best, and the various mix-and-match options. We are trying to promote an entirely different experience while buying jewellery, adds Goenka.

 Apart from the concept of this lounge, which will set a new trend altogether, we also wanted our clients to get a taste and feel of Italian jewellery, she smiles.

 But is Calcutta ready for a jewellery lounge? After some research we found that the city has great potential. Much of the market is actually untapped. People in Calcutta are always willing to experiment with new things. We are confident about the concept of a jewellery lounge doing very well here, feels Lohia.

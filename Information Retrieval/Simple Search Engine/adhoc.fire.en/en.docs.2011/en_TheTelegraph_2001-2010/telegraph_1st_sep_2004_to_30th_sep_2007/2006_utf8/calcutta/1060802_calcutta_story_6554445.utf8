 Bringing together maturity and experience with the excitement of innovation and experiment, the ongoing exhibition of paintings by well-known and promising artists of Bengal attempts to highlight the predominant moods and themes by which creative minds are stimulated. Featuring one work by each artist, it focuses on issues of topical relevance like violence, terrorism and the threat to the natural environment, at the same time bearing traces of the more peaceful and moderate aspects of life. Ultimately, the artists tone is one of optimism, affirming that humanity will survive and civilisation progress despite hazards and adversities that fall in its way. Participating artists include Amitabha Banerjee, Wasim Kapoor, Kanchan Dasgupta, Dwijen Gupta, Anup Roy (the painting by him appears above), Dhiraj Chowdhury, Dipti Chakrabarti, Subrata Chowdhury, Debashish Deb, Pradip Rakshit, Somnath Roy, Ratan Acharya and Biswapati Maity.

 PASSION - Dr Goutam Mukherjee

 You must have come across a host 

 of problems while adopting a pet. How to understand if a 

 pet is healthy? What kind of disposition will go with your 

 lifestyle? Your decision is sure to be from the heart, but 

 here are some suggestions to guide you on a pets health 

 and temperament.

 Try to buy a puppy from a breeder, 

 so that you can meet the parents. By seeing a dogs parents 

 you can judge its temperament.

 Watch the condition of the puppy. 

 Is its nose cool and damp? Are there signs of nasal discharge? 

 The gums should be a bright pink; a pale colour can mean 

 anaemia or a problem with worms. Are the teeth clean and 

 straight? (If the setting of the upper and lower teeth is 

 crooked, your dog will score less points if you take it 

 to a show.)

 Eyes should be bright and sparkling, 

 and looking straight ahead. White spots or visible lines 

 on the surface of the eye can mean trouble. Check for redness 

 or inflammation of the eyelids. The ear canals should be 

 clean and free of odour. A deposition of wax and dirt, tenderness 

 and shaking of head would indicate ear mite or infection.

 Feel the stomach. A swollen stomach 

 indicates poor diet or possibility of worms. A bulge at 

 the navel or groin may mean hernia. The genitals should 

 be clean and free from irritation, which could indicate 

 worms, diarrhoea or a digestive disorder. A male dog should 

 have both testicles. The coat should be fluffy and clean. 

 Sores, itching or deposits in the fur indicate fleas, mites 

 or other parasites. Check if the heartbeat is strong and 

 regular.

 Finally, watch how the dog is 

 built. See if the legs are straight and well-formed and 

 the toes well-arched. The puppy should run without a limp. 

 Beware of an animal that is thin and underweight or distinctly 

 overweight. The most desirable pet is one that appears well-proportioned 

 for its age and weight.

 While choosing a puppy you must 

 watch its reaction when it sees you for the first time. 

 If the puppy cosies up to you and licks your hand you can 

 rest assured it would be friendly. If its afraid of you 

 and urinates, dont take it. This one will be a shy dog. 

 Grown-up shy dogs usually have a tendency to bite.

 If you want to enrol your pet 

 in a dog show, check if its been registered. The dog will 

 be easily registered if its parents had been registered 

 with the Kennel Club of India (KCI) in Chennai. The breeder 

 will then give you a name transfer form. One side of the 

 form should be signed by the dogs previous owners.

 After registration, the KCI will 

 hand you the dogs pedigree papers which will help you mate 

 your dog. If the breeder cannot give you this paper, you 

 can take your dog to a nominated judge when its a year-old. 

 The certification from the nominated judge will help you 

 get the KCI registration.

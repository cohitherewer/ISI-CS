 Jewellery, cash looted

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Gold ornaments and cash, worth about Rs 2 lakh, were looted from a house at Rabindrapally, near Baguiati, on Saturday evening. 

 According to the complaint lodged by Goutam Malakar with Rajarhat thana, the criminals entered his house between 5 pm and 7 pm, when his mother had gone out. We cannot figure out how the men managed to sneak in. My mother is quite aged and she did not see anybody around the house while going out. When she returned, she found the main door open and the almirah ransacked, said Malakar.

 It seems an insider had tipped off the robbers that Malakars mother steps out of the house every evening, said an officer of Rajarhat thana.

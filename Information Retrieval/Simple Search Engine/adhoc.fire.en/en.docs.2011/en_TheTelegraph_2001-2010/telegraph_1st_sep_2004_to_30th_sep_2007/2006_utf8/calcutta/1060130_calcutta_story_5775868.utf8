 Cine celebrations

 PRATIM D. GUPTA

 What: The launch of Anjan Dutts film The Bong Connection.

 Where: Rosewood Hall, The Park.

 When: Friday evening.

 The bash: The unveiling of the English film that tries to put Bengal on the global map also saw the launch of production house Moxie Entertainment Pvt Ltd. 

 The brainchild of Joy B. Ganguly, the film aims to promote cinema from Bengal and establish its essence in the world market. 

 So, Bong Connection will not only be shot in Houston ? apart from Calcutta ? but will also be premiered at the North American Bengali Conference (NABC) in Houston later this year.

 Apart from the main cast ? Raima Sen, Shayon Munshi, Riya Sen and Parambrata Chatterjee ? lots of well-wishers turned up to convey their best wishes to Dutt and his team. 

 If Mrinal Sen was happy to see Dutt make another film, Victor Banerjee ? also part of the cast ? had tongue firmly in cheek as he spoke about Stephen Hawkings Big Bong Theory. 

 Bikram Ghosh, who features in the soundtrack of the movie composed by Neel Dutt, was also there describing his connections with Bengal and beyond. 

 Some surprise guests for the evening were Moon Moon Sen and Mohan Agashe, who joined the action pretty late in the evening. By then the wine was flowing freely, and the finger food was doing the rounds. 

 The films shooting started last Thursday at Someplace Else, The Park, and will go on till mid-February in Calcutta, before the venue shifts to the United States in March.

 Voiceover: We should feel sorry that we havent been able to give a Dil Chahta Hai from this part of the world. But better late than never, said Joy, who is also the ideator of the film.

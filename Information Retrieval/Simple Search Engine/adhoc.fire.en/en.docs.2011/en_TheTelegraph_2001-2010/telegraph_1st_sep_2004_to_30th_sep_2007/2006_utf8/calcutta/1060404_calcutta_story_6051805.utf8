The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 President poems in album debut

 SEBANTI SARKAR

 Soma Ghosh with President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam and Ustad Bismillah Khan

 Whispers of Jasmine, releasing next month, marks a double debut. It will be the first of President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam?s poems to be set to tune and a maiden attempt by Indian classical vocalist Soma Ghosh at composing and singing non-classical tunes. 

 ?It was a personal request by the President two years ago, after my duet with Ustad Bismillah Khan in Parliament,? Soma told Metro from Mumbai.

 A disciple of Bageswari Devi, Soma is a well-known exponent of the Benaras gharana, with several albums to her credit, including Aradhana, composed by Ustad Bismillah Khan, a live recording of a duet with the maestro, a collection of Krishna bhajans, compilations of Hori and khayal brought out by Sagarika and another label.

 ?The President had invited me to the Mughal Gardens in Rashtrapati Bhavan and shown me a jasmine tree. Its flowers, he felt, were complaining of being crushed under the feet. The President felt that the tree was pacifying the flowers by telling them it was the other way round, and everyone was around because of their beauty. These thoughts had given birth to an English poem, which the President wanted me to sing,? recalled Soma. 

 ?I hesitated initially. But since I respect the President as a human being, scientist and a musician (he plays the veena) and because the song contains valuable messages, I agreed,? said Soma. 

 The English version of the song has been composed by Vivek Prakash. Prakash Chandra Kaushik adapted it in Hindi and Soma herself set it to tune.

 ?I selected the President?s favourite ragas for the longish poem ? Kalavati, Bhairavi and Yaman,? added Soma.

 The album was unveiled before a select audience last month, before being presented to the President.

 Soma is now trying to set another of the President?s poems to tune so that both can be included in the album, to be made available to the public next month. NA Classical will bring out the album.

 Light on hinterland

 SOUMITRA DAS

 The young warrior, one of the photo exhibits

 Curiously enough, British Council, along with British Museum, School of Oriental and African Studies and the Centre for Cultural Research and Documentation, Arunachal Pradesh government, and Arunachal University, are holding an exhibition at Academy of Fine Arts, titled Tribal Transitions, of archival and contemporary photographs of the tribes of what was part of the hinterland, once collectively know as the North-East Frontier Agency.

 Whatever may be the rationale of organising this exhibition, it should be of interest to viewers in general, for it does present an ?overview of the cultural history of Arunachal Pradesh during the past 150 years?, to quote the press handout, however one-sided that view may be. The old photographs have never been seen outside the archives in the UK.

 The quite ordinary, contemporary photographs are part of an ongoing project that began in 2002 and will end next year. These are by Michael Aram Tarr, who used a Leica and field cameras for the large-format photographs. He says there are 25 tribes in Arunachal Pradesh and although it is difficult to get statistics on them, some of them are poor while others are more prosperous. This becomes evident from Tarr?s photographs, mostly in colour. They are Buddhists and animists and Christians, as well. However, it needs an expert to distinguish one tribe from another and viewers should be prepared to be confused.

 The archival photographs are, as the handout reveals, part of the collection of the notorious ethnographic studies, whereby the British sought to measure and stereotype races. 

 The earliest photographs, dating back to 1861, are the most interesting. Although these are studio portraits of young warriors and a chief?s daughter, they are true to life and are expressive of the sitters? fleeting thoughts.

 Many of Tarr?s photographs complement the older ones. He has photographed many of the tribals? esoteric rituals, such as the bridge-building festival and healing ritual. Very revealing is Tarr?s photo of the construction of the cane bridge juxtaposed with 1935 shots with its half-naked labourers.

 There are two other photographs that throw light on how the Empire functioned ? The Palaver, where British officers negotiate a murder case, and another of some young tribals accused in a murder case.

 With a few notable exceptions, most of the people shot in the earlier photographs were poor. One wonders how modern Arunachalis will react to that.

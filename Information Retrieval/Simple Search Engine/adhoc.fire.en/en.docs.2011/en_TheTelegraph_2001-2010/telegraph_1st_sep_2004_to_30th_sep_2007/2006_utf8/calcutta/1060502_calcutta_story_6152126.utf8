 recognition 

Feng Shui Matters

Q: 

 I have been working very hard for 

 the past two years in a company but have not been getting 

 any reward or recognition. There has been no upward growth 

 in my career and even the raise in my salary has been meagre. 

 Please suggest measures to improve my situation.

 THE SOLUTION: The best way to win greater recognition and appreciation for your work is by energising the southern wall of your bedroom. Adding the element of fire or its associated colour red can do this. Try incorporating red paintings, lamps, fresh roses and candles here.

 You can place the picture of a tortoise or a painting that depicts a person climbing a mountain or stairs on the northern wall of your bedroom. You can even place pictures of a rocket shooting up and balloons flying high in the air. In fact, anything that depicts a rise in life can be introduced here.

 To give a boost to your financial 

 status, take a careful look into the south-east corner of 

 your bedroom. Ensure that there is nothing negative lying 

 here and invite good luck by placing three silver coins 

 or its multiples wrapped in a red paper.

 The other way 

 Q: 

 On a recent visit to America I 

 came to know that people there practice the Bagua method 

 of Feng Shui, whereas you use the Pakua method. I am totally 

 confused now; please clarify.

 Sreealata

 THE SOLUTION: Pakua and Bagua are similar to each other. Feng Shui originated in China and is practised with the help of a compass, where the actual magnetic north of the earth is taken into consideration and the rest of the directions are automatically assessed. Pakua is an instrument where each direction is connected with an aspiration in our lives. The north of the Pakua is aligned with the magnetic north of the house and then necessary adjustments, remedies and corrections are made.

 The same science travelled to the US and the Americans modified it to suit their convenience. They consider the entrance to be the north, irrespective of the magnetic north of the earth. They believe that the entrance of the house is the point from where the journey of our life starts.

 In both methods, the meanings 

 of the directions remain the same, but of course the directions 

 change. Both forms are effective, provided they are implemented 

 correctly.

 Business boom 

 Q: 

 I am going to start a garment business 

 with my partner. Please suggest ways by which I can grow 

 my business.

 Dhruv

 THE SOLUTION: The type of business you are entering into is connected with the wood element. Green is the colour of wood, which also symbolises growth; and is a good choice for you to be surrounded with. So try incorporating this colour in your company board, logo, frames, markers, tapestry etc.

 Keep important documents in green 

 folders, marked with green indices in the south-east corner, 

 for financial growth. Keeping the papers in the south-east 

 corner can help your loan requests materialise. Even green 

 paper clips can become tools for success. The furniture 

 like tables, chairs and cabinets should be made of wood. 

 To give a further boost to your business, try placing three 

 fresh plants or its multiples in the east of the office.

 Metal mantra

 Q: 

 I was born on April 21, 1979. I 

 have been working for the last three years and now want 

 to venture into a business. Please suggest what business 

 will suit me. Please guide me with my favourable elements 

 and their related colours.

 Siddarth

 THE SOLUTION: Your pillars of destiny reveal that you are a strong earth person. Metal symbolises your intelligence and creativity and water represents your wealth. This means you can generate wealth with your intelligence when it is put into any metal-related business. The choices are computers, automobiles, steel factories and jewellery.

 Water, being your next wealth element, will fetch you money from export and import of metal-related items. Your favourable elements are metal and water and their related colours like white, copper, gold, silver, blue and black.

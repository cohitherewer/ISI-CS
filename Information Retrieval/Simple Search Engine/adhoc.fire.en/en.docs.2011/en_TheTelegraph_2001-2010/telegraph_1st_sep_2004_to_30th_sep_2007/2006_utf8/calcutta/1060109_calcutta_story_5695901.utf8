 Braveheart battles to live

 PRASUN BHATTACHARJEE

 August 8, 2004: Three-year-old Sushmita Sen is lying in Rabindranath Tagore International Institute for Cardiac Sciences. She will undergo a critical cardiac surgery the next day. A youth, Chandan Yadav, is holding her hand, trying to allay her fears. Yadav is not related to the girl, but has spent several sleepless nights for her. When she will be operated on hours later, he will even save her life by donating blood

 January 7, 2006: Chandan Yadav is lying in bed number 28 of the new emergency building of SSKM Hospital, fighting a chronic renal failure that requires an immediate kidney transplant. No one is holding his hand to allay his fears

 Members of the social welfare organisation Chandan is associated with are keeping their fingers crossed that their 21-year-old colleague will survive.

 ?How will we raise money for the transplant? We are appealing to everyone, distributing leaflets and activating all our sources for funds. We are not ready to accept that such a thing can happen to Chandan, who has saved at least 25 children in the past two years,? said a member of Diganta, the NGO Chandan is associated with. 

 How much will the treatment cost? An initial estimate by an SSKM official suggests that Rs 50,000 will be needed for the transplant alone. Post-operative medication will cost Rs 1.1 lakh in the first year and another Rs 50,000 in the second.

 Chandan?s father Ramashankar, 52, who lost his jute mill job eight years ago following a closure and now runs a small grocery shop, cannot afford the sum. 

 He has, instead, decided to donate one of his kidneys to save his youngest son. ?I?ve two other sons. But they are young and I don?t want either of them to lose a vital organ. My days are numbered and I want to see Chandan normal again before I die,? said Ramashankar, unable to hold back tears. He is now undergoing various tests at a south Calcutta centre. 

 Nephrologist Rajendra Pandey, who is treating Chandan, said the transplant is needed immediately. ?He is on dialysis. We want to perform the surgery at the earliest, as long-duration dialysis sometimes renders the transplant unsuccessful.? 

 Unfortunately, as Chandan battles for life, no one has come forward with help. ?We had appealed to the health minister and the health department has offered him four dialysis sessions free. That?s all,? said an NGO official.

 Mishaps send cops to class

 - Poor awareness among school students prompts safety drive

 SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE

 The traffic police of North 24-Parganas have dropped their batons and taken to chalk and blackboards to check the spiral in road mishaps.

 For the past two weeks, the men in uniform explained the automated traffic signals to nearly 150 students of Salt Lake Collegiate School, in BE block of the township.

 The camp was organised to promote traffic awareness among school students. Police are planning more such lectures and demonstrations in schools. 

 ?If we can teach students when to stop and when to cross the road, our mission will be successful. We found that even bright students are not aware of traffic signals. We have decided to hold awareness drives round the year, instead of only during traffic safety weeks,? said Praveen Kumar, superintendent of police (North 24-Parganas). ?We are shifting to an automated traffic signal system, but the children are not even aware of what the signals mean. This is shocking,? Kumar rued.

 A group of traffic officers of North 24-Parganas, in collaboration with some Salt Lake schools and NGOs, conducted a survey in several schools in early 2005 to assess the level of awareness among students.

 ?We were astonished to find that many of the students did not know that signals blink before they change. They thought it was safe to cross a road when the signal is blinking,? revealed senior traffic officer Gouranga Paul. 

 After analysing the findings of the survey, the cops decided to start a pilot project. A few traffic officers were chosen to teach students of classes I to VI the workings of the automated traffic signal system. A blueprint of the project was drawn up before the cops started taking traffic classes in eight schools in different sub-divisions of the district. 

 The enthusiastic response to the pilot project, conducted between August and December last year, encouraged the police to extend its scope from this year. The traffic classes were started in Salt Lake schools in January. 

 ?We have also started to identify the points where the students might face accidents. For example, there are over 10 government and private schools on VIP Road. Nearly 3,000 students regularly cross the road. We will conduct training programmes in these schools,? said Jayanta Maitra, who works in an NGO that is part of the project.

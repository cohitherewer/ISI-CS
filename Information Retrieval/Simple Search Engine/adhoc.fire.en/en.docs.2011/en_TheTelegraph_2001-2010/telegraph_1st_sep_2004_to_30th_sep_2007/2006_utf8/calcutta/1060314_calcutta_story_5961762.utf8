put together an essential fact file to see your skin and hair through Holi

You are likely to be in the last stages of planning 

that perfect Holi bash ? the clothes are all decided, the platter has been picked 

and the CDs to belt out your favourite numbers have been sorted out. All you need 

to do now is generously stock up on colours and gulal for a dhamaka 

do.

 But dont go into this Holi-day blindfolded. Be well aware of the hazards that this festival brings with it. Skin rashes and other problems are par for the course on Holi and after.

 Dr Sachin Varma, consultant dermatologist at Apollo Gleneagles Hospital says: Festivals like Holi have social and psychological advantages that we cannot deny. The kind of life we lead, there is hardly any chance to catch up with friends and family except on these few days. But you must remember to play it safe and play it in the right spirit. 

 GoodLife draws up a list of things to do and not to do to make this Holi a memorable one.

 Before 

 Prevention is better than cure. Beauty care or boisterous fun, make sure you know what to go for and what to keep away from. Personal safety and choosing the right colours are top priorities.

 Organise the right kind of clothes, preferably 

in thick fabrics.

 It is good to wear clothes that will cover 

most of your body. 

 Wear caps to protect your hair. Those with 

long hair can tie them up.

 Make plastic vests for children. Take a big 

plastic sheet, keep the open end downwards and cut out a semi circle at the other 

end and also on the sides so that it can be slipped on easily. Leggings are a 

good option for the lower limbs.

 Apply a thick layer of moisturiser, coconut 

or any oil on your body and hair till they glisten. This will help prevent 

harmful chemicals from entering your body, points out Dr Varma. It could 

also help keep some of the frenzied mob at bay! 

 A sunscreen is a must as colours and sunlight 

combine to cause a photo toxic reaction. 

 Paint your finger and toe nails with transparent 

nail polish. 

 Wear dental caps to save your teeth from any 

unwanted stains.

 Arrange for the old 70s shades. They 

not only guard your eyes against the misfire of harmful colour or water jets but 

also make a prominent style statement. 

 Feel the texture of the colour before buying 

it. It should feel powdery and not grainy or gritty. Stay away from permanent 

and metallic colours. They contain cheap dyes that can cause reactions. If 

you are playing wet Holi make sure you dissolve water soluble colours in small 

proportions rather than a thick solution, says Dr Varma. 

 Organic colours are the best option. Here are 

some quick ways to whip them up at home ? mix a spoon of powdered haldi in 

a cup of flour or gram flour or talcum powder for a dry yellow colour; chopped 

pieces of beetroot soaked in water for a few hours give a wonderful magenta colour; 

green can be obtained by mixing a paste of spinach, coriander or mint leaves in 

water.

 During

 Most disasters happen when you go overboard while at play. So it is best to keep reminding yourself that irrational activity of any kind could be injurious to family and friends. 

 After

 Now comes the part you dread the most ? coping up with the after-effects of festive frenzy. 

 To bring back the shine and volume in your hair, rinse it with lemon juice or leftover beer, Dr Santhanam offers.

 Use steam on your face to open the pores and release the colours trapped in them, she adds.

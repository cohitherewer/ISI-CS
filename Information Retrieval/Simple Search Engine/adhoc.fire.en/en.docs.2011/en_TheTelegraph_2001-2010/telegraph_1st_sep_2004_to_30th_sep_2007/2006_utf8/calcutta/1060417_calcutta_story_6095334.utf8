Life

 Hip, happening and street smart

A cool biker image or that of a rap artiste, 

individualistic styling is what sets these men apart, discovers Shradha Agarwal

 Attitude, chunk and a whole lot of funk ? a few things that make the street dressing man. 

 Not a bit apologetic about his oversized jeans, torn red sneakers or lime green tee, that too at a society do, the street-styled man makes heads turn and eyes widen as he walks through any door. His hair, accessories and mannerisms too set new trends.

 You can love him or hate him but there is just no ignoring him. GoodLife tells you more about his intriguing style statement.

 Who is he?

 Sporty, rugged and cool? the street dressing male can be a happening biker-variety dude or a hip rap artiste-type guy. 

 Whichever style path he does choose to pick, eye catching it must be. 

 According to designer Abhishek Dutta, he is a person whose entire agenda revolves around getting noticed. And thats precisely why he styles himself loudly, be it in his choice of colours, his in-your-face accessories or body language, explains Abhishek.

 Adds designer Preeti Jhawar: A street dresser male in India is usually one of two extremes ? either clean-shaven and metrosexual, complete with a floral printed shirt, or he is a very rugged man with a rough-and-tough look.

 Style consultant Sunipa Samadders take on these men is that they are like the sponge, absorbing the fad from fashion, the glitz from advertising, the sheen from glamour but, above all, having a street sense to mix them all up to form the perfect street concoction.

 Theme talk

 Even if the street dresser is wearing regular sporty clothes, his styling ? that is far from regular ? will set him apart.

 Abhishek feels lots of extra chains is one characteristic. He uses these metallic chains for glamour and effect. Sometimes he could hang one across his jeans pockets or even from his wallet.

 Sunipa says functionality is not a favourite with these men. Their outfits are styled such that they feel good in it? They wear something only because they like the visual appeal, be it crazy, uncensored slogans on their tees or anything else.

 Other signature elements that are very street include body piercing, tattoos, unfinished clothes and cool contrasts.

 Their hair styling, says Abhishek, is also very individualist. Shocking streaks in red, purple or blonde, spikes or long hair tied back in a ponytail, everything is in for them. 

 Funky hairstyles apart, street dressers are also quite particular about their stubble and overall look.

 Basically, he doesnt believe in co-ordination. It is combining various elements from Oriental, American and desi designs and resulting in a shocking mix-and-match, adds Abhishek.

 Must haves

 The wardrobe of a street dresser covers a wide spectrum of designs. 

 Here is Abhisheks recommended list of musts.

 Denim jackets

 Biker leather jackets

 Torn and faded denims

 Sneakers in red canvas or leather

 Leather bracelets with spikes

 Chunky dog chains for the neck and wrists

 An entire collection of funky belts, buckles 

being the prime focus

 Baggy pants and jeans

 Tighter tees with funky graphics or graffiti

 Sporty, chunky watches

 Sling or cross-over bags

 Knitted skull caps, golf caps and baseball 

caps

 Night glasses and sunglasses, oversized of 

course

 Shop stops 

 These men, like their women counterparts, can be often spotted on the streets, raiding some of their pet stalls. 

 Other than famous shopping streets across the country, they are happy snooping around little outlets that sell designer rip-offs. 

 Obsessed with fake foreign brands, they love shopping for something new. 

 They find solace at the flea markets; in Calcutta they frequent Lindsay Street, Gariahat, Fancy Market and the like.

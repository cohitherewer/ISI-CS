 The civic authorities have decided to ban dumping of flowers and leaves in the Hooghly during immersion of idols in the upcoming festive season.

 Cages will be placed at all 20 ghats, between Cossipore and Garden Reach, for Puja organisers to dump flowers and leaves. Civic employees will later collect the waste and dump it elsewhere.

 Leaves and flowers pollute the water more than the bamboo-straw frames of the idols or the paint applied on them.

 Following a discussion with the state pollution control board, we had experimentally installed cages at two ghats, Nimtala and Baje Kadamtala, last year and the response had been encouraging. This year, we plan to instal cages at all the ghats where immersion is allowed, municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay said on Thursday.

 Last year, more than 90 truckloads of flowers and leaves were removed from the cages at the two ghats. As many as 2,300 images were immersed in the Hooghly.

 The executive engineers of seven boroughs have been assigned the task of erecting the cages. We have a meeting with the Calcutta Municipal Corporation next week. The cages will be erected by the civic authorities. There is a standing order of the green bench of Calcutta High Court to prevent pollution of the Hooghly, said state pollution control board chairman Sudip Bandopadhyay.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Life

 European aura amp; jewel art

 Showing for the first time in Calcutta at the Stylefile Winter Show 2006 to be held at ITC Sonar Bangla Sheraton amp; Towers on Saturday evening, Delhi-based young designer Gaurav Gupta will present a collection that combines ancient European cultures with modern lifestyles.

 A part of the line presents saris with sculptural drapes with an Indo-Grecian look. The drapes of the saris are unique drawing from Greek sculptures, Gaurav tells GoodLife from Delhi.

 The look is very sophisticated and elegant, not at all over the top, he adds.

 Dresses dominate the line, too, and here Gaurav draws from the art nouveau movement of late 19th century Europe. A lot of beautiful flowers find a place in the collection in various forms.

 Georgettes, jerseys and different kinds of silks shape the garments. The colour palette is muted lots of beige, white, blacks and greys, with dashes of antique pink and rose.

 The other highlights of the line are conceptual pattern cutting and attention to detail.

 While this is the first time Gaurav will unveil his designs on the Calcutta ramp, the designer already retails in a small way from Espee on Shakespeare Sarani. 

 I am looking at other retail 

 options in Calcutta, including 85 Lansdowne, he signs 

 off.

 My aim is to promote the concept 

 of art in jewellery and create a collection 

 of important jewels that are showcased as works of art. 

 Jewellery has been seen as an accessory for far too long 

 says couture jeweller Raj Mahtani.

 Thats precisely the idea 

 the designer will push through his collection at the Stylefile 

 Winter Show 2006 to be held at ITC Sonar Bangla Sheraton 

 amp; Towers on Saturday evening, with The Telegraph as 

 the media partner.

 Rajs winter line is titled Boho Princess Meets Mughal 

 Chic. The look is old-world, but with a modern flair and 

 vintage grand is the keyword.

 The line is very baroque or modern with a strong 

 Mughal sensibility. The inspiration came from the flower 

 and I have interpreted it in a larger-than-life manner. 

 It comprises pieces that can be worn with a simple evening 

 gown or a plain chiffon sari, says the celeb jeweller.

 The over all feeling is that of a young, innocent, 

 modern-day princess bedecked in jewels a soft, romantic 

 colour palette created by lots of pearls and pastel hues, 

 adds Raj.

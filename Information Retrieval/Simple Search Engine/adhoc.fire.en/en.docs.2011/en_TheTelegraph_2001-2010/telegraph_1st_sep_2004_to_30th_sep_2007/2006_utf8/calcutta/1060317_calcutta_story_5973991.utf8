 What: 

 Launch of New Look World of Titan. When: Thursday 

 afternoon.

 Where: 12/1B, Lindsay Street.

 Take a look: The revamped state-of-the-art Titan showroom on Lindsay Street boasts a sleek, minimalist look that goes down well with todays fuss-free buyer. Neat ambience, easy racks displaying designs at eye level and value addition in the form of specially trained frontline executives to help the customer make a better choice are highlights of the design store.

 so on offer is the Mutthi Bhar Khazana scheme that entitles customers to a discount through a lucky draw of coins from a matka. The denomination the customer picks from this draw ends up as the discount amount.

 The Titan Wall Street collection was also unveiled on the occasion. This all-new line endorsed by brand ambassador Aamir Khan, is all about redefining work code. 

 It features around 100 designs mostly in steel with a few bi-metal variants. Priced between Rs 1,500 and Rs 4,000, this corporate collection is sure worth a look and more. 

 Voiceover: The idea behind revamping all the Titan showrooms is to lend a contemporary look and feel to the brand. The newly designed, colourful retail stores will also help in establishing individual brand equity to all the sub-brands such as Sonata, Nebula, Fastrack, Raaga and the like, says Sandeep Kulhalli, business head, retail services group of Titan.

Life

 Fight right on the floors

 Midnight 

 Manners

 A lingering gaze exchanged with 

 an ex, lasting a second longer than it should 

 have. Result? Ugly fight.

 Revisiting an old college spat, 

 five drinks down. Result? Ugly fight.

 A nightclub so often sets the 

 scene for exciting action sequences. Not the bump-and-grind 

 sort of action on the busy dance floors. Not the curse-and-cry 

 kind of action while waiting for drinks to be served.

 Lets dwell on the far more 

 riveting sort of action: furiously fighting couples, shouting 

 out loud to drown the decibels, or boys being boys, with 

 beer ? or more ? in the belly.

 Sample these: I cant believe 

 you were staring at him/her like that? What was the need 

 to take his/her number? Why was he/she leaning so close 

 to you?

 The big fight among boys normally 

 erupts over the smallest of things.

 Sample these: Why the **** did 

 you push me? Why the **** did you stamp on my toe? 

 Fights are fun, depending of course 

 which side youre on ? good as spectator, bad as participant 

 (who wants to be in the hot gossip seat the morning after?), 

 and ugly at the receiving end (who wants face and ego bruised?).

 GoodLife lays down the 

 fighting rules at nightclubs.

 Do

 Pause for a moment to think things 

 over. It takes one second to rush into a fight, but is it 

 fight-worthy at all? Says Sovan Mukherjee, manager of hookah 

 bar Shisha: After a few drinks, what would otherwise 

 be trivial suddenly seems a big thing. So, when someone 

 rubs you the wrong way, literally or otherwise, dont 

 start shouting and screaming at once. Take a deep breath 

 ? count till 10 (if you still can, that is) ? and ask yourself 

 if its really such a big deal.

 Prove your point, but politely. 

 Girlfriend, boyfriend or business rival, be firm but gentle. 

 Often, a few strong words softly spoken can diffuse the 

 tension without making you feel like less of a man.

 If you feel your anger-meter skyrocketing, 

 step out of the nightclub. Other than running the risk of 

 being asked to leave, losing your cool can also 

 earn you a troublemaker tag. Leave the club and go 

 for a walk or a drive, advises Amit Hathiramani from 

 Underground. 

 Get help if you cant get 

 your point across (assuming, the issue in question is not 

 too private, of course). The success rate of a member 

 of the nightclub management team intervening is indeed quite 

 high. A third-persons view is mostly objective and 

 so the problem is easier to sort, all so that the party 

 can go on, says Sovan.

 Amit sees a definite role for 

 friends in stopping a fight: They can always calm 

 the protagonists down and help let off steam to avoid a 

 showdown.

 Dont

 Abuse. Hurling gaalis in 

 a public place is so not cool.

 Lose your cool. Everyone around 

 you is there to just chill. So dont play spoilsport.

 Get personal. People who 

 fight one night are mostly back together the next, 

 says Sovan. So dont badmouth a friend/acquaintance 

 in the heat of the moment. Tomorrow, you might forget what 

 you said, but the world around you will not. So keep personal 

 things personal. Always.

 Get physical. Everything can be 

 sorted out verbally. If a fight takes place, a guests 

 entry is banned, says Sovan.

 Leave the premises alone in the 

 dead of the night ? this one is for angry girlfriends. However 

 peeved you might be, stupidity is never the solution. If 

 going home with your man is too much to ask for after a 

 public spat, be safe ? and sane ? enough to get a friend 

 to drop you home.

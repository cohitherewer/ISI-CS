 Poster weapon to fight rail crime

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 To fight a spurt in crime in rail compartments and stations, the Howrah Government Railway Police (GRP) is banking on passenger awareness.

 At a recent high-level meeting, the GRP brass and railway officials concurred on the need to spread awareness among the masses to curb criminal activity. A course of action to that end has been charted in the meeting, a GRP officer disclosed.

 ?We have to make people aware of the precautions they can take while on the train or waiting in the platform. Otherwise, it will be impossible to check rail crime,? opined a senior Howrah GRP officer.

 He added that posters would be put up inside train compartments and stations, informing people about the dos and don?ts during a journey. The railways will collaborate with the GRP on the awareness project.

 Besides, regular announcements will be made at the stations to alert passengers about crime on the tracks.

 ?Apart from snatchers, the biggest threat is posed by those who rob travellers by feeding them laced snacks,? said another GRP officer.

 The posters inside compartments will warn passengers against sharing food, being careless with belongings and touching unclaimed articles, like bags, packets or toys.

 According to the GRP, at least 30 cases of looting by offering food mixed with sedatives were registered in Howrah and 12 neighbouring sub-divisions of the GRP in the past year. 

 There might be a number of rackets involved in such crimes in Calcutta, Howrah, North and South 24-Parganas and other parts of Bengal, said a GRP officer. 

 ?The criminals mainly target people travelling alone and operate in small groups. In some cases, women were also used. They travel by tickets reserved under false names and addresses, making it difficult for the police to track them down,? he added.

 ?This type of crime is increasing and we want to arrest the trend. If people are not aware and alert, it is almost impossible for us to do anything. We only have around 1,200 constables and some 80 sub-inspector-level officers. Providing security to individual passengers is out of the question,? the GRP officer explained.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 I wish to highlight the stepmotherly attitude of CESC towards the Survey Park 

area of Santoshpur, barring the Gujarat Ambuja complex. Almost every other day, 

residents here have to face long hours of power failure, which is also adversely 

affecting the studies of the children. On March 14, supply was disrupted in the 

morning, as well as from 4.30 pm to 9.30 pm. The CESC control room at Jadavpur 

has employed a few men on the help desk to receive our phonecalls and complaints. 

However, they are totally confused regarding the cause of the powercuts and often 

forward excuses like ?high-tension fault? and ?phase default? in a matter of minutes 

without even probing into the details. Since the problem is a recurrent one, CESC 

should immediately take corrective measures before the peak summer months.

 With more and more people using the local train services, the number of ticket 

booking counters, especially at stations like Howrah and Sealdah, should be increased 

to avoid chaos and delay. During peak hours when every minute is precious, office-goers 

and students have to wait for a long time in queues. And to avoid this delay, 

many passengers board the local trains without purchasing tickets. The railway 

authorities should open more booking counters at these stations to manage the 

rush during peak hours.

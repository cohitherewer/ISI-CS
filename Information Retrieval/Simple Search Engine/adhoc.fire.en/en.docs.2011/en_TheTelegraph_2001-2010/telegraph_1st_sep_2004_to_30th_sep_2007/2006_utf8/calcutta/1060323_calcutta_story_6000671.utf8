 - Meet kicks off national-level pilot project on Nor?westers

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Hardly a year goes by without severe afternoon thunderstorms, called kalbaisakhis, or Nor?westers, lashing the eastern Gangetic plains. 

 These sudden, potentially-destructive storms, common around this time of the year, require special observation systems.

 In a pioneering endeavour to understand Nor?westers better, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur and Centre of Excellence in Ocean, River, Atmosphere and Land Sciences (CORAL) hosted a two-day meet on STORM Programme Implementation.

 IIT Kharagpur director Shishir K. Dube said: ?No field study has been organised since Independence to study Nor?westers. The atmospheric science community in India has been planning to launch a campaign to understand and predict Nor?westers. In the process, they hope to put in place a system of preventing large-scale loss of life and destruction of property.? 

 The programme advisory committee of the department of science and technology has approved implementation of ?Severe Thunderstorms: Observation and Regional Modelling? (STORM), a multi-disciplinary, nationally-coordinated research and development effort. It will be pursued as an observation-cum-modelling campaign from 2007 to 2009.

 ?A pilot campaign is being launched in the pre-monsoon season of 2006, which should help in the implementation of the programme,? said Dube.

 The purpose of the meet was to finalise the implementation strategy and kickstart the pilot phase of the STORM programme. ?The objectives of the programme are designing a coordinated plan for monitoring the life-cycle of a Nor?wester over the region and formulating ideas and collecting data to share with universities and other academic institutions,? added Dube.

 On the sidelines of the STORM meet, Dube confirmed IIT plans to set up a state-of-the-art medical college, including a 400-bed hospital, on their campus. 

 The Telegraph had reported on Wednesday how IIT would be the first technical institute in India to do so.

 While the hospital should be operational by 2008, the target date for the medical college is 2009.

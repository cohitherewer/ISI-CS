The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 I am not available for hire

 VISHAL DADLANI of the Vishal-Shekhar duo tells Pratim D. Gupta about replacing Rahman in Om Shanti Om, scoring Abhisheks album and singing for Dhoom 2

 Vishal Dadlani

 Uday Chopra and 

 Bipasha Basu in Dhoom 2, whose title song has 

 been sung by Vishal; (below) Abhishek Bachchan is singing 

 six songs for his first private albumVishal Dadlani 

 Om Shanti Om came to you from nowhere

 Pretty much. We knew that A.R. Rahman was doing the music. Then we get this call from Farah Khan and she says, You guys are doing my film. Out of sheer respect for Rahman, we never asked Farah any questions. All we know is that we have to rock this music.

 Rahman was fighting for his publishing rights and 

 that lost him the film. Do you feel its right for a composer 

 to ask for a share of the album profits?

 I think its very valid. Rahman is in a position to demand such rights. Having Rahman as the music director of your film is a big plus for any movie. And he is right in standing up for the rights of a composer. I am sure this is something which will eventually happen for all of us. In India there is no proper demarcation and rules regarding rights between publisher, producer and composer. Nowhere in the world will you find a public performing licensing agency like in India. Rahman has taken the first step. But we are still new to the music business and doing a film with Shah Rukh and Farah is huge for us.

 You have reportedly scored all the songs for the 

 film in 10 days flat

 No, no (laughs). We have composed four, which have been sanctioned by Farah. Even the fifth is almost complete. We have to do a total of seven songs. We are really excited. This will easily be our proudest work. The melodies seem to be dropping out of the sky for us!

 What is the overall mood of the score?

 The mood is essentially defined by the story, which is something we are contractually not allowed to speak about. 

 Did you meet Shah Rukh before signing the film?

 He wanted to meet us to let us be comfortable and tell us what exactly we need to do. He is so well informed yet so chilled out. It was a revelation... We had detailed discussions with Farah regarding the scope of the music and the sound design. Its just been 10 days, man, from the time she called us!

 Farah did tell us that the film would span three 

 to four decades. Will that be reflected in the music?

 The sound rather than the music will follow that path. The script is the mother here and we are learning more and more as we go along. Javed Akhtars words are also very important for us.

 Jhankaar Beats and Bluffmaster! notwithstanding, 

 Om Shanti Om must be your biggest project

 Alongside Ta Ra Rum Pum, our second film with Yash Raj and Siddharth Anand after Salaam Namaste. With Saif (Ali Khan) and Rani (Mukherjee), it is really big. Its not a comedy, its not a romance. In many ways its a family film. In many ways its an action film. Ta Ra Rum Pum is a real progression for us as music directors.

 And how did you get to sing the title track of Dhoom 

 2?

 I just got lucky (laughs)! I have always sung for Pentagram (the band he sings for) and also a few of our film songs. Coming from a rock band space, the de-linking among different aspects of singing doesnt happen. I take the guitar in my hands, close my eyes and start singing. I dont write lyrics, I compose with new words. Its part of the same process.

 But why would other music directors hire you?

 I am not available for hire. I sing for my friends, I sing for myself. I am not doing it for any commercial consideration. There isnt money in this world. Dhoom 2 music director Pritam is a damn good buddy. I have also sung for Shankar Ehsaan Loy in Jhoom Barabar Jhoom. Shankars sung for me. We are really close friends. We are all part of the same movement to produce good music.

 Is Himesh Reshammiya a part of this movement?

 See, Himesh Reshammiya has got a large acceptance among his audience. And it is stupid for anybody to second-guess the public because they now have a clear idea of everything. I may personally not run out and buy his album but the public loves him. And as I said I am not one of those who feel that the same person cant sing, score and write.

 What is the status of your private album with Abhishek 

 Bachchan?

 It is happening. Slowly but surely. There will be six songs and I can assure you all of them will be kickass. Abhishek will sing all the six tracks with guest singers and producers. Sunidhi (Chauhan) will also feature in a big way.

 Your album with Pentagram is long overdue, too

 It should come out soon. There will be 16 songs and it surely take Indian rock music to a new platform. It is being recorded by the person who has recorded the albums of Gorillaz and Black Eyed Peas.

 And what is the updated list of your film assignments?

 Apart from Om Shanti Om and Tara Rum Pum, we have Ravi Chopras Bhootnath, Anubhav Sinhas Cash, Reema Kagtis Honeymoon Travels Pvt Ltd and Sujoy Ghoshs Aladdin.

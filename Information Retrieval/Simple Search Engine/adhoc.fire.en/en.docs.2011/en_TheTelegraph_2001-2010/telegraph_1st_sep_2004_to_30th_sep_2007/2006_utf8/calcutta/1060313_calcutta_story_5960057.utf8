 Cop to cop: let Maidan couples be

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Neither snatchers, nor goons. Couples out for an evening in solitude on the Maidan are now falling prey to rogue cops from nearby police stations. 

 Embarrassed by the over half-a-dozen cases of harassment of lovers visiting the greens recently, top bosses of Calcutta Police have issued a warning to the guilty cops to mind their own business or face suspension.

 Quite a few times, officials from Maidan police station, while patrolling the area, have caught their counterparts from other thanas threatening and extorting money from couples who have committed no crime.

 Though the guilty cops were let off with a mild warning, senior officers have reacted sharply to the incidents.

 ?Don?t harass couples. And if you have no official business, do not try to enter the Maidan area. If we receive any complaint of harassment, you will be in trouble and may even be served a suspension notice,? deputy commissioner of police, headquarters, Anuj Sharma has told cops at police stations under the scanner.

 An officer of Maidan police station elaborated how the rogue cops went about making a fast buck. ?After duty, officers from of police stations like Park Street, Hastings, Hare Street and Taltala saunter around the Maidan in plain clothes. They threaten to book couples for misconduct even though they may have been exchanging sweet nothings. They then demand anything between Rs 20 and 100 to let them off.? 

 Another officer added: ?Most of the times, the person harassing the couples turns out to be a colleague from a nearby police station. We do not inform the superiors, but warn him not to enter areas under our jurisdiction.?

 Police say at least 500 couples visit the open space opposite Victoria Memorial every day and spend several hours there. Four policemen on bicycles and one on a motorcycle from Maidan police station are assigned to patrol the area.

 ?Incidents of snatching used to be reported almost every alternate day from this area. Though crime is under control now, we have policemen extorting money,? said the officer.

 A senior officer at the Lalbazar police headquarters, however, said that apart from cops of the Maidan thana, sleuths from the detective department, including officers from the anti-rowdy squad and the burglary and dacoity section have the right to patrol the greens.

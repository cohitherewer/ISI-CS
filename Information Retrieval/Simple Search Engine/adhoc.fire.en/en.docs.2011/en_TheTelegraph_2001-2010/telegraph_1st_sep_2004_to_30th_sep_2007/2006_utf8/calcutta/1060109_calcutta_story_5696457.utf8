 True Tagore, minus add-ons

 - SINGING SIBLINGS LET LYRICS AND MELODY RULE IN RABINDRASANGEET

 How important are accompaniments in Rabindrasangeet? Not much, say Manoj and Manisha Murali Nair, who have been singing Tagore with little or no supporting instruments in their albums and cutting a lone furrow in a field where heavy arrangements have become a norm. 

 The siblings are children of Kalamandalam Murali, a kathakali guru at Visva-Bharati. Says 26-year-old Manisha, whose latest album, sung to just a sitar, will be released at a concert on Tuesday at Madhusudan Mancha: ?Tagore?s lyrics and melody are so strong that one does not need add-ons. The bare minimum needed to express the essence of the song is enough.? 

 Agrees elder brother Manoj: ?For me, the value of music is in the way it calms the soul. That soothing quality is robbed by heavy arrangements.? 

 The duo migrated to Santiniketan in childhood and was brought up there. ?At Sangeet Bhavan, we would sing to the tanpura, while esraj was used for programmes. The emphasis on melody is part of our training.? 

 The two have produced albums without any accompaniments whatsoever, a challenge few singers are willing to take. Another project undertaken with success is with V. Balsara. A few months before he passed away, the veteran musician was already quite ill. ?He played the piano and we sang. It was like a live concert. There was no scope for retakes,? Manoj recalls. 

 In a scenario where rhythm and rage rule on stage, courtesy band music, the two are aware of the challenge they face ? singing Rabindrasangeet, that too with little to perk it up. ?When we started out in Calcutta, we were warned that we would not be able to survive with just Tagore in our kitty. But our happiest moments are when we go to college programmes and receive requests for raga-based Rabindrasangeet,? says Manisha, adding that they consciously attempt to connect to the crowd. ?The atmosphere has to be lightened so that students do not feel alienated, but the performance itself has to stay undiluted.? So when they speak in between songs, the message is music-related. Manoj, who has done his Master?s in classical music, briefly sings the alaap of a raga if the song to follow is based on it. 

 The two are soaked in Santiniketan and their roots draw only from Rabindrasangeet. ?Our Malayalam is so halted that often we are left searching for words. Our parents get upset and grudgingly allow us to complete the conversation in Bengali,? Manisha laughs.

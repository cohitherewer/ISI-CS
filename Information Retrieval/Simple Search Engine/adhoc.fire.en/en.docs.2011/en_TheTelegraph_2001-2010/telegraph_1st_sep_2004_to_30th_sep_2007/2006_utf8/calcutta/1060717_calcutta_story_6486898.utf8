 Month on, arrest in killing case

 Arghya Dam: Murdered and dumped

 More than a month after 32-year-old Arghya Dam, a resident of Hidaram Banerjee Lane, in central Calcutta, was found murdered in a Hooghly village, the detective department on Sunday arrested a man for his alleged involvement in the crime.

 The accused, Deepak Das, was held in Basirhat, North 24-Parganas. A car cleaner by profession, he was allegedly present in the car that was hired to pick up Arghya from Foreshore Road, in Howrah, while he was with his wife-to-be.

 Police said Arghya was possibly strangled to death with an electric wire in the car. The wire was recovered from the roadside spot where the body was found.

 The youth went missing on June 10 and his body was spotted the next day. The death was, however, confirmed only two days ago, when his mother identified whatever remained of the corpse on the basis of the shirt and shoes on it.

 Officers suspect Arghya was murdered over a property dispute and that his brother-in-law Bappaditya Dey, now absconding, was the mastermind.

 ?Dey came to us quite a few times after we took up the case and provided us with information about the youth,? said Gyanwant Singh, deputy commissioner (detective department). ?But he went missing on June 14 and from the next day, we started receiving information that suggested Arghya had been murdered. Now, it seems Dey had played a key role in the crime.?

 The day Arghya?s body was found, his family received a call from an unidentified man, who demanded a ransom of Rs 2 lakh. Police believe Arghya was picked up from Foreshore Road, close to Hind Motor where Bappaditya lives, on June 10 afternoon. Besides Dey and Deepak Das, there were two others in the car. Once inside, Arghya was strangled to death and dumped off a road in Anantapur village, under Hooghly?s Dhaniakhali police station.

 Son of a former employee of a tea firm, Arghya worked at an grille-welding shop in north Calcutta for a monthly stipend of Rs 1,500. He lived with his mother in a rented house. The family owns a small house in Memari, Burdwan.

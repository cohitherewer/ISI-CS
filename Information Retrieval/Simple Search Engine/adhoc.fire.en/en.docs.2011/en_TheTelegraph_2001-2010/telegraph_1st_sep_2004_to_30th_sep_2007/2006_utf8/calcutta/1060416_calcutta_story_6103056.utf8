The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Sales pitch 

 for the polls

 Consumer mobilisation is the first 

 hurdle for a refrigerator to be sold or a vote to be won

 Shiloo Chattopadhyay

 It 

 is show time folks. It indeed is. A few days from now we 

 will be asked to indicate who we want as our local representative 

 in the legislative Assembly. The battle to win us over has 

 begun in right earnest. At the outset let me acknowledge 

 that I have no doubt in my mind that politics is serious 

 business and election is a critical milestone in the political 

 calendar. At stake is the welfare of millions. Cost of a 

 mistake may be enormous. Yet it is difficult to ignore the 

 similarity between electioneering for a political party 

 and marketing of a refrigerator or a washing machine.

 In both cases, choices are not 

 made frequently. Opportunity to correct a mistaken preference 

 does not exist. You have to live with the choice ? right 

 or wrong ? for quite a few years. Brand choices in both 

 arenas ? politics and consumer durables ? are usually affected 

 by opposing forces. On the one hand there is a certain comfort 

 about the brand of refrigerator that is currently being 

 used. Depending on the use experience, a degree of loyalty 

 to the brand develops. Concurrently there is a desire to 

 change that is often triggered by a completely irrational 

 but very real fatigue with the current brand. A feeling 

 of missing out creeps in, which is usually powered by an 

 inherent optimism about the brands that have not been used. 

 This is what in political jargon is called the anti-incumbency 

 factor. There is a big difference also. Durables are bought 

 right through the year and in all years. So marketing for 

 a durable is a continuous process. Elections on the other 

 hand are held once in five years and thus marketing to influence 

 the choice of the voter happens at discreet intervals. 

 Still, the similarities and arduousness 

 of the tasks in both these theatres of marketing are remarkable. 

 The first task is to get the consumer to buy or the voter 

 to act. The consumer always has the option of continuing 

 with his old TV, refrigerator or washing machine for some 

 more time. The voter also has the complete freedom of not 

 making that crucial trip to the polling station on election 

 day. So consumer mobilisation is the first hurdle to cross 

 for both and this is often handled collectively. The combined 

 instigation from all brands of washing machines through 

 their advertising actually accelerates the journey of the 

 consumer mind towards an eventual purchase.

 In the election arena a similar 

 synergy exists. The media usually fires the first salvo. 

 They create the hype about elections from their own parochial 

 requirements. Then the political parties take over the baton. 

 Their advertising on the walls, their banners on the streets 

 and their meetings in street corners all add up to create 

 saliency of elections in the voter mind. The result is fascinating: 

 an unconscious desire is built up to participate in the 

 ceremony. Not casting your ballot often results in a feeling 

 of deprivation. It is much like the pangs of guilt you feel 

 when you decide not to brave the crowds to see the thakur 

 on Ashtami evening.

 This is how it has been. Will 

 it be the same this year? The reason for raising the question 

 is the otherwise very laudable mandate from the Election 

 Commission. It has banned campaign messages on walls of 

 buildings. Calcutta is looking very different from what 

 it did on the eve of earlier elections. True, alternative 

 media has been created. From umbrellas to T-shirts, clay 

 lions to an army of bicycle campaigners, efforts have been 

 numerous. Even then, I am sure many will agree that the 

 usual pre-election festival spirit is yet to come to Calcutta. 

 And there is just one more Sunday left between today and 

 D-day.

 In 2004, when we in West Bengal 

 were last asked to vote, a high majority had obliged. With 

 the Ashtami ambience missing, will we brave the heat this 

 time? We will have to wait for a month for the answer.

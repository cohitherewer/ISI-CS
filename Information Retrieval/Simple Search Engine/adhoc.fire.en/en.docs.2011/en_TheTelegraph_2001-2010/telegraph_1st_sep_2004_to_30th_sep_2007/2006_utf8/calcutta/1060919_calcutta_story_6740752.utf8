 Upswing in mall footfall

 ZEESHAN JAWED AND SMITA MEHTA 

 FESTIVE FEVER: Customers are realising that shopping under one roof can be comfortable and hassle-free. Little wonder then that with the Puja ahead, theres a scramble to reach the mega marts. Picture by Sanat Kumar Sinha

 Around 38,000 people trooped into the two Pantaloons outlets, the turnout crossed 45,000 at Forum, on Elgin Road, and Citi Mart, the Bidhan Sarani poor cousin of the mega malls, recorded a footfall of 15,000-odd over the past weekend.

 With just 10 days to go for the Pujas, festive shopping peaked over the weekend.

 The Puja gives us a chance to assess our performance. We know where we stand three years after our debut here, said Naveen Mishra, head of operations, Shoppers Stop at Forum, after a successful weekend.

 Footfall registered a 20 to 25 per cent rise in comparison with the pre-Puja turnout in 2005. The Pantaloons stores, on Camac Street and Gariahat Road, also saw a higher turnout, by around 15 per cent. 

 The upward trend in mall footfall indicates something beyond consumption power. We have been witnessing a gradual tilt towards brands for the past two-three years. This year, the change is visible. Brand is now more important than budget, observed Arun Baptist, stores manager, Pantaloons, on Camac Street, which stocks a diverse range of premium brands.

 Also, most Puja shoppers are revealing their preference for malls over standalone stores at traditional shopping destinations like Hatibagan and Gariahat.

 Citi Mart, which sells lesser-known brands, is a classic example of the appeal of the malls. The Bidhan Sarani address is drawing around 8,000 people every day, while some of the nearby stores are lying empty.

 People are realising that shopping under one roof is comfortable and hassle-free, explained Mishra.

 Kuldip Khaitans experience sums it up. He has been running a sari shop, Shagun Saris, on CR Avenue for years. In 2004, he chose to set up a high-end mall on Shakespeare Sarani and the decision is paying him dividends.

 People were initially hesitant to visit our mall. But 50 per cent of our customers have switched to it, pointed out Khaitan. 

 Is it just comfort thats drawing consumers to malls? 

 Somnath Saha, manager, Benarasi Kuthi, on Rashbehari Avenue, talks about the aspiration factor. The new-generation women want to imitate Rani Mukherjee or Preity Zinta These clients are drifting towards big-brand outlets.

 But some standalone stores, able to adapt with the changing times, are still doing brisk business. 

 Their USP: weaving diverse product baskets with personalised attention to customers.

 People still come to us because we provide that personal touch It is difficult for big outlets to do that, said Sanjay Saha, owner, Adi Dhakeswari Bastralaya, in Gariahat.

 There is also an element of uniqueness in products that standalone stores offer.

 Saris are not branded, rather the shops have a brand value. We dont need to advertise that much and word-of-mouth publicity works, for which we just have to satisfy our customers by giving them the best item at the right price, signed off Khaitan.

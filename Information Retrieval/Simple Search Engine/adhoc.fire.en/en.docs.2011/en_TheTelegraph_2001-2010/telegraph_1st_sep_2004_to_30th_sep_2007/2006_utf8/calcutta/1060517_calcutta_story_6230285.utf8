 Globalisation and information technology have had an impact on cultural dialogue as never before, redefining the erstwhile nuances of culture, identity, race and political border-lines. Opening up the world on one hand, they have, on the other, subjected humanity to fresh doubts, insecurities and insurgencies. New Works, the ongoing exhibition of recent paintings by Sumitro Basak, Kingshuk Sarkar, Reshmi Sarkar (one of her works appears here) and Dr Shreyashi Chatterjee, is the sum total of this new experience by this group of new generation artists of Kala Bhavan, Santiniketan. Essentially reflecting the creative response of each artist to his or her own environment, the show attempts to depict a semblance of unity within the constraints of acute diversity and fragmentation of the real world. Bearing traces of non-Western, post-modern ideas and influences, it presents a bold, profound and inspiring body of work in a fresh visual language that is spontaneous, witty, sensitive and contextual to the current economic, political and cultural milieu.

 Event: An exhibition of recent works by a group of four artists

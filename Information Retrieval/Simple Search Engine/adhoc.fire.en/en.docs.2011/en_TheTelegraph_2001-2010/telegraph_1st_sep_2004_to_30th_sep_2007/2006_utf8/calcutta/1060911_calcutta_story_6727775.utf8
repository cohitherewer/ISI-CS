The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Landfill link to flooded roads

 Town Planning

 Dipankar Sinha, director-general (town 

 planning) of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, met readers 

 of The Telegraph and answered their queries. Participants 

 included Sarmistha Lahiri, Bidyut Banerjee, Lalit Singh 

 Nahar, Shankar Ghosh, Talat Salahuddin, Tithi Chakroborty, 

 Chanchal Sarkar and Arka Sen

 Sarmistha Lahiri: Local promoters 

 and land-grabbers are filling up the wetlands on the citys 

 fringes and minting money. A few decades ago, the state 

 government and its agencies had similarly filled up the 

 wetlands in the city. Rabindra Sadan, Nandan, Rotary Sadan, 

 Jawaharlal Nehru Childrens Museum, Bhasha Bhavan of National 

 Library, were all constructed by filling up waterbodies 

 and wetlands. Do you agree that this has been an organised 

 assault on the waterbodies and the government is responsible 

 for the present-day waterlogging problems in the city after 

 each heavy shower? 

 It is true that a few decades 

 ago, a number of waterbodies in the Park Street, Lindsay 

 Street and AJC Bose Road area were filled to construct buildings. 

 And it is also a fact that waterbodies act as bowls to hold 

 the excessive water after heavy downpours.

 But that does not mean the government 

 does not want to conserve the waterbodies. Actually, at 

 that time (a few decades back), the government was not aware 

 of the utility and role of waterbodies in our environment. 

 Even the legal provisions then did not forbid filling up 

 of wetlands. Rather, a few legal provisions encouraged the 

 filling up of excessive wetlands to make space.

 Bidyut Banerjee: Can you elaborate 

 on how some of the legal provisions encourage filling up 

 of wetlands and ponds? 

 Take the example of the West Bengal 

 Town and Country Planning and Development Act, 1979. It 

 allowed change of land use with permission and there was 

 no separate provision for the waterbodies. 

 Also, the CMC Act, 1980, said 

 that if a waterbody breeds mosquitoes, it can be either 

 cleaned or filled up.

 It was for the first time in the 

 late 1990s that the CMDA, in its Land Use and Development 

 Control Plan (LUDCP), imposed a ban on the filling up of 

 ponds and wetlands. 

 In the Fisheries Act, 1984, there 

 is a ban on the filling up of waterbodies which are spread 

 over more than five cottahs.

 Also in the CMC Act, 1980, it 

 has been mentioned that its provisions will not supersede 

 the provisions contained in any other Act. 

 Hence, filling up of waterbodies 

 by the government or any of its agencies is not possible 

 now.

 I would like to point out that 

 it was due to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) Act 

 that Indian Museums attempt to fill up the Jinjira Talao 

 in their backyard was prevented.

 Bidyut Banerjee: Do you think 

 your Calcutta Panorama in the Town Hall has aptly showcased 

 the 300 years of socio-economic and cultural heritage of 

 Sutanuti, Kali Kota and Gobindapur?

 I want to point out the history 

 of Calcutta is over 300 years. It is obvious that there 

 were settlers in Gobindapur, Sutanuti and Kali Kota before 

 the arrival of Job Charnock. Hence, the socio-economic and 

 cultural history of this area is much older than 300 years. 

 Besides, there is no cut-off date of when the urbanisation 

 of the area started. 

 However, in the Town Hall, we 

 have only 10,000 sq ft to showcase the citys history. We 

 have tried to present the momentum of history in a different 

 manner. A museum is not built overnight. It grows gradually 

 by enriching its treasures. 

 Do you have a copy of the 

 original settlement deed of the Sabarna Roy Chowdhurys in 

 the city museum at the Town Hall?

 No, we dont have it at this moment. 

 We have it in the CMC headquarters.

 Lalit Singh Nahar: For how 

 many people are you are drawing up the town plan? 

 According to our estimates, Calcuttas 

 night population is around 55 lakh. Another 45 lakh people 

 enter the city daily from its fringes on week days. The 

 town plan will cover every one linked to the city. 

 Bidyut Banerjee: Earlier, 

 the stretch from Elgin Road to Park Street had beautiful 

 bungalows dating back to Raj. Why have you destroyed this 

 beautiful landscape by introducing the Land Ceiling Act?

 A city changes with time. The 

 land use pattern in Calcutta started changing from the mid-1970s. 

 Housing is now a vendible commodity. As commercial utilisation 

 of land is the main principle of these schemes, the gardens 

 and the beautiful terraces were dropped from the housing 

 plans.

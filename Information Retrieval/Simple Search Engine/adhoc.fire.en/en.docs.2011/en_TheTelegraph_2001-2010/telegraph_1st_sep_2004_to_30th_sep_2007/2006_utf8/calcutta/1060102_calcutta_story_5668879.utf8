The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Life

 Blast-off into brand new

 THE PARK 

 What: Kajra De Kajra Le night in association with The Telegraph.

 Where: The Park Banquets.

 The party: The main draw was the dancing duo from Mumbai. The two took the makeshift stage just before the turn of the year. The first sequence comprised yesterdays hits like Dum maro dum, Aaj ki raat and Mehbooba. But the new year began with todays tracks Ho jata hai kaise pyar, Kya khoob lagti ho, Deedar de? The curtains had to come down with the biggest hit of the year gone by. And Kajra re quite clearly drew the loudest cheers ? surprisingly, more from the women on their night out ? as the dancers raised the December temperature. The one thing the twosome could not be accused of was too much cloth cover and the one thing that really got the crowds going was the way they moved. 

 Though we are sold out, there are people still walking into the hotel to gain entry, said a hotel spokesperson.

 HHI 

 What: The Ultimate Blast in association with The Telegraph. 

 Where: Hotel Hindusthan International.

 The party: The entire poolside was turned into an Egyptian village with a Cleopatras barge on the pool serving as the bar. The attendants were dressed up like Pharaohs.

 The food counters included Chinese, Continental, Awadhi and Amritsari, but the Biryani corner was the busiest. A local orchestra kept churning out tracks from the latest Bollywood blockbusters and kept the crowd on the dance floor. Elaborate fireworks began when the clock struck 12 and everyone moved to the dance floor. The top tracks were Woh lamhey, Dus bahane and Nach baliye. 

 There are more than 800 people at this party. The good food and heady cocktails are the biggest attractions, said a hotel spokesperson.

 THE OBEROI GRAND 

 What: The Poolside Party in association with The Telegraph.

 Where: The Oberoi Grand Poolside.

 The party: The sit-down party started at 9.30 in the evening. The idea was to give the people some privacy while they eat and drink on the last night of the year. So we planned the set-up in such a way that despite 120 people being around, one would be able to enjoy with their own group, said a spokesperson for the hotel.

 The Poolside decoration was woven around an Oasis theme with scattered little canopies. The attendants were dressed up as Pharaohs passing around hookahs and serving premium liquor brands.

 To drive away the chill, there were little sigris lit up and placed around the Poolside. The huge buffet spread consisted of live tandoor, plus an Indian, Oriental and Continental spread.Crooner Sonia Sehgal kept the mood going with tracks like Every Breath You Take, My Heart Will Go On and Sacrifice.

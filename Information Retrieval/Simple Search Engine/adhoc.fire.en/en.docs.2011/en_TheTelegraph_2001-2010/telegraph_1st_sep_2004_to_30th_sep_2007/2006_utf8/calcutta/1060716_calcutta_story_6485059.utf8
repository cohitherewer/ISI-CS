 Claim to femme fame

 Take four female vocalists from regular city bands, add a sprinkling of veteran musicians, and voila, a new supergroup with a fresh sound is ready to rock.

 Rila, Arunima, Anita and Tanya got together as Fame to rock Someplace Else on Saturday night. Each of the ladies fronts a band on her own ? Plan B, Saturday Night Blues, Span and Crystal Grass, respectively ? but the chance of an all-girl night out was too good to pass up.

 ?We all play at Someplace Else and interact with each other regularly. We thought why not take that forward,? says Arunima, who approached the others with the idea a few months back. A couple of jam sessions later, Fame was born.

 ?The name came about in a strange way. Initially we thought of calling the band Tara combining each of our initials, but during rehearsals everyone fell in love with the song Fame and we just decided to name ourselves that,? recalled Rila, the seniormost in the group.

 Backing up the band in its maiden venture are friends and musicians Sumith Ramachandran, Jeffrey Rikh, Jayanta Dasgupta, Stuart Munro and Dominic Saldanha.

 The sound is a mix of the styles sported by each of the singers. ?I sing blues, Rila sings country rock, Anita?s into jazz and Tanya sings almost everything. So there is a lot of variety,? explains Arunima. 

 ?We are trying to bring in our individual styles and it?s great fun to do our own stuff,? offers Tanya, the youngest of the lot at 19. The accountancy honours student of City College is really excited to share stage space with ?these great singers?.

 ?It?s a great opportunity since we?ve never sung together. I can approach the Oriental songs, something I can?t do with Span,? says Anita who grew up in France and often sings in French.

 It?s mostly covers for now for the band, ?from the really old to the really new?. 

 Artistes span from Earth Wind amp; Fire to Aretha Franklin, and Bee Gees to Joss Stone. The only original on the songlist is a Rila composition called Fragile Intentions.

 And then there?s the classic track from the 1980 film of the same name, Fame.

 Rehearsals have been on for a month and the vibe is fantastic, agree all.

 ?People can?t seem to get over the fact that there are four women on stage and they?re all singing together, without tearing each other?s hair out,? laughs Rila.

 Though the band is desperately hoping that the SPE outing at The Park is not a one-off affair and would love to perform in other cities, the ladies prefer to take one step at a time.

 ?Let?s see where it goes from here,? Rila sums up the mood.

 But for now, it?s go girl power, go.

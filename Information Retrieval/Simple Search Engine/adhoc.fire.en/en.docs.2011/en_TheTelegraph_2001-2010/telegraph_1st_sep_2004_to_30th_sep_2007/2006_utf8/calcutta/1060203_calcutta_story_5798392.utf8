 Cops hunt for clues

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The police and family members are in the dark about the fate of 45-year-old timber trader Raj Kumar Seksaria, who went missing on Monday.

 ?The situation is the same as it was on the day of his disappearance,? said Raj?s brother Mohanlal. Superintendent of North 24-Parganas police Praveen Kumar said: ?We cannot say the trader has been abducted, as his family has not received a ransom call.? 

 Some officers, however, suspect the involvement of a big-ticket gang in the disappearance of the Salt Lake-based trader. ?Such gangs wait for three or four days, or even a week,? said an officer.

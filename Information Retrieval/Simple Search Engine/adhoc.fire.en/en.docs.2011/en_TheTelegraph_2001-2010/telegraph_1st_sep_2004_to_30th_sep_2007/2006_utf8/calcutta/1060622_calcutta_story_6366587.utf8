 Course tips for wannabe engineers

 A STAFF REPORTER

 An association of private engineering colleges held a series of pre-counselling sessions for students who have qualified in the entrance tests from June 17 to 19 at Kshudiram Anushilan Kendra.

 The three-day presentation and interactive sessions, organised by the state chapter of the Association of Professional Academic Institutions (APAI), were aimed at providing information to the students and their parents on the courses offered by Bengal institutes and their fee structures, course curriculum and infrastructure.

 Representatives of around 50 private engineering colleges interacted with 50,000-odd students, who had cleared the West Bengal Joint Entrance Examination or the All India Engineering Entrance Examination, and their parents.

 ?We decided to host this session to inform both students and parents of the choices open to them, so that they can make an informed decision. This is a kind of fact-finding mission and will be beneficial for all,? said Rajesh Kumar, vice-chairman, Institute of Technology and Marine Engineering (ITME) and member, APAI.

 ?While the main queries were about the faculty, infrastructure and placement, a number of students also wanted to know why they would study in Bengal, instead of in south India. We explained to them that unlike in the south, Bengal colleges do not charge capitation fees,? pointed out Kumar.

 The pre-counselling sessions had representatives of a large number of private educational bodies, such as the Techno Group, ITME, BP Poddar and Haldia Institute of Technology.

 ?Compared to the south, Bengal has a larger number of courses accredited by the All-India Council for Technical Education,? said Ashok Ranjan Thakur, vice-chancellor, West Bengal Institute of Technology. ?Also, industry in the state will require almost 400,000 engineers by 2010. Therefore, we need to facilitate a trouble-free admission procedure.?

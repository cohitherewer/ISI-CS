The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You share your birthday with...

 Dilip Kumar

 You are a natural leader. You excel at games. You love your independence and hate being tied down. You are enthusiastic and a quick learner. You are attached to your friends. You never take advantage of people. Though you are a little eccentric, you live by your word and promises. Kusum Bhandari

series of pens.

Take a look: Its time to write in style; 

designer pens from Italian houses are now available closer home.

Viscontis Van Gogh collection combines natural 

resin and vegetal components in their hot-press mould to produce unique writing 

instruments. The colours are reminiscent of impressionist paintings.

The Jaguar and Ferrari lines from Montegrappa meet 

the taste of the public with sober designs, a variety of colours and materials.

Deltas Dolce Vita Stylus is handmade by skilled 

craftsmen and comes in a presentation case made of silver fabric crosshatch weave. 

Then theres Jacques Bogart from Waldmann. Each brand is available in ball, 

roller-ball and fountain options.

Thats not all. In the wake of The Da Vinci 

Code storm, Tibaldi, the only officially appointed licensee for luxury writing 

instruments in the movie, has produced the Tibaldi Da Vinci Code limited edition 

pens. It is engraved with Leonardo da Vincis iconic Vitruvian Man and a 

series of cryptic codes. Interestingly, deciphering the letters and symbols engraved 

on the pens cap leads to the words that enabled the cryptic box to be opened 

in the book.

Actor Victor Banerjee launched the collection. I 

shall give up acting and start writing, he smiled.

Pocket pinch: The designer pens are priced 

between Rs 1,350 and Rs 1,80,000.

Voiceover: India is home to only three 

Da Vinci Code pens and Prana is the proud displayer of one of them, said

red, white and green. The grape seed used in wine not only contains anti-oxidants, 

but also ensures microcirculation action, protects elastin and collagen fibres 

and helps prevent destruction of hydro colic acid, said salon director Bob 

Suvodeep Saha.

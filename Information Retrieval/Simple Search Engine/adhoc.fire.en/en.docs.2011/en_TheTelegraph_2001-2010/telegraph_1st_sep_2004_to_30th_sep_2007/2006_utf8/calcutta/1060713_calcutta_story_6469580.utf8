The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Lull after the storm

 Several areas across the city remained under water on Wednesday, following heavy rain on Tuesday evening. 

 Many shops in Behala and Garden Reach could not be opened till afternoon due to the waterlogging. 

 Tolly?s Nullah overflowed in Tollygunge and Dhakuria, flooding the banks. ?The entire area was filled with dirty water when I went there this morning. If water isn?t pumped out quickly, there might be an outbreak of diseases,? said Arup Biswas, chairman of borough 10.

 Low-lying pockets of Belgachhia, Kidderpore, Garden Reach, Tangra, Dhakuria and Tollygunge are still inundated, according to civic officials.

 The accumulated rainwater had not subsided even in the city proper (Picture of the Maidan on the left by Pradip Sanyal). Some thoroughfares like CR Avenue had gone under knee-deep water after the showers bringing traffic to a halt. 

 The sky remained mostly overcast on Wednesday, but Met officials said the intensity of rains was expected to reduce. The city had experienced 57.6 mm of rain between 5.30 pm and 8.30 pm on Tuesday. 

 ?The low pressure that had formed over Bangladesh and Gangetic Bengal has weakened. We don?t expect heavy showers in Calcutta and its neighbourhood immediately. However, there will be normal monsoon showers during the next 48 hours,? said G.C. Debnath, director of weather section at the Regional Meteorological Centre in Alipore.

 Vikram Chandra chats about 

 the book. Picture by Aranya Sen 

 Its a 999-page potboiler on the Mumbai underworld just waiting to be picked up for film rights. Talks are on, is all that author Vikram Chandra would say of making a film out of his latest Victorian-Indian-gangster-spy family saga, Sacred Games. 

 Published by Penguin, Chandra picked up interesting chapters to read at the launch from a book liberally interspersed with Hindi expletives characteristic of the Mumbai crime world. Mumbai is a very multilingual city and the expletives give a feel of the real life, says Vikram who spent his growing-up years in tinsel town before moving to the US.

 The world of crime, extortion, murder was very in-your-face in Mumbai, recounts the author: One day when I was returning home with my father, we heard automatic gun shots just round the corner.

 If growing up in Mumbai has marked all his writings till date Red Earth and Pouring Rain, Love and Longing in Bombay and now Sacred Games being the son of Bollywood scriptwriter Kamna Chandra played its part in making Vikram an author. While his mothers profession tempted all his siblings to follow a creative profession, Kamna had warned them the going would really be tough. And, we saw that for ourselves. For two months labour over a radio script, my mother would get a Rs 20 cheque from AIR.

 But that couldnt stop Vikram from writing. He would have these long stories in his head while he was a boy and he wrote his first story, a science fiction inspired by Isaac Asimov, when he was only 11. Chandra soon graduated to fiction, writing a novella for his undergraduate thesis in the US.

 I was very experimental with form. Fable-weaving for me was the most interesting craft, he says. While studying films at Columbia University, he was arrested by this 18th century half-British, half-Indian character Colonel James Skinner who, much like him, was caught in a cultural encounter. Soon, he dropped his film studies to write Red Earth, a magic reality fiction of an Indian student with a typing monkey that takes the reader from late 18th century India to punk bands in LA.

 From a century-spanning novel to a collection of contemporary short stories in Love and Longing in Bombay, Vikram shifted not just in time but also in content and form. With each chapter named after very ancient Indian concepts like Dharma, Karma, Shakti, Vikram shows how each of these plays a vital role in our lives. A police inspector talked to me of his dharma when he had to let go of a criminal because of political pressure. 

 It is from a character in Kama, a story in Love and Longing, that the protagonist of Sacred Games emerges. The silky Sikh police officer Sartaj Singh in his mid-40s fights midlife crisis as well as professional obscurity to prove he isnt finished. I think the readers will dive into it and stay there for a long time, says Vikram of his tome. 

 After three books and two Commonwealth prizes, Vikram, a former software programmer and medical transcripter, still juggles teaching at the University of California, Berkeley, with his writing, and says: I tell my students to develop some other faculty apart from creative writing to support themselves.

 The Bengal Art Auction preview at Taj

 It is a first for India, claimed organisers Taj Bengal and Apparaoart auctions at the three-day preview to The Bengal Art Auction, held at By the Way the new art stop of the Taj.

 Gleaned over several years in consultation with historians, restorers, dealers, collectors and curators, this selection presented by Sharan Apparao aims to present the early and current art of the region.

 The selection on view, before the online auction scheduled for September 3, included everyone from unknown painters of the colonial era to Gaganendranath Tagore, Abanindranath Tagore, Hemen Majumdar, Sunayani Devi, Nandalal Bose, Devi Prasad Roy Chowdhury, Rabindranath Tagore, Jamini Roy, Nikhil Biswas, Gopal Ghosh, Chintamani Kar, Ganesh Pyne, Bikash Bhattacharjee right to newer entrants like Jayashree Chakravarty and Chittrovanu Mazumdar.

 The convergence of allied and varying styles apart, the show was commendable as it brought to the fore art works which would otherwise never have appeared publicly. Such previews are rare at a time when most auctions happen online and paintings are checked out on the Net. 

 We had the space and encouraging art appreciation and collection is one of our aims, said a Taj spokesperson.

 An authenticity workshop helped collectors get their items verified and receive tips on spotting fakes. The Bengal school, according to Sharon Apparao, is grossly undervalued but it is also a market that is waiting to be discovered as soon as the fake market is weeded out. 

 It is a school, Apparao observed, where technique has been king and the merits of academics have not been appreciated until now. But people are going to realise its historical potential shortly, he insisted.

 The previews are, in fact, being held at several venues across the country The Museum Gallery in Mumbai, the Taj Bengal in Calcutta, the Haveli Lobby of Taj Mahal (Mansingh) Delhi and the Apparao Galleries, Wallace Gardens Chennai.

 On September 3, facilitation centres for the countdown will be opened at all Taj hotels in Mumbai, Calcutta, Delhi and the Pottipati plaza in Chennai. At the previews, prospective buyers and their agents can check out the works first hand and also attend the allied events like the film shows and talks by art historian/critic Pranab Ranjan Ray, who along with Shovan Som and Samindranath Majumdar have been historical consultants for the selection.

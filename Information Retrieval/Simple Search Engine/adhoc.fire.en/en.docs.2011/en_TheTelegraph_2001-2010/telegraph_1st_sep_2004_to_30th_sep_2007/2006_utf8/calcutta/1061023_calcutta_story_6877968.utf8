 owers, like fashion trends, come and go, says Kavita Poddar, secretary of Pushpa-Bitan Friendship Society. That explains the sudden expulsion of good ol gladiolus from every arrangement and the sudden inclusion of gerberas.

 But the flower story in Calcutta went far beyond top trends during this Diwali countdown as the city played host to International Floral Extravaganza.

 Two days, 14 countries and some rare petal pick. Organised by Pushpa-Bitan Friendship Society and city-based flower importers Oriental Flowers, the show, held at Marwar on Judges Court Road, Alipore, featured exotic blooms from across the globe, some to see and some for sale.

 The star of the show was White Protea, a South African flower that weighs more than a kilo.

 so seen, as supporting cast and crew, were lots of Australian Banksias, orchids from Thailand and Singapore, various types of grass like Steel Grass and fillers and exotic Indian blooms. 

 Another highlight of the show was the enthusiasm and support of Calcuttas consul crowd. Diplomats from Japan, UK, Italy, Russia, Germany, Nepal and the honorary consuls of South Africa, Australia and Myanmar came forward to light the lamps attached to the flags of their respective countries at the Prithvi arrangement. 

 This is an effort to introduce Calcutta to international standards and to encourage them to take part in world shows. The exposition will also serve as a curtain-raiser to the World Flower Show in Pakistan in 2008, says Kavita.

 Pushpa-Bitan Friendship Society in town is the countrys only link to World Association of Flower Arrangers, but the Calcutta connection dims right there.

 Experts say that barring tuberose and marigold, there is not much happening on the floral front here.

 Unlike other countries where the flowers grow under controlled conditions, the scene here is left untapped. We have great potential. Not just tuberose and marigold, some annuals like larkspur and chrysanthemum and foliage too, rues Kavita.

 At a national level, India stands as the largest exporter for gerberas and its anthuriums and roses dont do too bad either.

 Pockets like Thiruvananthapuram for birds of paradise and anthuriums do well. Pune is known for roses and Sikkim for its orchids. But we can do much better, feels Kavita.

 Better in terms of care and conditioning. And as Pawan Agarwal, proprietor of Oriental Flowers, put it: Our marketing is very weak. Holland and Australia are very aggressive, they hold exhibitions, programmes and develop packing to increase a flowers shelf life. India needs to realise its latent potential.

 And Calcutta must start saying it with flowers.

 Police help for car park 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The civic body has sought police help to complete the Lindsay Street parking plaza, after a group of New Market traders hurled bricks at two Dutch engineers working underground on Friday.

 ?The two engineers were not injured. The traders also prevented the civic contractors from repairing a breach in the water supply line,? said Nilangshu Bose, chief engineer (civil) of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation.

 According to the contractor, the traders are not allowing installation of a glass lift.

 A truck carrying stone chips overturned on Lindsay Street on Friday morning, causing the breach in the water pipe. The traders were reportedly protesting this accident.

 Poll cold shoulder to $1-bn campus

 BISWARUP GOOPTU

 Poll 2006 in Bengal may have claimed its first casualty ? a $1-billion campus of higher education and research.

 Educational reform may be one of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s pet poll planks, but his state has slipped from pole position in industrialist Anil Agarwal?s race to set up ?India?s version of Harvard, Stanford or Oxford?.

 And why has Bengal fallen behind Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh in the Vedanta Group chairman?s scheme of things? 

 Simply because Writers? Buildings is too busy with poll preparations to give serious thought to the proposal for the private university.

 Officials of AT Kearney, management consultants for the campus, and representatives of Anil Agarwal had met government officials in February-March. With Assembly elections around the corner, time is running out for Bengal, as Agarwal plans to complete site acquisition before July 2006 for the campus eyeing a July 2008 start-up.

 ?We have met state government officials, but nothing concrete has taken place so far due to the elections. Discussions with the Bengal government have been put on the backburner. We will review our position with regard to Bengal in May, but only if negotiations with the other states have not progressed much till then,? said Suhag Ghosh, manager, AT Kearney.

 Ghosh confirmed that they were in ?an advanced stage of discussions? with Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh, both opening their doors to private universities.

 When asked about the cold shoulder to Vedanta and the red carpet for Reliance, minister for higher education Satyasadhan Chakraborty said: ?Anil Ambani?s proposal is different, as the Dhirubhai Ambani University is going to be an advanced technical institute. However, all decisions will be taken after the elections.?

 To put things into perspective, the Dhirubhai Ambani University will come up on 50 acres in Kalyani at an initial project cost of Rs 100 crore. 

 If Bengal bags the Anil Agarwal campus, it would be on 200 acres of land, with an initial investment of more than Rs 4,400 crore.

 This would house five to six colleges in various streams and three to four centres of excellence for research.

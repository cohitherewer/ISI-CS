 What: 

 Launch of Fort Knox. 

 Where: 6 Camac Street.

 When: Thursday.

 Take a look: The launch saw an assembly of city jewellers and retailers. Present at the inauguration was Ashok Bhattacharya, minister in charge of municipal affairs and urban development. The jewellery mall is the first of its kind and a value-add to the city. A mall like this is certainly going to increase economic activity, said Bhattacharya. 

 Kundan from Jaipur, pearls from Hyderabad, meenakari from Bengal, diamonds, semi-precious stones? the nine-storied, 80,000 sq ft mall is home to it all. The mall offers brands like Tanishq, DDamas, Kiah, Orra, Zenith and Adora.

 While you find showrooms till the fourth floor, the next four floors are for customised back offices. On the topmost floor are lounge bar Venom and restaurant Little Italy. 

 Voiceover: Calcutta lacked a venture like this for long. It is a one-stop jewellery destination that will give the city all the variety it wants but without asking people to trek from one part of the city to the other, said Ashok Bengani, president, Fort Group.

 Golden oldies

 What: Revamp Heirlooms.

 Where: Diagold showroom at 4 Lee Road.

 Take a look: Locker jewellery gets a meaningful makeover and transforms into wearable, chic pieces. Designer Varda Goenka offers a solution to all jewellery trouble: from the shine wearing off to gold threads tearing. A touch of rhodium polish or a ruby drop?and an old piece gets a whole new look.

 The aim is to remodel pieces by making subtle changes without breaking the original piece, says Varda. 

 A traditional diamond and emerald necklace and earring set can be transformed into a stylish pendant. To some are added precious and semi-precious stones like sapphires, rubies, topaz, tourmalines, chalcedony and onyxes. 

 The offer seems to be a hit with 30-plus women. Those in their 30s and 40s want the pieces to match their party and wedding attires. For elderly ladies, we are altering old pieces to make them suitable for their daughters and daughters-in-law, adds Varda. 

 Pocket pinch: Minimum charges are Rs 1,500. 

 Voiceover: Old pieces have sentimental value but can become passe. We want to restore these heirloom pieces so that they suit current fashion fads, says Varda.

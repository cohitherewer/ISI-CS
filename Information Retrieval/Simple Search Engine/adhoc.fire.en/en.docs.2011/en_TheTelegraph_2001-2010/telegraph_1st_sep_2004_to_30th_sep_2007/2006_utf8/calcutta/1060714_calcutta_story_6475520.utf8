 A year ago, during a visit to Vaishno Devi with childhood friend Subir Das Majumdar and others, Ashis Ghosh Roy had resolved that the next trip would be to Amarnath.

 On Thursday night, as the 57-year-old director of the Geological Survey of India was brought home dead, none of the group members with whom Ashis had left for Amarnath on July 7 was present. Except for Subir.

 Having lost wife Purabi and sister Bandana in the July 11 blast, 57-year-old Subir was at a loss when Ashis?s body was being slowly taken out of the van. The sight brought back a flood of memories ? recent, yet so distant.

 ?When we were planning the trip, Ashis?s wife Kaberi said she would join us. Ashis was very excited. It was then that I thought Purabi, too, could come along. It was such fun all the way,? Subir recalled, fixing his gaze on the splinter wounds on his palm.

 On the morning of the fateful day, the 13-member group went out for a brief spell of shopping and then boarded a tourist bus at Dal Gate.

 ?Seated beside the driver, I was keeping a watch on the road ahead. A scooter suddenly came in the way and the driver slammed the brakes. Seconds later, there was a deafening sound that left me numb for a few minutes. When I opened my eyes, there was thick smoke all around. All I could see were shards of glass,? Subir recounted.

 In the next few minutes, as police rushed in and local residents lent a helping hand to carry the injured to a local hospital, Subir was only hoping that all the members of his group would survive the terror attack. But that was not to be.

 The bodies of the six other tourists from Bengal that were brought to the city on Wednesday evening were cremated on Thursday morning at Nimtala burning ghat.

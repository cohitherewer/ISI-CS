The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You share your birthday with...

 Brad Pitt

 You are dependable and giving; loving and caring. You radiate a gentle, natural inner strength. You have your hopes, ambitions and dreams and you arent easily sidetracked. You dont react well to change or emergency. You are better at a team game than a solo act. Perhaps you need to budget your spending. Kusum Bhandari

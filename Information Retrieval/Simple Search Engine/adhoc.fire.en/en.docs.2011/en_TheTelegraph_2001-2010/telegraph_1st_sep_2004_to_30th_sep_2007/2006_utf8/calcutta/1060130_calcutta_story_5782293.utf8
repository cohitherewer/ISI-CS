 A new ode to old desires 

Screen On amp; Off

After the politically charged Hazaaron Khwaishein 

Aisi, director SUDHIR MISHRA 

is making a tale of love and independence in Bahut Nikle Mere Armaan. He 

talks to Pratim D. Gupta about the film which is set in the Indian movie industry 

of the 1950s

Hazaaron khwaishein aisi ke har khwaish pe dam 

nikle, 

Bahut nikle mere armaan, lekin phir bhi kam nikle...

When Mirza Ghalib wrote this magic couplet, he couldn?t 

have possibly imagined that years later a film-maker would name two of his movies 

after the mukhras of the two lines. That too back-to-back. So, even as 

awards and accolades continue to pour in for Hazaaron Khwaishein Aisi, 

director Sudhir Mishra is on to Bahut Nikle Mere Armaan.

?It is about the contradiction between love and independence,? 

Mishra says from Mumbai. ?The film is set in the Indian movie industry of the 

1950s when people like Guru Dutt and Bimal Roy were making their classics. It?s 

like a tribute to a period which, I feel, produced the most interesting cinema, 

when film-makers used to take a lot of stylistic liberties.?

Just like he did in Hazaaron? Mishra tries 

to look at personal relationships against a volatile backdrop in Bahut? ?The 

film is ultimately about the separate desires of two people ? an actress and a 

writer. While the actress is a big star and doesn?t wish to leave the limelight, 

the writer is a free soul who wants her to sacrifice her career for their love. 

So at a time when the country had just become independent, these two people want 

their individual independence.?

Despite choosing the 1950s film industry as the backdrop, 

Mishra doesn?t base his story on any stalwart of Indian cinema history. ?The subject 

will be roughly true to its time but not inspired by anybody in particular. Take 

Guru Dutt for example. Much of his life is romanticised as an independent director 

who turned into a pauper but in reality he was a rich film-maker who had his own 

studio. I am not interested in such gossip.?

What Mishra is more interested in are the lives of 

all those Urdu writers who used to come to Mumbai from UP and Punjab to write 

songs for Hindi films. ?They were men on the streets. They wanted to write lyrics 

not only to pursue their passion for poetry but as their only source of livelihood. 

It was for them a kind of monetary solace. And this was at a time when Urdu as 

a language was losing its place after the Indian independence.? 

Apart from the rich content, Mishra wants to play 

with the colour tones of the images in Bahut? like Martin Scorsese did 

in Aviator. ?That?s the interesting part of putting the film a little back 

in time. You can create a certain visual style. All the films shot at that time 

were in black-and-white. So the films within my film will be black-and-white. 

Then even for the main film, we are planning to take out certain colours to give 

a very period look to the images.

For his lead pair, Mishra has gone for the two who 

have been recently sweeping all the Best Debut awards ? Shiney Ahuja and Vidya 

Balan. ?Casting Shiney was an automatic choice. He is not only very talented, 

he is like family to me. Now, Vidya has a certain old-world charm and the spunk 

of an independent woman. She has softness with strength, is polite yet firm. She 

has the rare quality of looking modern without mimicking a western person.?

But after the critical acclaim of Hazaaron?, 

he could have surely afforded big stars for his new film. ?I couldn?t have even 

made Hazaaron? with stars,? Mishra feels. ?That would have brought a duality 

of personality for the audiences watching the movie. I was looking for people 

with no reference points in Indian cinema. It was important for me that the character 

of Geeta existed in life but not in films.?

Mishra is happy with the kind of response Hazaaron? 

has received from within the industry. ?That film can now take care of itself. 

Maybe after watching the film on TV (the small-screen premiere is on Monday on 

STAR Gold at 8.30 pm), people will now see the other films I had made. If it did 

nothing else, Hazaaron? showed that there are more actors in the industry 

than the seven-eight people who come from film families.?

 Bahut Nikle Mere Armaan, to release next year, 

is produced by Prakash Jha and will go on the floors by May this year.

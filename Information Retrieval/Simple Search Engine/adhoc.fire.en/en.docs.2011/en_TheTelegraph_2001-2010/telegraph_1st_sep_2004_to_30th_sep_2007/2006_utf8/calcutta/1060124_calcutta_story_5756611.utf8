 Mini Earth on Bypass

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 Encouraged by the growing popularity of Science City, the National Council of Science Museums has embarked upon a novel project on the premises ? a replication of Earth.

 Based on the theme ?The Planet We Live In?, the project aims at providing information on all aspects of the planet Earth ? its position in the solar system, diurnal and seasonal movements, climate, vegetation, forests, deserts, animal life, its people and the languages.

 Being set up with an initial grant of Rs 2 crore from the Centre, the project is likely to be complete in 2007. It will be housed in a building that will look like a globe, the shape of the planet. ?The Centre has approved the design,? said Ingit Mukherjee, director-general of the Indian Council for Science Museums. 

 The building will be divided into halves ? resembling the northern and southern hemispheres ? with a demarcating line along the centre, the Equator. 

 Besides, demarcation lines in concrete will run through the building horizontally and vertically, representing the latitudes and longitudes.

 ?If a visitor is curious about a forest region or a desert zone, he will just have to get into the representative segment of the globe-like building. He will be able to search for himself whatever he wants to know,? an official said.

 Each segment will be modelled on the geographical location it represents. For instance, the segment resembling the Artic belt will be maintained at a very low temperature.

 Citing another example, the official said: ?If a visitor is interested in the language of a particular country, he will have to type out a word in a language of his choice in the computer. The word will be instantly translated into the language he wants to know about.?

 Officials hope that once commissioned, the project will further swell the footfall at Science City, which has outperformed its counterparts across the country in drawing crowds.

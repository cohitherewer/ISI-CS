 Descent to danger

 - FLYOVER BLAMED FOR MISHAP COUNT

 Barely three weeks after being thrown open to traffic, the Taratala flyover is besieged with problems . And residents of the area blame it for the rise in mishap count.

 Crossing Diamond Harbour Road has become risky, they allege, because of the high speed of the vehicles descending the flyover. 

 The LIG Tenants Association of the Government Housing Estate in Behala (Old Dog Race Course) has petitioned the joint commissioner of police (traffic) and the transport department, seeking immediate redress.

 ?It has become absolutely necessary to post a traffic constable in front of the Government Housing Estate on Diamond Harbour Road? Installation of automatic signalling system and construction of a speedbreaker are our other demands,? one of the petitioners said. 

 The situation has been worsened by the trucks that are routinely parked along the road, between the Government Housing Estate and Ajanta cinema.

 Joint commissioner (traffic) Ranvir Kumar said he was aware of the problem. ?I have received the complaint and have forwarded it to assistant commissioner (traffic). We?ll decide on the measures to be taken after I receive a report.?

 Transport department officials, however, ruled out setting up speedbreakers at the foot of a flyover, as the movement of vehicles descending at an average speed of 50 to 60 kph should not be curbed.

 ?Similarly, it is not logical to have signalling system on the spot, since the idea is to let vehicles pass through freely. We cannot allow cross-traffic at the foot of a flyover,? said a transport department official.

 The government, instead, intends setting up medians and guard rails for 50 metres from the point the flyover merges with Diamond Harbour Road, to prevent pedestrians from walking across.

 ?If the volume of pedestrian traffic increases significantly, we might think of installing a pedestrian overbridge at the foot of the flyover. However, that will depend on whether local residents prefer using an overbridge to jaywalking,? the official added.

 A similar problem had occurred at the Lockgate flyover, soon after it was commissioned in August 2004. Three deaths in four months had prompted the transport department to accede to the local residents? demand for a pedestrian overbridge.

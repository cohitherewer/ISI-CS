 Cruise from Calcutta to the Andamans, via Puri, with coastal cuisine and even casino for company this wonderland on the waters promises to be a reality soon.

 Calcutta Port Trust (CPT) has invited expressions of interest from global operators to run a cruise in the Bay of Bengal and on the river Hooghly. It is also building a special terminal in the Kidderpore docks to facilitate cruise movement. The Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) will be upgrading the existing jetty.

 Anup K. Chanda, chairman of CPT, told Metro: Cruise tourism has a huge potential here. The Calcutta-Puri circuit is an age-old favourite, but people prefer to travel by train. The cruise will open up a whole new channel.

 With the CPT proposal being floated, Star Cruise, which has launched cruise boats in the Mumbai-Goa-Lakshwadeep circuit, will be eyeing the eastern coast. This is a welcome move. We will definitely look into this, said Sumit Banerjee, sales and marketing manager of Star Cruise in India.

 The travel trade circle feels a cabin for the Andamans with sea view can cost Rs 15,000, while that to Puri may come for Rs 4,000-5,000 per person. The cruise will do well from here, said Anil Punjabi, eastern region chairman of the Travel Agents Federation of India.

 Star Cruise provides casino options on its liners, but only when they are not in Indian waters, confirms Banerjee. That is an option on the proposed cruise as the three-day trip from Calcutta to the Andamans could chart international waters.

 The proposed route will be Calcutta-Sagar Island-Puri-Andamans. At every point, the liner will rest at an all-weather anchorage point, from where the tourists will be taken ashore in smaller crafts. The visit to Puri could be combined with land tourism trips to Konark and Bhubaneswar.

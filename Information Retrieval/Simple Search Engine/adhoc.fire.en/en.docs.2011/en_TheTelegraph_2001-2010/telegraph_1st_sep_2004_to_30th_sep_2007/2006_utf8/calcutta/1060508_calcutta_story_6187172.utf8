 A elaborate menu at the restaurant that boasts a range of Indian as well as Oriental dishes and a beverage card at the lounge bar that serves up some interesting cocktails and mocktails... 

 Welcome to Ginger, the latest addition to the citys list of lounge-cum-restaurants. 

 Located at 104, SP Mukherjee Road, right next to Basusree cinema at Hazra, Ginger opened its doors on Friday afternoon. The two-storeyed place with plush interiors is the first of its kind in this part of the city. 

 The latent demand among residents of this area for such a place inspired us to come up with Ginger, smiles Rohit Ganeriwala, director of Ginger.

 The 6,000 sq ft space is finely etched out, taking into account the various needs of the diner. 

 Well-spaced-out purple and silver lighting renders a vibrant touch to the ground floor lounge.

 Cosy low sofas and tables exude warmth, giving the place a comfortable feel. 

 Being able to relax after a hard days work is the keyword. So, we havent gone for any fancy arrangement, just a cluster of these comfortable seating options that one can sink into while sipping on a favourite drink, says Rohit. 

 The drink list comprises some all-time favourite cocktail specialities like Screwdriver, Margarita, Blue Lagoon and Tequila Sunrise to name a few. 

 Shooters include Kamikaze, B63 and Steps to Heaven.

 The signature drink at Ginger is the Mojito with a twist ? a mix of vodka, Effect energy drink, freshly-ground mint leaves, a slice of lemon and a tinge of brown sugar.

 Moving up to the first floor, a soothing ambience done up with silver lights and a tinge of red greets the diner.

 The menu on offer includes a fine combination of speciality Oriental and Chinese cuisine being dished out by exceutive chef U.C. Roy, a specialist in North Indian and Mughlai cooking. 

 Some of the specialities from the Indian menu include Ginger Ki Special Dal, Makai Kurkure, Gosht Gilawat Kebab, Lasooni Jhinga, Omar Khayam Ka Murg, Crab Masala and Shahi Tukra.

 The chefs speciality items include Hyderabadi Mutton Biryani, Mutton Rogan Josh and Galauti Kebab. 

 No one appreciates well-cooked food better than Calcuttans. And they love their biryani and kebabs when cooked in authentic style. And thats exactly what I am trying to cook up here, says Roy. 

 For tastebuds preferring Oriental fare, Ginger has quite a wide variety. The spread comprises Lemon Coriander Soup, Chilli Garlic Crab Meat Soup, Brocolli Pepper Salt, Baby Corn and Mushroom Hong Kong Style and Braised Fish in Chilli Wine Sauce to name a few.

 While the drink card starts at Rs 140, a meal for two at the restaurant would come for around Rs 450.

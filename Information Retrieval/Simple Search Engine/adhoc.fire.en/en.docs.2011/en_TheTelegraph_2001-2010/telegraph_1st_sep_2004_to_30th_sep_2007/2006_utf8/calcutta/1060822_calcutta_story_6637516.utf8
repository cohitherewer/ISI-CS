 A dance performance based on different dance styles of Orissa, Krishna Madhuri depicts the life of Lord Krishna in a delightful pattern of rhythms and drum beats. Presented by Sutapa Talukdar and a group of 25 artistes from her dance academy, Gurukul, it weaves a colourful story from records found in ancient talapatras (palm leaf manuscripts), as well as from verses in the Vaishnava Padavali and The Mahabharata. It portrays the dark-skinned Lord as a naughty child (Bala Gopala), a courageous boy (Veer Krishna), a passionate lover (Kanhaiya) and a shrewd politician. Inspired by the folk dance of Ganjam, it will be performed to the accompaniment of the lively, pulsating rhythm of the khol, paying rare homage to khol players of Orissa. The traditional patachitra style of painting of Orissa has influenced set-design and dancers costumes. Capturing the awesome versatility of Lord Krishna, the performance brilliantly recreates the intensity of his power and presence from childhood to adulthood. Choreography: Sutapa Talukdar.

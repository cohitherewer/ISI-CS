The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Gulf airline sets new date 

 - BIZ SEGMENT, VISITING KIN TARGET CLIENTELE 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Prompted by the growth in Calcutta?s information technology sector and its new-found business prominence, Emirates, the Dubai-based international airline, has decided to fly out six times a week from the city, starting March and not April 1, as it had declared earlier..

 ?It is not just the business traveller that we are targeting. We expect to cater to the big visiting-friends-and-relatives segment in Calcutta, too,? an Emirates spokesperson told Metro from Dubai. ?Calcutta businessmen are now looking beyond the boundaries of the country and we are ready to offer our services to them,? he added.

 From March 26, the airline will fly out of Calcutta on all days of the week, barring Saturdays. It plans to increase capacity soon. ?We intend to make it a seven-day affair eventually,? the spokesperson stated.

 Travel agents in the city have welcomed the development. Another international airline, Royal Jordanian, recently stopped Calcutta operations.

 ?This is the best development in the city aviation sector in recent times. It will be a responsibility of not only the airline but also the travel agents to boost the traffic flow,? said Anil Punjabi, chairman (east) of Travel Agents Federation of India.

 Emirates will operate an Airbus A330-200 aircraft on the route in three-and-two class configurations. ?We will have first, business and economy classes on some days. On others, there will be the business and economy class for passengers to choose from. Our fares will be competitive and will be finalised by February,? the spokesperson elaborated.

 ?Emirates is delighted to offer its customers another exciting Indian destination. The start of the flights to Calcutta is an important milestone in the history of our Indian operations, as it signifies our entry to the northeastern part of the country,? Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al-Maktoum, chairman-cum-chief executive, Emirates Airline and Group, said.

 From Dubai, the airline flies to 75 destinations across 55 countries in Europe, North America, Asia Pacific and Africa. It commenced its worldwide operations in October 1985 with Mumbai and Delhi among the first few destinations. Over the years, the relationship of the airline with the country strengthened as it began serving gateways in south India.

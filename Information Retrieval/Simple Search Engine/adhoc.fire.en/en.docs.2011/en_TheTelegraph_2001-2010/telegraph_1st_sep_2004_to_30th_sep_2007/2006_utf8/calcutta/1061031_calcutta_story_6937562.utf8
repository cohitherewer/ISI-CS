 Boy steals cash from locked flat

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A boy picked the lock to enter a flat in a highrise on South Sinthee Road on Monday afternoon and decamped with Rs 10,000. A neighbour, who spied on the boy through the magic eye, alerted police.

 The theft took place when the owners of the flat, Arijit Sarkar and his wife, were not at home. Around 12.45 pm, a woman residing in the flat opposite to that of the Sarkars on the second floor of the building, heard sounds in the corridor. She looked through the magic eye to see a boy, around 12 years old, fiddling with the lock of the Sarkars flat.

 When she tried to look out again after a few minutes, she found the magic eye blocked with a hand. She immediately informed a relative, who called Sinthee police station. The cops arrived to find cash missing from an almirah.

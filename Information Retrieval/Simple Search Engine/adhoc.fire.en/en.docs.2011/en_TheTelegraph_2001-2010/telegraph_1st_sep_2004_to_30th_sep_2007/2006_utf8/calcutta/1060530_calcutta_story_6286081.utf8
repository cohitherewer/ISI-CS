 Sergeant plays the saviour

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Suresh Chandra Jaiswal shudders to think what could have happened to his wife Shanti Devi, who was critically injured after being knocked off his scooter?s pillion by a car, had not a traffic sergeant rushed to their rescue and arranged for her treatment on Monday night.

 Sergeant Kaushik Chakrabarty, of the South Traffic Guard, immediately called a taxi and took the family ? the Jaiswals? 10-year-old son was with them but was not injured ? to SSKM Hospital. 

 At the emergency ward, he requested the doctors to promptly attend to the woman and arranged for her medication and a scan of her head. 

 Chakrabarty left only after informing the Jaiswals? relatives about the accident. 

 ?Thank you,? was all a dazed Suresh could murmur to the sergeant. 

 The Jaiswals were returning home on Kailash Bose Street, under Amherst Street police station, from a family get-together in Chetla. Suresh was driving the scooter and his wife and son were riding pillion. Opposite the American Center, a speeding Maruti van heading for the Park Street flyover hit the two-wheeler.

 ?I was near Birla Planetarium when the message came on my manpac. When I reached the spot, the couple and the child were lying on the road. The woman was badly injured in her head and was throwing up. She needed immediate medication,? Kaushik said.

 Duo nabbed after chase

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 A traffic sergeant chased and arrested two motorcycle-borne cellphone lifters at New Alipore on Sunday afternoon. A driver who joined the chase helped the cop. 

 The lifters ? Mohammad Akram, 17, and Zafar Iqbal, 20 ? have criminal records. In addition to the cellphone they had snatched, police found two cellphones and a gold chain on them. The two were taken to New Alipore police station.

 ?The youngsters are from the Mayurbhanj area of Ekbalpore. They seem to have been on a lifting spree for some time. We need to interrogate them more to find out about their criminal antecedents. The mobile phone sets and gold chain we found on them could have been snatched earlier,? said a senior officer of the police station.

 Vivek Shukla of Block D, New Alipore, was taking a stroll after lunch when the duo intercepted him near the intersection of Sahapur Road and Shibnath Shastri Road. 

 The two, according to witnesses, came from behind, stopped the motorcycle, snatched Shukla?s expensive cellphone set and sped off.

 Hearing Shukla?s cry for help, some bystanders alerted sergeant Pankaj Kumar Ghatak of the South West Traffic Guard.

 ?I had just reported for duty when the incident took place. I started chasing the two on my motorcycle. There was an Ambassador in front of me. Its driver, too, realised that the youths were trying to flee after a crime and joined the chase,? recalled Ghosh.

 ?A local youth pulled down pillion-rider Iqbal when the two-wheeler slowed. We managed to catch up with Akram in front of the Alipore mint,? said Ghatak.

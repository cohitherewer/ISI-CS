 Boot for biz fair, boost to book fair

 The chief minister at the opening of Book Fair 2005

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had sought clearance from Pranab Mukherjee, then defence minister, to hold both Book Fair and Industrial India Trade Fair on the Maidan this winter.

 On Wednesday, the state government decided to shift the trade fair out of the precious patch of green. But to keep Book Fair 2007 on the Maidan, it is ready to go to court.

 The decision to move the Bengal National Chamber of Commerce and Industry s trade fair, supported by the state government, was taken at a meeting chaired by chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb. 

 Refusal by the army and environmental concerns were cited as the reasons.

 To allow the far more environmentally-damaging Book Fair to be held on the Maidan, Deb has convened a meeting with officers of the army and the organisers, Publishers and Booksellers Guild, on Thursday morning.

 Modalities of moving a joint writ petition before the high court in this regard will be worked out at the meeting. The court had allowed Book Fair 2006 to be held on the Maidan on the condition that it was to be the last at the venue.

 Environmentalist Subhas Dutta termed the development a perfect example of double standards being practised by the government. This unprecedented government interest in a non-government event warrants investigation, he added.

 We have decided to shift the trade fair to Salt Lake stadium as we didnt get permission from the army and Milon Mela is not ready. The fair will be held at Milon Mela next year, said commerce and industry secretary Sabyasachi Sen.

 Chamber officials were in the dark about the venue till late on Wednesday. Weve applied to the army and the government for permission to hold the fair on the Maidan. We havent heard from them, said chairman of the fair committee Samir Ghosh.

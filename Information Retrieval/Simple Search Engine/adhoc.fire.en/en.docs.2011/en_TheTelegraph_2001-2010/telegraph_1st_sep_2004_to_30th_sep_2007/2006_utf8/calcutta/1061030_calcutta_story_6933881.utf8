 Get set for star wars, Bollywood 

 style.

 A designer trained at NIFD, Raj Ghosh is an aspiring film-maker trying to make it to the big screen after dabbling in fashion, modelling and choreography.

 Awaiting the release of his debut film Anushochona (meaning regret), based on the personal and professional lives of a choreographer and fashion models, the 30-year-old is also busy gearing up for his second venture, a love story called Hariye Paoa. Going all out with a romantic potboiler, Hariye Paoa stars Abhishek Chatterjee and Rimjhim Gupta.

 Abhishek plays a millionaire who loses his memory after bearing the brunt of a mob attack in a village, while Rimjhim plays a Muslim doctor who nurses Abhishek back to health and then almost loses him as he regains his memory (Harano Sur, anyone?). I play a caring girl who falls in love and marries her patient but Abhishek forgets all about me on regaining his memory, adds Rimjhim. 

 Raj and his team are ready to hit the floors in December, before travelling to Visakhapatnam and Mukutmanipur for song-and-dance routines. Produced by Sushmita Mukherjee of Telewide, Ghosh is planning a special release on Valentines Day 2007. My movies may have a good deal of filmi masala but will not lose touch with reality, assures Raj.

 Anushochona, set for a December release, stars Rupanjana and a host of Calcutta models like Sanjoy, Rajiv, Saptami and Niharika. I have drawn from real-life experiences for the script and the characters of Anushochona, says Raj, who has directed almost 200 music albums for singers like Usha Uthup, Bhupen Hazarika and Jojo.

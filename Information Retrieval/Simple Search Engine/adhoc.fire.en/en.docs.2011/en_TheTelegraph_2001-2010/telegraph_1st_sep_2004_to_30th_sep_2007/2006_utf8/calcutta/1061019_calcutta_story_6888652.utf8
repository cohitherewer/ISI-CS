The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Mall told to shut kiosk of discord 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Metro Shopping Centre, crippled by the ring of restrictions around its Ho Chi Minh Sarani address, hit yet another security hurdle on Wednesday. 

 The citys first formatted mall space for organised retail was ordered by police to shut down a makeshift fast-food counter, following a prod from the adjoining British deputy high commission.

 A team from Shakespeare Sarani police station went to the mall and inspected the kiosk, said to be too close to the boundary wall for comfort.

 The decision was taken immediately after the inspection. It was too close to the wall of the British deputy high commission, a high-security zone, said Ajay Kumar, deputy commissioner of police (south division). 

 We have asked for the food kiosk to be relocated, he declared.

 Sandwiched between the key British and American addresses in town and with no multiplex or food court to drive footfall, this will hit Metro Plaza where it hurts.

 Its already such a struggle, with so much competition from hi-tech malls. If we have to do away with the food-on-wheels kiosk, it would be a body blow. We cant let that happen, said Faroque Hashmi, general secretary of the Metro Shopping Centre Shop Owners Welfare Association.

 The chaatphuchka counters, introduced early this year, have proved real energisers of footfall at the shopping centre with 250-odd stores.

 The shop-owners association doesnt see any security threat to the British deputy high commission next door, with which it shares a boundary wall.

 The association has even offered to extend the wall or provide closed-circuit cameras trained on the fast-food counter as additional security measures. 

 Now that we have been asked to remove the kiosk or risk seizure, we will have to go to court to seek an injunction if police force the issue, said Hashmi.

 Police added that the kiosk of contention was declared unauthorised by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, too. 

 This was countered by the shop-owners association, on the grounds that the matter was pending in court and so the eatery could not be branded unauthorised.

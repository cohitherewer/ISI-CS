The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 Over the past few years, Calcutta Municipal Corporation has been sanctioning 

parking spaces on the premises of a number of new multi-storeyed buildings in 

office areas of the city. The main objective is to curb illegal parking on the 

busy thoroughfares. However, some of the developers/promoters have subsequently 

bribed officials to convert these parking spaces into showrooms or offices. Some 

such illegal offices/showrooms are located on Park Street, Sarat Bose Road, Shakespeare 

Sarani and Hungerford Street. The mayor should order an inquiry into such cases 

and see to it that the areas are vacated and reconverted into parking spaces.

 Blaring loudspeakers are a regular nuisance in Mukundapur. It is understood 

that organisations in residential areas also have the freedom to hold religious 

programmes, but they should keep in mind the welfare of the people in the neighbourhood. 

Some residents of this area seem devoid of this basic concern for others. They 

often organise big gatherings and play devotional songs on loudspeakers. Festivals 

like Pujas and Poila Baisakh are occasions when everybody enjoys music over loudspeakers. 

But this shouldn?t become a year-round affair. While the students in the area 

are unable to concentrate in their studies, patients in a hospital nearby are 

terrified of the noise. I request the local administration and police to look 

into this matter immediately. The organisers of such programmes should not be 

granted permission to use loudspeakers during every function.

Mukundapur.

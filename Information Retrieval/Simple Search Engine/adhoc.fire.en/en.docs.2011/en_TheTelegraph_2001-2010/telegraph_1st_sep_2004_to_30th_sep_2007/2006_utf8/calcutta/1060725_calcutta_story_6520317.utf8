The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Poll over, police tax hiked

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Assembly polls over, the police tax on a host of establishments in the city ? from five-star hotels to roadside shops selling cigarettes ? is set to increase, and increase significantly.

 What used to be a nominal pay-off of anything from Rs 50 to few hundred rupees will now range from Rs 500 to Rs 10,000. Cyber cafes will come under the tax net for the first time.

 The state cabinet on Tuesday will discuss the revisions proposed in the Calcutta Suburban Police Bill. Officials said the proposals were drawn up last October, but the implementation process was pushed back by the polls.

 According to the proposal, five-star hotels will have to shell out Rs 10,000 a year as police tax. Restaurants and boarding houses, including those lodging pilgrims, will be required to pay Rs 2,500.

 Sweet shops, and tea and coffee shops also selling food items, will be taxed Rs 2,500. Shops that sell only tea, coffee and soft drinks must pay police Rs 600 a year, in addition to Rs 60 a month.

 Shops selling paan, cigarettes and other tobacco products will be charged Rs 600. Cyber cafes will have to make an annual payment of Rs 2,200 for each server connection.

 For bars and liquor shops, the annual tax will be Rs 10,000. Temporary bars will have to pay Rs 500 annually, while the charge for bringing an animal/pet into an establishment will be Rs 100.

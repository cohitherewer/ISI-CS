 Of all the folk plays of Orissa, Prahlad Nataka is perhaps the most elaborate and colourful. First conceived by Raja Ramkrushna Chhotray, it is a blend of ancient classical theatre and folk theatre. Not a well-defined dramatic piece in its true sense, it is a continuous text with songs, with its plot held together by a gahaka (interpreter), who describes events that the actors cannot convey. Based on a legend from the Nrushingha Purana, it tells the story of Prahlad, who is a devotee of Lord Krishna, although born in a family of demons. The major characters of the play are Hiranya Kashipu, Nrusingha and Prahlad, a little boy. A musical with 120 songs, it is highly spectacular and dramatic in presentation, with loud music, vigorous dance, acrobatics and dialogues in Oriya and Sanskrit. In a scene of greatly exaggerated histrionics, Nrusingha appears on stage wearing a big mask and is led by a rope as he is supposed to have killed Hiranya Kashipu. Hosted by Eastern Zonal Cultural Centre.

 After setting the mood at public 

 spaces like hookah bar Shisha and the soon-to-open Marrakesh 

 Lounge in Cinnamon, Moroccan magic is now homeward bound.

 Splashing the interiors with reds 

 and oranges, experimenting with soft, diffused lighting, 

 playing around with mosaic and indulging in rich velvets 

 and silks? Lend your home an opulent touch like never before. 

 GoodLife tells you how. 

 Design detail

 Architect and interior designer 

 Vivek Rathore dubs the Moroccan decor theme as something 

 that borrows heavily from its rich past and has great 

 character. 

 A Moroccan home, says Vivek, uses 

 old elements and fundamentals but each of the designs is 

 new, and a beautiful blend of sensibilities.

 While original Moroccan homes, 

 explains interior designer Charu Rajgarhia, boast of high 

 doors and lots of arches, the contemporary version is more 

 about straight lines. 

 The flooring can be pigmented 

 or given a natural stone finish, but it is essential to 

 keep the colour light.

 Though the use of glass in such 

 a home is quite restricted, some amount of tinted or stained 

 glass is used to brighten up the space.

 Vivek points out a few furniture 

 facts for a Moroccan home: 

 The furniture should essentially 

 be low-back. Cedar 

 wood looks best ? it is intricately carved and exquisite. 

 Metal detailing like a 

 jaali design adds exotic appeal to the furniture. 

 Lots of bolsters and cushions 

 are essential. 

 Sunken leather bean bags raise the comfort quotient. 

 Flowy drapes in luxury 

 fabrics are a must. The 

 upholstery should be rich and flashy. Prints should 

 definitely be avoided and it is best to choose textured 

 or woven fabrics in silks and velvets. Other effective 

 lifts, suggests Charu, are exotic throws for the couches 

 and rugs for the floor.

 Wall wows 

 The walls, say interior experts, 

 play an important role in a Moroccan-style space. Creating 

 the suitable look and feel, mainly through the right choice 

 of colours and textures, walls can mean Morocco loud and 

 clear. 

 Preferred hues for the walls, 

 recommends Payal Sawhney of Perfect Finish that specialises 

 in wall and furniture effects, are bright, jewel tones. 

 Anything from maroon, Prussian 

 blue to burgundy looks great, she says.

 A typical Moroccan home flaunts 

 bright, distempered walls, the broken tile effect or stucco 

 on the wall. Also common are mosaic inlays. You can even 

 play with Moroccan motifs in stencilling. These have 

 a high Persian resemblance, are quite geometric and not 

 too flowy, elaborates Payal.

 Niches and alcoves in funky shapes 

 also lend the desired look, particularly if they are lined 

 with mosaic tiles.

 Add-on appeal

 Beauty truly lies in little details 

 and a Moroccan theme home reiterates this. Original 

 Moroccan homes set up near parched desert lands were devoid 

 of natural, beautiful surroundings. Hence it was necessary 

 to brighten up the ambience with vibrant decor pieces, 

 explains Vivek.

 Decorative accessories in the 

 form of lanterns, hookahs, artefacts and candles are just 

 right. Mosaic and glass beads are an inherent part 

 of a Moroccan piece, boasting an eclectic mix of reds, yellows 

 and oranges, explains Ajay Rawla, proprietor of Cocoon.

 Light, as always, plays a crucial 

 role in mood setting and more. Charu suggests introducing 

 accents in the form of lanterns ? both standing and hanging. 

 Lanterns help bring about the diffused effect and 

 candles, too, go a long way in adding glamour, she 

 says.

 Vivek suggests using beads effectively 

 in many corners of the house to add colour. As a wall-hanging, 

 chandelier or curtains, bead detailing is typical Morocco, 

 he says. 

 Rose petals scattered in a waterbody 

 also enhance the character of this theme home.

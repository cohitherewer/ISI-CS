The dress, stopping at the knee, often with a bubble 

hemline, has been the single most dominant silhouette on the Lakme Fashion Week 

ramp so far. It has made an appearance in almost every collection, in a variety 

of fabrics and cuts. There was some more of it on Thursday, Day III of the ongoing 

fashion gala in Mumbai.

While it was the dullest day of the week without a 

single big name showcasing, it, however, reiterated the trend loud and clear. 

The knee-length dress almost entirely made up the spring-summer collection of 

French label Leonard of Paris showcased at the NCPA ramp on Thursday evening.

Empire, coat, trapeze, tent dresses came in a variety 

of forms, in fabrics ranging from terry cloth, silk jersey, chiffon, organza and 

more. The line, divided into various looks, also had beach minis, floor-length 

loungers, long gowns, jackets and bodices.

From exotic blooms to multi-hued stripes and abstracts, 

prints dominated the line, along with some made in Mumbai embroidery. 

The florals were in hues of orange, vanilla, purple, violet, aqua, fuchsia, grey, 

mostly on white bases, and the palette moved to brighter reds, fuchsias, browns 

and oranges with the evening glamour look. Rounded sleeves, wrapped uppers, belts 

with buckles bearing an orchid (the labels emblem) were the highlights.

The other French label that shared the show Nathalie 

Garcon opened with a knee-length white lace dress Indianised with a churidar 

and followed it with a wrap-skirt and jacket worn over the churidar. Nathalies 

line was highly stylised, and she played around with various colour stories. The 

whites and off-whites were followed by some slate grey linen suits. Colour was 

introduced with gypsy skirts and sun dresses in vibrant shades, played down with 

cream and black. Summer dresses, layered gypsy skirts, bikinis, sarongs, slim 

skirts, structured jackets and pyjama trousers made up an eclectic set. 

I design for very feminine women and I definitely 

see a market in India. I am very excited to have showcased here, especially since 

this is a very fashion-conscious country. Unlike many countries where one sees 

just foreign fashion, India has a strong designer community, observed Nathalie. 

Daniel from Leonard echoed: After having spent a few days in India, I have 

sensed a market here. I think in three years, French labels will be available 

in India. Both designers were all praise for Indian fabrics and embroidery 

used extensively in their collections.

Back to the dress rage, debutante designer Deepti 

Toor presented a collection full of them in her show earlier on Thursday. Her 

label Design Toor by Calcutta-based R amp;B Enterprises presented a strikingly 

international look with an array of knee-length dresses, along with some slim 

short skirts.

The designer unveiled a collection with clean lines, 

sans embellishments. Whites and off-whites, pale pinks and greens dominated the 

subdued palette. The inspiration of Mughal miniature paintings was reflected in 

the Indian prints. The fabrics were cotton and silk blends developed in Bengal 

handlooms.

Sharing the show with Deepti was the label Rahul amp; 

Firdos, who had also showcased with her at the GeNext show in April. The duo presented 

a girlie line in pretty pastels. 

Khan clan

While Thursday went star-free, Friday afternoon saw 

some filmi footfall as the Khan bahu Seema (Sohails wife) made her 

fashion week debut. The front row was taken over by the brothers Khan (Salman, 

Arbaaz and Sohail) with mom Helen. Also showing solidarity were Amrita Arora, 

Neelam Kothari, Sonali Bendre and Rhea Pillai. Malaika finished the show for her 

sister-in-law with a flourish on the ramp in a shimmery white dress. 

Seemas collection was split into six different 

looks, with dresses predominant. The silhouettes were sexy and feminine, and the 

highlights were empire cuts, high waistlines, gold embellishments, lace trimmings, 

mirrors, crystals, stones and jewels. The show started with a range of resort 

wear in multi-hued wave prints on mul, and broad mirror-worked belts. 

The second line had wool edging and floral wool detailing 

on beige and khaki bases. The third line of summery mul dresses with vibrant 

floral prints in reds, purples and turquoise did not impress. The next line carried 

pretty much the same look, with bright florals on black with ribbons. The fifth 

line in multi-coloured stripes looked breezy and beach, with funky under-bust 

belts. A collection in pastel lemon and green with Swarovski belts finished the 

line.

I design depending on the wearers personality; 

I believe the woman should wear the clothes and not the other way round, 

smiled Seema, who has designed Malaikas wardrobe for Nach Baliye.

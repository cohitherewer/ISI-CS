The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 A starry night

 Screen On amp; Off 

 home bound: Bipasha Basu 

 Come Saturday evening and Science City auditorium will play host to the annual celebration of Tollywood and Bollywood Fairever Anandalok Puroshkar 2006. The awards gala will see some of the freshest talents from Mumbai mingling with the very best of the local industry.

 The star of the night will definitely be Bipasha Basu who has had a magic year in 2006 with the critical acclaim for Corporate and the mass hysteria caused by her dance numbers in Omkara. And with Dhoom 2, where she plays Bengali babe Shonali Bose, less than a week away, all eyes will be on Bips at the Fairever Anandalok night.

 Director Rakesh Roshan, still basking in the success of Krrish, has confirmed his presence.

 Also coming in from Mumbai will be Kangana Ranaut whose performances in Gangster and Woh Lamhe have placed her in the big league of actresses in tinsel town.

 Amrita Rao, who has won a lot of hearts with Sooraj Barjatyas Vivah, will be here too. And so will Upen Patel, who stormed many a young heart with his bare-bodied act in 36 China Town.

 The star-studded evening will witness some great performances. The singer of the evening will be K.K. who will belt out popular numbers like Pal, Dus bahane, Tu hi shab hai, Kya yeh pyar hai...

 Also coming in to perform for the evening from Mumbai will be telly stars Eijaz Khan and Shveta Salve. The two will be dancing to the celebratory theme of 75 years of playback singing.

 Tollywoods hero number one Prosenjit will take the stage with other local stars to pay a tribute to Bengali film music through the years.

 There will also be a separate section for the Nayikar Khonje contest that Anandalok had conducted a while back.

 Reason enough for all roads to lead to Sciene City on Saturday evening.

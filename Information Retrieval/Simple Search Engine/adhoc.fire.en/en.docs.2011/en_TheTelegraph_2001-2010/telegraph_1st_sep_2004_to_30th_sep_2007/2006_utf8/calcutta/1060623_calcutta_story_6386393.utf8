The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Palms, alms 

 and the man

 Metro sees that very little 

 has changed with bribe-taking on Brabourne Road

 Burrabazar-Brabourne 

 Road crossing, April 11, 2005

 Metro had spotted home 

 guards stopping small commercial vehicles in the bustle 

 of Burrabazar. The following day, walkie-talkie-toting plainclothesmen 

 were caught in the act. The bribe-taking process was as 

 smooth as the traffic was chaotic. A home guard was suspended, 

 but not the practice.

 Burrabazar-Brabourne 

 Road crossing, June 21

 More than a year later, on the 

 longest day of 2006, the long arm of the law was seen reaching 

 out to every passing thela and van. A plainclothesman 

 was busy grabbing whatever came his way, in cash or coin. 

 The bribe amount: Rs 5 to Rs 50. ?A policeman stands at 

 the crossing and every passing vehicle has to pay its way 

 through,? said a van-puller.

 Who?s 

 the bribe-taker?

 There are eight to 10 special 

 constables in each police station. Their job is to mingle 

 and collect information. ?In areas like Burrabazar, Posta 

 and Shyambazar, these special constables collect bribes, 

 especially from cycle-van drivers. This is an open secret 

 and senior officers are well aware of it,? said an officer 

 of Burrabazar police station. On any given day, a special 

 constable at the crossing pockets Rs 300 to Rs 400. At the 

 end of the day, they gang up and divide the loot. ?But every 

 month, they have to gift something to their seniors,? added 

 the officer.

 Officialspeak

 Amiya Kumar Lahiri, officer-in-charge, 

 Burrabazar thana: ?As far as I know, special constables 

 are not involved in such a practice. But some constables 

 of the traffic guard do take bribes from these cycle-van 

 drivers. There are also some constables posted at other 

 police stations but staying on at the Burrabazar barracks 

 who pocket bribes.?

 CMspeak

 This (bribe-taking) is nothing 

 new. But since some specific spots have been mentioned (in 

 Metro), I have asked them (his force) to find out,? 

 said Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, home (police) minister.

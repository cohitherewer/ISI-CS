 Mission unveils course

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A degree course in physiotherapy was inaugurated at the Ramakrishna Mission Seva Pratishthan on Thursday. 

 The first session of the four-and-a-half-year course starts from September 1 with 10 students. The hospital also has plans to start a degree course in optometry.

 Physiotherapy is now a subject in itself, said Swami Sarvalokananda, secretary of the Seva Pratishthan and the Vivekananda Institute of Medical Sciences.

 Experts estimate that around 60 per cent of the citys population suffer from ailments that require physiotherapy. 

 Spondylosis, arthritis, post-cerebral attack and other neurological diseases leading to paralysis are on the rise, said Alok Roy Chaudhuri, course coordinator and head of the physiotherapy department at the Seva Pratishthan.

 Addressing a programme at the hospital, director of medical education Jayasree Mitra said the 40-70 age group is most vulnerable to diseases requiring physiotherapy.

 Swami Sarvalokananda urged the state government to ensure that private medical colleges charge affordable fees from students. Mitra said a proposal has been sent to the fee structuring committee of the higher education department. They will take a decision after a proper study.

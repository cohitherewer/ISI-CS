 An author, a former model, a television hostess, a party person and now a fashion ideator. Many facets of Shobhaa De, the lady who has dabbled in all this and more and is now being seen in the brand new role of design consultant.

 Genesis Colors Pvt Ltd, the parent company of Satya Paul, has undertaken a unique fashion initiative spearheaded by Shobhaa De, a Satya Paul loyalist for years. The company has invited her to handpick a few designers she would like to associate with, endorse and share her creative sensibilities with.

 The result is a collection of four new lines by designers Bibi Russell from Bangladesh, Neena Rana from Punjab, Sonal Mehta from Gujarat and the label Ravage by designers Raj and Neetu from Bangalore.

 The collection will be retailed from the companys chain of lifestyle stores called Samsara that has branches in Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore. 

 Launched in Samsara, Delhi, a while ago, the second stop for the collection is the Satya Paul store in Forum, Calcutta, where the collection was unveiled last week. It will then travel to the Samsara stores in Mumbai and Bangalore.

 I started my career as one of Indias first-generation models and hence the fashion world is nothing new for me. I have been informally associated with the Indian fashion industry for a long time, and now Im doing it officially, Shobhaa told GoodLife.

 She then elaborated upon her role: I identified designers I respect and associate with, people with whom my aesthetics match. For instance, Bibi (Russell) is one person I respect a lot because she doesnt see fashion in isolation, theres a firm focus on fashion for development. Similarly, with the other three designers, too, I associate with their principles in some way or the other. In fact, I am lucky that I found such people.

 It was Bibis pieces of art from Jamdanis to Kotas, Neenas Phulkari work, Sonals Parsee garas and the serendipity of Ravage that attracted Shobhaa.

 Once the designers were chosen, the combined process of creation began. I sat with each designer and we together brainstormed on the design idea ? the inspiration, the colours, the patterns and every other aspect. Finally, we together came up with a collection that both of us can endorse with pride.

 Sanjay Kapoor, managing director of Genesis Colors, explained why Shobhaa was an obvious choice for such a venture. As someone who has not just monitored fashion trends in India and abroad for three decades, but also mirrored them, besides projecting her own very distinct style, it was a logical step for us at Satya Paul to invite Shobhaa to share her aesthetics with a larger audience. This will be an ongoing process wherein Shobhaa and Genesis Colors will engage in creative collaboration with fashion designers, painters, jewellery and accessory designers.

 The next step of this ongoing process is a collection by husband-wife designer duo Abhishek and Nandita Basu in October. 

 We have actually finalised the next three collections. Apart from big names like Nandita and Abhishek, I am also working with some young talent who dont get their due in this crowded designer market, said Shobhaa.

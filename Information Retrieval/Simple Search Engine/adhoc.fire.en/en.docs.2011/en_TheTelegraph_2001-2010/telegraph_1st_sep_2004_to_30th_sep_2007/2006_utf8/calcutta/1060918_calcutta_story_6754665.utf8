How to tame your boss and rule your subordinates 

the topic was interesting enough to ensure a handsome turnout of more than 100 

TCS (Tata Consultancy Services) professionals at The Corporate GoodLife Talk 

Show on September 15.

And it turned out, as Rajashri Chakraborty put it, 

to be a good experience. Quite different from the tech quizzes 

and activities that we usually have. We are looking forward to more such discussions, 

said the participant. 

Held at the TCS auditorium in Sector V, Salt Lake, 

the one-hour session had Barun Das, company secretary and legal adviser of Exide 

Industries Ltd, as the guest speaker.

Moderator Rita Bhimani began rather philosophically: 

Its a topsy-turvy world. When we ask for advice, do we ask for approval... 

Does taming your boss actually mean refining him?

Barun took off from there. He hit it off with the 

audience instantly. His humour was subtle yet effective, the one-liners were witty 

and the strategies realistic.

The discussion, however, seemed to stress dealing 

with boss issues more than anything else. 

Bosses are of different kinds, Barun pointed out. 

Some who say join us and we will scale heights together, some 

who are point-blank enough to state sorry Im a foreboding guy, 

some who look at you without blinking and, finally, the super boss, she who wears 

the pants in the family!

Then, it was time for some serious talk. Remember, 

the boss is always right. The situation for the subordinate is tight. If he speaks 

his mind he crosses his boundaries, if he does not, he is not imaginative, 

pointed out Barun. 

The prescription from doc Das: Start 

with boss I think you said But above all, deal with your 

boss as you deal with your girlfriend, smiled Barun.

Is it right to run household errands for the boss 

at the risk of being called a chamcha, asked Rita.I havent 

come across anyone who would not love to please his boss. The way to the bosss 

heart is the bosss wife, replied Barun, to loud laughter.

What happens when a special relationship develops? 

Never get into such relations. It will only lead to disasters, was 

Baruns honest advice. In the case of a female boss, treat her as a 

boss and not a lady.

In between, there was a quiz round that had participants 

cracking questions related to The Telegraph. 

Then, it was back to beat-the-boss basics from Barun. 

What happens when the boss makes a wrong move causing immense damage to the company? 

Persuasion. Try telling your bosss boss. If nothing works, resign.

The dynamics of the boss-subordinate relationship 

were summed up thus: It is like a relationship between mother-in-law and 

daughter-in-law (saas bhi kabhi bahu thi) The boss faced it all when 

he was a subordinate. Moreover, there is the insecurity of being overshadowed 

by a young subordinate.

Finally, what are the changes in the system you would 

make if you had the power? Pat came the reply: I might talk about a lot 

of changes now, but how many of us practice what we preach?

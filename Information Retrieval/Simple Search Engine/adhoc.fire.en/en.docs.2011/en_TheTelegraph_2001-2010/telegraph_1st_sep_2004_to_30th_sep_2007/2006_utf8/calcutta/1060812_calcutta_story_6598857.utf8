 Sanction for car park trio

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has decided to sanction three more commercial parking bays, with a total capacity for 1,600 cars.

 The parking lots will come up as private ventures on Shakespeare Sarani, near Science City, and opposite the Salt Lake stadium on the EM Bypass.

 According to the civic building department, the facility near Science City will hold 1,000 cars. The ones opposite the stadium and on Shakespeare Sarani will house 400 and 200 vehicles, respectively.

 The CMC will soon invite offers from private entrepreneurs to prepare a panel of six technically-capable and financially-sound agencies for at least a dozen parking projects.

 Municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay said on Friday that only firms with modern technology will be included on the panel.

 Parking problem is more acute than waterlogging. Parking is a round-the-year headache, while waterlogging occurs hardly 12 days a year, said mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya.

 The CMC has no land to set up parking lots and there is no scope for further increasing roadside parking space. The only option before the civic authorities is to attract private players to open parking bays.

 The chief engineer (civil) and deputy chief engineer (planning) have been asked to give an estimate of the number of parking lots required for the city, said Bandyopadhyay.

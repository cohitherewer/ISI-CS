 Verse rendezvous

 Poetic expressions are perhaps the best manifestation of a traveller in quest of the ideal. Exemplifying this truth, the poetry of Avik Chanda, with its myriad emotions, allusions and illusions, places the young poet in a class of his own. Crossword Bookstore and Protibhash present an evening of his poetry, read by ideator Sujoy Prosad Chatterjee and veteran actor and advertising personality Barun Chanda. While the former expresses the poets personal feelings through pieces that reflect his tryst with solitude and pain, the latter offers various perspectives of his imagery. Selected from Jokhon Bideshe, an anthology of Bengali poems that marks his debut, the poems were written, as their title suggests, during the years that Chanda spent abroad, mainly in Europe and the UK. Although some of them were inspired by personal experiences, stray allusions and sketches, running as a common thread of reference throughout the collection, reflect the poets interest in Western art and history. Filmmaker Sandip Ray will release the anthology. Author Shankarlal Bhattacharya will also participate.

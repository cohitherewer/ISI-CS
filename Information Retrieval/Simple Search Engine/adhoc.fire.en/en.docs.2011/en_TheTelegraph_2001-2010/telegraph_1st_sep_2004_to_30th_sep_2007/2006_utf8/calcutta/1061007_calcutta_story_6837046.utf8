 The post-mortem on Deepesh Singh, found unconscious in a car on Wednesday evening and later declared dead, has found traces of a brown liquid in the teenagers stomach.

 The report, received on Friday, stated there were no injury marks on the body. A liquid was found in the stomach. The exact cause of death can be known only after the viscera test report arrives from the forensic science laboratory, said an officer of New Alipore police station.

 An hour-long interrogation on Friday afternoon found Sohail Chaudhury who was found unconscious in the drivers seat of his car, with Deepesh by his side contradicting some of his earlier statements to police.

 Sohail, still in hospital, told cops on Friday that he had called Deepesh on his mobile phone around 12.35 am on Wednesday. Deepesh was in his paan shop and Sohail said he would reach the shop in half an hour.

 He left his New Alipore flat in his Opel Astra and reached the shop around 1.30 am. He woke up Deepesh and took a pack of cigarettes from him.

 They waited for Suraj, who turned up after 15 minutes. All three then got into the car, Deepesh sitting next to Sohail and Suraj, who works in nearby garage, in the rear seat.

 Sohail drove to Park Street, where they dropped in at a party in a friends house. They left after half an hour and went to Camac Street, where they bought mineral water bottles and some snacks.

 After visiting Park Circus and Ballygunge, they headed back home.

 Suraj got off at Alipore Mint around 4.15 am, saying he would meet them after half an hour. Sohail parked the car in the garage on the ground floor of his three-storeyed apartment block and remained in the vehicle with Deepesh.

 I was feeling dizzy and fell unconscious. I do not know what happened after that, Sohail told police.

 Elaborating on the points of contradiction, an officer said Sohail did not tell police on Thursday that they had gone to Park Street to attend a late-night party. 

 Also, he had said they had come back at 2.45 am and it was then that Suraj left, the officer added.

 Police now feel that this is not an open-and-shut case. Sohail had called several persons from his mobile phone that night. We have taken down the numbers,. an officer disclosed.

 Police are yet to trace Suraj, the missing link in the mystery death. We raided his house in Behala, but he was not there, added the officer.

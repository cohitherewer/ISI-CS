The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You share your birthday with...

 Jet Li You are an ideas person who 

 needs constant opportunities to apply yourself. You firmly 

 believe that determination and persistence guarantee success. 

 You work best when you can perform at your own pace and 

 be creative with the job. You don?t share your innermost 

 thoughts with others and are pretty secretive about your 

 personal life and plans. ? Kusum Bhandari

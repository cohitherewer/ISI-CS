 Bulge battle bane

 AN HOUR-GLASS FIGURE 

 MIGHT BE GREAT TO FLAUNT, BUT ACHIEVING IT THROUGH RANDOM 

 WEIGHT-LOSS PROGRAMMES SURE COMES WITH ITS OWN SHARE OF PROBLEMS, 

 FINDS OUT SHRADHA AGARWAL

 No woman can be too thin or too 

 rich, believes designer Anamika Khanna. And with that begins 

 the battle of the bulge (sometimes the invisible, non-existent 

 bulge is also drawn into battle).

 The victory in this furious fight 

 sometimes comes with a non-value-added tax ? low blood pressure, 

 anaemic conditions, skin sorrow, gynaecological issues and 

 a host of other general health worries, hand in hand with 

 strict weight-loss regimens. 

 GoodLife focuses on the 

 lesser-known evils that you might encounter on the way to 

 weight loss. 

 While we often associate 

 high fashion with skinny women, most designers create 

 with real people in mind; (below) Nina Manuel has a

 In the mind

 A long-term relationship with 

 a weight-loss plan can cause severe emotional stress, sometimes 

 even surpassing the turmoil of a bad break-up. 

 This happens because most 

 people are weighed down by a very tough task ? the task 

 of sustaining the lost weight, says psychiatrist Dr 

 Shiladitya Ray. This can lead to one of these two situations... 

 Situation 1: The diet plan 

 is so deeply engraved in the system that it makes it impossible 

 to let go. 

 Result: An averse reaction 

 to food at all times. This often leads to an anxio-depressive 

 state due to constant pressure of maintaining the new weight 

 youve achieved, says Ray.

 Situation 2: A constant 

 desire to give in to all kinds of forbidden food. 

 Result: Over-the-top binges 

 at the slightest opportunity, often surreptitiously. This 

 paradoxical reaction stems from temptation at the sub-conscious 

 level, adds the psychiatrist.

 The solution, he adds, most often 

 lies in single-session counselling. Here the patient 

 is explained the importance of self-motivation, judging 

 and understanding himself/herself. It is essential for them 

 to learn to live a life of moderation. 

 Figure flaw

 One tends to associate high fashion 

 with skinny women, but the fact is most designers create 

 with real people in mind. Just fabric hanging 

 over a body sans curves is hardly ever a pretty sight.

 Never slim down enough to 

 look anorexic and starved, says Anamika. 

 Though she admits that the fashion 

 industry is all for the-thinner-the-better look, Anamika 

 doesnt advocate any form of extremes. Her advice: 

 Dont stress on just looking thin, instead focus 

 on feeling fit and looking it. 

 Model and choreographer Nayanika 

 Chatterjee agrees: Its extremely sad that the 

 world over the trend is tilted towards very thin girls. 

 But I would prefer to pick a girl with awesome attitude. 

 Her body should be toned rather than simply twiggy, 

 she says. A perfect example, she adds, is model Nina Manuel. 

 Thankfully, models today have learnt the right art 

 to stay thin ? frequenting the gym instead of all-day starving, 

 adds Nayanika.

 Skin sorrow

 Dieting might manage to give you 

 a thin body (proportionate or not is debatable) but hardly 

 ever without a pack of skin-related problems. 

 Most common, says Dr Shikha Sharma, 

 is skin dryness, pigmentation and hair loss. All this 

 is due to lack of proper nutrients and calcium in the diet 

 plan, she adds. 

 Did you know that dropping too 

 much weight could come in the way of regular beauty services 

 like threading? This happens due to loss of under-skin 

 fat, making it tough to thread, says Shikha. 

 Dr Arun K. Prasad, dermatologist 

 at Nova clinic on Sarat Bose Road, lists some more not-so-common 

 problems that might accompany weight loss and offers some 

 solutions. 

 Appearance of stretch marks. Theres no scientific 

 documentation yet, but stretch marks can arise in certain 

 situations. Possible treatments are glycolic acid 

 application, micro-dermabrasion or chemical peels.

 Cellulite emergence. Cellulite is basically fibrous 

 bands that pull the epidermis towards the subcutaneous 

 fat layer. After weight loss, goosebump-like cellulite 

 may appear. Treat with mesotherapy that involves 

 injecting certain chemicals.

 Wrinkling, quite common in the late 30-40 age bracket. 

 A fatter person is less likely to show wrinkles, 

 but once the weight goes down these may suddenly come 

 up. Possible remedies are botox injections, derma 

 fillers, chemical peels and special creams.

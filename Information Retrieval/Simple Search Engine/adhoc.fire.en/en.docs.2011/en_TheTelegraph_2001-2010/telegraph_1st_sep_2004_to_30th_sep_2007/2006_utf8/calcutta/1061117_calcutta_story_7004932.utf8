 Caution on funds waiver

 - Forgoing aid no shield against interference, schools warned

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 For the past year, Christian missionaries have been on agitations to protect the minority rights of their schools against alleged state interference.

 Now, they have launched a campaign to convince the schools not to forgo the state assistance in order to pre-empt intervention by the education department.

 Bangiya Christiya Pariseba, an organisation of Christian missionaries, and the Association of Christian Schools have issued an appeal to the schools not to surrender the financial help from the government in the form of dearness allowance or salary.

 Members of the organisations said some missionary schools are harbouring a misconception that forgoing state assistance would make them immune to government regulation, which is being sought to be formalised through a bill.

 Father Faustine Brank, vice-president of the Parisebas education cell, said the government had clarified that the proposed piece of legislation would apply to both aided and unaided schools.

 We have come to know that the founder-bodies of some of the schools believe that the government will not be able to intervene in their internal matter if they surrender the state assistance. Such an impression is not based on facts and can lead to confusion, said Father Brank. 

 School education minister Partha De had said at a recent meeting with Christian groups that the bill, seeking to empower the government to exert minimum control over missionary schools, would be based on suggestions from the institutions themselves.

 The government now provides financial aid to over 700 missionary schools in two forms. Some schools, like the Anglo-Indian ones that are affiliated to the ICSE board, get only the dearness allowance of their teachers and employees from the government.

 Several other schools, mostly those that are affiliated to the state education board or council, are provided with the full salaries of their employees.

 Reverend P.S.P. Raju, bishop of the Calcutta diocese of the Church of North India, however, said no Christian school is planning to surrender the government assistance.

 Two years ago, nine reputed Anglo-Indian schools under the Calcutta diocese had forgone dearness allowance for their employees from the state.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 We are the world, this is our Puja

 The Telegraph Hand in Hand, in association with Tata Sky and co-sponsored by Coca-Cola, ends on a sweet note with families at housing estates giving a thumbs up to its Puja package of piety and pleasure 

 In ecstasy: On a rainy Ashtami afternoon, spirited residents of Bidyakut Abasan joined an impromptu dance session set to Shadher Lau Banailo More Boiragi. Songs and a play will be performed at the estate in Narayanpur at the Bijoya Sammilani function 

Just a week before the Pujas, incessant rain, waterlogged streets and half-done pandals had dampened festive spirits. With a series of fun activities and contests, The Telegraph Hand in Hand revived the festive feel in 97 housing estates across the city and suburbs, bonding family members and neighbours.

 As Dipak Das Sharma, general secretary of Cluster 13 of Purbachal Housing Estate, in Salt Lake, said: Earlier, people used to just hang around at the para pandal most of the time. These days, they tend to stay indoors watching television or visit relatives in other parts of the city. The events organised by The Telegraph Hand in Hand changed that. We all stayed put at the pandal for long hours participating in the events. In the process, we got to know our neighbours better.

 The events also turned the spotlight on individuals who selflessly slogged to bring more joy to others on the festive occasion. Be it the community lunch or the cultural programme, one could always find the likes of Sikha Chowdhury of Neelachal Abasan taking charge. She not only put the kids through the paces for Abol Tabol, but also arranged the programme of Hindi songs.

 Towering tall: Only one-fourth of the population at Merlin Estate on Diamond Harbour Road is Bengali. But with the active involvement of all the residents, the Puja was as Bengali as could be. On Ashtami, T-shirt painting, dandiya, DJ night and Jodi Kamaal Ki were the top draws

The mix of rituals and revelry went down well with the cosmopolitan crowd at the residential estates. Subhash Murarka of Shree Krishna Gardens, in Beleghata, held forth about the active participation of all the residents, despite the small Bengali population.

 In residential estates, most families lead isolated lives, especially the nuclear families. Neighbours hardly get an opportunity to interact with each other. The cultural and social events during the Puja fill the gap. As Swaraj Das of Aelite Cooperative Housing Society said: The Pujas are an opportunity for us all to come together as one big family. Whether it is the community lunches or the choice of cultural programmes, everyone chips in with their contribution.

 Red FM organised the antakshari at some of the housing estates, while STAR Ananda telecast Hand in Hand events. Besides the spot quiz, antakshari, dhunuchi naach and shankho baadon, many estates had innovative events as well. I am practising for the ulu dhwani contest this evening. I liked it very much last year. It is a novel event, said Ajanta Dutta, a home-maker in AH Block of Salt Lake.

 The youngsters who generally prefer pandal-hopping to confining themselves to their localities, joined in with gusto as the contests gave them the chance to bag prizes. I won two pens in the Sera Uttar contest. I had to write down the names of the World Cup finalists on a piece of paper and drop it in a box. I won the prize by lottery, said Dwaipayan Ghosh, a Class IV student of Assembly of Angels and a resident of CMDA Nagar Abasik Brinda, in Barrackpore.

 I participated in a dandiya session and loved it. It was open to all above the age of six years, Sayoni Batabyal, a Class XII student of Kendriya Vidyalaya, Salt Lake, said after being adjudged the winner of the event.

 One for all: Although it is the first Puja at Shree Krishna Gardens on Raja Rajendralal Mitra Road, the pandal was abuzz with activity through the festive days. From Rabindrasangeet on Sashthi to dandiya on Ashtami, a packed event roster found active participation from all residents, including a Chinese family

The grown-ups also enjoyed themselves thoroughly. Sushmita Dutta, a member of the winning team in antakshari at Green Valley Housing Complex in Kaikhali, was a first-time participant. Her team sailed to victory on their repertoire of Hindi film numbers and golden oldies. Dutta, who teaches in the junior section of North Point Senior Secondary School, in Rajarhat, said: We came without any preparation, but were very glad to have been a part of this event. I look forward to participating in more such contests in future.

 Those who had participated in The Telegraph Hand in Hand last year were excited to take part the second time. Arnab Das of Sri Aurobindo Institute of Education who received first prize at the sit-and-draw at EB Block Central Government Residential Complex was glad to have won the contest. This year was an improvement on last years when I had come second. We had to draw a village scenery this time. That came easily to me, although I prefer doing portraits. For this art student who has passed his fourth year of art school with distinction, the contest is a stepping stone to further efforts. He also plans to participate in dhunuchi naach on Navami although he has no prior experience. I just plan to enjoy myself.

 Madhabi Biswas of Swarnika, in Shakuntala Park, has been winning the shankho baadon contest for the last two years. The employee of the Eastern Railway Audit Service, who participated the first time out of curiosity, said: Caught up in the pace of life, we have become so stereotyped. The contest brings people closer to traditional practices. Blowing non-stop for 45 seconds, she clinched the first prize this year as well although, as she admits, I dont usually blow the conch, except during a puja in the family perhaps.

 Bless you: Youngsters line up for prasad after Ashtami rsquo;s puja at Old Dog Race Course Housing. Dhunuchi naach on Dashami evening will bring the curtains down on a series of fun events at the estate in Sahapur

The events at the estates were organised keeping in mind the changing tastes of the residents. As Das of Aelite Cooperative Housing Society said: We try to accommodate the wishes of the residents when planning the cultural events. While Bengali songs are preferred by the older generation, youngsters are fond of jibonmukhi gaan and English numbers.

 Newly married Antara Banerjee, who received first prize for the Puja Fashion contest, takes her fashion very seriously. For her, it is more to do with leaving a lasting impression than with showcasing the latest designs. Her couture line-up for this year included a zardosi in turquoise, embellished with stone work. Taken entirely by surprise at having won the contest, Banerjee, who used to design at her mothers boutique, said: It is possible to dress beautifully yet inexpensively. From a fashion-oriented family (her sister-in-law is a student at NIFT), this young woman says that she would love to participate in such events in future.

 Durga puja has changed. At housing estates, residents celebrate it differently, with new forms of entertainment and participation. But the sentiment and the warmth remain the same to look forward to next year!

Basu Chowdhury: My employer is not helping me in getting my ESI membership number. At the same time, he is deducting a part of my salary for the insurance cover.

 This is a common problem with many employees. In the past, we have taken strict steps against a few employers and organisations. Earlier this month, we had issued a notice against a city-based company for violating the norms. 

 You should lodge a complaint with our complaint cell or the regional director. We will conduct a probe. If we find that your allegations are true, we will issue a showcause notice on the employer or the authorities of the organisation and take necessary action against the company, if it fails to provide us with a satisfactory explanation.

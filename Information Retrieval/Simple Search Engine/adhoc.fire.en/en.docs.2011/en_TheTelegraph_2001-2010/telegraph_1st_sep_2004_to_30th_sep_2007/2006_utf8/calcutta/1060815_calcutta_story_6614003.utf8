The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 On guard against terrorist neighbour

 PRONAB MONDAL

 Two people have recently rented a house in our locality. I have found their movements very suspicious I have noticed that several unknown people visit their house and I suspect that they are part of a terrorist outfit. I think they plan to carry out subversive activities on Independence Day. A responsible citizen of India.

 Calcutta Police have received a bunch of such anonymous letters in the run-up to Independence Day 2006. Most warn the cops of massive destructive activities on August 15.

 Following an alert by the central home ministry, police are taking the missives seriously and conducting checks on the people suspected to be terrorists.

 So far, we have not unearthed any plot. All those named as suspects were found to be innocent and have been living in the city with valid documents, said deputy commissioner of police (headquarters) Pradip Chatterjee.

 Our investigations have revealed that the letters are more often than not the fallout of personal rivalries, he observed.

 According to Chatterjee, police receive similar letters before each Republic Day and Independence Day. The writers always complain against people in their locality. Earlier, too, we used to swing into action. But we have not come across a terrorist plot once.

 An officer of the anti-terrorist wing of Calcutta Police added: Though an alert was sounded by the Centre after the serial blasts in Mumbai, we reacted differently this time. Instead of picking up those named in the complaints, we conducted checks on them secretly..

 Chatterjee explained the shift in strategy: The complainants want to harass those against whom they hold a grudge. If we pick up the people named in the letters, it serves the purpose of the writer.

 As in the past few years, the cops have received more than 15 letters on the eve of Independence Day. At least 40 people were identified in the notes as terrorists planning a strike on August 15. Not a single writer has been tracked down.

 Though it is not impossible for us to track down the complainants, we never initiate the move as it is a time-consuming process. Even if we trace them, what will we do with them? asked a senior officer at Lalbazar police headquarters.

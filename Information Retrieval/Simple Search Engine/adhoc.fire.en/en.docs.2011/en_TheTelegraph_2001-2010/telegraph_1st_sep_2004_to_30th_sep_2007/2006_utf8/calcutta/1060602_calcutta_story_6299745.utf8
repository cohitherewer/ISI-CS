 Heritage head

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Governor Gopal Krishna Gandhi will oversee beautification of BBD Bag, now a heritage zone, and also riverfront development as ex officio chairman of the Calcutta Tercentenary Committee. 

 The governor will head projects 

 linked to beautification of the stretch between BBD Bag 

 and Shahid Minar, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee 

 said on Thursday. ?The projects will include traffic management, 

 hawker eviction and development of the Hooghly riverfront.?

 Earlier, mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya had announced that hawking would not be allowed in the heritage zone. ?On humanitarian grounds, however, we are trying to find out which of the 21 crossings, where hawking is allowed, can be used for relocation of these street vendors.?

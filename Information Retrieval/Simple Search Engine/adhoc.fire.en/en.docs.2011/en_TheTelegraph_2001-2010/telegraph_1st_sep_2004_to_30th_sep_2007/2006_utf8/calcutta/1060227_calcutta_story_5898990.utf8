The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Get court nod for plot sale

 ABDUR REZZAK MOLLAH, state land and land reforms minister, met readers of The Telegraph last week to answer their queries. Participants included Rahul Roy, Md Aamiruzzaman, Sandip Banerjee, Subhadyuti Datta, Amirul Islam, Chanchal Gupta, Swapan Datta Gupta and Sujoy Das

Chanchal Gupta: Buyers of land are often cheated by brokers and a section of lawyers. How helpful is the 12-year court searching certificate in this respect?

 The court-searching report of a property can tell you whether it is disputed or not. In order to know the status of a plot, you must visit the block land and land reforms office. If everything else is in order, consult the local civic authority to find out whether the building plan has been sanctioned or not.

Subhadyuti Datta: The valuation of a plot of land or a building is done arbitrarily at the time of registration. The registrars often extort money through stamp duty.

 Land acquisition is done by the land and land reforms department, but the finance department looks after its registration. I admit there is lack of transparency in respect of stamp duty. Due to this, people living in the rural areas have stopped registering the sale deeds.

Swapan Datta Gupta: Can a sebait transfer the deity?s property to someone else by sale deed, lease deed or gift deed, or hand it over to a promoter for development?

 No. Sebaits obtain limited right of residence by performing seba puja of the deity, who is the absolute owner of the property. It will be a bad purchase to procure such a property since the buyer can never get it mutated in his name. If flats are erected on such a plot, the owners will never be able to obtain the title rights. Government offices and banks will not sanction a loan for buying such a flat.

Sandip Banerjee: Promoters have started constructing apartment buildings by reclaiming land from the Hooghly. Several estates have come up on reclaimed land, between Calcutta and Serampore. The promoters are claiming that a portion of their plots had been eroded by the river and they are merely reclaiming it. Is this practice legal? Will it not cause a serious damage to the environment?

 The practice is illegal. The reclaimed land belongs to the government. We have enacted a bill in 1981, under which a plot, whoever be its owner, once eroded by a river is treated as vested land. If it resurfaces due to natural causes or otherwise, it is treated as the government?s property. It is dangerous for the environment to allow reclaiming to continue.

Md Aamiruzzaman: What?s the total area of land in Calcutta that has remained locked under Thika Tenancy Act?

 The total area locked under Thika Tenancy Act, 1982, in the 60 wards in Calcutta is about 565 bigha. A thorough survey of thika land would push up the figure to 1,100 bigha.

Md Aamiruzzaman: What is the difference between Premises Tenancy Act and Thika Tenancy Act?

 Broadly speaking, Premises Tenancy Act strives to safeguard the interest of both the landlords and the tenants. On the other hand, the jurisdiction of Thika Tenancy Act does not extend beyond city limits. Those who had been paying land tax to the zamindars for habitation or for running khatals, were brought under its purview. 

Rahul Roy: Is there a map of the East Calcutta Wetlands?

 The environment department prepared a land use map after an aerial survey of the wetlands. 

Sujoy Das: Without a watchdog, will it be possible to preserve the wetlands?

 At the moment, we lack the administrative infrastructure to preserve the wetlands. Otherwise, so many bheris would not have been filled up. I have ordered that there should be no conversion of plots on the wetland from now on.

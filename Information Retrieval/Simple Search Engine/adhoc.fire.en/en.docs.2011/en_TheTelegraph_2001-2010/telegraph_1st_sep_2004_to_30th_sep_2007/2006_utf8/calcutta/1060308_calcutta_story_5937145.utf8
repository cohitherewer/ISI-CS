 Boutique hospitality

 ZEESHAN JAWED

 Personalised service, cosy corners and Turkish delights ? Housez 43 at 43, Mirza Ghalib Street started serving its slice of Europeana from Tuesday.

 The 28-room hospitality address is all set to create value in the mid-segment with no high-end frills but all the comforts of a boutique hotel.

 The hotel industry is fast changing. The facilities have to be tailor-made for every guest no matter which part of the world he is coming from. The traditional way of making and running a hotel is passe and flexibility is the mantra with trendy concepts and vibrant interiors. Housez 43 is the result of our long stint with The Park and extensive travel throughout Europe, says S.H Rahman, director, Housez 43.

 The hotel, built over an area of 10,000 sq ft, is housed on bustling Mirza Ghalib Street, a melting pot of business and leisure tourists from Bangladesh, Southeast Asia and even Europe. The domestic business traffic is also very high here.

 Our target group is that section which is not looking for very high-end luxury yet wants to put up at a decent place that has a familiar milieu. And Mirza Ghalib Street has a good flow of such tourists, feels Rahman.

 The hotel boasts of intimate interiors, colourful walls and mood lighting. The rooms in the hotel are spread over an area of between 150 sq ft or 400 sq ft. And no two rooms look the same. They are fully furnished with every basic facility. We have paid great attention to every little detail, assures Rahman. 

 The rent would range anywhere between Rs 2,500 and Rs 5,000.

 Though the hotel does not have a full-fledged restaurant yet, there are plans for one. We have a 24-hour kitchen and 24 hours of personalised butler service. And there is a takeaway called Turkish Corner that would serve Turkish delights, says Rahman.

 Expansion plans are already being chalked out. We are not looking at a chain of hotels. We would rather call them a collection of hotels because all of them would have their own characteristics and charm. We would focus on the eastern region, covering Ranchi, Siliguri and Patna. Then we plan to move into other zones, says Rahman.

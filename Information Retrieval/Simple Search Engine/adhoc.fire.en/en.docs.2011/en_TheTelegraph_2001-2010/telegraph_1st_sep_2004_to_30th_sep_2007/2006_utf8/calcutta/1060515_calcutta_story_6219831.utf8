What: The Four Rs ? Raga, Rhyme, Rhapsody and 

Rabindranath ? organised by Open Doors.

 Where: HSBC Hall at Tollygunge Club.

 When: May 12, 7.30 pm onwards.

 Take a look: Songs, dance sequences and dramatised monologues traced the various classical, folk and western sources that influenced Tagore and his timeless compositions. Conceptualised by Sounak Chatterjee, the participants included Rabindrasangeet singer Pramita Mallick, actor Parambrata Chatterjee, actress Aparajita Auddy, singer Francis Lepcha and Sounak, the vocalist. 

 The mood was set with an enthralling rendering of raag Yaman by Sounak and Tagores Mor sondhaye tumi sundaro beshe eshechho based on the same raag. 

 Anchor Parambrata read out passages from Sangeet Chinta, a work in which the Nobel laureate expresses his views on music.

 The next part was on folk influences. Pramita sang Ekla Nitai and then Tagores Ekla chalo re. Next it was Francis Lepcha on stage, regaling the audience with Ye Banks and Braes and Nancy Lee, each followed by the Tagore versions Phule phule and Shyama maayer joye, sung by Pramita.

 Aparajita Auddy danced to melodies like Mamo chitye.

 Voiceover: The programme was a fusion of ideas and music. Do re mi or Sa re ga ma, music is one common medium that overcomes all boundaries, smiled Sounak.

 Bread basics

 What: The Bread Basket, from The Stadel Poorna Annapurna Workshop series.

 Where: The hotel housed inside Salt Lake stadium.

 When: Saturday morning.

 Take a look: PR veteran Rita Bhimani, chocolate making expert Sheela Jankiram and cookery expert Manju Sethia were the guests at the bakery workshop. The occasion also saw the launch of new desserts and cakes at Baker Boy, the bakery outlet at the hotel.

 The workshop kicked off with a quiz session where Rita along with Sheela and Manju asked food-related questions. Sample: what is the icing on a wedding cake made of, for which pat came the right reply, almond paste.

 Participants young and old lapped up ways to make healthy, nutritious and delicious breads, stuffed buns, bread rolls, patties, cheese straws and canap?s by chef Narayan Chatterjee. The chef demonstrated the making of bread dough and shared tips on Masala Bread, Brown Bread and so on. Also showcased were Patty Puffs, Dinner Rolls and more.

 Voiceover: Breads are a regular part of our diet but little do we know how they are made. A workshop like this allows homemakers to know more about breads, said Narayan.

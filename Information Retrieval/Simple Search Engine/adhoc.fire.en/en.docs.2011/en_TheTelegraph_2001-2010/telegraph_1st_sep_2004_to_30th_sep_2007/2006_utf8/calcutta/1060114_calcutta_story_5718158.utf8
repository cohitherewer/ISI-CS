 Abuzz with anniversary

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam will inaugurate on Tuesday the much-awaited week-long ceremony to mark the 150th anniversary of Calcutta University.

 A variety of programmes ? seminars, conferences, academic meets (to which academicians of national and international repute have been invited) and cultural functions ? are lined up between January 17 and January 24, the day the university was born.

 ?This is a historic moment and we want to make it a memorable one with the participation of each and every person associated with the university,? vice-chancellor Asis Kumar Banerjee said.

 Vice-chancellors, senior teachers and officers from more than 50 universities across India have confirmed their stay here during the celebrations. Academicians from Japan, Singapore, the UK and USA will visit the university next week as well as in the months to come, as the university will hold a series of seminars and academic meets throughout this year.

 ?Through the international seminars and academic conferences, we want to ensure that the 150th celebrations can make a long-lasting contribution to the overall academic growth and development of our institution,? Banerjee said.

 However, some employees owing allegiance to Calcutta University Employees? Unity Centre alleged that the authorities have ?deliberately? not invited them to the celebrations. Unlike other years, January 24 will be a full working day.

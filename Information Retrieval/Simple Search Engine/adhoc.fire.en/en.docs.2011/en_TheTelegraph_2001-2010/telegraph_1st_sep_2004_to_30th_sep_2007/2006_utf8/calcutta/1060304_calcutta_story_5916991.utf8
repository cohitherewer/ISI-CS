Life

 Making magic out of mix and match

 An arty dresser rsquo;s signature is marked by a distinctive aesthetic appeal mirroring her personality, writes Shradha Agarwal

 Carrying the dressing dossier forward, GoodLife brings to you the quintessential elements that make a woman an arty fashionista.

 Who is she? 

 Contrary to popular belief, says designer and style consultant Sunipa Samadder, an arty dresser is radically different from her Bohemian counterpart.

 She is the most aesthetically balanced among all the other types of fashionistas, beautifully combining the five elements of design ? rhythm, balance, harmony, proportion and unity. Her love for handcrafted articles, be it jewellery, prin ts, fabrics or shoes is unmistakable, making that her signature style, explains Sunipa.

 Designer Suchismita Dasgupta feels that an arty dresser is not one who is going to wear something expensive just because that is the norm; rather she is someone who breaks the rules with her own sense of style and taste.

 Since handcrafted and various art influences are more her thing, watch out for someone who has that one hatke accent in her ensemble ? anything from a stunning scarf to a bag, observes Suchismita.

 And with that one item that sets her apart from the crowd, the arty dresser catches an eye with every move she makes. 

 Prateek Raja of Kanishkas, the design den frequented by many a famous fashionista, says: An arty woman is super comfortable with what she likes to wear. She knows her style sense all too well ? what suits her and what doesnt. Nevertheless, she is always looking out for something different and new, so that she can stand out in the maddening crowd. 

 Arty dressers are necessarily a more mature lot, observes Darshan Shah of Weavers Studio, another favourite arty destination in town. 

 They are achievers to a great extent and hence a different level of confidence surrounds their persona, carrying off the simplest of looks with elan, says Darshan.

 Theme talk

 Unlike their classic counterparts, arty dressers believe in the mighty power of mix and match, done aesthetically of course.

 She will combine different elements to create a stunning ensemble, not in a street way but in a manner that it ends up looking almost like a piece of art, says Suchismita. Though she might be wearing seemingly regular clothes, her personal touch always works wonders.

 She could just be wearing a crisp white shirt with embroidered trousers to work but watch her slip on mirror-work sandals and an ethnic scarf to make her ensemble rock for that after-office do, smiles Suchismita. 

 An arty dresser always gives a sense of blending into her surroundings. She is also one person who probably carries that one look from morning to lunch to a high tea, not bothering to change or update something drastically, explains Darshan from Weavers.

 Prateek observes how arty dressers have an amazing sense of styling their outfits, especially their blouses if they wear saris.

 An arty womans colour palette, adds Prateek, is also quite distinct and defined. Her choice of colours is more on the lines of maroons, rusts, blues, greens, whites and lots of gold.

 With accessories being the most striking part of her look, the theme talk for an arty dresser is almost like a canvas, waiting to be explored. 

 Must haves 

 She mostly likes basic textiles and silhouettes but is ready to add that bit of elegant drama on the side.

 The wardrobe of an arty dresser comprises pieces, each of which has a tale to tell and an artistic one at that. She is a global person. Someone who wont think twice about putting in an intricately carved silver spoon as a jooda stick, says Sunipa. 

 The wardrobe must-haves for such a versatile person can be quite a task. Nevertheless, here is Sunipas list of what you should find in her possession.

 Khadi or tussar kurtas in basic black, rust, white and indigo blue 

 Traditional textile printed saris like Ajrakh, Bagru and exotic batik

 Long flowing skirts in solid colours, versatile enough to be teamed widely

 Interesting, crushed dupattas or stoles

 Kalamkari kurtis and linen trousers in basic colours 

 Applique, phulkari or exotically woven jackets in various lengths

 Ethnic sling bag, could be shell-work, mirrors or mat

 One silver filigree chain

 Lots of bangles in metal or glass

 Ornate neckpieces in dokra or traditional gold pieces

 Hand-woven mat footwear like jootis and other comfortable sandals

 Few headgears and brooches or rings

 Shop stops

 Arty dressers are usually well travelled and pick up their pieces on their trips abroad. Back home, they are the first to frequent state exhibitions, flea markets, haats, melas, tribal stores, government exhibitions, revival campaigns and even manufacturing units.

 In Calcutta, their favourite shopping destinations are stores like Kaniskhas, Weavers Studio, Ananda, Hugli, Sasha and Anokhi.

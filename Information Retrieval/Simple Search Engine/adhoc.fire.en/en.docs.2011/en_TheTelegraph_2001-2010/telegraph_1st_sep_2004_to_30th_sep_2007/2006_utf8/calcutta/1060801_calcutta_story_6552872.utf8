The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 ?I want to do the kind of films I like?

 On Sunday evening, Konkona Sen Sharma dropped in at a city multiplex to catch Omkara with her film-maker mother Aparna Sen. As Tilottama in Naseeruddin Shah?s directorial debut Yun Hota Toh Kya Hota and Indu in Vishal Bhardwaj?s adaptation of Othello, Konkona has stormed the big screen two Fridays in a row, making her one of the most talked about actresses today. But she continues to fight shy of the spotlight. Reshmi Sengupta catches up with the reluctant star.

 Two of your films ? Yun 

 Hota Toh Kya Hota and Omkara ? have released 

 in two back-to-back Fridays. How does it feel?

 It?s great. It?s very exciting. It so happened that the two films released close to each other. I am happy because I have put in a lot of effort in both the films, especially Omkara, where the dialect was very difficult. 

 What kind of response have 

 you got for the films?

 I got very positive feedback. But people never call up to say that they didn?t like your work. I think the positive response should be taken with a pinch of salt.

 How would you rate your performances 

 in Omkara and Yun Hota Toh Kya Hota? 

 I don?t want to rate my performances. Let the critics do that. I think I have done okay. So much of my character depends on how it?s shot, how it has been edited, what the background has been, how your co-stars have acted? In comparison I think I had a much more challenging role in 15, Park Avenue. It has been my most challenging film till now. 

 Which character has been easy 

 for you ? Tilottama or Indu?

 Tilottama is closer to me. She?s a Bengali girl and I have known people like her. But I couldn?t relate to Indu. She is culturally far removed from me and she even turns a killer at the end. But I am very happy with both the films. I liked the scripts and I wanted to do them.

 What kind of an impact do you 

 think the two films will have on your career? Do you feel 

 it will increase your acceptance in Bollywood and among 

 the mass audience?

 I have no idea. And I am not even looking into all these things. I had a few other offers but I liked these two. I just want to do different kinds of films. 

 I am not looking for any kind of acceptance, in Bollywood or among the masses. A lot of it is based on luck. Some films click, some don?t. Sometimes the audience can?t relate to a character because the film is bad. I just want to do the kind of films I like. 

 Do you feel Bollywood is moving 

 in the direction of making sensible, intelligent films?

 What direction? I think Omkara is a great film because Vishal Bhardwaj is a very good director. But there?s a lot of shit being made in Bollywood. And I am not interested in the industry. I don?t get the time to watch too many films, though I love watching films. 

 Which do you feel is more difficult 

 ? carrying a film on your shoulders alone or making a mark 

 in an ensemble cast like Omkara?

 I think the question of being difficult or easy depends on what kind of direction you have been given in the film. If the film is very badly written, your entire effort will go waste. A lot of it depends on teamwork. To me, the role matters the most. But sometimes, it?s very easy to carry off a solo lead. 

 Which projects are coming up 

 next?

 I am doing Rituparno Ghosh?s Sunglass and Anurag Basu?s Metro. I start shooting for Sunglass on August 1.

 While choosing a film, does 

 the kind of films a director makes influence your decision?

 I vibed very well with Anurag Basu. The understanding with your director is very important. You need to trust the director in order to surrender to him. I also liked the story. I haven?t seen Gangster yet, but Shabana (Azmi) has told me that it?s a very good film. 

 Are you aware that you are 

 one of the most talked about actresses right now?

 No, I am not. It?s good if people like my acting, but I am not very comfortable with all this talk, somehow. I don?t want to get into all that.

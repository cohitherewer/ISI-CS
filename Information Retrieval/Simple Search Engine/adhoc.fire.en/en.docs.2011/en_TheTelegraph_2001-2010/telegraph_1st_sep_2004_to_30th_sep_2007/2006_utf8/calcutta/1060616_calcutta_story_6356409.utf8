 What: A party 

 hosted by former Indian skipper Sourav Ganguly.

 Where: Prince 

 of Cal, the lounge bar at Souravs: The Food Pavilion 

 on Park Street.

 When: Wednesday 

 night.

 The bash: With 

 a smile for every guest and a keen eye on the India-West 

 Indies Test match score on screen, Sourav was obviously 

 the prince of the party.

 Dressed casually in blue jeans and blue T-shirt, Sourav, 

 along with wife Dona and brother Snehashish, walked in a 

 little after 8 pm.

 Nursing his glass of juice all 

 evening, the cricketer exchanged pleasantries with one and 

 all, but he was never too far from a TV screen beaming Team 

 Indias struggle to bowl out Brian Lara and boys.

 When it came to questions pertaining 

 to his taking over Souravs and planning other business 

 ventures, the flamboyant southpaw chose to play with a dead 

 bat. 

 I really do not have any idea about running a restaurant. 

 I think the team here will be able to give a better answer 

 as to what new can be expected at Souravs. I would 

 be present just to give my suggestions, he smiled.

 Later, he dropped in to Maharaj 

 on the third floor for dinner with family and friends.

 nVoiceover: The party has been thrown to introduce 

 Sourav to some regulars here. From now on, Sourav will be 

 more involved in the day-to-day affairs of the restaurant. 

 He wanted to set the ball rolling before leaving for his 

 County stint (on Friday), said Saikat Sarkar, general 

 manager, Souravs.

 Goa gung-ho

 What: Party to celebrate the launch of 

 a project in Goa by Hotel Hindusthan International.

 Where: Underground, the nightclub at 

 HHI.

 When: Wednesday night.

 The bash: The celebration kicked off 

 by 10 pm and saw most guests happily abiding by the theme 

 for the evening black casual (something they would 

 have probably picked anyway for a night out).

 DJ G, from Enigma in Mumbai, kept the dance floor rocking 

 till late, mixing cool reggaeton, hip-hop and bhangra beats. 

 Sipping on their drinks and nibbling on light bites like 

 kebabs, sushi, crab claws and fried prawns, the guests seemed 

 to have a blast. 

 Also spotted: Soccer star Bhaichung Bhutia, 

 VJ Archana, model Nicolette Bird and some familiar faces 

 from Tollywood like Pallavi Chatterjee, Rachana Banerjee 

 and Arunima Ghosh, with Arindam Sil and Indrajit.

 Voiceover: This is a double celebration 

 for us. We wanted to have a party for our regulars, members 

 and patrons for quite some time now. So with the project 

 in Goa taking shape, we decided to throw a big bash, 

 said managing director of HHI, D.K. Jaiswal.

 Air threat to human lungs

 - Nasa study sees West Asia link to city fumes

 An ongoing global air pollution 

 study by the US-based National Aeronautics and Space Administration 

 (Nasa) has found that carbon monoxide emitted by cars combine 

 with nitrogen dioxide present in the city atmosphere to 

 cause serious damage to human lungs.

 The research, being carried out 

 by the Ultra Violet Remote Sensing Group under the atmospheric 

 chemistry department of Nasas Goddard Space Flight Center, 

 has also revealed that the bulk of Calcuttas dust particles 

 come from West Asia and the neighbouring regions.

 The study, in its first phase, 

 is being conducted with the help of Ozone Monitoring Instrument, 

 a satellite recording images of air pollution across the 

 globe.

 The images recorded before monsoon 

 confirm that the dust particles in Calcutta and other parts 

 of the Gangetic valley are blown in from outside, explained 

 Pawan Kumar Bhartia, in charge of the project. We are in 

 talks with Indian Space Research Organisation and other 

 Indian research institutes for studies on the ground and 

 sea level. Investigation into Indias air pollution is a 

 complex process, as the direction of air flow changes through 

 the year.

 The satellite images show presence 

 of layers of nitrogen dioxide and aerosols in the citys 

 atmosphere. Nitrogen dioxide, in the presence of sunlight, 

 forms ozone, which is extremely harmful for crops and lungs. 

 While nitrogen dioxide cannot move from one place to another, 

 ozone flows to other areas. It is to be seen how much of 

 the thick layer of ozone over Calcutta has flown in from 

 outside, said the Nasa scientist. The aerosol consists 

 of solid dust particles and sulphuric acid. The dust particles 

 are blown over the northern part of India to Calcutta before 

 they move south towards Bay of Bengal, added Bhartia.

 According to him, dust particles 

 can travel 700 to 800 km in a day, which means they will 

 take only a couple of days to travel from Delhi to Calcutta.

 A hundred and five Poila Baisakhs and counting. 

 The memories spilled over as Sarala Devi sat with daughter Rama Sharma in their south Calcutta apartment at the turn of yet another Nava Varsha.

 In 1908, Sarala Devi was seven and that Poila Baisakh was the first time she was chosen to sing for a school programme in Sylhet. ?I was good at singing and my teachers asked me to sing most of the songs of Dhrubar Khela (a Puranic musical),? she recounted, a smile scattering the wrinkles across her face.

 Her father Durgacharan Chakraborty, a jailer, had a Rai Bahadur to his name. 

 On Poila Baisakh, all of them (seven sisters and two brothers) would wear new clothes and tuck into goodies from the kitchen. She was the darling of her sisters because she ?looked like a doll? and was nicknamed Putul. 

 ?I remember my sister and I had to cross a bridge to reach our school, Faizunissa Balika Vidyalay. I remember once CR Das came to Sylhet. I was around 10 and our teachers wanted me to sing Swagoto Deshbandhu moder dino kutire?? she recalled, repeating lyrics from a moment some nine decades old.

 At 13, Sarala Devi was one of the few students admitted to Mission Memorial Girls? School, a newly-opened enterprise by a Miss Morgan and a Miss Jones. Apart from conversational English, drawing and sewing, she picked up songs like Rule Britannia? 

 But again when Rabindranath Tagore visited Sylhet with Pratima Devi, Sarala was asked by the college principal to recite a poem. ?I think it went Hey amar chiro shundoro, chiro pujjyo??

 In the 1930s, Sarala Devi was living in Bakshi Bazaar, Dhaka. As the mother of two daughters (she later had another daughter and four sons) and the wife of Jogesh Chandra Sharma, head of department, chemistry, of Dhaka University, she had her hands full for Poila Baisakh. 

 Those were times when you didn?t just go out and buy sweets for your guests; everything had to be made at home. ?I can still smell the milk thickening slowly in the large wok as I skimmed it off and kept it aside for sorbhaja. I had a lot of energy then and made shingara, kochuri, chamcham, rasogolla??

 It was time then for her children to raid the kitchen and sing at the functions at the Dhaka Town Hall. In the evenings, they would host Hassan Saheb and Ramesh Mitter, friends from Dhaka University, a Marathi neighbour, family friends like Leela and Girish Nag. ?Sometimes, we used to go visiting old friends all over the town,? reminisced Sarala Devi.

 Soon after 1947, Sarala Devi and her children moved to Cornwallis Street, Calcutta. And ever since she moved to her house in Naktala, Poila Baisakh hasn?t been the same. She has lost her husband and two sons. 

 ?Even in our house in Gol Park, Poila Baisakh would be a grand affair. People would come over and I would prepare food like we did in Dhaka. But now, my daughter insists on preparing the things I like: a little pulao, alur dam and chutney,? smiled Sarala Devi.

 At 105, she walks around the house, watches TV, reads books and sews, and even awaits an opportunity to sneak into the kitchen and prepare some sweets for her daughter and grandchildren.

 ?She belongs to a different era; none of us today would have the same stamina of mind and body,? summed up daughter Rama Sharma, a retired headmistress.

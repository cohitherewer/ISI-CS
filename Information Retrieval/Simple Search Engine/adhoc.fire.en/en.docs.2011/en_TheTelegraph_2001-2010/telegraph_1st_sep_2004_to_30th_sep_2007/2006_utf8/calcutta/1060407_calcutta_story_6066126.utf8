 Twilight years of 

 uncertainty: Elderly morning-walkers in a park 

 The University Grants Commission?s 

 recognition of six colleges in West Bengal as centres of 

 excellence indicates the state?s advancement in the field 

 of higher education (Star tag on six colleges, March 9). 

 The colleges have been chosen well. Their quality of teaching 

 and infrastructure are a cut above the rest. 

 The centre-of-excellence scheme will inspire other colleges to develop their infrastructure and improve their quality of teaching. There will be healthy competition to secure the tag. Once a college secures the honour, it might even go the St Xaviers way and seek autonomous stature. 

 While the move to improve the quality of college education is laudable, something needs to be done to augment the standard of teaching in state schools. The quality of infrastructure in schools desperately need an upgrade. A centre-of-excellence scheme should be started for the overall improvement of the schools as well. A competitive spirit among schools needs to be fostered. 

 The National Assessment and Accreditation Council or a similar body should be entrusted with the responsibility of evaluating schools all over the country and make recommendations for their improvement. 

 If necessary, a school grants commission can be formed at the state level as well. It should be provided adequate money to bring about a significant change in the quality of school education.

 Dignity, not pity in age 

 Apropos the report ?Ailing, old, waiting to die?, March 10, it was shocking to learn that an old and ailing lady was forced to wait for her death on the railway platform because her family members did not want to give her food and shelter. Food, two sets of clothes and a bit of love and affection are all that an old person requires for survival. Is that too much to ask for! We can realise the woman?s agony if we put ourselves in her position. However irritating her nature be, her kin were inhuman to throw her out on the street. 

 Govind Das Dujari,

 Diamond Harbour Road.

 It was upsetting to read about 

 73-year-old Mira Moitra waiting for her death on the railway 

 platform. Since she has become a burden, her brothers and 

 sisters-in-law thought it best to dump her. If she had any 

 money, the relatives would have been fighting tooth and 

 nail for inheritance. The police on the other hand are hardly 

 bothered about the lady?s problems and are content to remain 

 inactive since there is no law and order threat. It is high 

 time the government ensures that the elderly spent their 

 last days in peace. 

 Purnima Vasudeva,

 Rowland Road.

 Mira Moitra sitting all alone 

 at Birati station presented a dismal picture of old age 

 and loneliness. There is nothing this 73-year-old wanted 

 except food and shelter. The cruelty shown by her relatives 

 have demeaned humanity. Unfortunately, our judicial system 

 does not penalise such acts. The concern shown towards the 

 old lady brought out the humane side of Calcuttans. We can 

 heave a sigh of relief that not all of us have been morally 

 crippled. Joyeeta Dey,

 Teghoria. 

 Mira Moitra?s plight is heart-rending. Senior citizens 

 do not deserve such treatment, that too from relatives. 

 If 10 per cent of all those who read such reports, attend 

 to their elders properly from now on, the society will improve 

 a lot. 

 Name and address withheld 

 Apropos the report ?Abandoned 

 finds home?, March 11, it is wonderful that 73-years old 

 Mira Moitra, who was abandoned by her close ones found a 

 permanent home. The coverage in Metro undoubtedly 

 served as a boon for her. 

 Bhupen Bose,

 Dum Dum Park 

 There is a pressing need for more 

 homes where the aged and the unmarried can live in peace 

 away from the ill-treatment by brothers, their wives, sons 

 and daughters-in-law. Moitra will undoubtedly find peace 

 in her new home and get well quickly. 

 Kabita Roy,

 Shibpur.

 Thanks to Metro for highlighting 

 the plight of Mira Moitra. The authorities of the old age 

 home of Dakshineswar Ramakrishna Sangha Adyapeeth also deserve 

 praise for providing shelter to her. Currently, the elderly 

 are neglected everywhere, in their family, by the society 

 and even by the government. The laws meant to protect them 

 are ineffectual. 

 Sachindra Nath Mitra,

 Rakhal Ghosh Lane.

 In this cruel world, almost nobody 

 cares about the downtrodden. If organisations like Dakshineswar 

 Ramakrishna Sangha Adyapeeth were not there, Mira Moitra 

 and many like her would have to spend their last days in 

 agony. If the septuagenarian had money and property, she 

 would have been treated with care and respect by whoever 

 she turned to. 

 A.F. Kamruddin Ahmed,

 Bandpur, Hooghly. 

 It is really sad that an ailing, 

 old woman has been left to fend for herself in the big, 

 bad world despite her relatives possessing a home and a 

 hearth. Today, people are willing to throw away money on 

 useless things but won?t even share a small portion with 

 relatives who are of no use to them. Our moral decadence 

 sends a shiver down the spine.

 Samir Chakraborty,

 Howrah. 

 Apropos the report ?Takeover time for ailing ponds?, March 3, what was described as Raghu dakater pukur was purchased as a plot of solid land (minus a waterbody) with a garden house on it by my great grandfather from an attorney named John Hart in 1894. My great grandfather had dug up the pond 10 years later. In 1909, he had created a debutter estate, which is the owner of the property and of which I am the sebait.

 Estate 

 Apropos the picture ?The Ray Connection?, April 6, the caption mentioned that Soumitra Chatterjee and Dhritiman Chaterji had never shared screen space before the shooting of telefilm Dronacharya. The actors have earlier worked together in films, including Satyajit Ray?s Ganashatru. This is the first time they will be seen together on the small screen. The error is regretted.

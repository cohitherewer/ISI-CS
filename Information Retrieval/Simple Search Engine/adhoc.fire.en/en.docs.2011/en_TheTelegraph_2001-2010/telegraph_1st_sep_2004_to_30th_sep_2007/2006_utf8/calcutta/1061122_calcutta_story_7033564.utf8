 Shilpa Shetty and Shiney Ahuja in Metro; (below) music director Pritam

 Wanted: Lead singers for a rock band. Time in hand: A few days. That is mission novelty for Team Metro. Anurag Basus next film after Gangster needs a band of boys to keep the storyline rocking. Lok pachhina, music director Pritam strikes a desperate chord. 

 We need to create a band which will feature in the movie and do all the six-seven songs in it. The songs are all ready, he states from the bed of a Goregaon nursing home where he is admitted for dehydration.

 The UTV production starring Shiney Ahuja, Shilpa Shetty, Irrfan, Konkona Sen Sharma, Kay Kay Menon, Kangana Ranaut and Sharman Joshi is already on the floors and well underway. The band will be a very important part of the movie. The lyrics are tied to the story and the philosophy of life in the film. And they are not background scores. They are the sutradhar, Pritam adds.

 The stage seems set for an exciting talent hunt, but time is a real constraint. It isnt as if the films unit suddenly woke up to the need for new voices. We have been listening to CDs. Some have even sent songs from Bengal and Assam. Singers these days are so influenced by Kishore or Rafi or Sonu that it is impossible to find a fresh voice. Those we like are being called to sing three of the songs which are of different varieties, Pritam says.

 Then, they plan to take the band forward, beyond the film. We can take them on nationwide road shows. And after the film, I plan to do an album with them, the composer of Dhoom fame pledges.

 Other than the singers, hands will be needed to play drums, bass guitar and keyboard. Another guitarist will have to be the back-up vocalist as well. The members will have to remain fixed. So there is the question of year-round availability.

 One singer zeroed in on is James. The first Bangladeshi vocalist to lend his voice to Bollywood, who shot to fame with Gangsters Bheegi Bheegi, is a top choice for one of the lead-singer slots.

 The Gangster duo is headed for a showdown on the question of Pritam himself being part of the band. Anurag has made up his mind on that score. But Pritam is wary. I was forced to face the camera for the music video of Gangster. Friends have made fun of that... And where do I have the time? he pleads.

 Sitting amid a spate of releases Dhoom 2, Apna Sapna Money Money..? and Bhagam Bhag he can only expect to get busier. I am feeling like a Quincey Jones, having to form the band, give it an image protests Pritam.

 So, looking for a rocking break? Just sing your soul out and send a demo clip to pritam_metroyahoo.com.

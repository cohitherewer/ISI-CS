 Before imposing a penalty on vendors for using plastic containers, the authorities should undertake an awareness drive. Education is the only means of fighting proliferation of plastic. Educational institutions and social organisations should come forward to inform everyone about the perils of using plastic, which decomposes slowly and releases toxic fumes on being burnt. The drainage system is blocked due to unscientific disposal of plastic products. There should be a total ban on the material. Advanced countries have implemented such a ban years ago. 

 Biman Saha, 

 Lake Town

 Plastic packets more than plastic containers are responsible for clogging of drains. Unfortunately, plastic containers are very handy for vendors. I do not think that penal measures are an answer. The government should come up with a plan for disposal of plastic products.

 The vendors should definitely not be penalised for using plastic containers. Instead, manufacturers should be taken to task for producing banned articles. Food items, especially, should never be kept in plastic containers.

 Prasenjit Das, 

 Jadavpur

 Vendors should definitely be penalised for using plastic containers, which are a source of pollution. If not disposed off properly, plastic products block the drainage system causing waterlogging. The use of plastic needs to be stopped at any cost. If the vendors do not heed the rules, they must be forced to do so.

 Md. Rafi Alam Khan,

 Vendors should obviously be penalised for using plastic containers.There is no easy way of decomposing plastic, which even threatens the habitat of fish. 

 Iqbal Tailor,

 Kamarhati

 Of course. Because of them we are forced to breathe polluted air. The customers must stop buying from vendors who use plastic containers.

 Indranil Sanyal,

 Dhakuria

 Vendors using plastic containers must be penalised, for they are breaking the law. Plastic does not decompose and is detrimental to the eco-system. Instead of plastic containers, paper and jute packets can be used. A mass awareness programme should be organised to inform people about the ill effects of plastic. 

 Tuli Das,

 Salt Lake 

 Penalising vendors is not the way to stop use of plastic. The government must implement a blanket ban on production of plastic below a certain thickness. Social awareness is the most potent weapon in preventing use of plastic, which is harmful for vendors, manufacturers and consumers alike.

 Saikat Hazra, 

 Bhadrakali

 I dont think vendors should be penalised for using plastic containers, which are very useful as well as cheap, and hence much in demand. Banning plastic containers without providing an alternative would be tyrannical.

 Ravi Khaitan,

 Park Circus

 Vendors should not be assigned all the blame for spread in use of plastic containers. It is the responsibility of their customers, who are generally more knowledgeable, to discourage the use of plastic. Environment-friendly jute is a possible substitute for plastic.

 Neha Almal,

 Address not given

 It would be the right thing to penalise vendors for using plastic products, containers or otherwise. A fine for illegal use of plastic would help in checking the problem. The authorities should also target the manufacturers of plastic to root out the problem. People could chip in by not buying from vendors who use plastic products.

 Prahlad Agarwala,

 Majdia, Nadia 

 Plastic containers are being used for a long time by vendors. Environmentalists have only recently started raising a voice against their use. Until the government comes up with an alternative, vendors should not be punished for using plastic bags.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 The City Diary

 Police have kept up the pressure on the Metro Shopping 

 Centre Shop Owners Welfare Association to demolish the 

 food-stall structure close to the wall the retail plaza 

 shares with the British Deputy High Commission on Ho Chi 

 Minh Sarani. 

 On Friday, officer-in-charge of Shakespeare Sarani police 

 station, G.N. Mukherjee, visited Metro Plaza, carrying a 

 diktat from deputy commissioner (south) Ajay Kumar to remove 

 the structure. 

 quot;I have instructed them to close down the eatery. 

 If they dont comply, we will shut it down in a day or two, 

 Kumar said. The retailers, however, arent prepared to pull 

 down the food-stall, a footfall driver, yet. 

 quot;I spoke to Kumar and reiterated we cant demolish 

 the structure since the Corporation has issued a Section 

 401 notice on the issue which is pending in court, Faroque 

 Hashmi, general secretary of the shop-owners association, 

 told Metro. The association pressed for a tripartite meeting 

 date involving police and the deputy high commission officers.

Police said most applicants had stopped paying their equated monthly instalments a few months after the loans were sanctioned. We are probing whether some of them were hand in glove with the promoters, said D.P. Tarenia, IG CID (II).

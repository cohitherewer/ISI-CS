 Words of wisdom on the Steps of Wisdom ? thats how one can sum up Saturday mornings GoodLife Talk Show, which was held at the auditorium (Steps of Wisdom) of Delhi Public School (DPS), New Town. With red and white balloons adorning the auditorium, and a book fair and art exhibition in progress, the school premises wore a festive look for a discussion on the fundamental fact of Parenting and Child Care.

 The panel comprised cricket expert Kishore Bhimani, Odissi dancer Alakananda Roy, child psychologist Dr Prathama Chowdhury and DPS principal Ruma Chandra.

 The Q amp;A session, which opened to a packed house comprising parents and students, was set rolling by moderator Rita Bhimani who put forward a question to Alakananda as to how she managed to bring up her children despite such a busy schedule.

 The first thing that should be kept in mind while bringing up children is that a child needs to be given enough space. For most parents who are working these days, it should be a two-way process where both the child as well as the parent tries to make best use of the time they get to spend together. Today kids are also far more aware of whats happening around them and they accept things just as they are, offered the dancer.

 Rita then put the next question to husband Kishore, asking him to point out the difference in the education systems in the west and in this part of the world and how far they affected the way a child was brought up. The western system of education is far more harsher when compared to our system of education that is fairly soft. There they just let the child be. Unlike here, there are no smiling teachers and sympathetic parents. Children there grow up faster and are set to face the world. A parent here pays too much heed to the crying child on the first day of school and so do the teachers. So, it takes longer for the child to settle down in an environment alien to his home, felt Kishore.

 Ruma begged to differ on that point: Given the tender age of the children, they do require the softness. We should realise that a child is stepping out of home for the first time into an environment that he/she has not seen earlier. The fear factor associated with school will remain if he /she does not find the environment homely enough. For instance, students of my school run into my office anytime to share their titbits. And it is our duty as teachers to lend them a patient ear so that they get a feeling that things that are important to them are important to us as well. Forcing them into an environment that is harsh can have adverse effects.

 The discussion then moved on to the influence of television on a childs life and the role it played in diverting the attention of the child from reading. 

 There is nothing wrong in letting your child watch TV but what is probably important is being able to regulate the time frame and the kind of channels that they are watching. But television watching should never be at the cost of reading. The simple reason for this is that while the child is watching TV, he or she has no participatory role. But when a child is reading a book, he thinks, tries to visualise things and reflects on the happening as soon as he turns a page. But I believe the Harry Potter series is bringing kids back to books. Hype or whatever, as long as kids are benefiting, why should one complain? demanded Dr Prathama Chowdhury. The crowd could not agree more.

 Questions then flew in from every corner of the auditorium as parents asked what they could do to balance their household activities, social life and time for their child, and what they could do to deal with child tantrums.

 The one-and-a-half hour session that witnessed panelists dealing deftly with the questions from the crowd came to an end with a poser from a gentleman: how would you define quality time? Come back home after work and listen to the little things that your child has to say. For sometime, switch off the mobile phone so that you dont have to tell your child every two minutes to stop while you attend to the call. He should be made to feel that things that he wants to share with you are as important as your business meetings, said both Kishore and Prathama.

 Learn to get rituals right

 Todays question: Do priests need to attend workshops to conduct rituals?

 Sandhya Banerjee,

 Salt Lake 

 Gone are the days when priesthood 

 was a family tradition. It is impossible now to earn a living 

 as a priest. On the other hand, those who are coming into 

 the profession do not even know Sanskrit. They certainly 

 need to attend workshops. If they can be made to, the public 

 will benefit.

Tuhin Purkayastha,

 Parnashree

 There is no need for priests at 

 temples. They only harass the visitors. Nowadays many non-Brahmins 

 are becoming priest to earn a living. I think priesthood 

 should be abolished. People should be allowed to offer puja 

 in peace. 

 H.K. dutta, 

 Shibpur

 We need to be clear about the 

 necessary qualities of a priest before answering the question. 

 Any good and knowledgeable person should be allowed to become 

 a priest. Many dubious characters now work as priests by 

 virtue of being Brahmin. I strongly feel that time has come 

 to abolish the system of allowing only Brahmins to become 

 priests. Priesthood should be open to even members of other 

 religions with the necessary qualities. In such as scenario, 

 workshops for priests wont be needed. 

 Sourish Misra, 

 Salt Lake

 All priests need not attend workshops. 

 There are many who are not only educated and well-informed 

 about religious rituals, but also have many years of experience. 

 The greenhorns and those who have entered the profession 

 only for money could do with workshops.

 Suchanda Sen,

 Bally

 Many priests nowadays are shifting 

 to other professions to boost their income. Those who cannot 

 do anything else are often forced to continue as priests. 

 They do not conduct the rituals properly and sometimes the 

 way they perform a puja depends on their dakshina. 

 Malpractices by priests are also being brought to light. 

 In such a scenario, not only should priests be made to attend 

 workshops, but awareness campaigns should also be conducted 

 among the religious people. 

P. Pramanik, 

 Santoshpur Avenue

 While there are professionals 

 for most jobs, priests are amateurs ignorant about the different 

 aspects of their work. Licences and workshops should immediately 

 be introduced for them. 

 Naren Sen,

 Howrah

 This is an age of professionalism. 

 Priests should attend workshops to perform rituals better.

 Arindam Basu,

 Birati

 We generally perform rituals to 

 convey our obeisance to the Almighty. The priest is only 

 the medium. But is there a need to have a medium? For a 

 long time, only the priests have been conducting religious 

 rituals. The system should be done away with for the greater 

 good of society. 

 Moumita Nandi, 

 Behala

 Todays priests definitely need 

 workshops to conduct rituals well. Most priests nowadays 

 cant even pronounce Sanskrit correctly, which is a shame. 

 Besides conveying scriptural knowledge, the workshops should 

 impress upon the priest the need to be honest and not fool 

 people in the name of religion.

 A.F.K. Ahmed,

 Bandpur 

 Certainly not. Priests are poorly 

 paid and hardly get any recognition. They cannot afford 

 to spend time attending workshops. Also questions will crop 

 up on finer points like which almanac to follow. Guidance 

 by older priests is enough.

R.N. Chatterjee,

 Dum Dum

 Those who conduct rituals prescribed 

 by the scriptures are called priests. They need not attend 

 workshops.

 D. Chakraborty,

 Cossipore

 Since Viswakarma puja is held 

 in workshops, priests need to attend workshops to conduct 

 the puja.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Life

 Heres looking at you, Miss Stranger

 SHRADHA AGARWAL

 THE FIRST MOVE: Befriending a lady at the bar can be risky business if you dont do it right. Picture by Rashbehari Das 

 Location: The citys hottest night spot.

 Scene one: Boy sees girl or girl sees boy. 

 Top of the mind: I really, really want to get to know her/him. 

 Opening line: Hey, can I buy you a drink? 

 So far so good, but no prizes for guessing the outcome because the result, more often that not, is in the form of a No thanks ? enough to make your ego (or your heart) go ouch.

 Where did I go wrong, you wonder? At the very beginning, maybe. Trying to chat up a complete stranger, that too in a Calcutta nightclub, is quite a gamble at the best of times.

 Forget the countless Holly-Bolly sequences where hero meets heroine in canteen or club, bus or bar. In real life, getting the right kind of attention from the person you are eyeing has a lot to do with you, with him/her and with the notoriously fickle lady called luck.

 Actress June suggests you put your cards on the table right and early. As you enter a nightclub, run your eyes casually through the crowd. If someone seems interesting and you feel like getting to know the person better, dont dilly-dally. Go ahead and approach him or her, advises June. 

 Sounds simple, but putting it into action is an entirely different date game. So heres the GoodLife guide to help you make that first move. (Statutory warning: we dont accept reponsibility for a smarting cheek, a bloody nose or a broken heart).

 Do

 Take a good, close look at yourself in the mirror ? make sure you look and think clean. The last thing you want to be when you approach a stranger is slovenly. So dress well and smell good. Your intention of just settling down for a chat with someone who seems interesting should come through loud and clear. Dont forget: smart is in, sleaze is out.

 June insists on eye contact. Catch his or her eye and then smile slightly. If the person smiles back, then they are definitely willing to give it a shot.

 If your smile is not returned, dont feel bad. Instead, be thankful that you didnt have to go through the embarrassment of receiving a toungue lashing, or worse.

 If the word is your weapon, the opening thrust better be witty. Else, the parry might not be pretty. A sense of humour always works. And a nice witty line always goes down better than a corny compliment, offers Amit Hathiramani, event architect.True, theres nothing like a laugh to break (and then melt) the ice. A false note that might come across as acting fresh could mark the end before the beginning.

 Be friendly with the friend of the target to get into the frame. Similarly, introduce your friends to him or her. This would make your friendly intentions clear.

 Dont

 Make up silly stories, they have an amazing ability of turning someone completely off. Lines like I think Ive seen you somewhere, or Arent you the same person who won the Miss India or Mr India title last year, will not get you anywhere. Just be direct and outright, while not letting the subtlety slip. Sticking to the straight and the narrow is far better than meandering flattery or slowburn small talk.

 Be over-friendly and pretend that you know him/her forever. Everybody needs time and space and especially if its someone you have just met. Allow them to breathe and once youve made the first move, step back. If your interest is reciprocated, get going.

 Get too touchy. A handshake is good enough ? for a while at least.

 Talk big or show off your money and contacts. Be a good listener, says Amit. nStare constantly. Making him/her uncomfortable on Night One is a no-no.

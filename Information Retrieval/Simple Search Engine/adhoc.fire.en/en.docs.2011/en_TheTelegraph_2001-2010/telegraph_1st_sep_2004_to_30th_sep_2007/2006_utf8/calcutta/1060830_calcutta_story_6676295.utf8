The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 The garbage, littered on the pavement in front of 10 Judges 

 Court Road, has turned the area into a dumpyard. The sweepers 

 dump all the refuse on the pavements and are least bothered 

 about the situation. It is unbearable for residents like 

 us to put up with the stench. Despite numerous complaints, 

 nothing has been done. I would ask the authorities concerned 

 to look into the matter.

 The escalator inside the subway of Tollygunge Metro station 

 is not working properly. As a result, commuters are forced 

 to take the busy road, which is quite dangerous. Initially, 

 I had reported the matter to the Tollygunge station master, 

 but nothing has been done. The road is always clogged with 

 autorickshaws and buses. Therefore, immediate steps should 

 be taken to avoid any mishap. 

 Debabrata Das, Grahams Lane, Tollygunge.

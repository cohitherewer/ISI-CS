 Time for infrastructure overhaul in the citys information technology hub, thanks to sustained lobbying by the captains of the industry with the government.

 The Nabadiganta Industrial Township Authority, which looks after the civic facilities in Salt Lake Sector V, has decided to repair and relay all major roads in the showpiece growth zone. The work will begin next week and is scheduled to be completed by the first week of January. 

 Seven arteries will be taken up for immediate repairs, said an official of the Authority that recently discussed the issue with representatives of the IT sector. The task has been assigned to the traffic and transportation wing of the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA).

 An official said the CMDA has decided to use part of its Rs 2-crore corpus earmarked for road repairs for the Sector V project.

 If we are trying to showcase a region, it is imperative the roads there are in good condition... We are hopeful the arteries in Sector V will look up by January, said Anup Kumar Matilal, executive officer of the Authority.

 First to be taken up is the stretch between SDF Building and the College junction. It will be followed by the roads in front of Techno India, Infinity, Wipro and in front of Nicco Park.

 This time there would be a complete overhaul, instead of patchwork. We will procure bulk bitumen, which will be mixed with graded stone chips in a hot-mix plant and used for repair. The mixing will be monitored through a computer, said Debdas Bhattacharya, of CMDA.

 The rains last year and the subsequent collapse of certain stretches in Sector V have prompted the authorities to take up a full-time project, instead of piecemeal repairs, so the roads will not have to be touched up for at least next two years.

 Welcoming the repair move, Infinity chairman Rabindra Chamaria said: Connectivity is of primary concern and if we look at similar townships across India, we would feel the need to do up the roads on a priority basis. The changes have started taking place and its a matter of time before all facilities are in place in Sector V.

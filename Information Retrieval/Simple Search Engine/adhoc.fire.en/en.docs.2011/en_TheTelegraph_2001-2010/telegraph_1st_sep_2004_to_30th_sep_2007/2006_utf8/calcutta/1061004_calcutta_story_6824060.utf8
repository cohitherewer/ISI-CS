 Woman, not courtesan

 Film-maker J.P. Dutta on his long-nourished 

 dream, Umrao Jaan

 Screen On amp; Off

 From father to son

 The lucid narration of the famed 

 yet doomed courtesan Umrao Jaan written by Mirza Hadi Ruswa 

 in his Urdu novel Umrao Jaan Ada has inspired many 

 creative minds to capture it on celluloid.

 My father, writer-film-maker O.P. 

 Dutta, had also scripted and started work on a film based 

 on Umrao Jaan way back in the 50s. However, he soon 

 found out that a film based on the same subject was already 

 being filmed. To avoid any controversy, he decided to shelve 

 his ambitious project.

 When I read the novel, I noticed 

 that many relevant aspects had not been touched by the earlier 

 film-makers. I felt a strong urge to portray Umrao Jaans 

 story in my way. Adapting from a novel is like interpreting 

 art. One has to interpret from ones own experiences, aesthetics 

 and understanding and thus the scope of capturing ones 

 innate vision is tremendous.

 I shared my thoughts with my father 

 who asked me if I wanted to read the script that he had 

 written. When I read his script I was completely floored. 

 I said to him: We will make this film! But at that time 

 Muzzafar Alis film had just released, so we felt we should 

 wait for at least a generation to pass before making our 

 version. Incidentally, last year marked 25 years since Alis 

 film and I felt that the time had come!

 Umrao Jaan is my way of 

 thanking my father for being there and realising a dream 

 that we both shared.

 The untold tale

 Umraos story moved me a lot. 

 The emotional journey of this one character overwhelmed 

 me. A common small-town girl Amiran is abducted from her 

 home and sold in the bazaars of Lucknow. It so aptly fit 

 with famed lyricist Sahir Ludhianwis telling and moving 

 lines, Aurat ne diya janam mardon ko, mardon ne diya 

 bazaar aurat ko...

 The poignancy that seeped through 

 was enough to motivate me. After all when one chooses a 

 film to make, one has to live with it for almost a year 

 if not more. So one has to be fascinated by the subject. 

 I was sure that I wanted my film to be about Amiran the 

 woman and not Umrao Jaan the courtesan that the world saw. 

 I wanted to showcase the person rather than the persona. 

 In fact, for the longest time I was debating on calling 

 my film Amiran but then stuck to Umrao Jaan for 

 greater reach and identification.

 Almost all people I met who had 

 read Umrao Jaan Ada would imagine that she was a 

 real person and would ask me if she was still alive. I did 

 not know if I should say she is no more or that she never 

 existed in the first place. This will remain as much a mystery 

 as her whole story. This question mark only added to her 

 magic and gave me an added impetus to put forth my version 

 of Umrao Jaan.

 The real Ash

 For the character of Umrao, a 

 woman with a smile on her face and a tear in her eye, who 

 could have been better than Aishwarya Rai? She has been 

 an outstanding Umrao Jaan.

 One will get see so much more 

 beyond her pretty face, as is the case whenever she works 

 with directors who understand her. If she gave a shot that 

 I knew she could do better, all I would say was: Will the 

 real Ash stand up? and I would get the perfect shot.

 After Aishwarya Rai was cast as 

 Umrao, I needed a man who could look like a poet and dreamer 

 and at the same time could stand next to her as an ideal 

 partner. When I closed my eyes, I could only see Abhishek 

 as Nawab Sultan. And, of course, one of the high points 

 of Umrao Jaan is that I got the wonderful Shabana 

 Azmi to be a part of it.

 I have been truly fortunate to 

 have got a brilliant cast, the finest musical talents and 

 the best technicians for Umrao Jaan. Everything has 

 worked out so beautifully that I feel that someone up there 

 was in the drivers seat making it all happen.

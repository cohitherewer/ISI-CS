 Life has changed for six-year-old Babu Shee. He no longer cries for his father, who is serving a life term in one of the city correctional homes. He is regularly going to school and has performed well in his quarterly examinations.

 Thanks to Swajan, a non-government organisation at Mukundapur, off the EM Bypass, which has taken up the responsibility to look after the children of the undertrials and prisoners, since its inception in 2003.

 Eleven-year-old Sambari and her eight- year-old brother Somlal Soren, seven-year-old Arpita and her six-year-old brother Babu Shee, seven-year-old Sheikh Nazibul and his five-year-old sister Salma Khatun, 11-year-old Roma and her four-year-old sister Jhuma Hansda and many more like them across the city have a similar story. The children are in distress, as either of their parents is serving a life term or is an undertrial. 

 From the moment they are born, they dont get any affection or attention from their parents. They have to face social stigma. They meet their parents in jail and just dream of having them together under one roof, said Subrata Roy, chairman of Swajan.

 In an attempt to help these children, Roy and some of his friends started Swajan, an NGO, for supporting these children as well as their families financially.

 Roy added: All these children are innocent. We cannot blame them for their parents deeds. They should be given a healthy environment to grow up as good citizens. We visit their homes before giving them the financial aid.

 Sukla Roy, another member of Swajan, explained: We pool in the money for their welfare from our own pockets. Our sole aim is to get them established. Besides financial aid, we supply them with books, clothes and other necessities.

 The organisation sponsors the education and other expenses of these children till their fathers are released from jail. 

 Roma Hansdas father Badal is in Presidency jail, serving a life sentence for committing a murder. But that hasnt discouraged her a bit. I want to be doctor. I want to prove that we also have the calibre to achieve it and can fight against all odds.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 IIT ready to rock

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 17: From effervescent pop and Bollywood hits to hard-hitting rock, a gathering of poets tickling the funny bone to beauties sashaying down the ramp? 

 Spring Fest, the annual cultural festival of IIT Kharagpur gets under way with all this and more on January 19.

 The 22nd edition of Spring Fest is being organised by IIT Kharagpur and Airtel in association with The Telegraph.

 If 2005 saw over 1,800 outstation participants flocking to the campus, this year, at the wildlife-themed fest, the number is expected to be higher. 

 The four-day gala kicks off with a performance by the students music society followed by Indipop band Euphoria on January 19 evening. The next day would see the prelims of Wildfire, the rock competition, and Shankar Mahadevan. 

 The highlights of January 21 are the fashion show Fine Frenzy and the Mary Bucknell Trophy Quiz that would have questions on news items covered by The Telegraph.

 The final day is reserved for some headbanging action with the finals of Wildfire and a performance by Skinny Alley lined up. A Hasya Kavi Sammelan, a talk by Anupam Mittal, CEO of People Interactive which owns shaadi.com, and an RJ workshop are also on the cards.

 Spring Fest 2005 had a village theme and featured bands like Indian Ocean and Strings.

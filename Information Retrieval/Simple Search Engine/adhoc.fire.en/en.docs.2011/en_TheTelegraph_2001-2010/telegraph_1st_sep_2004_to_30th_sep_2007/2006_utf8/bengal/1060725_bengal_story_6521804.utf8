The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 CAG suggests closure of 39 PSUs

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, July 24: The Comptroller and Auditor Generals office has recommended closure of 39 state public sector undertakings that either incurred losses over the past five years or registered turnover of less than Rs 5 crore, if their condition cant be improved.

 According to the report, tabled in the Assembly today, 19 public sector units (PSUs) had incurred losses for five consecutive years leading to their negative net worth. 

 In view of (the) poor turnover and continuous losses, the government may either improve the performance of these 39 PSUs or consider their closure, the reports states. 

 The CAG has pointed out that 53 public sector units have incurred an aggregate loss of about Rs 888 crore, of which 38 had accumulated losses of Rs 2,753 crore. If this trend continues, it would be better to close down these units, principal accountant-general (audit) Arijit Ganguly said.

 The report states that even after an expenditure of Rs 1.52 crore, the e-governance project had failed to take off because of lack of IT policy, IT strategy and IT security policy. 

 The company ? Webel Technology Ltd ? has no IT department to oversee a project of this magnitude, it added.

 A website of the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation could not be created, though Rs 32 lakh was spent. 

 Pollution contributed to higher incidence of gastric and respiratory ailments in the state, according to the report. 

 The West Bengal Power Development Corporation Ltd and Durgapur Project Ltd were rapped for failing to comply with emission norms, which resulted in losses of crores. After spending Rs 70.39 crore over a decade on replacement, renovation and modernisation of electrostatic precipitators, emission levels remained high in 18 of their 19 units.

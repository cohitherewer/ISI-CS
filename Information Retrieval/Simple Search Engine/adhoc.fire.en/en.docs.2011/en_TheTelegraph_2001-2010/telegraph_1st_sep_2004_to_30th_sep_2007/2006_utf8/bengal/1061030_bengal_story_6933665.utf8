The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Self-help groups in CPM grip

 BISWAJIT ROY

 Yunus: Not the Bengal 

 way 

Calcutta, Oct. 29: The 

 CPM may have lauded Nobel Prize winner Mohammed Yunus for 

 his micro-credit mantra to help the poor, but Bengals 

 Marxists are opposed to his NGO-driven non-political, 

 non-party model. 

 Instead, the party is all set to tighten its grip on more than 400,000 self-help groups and self-employment projects in the state, indicates the draft organisational report prepared by the CPM state committee for discussions within the party on ways to strengthen and widen its base. 

 Governments, political parties, commercial banks and foreign financial institutions have no role in Yunuss scheme. But the Left government has preferred a politically-controlled model in contrast to Yunuss, though it has lately been promoting self-help groups and has set up a department for them. 

 Finance minister Asim Dasgupta had earlier said that unlike NGO-driven micro-credit projects in Bangladesh, elected panchayats and municipalities had been engaged in facilitating self-help groups and liaising with the banks in Bengal. 

 The report reveals that the party actually controls the self-help groups. SHGs have been formed almost in every district. In some districts they are now widespread. The party monitors them to ensure smooth functioning.

 Pointing to the problems of getting funds from banks and the marketing of SHG and small producers products, the report said: Success would not be possible without comprehensive plans and monitoring by the district party units. 

 Although these responsibilities are small, they will help us win over new people, the leadership says while criticising the lower committees for losing interest in the proper functioning of the co-operatives after elections in these bodies were won.

 While the partys initiative is apparently well meaning, there is no mention of any effort to turn the micro-credit and self-reliance projects into a broad-based social movement with all parties and civil society groups. 

 Dasgupta had tried to paper over the difference between the two models by stressing that independent experiments in different countries (are conducted) in accordance with the ground reality. 

 The CPM document highlights the partys distrust of NGOs, particularly those not controlled by it. We have to be cautious about foreign-funded NGOs and ensure that none of our leaders and workers is involved in their activities, it adds.

 The document also revea-ls the dangers posed by the party hegemony. The shortcomings in guiding panchayats to give political leader- ship and ensure peoples participation in development has to be corrected.

 The clash between the partys control mechanism and popular social-political initiatives is apparent. We have to ensure peoples participation while drawing up our programmes. We have to keep in mind that political bureaucracy is more dangerous than government bureaucracy, the report warned. 

 The leadership is alarmed as villagers participation in gram sansad meetings forums meant to draw up micro-projects for village development through peoples initiatives has dipped to 14 per cent of the rural population. 

 The irony is that now the government has engaged NGOs to persuade people to attend gram sansad meetings, a CPM leader said.

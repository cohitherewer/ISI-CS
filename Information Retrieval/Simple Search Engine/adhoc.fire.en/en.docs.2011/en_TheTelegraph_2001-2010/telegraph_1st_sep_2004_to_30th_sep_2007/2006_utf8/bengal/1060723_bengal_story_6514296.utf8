 Calcutta, July 22: Sougata Dutta left Bekaa Valley, in Lebanon, for home on the morning of July 19. By afternoon, the glass factory he worked in had been reduced to rubble by Israeli air strikes, killing a colleague from Orissa and leaving three others injured.

 Dutta, 37, a supervisor at Maliban Glass Factory since October 2005, was a relieved man this afternoon, having safely reached his Panditya Road house in south Calcutta. 

 The situation is very bad. On July 16, 27 bombs were dropped near our factory?. Three days later, hours after I had boarded the bus arranged by the company to take us to Damascus, news came in that four bombs had destroyed the factory completely, killing Devesh Kumar Swain, he recounted.

 The Indian government, he said, was lackadaisical in launching a rescue bid for citizens stuck in the war zone. 

 There were over 40 Indians working in the factory, but the embassy in Lebanon did nothing. On July 16, when the bombings got really bad, we called up the embassy, where officials told us to come to Beirut. How could they expect us to go to Beirut when the road was being bombed incessantly? asked Dutta, seated with son Priyadarshi on his lap and wife Debapriya by his side.

 We spent 10 sleepless nights, sighed Debapriya.

 So did the Biswases of Tollygunge. Having fled Verdun, Ranjana Biswas and daughter Jinia cant shut out from their minds the deafening sound of bombs in the darkness of blackout or the flashes of fireballs.

 Living in fear in an alien land left Ranjana so rattled that she refused to stay back in Delhi with husband Jayanta, an external affairs ministry official. Instead, she took the first flight home with her 18-year-old daughter.

 We saw the sky lighting up every time the Beirut airport was bombed. The doors shook under the impact. Standing on our balcony, we realised this was war for real, said Ranjana.

 On July 1, the mother and daughter had left their south Calcutta home to join Jayanta, posted at the Indian embassy in Lebanon. 

 The Biswas family had planned to set up home away from home for two years, in the plush Abdul Ghani Sahib Building on Riyadh Street in Verdun.

 It was great fun, till one day as we were stepping out for a visit to the local departmental store, my father called to say things were tense outside. That night, we heard the first sound of firing. From next morning, the war began. As darkness fell, the bombing began, recalled Jinia, who passed her ISC this year.

 On July 16, we received an alert from the Indian embassy telling us to pack up and leave, carrying as little as we could. The next day, some 26 of us took a bus from Beirut to Damascus. On Wednesday, July 19, we reached Delhi via Kuwait, said Ranjana.

 Back home, the duo is relieved but regrets deserting such a beautiful land. If the war stops, we would love to return, smiles Jinia.

 Calcutta, July 19: If Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has won the hearts of industrialists with words sweet to investors, it was Biman Boses turn to try the same today. 

 Shedding his hardliner image, the Left Front chairman and state CPM secretary addressed the Indian Chamber of Commerce executive committee for over two hours today and charmed capitalists. 

 It was an interactive session where we questioned him on the partys stand on issues like land acquisition, work culture and labour laws. He was really candid and we are happy?. said S.K. Bangur, the president of the chamber. 

 But it was not just candour that made Bose an instant hit. The successor of Promode Dasgupta, Saroj Mukherjee and Anil Biswas scored by stressing that there was a convergence of the partys interest and that of industry. I wont say that we are travelling on the same boat. But our interests are the same as we all want faster development in Bengal, admitted Bose. 

 The trend might not go down well with a section of the party, but the same thing has happened in China, where party leaders have an institutionalised communication channel with industrialists. 

 There is a need for continuous dialogue with the party and with todays interaction, the bridge has been built, said the chambers secretary-general, Nazeeb Arif. 

 Flanked by Bangur and vice-president Sanjay Budhia, Bose fielded a volley of questions from industrialists like Gaurav Swarup, J.P. Chaudhry, K.K. Bangur and A.V. Lodha at the chambers committee room. 

 He kicked off the session by making it clear that the policies pursued by the government had the partys seal of approval. There is no disconnect between Writers Buildings and Alimuddin Street, stressed Bose during the first such formal interaction between a CPM secretary in Bengal and industrialists. 

 Bose promised the captains of industry that the party and the government would ensure availability of land for industry and would make necessary amendments in existing laws to ensure that land acquisition was fast and hassle-free. 

 The CPM leader, who had once supported political rallies on workdays and shutdowns in 24X7 industries, today said the party was against any indisciplined agitation. We are very much in favour of a proper work culture in the state, which applies to everyone.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Woman thrashed, tonsured amp; tarred

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 29: Sixty-year-old Sreemati Bar was stripped, tonsured and smeared with tar on the face for occupying a piece of land that is apparently not hers.

 The mob that assaulted Sreemati on Sagar Island in South 24-Parganas on Friday included relatives of a neighbour, some of them women.

 The seriously injured woman was admitted to the local Rudranagar hospital, 150 km from Calcutta. 

 Two women ? Anjali Pramanick and Meera Pramanick ? were arrested today. Eight others, including a few members of the Pramanick family, who are Sreematis neighbours, are absconding.

 Anjali and Meera were produced in court and remanded in a fortnights jail custody.

 Police said the dispute over the one-bigha plot at Khirpur village was brewing for some time. Both families, the Bars and the Pramanicks, claimed the land was theirs. The local panchayat held a shalishi (conciliation) meeting about 10 days ago and divided the disputed land equally between the two families. But the Pramanicks renewed their demand recently, a police officer said.

 Around noon last Friday, Sreemati was passing through a muddy road close to her house when some people dragged her into the Pramanicks. 

 The FIR said they beat her up, stripped her, shaved her head and smeared her face with tar. 

 Neither Sreematis farmer husband Anil nor son Abanti was at home then. They had gone to work in the fields. 

 When she staggered home bleeding and incoherent, other residents of the neighbourhood took her to the hospital. 

 Doctors there said her condition is still critical. 

 On returning home, Anil and Abanti went to the local police station and lodged a complaint. 

 Initially, the police hesitated to arrest the accused as the Pramanicks are rich and influential. We had to pressure them to do so, said Bankim Hazra, the local Trinamul Congress MLA.

 Santanu Jana, the Trinamul pradhan of Muriganga panchayat, said: We had never imagined that the Praman-icks could do this. When she (Sreemati) returned home on Friday, she was bleeding profusely.... She was traumatised and could not utter a word.

 Additional superintendent of police (rural) A.K. Prasad said the accused would be picked up at the earliest.

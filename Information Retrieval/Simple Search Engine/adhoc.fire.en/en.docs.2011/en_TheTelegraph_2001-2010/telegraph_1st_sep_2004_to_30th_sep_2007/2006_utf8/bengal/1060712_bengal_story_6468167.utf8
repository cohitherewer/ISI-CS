The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 CM seeks PM help for port

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Calcutta, July 11: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today sought the Prime Ministers support to speed up some of the major infrastructure projects, the deep-sea port off Sagar island and a green- field airport among them. 

 I have apprised him about the overall investment scenario in the state, particularly the major new investment proposals that we have received? Reliance, ITC, Dabur, Videocon, Bhattacharjee, who had a one-to-one meeting with Manmohan Singh at Raj Bhavan earlier, said at Writers Buildings.

 I have also sought the Prime Ministers help to expedite the deep-sea port project. The Planning Commission has floated tender for a feasibility study for the project. The new port is vital for the two special economic zones that we are planning at Haldia, he added. 

 Bhattacharjee told Singh a private investor would build the new airport. He asked me are you ready to make it a private sector project? I said yes, that is our policy, he said.

 During the one-to-one, Singh assured Bhattacharjee that Bengals demand for a national iron ore policy, enabling states without iron ore deposits to share the resource for their industries, would be discussed at the next inter-state council meeting. 

 The Prime Minister informed Bhattacharjee in a letter yesterday that Bengal would get 45 per cent of the power generated by the Tala hydel project in Bhutan. 

 Congress leaders who met Singh said he also discussed with the chief minister the formation of a national land commission in view of the tension brewing in several states, including Bengal, over acquisition of land for industry.

 A picnic to shun polls

 Gouripur, Uluberia, April 22: The red brick road could barely allow a four-wheeler through. A narrow sanko (man-made narrow bridge) was the only passage between the freshly dug pond and the villages beyond. The writing here was on the mud walls, the tree trunks, and the placards ? not about the ballot, but about the boycott. In this part of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees Bengal, it was picnic time, not poll time.

 Some 850 voters ? all residents of Bhuyepara, Sheikhpara, Berapara, Samantapara, Daluipara and Karmakarpara of Gouripur in Uluberia (South) ? boycotted todays Assembly elections in protest against a total lack of development in their villages.

 There is no electricity, no water and no roads. Unless we have these we have decided not to participate in this democratic process, said Kanailal Samanta, member of the boycott committee and former anchal pradhan of the gram panchayat.

 A vote bhoj of khichudi, alu potoler dom and aamer chatni had been organised for close to 2,500 people, in a huge white shamiana at the village centre.

 And the picnickers made a meal of Bhattacharjees development bandwagon that is yet to trundle into these villages, a 90-minute drive from Writers Buildings.

 We know we are forsaken. Nothing is going to happen here. So why should we participate in the elections? demanded Sheikh Badradiya, 37. If our elected representative has failed to do anything for us for the past 30 years, then it is better not to elect anyone at all.

 When MLA Rabin Mandal of the Forward Bloc was approached by these voters, his answer was a predictable: Let me win first, then I will do something for you.

 But the villagers had waited enough. Tuhina Sadhu Khan, the womans representative in the boycott committee, said the decision to end this five-yearly farce was pre-meditated. 

 We spoke to the district officials who said there was nothing wrong as the protests were peaceful.

 The protests were peaceful and potent. Celebrating this moment of turning their backs on a democratic process that had yielded nothing was the order of the day. Janhavi Samanta, who after a sumptuous lunch sat down with her neighbours to watch news on their poll boycott on a TV running on a motor, said: How long can we live without water? There is only one tubewell for 2,200 people? Children study by the light of the lantern.

 Sk Badradiya, living in Sheikhpara for generations, says his grandfather and father used to work in the mills now shut, but he has never been able to find a job. His disillusionment with the rulers of this land is complete.

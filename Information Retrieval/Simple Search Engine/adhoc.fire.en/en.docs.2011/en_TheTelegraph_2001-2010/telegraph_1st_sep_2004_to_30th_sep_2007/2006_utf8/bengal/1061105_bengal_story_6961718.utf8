The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Drive to purge multiple PAN

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Nov. 4: If you are among Bengals 1.68 lakh possessing multiple PAN cards, submit them to the income-tax department before December 31. Otherwise, you will attract legal action along with a penalty of Rs 10,000 for every additional card.

 The income-tax department has initiated a drive across the country to weed out the menace of individuals and companies possessing multiple PAN cards.

 If a person is found holding more than one PAN card from January 1, 2007, he or she will be penalised with Rs 10,000 for every additional card in his or her possession, said Gautam Choudhuri, income-tax commissioner (information technology).

 Possession of multiple PAN cards is a serious legal offence, cautioned Dilip Das, the chief commissioner in the Bengal circle. Our estimate is that there are 1.68 lakh duplicate cards in the state, he said. 

 The income-tax department has so far issued 36 lakh PAN cards to individuals and companies in the state.

 The department is in the process of identifying people across the country who possess more than one PAN card. 

 The defaulters on the departments list are being intimated by post and the rest have to hand over the cards voluntarily. 

 The problem is less in Bengal compared with Mumbai and Delhi, Das said.

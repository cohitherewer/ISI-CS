The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 BRIEFS

 Barrackpore, March 20: The station here turned into a war zone and the special train, Chetana, used to hold trials of ticket-less travellers, was set afire after railway police allegedly assaulted a free-tripper. 

 Trains on the Seal- dah-Barrackpore sect-ion were disrupted as the mob squatted on tracks. 

 Chetana arrived here at 6 pm. The jawans, who asked Madhyamgram trader Sandip Sadhukhan to show his ticket, allegedly hit him when he failed to do so. Seeing him wailing, onlookers attacked the jawans, who tried to flee. Around 9.45, the mob set a Chetana coach ablaze. There was nobody inside. Two fire tenders doused the fire in 20 minutes. RPF inspector R. Singh denied the assault charge and said the passengers started brickbatting them to thwart the drive.

 Calcutta: Inspired by his grandchildren, Ram Chandra Baidya is writing his HS exam from Diamond Harbour High School. The 70-year-old resident of Kulpi, South 24-Parganas, passed Class X in 1950 but could not continue studies. A former secretary of Radhanagar panchayat, 60 km from Calcutta, Baidya has four sons, two daughters and several grandchildren.

 Calcutta: Former mayor Subrata Mukherjees nomination to Rajya Sabha as a Congress candidate has been declared valid. Trinamul Congress candidate Mukul Roy had objected to the nomination saying he was still a Nationalist Congress Party councillor.

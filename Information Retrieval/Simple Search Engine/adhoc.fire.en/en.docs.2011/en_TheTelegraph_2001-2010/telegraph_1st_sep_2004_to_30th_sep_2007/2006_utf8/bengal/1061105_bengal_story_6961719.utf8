 Police stir on shutout stations 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Nov. 4: Police have launched an inquiry into the plight of Krishna Kumar Pandey, who was made to run from one police station to another after being battered by robbers in a taxi.

 The gang thrashed Pandey on Thursday in the taxi on Ho Chi Minh Sarani before snatching his salary of Rs 8,000 and a gold chain he had bought for his wife.

 After the incident of police harassment came to light, senior officers started the inquiry. A team of officers from the detective department went to a private healthcare unit where Pandey is admitted but could not elicit a blow-by-blow description as he was not in a position to talk.

 It is a fact that the victim had to go from one police station to another. Even after seeing him bleeding, officers of three thanas Bhowanipore, Ballygunge and Shakespeare Sarani forced him to show the site of crime and the place where he was thrown off the running taxi, said a senior official.

 It definitely has tarnished our image. We cannot understand why the officers refused to receive the complaint, he added.

 With a bruised eye and blood oozing from his nose and mouth, Pandey, an employee of a share broking firm, had waited at Ballygunge police station for over an hour to lodge the complaint. 

 But the officer on duty asked him to go to another police station, saying the site of crime did not fall under his precincts jurisdiction.

 Employer Krishna Prasad, who accompanied Pandey to the police stations, said they were asked to wait for half-an-hour at Shakespeare Sarani police station.

 An officer started asking irrelevant questions like why he kept a gold chain in the bag and why he was carrying Rs 8,000, said Prasad. Another 30 minutes were spent on questions like how he was punched.

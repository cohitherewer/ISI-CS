 Citu steps in to clear Singur air

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Chinsurah, Aug. 13: Alarmed by the tiny list of farmers willing to part with their land in Singur, Citu has decided to step in to find a solution.

 District magistrate Vinod Kumar said yesterday that only 20 of the 4,000 farmers whose plots have been notified for acquisition by Tata Motors for its small car manufacturing unit, have consented to give up their land in Singur in Hooghly district about 45 km from Calcutta.

 On Saturday, Citu, the CPMs labour arm, will hold a rally in Kamarkundu, one of the five mouzas in Singur that have been earmarked for the Tata project, which requires 1,013 acres.

 Citu leaders, including its state president Shyamal Chakraborty, will address the rally that will attempt to drive home the ruling Left Fronts objectives and try to clear misgivings of the farmers.

 The rally will help us woo the farmers to sign the consent forms, said Citu district secretary Dilip Chatterjee, who will oversee preparations for the rally.

 The trade union leaders will also tell farmers what is in store for them once the project is in place. 

 Misguided farmers have to be persuaded to hand over their land by making them aware about the advantages of the governments industrialisation drive, said Anil Basu, the CPM MP from Arambagh. 

 Farmers must clearly understand the objective behind offering land and what is in store after the Tatas set up the factory. It seems there are certain misgivings, particularly about the price to be offered for the land and even about job opportunities. Well try to address them so that there is no confusion, Basu said.

 A senior CPM leader from Hooghly said the poor response of the farmers even after the Krishak Sabha had worked hard to address their fears comes as a major setback to us. It appears that some of our party workers, too, are not convinced and there is a simmering discontent. This is precisely why Citu has been roped in.

 The farmers, however, are defiant. We are not going to yield under pressure. The decision to allow Citu to step into Singur is aimed at ensuring that the Left Front doesnt lose its ground in a battle that is already lost, said Becharam Manna of the Krishi Jami Banchao Committee.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Chikungunya kits on way

 SANJAY MANDAL

 Calcutta, Oct. 17: The state will receive its first chikungunya and Japanese encephalitis test kits this week.

 The Pune-based National Institute of Virology will despatch the kits tomorrow to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), Calcutta. We are sending the kits to the ICMR so that tests can be done there, the director of the National Institute of Virology, A. Mishra, told The Telegraph over the phone from Pune. Initially, one chikungunya and one Japanese encephalitis kit will be sent.

 The ICMR and the School of Tropical Medicine, Calcutta, had asked for the kits.

 Experts said the Japanese encephalitis virus is present in and around Calcutta and there can be an outbreak any time if proper steps are not taken. Japanese encephalitis is caused by the Culex vishnuii mosquito, which bites at night. Earlier, the theory was that the disease is essentially prevalent in rural areas but cases have now been found in urban areas, said an expert.

 Nearly 1,300 villagers in the Baduria and Swarupnagar blocks of North 24-Parganas are down with fever, showing symptoms of chikungunya and dengue. News of more cases poured into the district headquarters today.

 As soon as the kit arrives, we will start collecting blood samples from the affected villages, said Shyamalendu Chatterjee of ICMRs virus unit. He said 92 samples could be tested with one kit.

 Using the kit, the presence of the chikungunya virus can be confirmed within 48 hours. The School of Tropical Medicine conducts chikungunya tests using an older method that takes a few weeks to confirm the presence of the virus in blood.

 Burdwan, Dec. 27: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee wants his policemen to show their friendly face to people when they come to register complaints. But they dont seem to be listening.

 A 37-year-old man from Burdwan was made to run from one police station to another to register a complaint of harassment against his brother-in-law, as his sister lay in hospital, battered and bruised.

 Bidhan Pathak of Sripalli, 110 km from Calcutta, finally wrote to district police chief Peeyush Pandey, who today asked Burdwan police to start an investigation.

 The police have to register a complaint if somebody approaches a police station. I have to probe why this was not done, Pandey said.

 Bidhans sister Sumita married Brindaban Mukherjee, a resident of Kalna, about 45 km from Burdwan, two-and-a-half years ago.

 According to Bidhan, Rs 50,000 in cash and gold jewellery worth Rs 60,000 were given to Brindaban, who owns 10 bighas of land, as dowry. But he wanted more and began harassing his bride from the first day. 

 Bidhan, who earns little by supplying stationery items to schools and colleges in Burdwan town, could not meet his demands. 

 On the afternoon of December 14, all hell broke loose. Brindaban locked up my sister in a room, tied her hands and legs with a rope and thrashed her with a bamboo stick. He also bit her arms, legs and other parts of the body. But Brindabans parents, Radharaman and Purnima, his elder brother Prabir and his wife Ranu did not come to my sisters rescue, Bidhan said in his complaint.

 Drawn by Sumitas cries, neighbours came running to their house. They informed Bidhan and he took her to hospital.

 On December 14, I could have been murdered had some neighbours not come to my help, Sumita, 34, said from her hospital bed. 

 Caught up with Sumitas treatment, Bidhan could go to the police only on December 19. But officers of Kalna police station told him he should have gone to Burdwan police station as Sumita was admitted in a hospital there. 

 But the next day, Bidhan was turned away from Burdwan police station as well. Why did you come here? Youd better go to the police station in Kalna where your sister was tortured, Bidhan quoted an official as saying.

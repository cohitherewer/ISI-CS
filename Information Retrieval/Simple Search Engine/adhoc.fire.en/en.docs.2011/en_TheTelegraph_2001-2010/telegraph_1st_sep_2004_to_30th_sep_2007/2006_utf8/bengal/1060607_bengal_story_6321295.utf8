The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Online lottery claims a life

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

Suri, June 6: A young lottery ticket hawker 

who invested all his savings in the on-line version after learning about the Calcutta 

man who hit the Rs 17-crore jackpot committed suicide here this morning. 

Abhinay Mandal, 25, hanged himself in his house at 

Nuraipara, about 235 km from Calcutta. He was bankrupt.

 Last night, he did not have a rupee to buy food for his wife and one-year-old daughter. 

 Abhinays wife Buri saw the body hanging from the ceiling of their thatched hut around 5 am today. She had married him a year-and-a-half ago. 

 On May 25, scrap iron trader Jayprakash Jaiswal won Rs 17,29,15,375, a record for online lottery in the country. The news made headlines and Abhinay thought that was where his luck lay.

 A Suri police station officer said Abhinay roamed the streets of Suri with the lottery tickets in hand. Everyone knew him by face.

 His wife said he used to earn Rs 30-50 in a day. Sometimes, he returned home empty handed. He started putting his money into the online business a couple of mon-ths back. But he poured everything into it after knowing that someone had won several crores.

 Last night, Buri had screamed at Abhinay for this change. He did not answer. He was just listening to what I had to say. He did not eat anything and went to sleep. I woke up this morning to see him dead. 

 When I searched the small container in which I secretly deposited coins for emergencies, I found it empty. He had even taken out my very small savings and invested them in the lottery, she said.

 The young wife did not realise when the man lying by her side slipped out of bed and pulled out one of her saris to tie the noose around his neck.

 The little girl could not understand why her mother was sobbing this morning.

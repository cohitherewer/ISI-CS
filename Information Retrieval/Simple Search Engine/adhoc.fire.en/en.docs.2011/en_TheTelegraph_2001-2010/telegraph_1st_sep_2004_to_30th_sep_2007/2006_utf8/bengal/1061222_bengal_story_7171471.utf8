 Double shot at suicide

 Chinsurah, Dec. 21: A 30-year-old woman committed suicide by crawling on to the tracks in the path of a speeding train after her leg was chopped off in a failed first attempt.

 Krishna Sarkar of Rajarambali village in Singur, jumped on the tracks before the Calcutta-bound New Delhi-Sealdah Rajdhani Express around half a kilometre from Balarambati station, about 35 km from Calcutta.

 She was knocked off the tracks but lost her right leg. Desperate to end her life, the woman then crawled back to the tracks and was run over by the Calcutta-bound Sealdah-Varanasi Express.

 Police said Krishna had committed suicide because of family problems.

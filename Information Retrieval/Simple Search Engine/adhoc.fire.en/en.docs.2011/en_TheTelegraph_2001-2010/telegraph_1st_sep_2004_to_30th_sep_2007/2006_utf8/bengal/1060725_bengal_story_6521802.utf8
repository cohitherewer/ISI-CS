The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Buddha sends jumbo SOS

 JAYANTA BASU

 Calcutta, July 24: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has complained to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh about the serious threat to animals in north Bengal because of the gauge conversion of railway tracks.

 In the letter, he has also accused the railways of not caring two hoots about recommendations made by a Calcutta High Court-appointed expert committee.

 There is a serious threat to our magnificent fauna, arising out of the gauge conversion of New Jalpaiguri-New Bongaigaon railway track, Bhattacharjee wrote in his letter, dated June 5. 

 In end-May, three elephants and a bison were run over by trains speeding across north Bengal forests in a span of a few hours.

 WWF-India had earlier filed a public interest litigation in the high court opposing the gauge conversion as it feared a threat to the animals in the region. 

 Wider gauge tracks allow trains to travel faster. 

 The court had disposed of the PIL asking the railways to implement a set of recommendations prescribed by an expert committee.

 The chief minister wrote that the panels recommendations, like adhering to speed restrictions, are not being followed.

 I will personally take up the matter with the railways, Union minister of environment and forests A. Raja promised at a meeting of the Project Elephant Steering Committee in Delhi last week. 

 Bhattacharjees letter was forwarded to him by the PMO. 

 The chief minister has suggested that the railways constitute a committee to oversee the implementation of all recommendations of the expert committee, such as a speed limit and identification of animal corridors in forest and non-forest areas.

 Arjun Rakhit, the divisional railway manager, Alipurduar, however, said: We have fulfilled all eleven recommendations of the expert committee, spending nearly 1.47 crore.

 He accused the forest department of failing to provide information on the movement of herds towards railway tracks.

 The forest department termed such 

 a suggestion impractical. Atanu Raha, the principal 

 chief conservator of forests, said: There are around 

 20 corridors in the stretch and trains need to have an overall 

 speed restriction.

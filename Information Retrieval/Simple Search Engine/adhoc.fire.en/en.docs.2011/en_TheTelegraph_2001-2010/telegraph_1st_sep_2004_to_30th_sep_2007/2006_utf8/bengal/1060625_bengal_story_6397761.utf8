 Suicide boy dies on hospital floor

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 24: Caught in a maze of protocol to be followed for shifting a patient from a government hospital, Aritra Mukhopadhyay died on the floor of Medical College Hospital this evening.

 By the time the 18-year-olds friends from South Point High School and their parents found a way to shift him and his father to BR Singh Hospital, he lay dead on the floor of the medicine ward. 

 Aritra died a little over 24 hours after his mother Gouri passed away. 

 The boy and his parents had consumed poison to escape a debt trap. The Ballygunge residents had checked into a north Calcutta hotel concealing their identities before attempting suicide.

 Aritra had quit school after Class XI because his father could not bear the financial burden. 

 As the news of his death spread, his friends and relatives gheraoed the hospital deputy superintendent, who later filed an FIR against them.

 Aritras father Manoj Mukhopadhyay is still at Medical College Hospital.

 Wed been trying to shift them since 8.30 am, said Aritras school friend Spandan Roy Choudhury. 

 Not that the shift would have ensured his recovery but a better hospital with a well-equipped ICU and a ventilator would have helped. 

 But SSKM Hospital merely promised to put Aritras name on top of the waiting list for ventilator support. 

 A string of nursing ho- mes refused admission saying it was a police case and some others quoted exorbitant security deposits. 

 Aritras father had been a railway employee.

 When one of his friends finally found a place at BR Singh, a railway hospital, the medical college came up with several forms that had to be filled up before the father and son could be shifted. 

 Our real trial began from this point. First, we had to go to Jorasanko police station for a no-objection certificate. Then the hospital sought an application for a discharge of release bond. Then we were directed to Bowbazar police for their clearance. It was an endless journey from one table to another, said Sanjoy Paramanik, who had accompanied Manojs brother Manas all the way from Shantipur. 

 The hospital said there was no delay. Deputy superintendent Amarendra Biswas said: When I received the application for the bond it was 4.50 pm. There should have been someone in the crowd who knew how to go about it. One has to go by the rule book.

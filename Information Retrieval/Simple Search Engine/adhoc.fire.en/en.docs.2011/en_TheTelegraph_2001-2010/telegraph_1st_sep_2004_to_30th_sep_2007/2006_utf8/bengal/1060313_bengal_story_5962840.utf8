 Bolly dreams die in Beldanga

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Behrampore, March 12: Main Madhuri Dixit Banna Chahti Hoon could well have been filmed on the adventures of four girls between seven and 10.

 But their Bollywood dreams were wrecked at Beldanga station in Murshidabad. 

 Desperate to be Madhuri Dixit and Kareena Kapoor, Taslima Khatoon, 11, Tanjula Khatoon, 10, Sahida Khatoon, 7, and Hasima Khatoon, 7, fled their homes at Naodapanar village on the outskirts of Behrampore town yesterday. Their destination ? Mumbai.

 We are very fond of Madhuri and Kareena. We had pla- nned the Mumbai trip to get ourselves jobs as domestic helps in their houses. Then we could coax them into getting us roles in films and establish ourselves as successful actors, Taslima said after being detained by the Government Railway Police (GRP).

 The four told their parents they were going to school and left home around 10 am. 

 They walked 4 km to reach a crossing from where they boarded a bus to Behrampore station. For children of their age, they proved pretty good at planning. They boarded the Lalgola-Sealdah train at noon. From there they had planned to go to Howrah and book tickets on a train to Mumbai, said Sukumar Mitra, a GRP assistant sub-inspector who saw them in a corner of a packed compartment.

 I had a hunch that they had fled home, Mitra said. I went up to them and asked where they were going. But they were not ready to divulge anything. 

 The girls were taken off the train in Beldanga and have been handed to their families.

 Tanjulas father Moslem Sheikh, a rickshaw-puller, thanked the police. I had no idea that my daughter and her friends were planning to become Bombay stars, he said.

 In November 2004, four Class VI and VIII boys had tried to reach Mumbai from Goaljan in Behrampore. Their aim in life was to be like Shah Rukh Khan. They were caught in Howrah.

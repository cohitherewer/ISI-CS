The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Steel park in the pipeline

 ABHIJEET CHATTERJEE 

 Durgapur, Aug. 14: The 

 government has decided to set up a steel and iron park, 

 the first of its kind in the state, on 500 acres near Durgapur.

 The Asansol-Durgapur Development Authority (Adda) is looking for land in Sovapur and Sagarbhanga near the steel township, about 200 km from Calcutta. 

 It will also approach officials of the Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) to provide their unutilised land in Durgapur for the project.

 We think that Durgapur is ideal for such a project as it has a number of large and small steel plants like the Durgapur Steel Plant, Alloy Steel Plant and Indian Iron and Steel Company. It is high time we set up such a park in the largest steel hub in the state, said industry minister Nirupam Sen.

 The construction work on the steel and iron park will begin by 2008 and will be completed in the next five years, said Biprendu Chakraborty, a board member of Adda and Durgapur MLA. 

 The park will house manufacturing units of steel utensils and sheets, and automobile accessories.

 We expect an investment of around Rs 5,000 crore in the park. A sum of Rs 200 crore would be required to buy land and build infrastructure. Besides, we also expect to generate employment for around 6,000 people, Chakraborty said.

 The Adda is also looking to invite steel and iron companies to set up their units at the park. Its chairman and Asansol MP Bansagopal Choudhury said several companies have expressed interest. 

 We are holding talks with Jai Balaji Steels and the Shivaji Group and they have expressed their wish to set up their units. Some Tamil Nadu-based major utensil-making companies will be invited. We will also approach SAIL for setting up a mini plant there. But no polluting industries like sponge iron factories will be allowed to come up, Choudhury said.

 The steel companies that will set up shop in the park will mainly convert semi-finished goods into finished items, the MP added.

 Besides setting up the Steel and Iron Park the state government has also instructed the ADDA to arrange another 100 acres of land within its area for automobile accessories major Bharat Forge Ltd, which has approached the government for setting up a factory in the state. 

 Bharat Forge Ltd has demanded 100 acres from the state to set up their factory in Durgapur or Kharagpur. The main raw material for the automobile industry is ferroalloy and in the Asansol-Durgapur belt the state has 14 ferroalloy plants presently and many are in the pipeline. So we felt Durgapur will get priority over Kharagpur to set up any automobile accessory factory. We have identified 100 acres of land in the new Bamunnara--Gopalpur industrial complex near Durgapur, said NS Nigam, chief executive officer of ADDA.

 The Tata Group is setting up their small car unit at Singur in Hooghly--neighbouring district of Burdwan. So if anyone set up automobile accessories unit in Durgapur it would be better. However the choice of land is up to the company. They are welcomed in Durgapur and Kharagpur both, said industry minister Sen. 

 ADDA officials said that a team from Bharat Forge Ltd would visit the site in BamunnaraGopalpur industrial complex after the pujas. 

 Ends.

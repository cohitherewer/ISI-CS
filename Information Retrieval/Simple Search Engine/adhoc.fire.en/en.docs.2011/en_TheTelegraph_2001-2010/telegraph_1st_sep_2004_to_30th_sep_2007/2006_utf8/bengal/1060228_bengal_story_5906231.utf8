The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Hi-tech facility for boom town waste

 - Benefit also for faraway Asansol-Durgapur

 NARESH JANA

 Midnapore, Feb. 27: A Rs 54-crore solid waste management plant is ready to run in the industrial hub of Haldia.

 The Haldia Development Authority has implemented the joint-sector project with the help of Andhra Pradesh-based Ramky Enviro Engineers ? the private company has invested Rs 50 crore and the authority has pitched in with Rs 4 crore and the 72 acres on which West Bengal Waste Management Ltd has come up. 

 With several industries already in operation and many others in the pipeline and the township booming with the surge of activities, we desperately needed a solid waste management plant, said Surendra Gupta, the chief executive officer of the authority. 

 The site engineer in charge of the project, Arindam Kar, said: We have a most modern laboratory where the solid waste would be analysed. Then we will decide the nature of treatment they would require. 

 At the moment, the plant has a capacity to treat 100,000 lakh tonnes of solid waste annually. Industries in Haldia now generate about 5,000 tonnes of solid waste every year. 

 The state government has earmarked 14,000 acres to set up a special economic zone and the Centre is planning to build a chemical hub. So, waste management in the port town had to be state of the art. 

 Authority officials said the plant was the first of its kind in eastern India. 

 Kar added: We have set up such plants in Hyderabad and Mumbai but in Haldia we have used the latest technology, which makes it the most modern.

 The waste treatment plant will not cater Haldia alone. 

 Gupta said: Industries from the Durgapur, Asansol and Kharagpur industrial zones can also bring over their waste for treatment.

 Asansol and Durgapur together generate about 40,000 tonnes of solid waste annually.

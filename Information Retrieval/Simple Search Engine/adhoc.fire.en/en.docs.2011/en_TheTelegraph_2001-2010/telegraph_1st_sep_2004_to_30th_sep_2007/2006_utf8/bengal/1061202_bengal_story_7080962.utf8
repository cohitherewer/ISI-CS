 Scared, Sector V stays home

 Calcutta, Dec. 1: Mamata Banerjee exempted IT from her bandh. Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee promised normality. But attendance in Sector V still dropped to 50 per cent. 

 Reason: Fear. If the seat of democracy could be attacked, so could be the states showpiece tech town. 

 The attendance today was less than it has been on previous bandhs. The TV images of what happened inside the Assembly yesterday and reports of disruptions in some parts of the city in the morning made people apprehensive, said D.K. Choudhury, the president of Salt Lake Initiative.

 About a fortnight later on December 14 Sector V has to brace for a 24-hour strike called by the Left trade unions, which have still not decided whether to spare IT. 

 Empty buses, vacant parking lots and idle food hawkers lamenting their loss Friday was more like a Sunday or maybe worse because many IT companies work through the week. 

 Only people working on very important projects have come, said a Cognizant Technology Solutions official. 

 A TCS official said the fleet of buses that ferries more than 500 workers brought in a little over 100 people today. 

 The consolation was that there were no untoward incidents; not even slogan shouting or flag waving. People have various reasons not to report to work on a bandh day, said Bickram Dasgupta, CEO and MD of Globsyn Technologies, where the attendance dipped to 60 per cent. 

 The question on every mind now is what will happen on December 14. 

 Given the cadre base, the Left can ensure that Sector V grinds to a halt on December 14. Well wait and watch how far the chief minister goes to ensure normality, said the CEO of an ITES company. 

 Frequent strikes are again making Brand Bengal Brand Bandh, said another.

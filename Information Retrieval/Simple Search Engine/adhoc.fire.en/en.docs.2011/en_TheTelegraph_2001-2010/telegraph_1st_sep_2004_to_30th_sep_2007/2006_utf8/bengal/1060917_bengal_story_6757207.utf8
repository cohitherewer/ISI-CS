 Calcutta, Sept. 16: The World Cup is kicking off again this autumn. From Bosepukur down south to Baguiati up north, the quadrennial showpiece is taking the field with organisers choosing football to boost footfall this Puja. 

 Parijat Club is using 30,000 balls of various sizes to decorate its pandal. These range from plastic balls of one inch diameter to the regular football. The smaller balls are being cut into a hemispheric half and pasted on panels which become Beckham or Figo or Ronaldo on the rampage. If the idol will stand under a chalchitra of mini footballs, soccer idols will stand sentry on pandal walls. 

 The choice of footballers is influenced by favourites over the years and not the 2006 edition alone. That is why Oliver Kahn, this years reserve, has edged out skipper Michael Ballack as the German representative. Maradona continues to be a favourite. If he leads the hall of fame on the Parijat Club panels, comprising Pele and Beckenbauer as well, at Udayan Sangha he is a four-foot clay figure giving company to Pele and Zidane. 

 Udayan Sangha is making its 60-ft high pandal in the shape of the FIFA trophy right down to the golden finish over the plaster of Paris coat. 

 At Parijat Club, the idol is sheltered under a football. Footballs, 15 ft high, also form the gates at Bosepukur while the Berlin Gate is replicated in Baguiati. The goddess will be in a blue sari, inspired by world champion Italys team colours. This is our tribute to the sport, which is dipping in popularity in Bengal, says club secretary Kanchan Mitra.

 The Zidane-Materazzi clash in the World Cup final is top draw among theme-makers and illuminators. We are showing the entire episode, from the war of words to the headbutt and the red card in lights on our 35-ft gate, says Maichel Bose of Dhakurias Uttarpalli. 

 At Kasba, though, it is the moment of the headbutt that is being showcased on a 20x8 ft panel. The headbutt will be the biggest hit this year, forecasts Parijat Club puja secretary Gautam Das. 

 A backlash of the Cup fever is also there in the form of Kasba Kheyali Sanghas theme Banglar football. Here, in a pandal surrounded by wooden ramparts a la Maidan, it is all local from Nagendra Prasad Sarbadhikari, the captain of Sovabazar Club that defeated a European outfit in 1892, via Mewalal and Nayar down to P.K. Banerjee and Chuni Goswami. Everyone is ready to stay up late for matches abroad but no one thinks of local football any more, laments Sanjib Mandal, a club member. 

 Which side will you roll local or global?

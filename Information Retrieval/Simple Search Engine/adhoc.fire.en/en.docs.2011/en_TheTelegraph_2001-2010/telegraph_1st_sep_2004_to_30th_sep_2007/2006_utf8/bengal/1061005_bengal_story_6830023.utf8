The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Singur cops under scanner

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, Oct. 4: The National 

 Human Rights Commission has sought an explanation from the 

 state on the September 26 police lathicharge on farmers 

 and Trinamul Congress workers in Singur, a rights lobby 

 said today. 

 The All-India Legal Aid Forum, which had moved the rights panel, claimed to have a copy of the notice commi-ssion chairman A.S. Anand has sent to chief secretary A.K. Deb.

 Our reply will reach the NHRC in due course, a senior government official said. The land acquisition in Singur will continue as planned. All agencies involved will keep farmers interests in mind, he added.

 Former Supreme Court judges J.S. Verma and Rajendrababu are believed to have written to Ratan Tata, asking him to reconsider his decision to set up the car plant in Singur and to hold direct talks with farmers. 

 Plea to put off bandh

 Fourteen Muslim organisations today asked Mamata Banerjee to defer Mondays bandh till Ramazan is over. 

 The date should be changed in the interest of Muslims, All-India Minority Forum chief Idris Ali said.

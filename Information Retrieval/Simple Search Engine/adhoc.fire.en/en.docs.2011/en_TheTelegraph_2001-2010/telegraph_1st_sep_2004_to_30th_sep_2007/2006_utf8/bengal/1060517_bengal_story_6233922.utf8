The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Mamata sees terror in Bengal

 Calcutta: The Trinamul Congress will boycott Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees swearing-in on Thursday to protest against what its chief today called state-sponsored terrorism. 

 We cannot attend Bhattacharjees abhishek (coronation) when his men have unleashed terror on our workers and supporters. There is not a semblance of democracy in Bengal, Mamata Banerjee said, an echo of what she had alleged after her defeat in 2001.

 The Trinamul leader, who has been invited to Raj Bhavan as an MP, would rather spend time with the terrorised party workers than with those who have murdered democracy. 

 After earlier elections, Mamata had complained of the CPMs scientific rigging. Today, she alleged that the CPM had resorted to hi-tech rigging by manipulating electronic voting machines.

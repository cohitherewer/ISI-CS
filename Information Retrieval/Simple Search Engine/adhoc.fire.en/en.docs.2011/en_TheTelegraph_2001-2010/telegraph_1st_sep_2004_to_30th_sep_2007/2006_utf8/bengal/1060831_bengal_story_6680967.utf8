 Malli/Kalimpong/Darjeeling, Aug. 30: Landslides caused by heavy rain claimed two lives in the hills while the main road link between Sikkim and the rest of country remained closed for 15 hours.

 A number of houses were also damaged as more than a couple of dozen landslips rocked the Kalimpong and Darjeeling subdivisions. 

 Sundar Chettri, 50, died after a pile of mud fell on the tin shop he was sleeping in at Warling Golai on Upper Cart Road in Kalimpong town. Milan Tamang, 43, the wife of a police constable, was buried alive inside her house at Sundhara Goan in Dali, 4 km from Darjeeling town.

 The biggest landslide occurred on NH 31A at Labarbote near Malli, 18 km from Kalimpong town, around two last night. Traffic was eventually restored around 4.45 pm today. 

 Around 2.30 this afternoon, the place was covered with debris and huge boulders. A long line of vehicles, mostly trucks and petrol tankers, were stranded on either side, even as officials of Border Roads Organisation (BRO), which maintains the road, worked round the clock to restore traffic.

 Despite pressing two heavy-duty earthmovers into service, the BRO men were struggling to clear away the rain-soaked earth and heavy boulders. I have been stuck here since 2 am, said the driver of a Sikkim truck at the head of the queue of vehicles.

 Many commuters walked through the debris, got to the other side of the landslip and took a different vehicle to reach their destinations. Even after the road was cleared, a massive traffic jam meant many more hours of waiting.

 In other minor slides that occurred in various parts of Kalimpong, two minors had a lucky escape when their house at Dungrabusty on Relli Road was buried under a mud pile.

 At Gokule, a portion of a bridge on the road to Deorali was damaged. In all, over 15 houses were damaged in the Darjeeling subdivision, which recorded a rainfall of 113 mm till early morning.

 The toy train service was disrupted as a boulder and an uprooted tree blocked the tracks near Nimkidhara and Bhokshijhora in Dali.

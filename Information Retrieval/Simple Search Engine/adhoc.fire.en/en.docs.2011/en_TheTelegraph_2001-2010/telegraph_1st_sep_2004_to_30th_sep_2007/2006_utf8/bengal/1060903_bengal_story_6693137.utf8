The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Hospital in plot plea

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 2: The regions first organ transplant facility will be operational in the city by 2008.

 Hyderabad-based Global Hospitals, which is setting up a 400-bed hospital on 3 acres in Rajarhat, will approach Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee for more space for a research and development wing and accommodation for patients relatives, but patient care facilities should be ready in about two years.

 Transplant of liver, heart, lungs and other organs and stem cell therapy facilities would be available in the hospital that was initially meant to sprawl over 20 acres.

 Scarcity of land near the city forced the group to scrap plans for a stem cell research centre and organ transplant training institute. The number of beds, too, was brought down from 750.

 If the government provides us the land, we can set up a residential complex for doctors and dormitories for patients relatives, said K. Ravindranath, managing director of Global Hospitals.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Farming on losing ground, says Citu

 - Survey shows agriculture jobs have dwindled, household industry has flourished

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Sept. 3: Rural Bengal had been turning away from farming for a living even before industrialisation again became a fashionable word in the state, a study by the CPM labour arm has pointed out.

 Citu argues in the docu-ment that the figures establish the inevitability of industrialisation in post-land reforms Bengal.

 According to the report titled Our job to expand organisation in unorganised sector, the percentage of non-farm workers in the state has jumped from 29.3 per cent of the to-tal workforce in the state in 1991 to 41.6 per cent in 2001. The number has increased further in the last five years, says Citu.

 People dependent on cultivation, on the contrary, have decreased to 58.4 per cent from 70.7 per cent between 1991 and 2001.

 The 2001 census report, too, said that the percentage of cultivators had come down in the preceding decade from 29.24 to 19.03 per cent of the working population in the state. The percentage of agricultural workers (cultivators and labourers) in 2001 is the lowest in last 50 years, it added. 

 Citu and the CPM attribute the fast growth of non-farm workers to the success of land reforms and the consequent boost to rural economy. 

 It has to be realised that dependence on land would decrease and the number of non-farm workers would increase as an inevitable outcome of the economic process, Citu state president Shyamal Chakraborty said.

 But the government itself is not so sure. Is it response to rising demand from local and wider markets or merely distress diversification because of lack of employment opportunities in agriculture that is prompting non-agricultural activities? asks a report of the Bureau of Applied Economics and Statistics.

 With farming becoming increasingly unprofitable because of the constant fragmentation of land, many farmers now form part of the army of workers engaged in the construction business or as domestic helps, two sectors in which Citu has yet to find a toehold.

 The census said that the percentage of household industry workers had increased from 4.24 per cent to 7.3 per cent between 1991 and 2001. The rise was higher in rural areas. 

 The Citu report acknow- ledges the need to rope in home-based workers and self-help groups as global outsourcing of jobs has brought the assembly line down to rural homes.

 In Howrah and the two 24-Parganas, non-farm workers have already outnumbered farm hands while the ratio is almost equal in Hooghly, Nadia, Malda and Murshidabad, the study says. 

 In many cases, jobless farm labourers are taking up non-farm jobs in lean periods.

 The Citu study is as much intended to find new ways to increase support base as to address the discontent over landlessness in the wake of the economic changes. 

 The government is set to acquire thousands of acres of farmland for industry and infrastructure projects, rendering many farmers, who had once got land to till because of the Lefts land reforms, landless again.

 The Opposition as well as a section of the Left Front has been accusing the government of ignoring agriculture for the sake of industry and forcing farmers to quit their inherited vocation.

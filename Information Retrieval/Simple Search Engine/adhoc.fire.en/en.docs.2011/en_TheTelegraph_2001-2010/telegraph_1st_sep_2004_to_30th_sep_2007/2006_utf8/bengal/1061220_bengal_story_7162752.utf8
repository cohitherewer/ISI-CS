The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Strike train chugs along

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Malda, Dec. 19: In this season of strikes, welcome to the latest the sentimental bandh.

 The Malda unit of Intuc, the trade union wing of the Congress, has called a 12-hour bandh in the district on December 26 to protest against the railway boards decision to extend the Gour Express to Balurghat in South Dinajpur.

 And because the sentiments of Malda residents are involved, even businessmen have threatened to pull the chain on the district.

 Not for one day, not for 48 hours, but for three days.

 Intuc district president Biswanath Guha today led a rally to the Malda divisional railway managers office to protest against the move to extend the Calcutta-Malda route from December 27. Guha said they would stage a rail-roko here tomorrow.

 Bengal parliamentary affairs minister Sailen Sarkar urged railway minister Lalu Prasad not to extend the route to Balurghat, almost 100 km away. In a letter, Sarkar said the route should not be altered because the sentiments of Malda residents were involved and added that any attempt to take the train to Balurghat might trigger law and order problems. Rather, he suggested, a separate train to Calcutta should be introduced for residents of Balurghat.

 Sarkar said the Gour Express was introduced in 1984 and used to run thrice a week. In the same year, after A.B.A. Ghani Khan Chowdhury became railway minister, it started plying every day.

 The Malda Chamber of Commerce has called a meeting tomorrow. The district secretary of the organisation said they might, at the convention, decide to call a 72-hour bandh in the district if the railways did not change the decision.

 Other parties, including the CPM and the BJP, have also threatened to launch movements.

 Union minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi has faxed a message to the railway minister, seeking his intervention to overcome the crisis.

 You know how emotionally attached the late Ghani Khan Chowdhury was to Gour Express. He himself tried to stage demonstrations whenever any attempt used to be made to alter the expresss route, the message read.

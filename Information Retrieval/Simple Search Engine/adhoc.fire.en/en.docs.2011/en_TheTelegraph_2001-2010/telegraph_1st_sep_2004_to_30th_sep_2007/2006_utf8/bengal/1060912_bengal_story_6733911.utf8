The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 HC opens tech doors for low rankers

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 11: In an interim order, the high court today directed the central selection committee of the Joint Entrance Board to counsel 6,000 students who ranked in the JEE but could not secure admission to any college. 

 Around 250 of them would be admitted to Dream Institute of Technology at Bishnupur in South 24-Parganas, where 246 seats in different streams are now lying vacant. 

 The new college was recognised by the West Bengal University of Technology on August 21, barely 10 days before the last date for admitting engineering students.

 Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurkar and Justice Nadira Patheriyas division bench, however, added that students getting admission to the college would have to abide by the final verdict of the case still pending before the court.

 Some students who ranked between 70,000 and 76,000 in JEE had moved court seeking their counselling after realising that the Dream Institute seats were vacant. Justice P.K. Chattopadhyay ordered that the 246 seats be filled up by September 12, but the JEE board moved the division bench, saying it would lead to chaos.

 The board argued that students who had ranked better might also want fresh counselling to bag seats in more coveted streams lying vacant at the new institute. Its counsel said: If students ranked poorly are admitted to courses like computer science and applied electronics, those who have done better will be aggrieved.

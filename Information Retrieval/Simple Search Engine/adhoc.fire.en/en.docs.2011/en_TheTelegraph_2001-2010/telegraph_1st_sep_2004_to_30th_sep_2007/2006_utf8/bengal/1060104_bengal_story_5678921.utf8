 Priya positive on secular pact

 New Delhi, Jan. 3: The Congress is hopeful of cobbling up a secular alternative to the Left Front, Priya Ranjan Das Munshi said here today. 

 The Union information and broadcasting minister said the state party unit was united in supporting efforts being made by Pranab Mukherjee to rope in Mamata Banerjee in the anti-Left alliance.

 Whatever we do in Bengal should be a progressive secular alternative to the Left Front, Das Munshi added. 

 State Congress leaders will meet in Calcutta on Saturday to firm up their strategy.

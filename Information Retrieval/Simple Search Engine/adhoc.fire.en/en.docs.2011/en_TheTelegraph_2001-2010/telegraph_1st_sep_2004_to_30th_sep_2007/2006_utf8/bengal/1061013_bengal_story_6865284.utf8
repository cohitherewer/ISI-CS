The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Congress pleads with Tata to stay

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Ratan Tata: Heartfelt welcome

 Calcutta, Oct. 12: Congress MLA Sudip Bandopadhyay today wrote to Ratan Tata urging him not to pull out of Bengal as that would affect the image and economy of the state. 

 Bandopadhyays letter comes a day after Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee wrote to state Congress working president Pradip Bhattacharya, requesting a joint movement against the land acquisition in Singur for a Tata Motors small-car factory. 

 I would like to learn from you whether the Tata group will pull out of Bengal if lands are not handed over by the end of this year. This disturbing news calls for a clarification as such an incident would be viewed as a big blow to Bengals economy and image, wrote Bandopadhyay, who is the chairman of the Assemblys commerce and industry standing committee.

 Let it be crystal clear that we want your project to be located in Bengal as that would go a long way in ensuring development and economic growth of the state.... We welcome you with a big heart.

 Asked to explain his stand in the wake of the Congresss plan to support the Trinamuls Singur campaign, Bandopadhyay said: We are against the state governments agriculture policy but not against the Tatas. There is no conflict between our movement to save farmland and initiatives for industrialisation.

 The Trinamul Congress, however, said there was no need to talk to the Tatas. It is the state government which is finalising the agreement. So, our party wants to get clarifications from the government rather than the Tatas, MLA Saugata Roy said.

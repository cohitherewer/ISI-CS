The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 German recce in Bengal

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 8: A clutch of German companies is now evaluating Bengal as a business destination for ship and shipyard builders. 

 A consultant engaged by some of them met chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee at Writers Buildings this morning and told him that he was on a fact-finding mission on behalf of his clients. 

 He will explore possibilities of investment in a shipbuilding and shipyard project in Bengal with an emphasis on Haldia.

 Frithjof Hennemann, the managing director of the German consultancy firm, told the chief minister this afternoon that he was keen on initiating a survey and ready to make the necessary investment in this regard.

 During his four-day stay in the city, Hennemann will visit Haldia and tour the other special economic zones around the city. After Indias excellent presentation at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Europes attention has now shifted from China to India. Were interested in Bengal because it has a very skilled workforce, but is not as developed as other places, which are nearly saturated, Hennemann said. 

 Government officials will accompany him to Haldia tomorrow. I will visit sites, speak to officials and learn about the capacity and opportunity in these places. On my return, I will place my report before my clients, he said. 

 The consultant declined to name his shipbuilder clients.

 A shipbuilding yard is likely to involve investment worth several hundred crores.

 Mollah now promotes acquisition for Salim

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 11: After crying foul about the acquisition of agricultural land for industry, land and land reforms minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah will himself prepare ground for plot takeover in his backyard South 24-Parganas for a string of Salim Group projects.

 Were preparing the ground for a smooth acquisition. We are also interacting with the Opposition parties. So far, their response has been mixed, Mollah said today.

 He was confident that once the South 24-Parganas farm- ers come to know about the compensation that their Hooghly counterparts would be getting, they would part with their plots easily. Once the compensation amount for the Singur farmers is declared, I am sure many farmers in South 24-Parganas will come forward to give up their land.

 Tata Motors wants around 1,200 acres for its small-car unit at Singur. 

 The Salim Group needs around 10,000 acres in South 24-Parganas 2,500 acres for the Barasat-Raichak expressway, 3,750 acres for the Baruipur township and 1,500 acres at Bhangar for a health city, knowledge city and a township.

 Mollahs department will begin acquiring land for the expressway by the year-end.

 He had earlier triggered a debate by threatening to resign in a letter to then CPM secretary Anil Biswas, protesting against the acquisition of 4,000 acres of farmland for an IT park near Calcutta airport.

 The minister today said that the local unit of the CPM farmers wing, the Krishak Sabha, the panchayat and the district party unit are also involved in the exercise to drum up support for land acquisition.

 Mollah has begun attending meetings of the partys zonal units and the district committee to highlight the benefits of giving up land voluntarily. 

 Many of the 22 CPM zonal committees in South 24-Parganas are believed to be opposed to the acquisition.

 Our party workers will explain to the people the compensation package as well as the benefits of urbanisation at the district, block and panchayat levels. The expressway will change the economy of the area, Mollah said.

 The government pressed Mollah into service to avoid a Singur rerun. There, farmers had gheraoed Tata officials on a recce, protesting against the acquisition of farmland.

 According to the package drawn up by Mollahs department, farmers at Singur would get 140 per cent of their plots market value if they hand them over willingly.

 The cost of mono-crop land at Singur has been estimated at Rs 7.5 lakh an acre. Double crop land will fetch around Rs 11.15 lakh an acre.

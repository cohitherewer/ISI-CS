 Salim looks up dairy

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Kalyani, May 17: Two officials of the Indonesia-based Salim Group today visited Haringhata in Nadia to see if the ailing state-run dairy farm can be revived.

 The Salim team, headed by Kevin Sietho, managing director of the Indonesia-Australia Milk Industries, said he was satisfied with the infrastructure of the Haringhata farm, about 45 km from Calcutta.

 We have come here to see the production units and the possibility of setting up a milk processing unit in the Haringhata dairy farm in the coming days. What impressed us more is that the state-run dairy farm has a lot of unused physical infrastructure, which needs to be utilised, Sietho said. 

 Accompanied by additional director of Haringhata K.K. Saha and sub-divisional officer of Kalyani Samit Das, the team inspected the dairy farm and its production units. The officials also visited the cowshed and the Frozen Semen Project Centre.

 Haringhata, one of the best run dairy farms in Asia in the sixties and seventies, is now struggling to survive, farm officials said. It produces about 6,000 litres of milk every day, less than one-fifth its supply a few decades ago. 

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee decided to invite the Salim Group to revive the ailing dairy sector last year when it signed a memorandum of understanding with the state government for a proposed township in South 24-Parganas on the outskirts of Calcutta. 

 Benny Santoso, the chief of the Salim-Siputra group, too, visited Haringhata last year to check whether the farm could be revived.

 Although Sietho said nothing has been finalised yet, the state government is confident of a positive response from the Indonesian group. Once milk experts like Sietho have visited the site, the declaration of the venture is only a matter of time, said a senior government official. 

 Sietho said talks are on with the state government to decide whether it would be a joint venture or if the group would buy the farm.

 We have been unable to carry out proper marketing of our products. If they invest here, the marketing of our products would get a great fillip, Saha, the additional director of the farm, said.

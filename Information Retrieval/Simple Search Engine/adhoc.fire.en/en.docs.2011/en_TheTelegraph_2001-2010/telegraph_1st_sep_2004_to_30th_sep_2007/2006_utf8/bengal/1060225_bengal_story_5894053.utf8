 Calcutta, Feb. 24: Unhappy over the insignificant number of names deleted from the poll rolls in four districts, the chief electoral officer is planning to initiate a fresh voter verification drive there.

 Debasish Sen left for Purulias Manbazar block this evening to check out with district officials why suo motu deletions in the district have been far less than other places. 

 Bankura, Burdwan and Darjeeling have also reported very low deletion of names.

 On returning from Purulia, Ill consider going to these districts, too. Our officials are studying the final electoral rolls to unearth discrepancies, Sen said.

 On the rolls released on Wednesday, 21 lakh new names have been included and about 13 lakh old ones deleted. 

 As the Election Commission is monitoring the poll preparations strictly, there may be yet another round of deletions on the supplementary list, a poll panel official said.

 The commission has told Sen that the verification should continue till the filing of nominations and there should not be any let-up in action.

 Twenty commission observers will come down to Calcutta on March 1 and visit all the 19 districts to ascertain whether people have any complaints regarding the final rolls.

 Headmaster plea

 The high court today rejected the anticipatory bail prayer of Arun Kumar Chowdhury, the headmaster of a Murshidabad school who allegedly issued fake age certificates to 39 boys below 18 so that they could enlist themselves on voter lists. 

 The head of Goraimari School of Domkol, 230 km from the city, apprehended arrest after the subdivisional officer lodged an FIR against him. The states lawyer today said: Such a crime is unpardonable.

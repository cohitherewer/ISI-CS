 Mamata has missed mahajot bus: Biman

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Biman Bose: Too late

 Calcutta, April 26: CPM 

 state secretary Biman Bose today said the Trinamul Congresss 

 call for an unofficial mahajot might have worked 

 had it come before the election dates were announced.

 Boses comment comes a day after Trinamul chief Mamata Banerjee announced that there had been an unofficial alliance at the grassroots level in 80 per cent of the 111 Assembly seats that went to polls on April 17 and 22.

 According to Bose, his party had often spoken about the Oppositions efforts to build an anti-Left platform.

 We were aware of this mahajot or mahaghont (grand scam). Such an alliance might have had some impact had it been forged before the poll dates were announced, Bose said.

 However, he refused to attach any importance to the Trinamul chiefs claim yesterday. She might have tried to enthuse her supporters by sending the message that the mahajot formula had been successful in the first two phases of polling and that such a thing was necessary in the coming three phases. But her call at yesterdays press meet would not make much of a difference, the CPM state secretary said.

 Wary of an alliance at the grassroots level, the CPM leadership had asked its district units to make all efforts to secure 50 per cent of the total votes polled. 

 Bose, however, refused to give a figure for the seats in which he thought an unofficial Opposition tie-up had come to play. 

 I cannot say that before studying the details. This can be done only after the polls are over, the Left Front chairman said.

 State Congress president Pranab Mukherjee, however, ruled out any electoral alliance ? official or unofficial ? with Mamatas party at any level. I am saying it with full responsibility that there is no electoral understanding with Trinamul Congress. The Trinamul netri (leader) is spreading false propaganda, he said.

 Mukherjee was addressing an election rally at Suti in Murshidabad, about 260 km from Calcutta. Murshidabad, Birbhum and Burdwan will go to polls on May 3.

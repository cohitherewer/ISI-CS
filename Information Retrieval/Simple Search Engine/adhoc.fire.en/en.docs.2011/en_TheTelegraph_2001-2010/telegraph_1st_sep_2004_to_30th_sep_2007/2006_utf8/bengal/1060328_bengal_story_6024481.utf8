 On way out, but still firing

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Kamal Guha: Angry again

 Calcutta, March 27: On what he said was his last day in office, agriculture minister Kamal Guha again lashed out at the government ? this time for its inability to tackle separatists in north Bengal. 

 Guha, a Forward Bloc leader, has left his Dinhata seat to son Udayan this time and would leave the city tomorrow to steer his campaign.

 The man who had earlier slammed changes in the gov-ernments agriculture policy, today said: Those behind the Greater Cooch Behar movement have called for an election boycott. After realising that people wont follow their diktat, theyve now threatened to gherao the district magistrates and superintendents of police. Why is the administration mum about this threat?

 The administration is doing nothing to allay the fear among people that the polls wont be peaceful. Some confidence-building measures are urgently required.

 Although part of the Left Front ministry for nearly 17 years, he had also accused the CPM of having links with unholy forces while referring to the north Bengal extremists.

 Asked if he wanted his son to be anointed minister in the next government, Guha said: Of course. Who wouldnt?

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Politics to stay on campus

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Aug. 14: Campus violence may have led to Soumik Basus death, but that is not going to put an end to student politics.

 The SFI and its rivals, including Chhatra Parishad and the Trinamul Chhatra Parishad, have made it clear that they would oppose any move to curb political polarisation in students union elections.

 According to the student leaders, the SFI controls unions in around 260 colleges in the state while 70 colleges are run by others.

 Soumiks death on Saturday swivelled the spotlight on the increasing incidents of violence on campus, which has claimed many young lives.

 The student of Bengal Engineering and Science University in Shibpur had fallen off the second floor of a hostel during a clash between the SFI and the Independent Consolidation (IC). Soumik died in hospital later.

 Both organisations expressed regret over the unfortunate death, but said such accidents could not be a reason for students organisations to take an apolitical turn. A students union is a democratic forum for ideological and political contests, they said.

 This was also their argument when the J.M. Lyngdoh Commission had asked whether unions should be chosen on the basis of students consensus instead of elections.

 The panel, led by the former chief election commission, was formed by the government on January 20 this year following a Supreme Court directive. Its task was to investigate election malpractice and campus violence and recommend reforms.

 The committee has submitted its preliminary report to the ministry, but its details are not known.

 This idea of apolitical campus life is the product of globalisation, said Apurba Chatterjee, the state secretary of the SFI, the students wing of the CPM.

 The Congress students arm, Chhatra Parishad, too, dismissed the Lyngdoh panels suggestion of consensus. The Lyngdoh committee asked us about it. Stopping elections to avoid violence will only compromise students democratic rights. So all students organisations want polls, said Subhankar Sarkar, a former president of CP.

 The Trinamul Chhatra Parisad said the Election Commission should intervene and save democracy from CPMs tyranny on campus. For 30 years, SFI hardly allowed rivals to field candidates in college and university polls, its president Baiswanar Chatterjee said.

 SFI leaders held the rival IC responsible for Soumiks death and said they have always been at the receiving end of campus violence triggered by anti-Left Front student bodies.

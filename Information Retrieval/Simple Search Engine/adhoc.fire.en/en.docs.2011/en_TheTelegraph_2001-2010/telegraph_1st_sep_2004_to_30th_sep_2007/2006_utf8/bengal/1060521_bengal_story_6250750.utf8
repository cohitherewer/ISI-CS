 Calcutta, May 20: A traffic constable dived in front of a speeding car to save a nine-year-old boy from being crushed this morning. 

 The car ran over the constable?s left leg but spared the boy.

 Konkon Khan of East Traffic Guard was helping Ranjit Kumar Singh cross Sarat Bose Road near Padmapukur tank on his way to school at 10.45 am when the car jumped lights and came speeding from behind. 

 ?I could see in a flash that it would hit the boy. I just jumped on him,? Khan said from his hospital bed. 

 ?I had changed the signal to ensure there was no movement on the road.?

 Pedestrians who witnessed the act of courage ? a rare sight in the city these days ? took Ranjit, a student of Adarsh Hindi High School, to Sambhu Nath Pandit Hospital while Khan was admitted to Calcutta Police Hospital.

 The boy was released after three stitches on his eyebrow. An X-ray was done on the constable?s bruised left leg.

 Ranjit?s father, who works at the Laxmi Narayan temple on Sarat Bose Road as a cook, could not stop thanking his son?s saviour. ?They have been saying it was my son?s luck that saved him. But I would say it was the constable who came between my son and death?. I am not an important person but I will surely pray for him,? he said.

 At a distance, Ranjit ? his mother died a few years ago ? sat with Balbir Kaur, a neighbour about 65 years old. 

 ?Ranjit has always been scared of crossing the road. As today was the last day in school before the summer vacation, I told him you needn?t worry for sometime now. If it was not for that man, God knows what would have happened,? Balbir said, nursing the boy?s stitches.

 Khan was unfazed about the shower of praise. ?It?s my duty,? he said.

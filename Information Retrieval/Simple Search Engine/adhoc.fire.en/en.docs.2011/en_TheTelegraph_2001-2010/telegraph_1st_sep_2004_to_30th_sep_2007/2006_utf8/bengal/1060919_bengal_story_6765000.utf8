college graduate captures idol market

 Siliguri, Sept. 18: A young art college graduate is giving idol makers in Jalpaiguri a run for their money with his touch of contemporary styling and presentation inspired by the great masters of Bengal.

 Such is the rush to get Monojit Dass signature on an idol, that traditional artisans, who had a monopoly on the business till the other day, have had to slash prices.

 A graduate from Government Art College in Calcutta, Monojit, originally a resident of Nadias Krishnagar, migrated to north Bengal for work. Competition, he thought, would kill him in his hometown, a hub of clay-modellers.

 Now Monojit is doing just that to many others. He has been making Durga and Kali idols on the outskirts of Jalpaiguri town over the past couple of years. This year, I have received 24 orders, said Monojit, in his thirties, as he gave finishing touches to one of the idols at his Paharpur More studio. 

 Apart from some of the leading puja committees of Jalpaiguri, those from Mainaguri, Falakata and even Siliguri have placed their orders with me.

 While Monojits idols cost between Rs 18,000 and Rs 35,000, those made by local artisans are selling for around Rs 15,000 this year.

 Monojitss clients do not mind shelling out more. His way of thinking is more contemporary than most other artisans who, over the decades, have continued to work in the same vein, a puja committee member said. 

 Although on a minuscule scale compared with Calcutta, themes are a rage here as well. The goddess has to gel with the theme of the dcor. Monojits ability to work on themes suggested by puja organisers is exceptional, said one of his clients.

 One of his idols this year is made with nylon cords of different colours. Another is inspired by the paintings of Jamini Roy. In yet another piece, Durga and her children are all placed in a single rectangular frame.

 These days, there is a lot of competition in the industry. Thus, a regular revision of designs has become imperative, said Monojit.

 Earlier, he could manage with a couple of assistants. This year, Monojit has had to hire half a dozen more. I have eight assistants now. All of them are from my place, Krishnagar, he said. 

 Nitai Pal, the secretary of the Jalpaiguri Mritshilpi Samiti, said Monojits pop-ularity had nothing to do with the price cut from around Rs 20,000 last year. It is more to do with the market trend, he said. Now organisers tend to spend more on the pandal and other paraphernalia than the idol itself. 

 The demand for orthodox idols remains steady despite the emergence of new concepts, he added.

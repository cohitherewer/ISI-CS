 Calcutta, July 12: Faced with a space crunch, the CPM has decided to shift its headquarters from 31 Alimuddin Street to a new address ? 74 A, A.J.C. Bose Road.

 Alimuddin Street has been the ruling partys home for more than two decades ? on July 12, 1981, the late Promode Dasgupta, then CPM state secretary, had unveiled the four-storey building. Then chief minister Jyoti Basu and his other cabinet colleagues were present.

 Since then, the building, named after one of the party founders, Muzaffar Ahmed ? endearingly called Kaka babu ? has been the partys power centre.

 The building earlier housed the office of the CPM mouthpiece Ganashakti, too, before the daily was shifted to another address on A.J.C. Bose Road in 1997.

 But we have been facing tremendous space problems to carry out our day-to-day jobs. Bigger space is the need of the hour to keep pace with our enormous party activities, Basu said. 

 According to him, the new building, which is on the main road, can be reached without much hassle.

 CPM state secretariat member Benoy Konar said a 15-cottah plot has been acquired by the Promode Dasgupta Trust, assigned to oversee the construction of the new headquarters. The building is expected to come up by the end of next year. 

 The trust... had embarked on the job under the aegis of the late comrade Anil (Biswas) when he was alive. But now we will have to carry it forward to complete his unfinished work, Konar said.

 He added that the headquarters would have enough rooms to accommodate party leaders coming from far-flung districts. Our leaders from the districts find it difficult to stay here overnight due to lack of accommodation. We shall be able to easily address the problem once the new building comes up.

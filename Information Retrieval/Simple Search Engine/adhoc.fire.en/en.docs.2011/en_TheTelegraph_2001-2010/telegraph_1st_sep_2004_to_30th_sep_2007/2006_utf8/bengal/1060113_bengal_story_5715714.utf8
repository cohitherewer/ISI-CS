 Police scan for varsity teaching jobs

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Santiniketan, Jan. 12: Seeking a job in teaching and non-teaching posts in Visva-Bharati University might just get tougher.

 The Visva-Bharati authorities are planning to introduce police verification of every prospective employee before appointment after it recently found that an assistant lecturer, Mukti Deb, had got a job producing fake documents.

 The move is being initiated as part of the universitys drive to make the recruitment system foolproof in the wake of the scandal.

 Police verification of the whereabouts of aspiring candidates has become necessary after recent controversies like the theft of Tagores Nobel medal in 2003 and the Mukti Deb incident. We are hopeful that such incidents can be prevented with the new measures we are planning to adopt. The police verification is one of them, said vice-chancellor Sujit Basu.

 Registrar Sunil Kumar Sarkar said: The university has set up a committee headed by K.B. Pawar, a member of our institutions executive council, to oversee revision of the recruitment rules.

 Two other incidents had also put the university in an embarrassing position. A senior non-teaching employee was arrested during the investigation of the Nobel medal theft. Another employee was arrested in connection with the felling and theft of a sandalwood tree on the campus.

 Police sources said investigation into the Nobel medal theft had revealed that several persons working as casual workers at that time had criminal records. We were shocked by these revelations. There is enough ground to introduce police verification of employees, a police official said.

 The university has a strength of nearly 1,850, out of which about 1,250 are non-teaching employees.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Partha is Trinamul leader in House

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, May 21: Mamata Banerjee today chose Behala West MLA Partha Chatterjee as leader of the Trinamul Congress legislature party over the protests of senior leader Shobhandeb Chattopadhyay.

 Trinamul, which initially bagged 29 seats in the 294-member House, qualified for the status of principal Opposition party for a short period by increasing its tally to 30 with Arjun Singhs victory in the May 16 Bhatpara by-election. But its score slipped back to 29 yesterday when Bongaon MLA Bhupen Seth died after a heart attack.

 Although the party is one short of the required number, Chatterjee is likely to get the post of leader of the Opposition, with Speaker Hashim Abdul Halim taking a lenient view of the matter.

 Let Trinamul Congress first inform me about the leader of its legislature party, then we shall consider the matter, Halim said tonight.

 If he is made leader of the Opposition, Chatterjee will enjoy the rank of a cabinet minister.

 Chattopadhyay, the Rashbehari MLA and Trinamuls chief whip in the previous Assembly, registered his protest when party president Subrata Bakshi proposed Chatterjees name at a meeting at Mamatas home this afternoon.

 Chattopadhyay later said he was unhappy over the decision. I have been associated with Trinamul since its birth in 1998. The treatment meted out to me is humiliating and I conveyed my feelings to Mamata.

 Those present at the meeting said Chattopadhyay, upset at Chatterjees appointment, declined to continue as the chief whip.

 How is it possible for me to work under Chatterjee, who is junior to me in politics? Chattopadhyay was learnt to have asked.

 Bakshi has named Ashok Deb, the Trinamul MLA from Budge Budge, for the post of chief whip.

 Tarak Banerjee, the MLA from Cossipore, has been appointed deputy leader of the legislature party and Gaighata MLA Jyotipriya Mullick its secretary.

 Chattopadhyay can be offered the less important post of chairman of the public accounts committee, an elected body that looks after the governments expenses.

 Asked if he would accept this post, Chattopadhyay said no.

 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, March 8: Two NGOs turned up at Fort William this afternoon to rescue the same pack of dogs that had strayed into the premises, resulting in a clash.

 Police said members of the NGO that landed late staked claim to the animals but army officers shooed them away. These members lodged a complaint at Maidan police station alleging that they were holed up in a room for over an hour and beaten up. The other NGO, too, lodged a complaint. But the police have left it to the army brass to settle the dispute.

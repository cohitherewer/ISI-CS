 Japan to fund waste schemes

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, May 25: Urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya today said the government will take a soft loan of Rs 163 crore from Japan Bank of International Corporation to get solid waste management projects rolling in the state.

 Disposal of solid wastes is a big problem?. We have plans to start this programme as soon as possible. We had signed an agreement with Japan Bank of International Corporation before the elections and they have agreed to grant us a loan, Bhattacharya said at Writers Buildings. 

 The first project will cover six municipalities in Hooghly district ? Champdani, Baidyabati, Rishra, Serampore, Konnagar and Uttarpara. 

 The government will ask the municipalities to speed up work, conceive new developmental plans, start a single-accounting system and restructure self-help groups and community development. 

 The minister said an urban poverty eradication cell will be formed under the supervision of an expert. The benefits of such programmes often do not reach the grassroots level. We will form a cell to look after such issues so that the poor people are benefited, Bhattacharya said.

 He added that the government is also thinking of introducing property tax on the lines of Delhi, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. The tax will depend on the area and the economic condition of residents.

 Right now, it is at a primary stage. Talks are on. We hope to place a bill at the end of the year, Bhattacharya said.

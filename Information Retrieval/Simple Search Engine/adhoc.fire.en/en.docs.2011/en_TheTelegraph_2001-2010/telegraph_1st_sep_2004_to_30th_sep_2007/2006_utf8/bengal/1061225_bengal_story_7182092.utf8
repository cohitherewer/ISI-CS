The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 After a Gandhi, hint at violence

 - Singur youths in race to enter car plant, Mamata wages war

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Dec. 24: After 21 days of fasting failed to fetch what she wanted on Singur, Mamata Banerjee today issued the veiled threat of a violent agitation. 

 Gandhiji was on fast for a maximum 21 days and the British began talks from the second day. But in independent India, there is no respect for democratic values. Our commitment to non-violence and peace has remained unrecognised, she said today.

 From now on, Trinamuls shows of protest against land acquisition would be unannounced, Mamata added.

 Those of us on fast would not decide the course of action any more. The Krishi Jomi Banchao Committee will take the decisions, she said, indicating that she should not be held responsible if the agitation turned violent. 

 Mamata later said she had chest pain and might collapse any moment.

 The Centre and the chief minister would be responsible for the disaster (reference to her health). Everybody will enjoy Christmas tomorrow, but I will be left on the street. I am also a human being. I too have emotions, she added. 

 As the chief minister refused to accept her demand to not acquire the land of farmers who had not given it willingly, Mamata trained her guns on the Manmohan Singh government for abandoning her. 

 The mood around the fasting venue had been tense since morning, when it became clear the Prime Minister would not interfere on Singur.

 His emissary, Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, was greeted by hostile Trinamul supporters in the evening. As he came down from the dais after speaking to Mamata, who turned down the Prime Ministers request to end the fast, a Trinamul mob chased his car. 

 Police had to throw a security cordon around Das Munshi to give him safe passage. 

 Addressing her supporters after Das Munshi left, she did not conceal her anger and frustration over Singhs refusal to intervene. 

 She had written to Singh yesterday demanding the abolition of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, that empowered the government to acquire private land in public interest. But she rejected some of her colleagues suggestion to seek an appointment with Singh.

 I told Priyada to tell the Prime Minister that if his concern for me is genuine, he should ask the chief minister to agree to return land to farmers who had not given consent.... I am not on fast for 21 days to go back home empty-handed, Mamata said.

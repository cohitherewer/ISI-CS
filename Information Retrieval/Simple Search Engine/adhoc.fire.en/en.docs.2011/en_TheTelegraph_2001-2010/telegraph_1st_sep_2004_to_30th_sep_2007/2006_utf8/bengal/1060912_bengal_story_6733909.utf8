 Krishnagar, Sept. 11: A 17-year-old boy who went to his girlfriends house in a Nadia village last evening was beaten to death by her neighbours, allegedly jealous of the outsider who had won over their pretty woman.

 Buddhadeb Mondal was branded a thief before being lynched at Gopalpur in Tehatta, some 200 km from Calcutta. 

 The Class XI student, son of a well-to-do farmer living in neighbouring Natna, had developed a relationship with the girl of the same age over the past two years, apparently with the consent of both their parents. 

 Last evening, Buddhadeb went to meet the girl in the presence of her parents. But the villagers wanted to play moral police, said an officer of the Tehatta police station. Both families knew that they intended to get married. But a section of villagers had objected to the relationship all along. 

 They could not digest the fact that a local girl was going around with a boy from a neighbouring village. It is possible that some of them had a crush on her, he added.

 When Buddhadeb came out of the girls house around 9 last night, he was surrounded by around 20 villagers led by Sukumar Biswas and Ganesh Mondal. 

 He was dragged to Suku- mars house and slapped and punched and asked to give a written undertaking that he would never enter Gopalpur again. Buddhadeb refused to give the undertaking and tried to escape, running out of the house. The gang chased him, raising an alarm and calling him a thief. Some 200 people pounced on the boy after that, the police officer said.

 When he started vomiting blood, the mob asked him to admit that he came there to steal. The boy could barely speak. But he managed to whisper that he loved the girl, said Sagarika Haldar, a member of the Tehatta panchayat samiti.

 Buddhadeb died in a Tehatta hospital, half an hour after admission. When the police went back to Gopalpur for a probe, almost all villagers said that Buddhadeb was a thief. 

 But the girl came forward to tell the police that he was innocent. Her father, also an aff-luent farmer, said Buddhadeb had come to his house and left at nine.

 Sukumar and Ganesh have been arrested. Nadia superintendent of police Ajay Nand said he was convinced about Buddhadebs innocence. We have got the two and are looking for the rest, he added.

 Mother chops off little boys head

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Feb. 9: Jamuna Biswas has not had a good nights sleep since her eldest son went missing seven months ago. This morning, as she went about her daily chores, the mother of four found her six-year-olds continuous nagging too much to bear.

 The 35-year-old wife of a rickshawpuller chopped off son Ronis head with a ramda (machete) as he pestered her for breakfast. 

 Police said Jamuna was numb with shock when officers landed at her house at Panditpur village in Nadias Hanskhali area, 70 km from Calcutta, to arrest her.

 Around 8 am today, Roni came up to his mother and asked her to give him muri and tea. But Jamuna told him to wait for his father and brothers to come home. 

 Dulal had taken out his rickshaw, while four-year-old Bablu had gone out with Raju, 12, to watch Muharram processions. Jamuna told him that she was expecting his father to bring home some food.

 But the little boy would not listen to her and started throwing tantrums. Jamuna then went to the kitchen and lit up the stove to prepare something for Roni, said an officer of Hanskhali police station. 

 She, however, did not say anything to her son. 

 Roni thought his mother was ignoring him and continued to badger her. Then he told his mother that he was going to his uncles house next door to ask for food, a police officer said.

 His uncle Swapan, a trader, is better off than Dulal, who earns about Rs 50 to Rs 60 a day. Swapans wife Sumitra, who tutors children at home,was busy with her students and turned Roni away. 

 When the boy returned home and told his mother that his kakima had refused to give him food, Jamuna felt extremely humiliated. In a fit of rage, she picked up the machete lying on a table and hit Roni. 

 The weapon caught the boy in the throat, tearing off his head from his body.

 Roni let out a shriek as he slumped to the ground, alerting Sumitra, who came rushing and fainted at the sight. 

 Jamuna was dumbstruck and could not stop trembling as she saw her son in the throes of death, said R. Rajshekharan, the district superintendent of police.

 Dulal and his sons reached home a little later and the police arrived soon after.

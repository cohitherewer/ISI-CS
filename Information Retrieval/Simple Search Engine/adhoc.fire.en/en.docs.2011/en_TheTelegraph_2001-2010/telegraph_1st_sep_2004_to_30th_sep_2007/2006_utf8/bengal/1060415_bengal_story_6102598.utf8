The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 BRIEFS

 Durgapur: The EC eye on mammoth rallies, government bar on decibels and party gag on leaders shooting from their mouth has forced the CPM to find a new trick to capture votes ? make the Opposition vanish. 

 A group of seven magicians are doing that in Burdwan, show after show er... rally after rally. One of the magicians, dressed as a CPM candidate, chants Bud- dhadeb Bhattacharjees development mantra and another, branded the Opposition, vanishes amid applause. Wait till May 11 to know if the magic really worked.

 Suri: Sailen Mahato, the Trinamul 

 candid-ate from Dubrajpur, stopped his car at the edge of 

 a village in Ilambazar and walked across paddy fields. At 

 the end of the trek to Kayra village, he saw a row of youths 

 with folded hands. Dont waste your time. There 

 arent any Trinamul supporters here, said one. 

 Mahato stared at them and suddenly realised that his intelligence 

 network had failed him. The village, 225 km from Calcutta, 

 is a Forward Bloc stronghold. Ma- hato thanked the youths 

 and started on his return journey.

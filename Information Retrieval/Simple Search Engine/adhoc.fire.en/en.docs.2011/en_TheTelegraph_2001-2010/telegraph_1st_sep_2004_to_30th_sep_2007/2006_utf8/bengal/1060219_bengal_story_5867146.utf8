The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Graffiti bar on all buildings

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Feb. 18: The poll panel wants the government to extend across Bengal the bar in the city on defacing buildings and stop the practice of letting owners decide if political parties should be allowed to use their walls.

 According to the West Bengal Prevention of Deface- ment of Property Act, 1976, no building, public or private, can be defaced in Calcutta, but the law is silent on properties in the districts. 

 The Election Commission wants the law banning graffiti/hoarding and posters enforced across Bengal.

 Despite the law being in place in the city, the administration had so long allowed the defacing of private buildings if their owners gave the nod. The commission wants this to stop, too.

 I received a letter from the EC (Election Commission) on this score today and I will see to it that the government implements the provisions of the act, chief electoral officer Debasish Sen said tonight. 

 If the government wants to implement the law across the state, it will have to make a gazette notification saying private property in the districts will also not be allowed to be defaced. 

 The provisions of the act are stringent to the extent that a house owner will not be permitted to put up anything outside his/her house for public viewing save his/her name and address. 

 Violation of the law can lead to a fine of Rs 1,000 or imprisonment for up to six months.

 Pointed out that political parties have already defaced walls in Calcutta, Sen said: If somebody files a complaint, police will have to initiate action as it is a cognisable offence. This is a state government act and, therefore, the government will take the necessary steps to bring the offenders to book. If I am informed about such offences, action will be taken in accordance with the law.

 Sen is leaving for Delhi tomorrow to attend a meeting convened by the poll panel to discuss the law and order situation in Bengal and the number of non-bailable warrants awaiting execution.

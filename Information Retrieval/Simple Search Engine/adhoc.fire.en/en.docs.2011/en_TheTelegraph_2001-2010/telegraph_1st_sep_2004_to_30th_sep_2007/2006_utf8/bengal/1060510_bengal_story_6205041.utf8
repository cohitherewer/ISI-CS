The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Scanner on postal ballots

 DEBASISH CHATTOPADHYAY

 Calcutta, 

 May 9: The Election Commission has for the first 

 time cautioned the state government against malpractice 

 in handling postal ballots.

 In a recent circular issued to home secretary Prasad Ranjan Roy, director-general of police S.C. Avasthy and police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee, the poll panel said it had received complaints that certain individuals exercise undue influence or do not permit maintenance of secrecy.

 The Congress-dominated State Government Employees Federation and the Confederation of State Government Employees had recently submitted a memorandum to chief election commissioner B.B. Tandon and his deputy R. Balakrishnan, alleging that the exercise was not fair.

 It is a serious election offence as it violates the act concerning maintenance of secrecy in voting and the offender may face imprisonment of three months or fine or both, an official said. 

 The Election Commission also told the government that certain individuals are guilty of receiving bunches of postal ballots on behalf of their colleagues from postmen. This is not permitted at all, an official said, adding that the postmaster general of Bengal has been alerted as well.

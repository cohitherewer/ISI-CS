 Housewives desperate, but for hot stocks

 The man touted as the countrys very own Warren Buffet spent Saturday afternoon with women, who he said were like stock markets, mysterious and commanding. 

 Rakesh Jhunjhunwala should know. By his own admission, 105 per cent of his wealth is in the form of investments. 

 At the Ocio club on Belvedere Road, he was addressing ladies in their designer best, who for once were more interested in Dow Jones than diamonds.

 All members of Millennium Mams a forum for learning about finance and investment opportunities targeted at housewives had turned up to learn how to make independent, analysed and informed financial decisions.

 You ladies are different from my wife. Youve come to learn the process. My wife is not interested in the process, only the proceeds, smiled the man from Mumbai.

 The session with the big bull covered everything, from evolution of capital markets and investment approach to the key to the Indian stock market and buy-and-sell commandments. 

 Stressing investment over trading, Jhunjhunwala borrowed a Buffet quote: In the short run, its like a voting machine. In the long run, it is like a weighing machine.

 Given that the value of his and his familys equity holding is pegged at Rs 1,735 crore, his crash course for the women armed with pen and paper was weighty and witty. If the girl is pretty, the suitor will come, he said to a wholl buy, wholl sell question. Make a mistake you can afford, so that you can live to make another one, he replied when queried about risk-taking. 

 Keep in mind Warren Buffets two-point guideline (one: capital should be safe; two: always remember point one!).

 When the floor was thrown open to the Mams, questions on special tips and hot sectors poured in. Steering clear of naming stocks, Jhunjhunwala stuck to his mantra: Sell when EPS (earning per share) or its expectation peaks or when the PER (price-earning ratio) is unsustainable.

 The conclusive two-fold advice to the ladies from the man who invests first and investigates later: decide what percentage of your (or your husbands) wealth you would like to allocate and then find the right person to manage the task.

 With Indias projected household savings for 2010 pegged at $400 billion and women starting to call the shots, the times right for millennium maams to man the market.

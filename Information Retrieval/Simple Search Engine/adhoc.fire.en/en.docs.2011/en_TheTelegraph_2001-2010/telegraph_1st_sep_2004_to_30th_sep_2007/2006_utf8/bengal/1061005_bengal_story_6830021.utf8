The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 After arrest, Bangla scare

 IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI

 Calcutta, Oct. 4: A team 

 of the special branch, Calcutta polices intelligence 

 wing, left for Mumbai on Monday to question Mohammed Majid 

 Ansari, who was arrested by an anti-terrorist squad from 

 Rajabazar last week in connection with the 7/11 blasts. 

 He was born and brought up in Calcutta and we have to investigate how he got involved in these activities. Our purpose is to find out whether he had other links in the city, police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee said.

 A special branch officer said many Bangladeshis come to the city every month and stay in Rajabazar and adjoining areas. After a couple of visits, they befriend unemployed youths. Lured by the promise of a fast buck and unaware of their new acquaintances background, they venture into Bangladesh illegally and slowly get involved in various other activities.

 Many young men from the Rajabazar area, a sleuth said, frequent Bangladesh to bring back readymade garments such as jeans and T-shirts, which sell in city marts.

 Readymade dresses are much cheaper there. We stay for a week and return with a consignment, said Mohammed Akbar, in his early 30s. He has fixed clients in New Market and Fancy Market.

 Majid was named as an associate of militants who planted bombs that killed nearly 200 people in seven serial blasts on Mumbais suburban trains. 

 Since Majids arrest, the Rajabazar residents are a scared lot. My two sons, who used to work in a New Market shop, met three Bangladeshis last year. The duo said they could make a lot more by fetching garments from there. My sons now go to Bangladesh twice a month and supply clothes to shops in the city, said Abdul Kalim.

 My sons are scared, too. I have asked them not to go to that country again, he said. 

 Admitting intelligence failure on their part, an officer said several criminals had taken shelter in the area over the past few years. Majid stayed barely 200 meters from the Narkeldanga police station but we were clueless. 

 Majids family is still claiming that he is innocent. He has no police records. My brother was lured into a trap, said his elder brother, Mohammed Shahid Ansari.

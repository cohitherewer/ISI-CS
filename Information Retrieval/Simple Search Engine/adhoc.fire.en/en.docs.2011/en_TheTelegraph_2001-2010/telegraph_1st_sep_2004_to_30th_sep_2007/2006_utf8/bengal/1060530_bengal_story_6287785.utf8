 Loneliness drives teen mother to death

 RABI BANERJEE

 Krishnagar, May 29: A 16-year-old killed herself at a Nadia village last night, apparently out of the fear of loneliness, after her husband said he planned to return to the Gulf in search of work.

 Arifas suicide comes two years after her elder sister Jhunu killed herself for the same reason.

 Arifa had been forced to quit her studies and marry Jhunus husband when she was only 14 because someone had to look after the children, one of them aged two and the other only two months.

 The teenager herself delivered a baby eight months ago, the third child of Safikul Mondal, who used to be a waiter in Dubai till he returned six months ago. 

 Last night, she drank pesticide at her in-laws house in Nadias Chapra, about 130 km from Calcutta, hours after Safikul announced his decision. During his stay in Chapra, he had been looking for work closer home to be able to spend more time with his wife. But he gave up in the face of taunts from relatives.

 In Dubai, Safikul was paid Rs 10,000 to Rs 12,000 a month, much more than what the other residents of Itabere village can hope to earn.

 His elder brother Shahidul is a mason in Malaysia. Shahiduls wife and three children stay with her parents in a neighbouring village.

 Safikuls father Abdur and younger brother Chhotu are farmers who till a small plot but live comfortably, thanks to the money from abroad, a Chapra police station officer said. The Mondals have a telephone and a television set at home.

 Arifa was in Class VI when she got married and stopped going to Chapra Secondary School. Days after that, Safikul left for Dubai and she realised she was pregnant. 

 According to the terms of his earlier job, Safikul could not have taken her along. 

 Over the phone she would often plead with him to come back. He relented, quitting his job and returning home for a new life. But a job with similar pay was too much to expect for the Class VIII graduate in rural Bengal. His savings dwindled gradually and parents began to pressure him to go back to the Gulf.

 Dejected, he changed his mind and told Arifa about his revised plan yesterday. 

 Safikul was not at home when Arifa emptied the bottle of pesticide. On his return, around 10 pm, he saw her writhing in pain, surrounded by the children ? Sushan, Salma and her yet-to-be-named son.

 Arifa was rushed to Chapra block hospital, from where she was shifted to the Shaktinagar district hospital in Krishnagar at midnight. She died around 10 am today. 

 Nadia superintendent of police R. Rajsekharan said: According to our preliminary investigation, Arifa committed suicide out of the fear of loneliness. She was also lost as to how to bring up the three little children alone.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Fee scare for party

 - Glare on New Years Eve hot spots flouting licence rule

 SUDESHNA BANERJEE

 Calcutta, Dec. 23: A New Years Eve party minus Beedi? 

 That is a threat looming over several revellers haunts this year. 

 Over 200 hotels, clubs and pubs in Bengal run the risk of being gagged for not having paid the licence fee required for playing music at such special events to The Phonographic Performance Ltd (PPL), which owns the sound recording rights and protects the interests of music producers. 

 The company has obtained an injunction from the North 24-Parganas district judges court that restrains defaulting hotels and pubs from playing sound recordings of the music companies represented by PPL till they pay up. They include almost the entire gamut from Saregama to Venus; Sony to Tips. 

 The order issued on Thursday asks defaulters to explain within a week of receiving the notice why the injunction should not be granted. The fee for special occasions is over and above the annual fee charged for playing music.

 The case is part of a nationwide drive in which PPL has issued notices to over 1,000 party venues in nine cities. They have high cover charges for year-end parties and mint money by playing our music. The mindset is such that people are ready to pay for alcohol but.... We are not even asking for a percentage of their sales, said Sowmya Chowdhury, a PPL sales manager, from Mumbai. 

 The losses that the music industry is suffering because of non-payment of fees by hotels and pubs run into crores. 

 The fee is charged on the basis of the number of people expected to attend the bash and the duration of the party and may range from Rs 15,000 to about Rs 70,000. 

 Among the defaulters, HHI is the only one to have started negotiations. We will definitely pay up, said a hotel official. 

 But others are holding their ground. We have not received a notice, said Astor Hotel. 

 A Peerless Inn official said that a case is being fought in Sealdah court on the validity of the demand. Till the verdict is delivered, we do not have a comment.

 Come December 31, and PPL personnel would be hopping party spots to check if their rights are being flouted. 

 How much fun can a night out be minus the biggest hits of the year? said a young model who has finalised her party plans.

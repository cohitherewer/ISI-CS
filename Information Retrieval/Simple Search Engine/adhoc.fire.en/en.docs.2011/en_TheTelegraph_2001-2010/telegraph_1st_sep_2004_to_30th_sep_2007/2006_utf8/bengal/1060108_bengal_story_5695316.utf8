 SSC result blow to govt plan

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 7: A sharp drop in the success rate in this years School Service Commission examination might force the government to drop its plans of recruiting 17,000 new teachers in state-aided secondary schools. 

 The results of the test were declared today.

 The government will not be able to recruit more than 13,000 teachers in the 12,000-odd secondary schools spread across Bengal. 

 Out of a little more than two lakh examinees, around 24,860 have qualified. 

 According to recruitment rules, the number of candidates called for interviews should at least be double the number of vacancies. This means 34,000 candidates have to be interviewed for filling up this years vacant posts, which totals 17,000.

 Ranajit Basu, the chairman of the commission, said necessary measures are being taken to ensure that as many posts as possible are filled up.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Bengal on IT overdrive

 - In the land of tech titans

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Last minute work to get the stage set for bangalore 

Calcutta, Oct. 28: Unions in the IT industry may have become a thorn for the Left, but the IT department has steered clear of controversy and is selling destination Bengal in Indias tech capital, now hosting Bangalore IT.in 2006. 

 The Bengal team for the conference-cum-exposition includes nine IT infrastructure developers, professors from IIT Kharagpur and a band of officials accompanied by IT minister Debesh Das, a former computer engineering professor himself. 

 Weve always been asked whether Bengal has the infrastructure to accommodate IT companies. Thats why we have brought the developers along, IT secretary Siddharth said, adding that the state will have over 13 million sq ft of office space ready in a year. 

 So, the Bengal pavilion at Palace Gardens is show- casing upcoming projects of Unitech, DLF, Millennium Park and Infinity Parks. 

 Das will spend at least two hours a day at the Advantage Bengal stall one of the biggest in the exhibition arena to talk to potential investors, besides holding one-to-one meetings on the sidelines. 

 A Wipro team met me today and invited me to their campus. I will also meet Infosys officials in the next two-three days, he said. 

 The Bangalore-headquartered tech titans want to set up development centres in Calcutta, but the high price of land has delayed negotiations. Talks are on we have always maintained that we will try our best to offer them the best deal. Ill discuss the issue with the companies, said Das, who will host a lunch for about 30 CEOs tomorrow, Day II of the four-day show. 

 Some 175 companies from about 18 countries and 16 state governments are taking part in the event. Team Bengal is expecting some big names to drop in for tomorrows luncheon, where the minister will make a presentation. The IIT is using its alumni network to ensure the presence of companies like Intel, Texas Instruments, Synopsis, AMD, Sun Microsystems and Wipro. 

 We have IT companies and BPO units. Now we want firms specialising in chip designing and manufacturing. My presentation will focus on our commitment to facilitate the growth of such companies in our state, said Das.

 Malda Cong in pact with BJP

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Malda, Jan. 9: The Congress may have ruled out Mamata Banerjees invitation for an alliance, but the partys Malda leaders have no qualms about a coalition with BJP ally Trinamul Congress to keep the Left parties at bay. 

 For the Assembly elections, the anti-Left coalition here has agreed to be led by the Congress. 

 The decision not to field candidates against each other was taken last night by Congress MP A.B.A. Ghani Khan Chowdhury after a meeting with party leaders.

 The MP had been harping on the need for a grand alliance for the past few weeks. 

 It is not important what the Pradesh Congress is thinking. We will have to be united to oust the Left from Writers Buildings, Ghani Khan apparently said yesterday.

 Gautam Chakrabarty, the Congress chief of the zilla parishad, voiced the same opinion. In Malda, we have always had an alliance ? be it at the civic level or the zilla parishad. What is wrong with the Assembly? he asked. 

 The parishad is controlled by the 17-member Congress-Trinamul-BJP coalition.

 Englishbazar municipality, now controlled by the front ? against which a no-confidence motion was tabled on December 23 ? has 14 members from the Congress-Trinamul-BJP alliance and 11 from the Left parties.

 Five of the 11 Assembly seats in the district are held by the Congress. The CPM has six. Ghani Khan wants the Congress to fight for nine and leave one each for Trinamul and the BJP.

 District Trinamul president Krishnendu Chowdhury said: We had been emphasising the need for the alliance. There will be no problem over seat sharing. As the Congress is very strong here, it is natural that it will want to contest from most seats. 

 The BJPs Biswajit Ghosh said his party was also looking forward to the alliance. He added: But our district leadership will have to decide how many seats our candidates will contest.

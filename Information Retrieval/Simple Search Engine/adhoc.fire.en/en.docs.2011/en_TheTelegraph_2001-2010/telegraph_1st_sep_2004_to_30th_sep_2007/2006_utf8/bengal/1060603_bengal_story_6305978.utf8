The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Bankura scores a perfect three, again

 ABHIJEET CHATTERJEE 

 Bankura, 

 Jun2: Boys from Bankura, one of the most backward districts 

 in Bengal, have again bage ged the top three positions 

 in Madhyamik.

 The 166-year-old Bankura Zilla School, 270 km from Calcutta, has produced all three Bijit Sinha, Aritrya Batabyal and Sovon Shit. 

 Last year, Arindam Santra of Bankuras Sonamukhi Vindubasini School had stood first, scoring 785 out of 800. Ahana Pradhan of Bankura Mis- sion Girls and Rajen Madan of Ramharipur Ramakrishna Mission High School had got 783 and 782.

 It is a record of sorts, said the jubilant zilla school headmaster, Ajit Hazra. Dedication and hard work have made the difference.

 In 2004, Chiranjit De of his school had stood first in the secondary examination. 

 Hazra, who joined the school two years ago, felt the credit should go to the students and their parents for our brilliant performance. 

 Narayan Ganguly, a former student and now a teacher, said: When I was a student, we used to get special coaching and care from our teachers. These days, our primary concern is to complete the syllabus on time. So we can not provide any special guidance to our pupils. The entire credit is theirs.

 Out of the 109 students who took this years Madhy- amik from the zilla school, 99 have secured first division (over 60 per cent). The other 10 have got the second. Seventy-three students scored over 75 per cent.

 On a day like this everyone returned compliments. Sovon, who got 784, said: We could not have done so well without our teachers guidance.

 However, he also admitted that private coaching was a big help. Sovon had seven private tutors more than one for each of the science subjects. 

 Bijit Sinha, the son of an assistant sub-inspector of police who scored three more than Sovon, had eight private tutors. He left for Calcutta with his father to meet the chief minister.

 I am grateful to my parents because they provided me with eight private tutors before the examination. But I have also got support and guidance from my school, Bijit said. 

 Batabyal, who stood second, had nine tutors. My father is an English professor of a Bankura college and has so far not purchased a television as he feels this would affect my studies. I have so far not seen any movie or programmes on television, he added. 

 Sovon, whose father is bio-logy teacher in a secondary school in Bankura, wants to become a software engineer and settle in Bangalore or Mumbai or abroad. 

 Is Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee listening?

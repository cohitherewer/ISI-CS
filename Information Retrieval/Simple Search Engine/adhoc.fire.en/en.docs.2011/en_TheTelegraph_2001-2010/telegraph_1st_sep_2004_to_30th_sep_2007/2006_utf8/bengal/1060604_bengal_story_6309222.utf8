 Doctor arrested in murder case

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Durgapur June 3: A cardiologist, Ramesh Singh, has been arrested in connection with the murder of a sex worker three months ago.

 Singh is attached to two nursing homes in the coal belt of Raniganj, 220 km from Calcutta.

 The cardiologist was summoned for interrogation by Durgapur subdivisional police officer Pranab Kumar yesterday and was taken into custody. 

 He was produced in the additional chief judicial magistrates court and was remanded in police custody for a week.

 Additional superintendent of police Ananda Kumar said the accused, involved in flesh trade, had hired three persons to murder Kumkum Bhattacharya alias Puja.

 Police records said three assailants shot dead Kumkum at her residence in the City Centre locality here around 9 pm on March 7.

 Kumkum knew the trio, who spent some time at her flat before killing her.

 We started a murder case but came to know about Singhs involvement in it after a thorough investigation, said Ananda Kumar.

 Investigation suggested that Singh was associated with a flesh trade racket run by Tania Sarkar, another sex worker, the additional SP added.

 Singh was apparently close to Tania, who was Kumkums rival.

 Police said Singh hired the killers to take revenge on Kumkum, who had threatened him with dire consequences for having links with Tania.

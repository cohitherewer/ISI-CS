The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Work on flyover rolls after 6 years

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 18: After gathering dust for six years, work is set to start on the half-done Kidderpore flyover. 

 The bridge, to be built using the latest technology, will boast of a brand new design.

 Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners (HRBC), the implementing agency of the project, has awarded the contract to Mackintosh Burn Limited, fixing March 31, 2007 as the deadline.

 The Rs 26-crore project also includes repairing Karl Marx Sarani ? from Fancy Market to the flyover ? and a facelift for the Kidderpore intersection.

 The state government adopted the plan for the flyover ? from Garden Reach Circular Road, around Fancy Market, to the approach road to Vidyasagar Setu ? in 1996. The construction was flagged off the next year with a cost estimate of Rs 20 crore. But three years and an expenditure of Rs 4 crore later, only a small portion was built.

 Since then, the project has been untouched, making space for a bunch of shanties and long traffic jams. 

 The transport department said faults in the design and technology had brought work to a stop.

 The half-finished work gave rise to a hue and cry, with fingers being pointed at the efficiency and responsibility of government officers and engineers. With the Opposition parties up in arms, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee intervened and directed the HRBC to resume work as soon as possible.

 A fresh design was prepared with a new estimate of Rs 26 crore. Now, steel structures will be used along with concrete pillars. The main bridge over the Tolly Nullah will be entirely made of steel, while the two approaches will be steel structures on concrete pillars.

 We are happy that the work has been resumed. As of now, there is no hurdle before us and we are determined to meet the deadline. We have made it clear to the contractor, HRBC vice-chairman Sadhan Banerjee said.

 A team of officials and engineers would regularly oversee the progress of the project.

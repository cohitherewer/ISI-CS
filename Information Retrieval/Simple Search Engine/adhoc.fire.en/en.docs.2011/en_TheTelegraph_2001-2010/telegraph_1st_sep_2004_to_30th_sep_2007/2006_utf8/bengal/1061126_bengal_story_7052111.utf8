The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Punch amp; pat for cops, all in a day

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Nov. 25: First the brickbats, then the bouquets.

 The city traffic police got a taste of both today. 

 While hundreds protested against slack policing by the traffic cops after a 25-year-old woman was killed in an accident in the Garden Reach area, another woman from Chingrihata called up the traffic officers and broke down in joy, thanking them for retrieving her lost purse with everything intact.

 The first incident took place around 10 in the morning near the garbage dump off Nature Park in Ramnagar under the Garden Reach police station. Rita Ghosh was trying to cross the Trenching Ground Road skirting the dump-yard when a speeding dumper hit her, police said.

 A resident of Alampur in South 24-Parganas, Ghosh was rushed to a hospital where she succumbed to her injuries. As word spread, residents set up a blockade on Taratala Road to protest against the lack of traffic personnel in the area.

 This is a genuine problem. Since there are not enough traffic guards, most vehicles using the Trenching Ground Road travel at a high speed, posing a threat to pedestrians, said an officer of the South West Traffic Guard.

 As the number of protesters grew, a 500-strong crowd took over Taratala Road, blocking traffic towards Garden Reach. Senior officers of the police and traffic guard turned up after an hour and a half and assured the protesters of prompt action. The police later traced the vehicle and arrested the driver.

 Far away in Chingrihata, around 11.20 am, New Town resident Amita Banerjee was struggling to explain to traffic constables that she had left her purse in the bus in which she was travelling. 

 The 44-year-old had got off the Newtown-Garia state bus at Chingrihata to go to her sisters place in Kankurgachhi. She was going to attend a wedding and was carrying eight bharies of gold in her purse along with the keys of her flat and almirah.

 The woman couldnt recall the number of the bus. She just mentioned the route. We called up contacts in surface transport and identified the official looking after the route. We asked him to check the buses and finally found the conductor, who handed over the purse to Amita, said Dilip Ghosal, additional OC of the Sealdah Traffic Guard.

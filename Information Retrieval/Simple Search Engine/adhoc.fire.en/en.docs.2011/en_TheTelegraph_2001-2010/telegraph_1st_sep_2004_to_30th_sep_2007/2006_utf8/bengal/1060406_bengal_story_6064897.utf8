The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Raid on CPM draws blank

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Midnapore, April 5: Bengal and Punjab police personnel, who are on poll duty, conducted raids on CPM offices and some villages at Keshpur around midnight last night following reports that arms and ammunition had been stored there.

 They returned empty-handed. The police team could not find anything and there were no arrests, West Midnapore superintendent of police Ajay Nand said.

 A senior district official said the raids were carried out after local Trinamul Congress leaders submitted a complaint with the observer for Keshpur Assembly constituency, Manmohan Singh. 

 The party had alleged that the CPM had hidden arms and ammunition in various parts of Keshpur, about 160 km from Calcutta. 

 The raids were carried out following the observers instruction. Four Trinamul activists were taken along as witnesses, the official said.

 The election observer refused to comment. 

 The CPM state leadership reacted strongly to the raids, while district party leaders said they would register their protest with the Election Commission in writing.

 CPM state secretary Biman Bose said the police swoop was unnecessary, one-sided, partial, undemocratic and dictatorial. 

 According to Bose, it was conducted to terrorise Left Front workers.

 The EC should stop displaying such high-handedness. It should also urge its observers to refrain from such activities, he added.

 The raids were conducted on the CPMs Keshpur zonal party office, the Neradeul local committee office and houses of CPM activists at Gopinathbati and Majurhati.

 The local CPM MLA, Nandarani Dal, said: It has once again been proved that Trinamuls allegations are false.

 Keshpur had been the centre of bloody CPM-Trinamul clashes between 1998 and 2001 as both parties fought tooth and nail to retain their control on the area. 

 About 120 people were killed and over 2,500 houses burnt down. Over 10,000 political activists fled their villages.

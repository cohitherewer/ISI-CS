The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Mobile call ends in motorcycle death

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Aug. 27: A mobile phone proved a killer tool yet again as a motorcyclist busy in conversation rammed into an elderly cyclist on a Nadia road last evening. 

 Tutul Dutta, 22, who graduated last year, had received the phone as a gift from his father. He died on the spot, about 100 km from Calcutta. 

 The smashed handset was found in a drainage canal off the state highway in which its owner had landed. 

 The 50-year-old cyclist Tutul hit had a foot amputated today. His friend Milan Haldar, who was riding pillion, is fighting for life in hospital. 

 The secretary of the local puja committee, Tutul went to Mayapur, about 45 km from his house at Majdia, with clubmate Milan to book dhak players. 

 On the way back, the phone rang and Tutul took it out from his shirt pocket, holding onto the motorcycle with his left hand. 

 Realising that a common friend had called, Milan tapped Tutul on his shoulder and asked for the phone after some time. He spoke for a while and Tutul wanted the phone back again. 

 The phone changed hands frequently and the two went on speaking on the phone even as the motorcycle sped along the highway. Tutul was so engrossed talking over the phone that he did not notice the cyc-list in front, Nadia superintendent of police R. Rajsekharan said.

 Tutul hit Jiban Das near Kulgachhi, about 15 km from Majdia.

 Milan was flung on the road about 10 feet away. Both friends were without helmets. 

 Local residents took Milan and Das to Saktinagar Hospital in Krishnagar. They did not spot Tutul lying in the drain. 

 Milan told us that he and Tutul were continuously talking on the phone. At the mention of the phone and Tutul, we realised that there was another victim, who had not been brought to the hospital. We rushed to the spot again and found Tutul. He was dead by that time, a local police officer said. 

 The accident took place around dusk. The officer said it was dark when the search team returned to the accident site. It took us quite some time to find him out, he added. 

 Milan was today moved to a private hospital in Calcutta. Das is still at the Krishnagar hospital, minus a leg.

 Tutuls father Bimal, a rich farmer, blamed himself for his sons death. 

 I had gifted him the mobile phone after he became a graduate last year. I never realised that the phone will lead to such an end, he said.

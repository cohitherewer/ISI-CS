The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Now, a ghost complaint

 DEBASISH CHATTOPADHYAY

 Calcutta, March 5: A couple living in Regent Park for years found their names missing when revised electoral rolls were published last month. 

 Believe it or not, Jayanta Bose and Jhumpas names had been struck off on the basis of a dead mans complaint.

 Bose went to the election office at Survey Building in Alipore to find out why his name and his wifes do not figure on the list. He was told that Sudhir Chandra Ghosh, his next-door neighbour who passed away in August 2003, had lodged a complaint saying no such couple lived there.

 The authorities apparently acted on a fictitious complaint without bothering to conduct their own inquiry.

 We were astonished, said the 52-year-old businessman living on Chandi Ghosh Road ? part of the Tollygunge Assembly constituency. He was born and brought up there. 

 We dont know what to do next, Bose said. 

 Hearing about the couples complaint, chief electoral officer Debasish Sens jaws dropped as well. They should immediately approach the electoral registration officer of south Calcutta. Their names should be included in the voters list, he said. 

 As the word about the deletion of two voters branded ghosts by the election office spread, the late Sudhir Ghoshs son came to know about the charge against his father.

 Goutam Ghosh said: There is no way that my father could have lodged the complaint. He is no more for the last three years. He knows the Boses for long. There must be some foul play behind all this and it must be rectified without delay, he said.

 Prahlad Chakraborty, the local Trinamul Congress councillor of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, too, sniffed politics. He said: Not only should the names be included in the list, a proper probe should be carried out to find out who was responsible for the deletions.

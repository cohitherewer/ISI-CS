 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, Dec. 31: A gang of six raided a sari shop in Burrabazar this afternoon and walked away with Rs 1.5 lakh, gold rings and five mobile phones. 

 Police said the youths stepped into the wholesale shop on Jamna Lal Bajaj Street posing as customers and even saw a collection of saris. After a while, four of them held a dagger against L.N. Toshniwal. When he refused to give them the locker keys, they hit him with the dagger. 

 Calcutta: Nepu Giri, a man in his mid-20s who has about 15 murder charges against him, was held in Howrah on Friday night. The arrest of the man known to chop his victims into pieces and dump them in the Hooghly came after a shootout at an abandoned godown under Golabari police station. His associates, Gautam Aich and Raj Kumar Chaudhury, were also held.

 Calcutta: Two foot-bridges will be built at Golaghata and Sribhumi on VIP road. The 500-m stretch between the two places has seen 19 deaths in two years. The PWD minister laid the found-ation stone for the brid- ges to be built in three months.

 Krishnagar: Papiya Bibi, a housewife, set Ramzan Ali on fire after he tried to molest her on Friday. She was arrested in Nadias Karimpur, about 190 km from Calcutta, after she went to police and said Ali had tried to force himself on her while she was alone and she hit back. He is fighting for life in hospital.

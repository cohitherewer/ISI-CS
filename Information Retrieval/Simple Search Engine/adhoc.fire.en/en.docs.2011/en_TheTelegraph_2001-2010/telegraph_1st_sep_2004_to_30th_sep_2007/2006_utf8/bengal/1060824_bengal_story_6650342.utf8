Calcutta, Aug. 23: First time in the Calcutta Municipal Corporation as chief minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee walked up the stairs on which a red carpet had been rolled out especially for him.

 He climbed a flight of 31 stairs to inaugurate the Rs 100-crore e-governance project of the civic body funded by the UK governments department for international development (DFID).

 Bhattacharjees predecessor, Jyoti Basu, had used the elevator 10 years ago.

 Walking on the woollen carpet, which made the cash-starved CMC poorer by over Rs 2 lakh, Bhattacharjee was not sure whether this was his first visit to the red building on SN Banerjee Road since 1977.

 This teakwood staircase, this corridor and that courtyard with the mango tree seems very familiar. I think I have been here earlier. Is it really that long? Bhattacharjee asked mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya.

 The mayor smiled. You have attended our programmes at Taj Bengal, Jorabagan and Star Theatre but never at this red building.

 The video conference facility that the chief minister opened would enable the civic headquarters keep in touch with its borough offices across the city. 

 While getting overwhelmed by the century-old staircase and the old mango tree, Bhattacharjee, however, could not gloss over the citys civic woes. So, waterlogging, drinking water scarcity, silting of drainage canals and potholed roads came up for discussion.

 The chief minister expressed his displeasure over inordinate delays in assessment and mutation of property by civic officials.

 Salary cut order for pension delay

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, Feb. 27: The government has the liberty to act against employees responsible for delay in disbursing the statutory dues of schoolteachers and their families and deduct the interest to be paid from the employees salary, the high court said today.

 The widow of Sridhar Pal, who died on August 27, 1986, had moved court last month alleging that the education department had paid the family pension due to her ? 19 years after her husbands death ? but not at the revised rate. 

 Under the revised rules, in effect since 1990, schoolteachers are entitled to increased salary and pension benefits. 

 On February 20, 2005, Ganga Bala Pal got her statutory dues following a high court directive to the department, Saptarshi Roy, the advocate for the widow, told the high court.

 He also said the case was an example of mistakes that education department employees frequently make. In over a hundred cases, the state had to pay interest at the rate of 10 per cent a year or more with the arrears of retired schoolteachers or their widows.

 Citing the case of Sridhar Pal, the assistant teacher of Dignagar Hattala Silver Jubilee Institution at Hatkirtinagar in Burdwan, Roy demanded action against those responsible for the harassment of teachers or their families. Sridhar Pals wife had to starve with his children for not getting the money in time. She got the arrears without interest following the high court order. 

 Hearing this submission, Justice J. Biswas asked the authorities concerned to pay a 10 per cent interest to the widow and directed the government to deduct the amount from the employees salary. 

 The state authorities will be at liberty to recover the amount from the people found responsible, the order says.

 In the last six months, the high court had to intervene in at least 20 cases relating to widows of schoolteachers. In all the cases, the government had to pay the dues with at least 10 per cent interest.

 Behrampore, June 26: At the Murshidabad district maternity hospital, Beauty Dey lies in a cot on the first floor, playing with herself.

 The infant, whose mother is in a mental asylum, has no one to take care of her and nowhere to go.

 Clad in a white dress with blue floral patterns, she is fawned over by the doctors and nurses, who take turns to keep an eye on the baby. The nurses at the hospital, about 200 km from Calcutta, had given her the name Beauty because she was fair and pretty.

 But they cant give her a home, not yet.

 It is not possible to shift her to the district child welfare committee, which can hand the baby over to a couple willing to adopt her as this would require an affidavit from Beautys mother Anuradha relinquishing her claim to the child. But she is not in a mental state to give such a declaration.

 The future of Beauty is now entangled in legal complications. We are really helpless, said Raghabesh Majumdar, the superintendent of Behrampore Mental Hospital where Beautys mother is undergoing treatment.

 Beauty was in her mothers womb when Anuradha was spotted one morning in August last year at the market place in Sagardighi, screaming and hurling stones at shops. She was arrested after some shopkeepers lodged complaints.

 When we arrested her, she was speaking incoherently and was unable to give her name or address. We arrested her and produced her in the chief judicial magistrates court in Jangipur from where she was sent to the district mental asylum, said a police officer at Sagardighi police station.

 A medical check-up at the asylum revealed that Anuradha, 27, was pregnant. As her treatment began, she revealed her name, that she had two more children and her home was in Khulna, Bangladesh. 

 But soon after, her condition deteriorated and Anuradha sank into silence.

 The asylum authorities tried to trace her family in Khulna and wrote to the address Anuradha had given them. But there was no response. 

 Beauty was born at the district maternity hospital.

 Majumdar said the child cannot live with the mother as she is a mental patient. At the maternity hospital, superintendent Indranath Chatterjee, too, says he is helpless.

 There is no law by which we can keep the child. Generally, in cases where a child in unclaimed or abandoned by its mother, we send it to the child welfare committee of the government. But neither the mental asylum nor the child welfare committee is taking responsibility of the child. What can we do? he asked.

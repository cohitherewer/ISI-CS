 Calcutta, July 11: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today pledged academic autonomy to science and technology institutions and said his government would not allow their ?bureaucratisation?.

 Laying the foundation stone of the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) here this afternoon, Singh said: ?We will de-bureaucratise science and technology institutions and ensure their academic autonomy.?

 The promise comes when Union health minister Anbumani Ramadoss is engaged in a public spat with AIIMS director P. Venugopal over the reins of the country?s premier medical institute. The minister had sacked Venugopal, but the order was stayed by Delhi High Court. On resuming office, Venugopal sacked the institute?s registrar, who was known to be close to the minister. 

 Singh said: ?We will create exciting career opportunities for scientists so that we can retain our talent at home?. Our government is committed both to excellence and to widening of access to education, especially higher education and research.? 

 The Bengal government has earmarked 220 acres in Haringhata, 40 km from Calcutta, for the IISER, being set up by the Union ministry of human resource development. 

 Classes, however, will be held at IIT Kharagpur?s Salt Lake premises and the National Institute of Technical Teachers? Training and Research from August.

 Only 70 students would be enrolled in the beginning, but the number will go up to 200 with the introduction of new disciplines. Candidates will have to qualify through the joint entrance examination.

 Universities, Singh said, have to encourage research. ?I believe that where there is good science, good applications follow. Therefore, it is meaningless to debate what our priority should be, basic or applied science. I think both.?

 ?Countries like China and South Korea,? Singh said, ?are far ahead of us in investing in this field.? 

 An Indian Science Academy survey found that less than 3 per cent of students in India wanted to pursue a career in science. ?We have to improve the quality of teaching and increase the enrolment of students in science and mathematics at the school level,? Singh said. The state governments, he felt, should take steps to revitalise the university system.

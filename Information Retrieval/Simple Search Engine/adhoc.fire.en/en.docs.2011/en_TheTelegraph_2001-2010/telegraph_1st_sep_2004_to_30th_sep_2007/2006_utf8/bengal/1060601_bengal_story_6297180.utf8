The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Death trap for elephants

 - Railway 

accused of flouting forest norms 

 SEBANTI SARKAR

 Calcutta, May 31: In a matter of hours on Monday, trains plying the Siliguri-Alipurduar sector knocked down four elephants and a bison. 

 The mayhem rekindled the controversy over the Northeast Frontier Railway tracks cutting across the forest reserves and triggered a fresh round of allegations of how norms fixed by Calcutta High Court in response to a WWF (India) petition are being flouted.

 A public interest litigation (PIL) filed by the WWF in August 2000 had expressed fear that wildlife would be adversely affected by the conversion of tracks between Siliguri and Alipurduar from metre to broad gauge and sought an order against it. 

 In 2002, the court allowed the conversion provided a committee of forest and wildlife officials was formed to keep a regular check on whether its recommendations were being followed.

 The committee has only met twice. 

 Meetings between the committee, the frontier railway and NGOs like WWF took place twice on February 15 and June 10, 2003. The delegates of the second meeting were even taken to sites in Chapramari, but the impression gained was far from satisfactory, said Shakti Banerjee, the state head of the WWF. 

 The killer tracks cut through sanctuaries like Mahananda, Jaldapara and Buxa. Banerjee said: They cross the migratory routes of several animals and accidents are bound to happen. More so, because the broad gauge allows trains to pick up speed.

 Additional principal chief conservator of forest A.K. Raha said the chief minister is looking into the matter. 

 Banerjee alleged that ramps, slopes, bridges and barriers recommended to help migratory animals had either not been built or were made shoddily. It was the same with signboards to warn drivers in animal-prone areas. 

 He added: Once the tracks were opened, trains started picking up speeds of 80-90 km an hour. The recommended speed is 20-30 km an hour in vast stretches of the forests.

 About 70 elephants were killed in railway accidents across India in the past four years. Fifteen of them were killed in north Bengal, where there are about 350 elephants. This is a matter of concern, said Vinod Kumar Yadav, the deputy chief wildlife warden.

 Lalgarh, Sept. 22: Somnath Biswas, a member of the squad that went to defuse the landmine in Lalgarh yesterday, could not sleep in the Midnapore police lines last night as the vision of the mangled remains of colleague Utpal Bhakta kept coming back.

 Somnath, 47, was supposed to assist Bhakta. He had helped him pull out the milk can (in which the explosive was placed) from the soft, rain-soaked earth where it had been planted.

 After Utpal prised open the lid, he asked me to get a screwdriver. As I went towards the tool bag to get the screwdriver, I heard the blast. When I turned around, Bhakta and Basudeb (Chakraborty) were lying dead, Somnath said, sitting about 60 km from the Jhitka forest, where two of his colleagues were blown up and several journalists, who had followed the squad sniffing a story, were injured. 

 Bhaktas decision to do the screwdrivers job with a chisel proved disastrous.

 The sound of the last post echoed in the air as the bodies of Bhakta and Chakraborty left the police lines for their homes. 

 How did I live? I dont know, Somnath said with some effort.

 Director-general of police A.B. Vohra, who visited Lalgarh this morning, said: We are looking into all aspects to ascertain how the blast took place. Steps are also being taken to ensure that we are cautious while defusing landmines in the future.

 Vohra wanted to know how journalists could go so close to the place where the mine was being defused.

 An officer said over half of the 3,000-strong police force in West Midnapore is combing the 40 sq km Jhitka and Abhoya forests for the rebels.

 The blast has thrown up the names of Maoist action squad couple Sasadhar Mahato, 40, and Suchitra, 30. During the blast at Bankishole in Lalgarh two years ago (six EFR jawans were killed then), we had learnt that Sasadhar and Suchitra were involved, but couldnt get them, an officer said. 

 The police came to know last night that a group of seven guerrillas, one of them a woman, had been doing the rounds of the Jhitka and adjoining Abhoya forests for the past three days.

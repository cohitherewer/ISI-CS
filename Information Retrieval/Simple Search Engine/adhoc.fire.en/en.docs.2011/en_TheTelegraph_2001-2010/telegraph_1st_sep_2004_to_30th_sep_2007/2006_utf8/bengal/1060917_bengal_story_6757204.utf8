The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 WIL to pave way to tech jobs

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Sept. 16: The Bengal government will revamp Webel Informatics and make it a dedicated training outfit offering information technology-oriented bridge courses. 

 WIL (Webel Informatics Ltd) is already in the business of training. But we want to expand the scope of the offering and are looking at a post-Puja launch, Siddharth, the info-tech department principal secretary, said at a seminar organised by the Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry. 

 The focus of the meet, also attended by Bikash Sinha, director, Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics, and Prithwis Mukherjee of IBM India, was IT as a career choice. 

 Siddharth said the trigger behind the initiative was the demand-supply mismatch of quality professionals for the growing IT industry. Besides running job-oriented courses for the IT and ITES industry through WIL a subsidiary of Webel, the governments nodal IT agency the department will also develop a placement centre at the institute. 

 We need to initiate finishing school programmes and promote e-learning as an alternative mechanism for promoting international standard education, said Siddharth.

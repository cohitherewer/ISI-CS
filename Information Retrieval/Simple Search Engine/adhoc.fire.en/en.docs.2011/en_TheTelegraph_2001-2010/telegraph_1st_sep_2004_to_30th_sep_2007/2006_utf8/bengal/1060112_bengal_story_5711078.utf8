The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 After bogus voters, tale of the voteless

 OUR BUREAU

 Rao: Rural run

 Krishnagar/Barasat, Jan. 11: If K.J. Rao has detected a large number of bogus voters, one of his colleagues has found that hundreds in a border village do not have their names on electoral rolls.

 Sudhir Kumar, the observer for North 24-Parganas and one of the 19 appointed by the Election Commission, made a whirlwind tour of various areas close to the Bangladesh border today.

 During his visit to Shekhati village, 55 km from Calcutta, the subdivisional officer of Bongaon, Bhudeb Biswas, informed him that out of a population of 902, nearly 700 did not have their names in the voters list. The 700-odd villagers have applied for inclusion of their names.

 I have never come across such a situation anywhere in the country where nearly 78 per cent of the residents are not in the voters list, Kumar told Biswas.

 Kumar asked district magistrate Manoj Pant to personally look into the problem and also heard grievances from political parties before setting off for the Gaighata, Bongaon and Bagda areas. He asked the block development officers to speed up the revision of electoral rolls.

 At Bogula village of Hanskhali in Nadia, 75 km from Calcutta, Rao caught high school teacher Shyamal Mondal with voter identity cards of two pupils aged 16 and 18 years. He had declared they were his sons though the boys are Bangladeshis by birth.

 Rao asked the teacher why he had done so. I was forced to do it as my pupils wanted to settle in India and get jobs here, Mondal told Rao.

 This is very serious. Investigate the matter and find out how many such cases are there, Rao told additional district magistrate Rajesh Sinha.

 Rao stepped out of the Krishnagar circuit house at 9.15 am today, ready to take stock of false voters in villages of Nabadwip, Shantipur and the Ranaghat I and II blocks.

 In course of his inspection, he visited about 20 villages in four blocks covering about 200 km. 

 At places like the Ranaghat railway quarters and the Nasheekuli and Rainaga villages in the Ranaghat subdivision, he detected over 300 voters who had moved out or died.

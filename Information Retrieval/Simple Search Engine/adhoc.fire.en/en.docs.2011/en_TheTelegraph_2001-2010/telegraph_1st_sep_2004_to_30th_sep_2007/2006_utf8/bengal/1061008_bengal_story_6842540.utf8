 City dengue count rises 

CMC glare on locked houses 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Oct. 7: Two new cases of dengue have been confirmed in Calcutta even as more blood samples are being rushed to laboratories for tests.

 Calcutta Municipal Corporation sources said a 25-year-old woman from Picnic Garden Road has tested positive for dengue. Last night, a 13-year-old boy from Nayabad, Garia, also tested positive. 

 A CMC official said the woman was admitted in a private nursing home and her condition is stable. With the two cases, the dengue count in the city this year has risen to 32. 

 Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya, however, said the number was much lower than last year. According to him, at this time in 2005, the dengue count was touching 3,000.

 In order to check the spread of dengue, the CMC has decided to seek police help to break into houses that have been under lock and key for long and clean out accumulated water a fertile breeding ground for mosquitoes that cause dengue.

 Yesterday, the Indian Council of Medical Research received five new blood samples of patients with dengue symptoms. The samples have come from National Medical College and Hospital, Beliaghata ID Hospital and a private clinic, ICMR officials said.

 The ICMR will also get kits to conduct tests for chikungunya. We have spoken to National Institute of Virology, Pune, and they are likely to send the kits shortly, said Sujit Kumar Bhattacharya, the additional director-general of ICMR. 

 The step was taken after a fever with symptoms similar to chikungunya gripped more than 2,000 people in North 24-Parganas. Their blood samples have been sent to the Pune virology institute.

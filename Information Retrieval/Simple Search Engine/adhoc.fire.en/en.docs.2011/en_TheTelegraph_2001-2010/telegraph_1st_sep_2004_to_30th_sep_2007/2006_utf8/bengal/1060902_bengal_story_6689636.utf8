 No Puja at Singur

 Singur farmers protesting against the acquisition

 Singur/Calcutta, Sept. 1: Farmers armed with brooms, bamboo sticks and sickles today prevented a team of six officials from distributing notices on land acquisition at Beraberi village in Singur.

 Hooghly district magistrate Binod Kumar said: Even if the people reject the notices (in which they are being told that their plots are being acquired in lieu of a compensation), the land will be acquired.

 The Krishi Jomi Banchao (save farmland) Committee, said Singur farmers would not celebrate Durga Puja this year to protest against the takeover of over 1,000 acres for Tata Motors car factory.

 Land minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah said participating in a festival was a matter of personal choice. What can the government do?

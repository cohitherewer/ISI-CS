 Witch tag drives out family of 15 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Ranaghat, Sept. 2: An ojhas verdict has taken its toll on a family again.

 Six months after Kalipada Hembram, his wife and children were driven out of Kalna for allegedly practising witchcraft, the same fate befell a 65-year-old widow and her family of 14 in a Nadia village. 

 Residents of Balaighata accused Haridasi Sardar, her four sons, their wives and six children of casting a black magic spell that resulted in several deaths of people and livestock in the village over the past month.

 The villagers had brought an ojha (witch doctor) to find out the cause of the deaths. After performing a puja over some days, he declared that Haridasi and her four sons all farmers were to blame.

 Yesterday morning, a few hundred villagers surrounded Haridasis home comprising a cluster of huts, about 60 km from Calcutta. They dragged the widow and her family out.

 The crowd went on the rampage, breaking tiles on the roofs, and forced Haridasi, her sons Bhajan, Nemai, Mohan and Swapan, their wives and children out of the village. 

 They warned us that if we try to enter the village, we will be burnt to death, said Bhajan, Haridasis eldest son. 

 The family has taken shelter in Ranaghat police station.

 We drove them out because they are daini (witches), and it is because of them that innocent villagers are dying, said Sishubala Sardar, a resident of Balaighata. 

 A police team from Ranaghat went to the village yesterday to persuade the villagers to take Haridasi and her family back. But they were chased out with sandals, brooms and brickbats. 

 A case has been registered against the villagers.

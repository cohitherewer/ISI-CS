The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Citu leader killed over bus protest

 - Frankenstein of cadre raj has a free run

 SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE

 Calcutta, May 24: A Citu leader died after being kicked and punched by a bus conductor and his helper on VIP Road last night for raising his voice against rash driving. 

 Bhaskar Banerjee, secretary of the auto-rickshaw union in Nagerbazar, Dum Dum, was declared dead on arrival at a local nursing home. 

 His killers may or may not be Citu supporters, but represent a culture that encourages bus operators to become a law unto themselves.

 Police said Banerjee, 41, a resident of the locality off airports gate No. 2, was cyc-ling along VIP Road around 7.30 pm when a minibus ply-ing between New Barrack-pore and Howrah brushed past him at break-neck speed some 200 metres from Keshtopur. 

 Banerjee lost his balance and fell as the bus sped away.

 Angry, Banerjee pedalled fast to catch up with the bus. He finally did so at the Keshtopur signal. Leaving his cycle on the road, he climbed onto the bus, identified himself as a Citu leader and asked the driver to drive properly. 

 The conductor and the helper were unfazed. They asked him to get off the bus and mind his own business. As he refused to budge, the conductor pushed him and a scuffle ensued. The signal turned green and the bus began to gain speed. The union leader was punched on the face and thrown off the speeding bus, an officer of the Rajarhat police station said. 

 Residents rushed to the injured man and police were informed. They arrived in 15 minutes and Banerjee was rushed to a nursing home.

 In the jeep, the Citu leader narrated to the policemen the incident before slipping into unconsciousness, an officer said. 

 Doctors at the nursing home near Teghoria declared Banerjee dead. 

 He sustained injuries in his head. He was brought dead. We suspect he died of internal haemorrhage, said P. Majumder, a nursing home official. 

 With whatever information police could gather from Banerjee and the residents, a hunt was launched for the minibus and its crew. 

 We know on what route the minibus plies. We hope to nab the crew and seize the vehicle soon, said Praveen Kumar, the North 24-Parganas superintendent of police.

 The state Citu leadership condemned the incident and demanded the culprits arrest. We do not care whether the conductor or his helper belonged to Citu or not. We demand immediate police action, said Kali Ghosh, the state secretary of the CPMs trade union wing.

 Ghosh said Citu was aware of the belligerent attitude of some of its workers and attempts were being made to discipline them. The aggressiveness of some of our workers is in our knowledge. We are trying our best to control them effectively, he said. 

 Minibus owners said all drivers, conductors and helpers owe their allegiance to Citu. We are helpless and totally at their mercy. If we try to rein them in, they will force our buses off the road, said Pradip Bose, the assistant secretary of Mini Bus Owners Syndicate.

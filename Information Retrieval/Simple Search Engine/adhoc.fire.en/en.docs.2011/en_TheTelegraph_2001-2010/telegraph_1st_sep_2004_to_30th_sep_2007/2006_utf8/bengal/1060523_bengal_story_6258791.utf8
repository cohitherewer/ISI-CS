The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Death on pushback route

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, May 22: A Bangladeshi, one among 68 infiltrators brought from Delhi to be sent back to their country, died last night after reaching Kalyani. 

 Abdul Lal Mian, 45, was a resident of Khulna district. 

 His wife Hena, who was pushed back to Bangladesh along with her 12-year-old son and the others last night, lodged a complaint with Nadia police saying her husband was not taken care of though he fell ill on the train from Delhi.

 The Bangladeshis got down from the train at Chitpur station in Calcutta, but Abdul was allegedly not taken to a doctor despite repeated requests to the Delhi police personnel escorting them.

 Nadia police said an investigation has begun. We have begun a probe as the man died on the way. If the post-mortem reveals something unusual, we will report to Delhi police as Abdul was in their custody, additional police superintendent Biswarup Ghosh said. 

 What will happen to my son? Who will look after him? Hena asked Kalyani subdivi- sional officer Subhash Sen on her way out.

 The police said the Bangladeshis, who were working as labourers in various parts of Delhi, were brought to Nadia on a truck.

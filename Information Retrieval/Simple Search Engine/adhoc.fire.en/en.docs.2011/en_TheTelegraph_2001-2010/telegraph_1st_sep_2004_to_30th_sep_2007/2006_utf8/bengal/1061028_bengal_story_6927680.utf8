The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Are we here for fun? HC

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, Oct. 27: Around 40,000 trucks that flout all pollution norms turn Calcuttas air more poisonous by night than by day. 

 This is a serious issue. But the government is finding no time for the last 15 months to file an affidavit stating what steps it has taken to solve the problem, Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurkar said. 

 No one appeared on behalf of the state when the matter came up for hearing today. What is this? Are we here for fun? the judges asked. 

 The division bench of the chief justice and Justice N. Patheriya ordered the government to file an affidavit stating its stand on curbing pollution from heavy vehicles at night. 

 Let a copy of our order be sent to the chief secretary, the judges said. 

 Lawyers said the government would face contempt if this order was flouted. 

 Environment activist Subhash Dutta moved a public interest litigation in February 2005 seeking the courts intervention to bring down pollution from heavy vehicles entering the city at night. 

 There are systems to check the emission level of vehicles during the day. But at night, the pollution level is four times the permissible limit because of the trucks, he said.

 According to a 1995 World Bank report, which Dutta cited in his petition, 5,726 people died prematurely in 1991 and 1992 of diseases caused by pollution. During this period, 30 lakh people in the city had to be hospitalised with respiratory problems. 

 Hearing the plea, the court passed an order in July last year asking the state to file an affidavit in four weeks stating what steps it was going to take to prevent the entry of polluting vehicles. The affidavit is yet to be submitted.

 Dutta was present in the court today.

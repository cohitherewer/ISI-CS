 CM jammer on push list

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Oct. 12 : The 

 chief minister will have his own jammer for the first time, 

 if the state police have their way.

 Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee currently travels even in Maoist-hit districts with a jammer hired from a central security agency.

 The remote-control device, which can jam all remote signals used to trigger blasts, had proved to be Pervez Musharrafs saviour during an assassination attempt in 2003. Jammers were also a constant fixture in former Andhra Pradesh chief minister N. Chandrababu Naidus convoy.

 We want to have our own jammer. We have written to the Centre for one. Today, we decided to pursue it so that we get it soon. We should have got a jammer of our own a long time ago, a senior police official said after a meeting to discuss the strengthening of the chief ministers security.

 The meeting, convened by state director-general of police A.B. Vohra, also decided to give Bhattacharjees security personnel new clothes. Instead of the regular police uniform, the men will now be dressed in dungarees and safaris to help them move faster.

 The decision to step up the chief ministers security came in the wake of the recent Maoist blast in Lalgarh, where a careless re-enactment of bomb disposal had cost two lives.

 Security officials accompanying Bhattacharjee to flood-affected districts last month had said the number of his armed bodyguards should be increased. It was decided today that the security ring would be tightened during such trips.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Centre nod to states cable watchdog

 SIMI KAMBOJ

 Facing the axe

Calcutta, Aug. 19: The government has now got the teeth to tackle cable operators dishing out objectionable content. 

 Information and culture secretary Dilip Chakraborty today said the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India and the Union information and broadcasting ministry have asked the state to form a committee to monitor the content of cable channels. 

 We will supervise with special care astrology channels and programmes with indecent content, Chakraborty said.

 City police chief Prasun Mukherjee will chair the committee, which will decide what is objectionable and initiate action against the offenders. Social workers and heads of womens colleges will also be part of this panel.

 In the past, the Left Front government had breathed fire on astrology programmes, but was unable to do much as it was not empowered to do anything under the Cable Regulation Act, 1995 

 The Centres clearance is welcome, Chakraborty said.

 There are 10 local cable channels in the city, which broadcast through optic fibre cables. All these, barring one, feature programmes on astro-logy. These include phone-in slots, where viewers call up astrology experts for advice.

 Multi-system operators provide one or two free frequencies to the local cable operators to air films and songs.

 The cable industry, which supports around 4,000 operators in the Calcutta metropolitan area, may not take kindly to the governments move.

 Although we dont control content, we do not allow anything on air that goes against the provisions of the Cable Regulation Act. If we come to know of such content, we switch off the channel, said Sudip Ghosh, director, Manthan Broadband. 

 Ghosh recalled a channel being taken off air because it was beaming bidi ads.

 Even satellite channels show astrology programmes in the morning. Only their format is somewhat different. As for objectionable content, we welcome the move if the government can define what is objectionable, he added.

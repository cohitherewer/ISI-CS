The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Trinamul tower tilts 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, May 11: Even 

 its centre did not quite hold for the Trinamul Congress. 

 The Left sweep of the state hurt Mamata Banerjee most where 

 her strength lay. Not even Cal-cutta, her fort, was safe 

 any more from the Left onslaught.

 The urban voters, in Calcutta and its neighbouring districts, seem to have swung substantially in favour of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees pro-development politics.

 Mamatas politics came to be increasingly seen as disruptive, populist and anti-development. Ironically, these were once the hallmarks of Left politics in old Bengal. 

 At a time when an economic resurgence of Bengal col- oured politics as well, her attempt to hold on to old-style street politics could not be much of a draw. 

 Not only the upper and middle classes but also the poor increasingly identified more with Bhattacharjees promises of better days in their lives. 

 Mamata missed the changing mood 

 even in her own social constituency. 

 The tally of the 21 seats in Calcutta tells the story only partially. In 2001, Trinamul secured 11 seats, the Left eight and the Congress two. 

 This time, Trinamul was down to nine, while the Left improved its score to nine. The Congress, too, added one to its 2001 score. 

 For all of nine years of its existence, Trinamul has been a party of south Bengal. Mamatas appeal and influence have been confined primarily to five districts in south Bengal ? Calcutta, South 24-Parganas, North 24-Parganas, Nadia and East Midnapore, which together have 143 seats. 

 Calcutta, of course, remained her area of hope. When she got 11 seats in the city in 2001, the vote share of the Trinamul-Congress alliance rose to nearly 48 per cent, the highest for the Opposition in any district over the past 29 years. That is clearly now the story of the past. 

 The defeat of the Trinamul candidate, Tapas Roy, at Burrabazar suggests that even traditional anti-Left voters among the non-Bengali communities are moving towards the Left. Obviously, these people are not enamoured of the Left ideology; they now see the Left as business-friendly and more dependable for growth and stability. 

 Similar sentiments may have caused another Trinamul heavyweight, Paresh Pal, to lose at Manicktala. 

 Mamatas two main con- solations were the victory of Javed Khan at Ballygunge and Subrata Bakshi at Chowrin- ghee. 

 The Chowringhee victory must have tasted sweeter as her nominee defeated former mayor and her one-time mentor, Subrata Mukherjee, whose defection from Trinamul caused the partys loss of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation in the civic elections last year. 

 But Calcutta was no isola-ted story. The Lefts near-clean sweep in North 24-Pargan- as shrunk Trinamuls area of hope. 

 Although it did somewhat better in South 24-Parganas, the feat did not quite fulfil the promise it had shown in the district in 2001, when it was the only district other than Calcutta where Trinamul was ahead of the Left.

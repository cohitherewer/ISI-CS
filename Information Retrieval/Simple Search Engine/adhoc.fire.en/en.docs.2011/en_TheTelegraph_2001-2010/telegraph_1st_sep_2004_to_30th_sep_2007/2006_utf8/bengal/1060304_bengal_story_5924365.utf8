The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Go green, get cool cuts

 SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE

 Calcutta, March 3: The Centre and the state government have together drawn up a plan to provide heavy discounts on battery-driven cars, three-wheelers and solar power to promote their use in urban areas. 

 Those installing solar water-heaters at home will get a 40-paise per unit discount on electricity bills, power min-ister Mrinal Banerjee said. 

 Those buying property in New Town can expect tax concessions, too, if they use solar power for domestic purposes, housing minister Goutam Deb said. 

 Battery-driven four-wheelers that cost around Rs 3 lakh would come with a discount of 70,000, said S.P. Gonchow-dhury, director of the West Bengal Renewable Energy Development Agency. The price cut for eco-friendly three-wheelers would be Rs 10,000 more. 

 The Centre and the state government would share the burden. Delhi will provide about 65 per cent of the subsidy and the state the remaining, which will go directly to the manufacturers, Gonchowdhury said.

 Only two battery-driven cars and seven three-wheelers now run in Calcutta.

 A Lucknow-based company makes the three-wheelers, three of which run in Durgapur. Salt Lake muni-cipality runs three vehicles. NGOs and other institutions run the rest. Commercial operations are yet to begin, said Gonchowdhury. 

 His agency will also introduce in the market bio-diesel ? conventional diesel mixed with oil extracted from jatropha seeds. The owner of a bio-diesel vehicle will spend about Rs 8 a litre less than others, Gonchowdhury said, adding that this alternative is still in the research and development stage. 

 To increase supply, the jatropha plant is being cultivated in Purulia, Birbhum and Jalpaiguri.

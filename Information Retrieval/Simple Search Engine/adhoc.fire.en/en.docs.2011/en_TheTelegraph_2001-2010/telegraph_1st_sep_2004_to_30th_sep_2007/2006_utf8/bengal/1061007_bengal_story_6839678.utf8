The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Doctor, brother, mother in death deal

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Uttarpara, Oct. 6: A 45-year-old doctor, his share broker brother and septuagenarian mother were found dead in their flat here this afternoon.

 Neighbours, alerted by a foul smell emanating from the first-floor flat on Rajendra Avenue, called police. 

 They broke open the door and found Chanchal Nandy and his brother Sadhan hanging from the ceiling fan hook in one of the bedrooms. Mother Usha was found in a similar state in the other bedroom. 

 Police said the brothers were single and their mother a widow.

 Both Sadhan and Chanchal were in jeans and shirt. 

 A note found on the dining table said no one was responsible for the deaths. It asked the police to cremate their bodies and throw the Shiv and Kali idols in the thakur ghar (worship room) in a river or pond. It also asked us not to disturb any of their relatives, a police officer said.

 The maggot-infested bodies have been sent for post-mortem, but the police are clueless about the possible reason behind this suicide pact. 

 Our preliminary investigations suggest suicide and the reason does not appear to be financial. We have to wait for the post-mortem report, said Hooghly superintendent of police Supratim Sarkar.

 The Nandys came to live in Uttarpara, 15 km from Calcutta, from Ranchi about a year and a half ago. The doctor had studied in Ranchi. We still know very little about the family. But investigations are on, Sarkar said.

 An officer on the case said the mother and her two sons were last seen visiting local Puja pandals on Navami. 

 There were no newspapers on the day after Dashami and we found papers for October 4, 5 and 6, which had not been collected from the door. They probably died on Dashami, an officer said.

 Neighbours said the trio kept a low profile. We didnt even know that Chanchal Nandy was a doctor. About two months ago, he put up a signboard saying he was a skin specialist available for consultation. We dont know how many patients visited him, said Kaushik Mitra, 34. 

 However, Kaushik Mun- shi, a doctor who has a chamber on the ground floor of the three-storey building, said Chanchal often came to him to discuss medical cases. He was very polite and well-mannered.

 Munshi said that after completing his MBBS, Chanchal had done a diploma co- urse in sexually-transmitted diseases. 

 He had told Munshi that he longed to do a postgraduate course in medicine.

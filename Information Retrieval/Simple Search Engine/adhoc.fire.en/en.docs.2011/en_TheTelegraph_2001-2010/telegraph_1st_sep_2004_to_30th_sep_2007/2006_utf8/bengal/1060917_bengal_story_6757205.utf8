The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 If cabbie says no, jst txt ur cmplnt

 PRONAB MONDAL

Calcutta, Sept. 16: The next time a cab driver refuses you, dont go running to get hold of a traffic sergeant. Stay put, send an SMS and help will be at hand.

 Keeping an eye on the rapid rise in instances of taxi refusal, police have come up with the Puja gift for the city. 

 Well formally announce it a week later. From then on, people can avail of the facility throughout the year, said Jawed Shamim, deputy commissioner, traffic. 

 The number to which the messages have to be sent would be announced at the formal launch of the service.

 A traffic department official said: A large section of people is usually not ready to take the trouble of going to a traffic guards office and fill up a taxi refusal form. Our move is meant to help them.

 Shamim said the SMS should mention the taxis registration number and the exact location where the refusal took place. Once the message reaches our control-room at Lalbazar, computers will register it instantly and our officers will try to find out whether a sergeant is on duty nearby. If one of them is posted close to the spot, he will be instructed to intercept the taxi.

 Apart from complaints regarding refusal, commuters might also report misbehaviour by a driver or other employees of any commercial vehicle and faulty meters.

 Information about traffic snarls in the city would also be a click away. A person has to key in TRAFFIC and send a message. We will promptly deliver a list of roads where the traffic congestion is serious, Shamim said. 

 The numbers to which the SMSes have to be sent would vary according to the service being sought. All of them would be announced the same day. 

 Shamim had a request for commuters: Once refused, send the SMS instantly. It will help us reach the offender that much faster.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Colleges meet donors term

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, July 25: The 

 Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government has decided to grant 

 full financial autonomy to four state-controlled engineering 

 and technological colleges.

 The decision, approved at a cabinet meeting today, was taken to comply with the World Banks conditions for availing funds under its Rs 153-crore Improvement of Quality of Technical Education Project. 

 Once they are allowed financial autonomy, the colleges would be free to spend on themselves without government interference, said a government official.

 The World Bank, at the time of allotting the funds two years ago, had specified four terms ? that the colleges must enjoy full academic, financial, managerial and administrative autonomy. 

 Kalyani Engineering College, Jalpaiguri Engineering College, Government College of Textile Technology, Serampore, and Government College of Ceramic Technology, Calcutta ? the four colleges that were granted financial autonomy today ? had been given academic, administrative and managerial autonomy earlier.

 There are 11 beneficiary institutions under the World Bank project, including the four. 

 The colleges were allotted Rs 10 crore each under the World Bank project and they were facing problems in utilising the funds. 

 Moreover, officials said, the World Bank had hinted that it would stop the flow of funds if the government further delayed the process of granting financial autonomy to the colleges.

 The rest of the beneficiaries of the World Bank project include the technology faculties of Calcutta University, Jadavpur University and Bengal Engineering and Science University, apart from four private engineering colleges. 

 The technology faculties did not face any problem because as soon as the World Bank funds were sanctioned, the universities, being the parent institutions, granted them autonomous financial powers.

 Sources in the four government colleges said todays decision would expedite the progress of the programmes undertaken by them using the World Bank funds. The first phase of the quality improvement programme is slated to be complete by March 2007. 

 Bengal is the last among 13 states to accept the World Bank project because the CPM had delayed examining the conditions of the offer. As a result, the project was launched here at least 17 months later than in the other states.

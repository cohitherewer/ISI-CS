The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Hope of SC circuit bench

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, Dec. 16: The possibility of a Supreme Court circuit bench being set up in Calcutta has brightened with the third high court building opposite the Assembly nearing completion.

 Members of the Bar Council of India (BCI) have been demanding the circuit bench for the last one decade. The council had also submitted a memorandum to the law ministry in the mid-nineties. 

 Along with Bengal, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu have been waiting long for a circuit bench of the apex court, said Ashok Deb, an executive committee member of the BCI. 

 A large number of litigants are being denied justice in Calcutta as they cannot afford to go to Delhi to file their cases. Hence, the need for a circuit bench, Deb said, quoting the memorandum. 

 He added that the third high court building coming up opposite the Assembly could house the apex courts circuit bench. 

 Officials in the law ministry had told us in the mid-nineties that there was not enough space in Calcutta High Court for a circuit bench. However, it had assured us that the Centre would consider the proposal when Calcutta High Court authorities are able to arrange adequate space, Deb said.

 Now we have enough space, and the time is ripe to plead with the Centre for setting up the apex courts circuit bench here, he said, adding that BCI members would shortly meet to discuss the matter.

 L.K. Sil, secretary to the Chief Justice of Calcutta High Court, echoed Deb, saying the circuit bench can be set up across the three floors of the 10-storeyed new building. The building will be ready by March 31, 2007. Interior decoration for the rest of the floors will also be done by December 31 next year. So, there will be no space problem.

 BCI members pointed out that several litigants would benefit if they had the liberty to move special leave petitions in the Supreme Court circuit bench against high court orders. Besides, some matters, particularly related to the environment, can be taken straight to the apex court.

 Music in metal, 

 symphony in stone

 Sankho Chaudhuri (1916-2006) 

 Sankho Chaudhuri 

 and one of his creations 

 Sankho Chaudhuri, who died at 

 age 90 in Delhi on Monday, was one of the stalwarts of Indian 

 sculpture who could be ranked with other masters like Pradosh 

 Dasgupta, Somnath Hore and Meera Mukherjee. He is survived 

 by wife Ira Debi, a ceramist.

 Chaudhuri was best known for carving 

 his pieces out of wood and stone or moulding in metal simple 

 and austere forms mostly intertwined with each other or 

 broken into angles. These often had a sweeping loftiness 

 and smooth and polished surfaces. Besides a variety of wood, 

 he used marble, both black and white and with zebra stripes, 

 and limestone, which were characterised by a sheen. 

 Chaudhuri was profoundly inspired 

 by Ramkinkar Baij. Demonstrating a mastery of carving, Chaudhuris 

 abstractions of human figures expressed an innate sense 

 of rhythm. He had a sensitive feel for material, which was 

 often transformed into a lyrical rendering of form. 

 Some of his best-known works are 

 Shringar, carved out of zebra marble, Cock 

 in copper, Music in aluminium and brass and Chemist 

 in brass. 

 He was adept at moulding terracotta 

 portraits. Chaudhuri moulded these portraits in metal or 

 carved them out of stone. Following the technique of Ramkinkar 

 and Jacob Epstein, his portraits mostly had a pitted skin 

 and a rough texture. 

 Chaudhuri was drawn to the smooth 

 yet abstract forms of Romanian sculptor Brancusi during 

 his stay in Paris. 

 He used diverse material, starting 

 with clay, terracotta, plaster and cement, subsequently 

 moving on to stone and wood and ultimately metal. He either 

 moulded bronze or used sheets of copper, brass and aluminium.

 Chaudhuri, whose ancestors lived 

 in Pabna district of former East Bengal, was born in 1916 

 at Deoghar. He was the youngest child of Narendranath, an 

 advocate, and Kiranmayi. 

 His elder brother Sachindranath, 

 the founder-editor of the Economic Weekly published 

 from Mumbai, had encouraged him to take up sculpture.

 After studying for a while in 

 Dhaka, Chaudhuri joined Visva-Bharati in 1935. Having graduated, 

 he undertook training at Kala Bhavan.

 Thereafter, he started assisting 

 Ramkinkar and travelled to Nepal on an assignment, where 

 he acquired the skill of moulding metal the Nepalese way.

 He started working independently 

 in Mumbai in 1946 and, after receiving a grant from the 

 government, created 20 works which were exhibited there 

 in 1949. He left for Europe the same year for further training 

 and took part in exhibitions in famous museums in Italy, 

 Belgium, Holland and Switzerland. 

 After he joined MS University 

 in Baroda as the head of the faculty of arts in 1950, he 

 was instrumental in constructing a large studio and foundry 

 there. 

 Having taught for about 20 years, 

 he took voluntary retirement but continued his work in Delhi, 

 where he lived for a good part of his life.

 Chaudhuri won the Desikottama 

 in Santiniketan.

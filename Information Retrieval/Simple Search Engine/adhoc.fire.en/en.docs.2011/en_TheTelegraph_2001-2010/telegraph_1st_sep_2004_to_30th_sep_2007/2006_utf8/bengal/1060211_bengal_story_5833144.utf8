The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Jawans assault teacher in rush

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Feb. 10: A teacher was slapped, kicked and hit with rifle butts by two Border Security Force jawans in Nadia for allegedly speeding on his motorcycle to reach school on time.

 Hiranmoy Biswas, a mathematics teacher, had to be hospitalised with a bleeding nose and ears. A doctor said he is under observation. 

 Around 10.45 am, the jawans intercepted Biswas apparently taking him for a smuggler when he was going past a bazaar, about 3 km from Rangiarpota Junior High School at Simulia near Chapra, about 130 km from Calcutta. 

 Biswas pleaded with the jawans that he would miss the first period if he was not allowed to go, but the jawans paid no heed, a man who witnessed the thrashing said. 

 Nadia police said the BSF has no jurisdiction to enforce speed limits. The jawans should have handed Biswas to us if he had really done anything wrong, an officer said. 

 District superintendent of police R. Rajsekharan said a case has been started and an assault charge slapped on the two unknown jawans. 

 The jawans pushed Biswas off his motorcycle and thrashed him. As he slumped on the ground, they kicked him repeatedly. I entreated with them that I am not a smuggler, but they refused to believe and started hitting me with their rifles, the teacher said from his hospital bed.

 A BSF officer said: Weve also ordered a probe against the two accused jawans. He refused to divulge their names, though.

 As the news of the commotion near the bazaar reached the nearby Simulia High School, students and teachers, including headmaster Jyotirmoy Ghosh, came out to see Biswas being assaulted. They rescued him and took him to the hospital.

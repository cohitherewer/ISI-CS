 Krishnagar, Aug. 3: A 13-year-old girl fell unconscious in her classroom this morning after being hit on the head several times by her teacher.

 Basana Bhadra, a Class VIII student of Kalinagar Girls School in Nadia, was cleaning her ear with a rolled up piece of paper when her mathematics teacher, Debjani Haldar, pulled her up for being inattentive.

 Haldar hit her twice on the head and went back to solving sums on the blackboard.

 My school bag slid off the desk and I bent down to pick it up along with the books that had scattered on the floor. Didi (Haldar) saw me and became furious. She rushed towards me and then started hitting me on my head with her hand. My head throbbed as if it would burst. Everything in front of me became a blur. I dont know what happened after that, said Basana, who was taken to Shaktinagar Hospital. 

 Rahul Gupta, a doctor at the hospital, said he feared the girl had internal injuries as she was repeatedly struck on the head. We have given her a life-saving injection and she is under observation. We will carry out a CT scan as soon as possible as she was complaining of a splitting headache and blurred vision. We have also come to know that she is a patient of migraine, he said.

 Deputy chief medical officer of health Mohan Basu said a report on Basanas condition and injuries, if any, would be sent to police. 

 Basanas father Abhimanyu, a vegetable trader in Kalinagar, about 85 km from Calcutta, said he rushed to the school as soon as he was informed that Basana had fallen unconscious. My house is a few hundred yards from the school. I saw my daughter lying on a bench. I sprinkled water on her face and she gradually regained consciousness and complained of a severe headache. 

 Abhimanyu has lodged complaints against the teacher with the school managing committee and the school education department of Nadia. 

 My daughter is a patient of migraine and the teachers knew it. How can they beat up my daughter like this? I want exemplary punishment for the teacher, he said. 

 All the 12 teachers of the school, including Haldar, and headmistress Sukla Saha visited Basana in hospital today.

 Haldar later apologised to Saha. I could not control myself She is my favourite student, she said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Couple held

 Krishnagar, Dec. 4: Nadia police today arrested a young Bengali couple from Gujarat on charges of luring a 12-year-old girl to Ahmedabad and trying to sell her to a brothel.

 Sukhen Mondal and his wife Phulrenu are being brought back. Police said the girl had managed to contact her family in Tehatta, 200 km from Calcutta. Realising that he could be caught, Sukhen brought her back and claimed that he rescued her. As the girl kept mum out of fear, he walked out of the police station and fled.

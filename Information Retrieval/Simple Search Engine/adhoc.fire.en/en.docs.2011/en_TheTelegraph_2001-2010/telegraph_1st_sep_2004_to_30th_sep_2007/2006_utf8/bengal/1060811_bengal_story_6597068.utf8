The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Singur speed-up bid

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 11: The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government will deploy additional manpower to ensure faster acquisition of land for the Tata small car project in Singur.

 The government wants to finish the exercise before Durga Puja.

 Commerce and industry minister Nirupam Sen and land and land reforms minister Abdur Rezzak Molla today met Hooghly district magistrate Vinod Kumar. They asked him about the status of land acquisition and whether any assistance was required to speed things up.

 The DM said he needed more manpower for conducting the hearing within 15 days. Weve asked him for an assessment, said an official of the land and land reforms department.

 The hearing of complaints, which was to have been conducted over two years, will now have to be done in 15 days.

 The land and land reforms department has declared August 28 as the last date for filing objections.

 The government has also decided to notify land rates for public convenience.

 The DM said he was under pressure from local farmers, who wanted to know what land rates the government was offering. Weve decided to issue public notices of the rates, said an official. 

 So far, the government has received only around 200 applications of consent for handing over land. Officials said more farmers were interested in parting with their land but were waiting to know the rates.

 It was also decided at the meeting today that the government would acquire 1,000 acres in Rajarhat for the Housing Infrastructure Development Corporation.

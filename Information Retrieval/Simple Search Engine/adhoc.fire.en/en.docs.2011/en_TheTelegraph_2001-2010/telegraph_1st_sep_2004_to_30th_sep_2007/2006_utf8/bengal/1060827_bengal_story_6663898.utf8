 Calcutta, Aug. 26: This year, the citys trees and saplings are getting new clothes for Durga Puja.

 Over 2,500 trees and saplings will be wrapped in iron fences to protect them from the crowds in the festive season.

 The state forest department has started putting the iron guards in place and the exercise a first for the city is expected to be over by September 15, 12 days before Durga comes calling.

 Out of 83 roads where about 20,000 trees were planted to celebrate Forestry Week last month, the department has shortlisted some areas where the big-budget pujas are held.

 Amherst Street, Hatibagan, Central Avenue, Ballygunge Circular Road, Syed Amir Ali Avenue, Park Circus, Esplanade, S.P. Mukherjee Road, College Square and some places in Salt Lake are on the list.

 These are some of the vulnerable areas where people flock during the pujas and there is a high probability of the trees getting damaged by them. So these areas will have to be given special attention, said Somnath Mukherjee, the deputy conservator of forests (urban forestry). 

 According to Mukherjee, many saplings were stamped to death during Durga Puja last year. 

 The department has approached Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners (HRBC) and Calcutta Port Trust for funding the programme. One tree guard will cost around Rs 700. The total cost would be around Rs 1,75,000. We have spoken to both HRBC and Calcutta Port Trust. We are hoping they will fund the programme, Mukherjee said.

 Bamboo fencing for the less vulnerable trees is also in the forest departments pipeline. These are less expensive compared to iron guards. They will be used to fence trees in areas that are comparatively less crowded, said an official of the department.

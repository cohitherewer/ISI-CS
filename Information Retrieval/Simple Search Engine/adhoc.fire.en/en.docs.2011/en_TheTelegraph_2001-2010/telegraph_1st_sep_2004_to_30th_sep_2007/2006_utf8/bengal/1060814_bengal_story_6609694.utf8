 Torture stink in monk suicide

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Aug. 13: A 30-year-old monk allegedly committed suicide inside an ashram by hanging from the ceiling early this morning.

 Bhabahari Brahmmachari was found hanging naked, a saffron sheet tied round his neck, around 6 am in the corridor of Nrishinghapally Sebasram Math, which was bustling with devotees.

 The death sparked a wave of fury among the devotees and residents, who alleged that Bhabahari had been mentally and physically tortured by ashram-in-charge Gour Krishna Brahmachari.

 They dragged Brahmachari out of his room and gheraoed him. Police said the head monk told the mob that Bhabahari was mentally disturbed and so he had asked him to leave the Math last night. 

 I cant help it if a man commits suicide because I asked him to leave the ashram, a police officer quoted Brahmachari as saying.

 Bhabahari had joined the ashram, about 85 km from Calcutta, only a week ago and was popular among devotees, the police said.

 Residents also lodged a complaint with the police, charging the head monk with abusing Bhabahari and financial embezzlement. 

 The police have detained Brahmachari. We have started a case of abetment to suicide against Brahmachari. We are interrogating him, said inspector-in-charge of the Kotwali police station Dibyendu Banerjee. 

 An officer said local residents have claimed that Brahmachari was not in the ashram when Bhabaharis body was discovered and slipped in while the crowd was protesting.

 The head monk had gone to the banks of the Bhagirathi about a kilometre away to pray. Brahmacharis interrogation revealed that both monks had slept in the same room in separate cots, he said, adding that the police would also probe why the monk was found hanging naked.

 The police said several monks have left the ashram in the past, accusing Brahmachari of torture and corruption.

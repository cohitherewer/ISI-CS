The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Plan for K2 climb with Pak

 OUR BUREAU

 Darjeeling, Oct. 15: The Himalayan Mountaineering Institute will place before the Centre a proposal for a joint India-Pakistan expedition to K2, the second highest peak in the world.

 The executive council of the institute, headed by defence minister Pranab Mukherjee, has cleared the plan.

 We are waiting for the secretary-level talks between the two countries next month, after which the proposal is likely to be made, HMI principal Col. J.S. Dhillon told The Telegraph.

 Joint expeditions are a novel way of fostering peace between nations, Dhillon said. We are hopeful of a positive response from Pakistan. If the expedition materialises, it will be a historic occasion.

 K2, also known as Mt Godwin-Austin, is one of the most treacherous peaks in the world.

 Mukherjee said the Centre has decided to institute a prize for lifetime achievement in mountaineering. It will be called the Tenzing Norgay International Mountaineering Award.

 The award will be a prize of Rs 1 lakh and a citation, said Mukherjee. Mountaineers from across the world will be eligible for the prize.

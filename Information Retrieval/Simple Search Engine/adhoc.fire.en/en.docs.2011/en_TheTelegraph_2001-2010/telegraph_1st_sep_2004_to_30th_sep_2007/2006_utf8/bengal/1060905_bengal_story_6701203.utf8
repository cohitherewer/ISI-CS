 Grandfather arrested over lover suicide

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Suri, Sept. 4: The family of the 20-year-old boy who apparently hanged himself along with his girlfriend filed an FIR today accusing her family of murder. Her mother and grandfather have been taken into custody.

 Baban Bagdi died, though 18-year-old Mousumi Hazra survived the suicide bid. 

 A mob of some 500 people led by his brother attacked her house yesterday alleging foul play.

 In the FIR, Babans brother Sudhir accused five persons of killing him in cold blood, including Mousumi. The others named were her father Sujit, mother Mona, cousin Nirmal and grandfather Shasti. We have arrested Shasti and Mona. Sujit and Nirmal are absconding. Mousumi is still in a serious condition in hospital, said Birbhum superintendent of police S.S. Panda. All five have been charged with murder.

 Police said Mousumi, the daughter of an affluent businessman, and Baban, a dailywagers son, were found hanging together from a ceiling fan in her house on the outskirts of Suri town on Saturday night. Both were taken to the Suri Sadar Hospital, where Baban was declared dead. 

 The girl regained consciousness late last night but is still said to be in a daze. She has not spoken since. She is still in trauma. Weve taken her off oxygen and are giving her intravenous fluids, a doctor said. 

 Mousumis uncles were in the hospital through the day. None of them was willing to speak, though. 

 We are shocked at the turn of events. Please excuse us, said a relative.

 After the news of Babans death spread, a mob armed with bamboo sticks and iron rods tried to bring down a wall and storm the Hazras house yesterday. About 15 people, including her grandparents, had locked themselves inside. The police fired in the air and wielded the baton to disperse the mob.

 Six people were arrested. A case against about 250 people involved in the attack was started today. 

 Tension mounted in Tilpara, about 230 km from Calcutta, again today as the neighbourhood learnt about Shasti and Monas arrest. The two were produced in the chief judicial magistrates court and remanded in a fortnights judicial custody. 

 A police picket has been posted in front of Mousumis house. Babans body has been sent to Burdwan Medical College and Hospital for post-mortem.

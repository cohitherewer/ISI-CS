The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Frankfurt flight

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Dec. 2: Lufthansas first Frankfurt-Calcutta flight touched down at the Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport today.

 With the launch of the thrice-a-week service, India became the only country in Lufthansas Asia-Pacific network to be served by six gateways.

 Lufthansa will fly from Calcutta every Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. On Tuesday, it will leave at 5.10 am, and on the other two days at 3 am. The German airline is operating the route with an Airbus A340-300, which has 221 seats eight in first class, 48 in business class and 165 in economy. 

 According to officials, Bengali cuisine would be served on the flight from March next year. We are in talks with the Taj group of hotels. Although Indian food is served, we want to add regional flavours, said Werner Heesen, Lufthansas general manager, passenger sales, India, and director (South Asia).

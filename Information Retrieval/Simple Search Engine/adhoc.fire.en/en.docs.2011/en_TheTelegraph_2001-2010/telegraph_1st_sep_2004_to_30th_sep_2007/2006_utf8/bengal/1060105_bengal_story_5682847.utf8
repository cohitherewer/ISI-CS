 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, Jan. 4: The state election department has slapped show-cause notices on 14 government officials for procedural lapses in the distribution of Electoral Photo Identity Cards.

 The move follows a directive from the Election Commission, which had asked the Chief Electoral Officer to take action against the officials for irregularities in distributing cards in three blocks in Murshidabad, Malda and Birbhum.

 Further action will be taken depending on their response to the notice, said CEO Debashish Sen. 

 The poll panel said the identity cards had been distributed in a casual manner and in violation of guidelines. 

 Burdwan: The health and family welfare standing committee has pulled up the Burdwan Medical College and Hospital for lack of coordination between its administration and staff, which has affected the quality of treatment. For the last one month, there have been repeated allegations of children dying in the hospital because of medical negligence. 

 Barasat: Nearly 400 students of Vivekananda College at Madhyamgram have been boycotting the Part-I and Part-II examinations for the last three days to protest the alleged anomalies in the funds provided by the University Grants Commission. Biplab Mukherjee, the teacher-in-charge of the examinations, resigned on Wednesday.

 Calcutta: A youth from Kakdwip in South 24-Parganas was arrested on Wednesday for allegedly refusing to marry a girl. Police said the girl had filed a complaint against Narayan Bhandari, 27, saying he had gone back on his promise to marry her after they had a two-year affair. Bhandari, however, denied it.

 Calcutta: Traffic sergeant Snehasish Dutta was injured on Wednesday when his scooter skidded off the road ? on the Park Street-Wood Street crossing ? and fell into a ditch. He was taken to a nursing home. Police said Das was on his way home when the accident took place.

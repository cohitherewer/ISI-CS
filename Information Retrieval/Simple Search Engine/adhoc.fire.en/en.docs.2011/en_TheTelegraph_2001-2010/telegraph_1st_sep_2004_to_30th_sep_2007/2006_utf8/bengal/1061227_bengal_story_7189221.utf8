The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Allies offer to broker peace

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Calcutta, Dec. 26: The CPMs allies today said they were ready to speak to Mamata Banerjee to find an end to the impasse she has created if Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and Biman Bose allow them. 

 The allies also want Bose to convene a Left Front meeting so that all the partners can be consulted on the course of action. 

 CPM leaders held several rounds of meeting at Alimuddin Street today but kept mum on their outcome. The chief minister has to apparently decide the course of action.

 The CPM has not discussed any formula with us so far. We request (front chairman) Bose to call a meeting at the earliest. If we are asked to broker peace, we will try. After all, we are also responsible for any fallout of a government decision, water resources minister and CPI leader Nandagopal Bhattacharya said. 

 The RSPs Kshiti Goswami iterated his partys demand for an all-party legislators committee. As the government is confident that a meagre amount of land was acquired without consent, the probe would have convinced the public about the truth.

 The CPI too had asked for the all-party panel during talks with the CPM. 

 The Forward Bloc said it approves of the idea. But it also wants the prohibitory orders lifted in Singur.

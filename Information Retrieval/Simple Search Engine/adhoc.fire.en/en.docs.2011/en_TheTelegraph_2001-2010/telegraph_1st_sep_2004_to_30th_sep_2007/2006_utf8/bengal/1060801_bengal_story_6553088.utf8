 Bagmundi, July 31: Arundhati Ghoshs family has accepted she is dead, but wont believe that she was killed in an accident.

 We strongly feel Arundhatis disappearance is not a fallout of an accident triggered by a flash flood in the Sobha. There is more to it than meets the eye, said Samir Ghosh, her elder brother.

 Arundhati was part of a group of Jadavpur University students who had gone trekking to Purulias Ayodhya Hills. 

 Two of them ? Subhankar Saha and Swati Das ? died after the entire group was swept away by the Sobha on Friday night. Their bodies were found at least 30 feet off the banks of the mountain stream at the foot of the Ayodhya Hills on Saturday. Bappaditya Chatterjee and Kaushik Sarkhel survived, while Arundhati went missing.

 Today, both police and Arundhatis family said they had lost hope of her survival. I know my sister is no more. But we are not ready to accept the statements of Bappaditya and Kaushik that it was an accident. Although we havent lodged any formal complaint, we raised the matter with senior police officers, Samir said. 

 Several questions are gnawing at Arundhatis brother-in-law Kaushik Dutta, who has been in Bagmundi since yesterday morning. We are wondering if the sudden flash flood was strong enough to kill Swati and Subhankar. How is it that Bappaditya and Kaushik escaped with minor injuries that did not even require treatment at the local health centre? Besides, why was Swatis body without any clothes? Strong currents may have ripped off her track-suit bottoms, but where is her T-shirt? he asked.

 Samir said a police complaint would be lodged soon. We are waiting for her body.

 Deputy superintendent of police (headquarters) Satyanarayan Banerjee said that before leaving for Calcutta, Swatis relatives, too, had alleged foul play. We have taken it seriously and are probing all possible angles, he said.

 Swati was cremated at Ratan Babu Ghat in north Calcutta this evening.

 Samir and Kaushik Dutta today joined about 40 people, including villagers and members of various mountaineering clubs, to look for Arundhatis body. Led by the officer-in-charge of Bagmundi police station, they scoured the banks of the Sobha all day. 

 We know she is not alive. We are looking for her body. Whenever I get a stench from a bush, I run towards it expecting that my sister is lying there, wept Samir, squatting on the sandy riverbank.

 Police have decided not to carry out random searches any more. We will now search on the basis of specific information, the DSP said.

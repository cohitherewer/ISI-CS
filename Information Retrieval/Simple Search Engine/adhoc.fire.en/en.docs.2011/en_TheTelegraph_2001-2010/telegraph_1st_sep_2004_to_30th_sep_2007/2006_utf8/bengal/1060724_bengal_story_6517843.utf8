 Burdwan, IIT way

 ABHIJEET CHATTERJEE

 Burdwan July 23: A 400-year-old town, now far from the air of aspiration enveloping Calcutta and its neighbourhood, is getting ready for the gap to close.

 IIT Kharagpur will pilot the transition of the decrepit district borough, Burdwan, which till the other day took over three hours to reach from Calcutta. 

 A flyover, a ring road, an underpass, two modern terminals for long-distance buses, a truck terminus, decked-up traffic intersections, spruced-up tourist destinations and upgraded water supply and drainage networks form part of the Rs 1,000-crore plan drawn up by the IITs architecture and regional planning department.

 Assigned by the Burdwan Development Authority to prepare a perspective plan, the IIT submitted last month a draft of its proposals to chairman Nirupam Sen, also the commerce and industries minister.

 Work on the projects is expected to begin early next year and take seven years to complete.

 Durgapur Expressway had cut down the travel time from Calcutta to Burdwan. The second Vivekananda Bridge across the Hooghly, on the northern fringes of Calcutta, which should be ready by 2007, would bring the town, 90 km from Calcutta, within an hours drive from the city, Sen said. 

 So the narrow roads, chaos and congestion have to give way for the town to be party to the drive for development all around. 

 Officials of the authority said three projects 40 to 50 km from Burdwan have triggered a manifold increase in demand for space there. The Indonesia-based Salim Group is building a city at Bankra in West Howrah, while Delhi-based real estate company DLF has won the contract to develop a township at Dankuni in Hooghly.

 With the superfast access from Calcutta, people are expected to shift base to the town and its fringes, added Sen.

 According to the IIT study, the population in the town ? about 400,000 now ? is likely to double in 20 years. To cope with the rush, housing projects to accommodate at least 65,000 families have to be built. 

 Everyday, about 60,000 people come to the town, which has a university, a medical college and a court, besides dozens of other offices, an authority official said.

 A Rs 500-crore twin township, wayside shopping malls and a Rs 600-crore health city are slated to be built at Kamranga and Goda on the northern outskirts of the town.

 The development authority for the Asansol-Durgapur industrial belt, in Burdwan district, had earlier ordered a similar IIT study. The Centre has agreed to include the Rs 1,529-crore project designed by the IIT in its National Urban Renewal Mission. 

 B.K. Sengupta, the head of the architecture and regional planning department, led the IIT team that prepared the Burdwan plan.

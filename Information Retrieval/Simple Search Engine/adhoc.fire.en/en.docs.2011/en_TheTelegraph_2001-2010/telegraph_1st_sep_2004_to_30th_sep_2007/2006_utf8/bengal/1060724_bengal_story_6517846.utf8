 Chinsurah/Calcutta, July 23: A fresh batch of 480 farmers today pledged 165 acres for Tata Motors small-car manufacturing unit at a convention organised by the CPM peasants wing at Singur.

 On June 29, 324 farmers had submitted consent letters to block development officer Abhijit Mukherjee, agreeing to give up about 320 acres.

 The Tatas have sought some 1,250 acres at Singur, about 40 km from Calcutta.

 Mamata Banerjee was there on Tuesday, planting aman paddy saplings and leading farmers who do not want to part with their land. 

 Today, she was doing the same at Bhangar in South 24-Parganas, where the government is set to acquire land for development projects. 

 Higher education minister Sudarshan Roy Choudhury, the legislator from Jangipara in Hooghly, was the main speaker at the CPM convention in Singurs Berubari block. Local party MP Rupchand Pal was also present. 

 Farmers present here should fan out to each and every block of Hooghly to inspire those still unwilling to part with their land to do so. We must graduate from agriculture to industry, he told the gathering. 

 The Trinamul (Congress) leader is misguiding some farmers, who have launched a movement under the banner of the Krishi Jomi Banchao (Save Farmland) Committee. We have to tell these farmers that industries are the need of the hour and we have to set them up even on agricultural land, he added.

 Did Mamata forget that the Durgapur Expressway on which she travelled to Singur with much fanfare last week was once constructed on vast tracts of agricultural land? he asked.

 Mamata, though, was undeterred. About 40 km south of Calcutta, she announced the formation of the Krishak Sangram Committee to counter the acquisition of farmland for industry.

 The Salim Group will need around 250 acres across eight mouzas of Bhangar for a 100-km expressway from Barasat in North 24-Parganas to Raichak in south.

 Flood food with Puja funds

 OUR BUREAU

 Sept. 29: Puja organisers in a little Murshidabad village have done what their far richer counterparts have not use their festival subscription to help flood victims.

 Nazirpur could not have worshipped idols this year as the cement dais on which they were to be seated is still under water. But to provide meals to people whose houses are submerged and valuables lost is as good as doing a Puja, though without the pomp surrounding it elsewhere.

 When the floods struck the village of 200 families, 270 km from Calcutta, the idols were almost ready. So, the organisers paid Rs 1,500 to the clay modellers. On the day of Mahalaya, people started deserting their homes and gathering on national highway 34. That day, we decided to use the Rs 6,000 collected as chanda to provide food to the victims, said Dwipen Mondal, the Puja secretary.

 The women from houses spared by the flood have been taking turns to cook for the past three days. We are trying to ensure that the khichudi and sabzi taste like home food, said Ratna Mondal. 

 The administration in South 24-Parganas needed the chief ministers prodding today to ensure supply of relief on a war footing. Before the floods, the district was lashed by a storm that took 20 lives.

 At Raidighi, about 90 km from Calcutta, where Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee went to see relief work today, homeless villagers said they had only got tarpaulin sheets, not food.

 Embarrassed, he asked district magistrate Roshni Sen and the chief of the local panchayat samiti why so. See to it that no affected person goes without food, he added.

 But there could be many like Eradul Molla, Khatuna Bibi and Manjul Ali in every district ravaged by the rain.

 In Calcutta, the finance minister said the flood situa-tion in Nadia was grim because of the rising Bhagirathi, Ichhamati and Churni. Large parts of Burdwan and Howrah are still under water.

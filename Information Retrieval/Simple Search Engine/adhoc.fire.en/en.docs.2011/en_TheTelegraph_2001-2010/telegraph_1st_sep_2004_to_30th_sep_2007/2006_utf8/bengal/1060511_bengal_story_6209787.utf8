 IT classes shut over demand for placements

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, May 10: IT engineering and electronics students of Kalyani University have forced the departments shut demanding placement through campus interviews. 

 Over 200 students, past and present, squatting on the campus for the past three days have virtually taken over the three-storey building housing the two departments. 

 The university started the two undergraduate courses five years ago and the first batch of 40 students each from the two departments graduated last year.

 Most of those who graduated are jobless as the university failed to bring the industries to the campus for interviews and recruitment. We are worried to see our seniors without jobs. What will happen to us? asked Sritikona Barui, a first-year student of IT engineering.

 Utsav Dutta, who passed IT engineering last year, said the university authorities and faculty members had promised recruitment through campus interviews. But in reality, there were no jobs for us when we graduated. We even went to some of the industries on our own but most of them dont even know that Kalyani University runs such courses, said Dutta. 

 Registrar Utpal Bhattacharya said no promise of campus interviews or placements was made to the students. We did not guarantee any placement at the time of admission. Ear- lier, we used to offer diplomas for the two courses. We upgraded them to undergraduate courses five years ago. Well organise campus interviews gradually, Bhattacharya said.

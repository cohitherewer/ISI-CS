The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Dunlop dues deadlock broken

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 5: Pawan Ruia declared at Writers Buildings today that Dunlop tyres will start rolling again by the end of September. 

 Representatives of Citu, Intuc and the new management of the Sahagunj unit today met labour minister Mrinal Banerjee and sorted out problems over the payment of dues.

 After the meeting, the minister said the management and the unions have come to an understanding about the amount to be paid as back wages to the workers in the first instalment. 

 The company will pay Rs 2.25 crore in the first phase. About 1,179 workers will be employed as permanent and 1,452 will be offered early retirement scheme (ERS).

 Any worker who has worked at least for a day when the company was closed, will get Rs 2,770 in the first instalment. Those who have worked over a month will be paid Rs 5,000. The payment will be made from June 20 onwards, Banerjee said.

 Maintenance work at the factory will start tomorrow. 

 Some of the issues are yet to be sorted out, though. 

 The dispute over the calculation of the workers attendance persists, though the management feels it will not pose any problem in the payment of the first instalment of back wages. 

 The attendance problem will not be an issue, Ruia (in picture above) said. We will later sit with both the unions to sort out the problems over the calculation of the attendance. 

 Dunlop, closed since 2001, got a new lease of life when Ruia took it over earlier this year. 

 But differences between the management and the unions, which cropped up after a deal on dues was signed this April, stalled the process to reopen the plant.

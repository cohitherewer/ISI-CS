The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Ladies set for border debut

 RABI BANERJEE AND ALAMGIR HOSSAIN

 Krishnagar/Behrampore, Sept. 10: The Border Security Force is going to deploy women for the first time on the Bangladesh border. 

 BSF authorities in charge of the 4,100-km boundary had sent a proposal two months ago seeking recruitment of lady constables in view of the growing number of women involved in border crimes, particularly smuggling and girl running.

 The BSF now has women working only in clerical posts. 

 The Centre has agreed to our proposal in principle. We expect a formal approval any day, said Damodar Sarengi, the additional director-general of the BSF, (eastern region).

 He said once the formal nod comes, the recruitment process will start.

 The situation on the Bangladesh border is changing and so creation of a womens force is necessary, Sarengi said. 

 Somesh Goyal, the inspector-general of the BSFs south Bengal frontier, said jawans are charged with rape whenever they catch hold of women smugglers. 

 Our jawans are also accused of excesses when they catch women or little boys involved in smuggling across the border. If the jawans are always tense while dealing with women, how will they work? he asked. 

 According to BSF statistics, at least 10 jawans have been booked in the state over the past two years on charges of molesting women and beating up little boys on the border. 

 Officials said in most of these cases, the jawans were only performing their duties and were falsely implicated. 

 The women are engaged in sugar and medicine smuggling and children are used for narcotics, said Goyal. 

 Goyal said the force had earlier asked the local police to provide some women constables to assist their jawans.

 But they refused. So, we have proposed to director general of BSF to at least provide some women constables on deputation from other forces like Central Reserve Police Force. We need a womens force urgently, said the IG. 

 The IG said that the women constables would be looked after properly.

 Special houses would be 

 constructed for them at each battalion. The women in the 

 force will not be sent to border outposts. They will be 

 called from nearest battalion whenever required, added 

 the officer.

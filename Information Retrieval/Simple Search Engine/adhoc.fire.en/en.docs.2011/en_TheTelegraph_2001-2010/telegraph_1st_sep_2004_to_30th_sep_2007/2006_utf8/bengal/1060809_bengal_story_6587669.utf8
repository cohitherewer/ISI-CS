The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Scanner on Pepsi seed

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 8: Krishak Sabha, the CPM peasants wing, has charged PepsiCo with supplying diseased seeds to farmers for growing potatoes at its Frito Lay factory.

 Agriculture minister Naren De has convened a meeting of experts on August 28 to seek their opinion.

 According to the minister, farmers growing potatoes for PepsiCos Frito Lay factory at Sankrail have been given the Atlantic variety of seeds, which are imported.

 A report from the Central Potato Research Station of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, Shimla, states that the Atlantic seeds have been known to cause wotan infectious disease which also affects the quality of the soil, De said. He added that this disease has been known to spread in hilly regions.

 Krishak Sabha, which is opposed to contract farming, has repeatedly attacked the multinational ever since it set up shop in the state.

 PepsiCo has denied the allegation. PepsiCo India has been working closely with the agriculture and horticulture departments of West Bengal towards potato cultivation with Atlantic (seed variety) in the plains of the state. We have recorded success consistently in the region, said a Frito Lay spokesperson from Delhi.

 Cola tests

 The state government has decided to send samples of Pepsi and Coca-Cola for tests in the wake of the new round of the pesticide controversy.

 Samples have been sent for tests at the National Test House in Salt Lake today. 

 According to De, no laboratory in the state is equipped to test pesticide content, barring the Salt Lake facility and another private laboratory on Diamond Harbour Road.

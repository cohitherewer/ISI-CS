 BRIEFS

 Midnapore, June 7: The CBI today filed chargesheets against 13 people, including nine policemen and a homoeopath, in a West Midnapore court holding them responsible for a custody death.

 In 2004, police picked up Somendu Mandal, 27, from his house in Debra, about 120 km from Calcutta, in connection with a dacoity. Days later, the Debra police station said Mandal, a grocer, had been taken to Kharagpur, where his family was told that he died after he jumped off a police jeep and tried to escape. His mother Biva moved the high court alleging her son was killed in the lock-up. Last month, the CBI arrested an assistant sub-inspector, three constables and the homoeopath. In the chargesheet, it has also named five other policemen. 

 Calcutta: Barry Brien has been nominated by the state government as the MLA representing the Anglo-Indian community. He replaces Gilian DCosta Hart. Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had recommended Barrys name. 

 Suri: An armed gang robbed a passenger of Rs 1 lakh, two gold rings and a mobile phone on a Rampurhat-bound local on Tuesday night. Police said the dacoits knew the paddy trader, Usman Gani, would be on the train. They struck when the train from Burdwan was about to reach Tarapith Road station.

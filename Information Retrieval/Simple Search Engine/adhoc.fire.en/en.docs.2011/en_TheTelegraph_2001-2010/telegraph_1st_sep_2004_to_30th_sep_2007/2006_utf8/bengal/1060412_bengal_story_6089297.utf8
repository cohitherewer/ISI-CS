The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 BRIEFS

Poster rekha

Haringhata: Poor Gorachand Mandal! He either forgot to take 

the measuring tape with him or thought everybody can do a Subhas Chakraborty on 

the all mighty Election Commission.

 The Independent candidate contesting from Nadias Haringhata has been arrested for putting up posters within 200 metres of polling booths. The Lakshmanrekha is drawn by the commission and anybody crossing it is liable to be arrested.

 The commissions expenditure observer for Kalyani, Benoy Kumar, was doing the rounds when he stumbled on Mandal and two others at work with the posters. Mandal was held but the others ? one of them is his son ? were spared.

Calcutta: A helicopter flew all the way to Pingla in West 

Midnapore to pick up Congress heavyweights Pranab Mukherjee and Margaret Alva 

but the pilot had to be content with an aerial view of the place. He was also 

refused permit to land at Bishnupur in Bankura, 250 km from Calcutta, because 

of lack of facilities. A Kharagpur police officer said the pilot did not land 

at Pingla, though we tried to help him, but the Congress has complained 

to the poll panel. The chopper touched ground at Jhalda in Purulia, about 375 

km away. The duo had a smooth ride home but, by then, they had to travel a few 

hundred ki- lometres by road. That ensures direct contact with voters, some may 

say, but whos listening?

 Calcutta: Residents of the Regent Park area woke up to kirtans on Tuesday. It took them some time to realise that the 50-odd men in red T-shirts were chanting a different hymn ? in praise of chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. Krishi amader bhitti, shilpa amader bhabishyat (Agriculture is our base, industry our future) ? a slogan that lost currency after the EC banned posters and ban- ners, made it to the lyrics.

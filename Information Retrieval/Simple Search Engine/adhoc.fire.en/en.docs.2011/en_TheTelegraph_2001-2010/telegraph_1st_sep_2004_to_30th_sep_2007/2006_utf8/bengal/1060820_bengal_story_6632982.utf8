The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Terror helping hands held

 Calcutta, Aug. 19: The CID today arrested four persons who had helped two members of the Jaish-e-Mohammad sneak into India on Independence Day eve, says a staff reporter.

 They were picked up from the Charalkhali and Kanaikati areas of Basirhat in North 24-Parganas near the Bangladesh border.

 Nimai Joardar, Santosh Joardar, Nathu Gharami and Ranjit Mandal had ferried Mohammad Zuber and Mohammad Sohail on their boats, police said. They ply boats across the Ichhamati and sometimes help Bangladeshi nationals sneak into India in exchange of money, said an officer.

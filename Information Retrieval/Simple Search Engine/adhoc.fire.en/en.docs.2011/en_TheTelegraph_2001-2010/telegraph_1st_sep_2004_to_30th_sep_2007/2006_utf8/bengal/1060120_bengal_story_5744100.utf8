The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Nathu-la

 Calcutta, Jan. 19: China is planning a railway route connecting Lhasa in Tibet to Nathu-la in Sikkim, the Chinese ambassador to India, Sun Yuxi, said today.

 Sun, who is in the city to attend the CII partnership summit, called on chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and discussed trade prospects between his country and Bengal. 

 He said the reopening of Nathu-La by June this year would open the floodgates of commerce.

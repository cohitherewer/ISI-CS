The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 From power centre to a powerless pocket

 ANINDYA SENGUPTA

 Gopiballavpur, April 12: The governments voice in the courtroom must have fallen silent when he came to know Gopiballavpur, from where the CPM wanted him to contest for a seat in the Assembly. 

 From the heart of the city to villages lit by lanterns after sundown must have been a steep climbdown for the governments pleader in the high court, Rabilal Moitra. 

 Theres democracy in the land of the deprived ? a CPM zonal leader in this pocket of West Midnapore, some 200 km from Calcutta, lives in the same darkness as an ordinary voter.

 Having seen the plight of the local leader, Moitra ? who could well be bragging about the power situation in Bengal sitting in Calcutta ? has decided to put rural electrification high on his agenda if voted to power.

 The zonal committee secretary of Sankrail is a powerful man. Anybody in the village is only too eager to show the way to Satyen Beras house, but his six-year-old home is powerless.

 Moitra, new to the area, said it is shocking, but promised to make a difference.

 Electric poles had been constructed and lines laid but transformers could not be installed in all these years. 

 It is not that. The power development corporation did start work. It had to stop because of the polls. Dont worry, said Bera.

 But Moitra knows there is reason to worry. Wherever I go, I hear about electricity problems. 

 Roads and water do not pose as much problem in places like Aandhari, Kharbandi and Topsia. 

 Villagers, heavily into agriculture ? not many alternatives are available ? said the yield is good. 

 Hashi Koyal, the wife of a tiller at Kharbandi, said her family had enough to sell last year after keeping enough at home. 

 Sanatan Dhol, who grows watermelons, said: We make a reasonable profit every year. What we do not have is a proper health facility.

 Most villages in Gopiballavpur do not have easy access to primary health centres. From Bishnupur, for example, patients have to travel 12-16 km to make it to hospitals at Bhangra, Patra or Kultigiri. 

 Ashok Bera, a farmer, said doctors and medicines are not always available there. 

 There are a few hundred primary schools, which are teeming with children primarily because of the mid-day meal scheme.

 The hot bed of the 70s Naxalite movement, however, has no trace of the Maoists in 2006. In the last elections, the same Santosh Rana who had once led the rebel frenzy won 1.03 per cent votes as an Independent. 

 The CPM, confident of retaining the seat, roped in outsider Moitra probably because it wants him to succeed law minister Nisith Adhikary, who was denied nomination from Burdwan North. 

 Please do not ask me why I was fielded here, Moitra said. I came to know about my nomination after the Left Front list was announced.

 The CPM candidate had won Gopiballavpur by a margin of nearly 40,000 votes in 2001. Neither Trinamul nor Congress has a base in this Assembly seat. And there is hardly any sign of an Oppos-ition effort to wrest the seat.

 Moitra, too, thinks there is no reason to worry ? political power is easier to get than the kind transmitted through wires.

 He is an outsider, said Swapan Majhi of Rohini. He added in the same breath: Im not a CPM supporter. 

 Anyway, theres no one else, said Bipin Paik, a grocer in Topsia village.

 Moitra admitted that he would not be able to visit his constituency every week, but the party is there to take care of peoples problems.

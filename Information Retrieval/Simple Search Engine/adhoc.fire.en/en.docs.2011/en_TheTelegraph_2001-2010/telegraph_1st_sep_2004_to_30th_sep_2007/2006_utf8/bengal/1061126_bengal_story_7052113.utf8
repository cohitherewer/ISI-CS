The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Mamata potato protest

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Nov. 25: Mamata Banerjee today warned the state government that there would be bloodshed if attempts were made to forcibly take away land for Tata Motors small car project at Singur in Hooghly district. 

 There will be bloodshed if the land is forcibly taken away for the Tatas by CPM. I will fight the land-grabbers with my life, she told a hurriedly convened news conference at Trinamul Bhavan.

 Mamata, who was scheduled to visit Singur this afternoon to lead a demonstration there, changed her mind on hearing that Tata Motors managing director Ravi Kant was on a days visit to the city. 

 I have information that over 50,000 policemen from various parts of the state, including north Bengal, have been mobilised at Singur for work on barbed wire fencing around the acquired land. But I will go there tomorrow to sow potato seeds, come what may, Mamata said, adding: Singur will turn bloody if farmers are deprived of their land, their only source of livelihood.

 The Trinamul leader blasted the government for turning Singur into a fortress by sending policemen from across the state. If the land is already acquired, why has the administration deployed 50,000 policemen to protect it? she asked.

 Mamata will go to Sanapara in Singurs Gopalnagar, around 40 km from Calcutta, tomorrow to sow potato seeds on a five-cottah tract where she had gone in August to plant aman paddy. 

 The Hooghly district administration has so far acquired 927 acres out of the 993 required for the Tata project. Harvesting has already begun on Singur land. 

 Mamata also alleged that the chief minister had misled the Assembly by telling lies about the land acquired at Singur. In fact, not more than 550 acres could be acquired. However, the chief minister claimed that 913 acres have been vested so far at Singur. This is a blatant lie, she said.

 According to her, the Trinamul legislature party is discussing if a privilege motion can be tabled against the chief minister. 

 Mamata said the chief minister is hell-bent on getting the Tata project through in Singur just to satisfy his ego. But we cant allow a disaster to happen in Singur just to satisfy a persons ego.

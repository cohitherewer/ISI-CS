 Pranab says no to pact

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Aug. 20: Pranab Mukherjee today ruled out any truck with Mamata Banerjee for the byelection to the Malda Lok Sabha seat, which fell vacant with the death of Ghani Khan Chowdhury. 

 Veteran Congress leader Ghani Khan was known to be close to the Trinamul Congress chief and speculation was rife that Mamata would not field a candidate on his turf, like she hadnt during the last Lok Sabha elections. 

 But defence minister Mukherjee tried to distance the Congress from any move that could be seen as aligning with Trinamul, a BJP ally. The Congress will fight the byelection independently, Mukherjee said at the state party office here this morning. 

 How can we tie up with Mamata when the Trinamul Congress is still a constituent of the NDA? he asked.

 Two other Lok Sabha constituencies Purulia and Katwa and the Bongaon Assembly constituency will also go to polls on September 16.

 A section of the Congress was hopeful of a pact with Mamata after she told associates that her party might not put up a candidate in Malda as a mark of respect for the late Ghani Khan. His brother Abu Hashem Khan Chowdhury is being considered a Congress nominee for the seat. 

 Mamatas meeting with Das Munshi in the Parliament lobby last week had brightened the prospect of the two parties coming together, at least in Malda, a source said. Das Munshi loyalists, including former mayor Subrata Mukherjee, had discussed such a scenario among themselves. 

 But things are back to square one now. Pranabda has made it clear that there will be no adjustment with Trinamul. Mamata was against putting up her candidate in Malda because of her relationship with Barkatda, a key Congress functionary said. 

 A former Trinamul legislator also confirmed that Mamata had expressed her desire not to field a candidate on Ghani Khans turf. 

 Barkatda had publicly backed Mamata when she called the Congress to join forces with her.

 The Trinamul chief has called a meeting of her parliamentary unit on Thursday to discuss the names of party nominees for the Lok Sabha seats. 

 Observers said the task may not be easy as the party hardly has any presence in the three Lok Sabha segments. While Malda is a traditional Congress bastion, Purulia and Katwa are Left strongholds.

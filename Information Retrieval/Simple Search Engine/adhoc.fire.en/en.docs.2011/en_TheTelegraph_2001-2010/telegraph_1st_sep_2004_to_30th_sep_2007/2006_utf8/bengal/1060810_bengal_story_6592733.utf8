 BRIEFS

 Bolpur, Aug. 9: Birbhum police today lod- ged an FIR and started a probe into a police station officer-in-charges alleged rape of a constables daughter.

 On July 31, the girl from Nanoor, 230 km from Calcutta, told the Bolpur additional chief judicial magistrate that Swargajit Bose, the OC of Sadaipur police sta- tion, had raped her over the past two years promising to marry her when she would turn 18. 

 Calcutta: The education department had issued approval to a school in Ranigunj, 220 km from Calcutta, two years before it had even constructed its building. High court Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurkar stumbled on the fact while hearing a case related to Ranishayar Vidyapith.

 Calcutta: Police detained Tushar Kole, a CPM local committee member of Garbeta, on Wednesday night for allegedly plotting the murder of his wife and son. Nirupama and Manas, 27, went missing on Tuesday. They were found dead a day later.

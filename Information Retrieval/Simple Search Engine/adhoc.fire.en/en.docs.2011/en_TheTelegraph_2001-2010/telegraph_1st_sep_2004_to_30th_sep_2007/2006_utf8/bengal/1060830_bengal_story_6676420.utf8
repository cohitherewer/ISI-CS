The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Pay fury at Writers

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 29: Employees clamouring for dearness allowance (DA) and a pre-Puja bonus stayed off their desks, disrupting work at Writers Buildings and throwing chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees do-it-now drive out of gear for much of the day.

 Most of the 4,000-odd employees did not get to work until 2.30 pm, when agitators called it a day, participating in dharnas since 10.30 am.

 They were demanding immediate disbursement of outstanding DA, inclusion of 50 per cent DA in the pay, besides an across-the-board 8.33 per cent bonus.

 We also want employment for dependants of employees who die in harness, said Samir Ranjan Majumdar, general secretary of the West Bengal Government Employees Union (Nabaparjay).

 The agitation was organised by Naba- parjay, the West Bengal Secretariat Personal Assistants Association and the Mahakaran Sangram Committee. 

 The government has announced two instalments of DA this year, but employees here still get 16 per cent less than their counterparts in central government offices. Payment of the outstanding DA will cost the state Rs 800 crore, the chief minister has said. Last year, a pre-Puja bonus of Rs 1,000 was given, but only to those whose gross salary was less than Rs 8,000. 

 We tried to submit a copy of our demands to the chief ministers office, but its officers refused to entertain us, said Bibhas Ghosh, secretary of the PA Association. 

 Employees accused police of beating them up. The attack was without provocation. The police didnt even spare the women. Many have been injured, alleged Shyamal Mitra of the Mahakaran Sangram Committee. 

 Deputy commissioner (headquarters) P.K. Chatterjee said the protesters turned violent on one occasion and had a scuffle with the police.

 The employees will organise a pratibad michhil (protest rally) on Wednesday afternoon.

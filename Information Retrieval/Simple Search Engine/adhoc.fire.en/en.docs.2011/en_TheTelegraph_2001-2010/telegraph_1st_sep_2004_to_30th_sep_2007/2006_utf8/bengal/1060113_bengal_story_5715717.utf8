The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Buddha lesson for labour

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Durgapur, Jan. 12: Buddhadeb 

 Bhattacharjee today asked administrative agencies to deal 

 firmly with workers unrest if it was found hampering 

 investment in an industrial unit. Dont look 

 at party affiliation, he said.

 In a veiled criticism of the CPMs labour wing Citu, with which he came into conflict in the recent past on the approach to be adopted on workers issues, Bhattacharjee said the workers would have to recognise that industrialists are behind the betterment and prosperity of a state.

 The survival of industry is essential to the survival of workers, he added.

 Industrialists are behind the betterment and prosperity of any state ? a fact we understand and acknowledge. Its time now for workers to learn this for their sake. So, dont harm the recent industry boom here, Bhattacharjee said at the inauguration of a Rs 170-crore expansion programme of Graphite India Ltd here, 220 km from Calcutta.

 Its a very competitive market. Quality, productivity and competition is not the headache of the industry owners alone. Workers have to be accountable for this, the chief minister added, hinting at discouraging militant trade unionism and encouraging work culture.

 At the inauguration of Birla Corporations Durgapur Cement Works, he said: Were lagging behind in industrialisation. Many states are ahead of us. We have to run fast to catch up with them.

 The chief minister came down heavily on health sector workers. Slogan shouting, unionism and strikes will not be tolerated in government hospitals and private nursing homes. Doctors should render service accordingly and (health) workers also have to work efficiently, he said.

 He expressed anxiety over the fate of public sector enterprises owned by the Centre.

 Alloy Steel Plant is not doing well though I have learnt that the Steel Authority of India is going to invest hugely in its upgrade. Another giant company, MAMC, is closed. I have spoken with Union heavy industries minister Santosh Mohan Dev recently. He is trying hard to revive the company with help from the private sector, Bhattacharjee said.

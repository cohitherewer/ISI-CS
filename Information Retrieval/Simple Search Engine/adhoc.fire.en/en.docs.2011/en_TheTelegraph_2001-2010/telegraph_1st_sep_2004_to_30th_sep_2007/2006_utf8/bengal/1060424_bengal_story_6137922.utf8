The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Big boys in the bull ring

Mentor amp; tormentor crossing swords

 SUDESHNA BANERJEE

 Calcutta, April 23: A giant football to men on stilts and minibuses, rickshaw flaps to hammer-and-sickle T-shirts ? Subhas Chakrabortys messages are on the move everywhere in Belgachhia East.

 The six-time MLA has a lot of ground to cover, Belgachhia East being the biggest constituency ? from Salt Lake in the east to Belgachhia Metro sta-tion in the south-west, Dum Dum station in the west to Nagerbazar in the north.

 In the countdown to D-day, the transport and sports ministers convoy is racing against time. The mornings are reserved for door-to-door tours (by car in Salt Lake and Lake Town and on foot in Belgachhia and Dum Dum). From late afternoon, he is chairing street-corner meetings ? six to seven a day.

 The distances are big and the 2.74 lakh voters (pruned by the EC from 2.92 lakh) diverse. 

 In Chakrabortys estimate, close to a lakh voters are non-Bengalis ? from the labour class to the well-heeled north Indians. 

 The rich do not vote for us, says the poll veteran, du-ring lunch at home in Salt Lakes FD Block. 

 District party colleague Amitava Nandy ? back by the ministers side after the alleged sabotage phase ? elabo- rates: The people of Salt Lake are such that when our boys knock on their door, they say, lagbe na (dont need) and slam it shut as if we are sales representatives.

 The rest, in Chakrabortys estimate, add up to 1.6 lakh voters. A sizeable section is in Dum Dum, where he grew up and where he trailed his aide-turned-rival Sujit Bose in the last elections. 

 Chakraborty admits not all was well in the party then and insists that the problems have been sorted out. 

 But he has had differences with the chief minister. Un- like many CPM candidates, Chakraborty is reserved in giving credit to Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee for any change in the states image. Those wealthy were always in favour of liberalisation. Certain statements and actions of Buddhababu have had a positive impact on them, he says.

 So, will this be a vote for Brand Buddha? 

 Chakraborty says: I was the first to speak out for discipline in labour agitation, way back in 1974. Buddhababu has realised there is an air of opportunity now in industry. If workers grievances are highlighted, it will send out a negative message. That doesnt mean his call to outlaw agitation in IT can be supported. It is a hard-earned right. No worker can be robbed of it.

 Despite the hint of rift with Writers, the six-time MLA knows he is on a firmer poll pitch almost by default. Last time, there was talk of Trinamul emerging as an alternative. Now even a big fool doesnt think Mamata Banerjee will come to power.

 His opponent No. 1, Sujit Bose, used to be one of his favourites. The former CPM councillor from south Dum Dum ditched his mentor six years ago and has since risen in the Trinamul ranks. A general secretary now, he had taken the fight to the last lap in 2001, reducing the margin to 4,444.

 Its payback time, growls the Chakraborty camp.

 The Congress boys are on my side, counters Bose.

 But he has to contend with Chakrabortys organisational muscle. The actual turnout in Salt Lake is about 60 per cent. If the count crosses 70, we are in trouble for that would mean external influence, says a Trinamul councillor.

 So, whats the poll prediction at the lunch table of FD 144? I will win by 30,000 votes, smiles Chakraborty.

 The margin is the matter at Belgachhia East.

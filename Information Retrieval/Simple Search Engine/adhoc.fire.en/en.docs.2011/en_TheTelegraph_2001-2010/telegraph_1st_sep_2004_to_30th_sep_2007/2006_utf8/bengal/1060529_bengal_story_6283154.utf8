The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Boy sentenced to 300 sit-ups after rape slur

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagunge (Nadia), May 28: A village panel led by a CPM leader made an 11-year-old deaf-mute boy do 300 sit-ups for allegedly attempting to rape a minor when neither the victim nor the medical report corroborated the charge. 

 Subrata Biswas fainted minutes after completing his quota of 300. He was taken to the block hospital and shifted to Shaktinagar district hospital in Krishnagar late on Friday night after his condition deteriorated. 

 The boy has suffered extreme dehydration and is running a high temperature, a police officer said.

 The shalishi (conciliation) meeting, chaired by Sambhu Mondal, a panchayat samiti member of Kumar village, about 110 km from Calcutta, took the boy to task for the alleged rape attempt.

 The additional superintendent of Nadia, Biswarup Ghosh, said the police did not act on the attempt to rape complaint lodged by the girls father as the charge was neither confirmed by the girl nor the medical report. 

 We had a word with the 10-year-old girl, but she did not corroborate her fathers charge recorded in the FIR. She said the boy beat her on May 22, Ghosh said.

 Bablu Mondol, the girls father, had alleged that Subrata had attempted to rape his daughter and demanded his arrest, an officer of the local police station said. 

 The next day, Sambhu called the villagers and, without confirming the charges, slapped a fine of Rs 2,000 on the boys father, Judhisthir. He then punished the boy, after which he fainted and was admitted to Kumar Block Hospital. 

 He was in tears as some villagers counted the sit-ups in chorus at the courtyard of a house near the alleged victims. He returned home exhausted and collapsed there.

 When Subratas condi- tion deteriorated on Friday, Judhisthir lodged a police complaint against Sambhu and the nine others who were part of the shalishi board. 

 Sambhu admitted that the boy was punished for the alleged attempt to rape. We punished him because the girls father approached us, he said. 

 But we are not responsible for his present condition. I have nothing more to say.

 Ghosh said he would look into the allegations made by Judhisthir. I will find out what went wrong and will take action against Sambhu and his men if they are guilty, he added.

 On May 17, a court in Behrampore, Murshidabad, sentenced four members of a shalishi board to seven years imprisonment for protecting Mokkar Malithha, who was charged with murdering his wife Manowara Bibi 11 years ago.

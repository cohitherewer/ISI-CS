The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Buddha capital call for health

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 16: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today called on private players to invest in the state to ensure better health for the health sector. 

 Unveiling the public-private partnership policy for healthcare, the chief minister said his government was considering joint ventures with private companies at all levels ? block health centres to apex institutions. 

 We (the government) provide health services to 70 per cent of the population but with a yearly budget of Rs 1,700 crore, we have serious constraints. If private parties come forward, we can bridge the gap, he said. 

 In villages, we neither have ambulances at all health centres nor facilities for pathological tests. If private players come in, we can ensure these facilities at reasonable rates, Bhattacharjee said.

 Asked if the poor would be able to afford these centres, he said the government would ensure that there is no additional burden on them.

 Individual doctors as well as independent institutions will be consulted on the rates, Bhattacharjee said. In fact, costs will come down. Its better to get treated for a nominal amount than not getting admission at a hospital at all. 

 UKs department for international development (DFID) is now sponsoring the upgrade of health centres in villages and the World Bank has shown interest in funding rural healthcare, the chief minister said.

 The government is mulling setting up a medical college, a dental college and a cancer hospital under public-private partnership. 

 It is also considering a proposal for a 56,000-bed Health City with all disciplines housed in one campus. These will provide the best services in eastern India, the chief minister said. 

 But such a city could well be out of reach for most. Hospitals in the new city, Bhattacharjee said, will target those who can spend money, including patients from the neighbouring countries.

 Entrepreneurs have already shown interest in the health sector in Bengal, many of whose residents rush to south India for treatment.

 The government has received offers from overseas investors for the setting up of a trauma- care centre. 

 Delhi has proposed a Rs 40-crore cancer hospital and the Tatas will start work on their cancer unit after the government allots the 3 acres that they have asked for.

 Many private companies now provide diagnostic services such as CT Scan and MRI and even laundry facilities at government hospitals.

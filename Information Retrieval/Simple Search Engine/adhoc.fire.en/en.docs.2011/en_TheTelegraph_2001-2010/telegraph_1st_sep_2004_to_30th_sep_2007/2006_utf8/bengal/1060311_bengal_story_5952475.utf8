The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 7 days for ex-judge to leave house

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi/Calcutta, March 10: The Supreme Court today directed former Calcutta High Court judge Bhagabati Prosad Banerjee to vacate his Salt Lake house within a week. 

 A bench of Justices H.K. Sema and A.R. Lakshmanan rejected Banerjees plea to set aside the auction of the house conducted by the Bengal government on February 4 under the apex courts instructions.

 The court has asked the registry not to accept any more applications on the case without its permission and directed the state government to ensure that the house is vacated within seven days.

 While allowing PILs filed by Trinamul Congress leaders Tarak Singh and Deepak Ghosh, who challenged the allotment of the plot under the discretionary quota of then chief minister Jyoti Basu, the apex court had ordered the sale of the property.

 On November 19, 2004, it set aside the allotment of four cottahs in FD Block to the former judge and asked the state to sell the land and the building separately through a public auction. Following that order, the amount fetched by the building went to Banerjee and the price of land to the government.

 Calcutta-based businessman Pradip Kumar Murarka offered the highest bid of Rs 51 lakh ?Rs 20.5 lakh for the land and 30.5 lakh for the building. 

 But Banerjee refused to accept the amount and filed an application in the apex court urging it to cancel the auction. The market value of the house that has five bedrooms, two garages and two underground water tanks is much higher, he had contended.

 The former judge now has no option but to vacate his house in a week. Although I have protest in mind, I must honour the apex courts order. I dont know where I shall go with my 12-member family, he said.

 Darjeeling, Sept. 10: The Queen of the Hills could well emerge as the queen of hearts with the glistening Kanchenjunga making a full-fledged celluloid comeback after five decades. 

 If Satyajit Rays Kanchenjunga helped the world discover the charm of Darjeeling, Raja Mukherjees directorial debut Bidhatar Khela is expected to renew the magic of the town, which is increasingly losing out to other hill stations. 

 The big budget Tollywood flick, with a generous sprinkling of Bollywood talents, will be shot mostly in Darjeeling, which might once again catapult the hill town back to the popularity it enjoyed earlier.

 The cast comprises Jeet and Hrishita Bhatt (of Asoka fame) in the lead roles, along with Tum Bin star Priyanshu Chatterjee, Rupa Ganguly, Arjun Chakraborty, Locket Chatterjee, Dulal Lahiri and Bodhisattwa Majumdar. 

 Lalit of the Jatin-Lalit duo will score the music for the film, said Raja, whose is actress Rani Mukherjees elder brother. We will shoot in Darjeeling for 48 days and more than 70 per cent of the movie will be filmed here.

 Darjeeling was not exactly on Rajas mind when he started penning the romantic thriller a beautiful hill was all that he had thought of. His mother, Krishna Mukherjee, came up with the suggestion of using Darjeeling as the setting. When we were young, we used to come here often. I knew it would be the prefect locale for the film, she said. 

 Raja, who had never been to Darjeeling before, was surprised that the beauty of the hills has not been properly exposed to the world.

 After two trips to the town, he has decided to capture every possible site here from St Pauls School to Mount Hermon, from Hotel Viceroy, Gangamaya Park to Rock Garde and Happy Valley. Morgans House in Kalimpong will also make an appearance.

 The toy train will be an integral part of our film and we will shoot on it for four days, Raja said. Five of the six songs in the movie will be shot here, with the heritage on wheels playing an important role in one of them. 

 The film is scheduled for a Poila Boishakh release. 

 Apart from the initial hiccup Dia Mirza backed out of the venture at the last moment the going has been smooth for Raja with the DGHC and the district administration extending full support to what they consider is the biggest promotion of the place. 

 The romantic thriller, promoted under the JR Entertainment banner, is schedule to be released on Poila Baishak (the first day of the Bengali year).

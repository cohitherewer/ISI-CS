The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Tata keeps faith with a big but

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 8: Ratan Tata today expressed confidence in the state governments ability to find land for the small car project but added that any failure to do so would pose a serious problem for Tata Motors.

 There may be some issues relating to land but as an investor in Bengal, we have to see what the state government does. I am sure they will address it, Tata said.

 However, his concern over the fate of his dream project the Rs 1-lakh car was palpable when asked whether the government can deliver on its commitments.

 I am hopeful it will happen. But if it does not, thats a serious problem for Tata Motors, he told The Telegraph.

 The company wants to roll out the first small car in 2008, for which it needs the land as soon as possible.

 Tata Motors, however, will not involve itself in the land acquisition process. We dont come into the picture until we get the land, said Tata, the chairperson of the Tata Group. He added that the issue would be handled by the state.

 Bengal is not the only state where industry is facing resistance over acquisition of land. All lands are agricultural land. Special economic zones are being created on farmland. There has to be a change in the country. We need to address that appropriately, Tata said.

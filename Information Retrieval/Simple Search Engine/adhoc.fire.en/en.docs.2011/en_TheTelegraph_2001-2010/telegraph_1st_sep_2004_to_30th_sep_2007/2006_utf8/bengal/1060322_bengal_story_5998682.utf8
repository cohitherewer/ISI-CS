 Biswas taken briefly out of ventilator 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 21: Anil Biswass condition showed some marginal improvement today. 

 Doctors treating the state CPM secretary, who is on ventilator at a private hospital for three days since suffering a brain haemorrhage, today said he could breathe for a brief period minus the support. 

 The ventilator was withdrawn for a brief period to test whether he can breathe without its help, said one of the doctors attending to Biswas. 

 At times it was possible for him to breathe spontaneously.

 Anil Biswass condition has marginally improved but it is still critical, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said at Writers Buildings. 

 The bulletin issued by the medical board today said: Other clinical parameters, including pulse and blood pressure, remain stable. A CT scan done today also showed some improvement, it added.

 Doctors are now looking into the possibility of bringing him out of the ventilator. However, all these are in discussion stage, the doctor pointed out.

 Some tests were also carried out to find out how Biswass limbs were responding to external stimuli. There was some response of the limbs to stimulus, which was not discernible earlier, a doctor said. 

 The channel implanted on Sunday to drain the cerebro-spinal fluid from to the peritoneum (or the space around the intestines) was removed today, Jayanta Basu, a member of the medical board, said. 

 The seven-member board headed by R.N. Roy also includes S.P. Garai, Sandip Chatterjee, B. Mahanti, Trishit Roy and S.B. Roy.

 The drain is usually not kept for more than a couple of days and so it had to be removed, a doctor explained. 

 However, he said there is still a big clot in the right half of Biswass brain, which the doctors are trying to dissolve with medicines.

 In cases of cerebral haemorrhage, there is always a chance of recurrence. In spite of all routine methods of prevention, in many cases the haemorrhage recurs, a neuro-surgeon said. However, in case of Biswas, there was no fresh haemorrhage till this evening. 

 Doctors said his other organs are also quite stable, despite his long history of renal disorder for which he was undergoing treatment under Basu for years.

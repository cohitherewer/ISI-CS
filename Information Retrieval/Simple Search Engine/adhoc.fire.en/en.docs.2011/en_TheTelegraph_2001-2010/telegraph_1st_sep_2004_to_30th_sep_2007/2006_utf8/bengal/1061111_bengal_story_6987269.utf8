The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Duo sprays cow dung dust, flees

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Barasat, 

 Nov. 10: Two suspected murderers threw cow dung 

 dust at policemen escorting them and fled from the Barrackpore 

 court today.

 Mohammed Nishad has been recaptured, but Manoj Shaw is still at large. While the two were being taken from a room in the court to the court lock-up, they threw powdered cow dung cakes in the eyes of a policeman and escaped, North 24-Parganas superintendent of police Praveen Kumar said. 

 A witness said he saw a policeman escorting the duo suddenly release his grip on them and start rubbing his eyes around 4 pm. Next we saw the two climb up a staircase close to the compound wall and try to jump over it, said Biren Bhagat, a lawyer.

 While Manoj managed to pull off the escape, Nishad struck the wall and fell. Bus drivers and helpers who were sitting outside caught a bleeding Nishad.

 We are also probing how they got the cow dung dust, said the Barrackpore additional superintendent of police.

 Calcutta, Jan. 5: Shibu Karmakar, suffering acute chest pain, was gasping.

 Around 5.30 pm, the ambulance in which he was being taken to Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital was stuck in a traffic jam on Ananda Palit Road because of a CPM rally.

 CPM state secretary Anil Biswas led the 5,000-strong procession to protest against an attack on the party office in Delhi by followers of Swami Ramdev.

 Karmakar, a grocer from Rishra in Hooghly district, 40 km from Calcutta, felt pain in his chest around 2 pm. A doctor asked his family members to rush him to a hospital in Calcutta.

 When we got stuck around 5.30 pm at Philips crossing near Entally, little did we realise that there was a mammoth procession ahead. I asked other drivers for help and came to know that we were only following the procession which had blocked the entire road, said Sambhu Pal, the ambulance attendant.

 An elderly woman relative accompanying Karmakar was close to tears. How can we take a sick person to the hospital with such a huge procession blocking our way? Even patients needing immediate medical attention are not spared, she said.

 Karmakar was admitted to Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital after the ambulance managed to reach there around 6 pm.

 The procession, in which four Left Front ministers, including CPIs Nandagopal Bhattacharya, Socialist Partys Kiranmoy Nanda and Pratim Chatterjee of the Forward Block (Marxist) participated, started from Ananda Palit Road and ended at the eastern side of Park Circus Maidan. Vehicular traffic on the entire stretch came to a halt between 5 pm and 6 pm.

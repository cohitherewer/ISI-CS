 Kidnap bid

 Burdwan, Sept. 19: Two men who tried to take away a three-and-half-year-old boy from his tutors house on the pretext of his grandfathers illness were arrested today. 

 A local youth, Ranadeb Roy, and another man approached the teacher in Katwa town this morning, saying Biswanath Nags grandfather was in serious condition. When the teacher asked what had happened, they hesitated for a moment. Suspicious, he asked the duo to wait and called the boys home. The truth tumbled out. 

 Seeing Biswanaths father, a cloth merchant, arrive the duo fled but were later arrested on charges of trying to kidnap the boy.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 No. 1, what No. 1? CM asks scientists

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Haringhata, Jan. 30: The chief minister today accused the states agriculture universities of not doing any fruitful research. 

 Addressing scientists, teachers and students of Bidhan Chandra Krishi Visvavidyalaya here, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said: We claim success in agriculture. But there are many holes in our claims. We have to face the reality.

 We are the No. 1 producer of rice, jute and vegetables, but many people dont know that we owe our successes to other states. Farmers have done their job and taken the production to a higher level. But scientists have not been able to make us self-reliant.

 Researchers, scientists and professors, he added, should not rest on the past glories of the state.

 Do you know that seeds for all vegetables come from states like Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh? Kanpur meets 70 per cent of our total edible oil demand and 70 per cent of the eggs we consume come from Andhra Pradesh. Almost all seeds to grow jute and pulses come from Maharashtra. How then can we claim to be self- reliant? he asked. 

 Bengal produces about 150 lakh tonnes of rice every year and consumes 138 lakh tonnes. 

 We do not grow enough rice to sell in the markets outside. What is the utility of be- ing the No. 1 producer then? Bhattacharjee asked.

 He posed several such questions to the academic community gathered at the inauguration of a Centre-funded regional agricultural fair on the university campus, about 45 km from Calcutta.

 Why cant we produce high yielding seeds? If other states can, why cant we? 

 There are two agriculture universities in the state. The other one is Uttar Banga Krishi Visvavidyalaya in Cooch Behar. The Nadia varsity, established in 1974, is the oldest. The one in Cooch Behar was set up in 2001. 

 Other states are leaving Bengal behind, the chief minister said. Believe it or not, all other states are steadily moving forward, we are lagging behind.

 He turned to the vice-chancellor of the Bidhan Chandra agriculture varsity, Dipak Bagchi, and said: Dr Bagchi, I can only hope that you will send my message across to your scientists and professors. 

 Bagchi told The Telegraph later his institution had fallen behind in producing hybrid seeds for cultivating rice, jute, vegetables and pulses. 

 The vice-chancellor of the north Bengal varsity, Mrinal Kanti Majumdar, however, said: The chief minister has not been updated on our work.

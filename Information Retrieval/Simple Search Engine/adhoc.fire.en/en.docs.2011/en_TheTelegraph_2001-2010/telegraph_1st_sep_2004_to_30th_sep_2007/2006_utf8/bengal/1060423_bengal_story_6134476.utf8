The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 ?Our party is on a learning curve, but we decide what needs to be done in Bengal?

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee speaks to The Telegraph about policy debates in the CPM, the party-government relationship and his priorities, if elected back to power. 

 The Telegraph: There is 

 an atmosphere of faith in Bengal, but those outside Bengal 

 are often scared away by the statements of your party leaders 

 in Delhi ? do you think the CPM politburo is detrimental 

 to Bengal?s economic growth? 

 Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee: 

 As a communist party, we are going through profound changes. 

 Earlier, the party would regard such changes in a theoretical 

 context, but we have begun to view them from a practical 

 standpoint.

 Our party has traditionally opposed foreign direct investment, technology inflow and lately FDI in retail. But there was a breakthrough in the last party conference on FDI and related issues. We were also opposed to the World Bank and other international funding agencies. The debate is still on, but the attitude has changed. 

 We now accept international funds for development in ?standalone? sectors like health. We tell the funding agencies we will pay the interest for the assistance, but we will not allow you to come into Asim?s (finance minister Asim Dasgupta) budget-making exercise. 

 At times, I may have to work in the face of what Fidel Castro has famously described as opposite current. But my objective is to strive towards the goal, carrying the party along, without getting deflected by the debate.

 TT: But then Bengal is 

 most affected by ?scary? statements?

 BB:Our party is on a learning 

 curve. But we have made it clear (to investors, planners 

 and decision-makers) that we in Bengal decide what 

 needs to be done in Bengal. (We have been able to convince 

 the leadership that we cannot be tethered to dogma.) But 

 there are (weighty) issues which I cannot clinch independently 

 of the party.

 TT: Such as?

 BB: Airport modernisation. I have explained to Prakash (CPM general secretary Prakash Karat) I have got to have Calcutta airport modernised but there are hurdles. We as a party insist on modernisation through public-private partnership but Delhi wants to hand over airports to private parties. As a CPM member I cannot accept it, yet as head of the government, modernisation of Calcutta airport is a priority for me. Prakash says we will address the issue when we confront it. This will be among the areas of concern for us in the days ahead.

 TT: And CITU?

 BB:IT and trade unions 

 will be another concern. We broadly agree that in IT, an 

 employee or a professional has the right to form or join 

 a trade union, but the choice must be left to him. Outsiders 

 cannot be allowed to disrupt working or agitate in IT units.

 TT: Why IT alone?

 BB:Absolutely. In certain 

 industries like jute or tea, wage agreements are already 

 being concluded bypassing unions. But IT is structurally 

 different from other industries, so the question of outsiders-run 

 unions assumes a different hue here. However, Prakash is 

 personally looking into various aspects to fix the party?s 

 approach to IT. 

 TT: Bengal has lost 

 precious time. Aren?t you late in your reforms?

 BB:The past we all know 

 ? Delhi politics and bureaucracy had us cornered, nothing 

 much could be done till the eighties. Even after we announced 

 in 1994 the industrial policy, the negative stereotype about 

 Bengal continued. However, our image has begun to change. 

 Ratan Tata feels strongly about Bengal, so do the ?Reliance? 

 brothers (Mukesh and Anil Ambani), the Japanese are showing 

 their faith in us by expanding investments in Haldia. Salim 

 and a few other groups from Southeast Asia, too, are showing 

 interest. Overall, the confidence level is rising.

 TT: The Comptroller and 

 Auditor General paints an alarming picture of state finances. 

 After paying salaries, pension and repaying debt, your government 

 has very little money for development. How would you service 

 debt now standing at Rs 104,334 crore?

 BB: That report relates to 2003-4, when we were in a critical condition. But the scene improved in 2005-06, thanks to the introduction of value-added tax, higher tax realisation and maximised excise revenue. We closed the 2005 fiscal with a surplus. However, the high debt remains a concern.

 TT: You?ve been in power 

 for 29 years, of which you had the same finance minister 

 for 20. Should he not share the main burden for the mess? 

 BB: (Laughs) Well, permit 

 me to own responsibility for the mess.

 TT: You have been owning 

 up for too many departments ? education, health, horticulture? 

 Aren?t you being a little hard on yourself? 

 BB: People have different 

 or unusual work styles. There are some colleagues who would 

 share details only with their diaries, not with the cabinet 

 or me, even if they are of a critical nature. As a result, 

 the government?s overall goal remains unrealised. But they 

 are no shirkers, they work in this fashion only to suffer 

 quietly. These days I summon the secretaries concerned and 

 ask them to share things with me directly. ?Sir, satya 

 katha balbo (Do we tell the truth?),? they ask. ?I must 

 know the whole truth, including the files that have been 

 put on ice without reason,? I tell them.

 TT: In most democracies, 

 cabinets are frequently shuffled to reward the performers 

 and penalise the laggards. The Left Front has never done 

 so. Why?

 BB: Shuffling the pack 

 midway is a culture at the Centre. Be it the UPA or the 

 NDA, the people running a coalition at the Centre are always 

 under pressure from various quarters to accommodate power 

 players. For the sake of continuity of policies, we allow 

 a minister enough time to deliver.

 TT: And 29 years is not 

 long enough to deliver?

 BB: If we are able to return 

 to power, the next cabinet will judge its members only on 

 performance. We are going to pick cabinet members carefully.

 TT: How much freedom will 

 you have in picking your team? Aren?t your hands tied by 

 quotas ? from affiliated units, districts?

 BB: It is true. The CPM?s take on the government is different from other parties. For instance, being a member of a communist party, I regard myself as one of the ministers who also heads the government. However, this time our thrust is on having only those in the cabinet who can perform. There will not be any other consideration. By dropping so many ministers and sitting MLAs and fielding new faces, we have issued a statement of our intent.

 TT: You have cleaned the 

 education stables. But what about those who have spent more 

 than 20 years in the same office and have not delivered?

 BB: I would rather stop 

 this discussion here. Suffice it to say we have already 

 completed the preliminary work, after taking the district 

 units into confidence. Let the election be over, you will 

 see how we deliver on the statement of intent.

 TT: For you integrity and 

 honesty constitute a mantra ? but the same cannot be said 

 about several of your cabinet colleagues, a few of them 

 are managing important departments. 

 BB: I am aware of it. Just wait for a while.

 TT: Does the new 

 approach include splitting the IT and environment ministries?

 BB: I think IT and environment 

 may have to be separated for efficient functioning.

 TT: You have taken some 

 initiatives in improving the state of education in Bengal, 

 but structural hurdles remain.

 BB: Without going into 

 specifics, let me say universities and colleges have suffered 

 because of political interference. I shall refrain from 

 naming individual names, but it is a fact that our higher 

 education minister ? Satyada (Satyasadhan Chakraborty, who 

 has been dropped this time) is a good soul. He had come 

 under intense pressure from different quarters (read CPM 

 hierarchy) when he tried to implement government policies. 

 Political people, lobbies made things difficult in higher 

 education.

 TT:Let?s take just one 

 hurdle. The government recruits teachers for private schools 

 or colleges. Should such a system exist in a free market 

 economy?

 BB: The structure we have 

 constructed over time will have to be examined, and, if 

 necessary, changed. Our current exercise in granting autonomy 

 to some government colleges offers an insight into our plans 

 for re-creating centres of excellence. Certain noble, progressive 

 concepts relating to higher education came unstuck in the 

 past few decades, thanks to inefficiency of the (education) 

 department and tinkering by lobbies and politicians.

 TT: The CPM has historically 

 opposed excellence. Even Amartya Sen?s appointment in Jadavpur 

 University was opposed ? by Jyoti Basu himself. Can you 

 change all that?

 BB:Our new agenda for education 

 will emphasise quality and nurturing of talent. I have asked 

 the department to ensure that an unbiased recruitment mechanism 

 is put in place before it is too late. Just because one 

 is aligned with the CPM does not mean he will have to be 

 given a teaching or non-teaching job in an educational institution.

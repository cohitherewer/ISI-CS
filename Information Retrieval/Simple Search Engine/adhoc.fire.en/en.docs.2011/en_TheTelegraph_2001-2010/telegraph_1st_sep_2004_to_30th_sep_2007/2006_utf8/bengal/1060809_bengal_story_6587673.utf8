 Love beeps and breaks

 Cell-shock 

 Krishnagar, Aug. 8: Nilanjan Biswas has realised there are no missed calls in life.

 The 17-year-old mobile freak is cooling his heels in a lock-up after a cellphone romance soured amid allegations that he abducted and raped his girlfriend, who wanted a marriage pledge honoured.

 Having been gifted his first mobile from his headmaster-father after coming out with flying colours in Madhyamik last year, the class XI student from Kalna punched missed calls on imaginary numbers. One of those beeped on the cellphone of Smita Bhakta, (name changed) six months ago.

 The third-year BA student from Nadias Kaligunj initially ignored the calls but, one day, charmed by his voice and out of sheer curiosity, she called back. That turned Nilanjans life upside down.

 Then, over calls and messages, a relationship blossomed and, about five months ago, the two met at Plassey. 

 They fell in love despite the fact that Smita was five years older.

 However, last night, Nilanjan was arrested from his home on charges of abducting and raping Smita. This followed a police complaint from the 22-year-old girl and her father, also a primary-school headmaster.

 Smita has been sent to a Krishnagar shelter home for medical tests on Wednesday. 

 Today, police recorded her statement before a chief judicial magistrate.

 In her complaint, Smita admitted she fell in love with Nilanjan.

 Last month, she said they travelled to Delhi. While there, we lived together, had a physical relationship and then assured each other that we will get married. But after returning to Nadia 10 days ago, Nilanjan told me he would not be able to tie the knot as I am older and his father would not accept the marriage, Smita told the police. Last Sunday, Smita turned the tables on Nilanjan, accusing him of rape. 

 The boy is still a minor. Since she has lodged a rape complaint, we had to arrest Nilanjan, said Nadia police superintendent R. Rajsekharan.

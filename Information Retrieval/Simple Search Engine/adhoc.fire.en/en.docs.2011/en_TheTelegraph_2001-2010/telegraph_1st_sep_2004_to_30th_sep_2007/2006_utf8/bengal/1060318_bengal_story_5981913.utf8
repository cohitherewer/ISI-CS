The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 EC brass on Bengal mission

 Calcutta, 

 March 17: After rushing observers thrice in three 

 months to make the rolls error-free, the full Election Commission 

 is coming to Calcutta to look into poll preparations, reports 

 our special correspondent.

 Chief B.B. Tandon and election commissioners N. Gopalswamy and Navin Chawla will be here on March 21 and 22. They will meet the chief electoral officer, top government officials and representatives of political parties.

 Chief electoral officer Debasish Sen today met the chief secretary, home secretary and director-general of police to discuss ways to combat the Maoists in the run-up to the polls.

 Sources said the commiss-ion would deliberate on law and order, execution of non-bailable warrants, seizure of illegal arms, deployment of central forces and the Maoist menace in Purulia, Bankura and West Midnapore, which are going to polls in a month.

 The poll panel today revised an earlier order and allowed implementation of the food-for-work programme in schemes already approved, though the model code of conduct is in place.

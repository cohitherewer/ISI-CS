 Doctors on strike over assault

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Durgapur, March 16: Junior doctors of Burdwan Medical College and Hospital have struck work after an assault on some of them over the death of a 16-year-old boy.

 Doctors in Mumbai had recently gone on strike over a similar incident.

 Santosh Ram, 16, a resident of the Sahachetan area and son of a Group-D employee of the hospital, drowned in a pond last evening. His friends pulled him out and brought him to the hospital.

 Though the junior doctors on duty claimed Santosh was brought dead, the youths alleged that he was left unattended for more than half an hour.

 A section of Group-D staff joined the youths and went on the rampage. They also beat up two junior doctors. About 200 junior doctors then went on strike in protest.

 Hospital superintendent Sarit Chowdhury held talks with the doctors but the stalemate continued even as the heads of departments struggled to cope with about 1,200 patients in various wards.

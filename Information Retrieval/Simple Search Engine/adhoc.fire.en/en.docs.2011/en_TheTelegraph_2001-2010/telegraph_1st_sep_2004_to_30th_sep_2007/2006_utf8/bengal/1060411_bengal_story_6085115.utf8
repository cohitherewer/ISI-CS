The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Jute growers pay the price

 AMIT CHAKRABORTY

 Calcutta, April 10: The Election Commissions purpose is noble ? to make the poll process clean ? but its not going to win a popularity contest among some 400,000 farmers spread across several districts.

 Thanks to the commission, these farmers cannot receive free jute seeds under a government programme. 

 Under the model code of conduct that came into force with the announcement of the elections, governments cannot dispense any special favours.

 This is the peak sowing season and the jute industry is worried about a possible shortage of fibre if the farmers get delayed access to seeds after the elections end in mid-May. 

 An Indian Jute Mills Association official estimated a shortfall of 14 to 15 lakh bales of fibre from regular production.

 The state agriculture department had pleaded with the poll panel to allow the free distribution of jute seeds saying that it is done every year under the Comprehensive Agriculture Development Programme and does not constitute a special favour. 

 The government, it is apparent, has not succeeded in convincing the commission.

 About seven to eight quintals of certified jute seeds from government farms in Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh are given to farmers each season. The Jute Corporation of India buys the fibre produced. 

 This has been going on for several years and through several elections. Agriculture, especially sowing a crop like jute, is time bound, so there can be no delay, an official of the Jute Balers Association said. 

 Late March to mid-May is the peak sowing season in Burdwan, East and West Midnapore, Nadia, South and North 24-Parganas, Murshidabad and Malda. 

 The development comes on top of short crops for three years and could force jute mills to cut production. 

 In the 2005-06 jute year (July-June), fibre availability was about 80 lakh bales and 75 lakh bales in the previous season.

 The high fibre price in the current year could have lured many farmers to jute. But the farmers who had become used to getting the seed free might turn away, said a spokesman for the jute mills association.

 This is not the first time the jute industry is suffering for political reasons. 

 During the 1991 Gulf War, Saudi Arabia had wanted to buy 300,000 sandbags. At the behest of then chief minister Jyoti Basu, the Citu-affiliated Forward Seamens Union had prevented the shipment because the Saudis had aligned with the US.

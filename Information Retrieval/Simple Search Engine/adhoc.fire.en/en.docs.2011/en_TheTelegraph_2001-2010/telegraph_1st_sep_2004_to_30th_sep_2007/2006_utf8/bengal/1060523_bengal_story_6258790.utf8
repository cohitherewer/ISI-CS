 Spurned driver in MMS revenge

Teacher drugged and filmed nude

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Barasat, May 22: A driver hired to ferry a teacher to her school drugged her, took pictures of her in the nude on a cellphone and sent them to her prospective groom?s family because she had spurned his proposal. 

 Nurul Islam, 32, the driver, and his alleged associate Riyajul Haque, who co-owns a car dealership, were arrested yes-terday in Madhyamgram, North 24-Parganas. 

 Police had tracked down the phone from which the photographs had been MMSed.

 The 27-year-old woman?s wedding, scheduled next month, has been called off by the groom?s family.

 ?We arrested Nurul and Riyajul on the basis of a complaint lodged by the woman. The mobile phone with which the photographs were taken has been seized,? said Praveen Kumar, the North 24-Parganas superintendent of police.

 Piyali Ghosh (name changed), the daughter of a district intelligence branch inspector posted in South 24-Parganas, teaches in an English-medium school at Madhyamgram and had been travelling to and from it in the hired car since February. 

 ?The car was hired from an agency belonging to one Bablu Ghosh, who engaged Nurul. He developed a crush on Piyali and wanted to marry her. Nurul was rudely refused when he proposed marriage in early April. But Piyali continued to go to school in cars driven by Nurul,? said a Barasat police station officer. 

 Piyali had reported Nurul?s proposal to her father, who warned him against making any further move and told him that her marriage had been fixed. 

 An investigating officer said: ?Nurul carefully planned his revenge and roped in friend Riyajul, the co-owner of a two-wheeler and car shop in Madhyamgram.? 

 On May 13, Nurul arrived with Riyajul to drive Piyali to her school. 

 Piyali was drugged in the car, but she cannot recall how. 

 The district police chief said: ?We will have to grill the duo for details, but they have confessed to their crime.?

 The two took an unconscious Piyali to a house in Madhyamgram and even ?applied make-up and lipstick to deck her up like a fashion model?. 

 When she regained consciousness about an hour later, she was fully clothed, but a little dizzy. ?Nurul told her that she had lost consciousness all of a sudden and that they had to sprinkle water on her face to help her regain her senses,? an officer said.

 Neither Piyali nor her family suspected any foul play until her future father-in-law, a retired government employee, received the pictures on his mobile phone. 

 Piyali?s father Sudhin (name changed) took her to the police station immediately.

 An investigating officer, wiser after the crime, said Sudhin should not have allowed Nurul to continue in the job after the marriage proposal.

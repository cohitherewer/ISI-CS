The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Rs 1.6 lakh for rail job

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Nov. 16: A young man who had attended a months training, got an appointment letter with an Eastern Railway letterhead and was posted at a level-crossing in South 24-Parganas came to know after drawing salary for two months that he was working illegally. 

 Everything from 24-year-old Anjan Sits medical check-up to pay-slips was fake. 

 Detective department sleuths arrested four people today for running the racket. Arunabha Das, who was picked up from City Centre in Salt Lake, was said to be the mastermind of the gang. 

 In connivance with railway employees, they replaced a genuine gateman and gave Anjan a false posting, said Gyanwant Singh, the detective department deputy commissioner of police.

 During investigation, police came to know that Arunabha, 32, a resident of Tegharia, had opened a placement firm on Bangur Avenue and a professional training institute on VIP Road near Kaikhali to dupe people. 

 Das took Rs 1.6 lakh from Anjan, promising him a job in the railways, said Singh. 

 After paying the money in two instalments, Anjan was taken to BR Singh Hospital for a medical test, the final stage before getting the appointment. Railway employees involved in the racket produced Anjan before the doctor saying he was a close relative.

 After the test, Das was handed a fake appointment letter and a railway identity card. 

 He was taken to a level-crossing in Dhanbad, where he was made to watch for over a month how to man a railway gate. He was then brought to Gurudasnagar railway station, 60 km south of Calcutta, and given a posting there.

 Anjan drew a salary of Rs 6,000 for two months. Das forked out the money to win his clients trust, the police said. 

 Anjan had a sneaking suspicion when he found two designations that of a gate-man and a booking clerk on his identity card. He went to the police.

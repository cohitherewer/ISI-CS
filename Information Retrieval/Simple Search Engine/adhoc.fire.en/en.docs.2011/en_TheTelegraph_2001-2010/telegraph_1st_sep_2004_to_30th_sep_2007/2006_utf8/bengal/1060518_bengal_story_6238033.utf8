 Murder hush-up charge

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Behrampore, May 17: A Behrampore court today sentenced four members of a village salishi board to seven years imprisonment for protecting Mokkar Malithha, charged with murdering his wife Manowara Bibi 11 years ago.

 The third additional sessions judge of Behrampore court, Haripada Das, also sentenced Mokkars father Khalil to five years in jail for influencing the salishi members to rule in his sons favour. Mokkar is absconding. 

 On May 25 1995, Manowara, 18, was found hanging in Mokkars house in Dayarampur village under Jalangi police station, 255 km from Calcutta. The Malithhas said Manowara had committed suicide.

 But her father Mokhtar Shaikh refused to believe them and decided to lodge a complaint with Jalangi police, accusing his daughters in-laws of murder.

 The village salishi board stopped Mokhtar from going to the police and promised to bring the guilty to book.

 But after hearing both parties, the salishi members allowed the Malithhas to bury Manowaras body and told Mokkars father to return the Rs 10,000 he had received as dowry from Mokhtar.

 Mokhtar then moved the chief judicial magistrates court in Behrampore. It ordered a post-mortem of Manowaras body, which revealed that the woman had been strangled to death. The salishi board members and the Malithhas had conspired to hush up the murder, the judge said today.

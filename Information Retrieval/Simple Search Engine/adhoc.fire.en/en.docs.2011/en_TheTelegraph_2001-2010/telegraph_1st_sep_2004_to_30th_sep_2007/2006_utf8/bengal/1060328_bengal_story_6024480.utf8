 Calcutta, March 27: The government today extended the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Councils tenure by six months. 

 The councils original tenure had expired on March 26 last year, after which it was extended in mid-November. Officials said the third extension had to be allowed as the new autonomous council under the Sixth Schedule is yet to be formed.

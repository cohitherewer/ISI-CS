The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Chopper to 

 take charge

 Bigger role awaiting poll vehicle 

 SUJAN DUTTA

 THE FEAR FACTOR

 Purulia, 

 April 14: Police in Maoist-insurgency Purulia, Bankura 

 and West Midnapore have made a case for helicopters to be 

 used to combat the extremist armed squads. 

 The helicopters are to be used 

 for rapid deployment of security forces because fear of 

 landmines laid by the insurgents is slowing down security 

 forces.

 The police want to requisition 

 at least one helicopter for each district that will be capable 

 of ferrying 20 personnel. But, to start with, a request 

 has been made for at least one helicopter to cover the hilly 

 and forested belt stretching from West Midnapore to Purulia 

 along the border with Jharkhand.

 Earlier, a study by Jharkhand 

 police and the civil aviation department had made a case 

 for a Jharkhand Air Guard. The study was submitted to the 

 Union home ministry late last year.

 The use of helicopters against 

 Maoist armed squads in Bengal can necessitate the creation 

 of a separate force or the creation of a special component 

 in the security grid for the state. The Andhra Pradesh government 

 did it a few years ago with a force that it calls the ?Greyhounds?.

 The Union home ministry and the 

 security establishment in Delhi, too, are grad-ually veering 

 round to the view that extraordinary steps need to be taken 

 to curtail Maoists across seven states. Last month, the 

 cabinet committee on Security approved enhanced reimbursement 

 of security-related expenditure in these states.

 Helicopters would be used in the 

 first phase of the Bengal Assembly elections due here on 

 April 17 to ferry polling personnel. 

 But these choppers would not be 

 at the disposal of the state government after the polls.

 The police have already been given 

 digital maps and global positioning systems and these are 

 in use in Bengal. Night vision devices have also been given 

 to a Special Operations Group of the state armed police. 

 Each of the three districts in Bengal have a special operations 

 group equipped with AK 47 and Insas rifles, night vision 

 devices and a digitised map of their area of responsibility. 

 Armed police director-general 

 Rajat Majumdar is also understood to have demonstrated a 

 US-made human detection system that is in the process of 

 being acquired. The system works on the ultra low frequency 

 radiation emitted by a human body to detect movement within 

 a radius of 500 metres. They are different from the thermal 

 imaging systems used by the army along the Line of Control 

 in Jammu and Kashmir.

 The Maoists? arsenal comprises 

 mostly .303 rifles and 7.65-mm SLRs snatched from the police 

 ? mostly in Jharkhand but also in Bengal ? and Claymore 

 mines that can be buried on the road but also hung from 

 trees. 

 The latest incident of rifle snatching 

 in Bengal was in Purulia on February 13. One officer said 

 it was within ?audible range? from Purulia town.

 This is how he described the incident 

 at Katadi: ?A few young men walked up to a police chowky 

 (outpost) next to a primary health centre. They pretended 

 that they were engaged in a scuffle in the train and had 

 come there to lodge an FIR and then to get medication at 

 the primary health centre. Having gained access, they neutralised 

 the sentry, picked up about six guns and fled. They were 

 mostly .303 rifles.?

 The real challenge for the administration 

 will be immediately after the polls ? of which the Maoists 

 have called for a boycott but at the same time are saying 

 they will not engineer major disruption ? after most of 

 the paramilitary forces are deployed for duties elsewhere 

 during the five-phase elections.

 Just before the polls there were 

 five companies of the CRPF, Eastern Frontier Rifles, and 

 the India Reserve Battalion deployed in the region. 

 For the elections, an additional 

 161 companies ? more than 16,000 personnel ? from the CRPF, 

 BSF and Haryana police are in the process of being deployed.

 The need for helicopters will 

 be felt most after the central forces are withdrawn.

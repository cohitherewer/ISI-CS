The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 CM rap for slow probe 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 4: The chief minister today asked health officials to move faster and wrap up the work of committees set up to probe charges of negligence in hospitals. 

 Among the panels that are yet to finish work is one looking into the death of a patient who was bitten by ants through a night at Sambhunath Pandit Hospital last November. Fifty-year-old Gouri Rani Chakraborty must have cried out in pain as the ants nibbled at her eye, but no nurse could hear her.

 At Swastha Bhavan in Salt Lake, where health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra, health secretary Kalyan Bagchi, director of medical education Jayasree Mitra, director of health services K.C. Barui and other senior officials attended a meeting, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee specifically asked about the proceedings of the inquiry committees. 

 Disciplinary action against doctors and hospital employees, too, figured in the talks. 

 There was concern also about expensive equipment lying in disrepair in government hospitals. Mishra had earlier said employees salary would be deducted if they are found responsible for that.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Self-help sermon to hounded hamlet 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Asannagar, June 22: CPM state secretary Biman Bose today told villagers of Chandpur in Nadia to set up resistance groups to fight Naxalites instead of depending on police for protection.

 Maoist guerrillas had gunned down tribal CPM leaders Uttam Sardar and Swapan Sardar at the village, about 120 km from Calcutta, on Tuesday as they did not quit the CPM in spite of warnings by the rebels.

 Comparing the attack with those in Maoist-affected areas of Bankura, Purulia and West Midnapore, Bose advised party workers to set up their own security network without relying on the police.

 When I visited Bandwan (in Purulia) before the elections, I told our workers there that they should arrange their own security without relying on the police. The people of Chandpur should do the same. The situation here is not different from Purulia or Bankura. Why rely solely on the police when they fail to protect you? Build your own resistance groups, Bose told party workers.

 The Maoist problem cannot be solved unilaterally. We have our limitations. But attempts are on to put an end to the problem, he said.

 Bose reached Chandpur this morning along with two ministers from the district, Bankim Ghosh and Benoy Biswas. District CPM secretary Ashu Ghosh also accompanied Bose.

 Swapans widow Juthika urged Bose to ensure that her three children, aged seven, five and one, are not harmed. Babu, aamar sansar je bheshey galo. Ami ekhon ki korbo tinte santan niye? Amake ekta kaaj din (My family has been ruined. What will I do now with my three children? Please provide me with a job, Juthika sobbed.

 Dont worry, we are there. The party and the government are there. We will all look after you. This is my promise, an emotional Bose told Juthika.

 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, Oct. 27: Sajal Barui, who killed his father and stepmother when he was 14, attempted suicide in Alipore Central Jail this evening. 

 He tried to hang himself with a bedsheet but failed as a warder intervened, police said. Sajal has been admitted to the jail hospital. The lifer fled jail in September 2001, eight years after the crime, and was arrested a year and a half later for a different crime and under an alias, Sheikh Raju. A police officer recognised his face three months after that. 

 Calcutta: Mamata Banerjee has said that her party would undertake a Calcutta-to-Singur march on the lines of Mahatma Gandhis Dandi yatra. The three-day road show against the acquisition of land for Tata Motors car plant will begin on November 17.

 Calcutta: Foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon will be here on Saturday. On his way from Bhutan, Menon is likely to discuss the Bangladesh border with the chief minister, a Writers Buildings official said. 

 Calcutta: The government has decided to shift 14 small-scale units outside the city to check pollution. They include bleaching and dyeing units at Metiabruz, acid manufacturers at Bagmari, plastic recyclers at Cossipore and bulb manufacturers at Beliaghata.

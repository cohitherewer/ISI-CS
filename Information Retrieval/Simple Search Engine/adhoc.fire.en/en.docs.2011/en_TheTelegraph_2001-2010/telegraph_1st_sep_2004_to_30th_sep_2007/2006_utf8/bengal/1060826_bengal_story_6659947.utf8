The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Be firm on acquisition, says Ficci

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 25: An industry body has labelled the protests against land acquisition at Singur reckless politics and urged the government to tackle it with a firmer hand.

 The goings on at Singur might scare away investors again, said C.K. Dhanuka, the eastern region chairman of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry.

 At a news conference on West Bengal: Towards a mature industrial economy yesterday, Dhanuka said states such as Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Haryana had evolved a land delivery module and Bengal needed to do the same to make up for lost time. 

 There are approximately 136.38 lakh acres of farmland in Bengal, which is 63.5 per cent of the total land. There is no dearth of land. But land issues are being politicised. The government has to identify tracts for industry and put in place a mechanism that will ensure investors get their requirements in a short period, Dhanuka said. 

 Other states deliver land in 4 to 6 months. It takes much longer here. Investors can end up losing interest as has happened before.

 A section of farmers led by Trinamul Congress leader has been protesting against land acquisition at Singur in Hooghly, where the Tatas have proposed a car factory. The save farmland committee formed there will line up schoolchildren tomorrow to protest against the takeover.

 Dhanuka said there was no alternative to offering agricul- tural land for industrial purposes as Bengal does not have vast stretches of barren plots. 

 The rehabilitation of farmers has to be worked out by the government in collaboration with industry and the chambers of commerce.

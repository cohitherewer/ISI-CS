 Cop clean chit eludes JU duo

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 5: Bappaditya Chatterjee and Kaushik Sarkhel have not been given a clean chit by CID officials investigating the Purulia trekking mishap. 

 The CID team, which arrived in Calcutta last night from Bagmundi, Purulia, where three Jadavpur University students were found dead, today said there were still questions to be answered by the two survivors.

 Although we havent yet found any lead indicating possibility of foul play, some missing links are there. We are looking for answers to some questions that have triggered confusion. A clear picture will soon emerge, said CID special superintendent Sanjay Singh. 

 He interrogated Bappaditya and Kaushik today.

 Kaushik came to the CIDs Bhawani Bhavan headquarters around 1.10 pm. Officers of the special operations group recorded his statements for over four hours. 

 The medical examination of the injuries found on Bappaditya and Kaushik was conducted at the SSKM Hospital today. The doctors report is yet to reach us, said an official. 

 He added that the post-mortem reports of Swati Das and Arundhati Ghosh the two girls who died in the trekking tragedy confirmed their death by drowning. 

 The officer said the injuries found on their bodies looked like they were caused by an accident. Water and mud was found in their stomachs. 

 But the CID is not drawing any conclusion from the reports as there are some questions which have no answers. 

 Our job is to ask the two survivors to establish the missing links, said the official.

 The five Jadavpur University students Bappaditya, Kaushik, Subhankar Saha, Swati and Arundhati had set out on a trekking trip on July 28 to Ayodhya Hills, but a flash flood is believed to have claimed three of them. 

 Questions were raised after the bodies of the girls were found naked. We have spoken to mountaineering experts to know if heavy water flow due to a flash flood can be responsible for this, said Rajeev Kumar, deputy inspector-general, operations. They have asked for a couple of days to get back.

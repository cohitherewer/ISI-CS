 Man dies on wife deathbed

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Chinsurah (Hooghly), July 22: His wife lay dead on the bed for two days, and he lay next to her, helpless.

 Gosthogopal Roy, who had become infirm with age, could not move or cry out for help. 

 Yesterday, the stench from the room alerted his landlord who forced open the door.

 I knew that my wife was dead but I am helpless, the octogenarian, who cannot move and can barely speak mumbled to his landlord, who rushed to contact Roys relatives.

 But by the time they arrived, Roy, too, had breathed his last.

 Police went to the Serampore house yesterday afternoon and sent the bodies to a hospital nearby. 

 Both Roy and his 70-year-old wife Rajlakshmi were suffering from age-related ailments.

 Anirudhha, the son of landlord Anil Laha, was the first to raise an alarm. He told his father about the strange smell and they decided to go and check on the couple.

 The aged man had been bed-ridden for the past couple of months and his wife used to look after him, said Salil Ganguly, the inspector-in-charge of Serampore police station. 

 Even after realising that his wife was dead, Roy was not in a position to come out of his house and inform the neighbours. So, he had no option but to lie beside her body, Ganguly added.

 According to Laha, all the windows and doors of the Roys house were bolted from inside. 

 When he told Roy that his wife had passed away, he replied: Aami jani du din age mara giyechhe. Aami ki korbo? Aamar to beriye tomader jananoro shokti nei (I know she died two days ago. What could I do? I dont have the strength to go out and inform you).

 Roy, a former jute mill employee, then requested Laha to get in touch with his nephew Manik who stays close by. 

 But Manik was not at home. When he was finally contacted on his cellphone. He said he would be there in a couple of hours.

 But it was too late. I entered the room and saw the decomposed body of my aunt on the bed. My uncle was lying beside her, Manik said. When I touched him, I realised that he, too, was dead.

 Officers of Serampore police station were then informed.

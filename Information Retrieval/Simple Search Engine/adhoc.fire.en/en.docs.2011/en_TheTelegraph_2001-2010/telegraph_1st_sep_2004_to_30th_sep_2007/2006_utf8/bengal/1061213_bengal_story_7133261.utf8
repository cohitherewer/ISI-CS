 Calcutta, Dec. 12: Mamata Banerjee, who was advised by the Governor today to conserve her energy, has called a three-day sit-in of Trinamul Congress workers at Esplanade from Friday.

 Trinamul activists and supporters from across the state will converge at Esplanade on December 15 to organise a 72-hour sit-in to express solidarity with our fasting. We shall all stick to the 72-hour deadline, come what may, Mamata told a gathering in front of her dharna manch this afternoon. 

 The sit-in threatens to bring traffic in the citys business district to a halt.

 Mamata has been on hunger strike for nine days, demanding that the land acquisition for Tata Motors small-car project in Singur be stopped.

 A statement issued from Raj Bhavan said governor Gopal Krishna Gandhi is anxious about Banerjees health and urges her to terminate her fast and authorise her representatives to commence a dialogue with the government. 

 The governor also believes that Smt Banerjee and other protesters should conserve their energy and direct it towards evolving long-term norms for land-use and land conversion in a state where agriculture is paramount and industrialisation is also imperative. 

 Singurs Trinamul MLA Rabindranath Bhattacharya, who too has been on a fast, was brought to SSKM Hospital from Hooghly this evening as his condition deteriorated. 

 CPM politburo member and Rajya Sabha MP from Bengal Brinda Karat said the party was against a discussion on Singur in Parliament, which Trinamul and the BJP have been demanding.

 Trinamul MP Dinesh Tri-vedi tried to raise the issue in the upper House today, with support from BJP and Shiv Sena members, forcing two adjournments.

 State issues are not discussed in Parliament. Those who want to debate it should have done it in the Assembly, Karat said. 

 But the party is not taking chances and has asked state secretary Biman Bose to meet CPM MPs in Delhi tomorrow and brief them on Singur. 

 Karat, who was in the city to attend a CPM-organised rally of Singur farmers who had sold their land to the government, urged Mamata to end her fast because the land had been given up voluntarily. 

 But the rally on Rani Rashmoni Avenue, held under the banner of the Progressive Willing Landgivers for Industrialisation and Urban development, was thinly attended. 

 Mamata seized on the poor turnout convener Dibakar Das had yesterday promised a big gathering saying it proved her claim that land had been forcibly acquired. 

 Asima Koley and Malati Das, two Singur women who did turn up at the rally, said they sold their land because it was unproductive except during the monsoon. 

 They complained to Karat that outsiders had attacked the homes of the willing landgivers and instigated police on December 2.

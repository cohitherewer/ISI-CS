The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Doctor held for partner murder

 OUR BUREAU 

 Durgapur, Sept. 1: A doctor was arrested in Burdwan today for allegedly murdering his friend and business partner inside a polyclinic they co-owned.

 Gynaecologist Aditya Prasad Roy allegedly called Abh-aypada Das to the clinic for some business-related discussion last night. 

 His family received the doctors call around midnight saying that Das had committed suicide. Around 12, we received a call from Aditya. He asked us to rush to the clinic in a hurry because my brother had hanged himself, said Dass brother Shyamapada.

 Neighbours at Khoshbagan in Burdwan town, about 90 km from Calcutta, the Roys and the Dases had known each other for a long time.

 When Shyamapada and other members of his family came running to the clinic, about half a km from their house, there was a crowd baying for the doctors blood. 

 Shyamapada heard someone in the crowd say that the two had a quarrel, which ended in the murder.

 The clinic was ransacked and the 55-year-old doctor was roughed up. As Roy slumped to the ground bleeding, the mob set ablaze a two-wheeler parked outside. 

 Police rescued Roy, his son Krishnagopal, 31, and Ramesh Ram, 35, the caretaker of the polyclinic. We later arrested all three. We are probing the roles played by the other two, deputy superintendent of police Jane Alam said. A murder case has been registered against the trio on the basis of Shyamapadas complaint. 

 Soon after his arrest, Roy started vomiting and complained of chest pain. He was admitted to the Burdwan Medical College and Hospital. 

 Krishnagopal and Ramesh, who were produced in the subdivisional magisrates court this afternoon, have been remanded in a fortnights judicial custody. 

 Das, 45, who has a medical shop, was made a partner in the polyclinic about two months ago, the police said.

 Shyamapada told the police that while being assaulted, the doctor admitted calling Das over for a meeting. He also said that his younger brothers relationship with Roy had strained of late. But I cant tell the reason for the murder. 

 There was no reason for his brother to commit suicide at the polyclinic, Shyamapada added. Why should he go all the way to the clinic?

 Post-mortem proves injury

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Feb. 1: The post-mortem of Aksar Biswas, the alternative medicine practitioner who worked in a Delhi nursing home, has been unable to pin-point the exact cause of death. 

 There were injuries in the brain and a haemorrhage but officials here said their cause was difficult to ascertain. 

 Doctors who performed the study have suggested that the viscera be investigated further in the capital. 

 Aksar died after he went to a party with three doctors on Republic Day. 

 The next morning, the trio told his wife Sulekha that her husband had suffered a heart attack. But she refused to believe the doctors and lodged a complaint at a Delhi police station accusing them of poisoning Aksar. 

 From the Delhi nursing home, the body was sent in an ambulance to his family home in Nadias Chapra, 130 km from Calcutta. 

 Acting on Sulekhas complaint, Delhi police asked their Nadia counterparts to take possession of the body and conduct the post-mortem. 

 Sulekha had said that the three doctors of Aksars nursing home had invited him to a dinner at Malvya Nagar on January 26. 

 A three-doctor team cond-ucted the post-mortem at Shaktinagar Hospital yesterday.

 In their report, the doctors have said that circumstantial evidence is essential to find out the real cause of Aksar Biswass death. There were internal injuries in the brain, which are of course mysterious but, at the same time, the reason behind them is difficult to pin-point in an ordinary post-mortem. Aksar also suffered internal haemorrhage, a district health official who saw the report said.

 The viscera will be handed over to Delhi police. 

 Sources said doctors here had initially refused to conduct the post-mortem fearing summons from courts in Delhi when the case comes up for trial. They wanted the body to be sent to Calcutta.

 A doctor who took part in the post-mortem today said: Its a risk.

 Nadia deputy chief medical officer of health Mohan Basu said: We also realised that the post-mortem was important. So we formed a team of senior surgeons to conduct it.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Fathers son yes, but successor? Not sure

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Dinhata, May 6: Twenty- four-year-old Samar Roy hurriedly stubbed out his cigarette as Kamal Guha came out of an election meeting.

 Many like Roy in this town, 25 km from Cooch Behar, are deferential to the 83-year-old Forward Bloc leader, their MLA since 1977. 

 But the agriculture minister has called it a day. His son Udayan, keen to slip into the mantle, is the Forward Blocs Dinhata candidate.

 Will the constituency be equally warm to him? That is the question.

 Anarul Haq, who works in a local bread factory, had voted for Guha all along and would have done the same this time, if he were the candidate. Voting for Udayan is different?. Im having second thoughts, he says. 

 A businessman who used to deal in fertilisers and seeds, detractors say, Udayans trade was in line with his fathers ministry and his declared assets of over Rs 1.2 crore speak volumes. He now claims to have given up business for politics.

 Kamal Guhas eagerness to promote his 51-year-old son smacks of dynastic rule, something the Left parties have always slammed.

 To ensure that there is no challenge to Guha juniors nomination, the father allegedly showed the door to many senior leaders. 

 Amar Roy Pradhan, Deepak Sengupta and Bimal Basu were forced to leave the party after they made their opinion (on Udayan) heard, says Hiten Nag, a long-time associate of Kamal Guha who is contesting the seat as an Independent. 

 No wonder the Trinamul Congresss Ashok Mondal is sniffing a chance. Udayan is a newcomer. He has neither his fathers maturity nor the ability. Even ardent Bloc supporters will not vote for him. 

 The Bloc does not agree. Kamaldas name has become synonymous with Dinhata and the people look up to him as their guardian. They have pledged to vote his son to the Assembly this time, says leader Hiralal Das. 

 Kamal Guha had won by about 20,000 votes in 2001, tallying a share of 53.05 per cent. 

 Strictly following the pol- iticians dress code ? white kurta-pyjama ? Udayan talks sparsely, but is aware of the burden his fathers reputation brings. All big trees shed lea-ves. That doesnt lead to the trees death. I intend to carry on the good work that my father has been doing, he says. 

 Is he also eyeing his fathers portfolio? He wont comment, but Dinhata is abuzz with speculation. 

 Observers say he has to win first. In a constituency where the Rajbangshi community forms 51 per cent of the electorate, the influence of the Greater Cooch Behar Peoples Association might swing the poll. The association has been demanding a separate Greater Cooch Behar state.

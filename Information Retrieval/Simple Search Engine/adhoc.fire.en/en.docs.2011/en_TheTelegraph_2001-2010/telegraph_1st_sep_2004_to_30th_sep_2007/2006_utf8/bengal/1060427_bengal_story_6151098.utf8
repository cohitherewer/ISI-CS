The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 In whips seat, no one holds the whip hand

 SAMARPAN DUTTA

 Constituency: Ballygunge

 Rabin Deb beat Trinamuls Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar 

 by 3,349 votes in 2001

 At the Alimuddin Street headquarters, CPM state secretary Biman Bose says the seat will stay with us.

 Sitting in the small private office attached to her home in Harish Chatterjee Street, Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee is equally confident: she tells an associate the seat will be a gift from my brother.

 In a serpentine lane off Burrabazar, bookies are making a killing from the heavy betting on the Ballygunge Assembly poll.

 The constituency ? a patchwork of languages and religions, where upscale apartment buildings jostle for space with slums ? is set to witness one of this elections fiercest battles.

 I think its fifty-fifty, said Bua Chakraborty, a voter.

 CPM candidate and sitting MLA Rabin Deb had won the seat in 1996 and 2001, by 1,481 and 3,349 votes, beating Mamata lieutenant Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar the last time.

 But Mamatas rakhi brother Javed Ahmed Khan, with his command over a large chunk of Muslim votes, could prove himself a stronger challenger.

 For the CPM, Ballygunge is a key seat. Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee lives and votes here, and has overseen much of the preparations.

 But Khan holds several aces. He has an iron grip on wards 65 and 66 that make up the Tiljala-Topsia belt and boast the largest concentration of Muslim voters; his charity work is well-known. He also has a well-oiled cadre, quite like the CPMs.

 Everyone here knows me personally; they also know my work. I have always kept whatever promises I have made, Khan says.

 The CPM has been going around Muslim-majority areas telling voters they should ask Khan to explain Mamatas links with the BJP. But in the more upscale parts ? Gariahat, Ballygunge Place, Mandeville Gardens ? Khan has been milking the alliance with the BJP to court the Hindi-speaking voter.

 Facing a formid-able opponent, Deb may be banking on how many anti-Left votes Congress candidate Dibyendu Biswas can deny Khan.

 Im actually taking on Buddhababu, Bimanbabu and the other big guns, Khan joked. Rabin comes last.

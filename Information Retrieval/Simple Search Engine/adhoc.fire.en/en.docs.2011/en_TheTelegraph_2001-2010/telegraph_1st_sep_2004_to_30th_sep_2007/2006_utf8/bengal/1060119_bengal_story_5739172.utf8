 Transfer order hits cop vigil on rebels

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Midnapore, Jan. 18: An Election Commission order on transfer of police officers has put authorities in the Maoist-infested areas of Purulia, Bankura and West Midnapore in a spot.

 The poll panel has ordered that police officers who are posted in their home districts or have served at one place for three years or more in the last four years be transferred.

 To implement the order, police authorities have to transfer about 150 officers of the ranks of inspector, sub-inspector and assistant sub-inspector who have been specially trained in anti-Maoist operations.

 An additional superintendent of police (operation), Milan Das, who hails from West Midnapore and supervises action against Maoists in the district, also falls in the category.

 All these officers were specially trained in techniques and the use of sophisticated weapons to combat the rebels.

 Senior police officers pointed out that the new officers to be posted in the three districts would have to undergo such training and familiarise themselves with the terrain, which is not an easy task.

 Banibrata Basu, inspector-general of police, Western Range, admitted that the transfer of the trained officers would create a problem. But we are trying to find a way out. We are trying to make the transfers in such a manner that they remain in the Maoist infested areas, he said.

 We have decided to train the new officers in phases, said Gangeswar Singh, deputy inspector-general of the Midnapore Range.

 Chief electoral officer Debashish Sen said the ECs order applies to all five states going for elections. Unless the matter is brought to our notice, we cant make exceptions. We havent received any information from the administration so far on this score. The transfer orders will have to be brought out by January 20.

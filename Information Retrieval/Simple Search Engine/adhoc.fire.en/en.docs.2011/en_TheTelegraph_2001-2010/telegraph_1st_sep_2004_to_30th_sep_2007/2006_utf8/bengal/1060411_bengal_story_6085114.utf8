The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 A nephew, a niece or nobody

Who: Bilasibala Sahis

What: Minister of state for backward community welfare

Party: CPM

Contesting: Para in Purulia 

 What makes Bilasibala Sahis angry?

Being asked how her family is doing.

 Why, cant she stand her family or what?

Just the opposite.

 Hey, come off it ? whats her problem 

then?

The CPM ministers niece and nephew have bagged 

jobs at schools while most people in Para, the Assembly seat in Purulia she is 

contesting, have none. So shes touchy about pointed questions.

 What does she say?

Why are you asking such questions? she 

screamed at this correspondent. My family members got jobs because of their 

qualifications. I have never doled out favours to my near ones.

 Does anyone believe this?

Yes, some voters said the minister has always been 

impartial and lives a Spartan life.

 Who were they?

Her brother Binod and nephew Shyamsundar.

 No kidding, what about the rest?

Does it matter? Bilasibala claims shell win 

by 60,000 votes.

 Does she have 60,000 nephews?

Of course not. But the people say shell sail 

through because the Opposition, or its uncle, isnt visible anywhere.

Not that Jhunu Mudan of Lodhukra would be able to 

see them if they came to her village.

 Why?

Cmon, shes 72, she can hardly see. Of 

course she still has to sew ? because none of her three sons has a job.

 Why doesnt she get her eyes checked 

at the local health centre?

You must be joking. The primary health centres are 

here only so that patients can be referred to hospitals. Even a woman in 

labour must be taken to the Raghunathpur hospital. Its 17 km from here, 

said Bhiku Hembram at Dhagara.

But forget about Jhunu Mudan, after sundown no one 

can see anything.

 Dont tell me electricity hasnt 

reached Para?

Well, the poles are there but since the villagers 

never had the money to pay power bills, there are no connections. Kerosene is 

Rs 25 a litre.

 Well, at least there are schools. 

Ha ha.

 Hey, caught you out this time. Didnt 

you just say the ministers nephew and niece had bagged teachers jobs?

The primary school at KP Rangadihi, the ministers 

home village, is closed. Many schools have just one teacher. The parents send 

their children for the mid-day meal.

 Hmm, dont the collieries hire people 

from Purulia?

You dont have to be a nephew, but you must be 

close to the CPM to get those.

 Okay, not everyone can sew. What do the rest 

do?

Sufal Mudi and his friends are hired by the panchayat 

twice a year to dig rainwater reservoirs. They get 5 kg rice and Rs 32 each.

 What is the minister saying?

There have been failures on our part. Well 

do something in the next five years.

 Will it work?

It has so far. Bilasibala has been an MLA for 15 years 

and minister for 12.

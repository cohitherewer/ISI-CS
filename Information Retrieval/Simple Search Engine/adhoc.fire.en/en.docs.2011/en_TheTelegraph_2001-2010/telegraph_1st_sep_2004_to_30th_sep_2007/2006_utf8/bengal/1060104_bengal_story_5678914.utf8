 Cops behind locked gates on terror terrain

 Purulia, Jan. 3: On rebel turf, police are on the run. 

 Personnel at an outpost in Bandwan fired at the rebels who burnt to death a CPM leader and his wife on Saturday but refused to give them a chase. But they are not the only ones running from the guerrillas in army gear. 

 Constables to officers, personnel at Bandwan police station lock themselves up in the name of security. Not the villagers, but their own.

 A chain is tied round an iron gate and a lock fitted to it after sun down. 

 The verandah, where the policemen receive complaints is dark and deserted.

 A ray of light slivers through a crack in the wooden door bolted firmly from inside. The policemen are in a huddle, chatting in hushed voices.

 Calls to the personnel go unheard for 15 minutes till one of them peeps out. 

 Not now. Whatever you want, come tomorrow morning, he shouts before locking himself in again.

 The scene is the same across police stations.

 Early on Saturday morning, CPM district secretariat member Rabindranath Kar and his wife Anandamoyee were burnt to death by Maoist guerrillas at Bhomragarh in Bandwan, about 360 km from Calcutta.

 Since then, police stations ? put on alert by their officers in the headquarters ? are in the grip of an even greater fear. Fear of being the next target.

 We start shifting everything into the rooms from the verandah as soon as it starts getting dark. We pack up our files and move the tables and chairs inside, said an officer of Bandwan police station, located on the Bandwan-Purulia road. 

 Just imagine sitting on a verandah and being hit by a bullet from nowhere. We dont get any additional allowances for working in such a high-risk zone, another officer said. 

 Purulia additional superintendent Tapas Ranjan Ghosh said no such instruction of shutting thana doors has been given. 

 Perhaps, policemen are taking precautionary measures after the recent strike.

 Visits to police stations in Boro, Borabazar, Parulia and Bagmundi, about 300 km from Calcutta, revealed that policemen close the gates there, too.

 The district police administration recently decided to close down the Taltol police camp off the Purulia-Manbazar road. 

 The camp in the Ganda police station area was set up to prevent incidents like road robberies. But five months ago, we decided to withdraw it thinking that Maoists might attack policemen and snatch their weapons, a senior officer said.

 A series of raids carried out last night to trace the rebels who killed Kar and his wife has drawn a blank. 

 We scanned the forest areas in Muri in Jharkhand, but our efforts proved futile, said an officer.

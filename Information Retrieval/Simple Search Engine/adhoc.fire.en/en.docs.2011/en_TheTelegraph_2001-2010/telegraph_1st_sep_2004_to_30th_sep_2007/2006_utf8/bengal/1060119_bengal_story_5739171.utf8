The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Woman held for killing lover

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Jan. 18: A jilted woman allegedly shot dead her lover at her residence in Nadia last night.

 Police have arrested Chhabi Majumdar, 35, and Prakash Das, believed to be her accomplice in the murder of 27-year-old Krishna Baidya, a cable operator.

 Krishnas family members said he had a relationship with Chhabi, a resident of Kalyani, 45 km from Calcutta. Chhabi had separated from her husband and wanted to marry Krishna, with whom she became close seven months ago.

 We did not approve of the relationship as we had reports that the woman was of ill repute. Moreover, she was older than my brother. We arranged his marriage with another girl, said Krishnas sister Arati. The marriage was to take place next month.

 Krishna had told Chhabi about his marriage. The woman (Chhabi) then apparently decided to take revenge and hired three persons to kill Krishna, said an officer of the Kalyani police station.

 When Krishna did not return home last night, his father, Gopal, lodged a missing complaint.

 This morning, Krishnas friends went to look for him at Chhabis house and found the body there with a bullet injury in the head and another in the chest.

 Gangarampur, Oct. 11: Fourteen-year-old Rasudeb Bera had left his West Midnapore home to work in faraway Rajasthan to save his family from starvation. 

 Employed as a bonded labourer in an Ajmer zari factory, the teenager would toil from dawn, getting only four hours sleep in a day. 

 In December last year, a glimpse of hope came his way when a West Midnapore police team, along with the Rajasthan administration, raided the factory and rescued Rasudeb and 26 other children. 

 The Rajasthan government gave each of them Rs 1,000, a part of the Rs 20,000 compensation under the National Child Labour Project, and the kids were brought home.

 But since then, they have been waiting for the remaining Rs 19,000 50 per cent is to be paid by the Centre and the rest by the Bengal government.

 Tarun Layek, 14, who was rescued along with Rasudeb, says he has landed from the frying pan to the fire. Had I received the Rs 19,000, I could have started a vegetable business. I am finding it very hard to make ends meet by working as a farm labourer, he said.

 Officials of the National Child Labour Projects West Midnapore chapter said the central funds had gathered dust and had to be sent back. To provide the compensation, we were required to set up a vigilance committee, carry out inquiries and submit a report to the state government. But we did not know about this, said project director Rathindra Nath Sarkar. 

 He added that the panel is in place now and the compensation should reach the children by November.

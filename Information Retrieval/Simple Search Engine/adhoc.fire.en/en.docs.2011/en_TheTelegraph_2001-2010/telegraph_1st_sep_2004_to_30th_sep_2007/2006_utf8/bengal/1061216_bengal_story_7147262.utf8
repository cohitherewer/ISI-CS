 Singur twist to shot at SPs Scorpio

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Singur, Dec. 15: Suspected Naxalites opposed to the Tata Motors factory here had apparently shot at the Hooghly police chiefs car last Saturday.

 The shooting came to light almost a week after it occurred when superintendent of police Supratim Sarkar lodged an official complaint today. 

 He was not in the Scorpio when the bullet pierced the rear windshield and hit the one in front in the Nasibpur area, 40 km from Calcutta and some 7 km from Singur. 

 Western range inspector-general Arun Kumar Gupta, who was with Sarkar in a vehicle behind the Scorpio, said they were travelling from Serampore Walsh Hospital to Singur. We had gone to the hospital to see some reporters who were injured during a police lathicharge on some members of the CPI(ML) Liberation near Sheoraphuli railway station, Gupta said. 

 Gupta said Sarkar took so many days to file the complaint as he was waiting for the forensic report to confirm that a bullet had smashed the windscreen. The report says it was a high-velocity bullet.

 Naxalites had taken part in the attack on police in Singur on the second day of the work to fence off the land acquired for Tata Motors.

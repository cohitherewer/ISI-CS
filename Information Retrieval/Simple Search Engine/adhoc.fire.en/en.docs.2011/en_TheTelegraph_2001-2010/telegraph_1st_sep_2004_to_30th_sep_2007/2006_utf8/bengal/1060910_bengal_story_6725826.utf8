The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Festive facelift for Sealdah flyover

 jam-packed: The crowded Sealdah flyover

 Calcutta, Sept. 9: Durga Puja is round the corner, and its time for the citys roads to get into shape.

 The traffic police department has drawn up a list of arterial roads that need immediate repair to bear the additional load the festive season is certain to bring.

 Topping the list is the crowded Vidyapati Setu better known as the Sealdah flyover that runs around 400 metres from north to south.

 The other busy stretch, Howrah Bridge, is also being repaired. The Calcutta Port Trust got to work last night, a week after The Telegraph reported about the potholed plight of the road on the bridge.

 Transport minister Subhas Chakraborty and finance minister Asim Dasgupta will go on a road-inspection mission tomorrow.

 The stretch between the Mahatma Gandhi Road-Sealdah flyover crossing and Beleghata Road is in very bad shape. There are several potholes towards the NRS Hospital-end and they need to be filled up immediately, said an officer of the Sealdah Traffic Guard.

 The burden on the flyover, which carries traffic from all parts of the city, gets a lot heavier during Puja with vehicles pouring in from the districts.

 The police said unless the potholes particularly the ones along the tram tracks on the bridge are repaired, accidents are inevitable.

 Tram tracks are giving trouble in other parts of the city as well. Bidhan Sarani near Thanthania Kali Bari and Hatibagan, where the tracks are being covered up with concrete, are in a terrible state, said an officer of the Shyambazar Traffic Guard.

 We have asked officials of the Calcutta Tram Company to get their act together but things dont seem to be moving at the desired pace. The ministers would do good to take a look at this stretch.

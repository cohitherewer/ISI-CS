The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Bail after 2 years in jail but no trial

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, Dec. 13: A 20-year-old arrested for alleged links with the Kamtapur Liberation Organisation and charged with waging war against the nation was granted bail by the high court today after languishing in a north Bengal jail for two years without trial.

 Mrinal Kanti Roy, a Class XII student of Dhupguri High School in 2004, was picked up after the officer in charge of a Cooch Behar police station lodged a suo motu complaint against him accusing him of anti-national activities.

 Mrinals lawyer told the court that since 2000, the police lodged 21 cases including one for waging war on the nation against him but not a single trial started.

 The public prosecutor said the charges against him were grave and that he posed a security threat to the state.

 A division bench of Justices D.P. Sengupta and P.K. Deb, however, granted the bail.

 Mrinal will have to meet the Cooch Behar Kotwali police station officer-in-charge every alternate day. 

 Mrinals father, Jagadananda Roy, had been a minister of state between 1962 to 1965, lawyer Sardar Amjad Ali informed the judges.

 Ali also told the court that though his clients name did not figure in the FIR of a riot- ing case, the police issued a chargesheet against him and showed him as absconding.

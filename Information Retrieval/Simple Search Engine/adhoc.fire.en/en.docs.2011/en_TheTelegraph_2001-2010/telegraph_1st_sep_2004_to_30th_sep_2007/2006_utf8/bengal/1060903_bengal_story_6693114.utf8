 Found with girl, cop held hostage

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Siliguri, Sept. 2: Tension ran high in Jalpaiguris Kuripara village this morning when villagers threw stones at policemen who had come to rescue an assistant sub-inspector held hostage in a Forward Bloc office.

 The ASI was allegedly caught in a compromising position with a 14-year-old girl at a doctors home last night. 

 Residents of Kuripara said ASI Utpal Mondal went to the house of Dr Mihir Biswas, an old acquaintance, with the girl and sought shelter for the night. He told Biswas he had accompanied the girl to her uncles place and was now taking her home. 

 The doctor raised an alarm after the ASI locked himself in with the teenager. Villagers broke open the door and dragged them to the Forward Bloc office where they were locked up. 

 When police reached the spot, the villagers demanded that the superintendent of police be called. This led to a scuffle. However, they finally gave in and let the police leave with the ASI and the girl.

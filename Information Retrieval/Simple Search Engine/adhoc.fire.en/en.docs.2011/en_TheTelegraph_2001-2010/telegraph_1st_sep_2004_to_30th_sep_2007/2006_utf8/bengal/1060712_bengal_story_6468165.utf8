The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Showpiece skipped

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 11: The citys showpiece development project, New Town, had to be hidden from the Prime Ministers view today because the arterial road linking it to Calcutta is in a sorry state.

 Rain over the past few days has made it worse, unsuitable for the use of the countrys most important convoy.

 Manmohan Singhs journey from the airport was meant to be through Rajarhat, giving him a taste of Bengals resurgence. But alas! 

 The state of the road in Rajarhat is a disgrace. Plans were afoot to take the Prime Minister through New Town on his way to the city. But we had to request the authorities to change the route as the Prime Ministers convoy cannot be made to travel on such a road, said R.K. Tripathi, the managing director of Housing Infrastructure Development Corporation (Hidco).

 The housing department had commissioned the project in 1993 and it took 10 years to complete. 

 At an Indian Chamber of Commerce programme, the Hidco boss said the government should have left it to experts and not taken upon itself the task of building the road.

 Jyoti Basu inaugurated the Rs 50-crore road in 2003.

 Tripathi said two committees have been set up to investigate possible flaws in the building of the road. They would submit their reports in the next two months.

 The government must do something about the road if New Town is to invite more investment showcasing the existing development, said Rajive Kaul, chairman of Nicco Corporation.

 The 11-km road starts from Salt Lake and ends on VIP Road near the airport.

 It might end up spoiling one of the greatest assets Calcutta has created and Rajarhats potential to change its future, said another industrialist.

 Girl gulps down acid before second abortion

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, May 25: At 20, she had aborted one child and faced the threat of losing another. Shukla Gharami could not take it any more and poured a bottle of acid down her throat on Tuesday night. She died the next morning. 

 Police said the first blow was dealt by her father-in-law who forced Shukla to undergo an abortion, saying he couldnt afford to bring the child up. When she became pregnant a second time, her father told her to get the baby aborted. Then she committed suicide.

 Shukla had fallen in love with Raju Gharami, an unemployed son of a small businessman in Nadias Chakdah, 60 km from Calcutta, two years ago and they got married.

 Trouble started five months later when she became pregnant. Rajus father Phatik told her to abort the child as it was difficult to make ends meet with three unmarried daughters and two jobless sons, besides her husband.

 You cannot afford to have a baby because you are not in a position to take care of it. You are jobless. So your wife must abort the child. I find it extremely hard to provide two square meals to my family, Phatik told his son.

 Raju, who had married against his fathers wishes, did not protest. He persuaded Shukla to get rid of the child and she agreed reluctantly.

 Phatik, 55, then began to badger his son, a Class V dropout, to go out and find work.

 Police said the situation came to such a pass that Raju was forced to leave his fathers house. The couple went to live with Shuklas parents in Nabadwip, about 100 km from Calcutta, in June last year.

 In Nabadwip, Raju rented a rickshaw when he could not find a job. He was soon earning about Rs 30 a day.

 Shuklas father Joydeb Debnath, a weaver with two unmarried daughters and two schoolgoing sons, somehow managed to run the family. But he put his foot down when Shukla became pregnant a month ago. He promptly asked her to undergo an abortion.

 It was very difficult for me to accept the child as I simply would not be able to take proper care of the baby. So I objected and asked her to go for an abortion, Joydeb said.

 Shattered, Shukla drank acid on Tuesday.

 Her husband was not at home and hearing her cries of pain, her father rushed in and raised an alarm. Shukla was taken to hospital where she died yesterday morning, said an officer of Nabadwip police station. 

 Nadia police superintendent R. Rajsekharan said: Shuklas story is very unfortunate. The girl could not accept the fact that she could not become a mother even if she wanted to.

 After Shuklas death, Raju left his in-laws house and has been missing since.

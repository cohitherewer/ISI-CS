The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 EC stick for five poll officials

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 25: The Election Commission today cracked the whip on Bengal, asking its government to transfer the sub-divisional officers of Uluberia and Balurghat and sack two teachers and a secretary of a gram panchayat in Nadia.

 Commission sources said the action was recommended on the basis of the report prepared by the 19 observers who had toured the state to inspect the revision of electoral rolls.

 The poll panel has decided on a zero-tolerance approach to negligent election officials in Bengal.

 The observers had reported glaring irregularities in the preparation of rolls and accused poll officials of dereliction of duty.

 Officials said the election machinery was being fine-tuned in poll-bound Bengal and the punishments would send a warning to other states. 

 The commission has asked Bengals chief electoral officer to ensure that complaints received by district poll officials and electoral registration officers are probed.

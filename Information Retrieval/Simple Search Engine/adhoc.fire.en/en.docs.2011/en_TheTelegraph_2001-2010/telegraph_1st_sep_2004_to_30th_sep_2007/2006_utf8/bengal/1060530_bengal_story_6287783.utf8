The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, May 29: Power supply tripped twice during the chief ministers videoconference with district magistrates this afternoon, plunging Writers Buildings into darkness. 

 The first was at 12.05, for five minutes. As Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee spoke with emergency lights switched on, the power went off again. Slightly irritated, he asked officials why the supply was failing repeatedly. They blamed an internal fault.

 Calcutta: Jindal Steel West chairman Sajjan Jindal met the chief minister on Monday and told him about his plans to invest in automobile parts and infrastructure. He also wanted to invest Rs 5,000- 10,000 crore in power or roads, having failed to set up his Rs 12,000- crore steel plant because of the vicious problem of iron ore linkage.

 Calcutta: Forward Bloc leader Kamal Guha was brought here from Cooch Behar and admitted to a private hospital on Monday following pain in the chest. His condition is stable.

 Barasat: Six persons were arrested on Sunday night for allegedly tak- ing home loans by furnishing false documents.

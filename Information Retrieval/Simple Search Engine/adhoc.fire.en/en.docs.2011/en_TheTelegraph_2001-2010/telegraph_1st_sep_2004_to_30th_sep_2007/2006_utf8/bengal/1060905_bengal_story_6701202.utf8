The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Trekkers and CD have no link: Cops

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 4: Police have established the identity of a couple seen in a steamy video clip, formally debunking a claim that the footage featured Jadavpur University students involved in the Bagmundi trekking tragedy.

 An unidentified person had sent two video clips to the house of one of the three students who died. The police had then said that none of the two persons on the video were among the five students who took part in the expedition.

 Investigators have now found out that the clip featured two lovers who had filed a complaint eight months ago that someone has been circulating VCDs featuring the two. 

 The footage was recorded by the lovers, who said they intended to get married, on a handycam while they were staying in a hotel.

 The tape got leaked when the couple gave it to a studio for processing. The studio owner has been arrested.

 We can now confidently say that the CD has nothing to do with the Bagmundi trekking tragedy. The unidentified sender wrote a letter saying that the two figures on the CD were identical with two of the trekkers (a girl who died and one of the two survivors).

 Experts who examined the CD confirmed that the two figures have no similarity with anyone in the five-member team that went to Bagmundi. None of the students had any link with the CD, an officer of the criminal investigation department said.

 Rajeev Kumar, deputy inspector-general of police (operations), said the CID would contact Calcutta police and collect details of the case.

 The police disclosure came as relatives of one of the girls who died, Arundhati Ghosh, again approached the CIDs Bhavani Bhavan headquarters to demand a fresh investigation.

 They handed over a list of questions that are confusing them. We assured them that our officers will go through the questions and try their level best to clear all confusion, Kumar said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Court cloud on teacher jobs

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 6: The high court today struck down a government directive permitting managing committees of unrecognised schools to appoint teachers.

 Any circular... issued by the government in its executive capacity permitting approval of appointments of organiser teachers is contrary to statute and legally unsustainable, the division bench of Justices Bhaskar Bhattacharya and J.K. Biswas said. 

 Teachers of an organised school a school organised by individuals or a registered society or trust without obtaining government recognition are organiser teachers. Their managing committees are called organising committees. 

 Thousands of organiser teachers across Bengal are waiting for approval of their services on the basis of the circular, which the court has labelled legally unsustainable. 

 In response to applications from organising managing committees, the school education department now conducts a survey and grants approval if they fulfil certain criteria. 

 Once a school is approved, its teachers services are approved, too, and they get to enjoy government pay-scales and a permanent service period.

 The very concept of an organising managing committee in an unrecognised school is non-existent in the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education Act, 1963. An organising committee is a busybody having no legal sanctity... the court said.

 When the act only speaks about managing committees of recognised schools, an organising managing committee giving appointment to organiser teachers is contrary to law.

 However, todays order will not affect organiser teachers whose services have already been approved by the state. 

 The court gave its verdict after hearing a petition by eight organiser teachers of a junior high school in Jhargram, West Midnapore.

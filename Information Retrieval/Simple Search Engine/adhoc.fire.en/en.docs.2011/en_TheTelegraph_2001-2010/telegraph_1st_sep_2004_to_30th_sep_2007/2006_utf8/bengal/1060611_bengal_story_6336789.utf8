The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Trio held for school scam

 VIVEK CHHETRI

 Darjeeling, June 10: Three bank managers who were earlier posted at the District Central Co-operative Bank here were arrested in a swoop across the Hills late last night in connection with the multi-crore DGHC school scam.

 A team of CID sleuths and Darjeeling police officials raided Kalimpong, Pulbazar and Pokhriabong and picked up Suraj Miya, B.B. Chhetri and M. Tamang. 

 The trio had been named in an FIR filed by Anil Verma, chief principal secretary of the DGHC. 

 The Telegraph had first reported the embezzlement of about Rs 5.5 crore meant for development of primary schools across the Hills under the Sarva Siksha Abhiyan.

 The bank officers had come under the scanner after it was detected that they accepted a letter allegedly tampered by Lakpa Rynden, the then DGHC education secretary, where he gave himself the sole authority to operate the Abhiyan account at the District Central Cooperative Bank. 

 The letter did not have the signature of D.T. Tamlong, the then chief principal secretary of the DGHC, which was essential. 

 The bank officials had also cleared the vouchers for withdrawal of money through 30 separate self-cheques issued by Rynden. The Telegraph has documents which show that Miya was involved in clearing the self-cheques on two occasions. Chhetri and Tamang had cleared the rest.

 The cheques should have been credited to the village education committees and should not have been withdrawn through self-cheques. 

 In all, Rs 5.5 crore, which should have been used to develop 128 schools, was cleared through such cheques. 

 The money withdrawn by five members of Ryndens staff has not been traced yet. 

 Miya, who had accepted the tampered letter, said: I had told Rynden to send me a proper letter without deletion of certain words, but despite saying that he would be sending it soon he never did. There was no scam when I was posted there. 

 Miya, the then branch manager of the co-operative bank, had allowed a savings account to be converted into a current account. A current account allows withdrawal of large sums on a single day. 

 The bank dismissed Miya after he got involved in a different fraud case. 

 Today, he was not able to explain why he or the bank allowed the conversion of the savings account into a current account. 

 Miya said he did not have any inkling about any scam as the money deposited was a small amount. The Telegraph has, however, learnt that at least Rs 3 crore was deposited at the bank initially. 

 Rajen Moktan, the CID investigation officer, said the trio was produced in the district court today and they have been granted five days of police remand.

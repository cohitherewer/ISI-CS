 Shells in riverbed

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Howrah, Aug. 12: Hours after the US flashed a terror alert for India on Independence Day, five high-power mortar shells were found in the Hooghly riverbed this morning.

 Two boys from Howrah, who collect coins thrown into the river by devotees at a Shiv temple next to the Jagannath Ghat, found one of the shells around 11.40 am. Residents informed officers of Bally police station, who fished out four more shells.

 These appear to be mortar shells. We have launched an investigation. We have contacted the army and the intelligence branch and requested them to send experts to examine the shells, said Howrah superintendent of police Niraj Kumar Singh.

 An officer said each shell was 23 inches long, 12 inches in diameter and weighed around 35 kg. A preliminary probe suggested they were high-power shells with a range of 4 km.

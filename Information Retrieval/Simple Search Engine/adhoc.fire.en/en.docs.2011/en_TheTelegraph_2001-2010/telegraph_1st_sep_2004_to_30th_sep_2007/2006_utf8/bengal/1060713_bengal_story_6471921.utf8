The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 BSF scanner on scam spiral

 SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE

 Barasat, July 12: The Border Security Force in south Bengal has ordered a probe into a series of financial irregularities involving its officials.

 Auditors detected misappropriation of over Rs 3 crore while inspecting the purchase of office furniture and fodder for cattle seized from smugglers across the border. The documents of the transactions are with The Telegraph.

 The auditors had submitted a report last month to the BSF inspector-general (south Bengal frontier), Somesh Goyal, who ordered an inquiry.

 It is true that some BSF personnel have been accused of major financial misappropriation. One of our officials has even been charged with fraud of nearly Rs 92,000. The official forged the salary documents of some of our officials and placed them as guarantors to take bank loans. We have dismissed him along with a few others for several other financial irregularities. Now we are probing a fresh set of cases, on which I cant comment as an investigation is in progress, he said.

 The IG said that according to BSF rules, officials found guilty of financial irregularities are to be dismissed. Those accused are kept under the scanner and asked not to attend office so that they cannot tamper with evidence.

 According to the documents, a BSF battalion bought fodder for cattle seized near Kalyani in Nadia district. According to rules, the animals have to be fed by the BSF till customs officials auction them off. The customs department later pays back the amount spent on the cattle to the BSF.

 The document says that in 2005-2006, the battalion had sent a bill of over Rs 3 lakh to the customs department. It paid an instalment of Rs 70,000, but the BSF battalion did not record the transaction.

 The report also questions purchase of furniture in 2005-2006 worth Rs 1 lakh for a subordinate officers mess at Alambazar near Dakshineswar. The mess never existed. There is only a mess for superior BSF officers in Dakshineswar, said an auditor.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Survivors kept in custody

 OUR BUREAU

 Bagmundi, July 31: A rickety wooden table stands on the verandah of Bagmundi police station with a wobbly bench in front. On the table is a roll of bandages, a bottle of antiseptic and a packet of glucose.

 For Bappaditya Chatterjee and Kaushik Sarkhel, this has been home for the past three days. 

 The two survived Friday nights mishap in a mountain stream that claimed the lives of two of their mates from Jadavpur University. But the ordeal is not over yet. 

 Sitting on the bench, Bappaditya and Kaushik have been facing a volley of questions from the cops. They have been asked not to leave the police station till Arundhati Ghosh ? another member of their trekking group ? is traced.

 We may need their cooperation any moment for our investigation. This is why we have asked them to stay here round the clock, said Satyanarayan Banerjee, the deputy superintendent of police (headquarters). 

 However, the boys are not alone. A group of 15 students from JU and a couple of teachers have been camping in Bagmundi since Saturday afternoon. Some of them are staying with Bappaditya and Kaushik at the police station. 

 They are very upset as they lost two of their friends. We are here to provide moral support to our friends. It is a time of severe crisis for us, said Arijit Guha. We are taking care of them, supplying medicines, glucose water and proper food.

 The DSP said Bappaditya and Kaushiks families had not arrived. When I asked the two boys about it, they told us that they had requested them not to come as they were safe, he said. 

 Bappaditya is a resident of Kalyani in Nadia district, while Kaushiks home is in Garia in south Calcutta.

 Medic faces molest fury

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Sept. 12: A mob of around 500 people dragged a doctor out of his quarters and confined him to a hospital in Nadias Dhubulia for nearly four hours last night after he allegedly molested and verba-lly abused a 16-year-old girl while examining her. 

 Around 6 pm, the teenager, doubling up in pain from stomach cramps, came to the block hospital with her mother. Residents said Dr Biswanath Burman was not there.

 Unable to bear her daughters plight, Minu Bibi took her to Burmans quarters. After repeated requests, he came to his chamber but molested my daughter while examining her, said Minu. There have been complaints of the doctor molesting other patients over the past year, said Ashok Roy, an angry villager.

 From the hospital, the police informed the chief medical officer in Krishnagar, Mrinal Kanti Biswas, who sent a three-member team that eventually rescued Burman from the seething mob at the hospital. 

 Besides the police inquiry, we have begun a departmental probe, Biswas said.

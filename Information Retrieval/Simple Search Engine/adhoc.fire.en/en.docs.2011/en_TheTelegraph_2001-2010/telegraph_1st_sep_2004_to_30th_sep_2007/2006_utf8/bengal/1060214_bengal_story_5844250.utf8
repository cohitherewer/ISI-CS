Calcutta, Feb. 13: Under fire from the Election Commission, state chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb has convened a meeting at Writers Buildings tomorrow to discuss modalities for executing nearly 60,000 non-bailable arrest warrants not executed for years. 

 The commission has also summoned Deb and chief electoral officer Debasish Sen to Delhi on February 20 for an update on the states law and order situation. Home secretary Prasad Ranjan Roy and director-general of police S.V. Avasthy have also been called.

 Roy and Sen will attend tomorrows meeting that would also discuss how to track down illegal arms and ammunition ahead of the elections. 

 The poll panel had directed the chief secretary to call the meeting after coming to know that only 951 non-bailable warrants had been executed across the state. It had recently observed that the Bengal government had not been efficient enough in dealing with poll-related irregularities.

 On February 20, the panel will ask the chief secretary and the chief electoral officer about the steps the government is taking to ensure smooth polls. The meeting will dwell on the deployment of forces and draw up a detailed requirement plan for CRPF and central paramilitary personnel.

 Till January 24, about 10 lakh names were deleted from the draft electoral rolls and 21 lakh added. The possibility of further deletions remains as a fresh voter verification drive in urban and municipal areas will continue till the filing of nominations. 

 State CPM secretary Anil Biswas said the party is highly satisfied with the work done by the observers in West Midnapore, Hooghly and Nadia. He also tried to clarify that he had not uttered anything defamatory against the observers, saying his stand was that Opposition parties were trying to use them as polling agents as they did not have the strength to put up agents in poll booths. 

 Biswas said there should be a constitutional provision for a rolls revision every year. 

 Regarding the commissions stand that there should not be any party office within 200 metres of the booths, Biswas said all 200 CPM offices and the offices of its registered trade unions would remain closed that day.

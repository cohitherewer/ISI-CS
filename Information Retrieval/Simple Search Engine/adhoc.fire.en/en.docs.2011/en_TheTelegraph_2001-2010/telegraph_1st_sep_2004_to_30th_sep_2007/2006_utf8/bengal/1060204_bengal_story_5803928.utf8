 Judge house under hammer

 Undervalued? Bhagabati Prosad Banerjees house

 Calcutta, Feb. 3: Former Calcutta High Court judge Bha-gabati Prosad Banerjees Salt Lake house will be auctioned tomorrow.

 The Supreme Court had dismissed the allotment of the four-cottah plot in FD block that Banerjee had obtained from the chief ministers quota.

 In its verdict, passed on November 19, 2004, the apex court observed that Banerjee had used his chair for personal gain. 

 A government valuer has fixed the reserve price for his two-storey building and the land at Rs 56 lakh ? Rs 36 lakh for the land and Rs 20 lakh for the building. The auction will be held on and above the reserve price.

 Those participating will have to bid separately for the land and the house. Banerjee will get the money the building fetches. The plot price will go to the government. 

 The auction, to be conducted by the city-based J. Thomas and Company, will be held at Laban Hrad Mancha ? also known as BD auditorium ? around noon. Two joint secretaries of the urban development department will assist the auctioneer.

 We finalised the proceedings of the public auction and the eligibility of the bidders after consulting legal experts. We have invited applications from the public and are trying to make the process as foolproof as possible, chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb said.

 According to the plan, it will be an open auction where the enlisted buyers will quote their prices verbally. 

 Unhappy with the reserve price fixed for his property by a former chief valuer of the Howrah Improvement Trust, Banerjee has moved the Supreme Court. The petition will be heard on February 27.

 No one will believe that the value of a two-storeyed building covering over 4,000 square feet at a prime location in Salt Lake is Rs 20 lakh. The construction cost of any building is more than Rs 600 a square foot, the former judge said.

 A government official said the outcome of the auction will be conveyed to the court.

 From the late 1960s to 1980, land in Salt Lake was allotted through lottery. In 1980, a committee was formed to scrutinise applications and allot land. 

 The quota under the discretion of then chief minister Jyoti Basu was created in 1987. It doesnt exist now.

 Police will throw a security ring around the auction venue tomorrow to control a possible rush of onlookers.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Slave camp with kids and torture marks

 SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE

 Calcutta, April 2: About a hundred labourers, some of them not even in their teens, who were regularly beaten and scalded by their employers were today rescued from two brick fields in Hooghly.

 Police, who raided the kilns at Bhadreswar and Singur ? about 50 km from Calcutta ? accompanied by members of an NGO, said 98 men, women and children from Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand had been kept there as bonded labourers. 

 The kiln officials had fled when the raid was conducted. District superintendent of police Supratim Sarkar said: We had received specific complaints regarding wrongful detention of some labourers and started an investigation accordingly.

 All 98 labourers were not only tortured but denied medical treatment. Even pregnant women and children were forced to work as bonded labourers, said an officer working on the case.

 One of the workers, who had managed to flee the dungeon and get back to his village in Jharkhand, got in touch with an NGO working there.

 They informed us about the racket, said Swapan Ganguly, the secretary of Janasanhati Kendra, which tipped off the police.

 The owners of the brick fields had apparently got these workers by paying Rs 65,000 to an agent, Ganguly added. 

 None of the owners, it is learnt, is a resident of the area. 

 The traumatised labourers have been moved to a house maintained by the NGO at Madhyamgram in North 24-Parganas. 

 One of them, Mohan Singh of Bilaspur, said they were physically tortured by the kiln owners henchmen.

 I was given Rs 100 every weekend to support my family of five, including a one-year-old son. If I ever asked for the money on time, the musclemen told me that they would molest my wife, Singh said. 

 Dasamabai alleged that the torture and molestation had become a way of life for the women. 

 If we ever resisted, they beat us up and then tortured our husbands. We would start work at 3 am and continue till 7 in the evening and then be locked up in our rooms. On Sunday our men would be allowed to go and buy some foodgrain, she said. 

 The police said notices have been served on the brick-kiln managers. The police said they would wait for another day before declaring them absconders.

 Labour minister Mohammed Amin said tonight he knows about the inhuman condition in which brick-kiln workers live across Bengal. He added: The workers, brought mostly from other states, are subjected to torture and exploitation. We have asked officials to look into the situation.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Taslima

 Siliguri, Nov. 25: Organisers of the North Bengal Book Fair here were forced to drop plans of having it opened by author Taslima Nasreen in the face of protests by some fundamentalist organisations.

 When author Bhagirat Mishra lit the lamp at Kanchenjunga stadium today, writers, book lovers and rights activists carrying black flags and wearing black badges rallied against the last-minute decision. Bowing to a fundamentalist group, the local publishers and book sellers association has vitiated the spirit of the fair, said Samar Chakraborty, a writer and teacher. 

 The organisers declined comment.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 EC glare back on list; Anil sniggers

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Biswas: Hitting back

 Calcutta, Feb. 11: The 

 CPM today lashed out at Election Commission observers who 

 had toured Bengal, suggesting in scorn that they might as 

 well double as polling agents of the Opposition.

 On a day the poll panel directed Bengals chief electoral officer to start a fresh voter verification drive in the state, CPM state secretary Anil Biswas criticised the observers for coming here again and again. 

 Instead, they should stay back here and we shall entertain them, he told a rally at Garbeta in West Midnapore, about 180 km from here.

 Ridiculing his political rivals and the observers, Biswas said the Opposition parties do not have enough strength to put up agents in booths. The observers may double as polling agents of the Opposition parties, he added.

 Biswass blast comes in the wake of the commissions decision to have a talk with the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee dispensation following the observers complaints about the governments laxity in dealing with poll-related irregularities. 

 The CPM leader said the West Midnapore observers objection to including the names of former panchayat pradhan Kamal Saha and six of his family members in the rolls, labelling them Bangladeshis, was uncalled for. 

 How could the observer call Saha and his family members Bagladeshis? They have been staying here for over 35 years, he said.

 How many names will they weed out from the voters list? Sixty per cent people in the state vote for us. 

 The Election Commissions order puts the electoral rolls in the states urban and municipal areas on the chopping board again. Till January 24, 9.89 lakh names had been deleted from the list. Officials will also have to take a relook at death registers. 

 The final electoral rolls are slated to be released on February 22. 

 The Election Commission is apparently satisfied with the roll revision exercise in villages, but a question mark hangs over urban areas. 

 On pending non-bailable warrants ? which have put the poll observers glare on the ruling Left Front ? chief election commissioner Debashish Sen said he had sent two reports to the commission and it was found that more than 60,000 warrants were yet to be executed.

 Welcoming the poll panels tough stand, Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee said she was thinking of calling on A.P.J. Abdul Kalam and urging him to impose Presidents Rule in Bengal. 

 On Biswass statements, she said it was an insult to the people of Bengal. This smacks of bad taste. The CPM is trying to terrorise the observers also.

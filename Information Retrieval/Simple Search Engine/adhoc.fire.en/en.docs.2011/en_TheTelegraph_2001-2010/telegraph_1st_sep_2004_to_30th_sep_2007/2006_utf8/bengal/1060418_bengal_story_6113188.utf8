The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Seven villages, turnout zero

 - Poll boycott not for rebels, but politicians 

 PRONAB MONDAL

 Belpahari, April 17: The Maoists couldnt scare them. They neednt.

 Over 900 residents of seven villages in Binpur did not vote on Monday, anyway. 

 The poor villagers were not cowered by extremist threats or bullied into the boycott. They did not vote simply because they knew it would not change their lives. Nothing has changed in three decades, at least.

 Only 8 km from Belpahari town, the villages have no power, no proper road and, in summer, no drinking water. 

 The seven sisters ? Rupai, Parasidanga, Baliguma, Balidanga, Kasidanga, Khoyerdanga and Shalkodanga ? have between them three tubewells that were sunk years ago and half-a-dozen wells. Some of them are already dry. 

 When theres no water left in them, the mid-day meal for children at the primary school is cooked using water from a pond that the cattle use for bathing, Sanjay Mahato of Parasidanga said.

 The nearest health facility is at Belpahari. But in the absence of proper roads, patients have to be carried on makeshift beds. Bad weather might mean death. 

 All 907 voters of the area had assembled at a little Shiv temple at Rupai ? about 220 km from Calcutta ? and taken an oath to boycott todays poll. None of them turned up at Parasidanga Primary School today. 

 No one came here to vote. I spent the day chatting with the four other poll personnel, presiding officer Santosh Kumar Shau said. 

 We were determined not to vote as political leaders had duped us with false promises in 2001, said Chhabinath Mahato of Rupai. 

 The decision was unanimous as the causes of our suffering are the same. The village elders had called a meeting asking all voters to take the oath, said Tiger Das of the same village. 

 About half the voters are women. The water woes probably hit them the hardest.

 A villager, Manoranjan Das, said they had submitted a memorandum to block development officer Aghore Roy on April 10. He visited the villages last Tuesday and said that nothing could be done before the elections, said Das. 

 Shambhu Mandi, the CPM MLA from Binpur, who won by about 10,000 votes last time, couldnt care less about 907. 

 In Dangardiha, where the Maoists killed CPM workers Gumai Tudu and Jaladhar Mahato last month, fear kept voters away.

 Police may escort me to the booth and back. But once the polls are over, who will protect me? asked Kanai Murmu.

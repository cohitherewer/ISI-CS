 Poor marks and flak for ministers

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Jan. 2: With elections knocking at the door, the CPM leadership reviewed ministers performance today.

 Key departments like power, health, higher education and public works, looked after by ministers from the CPM as well as other Left Front partners, apparently came under flak from the CPM state secretariat, the partys core decision-making body.

 At the meeting, which lasted several hours, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee was present all through. 

 We are not happy with the performance reports submitted by the ministers. A drive involving all panchayats and municipalities has to be undertaken to complete development projects in the next two months, party secretary Anil Biswas said. Our ministers have been asked to complete unfinished projects in every district, he added.

 Sources said the leadership pulled up higher education minister Satya Sadhan Chakraborty. The chief minister had criticised him at a cabinet meeting last month for failing to stay in tune with the changing demands of students. He wanted Chakraborty to focus more on modern subjects like IT, biotech and business administration.

 Health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra was asked to ensure better facilities in hospitals and slammed for not carrying out a drive against unwanted persons roaming freely in hospitals in the districts. 

 Power minister Mrinal Banerjee, too, came under fire. He was asked to complete electrification of 700 mouzas (a cluster of villages) by March. 

 The CPM brass also expressed dissatisfaction over the performance of ministers from alliance partners ? the RSP, Forward Bloc and CPI. They hold key portfolios like PWD, food and civil supplies and jails.

 PWD minister Amar Chowdhury of the RSP was rapped for the condition of roads and Bloc food and civil supplies minister Naren De for the failing rationing system.

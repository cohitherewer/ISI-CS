Burdwan, Aug. 23: Angry over doctors refusal to explain why her daughters condition was not improving, a mother allegedly slapped a junior Burdwan Medical College Hospital physician last night.

 The assault sparked a ceasework by junior doctors that is now threatening to put many mothers and other patients at the doctors mercy again.

 Twelve-year-old Sikha Roy, who is suffering from typhoid, was admitted to the hospital on Sunday. 

 Her mother Bina said a team of six junior doctors did not attend to her daughter while on a round in the female ward around 9 pm yesterday.

 When she wanted to know from them why Sikhas condition had not improved, she was told to shut up and an altercation ensued. During the exchange of words, Bina allegedly slapped house staff member Paromita Bhattacharya. 

 The doctors claimed that they had examined Sikha along with other patients in the ward, but Bina insisted that they should explain why her daughter was still running temperature. 

 After slapping Paromita, the girls mother even threatened to hurl one of her shoes at her, alleged Arun Satpathy, another house staff member. 

 Bina has been arrested on the basis of a complaint by the hospital authorities.

 Over 165 junior doctors and house staff members of the hospital, however, are not happy yet. They are still protesting against the slap.

 Hospital superintendent Sarit Chowdhury, who was gheraoed by the agitating doctors, said it was an unfortunate incident, but they should resume duty considering the plight of over 1,000 patients. 

 At the emergency ward, two-year-old Meghnad Dhara was admitted for a minor operation of a boil on his left foot. Doctors on duty operated on a small eruption in his right groin, instead. 

 Meghnads father Sushil was speechless when his son was rolled out of the emergency with a bandage around his groin and thigh. The infected boil was intact. 

 Sushil lodged a complaint with the superintendent. I have asked the head of the surgery department to conduct an inquiry and submit a report at the earliest. The surgeon concerned is yet to be identified, Chowdhury said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Cong leaders in alliance huddle

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Jan. 10: A day after A.B.A. Ghani Khan Chowdhury made it clear in Malda that he would tie up with Mamata Banerjees Trinamul Cong- ress despite her pact with the BJP, senior Congress leaders called on the veteran leader to discuss the alliance.

 Former state party chief Somen Mitra, once an anathema to the Trinamul Congress leader, was among those who called on Ghani Khan at a south Calcutta guesthouse.

 Minutes after the meeting, Mitra said: The Opposition parties should not put up candidates against each other to prevent a split in anti-CPM vote bank.

 Shankar Singh, the MLA from Champdani in Hooghly who had been lobbying for a Congress-Trinamul alliance ? BJP or no BJP ? also met the Malda MP. 

 Fighting the communists together is the only way to ensure their defeat, he said. 

 Congress sources said Ghani Khan might meet Mamata on Thursday night. 

 Asked about the leaderships decision not to have any truck with Mamata until she severs ties with the BJP, Ghani Khan became agitated. I am not bothered about what our leaders are saying. The people of West Bengal want all anti-CPM forces to come together. We cannot ignore this ground reality, he said.

 He said Mamatas relations with the BJP could easily be overlooked as the saffron party is not a force to reckon with in Bengal. 

 Mamata said tonight she is still hopeful of a pre-election alliance. Why should I snap ties with the (BJP-led) NDA to forge an alliance with the Congress? she asked. Instead, let us all come together to strengthen the anti-CPM vote bank.

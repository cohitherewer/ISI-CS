The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Duo stuck in ATM, outsiders smell heist

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 12: Two traders spent three hours trapped in an ATM booth this morning with a crowd outside the glass door baying for their blood thinking that they were there to rob the bank.

 Dilip Koyal and Haru Jana entered the ATM booth of a nationalised bank in Budge Budge, about 25 km from the city, at seven in the morning. The garment traders wanted to draw money on their way to the wholesale market.

 When they tried to pull the door open on the way out, they found it locked. They heaved with all their might, but the door did not open. 

 The queue outside started lengthening and in no time there were about a hundred onlookers wondering what the duo was up to.

 Some residents of MG Road were sure they were dacoits caught in their act. And Koyal and Jana saw to their amazement brickbats, sticks and rods staring at them.

 The puzzled guard manning the booth did not know which side to take.

 We were very scared. But then we thought we would never come out again, said Koyal. 

 They wanted to tell the mob their predicament but the crowd could hear nothing from the other side of the glass door. 

 Shyamal Banerjee, a resident, said: We thought they had entered the ATM booth to loot it. 

 Policemen, who came about a couple of hours after the duo found themselves stuck, informed the bank, which sent two representatives to the spot. 

 The bank officials detected the problem and broke the door open at 10. 

 The two, who regularly draw money from that ATM booth, had to be sent to a nursing home this time. Doctors ruled that they had survived the scare well.

 South 24-Parganas superintendent of police S.N. Gupta said: They have recovered from the shock.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Showdown clock ticks

 BISWAJIT ROY 

Singur, Nov. 29: With paddy harvest almost over and time for sowing potatoes ripe, the CPM and the Trinamul Congress have drawn battle lines for a final showdown over the Tata Motors unit here.

 The CPM organised a show of strength today, getting Left Front partners to rally behind it. The show will continue with Biman Bose, the state CPM secretary and front chairman (in picture on right), asking cadre to camp on the fields to counter the Opposition. 

 Trinamul has already set up camps though they are sparsely populated now with many farmers opting to accept the compensation in lieu of their land to prevent the government from taking possession of the plot.

 Its boundary is likely to be demarcated by the first week of December, Bose and party colleague Benoy Konar said.

 Bose asked front leaders from Hooghly district to organise another rally next week. 

 With the Tata brass making it clear that they are running short of time and the Mamata Banerjee remaining stubborn, the CPM appeared set to flex its organisational muscle. We dont want to take risks. The small-car unit has to come up in Singur. You have to ensure that police do not have to step in. Our peasants wings have to pave the way, Bose said. 

 They (Trinamul leaders) want police to fire so that they can draw political mileage out of it, Konar warned. I want to tell the people of Singur that if the Tatas fail to set up the factory, Bengal will hate you.

 Bose said 947 acres out of the 997 acres earmarked for the project has already been acquired. 

 Alliance leaders like the RSPs Kshiti Goswami, Forward Blocs Naren De and CPIs Nandagopal Bhattacharya did not share the enthusiasm. 

 Goswami cautioned against euphoria over the project. De stressed the need to strengthen agriculture while Bhattacharya warned against losing the Lefts rural base. 

 In the Assembly, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee asked the Opposition to co-operate with the government. 

 I still feel that the police should not have been sent to Singur to disperse demonstrators (led by Mamata in Sept- ember). But the threat of a blood bath is also undemocratic, he said.

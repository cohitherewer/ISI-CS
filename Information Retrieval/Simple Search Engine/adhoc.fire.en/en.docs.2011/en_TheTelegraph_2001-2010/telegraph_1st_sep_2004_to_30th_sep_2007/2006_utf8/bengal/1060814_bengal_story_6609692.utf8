The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 CM meet

 Chennai, Aug. 13: Chief 

 minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee met his Tamil Nadu counterpart 

 M. Karunanidhi and offered to move together 

 on many issues, including education, to get the Centres 

 attention, reports our special correspondent.

 Bhattacharjee raised the need to scrap a rule that requires central environment clearance for projects above Rs 50 crore. He felt that only projects of national importance should go to the Centre for clearance.

 The Bengal chief minister raised the subject probably because Union environment minister A. Raja belongs to Karunanidhis party, the DMK.

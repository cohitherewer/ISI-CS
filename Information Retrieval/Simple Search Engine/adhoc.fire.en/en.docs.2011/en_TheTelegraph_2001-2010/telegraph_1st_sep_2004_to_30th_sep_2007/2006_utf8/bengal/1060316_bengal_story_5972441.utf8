The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Politics in 4 murders

 Suri, March 15: Two Forward Bloc activists, one of them a woman, were shot dead and five others injured in an attack allegedly led by a Bloc-turned-CPM leader in a Birbhum village last evening.

 Chinta Das, 22, died on the spot and Nemai Banerjee, 45, at Bolpur subdivisional hospital. Both were the members of the Blocs Nanoor committee.

 Police said the deputy chief of Nanoor panchayat samiti, Biswajit Singh, who joined the CPM with his associates last July, has been accused of masterminding the attack at Daskalgram, around 240 km from Calcutta. Fifteen people, including Singh, have been arrested and a rifle has been seized.

 The Birbhum police chief said the attack was pre-planned. Rebati Bhattacharya, the district Bloc secretary, alleged that the CPM had planned the murders to get an upper hand in Nanoor, a Bloc bastion. 

 His CPM counterpart, Dilip Ganguly, said the bloodshed was the outcome of an old feud between two families.

 CPM duo: Masked assailants tonight killed two CPM supporters in Jamboni, West Midnapore. The party accused the Jharkhand Party (Naren) of orchestrating the murders.

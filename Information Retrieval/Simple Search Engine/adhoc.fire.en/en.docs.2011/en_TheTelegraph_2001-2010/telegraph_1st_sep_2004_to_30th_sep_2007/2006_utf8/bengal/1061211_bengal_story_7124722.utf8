 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, Dec. 10: Trinamul Congress MLA Saugata Roy lodged a complaint with the Hare Street police station today demanding the arrest of those who posted mock profiles of leader Mamata Banerjee on the Google chat site Orkut.

 One of the profiles has Mamata professing weakness for actor John Abraham. There is also a photograph of him bathing in a river. In the section where messages can be posted, some have criticised Mamatas Singur agitation.

 Krishnagar: A 12- year-old tea stall worker was strangled to death and dumped into a septic tank after he apparently overheard a gang discussing their next strike. Raju Dass body was found in a house not far from his workplace at Coopers Camp in Ranaghat, 60 km from Calcutta, on Saturday night.

 Chinsurah: Baisakhi Mitra, 22, and her four-month-old son were burnt to death after their hut caught fire from a lantern early on Sunday. Police said her parents-in-law managed to come out of the burning hut at Rabindranagar, 70 km from Calcutta, with serious burns.

 Behrampore: Over 20 people were injured when a Behrampore-Fara-kka bus overturned on Sunday while negotia-ting potholes on NH 34. The accident occurred at Chander More, Murshidabad, 270 km from Calcutta. Police said the bus rolled over thrice before landing in a ditch.

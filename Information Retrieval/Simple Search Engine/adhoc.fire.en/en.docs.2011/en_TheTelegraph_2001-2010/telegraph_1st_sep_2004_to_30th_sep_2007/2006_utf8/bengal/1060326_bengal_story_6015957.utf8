 Biswass condition worsens

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 25: The condition of CPM state secretary Anil Biswas deteriorated today, doctors said.

 There has been deterioration in his neurological and cardiovascular state since the early hours of this morning, the medical bulletin said.

 His blood pressure is unstable and is being maintained on drugs. He still remains on ventilatory support. Overall, the condition remains critical, it added.

 Biswas was admitted to Woodlands Medical Clinic on Saturday with massive brain haemorrhage and has been on ventilator since then.

 A CT scan done today showed the clot in his brain had reduced but doctors said it also revealed another stroke.

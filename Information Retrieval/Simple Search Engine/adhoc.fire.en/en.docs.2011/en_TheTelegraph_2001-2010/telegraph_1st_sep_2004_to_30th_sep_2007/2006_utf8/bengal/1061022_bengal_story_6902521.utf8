 Adhir daughter still on ventilator

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Oct. 21: The condition of Congress MP Adhir Chowdhurys daughter Shreyashi continues to be critical, doctors have said.

 Her blood pressure is being maintained artificially and she is still on ventilator, officials at AMRI said today.

 The 18-year old tried to commit suicide on Wednesday by jumping off the top floor of her six-storeyed apartment building at Gol Park in south Calcutta. 

 A CT scan revealed there was no brain haemorrhage. However, there are multiple fractures to the skull bone, said an official.

 Doctors made an intervention and formed a drain in the spine through which cerebro spinal fluid, which was flowing through her nose, would be drained. 

 The drain will be kept for 72 hours and then the fluid will hopefully dry out, the official said.

 Chowdhury, when contacted, said Congress president Sonia Gandhi had telephoned him last night to enquire about his daughters condition. Madam spoke to me for over half an hour to enquire about the progress of my daughters condition, Chowdhury said today.

 He and wife Arpita were a bit relieved today after the CT scan revealed that there was no brain haemorrhage, Chowdhury added.

 Several Congress leaders, including information and broadcasting minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, former PCC chief Somen Mitra and PCC working president Pradip Bhattacharya, visited the hospital last night.

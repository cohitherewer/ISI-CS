 Subhas guns for Tandon

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Malda, Feb. 6: In a vitriolic attack on the Election Commission, transport minister Subhas Chakraborty today alleged that chief election commissioner B.B. Tandon was out to taint the image of Bengal.

 Addressing Citu workers, Chakraborty questioned the rights and limitation of the poll panel. Lashing out at Tandon, the minister said: Whom is he answerable to? Some journalists? He is causing irreparable damage to Indian democracy.

 Some CPM leaders had been vocal against the election panels role in rectifying rolls but this is the first time that a minister has come down heavily on the commission.

 Chakraborty wondered how Tandon, sitting in Delhi, could predict that there would be only a two per cent rise in the number of voters.

 He should keep in mind that he is just a paid employee of the government. Should the paid employee or the peoples elected representatives run the country? he said.

 Quoting a Supreme Court verdict, the minister reminded the Election Commission that Justice Y.V. Chandrachud had said elected representatives, and not paid employees of the government, enjoyed supreme power in a sovereign country. Chakraborty said the Election Commission was issuing fatwas every day to project that democracy in Bengal was at peril.

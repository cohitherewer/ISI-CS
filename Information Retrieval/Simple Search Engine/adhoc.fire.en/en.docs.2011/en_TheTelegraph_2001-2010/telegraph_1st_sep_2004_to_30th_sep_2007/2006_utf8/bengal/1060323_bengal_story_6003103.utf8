The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 ...and defends split polls

 CAPTION

Calcutta, March 22: The CPM may have dubbed the decision to conduct the Bengal elections in five phases wholly unwarranted but the poll panel thinks it was essential to ensure free and fair polls. 

 Moments after the schedule was announced, the party had said there wasnt any law and order problem in the state and so there shouldnt be split polls. Even trouble-torn Kashmir does not have such a long process, it said. 

 However, chief election commissioner B.B. Tandon today made a one-line statement to make things clear: The decision had been taken to ensure free and fair polls.

 A veteran CPM leader had recently said the commission had given certificates to the effect that polls in Bengal had always been free and fair. 

 Tandon pleaded ignorance. I am absolutely not aware of any EC certificate regarding free and fair polls.

 The full bench of the commission, comprising Tandon and election commissioners N. Gopalaswamy and Navin Chawla, has met in the past two days all district magistrates and superintendents of police to review law and order. 

 Tandon met state chief secretary A.K. Deb, home secretary P.R. Roy, director-general of police S.C. Avasthy and city police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee this morning.

 Tandon said the poll preparations were proceeding in the right direction. 

 Asked about the number of central force personnel to be deployed in the state, he said: It will be adequate.

 Although Tandon did not spell out clearly whether photo identity cards would be made a must to cast votes, he said district election officers have been asked to make every possible effort to ensure that all voters get them.

 The chief secretary said at Writers Buildings he had urged the commission to despatch 600 companies of paramilitary forces for proper deployment well before the polls.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Respite still not in sight for Basu

 Basu: Party first

Calcutta, Sept. 13: Ninety- three-year-old Jyoti Basu will continue to be part of the CPM politburo for at least two more years.

 The party requested me to continue, though I am not keeping well. I have agreed. The issue will be settled at our next party congress, he told The Telegraph after a daylong session of the CPMs highest policy-making body.

 The next party congress is scheduled for 2008.

 The veteran leader, who has stopped attending politburo meetings in Delhi, prompting the party to hold them more frequently in Calcutta, had said before the two-day session he would like to quit because of his failing health. But the party had the better of him.

 Yesterday, the party brass said Basus retirement had not been discussed at all.

 Party general secretary Prakash Karat today said the CPM needs his advice and so he would remain in the politburo. We are aware of Jyoti Basus health problems. Yesterday, he requested us to relieve him of his responsibilities. But we still need his valuable advice and experience to steer the party.... Things can be decided at the next party congress in 2008.

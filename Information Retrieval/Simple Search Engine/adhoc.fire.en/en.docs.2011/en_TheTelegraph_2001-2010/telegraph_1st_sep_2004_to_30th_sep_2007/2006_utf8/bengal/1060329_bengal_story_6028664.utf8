The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Officer fires injustice volley at CM

 IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI

 Calcutta, March 28: Less than three weeks to go for the first phase of Assembly polls, a senior IPS officer has demanded Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees resignation, accusing his government of discrimination and withholding his promotion as inspector-general for the last four and a half years. 

 In a letter to the chief minister yesterday, a copy of which is in the possession of The Telegraph, Akbar Ali Khan, now DIG home guard, has alleged that he has been a victim of prejudice by the state government. 

 Venting his ire especially against chief secretary, Amit Kiran Deb, Khan accused him of taking partisan and biased attitude? and blocking my promotion as IG against all rules and norms since December 2001. 

 It is embarrassing. I cannot comment on this, said Deb.

 However, contacted for the second time tonight, the states top bureaucrat said: I dont know anything about it. 

 According to government officials, Khan has a vigilance case pending against him since 2004. The case was initiated after a businessman lodged a complaint with the government that he and his wife had taken Rs 1.5 crore for a Rajarhat plot, an official said.

 In 2002, Khan had moved the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) against the government demanding promotion. He now says the government was offended because he moved CAT. 

 Vigilance commissioner Shyamal Dutta declined comment. I cannot at this point, he said.

 Khan wrote: My wife runs a registered private limited company and I have apprised the government of this. In November 2005, I was asked to appear before a deputy superintendent of (the) vigilance commission. I knew that they have started an inquiry against me only to withhold my promotion and I refused to go. I challenged the businessman to produce a receipt of the money paid either to me or my wife but he failed.

 The chief minister, he added, has always claimed a high moral ground and had in fact once resigned from Jyoti Basus cabinet, but being head of the state, should resign in wake of the injustice meted out to him.

 In December 2003, Khan wrote another letter to the chief minister requesting for the promotion as he stood superseded by about 40 junior officers.

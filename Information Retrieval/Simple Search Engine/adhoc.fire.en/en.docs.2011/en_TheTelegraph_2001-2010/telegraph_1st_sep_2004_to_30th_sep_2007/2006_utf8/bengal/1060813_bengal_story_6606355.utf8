The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Storm in CU over question blunders

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 Calcutta, Aug. 12: If the questions were tough, they wouldnt have complained, but students of Calcutta University wont take mistakes in a question paper lying down.

 A few thousand students who took the BA Part-I (English) honours examination last month have complained to the authorities of their respective colleges about two mistakes in their third paper.

 After an inquiry confirmed the blunders, the authorities issued a circular to all examiners asking them to compensate the students with additional marks.

 Examiners and students have threatened to take up the matter with higher authorities in the government as this is the second consecutive year that mistakes have cropped up in the same paper.

 The matter is serious and we have warned the paper setters to be more cautious, said Sanjukta Dasgupta, the chairman of CUs board of studies in English. 

 The third paper requires students to answer 10 short questions out of 15, each carrying two marks. 

 Questions on Christopher Marlowes Edward II and Richard Sheridans School for Scandal are compulsory. Apart from that, students can choose one of two Shakespearan tragedies Macbeth and Julius Caesar and two comedies Twelfth Night and As You Like It. 

 But those who had opted for the Twelfth Night-Macbeth combination had only nine questions to answer. And for those who attempted As You Like It, one question was wrong. 

 It said: What does Jaques mean by books in the running brooks? The words were spoken by a character called Duke Senior and not Jaques.

 Last year, there was not a single question from Macbeth.

 However, the decision to award compensatory marks to students has teachers worried. Examiners have been told to award two extra marks in the section on long questions to make up for the loss in the short-question part. 

 This is an absurd proposal. It is not possible for an examiner to award extra marks in a subject like literature in this way. The university should take drastic action against those responsible for the mistakes, an examiner said.

 The university must assure us that it would revamp the system of setting question papers. Otherwise, we will have to approach higher authorities in the government for a remedy, an examiner said. 

 Suranjan Das, CUs the pro-vice chancellor, academic affairs, said the matter was being looked into.

 Mollah in Singur to sell car factory

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Singur, Sept. 24: A day after Mamata Banerjee warned of a blockade at Writers Build-ings, land minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah said at the same venue that the Tata Motors unit would be set up in Singur, come what may.

 The minister, who had once opposed the conversion of farmland for industry, was sent here in Hooghly to con- vince farmers about the necessity of industry and the inevitability of land acquisition.

 Some farmers protested by waving black flags.

 Mamata had threatened yesterday that she would stage a sit-in at Writers Buildings during the festival season if poor farmers are deprived of their land, but their land has already been taken over. 

 The government issued a notice yesterday saying 993 acres had been acquired for the Tatas Rs 1,000-crore car plant. 

 We should not forget that nearly 30,000 people would get jobs if the factory comes up here, he added.

 Commerce and industries minister Nirupam Sen had earlier ruled out the likelihood of local people getting jobs in the factory.

 The local people can at best find employment as labourers during the construction of the factory. They will not be able to meet the demands of skilled labour in the new unit, a senior district official said.

 The government may be giving us money, but how long will it last? asked a farmer whose land has been acquired.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 SHORT TAKES

 Kharagpur: Two rallies started about 500 metres from each other here. 

 The BJPs Arun Jait-ley was addressing a modest turnout for Trinamuls Debashish Chowdhury at Giri Maidan. The Samajwadi Partys Amar Singh was also on show, for partyman Satyadeo Sharma. The gathering, modest again. 

 A car rolled in and out rolled Jaya Prada. A touch out of shape compared with the days when Rishi Kapur played dafliwale for her, but who cares? In no time, Jaitley was staring at an empty ground and Ravan Maidan was spilling over.

 Calcutta: The Congress is going 

 Bengali with a vengeance, or so it seems. The other day, 

 AICC general secretary Margaret Alva, who sought a poll 

 manifesto printed in English, was told sorry Madam. 

 Only 50 of them had been prin-ted in English and most were 

 handed out to media crews, a party functionary said.

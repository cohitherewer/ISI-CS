 Delhi nod to Sagar fish port 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 2: Bengal will soon get its seventh fishing harbour ? on Sagar island.

 The Centres clearance for setting up the fishing harbour at Mayabualini on Sagar island ? about 90 km from Calcutta ? arrived today, fisheries minister Kiranmoy Nanda said. 

 Setting it up will require Rs 4.5 crore, which the Bengal and central governments will share. We hope to finish work by 2007, Nanda added.

 The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government will have to shell out another Rs 1.5 crore for related infrastructure.

 In addition to fishing harbours ? another one is coming up at Petuaghat in West Midnapore ? the government will set up food parks to facilitate preservation of the catch for export. We realise that facilities have to be good to ensure good prices for the fish abroad. The parks will be equipped with ice plants, cold-storage and trawler repair facilities and fuelling stations, Nanda said.

 The food park at Shankarpur will be inaugurated tomorrow while the one at Kakdwip will be opened in February. Work on the food park at Sultanpur in Diamond Harbour will also be over by February. 

 With a coastline of only 150 km out of Indias 8,100 km, Bengal is the largest fish producer in the country.

 Over 11 lakh tonnes of fish was netted in the state last year. But Bengal consumes more, over 12 lakh tonnes every year. 

 The shortfall is made up with supplies from Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa and Bihar.

 Bengal also has the largest number of fishing harbours in the country.

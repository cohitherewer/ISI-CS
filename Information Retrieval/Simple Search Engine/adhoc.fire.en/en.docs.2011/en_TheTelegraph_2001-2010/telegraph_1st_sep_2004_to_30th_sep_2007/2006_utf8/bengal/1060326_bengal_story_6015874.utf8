 Baby burial probe

 Calcutta, March 25: The person who had buried a 10-day-old boy in Jodhpur Park had frequent access to the house, police said.

 Officers of Lake police station have been conducting a probe since Wednesday, when the babys body was found on the premises of a two-storey house. 

 The police are planning to question acquaintances of landlady Bithi Ghosh and her tenants, especially their domestic helps.

 Without knowing the layout of the premises, it was next to impossible for an outsider to bury the baby there. He or she either must be from the locality or has access to the house, an officer said.

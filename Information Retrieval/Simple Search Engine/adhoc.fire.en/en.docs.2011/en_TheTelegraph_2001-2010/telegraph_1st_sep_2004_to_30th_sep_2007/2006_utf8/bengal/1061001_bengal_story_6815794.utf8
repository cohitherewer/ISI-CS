The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Flood fury on minister

 OUR BUREAU

 Sept. 30: State industry minister Nirupam Sen was greeted with cries of protest from Trinamul Congress supporters when he visited the flood-affected areas of Kalna sub-division today. 

 Trinamul MLA Swapan Debnath led a crowd of around 50 to raise slogans against the governments inadequate relief as soon as Sen arrived in Kalna town in Burdwan district, 145 km from Calcutta.

 The minister is also the MLA from Burdwan (south).

 Over 50,000 people are spending sleepless nights under the open sky as their houses were washed away in the flood. But the government has sent scanty relief for them, Debnath said. 

 Sen asked district magistrate Manish Jain and sub-divisional officer Srikumar Chakraborty to ensure that relief materials reach the affected people without delay.

 The minister also directed Jain to serve showcause notices on a doctor and his assistant in a primary health centre in Kalna for allegedly being absent for the past few days. Any complaint regarding health officials should be immediately addressed and, if proved guilty, stringent measures will be taken against them, Sen promised. 

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee visited flood-hit areas in Arambagh in Hooghly this afternoon. Those who have lost their homes would get a compensation of Rs 4,000 while those whose houses have been partially damaged would be given Rs 2,000, Bhattacharjee said.

 Farmers, too, will receive aid as the aman paddy crop has been completely destroyed by the floodwaters. The government will also bear the expenses of running relief camps, he added.

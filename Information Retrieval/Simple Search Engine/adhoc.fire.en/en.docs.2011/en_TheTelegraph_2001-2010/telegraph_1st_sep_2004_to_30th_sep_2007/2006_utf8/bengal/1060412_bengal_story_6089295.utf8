The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Property sits heavy on communist shoulders

 - Development gets personal meaning

 ANINDYA SENGUPTA

 Purulia, April 11: Being a communist who should not be paying obeisance to private property, Nikhil Mukherjee finds it hard to hide the taint of fortune despite his spotless-white pajama-panjabi. 

 The MLA admits that his two-storey house in the heart of the town is valued at over Rs 25 lakh, but insists that he inherited it. His wife, married sister and sons ? Babin, 32, and Sanku, 26 ? have equal shares in the building and so he merely owns a fifth of it.

 Its a difficult explanation for ordinary voters. Dont look at my house, look at my development work, the CPM MLA would have hollered from the rooftop, if that worked. We will build 30-bed hospitals in several parts of the district? several schools have already come up.

 But there is really not much to show. Patients still flock to neighbouring Jamshedpur for treatment, though there is a 500-bed hospital in the town, about 350 km from Calcutta. The roads are bad. The bus terminus, which handles over 400 vehicles everyday, has one working tubewell. If there are no power cuts, voltage fluctuations cripple Purulia.

 Mukherjee entered the Assembly for the first time in 2001, replacing schoolteacher wife Mamata, who had been the local MLA for 15 years before that. 

 After five years, he confesses that a tough contest is in the offing and blames it on the peoples rising aspirations. I am contesting from the district headquarters. That makes it difficult, he says. And adds: But please dont pay heed to the Opposition propaganda that I have amassed huge property.

 His father worked in a colliery and mother bought the house with his money, says Mukherjee, whose only occupation is politics. How can I be blamed if my parents gave ornaments to my wife? I am the only son. Moreover, my wife has been teaching for years, he adds. 

 But Mukherjee also has a five-and-a-half-cottah plot where he is building a house for his sons. And he has set aside property for them to start their own business.

 Exhausted trying to attribute ownership to all of them, he says: Why dont you look into my rivals property? He has more than I have. 

 This brings the Congresss Sukumar Roy, a doctor, into the picture. An MLA from 1982-87, Roy asserts that age isnt a factor, even at 72. Had I not been confident of winning, I wouldnt have contested. 

 He scoffs at his rival for branding him a rich man. Roy apparently has only Rs 50,000 in the bank and 14 bighas of farmland. I attend to 25 patients a day. Ten pay my fees ? Rs 50. For the rest, I am a social worker, he says.

 Sufal Barik, 42, who owns an electrical goods shop in the town, says: It appears that the CPM has become wealthier, Nikhil Mukherjee or no Nikhil Mukherjee.

 Young rickshaw-puller Maheswar Raut, too, thinks the lal (red) party has looked after itself and its leaders, not the poor like us.

 District CPM leader Manindra Gope says: Despite the canards, we will win.

 He (Mukherjee) has been trying his best to improve power supply and health facilities, says Ganesh Mahato, leading a cycle rally.

 In 2001, Mukherjee had won by 5,500 votes.

 A grassroots-level deal between Congress and Trinamul Congress workers has, however, made the Opposition hopeful. 

 Trinamuls Barik Mahato, 64, a retired headmaster, now owns a telephone booth, bookshop and photocopy counter and is more occupied with business than campaigning.

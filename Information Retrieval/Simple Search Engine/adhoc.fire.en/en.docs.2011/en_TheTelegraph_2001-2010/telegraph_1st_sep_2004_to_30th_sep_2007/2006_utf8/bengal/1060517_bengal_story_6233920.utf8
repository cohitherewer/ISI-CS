 Fun wrap with sari turns a killer

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, May 16: A 10-year-old boy strangled himself to death this morning trying to entertain his brother by wrapping a sari around himself.

 Dipan Sarkar, a Class V student of the local primary school, was alone in the house with his brother Siphon, 7, when the accident took place at Suti village in Nadias Chapra, about 130 km from Calcutta. 

 Their parents, Prabhat and Dipali, were killed in a bizarre turn of events seven years ago. Prabhats mother Tumpa allegedly threw a bucketful of acid at them. 

 Siphon, then only two months old, was in his mothers lap. His left arm had to be amputated. The right side of his face still bears burn marks.

 Tumpa was arrested along with her two other sons, Srikanta and Subhas, on charges of murder but was later released on bail. A feud over property was said to be the reason behind the attack. The trial is now on at the district court in Krishnagar town, about 85 km from Calcutta. 

 Since then, Dipan and Siphon had been staying with their maternal grandmother, Sadhana Ghosh, in her house. 

 Sadhana, 55, a widow, works as a domestic help to bring up her grandsons. Against all odds she got the boys admitted to school, said Shampa Halder, a neighbour. 

 Around 8 am today, Sadhana went to attend the trial, leaving Siphon in his brothers custody. 

 Dipan caught hold of one of Sadhanas saris hanging on the clothesline and started wrapping it around himself. Siphon giggled and shrieked in merriment and Dipan did it over and over again. 

 Unknowingly, he got entangled in the sari and it tightened around his neck, Nadia superintendent of police R. Rajsekharan said. 

 Shampa said she rushed to Sadhanas house when she spotted Dipan struggling to get rid of the sari. Siphon was still laughing, not realising what had happened. When I freed Dipan from the sari, he was gasping. I called other neighbours and rushed him to the hospital but he died soon after.

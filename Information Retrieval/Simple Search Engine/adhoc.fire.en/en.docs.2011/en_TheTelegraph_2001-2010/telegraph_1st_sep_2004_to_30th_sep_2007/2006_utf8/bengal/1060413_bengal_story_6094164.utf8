The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 BRIEFS

 Kharagpur: An MP is a transformer ? not social, but electric ? and an MLA, a bulb. One cannot perform minus the other. 

 This was railway minister Lalu Prasads argument in favour of the RJD candidate here, Prem Chand Jha. You have voted for Probodh Panda to make him an MP. Now if you dont vote for my candidate, how will there be light? he asked. Panda is the CPI Lok Sabha mem- ber from Midnapore. Lalu is a Left ally, but the CPI had opposed it in last years Bihar polls. The self-admitted joker, however, gave that a pass. Yes, I am a joker. But I am also a jadugar (magician), he said. 

Krishnagar: As three alleged offenders stood before police, 

an officer asked: Any of you a candidate? One of them stood out and 

the officer let him go. This is how the scene would have appeared on stage had 

the election drama been enacted with a pinch of humour. Naresh Chaki, Trinamuls 

Chakdah candidate, had been named in an FIR filed by Nadia poll officials, whom 

he gheraoed on Monday protesting against the deletion of names from voter lists. 

Two of Chakis aides were held, but the officer spared him because he thought 

it would give him more publicity. The officer said: His nature is to make 

a mountain out of a molehill.

 Bankura: Another male domain has fallen and again for the good. In Bankuras Ranibandh, about 250 km from Calcutta, more than half the 71,212 voters are women. That is how the gender ratio should be, but the normal is often rare. CPM nominee Debalina Hembram, the lone woman in the fray, is confident that the fair voters would see her through.

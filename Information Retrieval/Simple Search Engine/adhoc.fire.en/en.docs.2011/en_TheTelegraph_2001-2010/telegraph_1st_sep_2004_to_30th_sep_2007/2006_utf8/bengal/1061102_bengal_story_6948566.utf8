The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Teacher suicide for headmaster

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Santiniketan, Nov. 1: A schoolteacher committed suicide yesterday, unable to bear the harassment by his headmaster, who owed him Rs 40,000.

 Sukhen Saha, 52, left a note blaming Sandip Bhattacharya for his death.

 Police have started a case against the headmaster of Kabirpur High School, who could not be traced today.

 Sukhen, a Bengali teacher, consumed poison in the staff room around noon.

 After taking the poison, he started feeling ill and gradually collapsed. Colleagues rushed him to Suri Sadar Hospital, where he died around 3 am today. The hospital informed us about the death. We found the suicide note in his shirt pocket, a senior officer said.

 Sahas widow Sushama alleged that the headmaster was refusing to return the money he loaned from her husband and was mentally torturing him. The headmaster took Rs 41,500 from my husband over a year ago, but he only gave back Rs 1,500. When my husband wanted the rest, the headmaster tried to corner him in school to make him stop asking for the money.

 On returning home, at Sonaitala near here about 240 km from Calcutta on Monday, Saha was unusually quiet. He did not speak... he went to sleep alone and locked the room from inside. He must have carried the pesticide to school, Sushama said.

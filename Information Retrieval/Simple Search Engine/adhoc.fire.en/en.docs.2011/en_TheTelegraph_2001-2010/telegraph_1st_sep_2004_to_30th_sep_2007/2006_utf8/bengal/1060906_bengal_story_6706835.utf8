The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Bypolls bring down Cong-Trinamul wall

 BARUN GHOSH

 Calcutta, Sept. 5: In May, they were trying to upstage each other. In September, they are drawing strength from each other.

 Congress and Trinamul Congress workers are taking on the CPM together and attributing their new-found enthusiasm to their leaders bid to bury differences. 

 Mamata Banerjee is still part of the BJP-led NDA, but that has not prevented the Congress brass from paving the way for an informal understanding with her party, something they had refused to do before the Assembly elections.

 Wiser after the drubbing at the hands of the CPM, both have let bygones be bygones. 

 In Purulia, a seat that fell vacant with Forward Bloc MP Birsingh Mahatos conviction for rape, Trinamuls Haladhar Mahato is campaigning for the Congresss Shantiram Mahato. Haladhar and Shantiram were rival candidates for the Joypur seat in May.

 Gone are those days when I would be pitted against Shantiramda, Haladhar said. 

 Trinamul has not fielded a candidate in Purulia this time to prevent a split in Opposition votes.

 Bypolls to the Purulia, Katwa and Malda Lok Sabha constituencies and the Bongaon Assembly seat would be held on September 16. In all the places, it is a straight fight Left versus Opposition candidates.

 Although no official communication on a joint campaign has reached us yet, we are working together, said Samiran Roy, the Purulia Congress secretary.

 It is the same in Katwa, where the Congress has not put up a candidate in favour of Trinamuls Sushanta Ghosh.

 Mamatas nominee would wrest Katwa this time, we are fighting for it united, said Rabin Chatterjee, the Congress MLA from Katwa, Burdwan.

 Chatterjee, who discussed a joint campaign with Trinamul district president Swapan Debnath yesterday, said pressure from the rank and file had been mounting on the leadership to put up a united front. 

 Mamata had taken the first step towards the alliance by deciding not to field a candidate in Malda, a seat that fell vacant with the death of veteran Congress leader Ghani Khan Chowdhury. The Congress has fielded Ghani Khans brother Abu Hossain this time. 

 We have got a fresh lease of life after Mamatadi decided to back us in Malda, Shyama Majumdar, a Congress member of the Srikhanda village panchayat in Katwa, said. 

 Anjali Saha, a Trinamul worker in the Left stronghold, said: It is time for the CPM to feel concerned. 

 Veteran CPM leader Jyoti Basu scoffed at the suggestion: They had fought the 2001 Assembly polls together, but did not even get a hundred seats in the 294-member House.

 But Trinamul and Congress leaders believe that on a smaller field, the result could be different.

 Malda Trinamul president Dulal Sarkar said talks on a joint campaign are on. He, too, cited pressure from grassroots as a reason for the tie-up.

 In Bongaon, Trinamul candidate Saugata Roy said local Congress leaders are already working for him.

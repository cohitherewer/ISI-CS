 Teachers job after 20 years

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 5: A 50-year-old man got a primary school teacher job in the courtroom today, some two decades after he should have got it. 

 Syed Taher Ahmed of Panchla in Howrah had worked for a census and, according to rule, should have featured on the district primary school councils panel for new teachers in 1987. 

 When his name did not figure on the list, Taher dragged the Howrah primary school council to court.

 Justice N.K. Mitra issued an order on April 17, 1987, asking the chairman of the school council to include the young graduates name on the panel. 

 He mentioned that Tahers age should not be a bar during his appointment.

 In November that year, the council sent a letter informing Taher that his name would figure on the next panel. For the next 16 years, no new panel was announced. 

 When the council announced one in 2003, Tahers name was not there. He moved high court again.

 The council told the court that he could not be recruited because he was past 35.

 Lawyer Uttam Majumdar, who appeared for Taher, said: Taher then filed a supplementary affidavit showing Justice Mitras order.

 The school council today handed Taher an appointment letter in front of Justice A.K. Roy. The respondent (education department) should be more sincere in carrying out the courts orders, the judge said. 

 In March, he had found the chairman of the Howrah primary school council guilty of contempt of court as he did not issue the appointment letter to Taher despite an order directing him to do so.

 In Tahers case, the government would neither have to pay arrears nor any compensation, but a senior finance department official said last year alone it had to shell out Rs 2 crore for delayed payments to school employees following high court orders.

 Taher had registered his name with the employment exchange in 1972.

 Pirates kill Sunderbans fisherman

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Feb. 26: Forty-five year-old Badal Das was killed and four others were injured when pirates opened fire on a group of fishermen in the Sunderbans last night.

 Police said the fishermen were returning after fishing in the deep sea when they were attacked by the pirates on Raimangal river near Garankati, 120 km from Calcutta.

 The injured fishermen were admitted to Raidighi block hospital. Sunderbans affairs minister Kanti Ganguly reached there later in the day. One of the injured fishermen was shifted to M.R. Bangur Hospital in Calcutta as his condition deteriorated.

 A fortnight ago, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had said that the Border Security Force and the district police would be strengthened to thwart pirates in the Sunderbans.

 The secretary of Kakdwip Fishermens Association, Tejen Das, said: The chief ministers assurance has proved to be futile. We feel insecure.

 Front names candidates for RS polls

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, March 9: Two CPM Rajya Sabha MPs have been denied renomination by the party for the upper House polls scheduled later this month.

 CPM MPs Dipankar Mukherjee and Nilotpal Basu will not be sent to the Rajya Sabha for the third time. 

 Left Front chairman Biman Bose said the CPMs decision is in keeping with the partys stand that its Rajya Sabha MPs would not be given more than two terms.

 Former CPM MP Mainul Hasan, Citu secretary Tapan Sen and Suraj Pathak, son of former MP Ananda Pathak, will contest the elections on CPM tickets, while Barun Mukherjee will be the Forward Bloc candidate.

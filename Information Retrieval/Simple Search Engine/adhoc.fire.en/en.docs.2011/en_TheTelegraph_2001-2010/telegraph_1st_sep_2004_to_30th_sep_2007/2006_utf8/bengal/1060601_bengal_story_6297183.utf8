 Fronts farmer leaders fall in line

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, May 31: Having placated the senior leaders of its alliance partners, the CPM today roped in the peasant wings of the Forward Bloc, RSP and CPI to ensure smooth acquisition of farmland for the Tatas small-car unit.

 We all today unanimously endorsed the governments compensation package for farmers from whom the land will be acquired for the Tata project at Singur in Hooghly, Samar Baora, the secretary of the CPM peasants wing, Krishak Sabha, said after the meeting.

 There was disquiet among the Left Front partners about the Tata Motors project not only because of last weeks demonstration by villagers when a team of company officials went to Singur, but also because of the perceived communication gap within the front. 

 Sources said todays meeting of the four most important peasants wings of the front was called at the instance of Alimuddin Street mandarins, who wanted them to toe the governments line on the land acquisition.

 The Tatas want 1,000 acres at Singur for their Rs 1,000-crore car plant.

 Observers said unity among members of the fronts peasant wings is essential to counter the continuing protests by some farmers owing allegiance to the Trinamul Congress. 

 The disgruntled farmers will submit a memorandum to the Singur block development officer tomorrow. 

 Baora said there is no division of opinion among the front members on the acquisition of land. The peasant leaders today rallied behind the governments move to acquire land for the Tata project paying a hefty compensation. 

 He added that farmers owning multiple-crop land are also coming forward to give up their holdings because they want industrialisation. 

 Farmers do not want their children to confine themselves to agriculture.

 Yesterday, commerce and industries minister Nirupam Sen addressed over 300 farmers in Singur to explain the compensation being offered. 

 The land will be acquired at 30 per cent over the market rate with an additional 10 per cent for those who sell voluntarily. 

 Sen received pledges for some 200 acres yesterday, Baora claimed. 

 At todays meeting in Calcutta, Ashok Chowdhury, president of the RSPs Sanjukto Kishan Sabha, suggested that the government should also arrange jobs in the Tata project for those who depend entirely on their land for livelihood.

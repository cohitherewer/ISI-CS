 School closed

 Krishnagar, Aug. 21: Students and teachers of Rajlakhsmi Kanya Vidyapith in Nadia today forced the school shut in protest against the suspension of its headmistress.

 Krishna Bhowmik was suspended on Friday for not allowing male members of its managing committee to enter the premises during class hours. 

 A stickler for rules, she thought the managing committee men should be treated like others, for whom the school door was closed till 4.30 pm. The committee felt insulted by the decision.

 This morning, nearly 1,200 students and over 30 teachers reached the school in Harin-ghata, 45 km from Calcutta, on time but marched out at 11 am after shutting the classrooms and locking the main gate. 

 Such a good and disciplined teacher cant be shown the door, said Rupali Bhattacharjee, a teacher.

 Nadia inspector for schools (secondary) Subhendu Ghosh said: Bhowmiks action does not call for a suspension.

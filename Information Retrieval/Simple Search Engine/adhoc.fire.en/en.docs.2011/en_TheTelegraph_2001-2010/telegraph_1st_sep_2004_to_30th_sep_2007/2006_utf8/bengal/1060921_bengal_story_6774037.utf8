 Subhas 5 on slim route

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 20: Transport minister Subhas Chakraborty, who had been opposing any move to restructure his ailing transport undertakings, has finally relented and agreed to a study on streamlining them. 

 The transport minister had stalled the move over the past year. He has finally agreed to the study. We will float tenders soon to select the consultants, a senior transport department official said today.

 The findings of the study, which will suggest ways to cut costs and turn around flabby corporations, will be available early next year, said public enterprises and restructuring secretary Ardhendu Sen.

 The five transport corporations the Calcutta Tramways Company, Calcutta State Transport Corporation, West Bengal State Transport Corporation, South Bengal State Transport Corporation and North Bengal State Transport Corporation get Rs 24 crore as subsidy every year.

 The second phase of the restructuring of public sector units sponsored by the UKs department for international development (DFID) is set to begin soon, with Delhi having cleared the proposal last week. 

 In the first phase, 6,000 employees had been given early retirement. Nearly 12,000 employees are likely to be given early retirement in the second phase. 

 The DFID completed its review of the first phase of restructuring today. Of the 34 PSUs taken up, 21 were shut down, four were retained and three, including Great Eastern Hotel, were sewn up in joint ventures with private partners. The fate of six is yet to be decided.

 DFID officials have promised us clearance from their ministry in the UK by December. The actual second phase of restructuring will begin then, Sen said. 

 The transport corporations will now join the list of units being laid on the restructuring table. 

 A preliminary study of the power department undertakings the West Bengal State Electricity Board and the Durgapur Projects Ltd by PricewaterhouseCoopers is almost over and talks are on with the unions regarding layoff and redeployment.

 The state has sought Rs 700 crore from the DFID for the Rs 900-crore exercise. 

 Consultants have already been appointed to study the state of 26 other PSUs, including four dairies. They will submit their reports in two months. Officials of PricewaterhouseCoopers, which is also studying the dairies, visited Haringhata today.

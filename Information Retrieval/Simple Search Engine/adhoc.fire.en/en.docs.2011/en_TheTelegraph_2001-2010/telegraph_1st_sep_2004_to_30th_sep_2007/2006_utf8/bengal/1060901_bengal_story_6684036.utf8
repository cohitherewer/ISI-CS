 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Durgapur, Aug. 31: Fifteen-year-old 

 Sriparna Banerjee committed suicide last night after her 

 parents did not to take her out for Puja shopping.

 The Class IX student of Carmel School hanged herself with a dupatta from a ceiling fan at her home in the Bidhannagar Housing complex under the New Township police station, around 200 km from Calcutta.

 Sriparna had been pestering her mother to take her out for shopping. Sriparnas father Aloke Banerjee, an employee of Graphite India, said: I told her we would go for shopping in September after getting my salary. But on returning from school yesterday, she was adamant that her mother take her for shopping. She had to scold Sriparna.

 When I came home, we again assured her but she threatened to commit suicide. We ignored her, not realising that she would take her life over the issue, said a devastated Aloke.

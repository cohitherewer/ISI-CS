The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 People way for clean-up

 JAYANTA BASU

 Calcutta, July 14: A high court-appointed committee has decided to look for social solutions to improve the condition of the Ganga instead of only framing regulatory strictures.

 Members of the committee had taken a boat ride on the river last Saturday to monitor pollution and realised that rules were being flouted with impunity.

 The river is being constantly polluted from many sources and we need a cost-effective solution, said Biswajit Mukherjee, the convener of the panel and senior law officer of the state pollution control board.

 A social solution is being sought because, as Mukherjee said, discharges like those from brick fields and cowsheds reflect a social problem. Awareness against industrial pollution, too, has to come from peoples initiatives.

 The committee members, who came across dumping of solid waste, pouring of untreated effluents and even encroachment on the river, asked Victoria Jute Mill of Bhadreswar, Godolpara Jute Mill of Chandernagore and Indian Rayon and Textile of Rishra ? all in Hooghly district ? to appear before them on Wednesday. 

 Representatives of Victoria Jute Mill, which had allegedly built pillars on the river and was filling a portion of it with waste, passed the blame on to Bhadreswar municipality. That charge is now under probe. 

 We have asked the Godolpara Jute Mill to pay a fine of Rs 1 lakh for spewing solid waste into the river. We have also asked them to clear the place in a fortnight. Indian Rayon and Textile has been asked to upgrade its effluent treatment plant by July 31, said environmentalist Subhas Dutta, also a committee member.

 Dumping of municipal waste ? whether it is at Rishra or Bhadreswar ? is also a dangerous trend, a panel member added.

 After several hundred crores were spent on the rivers clean-up over the past two decades under the Ganga Action Plan, the state pollution control board had found that the faecal contamination of its water was at least eight times higher than the permissible level for bathing.

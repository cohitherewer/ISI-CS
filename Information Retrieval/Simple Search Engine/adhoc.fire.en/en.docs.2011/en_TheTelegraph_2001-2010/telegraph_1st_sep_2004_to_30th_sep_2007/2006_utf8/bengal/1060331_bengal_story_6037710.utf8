 Son murders widows lover

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Suri, March 30: Unable to bear the sight of his widowed mother in bed with a man, a 26-year-old youth beat him to death at a village in Birbhum.

 Dudhkumar Mondal had been absconding for six days till he decided to give up in the Bolpur additional chief judicial magistrates court today.

 I lost my senses when I saw the man sleeping with my mother. I beat him with a rod. I know I have committed a crime and decided to surrender, Mondal told the court. The judge remanded him in two weeks judicial custody.

 Mondal was booked on the charge of killing Gopal Mete, 44, also a resident of Kurgram in the Nanoor area of Birbhum district, 220 km from Calcutta. Police are looking for Mondals three friends present with him on March 24, the day of the incident.

 After Mondals father died four years ago, his mother Annapurna, 43, developed a relationship with Mete, a widower, police said.

 I had repeatedly asked my mother to stop the relationship but in vain. I also sought the intervention of villagers but no one came forward. I could not tolerate seeing them (his mother and Mete) together in bed, Mondal told the court.

 CPM seethes at office raid

 OUR BUREAU

 Midnapore/Calcutta, April 6: The Election Commission today conducted an inquiry into a raid by security forces on the CPM office in West Midnapore even as the party lodged a complaint with chief election commissioner B. B. Tandon.

 This is another instance of blatant and illegal misuse of power by the observer concerned ?. We do not know whether the observer has any executive powers to order such a raid ? Neither do we know if this raid was authorised by either the returning officer or the chief electoral officer or the commission itself, CPM central secretariat member Nilotpal Basu said in the complaint.

 Deputy election commissioner R. Balakrishnan, on a visit to West Midnapore today, said reports on the raids on the CPM office in West Midnapores Keshpur would be submitted to the Election Commission shortly.

 We have received a complaint from the CPM and discussed the matter with the observer concerned. We have received reports from the district magistrate and the superintendent of police, which will be sent to the chief election commissioner, he said.

 In his letter to Tandon, Basu said: The action objectively reveals an inclination to malign our party and terrorise our workers, sympathisers and people at large on the basis of charges by the Trinamul Congress.

 Earlier, too, the CPM had complained about the conduct of some observers, he added.

 CPM state secretary Biman Bose had yesterday condemned the raids, describing them as one-sided, undemocratic, unnecessary, and dictatorial.

 Balakrishnan and another deputy election commissioner, Ananth Kumar, arrived in Midnapore town today to review preparations for the polls and security arrangements. Chief electoral officer Debashis Sen accompanied them. West Midnapore, Purulia and Bankura go to polls on April 17.

 Balakrishnan said he had sought a detailed report from the district administration on the seizure of illegal arms. He also reviewed law and order in the district with senior police officers.

 He said that the borders of the Maoist-infested West Midnapore, Bankura and Purulia with neighbouring Jharkhand and Orissa would be sealed on the day of polls. Ananth Kumar will co-ordinate with the administration of the districts on the day of polling.

 District officials said the deputy election commissioners also instructed the police to arrest those against whom non-bailable warrants are pending.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Nod to online registration

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 7: Calcutta 

 High Court today put its seal of approval on the state governments 

 decision to computerise its 149 registration offices. Tenders 

 can now be invited for the project.

 Justice Soumitra Pal said the court would not intervene on the basis of a petition challenging the governments decision. The suit was filed by the proprietor of a photo-copier outlet in East Midnapores Contai, nearly 200 km from Calcutta. 

 The petitioner argued that computerising registration offices would hit shops offering photo-copying services in the state.

 Copies of documents are needed for filing volumes in registration of deeds. Volumes are sheaf of official papers land records, company shares or other documents required for registration.

 Using computers will obviate the need to file volumes. Data will merely have to be fed into the computer after comparing it with the original. 

 The judge, however, told the state government that the petitioner should be allowed to participate in the tender process. 

 Appearing on behalf of the state, advocate-general Balai Ray and additional government pleader, Sanjiv Srimani, said the computerisation of registration offices was part of the egovernence plan in 14 departments under Mission Mode Project (MMP). 

 The project is being run by the state governments department of information technology.

 The cost of the project has been estimated at Rs 72 crore, Ray said, adding the state government had already sent a report on it to the Centre.

 Computerisation of registration offices involves massive preparation. This is related to procurement of hardware, software, up-gradation of offices, training of employees, setting up of regional offices and monitoring infrastructure. All these are time-bound and cannot be delayed, the advocate-general (AG) said.

 If a court order disrupts the process, the program will collapse. The state will lag behind those that are taking financial assistance of the Centre, the AG added.

 Ray said the World Bank has been funding various projects in the state, whose modernisation programmes are reviewed while sanctioning money. The Mission Mode Project has been undertaken to ensure the states preparedness in utilising the funds, he stated.

 In Bengal, the number of those going to registration offices every year exceeds 10 lakh. Computers will expedite the whole process, the AG said.

 To remove the sufferings of the common people and modernisation process, it is the policy of Government of India to get registration offices computerised in all the states, the AG added.

 After hearing the submission by 

 the AG, the high court decided not to interfere in the matter.

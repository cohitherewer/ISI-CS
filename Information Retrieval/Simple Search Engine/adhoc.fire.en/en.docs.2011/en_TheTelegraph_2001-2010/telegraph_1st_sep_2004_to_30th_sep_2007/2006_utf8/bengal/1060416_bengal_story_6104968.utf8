 Calcutta, April 15: A flock of birds, smuggled in from Bangladesh, were seized near the border today. But the men who were carrying them slipped away from the BSFs grasp. 

 More than 500 species, including Badrika, Kokateel and Prince, were rescued near Petrapol in North 24-Parganas.

 These birds are not found in India. We will hand them over to the Alipore zoo authorities next week, said V.K. Yadav, deputy chief wildlife warden of the state forest department. The birds were being brought to be sold in and around the city. 

 According to BSF sources, some patrolling personnel intercepted a group of people carrying the birds in cages. When they were asked to stop, the smugglers became scared. They dumped the cages and fled across the border, a BSF official said in Calcutta. Because of the dense vegetation, the men could not be caught. But the birds were rescued.

 The birds were taken to the Bibhuti Bhushan Wildlife Sanctuary near Barasat in the northern fringes of the city, where they will be kept before being moved to Alipore zoo. 

 To curb illegal sale of birds and other endangered animals, a coordination committee has been formed with representatives from the forest department, the detective department of Calcutta police, the railways, the BSF, the customs department and Coast Guard. 

 All the agencies have been directed to step up vigil at all inter-state and international borders. Todays seizure is a result of this, Yadav said.

 Bengal has long been on the transit route of poachers and smugglers across the country dealing in animal skins and organs. Rhinoceross horns, ivory and skins of tigers, leopards and other animals and rare birds are smuggled out of the country through the state. 

 Earlier this month, Calcutta police had seized 200 birds, including Rose Ring Parrots, Brahmini Mynas, Blue-Throated Barbets and a black kite from Narkeldanga Main Road and East Canal Road while they were being taken to the Galiff Street market for sale. Two men were arrested.

 Raids conducted in Jadavpur, Naihati and other places recovered several turtles recently. 

 Birds are brought from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Jharkhand as well as Bangladesh. Since there is a ban on selling Indian birds, the traders often smuggle birds from Bangladesh and sell in the city markets. They claim that they breed the birds here, an official said.

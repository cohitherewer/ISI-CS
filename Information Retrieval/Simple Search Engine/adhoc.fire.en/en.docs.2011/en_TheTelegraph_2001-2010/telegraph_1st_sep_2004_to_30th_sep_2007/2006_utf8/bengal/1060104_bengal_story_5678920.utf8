 Tata Motors team on land hunt

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 3: Tata Motors, which is planning to set up shop in Bengal, has been scouting for land. 

 A team of top officials from the automobile manufacturer, including vice-president C. Ramakrishnan and A.P. Arya, the president of its heavy and medium vehicles division, met chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee at Writers Buildings this morning.

 The duo had visited a site at Guptamani near Kharagpur yesterday for setting up a Rs 500-crore light vehicle manufacturing unit. 

 They will get back to us in few months, said a state government official.

 Ramakrishnan and Arya refused to give details of their meeting with the chief minister. Talks are in the initial stages. We cannot make any commitment now. Its too premature, they told a news conference this afternoon.

 Bhattacharjee, too, was tight-lipped. Ask them whether theyre investing here. They have visited the site and inspected the land, he said.

 State government officials said the main problem with Bengal is the lack of units making ancillary parts. Hindustan Motors is the only auto manufacturer in the state.

 If they (Tata Motors) come here, theyll have to go into a whole lot of tie-ups with other manufacturers for ancillary parts. The visitors pointed this out during their meeting with the chief minister. He told them that if Tata Motors comes to Bengal, many others will be encouraged to follow suit, an official said.

 Bhattacharjee has promised the Tata team all administrative cooperation.

 The delegation also met officials of the commerce and industry department. But commerce and industry secretary Sabyasachi Sen downplayed the visit. It was just a first visit. Nothing has been worked out so far.

 Cop suspended

 A sub-inspector of Memari police station was suspended today for trying to bribe the public prosecutor of Burdwan district court. The district superintendent of police said the public prosecutor had complained against sub-inspector Pitambar Pal.

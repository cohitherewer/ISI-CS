The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Pawar party on all boats

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Feb. 17: A day after the Left Front unveiled its list of candidates for the Assembly elections, Sharad Pawars Nationalist Congress Party rejected the CPM offer to contest two insignificant seats under the front banner. 

 A party leader said it is already in talks with the Congress, though the Trinamul Congress claimed it was part of the anti-CPM combine which includes the BJP.

 The CPM said the NCP had sought two seats from the front. I am surprised? state party secretary Anil Biswas said while reacting to NCP state president Bikram Sarkars allegation that the CPM decision to hand it the Raiganj and Rashbehari seats was unilateral.

 Biswas said NCP general secretary D.P. Tripathi came down to Calcutta two months ago and requested front chairman Biman Bose to leave a couple of seats for the party. 

 If they differ on principles now, we have no problem. We have candidates for the two seats, he added.

 The Congress and Trinamul now hold the two seats.

 Sarkar said: We are determined to take on the CPM. We will put up nominees against Left Front candidates across Bengal?. We have already initiated a dialogue with the Congress on seat adjustment.

 Mamata Banerjee is expected to call on Pawar, the NCP president and Union agriculture minister, in Delhi to also discuss seat sharing. 

 Mukul Roy, a Trinamul leader now camping with her in the capital, said: The NCP is part of the 13-party alliance that we floated in Bengal to take on the CPM. How can the front offer seats to the party? 

 NCP general secretary Tariq Anwar has apparently conveyed to Sarkar the partys reservations about any tie-up with the CPM. The party would send a communique to the CPM after a state committee meeting tomorrow.

 Roy said Mamata would follow up on her one-to-one with the AICC general secretary in charge of Bengal, Margaret Alva, with seat-sharing talks with other Congress leaders. 

 Mamata and Alva have agreed to work on a formula to prevent a split in anti-CPM votes...something positive will emerge soon, state Congress working president Pradip Bhattacharya said tonight.

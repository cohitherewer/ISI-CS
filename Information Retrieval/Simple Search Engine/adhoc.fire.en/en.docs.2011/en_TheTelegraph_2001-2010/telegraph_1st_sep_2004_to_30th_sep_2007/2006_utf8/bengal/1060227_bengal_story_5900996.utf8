The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Anil breathes fire on Bangladeshi purge

 OUR BUREAU

 Krishnagar/ Calcutta, Feb. 26: CPM state secretary Anil Biswas today lashed out at the Election Commission for carrying out a survey to weed out names of Bangladeshis from electoral rolls.

 Tension is brewing in villages and towns of Nadia as the district administration, under the ECs directive, is tracking down Bangladeshi settlers. We share your concern and will not allow anybody to uproot you. We consider you Indians, Biswas said this afternoon, while inaugurating a party rally in Krishnagar town, about 80 km from Calcutta.

 Later, the CPM leader told reporters that his party has no problems with the ECs move to delete the names of those who have recently come from Bangladesh. But we can never allow it to push back a large number of Bangladeshis who settled here long ago. The people in Delhi can forget them but we cannot. Ours is a responsible party and we know the history of the Partition, he added.

 Biswas also scoffed at the commission for making March 1971 the cut-off for detecting Bangladeshis in Nadia. How can the commission do so when the Supreme Court is currently hearing whether people who came after March 1971 should be considered as illegal immigrants or not? he asked.

 The CPM leader also criticised Congress MP Adhir Chowdhury and the Congress MLA from the district, Sankar Singh, for their efforts to forge an electoral tie-up with the Trinamul Congress.

 Emphasising that no alliance would emerge, he said: Let them do whatever they like. But no mahajot would be formed in Bengal.

 Biswas said eradication of poverty would be a major slogan for the Left Front in the run-up to the Assembly elections. Even after 29 years of Left Front rule, many people in Bengal dont have enough food and clothes. This is a great challenge for our government.

 He said this was the reason why Maoists had been able to make a headway in the state. We have problems in dealing with poverty. Otherwise, the Maoists would not have made inroads. Our party will have to take up this challenge in the coming days, he added.

 In Calcutta, the state Congress today sought a specific directive from the EC on the ban on poll graffiti imposed by the Bengal government.

 The commission should clarify its stand on poll graffiti through specific directives or guidelines which political parties should follow, PCC general secretary Manas Bhuniya said this afternoon.

 The PCC leader said the party would send a letter in this regard to state chief electoral officer Debasish Sen tomorrow, asking him to clarify the commissions stand.

 He also suggested that Sen convene an all-party meeting to discuss the guidelines.

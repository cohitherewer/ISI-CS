 Two girls too many for mother amp; her mum

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Barasat, Sept. 3: A 24-year-old mother, Sonali Das, was arrested today for throttling her newborn daughter. 

 Her mother, Shefali Sanyal, was arrested last night.

 Police said Sonali of Halisahar in North 24-Parganas was heartbroken after she found she had given birth to a girl. She has a four-year-old daughter, Pinky, who is mentally challenged. The birth of another daughter left her crestfallen, said Praveen Kumar, the North 24-Parganas police chief.

 Sonali, a Class VI dropout, told the police that she agreed to kill and bury her newborn daughter as her mother had suggested that such an act would help her get a son next time. 

 So, she committed the crime and told neighbours that she had given birth to a still-born child, an officer said.

 Some local women, who apparently heard the girl crying, saw Sonali standing by as her mother was burying the child in their backyard later yesterday morning. 

 Both Sonali and Shefali have been charged with murder. They were produced before the additional chief judicial magistrate in Barrackpore court and remanded in judicial custody till September 17.

 Shefali confessed to her crime last night, Kumar said.

 Sonali was arrested after she was released from hospital, where she was admitted after she bled heavily following labour in the presence of a midwife at home. 

 Her husband Kartik Das, who paints buildings, told the police that his wife had expressed the fear that she might deliver a second girl during her pregnancy. 

 Sonali had also told him that they would not be able to bring up two daughters.

 BRIEFS

 Belpahari, Nov. 24: Paramilitary jawans under fire from Maoists did not step out of their camp at Chhurimara yesterday because they feared a trap outside. 

 Guerrillas torched vehicles being used to build a road that would make patrolling easier and fired at the camp about 250 km from Calcutta. The West Midnapore police chief said: The jawans had sought permission to step out and retaliate but we didnt give it... they could have walked into booby traps. 

 Calcutta: Criminal proceedings against MP Adhir Chowdhurys wife Arpita were quashed in the high court on Friday. She was a co-accused with her husband in a double murder case.

 Calcutta: President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam will come here on the evening of December 5. He will go to the Indian Institute of Social Welfare and Business Management, Calcutta Girls School, BE College and the music school run by Pandit Ajoy Chakraborty on December 6.

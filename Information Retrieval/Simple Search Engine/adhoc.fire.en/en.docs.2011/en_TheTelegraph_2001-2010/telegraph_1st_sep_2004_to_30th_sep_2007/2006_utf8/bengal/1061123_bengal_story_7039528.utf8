 Village rallies for rape guru

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Nov. 22: A self-styled guru famous in the village for providing divine help to childless women repeatedly raped a young housewife and forced her to sit nude in front of his disciples for puja over the past three months.

 When her husband Nabakumar Karmakar, 30, protested and threatened to go to police, a villagers court ordered him out of Phulbari village in Nadias Hanskhali. 

 Scared, Nabakumar went to the police station in neighbouring Dhantola. 

 Faced with a probe, Gopal Das Babaji and Ranjan Saha, 45, the villager who headed the kangaroo court, surrendered in the Ranaghat subdivisional court yesterday. They have been remanded in jail custody. 

 Nabakumar, however, has to contend with angry villagers who have refused to let him enter Phulbari, around 70 km from Calcutta.

 Ironically, Nabakumars mother Sandhya had taken his 20-year-old wife to the godman. Three months ago, the mother-in-law accused her of inability to bear a child. When Sandhya took her daughter-in-law to the guru, she swore her to secrecy. Moyna (name changed) narrated the torture to her husband when it became unbearable. 

 Nabakumar has not lodged a complaint against his mother. But if her name crops up in the victims statement, we will arrest her. A hunt is on for all those who drove him out of the village, Nadia superintendent Ajay Nand said.

 About a hundred families in Phulbari are Gopal Das Babajis disciples and Sandhya is among them.

 Bijoy Biswas, the chief of the local Dakhinpara panchayat, said Nabakumar was dragged out of the village. Ranjan attacked Moyna. When the police came, no villager uttered a word. So, they went back.

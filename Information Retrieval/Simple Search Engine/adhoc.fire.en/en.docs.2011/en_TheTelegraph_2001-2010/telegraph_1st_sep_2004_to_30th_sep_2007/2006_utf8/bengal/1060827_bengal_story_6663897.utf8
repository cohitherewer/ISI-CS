The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Meet on pill for poorest of poor

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Calcutta, Aug 26: Micro-credit may have bettered the lives of millions of poor people, but it does not help the poorest of the poor. 

 This was the crux of a group discussion among economists and practitioners of micro-credit programmes, organised by micro-finance institution Bandhan and Small Industries Development Bank of India (Sidbi). 

 Micro-finance cannot deal with all problems. Our experience suggests such programmes bypass the bottom 10 to 15 per cent of the poor. Primarily we have been reaching out to moderately poor people, said Salehuddin Ahmed, former deputy director of the Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee. 

 Samresh Singh of Sidbi echoed Ahmed and stressed the need for developing special packages for the poorest of the poor. 

 The other participants in the discussion included economists Abhijit Banerjee, Mihir Rakshit, Nirmala Banerjee, Maitreesh Ghatak, Bhaswar Moitra and Ishita Mukherjee. 

 Officials of Bandhan kicked off the discussion moderated by Abhijit Banerjee, professor of economics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology with a presentation on its working model through which it has reached over 1.76 lakh women and disbursed credit worth over Rs 75.5 crore in a little over five years. 

 One should not only look at poverty alleviation, there is also the issue of poverty prevention, said Nirmala Banerjee, a former professor at the Centre for Studies in Social Science in Calcutta. 

 The three-hour session also addressed womens empowerment, apart from the source of funds and cost of operations for micro-credit institutions and the need to conduct skill augmentation programmes.

 One has to admit that despite excellent micro-finance institutions, one cannot fully alleviate poverty. But it can play a big role in raising the economic output of the poor, summed up Rakshit, a former professor of economics at the Indian Statistical Institute, Calcutta.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Woman run over

 Calcutta, Aug. 26: Kamala Mondal, 65, was run over by a private bus at Chetla crossing this morning, says a staff reporter. 

 Passers-by rushed her to SSKM Hospital, where she succumbed to injuries.

 Around 10 am, Mondal, a resident of Kalighat in south Calcutta, was crossing the road on her way to a relatives house when the bus route 3D trying to overtake another bus hit her from behind. Some people chased the vehicle for a while but the driver managed to slip away. 

 An enraged crowd put up a blockade on Chetla Road for an hour, throwing traffic out of gear. They alleged that there was no traffic constable at the crossing when the accident took place. 

 The mob also tried to ransack a private bus but our officers rushed to the spot and brought the situation under control, an officer of Chetla police station said. 

 According to an eye-witness, the victim was crossing the road when the driver of the private bus, in an attempt to overtake another vehicle, hit her from behind. The women was lying in a pool of blood and her head was completely smashed and the grey matter was coming out. It was a terrible sight. She regained consciousness at SSKM but later succumbed to her injuries, said Atanu Mukherjee, a local pan-shopowner. 

 There was not a single traffic constable present at the crossing at the time of the accident. The absence of constables emboldens the rogue drivers, he said.

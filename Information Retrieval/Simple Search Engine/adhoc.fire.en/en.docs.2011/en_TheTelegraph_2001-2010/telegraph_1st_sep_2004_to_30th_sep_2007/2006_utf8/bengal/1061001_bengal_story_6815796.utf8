 KLO man ends fast

 Siliguri, Sept. 30: Ailing KLO activist Nitish Mandal has agreed to end the hunger strike he was on along with 38 others, reports our correspondent. 

 However, the rest refused to budge, Jalpaiguri superintendent of police Tripurari said.

 The activists have been fasting since September 5 demanding the immediate trial or unconditional release of rebels from different outfits, including the Kamtapur Liberation Organisation (KLO) and Ulfa, who have been arrested from across Jalpaiguri district in the last three years. 

 Mandal, suffering from thalassaemia and jaundice, withdrew his strike after Tripurari spoke to the protesters at the North Bengal Medical College and Hospital last night.

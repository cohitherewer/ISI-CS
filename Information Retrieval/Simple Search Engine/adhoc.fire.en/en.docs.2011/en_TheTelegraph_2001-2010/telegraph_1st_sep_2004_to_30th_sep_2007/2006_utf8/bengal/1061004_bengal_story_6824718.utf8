The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Map to disarm Mamata

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Oct. 3: As the Trinamul Congress stuck to its guns in refusing to attend the all-party meeting on industry, the government sent it a Singur map and list of plots acquired for Tata Motors there. 

 The chief minister told Left Front allies in the evening that the government had also provided a map of the original site proposed by the Tatas to prove that it did not accept their wish list and tried to spare multi-crop land and homes. 

 An alliance leader said the government is giving the Tatas 100 acres less than what they had wanted originally.

 A Trinamul leader, however, said in the evening that the party had not yet received any such map or list. 

 The front urged Trinamul to call off the bandh on October 9 in view of the floods in 16 districts.

 RSP, CPI and Forward Bloc leaders, who apparently had heated exchanges with the CPMs Benoy Konar over their allegation that the government had been taking decisions without taking the allies into confidence, were happy after the commerce and industries minister spoke to them.

 Nirupam Sen explained to the partners why the government had to accommodate the Tatas in Hooghlys Singur, about 40 km from Calcutta.

 A front leader said both Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and Sen told them that the government had offered six alternative sites to the Tatas, who insisted on Singur. 

 They said Singurs better connectivity and other logistical advantages would help them make the production of the Rs 1-lakh car cost-effective. As we cannot offer tax holidays and other benefits like Himachal Pradesh and Uttaranchal, we have to compensate them by handing over land of their choice, an RSP leader quoted the chief minister as saying. 

 Sen said the Singur farmers had sold around 200 acres out of the 997 acres to be acquired for the Tatas to land sharks long before the government had begun the land acquisition. 

 The Bansals, Todis and Goenkas, who have already bought land in Singur, close to the highway, are neither farmers and nor will they use it for farming, state CPM secretary and front chairman Biman Bose said. 

 Sen, however, admitted that many multi-crop plots were treated as single-crop as there was no record of their devel- opment with the farmers.

 The chief minister and Sen said they had bargained hard with Tata Group chairman Ratan Tata and Tata Motors MD Ravi Kant on the compensation and alternative livelihood for the land-losers. 

 The Tatas will make all efforts to train and absorb some of the landlosers and generate indirect jobs for others, including women, the chief minister told the allies.

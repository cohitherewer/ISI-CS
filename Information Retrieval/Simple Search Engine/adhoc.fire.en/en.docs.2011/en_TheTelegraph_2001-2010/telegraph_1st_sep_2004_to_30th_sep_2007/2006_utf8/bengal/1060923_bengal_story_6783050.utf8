New Delhi, Sept. 22: Bengals arsenic-affected areas will be the first beneficiaries of Bharat Nirmans drinking water component, which proposes to deliver by 2009 clean water to all places that do not have it.

 As part of the programme to strengthen the countrys rural infrastructure, the Centre will bear 75 per cent of the total cost of the states piped water supply schemes in 648 arsenic-affected areas.

 About a week back, the Union ministry of rural development gave the first instalment 45 per cent of the Centres share to Bengal.

 In July, the state government had approved three piped water supply schemes covering 670 habitations, of which 648 had arsenic problems. 

 Official sources said while the Centre would bear three-fourths of the cost of clean water supply to the arsenic-affected areas, the remaining 22 would be covered by funds under the accelerated rural water supply programme.

 Under the rural water supply programme, the Centre and the state share the cost of a drinking water project equally.

 While releasing the first instalment of the Centres share, the ministry of rural deve- lopment also asked the state government to transfer the completed schemes to panchaya- ti raj institutions for their operation and maintenance.

 Bharat Nirman is an ambitious initiative of the UPA government aimed at changing the rural face of India. 

 It is a four-year programme that has fixed goals in six spheres irrigation, water supply, housing, roads, telephony and electrification. The cost of the programme is pegged at Rs 1.74 trillion.

 The drinking water component of Bharat Nirman proposes to cover all quality-affected areas by 2009.

 Over 5,000 habitations in the country now drink arsenic along with their water. 

 Of these, 3,176 are in eight Bengal districts. The worst affected are South 24-Parganas, with 1,644 such areas, North 24-Parganas with 922, Malda with 462 and Murshidabad with 98.

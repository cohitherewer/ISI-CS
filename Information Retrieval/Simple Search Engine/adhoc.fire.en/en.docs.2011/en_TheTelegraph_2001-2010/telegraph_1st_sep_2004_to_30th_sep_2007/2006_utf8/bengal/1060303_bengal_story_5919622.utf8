The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 15 rescued from ship

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, March 2: Fifteen crew members were rescued from a Bangladeshi cargo vessel which tipped over in the Sunderbans today.

 The vessel carrying logs was headed for Bangladesh from Haldia when it tipped over on a tributary of Matla river after brushing against Talapatti Island, 150 km from Calcutta.

 Forest guards and Border Security Force jawans launched a rescue operation hearing shouts for help.

 All the crew members are safe. The mishap took place probably because of stormy winds, said a senior police officer of South 24-Parganas.

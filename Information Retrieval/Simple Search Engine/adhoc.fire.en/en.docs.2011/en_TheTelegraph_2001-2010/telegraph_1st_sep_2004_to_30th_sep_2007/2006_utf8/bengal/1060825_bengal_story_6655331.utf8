 Spat turns fatal

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Behrampore, Aug. 24: A quarrel over a scrap of paper cost Swarup Sen his wifes life.

 Sen, a businessman from Behrampore, had taken his pregnant wife Pipasa to the district hospital around 8 yesterday morning. She was admitted under Dr Ranjit Roychowdhury.

 His wifes due date had arrived but she wasnt feeling any labour pain. So the doctor suggested an injection that would induce labour. Otherwise, he said, a Caesarean section would have to be carried out, Sen said.

 A nurse gave him a small piece of paper on which the injections name was scribbled.

 I told the nurse to write down the name on a proper hospital requisition slip. But she refused. When I raised my voice, she tore up the paper. I couldnt buy the injection, ending my wifes chances of a normal delivery, Sen said.

 The businessman said the doctor, too, refused to rewrite the prescription, saying he should apologise to the nurse first.

 Pipasa, 22, was taken to the operation theatre around 9 pm and she gave birth to a girl. The condition of my wife started to deteriorate soon after. She died around 2 am today, Sen said.

 Sen has charged Roychowdhury with negligence and lodged a complaint with police, who have started a probe.

 As news of Pipasas death spread this morning, over 100 people gathered at the hospital gate demanding action against the doctor. The police arrived and brought the situation under control.

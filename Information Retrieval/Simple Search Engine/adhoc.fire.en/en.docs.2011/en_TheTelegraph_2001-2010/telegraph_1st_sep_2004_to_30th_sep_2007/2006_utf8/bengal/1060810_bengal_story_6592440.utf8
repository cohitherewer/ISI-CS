The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Schools face stick over poor marks

 Partha De : Cracking the whip

Malda, Aug. 9: More than 500 schools across the state were asked to explain their students poor performance in Madhyamik 2006 and 31 institutions in Malda have not been sent their payroll for failing to answer to the notice in time.

 School education minister Partha De told The Telegraph: I cannot tell you the exact number of schools, but we have asked them to explain their performance. They can also inform us about difficulties they had in raising the standard of education.

 The minister made it clear that the school education department would not tolerate high failure rates in the secondary examination. We are serious about raising the standard of education in the state and we will leave no stone unturned in trying to achieve that, he added.

 The showcause notices had been sent to the district inspectors of schools.

 Malda inspector Tapan Kumar Basu said the payroll of teachers and other employees of 31 schools had not been despatched this month. 

 There are 10 conditions that government-aided schools have to comply with to continue receiving the funds. Among them is a 41-per cent success rate for students in the Madhyamik examination. The pass percentage of these 31 schools in 2006 ranged between 22 and 36 per cent, Basu said.

 These schools had been given the notice on July 23 and seven days to respond. The deadline was later extended by a week. As my office has not received any reply from these schools, their pay has not been despatched from the treasury, Basu said.

 Bhuban Kumar, a secretariat member of the CPMs All-Bengal Teachers Association, declined comment on the pay cut saying it was a government decision.

 We have to look into why the success rate fell below 41 per cent. The question is whether the success rate dropped because a new syllabus was introduced this year, he said, adding that there was a need to improve the infrastructure of schools and to fill up vacant teaching posts. 

 The district administration also said that it would soon initiate action against some headmasters who are busy giving tuitions in private.

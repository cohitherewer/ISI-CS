The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Minor released after 15-year jail

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, May 10: The high court today ordered the release of a man who has already spent 15 years in jail for killing his brother.

 Surojit Burman was only 15 when he shot dead his elder brother on April 30, 1991, but the trial court had neither conducted a test to determine his age nor referred the case to the juvenile system.

 A high court-appointed committee, which conducted an ossification test, said Surojit is 30 now. He was a minor while committing the murder. 

 In a juvenile court, the maximum sentence for a murder is three years in jail. 

 Four of the 16 witnesses had said the accused was a minor during the crime. So the trial court should have had an ossification test done before starting his trial. As the right procedure was not followed, we are asking the authorities to release him from the jail immediately, the division bench of Justices A.K. Talukdar and S.P. Mitra said.

 Surojit, a resident of mathabhanga in Cooch Behar, had killed his brother Gurudas with the family-owned gun after apparently being scolded for not studying. 

 Gurudass widow, the lone witness to the murder, lodged a complaint with Mathabhanga police station.

 An additional sessions judge of Cooch Behar convicted Surojit of the murder and sentenced him to life on April 17, 1999. 

 He moved the high court in May 1999 and waited seven years for his plea to be heard.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Boy in court for marks

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 7: A Madhyamik examinee who did not get an admit card because his school had goofed managed to take the exam thanks to the high court, but he has yet to get a mark sheet five days after the results were announced. 

 Purnendu Sarkar of Singhi High School in Murshidabad knows he has got a second division, but not his scores in individual subjects. 

 In the absence of the mark sheet, he cannot seek admission to Class XI.

 Purnendu moved court again today, praying for the mark sheet. The petition by the boy from Lalbagh, about 220 km from Calcutta, will be heard tomorrow.

 The West Bengal Board of Secondary Examination said the mark sheet was sent to the school along with those of the other students of his batch. But headmaster Samsul Haque said he did not receive it.

 Purnendu has cleared the Madhayamik examination with a second division. But I could not hand him the mark sheet because it has not reached the school yet. As the summer vacation is on, I will be able to contact the board only after it reopens, Haque said. 

 A school office, however, remains open through the summer recess and Haque need not wait for it to get over. 

 An affluent farmers son, Purnendu first moved high court on February 22, two days before the examination was to begin. 

 His lawyer told Justice Soumitra Sen that he had completed all formalities, but was still to get the admit card, without which he could not appear for the examination. 

 The boards counsel claimed that Purnendu had not filled up his registration pa-pers on time. 

 But the judge ruled that the fiasco was a result of some lapses on the part of the headmaster and asked the board to issue an admit card to Purnendu within a day. 

 With the admission season on, Purnendu had no option but to fall back on the court. His lawyer Prabal Sarkar said: Given the rush for admissions, you can understand what hes going through.

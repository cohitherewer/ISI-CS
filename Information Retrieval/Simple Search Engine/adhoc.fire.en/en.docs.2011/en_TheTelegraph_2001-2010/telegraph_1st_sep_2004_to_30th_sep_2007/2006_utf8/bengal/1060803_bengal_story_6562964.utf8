 Calcutta/Purulia, Aug. 2: The government will conduct an inquiry into the deaths of three Jadavpur University students who apparently went trekking to the Ayodhya Hills in Purulia.

 Its an unfortunate incident. We will conduct an inquiry into it, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said at Writers Buildings. 

 Asked whether it would be a CID probe, he said: It will be something bigger than that. 

 At Baghmundi in Purulia, Shyamal Ghosh, an uncle of Arundhati, the first-year MPharma student whose decomposed body was found yesterday, has lodged a police complaint saying that her death was not accidental as claimed by the two survivors. 

 We demand a thorough probe, said Ghosh.

 Police took Arundhatis body to Bankura Medical College and Hospital this morning for post-mortem. 

 The chief minister said he had sought a transcript of the police interrogation of the two survivors of the five-member JU team, Bappaditya Chatterjee and Kaushik Sarkhel. 

 The incident is not very clear, there are still many grey areas, he added.

 Swati Das and Subhankar Saha were found dead a day after they were apparently swept away by a flash flood in a mountain stream on Friday.

 There have been several discrepancies in the versions of the incident narrated by Bappaditya and Kaushik. 

 The first said the five were swept away by the raging river while trying to cross it. But Kaushik said yesterday that they were cooking on the bank when hit by the wave. 

 In letters to home secretary P.R. Ray and director-general of police A.B. Vohra, JU registrar Rajat Banerjee today requested a thorough investigation into the incident. 

 We want the truth to come out, Banerjee said. 

 Arundhatis uncle Shyamal Ghosh said he has pointed out in his complaint the contradictions in Bappaditya and Kaushiks statements.

 The dead girls didnt have clothes on them unlike the only male victim.

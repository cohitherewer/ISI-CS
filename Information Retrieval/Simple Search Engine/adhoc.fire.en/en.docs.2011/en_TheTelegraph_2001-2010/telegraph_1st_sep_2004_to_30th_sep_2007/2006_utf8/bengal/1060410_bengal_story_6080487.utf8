The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Certificate to vote

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 9: The Election Commission today said it would issue a certificate to voters who do not possess electoral photo identity cards or any other document with a photograph to prove their identity.

 Chief electoral officer Debashis Sen said photo identity cards had been distributed to about 95 per cent of the electorate. 

 So, the EC has made arrangements for those who do not possess the cards. There are 13 documents a genuine voter can produce, including passport, driving licence, PAN card, any nationalised banks passbook, students I-card and pension documents. For those who do not have even these documents, the commission will supply a certificate, Sen said.

 Ration cards will not be considered proof of identity. With the recovery of many fake cards, the poll panel thought it wise to reject them as evidence of identity, Sen said.

 The poll panel, he added, had made photo identity cards mandatory for those provided with them.

 The certificate ? which will have either the signature or the left thumb impression of the voter ? will be issued by the electoral registration officer in a prescribed format.

 They are mainly meant for poor, rural voters who do not possess documents like passport, driving licence or pan cards, an official said.

 Officers will go door-to- door and ask those who do not have photo identity cards if they possess any of the other documents. If someone does not have any of them, he/she will be given a certificate. A specimen signature or left thumb impression will be compared with the one on the certificate at the booth , Sen said.

 He said if there is any objection over a thumb impression, there would be an inquiry.

 State CPM secretary and Left Front chairman Biman Bose today alleged that names of genuine voters were being struck off voter lists. He said: Names of voters with photo I-cards are also being struck off. When some of them went to find out why, they were told that it was done on instruction from observers.

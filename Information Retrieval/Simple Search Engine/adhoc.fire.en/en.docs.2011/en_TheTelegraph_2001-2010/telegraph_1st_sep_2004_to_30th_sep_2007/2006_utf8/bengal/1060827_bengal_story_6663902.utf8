The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Rally purger faces govt house heat

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Justice Lala

 Calcutta, Aug. 26: The man who cleared the city streets has been accused by the state government of not clearing his official residence despite being transferred out of Calcutta.

 Justice Amitava Lala, who triggered a storm when he gave marching orders to rallies, is among 300 government officials in Bengal who have been charged with flouting rules by retaining government flats after transfer or retirement. 

 The government submitted a list of these officials in the Supreme Court along with an affidavit on August 11. The court had directed all states to file affidavits following a petition by a Karnataka government employee, who was served an eviction notice after his retirement. 

 According to the rules, the flats have to be vacated in case of retirement or transfer. Some time is given to look for alternative accommodation. But it is unfortunate that many officers, including some VVIPs, are not vacating the flats, housing minister Gautam Deb said today.

 Besides Lala, who is currently the chief justice of Allahabad High Court, Justice S.B. Roy Burman, the chief justice of Himachal Pradesh High Court, and a host of senior civil servants are on the list of unauthorised occupants. 

 The Bengal government provides accommodation to senior officials, judges and civil servants who do not have a place to stay in Calcutta. 

 Lala and Roy Burman were allotted flats in Gariahat when they were judges in Calcutta High Court. In 2004, both Justice Lala and Justice Roy were transferred to other states. But they are yet to vacate the flats, said a senior official in the housing department.

 According to the affidavit submitted to the apex court, out of the 300 unauthorised occupants, 76 have moved Calcutta High Court and obtained a stay. The rest were served eviction notices, some of which date back to the early 90s.

 Over a thousand officers at different levels are awaiting accommodation. But as the occupants are not vacating their flats, we cant do much about it, Deb said. 

 He added that some of them have got houses elsewhere but are still refusing to move out of the government flats. 

 Neither Justice Lala nor Justice Roy could be contacted. Their flats were under lock and key.

 The state government is also drawing up a two-pronged action plan to remove unauthorised occupants.

 It will appeal to the apex court to dispose of all occupancy-related cases by a single judgment, an official said.

 The department has also decided to take possession of flats for which eviction notices have been served. We will start a full-fledged eviction drive after the Pujas. We will break the locks and take possession of the flats, Deb said.

 School dues for widow after 23 years

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

Calcutta, Aug. 18: A 70-year-old widow of a headmaster who died in harness will get her dues 23 years after he passed away. 

 Justice J.K. Biswas of Calcutta High Court today directed the Burdwan primary school council to give Shyama Charan Ghoshs statutory dues and family pension to his widow Bhanu immediately. 

 The interest on the dues will be decided later.

 Ghosh, the headmaster of Jaykay High School at Asansol in Burdwan, died following a heart attack in 1983. 

 After his death, the district school council declined to pay the dues to his widow. 

 The council officials told her that the school authorities had not sent them the documents related to her husbands service.

 Bhanu approached the school but did not receive any positive response. 

 Virtually reduced to starving with a son and daughter, the widow petitioned the high court seeking an order directing the school to send the relevant documents to the council so that she got her dues and family pension.

 In 1987, the court asked the school authorities to hand over the documents to the district council. That order was followed. But even after receiving the papers, the council did not pay a paisa to the widow. 

 For the past 19 years, Bhanu has been running pillar to post without any relief. Finally, she moved the high court again on Monday.

 We told the widows story to Justice Biswas. He asked me to serve notices on the government lawyers asking them to attend the hearing on August 18, said Siraz Gooptu and Surojit Chakraborty, the lawyers representing the widow.

 When the petition came up for hearing today, no one was present on behalf of the school education department. 

 We informed the judge that according to his order, we had served notices to the government lawyers asking them to represent the case, the lawyers said.

 The government counsels absence prompted the judge to pass an order asking the authorities concerned to make the payment to the widow immediately.

 There are hundreds of similar petitions pending before the high court. 

 The situation has prompted the court administration to assign a particular court to hear the petitions of retired schoolteachers or their widows. 

 The callousness of the employers is causing serious problems to many families, Justice G.C. Gupta had said while hearing such a petition a few days ago.

 In the past eight months, the high court has come down heavily on the government in at least eight cases for not paying dues to schoolteachers widows.

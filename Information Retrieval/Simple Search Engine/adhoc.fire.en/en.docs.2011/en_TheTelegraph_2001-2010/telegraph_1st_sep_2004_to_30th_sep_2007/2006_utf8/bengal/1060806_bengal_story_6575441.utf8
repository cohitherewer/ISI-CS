The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Murder stone found

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Aug. 5: Regent Park police today found the shil noda (grinding stone) Swapan Biswas had used to bludgeon his wife to death on Thursday.

 Acting on information provided by Swapan during interrogation, officers went to his Dineshnagar residence where the stone had been hidden in a box covered with a piece of paper. 

 The accused had used the grinding stone to bludgeon wife Aparna after strangling her and smashing her skull with a shovel to ensure she was dead, an officer said.

 Swapan then washed the blood off the grinding stone and hid it inside the box, he said.

 A cashier with the State Bank of Indias Jadavpur branch, Swapan suspected his wife of more than a year of having an extra-marital affair with a local youth. 

 Hours after the murder, Swapan turned himself in at the Lalbazar police headquarters. The case was later shifted to Regent Park police station. 

 He had left the house, thinking of catching some of his bank colleagues who should have come out for a morning walk, said an officer of the Regent Park police station.

 He had a good mind to confess his crime to some of his colleagues. But he didnt meet anybody and so he walked straight to Lalbazar. 

 Investigations have revealed that Swapan suffered from an inferiority complex as he was less educated than his wife. Swapan, who could not pass his higher secondary examination, would always keep an eye on his graduate wife and suspected her even if she spoke to her brother.

 This suspicion grew with every passing month and he was convinced that his wife was having an extra-marital affair. Even the rumour of Aparna being pregnant seems to be false. We are still waiting for the post-mortem report, the officer said.

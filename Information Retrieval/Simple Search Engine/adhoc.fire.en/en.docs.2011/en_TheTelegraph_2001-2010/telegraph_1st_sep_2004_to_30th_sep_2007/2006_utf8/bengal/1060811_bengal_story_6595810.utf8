 Suicide after fodder order

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta/Ranchi, Aug. 10: Three days after he was found guilty of involvement in the Bihar fodder scam, a man jumped to his death from a building in Beliaghata this morning. 

 Vinod Kumar Chirania, 52, was found lying in a pool of blood on the pavement of Surat Har Lane. He was taken to Nil Ratan Sircar Hospital where doctors declared him dead.

 Police have found a suicide note in which Chirania blamed the CBI, which probed the scam, for slapping false charges on him and his elder brother Omprakash.

 He wrote in the note that he was not involved in the scam, said Pradip Chatterjee, the deputy commissioner of police, headquarters. He also mentioned that the CBI made false charges against his family because of which he had been suffering from acute depression.

 On Tuesday, a special CBI court in Ranchi sentenced Chirania, who used to supply medicines for animals in Patna and Calcutta, to four years rigorous imprisonment along with 31 accused, including Omprakash. 

 But before he could be arrested, Chirania sneaked into Calcutta. When he did not turn up in the court after two days, judge Ashraf Hussain issued an arrest warrant declaring him an absconder.

 The police said Chirania had supplied medicines worth Rs 5 lakh to the Bihar animal husbandry department. The CBI charged him after interrogating his brother. 

 Chiranias family petitioned the court to release Omprakash on bail to perform his brothers last rites, but it was turned down after CBI advocate Ravi Shankar objected. 

 Shankar said he had received a fax from Chiranias wife but she did not blame the CBI for his death.

 Chiranias suicide is the second by a fodder scam accused in the last nine years. In 1997, a man had jumped in front of a speeding train.

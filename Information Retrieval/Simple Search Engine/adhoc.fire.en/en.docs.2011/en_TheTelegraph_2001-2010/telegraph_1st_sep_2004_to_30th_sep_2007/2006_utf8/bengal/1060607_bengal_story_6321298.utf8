The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Comrades at war over poll rolls

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 6: A member of the CPM womens wing has moved court against a section of her own party alleging harassment for having pointed out the presence of Bangladeshis on the electoral rolls.

 Sibani Haldar, a member of the Habra unit of the Ganatantrik Mahila Samiti told the court that her comrades attacked her house because she had lodged the complaint.

 On December 12, she had specifically told the observer visiting Habra in North 24-Parganas, 40 km from Calcutta, that among many others Bangladeshi national Dipali Pal had been included on the rolls.

 The observer asked her to lodge a police complaint. She did so, but that incurred the partys wrath.

 The very next day, a mob led by local CPM workers attacked Sibanis house and threatened her with dire consequences, her lawyer said.

 Justice G.C. Gupta of the high court today asked the Election Commission and North 24-Parganas police to file an affidavit stating what steps they had taken in regard to Sibanis complaint.

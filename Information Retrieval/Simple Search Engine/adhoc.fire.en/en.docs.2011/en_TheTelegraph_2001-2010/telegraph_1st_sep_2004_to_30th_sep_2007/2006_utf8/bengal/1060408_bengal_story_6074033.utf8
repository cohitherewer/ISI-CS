The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Permit must for poll agents

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, 

 April 7: The Election Commission has for the first 

 time fixed eligibility criteria for polling agents, posted 

 in booths by political parties on election day.

 Earlier, the candidates could appoint three agents of their choice in every booth. 

 They can do that this time, too. But the agents names should figure on the voter list and they should possess an electoral photo identity card (EPIC). 

 Chief electoral officer Debashis Sen said: In case they dont have an EPIC, they will have to furnish a photo-identity card issued by the government or a public underta- king, like passport, driving licence or a bank passbook.

 Sen relayed the commissions instructions to the 18 district magistrates in Bengal and the three district election officers of Calcutta through a video-conference from Writers Buildings.

 Although a candidate will be allowed to have three agents, only one at a time can be present in a booth.

 Sen said every polling agent will be provided an entry pass issued by the presiding officer on polling day. A central paramilitary jawan will check the pass at the booths entrance and no agent will be allowed inside without it.

 During change of shifts, the presiding officer and the jawan at the entrance will oversee the process, said an election department official.

 The role of sector officials, who will monitor about 20 booths, will issue written certificates on whether they are suitable for voting and whether secrecy of ballots is assured, the official added. 

 The process of fixing the configurations of the electronic voting machines will be video recorded for documentary evidence.

 The election department has launched a website, ceowb.org, which would carry names and phone numbers of observers.

 Three helicopters would be used during the first phase of elections on April 17. The government owns one of them. The other two would be taken from the army.

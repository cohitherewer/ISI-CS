 Elders order wedding: bride 11, groom 14

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Behrampore, May 30: Eleven-year-old Rangeela Khatun should have been playing around in her village like any other child. But she is already a housewife, trying to help out her mother-in-law in the kit-chen at Ichhakhali village, about 250 km from Calcutta.

 Rangeela was forcibly married off to 14-year-old Akil Sheikh last Friday following an order of a shalishi board comprising village elders. 

 Her father Nurful Sheikh had complained to them that Akil had fallen in love with his daughter because the boy was once seen talking to her at the grocers. 

 Nurful, who lost the fing- ers on his left hand to a blast, hawks spices to earn a living.

 Akils father Hemajuddin Sheikh, who owned two bighas and was a well-known mason, died three months ago. The boy, who inherited his land, also works as a helper to various local masons. 

 Financially, he and his mother Kalpana Bewa are better off than Nurfuls family.

 Sahabuddin Ahmed, the local CPM secretary who was part of the panel that decided on the punishment for Akil, said the villagers pressured Kalpana to accept Rangeela as her daughter-in-law. 

 The mother said: Is it possible to fall in love with such a small child? Nurful, a local tough who has a criminal past, forced this marriage on us. I am a helpless widow and Akil is only 14.

 Akils elder brother lives with his wife separately.

 The boy said: I had no relationship with Rangeela. Only once, about two weeks ago, I had spoken to her at the grocery. 

 What can I do? Akil asked. My wife is staying with me and it appears I will have to accept her.

 The Congress chief of the local Lakshmijola village panchayat, Musharaf Hossain, however, could not support the child marriage. He informed Raghunathgunj block development officer Samanjit Sengupta about it. 

 The marriage is illegal. I lodged a complaint with police today against the girls father, the boys mother and those present at the shalishi meeting, Sengupta said.

 Ahmed admitted that he was present at the meeting where the marriage was ordered. We ordered the marriage because the boy and the girl were having an affair, he added.

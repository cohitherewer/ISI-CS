 Realtors thugs batter family

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, May 18: Goons allegedly sent by realtors beat up a man, his wife and son yesterday because he refused to part with the land in Behala on which his family had been living for over 60 years.

 Sambhunath Samanta, 51, and his son Gautam were released after treatment at Vidyasagar Hospital while his wife Ruma, 45, had to be admitted there. They (the goons) kicked me repeatedly and hit me over my left ear with a rod, she said, still in pain.

 Gautam, 27, lodged a complaint with Behala police station yesterday afternoon, but no one had been arrested till late this evening.

 South 24-Parganas superintendent of police S.N. Gupta said: We had sent a team to the Samantas. We are trying to contact the two promoters against whom the complaint has been lodged.

 Sambhunath, two brothers and the family of a third live in separate houses on an 11-cottah plot on Sil Thakurbari Road. The property belonged to our father and weve been living here from the time before Independence. The promoters threats have been coming over the past six months. I had a tenant whom the goons forced to leave at gunpoint last Friday, Sambhunath alleged.

 The same day, they brought bricks and other building material and stacked them in a corner of the plot and even felled a dozen trees. 

 Sambhunath obtained prohibitory orders from the Alipore additional chief judicial magistrates court, but the goons paid no heed. Around 11 am on Tuesday, masons tried to begin construction. When I challenged them, the goons ? some of them with revolvers ? appeared, and told me that a club was coming up. When I tried to resist with my son, they beat us up, he said. 

 When one of them tried to hit Gautam, Ruma came in the way. She was not spared. The neighbours stepped out after the goons had left.

 The police have taken down the Samantas statements, the goons have threatened them with dire consequences.

 Five die as bus falls into canal

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Aug. 5 : Five 

 persons were killed and 50 injured when a bus fell into 

 a roadside canal near Krishnagar this morning. 

 The injured were admitted to Saktinagar district hospital. Eight are said to be in critical condition.

 Those killed have been identified as 30-year-old Itu Kundu from Chapra, Murari Ghosh, 55, Nabakumar Biswas, 30, Hefajjudin Mondol, 50, and Abdul Jalil, 45. 

 Police said the bus fell into the canal at Paninala around 6.45 am when it was heading from Karimpur towards Krishnagar, about 150 km from Calcutta. About 60 passengers were on the bus. 

 The driver lost control of the vehicle when he slammed the brakes while negotiating a speed bump. The bus hit a roadside tree and then plunged into the canal. Residents helped the police with the rescue, said Nadia police superintendent R. Rajsekharan. 

 He said the driver jumped out of the bus when it was falling into the canal and ran away. But later, we arrested him on the charge of reckless driving, the police superintendent said.

 The officer said mostly farmers and labourers from Chapra, Tehatta and Karimpur were on the bus.

 The sabhadhipati of the Nadia zilla parishad, Rama Biswas, and additional district magistrate Rajesh Sinha are at the hospital.

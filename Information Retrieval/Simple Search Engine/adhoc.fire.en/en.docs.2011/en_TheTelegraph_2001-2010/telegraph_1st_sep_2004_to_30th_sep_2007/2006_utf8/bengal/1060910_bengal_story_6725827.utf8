 Bureaucrat suicide in Salt Lake

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 9: A joint director in the state health department committed suicide at his Salt Lake home this morning, apparently because of depression.

 Asit Banerjee, 50, was found hanging from the ceiling with a sari tied round his neck. No suicide note was found.

 A preliminary probe revealed that Banerjee had been suffering from depression. It could be some problem in his workplace, said Praveen Kumar, the superintendent of police, North 24-Parganas.

 His wife Shipra, who is a doctor at the B.C. Roy Memorial Hospital for Children at Phoolbagan, left home around 8.30 this morning for work. There was no one at home the couples only son studies in Manipal Medical College. It appears that Banerjee killed himself half an hour after his wife went out, an officer said.

 Shipra told the police Banerjee had looked very upset for the past couple of days. My husband was an introvert and did not share his problems with anyone, she said.

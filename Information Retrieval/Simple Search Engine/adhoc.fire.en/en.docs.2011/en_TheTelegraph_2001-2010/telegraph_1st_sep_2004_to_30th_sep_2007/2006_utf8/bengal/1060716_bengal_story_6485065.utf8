 Polba (Hooghly), July 15: Krishak Sabha leader Benoy Konar has called upon farmers to part with their land for the sake of industry, saying Bengal cannot progress without industrialisation.

 The Left Front government is not here to stage a revolution, the leader of the CPM farmers wing said while addressing agricultural labourers at Polba in Hooghly, about 50 km from Calcutta.

 This is a bourgeois government in search of private capital and industry. It is just a machine to deliver the goods, irrespective of who is running it ? Jyotibabu or Buddhababu. And its task is to make the state graduate from agriculture to industry, Konar, who is also a member of the partys state secretariat, added.

 For this (industrialisation), the government will have to continue working in a capitalist framework and attract investment and industry, Konar said.

 On May 11, the day election results were announced in Bengal, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had said it was not possible to practise socialism in Bengal and underscored the need to rope in investment from the private sector.

 Referring to the Salim Group and the Tatas, Konar said industry would get a wrong message if they are not allowed to set up their units in Bengal.

 Can we tell the Tatas that you cannot invest here just because you are not a communist? Can we say that our government wont accept investment from the Tatas because they are capitalists? This cant happen and one will have to accept the reality that the state will not progress without investment, said Konar.

 Asserting that industries would come up in Singur, the Krishak Sabha leader said agricultural labourers displaced in the process could be inducted as unskilled workers in ancillary units that would be set up along with the Tatas small-car unit.

 The number of agricultural labourers in the state is declining and alternative means of livelihood will have to be explored, Konar said. The dependence on agriculture has to come down and emphasis should be laid on industry. A cold storage plant can offer much more direct and indirect employment than that generated by an acre of farmland. So, we will have to move towards industry.

 CPM hands off cricket polls

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Midnapore, July 22: CPM state secretary Biman Bose today iterated that his party had nothing to do with the upcoming elections to the Cricket Association of Bengal.

 The party will not interfere with CAB elections, Bose, who is also the Left Front chairman, told reporters on the sidelines of a meeting of CPM workers at Pradyut Smriti Bhavan in Midnapore, about 130 km from Calcutta.

 When asked to comment on Jagmohan Dalmiyas decision to contest the poll ignoring chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees request to step aside, Bose refused to say anything. 

 Asked about the impact it would have on the chief minister if his candidate, Calcutta police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee, lost to Dalmiya, Bose again said: I shall not comment.

 Some key CPM functionaries today said Dalmiyas victory would be a loss of face for Bhattacharjee, who has drawn some amount of criticism for getting involved in the autonomous cricket bodys affairs.

 The party has never interfered with CAB elections in the last 30 years. So this time, we should not rally behind the Calcutta police commissioner, said a CPM leader from south Calcutta.

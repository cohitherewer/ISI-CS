 BRIEFS

 Behrampore, May 19: A masjid committee has ordered the boycott of seven families in a Murshidabad village 215 km from Calcutta because one of them had refused to pay Rs 6,000 as fine after a girl spoke to a male neighbour.

 They are being denied work in the fields, provisions from shops and bathing rights in village ponds. We follow the Islamic law at Bildharipara, said Mohsin Ali, the mosque secretary. Behrampore circle inspector Debendranath Das went there yesterday and told the panel to withdraw the boycott. Or else well initiate a case.

 Krishnagar: Kashi Rao, 35, son-in-law of Daud Mondal, who was killed on Sunday, has been arrested for murder and conspiracy. Police said earlier that Mondal was killed because he wanted to change the will in which he wrote everything to his youngest daughter, Raos wife Chandrani.

 Midnapore: Five CPM supporters have been arrested. They sme- ared the Congress zilla parishad chief of East Midnapore with abir.

 Krishnagar: Madan Pal, a Class VI student, committed suicide after his mother scolded him for bunking school. He left home at Kamarga- chhi for school but spent Thursday swimming in a pond with friends.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Mamata stays away from BJP rally

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 11: Mamata Banerjee today skipped a BJP rally in which its president Rajnath Singh and general secretary Arun Jaitley were present.

 Though Mamatas name was repeatedly announced from the dais as one of the main speakers, the Trinamul Congress chief stayed away from her allys first rally in the run-up to the Assembly polls. Instead, Trinamul Congress MLA Saugata Roy addressed the gathering opposite Metro Channel. 

 Todays meeting was Singhs first rally here after he became the BJP president.

 Though Trinamul general secretary Mukul Roy said Mamata could not attend the meet as she was busy giving final touches to her partys list of candidates, Trinamul sources said she stayed away so as not to antagonise voters from the minorities.

 Mamatas presence at the rally would have sent a wrong signal to the minorities. She wants to keep her secular credentials intact in the run-up to the Assembly polls, said a key Trinamul functionary.

 In the 2004 Lok Sabha elections, keeping her minority votebank in mind, Mamata did not release a joint manifesto with the BJP. This time, too, she will have a manifesto of her own.

 The BJP leadership and the partys Bengal unit took strong exception to Mamatas absence. Being the chairperson of the Trinamul Congress ? an NDA ally ? Mamata should have been present at the rally to express her solidarity with the BJP, they said.

 Later tonight, Jaitleys meeting with Mamata ended inconclusively as she refused to give more than 40 seats to the BJP as part of a poll pact. She was also learnt to have disagreed on 14 seats which the BJP had specifically asked for.

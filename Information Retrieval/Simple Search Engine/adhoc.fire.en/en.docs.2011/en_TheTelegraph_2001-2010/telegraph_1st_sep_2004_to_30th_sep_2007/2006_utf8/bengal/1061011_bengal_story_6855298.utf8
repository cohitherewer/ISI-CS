The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Subrata censured for Mamata dalliance

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Oct. 10: The state Congress leadership today censured former MLA Subrata Mukherjee for laying siege to Tata Centre this afternoon to express solidarity with Mamata Banerjees agitation against Tata Motors Singur project. 

 Reading the riot act to Mukherjee was none other than his mentor, Union minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi. 

 Subrata should not have staged the demonstration in front of Tata Centre as this has sent a wrong message across the country, Das Munshi was quoted as saying.

 He also criticised the former mayor for visiting the Trinamul Congress headquarters in the city. You should have avoided visiting Trinamul Bhavan as this goes against the basic principles of the Congress. We cannot have any ties with a party that has BJP links, Das Munshi told Mukherjee at the meeting. 

 Mukherjee apparently said he would not do so in future.

 The Union minister also said Mamata will have to write to the state Congress formally if she wants the party to participate in a rally from Calcutta to Singur on November 29.

 At Das Munshis south Calcutta house, Mukherjee was isolated, a source said. 

 The I amp;B minister will send his report on Singur to defence minister and state party chief Pranab Mukherjee and AICC general secretary Margaret Alva.

 Many in the Congress feel that Mukherjee came out in Mamatas support with one eye on the post of state Congress president and another on a Rajya Sabha berth. 

 Mukherjee had overstepped his limits by visiting Trinamul Bhavan and holding a joint news conference there on the bandh, fromer Congress MLA Shankar Singh said. 

 Abdul Mannan, also a former MLA, felt the party should not compromise on ideals for a tie-up with Trinamul.

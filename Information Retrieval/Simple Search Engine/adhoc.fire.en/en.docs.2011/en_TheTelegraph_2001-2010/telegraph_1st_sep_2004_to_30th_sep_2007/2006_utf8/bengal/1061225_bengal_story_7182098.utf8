Purulia, Dec. 24: A rogue elephant that strayed into a village from the Ayodhya Hills early this morning slipped into a cowshed around 6 am and trampled to death Sumitra Kundu, who was milking a cow.

 Her husband, who was having tea in the adjoining house, rushed out hearing his wifes cries. But the killer had fled, leaving tell-tale marks of its presence but making no noise.

 The animal flung to death or crushed under its feet two others Maheswar Mahato, 40, and Bucharam Mahato, 90 who had left home to relieve themselves.

 Leaving a trail of blood at Parua on the foot-hills near Jhalda, about 325 km from Calcutta, the animal went to Barachoka village, where it injured five.

 Divisional forest officer Siddhartha Roy said the rogue was part of a herd of 17 that had been roaming the area. Villagers, he added, have been told to stay alert.

 Sumitras husband Hemanta said: I saw my wife writhing in pain with blood oozing out of gaping wounds, but I did not hear the animal entering or leaving the shed.

 Junior forest minister Bilashibala Sahish said the next of kin of those killed will get Rs 50,000 each. The government will bear the medical expenses of the injured.

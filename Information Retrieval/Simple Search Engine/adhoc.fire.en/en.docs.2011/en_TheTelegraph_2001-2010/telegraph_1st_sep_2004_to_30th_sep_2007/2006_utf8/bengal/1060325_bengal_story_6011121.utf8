The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Condition of Anil still same

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 24: There has been no improvement or deterioration in Anil Biswass condition. 

 The medical bulletin released today said the state CPM secretarys neurological and cardiovascular status remained unchanged. His blood pressure remains stable on drugs. He still requires ventilator support. Overall his condition remains stable, it said. 

 The seven-member medical team attending to Biswas, who was admitted to a private hospital last Saturday after suffering brain haemorrhage, met at eight last evening and 9 am today to evaluate the situation. 

 A clot persists in the right hemisphere of the brain, which the doctors are trying to dissolve with medicines. 

 His blood pressure, which had been fluctuating for the past three days, had been stabilised with drugs. 

 Biswas, on ventilator since admission, was briefly taken out of it on Tuesday as the doctors wanted to see whether he could breathe minus support.

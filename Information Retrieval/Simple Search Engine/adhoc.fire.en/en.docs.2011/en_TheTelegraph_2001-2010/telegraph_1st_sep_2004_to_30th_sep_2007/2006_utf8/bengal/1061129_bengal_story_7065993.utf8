 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Siliguri, Nov. 28: Nepalese Maoist leaders Mohan Baidya and Chandra Prakash Gajurel, who are lodged in a jail in Jalpaiguri, will be released in a day or two, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said here today.

 Its been decided that these two leaders would be discharged from the cases pending against them at various north Bengal police stations. They would be released immediately after the formalities are over, the chief minister said.

 A directive in this regard, signed by the home department deputy secretary, had been issued on November 22. It reached the Jalpaiguri district magistrate on Friday.

 Officials attributed the delay in releasing Baidya and Gajurel in Indian jails for about two years to formalities. 

 Anup Mitra, their lawyer, said they have been informed about the states decision. They have thanked the state.

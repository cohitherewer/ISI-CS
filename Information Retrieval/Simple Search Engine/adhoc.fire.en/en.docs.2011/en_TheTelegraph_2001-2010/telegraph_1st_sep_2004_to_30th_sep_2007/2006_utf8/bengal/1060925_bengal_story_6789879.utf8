 Deluge alarming, death count goes up

 OUR BUREAU

 Sept. 24: The flood toll went up to 47 today with nine more deaths reported from Birbhum and Murshidabad.

 The government announced an additional Rs 17 crore for 11 districts where 54 lakh people have been affected by the deluge. Around 1.8 lakh houses have been damaged, finance minister Asim Dasgupta said.

 Until the situation becomes normal, no government official associated with relief and rescue operations will go on leave, he added.

 In south Bengal, the situation is alarming despite the let-up in rain and release of water from the reservoirs. 

 We are keeping a close watch, Dasgupta said.

 Although the overall flood situation improved in Birbhum, four persons have been killed and two washed away by floodwaters since last night. 

 In Mayureswar, 260 km from Calcutta, Mistri Mardi, 30, and his wife Sundari, 24, were buried under a wall of their rain-soaked house. Islam Sau, 24, was struck by lightning this morning as was College Mete, 24, at Nanoor. 

 Moteul Sheikh, 25, and Ujjwal Chakraborty, 23, were washed away at Ahmedpur and Sainthia.

 In Murshidabad, three persons met the same fate.

 In Suti, 10-year-old Khokan Deb drowned in the floodwater, while Jakir Sheikh, 13, was washed away. In Bharatpur, 43-year-old Rafiq Sheikh was killed when his hut caved in.

 The next of kin of those killed by the flood and Tuesday nights storm would get Rs 1 lakh each, the government said. 

 Dasgupta met his civil defence counterpart, Srikumar Mukherjee, and relief and irrigation officials to review the flood situation in Calcutta, Howrah, the two 24-Parganas, East and West Midnapore, Birbhum, Murshidabad, Burdwan, Bankura and Nadia. The government had earlier sanctioned Rs 17 crore for flood relief.

 BRIEFS

 Midnapore, May 9: A sudden outbreak of cholera has claimed two lives in East Midnapore over the past two weeks. 

 More than 1,000 people have been afflicted so far in 29 villages on the outskirts of Tamluk town, 75 km from Calcutta. The dead have been identified as Soumen Gharai, 6, and Lakshman Maity, 81.

 Sudhanshu Sekhar Sahoo, the deputy chief medical officer of health of East Midnapore, said: We have had water samples tested from the affected villages and the reports are alarming. They show the presence of a special type of cholera germ, which spreads rapidly, he said. 

 New Delhi, May 9 (PTI): The Centre has decided to place before Parliament the action taken report on the findings of the Justice Mukherjee commission on the alleged disappearance of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose.

 New Delhi: The Supreme Court has directed Calcutta Port Trust to grant fresh lease of its Taratala premises to Efclon Tie-Up Ltd, which wants to restart a factory run by the earlier lessee. The court, however, added that the rent would not be based on the original lease deed but on the basis of current market rates as provided in the Schedule of the Port Trust Act. The judges also directed Port Trust to inform Efclon of the workers dues within four weeks and asked the company to pay them in two weeks after that. 

 Krishnagar: Parents of students laid siege to two schools in Nadia for several hours to vent their ire on the managements. At Lady Carmichael Primary School in Krishnagar, the parents of nearly 100 students locked the main gate in protest against a circular denying admission to children who stay far away. Guardians shut down Bagachra High School in Shantipur, saying the annual examination marksheets had glaring errors. The headmaster later admitted to the mistake and apologised.

 Calcutta: A gang of four armed youths stormed a Sealdah-bound local train from Budge Budge and robbed passengers of cash, jewellery and mobile phones worth Rs 1 lakh.

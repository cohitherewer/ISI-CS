The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 BRIEFS

 Singur, July 24: Members of the Krishi Jomi Banchao (Save Farmland) Committee blocked Durgapur Expressway 40 km from Calcutta for over two hours today protesting against land acquisition for the Tata car unit here.

 The farmers were led by local Trinamul Congress MLA Rabindranath Bhattacharya. Asked why the blockade was allowed to continue that long, Hooghly district magistrate Binod Kumar said: We didnt apply force as it was a peaceful protest.

 Calcutta: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee wrote to the Prime Minister on Monday urging him to clamp down on export of iron ore. The chief minister pointed out in his letter that India has only 18 billion tonnes of iron ore reserve, which would be depleted fast unless exports are stopped immediately. He also cited Chinas example, which uses its iron ore only for domestic needs.

 Calcutta: Detective department officials on Monday arrested Anvit Solomon Hembram, who has been accused of cheating SpiceJet of Rs 5.4 lakh. He was picked up in Delhi. Police said Hembram had created a web page similar to SpiceJets and duped the airlines prospective customers.

 Calcutta: The Centre has suggested to the state that it train fire personnel to tackle blazes that result from militant attacks. Firemen in the Maoist-hit areas, for example, are now ill-trained to deal with the aftermath of an explosion.

 Calcutta/Singur, Sept 23: The government today published a list giving details of the compensation package in Singur and the names of farmers who will get it.

 The list signals that the land for a Tata Motors small car project is deemed to have been acquired.

 But Mamata Banerjee, unaware of the move, threatened to stage a dharna outside Writers Buildings the moment poor farmers here are deprived of their land.

 The Hooghly district magistrates office will from Monday disburse cheques to farmers who have agreed to part with their plots.

 As the Left Front readied the balm for farmers, Mamata fired on all cylinders. 

 I have kept over a hundred black flags in my home, she told a rally in Singur.

 State Congress leader Abdul Mannan shared the dais with Mamata, raising hopes among party workersof a realignment of anti-Left forces.

 After the verbal blast, it was time to light the fire. 

 Mamata led about 5,000 farmers and their families, including children, carrying torches on a 2-km march. 

 If you are determined, nobody can deprive you of your land. Arise, awake and get ready for a bigger movement, she told the crowd, who responded with a thunderous applause.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Cong in a spot after BJP coup

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Dec. 5: A day after Mamata Banerjee shared the spotlight with BJP president Rajnath Singh, the Congress high command has asked the state party unit to keep safe distance from her if she continues to waver.

 Sources said Sonia Gandhis adviser Ahmed Patel communicated the party brasss stand on Mamata to the state Congress leadership. 

 Denied entry into Singur, Rajnath came to a makeshift camp at Esplanade where Mamata is on hunger strike and pledged support for the Trinamul leaders agitation against the Tata Motors project. 

 The BJPs sneak-in into the frame left state Congress leaders wondering about their own role in Mamatas movement, already in a crisis with Naxalite and other outfits stealing her thunder. 

 Trinamul and the Congress were inching close to each other since the September bypolls in the state. There was even speculation that Mamata will snap her ties with the NDA to formalise her affair with the Congress. Rajnath put paid to that.

 NDA convener George Fernandes shared dais with her this morning.

 It is a body blow to the state Congress. We had come close to Mamata since she backed our Malda Lok Sabha candidate and we supported her nominee for the Bongaon Assembly seat. But all our efforts to firm up the relations have come a cropper now that she has renewed her ties with the NDA, state Congress working president Pradip Bhattacharya said.

 Bhattacharya, former PCC chief Somen Mitra and some others were leading a procession to Mamatas camp yesterday when they heard about the BJP leaders presence and suspended the march midway, near Mayo Road. 

 Sources said some Congress supporters had worked for Mamatas candidate for yesterdays Islampur bypoll, though the party had its own nominee there. 

 But she invited the BJP to share a platform with her, said state Congress general secretary Shankar Singh. Its now clear that Mamata is unwilling to snap ties with the BJP and so we cannot join hands with her, he added. 

 The beleaguered Bengal Congress was also handicapped by the Centres decision to support chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees drive for industrialisation.

 We cannot oppose the Tata Motors project simply for oppositions sake. It shouldnt appear that we are opposed to industry. At the same time, being in the Opposition, we have to raise our voice against the CPMs move to acquire farmland for industry, the Congress working president said.

 Striking the balance wont be easy and a Congress leader admitted that they were in a spot.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Faster land takeover

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Feb. 14: The government today decided to fast-track development projects by simplifying the procedure for land acqui-sition. 

 The cabinet today agreed in principle to cut down the time required to acquire land from 36 months to six months and fifteen days. Detailed rules on where and how the procedures will be shortened and simplified will be framed and published later, a senior minister said.

 Urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya, who spurred the initiative, had raised the issue with land and land reforms minister Abdur Rezzak Molla some time ago. 

 Bhattacharya, whose department is implementing several township projects ? two of them in Dankuni and Sonarpur ? with private participation, said 36 months was an abnormally long period and contributed to the delay in completion of work.

 The cabinet today approved the acquisition of 4,800 acres for the Dankuni township. The land, across 22 mouzas, will be acquired in phases.

 It will now cost entrepreneurs more to set up private engineering and medical colleges and academic institutes in the state. 

 The cabinet today green-lighted a steep hike in the salami paid for leasing out government land for such projects.

 Earlier, parties taking plots on lease for 30 years were required to pay a salami of 2 per cent of the market value of the land. This has now been hiked to 40 per cent. However, the lease period has also been extended to 99 years, a senior official said. 

 The move would ensure stable control of land for the entrepreneurs and bring in more revenue for the land reforms department.

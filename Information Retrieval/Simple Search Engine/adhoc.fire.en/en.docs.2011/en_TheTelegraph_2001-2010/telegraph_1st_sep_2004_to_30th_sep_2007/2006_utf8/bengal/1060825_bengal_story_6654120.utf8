 Five drown in canal

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Midnapore, Aug. 24: Four women and a young girl drowned last night in Ketai canal, a tributary of the Shilabati, in West Midnapores Garbeta.

 Four others, including two children, are missing.

 The block development officer of Garbeta, Dibyendu Bhattacharya, said a group of around 100 from Bhedua village, about 200 km from Calcutta, had gone to bury a woman in Dewan on the other side of the canal. On their way back, a villager ferried them across as they could not find the boatman. About 10 persons were crossing the canal at a time.

 During one of these trips, the boat, which was packed with women, capsized and everyone fell into the water. The canal had grown rough after three days of heavy rain in the district.

 The other members of the group raised an alarm and villagers rushed to the spot. They fished out the bodies of Salema Bibi, 65, Mumtaz Begum, 40, Rubia Bibi, 33, Sabina Khatun, 8, and Tulona Bibi, 31. 

 According to witnesses, Tulona saved her one-and-half-year-old son and three others before being washed away.

 Tulona was always a brave woman. After the boat capsized, she first caught her drowning son by the hair and swam to the bank and threw him into the waiting hands of villagers. Then, instead of climbing out of the water, she swam back to rescue others. She managed to bring three women to safety. But then she became tired and could not fight the turbulent waters anymore, said Anwara Bibi, who watched her friend go down from the bank of the canal.

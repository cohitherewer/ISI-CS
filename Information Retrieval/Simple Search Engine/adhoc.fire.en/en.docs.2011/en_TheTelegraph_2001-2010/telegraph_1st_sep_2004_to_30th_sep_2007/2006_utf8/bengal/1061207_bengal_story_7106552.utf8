 Singur/Calcutta, Dec. 6: Fencing of the plot for Tata Motors continued in peace today, but the Hooghly administration had to dress up to foil another Trinamul Congress bid to enter Singur ignoring prohibitory orders tomorrow.

 Mamata Banerjee today threatened a law and order problem if the administration stood in the way, though she would not be part of the march because fasting for three days has left her fatigued. 

 Im not keeping well. Thousands of our party activists will take part in the march, she said.

 MLA Sonali Guha, who was also on fast, had to be hospitalised today after she fell ill.

 The government should not take any step tomorrow that could lead to a confrontation, the Trinamul chief said. If the law and order situation deteriorates, the government will have to own responsibility. I urge the police not to create a situation like that. 

 Hooghly superintendent of police Supratim Sarkar said the Trinamul supporters would not be allowed to come anywhere near Singur. We will arrange additional forces. Prohibitory orders under section 144 of the CrPC are in force in Singur. Strong action will be taken if attempts are made to break the law, Sarkar said.

 BJP president Rajnath Singh may have pledged support for Mamatas agitation, but party colleague M. Venkaiah Naidu said in Delhi today: In Bengal, let me be very clear that we are not against the Tatas setting up industry. They are a premier industrial house.

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said in Calcutta he did not know about Trinamuls Singur Chalo. I dont know what shes doing, I am just speaking for myself. Ta- ta Motors officials are coming for sure, he asserted, adding that his officials were in touch with the company.

 The police had prevented Mamata from entering Singur on two earlier occasions. Trinamul leaders said they did not want her to be heckled by the police again.

 Tomorrows march will be held under the banner of the Krishi Jomi Banchao (save farmland) Committee. Party workers have been asked to assemble around 11 am at the Baidyabati Sporting Club ground, about 40 km from Calcutta.

 A huge contingent of police, combat force and rapid action force personnel stood guard as the fencing work entered its fourth day. 

 Steel nets are being fixed to posts that have already been erected and we hope to finish the entire job within a day or two at the most, said M.V. Rao, director of industries. 

 Local CPM leaders, however, expressed fear that Naxalites and Trinamul workers may try to pull down the fencing in the coming days. 

 So our party workers will help the police man the entire stretch. More than 800 party men are ready to work in three shifts to protect the fencing, said Suhrid Dutta, secretary of the CPM zonal committee.

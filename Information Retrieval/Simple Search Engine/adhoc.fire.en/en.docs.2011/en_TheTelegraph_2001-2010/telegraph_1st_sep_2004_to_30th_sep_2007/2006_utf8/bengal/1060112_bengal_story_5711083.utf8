The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Panel alleges teacher slight

 RABI BANERJEE

 Krishnagar, Jan. 11: Retired and working headmasters, from a team formed to assess performance of secondary schoolteachers of Nadia and impart training to them, have complained of humiliation by the teachers.

 However, the aggrieved headmasters of primary schools have not made specific charges against any teacher.

 The headmasters were also part of the team sent across the district to assess the quality of teaching in nearly 3,000 primary schools. About 1,500 teachers out of 8,000 do not have the skill and attitude to teach at the primary level, they had said in their report.

 One of the retired headmasters from Karimpur, Pankaj Ghosh, said teachers of a school he visited became angry when during a training session, he advised them to have patience while dealing with students.

 A teacher told me to get lost. When I told him that we primary teachers know better how to deal with indisciplined boys, he asked me to shut up, said Ghosh.

 Gobinda Ghosh, the headmaster of Nabadwip Primary School and part of the team, echoed Pankaj Ghosh. I will request the district administration to exclude me from the team, he said.

 The team, which was sent to assess the performance of secondary school teachers in October, is yet to complete its work. The Sarba Siksha Abhijan Committee funded the project. There are about 1,000 secondary schools in Nadia.

 Nadia district magistrate Rajesh Pandey said he had received the complaint and told the schools managing committees that such incidents should not happen in future.

 If the secondary school authorities are facing problems having their teachers trained by primary teachers, they should have raised it when meetings were held and the teams were set up. 

 The retired and working primary headmasters were included in the team after they did a good job in assessing primary teachers. What the complaints mention is disturbing, said Pandey, who is also the director of the Sarba Siksha Abhijan Committee in the district. 

 Pandey said he would review the situation next year and, if necessary, fresh teams would be set up.

 The headmasters also lodged a complaint with the chairman of the primary school council in Nadia, Bibhash Biswas.The secondary teachers could not stand the presence of the primary teachers. They thought they are more capable than the primary teachers and refused to be assessed by them, he said.

Brother follows sister in death

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Apu and Durga look at a steam engine in wonder from a kash field abloom in Satyajit Rays film rendition of Bibhuti Bhushans classic. Shovan and Sumana shared their little joys and concerns much the same way

 Behrampore, May 24: Like little Apu in Bibhuti Bhushans Pather Panchali, five-year-old Shovan Haldar would trail elder sister Sumana wherever she went.

 In an urban milieu, they did not have kash fields to roam or be wonderstruck by a train engine as in the novel made popular to the world audience by Satyajit Ray, but the siblings were always together in their two-storey house in Behrampore town.

 Yesterday afternoon, 10-year-old Sumana became breathless all of a sudden. She passed away a few hours later, at Behrampore Sadar Hospital.

 Hearing the news, Shovan fell unconscious. The same hospital declared him dead.

 Apu, too, had to bear Durgas death. He survived it, unlike Shovan. 

 The hospital sent the body for post-mortem as he was brought in unconscious.

 Prima facie, it appears that he couldnt bear the shock of his sisters death and died of a cerebral attack, said Ananda Mondal, the deputy superintendent of the hospital, who conducted the post-mortem.

 The daughter of a BSF jawan posted in Jammu, Sumana suffered from asthma and was under strict medical super- vision. 

 Last November, she was taken to Vellore for treatment following a bout of serious illness. Then a Class III stu- dent at a private primary school, she had to skip classes for a month.

 Realising that his sister was suffering from a serious ailment, Shovan became more attentive towards her. Sumana doted over Shovan. We would often refer to Durgas love for Apu seeing them together. She used to bathe him, comb his hair and nurse him when he fell ill, said Swapan Das, a maternal uncle.

 The children lived with mother Shankari at her parents place. The mother has been fainting on and off since being told about the deaths.

 Father Subhas Haldar has been informed. He is already on his way home. The childrens bodies are being preserved for him.

 Their neighbours at Manindranagar Colony, about 200 km from Calcutta, recalled how the brother would dart around in a tricycle with the sister following him and asking him to be cautious.

 They were well-mannered and polite. Were shocked, said Jharna Mondal, a middle-aged neighbour.

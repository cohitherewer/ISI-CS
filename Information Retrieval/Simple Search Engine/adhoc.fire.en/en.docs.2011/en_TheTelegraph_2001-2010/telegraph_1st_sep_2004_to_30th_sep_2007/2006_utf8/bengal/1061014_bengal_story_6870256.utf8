The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, Oct. 13: Former MLA Atish Sinha quit the Congress today in protest against the humiliation the party had meted out to him. 

 I am left with no other option, Sinha told a news conference. The seven-time Cong- ress MLA from Kandi, Murshidabad, lost to an Independent fielded by Behrampore Congress MP Adhir Chowdhury in the election this May.

 Calcutta: The land use board will conduct a survey to determine the exact nature of land in the state, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said. The study will find out the status of land use and how much land is now being used for agriculture. The chief minister said: It will help us find how much land is available for industry and urbanisation.

 Barasat: Members of a local club in North 24-Parganas Bongaon stopped a tourist from north Bengal on Friday and asked for Rs 101 from its driver as Kali Puja subscription. As he refused to pay, they dragged him out and started beating him. When some of the passengers intervened, they were roughed up as well. Five people had to be hospitalised. Thirteen members of Santoshpur Sammelani Club, 80 km from Calcu-tta, have been arrested.

 Midnapore: Residents spotted a round object at Nutundihi village near Pirakata forest in West Midnapore, 175 km from Calcutta, on Friday and suspected a Maoist booby trap. The bomb squad later said it was a country-made bomb.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Focus on Calcutta twins civic uplift

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 7: Amid increasing fear that a boom for Calcutta would mean neglect for its twin, urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya met officers of the Howrah civic body, the CMDA and his own team today to chart a course of action.

 At the meeting, the Howrah Municipal Corporation was asked to become self-dependent and lay emphasis on means of revenue generation. 

 Ways to strengthen the civic administration and to increase efficiency also figured in the talks.

 The government has drawn up an ambitious Howrah Rejuvenation Plan at an estimated cost of Rs 1,000 crore. 

 As part of it, a string of projects would be undertaken over five years in Howrah town, Bally, Shibpur, Belur, Tikiapara, Shalimar and Uluberia. 

 The scheme includes setting up water treatment plants, storm water drainage systems and a solid waste management mechanism and improvement of the sewerage and widening and lighting of major roads leading to the Howrah station, Delhi Road and Bombay Road.

 The CMDA will implement the project with help from the Howrah civic body and the Howrah Improvement Trust. 

 A portion of the money would come from the British department for international development (DFID) and the rest from private investors, the CMDA and the corporation. 

 The DFID is expected to provide Rs 1 crore to prepare an item-wise plan for the project.

 Talks are also on with the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank for funds. 

 The Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners have taken the initiative to widen Foreshore Road and construct a ramp on the Vidyasagar Setu to ease the traffic to Howrah station.

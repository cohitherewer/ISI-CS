 Calcutta, Dec. 9: A day after Rohan Gupta went missing, police traced him to a guesthouse in Chandernagore in Hooghly and brought him back to his parents. 

 The six-year-old was allegedly abducted by an acquaintance of the Guptas identified as Santosh Gupta on Friday and taken to the guesthouse, about 50 km from Calcutta.

 Late this evening, Pradip Agarwal, about whom the police refused to give details, was held in Howrah in connection with the kidnapping. 

 In his early 20s, Santosh worked for Rohans father Bankelal about a year and a half ago. Subsequently, he never visited the Guptas in Sinthi, off BT Road, but kept in touch. 

 Hours after he allegedly picked up Rohan from a playground, Santosh called the Guptas seeking Rs 50 lakh as ransom. 

 We had traced the call and were tracking him down when Chandernagore police informed us about Rohans whereabouts, a senior officer of the Sinthi police station said. It appears that Santosh did it to make some fast money, but it isnt clear why he required such a huge amount. 

 He had checked in with the child at the guesthouse around 3 pm yesterday, registering himself as Ajay Kaushik of Benares. Sensing trouble, he fled leaving the boy behind. 

 The police said while working for Bankelal, he had sought Rs 2,000, which he believed was due to him. Bankelal insisted that he had given it to Santoshs uncle Ram Sagar Shaw, who still works for him. 

 Ram Sagar, who is in Orissa, will be questioned, the officer said. The Dunlop resident played a key role in getting Santosh to work for Bankelal.

 The guesthouse caretaker, Hiralal Rajjak, called the police last night after hearing a child cry inside a locked room. 

 Rohan said Santosh uncle, who had promised him a toffee, brought him here, said an officer of the Chandernagore police station. 

 Rohans mother Usha told the police that Santosh called up Sujit Rohans cousin yesterday morning and asked him to bring the child to the local ground. Then he gave Sujit toffees and biscuits and asked Rohan to get into a Tata Sumo, said an officer.

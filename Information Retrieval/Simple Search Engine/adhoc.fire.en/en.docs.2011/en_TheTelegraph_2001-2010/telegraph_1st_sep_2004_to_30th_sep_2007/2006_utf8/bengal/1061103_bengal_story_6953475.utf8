The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Bihar cops raid, state in dark

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Nov. 2: Bengal police were left groping for words today for the second time in a week after their counterparts from Bihar arrested a person from Budge Budge on the charge of cheating, leaving them in the dark.

 Prabhash Chatterjee was picked up in the early hours by a police team from Bihars Munger district, allegedly for cheating more than 200 people out of Rs 2 crore.

 The additional superintendent of police (industrial) of South 24-Parganas, D.P. Singh, said he had heard about the incident. 

 We are trying to get through to our counterparts in Bihar to get the details of the case and the arrest. However, they are authorised to arrest a person if they have an arrest warrant, Singh said.

 Residents said a black Qualis screeched to a halt in the early hours in the neighbourhood and a five-member team raided Chatterjees house. 

 Within half an hour he was escorted to the car and they drove off. He had cheated a lot of people here as well. We were on the lookout for him but he had escaped to Bihar. We had no idea that he was back, said Bidyut Sarkar, a resident.

 Police officials said even though Bengal police were not officially informed about the raid, they had some information about it.

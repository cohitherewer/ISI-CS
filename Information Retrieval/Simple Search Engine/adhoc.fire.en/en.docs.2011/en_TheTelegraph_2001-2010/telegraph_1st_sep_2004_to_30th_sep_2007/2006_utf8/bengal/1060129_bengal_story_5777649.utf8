The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Thieves strike as lady prays

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Jan. 28: Rama Bhowmik was engrossed in her morning prayers when a gang of three tiptoed into her house and slipped out with Rs 3 lakh in cash.

 The operation was a cakewalk for the trio ? barely in their twenties ? who entered through the door of the Bhowmiks CIT Road home in central Calcutta that had been kept open for the milkman, the newspaper vendor and the flower-seller. 

 One member of the gang gagged Rama as his two accomplices cleaned out her almirahs. 

 Around 7.30 in the morning, I was almost done with my prayers when I suddenly felt a firm hand clasping my mouth. Immediately, I held on to my gold necklace and tried to scream. But I couldnt. All I saw was a frail youth standing in front, passing on the keys of the almirahs to two others. It was an experience no one should go through, the 75-year-old housewife said. 

 When her 45-year-old son Arghya, who arrived from Malaysia late last night, walked into Ramas room, the gang fled leaving behind a bag containing jewellery.

 The others in the house ?Ramas 86-year-old husband and a domestic help ? were not even aware of the break-in, which was carried out in a flash.

 Officers from Phoolbagan police station have launched a combing operation in the area and have detained the familys driver, Sitaram, for interrogation. 

 This is the second such incident in the locality ? behind BC Roy Memorial Hospital for Children. In mid- December, the Bhowmiks next-door neighbours were the victims of another gang. 

 The detective department of Calcutta police, too, has swung into action with the cops employing the services of a sniffer dog.

 A domestic help looks after the daily chores of the Bhowmik family and the rest is left to the driver. A local resident, Sitaram has been with the family since 1998 and is privy to almost everything that goes on in the house. 

 Yesterday, he went to receive me at the airport. This morning, he was the first to spot a pair of slippers left behind by the gang under my mothers cot. Its so confusing that now we dont know whom to believe, Arghya said. 

 The police are tight-lipped. We are doing our part. Lets keep our fingers crossed and hope for the best, said deputy commissioner Vineet Goyal.

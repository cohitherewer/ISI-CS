The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Woman stripped and beaten in village square

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Jan. 16: A woman was stripped of her sari, slapped and kicked in front of her children and some hundred villagers for allegedly stealing a spinning wheel.

 Thirty-year-old Rina Das was tied up to a tree in the courtyard of a weavers house at Dubra village in Nadias Chakdah, 70 km from Calcutta, for several hours on Saturday until a panchayat leader stepped in.

 The woman, a part-time weaver herself, lodged a police complaint this afternoon after overcoming fear that her sons ? Sanat, 6, and Biplab, 8 ? would be harmed.

 On Saturday morning, Rinas neighbours Dulal Das and Milan Das discovered that two of their spinning wheels ? worth about Rs 9,000 in the local market ? were missing. They suspected her as she often went to them for hanks of strings.

 Rina was cooking when they stormed into her house and dragged her out. Scared for their mother, little Sanat and Biplab followed her.

 On reaching the village square, Dulal and Milan dubbed her a thief and started beating her up. Sanat and Biplab started crying but no one from over 100 onlookers came forward to help.

 I dont know how they lost their charkhas (spinning wheels), but they blamed me for the theft. They dragged me out of my house when I was cooking for my children. They tore away my sari and beat me up mercilessly in front of many people, Rina said, breaking down in tears. 

 Her husband Babu works as a farm labourer in another village and returns home late every night. 

 After about half an hour of thrashing, the weaver duo took her away from the square near the village market saying they would hand her over to police at a camp 2 km from there. But they took her to Dulals house.

 Panchayat pradhan Subal Das rescued Rina. I was not in the village when the incident occurred. I returned in the afternoon and rushed to the police camp, but no one was there. I found Rina in Dulals house, tied up and crying in pain, he said.

 Nadia superintendent of police R. Rajsekharan said Dulal and Milan are absconding. A hunt is on.

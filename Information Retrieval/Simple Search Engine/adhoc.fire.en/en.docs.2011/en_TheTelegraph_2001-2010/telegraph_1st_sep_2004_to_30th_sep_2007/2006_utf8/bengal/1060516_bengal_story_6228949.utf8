 Family suspect in tutor hacking

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, May 15: Daud Mondal, who retired from a private company in Calcutta five years ago and taught children at home here now, was hacked to death last evening and his entire family has come under the web of suspicion.

 Police, yet to establish the motive behind the murder, have detained his youngest daughter Chandrani, her husband Kashi Rao and Rosemary, Mondals son Anandas estranged wife. All of them live in Krishnagar town, ab-out 85 km from Calcutta. 

 Ananda works in a hotel in Mumbai. Mondals elder daughter Latika lives in Bangalore with her husband.

 Around 6 pm yesterday, Mondal, 65, gave his wife Sabita Rs 200 to buy a statuette of Jesus Christ from the local market.

 The police came to know about the murder around 9 pm. When they reached his single-storey house ? in the towns Bowbazar area ? he was lying in a pool of blood in the drawing room. A news channel, which he had tuned to, was still breaking news, though of something far from Krishnagar.

 Deputy superintendent of police, headquarters, Prafulla Saha, who led the police team, said Mondals torso bore multiple marks of injury. He had been struck several times on the neck. 

 The police interrogated Sabita, Chandrani, 22, and Kashi Rao, a quack who lives in a rented house a stones throw from Mondals home. Rosemary, who lives with her two-year-old daughter, was also questioned.

 Mondal had got a will prepared in which he wrote his house and the cash in his bank account in Chandranis name, the police said.

 Chandrani has lodged an FIR, blaming Rosemary for her fathers murder.

 Two years ago, Rosemary had lodged a case of mental and physical torture against Ananda, the police said. The case is still being heard.

 She (Rosemary) stole our happiness. She also got us arrested. It is she who employed a gang to kill my father, Chandrani screamed during her interrogation last night.

 We find the murder very mysterious. We suspect that a close relative in involved. But we are ruling out nothing at this stage. The detained persons are being intensely interrogated, said Nadia superintendent of police R. Rajsekharan. 

 Another officer said: We detained Rosemary, Chandrani and her husband because there were discrepancies in their statements. Even Mondals wife is not above suspicion. But we didnt detain her as she is 60 years old, .

 The police said Sabita had told them that she left the house around 7 pm. But Mondal was most probably killed between 6 and 6.30.

 When the police arrived at 9 pm, rigor mortis had set in on Mondal. That means, he must have been killed at least two-and-a-half hours before that.

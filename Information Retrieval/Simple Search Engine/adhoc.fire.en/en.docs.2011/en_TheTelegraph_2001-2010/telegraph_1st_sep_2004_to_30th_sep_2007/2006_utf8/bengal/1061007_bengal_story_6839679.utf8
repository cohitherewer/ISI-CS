Calcutta, Oct. 6: Sushant Chandak, the Calcuttan engulfed in a BPO data theft scandal, may have evolved his system of stealing clients security details during a two-year stint at a Delhi call centre, police said today.

 Chandak, who disappeared from his Nagerbazar apartment in north Calcutta on October 2, the day The Telegraph reported the scandal, had left the call centre three years ago.

 He must have exploited holes in the firms security system and transferred the database from the call centres computer to his personal notebook, a police sleuth said.

 Chandak became a victim of a sting operation by Britains Channel 4, to whom he allegedly offered to sell a database with credit card details of 200,000 people. He also claimed to possess passport numbers, driving licence numbers and personal banking details.

 The TV channels expose, The Data Theft Scandal, purportedly shows Chandak boasting about having a network of agents in call centres across India.

 It seems Chandak came in touch with the agents while working in Delhi and managed to steal the bulk of the data before quitting his job, the detective said. We suspect he built his network by tapping his old contacts.

 He added that call centres followed the standard security norm of not allowing staff to carry personal belongings like mobiles or writing pads while they worked.

 Paper and pen is provided by the company. Besides, the sheets on which an employee jots down customers details are destroyed by the security staff. Besides, an employee has to go through a strict security check, the detective said. 

 Chandak must have found a way to beat the system at the BPO where he worked.

 The polices chief cyber detective, Naseem Ali, spoke of a woman BPO worker whom he had arrested recently on the charge of making purchases by using clients credit card details. The woman wrote the details on small pieces of paper and hid them in her innerwear. Chandak may have adopted the same method.

 North 24-Parganas police chief Praveen Kumar, whose area includes all the call centres in Sector V, said: We cannot provide security checks for call centres. They should follow the checking instructions in toto.

 Aditya Bajoria, chairman of city-based BPO Vishnu Solutions, said: Most BPOs employ stringent measures to prevent data leak. (But) I admit that more care should be taken.

 Tea and coconut water after fast

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Dec. 29: Mamata Banerjee drank tea and co-conut water this morning to break her 25-day fast. 

 The Trinamul chief was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of a south Calcutta nursing home past midnight after she called off her fast over farmland acquisition for the Tata Motors factory in Singur. 

 She is extremely fond of tea and drank a cup, and a glass of coconut water in the morning, said Sudarshan Ghosh Dastidar, a member of the medical team monitoring Mamatas health.

 On being admitted to the nursing home, she was administered intravenous fluids, minerals and vitamins. 

 According to doctors, she was conscious and suffering from acute gastritis. It is the fallout of such a long fast. Once the gastritis is brought under control, she will be given semi-solid food, said Ghosh Dastidar. That could be tomorrow afternoon.

 Although her blood pressure has improved, the heartbeat is irregular. 

 She is extremely weak and unwilling to talk. Tests have shown that she is suffering from liver dysfunction too, a doctor said. 

 Banerjee has been on oxygen support since December 23, when she complained of respiratory distress. 

 She also had complaints of chest and abdominal pain and muscle cramp. The team attending to her comprises a pulmonary medicine expert, a cardiologist and gynaecologists. Mamatas blood oxygen level and other parameters are being checked and ECGs are being done at regular intervals.

 Witch couple chased out

 - Farmer 

 loses all after village verdict 

 ABHIJEET CHATTERJEE 

 Kalna, Aug. 30: When some six cows died of an unknown disease and several children fell ill in the tribal village of Mushidpur six months ago, worried residents called a meeting. 

 At the meeting chaired by a village elder, 60-year-old Ravan Murmu, various possibilities behind the scourge were discussed. Suddenly, a young man, Chhotu, suggested that an ojha (witch doctor) be called.

 Then started the nightmare of a middle-aged couple Kalipada Hembram, 50, and his wife Sombari, 40. 

 An ojha arrived at Mushidpur, in the Kalna area of Burdwan, the next day. 

 Kalipada and Sombari waited anx- iously for his verdict like others in the village. 

 We waited as the ojha performed a puja. After the puja, he sat for dhyan (meditation) and suddenly mumbled my name and my wifes, proclaiming us to be witches because of whom the livestock died and the children fell ill, Kalipada said. 

 Even before the ojha had finished chanting how they had been casting an evil spell on the village, Kalipada and Sombari had been branded witches by fellow villagers. 

 After the witch doctor left, Ravan ordered the couple and their children out of Mushidpur, about 220 km from Calcutta. Some of the neighbours, friends till the other day, were baying for their blood. 

 Scared, Kalipada and Sombari gathered their three daughters, between 12 and 22 years old, and fled. 

 Kalipada put up at a relatives at nearby Baidyanathpur. He alleged that the small piece of land that he used to till for a living had been taken over.

 Kalipada lodged a complaint and a team of policemen took them back to their village. But, when the policemen returned, Ravan and other villagers attacked Kalipada and his wife and beat them up, forcing them to flee the village again.

 They threatened to burn us alive if we did not leave within 24 hours. We had no option but to run away again, Kalipada said. 

 The family has sought help from the police and the district administration. How long can we stay in a relatives house? They are also very poor. We are a burden on them. We want to return home get back our land, he said. 

 Four months after the incident, all that the administration has done is give assurances. Kalna subdivisional officer Srikumar Chakraborty said the Kalna-II block development officer will conduct an inquiry. 

 We have to find out what exactly happened. Let us see what we can do, Chakraborty said. 

 Subdivisional police officer Imran Wahab promised to look into the matter. I have told the Kalna police station officer-in-charge to investigate the case, said Wahab. 

 However, Ravan is adamant. I have no objection if they want to return to the village. But, before that, they will have to prove their innocence, he said.

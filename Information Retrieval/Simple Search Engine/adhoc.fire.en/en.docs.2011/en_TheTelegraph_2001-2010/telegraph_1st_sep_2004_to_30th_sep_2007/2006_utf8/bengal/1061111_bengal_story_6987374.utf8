 BRIEFS

 Raiganj, Nov. 10: Two journalists were thrashed by police constables here on Friday morning while reporting an incident in which a fruit vendor had been shot through the abdomen by a policeman.

 Sanjit Mukherjee and Swarup Dutta have been hospitalised. Dutta is said to be in a critical condition. Witnesses said he was kicked and punched for about 15 minutes. North Dinajpur superintendent P.K. Sanyal said constable Pintu Sen was loading his rifle when it went off accidentally and hit fruit seller Kartik Pramanik. Sen has been suspended. A probe into the constables conduct has been ordered.

 Calcutta: The transport department will soon initiate phase II of concretisation of tram tracks. Areas like Rashbehari and Gariahat will be covered in this phase, transport minister Subhas Chakraborty said at Writers Buildings. Over 60 km of tracks will be laid on concrete at a cost of Rs 20 crore. Work on the first phase will be completed by June, the minister added.

 Calcutta: The government has decided to acquire and refurbish Sister Niveditas house in Bose Para Lane in Bagbazar and hand it over to the Ramakrishna Sarada Mission. The mission had earlier requested chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to acquire the house.

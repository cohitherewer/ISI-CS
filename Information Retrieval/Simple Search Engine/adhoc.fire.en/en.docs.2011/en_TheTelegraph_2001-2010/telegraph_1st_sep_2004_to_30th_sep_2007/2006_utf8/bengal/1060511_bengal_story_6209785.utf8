The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Try a coal mine for sightseeing

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 A miner: Under tourist gaze

 Asansol, May 10: Plunging some 300 feet underground in an iron cage or watching the effect of 2,000 degrees Celsius on raw iron will feature on a Bengal tourist map soon. But better be prepared, it wont be for the faint-hearted.

 Industrial tourism may be new to these parts, but the Asansol Chamber of Commerce is keen to make a pioneering effort. The two-day holiday package will include visits to coal mines and some of the major industries in the Durgapur-Asansol belt. 

 The initial target is to capture tourists visiting Bakreswar, Tarapith and Santiniketan in Birbhum, Bishnupur and Muk-utmanipur in Bankura and the Ayodhya hills in Purulia. 

 Weve placed a formal proposal with the government. The tourism department has accepted our proposal and assured co-operation, said Subroto Dutta, secretary of the chamber of commerce. 

 The proposed tour package, Dutta said, will be a mixture of adventure and education.

 At the coal mines, tourists can see how the rock walls are blasted and how coal is raised. Weve already approached Eastern Coalfields Ltd (ECL) authorities, requesting them to allow us into its mines for tourists. They welcomed the proposal, he added. 

 Dipak Chakraborty, its chairman-cum-managing director, said: The proposal to use our mines as tourist spots is excellent. People should know how coal, an essential fuel for industries and power plants, is raised from great depths and how miners work. The ECL will not charge any money from tourists willing to visit the mines.

 At the Durgapur Steel Plant (DSP) or the Chittaranjan Locomotive Works, the tourists will get a first- hand experience of how steel is made or how a railway engine is manufactured.

 Workers are cooped inside a heat-proof glass cabin about 10 feet from a steel plant blast furnace. A drop of molten steel will burn a hole through human flesh in a split second.

 Tourism officials confirmed that the proposal is with them. Well have to study the safety aspects of tourists in a coal mine or a steel plant, said one of them.

 Like ECL, DSP authorities welcomed the move. Its chief of communications said: The tour organisers will have to write to us at least a week in advance. Our officials and security personnel will accompany them during the tour.

 DSP will also not charge the tourists, but the officer warned that in summer, it is sometimes unbearable inside the plant.

 Chittaranjan Loco Works sources said they are yet to receive the proposal.

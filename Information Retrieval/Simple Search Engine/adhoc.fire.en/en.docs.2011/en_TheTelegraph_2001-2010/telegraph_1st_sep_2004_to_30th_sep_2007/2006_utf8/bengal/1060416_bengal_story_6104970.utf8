 CU faculty on clash course

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, April 15: Calcutta Universitys course revision plan has run into rough weather with teachers bickering over the number of honours papers in the first year.

 After splitting the undergraduate examinations into three parts, the university was set to revise the course this year.

 But while the science teachers are demanding a minimum of two honours papers in the Part I syllabus, their humanities counterparts want one.

 Fed up, the CU authorities have decided to put the revision plan in the backburner till the teachers stop fighting.

 Caught in the tussle are nearly two lakh students waiting to take admission to BA, BSc and BCom courses in June-end.

 It really makes sense if the honours papers are split into three parts... as the workload can be divided and life will be simpler, said Susmita Bagchi, a student. 

 According to the original plan, students did not have to study a single honours paper in their first year. Four were to be taught in Part II and the remaining four in Part III.

 But the pattern triggered a roar of protest from students, who demanded that they be taught at least one honours paper in the first year. This prompted the university to decide on a fresh revision of the undergraduate course.

 The university sought the opinion of the boards of studies of various subjects in which honours courses are offered.

 There is a difference of opinion among some teachers over fixing the number of honours papers in the Part I syllabus, said Suranjan Das, CUs pro vice-chancellor, academic affairs.

 A meeting of the undergraduate council of the university will be held next week. 

 The teachers will have to take a unanimous decision before the meeting. Only then will the university finalise its decision, he said.

 According to a member of one of the boards of studies, including an honours paper in the Part I syllabus would lessen the students burden in the next two years. Otherwise, they will find it difficult to manage entire the honours syllabus in the Part II and Part-III examinations, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Womens panel on witch mission

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 A Telegraph report about the plight of Haridasi and her family

 Krishnagar, Sept. 10: Branded witches and chased out of their village, Haridasi Sardar and her family of 14 have found a helping hand in the state womens commission.

 On September 1, residents of Nadias Balaighata had driven out the 65-year-old widow, her sons and their wives and children, accusing them of casting a black magic spell on the village. 

 Police tried to help them return home but the villagers, armed with sticks and sickles, stood in the way. 

 Today, a womens commission team led by vice-chairperson Rama Das visited Ranaghat. They spoke to members of the CPM and the RSP womens wings as well as district officials.

 Das said Haridasi seems to be a victim of some personal grudge. We have encountered such instances before. It is not because of any superstition but personal grudge that she and her family members were branded witches.

 Haridasi, too, has claimed that the villagers were jealous of her family as it was the wealthiest in the village. 

 The womens panel chief said she would take up the matter with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. 

 She slammed the police and the administration for failing to resolve the matter when Haridasi was first targeted six years ago.

 The local administration 

 should have solved the problem then. This time, eight days 

 have already elapsed. Now it is too late to force her back 

 to her village. The administration has no other way than 

 to invite local NGOs and others to convince the villagers, 

 Das said.

 Pranab somersault: Maidan not for all rallies

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Dec. 31: Two days after he opened Brigade Parade Grounds to all and sundry, defence minister Pranab Mukherjee retracted his statement and said rallies would rarely be permitted on the Maidan in future.

 We know that the Maidan is damaged due to the large number of rallies that take place here. In future, organisers will rarely be permitted to hold such rallies, he said this evening, responding to queries from the media.

 The minister conceded that granting permission to the Co-ordination Committee rally was a special case and his ministry would be more selective in future.

 What he left unsaid was that chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had intervened and requested Mukherjee for permission to hold the rally on December 28 after Fort William declined to give the nod to the CPM government employees union.

 Mukherjee today also ruled out granting permission to private organisations to either hold meetings or functions at the Maidan. We are not thinking along these lines at the moment, he said.

 Two days ago, the defence minister had said public meetings would be allowed on the Maidan, not only by political parties but also by NGOs and other organisations.

 The turnaround comes after a series of reports in The Telegraph on the damage being inflicted on the Maidan by lakhs of feet trampling the grass during rallies.

 Yesterday, Fort William had put on hold its plans for keeping the Maidan green through the year as it waited in apprehension for another CPM rally on January 8. 

 Banani Kakkar of the NGO, Public, welcomed the defence ministers change of heart, calling it a step in the right direction. The Maidan is definitely overused, especially in winter, when it is not in top form. This makes the grass totally worn and dry. Thousands of footfalls also raise dust and the soil is also lost in the process, she said. 

 According to Kakkar, the Maidan should be used sparingly and only after guidelines are framed for its judicious use.

 Kushal Mukherjee of Prakriti Sanshad expressed relief at the turn of events.

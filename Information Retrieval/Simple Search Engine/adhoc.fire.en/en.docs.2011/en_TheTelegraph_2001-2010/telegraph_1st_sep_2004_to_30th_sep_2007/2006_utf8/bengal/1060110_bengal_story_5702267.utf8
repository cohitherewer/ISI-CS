The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 No to polls for lack of power

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Birbhum, Jan. 9: The political scene in Bengal is hotting up and so are the tempers of the 400-odd residents of Vidyanagar, 235 km from Calcutta.

 Over 200 of them will not vote this time because their village has not got electricity despite repeated pleas and promises and even after having boycotted the pulse polio programme since last January. 

 About a hundred of Vidyanagars children have stopped going to the Shishu Shiksha Mission, a state government project to provide elementary education. 

 When their parents refused to participate in the pulse polio programme last April, Birbhum district magistrate Khalil Ahmed promised that power lines would reach them by the end of the year. Nothing has happened.

 We sent several reminders to the authorities telling them about our ordeal but... said an elderly Mujibar Rahaman. He has two bighas of land, which he is not able to water because there is no electricity.

 Aminur Hussain said her children could not study after sundown. Kerosene, too, is not easily available. There was no point sending my children to school, she added.

 Ahmed said: Power will reach the village as soon as the state electricity board gives the clearance. It is anybodys guess when that could be.

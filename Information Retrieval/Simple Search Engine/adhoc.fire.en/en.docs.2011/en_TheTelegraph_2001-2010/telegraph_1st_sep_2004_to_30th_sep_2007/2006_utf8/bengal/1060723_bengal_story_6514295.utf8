The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Gun in pocket, Metro in a tizzy

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 22: Security personnel went into a tizzy this afternoon as a young man was caught trying to enter Sovabazar Metro station with a .32 six-chamber revolver in his pocket.

 Police said Udit Pandey a Kanpur resident, was intercepted moments after he had passed through the metal-detector door at the station.

 An alert was sounded as security personnel frisking Pandey, 25, felt the revolver. 

 At the end of a round of interrogation by the railway personnel, he was taken to the Shyampukur police station, where the grilling continued for about two hours. 

 Finally, the security establishment was convinced that Pandey was not a terrorist, not even a burglar on the run.

 A businessman dealing in leather goods, he was in the city to pay off clients and was carrying the weapon for his own protection. But the desire for a never-before Metro ride landed Pandey in trouble.

 At the police station, he furnished papers and a permission to carry it. Shyampu- kur officer-in-charge Dulal Chandra Dey said: We contacted the Kanpur police to verify whether the licence was genuine. It was. 

 The businessman, who arrived in the city on Wednes- day and will take Purbanchal Express tomorrow on the way home, bought the revolver six months ago from Kanpur Ordnance Factory. 

 Udit Pandey wanted to a ride on the Metro along with friend Soubrata Chowrasia and entered Sovabazar station around 12.10 pm. He had kept the revolver in his trouser pocket. As soon as he passed through the metal detector, our men caught him, a Metro spokesperson said.

 Licensed it might be, but the revolver sent shock-waves among commuters.

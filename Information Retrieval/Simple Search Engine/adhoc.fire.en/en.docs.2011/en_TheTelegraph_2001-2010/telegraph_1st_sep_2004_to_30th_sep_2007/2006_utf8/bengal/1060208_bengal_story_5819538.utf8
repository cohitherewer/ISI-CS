 Cop gets stick

 Calcutta, Feb. 7: A wireless sergeant of Calcutta police, D.K. Lakhra, has been suspended following a complaint of harassment against him.

 The complainant alleged that Lakhra stopped his four-wheeler on Maddon Street for crossing the stop line though he denied having done so. The sergeant then asked the man to pay a fine of Rs 1,500 for violating traffic rules.

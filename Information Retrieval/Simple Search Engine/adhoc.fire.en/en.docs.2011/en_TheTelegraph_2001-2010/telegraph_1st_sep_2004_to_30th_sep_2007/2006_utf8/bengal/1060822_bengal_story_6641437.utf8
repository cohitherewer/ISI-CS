 Basu hurt in bedside fall

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Aug. 21: Jyoti Basu, who turned 93 last month, fell while trying to switch off his bedroom ceiling fan early this morning and injured his right hip and elbow.

 After he tripped on the floor, the veteran CPM leader rung a bell to alert his attendant, who was sleeping in an adjoining room.

 The attendant and security guards lifted Basu and put him back on bed.

 Doctors from the Bidhannagar State General Hospital were called to Indira Bhavan in the morning because he continued to feel a pain. An X-ray was conducted on the hip in the afternoon.

 Hospital superintendent Somnath Bhattacharya, who conducted the X-ray, said he submitted the report to the North 24-Parganas chief medical officer of heath. 

 Basus son Chandan said: The X-ray established that baba did not suffer a fracture. However, he is still feeling pain and has been advised bed rest for a couple of days. 

 Chandan is worried because his father suffers from several old-age related ailments and stays alone.

 He had requested his father time and again to stay at his house in Salt Lake, but he did not listen. 

 The security aspect must be one of the reasons for his reluctance to come over. I cannot provide him Z-category security, Chandan said. 

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee visited Basu with CPM state secretary Biman Bose this evening. Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee and key CPM functionaries called Indira Bhavan to enquire about the leaders health. 

 Basu had earlier declined Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs request to attend tomorrows meeting with Left leaders in Delhi over dinner because of ill health. He informed the Prime Minister about his inability to attend tomorrows programme a long time back, a CPM leader said.

 He had shied away from party meetings in Delhi earlier, saying he was too old to travel. The CPM has lined up next months politburo meeting in Calcutta keeping in mind its oldest leaders failing health. 

 This time, though, he will also miss a party meeting in the city. The partys state secretariat is scheduled to meet at Alimuddin Street on Friday.

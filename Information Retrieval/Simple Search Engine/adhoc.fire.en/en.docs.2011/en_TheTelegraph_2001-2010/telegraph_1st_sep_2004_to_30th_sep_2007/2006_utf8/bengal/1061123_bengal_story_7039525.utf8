The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 RDX whiff in train blast

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Belakoba, 

 Nov. 22: The explosive used in the blast that tore 

 apart a coach of the Haldibari-New Jalpaiguri passenger 

 on Monday could be RDX or TNT, experts from the Central 

 Forensic Science Laboratory, Calcutta, have suggested. 

 A six-member team headed by its director, Chandranath Bhattacharya, came here today. They found a flattened container in which the explosive is believed to have been packed. Seven people were killed and over 50 injured in the blast.

 The explosive used was powerful, similar to an RDX or TNT explosion, said Bhattacharya. However, PTI quoted home secretary P.R. Ray as saying in Calcutta that powerful explosives and not RDX were used.

 The experts collected samples besides the container, wires and charred metal pieces over several hours from the train and the tracks. 

 They also went to the North Bengal Medical College and Hospital to examine the wounds on two victims.

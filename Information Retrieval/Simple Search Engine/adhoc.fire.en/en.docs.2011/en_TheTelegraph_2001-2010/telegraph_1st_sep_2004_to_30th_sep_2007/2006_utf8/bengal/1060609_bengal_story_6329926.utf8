The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Govt eyes empty airfields

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, June 8: The Left Front government will ask the defence ministry to hand over 15 abandoned airfields in the state so that they can be used to set up industries or build small airports. 

 The airfields are located in Malda and Cooch Behar districts in north Bengal, and in Burdwan, Nadia, East and West Midnapore and North 24-Parganas in the south.

 The state government is considering reviving some of these abandoned airstrips and turning them into small airports for private airlines as this would help growing industries transport their products and personnel and reduce their dependence on Calcutta, state home secretary Prasad Ranjan Roy said today.

 Officials in the chief ministers secretariat said defence minister Pranab Mukherjee has in principle agreed to the idea mooted by chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. 

 The chief minister has asked the home department to collect information on the airstrips so that a detailed proposal can be sent to Delhi.

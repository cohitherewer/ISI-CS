 Police ask Church to protect itself

 The Maliapota church: Needs a shield

 Krishnagar, July 19: Repeated raids on churches in Nadia have prompted police to suggest that the authorities should hire private security agencies for protection.

 The church authorities confirmed today that they have received such a proposal from the district superintendent of police. 

 There are 150 odd churches in Nadia and about 30,000 Christians. 

 Last week, a priests office was ransacked and a vault containing the communion bread was stolen from a church at Raghabpur. The vandals threw the Bible and other religious books on the floor and disconnected the local area network of 10 computers used for a computer literacy programme run by the church.

 On December 5 last year, a group of people had burnt the communion bread and pages of the Bible at Jalalkhali. The attack was in retaliation to Father Antony Kariyattils campaign against alcohol abuse by village youths. 

 Masked men armed with revolvers and other weapons raided a church at Maliapota on Christmas Eve four years ago and robbed villagers who had congregated for Midnight Mass. The churchs safe boxes were cleaned out and Father T.J. Abraham was assaulted. 

 We feel disturbed and our community feels insecure. Even today many church heads in Nadia are being threatened by anti-socials, said Josef Gomes, the bishop in charge of Nadia and Murshidabad. 

 Nadia police chief R. Rajsekharan said he had been repeatedly asked by the churches and other Christian organisations to step up security. But to bring all of them under a special security cover is difficult as we dont have enough manpower. We can at best step up patrolling, which we have after the Maliapota church was attacked, he said. 

 The step-up could not prevent the following raids. So I decided to take up the issue of private security with the bishop, Rajsekharan said.

 The attack on the church at Raghabpur occurred after the priest refused to bow to the demands of local extortionists. 

 The church trains the poor in computers free of cost, runs a self-help co-operative for village women and helps them save money. Father Jose Pulickal said local toughs had demanded a cut from the co-operative, which they were denied.

 No one has been arrested yet. The superintendent could only say that the investigation was on.

 Bishop Gomes said he would discuss the possible appointment of private guards at the next meeting of the Church Council for Nadia and Murshidabad. 

 The decision of the eight-member council will be sent to a general assembly, comprising 60 parish priests from Nadia, for ratification. 

 As the proposal is from the district police chief we have to give it a serious thought, Bishop Gomes said. 

 But deploying security personnel in a church might send a wrong signal to those who go there to pray. The bishop sounded disturbed. Installing security guards in churches means we are in trouble. Churchgoers will feel uneasy.

 Shop looted in daylight

 Calcutta, Dec. 31: A gang of six raided a sari shop in Burrabazar this afternoon and walked away with Rs 1.5 lakh, gold rings and five mobile phones. 

 Police said the youths stepped into the wholesale shop on Jamna Lal Bajaj Street posing as customers and even saw a collection of saris. 

 About 15 minutes later, four of them threatened Laxmi Narayan Toshniwal with daggers. When he refused to give them the locker keys, one of them hit him with a dagger. 

 As the quartet collected the cash, the others took away the phones and rings.

 Footbridge

 Two foot-bridges will be built at Golaghata and Sribhumi on VIP road. The 500-m stretch between the two places has seen 19 deaths in two years. The PWD minister laid the found-ation stone for the bridges to be built in three months.

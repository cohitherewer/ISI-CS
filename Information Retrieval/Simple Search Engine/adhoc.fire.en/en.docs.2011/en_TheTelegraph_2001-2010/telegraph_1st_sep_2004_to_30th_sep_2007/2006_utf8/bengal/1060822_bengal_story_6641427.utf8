The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 CDs put police back on trek trail

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 21: The criminal investigation department today reopened the investigation into last months Purulia trekking tragedy after the family of one of the victims received by post two CDs purportedly containing video clippings showing them.

 On July 28, three students of Jadavpur University were killed at the Ayodhya foothills. The CID had closed its investigation saying they were swept away by a flash flood in the Sobha.

 Two JU students survived the accident.

 The CDs reached Subhankar Sahas house at Dinhata in Cooch Behar a couple of days ago. His father has handed them over to the CID. They reached the CIDs Calcutta headquarters today. 

 An officer working on the case said the quality of one of the CDs was so poor that it could not be screened. The other showed some obscene pictures recorded in a room. They were not very clear. There was one man in the film and we are trying to find out whether he is one of the three men in the trekking team. 

 The CDs were apparently sent from Asansol post office and the sender claimed to be a well-wisher of Subhankars family. 

 The officer added that the sender also added a letter saying the CDs contained evidence of foul-play behind Subhankars death.

 Officers are examining them thoroughly, said S. Ramakrishnan, the additional director-general of the CID, who met the chief minister this morning to inform him about the twist to the closed case.

 Bhattacharjee, who had ordered the first CID probe, also ordered the second today.

 Ramakrishnan said: We will have to verify whether the pictures in the CDs are genu- ine or superimposed. We will also have to find whether the voices on the CD are dubbed.

 Confirming the reopening of the case, home secretary Prasad Ranjan Ray said: Police are yet to examine the CDs thoroughly. Let us see if they can give any clue to the tragedy.

 Five JU students Subhankar, Swati Das, Arundhati Ghosh, Bappaditya Chatterjee and Kaushik Sarkhel went to the Ayodhya Hills with a plan to spend the night of July 28 in a cave next to a waterfall. 

 The waterfall turned into a violent torrent after a heavy shower.

 Swati and Subhankar were found dead on the river bank the next day, over 3 km from the spot where they apparently fell into the water. Arundhatis decomposed body was found four days later.

 The girls bodies did not have clothes on them, while Subhankar was fully dressed.

 Ramakrishnan said the investigators will again probe the allegations of foul play. A team of officers will go to Cooch Behar to speak to Subhankars family. The sleuths might also question the survivors Bappaditya and Kaushik.

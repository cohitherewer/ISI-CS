The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Travel scam in Japan, China

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 12: Indranil Mitra, the owner of Endeavour Holiday who allegedly duped 32 people with a World Cup package in Germany, has spread his wings to Japan and China, police said.

 Sleuths probing the Cup package case found this out a fortnight ago when some travel agencies from abroad got in touch with them.

 Mitra had been organising tours over the past few years. Several travel agencies from China and Japan recently contacted us and complained that they were duped by him, said an officer of the detective department.

 In 2003-2004, Mitra had sent over 50 people to China and Japan with the collaboration of travel agencies from those countries. But he did not pay them the full amount for providing accommodation to the travellers. The agencies contacted him time and again but he never responded, the officer added. 

 Investigations have also revealed that Mitra had links with a host of travel agencies in Europe and had conducted over 100 tours since 2003. 

 The racket involves over Rs 1 crore. We have got several papers and are verifying them. Some of us are also in touch with travel agencies in Europe, deputy commissioner (detective department) Gyanwant Singh said today.

 A Zurich-based travel agency moved a petition in a Calcutta court alleging that Mitra had cheated it of Rs 26.34 lakh by producing forged bank documents. The chief metropolitan magistrate has directed Calcutta police to probe the charge.

 Former Mohun Bagan coach Amal Dutta and club secretary Anjan Mitra were part of the group of 32, each of whom had paid Mitra Rs 1.5 lakh for the World Cup package. It included tickets to the quarter-final, semi-final and final matches, besides accommodation and airfare.

 But when they landed in Berlin, they realised they had been taken for a ride, the police said.

 After being on the run for days, Mitra and his father Pannalal were arrested on June 30. They were interrogated separately and the police said their statements did not match. 

 The two are in judicial custody and the next hearing is scheduled on Monday.

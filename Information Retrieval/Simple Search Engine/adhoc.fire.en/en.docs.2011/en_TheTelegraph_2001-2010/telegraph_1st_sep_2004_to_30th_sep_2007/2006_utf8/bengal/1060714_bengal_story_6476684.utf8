 Glare on crime against women

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 13: The 

 chief minister today admitted to an increase in crime against 

 women in the state and said his government is determined 

 to curb it.

 Replying to a debate on the home (police) budget, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said: I admit that incidents of crime against women are on the rise and it is dangerous for our state. It is a new phenomenon and is also posing a major problem for the government. We are determined to curb it and we need assistance from all concerned. 

 The chief minister told the Assembly that he has approached various agencies to conduct studies. 

 I have asked the womens commission to assess whether there is any socio-economic aspect involved. I have also asked universities to conduct surveys and find ways to curb the menace. The crime cannot be curbed only with the help of police, it needs involvement of the people, Bhattacharjee said.

 The chief ministers comments came after Congress and Trinamul Congress MLAs criticised the government for failing to ensure womens safety. They pointed out that the number of rape, molestation and eve-teasing cases in the city and the districts has been rapidly increasing. 

 Bhattacharjee said the infrastructure of the police department is poor, but lack of funds has tied the governments hands.

 At least 5,000 posts of constables and several officers posts are lying vacant. We would have been happy if we could fill up all the posts, but it is not possible. I also feel that the police should be given sophisticated weapons and more vehicles. But where shall I get the money from? I cannot spend on the police department by curtailing funds from other departments. However, we are trying our best to upgrade the infrastructure, he said.

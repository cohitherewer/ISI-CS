The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Musician plays girl runner

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Aug. 6: At the Kamakshya Devi mela in Guwahati in early July, one corner attracted 14-year-old Sumita Das (name changed) more than any other. It had a young man playing film songs on a synthesiser.

 His fingers nimbly running over his Roland keyboard, Biswajit Biswas, 25, a resident of Krishnagunj in Nadia, also noticed the girl and smiled at her. The Class VIII student was floored by the gesture. 

 Police are now looking for Biswajit because he is believed to be a key member of a girl-running racket.

 Sumita was rescued last night from a house at Nalupur in Krishnagunj, 130 km from Calcutta, minutes before she was to be taken away to be sold to flesh traders in Bihar.

 Biswajit, who set up a troupe with friends in his hometown, became popular and included in it boys and girls to belt out Hindi chartbusters.

 Neither Sumita nor her mother, a widow, smelt anything foul when Biswajit promised to train her as a singer. 

 Nadia superintendent of police R. Rajsekharan said Biswajit completed the programme in Guwahati, introduced himself to Sumita and learnt that she was eager to make a career as a singer. He promised her training and assured her a career in singing and brought the girl back with him to Krishnagunj. 

 The teenager realised her blunder when she was forced to perform at a sleazy hotel in Balia, Uttar Pradesh, with two other women, Barnali Das and Shyamali Das. 

 Both of them were arrested last night. Barnalis husband is Biswajits friend Amar, also a synthesiser player and member of his group.

 An officer working on the case said: Sumita was a flop as a dancer in UP and so she was sent back to Krishnagunj in 10 days. She was tortured when she failed to perform well.

 Back in Krishnagunj, Biswajit and the two women decided to sell Sumita to racketeers in Bihar. The Nadia police chief said: Shyamali, a dance girl in Bihar, was preparing to smuggle Sumita out when the police raided the house.

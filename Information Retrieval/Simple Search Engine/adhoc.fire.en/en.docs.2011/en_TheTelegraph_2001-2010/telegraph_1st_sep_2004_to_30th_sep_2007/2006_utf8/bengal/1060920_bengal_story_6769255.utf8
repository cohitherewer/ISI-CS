 Mobile towers in rural tax net

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Sept. 19: The 

 government has decided to tax mobile service providers for 

 towers on its land in rural areas. 

 Minister of state for panchayat and rural development Bankim Ghosh said the service providers are now indiscriminately picking government land to set up towers in rural areas. We receive only an installation fee. There is no provision for an annual tax to be paid to the local bodies.

 The towers, which ensure better connectivity, help the companies expand their business and they should not mind paying for them, the minister added. 

 When we know that the towers are helping the providers get a larger number of customers, why shouldnt they pay a small amount every year to the government?

 He also stressed the need for the rural bodies to expand their tax base. 

 BSNL, which has the largest rural customer base, and the largest number of towers said there is no alternative but to pay the tax if it is imposed. We pay a handsome amount as installation fee for towers in panchayat and municipal areas. But if asked to pay an annual tax, we will have to obey, said the companys Nadia general manager, S.C. Sankhari.

 The service providers pay Rs 35,000 to the local panchayat or municipality during installation of the towers. 

 The government is cur- rently drawing up the tax structure. The panchayat department has started taking stock of towers across the state. There are about 2,500 towers in rural Bengal with the BSNL having a lions share of them, an official said. 

 Ghosh said panchayats from all districts had appealed to his department to impose the tax. The municipalities have also raised a similar demand but no decision has yet been taken on it.

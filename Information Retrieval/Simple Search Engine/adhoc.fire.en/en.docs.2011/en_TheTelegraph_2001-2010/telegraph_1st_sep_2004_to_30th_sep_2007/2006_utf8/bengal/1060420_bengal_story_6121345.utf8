The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Rhetoric of past to the balm of Buddha

 Andrew MacDowall, a British journalist, narrates his campaign experience

 It was Saturday afternoon in Contai and, at the Aurobindo stadium, the warm-up act was getting into full swing. 

 We must continue to struggle against those who oppose us?we must fight to win a seventh term. And to that end, heres another song. 

 The clanking music started up again, and the singing wailed across the parched stadium from scores of loudspeakers on poles topped with red flags. We had arrived early; increasing numbers of motorcyclists waving red flags as they streaked past us had led us to the town. 

By the time we reached Contai, the sultry streets 

were echoing to the amplified speeches of local party cadre, interspersed with 

songs. A lone Trinamul amplifier bleated a hopeless riposte. I was reminded of 

the streets of Prague, allegedly still rigged with the loudspeakers used to broadcast 

Cold War propaganda and martial music.

 Inside the ground, there was something of a holiday-camp atmosphere ? in which the holiday-makers are almost all clad in CPM bibs and caps. There didnt seem to be huge enthusiasm or energy at this point; no chanting, no waving of flags that you would see at what I suppose is the nearest British equivalent, a Left-wing demonstration.

The tempo rose as Lakshman Seth, the local MP, stepped 

up to the speaker. He roared and ranted; it sounded like the blood-spitting rhetoric 

of the European inter-war years ? the time when the continent was divided between 

fascist and communist. Indeed, the last British politician to use open-air oratory 

as a tool for mass mobilisation was the notorious leader of the British Blackshirt 

fascists, Oswald Mosely. In the UK, this sort of engagement with the public is 

now seen as a platform used only by extremists.

 One hundred and thirty years ago, our great Liberal Prime Minister Gladstone was known to give five-hour speeches to the masses at the foot of Welsh mountains and in the market squares of Scottish towns. Now, the age of television has led to the era of the glib political sound bite. As Seth reached the climax of his speech, he called for Trinamul to be pulled up from their roots and then for the Opposition to be thrown into the Bay of Bengal. 

 I asked my friends to translate, but they waved it away saying its just rhetoric. The language raised wry smiles from some of the audience. And still there was no cheering. Seth was followed by a series of speakers from the junior Left Front partners; little ripples of applause came from the crowd.

 And suddenly there was an electric buzz about the crowd ? Buddha, Buddha, its Buddha ? and people scrambled to see the chief minister take the platform. 

 There were by now 20,000 people crammed into the stadium. Above them, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee spoke calmly, the balm after Seths fire. He spoke against communalism, and for development in a tone that befits a student of Bengali literature. There were mentions of the war in Iraq. There was little about his speech one could find disagreeable. 

 Maybe the younger cadre bemoan a lack of radicalism in a world dominated, from a Marxist standpoint, by exploitation and imperialist war.

 Then, suddenly, it was over. The crowd swiftly drained away to the dhabas of Contai and to the buses. 

 The road to Calcutta passed through small towns teeming with young men wearing red bibs. Buses with dozens clinging precariously to the roofs swerved erratically across the plains. Many others marched on foot. 

 All was peaceful. After the rhetoric, these adherents of a formerly revolutionary party poured out of Contai and back to their villages without a murmur. Whether, on their return, they cast their BJP-supporting neighbours into the Bay of Bengal one can only speculate.

 BRIEFS

 Howrah, July 8: A tanker filled with liquid petroleum gas developed leaks after being hit by a container truck and overturning, triggering panic at Howrahs Uluberia this morning.

 Police said the Hindustan Petroleum tanker coming from Haldia to Calcutta was parked off National Highway 6, about 40 km from the city, when the truck rammed into it. The area was cordoned off and all eateries and hotels were emptied. A crane finally removed the tanker to a safe distance under firemens vigil. 

 Calcutta: The high court-appointed committee to monitor Ganga pollution spotted encroachment of the river and dumping of wastes on both banks during a surprise visit on Saturday. Victoria Jute mill at Bhadreswar in Hooghly has encroached nearly 300 feet into the river and cordoned off the area with concrete pillars.

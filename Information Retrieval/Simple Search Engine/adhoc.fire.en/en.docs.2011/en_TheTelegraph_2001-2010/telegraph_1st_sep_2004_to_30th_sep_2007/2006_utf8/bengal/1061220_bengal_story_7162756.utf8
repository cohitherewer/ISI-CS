 CPM and Trinamul in Bhangar rally war

 DEBASISH CHATTERJEE

 Bhangar, Dec. 19: A day after Trinamul supporters went on the rampage protesting against land acquisition here, the CPM organised a rally to highlight the Opposition partys misinformation campaign.

 A Trinamul mob led by local MLA Arabul Islam had tried to destroy the fence around an engineering college plot mistaking it for land to be handed over to the Salim Group for an expressway passing through the district and an industrial hub nearby. 

 At Ghatakpur, 2 km from the village where people armed with stones and sticks had attacked police, land minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah accused politically isolated Trinamul leaders of scuttling the states industrialisation drive by misguiding people. 

 The engineering college had purchased 20 acres from farmers and erected the fence to demarcate the area. But Trinamul leaders made it an issue saying an agent for the Salim Group had bought the land. Right-thinking people will not accept such cheap politics. 

 The land to be acquired by the Indonesian group is about a kilometre from Bairampur, the scene of yesterdays violence, Mollah added.

 Local Trinamul leaders defended the protest, saying the sudden fencing had left the villagers wondering. 

 The party has lined up another rally in the area in South 24-Parganas 25 km from Calcutta tomorrow to counter the CPMs. 

 MLA Islam, however, is said to be missing. 

 Sunderbans affairs minister Kanti Ganguly, a CPM heavyweight in the district, told the rally: Just see how Trinamul is misguiding the people. They are opposing develop-ment projects for oppositions sake.

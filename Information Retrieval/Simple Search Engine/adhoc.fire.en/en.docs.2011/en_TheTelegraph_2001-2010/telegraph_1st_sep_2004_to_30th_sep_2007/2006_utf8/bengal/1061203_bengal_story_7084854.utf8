 Biman: Police were provoked

 Calcutta, Dec. 2: The blows that police rained on Singur farmers today were matched by the barrage of criticism that followed, and the sharpest lash came from the Left Front.

 All front leaders, barring those from the CPM, came down heavily on the police atrocities. 

 A posse of policemen wielded the baton, lobbed teargas shells and used rubber bullets to disperse over 500 farmers, their wives and children, who were protesting against fencing of the land acquired for Tata Motors. 

 Todays police atrocities on poor farmers have pushed the Left on the back foot barely two days after we had reaped advantage by mobilising public opinion against the Trinamul Congresss vandalism in the Assembly, said RSPs Manoj Bhattacharya.

 In a state like Bengal where the front has vowed to protect the interests of poor farmers, indiscriminate lathicharge on them is unwelcome, he said, demanding a meeting to discuss the matter. 

 Forward Bloc secretary Ashok Ghosh, too, condemned the police excesses. At a time when all front partners have decided to peacefully settle the Singur issue, the police excesses have jeopardised our sincere efforts, he said. 

 Left Front chairman and CPM leader Biman Bose tried to defend the police, saying they were provoked by the farmers and some outsiders. It is only when the villagers started throwing stones at the police that the lathicharge began, he said.

 CPM state secretariat member Benoy Konar said: Some students of Jadavpur University, said to be Naxalites, have joined hands with the Trinamul and they are at the root of all the trouble there.

 But the front was in no mood to buy these arguments. CPI state secretary Manju Kumar Majumdar, who discussed the incident at a party secretariat meeting this evening, said the violence could have been avoided.

 The state Congress compared the Bhattacharjee regime with the Bush administration. Todays police torture on Singur farmers reminds us of the barbaric attack unleashed by the Bush administration on the Iraqis, said MLA Somen Mitra.

 The party will raise the matter in the Assembly on Monday.The party will raise the matter in the Assembly on Monday.

 Kanu Sanyal, Naxalite leader in Siliguri, demanded the chief ministers resignation. He also threatened to call a bandh on Monday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Poll babus in campaign mode

 BARUN GHOSH 

 Arambagh, April 19: If you are here and wondering which party these people are campaigning for, sorry, they are not in the fray. 

 These are election officials and policemen telling people to vote. 

 Convoys led by poll obser-vers and tailed by police jeeps with loudspeakers fitted on top are now as busy as any political party two days before the close of campaigning. 

 The officials are visiting every nook and cranny of four constituencies in Hooghlys Arambagh subdivision, about 120 km from Calcutta, and telling people to vote without fear.

 There had been over 80 per cent polling in the Arambagh subdivision ? Khanakul, Pursurah, Goghat and Arambagh constituencies ? in 2001 and the Opposition had cried foul alleging CPM manipulation. 

 Mohammad Sanaullah, the observer for Pursurah, said the decision to start the vote-without-fear campaign follows allegations of CPM terror. Villagers here are too scared to speak to us freely. They are also afraid of retaliation in our absence, Sanaullah said. 

 There was 95 per cent to 98 per cent polling in several booths, the observer added.

 Benoy Dutta of the CPM had won by over a lakh votes from Arambagh in 2001. The Forward Bloc candidate won Goghat by 96,809 votes and the CPM won Khanakul by 62,374 and Pursurah by 51,217 votes.

 In the first phase of Elections 2006, however, several constituencies recorded over 80 per cent polling and the poll panel found nothing wrong in it.

 During the 2004 Lok Sabha polls, someone in the booth had told Amal Manna of Arambagh that he could not vote because he was uneducated. Tui ashikshito he told me and cast my vote. Aami bhoye chup korey chhilam (I kept quiet out of fear), said Amal, 46, a barber. Amal said he would vote this time. 

 Sheikh Mozammel Hossain, the CPMs Arambagh zonal secretary, admitted that some people had been terrorised. Those terrorised by Trinamul Congress workers in the wake of Mamata Banerjees victory in the Panskura bypoll in 2000 started retaliating after her party failed to repeat the performance in the 2001 Assembly polls. We had no control over it, Hossain said.

 Anjan Bera, the head of Calcutta Universitys mass communication department and the new CPM candidate from Pursurah, feels the complaints about terror are false. 

 The election officials are not taking chances. They are telling people: Vote without fear. You neednt worry, there will be paramilitary at polling booths, not police. 

 Arambagh observer N. Shivasailam, Sanaullah and their colleagues in Khanakul and Goghat have prepared the script, whose Bengali translation is being read out by the police.

 Emboldened by the poll panels campaign, Panchkori Samanta, 64, a quack, is also hopeful of being able to vote this time. He is, however, not too hopeful about a change in the living conditions ? the erratic power supply, defective tubewells and bad roads. 

 We have to walk 8 km to reach the nearest primary health centre which is in a shambles. The Arambagh subdivisional hospital is about 15 km away. The roads make the distance longer, said Gopal Maity of Mahisgarh in Khanakul.

 But the poll panel seems more organised in campaigning than the Opposition candidates, much more visible, too. The Left Front knows that.

 Iron worship in hills

 Darjeeling, Sept. 23: Subhas Ghisinghs men have found a new god.

 The last year saw Visvakarma idols making way for the shila (stone). And now, the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Transport Joint Action Committee, an affiliate of the Ghisingh-headed GNLF, has decided to replace the shila with iron. 

 Chanting the work-is-worship mantra, members of the committee an umbrella body of 148 taxi syndicates across the hills today paid obeisance to motor engines, steering wheels and tools in a flower-bedecked pandal. 

 Ghisingh preferred not to comment on religious issues, but his stamp on the committees decision was evident. The GNLF chief has led a struggle to get tribal status for the Gorkha community, and the loha (iron) puja is the committees way of returning to its tribal traditions. 

 This is our tradition, but over the years we had forgotten about it. By celebrating loha (iron) puja, the transport body is trying to help a cause and prove the tribal character of the hill people, said Pranay Rai, a Darjeeling MLA and secretary of the committee. 

 The puja, also known as falam puja, did not have priests. The rituals were performed by jhakris (shamans) instead. 

 Earlier, people used to worship metal tools and this is exactly what we have done today. We brought out a rally in town and worshipped all metal objects, Rai added. 

 The rest of Darjeeling, however, celebrated Visvakarma puja last Sunday, which some believe is a silent but sure indication of the peoples disapproval of political prying on religious sentiments.

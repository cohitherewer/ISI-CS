The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Takeover clock ticking

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Singur (Hooghly), July 30: Farmers whose land has been identified for acquisition at Singur will get 30 days from tomorrow to register their objections, if any.

 A makeshift information centre will be opened at the block land revenue office here, 40 km from Calcutta, which will provide details about the specific plot earmarked for the Tatas small-car plant. 

 The Hooghly administration has issued notices for the takeover of 1,013 acres across five mouzas ? Beraberi, Khaserberi, Singherberi, Bajemelia and Gopalnagar. 

 If the farmers dont turn up within a month, we shall send notices to their homes a fortnight later for the acquisition of land against the compensation announced by the government, additional district magistrate Liyakat Ali said. 

 In case the farmers approach the administration now, they can ask for a better price for the land than what the government has offered.

 After the August 31 deadline expires, we shall keep another 15 days for hearing the complaints, Ali added.

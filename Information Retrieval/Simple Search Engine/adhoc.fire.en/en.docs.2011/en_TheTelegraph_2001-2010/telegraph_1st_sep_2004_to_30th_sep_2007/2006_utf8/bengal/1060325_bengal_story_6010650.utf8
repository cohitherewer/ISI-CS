 School head amp; girl in fake net

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, 

 March 24: A headmaster was held in South 24-Parganas 

 Kulpi today for issuing a fake certificate to a 16-year-old 

 former student so that her name could bet included in the 

 electoral rolls.

 Rama Neogi, a student of Class XI, has also been arrested. 

 She apparently approached Subir Das, the headmaster of Raitala Junior High School, where she studied up to Class VIII, for the fake age-proof because she wanted to vote this year itself. 

 According to the certificate issued to Rama, her date of birth is March 4, 1986. It should have been March 4, 1990.

 Acting on a political partys complaint, Kulpi block development officer Sanjay Mukherjee asked the headmaster to meet him with all relevant documents on March 5. As Das turned up without the papers, the BDO asked him to reappear 10 days later. 

 The headmaster again failed to produce any document and Mukherjee lodged an FIR.

 He was picked up from his house, about 70 km from Calcutta, this morning. 

 Rama, who was first summoned to the local police station for questioning, was arrested later.

 The filing of nominations for the first phase of polls on April 17 began today and will continue till March 31. 

 The scrutiny of nominations will be held on April 1 and they can be withdrawn till April 3. 

 Twenty-one constituencies of West Midnapore, 13 of Bankura and 11 of Purulia would go to the polls that day.

 Deputy election commissioner R. Balakrishnan is coming to Calcutta tomorrow to discuss the deployment of central forces with the government. 

 Chief electoral officer Debasish Sen, however, will not be in town tomorrow. He left for Delhi today for a meeting with chief election commissioner B.B. Tandon.

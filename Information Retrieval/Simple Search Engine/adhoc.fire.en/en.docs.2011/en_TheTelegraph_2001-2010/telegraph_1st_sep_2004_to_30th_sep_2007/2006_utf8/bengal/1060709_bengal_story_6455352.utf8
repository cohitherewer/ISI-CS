The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Killer in net after four years

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 8: A murder suspects portrait drawn four years ago helped police pick up the man today.

 Bibhas Mandal, in his late 30s, was rounded up from Belgharia station, on the northern fringes of the city.

 He was accused of killing Shakuntala Kundu, a New Alipore housewife who was found dead in her apartment on June 25, 2002. 

 Detective department officers had concluded that Mandal, a mason who was engaged for some construction work in the building, murdered the woman and fled with cash and jewellery from the flat.

 But raids on Mandals ancestral house at Hingalgunge in North 24-Parganas and other possible hideouts drew a blank. His portrait was sent to all police stations in and around the city but that, too, did not produce results.

 Senior officers recently reopened some of the unsolved murder cases and a team was again sent to Hingalgunge with the portrait. 

 It worked. Mandal had joined a catering agency at Belgharia, said Gyanwant Singh, the detective department deputy commissioner. 

 Mandals sketch was sent to all catering agencies in and around Belgharia and a trap was laid for him today.

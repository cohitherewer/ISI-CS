The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Congress rejects Mamata

 - Leaders say they cannot go against national policy

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, March 15: The Congress today poured cold water on Mamata Banerjees last-ditch bid to forge an electoral understanding saying she had to snap her ties with the BJP first. 

 On Tuesday, Mamata had announced the names of only 201 candidates out of a possible 294 leaving room for a seat-sharing deal with the Congress. 

 She was even prepared to concede a higher number of seats to the party than what she had offered the AICC general secretary in charge of Bengal, Margaret Alva, to unite the non-Left parties in the run-up to the Assembly elections. 

 We are not bothered about how many seats Mamata has offered to us. The main question is whether she is leaving (the) NDA or not. The Congress cannot forge any electoral alliance with a party that has BJP links, state Congress president Pranab Mukherjee said.

 We have begun selecting party nominees for all 294 seats, though some of them may go to our allies, Mukherjee told reporters.

 He had twice met the Trinamul Congress chief and requested her to sever relations with the BJP, which leads the NDA. How could we tie up with Mamata who has BJP links? he asked today. 

 Mamata refused to comment. Trinamul sources said she met some of her associates at her Kalighat home to discuss the course of action. 

 I have done my bit. But the Congress is not serious about ousting the CPM from Writers. Let us tell this to people in our campaign, she is learnt to have said.

 Observers said a three-cornered fight would help the CPM reap the maximum benefit in the ballot battle. In the 2004 parliamentary polls, the Left Front wrested a good number of Trinamul and Congress seats because of the division in anti-Left votes and the same will happen this time, an analyst said. 

 Besides Mukherjee, also the defence minister, Union information and broadcasting minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, Malda MP A.B.A. Ghani Khan Chowdhury and the Congresss state working president Pradip Bhattacharya were among those who attended its election committee meeting to select party nominees for the polls.

 The meeting at the Bengal Congress headquarters continued late into the night. 

 Former state party chief Somen Mitra, who had said on Tuesday ? after Mamata courted the Congress ? that something had to be worked out, was present at the meeting as were district leaders.

 Das Munshi, too, had earlier spoken in favour of an understanding with Mamata to keep the Left at bay. He told associates in his south Calcutta house today that the BJP was standing in the way.

 At the meeting, he backed Mukherjee to drive home the point that a tie-up was only possible minus the BJP. 

 Ghani Khan, who till the other day advocated a deal with Trinamul as the need of the hour, toed the party line, too. We cannot sacrifice our national stand for the sake of an understanding with Mamata, he said.

 Mukherjee, who had all along opposed a truck with Mamata the BJP ally, today said: I have repeated a lakh times that she should first snap ties with the NDA. 

 Congress sources said a delegation will go to Delhi on Friday to get the names of candidates ratified by the high command. The AICC will discuss the names at a screening committee meeting on March 20 and the central election committee will unveil the final list the next day.

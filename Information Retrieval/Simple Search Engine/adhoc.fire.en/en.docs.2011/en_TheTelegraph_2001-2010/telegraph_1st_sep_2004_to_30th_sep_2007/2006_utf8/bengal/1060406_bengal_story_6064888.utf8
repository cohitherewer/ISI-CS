The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Village plays moral police

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, April 5: A band of elderly women beat up a young housewife, shaved off part her head and paraded her yesterday for allegedly deserting her husband, who, however, had no such complaint. 

 Archana Mirdha, the mother of two sons aged 7 and 10, lodged a police complaint last night against her neighbours at Singnara village in Nadias Chakdah, 60 km from Calcutta.

 A youth, Manotosh Biswas, promised her a job at Mayapur and took her there a week ago. Archana told the police that he sexually abused her in a hotel there and her husband, Ramani Mirdha, rescued her three days ago. 

 During her confinement, Archana, 30, had managed to make a phone call to a villager. She had pleaded with him to inform her husband. 

 Ramani said: He told me where to find my wife. 

 But when the small farmer brought Archana back to Singnara, the residents blamed her for polluting the village atmosphere and beat her up.

 After a shalishi (conciliation) meeting, the villagers held Archana guilty of fleeing home with the married man and fixed her sentence as her husband looked on helplessly. 

 Manotosh runs a tea-stall in the village.

 I could not do anything when they abused and tortured my wife. They would have driven all of us out of the village, Ramani said today.

 About 50 women in their fifties dragged Archana to the village square and started shaving off her hair. Then they paraded her.

 What else could we do but cry at the humiliation, said Ramani, who held his two sons close to him at the time of his wifes public disgrace. 

 Manotosh has been arrested. He was named in the FIR lodged by the Mirdhas last night along with a dozen villagers. District superintendent of police R. Rajsekharan said: We will also arrest them. They are absconding.

 Archana said as the women tortured her the men looked on. There was no one to help me. Some of the villagers beat me and kicked me. They laughed at me and hurled abuses.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Tollys loss, Congs gain: SKGs turn to be SRK

 INDRANIL GHOSH AMP; SOUMI BHATTACHARYA 

 Suri, April 30: When Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said early this month that he has had to embrace capitalism, a Congressman raised a toast some 230 km from Calcutta. 

 I like him, we need people like him to build a new Bengal. We actually need hundreds of capitalists? if only his party allowed him a free hand, says Swapan Kanti Ghosh, the Congress candidate trying to wrest Suri from the CPM, which had won the 1998 bypoll and then the 2001 election. 

 He is 42 and the richest man in the fray in Election 2006. He presides over a business empire involved in such diverse fields as mining, agriculture, real estate and entertainment. 

 The affidavit filed with the Election Commission in support of his candidature, which details the wealth at the disposal of his wife, two children and himself, however, does not tell the SKG story. 

 Ghosh is SKG in the Congress circles of Suri. He had once wanted to be someone like SRK, though. 

 In 1993, SKG starred in Kalanko (Scandal) opposite Shatabdi Roy, but it sank without a trace and Ghosh came back to what he did best, business, and began dabbling in politics. 

 A star he could not be but the desire to be counted among the culturewallahs refused to die. So he set up a troupe of folk artistes called Achin Pakhi (Stranger Bird), which performs across the state. 

 Suri, a 250-year-old town, is a blend of urban and rural areas. Once a prosperous trading centre, it had long nursed a bias against the Left. 

 Until 1998, the Congresss influence was best symbolised by Suniti Chattoraj, a son of the soil. 

 He has lost much of his clout having shifted base to Salt Lake and switched loyalties to Mamata Banerjees Trinamul Congress. A string of scam charges have not helped. 

 Chattoraj is in the fray this year, too, and vows to wipe out the 1,452-vote margin by which he had lost to the CPMs Braja Mukherjee in 2001. Mukherjee had got 60,860 votes, 46 per cent of the total. 

 In the multi-cornered contest, the CPMs Tapan Roy, a former MLA and library minister, is a surprise entry. 

 Better known in these parts for his familys contribution to the communist movement ? his uncle, the late Saradish Roy, was a four-time MP from Bolpur ? the soft-spoken Tapan had been the MLA between 1987 and 1996. He had to make way for Mukherjee because he had failed to address the peoples needs. Now Mukherjee has been replaced by Roy for precisely the same reason. 

 The Congress supporters are looking to Ghoshs flair and ability to put together and lead a team. 

 An observer said that like the late Ghani Khan Chowdhury of Malda, Ghosh has been able to bring together the Congress factions. Defence minister and state party president Pranab Mukherjees blessings are a bonus. 

 Like Chattoraj, Ghosh is an outsider now. His address, too, is Salt Lake, but unlike Chattoraj, he has kept the relationship with Suri going. He has engaged a large local workforce in his stone-crushing operations and enjoys the halo of a provider a la Ghani Khan. 

 His other advantage is proximity to the CPM, where he is believed to have several friends. When Mukherjee was MLA, Ghosh is rumoured to have been close to him. It is not for nothing that not a single day is lost in his units because of labour trouble, a Trinamul functionary said.

 The CPM is pretty sure the chief ministers personal charisma and the partys efforts to acquire a new look will reflect in the result. 

 We have changed our candidates in as many as seven seats, including Suri, said Dilip Ganguly, its Birbhum secretary. This will have the desired impact. 

 But the CPM in the district is dogged by a trouble more familiar to the Congress. Bolpur MP and Speaker Somnath Chatterjee and a section of the local leadership are at loggerheads. 

 The results for the 12 Birbhum seats will depend on how far the party is able to control the feuding and how the anti-Left votes are split between Ghosh and Chattoraj.

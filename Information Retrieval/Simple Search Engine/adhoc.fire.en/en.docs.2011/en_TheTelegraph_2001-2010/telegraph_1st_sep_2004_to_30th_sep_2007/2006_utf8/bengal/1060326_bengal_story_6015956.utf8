The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 EC spotlight on security

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, March 25: Deputy election commissioner R. Balakrishnan today held discussions on security arrangements for poll-bound Bengal.

 During the visit of chief election commissioner B.B. Tandon earlier this week, it was decided that Balakr- ishnan would examine security preparations and hold discussions on the deployment of central paramilitary forces.

 Balakrishnan discussed the movement of paramilitary forces and poll personnel and the number of paramilitary forces required for each phase of elections.

 It was decided that special attention would be given to the violence-hit districts of Purulia, Bankura and West Midnapore.

 Though the exact number of central forces to be deployed is yet to be decided, there was a consensus that adequate personnel would be provided.

 That would not be a problem. There will be adequate Central paramilitary forces for every phase to ensure free and fair polls, chief electoral officer Debashis Sen said after the meeting.

 Election officers and police authorities of 19 districts will hold meetings on March 27 to set up joint teams for proper coordination during the polls.

 Inspector-general (law and order) Raj Kanojia, deputy commissioner (headquarters) Anuj Sharma and special inspector-general (vigilance) Surajit Kar Purakaystha attended todays meeting.

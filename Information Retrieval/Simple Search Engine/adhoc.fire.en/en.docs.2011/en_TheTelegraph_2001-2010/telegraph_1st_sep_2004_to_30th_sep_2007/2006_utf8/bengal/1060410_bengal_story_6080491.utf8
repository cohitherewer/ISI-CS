The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Deal signed, Dunlop set for fresh start

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, April 9: Days before the first phase of polls in the state, the final agreement for the reopening Dunlops Sahagunj unit was signed today between the new owner, Pawan Ruia, and the unions. 

 The long-term wage pact with a built-in productivity clause was forged a day be- fore Dunlops other factory at Ambattur in Tamil Nadu goes on stream. 

 Ruia and representatives of the two unions, Dipankar Roy of Citu and Ranjit Guha Niyogi of Intuc, said they were happy, though not all in as many words. 

 I am happy that the final agreement has been signed paving way for restarting the Sahagunj factory, Ruia said. 

 Guha Niyogi said he was not unhappy. 

 Having signed the dotted line at Ruias south Calcutta office, Roy expressed hope that the new owner would invest more in the factory and create more jobs. 

 Although no state government representative was present today, the development will come as a big relief for the ruling Left Front, whose main campaign planks have been development and industrialisation. 

 The terms of the pact broadly followed the memorandum of understanding signed by the new management and workers at Writers Buildings on January 24 at the behest of industries minister Nirupam Sen. 

 Production at Sahagunj in Hooghly, about 60 km from Calcutta, is expected to begin in September. 

 Work to ensure a fresh start by that date will begin in two weeks. 

 According to broad terms of the deal (see box), 1,200 of the existing 2,700-strong workforce will be retained. The rest will offered early retirement schemes (ERS). 

 Ruia said about 400-500 more people will be deployed on contract and the workers offered ERS would be given preference. 

 The ERS amount ? to be calculated on the basis of years left in service ? has been capped at Rs 120,000 and will be fully paid within six months of the start of production. The gratuity money will also be paid within that period. 

 The management has agreed to pay Rs 5,000 as back wages on April 30. Those opting for ERS will be paid the rest of the amount within six months of the start of production and the rest ? in two equal instalments ? within a year. 

 While Ruia has agreed to shell out about Rs 43-45 crore as workers dues, he has also forced them to raise daily production from 90 tonnes a day to 120 tonnes. 

 Moreover, the salary will be pegged at August 2001 figures, when Dunlop closed down. Ruia, however, has agreed to give an annual increment of Rs 100 for the next three years. 

 According to the managements estimate, about Rs 450 crore has to be pumped in to restart the operations.

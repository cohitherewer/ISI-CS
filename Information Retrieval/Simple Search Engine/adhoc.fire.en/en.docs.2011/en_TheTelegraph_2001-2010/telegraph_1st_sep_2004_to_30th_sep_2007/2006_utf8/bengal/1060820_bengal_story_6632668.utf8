Calcutta, Aug. 19: A three-year-old boy drowned 

in an uncovered drain overflowing after days of incessant rain at Dum Dum this 

morning.

 Ashish Yadavs parents hadnt noticed when he slipped out of their single-storey house at Gorabazar. 

 After his mother Gita realised that he was missing, she enquired at neighbours houses and at the corner candy stall that little Ashish found so tempting. He wasnt there. 

 About an hour and a half later, his body was found about 30 feet from the place where he slipped into the drain.

 Police said Ashish slipped into it during a spell of heavy shower. 

 He was playing with his elder brother Umesh outside the house. It seems the water spilled over the drain and the boy had no idea that he was stepping into the pit, said Praveen Kumar, the North 24-Parganas superintendent of police.

 Shankar Yadav, who runs an eatery adjoining his house, said it was around 11 when Gita first saw that Ashish was not at home or in its vicinity. 

 I was busy with my business. Gita first searched our neighbours houses and then the stall and found Ashish nowhere. She then raised an alarm and called me.

 Local youths, some of whom had taken shelter in Shankars hotel during the rain, initiated the search. 

 We never thought that he could have fallen into the drain. We were sure that he had got stuck in some corner of the locality because of the heavy downpour, said Hira Pandit, an employee of the eatery. 

 We went to all nearby houses and stationery shops where he used to buy chocolates. But our efforts proved futile.

 When the search team was walking back towards the Yadavs house, one of them saw a small umbrella floating in the drain. 

 We asked Gita to identify it and she said she saw Ashish play with it about an hour back. We smelt something wrong and started searching the drain, said one of the youths.

 After half-an-hours search, two little legs were seen sticking out of the water under a culvert. The body pulled out was Ashishs. 

 As the news reached the Yadavs house, Gita fell unconscious. 

 The little umbrella was one of Ashishs favourite playthings. During rain, he used to unfold it and plead with his mother to let him go outside. But we never allowed him, said Shankar, tears rolling down his face. 

 Today, no one saw him when he left home.

 The chairman of Dum Dum municipality, Dipak Bhattacharya, went to see the bereaved parents and admitted that such large drains should always be covered. 

 We will cover them up soon, he promised.

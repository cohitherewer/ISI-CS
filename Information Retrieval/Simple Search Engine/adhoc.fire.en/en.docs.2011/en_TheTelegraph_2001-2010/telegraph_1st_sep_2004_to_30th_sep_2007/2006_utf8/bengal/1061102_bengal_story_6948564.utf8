The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Paddy papers with police

 IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI

Calcutta, Nov. 1: Investigating the multi-crore 

paddy procurement scam, sleuths have seized papers from the state Consumers 

Co-operative Federation (Confed) office that show misappropriation of Rs 43 crore 

sanctioned for the procurement of paddy from farmers, the enforcement branch additional 

director-general told The Telegraph today.

 Preliminary investigations have revealed that the food and supplies department had given an advance of Rs 43 crore to Confed for paddy procurement this year. As there is discrepancy in the documents, we have asked the Confed managing director to furnish all documents to ascertain how much money was actually spent on the procurement, Bhupinder Singh said today.

 He said Confed officials have been asked to show the actual stock of paddy that was procured. Once we get the documents, our officers will go to the godowns and verify the stocks. So far, we have not received any response in this regard from Confed, Singh added.

 He said the misappropriation of paddy has led to a rice crisis in the public distribution system. 

 Confed chairman Haripada Biswas, a Forward Bloc MLA, was asked to resign last week in the wake of the scam.

 The food and supplies minister asked Biswas to put in his papers. Tarapada Chakraborty, also a Bloc MLA, succeeded Biswas, a senior co-operation department official said.

 Dilip Chakraborty, the co-operation secretary, said the department had taken steps to prevent such misappropriation in the future. 

 We have decided to send our officials to the villages from next year to keep vigil on the paddy procurement. The officers will meet farmers personally and keep a record of the total procurement, Chakraborty said. 

 Food and supplies minis- ter Paresh Adhikary said complaints are pouring in from the districts. Farmers are complaining that they did not receive the minimum support price for their paddy. We are also getting reports of shortage of rice in ration shops. We are conducting a probe and nobody will be spared, Adhikary said.

 The enforcement branch unearthed the scam during raids on Food Corporation of India and Confed silos in August. Confed officials, in connivance with rice mill owners, allegedly denied farmers a fair price for their produce. 

 Godown stocks were padded up, better quality rice was sold at a premium and mill owners were illegally allowed to purchase paddy directly from farmers.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Govt axe on college part-timer salary

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Feb. 22: A survey has revealed that a large section of teachers in state-aided undergraduate colleges do not attend classes regularly and the institutions try to make up for that by recruiting part-time lecturers.

 Stung by the results thrown up by the ongoing study, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees government has taken a tough stand on the release of funds for enhanced salaries of part-time teachers. 

 Authorities of each of the 340-odd undergraduate colleges in Bengal have been asked to take immediate steps to ensure that every full-time teacher takes the stipulated number of classes and remains present for about seven hours on every working day. 

 The government began the survey last October after it decided to enhance the monthly remuneration of part-time teachers from Rs 2,000 to Rs 4,000 a month. 

 With the burden on the exchequer increasing, the state government thought it wise to take a count of the part-time college teachers before opening the purse strings. 

 We were surprised to find that the part-timers were taking most of the load while many permanent teachers were simply not attending classes, a senior education department official said. 

 The college heads will have to ensure that their full-timers attend classes. If it is found that a college has an adequate number of permanent teachers but is still recruiting part-timers, it will have to bear the additional expenditure, he added.

 The authorities of almost 60 per cent of the colleges are now in a spot as they can neither discontinue the part-timers services nor ask them to continue because of the governments threat to withdraw its assistance. 

 Gyanakur Goswami, the principal of Shyamaprasad College and the council president, confirmed the surveys findings. He added that part-timers were often the better performers. Many of them are teaching for years. So, it will be difficult to terminate their services even if they are found to be in excess. It is also a fact that part-time teachers in most colleges are better performers. It would be unfair to dismiss them.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Purulia quiz

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Aug. 3: The Criminal Investigation Department today interrogated Bappaditya Chatterjee, one of the two Jadavpur University students who survived Fridays mishap in a Purulia mountain stream.

 The other survivor, Kaushik Sarkhel, could not be quizzed as he fell ill and was admitted to hospital.

 Swati Das, Arundhati Ghosh and Subhankar Saha all JU students died after being swept away in a flash flood in the Sobha at the foothills of Ayodhya Hills, where the five had gone trekking.

 CID officials said Bappaditya (in picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya) appeared rattled when told the bodies of Swati and Arundhati did not have any clothes on. Swati, he said, wore blue tracksuit bottoms and a round-neck T-shirt when he last saw her.

 Techies get IIT in tycoon tryst 

 NARESH JANA

 Kharagpur, Feb. 19: Young engineers eager to become entrepreneurs will get a partner in IIT Kharagpur even if they have not graduated from the premier institute.

 For the first time, the IIT authorities have decided to invite projects from all graduates of recognised enginee-ring colleges and help the best set up production units of their own. 

 We will provide technology and laboratory support along with advice from professors and researchers to meritorious students who want to build a bright future, director Sisir Kumar Dube said.

 The young entrepreneur would be given Rs 10 lakh to start work once selected. 

 We will also provide him a 250-sq ft office-cum-research space and the infrastructure to work on the project and develop the product. Moreover, the IIT will allow the use of its name while marketing the product, said Dhrubesh Biswas, the IITs chief technical officer.

 The institute has already set up Technology Incubator and Entrepreneurship Training Society (TIES) comprising professors, researchers and corporate personalities to examine the projects and explain the scope of marketability of the products they want to manufacture. 

 Biswas added that only those projects that are unique would be selected.

 The IIT, however, will claim 3 per cent to 5 per cent of the equity depending on the extent of help extended. 

 Biswas said since TIES was set up last September, six projects have been selected. 

 They include developing software for digital medical instruments, hardware and software for online rail ticket reservation systems and software for approving building plans.

 Meritorious students often do not get the job they deserve after they graduate. Even if they want to start something on their own, they find it difficult to obtain loans and raise the funds required to get the projects rolling. So, the IIT has come forward, Biswas said, adding we want the real brains to remain in the country.

 IIT officials said TIES would take about a month to go through a project and decide on it. We can also suggest changes here and there on some proposals. Work on a project can begin as soon as it is selected, an official said.

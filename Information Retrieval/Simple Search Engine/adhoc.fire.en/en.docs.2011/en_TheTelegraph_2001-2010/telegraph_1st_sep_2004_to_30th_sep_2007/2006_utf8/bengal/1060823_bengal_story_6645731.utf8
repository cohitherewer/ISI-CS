 CD clean chit to JU five

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 22: The two compact discs mailed by unknown persons to Subhankar Sahas house in Dinhata has no connection with last months Purulia trekking tragedy that claimed three Jadavpur University students, CID officers said today. 

 The video clippings were like those of any pornographic film and the youths shown were not the JU students who had gone to the Ayodhya Hills, said Sanjay Singh, a CID special superintendent. 

 One of the CDs was blank. In the other, there was a 45-minute film showing a young couple in a room. Their faces didnt match the students.

 On July 29, Subhankar, Swati Das and Arundhati Ghosh were swept away by a flash flood in a mountain stream next to which the five had decided to spend the night. Bappaditya Chatterjee and Kaushik Sarkhel survived. 

 After a weeklong investi-gation carried out on the chief ministers instruction, the CID submitted a report to the government saying that it was an accident and there was no foul play.

 But the closed case had to be reopened after the two CDs and a letter reached Subhankars house in Cooch Behar. 

 The letter said the couple in the CD might provide a lead in solving the mystery behind Subhankars death. The sender also identified the couple as Swati and Kaushik, an officer working on the case said.

 Singh said the claim was baseless. We have examined the CD along with experts and found it to be false, he said. 

 The CID is now trying to find out who sent the CDs. It is still not clear why someone played such a dirty trick on Subhankars family, Singh said.

 Sleuths will also try to ascertain whether the characters in the CD resemble other JU students.

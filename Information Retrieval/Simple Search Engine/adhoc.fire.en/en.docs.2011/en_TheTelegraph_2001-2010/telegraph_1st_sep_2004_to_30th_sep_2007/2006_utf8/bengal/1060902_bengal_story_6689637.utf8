The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Buddha bats for IT duo

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 1: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today dispelled fears that IT giants Wipro and Infosys could abandon their Bengal plans midway because of prohibitive land prices near Calcutta.

 You neednt worry. Im in touch with both Wipro and Infosys. They will not leave Bengal, the chief minister told reporters. 

 Infosys, Bhattacharjee said, will be given land near the airport, which would be cheaper than Rajarhat, where the rate is over Rs 2 crore an acre.

 His office, which said Wipro, too, would be shown plots in the vicinity, did not, however, say what the offer price is going to be this time. 

 Earlier, when Wipro had refused to pay Rs 2 crore an acre in Rajarhat, the chief minister intervened and the company was offered Rs 1.5 crore an acre. But it turned down that offer, too, an official said.

 Both Wipro and Infosys have sought land at less than half the rate the government has asked citing competitive prices in the range of Rs 40 lakh-50 lakh an acre being offered by other states.

 Infosys, which wants to enter Bengal, wants around 100 acres, and Wipro, which wants to expand its operations in the city, has sought 50 acres.

 The chief ministers assurance regarding their land came at HSBCs second electronic data processing unit at Nonadanga, now christened Sunrise City. The company signed an agreement with the IT department for a Rs 50-crore facility that will employ around 2,000 people. The government has given 3.5 acres to HSBC at Rs 1.5 crore an acre. 

 The company picked Calcutta because of its talent pool and low attrition rate, IT minister Debesh Das said.

 HSBC had earlier dithered over opening its second unit in the city owing to its high property tax. The government slashed property tax for IT companies by half in response. 

 Besides running its data-processing and backroom operations, the bank would also train newcomers here. By our training initiative, wed like to set standards for people entering the BPO industry, said Richard Farand, its chief operating officer.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, Dec. 19: A group of lawyers moved court against the high court chief justice today challenging the legality of a newspaper advertisement inviting applications for vacant district judges posts.

 The ad said advocates having over seven years experience and in the 35-45 age group can sit for an exam to fill up 51 vacant posts. The lawyers said that so many judges should not be appointed at one go because younger lawyers then would not get a chance to apply when they finally have the experience and are within the age limit.

 Asansol: A miner died after he slipped into the lift shaft at Musulia colliery in Asansol on Tuesday. Robilochon Chakraborty, 40, met with the accident allegedly because the lifts door was not properly locked.

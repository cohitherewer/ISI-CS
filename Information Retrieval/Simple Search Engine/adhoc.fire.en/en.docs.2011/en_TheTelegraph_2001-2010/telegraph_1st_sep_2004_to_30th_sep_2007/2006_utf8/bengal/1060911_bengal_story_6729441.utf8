 Professor abuse row in Santiniketan

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Santiniketan, Sept. 10: An Austrian professor teaching at Visva-Bharatis Institute for Buddhist and Tibetan Studies lodged a police complaint this evening against two of her colleagues for physical and verbal abuse.

 The police have sent her for a medical examination at Bolpur Hospital.

 Andrea Loseris, 45, who joined the Santiniketan institute in July this year, said she was insulted in her office in front of some of our staff members and students.

 They hurled abuses, called me a thief, foreigner and a slut and what not. I just wanted to put a notice on the board displaying a class schedule for lecturers, said Loseris, who has also complained to the Visva-Bharati authorities.

 The professor has named her colleagues Nam Kyal and Prakriti Chakraborty. We will speak to them, said Nitya Gopal Choudhury, the inspector-in-charge of Bolpur police station.

 Loseris said she would inform the Austrian embassy in Delhi. I have left my country and come to such a far-away university because I wanted to be associated with Gurudev Rabindranath Tagores abode of peace. But I dont understand why I am facing resistance and non-cooperation from a section of my colleagues. Today, it crossed all limits, she said.

 The public relations officer of Visva-Bharati, Amitabha Choudhury, said registrar Sunil Kumar Sarkar had received a complaint from the professor and a departmental inquiry would be initiated.

 Chakraborty, one of the accused, said she, too, would lodge a complaint with the police. Loseris used filthy language and even came to beat me with a stick, she alleged.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 VP moral support

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, Sept. 30: Jan 

 Morcha convener V.P. Singh has offered to visit Singur to 

 extend moral support to Mamata Banerjees protest against 

 land acquisition for Tata Motors.

 The issue of SEZ (special economic zone) cuts across political lines. If Mamata Banerjee invites me to visit Singur, I will surely accept it and squat there, the former Prime Minister said today.

 First, I will talk to Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee since he happens to be part of the UPA. I will try to convince him about the need to spare farmers the trauma of being ousted from their own lands. If he is not convinced, I will surely visit Singur, he added.

 The Trinamul welcomed Singhs offer. This proves that our movement has support from people outside Bengal, party general secretary Mukul Roy said in Calcutta.

 Singh and Jan Morcha colleague Raj Babbar have been agitating against the Mulayam Singh Yadav governments decision to hand over prime agricultural land at Dadri near Ghaziabad in Uttar Pradesh for a Reliance gas plant.

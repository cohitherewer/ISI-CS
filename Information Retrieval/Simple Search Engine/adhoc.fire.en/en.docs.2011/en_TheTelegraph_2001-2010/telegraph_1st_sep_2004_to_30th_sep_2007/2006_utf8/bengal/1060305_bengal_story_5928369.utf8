 CU mulls college shift for pass tests

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, March 4: Calcutta University is planning to empower its affiliated colleges to conduct the examinations of its three-year general degree (pass) courses.

 According to a proposal, there is, however, no plan to change the system concerning the BA, BSc and BCom (honours) examinations. 

 Under the existing system, the university conducts the examinations of both undergraduate courses ? honours and pass.

 The move, being initiated to reduce the universitys exam-related workload, can now add to the responsibility of 120-odd colleges affiliated to the university. Under the proposed system, students will write the pass course examinations sitting in their own institutions. Their college teachers will examine their answer scripts.

 It is yet to be decided on whom the onus of conducting the remaining examination procedures ? setting question papers, publishing the results, and awarding degrees ? will rest. 

 A section of academics and members of the universitys syndicate, its highest decision-making body, had proposed the split in examination responsibilities. 

 Officials said the university was planning to lessen its pressure primarily with the aim of ensuring more emphasis on the qualitative improvement of postgraduate studies and research work.

 The bulk of the universitys activities now involve imparting undergraduate courses and particularly, holding the BA, BSc and BCom examinations, said Suranjan Das, its pro-vice-chancellor, academic affairs. Unless we are able to reduce this load of exam-related work, we will not be able to compete with other reputable higher education institutions.

 The proposal, however, is still in the preliminary stage and, Das said, it has to be examined at all levels before a final decision is taken.

 A university official said with the number of successful higher secondary and other Plus-II candidates going up every year, the number of seats in undergraduate courses is also being raised by the colleges continuously. As a result, most of the universitys activities are now focused on managing the undergraduate examinations.

 About 300,000 students appear in various undergraduate examinations of the university every year. The number of answer scripts that have to be evaluated is a few times more. 

 Syndicate members who have made the proposal said according to the universitys rule, pass graduates are not allowed to seek admission to postgraduate courses of the university as regular students. In such a system, there is no reason why so much time should be spent on students who cannot be accommodated into the main activities of the university ? postgraduate studies and research.

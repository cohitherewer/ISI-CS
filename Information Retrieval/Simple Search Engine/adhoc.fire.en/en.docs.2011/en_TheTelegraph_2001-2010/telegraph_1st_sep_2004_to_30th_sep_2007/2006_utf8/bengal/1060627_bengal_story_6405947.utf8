The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Speaker sermon for House debutants

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, June 26: Bengal Assembly Speaker Hashim Abdul Halim today told first-time MLAs that they should not create trouble in the House as that would have an adverse effect on the electorate they represent and lead to their defeat.

 Addressing a workshop attended by about 90 debutants in the House, Halim said creating pandemonium was against the decorum of this august institution.

 Please remember that by disrupting proceedings of the House, unruly legislators earn a bad name. That makes them unpopular in the constituencies they represent and may eventually lead to their defeat, the Speaker warned.

 The workshop had been organised to teach new MLAs the nuances of Assembly proceedings and how issues are to be raised in the House. This time, there are 117 new legislators, of whom 98 belong to the ruling Left Front.

 In a veiled reference to Opposition MLAs, the Speaker said many of those who had earlier disrupted proceedings in the House could not return to the Assembly. He added that some, however, did make it for reasons not known to him.

 According to Trinamul legislators Jyotipriya Mallick and Sonali Guha, the Speakers barb was aimed at them as they are known for frequently displaying their lung-power. 

 We are not fools to miss the Speakers criticism. He said such things to taunt us, Mallick said.

 Halim said the Opposition should take to the streets and stage demonstrations against government policies and not use the floor of the House. The form of protest inside the House and on the road cannot be the same and MLAs must realise this.

 The Speaker, however, told ruling party MLAs that they should not try to stifle the voice of the Opposition as the House belonged to the Opposition. 

 At this, Trinamuls Partha Chatterjee sprang up to say he was surprised that such a statement came from the Speaker who has denied equal time to the Left and the Opposition. Let the Speaker practise what he is preaching. If he says that the House belongs to the Opposition, why isnt he allotting the same time to us for participating in debates on the budget? he asked.

 Former government chief whip Rabin Deb explained the functioning of the Assembly and deliberated on what legislators are required to do during question and mention hour and how to speak on government bills.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Idle cash piles up in hungry belt

 NARESH JANA

 Amlashol, Aug. 24: Anchala 

 Pramanick of West Midnapores Namopara died this week after 

 surviving on water for seven days.

 Water there is aplenty in Belpahari 

 the rain has been pouring without mercy and so is money. 

 Crores of rupees are lying unused in the areas development 

 kitty. But its been days since villagers have had a grain 

 of rice on their plates.

 After Anchalas death, two other 

 stories of starvation surfaced in the area today. 

 Sukra Shabar of Amlashol and his 

 family havent eaten for two days. Shabar has no work and 

 no money. 

 In Banspahari, a hungry Bharati 

 Mahato lies on jute bags and tattered mattresses. Bharati, 

 who used to beg for a living, now begs for death. 

 At a time when the tribals of 

 the backward Belpahari, under Binpur-II block, are struggling 

 to get two square meals a day, about Rs 4 crore, allotted 

 by the Centre and the state government for various development 

 projects, has remained unspent.

 Most villagers here make a living 

 by selling sal or kendu leaves, but the rains 

 have left them sodden and worthless. The projects would 

 have given them jobs and some money to buy food.

 Initially, we did have problems 

 using the funds because of restrictions before the Assembly 

 elections. But recently we spent Rs 40 lakh on implementing 

 some schemes, said district magistrate D. Nariala.

 But a trip to a few gram panchayats 

 like Belpahari revealed that the rural bodies under Binpur-II 

 block had not started any project.

 The pradhan of the Belpahari gram 

 panchayat, Ruprekha Hembram, said she has received Rs 4.9 

 lakh. But we could not begin any work because of the monsoon, 

 she said. 

 Villagers, however, are not buying 

 any of these reasons. When Amlashol and starvation deaths 

 figured prominently in the media, we had government officers 

 and NGOs rushing to help us. But over the past five months, 

 not a single development project has been taken up, said 

 Tamal Das of Amlashol.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Aug. 11: Union water resources minister Saifuddin Soz today promised high priority for flood control projects to an all-party delegation from Bengal.

 The Teesta, Hooghly and Mayurakshi were identified as requiring urgent de-silting and erosion prevention. 

 After the meeting, Bengal irrigation minister Subhas Naskar said the delegation had asked for full central assistance to complete 11 long- pending flood control projects. 

 Soz advised the team to also write to the Planning Commission about these projects. 

 The 26-member delegation also met railway minister Lalu Prasad to request him to expedite work on extension of the Metro and electrification of tracks in north Bengal.

 Food minister Sharad Pawar told the team he would consider its demand for an increase in the price of levy rice and raising the allotment of wheat and kerosene in the public distribution system. 

 Naskar said defence minister Pranab Mukherjee and parliamentary affairs minister P.R. Das Munshi would monitor developments relating to the issues raised today.

 Clean-up off VIP Road

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 8: The public works department today pulled down a string of illegal constructions and link roads that had come up on the water body that runs along VIP Road in a bid to resuscitate the drainage system in the area.

 The clean-up, conducted jointly with the Rajarhat-Gopalpur municipality and police, was carried out over a stretch of almost 3 km from Kaikhali to Kestopur. 

 The 20-ft wide canal along VIP Road, which leads to Dum Dum airport, had disappeared over the years thanks to automobile showrooms, multi-storeyed buildings and other business establishments which had filled up portions of them. So we decided to remove the illegal link roads, said Tapas Chatterjee, the municipality chairman.

 Besides improving the drainage, an official who was part of todays team said, the drive would allow free flow of water along the clogged channels, destroying mosquito breeding grounds. 

 Last week, PWD and civic officials and the police held several rounds of meetings and agreed to go ahead with the clean-up. 

 Hordes of bulldozers and cranes were pressed into action this afternoon at Kestopur, Narayantala, Baguiati, Teghoria and Kaikhali. 

 With illegal link roads throwing up traffic onto the high-speed VIP Road, the possibility of major accidents was increasing alarmingly, a senior police officer said. 

 Representatives of the four automobile showrooms which built the link roads were clearly not happy with the drive. The municipality had sent reminders asking us to pull down the link road, but it should have allowed us more time to make alternative arrangements to allow cars that come for servicing make a quick entry, said Rajib Mitra, a Mukesh Hyundai manager. 

 The cars and two-wheelers will now have to make a detour.

 Singur, Dec. 18: Tapasi Malik was first strangled, which probably killed her, and then dragged to a pit and set on fire to ensure that she was dead.

 This is the preliminary finding of police probing the murder of the 18-year-old Krishi Jomi Banchao Committee activist. 

 Hours into the investigation, CID sleuths believe that the gang they are sure that more than one person was involved in the crime had used an aromatic organic compound, more volatile than kerosene, to set Tapasi on fire. It was done in a manner so that no evidence remained, said D.P. Tarenia, the CID inspector-general.

 Police said the motive behind the murder may not have anything to do with her agitation against land acquisition and it could be for a personal reason. 

 Tapasis tongue was out after death. So, it appears that she was strangulated. However, it would not be proper to comment at this moment as the post-mortem report is yet to arrive. We have also sought the help of forensic experts, Tarenia said.

 The police said her slippers, one of which was torn in half, was found some distance from where her burning body had been dumped. It proves that she was strangled, pulled to the pit and set on fire.

 From the cuts on her ank- les, the police believe that she was dragged through a field. 

 The fact that one of her slippers was torn suggests that a struggle had taken place, an officer said. The police have also found a clump of hair some distance from her slippers. 

 This is not an open-and-shut case and we need to talk to several people and witnesses to find out what possibly happened. There are so many areas that are grey, said an officer of the six-member CID team that came to Bajemelia. 

 While trying to make out who all besides Tapasis family were aware of her visits to the field at the break of dawn every day, the sleuths are looking for the list of policemen guarding the fence at the particular mouza. 

 We will surely collect the names of those who were on duty there last night, an officer said.

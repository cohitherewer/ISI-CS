 Mafia cloud on coal belt

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Durgapur May 25: The mafias reign of terror in the Asansol-Ranigunj coal belt has prompted authorities of Eastern Coalfields Limited (ECL) to knock on Burdwan polices door.

 In their complaint lodged with district superintendent of police Peeyush Pandey earlier this month, the ECL authorities said that in the past three months, at least 10 officials have been beaten up by hired goons of the coal mafia.

 The authorities pointed out that rampant coal smuggling by the mafia had hampered mining operations in Barabani, Jamuria, Ranigunj, Andal and Pandaveswar. 

 Security guards and ECL officials are threatened and attacked by the goons when they try to resist pilferage of coal.... Despite several complaints with the local police, no action has been taken yet, the complaint said.

 Ananda Chatterjee, director (personnel), ECL, said: We are helpless before these antisocials. They are beating up our officials and security personnel. We need immediate help from the police.

 On May 19, about 200 coal smugglers wielding guns, bhojalis and choppers went on an hour-long looting spree at a coal yard near Purusottampur village, 210 km from Calcutta. 

 When security officer K.L. Vijalwan saw them, he fired from his double-barrel gun. The smugglers fired back and then beat up the officer. 

 Two of Vijalwans colleagues ? Sanjivan Rajbhar and Alokendu Suri ? rushed to his rescue, but the goons snatched their guns and smashed them to pieces. They were thrashed as well. The three were later admitted to the ECL hospital in Asansol. 

 Senior officials led by Durgapur subdivisional police officer Pranab Kumar went to the spot the next day and told the officers-in-charge of local police stations to step up vigil.

 The ECL authorities and villagers complained to him that some local police officials were hand-in-glove with the coal mafia. Kumar promised to look into the matter.

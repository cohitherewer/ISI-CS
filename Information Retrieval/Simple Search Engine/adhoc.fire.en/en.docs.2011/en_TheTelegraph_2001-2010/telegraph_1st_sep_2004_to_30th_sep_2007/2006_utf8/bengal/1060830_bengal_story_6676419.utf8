The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Work on flat quota minus Salt Lake warts

 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE 

 Calcutta, Aug. 29: 

 In its 30-year rule in Bengal, the one allegation that has 

 haunted Left leaders time and again is indiscriminate and 

 opaque use of ministers quota for land and flat allotment. 

 To make all such controversies a thing of the past, the state housing department is working on a policy to ensure there is a method in the allotments from ministers quota. 

 We want to make the process of allotment trans-parent and above board. The new arrangement will make sure free flow of information on eligibility to apply for flats under ministers or chair- mens quotas and all other details regarding the allotment procedure, housing minister Gautam Deb told The Telegraph. 

 The move is a break from the past. According to data available with government departments, around a thousand plots in Salt Lake were allotted from then chief minister Jyoti Basus quota. But there is no information in public domain about the procedure followed or the eligibility of recipients. 

 According to Deb, also chairman of the West Bengal Housing Board, he can allot up to 5 per cent of the flats built by either the board or a joint venture company.

 The board has built housing complexes in New Town, Howrah and off the EM By- pass. 

 Besides, it has joined hands with five private develo-pers for the construction of condominiums in New Town, where flat owners would be chosen through drawing of lots. About 100 flats will be allotted from the ministers quota. 

 There is no question of allotting plots or flats secretively as we have formulated a foolproof system. A valid applicant will get a plot or a flat, subject to availability, added Deb. 

 The housing department has specified the categories (see chart) of people eligible to apply for a flat from the ministers quota. 

 We have invited applications for the flats. All the applications will be placed be- fore a committee for scrutiny and it will make allotments, Deb said. 

 A similar policy, the min-ister added, would be adop- ted for plot allotments in New Town.

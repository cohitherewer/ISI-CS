 Hi-tech rigging bogus: Pranab

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, May 21: Defence minister Pranab Mukherjee today trashed Mamata Banerjees charge that the CPM had resorted to hi-tech rigging to win the elections and that his office was involved in the manufacture of voting machines that were tampered with.

 (The) allegations of hi-tech rigging are baseless and bogus, Mukherjee said this afternoon. 

 Stunned by the Trinamul Congresss poll drubbing, Mamata revived the rigging charge that had been routine after earlier elections. 

 This year, though, she had credited the Election Commission with conducting the most free and fair polls, until the results were declared.

 The people voted for change but that wasnt reflected in the results as the EVMs were tampered with, the Trinamul chief said on Friday.

 She also alleged that the defence ministry was involv-ed in the manufacture of the EVMs that had been tampered with. 

 Asked to comment on Mamatas allegation, Mukherjee today flared up. The defence ministry has nothing to do with EVMs. Mamata does not know what she is saying. 

 Mukherjee also put the blame on Mamata for the complete rout of the Opposition in the polls. In 2001, when Trinamul had fought the elections jointly with the Congress, we won nearly 90 seats. This time, too, we had asked her to snap ties with the BJP and team up with us, but she didnt agree. Had she done that, the results would have been different. 

 Mukherjee had resigned as the state Congress president taking responsibility for the poll debacle the day the results were announced.

 Today he turned down requests to withdraw his resignation from senior party leaders, who called on him in his south Calcutta house. 

 Mukherjee also did not visit the state Congress office today.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Planted: vegetable boosters

 OUR BUREAU

Calcutta, Sept. 4: Two seeds have been sown that may one day help Bengals next big dream agri-business bear fruit.

 The government was today handed a blueprint for an agriculture marketing terminal that could almost double the earnings of farmers and reduce wastage of perishable products.

 Rabo India Finance, which was asked by the Centre to carry out feasibility studies for setting up eight such terminals in the country, has suggested that the market be located at Dankuni as farms in the region produce 18 million tonnes of vegetables a year.

 The government also signed a memorandum of understanding with a central outfit the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (Apeda) to set up a Rs 5.51-crore cargo complex for perishable agri-products in Haldia.

 The two events were unrelated but their impact should be felt on Bengals plans for agri-business, identified as a thrust area by the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government.

 We recommended that an integrated market for fruits and vegetables be set up at Dankuni and the area around Dhulagarh truck terminal, said Rajesh Srivastava, man- aging director of Rabo India Finance.

 The agriculture marketing terminal will require over 90 acres and an investment of Rs 100 crore. Modelled on auction markets, the terminal is expected to handle 1,500 tonnes a day. 

 According to the Rabo proposal, farmers will sell their produce at base prices at 12 collection centres in nearby districts. The produce will be brought to the market, where it will be graded, stored and auctioned to wholesalers.

 Farmers in Bengal get only 27 per cent of the market value paid by the end-consumer. Besides, around 22 per cent of the total produce gets wasted, Srivastava said.

 However, if the new market is established, farmers will get good prices, at least 50 per cent of the market price. Also, since cold storage chains will be involved, wastage will be down to 5 per cent, he added.

 As the products will be graded and standardised, they will be export-worthy, too.

 The cargo complex, the deal for which was signed with Apeda, is also expected to boost exports. 

 Lack of storage facilities is one of the biggest hurdles before the growth of agri-business in states like Bengal, where the soil is ideal for growing vegetables.

 We have long wanted a cargo complex at Haldia for perishable items. Apeda has sanctioned Rs 5.51 crore for the project. It will take a year to complete, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said.

 The facility will come up on 4 acres around 2 km from the Haldia Dock Complex.

 Many fruits and vegetab-les like mango, lychee, banana, tomato, cauliflower and potato from Bengal have a good export market, K.S. Mani of Apeda said.

 For potatoes, a chamber that can hold 500 tonnes will be built. Mango and lychee will get chambers of 50 tonnes each, while the meat and marine products cell will be able to hold 60 tonnes.

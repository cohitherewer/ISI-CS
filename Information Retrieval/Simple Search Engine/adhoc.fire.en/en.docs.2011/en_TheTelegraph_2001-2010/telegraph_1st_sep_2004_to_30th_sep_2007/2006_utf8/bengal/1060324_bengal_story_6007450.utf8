 Rebels play track trick

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

Shalboni, March 23: A group of alleged Maoists kept railway officials on tenterhooks last night after they awoke a level crossing gateman near Midnapore town and told him that tracks had been blown up.

 The rebels left behind leaflets questioning the huge deployment of security forces to hold elections, police said.

 Around 1 am, Amar Chandra Mukhi, the gateman of the Bhadutala level crossing, about 8 km from Midnapore town, informed the nearest stationmaster at Godapiasal, who raised an alarm.

 Senior officials arrived at the spot with Railway Protection Force and Government Railway Police jawans. District superintendent of police Ajay Nand, too, reached there.

 The 316 Down Barakar-Howrah Express and the 315 Up Chakradharpur-Howrah Passenger were held up at the Shalboni and Midnapore stations while the 2816 Down Nilachal Express was stopped at Bishnupur station. Bilashibala Sahis, the minister of state for backward classes welfare, was in the passenger train but said she did not know what had happened.

 Nearly 1,500 security forces and railway officials inspected 22 km of tracks between the Shalboni and Midnapore railway stations till about 5 am. The trains were allowed to roll after 5.15 am when the officials were satisfied it was a false alarm.

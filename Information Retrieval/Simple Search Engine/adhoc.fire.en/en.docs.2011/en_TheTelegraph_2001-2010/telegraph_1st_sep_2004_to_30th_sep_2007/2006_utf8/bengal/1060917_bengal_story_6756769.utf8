The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Evening shift on court cards

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 16: The Supreme Court and the Union law ministry are thinking of introducing a second-shift system in subordinate courts in Bengal and elsewhere in the country for speedy disposal of pending cases.

 Apart from the existing alternative dispute redressal system, a second-shift system in the courts is also under our consideration. But I shall not elaborate on the matter at the moment, Chief Justice of India Y.K. Sabharwal said today.

 Justice Sabharwal was in the city to lay the foundation stone for the West Bengal Judicial Academy at New Town. Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee was also present.

 According to the proposed system, an evening session will be started in subordinate courts, including lok adalats, pension adalats and fast-track courts, to deal with pending cases.

 The Chief Justice of Calcutta High Court, V.S. Sirpurkar, has received a letter from the apex court seeking his opinion about introducing the second-shift system, an officer said.

 According to a report, 2. 3 crore cases are pending with courts across the country. Of them, about 95 per cent are lying with subordinate courts.

 Calcutta High Court officials said the judiciarys repeated requests to the state government for more judges in subordinate courts have fallen on deaf ears.

 If additional judges are appointed, the state government will have to provide infrastructure facilities and orderlies. This will lead to enormous expenses. So, the apex court is working on a proposal so that the existing courts can be used to hear cases in the evening session, an official said.

 But the second-shift system, too, brings with it its share of expenses. The state government will have to provide facilities like water and electricity in courts in the evening. Besides, the administration will have to deploy additional forces on the court premises after dark.

 An approval from the state government is a must before introducing the changed system. All high courts in the country have been asked to discuss the matter with the respective governments and send their opinions, said an official.

 Speaking at the foundation stone-laying ceremony in New Town, the chief minister stressed the need for judicial education to combat organised crimes and cyber crimes. We will provide all sorts of assistance to the judiciary in this matter, Bhattacharjee said.

 Student locked up

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Aug. 23: A kindergarten student was locked up in a toilet because he had allegedly disturbed his class.

 Three hours later, when the Ranaghat school had given over and four-year-old Subhankar Pals mother was looking for him frantically, his friends said that he was in the toilet. The teacher had forgotten about him.

 The boy brought out of the toilet of Malancha Sishu Niketan, 65 km from Calcutta, was sobbing, shivering and gas- ping. His mother Tapati took him to the subdivisional hospital, where he spent last night. 

 Subhankars parents lodged a police complaint today. He is scared to return to class, said Biswajit, his father.

 Many guardians demonstrated in front of the school. 

 Nadia police chief R. Rajsekharan said a case had been started against both the teacher and the school. 

 The principal, Iva Sinha, said: The teacher has denied locking up Subhankar.

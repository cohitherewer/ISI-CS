The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Biman calls for hitback, Anil uplift

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bandwan, Jan. 10: In the Maoist hot bed, the CPM leadership today asked party workers to use arms to resist the rebels, if necessary.

 Addressing a public meeting near Bandwan bus stand in Purulia, 340 km from Calcutta, CPM politburo member Biman Bose said: Make sure next time they cannot escape after an attack.

 Bose and state party secretary Anil Biswas sought to up the morale of party workers and supporters, sagging in the wake of district secretariat member Rabindranath Kars murder. The Maoists burnt Kar with his wife in his house in Bandwan on January 1.

 The Trinamul Congress is aiding the rebels, Bose said. 

 Unlike him, Biswas did not speak of a counter offensive. Like in Calcutta, he said the CPM will try to develop backward districts like Purulia, even if hundreds of Rabindranath Kars are killed.

 The party, he added, will rebut the violence unleashed by the CPI (Maoist) guerrillas in Purulia, Bankura and West Midnapore politically. 

 These Maoists live in forests and jungles. Some day, even the animals will drive them out.

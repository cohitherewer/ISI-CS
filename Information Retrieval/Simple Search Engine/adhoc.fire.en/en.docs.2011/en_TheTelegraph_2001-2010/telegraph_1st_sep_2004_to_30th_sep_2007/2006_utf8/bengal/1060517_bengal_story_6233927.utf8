The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, May 16: Bhatpara in North 24-Parganas recorded 68 per cent polling today.

 A presiding officer was removed from duty as he had positioned the voting machine in such a way that from a distance one could tell who was pressing which button. Nine people, who were trying to enter booths or canvassing, were held.

 Calcutta: Five-year-old Mayurish Tarasha, who was kidnapped on her way home from school in Garden Reach on Tuesday, was rescued in the evening and one of the goons was arrested. Her father Wajid Ahmed, a businessman, went to Sarobar Manzil with the ransom of Rs 10 lakh, a police team in tow. Soheb Alam, 20, was arrested there.

 Calcutta: The high court on Tuesday reserved its order on a petition by the mother of Nitai Das, who was allegedly killed inside Bally police station four years ago. Ashoka Das had moved the court after a Howrah sessions judge stayed proceedings against four policemen who are now behind bars. The high court had earlier slammed the government for protecting the policemen accused of murder. On Sunday, the CBI arrested four policemen for a custody death in Kharagpur.

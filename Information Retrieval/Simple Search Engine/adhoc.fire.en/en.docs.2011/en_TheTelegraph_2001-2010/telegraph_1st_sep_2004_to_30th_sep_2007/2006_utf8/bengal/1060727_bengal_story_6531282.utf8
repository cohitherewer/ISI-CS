The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 50% for bargadars ruled out

 - Industry-versus-agriculture debate flares up again

 BISWAJIT ROY

 Calcutta, July 26: Differences within the government and the CPM over land acquisition for industry and farmers compensation have come to the fore yet again. 

 Industries minister Nirupam Sen today ruled out any change in law to facilitate payment of 50 per cent of the value of acquired land to sharecroppers as compensation. 

 Land and land reforms minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah and a section of the CPM peasants wing, the Krishak Sabha, had earlier demanded an amendment to the acquisition act. 

 CPM allies today expressed unhappiness over a CPM note on land and industry-related issues prepared by Sen. They are likely to seek more clarification at the front meeting on Friday. 

 According to the land ac- quisition act, bargadars (sharecroppers) are to be paid as compensation six times the value of the annual produce of the land they till. It is not possible to change the law to facilitate the payment of 50 per cent of the land value to displaced bargadars, which is a lot more. We will try to provide alternative livelihood to them by creating jobs in downstream industries that would come up on the acquired land, Sen told The Telegraph. 

 He gave two reasons for not accepting Mollahs formula. First, it will open a floodgate of compensation claims as many landowners will try to extract more money by recording their relatives as share- croppers. Second, it will be an extra burden on the land-acquiring agencies and investors. 

 According to Sen, sharecroppers are entitled to half of the harvest of the land they till. By this logic, the landowners should share the compensation with their sharecroppers, a proposition that is neither acceptable to landowners nor to the government. 

 The demand for 50 per cent of the land price to the bargadars was first raised after the government announced a hefty compensation for the landowners. Mollah also set in motion the campaign to amend the law to facilitate the hike in the sharecroppers compensation, but the differences within stalled it. 

 Now, Mollah has submitted a note to the party brass warning them that the sharecroppers ? the original beneficiaries of the Left Fronts land reforms, who form a solid support base ? may feel alienated because of pro-industry policies. There are 15 lakh recorded bargadars in the state. 

 CPI, RSP and Forward Bloc leaders today complained that the CPMs much-awaited note on land for industry failed to mention the Salim Group, Tata Motors or Reliance projects for which the government is planning to acquire vast tracts of agricultural land. 

 It only apparently stressed the need to increase agri-productivity, revival of the land use board and a land bank for planned industrialisation. 

 The note is said to be silent on Mukesh Ambanis proposed agri-retail chain and the compensation for the sharecroppers.

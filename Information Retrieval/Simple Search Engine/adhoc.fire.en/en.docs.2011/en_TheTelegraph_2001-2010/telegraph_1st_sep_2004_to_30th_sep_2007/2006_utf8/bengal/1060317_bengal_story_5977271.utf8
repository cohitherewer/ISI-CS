 Centre scans flu shield

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, March 16: The Centre today held a video conference with state government officials to gauge Bengals preparedness in controlling and containing avian influenza in case of an outbreak.

 Animal resources development (ARD) secretary Subesh Das spoke to Union ARD secretary P.M.A. Hakram and Union joint secretary of the animal husbandry department Upma Chawdhry on the security measures undertaken by the state government to tackle bird flu.

 Sikkim, Uttaranchal, Orissa, Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand were among the other states which participated in the video conference.

 The state government told the Centre that Bengal has banned import of layer eggs and table eggs from Gujarat and Maharashtra.

 Das said the Centre is happy with the steps taken by the Bengal government to handle a bird flu crisis.

 He also said that out of 6,000 samples sent for tests to a Bhopal laboratory, 1,700 were from Bengal, while 1,300 were from other states of the eastern region.

 All the samples sent from the eastern zone have tested negative for the avian flu virus. Hence, there is no need to panic, especially in Bengal, said Das.

 Two veterinary officers from Bengal will go to Bhopal for a training programme on March 23 and 24 so that the preliminary testing for viruses of Ranikhet disease as well as avian flu can be done at the regional disease diagnostic laboratory in Belgachhia, said Das.

 The Bhopal lab will also provide equipment and supplies, including antigens and serum required to conduct tests.

 Poultry dealers have decided to stall production of poultry in the wake of the fresh outbreak in Maharashtra.

 The vice-president of the Poultry Welfare Association and chief executive officer of Sundarban Hatcheries, Manoranjan Naskar, chaired a meeting with poultry farmers of South 24-Parganas today to decide measures to be undertaken in case of a crisis.

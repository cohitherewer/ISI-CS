The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Cell swipers in net

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 4: The first breakthrough in the probe into a series of cellphone shop heists in central Calcutta came today as sleuths picked up a duo from the citys southern outskirts.

 Rezaul and Ansal were rounded up from a hotel at Ghutiari Sharif where they took refuge. 

 During interrogation, they apparently confessed to the crime and disclosed the names of their accomplices, who were also part of the break-ins. 

 Police refused to disclose their names for the sake of investigation.

 Gyanwant Singh, the detective department deputy commissioner, said: A hunt is on to track them down. We have information that they are still in and around the city.

 A group of burglars broke open the shutter of a mobile shop in Burrabazar last month and decamped with three phones and Rs 1.5 lakh. 

 Five-seven complaints regarding cellphone thefts, including many from shops that sell them, come to the police everyday, but the gang had managed to outwit them.

 Officers of the detective departments anti-rowdy squad said they swung into action immediately after the Burrabazar heist, but their effort drew a blank till yesterday.

 We got the first smell of the breakthrough this morning, admitted an officer. A team of six officers fanned out immediately.

 The police described Ghutiari Sharif ? under Canning police station in South 24-Parganas, about 60 km from the city centre ? as an infamous refuge for criminals. 

 Had the duos accomplices come to know about our raid, they could have snatched them, said another officer. 

 According to the detective department, the burglars sneaked into eight business establishments in the past two months. We are zeroing in on a group based in the Burrabazar-Posta area that works as local operatives for the miscreants, said an officer, adding that without the help of local people, committing one crime after another in congested areas is not possible.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Never in jail, never a freedom fighter

 RABI BANERJEE

 Shasthi Charan Das: 

 Freedom Fruithful? 

 Krishnagar, Feb. 12: Shasthi Charan Das fought the British 

 and took part in the Quit India movement but, unfortunately, 

 he was never arrested. 

 So, it took him a few decades 

 to convince the administrators of Independent India that 

 he was indeed a freedom fighter. 

 Das, 82, is on the brink fighting 

 red tape and starvation. 

 He had applied to the Centre and 

 the state government in 1980 when pension was first introduced 

 for freedom fighters. All this while dozens of letters were 

 exchanged and the governments made various excuses like 

 application under consideration and file 

 transferred to the relevant department for the delay.

 Over 25 years on, the resident 

 of Murutia in Nadia, about 180 km from Calcutta, has finally 

 been told that his claim has been cleared and the money 

 due to him would reach him soon.

 A district official said the problem 

 was that he was never put behind bars. Because he 

 was never in a jail, his name could not be found in the 

 prison records. The list of pensioners is mostly drawn from 

 these records.

 Das was more or less resigned 

 to his fate and met district magistrate Rajesh Pandey as 

 a last resort this January. 

 Is it my fault that I never 

 went to jail? Does it mean that I am not a freedom fighter? 

 I took part in the Quit India Movement called by Mahatma 

 Gandhi. I was a teenager and, along with other youths, was 

 given the responsibility of disrupting the British supply 

 line ? snapping electricity and telegraph connections in 

 Kushtia and Rajsahi of undivided Bengal ? during the war 

 (World War II). The British declared me an absconder in 

 1944 but could not arrest me as I always gave them the slip, 

 he said, breaking down in tears. 

 With my 70-year-old wife, 

 Sumati, I am on the verge of walking the streets with a 

 begging bowl. Please save us, Das implored. 

 For the past 10 years, the Dases 

 have been living in extreme poverty. Their son Nikhil, who 

 used to work as a daily labourer, is now bed-ridden with 

 a nerve disease. 

 Their 15-year-old grandson has 

 dropped out of school and started pulling a rickshaw.

 The old man often sang hymns and 

 read out from Ramayan to villagers, but that hardly ensured 

 a living. 

 Pandey wrote to the finance department 

 seeking the details of Dass file. 

 On the birth anniversary of Bengals 

 most loved freedom fighter, Subhas Chandra Bose ? January 

 23 ? the district magistrate got the governments confirmation 

 that Das was a bona fide freedom fighter. 

 Now theres no problem. 

 I will write to the Union home ministry proposing his (Das) 

 name for the pension, Pandey said.

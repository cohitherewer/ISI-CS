The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Business duo in bus crash

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Sevoke (10th Mile), Aug. 6: Two partners of a Calcutta-based construction company died on the spot when their Scorpio collided head-on with a bus near here this morning. 

 Tapan Niyogi, 40, of Matigara in Siliguri and Nirmal Bhattacharya, 50, of Regent Park, Calcutta, owned Esquire Construction Company. 

 The accident took place around 8 am, when a black Scorpio, which was being driven by one of the two businessmen, was hit by a Kalimpong-bound minibus coming from New Jalpaiguri station. 

 The spot, near the boundary of Mahananda Wildlife Sanctuary, 21 km from Siliguri, is known to be accident-prone.

 Hiralal Pandey, a family friend of both and a resident of Matigara, said they wanted to buy stones from Sevoke and started their journey at 6.30 am. They met with the accident on their way back to Siliguri.

 Witnesses said both vehicles were moving fast and collided at a bend. 

 The impact sent the Scorpio cartwheeling. A mangled heap, it came to rest on its roof some distance away. No one in the bus was seriously injured, though it overturned.

 The conductor of the bus, Gajanand Sharma, said the driver had tried to stop the vehicle, but failed. 

 Police blamed reckless driving for frequent accidents on the stretch. Residents blamed the police for failing to impose speed limits.

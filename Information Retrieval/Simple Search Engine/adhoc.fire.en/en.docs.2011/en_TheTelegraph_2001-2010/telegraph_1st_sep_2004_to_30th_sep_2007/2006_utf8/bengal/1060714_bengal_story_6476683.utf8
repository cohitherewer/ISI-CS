 Officer comes to brides rescue

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, July 13: As the auspicious hour dawned, Rupali Pal sat in her wedding finery waiting for her groom. He did not come, police did.

 An officer from Nadias Kalyani police station showed Rupalis father Bijoy Shankar Pal a photograph of a man accused in four rape cases. It was Sunu Das, his would-be son-in-law.

 Bijoy, a sweet shopowner in Pairadanga, 60 km from Calcutta, had spent his lifes savings to arrange his 19-year-old daughters wedding. He had given Sunu an almirah, a dressing table, a gold ring and a gold chain. The 30-year-old resident of Kalyani had told Bijoy that he was a vegetable trader. 

 Last night around 8, the police arrived at Bijoys house. 

 I reached in time to save the girl. The moment I received a tip-off that Sunu was going to marry the girl in Pairadanga, I rushed to arrest Sunu and stop the marriage, said Samarendra Das, the inspector in charge of Kalyani police station. 

 The officer waited till late at night with his constables but Sunu did not turn up. Probably, someone had tipped off Sunu about my presence, he said.

 When Bijoy heard about Sunu, his world came crashing down. Sir, my daughter will be socially ostracised and no one will want to marry her, he wept. 

 Das then asked the guests if anybody was willing to take Rupalis hand. Four youths came forward.

 After interviewing each of them and convinced of their sincerity, the officer asked Rupali to choose. 

 She picked Krishna Ghosh, a neighbour and a utensil trader. They were married around midnight.

 Das returned to Kalyani and raided Sunus house and seized the gifts Bijoy had given him.

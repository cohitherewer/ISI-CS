The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 BRIEFS

 Krishnagar: Hugging the chief minister is not always the wisest thing to do. 

 MLA Shibdas Mukherjee, the Congress candidate for Krishnagar East, had locked Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee in a bear hug after being called to the dais at a function six months ago. The chief minister had felt sorry that the local MLA was being ignored, and the Opposition leader was moved by the gesture. Mukherjee, who won on a Trinamul ticket in 2001, is now in the Congress and his former party is distributing his pictures with Bhattacharjee. How can he claim to be anti-CPM? asked a Trinamul leader.

Ranaghat: Trinamul supporters here were breathing fire at 

their Didi on Thursday. Mamata Banerjee skipped a rally for Tapas Ghosh apparently 

because he is taking on the Congresss Shankar Singh from Ranaghat West. 

Singh had been an advocate of a Congress-Trinamul pact. How could Didi do 

this to us on the last day of campaigning? asked a supporter.

 Calcutta: The Maoists might have failed to leave any impact on the election in their strongholds, but they made their presence felt in the chief ministers constituency on Thursday. Around the time Bhattacharjee was addressing a string of meetings in Jadavpur, four youths on cycles pasted pro-Maoist posters on houses.

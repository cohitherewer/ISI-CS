 Son dead, Rs 3.5 lakh to school

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Kantabari (South Dinajpur), 

 Oct. 30: The father of a teenager who died a couple 

 of months ago today gave the entire Rs 3.5 lakh he got from 

 his life insurance policy to the school where the boy studied 

 and where he works. 

 Uday Roy, 18, who had just finished school, was returning home from college in a trekker when a bus hit it at Kaliaganj. The first-year student was killed on the spot, a few hundred metres from his home.

 Sushil Chandra Roy handed over the cheque for Rs 3.5 lakh to the head teacher of Kantabari-Adibari High School, where he is a clerk. 

 The 57-year-old man and his wife are now childless.

 The head teacher, Animesh Lahiri, said: We will build a classroom in Udays name and institute a scholarship for the meritorious and poor.

 Roy said Uday was not a brilliant student, but he tried hard. 

 So he was all the more pleased with the schools decision to use Rs 1.5 lakh for the scholarship named after his son. 

 Roy said he knew the school with around 2,000 students was cash-strapped.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 After play, rebels rob amp; rough up police team

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Purulia, Nov. 29: A band of Maoists first enjoyed a jatra show in a Bengal village and then attacked a police team returning to their station early this morning.

 Three rifles and a revolver were looted and the policemen beaten up and shot at in front of hundreds of people trudg- ing back through a village path after seeing Ostader Maar Shesh Raatey in the Barabazar area of Purulia district.

 One of them was hit in the neck by a bullet. The condition of four others was also said to be serious. They have been admitted to the district hospital.

 After the 20-minute operation, they fled towards the Dalma range, leaving behind leaflets and shouting Maoist slogans, superintendent of police Ashoke Prasad said. 

 On the way back, the rebels set ablaze equipment being used to construct a road at Paharpur in the Patanda police station area of Jharkhand. 

 Todays Maoist attack is the third in Bengal over the past week. On November 23, the rebels sabotaged a showpiece road scheme at Chhurimara in West Midnapore to avenge the polices failure to respond to a tribal girls rape charge against a labour contractor working on the project. Four days later, they stopped a bus at Paluidanga village in West Midnapores Binpur and looted two rifles from policemen. 

 The guerrillas had merged with the crowd during the show, about 320 km from Calcutta, for which 16 policemen were deployed. After it ended, seven policemen stayed back to escort the artistes to the main road. The other nine headed to their jeep parked about 300 metres away, an officer said.

 The Maoists pounced on them near the jeep. 

 Assistant sub-inspector Srijib Pande, 52, who fired from his revolver, collapsed mom- ents later as he was hit on the head from behind.

 On regaining sense a few minutes later, he crawled into a bush and called the Barabazar police station.

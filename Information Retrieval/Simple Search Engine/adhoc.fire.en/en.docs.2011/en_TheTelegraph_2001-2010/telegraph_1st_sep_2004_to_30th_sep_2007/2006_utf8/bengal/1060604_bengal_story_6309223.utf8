 CPM pushes land deal

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta/Singur, June 3: The CPM today asked its leaders in Hooghly to facilitate smooth acquisition of farmland for Tata Motors small-car unit at Singur.

 The Tatas want 1,000 acres at Singur in Hooghly, 45 km from Calcutta, for the Rs 1,000-crore car plant.

 The CPMs Hooghly zonal secretary Suhrid Dutta and district secretariat member Balai Sabui, who is also the vice-president of the partys peasant wing, have been asked to hold talks with farmers and the CPMs allies to expedite the acquisition of farmland for industry.

 The move follows reports about disquiet among the peasant wings of front constituents ? the Forward Bloc, RSP and the CPI ? over acquisition of land.

 The CPI yesterday said that farmers would not part with farmland until the governments compensation package meets their demands. 

 Under the package offered, land will be acquired at 30 per cent over the market rate with an additional 10 per cent for farmers who hand over their land voluntarily.

 But what is the basis for determining the price of the land? Have the farmers been consulted? Are they at the mercy of the government? asked CPI MP Probodh Panda.

 Dutta and Sabui today began holding meetings with small groups of farmers.

 The farmers are reluctant to part with their land. They have been asking for jobs in the proposed unit in addition to the compensation. We are trying to convince them, said Dutta.

 On Wednesday, local leaders of the CPMs peasant wing, Krishak Sabha, had met their counterparts from the front constituents.

 Panda, also the chief of the CPI-controlled Pradeshik Krishak Sabha, said a proper compensation package would have to be worked out taking into account the price the land would fetch after 20 years and the amount a farmer would earn by selling produce for that period.

 If farmers are not compensated this way, they will be deprived of the real value of land and the money they earn by selling their produce. The government will have to consider what a farmer and his family will do after giving away the land. He should get enough to run his family for the next 20 years, Panda said.

 Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee today demanded the publication of a white paper on the land that would be taken from farmers to set up industries.

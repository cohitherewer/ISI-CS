The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Teacher dumps lover

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, May 13: A 25-year-old woman has lodged a police complaint alleging that a man who lived with her for two years and had promised to marry her, disappeared after he got a job last month.

 Shyamali Kirtania also moved the assistant chief judicial magistrates court yesterday. The court directed the police to start a case of rape and cheating against Tapas Sarkar, 26, of Chakdah.

 Shyamali knew Tapas from her college days but he refused to marry her as he was jobless. She then married a businessman in Ranaghat two and a half years ago.

 Soon after marriage, I realised I would not be able to live without Tapas. I sought a divorce from my husband and he agreed, Shyamali said. She got a divorce six months ago.

 Shyamali and Tapas started living in a rented house in Chakdah, about 60 km from Calcutta. We ran a tuition centre at our apartment. He promised to marry me as soon as he got a job, Shyamali said.

 However, after Tapas, who has a Masters in Bengali, got a teachers job in a Chakdah secondary school last month, he left Shyamali.

 She also alleged that when her mother, Anima, visited the Sarkars with a marriage proposal, they assaulted her. Tapass father Amal, a businessman, sister Manashi and her husband Basu, who surrendered in court today, were granted bail. But Amal accused Shyamali of conspiring against Tapas.

 Police have launched a search for Tapas.

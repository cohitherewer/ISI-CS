 Any-time money for wives

 A JAWAN INSIDE? NOT LIKELYRABI BANERJEE

 Krishnagar, March 22: Willy-nilly, many Border Security Force jawans do not regularly send money home. So, their wives would be armed with ATM cards to enable them to access their husbands salary account. 

 We are very worried about the families of our jawans. We have received letters from many of their wives in various parts of the country describing their hardship as they dont get money from their husbands regularly, said R.C. Saxena, the principal staff officer of the BSF.

 The solution, the force brass think, lies in the swipe cards. It has been decided that the personnel, now paid in cash, will be paid through ATMs. Once the new system starts, wives of about 25,000 jawans posted in the two 24-Parganas, Nadia, Murshidabad and Malda will get a second ATM card so that they do not have to wait for their husbands money orders or bank drafts.

 We have spoken to several banks and the process is on, Saxena added. 

 Salaries of jawans in Jammu and Kashmir, Rajasthan and Punjab now go directly to the bank. But in Bengal, only officers get the benefit. Beginning from south, the scheme will gradually be extended to north Bengal.

 But all jawans might not agree to the idea of leaving an ATM card with their wives. BSF officers are now trying to convince them about the usefulness of the new system. Bachelors and divorcees will receive single cards. 

 Efforts are on to make all married jawans come under the double-card system, an officer said. A jawans wife in Rajasthan or Uttaranchal for example can then draw money the moment her husband gets the salary in faraway Bengal.

 Anil Sharma of Himachal Pradesh, who is posted in Hanskhali, about 70 km from Calcutta, has opted for the new system. I often face problem sending money home on time as I am very busy on duty on the Bangladesh border. Moreover, I have to pay service charges for the money order and drafts, he said. His wife, Sharma added, complains about the delay and finds it difficult to make ends meet.

 The decision to do away with cash payments was taken after the officers received a few hundred letters from wives of jawans. Five jawans wives, an officer said, have committed suicide in the past two years.

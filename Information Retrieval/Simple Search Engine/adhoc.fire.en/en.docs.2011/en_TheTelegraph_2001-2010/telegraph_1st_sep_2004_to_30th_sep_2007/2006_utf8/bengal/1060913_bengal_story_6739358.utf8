 Cong eyeing Mamata bond

 OUR BUREAU

 Purulia/Burdwan, Sept. 12: Union minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi today confirmed what has been understood over the past few days that the Congresss seat adjustment with Mamata Banerjee for the September 16 bypolls would pave the way for a firmer alliance in the future. 

 Todays seat adjustment would lead to a greater alliance with the Trinamul Congress, he told an election rally at Bandwan in Purulia, about 280 km from calcutta. 

 For the Purulia Lok Sabha seat, for example, Trinamul has thrown its weight behind the Congress.

 Das Munshi said the Opposition had suffered a drubbing in May Assembly elections as Trinamul and Congress candidates fought each other. 

 We have learnt that the Opposition can emerge a formidable alternative only if it stands united, the Union information and broadcasting minister said while addressing a string of rallies for the Congresss Shantiram Mahato. 

 As he spoke, Trinamuls Purulia president K.P. Singdeo sat next to him on the dais.

 Almost at the same time, Mamata said in Katwa the time had come for all secular, anti-Left forces to join hands. 

 Congress workers are sweating for Trinamuls Sushanta Ghosh in this Lok Sabha constituency.

 If we are able to put up a straight fight against the CPM and prevent a split in votes, we can beat the Left Front, the Trinamul chief told a gathering at Kusumgram in Burd- wan, 150 km from Calcutta. 

 Mamata had paved the way for the alliance by deciding to support the Congresss Abu Hossain Khan Chowdhury in Malda to pay respect to the late Ghani Khan Chowdhury. 

 The AICC general secretary in charge of Bengal, Margaret Alva, reciprocated by asking the state leadership not to field candidates in Katwa and the Bongaon Assembly seat. 

 Moved, Mamata extended her support to her parent party in Purulia.

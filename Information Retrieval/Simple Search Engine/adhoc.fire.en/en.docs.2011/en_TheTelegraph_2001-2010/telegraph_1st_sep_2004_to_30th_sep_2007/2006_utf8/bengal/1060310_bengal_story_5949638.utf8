The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 EC rap for purge laxity

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 9: The Election Commission today cracked the whip on poll-bound Bengal, expressing concern over ?unimpressive? progress in deletion of bogus voters? names in urban areas and directing the state?s chief electoral officer (CEO) to monitor the progress and report back.

 The commission directed the poll authorities of the state that modifications made during revision of electoral rolls should be cross-checked and electoral registration officers (EROs) and assistant EROs should certify their correctness, sources said.

 The commission issued its directive on the basis of the report of its observers who visited the state for the third time to review poll preparations.

 The report was discussed at a meeting of the full commission headed by chief election commissioner B.B. Tandon.

 The commission ordered the Bengal poll authorities to continuously update the electoral rolls and monitor the progress on a weekly basis. 

 It also directed the CEO to increase the number of mobile teams for issue of elector photo identity cards to ensure maximum coverage.

 The poll officials were asked to personally monitor the results, and non-performance would be viewed seriously, sources said.

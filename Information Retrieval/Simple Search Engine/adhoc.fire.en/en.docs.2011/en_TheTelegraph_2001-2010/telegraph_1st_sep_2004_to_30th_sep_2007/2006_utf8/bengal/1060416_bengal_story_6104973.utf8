 Gun peddlers in city on poll-eve

 Calcutta, April 15: Gangsters from Bihar and Jharkhand are lurking in the city, peddling arms in the election market.

 Police, who have been combing the city, arrested four persons with arms late this evening. One person was caught from Cossipore, one from Garden Reach ? both had country-made pistols ?and two from Tangra, from whom a Spanish SLR rifle was seized. 

 According to an officer of the detective department, four gangs of gun dealers from Bihar and Jharkhand arrived in the city 10 days ago to sell weapons to criminals allegedly linked to various political parties.

 Considering the demand for arms in the run-up to the Assembly elections, these groups have brought a large number of country-made pistols. They have local contacts and are hiding in the city and its suburbs. Acting on a tip-off, we raided several hideouts but by that time, they had fled, the officer said. 

 Most of these arms are made in Munger, Nawada and Bihar Sharif. A country-made pistol costs between Rs 800 and Rs 1,000. Some sophisticated pistols have also found their way into the city and their prices range from Rs 22,000 to Rs 25,000. 

 Gyanwant Singh, the deputy commissioner, detective department, said gangs from the neighbouring states had parked themselves in the city during past elections as well. 

 Its a major racket and criminals from Bihar and Jharkhand are involved. They bring arms, especially country-made pistols, along with some sophisticated ones and sell them to criminals in the city. Our officers are conducting raids to flush out the gangs. Groups like these had come to the city during last years civic elections as well, Singh said.

 He added that officers from all police stations have been alerted. 

 The gangs this time are staying in slums in areas like Entally, Metiabruz, Cossipore, Howrah, Topsia and Tiljala, police said. Two of them are led by Sanjay Agarwal and Bhuian, who are from Nawada and Bihar Sharif.

 Its a very organised racket and several gun dealers in the city are hand-in-glove with criminals from Bihar and Jharkhand. Their local contacts arrange their stay here and also act as middlemen in the deals. They get hefty commissions, an officer of the anti-rowdy section of the detective department said.

 Three persons from Bihar were arrested from a hideout in Metiabruz in January this year and a large cache of arms was seized from them. All the arms were made in Munger and Bihar Sharif. The pistols were very sophisticated. Usually, local pistols are not made of such good metal, Singh said.

 During interrogation, the trio had confessed to having sold arms to criminals in the city. 

 They were from remote villages in Munger and Nawada districts. The local police stations are about 50 km away from the villages and this allows the racket to thrive, the officer said.

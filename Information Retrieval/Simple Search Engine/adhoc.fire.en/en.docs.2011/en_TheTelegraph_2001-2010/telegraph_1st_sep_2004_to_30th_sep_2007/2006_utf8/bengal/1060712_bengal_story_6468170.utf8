The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Land acquisition row

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, July 11: Agriculture minister Naren De today said in the Assembly that farmland cannot be used indiscriminately for setting up industrial units.

 Industries cannot be set up on all sorts of land as that can hamper agricultural production. Indiscriminate use of land will ultimately affect production, De said during the debate on the agriculture budget.

 He had earlier echoed land and land reforms minister Abdur Rezzak Mollahs apprehension about Bengals ability to sustain its food security if farmland was acquired at the present rate.

 De, a Forward Bloc leader, said fallow land should be identified and used for industrial projects. This should be our priority No. 1. According to the minister, single-crop land can be used for industrial purposes only if fallow land is unavailable. 

 In an obvious reference to senior CPM leaders argument that industries cannot be set up in the sky, Des party colleague Haripada Biswas said farming, too, was not possible in the sky.

 The CPI and the Forward Bloc had yesterday demanded a white paper on land acquisition from the chief minister.

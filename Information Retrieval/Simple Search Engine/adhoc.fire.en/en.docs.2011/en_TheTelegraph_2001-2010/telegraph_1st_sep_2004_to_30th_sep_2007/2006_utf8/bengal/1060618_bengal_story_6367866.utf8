 Womens quota on CM cards

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, June 17: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today said his government was exploring the possibility of introducing a job quota for women in panchayat-run primary schools.

 Whatever people say, I believe that women always make good teachers, Bhattacharjee (in picture) told a meeting organised by the Paschimbanga Ganatantrik Mahila Samity, the CPMs womens wing.

 Of the 68,000 primary schools in the state, 14,000 are run by panchayats, the chief minister said. More and more women need to become teachers as that would help produce a talented generation.

 Not just teaching, women should look at other professions as well, he said. I must say that women who do not earn dont get the respect a working woman commands. So please do something for a living.

 The chief minister then turned his attention to the plight of those living below the poverty line. 

 More than 4,000 villages have been identified as very poor. I urge the Paschimbanga Ganatantrik Mahila Samity to visit the poor families, look into their problems and extend support to them. 

 The government, he said, would provide all possible social and economic help.

 Earlier in the day, the CPM state committee began its two-day meeting at the Alimuddin Street headquarters, where it discussed the Assembly poll results. 

 The chief minister said a review was necessary to ascertain why the party had fared badly in some districts. Jyoti Basu and CPM state secretary Biman Bose were present at the meeting.

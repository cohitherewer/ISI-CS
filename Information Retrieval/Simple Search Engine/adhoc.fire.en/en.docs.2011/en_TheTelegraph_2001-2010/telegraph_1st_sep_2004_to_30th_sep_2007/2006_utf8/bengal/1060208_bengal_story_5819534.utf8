 Teen rapes amp; kills 5-yr-old

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Suri, Feb. 7: A five-year-old girl was allegedly raped and murdered by a 13-year-old boy in Birbhum last evening.

 The boy was arrested today after angry villagers blocked the Suri-Baliharipur road this morning demanding his arrest.

 Meghas body was found in a farmhouse on the outskirts of Jinderpur village in the Mohammad Bazar area, about 270 km from Calcutta. Police said the girl was last seen with the boy yesterday afternoon in the village.

 Both the boy and the girl are from farmer families and the only child of their parents.

 A police official said enquiry of villagers revealed that the boy had asked Megha to go with him to pick plums around 3.30 yesterday afternoon. The boy is a neighbour and Megha knew him from childhood. So, she readily agreed. But her parents began to worry when she did not return after sunset.

 Meghas father Rabindranath Mondal, along with some villagers, launched a search for the girl. They also went to the boys house but did not find him there. Suspecting foul play, they abused his father, when he could not tell where the boy was.

 When a villager spotted Meghas skirt lying near the farmhouse, he called other villagers, who were able to trace her body.

 Clad only in a blouse, it lay on a haystack in the farmhouse, a brick placed on the stomach to prevent it from rolling over.

 A closer look revealed a nylon rope around her neck and bloodstains on the lower part of her body.

 The villagers called in the police, who brought down the body from the haystack.

 I cant believe that a boy who grew up in the village can commit such a heinous crime. How will I live the rest of my life without Megha? said a tearful Rabindranath.

 We arrested the boy from his maternal uncles house in neighbouring Rashidpur. We have charged him with rape and murder. We have also received some evidence from the spot which will help us solve the case, said Birbhum additional superintendent of police Swapan Kumar Maity.

 Circumstantial evidence shows the girl was strangled to death after being raped. However, we will get more details after the post-mortem, said a police officer investigating the case.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Stay away from farms, CPI tells investors

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, July 16: CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan today opposed the foray of private investors into agri-business, for which Mukesh Ambanis Reliance Industries is in talks with Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees government. 

 The Left is opposed to foreign direct investment in retail business to save the interests of thousands of retail businessmen. On the same ground, we have objections to the entry of Indian monopoly houses like the Ambanis in agri-business, said Bardhan, who was in the city today. 

 The Ambanis have recently declared that they would invest Rs 25,000 crore in agri-business and set up a retail chain across the country. We want them to keep their hands off agriculture.... They are doing well in industries and oil and let them stick to it. 

 Asked whether his party was opposed to the governments initiatives to facilitate Mukesh Ambanis agri-business in Bengal, Bardhan said: I am not a person who opposes something in Haryana and supports it in West Bengal. 

 Ambani met the chief minister last month to discuss his Rs 2,000-crore agri-business and retail project, which includes 60 outlets or hypermarkets or supermarkets to sell farm products. Reliance will advance credit to farmers, offer new technologies and modern implements and ensure their market. It is still not clear whether the farmers would have to enter into a contract with the company for the buy-back.

 Bardhan also opposed the chief ministers view that investors should be allowed to choose where they want to set up shop. Not the Salims, Tatas or Ambanis, but the state government must decide on which land industries should come up, he said and like the Opposition Trinamul Congress, added: We want industries on the land of sick and closed mills and barren or uncultivable land.

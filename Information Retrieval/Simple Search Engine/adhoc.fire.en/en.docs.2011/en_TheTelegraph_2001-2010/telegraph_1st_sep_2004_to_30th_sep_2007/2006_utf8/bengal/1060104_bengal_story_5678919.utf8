 EC eye on campaign wheels

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 3: The Election Commission has now trained its guns on vehicles ? from the soaring chopper to the slight-built two-wheeler ? used by political parties during polls.

 In a directive issued on December 29, the poll panel sought details of all vehicles used during campaigning.

 Although the commission keeps tab on vehicles used during every election, this is the first time it is keeping note of two-wheelers. Political parties will have to inform the district election officers beforehand the number of vehicles they will use. If more vehicles are used, they will be seized, chief electoral officer Debashish Sen said today. The directive will come into effect from the date of notification of elections and will be valid till the end of the election process. 

 Two-wheelers are the preferred mode of transport for all political parties while campaigning in rural areas. 

 During the 2004 general elections, the commission had banned the use of two-wheelers on polling day.

 Parties hiring helicopters and private aircraft during campaigns will have to notify the chief electoral officer in advance. The parties will have to state which company they are hiring the aircraft from, how many sorties it will be deployed in, the persons boarding it, the area covered and the charge. Within three days of the use of the aircraft/chopper, the parties will have to detail how the machine was used, Sen said. The hiring charges will be taken into account while computing the election expenses of the party.

 A government official said this is the first time that the poll panel has sought such details on the use of aircraft.

 Unlike many other states, Bengal does not have a tradition of politicians using aircraft for campaigning. 

 An official said the only exception was chief minister Jyoti Basu, who, at times, campaigned in a hired helicopter. 

 The parties will also have to declare within seven days of the notification of the election whether they will use commercial aircraft for campaigning.

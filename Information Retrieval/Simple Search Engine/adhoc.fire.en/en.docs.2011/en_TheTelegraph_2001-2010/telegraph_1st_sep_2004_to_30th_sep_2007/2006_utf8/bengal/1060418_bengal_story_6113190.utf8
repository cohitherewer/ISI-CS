The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Complaint cassette plays again

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, April 17: After an-other poll day, the CPM was gloating and the Trinamul Congress was glum ? like the voter turnout, nothing unusual about it. 

 State CPM secretary Biman Bose said the Left Front would increase its tally in Purulia, Bankura and West Midnapore.

 The Trinamul leadership refused to comment, but demanded repolling in Keshpur, where over 90 per cent of the voters exercised their franchise in some booths. 

 Bose, also the front chairman, said the Election Commission should take lessons from the manner in which the first phase of polls went. 

 Without naming the Maoists, he congratulated voters for braving their boycott call and threats. The turnout in the three districts was about 70 per cent.

 Bose, however, would not put a figure on the number of seats the front expected to win. 

 He only said the tally would better the one in 2001. In the last Assembly elections, the front had won 9 of the 11 seats in Purulia, 12 of the 13 in Bankura and 18 of the 21 in West Midnapore. 

 Asked if the figure would cross 40, he said: I wouldnt go into figures. But there is no question of a minus. Well have plus figures in all three districts.

 Trinamul general secretary Mukul Roy said the party would wait and watch before commenting on the election. But he was sure that Keshpur ? the West Midnapore seat that was the scene of bloody political clashes between 1998 and 2001 ? called for a fresh election.

 How can there be 90-92 per cent polling in some booths? It means that the Opposition did not get a level-playing field, Roy said.

 The CPM leader declined comment on the exceptionally high turnout in some places. 

 On Saturday, Bose had called on people to vote in large numbers to prove to the poll panel that this was the norm in Bengal.

 The observer for Indus in Bankura had allegedly asked voters how much money and liquor they had got from the CPM after having found that Opposition polling agents were missing from booths. Are we expected to supply polling agents to the Opposition? Bose asked.

 The Congress said it was expecting a better result than in 2001.

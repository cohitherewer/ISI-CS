The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Stung Kanti cries foul

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Midnapore, Feb. 25: Denied a ticket for the Assembly elections, school education minister Kanti Biswas lashed out at the CPM leadership today. 

 I served as education minister not because of the mercy of the party. Instead, I remained education minister because I was fated to do so. Of course, we communists do not believe in fate, Biswas said at the inauguration of a higher secondary school run by the Haldia municipality. 

 Apart from Biswas, higher education minister Satyasadhan Chakraborty and three other education ministers ? Iva Dey, Nanda Rani Dal and Nemai Mal ? were given the cold shoulder by the Alimuddin Street mandarins.

 Biswas today hailed the spread of womens education in the state. Even human resource development minister Arjun Singh had words of praise for Bengal, he said. 

 But he was quick to add that neither chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee nor his predecessor Jyoti Basu could claim credit for this as the person responsible for setting up 46 schools was the great Vidyasagar.

 Last week, Biswas had said that the five education ministers were dropped not for poor performance but because the party wants us for organisational work.

 CPM insiders, however, had a different story. They said the chief minister, who has on several occasions expressed disappointment at the state of education in Bengal, was unhappy with the functioning of the ministers.

 Bhattacharjee had ticked off Chakraborty at a cabinet meeting last year for not introducing job-oriented subjects, while the CPM-led teachers lobby reportedly complained to the chief minister and the party leadership about Biswass style of functioning.

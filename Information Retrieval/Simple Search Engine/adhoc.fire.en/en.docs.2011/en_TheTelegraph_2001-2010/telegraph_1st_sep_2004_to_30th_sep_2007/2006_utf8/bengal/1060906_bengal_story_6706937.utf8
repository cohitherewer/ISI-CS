The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Teachers turn beggars

 A contract teacher of Jalpaiguri Government Engineering College begs on Teachers Day demanding regularisation of his job. 

 Many such teachers sought alms on the campus. 

 Contract teachers and technical staff at six government engineering colleges across the state have been on an indefinite strike since September 1.

 We intend to tell people the plight of teachers like us on a day the government tells people how it felicitates teachers, said Diptesh Chakrobarty, their leader. 

 He alleged that they had been getting the same salary (Rs 12,000) for seven years despite working as much as whole-timers. Telegraph picture

 Nirupam recce for SEZs

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Midnapore, Nov. 2: Industries minister Nirupam Sen today visited West Midnapore to look for land required for two special economic zones (SEZs) in the district.

 Sen undertook the four-hour trip to Kharagpur, Guptamani and Salboni, accompanied by industries secretary Sabyasachi Sen and West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation officials.

 After the trip, the minister said 2,750 acres would be required for the two SEZs. I visited the three places to identify land on which the SEZs would be set up. Of the total land required, 2,500 acres would be needed for one SEZ where steel and other manufacturing units will be set up. An automobile component plant would be established at the other. However, I cannot talk about the investment figures as the companies havent yet finalised their project plans, Sen said.

 Videocon will set up infrastructure for the 2,500-acre zone while Srei Infrastructure will do the same for the other, he added.

 The industries minister said IIT Kharagpur has been entrusted with planning a biotechnology park in Kharagpur for which about 400 acres would be required. The government has already decided to build an information technology park there with the IITs assistance.

 Sen also inspected land in Salbonis Jamberia area for an iron and steel plant that the Jindals have decided to set up. 

 The Jindal Group requires 5,500 acres and is expected to invest Rs 10,000 crore for the project which is likely to create direct and indirect employment for about 20,000 people.

 Initially, the Jindals had settled for land in Guptamani but air force authorities raised objections that smoke billowing out of the 250-metre-high chimneys that would come up as part of the project would hamper their work.

 We decided to identify alternative land for them in Salboni and are satisfied with the new location. Now, its for them to decide, Sen said.

 Sen said people losing one- and two-crop land following acquisition of six mouzas in Kharagpur would be trained for alternative means of employment. 

 They will be trained and made fit to get jobs. As for the 27 Lodha families who will be affected, alternatives will be worked out.

 According to Sen, several plots of abandoned defence land have been identified in various parts of the state which can be used for setting up industries. 

 We are discussing the matter with defence officials, he said.

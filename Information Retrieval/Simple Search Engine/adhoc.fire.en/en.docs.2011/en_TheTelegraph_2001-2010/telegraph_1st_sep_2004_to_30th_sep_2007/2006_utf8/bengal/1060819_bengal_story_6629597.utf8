The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 CPI seeks cola ban

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Aug. 18: The CPI today demanded a Kerala-like ban on soft drinks in Bengal.

 Producing a copy of Keralas order, Bengal CPI secretary Manju Kumar Majumdar told a news conference that the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government should do the same.

 The chief minister had earlier said there was no point in individual states banning the drinks and that the Centre had to take a final decision. The CPM brass backed him. 

 However, veteran CPI leader and water resources investigation minister Nandagopal Bhattacharya said his department had found pesticides in cola samples. Should we ask people to drink poison in the name of wooing investors? asked Majumdar.

 CPM leader Benoy Konar reiterated today that Bengal would not follow Kerala. Appropriate action would be taken only after reports of all tests arrive. The livelihood of thousands depend on bottling and marketing of the drinks.

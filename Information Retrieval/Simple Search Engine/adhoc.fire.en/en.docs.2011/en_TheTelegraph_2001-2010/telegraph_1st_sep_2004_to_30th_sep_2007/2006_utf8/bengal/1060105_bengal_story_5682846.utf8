 Woman walks free after 10 years

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 4: A woman accused of bludgeoning her husband to death has been acquitted ? 10 years after she filed an appeal in the high court.

 Seventy-year-old Kamala Bhuian, who was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1996 by a trial court, was today pronounced not guilty. 

 A division bench of Justices A.K. Basu and P.K. Deb observed that the trial court verdict was based on traditional conception, which means only circumstantial evidence was considered and not the motive.

 Moreover, the investigating agency did not inform the trial judge that the accused was being treated for insanity. The trial court had also made a mistake by not calling the daughter of the accused and the victim, who was the only witness to the alleged murder, for deposition, the bench observed.

 The judicial administration, too, came in for criticism for the delay in taking up Kamalas case.

 According to the case dairy ? filed on September 23, 1986 ? the upapradhan of the Pratapur gram panchayat in East Midnapore district had rushed to the house of Nitai Bhuian when he heard a cry. There, he saw the bloodied body of Nitai lying on the floor and his wife Kamala standing with an axe in her hand, the dairy says. 

 The upapradhan immediately lodged a dairy at the local police station and Kamala was arrested the same day. The post-mortem report has confirmed that Nitai was killed with an axe, the diary adds. 

 Three months later, Kamala was granted bail and the trial began in Tamluk court. On November 11, 1995, the court convicted Kamala and sentenced her to life in prison. 

 Kamala moved the high court in early 1996. Since then, her petition had been gathering dust. 

 Her advocate Sekhar Basu told the high court today that the investigating officer, despite knowing that Kamala was undergoing treatment for insanity, had brought her to book and forced her to face trial.

 Basu argued that both the investigating authority and the trial court had failed to prove the motive of the murder, on which Kamalas only daughter could have shed some light. But the trial court did not bother to call her to the witness box.

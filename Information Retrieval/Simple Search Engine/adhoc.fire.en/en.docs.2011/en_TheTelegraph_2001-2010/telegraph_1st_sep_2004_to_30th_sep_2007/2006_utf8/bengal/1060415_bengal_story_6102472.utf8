 EC watch

 Arambagh: The poll panel has picked Arambagh, which the CPM had won by a lakh votes in 2001 amid allegations of rigging, for special watch. 

 Chief electoral officer Debashis Sen said this on Friday after touring the subdivision with deputy election commissioner R. Balakrishnan. Weve received many complaints from the Trinamul Congress. Well probe them, Sen said.

 CPM MLA Binoy Dutta, who is again a candidate, said: We dont have an Opposition here. Were fighting the EC. 

 Sen and Balakrishnan met the poll observers for Hooghly and district officials. With another deputy election commissioner, Anand Kumar, Sen will head to Purulia, Bankura and West Midnapore on Saturday.

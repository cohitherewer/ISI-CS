 Calcutta, May 13: Barely 48 hours after Mohammad Sohrab was elected from Burrabazar, his 16-year-old son Shabbir Khan asked a policeman: Do you know who I am? 

 After hitting traffic constable Dulal Lala at Chowringhee, Khan, who was riding a motorcycle with two others on the pillion ? without a helmet or papers ? tried to flee, police said. 

 When the police were about to tow it away, he shouted at a sergeant: Tum jaante ho main kaun hoon? Main MLA ka beta (Do you know who I am? Im the son of an MLA).

 But we seized the vehicle because the riders had no papers. Besides, they had entered a no-entry zone, said Jawed Shamim, the deputy commissioner of police, traffic.

 Sohrab, the lone MLA from Lalu Prasads party, the Rashtriya Janata Dal, in Bengal, said: I feel ashamed.

 Around 10.45 am, Khan hit Lala and took a turn into Park Street. As sergeant Gokul Burman was about to intercept them after a chase, the three ran away leaving the motorcycle behind, an officer said. 

 They came back when the police were about to get the vehicle towed away.

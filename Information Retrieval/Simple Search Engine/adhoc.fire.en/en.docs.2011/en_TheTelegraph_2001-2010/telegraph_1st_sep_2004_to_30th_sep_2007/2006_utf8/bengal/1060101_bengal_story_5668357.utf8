 Mamata meets Cong chief

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Dec. 31: Mamata Banerjee tonight held a one-to-one meeting with state Congress president Pranab Mukherjee at a house on Southern Avenue on the possibilities of forging a pact against the Left Front in the Assembly elections.

 The meeting started around 9.40 pm and lasted around an hour. 

 Mukherjee said he would inform his partys high command about what transpired at the meeting. We will hold more meetings if it is necessary, Mukherjee said. 

 Mamata said that an attempt is under way to bring all anti-Left forces under one umbrella to defeat the CPM-led coalition in Bengal. Todays meeting with Mukherjee was part of that attempt, she added. 

 A senior Congress leader said it would be impossible for the party to go against its declared policy and forge a pact with Trinamul if Mamata does not sever her ties with the BJP. So far, Mamata has refused to distance herself from the BJP alliance.

 As far as the Congress is concerned, it cannot go into any kind of alliance with any party that has the BJP as an ally. So If Mamata continues to be a partner of the BJP-led NDA, an official electoral pact with the Congress is out of the question, the Congress leader said.

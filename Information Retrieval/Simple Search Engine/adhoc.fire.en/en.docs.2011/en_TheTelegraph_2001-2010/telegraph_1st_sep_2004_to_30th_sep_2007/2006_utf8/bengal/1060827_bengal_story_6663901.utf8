The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Road map for smooth traffic

 A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta, Aug 26: The state government has engaged four agencies with expertise in automatic signalling systems for conducting a detailed study on smooth traffic movement in the city.

 Two senior officers of the home (police) department have said this in their reports submitted before a division bench of Calcutta High Court yesterday.

 The reports, presented as affidavits, came in response to a directive of the division bench of Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurkar and Justice Nadira Patheriya asking the department to inform the court about its plans for improving the citys traffic system.

 On May 19 this year, the judges had rapped the government and the police after hearing a petition by Subhash Dutta seeking the courts intervention to improve the citys bad traffic management.

 The matter will again come up for hearing on September 1, when another set of reports is expected to be presented. 

 The affidavit submitted yesterday by A.G. Ghosh, joint secretary of the home (police) department, said four agencies have been entrusted with the work of conducting a detailed study on vehicular movement.

 It added that one of them has already given its report. Besides, the planning and traffic engineering directorate of the state transport department has undertaken detailed studies in this regard.

 The other affidavit was prepared by Basudev Das, assistant secretary in the home (police) department.

 The officers said Calcutta has merely 7 per cent road space. To cope with the burgeoning number of vehicles in the city, the concept of Area Traffic Control had been proposed. Under this, timers were installed at traffic signals that show a countdown to changing of lights, the reports said.

 Calcutta traffic police have installed 181 such automatic signals at major intersections.

 The government officials also told the court that the police have launched a programme to train traffic policemen in modern road management.

 Another public interest litigation was filed in the court seeking a directive to the government to introduce a subject in schools to raise awareness about road safety.

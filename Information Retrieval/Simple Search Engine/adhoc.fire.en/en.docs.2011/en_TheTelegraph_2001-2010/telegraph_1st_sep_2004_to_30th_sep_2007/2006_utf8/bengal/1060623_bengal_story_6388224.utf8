The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Maoists too fleet-footed for Bengal 

 - Ranchi aid key to crackdown: Buddha 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 22: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today said it was impossible for the state government to combat Maoists without assistance from the neighbouring Jharkhand. 

 Replying to a question in the Assembly from Opposition MLA Jyotipriya Mullick, the chief minister said a joint operation with Jharkhand police was the need of the hour. 

 The Maoist activists are coming to Bengal through Orissa and Jharkhand. After their strikes in Bengal, the guerrillas escape to Jharkhand, which makes it difficult for the state police to track them down. We cannot arrest them without assistance from Jharkhand police, Bhattacharjee said.

 Though our officers hold meetings from time to time with their Jharkhand counterparts, the guerrillas can only be arrested if joint operations are conducted regularly. 

 The chief minister, however, did not mention whether he would take up the matter with his counterpart in Ranchi. I had a talk with the Andhra Pradesh chief minister when he invited me for breakfast during our party meeting in Hyderabad. The situation in Andhra is also bad and the talks between the government and the Maoists have not been fruitful. But Andhra is not our problem, we are anxious about Jharkhand where the Maoists are hiding, he said.

 Mullick, a Trinamul Congress MLA, asked him how many people had been killed by militants and what steps the government was taking to track them down.

 Bhattacharjee replied that the Maoists and members of the Kamtapur Liberation Organisation (KLO) had claimed 34 lives between January 1, 2004, and December 31, 2005. During that period 38 Maoists and 69 KLO activists were put behind bars.

 The Maoists have concentrated their subversive activities in four police station areas in Bankura, Purulia and West Midnapore districts while the KLO is active in Jalpaiguri and Cooch Behar. While on one hand, we are trying to check militant activity by stepping up security, on the other we have taken up development projects, he said.

 Bhattacharjee added that more policemen would be stationed in the Maoist-hit districts and they would be given sophisticated weapons. Woman personnel would also be deployed at all police stations.

 The Centre is giving assistance to procure arms and equipment, including landmine detectors. We have also taken measures to step up intelligence in these areas, the chief minister said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Give us roads and we will vote

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hasnabad, April 25: CPM cadre backing a vote boycott call in a ministers constituency? Tulsikumar Gayen chuckles as he tells the story.

 First roads, then votes ? thats what some residents of Rajendrapur had told CPM workers when they kicked off housing and public health engineering minister Gautam Debs campaign.

 It gave the party a scare, for this village and neighbouring Chapali had given Deb a margin of around 4,000 when he won the Hasnabad seat five years ago.

 CPM leaders realised they couldnt afford losing these votes to the Opposition ? a boycott was far more preferable. So they surreptitiously began lending support to the boycott call, Gayen said. But we saw through their game.

 Does that mean he would vote for Trinamuls Islam Rafiqul Mondal?

 I havent said so. Its a secret, Gayen said almost with a wink, adding that the episode, though funny in a way, was proof that the CPM realised it had done nothing for these villages some 95 km from Calcutta.

 More than the bad roads, its the arsenic in the water that is draining the lifeblood out of Rajendrapur, Neoradighi, Chapali and Dakshin Debipur, barely 3 km from the Bangladesh border.

 So six villages, with about 14,000 voters, had thought of a vote boycott. Even now, some feel that a boycott, though it will not change anything, will be a good way to register protest.

 Protest? snorted Iskinder Gazi. Our water is bad, our tube-wells are dry. Those who can afford it travel to Basirhat town to buy water.

 Arsenic-free tube-wells had been 

 sunk in Lashkarpur, Badamtala and Rojipur in the past few 

 years, each at about Rs 93,000. Almost all are now lying 

 defunct. Not one tube-well works in Rojipur. Piped 

 water is irregular. What is the minister doing? asked 

 Swapan Haldar, a sub-contractor with Taki municipality.

 Zahir Hossain of Jhinke has a water filter at home. But we still add drops of zeoline, he said. Hossain plans to send his children away to Calcutta because arsenic would become a menace in a few years.

 A few months ago, the residents of Rajendrapur and Neoradighi had gheraoed Rajendrapur village panchayat chief Ayub Ali. 

 He wasnt available for comment but CPM panchayat leader Anwar Ali said the polls prevented the government from starting projects. The remaining work will be done after our minister wins.

 The residents of Jhinke and Chandigori, Rajendrapur, Norli and Kharidanga have cried themselves hoarse asking that the only road connecting the villages be repaired. They now trudge through the 8-km stretch.

 Only a CPM-Congress pact can save the minister, said Bivas Roy at Hasnabad town.

 EC raps officials

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Feb. 16: The Election Commission (EC) today directed the state government to take action against 19 officials for irregularities in revision of electoral rolls.

 Those who have been ticked off include subdivisional officers (SDOs), block development officers (BDOs), a school headmaster, clerks and gram panchayat employees.

 The EC?s order came after observers, who toured the districts in two phases to oversee the revision of electoral rolls, submitted their reports. The EC sent a letter to chief electoral officer (CEO) Debashish Sen this evening directing the government to take action against the officials concerned with immediate effect.

 Sen said the action includes suspension, transfer and showcause. Several officers will be served showcause notices only.

 The CEO said with the action against 19 officials today, 24 persons have been punished so far on the charge of indulging in irregularities related to the revision of electoral rolls. In December last year, the EC had ordered action against five officers.

 Those who have been suspended with show cause notices include the BDO of Nayagram in West Midnapore, a primary school headmaster in Burdwan and a head clerk of the SDO?s office in the same district.

 Ten officials transferred with showcause notices include the SDO and the BDO of Haldia in East Midnapore and three BDOs of West Midnapore.

 The EC has also asked the government to take action against the SDOs of Salt Lake in Calcutta and Kumargunj in South Dinajpur. They have been charged with poor performance. They will be transferred but not served showcause notices.

 Sisters dead

 Behrampore, Jan. 3: Apparently unable to bear advances made by a private tutor and a classmate, Parbati Pal, 21, and her sister Rupali, 19, committed suicide last night.

 Residents of a village in Barwan, 260 km from Calcutta, Parbati was a second-year BA student at Kandi Raj College and her sister was in Class XII. 

 Murshidabad police chief N.K. Singh said a probe has begun on the basis of a note they are believed to have written jointly but refused to give details. 

 Neighbours who brought down the bodies today claimed that it detailed the abuse. The girls, who lost their father as infants, lived with the mother.

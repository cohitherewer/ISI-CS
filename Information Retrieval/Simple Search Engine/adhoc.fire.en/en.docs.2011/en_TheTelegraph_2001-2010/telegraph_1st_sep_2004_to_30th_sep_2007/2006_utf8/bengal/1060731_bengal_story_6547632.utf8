The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 A day after, some answers

 OUR BUREAU

 Bagmundi, July 30: Some of the mystery around Fridays trekking tragedy involving five Jadavpur University students began clearing up to- day with the two survivors providing more coherent answers.

 Bappaditya Chatterjee succeeded in explaining why his cell phone was functioning even after the soaking it should have received as he almost drowned in the river.

 I had kept it in an air-tight pouch which I wrapped in a towel and put in my rucksack, he told police.

 Why did he waste two hours before making his first call to a friend in Calcutta?

 Yes, I did take a little too long, but it wasnt two hours. It took me some time to decide what to do as I was feeling lost, Bappaditya said.

 Also, my handset devel- oped a low-battery problem and the balance in my pre-paid account was very low, too. During the first conversation with my friend, I was too nervous to explain the circumstances properly. The delay could be a result of all these factors.

 Kushal Biswas, the officer in charge of Bagmundi police station, suggested an explanation why Swati Dass body was found naked.

 When we went up to the river, we found the water level was almost three times the normal. Its possible the current tore the tracksuit bottoms and T-shirt off her body.

 Biswas also threw doubt on the villagers claim that they had seen Swati, Subhankar Saha (the other trekker confirmed dead) and Arundhati Ghosh (who is missing) come out of the water in wet clothes.

 We found that only a 12-year-old boy, Chhotua, claims to have seen the trio. He started the rumour. He may have seen a different group of people or simply made it up.

 Asked why the group hadnt sought the universitys permission for the trip, Bappaditya said: Permission is mandatory only for rock-climbing, not for trekking practice.

 Bappaditya also suggested an innocent reason why Subhankar may have lied to his family. He said he was going to Digha with his friends. Maybe because this was his first adventure trip, he feared his parents might object to it. I think thats why he lied.

 He said the reason they werent carrying trekking equipment was that they had meant to spend the night in a cave. No trekking equipment is required for this. Besides, another group of trekkers from JU was scheduled to reach Matha. We thought if we felt like trekking we could use their equipment.

 Bangla bullets kill Indians

 OUR BUREAU

 March 28: At least three people were killed and several injured when Bangladesh Rifles personnel opened fire on unarmed villagers repairing a road near the border in a Cooch Behar village this afternoon. 

 The arrival of a large contingent of the Border Security Force at Jamaldahabalapukuri ? around 70 km from Cooch Behar town ? two hours later did little to diffuse the simmering tension that has gripped the border hamlet in the Mekhliganj police station area. 

 Police said most residents have fled the area for fear of the BDR. 

 There were conflicting reports on the number of deaths as the police said three people were killed and the BSF said two.

 The villagers put the toll at three. Four people have been admitted to the district hospital in Jalpaiguri.

 The police said two unidentified persons died on the spot. The third, 50-year-old Mahammad Manglu, died at the Jalpaiguri hospital in the evening. 

 Mustafa Hussain, 18, Abdul Jabbar Ali, 65, Hamidul Islam, 28, and Jamilur Hussain, 25, have been admitted with bullet injuries.

 Cooch Behar superintendent of police Jagmohan said the injured were first taken to the Mekhliganj subdivisional hospital, 15 km from Jamaldahabalapukuri, and later shifted to Jalpaiguri. 

 Mekhliganj subdivisional officer Gurudas Sarkar said the body of Jasimuddin, 40, which was taken away by the BDR, will be handed over to the BSF tomorrow.

 Dhirendranath Roy, one of the men accompanying the injured to Jalpaiguri, said about 100 men were levelling a kutcha road along the border under the Sampurna Grameen Rozgar Yojna. 

 The work was being supervised by the Kuchlibari village panchayat (see map). Suddenly, the BDR asked the men to stop work. That was in the morning. The Bangladesh force had talks with the BSF and the work resumed again. 

 But in the afternoon, there was a change in shift and the new group of BDR personnel entered into an altercation with the workers. They beat them up with lathis and then suddenly started firing, Roy said. They fired on unarmed people.

 What worries us is that though a BSF outpost is located nearby, we feel insecure, Roy said. 

 S.S. Sandhu, an additional deputy inspector-general of the BSF, said from Siliguri the border force has registered its protest against the unprovoked firing. 

 We have already held a flag meeting with the BDR at the spot and deployed jawans so that the BDR does not cause any more problems for the villagers. Our men from Jhikabari reached the spot soon after the incident, Sandhu said. 

 The BSF officer said one person had died on the spot and the other is in hospital. 

 Jalpaiguri MP Minati Sen visited the injured in the hospital, where she met the shocked wife and son of Mohammad Manglu. Parliament is no longer in session, so I will write to the Union home minister about the heinous crime committed by the BDR, Sen said.

 Senior Cooch Behar officials visited the spot.

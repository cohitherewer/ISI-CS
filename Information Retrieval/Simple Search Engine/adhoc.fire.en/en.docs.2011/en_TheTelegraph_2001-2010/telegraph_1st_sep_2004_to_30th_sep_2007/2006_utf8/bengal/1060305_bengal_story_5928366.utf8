 Calcutta, March 4: A fortnight ago, a bomb exploded in front of the chief ministers Palm Avenue apartment. Today, a bullet went off from the pistol of a policeman posted at Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees doorstep.

 No one was injured this morning as the bullet hit the pavement. But the incident spread panic in the locality.

 A couple of weeks back, a group of local people gave chase to three youths who came to attack one of their rivals. While fleeing, the trio hurled a bomb in front of Bhattacharjees house. 

 Policemen guarding the high-security zone managed to arrest them.

 On hearing the gunshot, residents thought goons were in action again. Many of them rushed out. But the police cleared the confusion and drove them away. 

 Kartik Mandal, a Special Action Force constable, was adjusting his 9-mm pistol standing in front of the try-gate of the three-storey building on whose ground floor the chief minister lives with his wife and daughter when the bullet went off. 

 A bullet went off suddenly and hit the pavement, said N.R. Babu, the deputy commissioner of police, south division. 

 Fortunately, the nozzle of the gun was aimed at the road. Otherwise, the incident could have taken a serious turn, he added.

 An officer of the Karaya police station said Mandal found something wrong with his service firearm while examining it. One of the springs of the pistol was not working properly. So he started adjusting it on his own. 

 As the bullet went off, a terrified Mandal dropped the pistol on the road.

 His colleagues from the nearby outpost ? the unit that looks after the security of Bhattacharjees house ?rushed to him. They removed the loaded magazine from the pistol and took the constable to the police station.

 Senior officers questioned Mandal to find out what exactly happened.

 Mandal, an officer said, would have to face a departmental inquiry and explain why the bullet went off. He should have removed the magazine before examining the firearm. As he did not do that, he could be showcaused. 

 At least for the time being, he will not be deployed in front of the chief ministers house.

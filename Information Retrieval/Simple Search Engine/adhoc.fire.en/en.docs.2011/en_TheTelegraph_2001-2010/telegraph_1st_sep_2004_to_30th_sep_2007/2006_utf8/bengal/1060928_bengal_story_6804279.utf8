The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Centre proposes 4000 mw plant

 OUR BUREAU

 Maithon/Calcutta, Sept. 27: Union power minister Sushil Kumar Shinde today said Bengal could be included in the list of states where 4,000-mw ultra mega power stations were being built if the government made such a proposal.

 The plants will come up in eight states, including Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Orissa, Tamil Nadu and Chhattisgarh. Bengal can be on this list, if it submits a proposal. So far, we have not received any, said Shinde, who announced Jharkhands inclusion in the group of eight today.

 However, a Bengal power department official said that as a first step, there should have been a letter from the Union ministry asking the state whether it was interested in the project. This has been the procedure for all other states. 

 Officials in Calcutta also contended that there was no immediate need for a 4,000-mw plant as the state has its own projects lined up, which will produce about 2,570 mw by 2012. Two 1,000-mw plants are coming up at Katwa and Sa- gardighi. There will be a 500-mw capacity addition at Bakreswar and a 250-mw unit is be-ing built at Santaldih. So, we dont need the 4,000-mw project immediately, the official said.

 He admitted, though, that being left out now could prove costly in the future. If we indeed get a mega plant in our state, it will help us in the future, the official said.

 Shinde was at Maithon today to attend the ground-breaking ceremony for a 1,000-mw power plant in Madandih near Dhanbad.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Minister chasing corrupt babus

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 19: Land and land reforms department babus, who had earlier been hauled up by their own minister for shirking work, harassing people and thriving on bribes, might face the music again.

 Abdur Rezzak Mollah is planning a citizens charter as part of which display boards will be hung outside revenue inspector, block land revenue and subdivisional offices, mentioning the services available and by when they should be delivered.

 The fees charged for the services would also be on display along with the address of the authority with whom a complaint has to be lodged if the work is not done on time or without additional money.

 The complaint boxes, Mollah said, might be unlocked in the presence of common people to get their genuine feedback on his officials.

 The revenue inspectors office at the panchayat level receives applications for mutation, collects royalty (for leased land) and other taxes. A block land revenue office maintains records of land and all related levies.

 An official said the citizens charter will be introduced by September at all 3,500 revenue inspector, 341 block land revenue and 67 subdivisional offices in the state. 

 The notice boards will detail the functions the office is supposed to perform, the approximate time each task is likely to take and the fees chargeable, the minister said today. 

 Last year, he had declared in public that a majority of his departments officers were thieves who duped illiterate, hapless farmers and demanded bribes from them. 

 In his five years in the land and land reforms department, Mollah has transferred around 6,000 officers on charges of corruption to negligence or misconduct. 

 I have heard poor farmers say that some officers tore up his land settlement record or that his name was scratched off because he could not pay the bribe they demanded, Mollah said today. 

 Last year, the minister introduced a system of performance evaluation where all block-level officers were asked to submit reports on work in their areas. When their unions threatened an agitation, which would hamper revenue collection, Mollah said he was prepared to outsource collection of levies.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Shield for terror trio

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, March 7: As many as 60,000 central paramilitary personnel might be deployed in Purulia, Bankura and West Midnapore to ensure trouble-free elections.

 The Election Commission has asked the chief electoral officer to draw up a list of sensitive areas immediately. A poll panel team will scan that list and decide on the booths that are to be declared sensitive.

 The political history of a particular area, its geographical location and law and order would be taken into account to determine which areas should be branded sensitive. 

 The district administration and police will jointly un- dertake the exercise of identifying such areas. 

 About 600 companies of central forces will be deployed in the three Maoist strongholds that are going to polls together on April 17. In addition, there would be state forces. 

 Sen said: There is going to be a huge presence of central forces in Purulia, Bankura and West Midnapore. According to indications we have got from the Election Commission, about 600 companies are likely to be there. This is being done to dispel voters fears in the wake of the recent incidents of violence there.

 There are about 7,500 polling booths in the three districts. According to information provided by the district authorities, a good number of them should be on the sensitive list.

 The commission has sought daily reports on the states law and order. District magis-trates and superintendents of police would submit reports to the state home department, which will forward them to the chief electoral officer. 

 The commission has also called for a drive against illegal arms, their seizure and submission of a status report at the earliest. 

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee met chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb and home secretary Prasad Ranjan Ray at Writers Buildings this morning to discuss measures to ensure peaceful polls.

 In Maoist-infested West Midnapore, director-general of police Subhas Chandra Avasthy held a three-hour meeting with senior district police officers. 

 He later said: We have modern arms, ammunition and mine sweepers to take on the Maoists. But we have to improve our intelligence network.

 State CPM secretary Anil Biswas told a party meeting in East Midnapore today: What the newspapers are writing (on the Maoists growing influence in the three districts) are cooked-up stories.

 Insulted officer attempts suicide

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Behrampore, Feb. 12: The block development officer of Nabagram in Murshidabad attempted suicide last night after being allegedly humiliated by two of his younger superiors. 

 From the hospital bed, Sushil Kumar Pramanick said he consumed poison because he could not take the insult meted out to him by district magistrate N. Manjunatha Prasad and Lalbag subdivisional officer Abanindranath Singh yesterday.

 Prasad had convened a meeting of all BDOs at Sagardighi yesterday to discuss matters relating to the ongoing revision of electoral rolls. Pramanick, 57, did not attend the meeting on time.

 Around 10 last night, employees of the BDOs office ? about 230 km from Calcutta ? who are also his neighbours, saw Pramanick walking unsteadily in his quarters and vomiting on the floor. They rushed in to find him slipping into unconsciousness and frothing at the mouth.

 He was taken to Behrampore Sadar Hospital where his stomach was pumped and the pesticide taken out. Doctors said he is out of danger.

 Pramanick stayed alone in the quarters and his family ? wife and son ? lived in Behrampore town, about 200 km from Calcutta. His daughter has been married off.

 He claimed that no one had informed him about yesterdays meeting. The Lalbag SDO called me up around noon and insulted me over telephone. When I rushed to the meeting, the DM insulted me in front of every one and asked me to get out of the meeting. He also told me I would not get a car and have to walk back, he said. 

 I could not take the insult. I have had two strokes and am physically not very strong, the BDO pleaded.

 The 36-year-old district magistrate denied having insulted Pramanick. 

 I have not said anything insulting to Sushilbabu. He has not attended any meeting relating to development over the past six months. Whenever I seek a report from him, he is unable to give it to me. I work with 25 BDOs. Why should I go out of my way to insult one of them? Prasad asked.

 The subdivisional officer, Singh, who is around 30, said he had personally called up all BDOs on Friday evening to inform them about the meeting. He added: Every BDO turned up for the meeting except him. So I called him up and asked him to attend it. I dont understand how I have insulted him.

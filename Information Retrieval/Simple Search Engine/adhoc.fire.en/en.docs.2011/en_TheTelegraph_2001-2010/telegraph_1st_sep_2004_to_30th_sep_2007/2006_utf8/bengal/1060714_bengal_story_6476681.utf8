The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Sight on best deal from Salim

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 13: Commerce and industry secretary Sabyasachi Sen today indicated that the government would keep all options open to bag the best bargain from the deal with the Salim Group.

 Sen said the government is in no hurry to ink an agreement with the Indonesian company.

 The company would like to reach an agreement with us by July 30 but we will sign the agreement only after weve got the most comfortable bargain with them. It may take 10 to 15 days longer. The government has to be satisfied that its developmental requirements are being fulfilled, he said this evening.

 The group has offered to build a 100-km expressway connecting Barasat to Raichak and a 2-km bridge from Raichak to Kukrahati, and develop a 25,000-acre special economic zone (SEZ) in Haldia. 

 In return, the government is to give the company 5,000 acres for a township in Baruipur and space for knowledge and health cities in North 24-Parganas and 10 commercial complexes along the proposed expressway.

 A detailed project proposal was submitted by the companys officials to the commerce and industry department last evening.

 Sen said the government was keeping other options open in case the company failed to fulfil some of its commitments. The expressway is our priority. If the Salim Group doesnt build it, well ask the National Highway Authority of India to build it for us. Well soon start buying land for the road. As for Haldia, the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation will soon start buying the land for the SEZ.

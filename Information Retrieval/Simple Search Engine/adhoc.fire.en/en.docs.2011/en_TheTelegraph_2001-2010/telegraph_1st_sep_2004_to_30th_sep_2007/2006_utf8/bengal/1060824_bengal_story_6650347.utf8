The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 CPM worry over Citu base

 ANINDYA SENGUPTA

 Calcutta, Aug. 23: The 

 CPM brass have admitted in a document circulated among party 

 ranks their inability to expand base among working classes.

 Given the huge industrial 

 workforce in Bengal, our trade union base is extremely weak. 

 We have not been able to ex- pand it. Let us admit our fai-lures 

 and weaknesses, says the letter sent to the district 

 party units by state secretary Biman Bose.

 According to the party, a little 

 over 6 per cent of the workforce in the state is with Citu 

 some 13 lakh out of 1.85 crore workers in the organised 

 and unorganised sectors. 

 We must accept that we could 

 not make inroads into the massive pool of workers despite 

 being in power for nearly three decades, the letter 

 says. 

 According to a CPM survey, in 

 three districts close to Calcutta South 24-Parganas, Howrah 

 and Nadia less than 6 per cent of the workforce is Citu-affiliated. 

 In Calcutta itself, the figure is less than 4 per cent.

 The highest enrolment for the 

 trade union is in Jalpaiguri (12.51%) and the lowest in 

 Malda (1.83%). 

 Asked about the failure Bose has 

 drawn attention to, Citu president and CPM state secretariat 

 member Shyamal Chakraborty said: Yes, that is the 

 reality.

 The letter points out that the 

 party had failed to wean away 50 per cent of the people 

 who have been continuously voting against it. Generally, 

 there is a change of guard in every state after five years. 

 But in our state, 50 per cent of the people have allowed 

 us to stay in power for 29 years and this is a success. 

 But this has deflected our attention from the fact that 

 the remaining 50 per cent have always opposed us. 

 Many of those who still do not 

 vote for the party are poor, the document says. But 

 we have not been able to bring them into our fold.

 The CPM leadership has also been 

 critical of the manner in which the smaller party units 

 function. The zonal and local committees are blissfully 

 unaware of the number of industrial workers in their 

 areas, it says. Sections of these committees that oversee 

 trade union activities are not run by workers. So, 

 not only do they lack information, they do not have a general 

 idea even. 

 The party state committee has 

 stressed on the need to recruit whole-timers 

 who would be assigned the task of building unions among 

 organised and unorganised workers.

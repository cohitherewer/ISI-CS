The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Cops low and dry

 PRONAB MONDAL

 March 6: A ramshackle jeep takes a half-hour of pushing to get started every morning, and 8 litres of diesel.

 This is what policemen deployed in Maoist strongholds are provided on their mission to keep watch on 225 sq km of mountainous tracts and undulating roads cutting through dense forests.

 Struggling to combat Maoists with meagre supplies of fuel and incentives, the police force ? inspector downwards ? lacks the will to perform in the war zone.

 The state administration and our superiors might think that the allotment of diesel is enough for the task we are assigned, but achieving the target with such an arrangement is impossible, a sub-inspector of Bandwan in Purulia said.

 Another sub-inspector, of Belpahari police station in West Midnapore, said: You cant imagine the areas we have to patrol. We put our life at enormous risk by travelling through dense forests in a vehicle that is crumbling and capable of developing snags any moment.

 Special vehicles are used for special searches. When our bosses come, raids are conducted on Maruti Gypsys, Tata Sumos or new Mahin- dra MUVs. We have to depend on decades-old jeeps to travel on bumpy roads across hundreds of kilometres, a Lalgarh officer said.

 A senior Bankura officer said: The state should provide monetary allowances and a special insurance cover. We should make them feel that they are being taken care of for being engaged in a risky job. 

 The administrations attitude towards middle- and low-level policemen, a junior Binpur officer said, was responsible for the lack of will. 

 We get the same facilities that a sub-inspector of Bidhannagar or Lake Town police station in Calcutta enjoys. But their families do not suffer the same tension when they leave for work. 

 Even before a routine patrol, I dont know whether I will return alive or if my family will be informed of my death the next day. How can our superiors expect motivation? he asked.

 The government has replaced .303 rifles with semi-automatic rifles and carbines but more, it seems, needs to be done for the polices sagging morale.

 Western range inspector-general Banibrata Basu admitted that there were problems and said talks are on with the administration to sort them out.

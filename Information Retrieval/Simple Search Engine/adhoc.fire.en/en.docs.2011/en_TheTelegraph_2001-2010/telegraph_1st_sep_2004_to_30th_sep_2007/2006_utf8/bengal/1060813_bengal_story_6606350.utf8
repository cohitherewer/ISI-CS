The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Baggage leash on domestic flights

 - Long 

 queues at airport, underground gets more forces 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Delays in the air 

 Calcutta, Aug. 12: After 

 international flights, cabin baggage restrictions have been 

 clamped on domestic flights, too. 

 Passengers are not being allowed to carry any kind of liquid or gel inside the cabin, said K.N. Tripathi, the CISF commandant at Calcutta airport. Earlier, passengers would be allowed to carry two pieces of cabin luggage. But now it will be absolutely restricted to one.

 Like the international terminal, vigilance has been stepped up at the domestic terminal. We have increased deployment at the domestic terminal. Scanning of passengers handbags has been intensified as well, Tripathi said. 

 The stringent security measures today resulted in long queues. The lines are moving at a very slow pace, an official said. This is because the scanning is being done very carefully. If there is any suspicion, the bag is being scanned twice or thrice. 

 After the X-ray scan and the manual checks by CISF personnel, the baggage will have to go through another round of screening conducted by the security staff of various airlines.

 We have asked our own security personnel to heighten vigil. We are ensuring that no passenger carries more than one cabin baggage, an Air Sahara official said.

 Prescribed medicines are being allowed but not in liquid form unless verified as authentic. Passengers can carry contact lenses but no solution bottles. 

 Domestic flights have also banned deodorants, sprays, shaving gel and perfume. 

 We have never seen such stringent security at Calcutta airport earlier, an airport security employee said. 

 Even shoes are being taken off during checks, an official said. 

 Sources said the bomb detection and disposal squad is carrying out random checks of aircraft.

 Sniffer dogs, too, have been pressed into service.

 The security step-up is causing delays in the departure and arrival of flights, airport officials said. 

 Passengers had to wait for at least an hour in queues for getting security clearance. 

 Seema Devi, who arrived from Mumbai on an Air Sahara flight today, had to pay extra for her hand baggage. 

 They insisted that we should carry a transparent handbag. So we put it into the registered luggage and paid more for that, she said. 

 A senior airport official said: 

 The passengers are advised to travel light and come 

 to the airport at least two hours before the scheduled departure 

 of flight.

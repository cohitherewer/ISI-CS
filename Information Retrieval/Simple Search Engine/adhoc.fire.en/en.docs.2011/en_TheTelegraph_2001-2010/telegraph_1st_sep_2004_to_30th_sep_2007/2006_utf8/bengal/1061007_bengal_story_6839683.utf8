The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Fight against bandh on war footing

 Calcutta, Oct. 6: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees government is making elaborate arrangements to foil the October 9 bandh.

 Director-general of police A.B. Vohra and inspector-general (law and order) Raj Kanojia held an hour-long meeting with south Bengal superintendents of police today to discuss the level of preparedness.

 Additional forces would be deployed to counter the bandh, said Kanojia. Besides Calcutta, the areas in focus would be the industrial towns of Asansol and Kharagpur.

 Talks are on with the railways to keep trains in the Howrah, Sealdah and Kharagpur sections running. Weve sought deployment of additional railway police personnel to keep services smooth. Well not spare trouble makers, Kanojia said after the meeting.

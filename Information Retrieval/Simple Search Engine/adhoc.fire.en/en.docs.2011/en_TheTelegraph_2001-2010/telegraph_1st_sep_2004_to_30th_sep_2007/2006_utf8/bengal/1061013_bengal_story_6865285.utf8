 Tiger takes woman away

 Calcutta, Oct. 12: A woman was dragged away by a tiger as she was fishing for crabs on the shores of Kendo island in the Sunderbans this morning.

 Malati Bhakta, 32, is a resident of Dwarakpur in the Patharpratima area of South 24-Parganas.

 One of Malatis companions, Ramesh Bhakta, tried to hit the tiger with a bamboo pole, but the animal lunged at his neck before running away with the woman into the forest, police said. A seriously injured Ramesh was taken to a primary health centre.

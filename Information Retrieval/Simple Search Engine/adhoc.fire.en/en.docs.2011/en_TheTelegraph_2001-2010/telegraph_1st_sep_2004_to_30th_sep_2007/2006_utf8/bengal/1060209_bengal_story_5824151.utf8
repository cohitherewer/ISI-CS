 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta/ Chinsurah, Feb. 8: State chief electoral officer (CEO) Debashish Sen today said the electoral rolls could be updated with inclusion and deletion of names even after publication of the revised voter list on February 22.

 He said a communique from the Election Commission reached the CEOs office today, saying the process could continue till a week before filing of nominations. The EC will monitor the process every week to ensure further inclusion and deletion of names of voters.

 Sen said 92 per cent of the electorate in the state has already been recorded in the voter list. Eight per cent, which comes to 35 lakh voters, could be enrolled after the publication of revised rolls on February 22, he added.

 He said all 19 observers, who were in the districts to strike off bogus voters from the electoral rolls, would return to Delhi by tomorrow and hold a meeting on February 10.

 In another development, seven Bangladeshis, whose names figured in the voter list, were arrested in Hooghly on a directive from observer N. Sivasailan, now touring the district to verify electoral rolls.

 Officials said the arrests were made after Balagarh block development officer Haripada Ghosh submitted a list of 20 Bangladeshis to police following complaints from Congress and Trinamul Congress leaders.

 N. De, the officer-in-charge of Balagarh police station, said five were arrested from Inchura village and two from Jeerat on the charge of illegally staying in the country for over two years after their visas expired.

 Sen said an all-party meeting has been convened in New Delhi on February 15 to discuss state funding of elections. Representatives of political parties have been informed.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Tech college

 Calcutta, Jan. 9: The West Bengal University of Technology today asked private engineering colleges across the state to start their new semester from January 16 instead of 12.

 The university said only 30 per cent of the answer scripts of the semester exams held in December have been checked so far and it needs the teachers for a longer period. The results are likely to be declared in the first week of February.

 Girl molested amp; mom beaten but still no FIR 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bethuadahari, Dec. 12: A group of youths first teased and molested a 14-year-old girl here in Nadia and then kicked and beat up her pregnant mother. She had a miscarriage. 

 Unable to take the humiliation, Tumpa Roy (name changed) took her mothers sleeping pills. Both mother and daughter were hospitalised on December 1.

 When Tumpas father Partha went to lodge a complaint with the local Nakashipara police station, he was turned away. He prayed for justice in court after his wife and daughter were released from hospital three days ago.

 The police needed the courts rap to spring to life. A case was started last night and one of the accused held immediately.

 We have arrested Raju Dutta, the son of an affluent trader, and have launched a search for the others, Nadia superintendent of police Ajay Nand said today.

 Asked why the Nakashipara police station refused to register Parthas complaint, officer-in-charge Pintu Saha pleaded ignorance. I was on leave and am not fully aware of what happened in my absence. I am inquiring into it.

 Partha said that the officer on duty had asked him to settle the matter amicably with the boys who killed his unborn child and almost drove his daughter to death. 

 The district police chief has sought a report from the Nakshipara officers.

 In the early evening of December 1, Tumpa was returning home at Bethuadahari, about 200 km from Calcutta from private tuition when the youths surrounded her. 

 The Class VIII student was harassed in daylight and on a busy road, but no one came forward to help.

 On returning home, she told her mother how she was molested in public. 

 Mamata, eight months pregnant, rushed out, disregarding her health. 

 They surrounded me and started beating me up. I fell to the ground and Raju kicked me in my abdomen, the mother said. 

 With the help of some local residents, Mamata managed to return home and broke down before her daughter.

 Partha, who owns a large stationery store, came back from work and took Mamata to Bethudahari Hospital, where doctors told him that his wife had a miscarriage. 

 When he returned home, he found Tumpa had consumed the sleeping pills, un- able to bear the shock of her mothers humiliation. She was taken to the same hospital and then shifted to Shaktinagar District Hospital. 

 Partha said: My wife was in very delicate health after the miscarriage. But the police insulted me and my family with their attitude. I had to move court.

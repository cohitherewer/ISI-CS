 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, July 11: Congress chief whip Asit Mals mobile phone was confiscated by the Speaker today after it kept ringing inside the Assembly in the MLAs absence. 

 Mal would have to pay a fine of Rs 2,000 to get his phone back. Using mobile phones in the House is banned, but Speaker H.A. Halim regretted that repeated warnings against their use have been ineffective. Former law minister Nisith Adhikary was earlier held using one.

 Calcutta: Thousands of passengers were stranded at Sealdah station on Tuesday evening after many trains on both north and south sections were cancelled or delayed following heavy rain. The last local train, scheduled to leave the station at 11.30 pm, left at 12.30 am on Wednesday.

 Calcutta: The Congress has retained Raiganj and Pujali municipalities in Malda and South 24-Parganas. Out of 53 municipal wards that went to polls on July 9, the Congress won in 33 and the Left Front in 16. Mamata Banerjees Trinamul Congress drew a blank.

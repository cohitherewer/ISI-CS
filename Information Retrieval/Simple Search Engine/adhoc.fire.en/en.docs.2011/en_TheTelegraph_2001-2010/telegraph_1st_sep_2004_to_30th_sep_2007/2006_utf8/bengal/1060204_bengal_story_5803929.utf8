The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Mamata heat on Cong

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Feb. 3: In a bid to pressure the Congress into seat sharing for the Assembly elections, Mamata Banerjee has convened a meeting of her partys working committee on Sunday to discuss the names of her nominees. 

 We are still looking forward to having an electoral understanding with the Congress. But we cannot wait for years. We shall begin choosing our candidates for nearly 200 seats from Sunday, Mamata told key Trinamul Congress functionaries this afternoon.

 A fortnight later, Margaret Alva, the AICC general secretary in charge of Bengal affairs, is likely to meet Mamata to discuss possible seat adjustments. 

 She has been assigned the job of initiating the talks by Congress president Sonia Gandhi after defence minister and state party chief Pranab Mukherjee failed to break the ice in two meetings ? on December 31 and January 28. 

 Caught unawares, Congress leaders such as MP Adhir Chowdhury and MLAs Shankar Singh and Abdul Mannan today called on information and broadcasting minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi at his south Calcutta residence.

 Das Munshi was not available for comment, but those who went to meet him later said they requested the Union minister to expedite Alvas one-to-one with Mamata. 

 Mamata should wait a few more days before selecting her nominees as Alva is scheduled to call on her. We are still optimistic about an alliance with Trinamul as only a combined Opposition can ensure the CPMs defeat, Singh said.

 Trinamul general secretary Mukul Roy called upon the Congress to decide on the alliance at the earliest. The time is ripe for the Congress to take a decision. The selection of our nominees has to be completed by February-end.

 Trinamul sources said Krishna Bose, who won the Jadavpur Lok Sabha seat in 1998 and 1999, might be fielded against chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee in the Jadavpur Assembly segment.

 Bose had lost to the CPMs Sujan Chakraborty in the 2004 general elections. In the 2001 Assembly elections, Trinamul nominee actor Madhabi Mukherjee lost to Bhattacharjee by 31,000 votes.

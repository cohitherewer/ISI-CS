The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Listless march

 KINSUK BASU AND UTTAM DUTTA

 Baidyabati (Hooghly), Dec. 7: Some 1,200-odd supporters, a rickshaw with a loudspeaker atop a bamboo pole, a few women activists holding a banner and a handful of leaders. That, in short, was the Trinamul Congresss show of protest on Thursday.

 The police didnt have to do much. Having walked a few yards from Baidyabati Choumatha, about 40 km from Calcutta, in the run-up to Singur chalo (march to Singur), the Trinamul Congress supporters didnt go into any confrontation with the men in uniform.

 On the road connecting GT Road and Dirghangi More on Delhi Road, the supporters gave up in front of a police barricade and later squatted on the road for a two-and-a-half-hour demonstration attacking the Left Front for its land acquisition policy on Singur.

 Around 4.35 pm, some two-and-a-half hours after the march began, the curtains came down 14 km from Singur as the police arrested the Trinamul supporters and released them immediately.

 In Singur, Krishi Jami Bachao Committee supporters continued their protest. Across parts of Gopalnagar, Khasherbheri, Beraberi and Bajemelia, a section of villagers began an indefinite fast.

 Mamata steers clear

 Calcutta, Jan. 1: Mamata Banerjee tonight described as baseless charges that the Trinamul Congress was linked to the Purulia killings. 

 The Maoists had left behind posters saying the murders were a revenge for the Chhoto Angaria massacre. 

 In the West Midnapore incident, 11 Trinamul supporters were allegedly killed by CPM cadre in January 2001. 

 State CPM secretary Anil Biswas said this afternoon: If those killed in Chhoto Angaria were Trinamul supporters, why should the Maoists take revenge? This proves the nexus between the two outfits.

 Mamata said yesterdays murders were a fallout of the CPMs own internal conflicts.

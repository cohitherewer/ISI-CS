 Kalyani medical college on plan paper

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 5: The government is drawing up a proposal for a medical college in Kalyani. 

 Director of medical education Jayasree Mitra told a doctors conclave in the city today that while the proposal was being drawn up for Kalyani, the health ministry was mulling another medical college in Malda. 

 We have carried out an inspection at Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Hospital in Kalyani and we find it suitable for a medical college, Mitra said at the Association of Health Services Doctors conference at Chittaranjan National Medical College. 

 A detailed proposal, along with the cost of setting up the college in Nadias Kalyani is being worked out. We plan to have 100 undergraduate seats there, Mitra said.

 Last week, health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra and a team of senior health officials had visited the hospital, about 60 km from the city. 

 Mitra said: The 550-bed hospital will be converted into a medical college. For a medical college, at least 25 acres is required and the hospital has more than that.

 Mitra added that the main concern was getting good teachers for the proposed college.

 There are nine medical colleges across the state with 1,150 undergraduate seats. Five of them are in Calcutta and the rest in Midnapore, Burdwan, Bankura and Jalpaiguri. 

 During the two-day conference that ended today, doctors criticised the government for lack of infrastructure in hos-pitals. There is an urgent need to improve facilities in block and primary health centres and state-run hospitals. We have demanded an overall improvement of infrastructure, said Gautam Mukherjee the state general secretary of the Association of Health Services Doctors. 

 Mishra, who also attended the meet, said there was a serious shortage of funds to improve the condition of hospitals and health centres. We should get money from the World Bank, the CPM minister said. 

 He also claimed that the situation has improved over the past year. The hospitals now handle more pathological tests and delivery cases.

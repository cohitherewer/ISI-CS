 Recruit right to church schools 

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 Calcutta, Aug. 5: The state government has reverted to the system of allowing Christian missionary-run state-aided primary schools to recruit their own teachers.

 In the last four years, the government had gradually taken away recruitment powers from these schools, making it mandatory for them to recruit teachers through the state-controlled District Primary School Councils (DPSC).

 But as our main objective is to ensure quality education in every school, we have decided to offer this relaxation to minority schools, said Sulapani Bhattacharya, the president of the West Bengal Board of Primary Education.

 The decision is significant as only last month, the government had withdrawn the West Bengal School Service Commission Act (Amendment) Bill, 2006. This bill, if enacted, would have made it mandatory for state-aided Christian missionary schools to recruit secondary and higher secondary teachers and headmasters through the School Service Commission. 

 The government also recently issued an order allowing eight state-aided missionary schools in South 24-Parganas to recruit teachers on their own, reversing a four-year-old stand.

 Once these eight schools complete their process of recruiting teachers, all the remaining Christian missionary-run state-funded primary schools all over Bengal will be gradually allowed to follow the same system, an official of the school education department said. 

 Organisations representing various churches are undoubtedly happy about the decision. We are happy that the government has conceded to our demand and given back the powers to the church controlled schools to recruit teachers of their choice, said Herod Mullick, the general secretary of the Bangiya Christiya Pariseba, which comprises representatives of churches in the state.

 The Bangiya Christiya Pariseba had organised a movement across the state protesting the governments decision to force them to take teachers through the primary school councils. 

 Father Faustine Brank, a Roman Catholic priest in South 24-Parganas, said missionary schools followed certain traditions to impart holistic education. 

 We think that it is possible to go along with our ideals in our schools only if we are allowed to function independently, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Paramilitary to stay on

 OUR BUREAU

 Krishnagar/Calcutta, April 20: The Election Commission has asked the government to act in time to prevent post-poll violence. 

 The commission has also recommended that the government retain the paramilitary deployed in the state for a few days even after the polls. 

 Chief election commissioner B.B. Tandon has spoken to chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb and told him what the panel wants. 

 Deputy election commissioner Anand Kumar said in Nadia today that the state has accepted the proposal.

 Some companies of central forces have been retained in Maoist-hit West Midnapore, Purulia and Bankura after the first round of polls.

 Kumar, who was in Krishnagar to review preparedness for Saturdays second phase, said reports of voter intimidation by various parties have made the commission recommend such a step. If the intimidation continues even after the elections, it needs to be tackled firmly. 

 Asked how long the paramilitary should be deployed after the elections, Kumar added: That depends on the situation. Maintaining law and order is the prerogative of the state government after the completion of the elections. 

 A Nadia official said about 30 complaints of intimidation have already been lodged.

 In Calcutta, chief electoral officer Debashis Sen said jawans would flag march at various places in Nadia, Howrah, Hooghly and East Midnapore from tomorrow morning.

 The commission today sent back a Nadia election observer for neglecting duty. Sundar Singh Gurjar went missing from the Kaligunj constituency on Sundays. 

 If we can act against a state official, we can also do so against our own people who are shirking duties, Kumar said.

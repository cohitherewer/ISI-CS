 Citu holds up work at factories

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Ranigunj, Jan. 11: Workers owing allegiance to the CPMs labour wing, Citu, disrupted loading and unloading operations at eight factories in the Ranigunj area of Burdwan district today.

 They were demanding provident fund, gratuity, bonus, insurance facilities and overtime for private security guards hired by the factories at the Mangalpur industrial estate, 230 km from Calcutta.

 The workers staged a sit-in at the factory gates, stopped movement of trucks carrying raw materials and finished products for over eight hours and prevented other officials from entering the plants.

 The agitation was withdrawn around 4 pm after the factories and private security agencies assured that the demands would be looked into. A tripartite meeting will be held on January 18. Citus Burdwan district secretary Haradhan Jha, who led the agitation today, threatened an indefinite strike if the issue was not settled by this month.

 We hired the guards from agencies. They are not our employees. I do not understand why the union is disrupting operations, said M.M. Khandelwal, the general manager of Jai Balaji Sponge Iron Ltd, one of the affected factories.

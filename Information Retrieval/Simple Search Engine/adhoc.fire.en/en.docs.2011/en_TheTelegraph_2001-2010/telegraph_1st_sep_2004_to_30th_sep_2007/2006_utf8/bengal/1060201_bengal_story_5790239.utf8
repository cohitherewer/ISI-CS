 Margaret Alva and Mamata Banerjee: Clock ticking

 Calcutta, Jan. 31: In a last-ditch bid to wean Mamata Banerjee from the BJP, Sonia Gandhi has asked Margaret Alva, the Congress general secretary in charge of Bengal, to initiate a dialogue with her.

 An AICC official said from Delhi the decision follows two unsuccessful meetings defence minister and Bengal party president Pranab Mukherjee had with the Trinamul Congress chief ? on December 31 and January 28. 

 Realising that Alva maintains good relations with Mamata, Soniaji has assigned her to persuade the Trinamul leader to leave the NDA, he added. 

 State Congress working president Pradip Bhattacharya, who called on Alva and some other AICC leaders in the capital during the day, said the partys state unit is still optimistic about an electoral understanding with Trinamul sans the BJP.

 Bhattacharya added: We hope good sense prevails on Mamata after Alva meets her discuss seat adjustments. We are ready to sacrifice as many seats as she expects from us.

 Alva will be in the state on February 13 and 14. 

 Congress MP from Malda A.B.A. Ghani Khan Chowdhury, who has been lobbying for an alliance with Mamata even if she does not desert the BJP, will call on the Congress president tomorrow. 

 Barkatda is expected to submit a report to Soniaji explaining the need for an electoral tie-up with Mamata, a state Congress leader said from Delhi.

 Several leaders today said they would raise the alliance issue in the state Congress executive committee meeting slated for February 5. 

 Well have to explore ways of fielding one Opposition nominee against a Left Front candidate. The CPMs defeat has to be ensured, MLA Shankar Singh said.

 Mamata, however, reiterated her loyalty to the BJP. Alva is most welcome for a one-to-one discussion on seat adjustment. But I want the AICC leaders to understand the ground reality in Bengal, where the CPM is our main adversary. Against this backdrop, we should come together irrespective of our association with the NDA or the UPA in Delhi, she said.

 A Trinamul leader said the Congress need not directly tie up with us to enter into a seat-sharing deal.

 He added: The BJP is hardly a force to reckon with in Bengal. So let the Congress field some weak nominees against the BJPs candidates nominees to re-establish its secular credentials. This will definitely help in building an understanding among anti-CPM forces.

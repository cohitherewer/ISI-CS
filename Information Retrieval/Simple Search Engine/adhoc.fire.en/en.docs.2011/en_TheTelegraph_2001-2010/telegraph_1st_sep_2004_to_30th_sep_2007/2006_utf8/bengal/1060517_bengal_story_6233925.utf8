 Death in Behala political clash

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, May 16: A CPM activist was beaten to death in Behala this morning during a clash with Trinamul Congress supporters over who should unload a truck.

 Dilu Bahadur Singh, 35, who was killed on Sahapur Road, was the father of three children between 8 and 13. 

 The trouble started around 11 when a truck arrived loaded with raw materials for a plywood factory. Over a dozen youths owing allegiance to Trinamul or the CPM rushed to grab the unloading job and a scuffle resulted.

 Some Trinamul supporters came out with sticks, rods and bricks and started beating up their rivals. In the melee, Dilu fell and his head was smashed by a brick. 

 Six people were taken to MR Bangur hospital, where Dilu was declared dead.

 As the word spread, CPM supporters attacked houses of two Trinamul workers in the locality on the southern fringes of Calcutta.

 Three persons have been arrested. 

 South 24-Parganas police chief S.N. Gupta said a hunt is on for the others responsible for the murder. We have posted a police picket in the area to defuse tension, he added.

 Gopal Barik, the CPMs zonal secretary, said the Trinamul supporters fled seeing Dilu bleed from the head. They killed him. They are trying to use muscle to take control of the loading and unloading operations in factories here.

 The local Trinamul councillor of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, Krishna Singh, denied the partys role in the incident. The CPM guys started the trouble, she said.

 Trinamuls Tarak Singh said the CPM supporters had tried to disrupt the unloading. Since the victory of the CPM candidate (Kumkum Chakraborty from Behala East), they have been trying to wrest control of the area. In the last civic elections, Trinamul had won from Sahapur.

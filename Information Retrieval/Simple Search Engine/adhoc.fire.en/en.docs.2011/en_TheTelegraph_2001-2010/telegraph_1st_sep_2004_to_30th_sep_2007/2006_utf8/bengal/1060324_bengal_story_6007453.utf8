 Mamata salvo at Congress

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, March 23: Mamata Banerjee has said that the Congresss move to field candidates against her party nominees would only help the CPM by ensuring a division of votes.

 The Congress had yesterday announced names of 83 candidates, rejecting Mamatas proposal for seat adjustments.

 I used to say that the Congress is the CPMs B-team. Now, I find it is the CPMs main team. I tried my best to ensure a one-to-one fight against the Left Front.

 However, they have their compulsions at the Centre. How can the Congress, after enjoying the CPMs support, go against the Marxists? So, they (the Congress) stuck to the dump-BJP theory, which I could not subscribe to, the Trinamul Congress chief said today.

 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, Sept. 17: Repolling will be held in two booths at Arsha and Manbazar of the Purulia Lok Sabha constituency where a by-poll was held yesterday. 

 The chief electoral officer said faulty voting machines necessitated the repoll. Counting for bypolls to three Lok Sabha constituencies and one Assembly seat will be held on Tuesday.

 Krishnagar: Dacoits dressed as policemen raided three houses belonging to garment traders in Nadias Habibpur on Saturday night and allegedly decamped with cash and jewellery worth Rs 70 lakh. Police said Adhir Sarkar, Bidhan Sarkar and Bishnupada Biswas had a lot of money at home because they had to invest it in business before Puja.

 Calcutta: Union water resources minister Saifuddin Soz and his Bangladeshi counter- part Hafijuddin Ahmed surveyed the banks of the Ichhamati in Basirhat, North 24-Parganas, on Sunday. The survey is being carried out to identify points of maximum erosion. A study of the Bangladeshi banks will be conducted before a meeting in Dhaka on Thursday.

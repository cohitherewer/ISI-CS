The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Ex-judge shifts to rented home 

 - With a heavy heart, Banerjee leaves auctioned building

 A STAFF REPORTER

 What used to be Bhagabati Prosad Banerjees house in Salt Lakes FD block

 Calcutta, March 19: Former high court judge Bhagabati Prosad Banerjee today vacated his home of two decades a day before the Supreme Court deadline expires and moved to a single-storey house, also in Salt Lake.

 I could not accommodate one-fourth of my furniture in the rented house (in HB block), rued Banerjee, who has been shifting his belongings for the past two days. I have kept the rest of my belongings in the houses of my various relatives.

 His entire family of eight will move into the new house for the time being.

 The apex court had on March 10 asked Banerjee to vacate his earlier home in FD block in 10 days after rejecting his appeal to set aside the auction of the house by the state government on February 4. 

 It also asked the registry not to accept any more applications on the case without its permission 

 I am leaving the house with a heavy heart. I have stayed there for two decades and formulated many important judgments in my mind in the house during my stay. I have to obey the Supreme Court order but I have not received justice, a downcast Banerjee said before leaving the house with his family around 2 pm.

 Only his son Bhaskar stayed back to complete the formalities. Around 5 pm, the new owner, Pradip Kumar Murarka, arrived. Bhaskar handed the papers over to him in the presence of the estate manager of Salt Lake, P.K. Gupta.

 The formalities over, Bhaskar shook Murarkas hand and asked the businessman to enter the house.

 On November 19, 2004, the apex court had set aside the allotment of four cottahs in FD Block to the former judge.

 It asked the state to sell the land and the building separately through an auction.

 The decision came on PILs challenging the allotment, made under the discretionary quota of the then chief minister, Jyoti Basu.

 At the auction, Murarka offered the highest bid of Rs 51 lakh ? Rs 20.5 lakh for the land and 30.5 lakh for the building. 

 Banerjee filed an application in the apex court saying the market value of the house ? which has five bedrooms, two garages and two underground water tanks ? was much higher and urging it to cancel the auction.

 Officials of the urban development department had handed over a cheque for Rs 30.5 lakh for the building to Banerjee on March 13.

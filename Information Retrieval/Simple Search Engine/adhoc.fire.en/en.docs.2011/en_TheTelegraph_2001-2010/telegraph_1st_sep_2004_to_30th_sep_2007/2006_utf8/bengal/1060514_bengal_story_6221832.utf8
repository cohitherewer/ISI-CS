The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Police aid for burnt man

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Constable Goutam Das

 Calcutta, May 13: There was a shriek and a man lay on the ground. Then he sprang up and started running here and there, still crying in pain, with the smell of burning clothes and flesh growing stronger.

 Ratan Das, who was digging a ditch at Nandans entrance this morning, was electrocuted as his spade hit a 6,000-volt feeder line. 

 As he cried in pain, no onlooker dared come anywhere near until constable Goutam Das stepped in.

 Das took Ratan, 20, to SSKM Hospital. Doctors said he had 93 per cent burns. 

 The cable that was hit fed the transformer in the complex. The short-circuit that resulted caused a power failure at Nandan and adjoining areas.

 There was a noise like that of a transformer blast and he was thrown away. He sat up with a start and rushed to others for help. He was all black. There were seven other labourers, but none touched him fearing a shock, said Rajan Das Bairagya, a security guard. 

 Das, a constable with the south traffic guard posted at the front gate, also heard the bang. When I reached the spot, his hands and legs were burnt. Nothing remained of his clothes or hair. Only his polyester trousers clung to his flesh, Das said.

 Grabbing Ratan, who was running in panic and pain, Das flagged a taxi down and took him to SSKM Hospital. 

 PWD officials said drainage pipes were being laid to prevent waterlogging. The digging is being carried out for the past three days, a PWD official attached to Nandan said. He also alleged that a CESC line was not covered with tiles, as it should have been, and that resulted in the electrocution.

 A CESC spokesman said the allegations of negligence would be investigated. 

 However, Phatik Chandra Haldar, the Hastings police station officer-in-charge, ruled out any negligence. He said: It was purely an accident.

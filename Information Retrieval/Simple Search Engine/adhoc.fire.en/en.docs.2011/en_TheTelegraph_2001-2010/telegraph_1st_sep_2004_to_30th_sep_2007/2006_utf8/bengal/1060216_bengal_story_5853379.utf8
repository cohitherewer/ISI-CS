The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Threat to terror tactic

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Feb. 15: The Election Commission today directed Bengals chief electoral officer to take immediate legal action against those who try to intimidate voters.

 The order makes it apparent that the poll panel has taken Opposition parties complaints of voter intimidation seriously and is stepping up pressure on the government to act against the guilty. 

 Government officials said the directive is the first of its kind to the state. 

 Opposition parties have long been crying hoarse against the CPM, accusing it of resorting to terror tactics in the run-up to the polls and on the day of the elections. 

 In a communique to chief electoral officer Debasish Sen, commission secretary R.K. Srivastava has said there should be no let-up in action against those who are trying to strike terror in the hearts of voters. 

 Sen said: The commission has taken a serious view of voter intimidation incidents and has instructed us to ensure that offenders are brought to book without delay.

 Election observers, after having completed their second round of visits to the state, told the commission that there were serious complaints about voters being harassed and prevented from getting their names included in the electoral rolls. The commission last week slammed the state government for being lax in handling poll-related irregularities and intimidation of voters. 

 The government came to know about the directive this afternoon and promptly instructed director-general of police S.C. Avasthy and city police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee to work in accordance with the guidelines. 

 District election officers, meaning district magistrates, will have to keep track of complaints of voter intimidation and look into reports of voters being prevented from filing complaints. The job of DMs does not end here. They will have to take legal action and follow it up by submitting action-taken reports to the chief electoral officer. He will then send the reports to the commission, Sen said. 

 State CPM secretary Anil Biswas said: It is the governments duty to protect voters and take action against such offences.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Want our votes? Give us good roads first

 ABHIJEET CHATTERJEE 

 Burdwan, April 28: Mention the word election and Makhan Ghoshs blood starts boiling.

 The 55-year-old sweetmeat shop owner in Shyambati under the Purbasthali constituency, about 200 km from Calcutta, has decided to boycott this years polls till his village sees development.

 Ghosh says the poor state of roads in Shyambati is a hurdle to his daughters marriage.

 He had found a good match for 20-year-old Barnali (name changed). Dibyendu (name changed), apart from flaunting a BA degree was also the son of an affluent businessman from Shaktigarh, Rakhal Saha. 

 When Saha proposed that he come to Shyambati to meet Barnali, Ghosh flinched. My first reaction was how can I have them in Shyambati as there is no motorable road within 5 km of the village, Ghosh said. 

 But Saha insisted. So, in February, Ghosh led him to his home across a paddy field and a muddy road. Not a smooth ride, but the businessman did not seem to mind. He left saying his son would visit soon. 

 But by the time Dibyendu came to see his would-be bride, monsoon had already arrived. And the muddy roads were flooded with slush. 

 A few days after he returned, we received a letter from Rakhal babu cancelling the marriage, Saha said.

 Our village is virtually inaccessible to civilisation. There has not been any development. Why do you think we should vote? he fumed.

 Ghosh is one of the 450 residents of the village for whom vote is a dirty word. Our slogan is: no development, no vote, said Naryan Hazra, an elderly farmer. 

 Across Burdwan district ? it goes to polls on May 3 ? about 6,000 people from 20 villages have decided to stay home on voting day as their cries for better roads, electricity and drinking water have fallen on deaf ears.

 CU rap on examiners

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Nov 16: Calcutta University today pulled up head examiners for neglecting the evaluation and scrutiny of BA, BSc and BCom Part I answer scripts. 

 Their lack of initiative has been identified as the main reason for the delay in publication of results, which were supposed to be out by October.

 Around 1.8 lakh students took the written tests in August-September. Some 8,000 answer scripts are yet to be evaluated and scrutinised.

 We are taking all possible steps to announce the results of the exams held under the previous 2+1 year scheme by November 30, said Suranjan Das, CUs pro-vice-chancellor, academic affairs. It would take at least another fortnight to announce the date for the results of the exams under the new three-part scheme.

 Many examiners couldnt be contacted during the Pujas. There was also a lack of initiative on the part of the head examiners in maintaining contact with the examiners, a CU official said.

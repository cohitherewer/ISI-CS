 Calcutta, Sept. 9: Police today rescued a boy and a girl who had fled to Calcutta from their homes in Burdwan and got lost in the city.

 Twelve-year-old Arijit Mandal and 16-year-old Soni Sharma were brought to Muchipara police station.

 Arijit was handed over to his mother today. She said her son was unhappy about studying in a school run by a welfare home for refugee kids. I admitted him to the home last Saturday as he was going wayward, mixing with rogues in our locality, said Anju Mandal, who works as a domestic help.

 Arijit told the police that he had boarded a private bus but did not have money to buy a ticket. The conductor forced him to get off at the Surya Sen Street-Amherst Street crossing. A traffic sergeant spotted him crying and took him to the police station.

 Soni, the daughter of a tailor, came to Calcutta by train and was found loitering at the Sealdah railway station. But it was not known why she had run away.

 The police are making arrangements to send her home.

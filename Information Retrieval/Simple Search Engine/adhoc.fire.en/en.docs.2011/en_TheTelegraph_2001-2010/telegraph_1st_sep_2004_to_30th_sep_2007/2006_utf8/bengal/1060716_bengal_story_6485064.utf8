The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 English skill drive

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, July 15: Admitting that students joining professional courses often suffer for not being fluent in English, higher education minister Sudarshan Raychaudhuri today said a drive has been launched to improve their skill in the language.

 Students joining professional courses like law and engineering often suffer from an inherent drawback. They are not fluent in English, Raychaudhuri said while presenting his ministrys budget in the Assembly.

 He said the government, in collaboration with organisations such as the British Council and the Institute of English, has launched a drive to help the students improve their communication skill.

 Language laboratories have also been set up in engineering colleges and teachers training colleges so that modern techniques in language teaching are available to the students, the minister added.

 The minister, however, faced criticism from the Opposition. Students of professional courses lack communication skills in English because of the Left Front governments decision to do away with the language at the primary level in the 1980s, SUCI MLA Debaprasad Sarkar said. The students had to suffer because of the governments faulty education policy, he added.

 The leader of the Trinamul Congress legislature party, Partha Chatterjee, echoed Sarkar.

 Congress legislator from Raigunge Deepa Das Munshi said the government, after harming the interests of students for nearly three decades, has now decided to take the British Councils help to address the problem.

 School education minister Partha De intervened, saying the government had done away with English at the primary level in the 1980s because the situation demanded so. But English was re-introduced in 2004 to keep pace with the changing times.

 The Left Fronts decision to abolish English in the 1980s had evoked protest from academic circles across Bengal. Then chief minister Jyoti Basu had argued in favour of reversing the language policy in 2000 and Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees government re-introduced English from Class I as a compulsory subject four years later.

 On several occasions, Bhattacharjee has said teaching of English is a must for the state to make a turnaround in IT-based industries.

 Govts BEd reminder to CU

 Calcutta, Dec. 18: Wiser after the impasse over BEd colleges not recognised by the National Council for Teachers Education (NCTE), the higher education council has ordered Calcutta University to ensure that its affiliated institutes teaching BEd or MEd have the accreditation.

 In a faxed message, the council told the university that colleges must adhere to all NCTE norms. 

 Among the NCTE criteria that tripped colleges earlier were low teacher-student ratio and lack of facilities.

 The letter said many colleges are yet to get accreditation for the 2006-07 session. No college should admit students for any academic session until it is recognised by the NCTE.

 In April, the high court had branded BEd courses being offered by colleges without the accreditation illegal, leading to a stalemate in the BEd system. Last week, the NCTE granted accreditation to the colleges till 2005-06 and permitted universities to hold this years exams.

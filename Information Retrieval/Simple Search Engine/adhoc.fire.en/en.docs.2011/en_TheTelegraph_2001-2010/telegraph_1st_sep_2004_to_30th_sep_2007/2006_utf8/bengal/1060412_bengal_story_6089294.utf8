The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Comrades great school divide

 Students at a rally in Calcutta against the bill

 Krishnagar, April 11: The CPM-led government in Calcutta might be firm on making it a must for state-aided minority schools to recruit teachers through the School Service Commission, but a partyman in Nadia is feeling the pinch. 

 Samsul Islam Mollah, the partys candidate from Chapra, has to convince some 18,000 Christian voters that the West Bengal School Service Commission (Amendment) Bill, 2006, was not aimed at ensuring state interference in their affairs.

 It is easier, he would prob-ably vouch, to plead with the state CPM leadership to persuade the chief minister to withdraw the bill. He has already done that. 

 Mollah had won the last elections by 4,000-odd votes.

 The bill has evoked protests from the Christian community across the state. 

 Chapra, about 130 km from Calcutta, has a Christian population of 20,000 and a majority of them are believed to be CPM backers.

 In my constituency, the Christian community has only one question. Why has the government taken a step detrimental to the standard of education in their institutions? They are traditional CPM vo- ters and I have no definite answer to their question, the MLA said. 

 Representatives of the community have asked him to take up the issue at the highest levels of the CPM and the government. I have requested our state party secretary, Biman Bose, to take up the matter immediately. Bimanda has assured me that he would try. He has understood the problem.

 Out of the 700 state-aided Christian missionary schools across the state, Nadia has about 50. Of them, 15 are in Chapra alone. 

 Bangiyo Christiyo Pariseba, the state forum of churches, said it has approached Mollah. We thought as the representative of a large number of Christians, he can help us. He has assured us that he would try his best so that the government withdraws the bill. Unless he really does something, it will be difficult for us to keep supporting him, said Ashis Mukherjee, the president of the bodys Nadia chapter. 

 He added that our schools will lose their character and standard because of the bill. 

 The state-aided Christian schools now recruit their own teachers and headmasters. The government is informed about recruitments, but only as a formality. The government is now insisting that if a school is using its funds, it should also follow all its norms. 

 A primary school teacher of Hat Chapra, Lewis Mondal, said the bill has shown the CPM in poor light. Many of its leaders have studied in Christian schools. They chose the schools because of their quality of education. They should not have brought the bill. 

 In the last three Assembly polls, the victory margin of the CPM candidates in Chapra had been slipping. About 65 per cent of the electorate there belong to the minority communities. 

 Mollah is nervous? he has realised the resentment among the Christians. If there is a reflection of the anger in voting machines, he could lose his seat, a Nadia CPM functionary said.

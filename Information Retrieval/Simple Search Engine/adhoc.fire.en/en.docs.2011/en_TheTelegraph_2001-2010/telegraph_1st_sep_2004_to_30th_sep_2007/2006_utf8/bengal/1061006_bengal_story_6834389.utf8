 Hospital shift ire at officer

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Oct. 5: Members of the DYFI slapped the superintendent of the Ranaghat general hospital in Nadia and spat on his face during a two-hour protest against the shifting of a health centre.

 Around 100 members of the CPMs youth wing were demonstrating against the shifting of the health centre, about 65 km from Calcutta, from a municipality-owned plot to make way for a market complex that the civic authorities propose to build there.

 Ranaghat municipality recently decided to set up the market complex on the plot where the hospital ran its out-patients department (OPD) from a building.

 Municipality chairman Partha Chatterjee said superintendent Arunendu Biswas had come to hold a meeting with him. The health department had refused to vacate the land for years. So, we had moved the high court, which asked the hospital authorities to vacate the land, Chatterjee added.

 Chatterjee said the municipality had agreed to hand over about 850 sq ft at another site to the health authorities to relocate the OPD. But the DYFI opposed the arrangement.

 When Biswas came out of the health centre around 12 after holding a meeting with Chatterjee, the DYFI activists confronted him. They pushed him around, slapped and abused him and spit on his face.

 When Shyamal Banerjee, the driver of Biswass official car, came to his rescue, he was beaten up. The youths stoned the medical officers car.

 The DYFI members then gheraoed Biswas. You have bowed before the municipality which is carrying out an anti-people project by ousting a health centre, they shouted at him.

 A contingent from Ranaghat police station later rescued Biswas.

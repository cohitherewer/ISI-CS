The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Pledge to protect workers

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, Dec. 8: The government today promised a security shield for those willing to work on December 14.

 Our government will issue a circular asking its employees to be present on duty on December 14. Elaborate police arrangements will be made to ensure the safety and security of the people who would like to work on that day, advocate-general Balai Ray told Calcutta High Court.

 The court was hearing a petition filed by a person named Biswaketan Mukherjee, who alleged that the trade unions had violated a Supreme Court ruling by calling a bandh. 

 The common people are now fed up with these bandhs. The court should take strong measures against those who have called the bandh, his lawyer Idris Ali said.

 Can your government promise that no person will be attacked on his way to his working place? Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurkar asked the advocate-general.

 He replied that stern action would be taken if any person was stopped from going to work. 

 Ray also clarified to the court that a strike, and not a bandh, has been called on December 14. 

 The court then disposed of Mukherjees petition.

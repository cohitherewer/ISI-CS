The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Mamata and Cong talking

 OUR BUREAU

 Feb. 19: Priya Ranjan Das Munshi said in Nadia today Opposition parties could win 180 out of the 294 Assembly seats in Bengal if the Congress and the Trinamul Congress managed to field one candidate against a Left Front nominee in that many seats. 

 The front is vulnerable in 180 seats and we should field single nominees in all of them, Das Munshi, the Raiganj MP and Union information and broadcasting minister, said in a string of rallies this afternoon. 

 Mamata Banerjee, whose earlier talks with the AICC general secretary in charge of Bengal, Margaret Alva, were said to have been encouraging, again met her this afternoon. The two are believed to have discussed seat adjustments. 

 Das Munshi said: I am confident that something positive will emerge.

 CM plays Santa to Ghisingh

 VIVEK CHHETRI 

 Darjeeling, June 24: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today agreed to give Subash Ghisingh much more than he had bargained for ? control of four municipalities and panchayats, besides the reins of several departments in the hills. 

 In an hour-long meeting at the Richmond Hill guest-house here, the chief minister virtually ensured the GNLF chiefs political survival. Mr Ghisingh wanted (control of) certain departments to be transferred?. But we have also decided to hand over the control of the municipalities and the panchayats, Bhattacharjee said later. 

 This essentially means that funds for the municipalities and panchayats will be routed through the new body formed under the Sixth Schedule, which is to be called the Gorkha Hill Council Darjeeling. 

 Departments like water resources, power (hydel), mines and minerals, archaeological monuments and museum, and social welfare will be handed over to the new council, the chief minister said. The power to collect entertainment tax will also rest with the council.

 Bhattacharjee said one of his priorities after winning the Assembly elections was to sort out the issue (Sixth Schedule). 

 The state government has agreed to increase its annual grant for the hills from Rs 4 crore to Rs 10 crore. The Centres share will go up from Rs 22 crore to Rs 52 crore. 

 The inclusion of new areas under the council was also discussed at the meeting. A final discussion will be held in Calcutta on July 3 on these issues, Bhattacharjee said. 

 There were indications that the state would try and get the Sixth Schedule Bill passed in Parliament during the monsoon session. 

 Both leaders made it clear that elections should be held in the hills only after the Sixth Schedule status is accorded. 

 By agreeing to hand over the municipality, the panchayats and the Darjeeling Improvement Fund (essentially the local haats) to the new council, Bhattacharjee has given enough to the hill leader to maintain a vice-like grip on the hill politics. 

 In the Assembly elections, the GNLF had trailed the Peoples Democratic Front, the anti-Ghisingh coalition, in all urban areas. The margin for Ghisinghs party also decreased in the rural belt, but the GNLF still managed to retain all three seats.

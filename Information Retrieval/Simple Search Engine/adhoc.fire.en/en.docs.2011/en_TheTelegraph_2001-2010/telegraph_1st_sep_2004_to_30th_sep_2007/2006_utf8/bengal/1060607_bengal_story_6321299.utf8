 IIT help

 Calcutta, June 6: The government has asked IIT Kharagpur to prepare a perspective plan for the development of 74 Maoist-hit blocks. 

 A new department for the development of the western zone, which includes rebel strongholds Bankura, Purulia and West Midnapore, has been created this time. Its minister, Sushanta Ghosh, said IIT experts would visit the districts soon and submit their preliminary report in July. 

 The region suffers from acute poverty and lack of even basic amenities.

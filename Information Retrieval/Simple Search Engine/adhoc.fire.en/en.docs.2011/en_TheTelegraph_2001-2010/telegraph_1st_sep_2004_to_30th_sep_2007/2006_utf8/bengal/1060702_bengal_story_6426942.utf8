The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Burglary in flat

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 1: Burglars today left a womans apartment in Kasba with jewellery worth more than Rs 1 lakh.

 Police said the owner of the eighth-floor flat, Tutul Dasgupta, a Reserve Bank employee, returned to her flat around noon to find the main door broken and the two rooms ransacked.

 I kept my jewellery in wardrobes in the rooms. Before leaving this morning, I forgot to take the bunch of keys with me. The thieves opened the wardrobes easily because the keys were hanging from a clamp, Dasgupta said.

 No arrest has been made so far.

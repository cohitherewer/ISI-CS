 Judges find holes in Jalpaiguri bench

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta High Court: North Bengal roadblock

 Calcutta, July 22: The launch of a Calcutta High Court circuit bench in Jalpaiguri hit a wall after a majority of the courts 44 judges dubbed the entire procedure bad in law.

 The move to set up the bench had got rolling in 1990. More than a decade later, when the stage was finally set for starting it, the judges pointed out two legal loopholes when they met yesterday.

 First, high courts in Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Allahabad and Calcutta come under the purview of the letters patent courts. But the procedure adopted in setting up the circuit bench was based on the State Reorganisation Act, 1956, which governs all high courts barring those that fall under letters patent courts.

 In 1990, the state government and the Centre had asked the then chief justice to form a committee of judges to find out where the circuit bench for north Bengal could be set up. A four-member panel of senior judges was formed.

 The judges said the procedure had flouted a second condition applicable to letters patent courts. The decision to set up a circuit bench has to be taken in a full court and a consensus must be reached. But the judges approval was not taken when the court met in 1990. 

 The matter was placed at a full court meeting again yesterday. But the three-hour session failed to reach a consensus. Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurkar then decided to adjourn the meeting sine die.

 The judges will have to sit together once again to find a way out so that the circuit bench can start functioning.

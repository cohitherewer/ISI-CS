The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, Feb. 27: The rioting case invol- ving Mamata Banerjee was today adjourned till May 26 after Calcutta police told the Barasat chief judicial magistrate it was impossible to arrest her at this point of time. 

 On December 27, the court asked the police to arrest Mamata as she had failed to appear in court in over a decade. A Congress supporter was killed in police firing on February 22, 1994, after Mamata, then a Youth Congress leader, allegedly incited a mob while leading a delegation to the North 24- Parganas district magistrates office. 

 Calcutta: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had apparently written to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on February 24, requesting him to have the east-west freight corridor extended to How- rah. The letter, copies of which were distributed among reporters on Monday, says the decision to terminate the corridor at Sonnagar, Bihar, would hinder Bengals industrial growth and set back Singhs Look East policy.

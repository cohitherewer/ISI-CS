The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Nod on Net for Newtown

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Dec. 21: Building plans for residential houses in Newtown can be sanctioned online from January 1.

 State housing minister and West Bengal Housing Infrastructure Development Corporation chairman Goutam Deb today said a website, www.newtownsanction.org, would be launched for online sanction to building plans.

 The online sanction process and information system will help people submit building plans without taking the trouble of visiting the housing corporation office repeatedly, he said.

 The facility will now be available only to those land owners who plan to construct buildings up to four floors on plots up to 1,500 square metres.

 Within three months, the online sanction mechanism will be extended to malls, commercial complexes and multi-storey buildings also, Deb said.

 To prevent malpractice, a mechanism has been put in place whereby only those who own plots can post a building plan on the website. To use the facility, a person will also have to provide his name and the number of the plot owned by him.

 Once the plan is sanctioned, the person concerned will have to visit the housing corporation office once with photocopies of the documents and the pay the required sanction fee to complete the process.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Bloc versus Bloc plus Opposition

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Purulia, Sept. 15: Purulia 

 is going to the polls again because its MP was convicted 

 of gangrape that is the one issue on which tomorrows 

 election is being fought. 

 Forward Bloc leaders have repeatedly told the people over the past month that their man, Bir Singh Mahato, was falsely implicated in the case dating back to 1982. At every meeting, we had to say our MP had been wronged, district secretary Nishikanta Meheta said.

 Mahato, then a secretariat member of the district unit, was charged with raping a housewife in 1982. The case remained buried until a fast-track court dug it up last year.

 The MP resigned in May, a week after he was sent to jail for 10 years, necessitating the bypoll. The high court granted him bail in August. 

 Mahato campaigned for partyman Narahari Mahato this time and tried to cleanse his image, but chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, the star campaigner, refused to share the dais with him on September 11. We had insisted on Mahatos presence in the rally, but he was forced to skip it, said a Bloc leader preferring anonymity. 

 In 2004, Mahato had won by around 1.5 lakh votes. It is not going to be that easy for Narahari Mahato this time, feels the Opposition camp, because the Trinamul Congress has lent its weight to the Congress. But even counting the Opposition votes together, the difference was over 40,000 two years ago.

 In the May Assembly polls, the front bagged six Assembly segments in the Purulia Lok Sabha seat, while the Congress won only Jhalda.

 The 1982 gangrape would bridge that gap, said district Trinamul president K.P. Singhdeo: Our (Trinamul plus Congress) effort, coupled with the peoples anger against the former MP, would help us (the Congresss Shantiram Mahato) wrest the seat. 

 CPM district secretariat member Kesto Biswas was aware of the changed scenario: We are fighting an Opposition comprising the Congress, Trinamul, Jharkhand Mukti Morcha and the BJP. There will be a contest. 

 The Bloc leader knows his party is also up against its own leaders past. Jaladhar Garai, 22, a cook in Ranchi, who has come home to vote, said: In all the other places Katwa, Malda and Bongaon the bypoll is being held because legislators have died. But our MP, who committed a gangrape, forced it on us.

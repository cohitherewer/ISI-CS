 TB fight, KBC-style

 RABI BANERJEE 

 Krishnagar, Aug. 27: The popularity of quiz shows post-Kaun Banega Crorepati has prompted the Nadia authorities to use them in poor, little-educated villages to spread better understanding of a disease that many in rural areas are apparently trying to conceal. 

 According to health department estimates, there are around 10,000 tuberculosis patients in the district, but only half of them are being treated. Se-veral thousand patients now stop medication midway and only some come back for medicines, given free in government clinics, after a relapse.

 An official said health workers have failed to trace fresh TB patients of late, which confirms the lack of awareness among people about its symptoms. Our records suggest that more and more patients are dropping out of treatment. 

 The interest that TV quiz shows had created even among less educated rural people made us pick them as our new campaign mode, said Joydeep Mukherjee, subdivisional officer (headquarters). 

 A cured patient now plays quizmaster for shows in which patients, old and new, participate and villagers sit in the audience. 

 The prizes for being able to answer questions on TBs dos and donts, symptoms, side-effects, medicines and myths are crockery. 

 The results have been startling. In Nabadwip, Krishnagar and Nakashipara blocks, where such shows were held, the number of patients reporting to hospital for treatment doubled, Mukherjee said. 

 According to the Centre, there are 203 TB patients in a population of 100,000 in the country. 

 By that standard, Nadia should be having about 10,000 TB patients. But only 5,000 have been located so far. We dont know about the rest, said Mrinal Kanti Biswas, the districts chief medical officer. 

 Last year, about 70 people, including children, died of the disease. Till June this year, the figure is 30. 

 The government spends lakhs on posters and hoardings every year for its anti-tuberculosis campaign. But how many people in rural and semi-urban areas get their message? asked an official. 

 It takes about Rs 1,500 to organise a quiz show.

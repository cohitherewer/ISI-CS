 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, May 30: The government is considering a proposal for a Rs 1,000-crore silicon photo-voltaic cell manufacturing unit. 

 Commerce and industries secretary Sabyasachi Sen said American company Perseus, which manufactures chemicals, and its Calcutta partner Environ Energy Tech, which makes solar cells, together want to build the new plant. Officials of Srei, a likely financier for the project, said only preliminary discussions had been held.

 Krishnagar: Bangladeshi officials have handed over to an Indian team a list of criminals wanted in that country and allegedly hiding here. The Indians, led by Nadia district magistrate Rajesh Pandey, visited Kustia district. Last year, Nadia officials had handed over a similar list to the Bangladeshis.

 Midnapore: Four persons were killed on Tuesday when a pick-up van laden with fish hit a lamp post and overturned on way to Jhargram. It was trying to avoid a cyclist, who also died.

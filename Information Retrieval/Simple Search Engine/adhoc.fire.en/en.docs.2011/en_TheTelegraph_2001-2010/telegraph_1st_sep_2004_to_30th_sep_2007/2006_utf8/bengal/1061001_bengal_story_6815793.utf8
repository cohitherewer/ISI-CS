The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Mamata in no mood for Singur meet

 - Trinamul demands public apology from Buddha

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mamata Banerjee, VP Singh: Hand in hand

 Calcutta, Sept. 30: The Trinamul Congress today said it would stay away from Wednesdays all-party meeting on Singur to press its demand for a public apology from chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee for unleashing police brutalities on Mamata Banerjee.

 The state government called the meeting to discuss land acquisition for Tata Motors small car project in Singur in Hooghly district following a letter from the state Congress.

 Mamata has accused police of assaulting her while she was staging a protest at the Singur BDOs office on Tuesday.

 We are not in a mood to attend Wednesdays all-party meet until the chief minister offers a public apology for Tuesdays incident, leader of Opposition in the Assembly Partha Chatterjee said today. 

 Moreover, he added, he hasnt received any official communication about the meeting yet.

 Land and land reforms minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah, who had met Chatterjee on Thursday, brushed off the Trinamuls demand. Why should the chief minister offer a public apology? he asked. 

 The minister said Mamatas allegation needs to be probed by the Hooghly administration to find out under what circumstances policemen had to clear the blockade from the Singur BDOs office.

 Doctors treating Mamata at Belle Vue Clinic today said she was better. But the Trinamul chief will be under close observation and ECG monitoring for another 48 hours. 

 Chatterjee said there cannot be any discussion until the government withdraws its notification on acquisition of land for the Tata project. The party has already made a representation to the governor.

 The Trinamul leader said he had requested Mollah on Thursday not to acquire multi-crop plots for industry. 

 We are not against the Tatas. But the party is opposed to acquisition of multi-crop land hampering the interest of poor farmers, he said.

 Mollah said he had suggested to Chatterjee that his party hinge its campaign on compensation. I told him Trinamul can get popular support only if it launches a movement for more compensation for poor farmers. If they give it in writing, the government will definitely consider the demand.

 Trinamul general secretary Mukul Roy slammed the government for hurriedly fixing the date of the meet. This is ill-timed. Now we are only concerned about Mamatadis health, he said.

 The state Congress said it would attend the meeting. We are neither opposed to industry nor the Tatas. But we must know what type of land is being given to them, said party leader Manas Bhuniya.

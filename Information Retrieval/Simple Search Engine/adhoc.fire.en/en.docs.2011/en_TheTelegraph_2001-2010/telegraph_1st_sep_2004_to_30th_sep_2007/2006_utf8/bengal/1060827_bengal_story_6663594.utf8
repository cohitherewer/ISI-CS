The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Teacher under glare

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

Burdwan, Aug. 26: A geography teacher of a 

high school has been arrested on the charge of abetting the suicide of a Class 

IX student.

 Seventeen-year-old Ramena Khatun had committed suicide by setting herself afire on July 18 this year.

 A severely burnt Ramena was admitted to Burdwan Medical College and Hospital where she died that night.

 At the hospital, Ramena had told doctors that she had written a suicide note and kept it in her school bag.

 District superintendent of police Peeyush Pandey said the teacher, Basudeb Tah, was arrested on August 19 on the basis of the suicide note.

 Tah is also a former pradhan of the CPM-run Saraitikar gram panchayat on the outskirts of Burdwan town, about 100 km from Calcutta.

 According to the police, the geography teacher of Vidyasagar High School had pulled up Ramena for talking in class and confined her in a office room of the school for three hours.

 Ramena felt she was punished for no fault of hers and felt terribly insulted. On returning home she was depressed and locked up herself in her room.

 Later, she got a bottle of kerosene from the kitchen and went to the terrace, where she set herself on fire, said a police officer working on the case.

 Before she died, she told her family members and doctors on duty that she had left a suicide note in her school bag. We found the note in which she blamed Basudeb Tah, said Ramenas father Mansoor Ali, a railway employee.

 Mansoor lodged a complaint with the police against the teacher.

 However, the police did not arrest the teacher. Ramenas father then threatened to move the state human rights commission against the delay in arresting the teacher and starting criminal proceedings against him.

 But local MLA Pradip Tah contacted Mansoor and assured him that all steps would be taken to ensure proper police action.

 My daughters soul will rest in peace if the guilty is punished. The person responsible for her death should get exemplary punishment, Mansoor said.

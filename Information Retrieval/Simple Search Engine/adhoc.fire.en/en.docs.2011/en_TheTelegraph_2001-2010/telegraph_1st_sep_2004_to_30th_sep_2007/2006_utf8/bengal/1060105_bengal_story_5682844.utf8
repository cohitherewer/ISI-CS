 Burdwan bus looted

 OUR BUREAU

 Burdwan, Jan. 4: Robbers looted a private bus in Burdwan last night and made off with booty worth Rs 2 lakh after allegedly molesting some passengers, including two schoolgirls.

 The armed group also assaulted the bus driver, Mohammed Salim, 42, and conductor Ajoy Halder. Salim has been admitted to the Kalna sub-divisional hospital. 

 The bus ? the last for the day on the Kalna (Burdwan)-Gurap (Hooghly) route ? was carrying over 50 passengers.

 When it reached Jamna on the Burdwan-Hooghly border, 120 km from Calcutta, around 9 pm, eight men sprang out of their seats and pounced on the driver, ordering him to stop.

 When Salim did not listen and instead tried to speed up, one of the robbers plunged a dagger into his back several times, forcing him to slam the brakes. Then the other members of the gang went on a looting spree, Halder said.

 Police, however, dismissed the passengers allegation that some women on the bus had been molested.

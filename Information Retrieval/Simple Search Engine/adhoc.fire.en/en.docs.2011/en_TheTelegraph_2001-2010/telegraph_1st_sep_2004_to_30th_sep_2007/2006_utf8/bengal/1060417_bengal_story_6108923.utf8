The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 First The Kid, then message for adults: Dont vote

 PRONAB MONDAL

Somewhere along the Bengal-Jharkhand border, April 16: A 30-minute ride on an old, black Rajdoot motorcycle from Belpahari ? blindfolded. 

 A two-minute break and a change of vehicle ? this time the burrr is heavier, it must be a Bullet. 

 The next one-hour journey is better as the blindfold is removed around midnight. 

 The surroundings lit by the night sky, the two-wheeler makes its way through dense forests and small villages.

 The journey ends in a village around 1.15 this morning. The Jharkhand border is just a kilometre away. 

 Surrounded by the sal and mohua forests of Kantaboni on three sides and a knoll called Chowkishai Dungri looming against the sky to the north, the area, it is said, is about 250 km from Calcutta. 

 Two armed youths in army fatigues lead the way to a mud hut. 

 Beyond the door is a courtyard where over 150 tribals have assembled. 

 They are glued to a television set watching, believe it or not, Charlie Chaplin. 

 There are men and women with guns slung across their shoulders watching The Kid. 

 The battery-run portable television set lights up a part of the courtyard. A lantern sways in the breeze from the branch of a nearby tree under which stand two cows. 

 As the great Chaplin show goes on, the crowd of villagers and Maoist guerrillas ? terrorists to security personnel swarming the region ? frequently burst into laughter.

 After the film ends, there is spontaneous applause from the audience. 

 The villagers are about to disperse when a man in army fatigues approaches them. 

 Ekhon tomra dekhbey ki korey tomader opor sarkar atyachar chalay. Amader ekta chhotto natak samajer ashol chhabi tule dhorbey (Now youll see how the government torments you. Our theatre will present a clear picture).

 A play is performed where atrocities allegedly perpetrated by police, local landlords and moneylenders is enacted. 

 The gun-toting guerrillas turn performers for the play that continues for half an hour.

 At the end of it, the villagers are visibly more at ease with the guerrillas. 

 Now, the Maoists start talking to the villagers individually, asking them not to vote tomorrow.

 They (the security forces) dont allow us to campaign publicly. We have no way out but to visit villagers after midnight. We are requesting them not to go to sleep so that they have a good time watching the movie and the plays, said the leader of the squad, comrade Rano (his name changed on request). 

 If we try to explain the situation (why they are having to wage war on the state), the poor villagers will not be able to understand, so we have decided to dramatise the events. Through our plays, we show how politicians, ministers, police and moneylenders abuse them. Then we tell them to boycott the polls, he said.

 The Maoist commander says this is a step towards taking the illiterate villagers into confidence. It has proved to be very effective in building a relationship with the villagers. They are not afraid of us any more, he added.

 The inspector-general of police (western range), Banibrata Basu, said: The police are aware of the campaign and we have started combing operations in these Maoist-dominated areas.

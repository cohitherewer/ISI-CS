 Dams make flood better and worse 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 22: Over 10 lakh people have been affected by rain in nine districts, finance minister Asim Dasgupta said today. Twenty-nine people have died.

 Were releasing Rs 8.5 crore for relief. Around 76,000 houses have been damaged, he added.

 With his irrigation, disas- ter management and civil de- fence counterparts, Dasgupta reviewed the situation today.

 Officials said the situation in Birbhum and Murshidabad improved after 1.16 lakh cusecs of water were released from the Messanjore reservoir.

 But Messanjores blessing could be the bane for Kanthi and Rampurhat, where the water levels might rise as a result. 

 The irrigation and disaster management ministers will go to South 24-Parganas Canning, Gosaba and Basanti blocks tomorrow to monitor relief. A pumping station in nearby Baruipur has not been working because of a power cut caused by collapse of electric poles.

 Authorities at Farakka have been told to limit the release of water or Bhagirathi would rise dangerously.

 Leave for all relief department employees has been cancelled.

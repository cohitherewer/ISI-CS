 PM glare on Singur row

 ASHIS CHAKRABARTI

 Dec. 16: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today warned against obstructionist politics, such as Mamata Banerjees opposition to the Tata Motors project in Singur, because it could vitiate the investment climate. 

 Replying to a question on the agitation against the Tata project at a news conference on board his flight home from Japan, the Prime Minister (in picture) said anything that came in the way of maintaining industrial peace would be a setback to investments. He did not, however, mention either Mamatas agitation or the Tata project. 

 The country needs investment so that jobs can be created, he said. It is the obligation of all stakeholders workers, employers and the government to work together to create an investment-friendly climate, Singh added. 

 He expressed hope that all political parties, trade unions and employers representatives would work together to maintain industrial peace.

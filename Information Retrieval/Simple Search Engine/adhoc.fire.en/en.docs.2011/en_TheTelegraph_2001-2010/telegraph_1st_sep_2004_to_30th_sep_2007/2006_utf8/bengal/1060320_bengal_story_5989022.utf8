 Election curbs on leaders amp; vehicles

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 19: The Election Commission today sent a fresh set of directives to ensure clean polls, restricting leaders movement and ordering the branding of vehicles in the campaign cavalcade.

 Chief electoral officer Debasish Sen said political functionaries provided security by the government would not be allowed to venture out of their respective polling zones after campaigning stops 48 hours before polling. 

 This means that a Mamata Banerjee or a state minister will not be able to leave the areas where they are voters as soon as campaigning stops. 

 The order will be in force on election day as well. 

 However, candidates dont come under the purview of this order.

 Every candidate, however, will have to take permits from their respective returning officers for each and every vehicle to be used for campaigning. 

 The registration numbers of the vehicles and the candidates names will have to be displayed on the windscreen. 

 The returning officers will draw up a master list on the number of vehicles (that will mainly mean cars and two-wheelers) used by a candidate and hand it over to the election observers. 

 According to Sen, three cars are being allowed to ply in a convoy. On the day of the election, the commission will allow only two cars. 

 The chief electoral officer said the third directive says that if polling does not begin within two hours of the scheduled start, the election will be adjourned and held on a later date. 

 Sen said sometimes there is delay in beginning the polling for various reasons. But this time, the EC has decided to deal with it strictly.

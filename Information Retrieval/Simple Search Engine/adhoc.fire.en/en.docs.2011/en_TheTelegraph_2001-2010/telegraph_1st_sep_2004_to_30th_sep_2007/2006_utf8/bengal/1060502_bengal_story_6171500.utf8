The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Vote denial 

 Calcutta, May 1: Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya will hold the briefs of three Howrah residents who were not allowed to vote despite having voter IDs. The electoral rolls had declared them dead.

 I will fight the case, Bhattacharya said today.

 Thousands of genuine vo- ters could not exercise their franchise in the first three phases, the poll panel has admitted. 

 The mayor, too, had a tough time because he went to his booth in Dhakuria without the ID and the officers wouldnt let him vote on the basis of his driving licence and PAN card.

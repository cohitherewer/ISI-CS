The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Aged couple driven to death 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Barasat, 

 Dec. 10: A lonely, elderly couple who did not have 

 the money to buy food or medicines apparently committed 

 suicide in a North 24-Parganas locality.

 Joydeb Joarder, 75, and Smriti, 65, were found hanging from the ceiling of their thatched hut in Bongaon, about 60 km from Calcutta, this morning. 

 Police said they might have been hanging like that for the past three days.

 Smriti used to work as a domestic help and Joydeb sold vegetables at Shaktigar bazaar. But they were unable to afford everyday expenses and take care of their failing eyesight and health. 

 The Bongaon subdivisional police officer, Subhas Sen, said the bodies were decomposed. 

 Local people called the police after a stench started emanating from the hut. 

 The administration will probe whether they had died of poverty and hunger. 

 We shall investigate if they were living below the poverty line and how that failed to come to the notice of the local municipality or administration, said district magistrate P.K. Mishra.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Green permit rule for Rajarhat

 JAYANTA BASU

 A housing project in New Town

 Calcutta, April 1: All major construction projects less than 21 months old in New Town, Rajarhat, will now have to obtain Delhis nod.

 A recent letter from the Union environment and forests ministry to the state pollution control board says according to the environmental impact assessment amendment notification of July 7, 2004, it is mandatory for all new construction projects/industrial estates? which meet the criteria specified to obtain its prior environmental clearance.

 The criteria cover new townships, industrial townships, settlement colonies, commercial complexes, hotel complexes, hospitals and office complexes for 1,000 persons or above or discharging sewage of 50,000 litres per day or above, or with an investment of Rs 50 crore or above.

 This effectively includes the millions of square feet of real estate being developed in Rajarhat ? from residential complexes and IT space to hotels and hospitals ? by companies such as Bengal Unitech, DLF, Bengal Shrachi, the state housing board, Bengal Ambuja, Bengal Peerless, Bengal DCL and Bengal Greenfield.

 The letter ? providing clarification to queries sent by the pollution board ? also says projects that were undertaken without obtaining the Centres clearance and where construction work hasnt come up to the plinth level by July 7, 2004, will be required to obtain the fresh clearance.

 The root of the confusion lies in the state governments assumption that the clearances already obtained by it around the year 2000 for the whole of Rajarhat would be enough to cover construction work in the years to come.

 We got no-objection certificates for action areas I, II and III from the pollution control board and the necessary clearances from the state environment department before the central notification came into effect. We thought that was adequate, said Biman Bose, director-general, quality control and environment, WBHIDCO, the nodal agency for Rajarhat.

 The mistake was revealed only when the pollution board sought a clarification from the central ministry on a recent housing project.

 A blanket clearance for the township will not do as individual projects must be cleared by the ministry, M. Subba Rao, the additional director of the environment and forests ministry, told The Telegraph.

 Rao said violators can be prosecuted. The penalties include imprisonment for five years along with a fine of Rs 1 lakh. The structures may also be demolished.

 The situation will certainly have an adverse effect on development work going on in Rajarhat. Its the state governments responsibility to guide us in these clearance matters. It seems the government had been sitting on it since the 2004 notification came into effect, a city-based developer involved in Rajarhat said.

 The Supreme Court had recently directed all states to take stringent action against those not abiding by the environmental impact assessment norms.

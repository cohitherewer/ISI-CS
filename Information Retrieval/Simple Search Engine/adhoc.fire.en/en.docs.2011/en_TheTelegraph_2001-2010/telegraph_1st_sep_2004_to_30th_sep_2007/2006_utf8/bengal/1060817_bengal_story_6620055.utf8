The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 IT makes Citu go slow on strike

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 An IT office: At Citus mercy

Calcutta, Aug. 16: Mindful of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees opposition to any ceasework in IT and IT-enabled services, the CPM labour arm today said a decision on whether to include them in the general strike on December 14 would be taken 48 hours earlier. 

 We will decide on the industries and services to be exempted from the ambit of the nationwide general strike two days before it, Citu state president and CPM state secretariat member Shyamal Chakraborty said. 

 No question of principle is involved in this. The decision will be on the basis of ground reality, he added when asked whether IT and ITES would be spared this time following the furore over enforcing a bandh in the Bengal IT hub, Saltlec, last year. 

 CPM insiders said Citus dithering indicates differences between the pro-reforms chief minister and the unions central leadership on strikes. The differences have remained despite several rounds of debates in the party politburo. 

 After Citus bid to enforce a strike in the IT hub on September 29 last year, the angry chief minister had assured an alarmed industry that it was the last bandh in the sector. 

 Bhattacharjee had to climb down after Citu president M.K. Pandhe, a fellow politburo member, and other Citu leaders insisted on IT employees right to form unions and resort to strikes. 

 However, a truce was arrived at as Citu promised a flexible attitude towards the sector in the state, particularly ITES units that operate 24x7 to serve global clients. 

 Party insiders said the date of the general strike this year was deferred to December from September as Bhattacharjee and the Bengal CPM leadership were opposed to a shutdown before Puja.

 Chakraborty said a rally of 500,000 workers will be organised by Citu and other Left unions on December 3. 

 The strike, 11 days later, is being called to protest against the UPA governments alleged anti-labour policies privatisation and divestment in public sector banks, telecom companies and airports and moves to facilitate foreign direct investment in retail, pension funds and coal. 

 In the run-up to the general strike, Citu will focus on ex- panding its support base in the unorganised sector. Informal industry and unorganised labour are increasingly replacing the organised ones, Chakraborty said. Forty-two per cent of the rural workforce in Bengal is now dependent on non-farm jobs.

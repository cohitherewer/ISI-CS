The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 26 patients sent away

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 West Midnapore, Feb. 11: A gynaecologist at a government hospital has been served a showcause notice for allegedly sending 26 pregnant women to private nursing homes. 

 The chief medical officer of health (CMOH) of West Midnapore district has asked the women, who were admitted in the maternity ward of the state-run Ghatal sub-divisional hospital between January 1 and February 5, to state in writing why they had moved to nursing homes for their delivery.

 The state government, too, has started a probe.

 According to a health department official, CMOH Mangobinda Mondal had come to know that the women were forced to leave as gynaecologist Biswajit Sarkar was unwilling to treat them. He then ordered that a showcause be served on the doctor. 

 Sarkar has replied to the notice, saying he tried his best to provide the women with proper support and had no idea why they left the hospital and delivered their babies at nursing homes.

 But the CMOH is not satisfied with the explanation. If a doctor tries his best, why should patients leave the hospital? Mondal, asked.

 I was the only doctor in the maternity ward when those women were admitted. I requested one or two patients to come later as I was buried under tremendous workload. But I never asked any patient to leave the hospital, Sarkar told The Telegraph.

 But Mithu Sinha, one of the patients, had a different story. The doctor told me that he had no time to attend on me. So I left the hospital and delivered my baby at a local nursing home.

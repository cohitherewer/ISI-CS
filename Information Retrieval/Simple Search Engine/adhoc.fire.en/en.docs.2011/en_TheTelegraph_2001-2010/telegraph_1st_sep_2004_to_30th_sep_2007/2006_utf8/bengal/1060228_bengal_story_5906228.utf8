 Hatidoba (Belpahari)/Calcutta, Feb. 27: Fear and anger are running hand in hand in Belpahari following yesterdays landmine blast, with residents questioning the role of police as their protectors.

 They are convinced that polices negligence led to the four deaths and injuries to half-a-dozen others. The road where the mines were planted is a busy one. How could the Maoists dig a 300-metre trench and lay cables without the police noticing? asked Jagannath Tudu, a resident of Hatidoba, a village half-a-kilometre from the blast site, about 235 km from Calcutta.

 The spot is 3 km from the medical camp that the police have set up at Barshone. Policemen had been going up and down the road for three days, Tudu added.

 The van blown up yesterday was returning from the medical camp organised as part of the polices public relations drive in Maoist strongholds. Its driver, a helper, a home-guard and a constable died on the spot. 

 A jeep carrying West Midnapore police chief Ajay Nanda from the camp had passed through the same spot. The police believe that he was the real target.

 Home secretary P.R. Roy maintained that the morale of the security personnel had not taken a beating. Asked if intelligence failure was to blame, he said: How can I say our intelligence is good when such incidents are happening so often?

 On the ground, the people were shaken. On February 2004, when the Belpahari blast killed eight people, I was in the following car. I had yanked out the bodies from the vehicle then. Today I cremated my brothers body. I cannot drive police cars anymore. Its too risky, said Anil Naik of Simla, who has been driving rental cars for the police since 1994.

 Signs of yesterdays tragedy were fresh when western range inspector-general Banibrata Basu visited the spot this morning. As Basu looked into the pit created by the explosion, a stray dog ran away with a human foot clenched between its teeth. 

 Parts of the jeep, packets of medicine supplies, bits of mobile phones, chairs and tables were interspersed with human flesh and body parts.

 Manju, the widow of Chandan Pramanik, the home-guard from Joypur, said the force had failed to protect her husband. 

 Basu admitted the intelligence failure.

 Sanjay Patra, 19, the sole survivor from the police team, is still having fits of fear. When the police cannot save their own men, what is the use of working for them? I wont go to any of their programmes again, said the boy from Gandapal village, who worked as microphone tuner.

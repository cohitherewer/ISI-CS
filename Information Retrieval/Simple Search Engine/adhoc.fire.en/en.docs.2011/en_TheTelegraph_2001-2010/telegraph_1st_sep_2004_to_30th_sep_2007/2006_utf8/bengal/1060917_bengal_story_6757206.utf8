 Small cut cure for aorta bulge

 SANJAY MANDAL

Calcutta, Sept. 16: When octogenarian R.N. Kar Roy first felt the pain in his abdomen, he ignored it as the regular indigestion. 

 When it persisted, he went through a series of tests. 

 Kar Roy was suffering from abdominal aortic aneurysm, a disease in which a portion of the aorta, the main artery of the chest and abdomen, develops a bulge.

 In the conventional process, Kar Roy would have had to undergo a major surgery. The mortality rate of the operation, doctors say, is 10 to 15 per cent and there are serious post-operative complications. 

 Kar Roy did not have to undergo the open surgery, thanks to the endovascular grafting technology. 

 The process involves repair of the aneurysm with stent grafts inserted through two small cuts in the groin, said Kunal Sarkar, a cardiac surgeon at Rabindranath Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences who was part of the team that conducted the three-hour operation. 

 The endovascular process is 25 times less stressful than the open surgery, he added. 

 The process is new and evolving. In India, less than 100 patients have been treated by this method, doctors said. 

 Aneurysm is a bulge that forms in the wall of a blood vessel, mostly in the elderly. 

 It is a result of an accumulation of fatty deposits on the wall, but may also relate to heredity, trauma or other diseases that weakens the wall, said Anil Mishra, the medical director at BM Birla Heart Research Institute. Over time, the vessel wall loses its elasticity and the force of normal blood pressure in the aneurysm can cause rupture.

 An aneurysm in the aorta is dangerous, Mishra said. 

 In most cases, the symp- toms of abdominal aortic aneurysm are pain or tenderness below the stomach, fall in appetite and frequent stomach upsets.

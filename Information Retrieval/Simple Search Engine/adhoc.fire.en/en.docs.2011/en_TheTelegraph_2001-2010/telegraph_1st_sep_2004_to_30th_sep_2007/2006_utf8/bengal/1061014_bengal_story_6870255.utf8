The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Rain rescue for power

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Oct. 13: The power situation looked up today because of reduced demand and increased supply, allowing the state electricity board and CESC not to resort to load shedding.

 In Calcutta, CESC said, there was no load shedding even in the peak hours but power cuts were reported from several parts. A CESC official attributed that to minor cable faults.

 During the evening peak period, the city required only 1,339 mw, compared with the normal demand of about 3,800 mw. 

 The overcast sky and light drizzle throughout the day contributed to the low demand, a power department official said. Moreover, we got more from the Damodar Valley Corporation and Durgapur Projects Ltd. 

 DVC, which had been supplying about 50 mw, contributed 250 mw today.

 The Orissa state electricity board doubled its supply to 93 mw. 

 The power department said all three plants at Bakreswar and six in Kolaghat operated in full swing, enabling the state power board to generate 1,700 mw. 

 Despite todays zero shortfall, power minister Mrinal Banerjee said the possibility of load shedding over the next few days remains. There can be a demand-supply mismatch and hence load shedding in some areas. But the situation is improving and there is no reason to worry. Things will look up in the next couple of days.

 He did not rule out the possibility of load shedding during Kali Puja next weekend.

 Banerjee expressed concern about coal supplies as part of the reserves had been washed away by rain. 

 The Coal India and Eastern Coalfields Ltd chairmen met the chief minister today.

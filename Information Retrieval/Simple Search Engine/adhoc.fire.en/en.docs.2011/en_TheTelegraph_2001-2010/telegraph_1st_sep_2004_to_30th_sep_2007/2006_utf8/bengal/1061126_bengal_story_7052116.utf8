The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Plan for trauma care across state

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Nov. 25: On May 14, Sankhya Ghosh, a bank employee, suffered a head injury after he fell from a rickshaw that was hit by a car in Salt Lake. 

 Ghosh was rushed to Apollo Gleneagles Hospital where he was diagnosed with a clot inside the brain and treated by a trauma care team. He is back at work now. 

 New concepts in trauma care and their proper implementation can save more lives and permanent disabilities. 

 The government is now planning to join hands with corporate hospitals to set up trauma care units. 

 The government has the financial and human resource. What is required is proper planning and infra- structure. A public-private partnership is being planned to set up these units, said Sanchita Ghosh, the director of health services. 

 The trauma-care units would be set up in the districts as well. 

 According to doctors, in a road accident, death is usually caused by injuries in the brain, chest and face.

 The brain receives the first impact at the time of accident. It is the second impact that can be prevented and which can save a life or a victim from becoming permanently disabled, said L.N. Tripathi, consultant neurosurgeon at Apollo Gleneagles and organising secretary of the third annual international symposium on neurosurgery being held in the city.

 After the first injury to the brain, it starts swelling and causes the blood pressure to rise. With proper medicine and intervention, this can be prevented, Tripathi said. 

 When a person is injured in the chest along with the brain, it makes the condition worse leading to formation of excess carbon dioxide and decreasing the oxygen level because of the victims inability to breathe properly, said Arijit Bose, chief of the trauma and emergency unit at the Apollo hospital.

 After a road accident, excessive bleeding, external or internal, can also cause the blood pressure to fall, which makes the head injury worse. 

 In Calcutta, there have been 420 road accident deaths this year. The number was 484 last year. 

 Lack of awareness is one of the main causes of road accidents, said Javed Shamim, the deputy commissioner of police, traffic. 

 Every day, around 400 cases are registered against people riding two-wheelers without helmets or speaking on mobile phones while driving.

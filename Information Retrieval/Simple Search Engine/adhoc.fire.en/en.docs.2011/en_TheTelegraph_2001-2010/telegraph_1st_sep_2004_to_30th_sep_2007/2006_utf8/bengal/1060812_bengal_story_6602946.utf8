 Japan study

 Calcutta, Aug. 11: The 

 government, which had earlier called off a feasibility study 

 for the Raichak-Kukrahati bridge by the Japanese, tried 

 to placate them today by offering another project.

 The Japan International Co-operation Agency (Jica) will take up a comprehensive study of the citys transportation system and draw a perspective plan for 2020.

 Funded by the Japan Bank for International Co-operation (JBIC), the study would begin in November this year and end in March 2007. 

 At a meeting chief secretary A.K. Deb had with JBIC and Jica officials, it was decided that the study would suggest projects to be taken up to improve the system. 

 The Japanese were miffed when the government called off the feasibility study being conducted by Jica since June and handed the bridge project to the Salim Group.

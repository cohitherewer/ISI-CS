 Trinamul not to beg for Opposition status

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, May 13: Mamata Banerjee has said the Trinamul Congress would not write to the Speaker seeking Opposition status.

 The party, which had 60 legislators in the outgoing House, managed to get only 29 seats in the just-concluded Assembly elections.

 To be recognised as the principal Opposition in the House, the Trinamul Congress should have got at least 30 seats ? 10 per cent of the total 294 legislators. Falling short of the required mark, the party will also not be entitled to table a no-confidence motion against the government.

 The Congress got 21 seats against 26 it had in the outgoing House.

 We are not beggars. As we do not have the requisite number of legislators to play the role of the principal Opposition in the House, we shall not seek any favour from the ruling CPM. Aamra rastar lok, rastatei thakbo (We are for the man of the street and so, we will continue to live on the street), Mamata told her aides today.

 Hours before she discusses the issue threadbare at a meeting tomorrow, the Trinamul Congress chief made it clear that her party would not write to the Speaker asking for Opposition status.

 Subrata Bakshi, Trinamul state president and newly elected MLA from Chowringhee, said Mamata did not want to approach the Speaker for Opposition status.

 We have accepted the peoples verdict. If the electorate has not entrusted us with the job of functioning as the principal Opposition, we shall not bow down to the CPM to seek its favour.

 However, Trinamul Congress sources said Mamata is waiting for the result of Tuesdays elections to the Bhatpara seat in North 24-Parganas. The elections could not be held during the third phase of polls on April 27 because of an Independent candidates death.

 The Trinamul Congress is confident of retaining Bhatpara. If the party retains the seat, its strength will automatically climb to 30, enabling it to be recognised as the principal Opposition, said Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay, Trinamul chief whip in the outgoing Assembly.

 Speaker Hashim Abdul Halim, however, said the Trinamul Congress would have to write to him requesting for Opposition status even it wins the Bhatpara seat. If the party does not write to the Speaker, how does he know about the name of the leader of legislature party? he asked. 

 Halim said he would not award Opposition status to Trinamul if it sticks to its decision of not informing me.

 Asked if the House will run without the Opposition, he replied in the affirmative. 

 He recounted that in 1982, he was instrumental in awarding the status of principal Opposition to the Congress legislature party though the party had bagged only 42 seats.

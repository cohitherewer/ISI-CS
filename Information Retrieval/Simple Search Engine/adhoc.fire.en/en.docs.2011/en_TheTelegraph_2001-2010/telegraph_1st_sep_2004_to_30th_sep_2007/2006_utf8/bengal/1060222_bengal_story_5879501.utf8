The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Fraud using Subhas name

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Feb. 21: A middle-aged man, tall and glib in both English and Bengali, presented himself as a close relative of transport minister Subhas Chakraborty and duped six youths of about Rs 6 lakh.

 Police arrested Subrata Chakraborty from his Dover Lane house for allegedly duping the residents of Ramnagar in Diamond Harbour after promising them lucrative jobs in public sector companies.

 He was produced in a court in Diamond Harbour, about 60 km south of Calcutta, as the complaints were lodged there and remanded in jail custody.

 The police clarified that Subrata has no relation with the minister.

 Well interrogate him to find out whether there are others whom he has cheated, South 24-Parganas superintendent of police S.N. Gupta said.

 Subrata has been working as a labour contractor at Raichak in the district since 2001. 

 The police said he became acquainted with some youths of Ramnagar and realised soon enough that they were looking for jobs desperately. 

 He told us that he was a close relative of the minister and could provide employment easily because of his conn-ections with top officials. But he told us it would cost money, said Dibakar Naiya. 

 Subrata took the money in instalments. We were so carried away that we never hesitated to give him the money, Naiya said. 

 A police officer said the youths paid him Rs 1 lakh each. 

 In December 2003, he arranged fake interviews for them in a city hotel. An officer said: Several months passed but there was no sign of any job. On February 10 this year, the youths wanted their money back. Subrata gave them cheques but they bounced.

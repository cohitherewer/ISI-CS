The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 SHORT TAKES

 Mongolkot: She might be riding pillion on her comrades motorcycles through four years and 11 months, but come elections and MLA Sadhana Mullick is on a bullock cart. 

 The CPM candidate from Mongolkot, Burdwan, is either campaigning on a cart or on foot. She cannot afford a faster ride because most of her poor voters cannot do so. Everyone knows that she isnt used to bullock carts, said Trinamuls Sheikh Abdul Bashed. But the CPM doesnt care. Yesterday, it organised a bullock cart rally. Sadhana said: Once elected, Ive a lot of work to do. I have to move fast, so I prefer motorcycles. 

 Durgapur: Like Congressmen 

 anywhere, Mrigen Pals ultimate desire was to get Soniaji 

 to seek votes for him. But the Congress candidate for Durgapur 

 2 had no luck. His target No. 2, film star-turned-MP Govinda, 

 has yet to respond. But Pal is hopeful. Ill wait till 

 May 1, he said. Campaigning for the May 3 polls close that 

 day.

 Calcutta: A contest of minstrels who match each others lyrics with wit and banter ? a dying folk art ? has seen a mini revival thanks to the polls. Niamat Sheikh, the Congress candidate for Hariharpara in Murshidabad has hired two kabials to campaign for him. One plays Sheikh and the other his rival. Needless to say, theres only one winner.

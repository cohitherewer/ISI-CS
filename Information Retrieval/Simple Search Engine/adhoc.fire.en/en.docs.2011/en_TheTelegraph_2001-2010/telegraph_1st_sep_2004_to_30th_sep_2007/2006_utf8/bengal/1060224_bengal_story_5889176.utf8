The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 EC recce again from March 1

 OUR BUREAU 

 Calcutta, Feb. 23: Not satisfied with the progress of electoral roll revision in Bengal, the Election Commission is sending 20 observers to the state on a third round of inspection to review the pre-poll scenario and execution of non-bailable warrants by the state government.

 More or less, the same set of observers are coming, said Debashis Sen, chief electoral officer.

 The observers will be touring from March 1 to March 7, before reporting to the EC at a meeting on March 9. They will also collect feedback from political parties and voters on the final electoral roll, which was published yesterday.

 The final list released saw 12.98 lakh names deleted, four times the 3.47 lakh deletions in 2004. After the second trip of EC observers in February, three lakh more names were deleted from the voter list.

 Officials said an additional observer would be sent to Calcutta to deal with the huge volume of complaints.

 The EC had earlier said that weeding out of false voters was far from satisfactory in municipal areas. It had also directed the government to take action against 19 officials for irregularities.

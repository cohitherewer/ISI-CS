The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 BRIEFS

 Jalpaiguri, Jan. 24: Police here claimed to have blown the lid off a racket that allegedly recruited youths for the KLO and sent them to Bangladesh for training. 

 Eight people, including Bhabesh Roy, a trained militant, were arrested. The police said Roy was trained in Bhutan before the Himalayan kingdom flushed out rebels from its territory in 2003.

 Krishnagar: A duo was held on Tuesday after a bid to cheat schoolteacher Balaram Das here in Nadia. Subir Haldar and Gobinda Dutta told Das that he had won Rs 10 lakh on a lottery ticket he bought last week and they would hand over the money if he paid Rs 10,000 for taxes. 

 Ranaghat: A jobless 23-year-old allegedly jumped into the Churni river from a bridge on NH 34 at Ranaghat, 65 km from Calcutta. His father had refused to let him marry minus a job.

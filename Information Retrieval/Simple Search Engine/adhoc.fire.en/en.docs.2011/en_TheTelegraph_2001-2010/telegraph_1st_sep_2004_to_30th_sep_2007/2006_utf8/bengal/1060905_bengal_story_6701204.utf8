The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Singur in pocket, search for Salim plot

 - Acquisition 

 notices for road before puja 

 A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta, Sept. 4: As land acquisition for the Tatas car factory at Singur is drawing to a close, the government is gearing up to begin before Puja its biggest takeover yet for the Salim Group.

 The government will issue land acquisition notices in North and South 24-Parganas for the 98-km Barasat-Raichak expressway. 

 Notices under Section IV (which says the government intends to acquire the land) of the Land Acquisition Act will be issued before the Pujas. The Salim Group has already paid Rs 50 crore to the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation (WBIDC) as advance, commerce and industries secretary Sabyasachi Sen said today.

 Plot identification along a 28-km stretch in North 24-Parganas and a 70-km one in South is almost complete, he added. All land deals in this 2,500-acre area have been frozen to prevent land sharks from jacking up the market rate.

 The Indonesian group has promised to complete the expressway within three years of getting possession of the land.

 At Singur in Hooghly, about 1,300 farmers have agreed to give away their land 422 acres voluntarily.

 On an average, we are getting 150 consent applications every day. At this rate, well get around 700 acres by consent. We have another 50 acres vested with the government. If we get around 800 acres without trouble, well declare the compensation for the rest regardless of whether they attend the hearing, a land reforms department official said. 

 The last date for the hearing of consent or objections to the compensation being offered by the government is September 18.

 The government needs to acquire around 993 acres for the Tata factory. 

 Consultants ILFS and Mott McDonald will prepare a master plan for Haldia before the government applies to the Centre to accord it petroleum, chemicals and petrochemical investment region (PCPIR) status. The plan, which will include details of the proposed effluent treatment facilities and other components of the mega chemical hub, will be ready in around six months.

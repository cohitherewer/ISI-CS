The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Good boy found dead

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Feb. 24: A Madhyamik candidate who was always studious but so tense that he had stopped talking to many was found dead in his house in Nadia with ants crawling all over him on the eve of his first board exam.

 Babu Sardar, 17, ranked among the toppers of his class in Majdia High School in Krishnagunj.

 His mother Suhasini and sister Putul, also a Madhyamik candidate from the same school, saw him going to the terrace of their house in Hanskhali, 70 km from Calcutta, around 1 pm. Babu had a bottle of water in hand and was apparently going there to study. 

 Putul went looking for him when he did not respond to his mothers calls even after 5 pm. He was lying dead. 

 Police said he must have died at least four hours earlier.

 Babus father Biswanath, a clerk at Krishnagunj block hospital, said he was a very good student, always studious. His school expected a good result from him. 

 He added: But he was so tense that he had stopped talking to us and even his friends.

 Babu had bronchial asthma. These days, he often skipped medicines. I used to scold him, Biswanath said.

 His eldest daughter is a high school teacher. People of the neighbourhood used to tell him that he had to do well like his sister, Biswanath said. 

 The police said Babu appa-rently died of a cardiac arrest caused by the tension, but nothing could be said for certain until the post-mortem report arrived. There were no injury marks, said Nadia superin- tendent R. Rajsekharan.

 Burdwan power cuts

 The state electricity boards appeal to farmers to operate irrigation pumps by night has fallen on deaf ears and examinees in Burdwan are bearing the brunt of power cuts.

 The power cuts began from the second week of February as the temperatures rose and the demand shot up to 300 mw a day. A power board official said: We have no alternative to resorting to loadshedding.

Calcutta, Dec. 23: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who arrived here this evening, told a Congress delegation that the rural development department was preparing a document on land use in the country.

 At Raj Bhavan, Singh also told the PCC leaders that he was aware of Mamata Banerjees fast and governor Gopal Krishna Gandhis visits to her sit-in dais.

 We told the Prime Minister that industries should not be set up at the cost of poor farmers, Congress legislature party chief Manas Bhuniya said after the meeting.

 The Bengal government is also preparing a land-use map.

 Earlier in the day, Mamata sent a letter to the governor alleging that 464 acres had been acquired by the government in Singur without the consent of landowners. 

 In a letter to the governor on Thursday, Trinamul had said that farmers had not given consent for 387 acres. 

 Today, I informed the governor that the figure had increased to 464 acres, Mamata said from her sit-in venue.

 Leader of Opposition Partha Chatterjee handed the Trinamul Congress chiefs letter to the governor at Raj Bhavan.

 Mamata claimed that the farmers who were unwilling to sell their land to the government had filed affidavits in court expressing their objection to the acquisition. The affidavits, she added, prove that the chief ministers claim to have obtained consent from 90 per cent of the owners is false. 

 How could Buddhababu say that owners had sold their land willingly? she asked.

 The chief minister is misleading the people.

 The government had earlier accused the Trinamul Congress of misleading people with exaggerated figures.

 The Trinamul chief said she would write to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh with a request to amend the land acquisition law to prevent indiscriminate conversion of agricultural land for industry.

 There has to be a balance in land use and the Centre should make the necessary changes to ensure that. Farmland cannot be converted at will and the Centre can promulgate an ordinance to protect fertile land, Mamata added. 

 MP Mukul Roy, however, said that Trinamul leaders would not seek an appoint- ment with Manmohan Singh. Mamatadi is a senior MP and Singh is well aware of the fact that she is on hunger strike. We will hand over the letter to him if he wants to meet us. 

 Squabbling continued to plague the state Congress with Union minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi and his associates boycotting todays executive committee meeting to discuss the partys Singur strategy.

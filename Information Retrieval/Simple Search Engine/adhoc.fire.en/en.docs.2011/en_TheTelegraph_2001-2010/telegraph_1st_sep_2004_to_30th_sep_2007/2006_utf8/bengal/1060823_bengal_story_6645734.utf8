The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 After fall, attendant for Basu

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Aug. 22: The CPM wants a trained nurse to accompany Jyoti Basu, especially at night.

 The 93-year-old leader tripped on the floor and injured his right hip and elbow while trying to switch off his bedroom fan early on Monday morning. 

 There was no serious damage, but Basu was advised bed rest after he felt pain.

 We shall take a decision on recruiting the attendant at Indira Bhavan at Fridays secretariat meeting, said Benoy Konar, a CPM state secretariat member. 

 Basu now sleeps in his bedroom alone, while his attendant and security guards stay in an adjoining room. 

 Konar, who visited Basu today, said he was better today and looked jolly but still has pain in his right hip.

 A physiotherapist helped Basu walk in his room today. 

 Although he takes his medicines himself, there must be somebody in his room to assist him at night, Konar said.

 Basus son Chandan had yesterday said he was worried because his father lives alone and refuses to move into his sons house, also in Salt Lake.

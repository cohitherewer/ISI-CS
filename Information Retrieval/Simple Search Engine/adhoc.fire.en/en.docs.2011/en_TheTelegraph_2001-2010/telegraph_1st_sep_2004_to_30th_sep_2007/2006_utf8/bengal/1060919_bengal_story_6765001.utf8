The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Laggard force in polio lapse

 ABHIJEET CHATTERJEE 

 Durgapur, Sept. 18: Forty health workers have been showcaused in Burdwan for not going door to door to motivate villagers to participate in the pulse polio programme.

 Among those asked to explain the dereliction of duty, 10 are supervisors and the rest field workers.

 Although no polio case was reported in Bengal in 2005, the World Health Organisation warned about poor coverage of the vaccine drive after the disease was detected in a girl at Suti, Murshidabad, two months ago. 

 An outbreak of the disease in western Uttar Pradesh has become a global threat, with the virus strain detected in neighbouring countries as well as in Africa. The UN recently labelled India the lone exporter of the disease in the world. 

 Bengal health officials said this is the first time that so many health department employees have been pulled up for neglecting the polio immunisation drive.

 The government is very serious about the pulse polio programme. We have intensified our drive since a polio case was detected in Asansol in 2004, an official said. 

 But over the past two years, the Burdwan health authorities have failed to administer the vaccine to as many children as they should have to meet a target fixed by the dist-rict health bosses. 

 The notices were issued after a probe, said Manzur Murshed, Burdwans chief medical officer. 

 District magistrate Subrata Gupta called an emergency meeting of health officials last month and pulled them up for falling behind the target. 

 We are repeatedly falling behind because a section of employees has been neglecting the door-to-door campaign, a health official said. 

 Those showcaused have also been accused of fudging statistics. They left out remote villages, Murshed admitted, but added that superstition and illiteracy were equally at fault for the failure to meet the target. 

 The Burdwan authorities had fixed a target of immuni-sing 7.4 lakh babies in every pulse polio programme. But in none of the drives in the past two years, health workers managed to make the mark.

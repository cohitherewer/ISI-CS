The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Chill on a comeback

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, 

 Dec. 9: Calcuttans who thought that winter was 

 over even before it arrived need not be worried.

 Met officials today said the minimum temperature would dip by about 2 degrees in the next 48 hours. Calcutta recorded a minimum temperature of 17.4 degrees Celsius on Saturday, 2 degrees above normal. But the conditions suggest that the minimum temperature will come down by about 2 degrees in a couple of days, an official of the Alipore Met office said.

 The city recorded a minimum of 12.6 degrees on December 4, but it started getting warmer because of a change in the wind flow. The north wind stopped blowing as moisture-laden winds swept north India from west to east a phenomenon known as the western disturbance, an official said.

 After the disturbance fiz-zled out, a cyclonic circulation formed over Bihar, north Bengal and Sikkim, blocking the north wind, which blows into Bengal from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Jharkhand.

 The cyclonic circulation, too, showed signs of weakening this evening, prompting the weatherman to forecast a dip in the temperature.

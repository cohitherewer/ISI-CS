 Blood row

 Midnapore, May 24: Citu workers heckled the superintendent of Jhargram Subdivisional Hospital today after blood pouches were found buried in a field that was being dug up.

 Sandip Sanyal tried to explain the union that the pouches had been disposed of past their expiry dates last August, but in vain. The unions Jhargram president, Arun Pal, accused Sanyal of denying blood to patients in need. We have done nothing wrong, Pal said later.

 The West Midnapore deputy chief medical officer gave a clean chit to Sanyal. The blood could not have been used and all papers are in order, he said.

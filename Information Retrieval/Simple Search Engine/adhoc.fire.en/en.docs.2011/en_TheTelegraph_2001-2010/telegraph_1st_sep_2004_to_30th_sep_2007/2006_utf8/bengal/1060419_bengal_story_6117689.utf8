 Krishnagar, April 18: The glut of bogus voters in Nadia and the arrest of several Bangladeshis, who had obtained school certificates as proof of their age and Indian nationality, has prompted the authorities to make birth certificates compulsory for primary school admission. 

 Five headmasters of Tehatta ? close to the border, 150 km from Calcutta ? and a schoolteacher of Chakdah, 60 km from Calcutta, were arrested last month for issuing certificates to about 100 Bangladeshis.

 They were issued over the past five-six years. The Bangladeshis have confessed to taking the certificates from these teachers, district magistrate Rajesh Pandey said. 

 The district authorities have now asked all 2,600 primary schools to enforce a rule ? that students panchayat or municipal birth certificates be produced at the time of admission ? that was not strictly followed earlier. 

 District primary school council chairman Bibhash Biswas said the headmasters issued the certificates to help students, not harm the nation.

 He added: Children in the villages often do not have birth certificates as they are born at home with the help of midwives. If the rule is strictly enforced, they will not be able to secure admission. 

 Monirul Sheikh, a farmer, whose daughters are in classes VI, VII and VIII at Karimpur Girls School, 180 km from Calcutta, said: I didnt have to furnish certificates when they were admitted. The school accepted the age I mentioned.

 Nadia is one of the worst performing districts in terms of primary education. 

 The insistence on certificates, an official admitted, might deter unlettered villagers from taking children to school.

 However, the administration is firm. We have received thousands of complaints about Bangladeshi voters with school certificates but have been able to arrest only about 100, the district magistrate said. 

 Anil Mondal, a daily wager of Chapra, is in a fix. When he went to the local school with his five-year-old son, the authorities demanded the boys birth certificate. I dont know where to get one, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Door-to-door to scale wall

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, March 18: Faced with a barrage of directives from the Election Commission regarding methods of poll propaganda, the CPM state committee today decided that a door-to-door visit would be the best and most effective means of campaign.

 The party, at its three-hour meeting and one attended by veteran politburo member Jyoti Basu, saw a consensus on the issue of holding mohalla meetings, small group meetings and knocks on the doors of voters as part of the election campaign.

 State CPM secretary Anil Biswas said that the 93-year- old Basu would also campaign for the party, despite failing health.

 At the state committee meet, Basu said: All past elections during the Left Front regime have been free and fair. EC gave certificates to this effect. Mamata Banerjee had said after the 2001 polls that her party would win.

 Asked whether Basu will campaign for the party, Biswas said: Who said Jyotibabu will not campaign? Taking note of his age, we have decided to use his services in Calcutta and its adjoining areas for poll campaign. Almost throughout todays meeting, he was there.

 The CPM state committee deliberated on the disadvantages it was facing because of the ongoing higher secondary examinations, particularly the fact that loudspeakers cannot be used till April 13. That leaves only two days for political parties to campaign for the first phase of polls in Purulia, Bankura and West Midnapore.

 Because of such disadvantages and the ban on posters and the use of public and private property for poll publicity, the party decided to carry photographs of candidates in election leaflets to be distributed among voters.

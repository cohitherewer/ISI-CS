The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 CM stress on better bomb busters

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Sept. 27: In the wake of last weeks blast that killed two callous bomb disposal squad members, the chief minister today asked the police brass to arrange training at national centres for personnel handling explosives. 

 At a meeting to review the incident in Lalgarh, West Midnapore, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee virtually admitted that training in explosives here was inadequate.

 They would return better informed from the national centres, the chief minister said.

 The police personnel could be sent to the NSG Training Institute at Manesar on the outskirts of Delhi or the Indo-Tibetan Border Police headquarters in Simla for advanced training. 

 Bomb squad members in Bengal are mostly given theoretical training now.

 We discussed the urgent need for specialised training, a senior officer said after the meeting, which chief secretary A.K. Deb, home secretary P.R. Ray, director-general of police A.B. Vohra and city police chief Prasun Mukherjee attended. 

 Vohra had said in a report that the Lalgarh blast occurred when callous and publicity-crazy policemen tried to re-enact for media crews the recovery of a can of explosives two hours after it had been taken to a police station for disposal. Among the injured were many media personnel.

 Security director A.K. Maliwal today conducted an awareness camp to make CID officers aware about the thumb rules for handling explosives .

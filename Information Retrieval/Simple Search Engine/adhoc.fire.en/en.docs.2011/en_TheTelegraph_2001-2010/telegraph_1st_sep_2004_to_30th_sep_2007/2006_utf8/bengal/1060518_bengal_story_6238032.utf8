 St Xaviers heads north

 Siliguri, May 17: The Jesuits chain of St Xaviers Colleges is setting up a degree college in Rajganj on the outskirts of Siliguri.

 The co-educational college, affiliated to North Bengal University, will come up on a 30-acre plot at Rajganj, about 20 km from Siliguri, in Jalpaiguri district. 

 Construction ? the building, complete with a Gothic fa?ade, is expected to cost about Rs 2.5 crore ? is scheduled to start in July. We plan to begin classes from the 2007-2008 academic session, said Father Cherian Padiyara, the director of the upcoming college. 

 The initial plan was to start classes in a temporary set-up in Matigara this year, he said, but the early declaration of elections put paid to the idea. 

 We will begin with undergraduate courses in humanities and commerce, others will be added subsequently, Padiyara said. The college will eventually have three departments ? humanities and arts (fine and performing), commerce and management, and science and technology. The institution is being planned on the lines of a small university, which will cater to about 8,000 students. We are aiming at autonomy in the long term, he said. 

 The St Xaviers colleges in Calcutta and Ranchi have been granted autonomy.

 It was the dearth of quality education in north Bengal that made the Jesuits, who also run St Josephs College, Darjeeling, come up with the idea of having another college catering to the region. 

 A large number of students leave this place every year in search of better opportunities, Padiyara said.

 Calcutta, Delhi and Bangalore are the preferred destinations.

 The courses on offer will be job-oriented. Before deciding on the college, we conducted a survey among students of classes XI and XII. Based on their preferences, we have modelled our courses, he said.

 The students surveyed have shown a preference for emerging and relevant courses like BCom in sales and marketing, BA in travel and tourism management, mass communication and journalism, human resource management and BSc in medical lab technology, tea plantation, rural development, agriculture and farming. Other than degree courses like these, the college will also offer diploma and certificate programmes.

 All courses will be self-financed but we will try and charge fees at affordable rates. There will also be programmes for drop-outs and poorer sections of the society, he said.

 Xavier Educational Society of North Bengal has been set up with the objective of establishing educational institutions to provide quality education in north Bengal, with particular focus on the Siliguri-Jalpaiguri urban belt and Jalpaiguri and Cooch Behar districts, Padiyara said.

 He said the location ? on the banks of the Kortowa river near Hatimore (Balaigach) in Rajganj block ? was chosen because it is mid-way between the twin cities of Siliguri and Jalpaiguri. Students of both places will be able to reach the campus conveniently, he added.

 Padiyara said parents have already started inquiring. Because of our survey in the schools, the parents got a whiff of our plans and they have started phoning us to know our plans and are also asking us to hurry up, he said.

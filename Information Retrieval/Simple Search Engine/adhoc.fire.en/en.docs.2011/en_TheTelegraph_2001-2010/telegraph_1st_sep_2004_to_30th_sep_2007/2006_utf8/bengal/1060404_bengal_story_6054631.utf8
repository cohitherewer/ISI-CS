 Krishnagar, April 3: Three villages ringed by a river on three sides and a 10-km stretch of forest in the north have only a wooden bridge ? or rather its skeletal remains ? as their lone link to the outside world. 

 Pregnant women and students have slipped through its planks and patients have died mid-way, but no one really cares about the 100-ft bridge that connects Krishnagar-II block with the rest of the country.

 Class IX student Asima Dutta is still in hospital. She fell last month on her way to school for her annual exams. Her father Harala Dutta said: She almost died. 

 The resident of Sadhan-para, an affluent farmer, has decided to shift his family to Dhubulia, where he now goes to see his daughter, lying in a hospital bed.

 He has had enough of the daily dose of adventure. Although Dutta will not live there any more, he has made up his mind to not vote this year ? in protest. So have the 3,000 other voters from the three villages. 

 The 5,000-odd villagers have been clamouring for a proper bridge across the Ghurghuti (a tributary of the Bhagirathi) for three decades. 

 MLAs and block development officers have come and gone but this pocket of Krishnagar (West) constituency has remained the same. 

 The bridge, constructed by the local panchayat 40 years ago, connects Rakhalgachhi, Sadhanpara and Natunpara with Muragachha in Dhubulia, 15 km away. Dhubulia, a small town, is 120 km from Calcutta. 

 With the bridge virtually falling apart, the residents are all but cut off from the rest of the district. The Ghurghuti hems them from the south, east and west. On the north, lies the Bharatpur forest. 

 The only way to cross the forest ? and catch a bus to Dhubulia on national highway 34 ? is on foot or on a two-wheeler. About 1,000 students have to cross the bridge like trapeze artistes to attend high school there. 

 In the past six months, 60 students fell in the river and some 20 women in labour were forced to give birth on the road. 

 Suddhodhan Sarkar, Sujan De and Pannalal Mukherjee, who are in classes V, VI and VIII, were not able to write their annual exams. How could he? His hands were broken. A man bathing in the river saved him, said his father Nemai, a fruit grower. 

 Rita Das, 35, had a lucky escape in January. Unable to take her across the bridge to the health centre ? 4 km away ? I constructed an enclosure under a mango tree with the help of other villagers. The women acted as midwife? we live far from civilisation, said her husband Shankar.

 The CPM, which dominates the area, pleaded helplessness, but one of its leaders said he was ashamed. The administration appears to be sleeping. We can neither support the poll boycott, nor criticise it. We feel ashamed that the government could not build a small bridge in decades, said Nilmani De, a local committee member. 

 The joint block develop-ment officer of Krishnagar-II, A.K. Mondal, said that for unknown reasons, the bridge has never been on the priority list. We know that the villagers have decided not to vote. But we cant construct the bridge overnight.

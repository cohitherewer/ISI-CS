The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Biman takes a last shot

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, April 15: Less than 48 hours before polling is to begin in Bengal, CPM secretary Biman Bose said voters would give a fitting reply to the Election Commissions insulting decision to hold five-phase polls in the state.

 At Calcutta Press Club, Bose, also the Left Front chairman, said law and order in Bengal did not warrant a staggered poll. Crime figures show that Bengal is far better than other states and (the) EC should have considered this before preparing the schedule.

 He also pointed out that the poll panel had taken the trouble of consulting political parties of Tamil Nadu before deciding whether to have split elections there but not in Bengal. Our state has a culture and people will give the right answer to Opposition parties. (The) EC might be entertaining trivial complaints of the Trinamul, BJP and Congress, but that will not be a problem for the front. 

 The high voter turnout in some places ? which the Opposition says is a sign of Left manipulation ? indicate the peoples willingness to vote, Bose said. 

 If there is 80-85 per cent polling, it indicates willingness of voters to make their voice and choice known to the political parties. There is nothing wrong with it. People will come to vote with photo identity cards. So, a high turnout would mean greater participation of people in polls. 

 If there is repolling in a booth in Bengal, Bose added, people would turn up in greater numbers to protest against the insult meted out to them. If (the) EC cannot repose faith in the polling process, people would naturally feel insulted. Hence, more voters would come to cast their votes, the CPM leader said.

 After the poll panel, the Maoists have been the Marxists enemy No. 1. Bose said people in Purulia, Bankura and West Midnapore should vote disregarding the presence of the so-called Maoists.

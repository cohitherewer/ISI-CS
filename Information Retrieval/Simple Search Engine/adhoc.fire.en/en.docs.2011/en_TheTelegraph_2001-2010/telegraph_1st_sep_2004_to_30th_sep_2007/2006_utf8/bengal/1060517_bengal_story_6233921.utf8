The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Son shown the door for Cong switch

 ALAMGIR HOSSAIN

 Behrampore, May 16: Even in early April, Wahab Sarkar had a happy family, his wife, four sons and their wives living together in his single-storey house.

 All thats past. Wahab, 60, a well-off farmer, will not have his second son at home ? because the Congress candidate won the election from Naoda, not the RSPs. 

 At Gangadhari village, 235 km from Calcutta, Wahabs family had been a staunch Left supporter and the male members all RSP workers, until Moslem ditched them. 

 Till mid-April, Wahab and his four sons had campaigned for the RSPs Jayanta Biswas.

 Moslem, 35, the village tailor, switched loyalties suddenly and joined Congressman Abu Taher Khans campaign caravan.

 The furious father stopped talking to his son. How could he break rank and side with the arch-rival? 

 Moslems brothers were also angry. 

 But the election result, declared last Thursday, proved the last straw. Moslems candidate had won over his familys.

 The father and son would often cross each others path during the campaign. While canvassing door-to-door in and around our village, Wahab and Moslem would often come across each other and exchange angry words on the road, said Anarul Mollah, 35, of Gangadhari village. 

 But Moslem, who earned Rs 25 to 30 a day from his tailoring jobs, continued to live in his fathers house with his wife and one-and-a-half-year-old daughter. 

 The semblance of peace was blown to pieces when Wahab exploded on the evening of May 11. Get out of my house, he said. Ill not have anything to do with a Congress worker.

 Our family has been supporting the RSP for the past three decades. I was very angry with Moslem when he joined the Congress. Now that the RSP candidate has lost, there is no question of keeping him in the family, Wahab said today. 

 He has 25 bighas of land and the family survives on it. His other sons ? Noor Islam, 38, Babar Ali, 32, and Abul Hossain, 30 ? did not protest when Moslem was thrown out. On May 12, Moslem left, the sewing machine on his shoulder, his wife by his side and daughter in her arms.

 A large number of villagers gathered in front of Wahabs house and some of them even requested him to call his son back. It didnt work.

 We knew about the feud between the father and son. But we never realised that it would come to such a pass, said Bablu Sheikh, a villager.

 Moslem had nowhere to go. Khaleq Sheikh, a Congress leader, gave him shelter in his own house.

 I am an adult and I am free to voice my opinion.... I am happy that the Congress candidate has won for the second time in a row here. I will continue as a tailor and work hard to support my family, he said, defiant in the face of adversity.

 MLA Abu Taher today promised to help Moslem. I have heard about him. I will go to the village and find out what I can do, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Cops hunt for known caller

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 The police sketch of the 

 youth with whom Ghosh left his chamber

Calcutta, March 11: Sleuths probing the murder of the Salt Lake doctor, Jayanta Ghosh, now believe that the youth who called up his wife on Monday afternoon ? to say her husband would be late to return home ? was probably known to him.

 The owner of the booth in Kalyani from where the call was made has claimed that the youth looked up the number in his mobile phone.

 He came on a cycle and made the call after waking up the booth owner from his siesta. He was smart enough not to use his mobile to make the call as it would have made the polices task of tracing him easier.

 The mobile number is crucial to the case. We are yet to make out whether he called anyone else after dialling the Ghoshes, said D.P. Tarenia, a CID inspector-general. 

 The doctor, who left his north Calcutta chamber on Monday afternoon with a youth who came in a Maruti and waited for over an hour, was found with his throat slit on a bridge on the Mayurakshi in Murshidabad. Clad in pyjama-panjabi, Ghosh was alive when farmers noticed him on Tuesday morning. He died while trying to speak to the police. 

 The evening before, his wife Anima, a gynaecologist, had received the call from Kalyani. She also received a ransom call minutes after her husband had passed away.

 The police have sought details of all calls made from the area covered by the particular tower in Gayeshpur, Kalyani. 

 They have also decided to speak to Ghoshs relatives for some clarifications. 

 Yesterday, it was the turn of elder brother Prasanta, at whose Belgachhia house he had lunch almost every day. 

 We spoke at length but it seemed that the police are more concerned to make out why four brothers stayed in separate houses and how Jayanta built such a big house in Salt Lake. There was no word on how far they have progressed with the probe. It is amazing to know that CID sleuths are still to find a proper lead after so many days Prasanta said.

 The police are not speaking in detail about the investigation and are also not apparently reading too much into the threat call from Nashik to the Kalyani phone booth yesterday. It was an attempt to divert our attention. We are zeroing in on Kalyani, a senior officer said.

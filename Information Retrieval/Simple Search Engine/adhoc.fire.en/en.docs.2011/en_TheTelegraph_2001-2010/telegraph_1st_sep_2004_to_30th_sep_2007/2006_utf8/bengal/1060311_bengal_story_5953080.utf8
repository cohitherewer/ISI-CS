The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Police pariah on rebel turf

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Dangardiha (Belpahari), March 10: The residents of the Maoist strongholds are running from police, who had launched a public relations drive in a desperate bid to create a rapport with them.

 CPM supporters Gumai Tudu and Jaladhar Mahato were hacked to death in front of their relatives on Wednesday night ? because they hobnobbed with the police and allegedly tipped them off about two girl guerrillas who were arrested last month.

 In the kangaroo court the Maoists held that night, Sat-yanath Soren was beaten up for a similar offence. The other residents of Dangardiha in West Midnapore, 250 km from Calcutta, were told that they could all meet the same end as Tudu and Mahato.

 We are very scared of the police. We dont want them here. We dont want anything to do with them, said Chapala Mahato. I saw how Anchala (Jaladhars wife) and Rani (Gumais) became widows.

 At Dangardiha, the police have set up a primary school and created a football ground for villagers. But the residents see no good in the work.

 We have told the police to wind up the school and take back the football ground. We simply want to leave in peace, said Baren Murmu, from whose house the Maoists had called out Gumai on Wednesday night.

 It was on the polices insistence that the residents of Dangardiha and neighbouring Tamajuri and Birji had hoisted the Tricolour on Republic Day despite a Maoist boycott call. They regret it now. 

 We had hoisted the national flag as the police had asked us to do so. Now we will also be bracketed with Dangardiha. The Maoists will think we are also keeping in touch with the police, said Banthu Sabar of Tamajuri.

 West Midnapore superintendent Ajay Nand admitted that this was the kind of fear psychosis the Maoists wanted to create. They want to isolate us from the villagers. The villagers are playing into their hands, he said.

 Central Reserve Police Force jawans guarded Dangardiha last night. We are also combing the jungles around the village, Nand said.

 Around 2 am today, the rebels blasted a landmine near a Lalgarh village, 200 km from Calcutta. They were probably testing their explosives, said Gangeswar Singh, the Midnapore range deputy inspector-general of police. 

 Poll promise

 Chief electoral officer Debasish Sen visited Belpahari to oversee poll preparations. 

 He asked the residents of Chakadoba, about 15 km from Dangardiha, whether they knew the election date. Security, Sen assured, is our responsibility.

 Molest charge on OC

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, May 6: The officer-in-charge of Krishnagunge police station, Tuhin Biswas, has been accused of molesting a minor girl who was in his custody.

 The 16-year-old and her brother-in-law, Tapan Biswas, had gone missing on April 3 from Krishnagunge in Nadia. She was found at Hanskhali, about 75 km from Calcutta, around 11 yesterday morning and kept in the Krishnagunge police station lock-up. Tapan was arrested on the charge of abducting a minor.

 When the girl was produced before chief judicial magistrate (CJM) D.P. Biswass court in Krishnagar this morning, she told him that Tuhin had molested her last night. The OC called me to his chamber and asked me to undress. When I protested, he molested me and also assaulted my brother-in-law in front of me, she said.

 The CJM has asked Nadia superintendent of police R. Rajsekharan to start an investigation against the OC and submit a report to him immediately. The probe has to be conducted by an officer not bellow the rank of a deputy superintendent of police, he said.

 The girl has been sent to the state-run destitute home in Krishnangar and will be taken to a government hospital tomorrow for a test.

 The magistrate recorded the statement of the girl. However, the abduction case will continue separately, said Bikash Mukherjee, the girls lawyer. 

 Asked about the charges against Tuhin, Rajsekharan said he is yet to receive the details of the court order. But there will be an impartial inquiry and stern action will be taken against the OC if he is proved guilty. 

 The OC, however, refused to comment.

 The girls elder brother, Shankar, said it was unthinkable that a policeman had molested his sister in the lock-up in the name of giving her shelter for the night. 

 Its true that we had lodged a complaint with the police last month when my sister went missing with our brother-in-law. But we demand exemplary punishment for the OC for his indecent behaviour, Shankar said.

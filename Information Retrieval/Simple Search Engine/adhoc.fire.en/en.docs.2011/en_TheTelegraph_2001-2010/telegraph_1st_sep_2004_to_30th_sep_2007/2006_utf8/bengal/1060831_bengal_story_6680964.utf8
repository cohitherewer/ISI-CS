The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Now, BJP will fight Mamata

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Aug. 30: After Mamata threw her weight behind the Congress in Malda, her ally BJP today decided to back a Trinamul Congress rebel in Bongaon. 

 The Malda Lok Sabha seat and the Bongaon Assembly seat are going to the polls on the same day September 16.

 Gopal Seth, son of Trinamul MLA Bhupen Seth whose death necessitated the bypoll, filed his nomination today as an Independent. 

 This is our tit-for-tat policy. We shall campaign for Gopal to ensure the Trinamul nominees defeat in Bongaon, BJP general secretary Rahul Sinha said.

 Gopal had yesterday branded Trinamul nominee Saugata Roy, a south Calcutta resident, an outsider in the North 24-Parganas constituency. Roy, who lost his Dhakuria seat in May, is seeking rehabilitation far from his base in a constituency where Trinamul is believed to be strong.

 Sinha alleged that Mamata had done injustice to Gopal by denying him a ticket. Gopal was promised nomination from Bongaon after his fathers death. But Mamata picked Roy in her usual whimsical style. 

 State BJP president Tathagata Roy said over the phone from Delhi that the party would also campaign against the Trinamul nominee for the Katwa Lok Sabha seat. Well decide tomorrow whether to back the Janata Dal (United) candidate for Purulia, he added.

 Mamata, who had earlier fielded her candidate in Purulia, withdrew him after Congress general secretary Margaret Alva spoke to her last night. Congress sources said Alva welcomed Mamatas decision to back the Congress in Malda. She also apparently requested Mamata to return to her parent party, the Congress. 

 If youd aligned with us before the Assembly polls, snapping ties with the NDA, both of us would have fared better, sources quoted Alva as telling the Trinamul chief.

 Mamata, who met party functionaries in the evening to discuss strategy for the September bypolls, declined comment on the BJP.

 A senior Trinamul leader said: Were not bothered about what the BJP is doing. The party has no existence here. Mamata will campaign for the Congress in Malda and we want state Congress leaders to reciprocate by doing so for us in Bongaon.

 The Congress, however, ruled out a joint campaign with Trinamul. Mamata has not yet officially snapped her ties with the BJP-led NDA, state party working president Pradip Bhattacharya said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 CM wipes students tears

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 3: Cricket had made him shake with rage, kids brought him close to tears.

 A far cry from his belligerent self a day after the CAB election, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today displayed his softer side as one child after another narrated their tales of woe.

 Dont cry. You dont have to be ashamed just because you are poor. Here, look at me, he told 16-year-old Tanai Yadav.

 The daughter of a milkman, Tanai wants to be a neurologist. She had scored 743 in Madhyamik and is studying science at Ukhra Kunjabihari Institute.

 My school is 18 km from my house. My fathers monthly income is Rs 600. I cannot attend school daily as we cannot afford the Rs 12 bus fare everyday. My schoolmates make fun of me because Im poor, she sobbed.

 The chief minister comforted her, saying: Ill find you a tutor wholl teach you for free. 

 Next, it was the turn of a rickshaw-pullers daughter. Beauty Mondal studies BSc (Maths) in a college 8 km from her house in Bongaon, North 24 Parganas. Our family is too poor to afford electricity. Since childhood, Ive studied by a lantern. Can you bring us electricity? the 18-year-old asked Bhattacharjee.

 He promised her subsidised power under the below-poverty-line quota.

 Beauty also said her father could not afford a private tutor who charged a monthly fee of Rs 800. The chief minister was aghast. Tutors charge Rs 800! In my college days, our teachers would coach us at their homes after class. They never thought of charging, neither did we even dream of paying anything, he said, adding that the government would fund her tuition fees as well.

 The girls were among 63 poor but meritorious students who were handed cheques of Rs 5,000 each by the chief ministers secretariat. This money is just a preliminary amount. Let us know when you need more. We will fund you until your studies are over. But you have to do well and make us proud, Bhattacharjee said.

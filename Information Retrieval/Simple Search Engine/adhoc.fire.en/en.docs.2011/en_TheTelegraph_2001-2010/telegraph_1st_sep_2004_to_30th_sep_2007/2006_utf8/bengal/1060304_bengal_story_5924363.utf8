The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Bar on 115 schools for teachers to-be

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 3: The high court today asked 115 primary teachers training institutes in the state not to admit students as they are not registered with the National Council for Teachers Education. 

 In an interim order, the division bench of Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurkar and Justice A.K. Ganguly also asked the West Bengal Board for Primary Teachers Education not to hold exams for students already enrolled and to stop issuing certificates to passouts.

 According to the National Council for Teachers Education Act, 1993, permission from the council to run such institutes is mandatory. But out of the 131 government-affiliated primary teachers training institutes in Bengal, only 16 have obtained the registration.

 Certificates obtained by those who have completed the one-year course offered by these institutions would not be taken into consideration during recruitment, the court said.

 The order has put the school education department, which runs about 50,000 primary schools, and 11,500 teacher job aspirants in a spot. 

 The court today said stud-ents of the unregistered institutions could continue to study at their own risk.

 For primary school teacher jobs, a certificate from a recognised training institute is essential. 

 There are about 1.75 lakh such teachers in the state and the government appoints over 22,000 every year. 

 In 2000, the government enacted the West Bengal Primary Education Act empowering the board of primary education to grant affiliations to institutions offering one-year primary teachers training courses. Accordingly, new institutes were given affiliations, Debasish Kargupta, the additional government pleader, told the court. 

 However, Dipankar Dutta, the counsel for the petitioner, Tulsi Bakshi, submitted that it was mandatory for the institutions to be registered with the council before starting their training course. 

 According to the NCTE (National Council for Teachers Education), duration of any teachers training course should be two years. But here, the institutions are running one-year courses, Dutta said.

 He added that the National Council for Teachers Education Act clearly states that half the students in any primary teacher training institution should be taught free of cost. Here the institutions do not bother to follow the rule.

 Bakshi had earlier moved a separate PIL before the high court challenging the validity of basic training courses conducted by institutions under North Bengal University that did not have the council registration. 

 The same division bench had then asked the university to stop allowing the institutions to continue the courses.

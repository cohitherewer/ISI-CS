The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Torrent of tears follows killer storm

 SAMARPAN DUTTA

 Mathurapur, Sep 21: For the Purkaits and the Mondols of Mathurapur, the inception of Devipaksha could not have been grimmer.

 Durga Puja is round the corner, but the residents of this coastal belt in South 24-Parganas have little reason to cheer. 

 As yesterdays ravenous rainstorm left deaths and destruction in its wake, the living are struggling to survive.

 The toll went up to 20 in the state today with two more deaths reported from Usthi in South 24-Parganas.

 Madan and Soma Purkait lost their eight-year-old son Nilanjan, who they used to call Chhotu at home. 

 A resident of Mathurapurs Rajapur area, Madan was sleeping with Nilanjan by his side when the roof of their hut gave way. 

 One of the bamboo pillars supporting the structure came crashing down on his (Nilanjans) neck, killing him on the spot. My son was a Class II student of the local Rambati School. I had planned big for him. I wanted him to go to Calcutta for higher studies and would work extra time to earn more, sobbed Madan, who works as a security guard in a local factory.

 His mother Soma keeps rushing back to the debris that her home has become to dig out things her son would use, said her neighbours who have offered shelter to the couple. 

 In neighbouring Sitagachhi, Tusharkanti Mondol had a traumatic time trying to pull out the body of his father Surjyakanta from the rubble. The 70-year-old was crushed under the debris of his mud hut as it caved in last night.

 Surjyakanta used to sleep alone in a small separate hut adjacent to Tusharkantis. When the storm struck, I heard him calling me, but I was busy trying to plug the holes in the roof of my hut. Barely a few minutes later, I heard a thud and my fathers hut had collapsed, Tusharkanti said.

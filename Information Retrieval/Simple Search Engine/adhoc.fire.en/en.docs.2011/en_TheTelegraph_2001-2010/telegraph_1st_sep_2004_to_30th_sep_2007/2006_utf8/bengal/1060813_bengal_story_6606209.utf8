The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Green lock on 5 hotels

 JAYANTA BASU

 Calcutta, Aug. 12: The West Bengal Pollution Control Board has ordered immediate closure and disconnection of electricity in five hotels on the Mondermoni beach for alleged violation of environmental norms. 

 The hotels in East Midnapore are some 10 km from Shankarpur, which is frequented by beach-loving tourists. 

 Three of the hotels Rose Valley Resort, Oswal Vyapar and Samudra Sakhi are under construction, while Samudra Vilas and Tarangamala are complete and running. 

 The order, issued by the pollution boards senior law officer, Biswajit Mukherjee, said the hotels were constructed without obtaining consent from the board either for establishing or operating in the area. 

 It is mandatory to obtain such permits under environment regulations.

 During an inspection in mid-July, the hotels were found to be operating without adhering to environmental norms, the order said. 

 The inspection was carried out on a directive from state environment minister Mohanta Chatterjee, who received complaints about the hotels during a Digha trip in July.

 The hotels had flouted another norm. A senior state board official said all five are situated perilously close to the sea. This violates coastal area regulations, which bar construction within 200 metres of the high tide point. 

 There could be potential risk to tourists at Mondermoni as high tide inundates the area. There is almost no way out in an emergency. With the memories of tsunami still fresh, this cannot be allowed, a pollution control board official said.

 So, the Ramnagar police station, under whose jurisdiction the hotels fall, was directed to execute the closure order and submit a compliance report to the state board in seven days.

 The secretary of the West Bengal State Electricity Board was also asked to take immediate steps for disconnecting electricity. 

 Mondermoni, known for aquaculture, became a tourist attraction in 2002 after Samudra Vilas came up, followed by Tarangamala this year.

 We never knew that permission from the state pollution control board was required. We only took permission from the gram panchayat, said Debdulal Mahapatra, the owner of Tarangamala.

 A representative of Samudra Vilas said the hotel would take legal recourse if it is closed down. 

 The hotels denied receiving any formal commun- ication from the pollution control board and added that room reservations were on.

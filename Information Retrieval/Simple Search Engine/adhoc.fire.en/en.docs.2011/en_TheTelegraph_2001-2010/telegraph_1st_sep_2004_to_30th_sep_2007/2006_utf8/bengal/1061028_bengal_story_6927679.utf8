The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Enforce law, says court

 - Tuition ban or pollution bar: govt is sleeping

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, Oct. 27: The high court today told the government to enforce the ban on private tuition by schoolteachers.

 Five unemployed young men from Murshidabad had moved court saying schoolteachers were still giving private lessons, ruining their chances. 

 A code of conduct for teachers of state-aided and sponsored schools was published in the government gazette of December 2004. 

 According to the code, effective from January 2005, teachers cannot offer any kind of coaching anywhere outside classrooms. Depending on the gravity of the misconduct, the penalty may vary from suspension to a freeze on increments or even dismissal. 

 But teachers are still giving private tuition. We have lodged complaints with the directorate of secondary school education, the (Murshidabad) inspector of schools and school managing committees, but nothing has worked, the petitioners told the division bench of Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurkar and Justice N. Patheriya. 

 Even the education department has turned a blind eye to the complaints, alleged Arindam Mukherjee, the lawyer for the petitioners. 

 The ban was imposed to ensure teachers devoted more time and energy to classrooms. 

 The lawyer said his clients were educated, unemployed youths. They can earn some money from private tuition. But guardians are now being forced to send their children to schoolteachers.

 In January, the high court had asked the education department to conduct a probe and file a report in four weeks. But no such report has yet been submitted. When the case came up today, the government counsel said he had not received any instruction from the department regarding the report.

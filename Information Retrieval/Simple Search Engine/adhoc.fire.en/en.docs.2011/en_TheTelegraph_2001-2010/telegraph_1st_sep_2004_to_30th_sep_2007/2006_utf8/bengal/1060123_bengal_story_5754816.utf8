The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Farm wing in factory praise

 SANJAY MANDAL

 Calcutta, Jan. 22: Having declared industrialisation its strongest campaign plank for the Assembly polls, the CPM has decided to use its farmers wing to explain the need to take over farmland for industry.

 Leaders of the Paschimbanga Krishak Sabha, who had waxed eloquent on farmers right to their land over the years, will now spearhead the mission to convince peasants to give away their plots for cash.

 Land acquisition for industrial units will bring hard cash to farmers who own fallow or monocrop land, said a farmer leader.

 His comrades will also tell farmers that fertile and multi-crop land will not be touched. CPM leaders, including chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, have said this time and again but the effect of it coming from the farmers own people, the leadership feels, will be different. 

 CPM members in the 35,000 village committees in 38,000 villages have been told to visit individual households to clear doubts about land acquisition. 

 The Krishak Sabha supports the takeover of land for industrialisation, said Samar Baora, the general secretary of the organisation. 

 The village committees have been provided guidelines on how to highlight the benefits of industry. The Krishak Sabha members are telling farmers that new opportunities are set to open up for them. 

 Acquisition of farmland for industry became an emotive issue last year as the government began scouting for land for a Salim Group project in South 24-Parganas. 

 A section of the CPM and the Left Front partners protested the move. Land and land reforms minister Abdur Rezzak Molla, a CPM leader from South 24-Parganas, was himself a major roadblock for the governments plans. He came around after much persuasion.

 Bhattacharjee had to assure farmers in a rally in the district that only fallow and mono-crop land would be acquired and those who lose plots would be adequately compensated. 

 Kicking off their poll campaign at the Brigade on January 8, CPM leaders had said the central point of the pitch would be industrialisation, but also pledged that the rush for factories and towns would not result in Bengal losing fertile land.

 Peasant leaders are now touring villages to tell farmers that their families cannot be farming for generations on end. Why can the sons, daughters and relatives of farmers not work in industries? 

 Mamata Banerjee has al-ready begun using the issue to try and dent the CPM vote bank. She is telling people that if the front returns to power, it would unveil a massive land-grab drive. Rural Bengal accounts for 56 per cent of the Assembly seats.

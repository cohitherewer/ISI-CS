 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, July 26: The Trinamul Congress 

 has accepted the Speakers offer to be the principal 

 Opposition party.

 Its legislature party chief, Partha Chatterjee, 

 would be the leader of the Opposition and enjoy cabinet 

 rank. At least 30 seats are required for the status in the 

 293-member House, but Trinamul got it in spite of having 

 29 seats. The party had made it to the mark, but fell short 

 as its Bongaon MLA died. The Congresss Gyan Singh 

 Sohanpal will head the public accounts committee. 

 Calcutta: Richard Boucher, the US assistant 

 secretary of state for South and Central Asia, will be here 

 on August 3 and 4. Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee could meet him 

 on Day II. 

 Calcutta: The chief minister has requested the Centre to involve the Bengal government in all future discussions on trade through Nathu-la, the industries minister said in the Assembly. Nirupam Sen added that the scope of trade through the pass is now limited as only 100 Sikkim- based traders have been given licence to export 29 items. The Chinese would export 15.

 Midnapore: Citu-ba- cked men contracted to clear ash from the Kolaghat power station gheraoed its workers and officers on Wednesday. They were protesting against the authorities alleged reluctance to clear the ash pond, 60 km from Calcutta, more frequently.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Haldia focus on US mission

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, 

 May 26: Two bureaucrats preceding Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee 

 to the US will showcase Bengals business potential, 

 especially in petrochemicals for which several other states 

 are also sending representatives.

 Chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb and commerce and industries secretary Sabyasachi Sen will interact with 28 top chemical and petro-chemical companies in White Springs, West Virginia.

 There will be another meeting in Washington with members of the National Association of Manufacturing ? which represents all big US companies ? where talks will revolve around leather, steel, engineering and food processing.

 The other states invited to the conference include Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Gujarat. Each state will be given around 15 minutes to showcase its investment opportunities. We will make a presentation on the proposed chemical hub at Haldia, Sen said today.

 The conference is being organised by The NRI Group, which includes Purnendu Chatterjee and Rajat Gupta and is part of the Prime Ministers task force hunting for foreign investments. 

 Officials from the ministry of chemicals and petrochemicals will attend the conference.

 The US consul-general in Calcutta, Henry Jardine, has promised to arrange two more meetings with the US investment commission and the trade administration on June 8 and 9.

 During their trip, Sen and Deb intend to do the groundwork for the chief ministers visit later this year.

 Haldia is likely to be declared a special investment region for petrochemicals and polymers. Andhra and Gujarat have also been chosen for setting up such regions.

 Planning to Sen

 The chief minister today handed over the planning and development portfolio to industries minister Nirupam Sen and food processing to environment minister Mohanta Chatterjee. 

 After being sworn in with additional charge of several departments on May 18, Bhattacharjee had said he would distribute some of them. 

 He is now left with home, information and culture, hill affairs and science and technology.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Infy awaits govt offer

 CHANDREYEE CHATTERJEE 

 Calcutta, Dec. 16: The Bengal government is confident of sealing a land deal with Infosys, but the IT giant is still not aware of what it is being offered.

 We need to expand in the east beyond Bhubaneswar. So, we are looking for a good place at a good price, said S. Gopalakrishnan, president and COO, Infosys. 

 He was in the city today for the golden jubilee celebrations of the Indo-German Chamber of Commerce. 

 Infosys has been in talks with the government for around one-and-a-half years for a plot to set up a development centre here. The company was keen on Rajarhat, but it developed cold feet because of the high price Rs 2.16 crore per acre quoted by Hidco. 

 When the matter reached the chief ministers office, the IT department began hunting for another plot. We showed them the land opposite Vedic Village. Their representatives told us they liked the plot, said IT minister Debesh Das. 

 But the Infosys president said today: We are still waiting for the government to come up with a proposal.

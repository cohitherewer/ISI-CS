The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Ceramic hip in place, woman on feet again

 RANJAN LAHIRY

 Burdwan, Jan. 29: Doctors in a state-run hospital have broken convention by reconstructing a 40-year-old womans hip with a ceramic replacement, which scales down the cost of surgery by a whopping 80 per cent.

 The surgery, beamed live to audiences in a packed hall, mostly doctors, was conducted at Burdwan Medical College and Hospital about a fortnight ago.

 We have done metal replacements in the recent past, but this was the first time that ceramic has been tried out for a replacement surgery in a government hospital, orthopaedic surgeon Debabrata Banerjee said. 

 Banerjee and T.K. Bhatt- acharya conducted the operation on Arati Dutta.

 The resident of Durgapur, about 170 km from Calcutta, could not move her feet for the past six months because, doctors in her hometown said, she had a degenerating hip.

 When Arati met Dr Banerjee first, she had said: I want a better life. Please help me walk again.

 The All India Institute of Medical Sciences and the Central Glass and Ceramic Research Institute designed the special ceramic material used to replace the hip joint, made up of the head of the thigh bone (femur) and the acetabulum ? the cavity on the hip bone that cups the head of the femur.

 Debabrata Bose, the deputy director of the ceramic and glass institute, said: Experts from AIIMS helped us a lot and we are pleased that the operation was successful.

 A metal hip replacement surgery costs between Rs 1.2 and 1.5 lakh while its ceramic alternative can come for as little as Rs 10,000. The cost of surgery might, however, go up to Rs 30,000, depending on the design and material. 

 However, some doctors in Calcutta expressed reser- vations about the ceramic alternative to metal hips. 

 The material is extremely fragile compared with plastic or metal. We normally use metal ones to minimise the chance of fractures at later stages, said Buddha- deb Chatterjee, an expert in hip and knee replacement operations. 

 Many other orthopaedic specialists, however, felt that the price could be the main factor in deciding which method would be more popular.

 Land assent score: 20 out of 4000 farmers

 Singur, Aug. 12: Only 20 of the 4,000 farmers whose plots have been notified for acquisition by Tata Motors have consented to part with their land in Singur. 

 Hooghly district magistrate Binod Kumar revealed this at a news conference today. 

 The poor response from the farmers on giving up their land for the Tata project is due to the administrations inability to motivate them, Kumar said.

 Most of the farmers have not been properly briefed about the hefty compensation package that the government is offering. 

 Kumar said, in all, 1,010 farmers submitted objections on the acquisition last month. 

 Tata Motors requires 1,013 acres spread over five mouzas in Singur, about 45 km from Calcutta. 

 The mouzas are Khaserbheri, Singherbheri, Bajemelia, Gopalnagar and Beraberi.

 Farmers in Bajemelia village had demonstrated against Tata Motors officials in May when they visited the area with some officials of the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation.

 Kumar said a notice will be issued on Monday saying the objections by the 1,010 farmers would be heard between August 22 and 25. The notice will be pasted on the office of Singur block development officer Abhijit Mukherjee. 

 According to Kumar, two camps will be set up in Singur to expedite the mutation of land. 

 Those farmers who have not yet got their land mutated in their names may make an appeal for mutation at the camps, which will start functioning from Monday, he said.

 The Hooghly district magistrate also announced that farmers would get Rs 6 lakh against an acre of one-crop land. For two-crop or multi-crop plots, they would receive Rs 8.9 lakh against an acre. The farmers will get the price against their land much in advance, he added. 

 Besides, bargadars (share-croppers) will get 25 per cent of the total valuation of the land as compensation. 

 Kumar said a special compensation package is being worked out for marginal farmers who mainly depend on land for a livelihood. The children of such farmers would be trained so that they could be absorbed in the Tata project later.

 Even those farmers who have planted saplings of the aman paddy would be heavily compensated if their land is acquired for the Tata project.

 However, the convener of the Krishi Jomi Bachao Committee, Becharam Manna, was not mollfied by the figures announced. He warned that the farmers would not part with their land despite the administrations move to offer a hefty price. 

 Going by the trend, you can easily understand that only a small section has given consent to the sale of their land. The majority of farmers will not give their land. 

 He said farmers would demonstrate at the BDOs office on August 18. We will go for a bigger movement if attempts are made to take away our land by applying force, he said.

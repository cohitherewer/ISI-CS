The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Back after a nightmare of a World Cup 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 1: Rana Safui is not sure if he will again dream of being present at a stadium to watch a World Cup soccer match.

 An avid football lover, Safui had saved up Rs 1.5 lakh to catch the action in Germany from the quarter-finals. But thanks to tour operator Indranil Mitra of Endeavour ? who has left at least 30 soccer lovers like him from the city in a soup ? Safui was forced to scramble back to Calcutta 48 hours after he had landed at Frankfurt.

 Denied tickets for the quarter-finals and left without enough money to meet hotel expenses, Safui, along with three others, returned home on Saturday.

 A well-organised racket seems to be at work and this tour operator is a part of it. We had paid the money in full and were supposed to get the tickets for all the matches ? beginning with the quarter-finals ? before we left for Frankfurt on June 28. 

 Mitra, however, assured us that the tickets would be delivered once we reached Germany. But within hours of our arrival, we realised that he had taken us for a ride. He knew he would not be able to live up to the promise and didnt turn up at Frankfurt to receive us, Safui said.

 Safui is not alone. Dhiraj Bhattacharya of Krishnagar suffered a similar fate.

 At Frankfurt, we learnt that Mitra had paid only 400 out of 1,200 euros to the hotel where we were put up. Things came to such a pass that we were forced to pay money to ensure that the hotel authorities allowed us to take our baggage from the rooms.

 Since food ? even a bottle of water ? was costly, we had to share our meals. Finally, a family from Berlin offered to be our host but we didnt have the money to move to Berlin by train. A ticket for the quarter-finals would have cost around Rs 30,000. Some of the members decided to stay back, relying on their German contacts. But most of us had to return, leaving behind our dreams, Bhattacharya said. 

 When some people offered to bail us out by providing us money, I thought of staying back. But that would have meant more loans. I had already taken a bank loan of Rs 1.53 lakh and didnt want to get trapped further, he added.

 Those who came back on Saturday decided to return after it dawned on them that Mitra had not paid anything to the hotels across Germany where they were scheduled to put up later.

 Hours after we landed at the Frankfurt hotel, we were given a modified tour schedule. There was no mention of the matches that we had gone to see. We immediately called up other hotels where our team was supposed to put up and they said there was no formal booking, Safui said.

 The visitors from Calcutta started making calls back home and word reached the Indian consulate office in Frankfurt. Late at night on June 29, the consulate officials turned up at the hotel and offered to make travel arrangements for those willing to return.

 We felt it was the best option. Rather than sit outside the hotel room and spend a fortune to catch the soccer matches on giant screens outside the stadium, it made more sense to head home, Bhattacharya said.

 Police have learnt about another group that is now stranded in Florence in Italy as Mitra failed to make necessary payments. The team, which includes several senior citizens, had left the city on June 26.

 Safui and Bhattacharya today met deputy commissioner of police (detective department) Gyanwant Singh and handed over documents to facilitate the search for Mitra, who is apparently in London.

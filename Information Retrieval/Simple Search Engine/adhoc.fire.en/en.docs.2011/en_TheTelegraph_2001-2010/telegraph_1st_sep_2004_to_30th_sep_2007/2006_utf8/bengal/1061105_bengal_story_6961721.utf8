Calcutta, Nov. 4: Mallika Mondal could not sleep for two nights. Lying beside her baby at the B.C. Roy Memorial Hospital for Children, she was haunted by cries of mothers whose new-borns have died.

 Mallikas three-month-old son, suffering from jaundice, is admitted in the hospital where 22 babies have died in the past 72 hours. And most of them died at ward 13, where Mallikas son is being treated.

 Their cries sent shivers down my spine. The last two nights have been the most horrifying in my life. Whenever I tried to sleep, I heard the wails of mothers, the resident of Hasnabad in North 24-Parganas said today.

 Her family members have now decided to shift the mother and baby to a paying ward.

 Ward 13 is a general ward, where three babies are crammed in a cot and two patients are sometimes forced to share an oxygen tube. The hospital has 250 beds, but the number of patients often crosses the 400 mark. Of the 250 beds, 40 are paying and 50 are surgical. 

 Had it not been such an inhuman condition, these babies could have been saved, said Itu Ram, whose 10-year-old son Govind is lying in ward 13 with dengue. Last night, he (Govind) was running high fever but none of the doctors or nurses in the ward attended to him, Ram said. 

 But the hospitals medical superintendent, Mrinal Kanti Chatterjee, denied the charges. There is no negligence. It is true that three babies have to share one bed in some of the free-bed wards, but doctors and nurses attend to them, he said.

 Health department officials said it would have not been possible to save the babies even with proper infrastructure. Twelve of the 22 who died were premature and grossly underweight, while the others had advanced meningitis and encephalitis, hospital authorities claimed.

 Apurba Ghosh, director, Institute of Child Health, Calcutta, agreed with the officials. I will not say that it was impossible to save these babies, but in our country it is extremely difficult to retrieve the situation in such cases, he said.

 One needs highly sophisticated and expensive equipment to save newborn babies with such complications. In Calcutta, there are only one or two centres where such facilities exist.

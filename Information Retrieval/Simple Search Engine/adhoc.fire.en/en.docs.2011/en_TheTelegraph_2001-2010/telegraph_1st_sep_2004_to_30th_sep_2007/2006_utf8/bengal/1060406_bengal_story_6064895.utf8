The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Stay off cops, Maoist boss tells poll staff

 PRONAB MONDAL

 Asansol, April 5: The top CPI (Maoist) leader in the state today said the rebels would not harm election workers but warned them against taking the help of police.

 Amra vote kormider boothe jete kono badha debo na. Kintu jodi ora pulisher garite travel kore, tahole ki hobe sheta bolte parchhi na (We will not harm polling perso-nnel on their way to booths. But if they travel in police vehicles, we cannot say what will happen), said Somen, the chief of the organisations state unit, a most-wanted man in police records.

 Talking to The Telegraph in a dingy room of a single-storey house in Asansol for two hours, Somen had a word of caution for the administration as well. 

 We have called for a poll boycott and asked the common people to respond. If the government tries to force people to cast their votes using force, we will resist it. In do- ing so, we might go for a guerrilla attack, he said.

 He also warned against more strikes ? either before or after the elections.

 The threatening tone then gave way to one of regret. 

 Referring to the killings of two CPM activists in front of their families at Lalgarh and Dangardiha in West Midnapore, Somen said: We are planning to change the method of execution. We did not want to kill them in front of their wives and children... but sometimes circumstances create such situations.

 The rebel leader denied that the two were made to pay for their political leanings. We have no objection if anyone supports the CPM or any other party. But we will not tolerate if he or she passes on information about our movements to the police, he said. 

 Before deciding to elimi-nate someone, Somen said: We always send warnings. Those like Rabi Kar, Gumai Tudu and Kartik Singha had not paid heed to our messages and we had no option but to kill them. Gumais information had helped the police arrest Bimala and Sulekha.

 Sulekha Mahato and Bimala Sardar were caught in a Belpahari village in February after a police encounter with the rebels.

 Somen said the Maoists were spreading wings beyond their known strongholds. 

 If the government thinks we are active only in West Midnapore, Bankura and Purulia, it is mistaken. We are preparing mass bases in parts of Birbhum bordering Jharkhand, Chapra, Nakashipara, Tehatta, Karimpur and Kaligunj in Nadia, and Naoda, Hariharpara and Gangapur in Murshidabad. Our armed squads are also active in these areas.

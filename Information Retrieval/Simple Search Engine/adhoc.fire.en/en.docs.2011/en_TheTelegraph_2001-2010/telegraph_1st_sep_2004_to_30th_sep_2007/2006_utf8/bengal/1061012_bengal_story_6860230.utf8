 Citu duo gets bail in assault case

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Durgapur Oct. 11: Kalidas Chakraborty and Partha Basu, the Citu workers who allegedly led Monday nights attack on two Graphite India Ltd executives, surrendered before police today and were granted bail. 

 The duos release sparked fear among company officials of another strike. Security manager Sanjay Ghosh and personnel officer S.K. Sharma, who were dragged out of a car and beaten up on Monday, did not come to work today. 

 We are trying to contact the police bosses through our superiors in Calcutta. The accused workers have been granted bail and were seen roaming in front of the factory gate this afternoon. Our officers are scared. We have already sent our complaints to the chief minister and the labour minister, said personnel manager Sohel Khan.

 Citu leaders in Durgapur denied the two had a hand in the assault and said they had gone to rescue the executives.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Dead 13 appear in daylight

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Durgapur, March 20: A group of 13, all residents of Benachity in the heart of the steel town and supposed to be dead, today showed up at the subdivisional office here.

 They told subdivisional officer Balaram Dey that their names had been deleted from the final electoral rolls that also show them as dead.

 The 13, who possess voter identity cards, came to the office armed with all relevant documents to prove that they were genuine voters. 

 Mohammad Tajuddin, who was one of the complainants, alleged that election officials who came to his house for the door-to-door inquiry, which the poll panel had ordered to weed out bogus voters, asked absurd questions. 

 The officials demanded documents to prove that we are alive. Their questions were ridiculous.

 Burdwan Citu secretary Debabrata Banerjee, who accompanied the 13 this morning, alleged that the officials deployed for the rolls revision were negligent. We were forced to approach the subdivisional officer.

 Dey said he scrutinised the voter identity cards of all the 13 people and assured them that the mistake would be rectified. I have also ordered a probe into the matter, he added.

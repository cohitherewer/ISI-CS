The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Police force to help Tata erect fence

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 15: Fearing 

 physical resistance by some farmers, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees 

 government will send police to take possession of land in 

 Singur after September 21.

 Land minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah today said the police action was necessary as the issue had snowballed into a political problem.

 If not the police, should the government send sanyasis there? Its not about land acquisition anymore. Why is Mamata Banerjee going there? Why am I going there to address public meetings? Its not our land, Mollah said.

 The land and land reforms department is slated to wrap up the acquisition process and declare the farmers compensation by September 21. That day, the land would be transferred to the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation. The gov- ernment is expected to pass on the ownership of the land to Tata Motors immediately.

 Officials fear violent protests once the company officials reach there to take possession and fence off the plot. 

 On their first trip to Singur in May after the site for the small-car plant had been chosen, a Tata team was gheraoed by villagers.

 Even if farmers dont oppose the process, political interests would ensure that outsiders disturb proceedings, Mollah said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Killer wheels spill blood

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Feb. 18: Buses competing with each other on the streets continued to take toll of pedestrians in the city. 

 Gopal Koley, 68, was crushed to death on Raja SC Mullick Road in Jadavpur this afternoon.

 He had just stepped onto the road around 2.45 when a bus on route 45 came rushing at a break-neck speed. Koley had almost managed to avoid it when he got hit and, as he stumbled, another bus on the same route smashed him.

 Police said he must have been returning from Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital. We are yet to find out his residence, but from the documents we found in a plastic packet that Koley was carrying, it seems he was a neurological patient, a senior Jadavpur police station officer said. 

 The police have seized the vehicles but the drivers gave the slip.

 Residents, who said buses habitually drove recklessly through the area, blocked the road. Senior police officers persuaded them to lift the blockade after over an hour.

 Koley, a witness said, was knocked down by the first bus and crushed by the second, which was trying to speed past it. During death, the elderly man was holding on to the packet which had his doctors prescription. 

 His head was smashed and the insides were all over the road. It was a terrible sight and before we could react, the vehicles moved ahead, said Shyamal Baran Mitra, who was passing by. 

 Local people forced the buses to halt. But by the time they made it to them, the drivers and conductors had fled.

 The citys traffic police have struggled to put in place a system that would bring down the number of deaths on the road or to rein in buses that flout rules at will. The week before last, Shibu Rani Sarkar, 60, was run over in the heart of the central business district.

 The residents of Jadavpur today demanded speed limits.

 Metro OK, but on fat tracks

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 12: Metro Railway in Calcutta might implement the East-West Metro project if broad gauge tracks are laid instead of a standard gauge line, which experts have recommended.

 Delhi Metro Railway Corporation, which has prepared a detailed project report for the Rs 4,000-crore project, sent its environment assessment report to the transport department today. 

 It has also suggested laying of standard gauge tracks, which are 1,435 mm in width, about 150 mm less than broad gauge ones now used in the city. Standard gauge tracks, though convenient to lay, are an expensive alternative.

 The proposed rail route connecting the citys flanks has already been curtailed from 23 km to 16 km to bring down the project cost from Rs 5,400 crore to Rs 4,000 crore. Instead of extending from Dasnagar (Howrah) to New Town, Rajarhat, as planned originally, it will now run from Howrah Maidan to Salt Lake.

 The project cost will come down further if broad gauge tracks are laid. While Delhi Metro has spent Rs 126 crore for every km of track, we are spending only Rs 113 crore for the Metro extension up to New Garia, Metro general manager Sudha Chobe said during an interactive session organised by the Merchants Chamber of Commerce.

 Metro might execute and operate the project. Details are being worked out between the state government and the Railway Board, which will have to give the final go-ahead, Chobey added.

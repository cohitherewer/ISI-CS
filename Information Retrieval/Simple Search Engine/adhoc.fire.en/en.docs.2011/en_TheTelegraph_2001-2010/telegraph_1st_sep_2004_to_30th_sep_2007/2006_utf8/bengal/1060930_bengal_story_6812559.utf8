 Taunted, teen in old dress kills herself

 Krishnagar, Sept. 29: Fif- teen-year-old Santana Haldar did not have any new clothes to wear when her friends called her to go pandal-hopping on sashthi evening.

 But she mustered enough enthusiasm to put on a clean salwar-kameez and join them. 

 Hours later, Santana returned home at Nadias Krishnagunj in tears and hanged herself with her dupatta. Her parents saw the body hanging as they called her for dinner. 

 District police chief Ajay Nand said the Class IX student was teased by some of her friends about the dress.

 Her mother Sarama, a domestic help, earns Rs 500 a month. She didnt get her bonus this year because of the floods. Her husband Rabin, 40, a rickshawpuller, has not been able to work for a year because of heart problems.

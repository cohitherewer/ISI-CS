 Laggard colleges face funds drought

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Kalyani, Aug. 25: All colleges in the state, from the top of the heap to the bottom, will have to perform or perish.

 The government is set to introduce a performance-based system for allocating funds to all higher educational institutions. 

 It has already earmarked Rs 15 crore for setting up a state-level accreditation body along the lines of the National Assessment and Accreditation Council, higher education minister Sudarshan Roychowdhury said here today.

 The initial formalities are over. We expect to start the council in a few months, he said while addressing a convention of non-teaching employees.

 A meeting on September 15 will chalk out the structure of the council. The vice-chancellors of all seven state universities and academics associated with higher education will attend it. 

 Once it is in place, each of the 340-odd undergraduate colleges and seven universities seeking the states assistance will have to get themselves accredited with the new council in the same way as they do it now with the NAAC for central funds.

 Roychowdhury had earlier announced the setting up of the council in the Assembly.

 Now, with both Delhi and Calcutta insisting that the colleges perform and draw up future plans in advance to claim financial help, there is no way for them to survive but to do so.

 Explaining the reasons for setting up the new council, the minister said the government had taken note of the fact that the national council was awarding low grades to many of colleges. We were not satisfied with the system of assessment followed by the NAAC. 

 Every institution registered with the UGC is now provided financial assistance on the basis of grades awarded by the national council, which also takes into account facilities and infrastructure available. 

 A large number of lesser-known, small colleges across the state are now suffering because they are not being assessed properly by the NAAC, the higher education minister said. 

 But sources said more than acting as a counterweight to the national council, the states move is aimed at creating a watchdog for colleges that had been accused of frittering away funds and doing little to improve academic standards.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Cong leader 

in Trinamul Singur show

 SAMARPAN DUTTA

 Singur, Oct. 15: Claiming he was there with the permission of the party high command, state Congress leader Abdul Mannan today shared a platform with Trinamul Congress leaders at a Singur meeting which, he said, was the first step towards a united front. 

 The event came on a day when the state Congress decided not to compromise the partys ideological commitment to secularism by agreeing to join Trinamuls movements.

 Ten thousand farmers flocked to the meeting, organised under the banner of Krishijomi Raksha (save farmland) Committee, and observed Lajja Divas (day of shame) to protest the September 25 police action on farmers opposing acquisition of farmland for Tata Motors small-car plant.

 The united front would oust the Left Front government from Bengal, Mannan said from the dais, alongside leaders of the SUCI, Janata Dal and a CPI-ML faction led by Asim Chatterjee.

 I have not come of my own accord, I have the permission and the support of the Congress high command. If it were not so, I would not have dared come here, Mannan said.

 A section of people motivated by the ruling CPM is out there to oppose the coming together of the two parties. They (the CPM) are scared of being dethroned.

 Whatever happens, we will not allow the forced land acquisition for Tata Motors small-car project here. We shall bring a bill in Parliament to prevent multi-crop land acquisition for industrialisation, the one-time Congress MLA from Hooghly said.

 Former Trinamul MP Ajit Panja warned Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees police of legal action if they used force during land acquisition.

 Buddhababus men insulted over 100 women. They had charged the farmers with attempt to murder and rioting to keep the protesters in jail, but what they found at the site of protest in the block development office were a dozen-odd brooms, Panja said.

 Next time when the men in uniform visit you, come out of your homes with their (Marxists) own party symbol (the sickle). They should not have an objection, he added.

 The noted lawyer was prepared to offer his professional services to the women if they went ahead and attacked the police.

 As a legal practitioner, I assure you I will fight your case. You will not be charged with murder because the law says all citizens have the right to defend themselves. If someone is killed in the process, you cannot hold the person responsible, Panja said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Army probing airport fracas

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 12: The army has begun a probe into allegations that a jawan and an officer assaulted Calcutta airport employees after a row over parking yesterday.

 We have started an inquiry?. All facts will be taken into consideration in the course of investigation, an army spokesperson said today. Our officers will also speak to (the) airport authorities, he added.

 The duo from the Barrackpore cantonment allegedly barged into the office of the domestic airport manager and beat up two employees because a car was ordered out of a no-parking zone. 

 A complaint against the personnel was filed at Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport police station.

 Trouble erupted after the duo parked a private hired car in front of the domestic terminal. According to the police complaint, an airport security employee asked the driver to move the car around 8.30 am but the jawan, Ram Vir, refused. 

 Mihir Sarkar, the domestic airport manager on duty, was informed and he came out and ordered the vehicle out. An argument and a scuffle followed, after which Sarkar returned to his office.

 Witnesses said a few minutes later two army personnel went into the managers office and tried to attack Sarkar. Arun Dey, an office assistant, and Rezzak Ali, a security staff, tried to stop them but the armymen allegedly beat them up. 

 However, the army today reiterated that the officer was inside the airport terminal and was not involved in the scuffle. Only Ram Virs conduct is under probe. He was with the car during the fracas. We have found out that the officer was inside the terminal. Had he been there (at the scene of trouble), we think there would not have been any trouble, an army official said. 

 Airport sources said army representatives would meet Airports Authority of India officials over the issue. They have assured strong action against the errant personnel and said such an unfortunate incident would not occur again, a senior airport official said. 

 The police said the case would be brought up before the Barrackpore court magistrate soon.

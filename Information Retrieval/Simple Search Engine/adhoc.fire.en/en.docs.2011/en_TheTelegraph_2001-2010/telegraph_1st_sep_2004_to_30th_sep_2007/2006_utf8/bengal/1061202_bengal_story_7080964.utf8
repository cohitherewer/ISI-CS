The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Biman gloats in twin wins

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Dec. 1: Biman Bose was visibly happy today as Mamata Banerjee and her rampaging legislators had virtually offered political victory to the ruling party on a platter and made the fencing of the farmland acquired for Tata Motors relatively hassle-free. 

 A respite from the barbs of Left Front allies, who were forced to close ranks with the CPM, was another boon.

 You can interpret it that way if you like, the CPM state secretary said after a front meeting to chalk out a strategy to extract further political mileage from the principal Opposition partys behaviour. 

 The CPI, RSP and Forward Bloc leaders were angry with Mamata for a different reason. 

 We were supposed to raise the land issues at todays meeting after we succeeded in sending the land reforms bill to the Assemblys select committee at the last one. Mamata messed up everything. Only she and her MLAs antics were discussed today, a CPI leader said. 

 The snaking queue at the Assembly gates to see the destruction wrought inside underlined a part of the CPMs plan. 

 Bose, mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya and other leaders trooped into the Assembly ensuring that the spotlight remained trained on the exhibits of the mayhem. 

 Speaker Hashim Abdul Halim ordered an extension of the viewing time till 5 pm from 4 as many people were still waiting outside. 

 It will continue for another two days, Bose said. Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee and many other leaders would be there tomorrow.

 Ive been in the Assembly since 1946. Ive never witnessed such barbaric and criminal activities. The culprits should be arrested and given exemp- lary punishment, said Jyoti Basu. 

 The former chief minister, who attended todays meeting despite his poor health and the bandh, added that he had telephoned Halim to tell him to call police when he heard about the incident yesterday.

 The front, too, demanded punishment but no FIR has been lodged against the Trinamul MLAs and nor is it likely, a leader said.

 Buddha in farm-tech balance act

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 6: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee told a gathering in South 24-Parganas today that the district held tremendous potential for development of agro-based industry but it was essential to look beyond ? at IT, electronics and engineering.

 Inaugurating an industrial trade fair at Baruipur, about 30 km from Calcutta, he said: Setting up only agro-based industry will not help in improving Bengals industrial scenario. We should also focus on IT, electronics and machine tools.

 There was tension in South 24-Parganas last year when the government announced its intention to acquire farmland for industry. The government had to assuage hurt feelings ? even among a section of the CPM ? by saying that fertile tracts would not be touched and farmers would be adequately compensated. 

 The chief minister made the same promise today, months before the Assembly polls, but also emphasised that South 24-Parganas is among Bengals backward districts and it had to be developed by setting up industries. 

 But, nothing will be done that goes against the interest of farmers.

 Land reforms minister Abdur Rezzak Molla, who was once at the forefront of leaders unhappy with the land acquisition plans, said: Dont worry, the government does not allow industrialists to buy land from farmers. It acquires the land, pays proper compensation and then hands it over.

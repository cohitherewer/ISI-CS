 SC bar on liquor shop permits

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi/Calcutta, Sept. 18: The Supreme Court today passed an interim order restraining the Bengal government from issuing fresh trade licences for liquor shops.

 A division bench presided over by Chief Justice Y.K. Sabharwal also issued a notice asking the government to take part in the case filed against it by the All Bengal Excise Licencees Association, a body of liquor shop owners.

 In its petition before the Supreme Court, the association had challenged Calcutta High Courts dismissal of a contempt petition alleging that even after an injunction order, the state was issuing licences for liquor shops.

 The association initiated the high court case in 2002 af- ter the government decided to issue one liquor shop licence for every 18,000 people. The association claimed that existing off shops would suffer as a result. 

 After hearing the petitioner and the excise department, the high court had issued an interim order directing the state not to issue fresh licences till further orders. 

 Days later, the association moved the contempt case alleging even after the interim order, the state had issued a notification inviting applications for fresh licences. 

 But the petition was dismissed after the excise department convinced the court that it had not issued any such notification.

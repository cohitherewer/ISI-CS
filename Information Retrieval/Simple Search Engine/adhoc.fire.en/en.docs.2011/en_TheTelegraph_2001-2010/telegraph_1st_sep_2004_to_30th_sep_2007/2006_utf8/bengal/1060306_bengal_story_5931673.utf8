The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Top cop raps OC amp; officer for graffiti

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, March 5: The offi- cer-in-charge of a city police station and one of his colleagues, captured on camera last night standing next to graffiti writers doing a late-night job, were censured by the police commissioner today. 

 The censure, which a senior officer described as punishment that can be handed out without official proceedings, would feature in OC Bikash Roy and sub-inspector S.B. Kuors service records.

 Star Ananda had caught the officers on night duty encountering the youths painting the name of Biplab Chatterjee ? the CPMs Alipore candidate ? on a wall off Harish Mukherjee Road and letting them walk away after committing the offence. 

 The day before, commissioner Prasun Mukherjee had asked the officers-in-charge of all 48 police stations in the city to ensure there is no fresh writing on walls. 

 The punishment is meant to ensure that the message gets across to all other offi- cers-in-charge, who should ensure there is no fresh wall writing in the city. I have categorically asked all of them to ensure this and there can be no slackness on this issue, he said today.

 Chief electoral officer Debasish Sen, who convened a meeting in the wake of last nights incident, said: The police commissioner has been asked to provide a detailed report on the incident. Let it be made very clear that there can be no fresh writing on walls. 

 Mukherjee said Sen is being kept posted about the developments.

 Rattled, the officers-in-charge of police stations have decided to hit their respective areas with digital cameras to capture any attempt to deface walls.

 District superintendents of police, too, are mounting vigil with the digital equipment. The evidence is essential to prove the charge in court, East Midnapore police chief Ashoke Dutta said.

 Late this evening, the police caught a youth writing graffiti near Bagmari market in north Calcutta. Deputy commissioner Vineet Goyel said he had managed to paint the first name of Trinamul Congress leader Paresh Pal when he was arrested. 

 Cases have also been registered at Ultadanga and Phoolbagan police stations, though no one has been arrested.

 Six people were held in Nadia and North 24-Parganas while allegedly trying to write on walls. 

 Bipul Modak and Sujit Majumder were arrested from Srinagar More in Nadias Chapra, some 120 km from Calcutta, early this morning. They were writing in favour of Samsur Molla, the local CPM candidate. Four have been held in North 24-Parganas Barasat and Rajarhat.

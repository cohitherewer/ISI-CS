 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, Feb. 21: The high court has asked the government to recruit two North 24-Par- ganas residents to the post of panchayat secretaries 20 years after they were selected for the job.

 Ashok Ghosh, 49, and Sajal Dey, 50, of Ashoknagar have to be appoin-ted by June. In 1986, the government had decided to appoint 1,500 village panchayat secretaries. The duo made it to the final panel but did not get the jobs. When they moved court in 2003, the government lawyer said 600 candidates who were below 50 on January 1 that year would get the jobs. Despite making the cut, Ashok and Sajal did not get the jobs. They moved court again.

 Howrah: A mob ransacked a nursing home on GT Road in Bally on Tuesday after a newborn died. Police said Barnali De gave birth to a boy on Friday. As the baby dev-eloped respiratory problems, the nursing home requested the father, Mangal De, to shift him to a better hospital. The baby died while being shifted but the nursing home was attacked.

 Chinsurah: Industries minister Nirupam Sen said at a programme at Sahagunj in Hooghly that the government would hold a meeting on Thursday to discuss concessions it could give to the Dunlop management to help reopen its plant, 60 km from Calcutta.

 Calcutta: The government order that allowed Murshidabad development planning committee members to continue if they were re-elected in the zilla parishad polls was quashed in the high court on Tuesday. The parishad will have to hold fresh elections for the committee.

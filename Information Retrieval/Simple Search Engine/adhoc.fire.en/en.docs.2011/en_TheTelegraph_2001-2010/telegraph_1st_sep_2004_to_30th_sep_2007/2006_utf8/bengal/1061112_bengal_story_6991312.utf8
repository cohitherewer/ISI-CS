 Speaking on the occasion, also the 118th birth anniversary of Azad, Akbar, the editor-in-chief of the Asian Age and former editor of The Telegraph, highlighted the plight of minorities. Only education can bring about a change.... So many commissions have been set up over the past 50 years but to no avail, he said.

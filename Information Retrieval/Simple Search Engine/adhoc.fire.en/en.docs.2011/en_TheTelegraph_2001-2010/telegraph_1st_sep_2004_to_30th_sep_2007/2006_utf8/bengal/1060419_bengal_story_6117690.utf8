The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 What poll? Widow fights for clinic 

 RABI BANERJEE

 Gangnapur, April 18: For Rekha Ghosal, a widow, the elections are a farce.

 Her husband, Sachindranath Ghosal, a lawyer, had donated a six-bigha plot to the government to build a health centre 45 years ago. 

 The 20-bed health centre in the village 70 km from Calcutta started off well, but has deteriorated over two decades.

 Now, it has only one bed. There is no supply of oxygen and the surgical instruments have been stolen. No doctor or nurses are available after 2 pm. This is not what my husband hoped for, said Rekha, 66.

 Last Saturday, Sunita Das, a Gangnapur housewife suffering from gastro-enteritis, was doubled up in pain as she sat on the stairs around 10 am waiting for the clinic to open. 

 I dont know when the doctor will come and open it. I may have to go to a quack, she said. The nearest hospital is in Ranaghat, 20 km away.

 The village falls under Ranaghat (East) constituency, a CPM stronghold. The party nominee, former IPS officer Deben Biswas, insists there is no problem. 

 Deputy chief medical officer of health of Nadia, Mohan Basu, admits doctors are unwilling to work here but blames it on extortion threats by local thugs.

 In every election since the clinic opened, candidates have promised it would be upgraded into a hospital. I know nothing will change. I dont have the energy and patience to cast my vote. My only objective in life is to see that the health centre is not reduced to rubble, said the mashima who often pays for villagers treatment by Krishnagar doctors. 

 So, she has now demanded her husbands plot back.

 Last month, Rekha wrote to the district authorities and health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra. My husbands soul will not rest in peace unless something is done about it. I want the land returned, she said.

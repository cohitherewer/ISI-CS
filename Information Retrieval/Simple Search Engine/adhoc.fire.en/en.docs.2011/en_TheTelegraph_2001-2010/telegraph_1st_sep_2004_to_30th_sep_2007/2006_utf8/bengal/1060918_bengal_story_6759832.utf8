The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Pep pill for rural health centres

 A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta, Sept. 17: The government has drawn up a plan to modernise rural and subdivisional health centres to ease the pressure on state-run referral hospitals in Calcutta, Buddhudeb Bhattacharjee said here today. 

 After opening a 30-bed in- tensive cardiac care unit (ICCU) and a Brachytherapy machine at SSKM Hospital, the chief minister said public-private partnerships would be a key element of the initiative to tone up health centres. 

 Negotiations are on with the World Bank for funds, expected to be received by the middle of next year, he said. 

 UKs department for international development (DFID) has already disbursed loan meant for the purpose.

 The decision to upgrade primary health centres and subdivisional hospitals was taken at a recent meeting at Swastha Bhavan where Bhattacharjee was present.

 Health department sour- ces said a larger number of doctors and more paramedical staff are part of the plan, as are sophisticated X-ray machines, improved equipment for diagnosis and upgraded operation theatres.

 The public-private partnership model, the chief minis- ter said, would put the centres in a position where they can provide more facilities. There are NGOs who run ambul- ances. Well ask them to provide the service to health centres. Private diagnostic centres will also be invited, he added. 

 Partnerships did not make any progress at Mayo Hospital and KS Roy TB Hospital in Jadavpur, but Bhattacharjee was confident the strategy would pay off in the long run. There are problems initially, but things will move ahead , he said.

 Bhattacharjee described as unfortunate the incident last year in which a woman admitted to Sambhunath Pandit Hospital died after being bitten by ants all night. 

 Claiming that Bengal still provides the best state-aided medical facilities in the country the chief minister said: If one compares how many patients come everyday to state-run hospitals, get treated and how many die, our state has no competition.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Foulplay slur on judge house sale

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Feb. 4: Bhagabati Prosad Banerjees Salt Lake house was auctioned at Rs 51 lakh today amid protests from the bidders and representatives of the former judge.

 A government valuer had fixed the reserve price for the two-storey house built on four cottahs at Rs 56 lakh, but the auctioneers today said bidding would begin from Rs 50 lakh.

 Businessman Pradip Murarka offered the highest bid ? Rs 20.5 lakh for the land and Rs 30.5 lakh for the building ? defeating S.K. Tulsiyan, who offered Rs 50 lakh.

 According to a Supreme Court order, there had to be separate bidding for the land and the building. 

 The process was manipulated and contradicted the apex courts order. It was an eyewash, alleged Anupurba Banerjee, the former judges daughter-in-law, who was present in the BD auditorium where transport department joint secretary P.K. Bagchi and the estate manager of Salt Lake, D.K. Gupta, conducted the auction.

 Anupurba said the property was undervalued and the government should have consulted the apex court before deciding the reserve price. 

 The urban development department had short-listed eight prospective bidders for the auction but only three of them ? Murarka, Tulsiyan and Rajib Borai ? turned up. Borai withdrew protesting against the process.

 Bagchi started the auction quoting Rs 18.5 lakh for the land and Rs 20 lakh for the building. 

 Having lost the bid, Tulsiyan, too, cried foul. We were not allowed to inspect the house to assess its worth. The reserve price was not quoted in the bid notice. It was announced after the auction started.

 Basudeb Agarwal, whose bid application was rejected, said: Banerjee has filed a petition in the apex court alleg-ing that his property has been undervalued, but the bidders were not informed about it.

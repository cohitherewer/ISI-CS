 Citu bolts Dunlop door

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Hooghly, June 2: Citu members today prevented around 100 workers from entering Dunlops Sahagunge factory this morning. 

 The new Pawan Ruia management had asked 100 employees of the maintenance department to join duty today. 

 But when they went to the factory in Hooghly, 60 km from Calcutta, union leaders stopped them at the main gate. 

 Dipankar Roy, the general secretary of the CPMs labour arm at the plant, said: The management prepared the workers list without consulting us, which is a violation of our pact with the management.

 According to the April 9 pact, Roy added, the management had to discuss with the unions the names of the workers to be offered early retirement schemes and those to be allowed to resume work. But the management published a list of employees who had been asked to work on its own.

 After the signing of the agreement Ruia had expressed hope that the plant will open by August-September. 

 Citu had prevented 42 workers of the maintenance department from entering the factory on May 15, citing errors in the way the management was calculating the arrears.

 Today, Roy said: The management is now taking permanent employees as temporary workers. 

 A. Dasgupta, the personnel manager at the plant, refused comment.

 Ruia met labour and power minister Mrinal Banerjee in Calcutta in the evening over the companys electricity dues. He demanded individual meters at the workers quarters.

 Babus told to explain their sloth to people

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Dec. 24: Concerned at a flood of complaints against officials dragging their feet over simple tasks and ignoring peoples grievances, the Nadia magistrate has ordered all officers to respond to each and every letter written by residents. 

 District magistrate .S. Meena has asked four subdivisional and 17 block development officers and the executive officers of panchayats to respond to peoples complaints in writing. 

 Officials said the decision was taken as the DMs complaint box had been spilling over. Every day, nearly 100 people approach the district magistrate or his deputies with complaints of apathy and indifference in the lower rungs of the administration. 

 I receive complaints that need to be answered by a BDO or a panchayat executive officer. They either dont pay heed or the people dont find them in their offices, said Meena. 

 So, I have asked all SDOs, BDOs and executive officers of rural bodies to respond to queries in writing, he added. 

 Responding to complaints would sensitise the officers to the peoples problems, Meena said. 

 People often approach the district magistrate with land and family disputes, domestic violence problems and denial of calamity relief as the officers are often difficult to approach or, as Meena said, too laid-back to do the needful. 

 Nirapad Biswas, 50, came to his office from Tehatta to enquire why he had still not got a tarpaulin sheet due to him since the September floods. 

 He had repeatedly urged the local panchayat and block offices to give him the tarpaulin sheet but in vain, said an official. A teacher who had retired from a school in Krishnagar came to the DM a few months ago as his pension was delayed. The officers he went to earlier had not taken his problem seriously. 

 Now officers will have to give in writing why a certain job was not done or cannot be done. We expect the people who come to my office to carry such letters from the SDOs or BDOs, Meena said.

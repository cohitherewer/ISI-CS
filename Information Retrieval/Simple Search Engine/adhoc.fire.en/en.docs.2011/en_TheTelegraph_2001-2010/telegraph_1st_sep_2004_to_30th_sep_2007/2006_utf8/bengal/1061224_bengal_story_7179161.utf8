 Curb on right to suspend employee

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, Dec. 23: The high court has asked the state government to allow a suspended employee to rejoin office despite being imprisoned for two months on charges of torturing his wife. 

 The governments service rules say that if a government employee spends over 48 hours in jail custody, he or she is placed under suspension. 

 A division bench of Justices B. Bhattacharya and K.K. Prosad held that the government had no authority to restrain Suman Roy Chowdhury from joining duty till his guilt was proved in court.

 According to rules, a government employee gets half his total monthly pay during the period of suspension. 

 But the bench observed that the state had no authority to pay any amount to an employee who is not allowed to perform his duties. The judges said paying salary to someone who is not working amounts to misuse of the exchequer. 

 Legal experts said yesterdays ruling will have far-reaching consequences as it would be cited as a precedent in many other similar cases.

 Roy Chowdhury, a peon-cum-orderly posted in the Purulia office of the director of the consumer affairs department, was arrested from his house in Haltu on the southern fringes of Calcutta after his wife Ruma lodged a criminal complaint against him on July 27 last year.

 Ruma alleged that she was being tortured and harassed by her husband. 

 The Alipore criminal court sent Roy Chowdhury to jail custody for two months. 

 But when he went to join office in Purulia after his release from the jail on bail, the director of consumer affairs showed him the door. 

 He issued him a letter on October 14, 2005, suspending him from the job for staying in jail for more than 48 hours.

 Challenging the legality of the letter, Roy Chowdhury moved the state administrative tribunal. Hearing both sides, the tribunal upheld his bosss decision this September.

 The 26-year-old man then moved the high court, which granted his appeal and set aside the tribunals order.

 Jyoti Prasad Basu, the general secretary of the CPM-led state government employees co-ordination committee, said the order would help many who have been suspended from office even before being convicted by a court.

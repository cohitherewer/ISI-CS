The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Poll switch to Open Office

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Calcutta, Aug. 19: The Open Source software movement is gaining momentum in Marxist Bengal.

 State chief electoral officer Debasish Sen on Thursday sent a directive to all district magistrates to switch from Microsoft Office to Open Office for poll-related applications. 

 The deadline, stipulated in the circular, is September 1. 

 We have acted on the basis of a directive from the Election Commission of India. Bengal is among the first states to introduce Open Office in place of Microsoft Office, Sen said, adding that the EC has plans to completely do away with proprietary software and switch to free software.

 The term free refers to users freedom to run, copy, modify or distribute the software by accessing the source code, which companies like Microsoft guard strictly.

 Left parties support free software, championed across the world by Richard Stallman. He was in town earlier this week and had urged the government to opt for free software. 

 We will use Open Source software in government initiatives wherever we face a funds crunch, said information technology minister Debesh Das. 

 To facilitate the smooth transition to the Open Source software, which for the time being will run on Windows operating systems, the state election commission organised a two-day training session for systems managers in all the districts. Open Office software has been despatched to all district headquarters. 

 There is a standing instruction that pirated software cant be used. So, we are moving towards a freeware system, which can be upgraded without any cost, Sen said.

 Girl child murder

 Barrackpore, Sept. 2: A 24-year-old housewife has been accused of killing her new-born daughter.

 Sonali Dass neighbours at Halisahar in North 24-Parganas said they saw her standing by as her mother buried the infant in their backyard this morning. Police have exhumed the babys body and sent it for post-mortem.

 The police are yet to establish whether the child was murdered. The mother is unwell as she bled a lot during delivery. We will question her as soon as she recovers, an officer said.

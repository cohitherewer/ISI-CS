 Mother suicide

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Jan. 7: A 30-year-old housewife allegedly committed suicide this morning after giving birth to a girl a week ago.

 Rita Das, a resident of Nadias Nakashipara, about 130 km from Calcutta, had reportedly been depressed ever since her daughters birth on the first day of the new year. 

 A patient of the hospital where Rita was admitted found her lying in a toilet around 4.30 this morning, with bandages wound tight round her neck. 

 After interrogating the doctors and nurses, we have found that the woman had strangled herself. A patient called up the nurses after finding her in the hospital toilet early this morning. The hospital authorities told us that she had been crying for the last few days after giving birth to a girl. We have sent the body for post-mortem to find out the exact cause of death, R. Rajsekharan, the district superintendent of police, said.

 However, Dass husband Sudipta refused to admit that his has wife had killed herself because her baby had turned out a daughter.

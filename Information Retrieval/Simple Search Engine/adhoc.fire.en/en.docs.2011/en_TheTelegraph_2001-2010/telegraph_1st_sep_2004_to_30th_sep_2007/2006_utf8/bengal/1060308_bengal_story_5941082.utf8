The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, March 7: A man who got a job in the social education department in 1981 but was not allowed to join should finally be able to do so.

 The high court today ordered that Samar Dutta of Bhattapara in Murshidabad, who is 50 now, would also get his 25 years dues. 

 Some time after employees of Indra Nagar Rural Library refused to let him work as a cycle peon, the government cancelled Duttas appointment. When he moved court, its lawyer claimed Dutta had informed the government that he did not want the job. The judge said: It is unbelievable that a man who is moving court for a job has written to the government saying he is not willing to join work. 

 Calcutta: The government has appealed to the Union human resource development ministry to allow the 116 primary teachers training institutes not affiliated to the National Council of Teachers Education to ad-mit trainees for at least a year. The high court had on Friday asked the institutes to stop admitting trainees for not having the affiliation. The future of over 11,000 youths is now in a balance.

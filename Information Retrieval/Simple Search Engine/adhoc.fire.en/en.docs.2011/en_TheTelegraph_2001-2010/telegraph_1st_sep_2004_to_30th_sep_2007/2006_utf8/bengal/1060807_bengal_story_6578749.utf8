 BRIEFS

 Kanksa, Aug. 6: Industries minister Nirupam Sen today requested farmers to co-operate with the government by selling their plots on their own if they have been identified for acquisition.

 Industry is the need of the hour and farmers must understand that land has to be acquired, Sen said after opening nine medium-scale steel and iron-based factories at a new industrial hub here in Burdwan, 160 km from Calcutta. The complex was built on 400 ac-res of single-crop land.

 Calcutta: CID sleuths asked the two survivors of the Purulia trek tragedy to watch video clippings of the area where a flash flood apparently swept their friends away and give a blow-by-blow account of the incident.

 Behrampore: Two persons were killed on Sunday afternoon when the roof of a temple caved in at Harishchandrapur in Kandi, Murshidabad. They were sleeping inside the temple, about 240 km from Calcutta.

 Calcutta: A godown on the Sealdah station premises was gutted on Sunday evening. Firemen said a short circuit caused the blaze.

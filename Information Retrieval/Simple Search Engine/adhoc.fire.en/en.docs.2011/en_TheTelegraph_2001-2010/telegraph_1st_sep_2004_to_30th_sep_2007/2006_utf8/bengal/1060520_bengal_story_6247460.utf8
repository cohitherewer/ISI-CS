The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 28 yrs for trial

 Durgapur, May 19: A woman held for killing her daughter 28 years ago has been in jail since. 

 Fifty-year-old Sabitri Harijans trial began yesterday and the judge sent her back to the jail for treatment of her mental instability. 

 In 1978, Sabitri battered her four-year-old daughter to death in Andal, 220 km from Calcutta. The then Durgapur subdivisional judicial magistrate sent her to Asansol sub-jail for treatment for mental depression and instability. In 1981, she was shifted to Presidency Jail, also for treatment. 

 Her miner husband, Meluram, disappeared a year after the murder. No one looked Sabitri up after that.

 Last month, the additional district judges court in Durgapur asked the government to provide her with legal aid and a lawyer. The case will be heard again on July 18.

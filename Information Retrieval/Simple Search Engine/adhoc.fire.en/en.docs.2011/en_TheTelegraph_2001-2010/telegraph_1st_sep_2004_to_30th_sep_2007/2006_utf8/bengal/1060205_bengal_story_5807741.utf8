The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Gunshot fells youth on a stroll

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Feb. 4: Around 9 last night, Vikas Gupta stepped out of his Swinhoe Lane house, apparently for a stroll. 

 Moments later, his relatives heard a grocery shop owner scream Vikas ko goli lag gaya (Vikas has been shot). 

 As his brothers rushed out, they saw the 21-year-old lying in a pool of blood. Vikas could barely groan ma. An hour-and-a-half later, he died in a nursing home. 

 Vikas had been shot below his right earlobe with a country-made pistol, which police found yards away from his house. The body has been sent for post-mortem. We have started a murder case but the motive is not clear to us. He could have also committed suicide, said S.N. Gupta, the South 24-Parganas police chief.

 When the youngest of three brothers, Vikas, returned from his fathers shop in Ballygunge around 8.30 pm, his house was packed with relatives who had come on the occasion of Saraswati puja. 

 The Guptas are a joint family with Vikass father Krishan Nath sharing the two-storey building with his four brothers. Vikass eldest brother works for a stock-broking firm and the other looks after the family business like him. Owners of two oil mills and a wheat-grinding mill in Ballygunge and grocery shops in Kasba, the Guptas kept to themselves. 

 Before stepping out, Vikas had tea at home. He would have left for the shop again to finally return around midnight.

 Police have detained Dilip Gupta, the grocer, and local youths are being questioned.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Poll graffiti on govts priority list

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, March 8: The government today issued a notification directing all district magistrates, superintendents of police and the city police commissioner to erase graffiti.

 The notification follows the governments resolve to implement a 1976 act that bans defacement of all buildings across Bengal. 

 According to the order, top priority should be given to restoration of walls defaced by poll graffiti. Erasing wall writings has already begun in the districts, chief electoral officer Debasish Sen said.

 Chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb held a meeting with him and home secretary Prasad Ranjan Roy to formulate a strategy on erasing graffiti.

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, who met Deb this morning, is learnt to have said that he is not prepared to hear a single complaint from the poll panel or its observers regarding graffiti.

 I have asked the city police commissioner to ensure that erasing graffiti begins tomorrow morning. We expect the work to be over in a fortnight, Deb told The Telegraph.

 Trinamul Congress activist Soni Yadav was arrested late last night while trying to paste poll posters on a Calcutta High Court wall.

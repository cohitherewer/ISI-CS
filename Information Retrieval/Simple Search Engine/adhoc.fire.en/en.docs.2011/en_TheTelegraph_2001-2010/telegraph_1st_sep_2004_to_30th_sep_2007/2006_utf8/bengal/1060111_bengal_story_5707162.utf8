 BRIEFS

 Burdwan, Jan. 10: Scolded for not attending his tuition, Anirban Dutta, 17, who would have sat for the HS exam this year, committed suicide here last night. 

 He had scored 82 per cent in Madhyamik. Aloke Dutta, an Eastern Coalfields officer, admonished his son after the tutor complained that he went to a fair with friends skipping class. 

 Alipurduar: A Trinamul Congress supporter, Nabyeswari Das, 42, died on Tuesday after being kicked in the abdomen, allegedly by a CPM leader. Three Trinamul workers, injured in the clash during a rural body meeting, 15 km from here, are in hospital. Four CPM leaders have been held, but not the main accused, Adhir Das.

 Barasat: Abdul Gaffar, the Trinamul MLA from Baduria in North 24-Parganas, wanted in a 1994 case of rioting and damaging property, got anticipatory bail from the district court here on Tuesday. Party chief Mamata Banerjee, also wanted in the case, has refused to surrender.

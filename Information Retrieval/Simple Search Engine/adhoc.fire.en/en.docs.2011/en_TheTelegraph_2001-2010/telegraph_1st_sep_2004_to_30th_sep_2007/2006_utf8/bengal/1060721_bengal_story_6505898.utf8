The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Shark shield for wetlands

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, July 20: Having lost its heart ? Salt Lake ? to land sharks, the city needs to take urgent steps to protect its other parts by preventing the destruction of water bodies, CPM state secretary Biman Bose said today.

 He threatened stringent action against those carrying out constructions after filling up wetlands and said citizens resistance committees should be formed to stop these land sharks.

 I am extremely worried at the manner in which water bodies are being targeted by vested interests. It is for the people to form citizens resistance groups to combat land sharks. Enough is enough, and this will not be tolerated. The environment is getting polluted because of this, and such a thing cannot continue any longer, he said.

 Bose pointed out that several water bodies have been destroyed in the past when structures came up indiscriminately, thus affecting the ecosystem. 

 Citing Salt Lake as a prime example, the CPM leader said the township came up in an area that used to be the heart of the city. Calcutta has gone through enough stress and strain. After Salt Lake came into being, we lost the citys heart. Now we are left with Brigade only and it is the citys pacemaker. So I appeal to all not to touch water bodies.

 When told that in many places, wetlands are being destroyed with political patronage, the CPM state secretary said people should protest against parties, too, if they are guilty. I would like to ask the people of any locality to protest if a political party is involved. When I am saying this, I mean it. Nobody will be spared, he said.

 According to Bose, an ideal way to prevent environmental degradation is to ask builders to create a water body. That would benefit the ecosystem greatly, he said.

 The state government should introduce a condition that any construction should be followed by the creation of a water body there. For example, if a hospital or a school is constructed, water bodies should be created adjacent to them. Otherwise, people of the state will suffer miserably in the days to come. the CPM leader said.

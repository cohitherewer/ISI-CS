The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Painter without the brush

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Oct. 18: Last month, Rohitashwa Ghosh introduced himself as a painter seeking to rent a room for his works. 

 He flashed his voter I-card, said he was married with two kids and explained that he needed space for his paintings and nothing else. 

 Sipra Sarkar, who owns a two-storey building on Behalas Brojen Mukherjee Road, was impressed.

 The 68-year-old landlady had a sneaking suspicion about his new tenant, though, when he turned up in the small room with a collection of paintings but no paint or paintbrush. 

 It proved correct early this morning when policemen accompanied Rohitashwa to the flat. The alleged fake art dealer unlocked his room for the force to troop in and take his prized possessions away. 

 He had said hed soon get his brush and paint from his Birbhum house. Then he told us that some of the paintings with him would fetch up to Rs 10 lakh abroad, said Sipra. Her ground-floor room, which has housed tenants for over a decade, was sealed today.

 For the few days that he lived there, Rohitashwa kept to himself, watching news on his portable TV and rustling up food for himself.

 Sipra, whose son went missing two decades ago and never returned home, often thought Rohitashwa was like him as he disappeared.

 Calcutta, Aug. 24: A battle raged on the streets of Calcutta today as police rained blows on anti-quota protesters marching to Writers Buildings.

 Hundreds of students and doctors blocked the Central Avenue-B.B. Ganguly Street crossing from 3.15 pm to protest the Centres proposed reservation for Other Backward Classes in higher education. 

 Members of Youth For Equality, a national anti-quota forum, had started gathering at Medical College and Hospital since morning. 

 From there, they set off for Esplanade for a meeting, but changed their plan midway and headed towards Writers. At the Central Avenue-B.B. Ganguly Street crossing, they tried to break a cordon, and the police put their batons to work.

 About 200 protesters were rounded up in the evening. They were taken to the police headquarters at Lalbazar and put in the central lock-up. 

 A health department official said the quota has been proposed for centrally-aided institutions, which do not include any of the medical colleges in Calcutta. So there is no need for such a movement here.

 The police justified the lathi-charge, saying the protesters were rushing towards a high-security zone. Two persons, identified as Kinsul Sinha of NIFT (National Institute of Fashion Technology) and Tapas Chakraborty of IISWBM (Indian Institute of Social Welfare and Business Management), received injuries. Two of our constables were also injured, an officer said.

 But Tapas said the police action was unprovoked.

 They didnt even spare our women members who were brutally beaten up by male police personnel, he said, blood gushing out of a wound at the corner of his right eye. 

 Asked to comment on the fracas, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said: I didnt know. Im hearing this from you.

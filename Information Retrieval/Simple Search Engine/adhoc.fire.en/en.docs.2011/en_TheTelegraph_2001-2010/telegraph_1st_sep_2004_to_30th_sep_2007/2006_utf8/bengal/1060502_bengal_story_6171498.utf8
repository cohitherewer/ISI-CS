The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Have City Centre amp; Inox, who needs Cal? 

Nandita Roy, 38, likes to try out recipes. She may flavour her soups with basil. Or garnish a dish with strips of yellow and red bell pepper. 

 For that Nandita ? an articulate woman with very measured speech and avid reader of contemporary Bengali fiction ? does not have to live in Calcutta or shop for the ingredients in the city. Fresh herbs and vegetables used in continental dishes, like parsley, leek, lettuce or the more pricey avocado, are as easily available in Durgapur as in Calcutta, let alone the common mushroom and strawberry or dried and bottled sage, rosemary and thyme. 

 Nandita buys them at the Big Bazaar in City Centre, where the shelves are crowded with English vegetables. The avocado looks a little tired, but that is understandable ? it has come a long way. 

 So has Durgapur, once a quiet industrial town where smoking steel and power plants defined the skyline. The pollution is still heavy, but skyscrapers (ok, theres only one big one so far called Kanakangan), shopping malls and an upcoming Inox with four screens define it now. 

 Looming on the horizon are a Taj business hotel, a health hub with colleges and hospitals and the final proof that Durgapur is as discerning as Calcutta: an upcoming Mainland China restaurant. 

 If development is equated with lifestyle, one part of Durgapur is rocking ? so hard that anyday a top-draw Bangla band may come out of it. 

 But while that happens and Indigo at Durgapurs Peerless Inn keeps the citys young ? and some old ? busy till late hours, Nandita is happy that these changes have come. Big city benefits have come to her at a small town price. 

 Nandita sends her daughter to a high-end school, though she would not have minded if its fees were also small town. Her daughter is Akasha. She is 13 and a student of Class VIII. Appropriately for her name, Akasha wants to be an astronaut and work for Nasa. Shes still a child. But we will help her realise her dreams, smiles Nandita. 

 Her husband is a mechanical engineer with Durgapur Steel Plant (DSP) and his three-room quarters have all the white goods. She laughs as she makes a list ? a Maruti car, a two-wheeler, a microwave, a washing machine, an AC, a PC, a fridge, a television?. The Roys also own a flat in Nagerbazar, Calcutta. 

 Staying in Durgapur means that Akasha will have to go away for higher education. Staying in Durgapur also means that Nandita has to compromise on certain other items. 

 Ill vote, of course. It is one of the few rights I can exercise, it makes me feel important, she says. But Ill vote for the CPM because I have to. Because theres no alternative. 

 While there is all this talk about development across Bengal, look at the things that have not changed in Durgapur. Hospitals are in bad shape. We dont visit the DSP Hospital. I dont know of anyone except my maid who has gone to the government hospital. If someones seriously ill, we have to run to Calcutta. 

 The same with education ? good institutions have closed down because they were Bengali medium. The school where I send my daughter is good. But many English schools are minting money without offering quality education because the CPM government had decided to ban English, she says. 

 There are no bomb blasts here. But petty crime is on the rise. There was a chain-snatching in the neighbourhood the other day. 

 Do you think this is happening only because of poverty? she challenges and then answers it herself: its the flip side of the boom the town is witnessing. Boys in the slums are toting mobiles and trendy goggles, just like us. Where will the money come from? asks Nandita.

 Her neighbour Mitali Banerjee, however, insists that this change is because of poverty, much of it caused by the closure of many plants. 

 DSP registered a profit last year after two decades, but many public sector units, such as Mining and Allied Machineries Corporation, Hindustan Fertilisers and Bengal Ophthalmic Glass, have been shut. 

 The employees of these organisations live outside cool Durgapur, in crumbling buildings surrounded by unkempt gardens. Have you been there? asks Mitali.

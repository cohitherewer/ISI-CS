The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Good cop again

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Sergeant Soumendu Bhattacharya

Calcutta, May 13: A traffic sergeant switched a signal green realising a man inside a bus was unwell and led the vehicle to SSKM Hospital this morning.

 Nil Kamal Hansda, a Cal- cutta Municipal Corporation employee, had felt an acute pain in his chest while travelling on route 206. A resident of Santoshpur, he was on his way to an ENT specialist at SSKM with his wife Lata. 

 By the time the vehicle reached Minto Park, the pain was so acute that Hansda, 40, fell off his seat. Fearing the worst, Lata broke down.

 As the bus waited at the AJC Bose Road-Lord Sinha Road intersection, sergeant Soumendu Bhattacharya noticed commotion inside. 

 It was around 11.20 and I was stationed at the Exide Crossing. The driver looked distressed and said he feared that a passenger had suffered a heart attack, recalled Bhattacharya. He immediately got the signal changed to green, led the bus out of the jam and escorted it to the hospital.

 He was also there with the Hansdas at its outpatient department. The civic employee was senseless by then.

 In the absence of an ambulance at the emergency section, Bhattacharya hailed a taxi and took Hansda to the cardiology wing, about 200 metres away. 

 He later called up Hansdas son Susanta from his mobile.

 An ECG revealed that the heart was fine. The pain had been caused by gas in the stomach.

 Hansda is home now. He is better after taking the medicines prescribed by the doctors, smiled Susanta.

 He found it impossible to thank the policeman enough. He did a great job. My father had become senseless in pain and my mom was so upset?. 

 Yesterday, another traffic sergeant, P.S. Mukherjee, had rushed an elderly man to hospital as most passersby looked away at ever-busy Gariahat.

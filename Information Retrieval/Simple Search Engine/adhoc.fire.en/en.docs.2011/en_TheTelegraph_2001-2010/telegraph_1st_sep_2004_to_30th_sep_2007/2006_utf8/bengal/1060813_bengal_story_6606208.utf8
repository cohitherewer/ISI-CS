 Timber nexus slur on troops

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Siliguri, Aug. 12: Forest department officials have alleged that army personnel aided alleged timber thieves to chop a sal tree in a protected Baikunthapur forest area.

 Two persons were arrested in connection with this late last night. 

 Today, A.K. Samanta, the divisional forest officer of Baikunthapur, about 10 km from Siliguri, claimed some jawans posted in nearby Salugara had helped the thieves, supplying them with tools and offered them protection from the forest guards.

 During a night-long raid yesterday, we came across a group of about five army jawans watching three persons fell a sal tree, Samanta said.

 On seeing us, they fled into the army campus adjacent to the forest. We gave a chase and arrested Dhan Bahadur Biswakarma of Salugara and Dhiren Singh of Naxalbari. The third fled, Samanta said. 

 He said the arrested duo, on interrogation, confessed to being hired by army personnel. The timber thieves have said an army officer paid them Rs 60 each for chopping down the tree. 

 We have also come to know that the men had breakfast on the army campus yesterday. They were also provided with tools like saws, iron bars, axes and ropes by the armymen, Samanta alleged. 

 The divisional forest officer said he would write to the Jalpaiguri chief judicial magistrate on Monday informing him about the incident. 

 The army has denied the allegation. 

 It is a total lie, a senior army officer said. Our men are in no way involved with timber thieves. 

 The army official instead accused the forest department of helping timber thieves. Forest officials and guards work hand-in-glove with each other, he said. On several occasions, we have seen trees being felled in the presence of forest authorities. We raised objections several times, to no avail. 

 The army officer also cited that the force had planted 5,000 saplings during Van Mahotsav. The army is doing a commendable job in the region by protecting the forest, he said.

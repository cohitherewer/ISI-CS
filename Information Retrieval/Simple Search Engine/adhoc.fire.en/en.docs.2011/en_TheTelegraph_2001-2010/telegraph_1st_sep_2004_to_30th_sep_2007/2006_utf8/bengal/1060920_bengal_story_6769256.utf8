 Condom cloud lifts

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, Sept. 19: Land acquisition for the Tata car factory will not be stalled by the condom manufacturers court case in Calcutta. 

 The high court today fixed the next date of hearing on Thursday, the day the 900-acre plot will officially become the governments. 

 Justice Jayanta Biswas directed the government to file an affidavit in the court on that day saying it has acquired the condom factorys land under provisions of the West Bengal Land Acquisition Act, something the petitioner has disputed. 

 Moving the petition on behalf of Kailash Richter Technology, advocate Pradosh Mallik said the company had obtained permission from the local panchayat, the pollution control board and the Union commerce ministry before the state asked it to vacate the four-acre plot. 

 The government is citing employment opportunities in the Tata project. Ours is also a big project. Employment will be generated in our project also, Mallik said. 

 Land reforms commissioner Sukumar Das was happy with the court proceedings. The case will come up for hearing in the afternoon. By 11 am on September 21, the land will vest with the government. According to the law, the collector can then take possession of the land, whether compensation has been paid or not. 

 Once the plot takeover process is completed, the court cannot stay it.

 Das also said the rubber company had not taken permission for conversion of land from his department while building the factory. If we want, we can prosecute them for not getting the conversion and mutation done. They have built a factory on agricultural land without our departments clearance, he added.

 Among the other industrial units on the land earmarked for Tata Motors in Singur, about 40 km from Calcutta, a cold storage has already given consent to the acquisition.

 The agriculture co-operatives will assess the investment in the cold storage and the PWD will calculate the investment made by the other industries before the compensation is decided. The amounts will be declared on Thursday. 

 The government will begin giving the cheques to the landlosers from Saturday, said district magistrate Vinod Kumar. Thirteen payment counters will be opened in five villages. Even those who havent given their land willingly are deemed to have handed it over, Pandey added.

 Those who dont collect their cheques now will have to collect them from court, where they will be deposited.

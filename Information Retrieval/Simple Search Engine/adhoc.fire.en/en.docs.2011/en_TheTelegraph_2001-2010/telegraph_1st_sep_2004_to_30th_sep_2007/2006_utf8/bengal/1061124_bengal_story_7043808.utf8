The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 CM warns of Singur fallout

 OUR BUREAU

 Nov. 23: Continuous agitation against the Tata Motors project is sending a wrong message to investors, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee told the Opposition in the Assembly today.

 Your continuous agitation over Singur has sent a wrong message to investors across the country and abroad that Bengal is not an easy destination, Bhattacharjee said.

 He was replying to an adjournment motion brought by leader of the Opposition and Trinamul Congress MLA Partha Chatterjee.

 The chief minister said the government would submit a policy statement related to industry, agriculture and urbanisation in the current session of the House.

 He dismissed the Oppositions the charge that the administration was using police to curb the democratic agitation against farmland acquisition at Singur. Police will take action if attempts are made to stall government work, the chief minister said.

 There were heated exchanges between Bhattacharjee and members of the Opposition, who later staged a walk-out raising slogans against the government. When the House resumed at 3 pm, Opposition members squatted in the well of the House in protest against alleged police assault on three farmers at Singur today.

 Siliguri, Aug. 26: Biswajit Majumder, the CID constable arrested yesterday for his alleged involvement in planting explosives in two petrol pumps in the heart of this town, has been released without charges.

 Three others Kailash Roy, another CID constable, Paritosh Roy, a resident of this town and driver Purna Biswakarma who were apprehended in a Maruti van yesterday, were produced before a first class magistrate in Jalpaiguri today. They were remanded in police custody for seven days.

 The trio has been charged under various provisions of the Indian Penal Code.

 Jalpaiguri police superintendent, Tripurari, told The Telegraph that Biswajit was released late last night as police did not find any evidence to prove his involvement in the case. Biswajit was grilled by senior police officers, including deputy inspector-general of police (special), CID, P. Ravi, who had flown down from Calcutta.

 Biswajit was released less than 24 hours after inspector-general of police, north Bengal, K.L. Meena, had told a news conference yesterday that all four had been apprehended near the Indian Oil Corporation depot near New Jalpaiguri station in a Maruti van with explosive devices.

 It was learnt that investigating officers differed with Meena later in the evening and insisted that Biswajit was picked up from his Pradhannagar residence.

 The anomalies in what the police told journalists came to light when a senior CID officer, who did not want to be named, said Biswajit was on duty at Pradhannagar police station yesterday morning when he was summoned to the New Jalpaiguri outpost, where he was detained. Biswajit, the officer said, was back on duty today. He, however, could not be contacted.

 Ravi preferred not to comment on the case. Since the case is under investigation, we would prefer not to comment, he said over the phone from Calcutta.

 CID sources said Kailash was jealous of Biswajit as he was the blue-eyed boy of the force and used to be sent on important assignments. This, according to CID officers, could be the reason why Kailash put Biswajit into a trap.

 Police have reportedly found large sums of money in Kailashs bank accounts which are disproportionate to his income. We cannot rule out the possibility of his links with extremist outfits, which might have offered him a substantial sum if he executed his so-called assigned task (to plant bombs) successfully, an official said.

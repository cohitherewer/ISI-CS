 Circus elephant on the run

Bolpur, Oct. 3: Frightened by a burst of crackers, a circus elephant broke its chains last night and went around Bolpur. 

 Having walked the streets of the Birbhum district town for some two hours, the animal slipped into a water-logged field where it sprayed itself and trumpeted, as if in relief. 

 After playing its part garlanding a Shiv lingam in the Ajanta Circus show at Dakbangla Maidan with three mates, the elephant was back to fetters in a corner of the fi- eld around 8.30 pm. 

 Bolpur forest officer Satya Sundar Bhattacharya said that scared hearing the burst of crackers, it started looking for a safer place. It was not properly tied after the show and the main gate was open.

 A young man, Mrinal Sarkar, was the first to see the jumbo walk down Santiniketan Road. It emerged from the dark before him and he fell from his bicycle. I closed my eyes and remained still for about two minutes. When I opened my eyes, the elephant had gone past me, Sarkar said.

 It ambled towards a gymnasium in the Mission Compound area of the town and then changed direction and took Santiniketan Road again, heading towards Bolpur station. 

 By this time, word had spread about the elephant on the loose. Across the town, scared pedestrians and drivers were asking passers-by which way the animal was moving. 

 The elephant turned away from the station and headed in the opposite direction.

 Puja organisers at Nichupatty, who were busy managing pandal-hoppers, froze seeing an elephant staring at them, the illumination in its background and Bollywood remix blaring from loudspeakers. 

 We managed to switch off the loudspeakers. But the elephant did not harm us. It turned back and started walking towards Muluk village, said Abhijit Nandi, a youth from Burdwan who had come to a relative here, about 190 km from Calcutta. 

 At Layekbazar, the elephant came across the puddle. By then, a police jeep carrying deputy magistrate Arindam Dutta and a circus team had caught up with it. 

 Dutta said the elephant recognised familiar faces in the circus team. It sprinkled water on them. We were able to escort it back to the circus tent around 11 pm, he added. 

 The circus, Dutta said, has been warned and told to take care of its animals.

 JU hand in development

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 Calcutta, Sept. 25: Jadavpur Uni- versity has been drafted in by the government to prepare a plan for the all-round development of South 24-Parganas, a backward district now set to see a spurt in urbanisation primarily because it is sandwiched between Calcutta and the burgeoning Haldia. 

 A committee of experts from various departments has already been set up. It will draw up development pro-ject proposals that can be placed before the Planning Commission and funds sought from the Centre. 

 Well cover every aspect of development in our programme, said Parthasarathi Biswas, a teacher of JUs construction engineering department and one of the two co-ordinators of the committee.

 The government requested JUs help early this month. The first meeting of the committee was held recently in the presence of senior government officials.

 Urbanisation is expected to take place fast in South 24-Parganas, particularly because of investments promised by the Salim Group, Biswas said. 

 The Indonesia-based conglomerate will build a 700-acre township at Baruipur, where the district headquarters will be relocated, an expressway leading to Haldia much of which will pass through the district and plazas along the road complete with entertainment and lodging facilities. 

 Such an assignment comes rarely, Biswas said. JU will offer its expertise free of cost. 

 Its departments of water resource management, chemical engineering, construction engineering, power plant engineering, physics and economics will be involved in the project. Other streams such as humanities will contribute to planning the development of human resource and minority affairs.

 The panel will not stress only development of urban areas. It has been asked to give equal importance to agriculture. District magistrate Roshni Sen said JU will give a report on how to convert less fertile land into multi-crop tracts.

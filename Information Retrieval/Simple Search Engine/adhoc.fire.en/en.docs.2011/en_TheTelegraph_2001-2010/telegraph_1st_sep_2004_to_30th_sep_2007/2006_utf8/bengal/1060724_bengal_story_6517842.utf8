 Barrackpore, July 23: While the nation prayed for Prince, a motley crowd formed a half-circle around a newborn, wrapped in a yellow bedsheet, off the tracks near Kanchrapara station in North 24-Parganas.

 The residents looked on. The baby sometimes seemed to be moving, but no one dared touch it because everyone was scared of police. 

 The police took 25 hours to arrive. When Government Railway Police personnel from Naihati, more than 7 km away, made it to the scene finally, the baby was dead.

 We saw the baby around 11.30 am yesterday. It was still alive and I saw it move its tiny feet under the sheet. But we did not take the initiative to rescue it as we were scared of harassment, said Sunny Das, a railway hawker and resident of Line Bustee, around 40 km from Calcutta.

 Sunnys neighbour Sadhan Mondal was not sure if the baby was alive when he saw it. But he, too, was scared of a brush with the police. 

 One of the residents called up the local Bijpur police station ? about 3 km away ? last night and at 8.30 this morning informing it about the cloth bundle with the baby inside. But the officer who picked up the phone said it was outside the police stations jurisdiction and that he would inform the railway police at Naihati, said Sadhan, who sells ball-pens.

 We should have at least found out whether the baby was alive and arranged its treatment, he said as an afterthought. 

 But the police would have harassed us?.

 The baby the railway personnel saw was stiff and cold. It was a girl.

 We received a call from an unidentified person and rushed. The local police sta-tion did not inform us, said S.H. Mirza, the GRP officer-in-charge of Naihati. 

 North 24-Parganas additional superintendent of police Basab Dasgupta said the Bijpur police station had not received any call. Had we received it, we would have definitely informed the GRP.

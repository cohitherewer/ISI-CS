The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 CM focus on south showing

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, May 21: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today rued that the Left Front, which won over 50 per cent of the votes in the Assembly polls, could not achieve the target in South 24-Parganas.

 It was Anil Biswass last wish to see an increase in the Left Front tally and vote share from the district, the chief minister told a meeting at Jadavpurs Kishore Bharati stadium, held to remember the late state CPM chief.

 We were able to achieve an increase in the number of seats from the district but could not get 50 per cent of the votes, though the percentage was over 50 in Bengal as a whole, Bhattacharjee said.

 It is imperative for us to fulfil this target to defeat any kind of mahajot (grand alliance) against us, Bhattacharjee added.

 He urged party cadre from South 24-Parganas to ensure that the Left polled more than half the votes in the next election. If you want to defeat the challenge of a mahajot by the Opposition parties in the future, make it your aim to cross 50 per cent of the vote share.

 The chief minister and state CPM secretary Biman Bose spoke at length on the need to weed out corruption from the party. 

 Bhattacharjee, who along with Biswas oversaw party affairs in South 24-Parganas, said the district committee members had met yesterday to assess the CPMs performance in the polls. 

 The meeting decided that the party would make no compromise with corruption. We cant say that our party is free from corruption. But we will not allow even 1 per cent of it, Bhattacharjee said.

 We must weed out corruption from the party through reform and purge. We shall sever all links with those we fail to reform.

 Bhattacharjee also criticised the Congress-led and CPM-supported Centre. We support the UPA government on some issues, not all. We cannot support the Centre on their financial policies. As for other policy matters, we cant support the growing relationship with the US, he added.

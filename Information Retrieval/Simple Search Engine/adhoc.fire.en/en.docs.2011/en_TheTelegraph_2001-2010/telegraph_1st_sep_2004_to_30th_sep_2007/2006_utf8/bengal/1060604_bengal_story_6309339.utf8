 CCTV to keep an eye on cops

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 3: They keep a watch on crime. Now, police are set to be under the scanner, round the clock.

 Close-circuit televisions (CCTVs) will be set up at all the 48 police stations in the city to rein in officers harassing people who come to lodge complaints.

 Once CCTVs are installed at police stations, we would be able to keep tabs on our officers round the clock. We can find out whether the allegations against policemen are correct. The objective is to make the department transparent, said Kuldiep Singh, the joint commissioner of police (administration). 

 Officers at the Lalbazar control room will monitor activities in police stations on their computers. Officers will be under pressure. They will be conscious as all their activities will be recorded. The CCTVs will store the recordings for one week, Singh said.

 According to an officer, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattarcharjee gave the nod to the proposal when senior police officials met him at Writers Buildings last week. 

 The installations will be carried out in phases. 

 Complaints of harassment at police stations have been pouring into the Lalbazar headquarters for some time, prompting the chief minister to urge the police to be friendly and helpful.

 We get complaints every month, especially from areas like Bowbazar, New Market, Burrabazar, Posta, Bhowanipore and Shakespeare Sarani against the polices high-handedness and refusal to lodge FIRs. CCTVs will play an important role in reining in these policemen. Strict action will be taken against errant cops, Singh said.

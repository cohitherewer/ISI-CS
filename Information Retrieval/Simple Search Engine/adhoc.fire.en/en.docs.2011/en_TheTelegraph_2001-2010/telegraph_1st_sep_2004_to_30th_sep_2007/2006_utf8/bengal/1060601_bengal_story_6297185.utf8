The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Farm panel for policy push

 - Balancing act: with industry, efforts on to boost agriculture

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, May 31: The chief minister today announced the setting up of an agriculture commission to ensure better implementation of the governments agriculture policy. 

 The panel will include finance minister Asim Dasgupta, agriculture minister Naren De, panchayat and rural development minister Surjya Kanta Mishra and agriculture scientist M.S. Swaminathan.

 At todays cabinet meeting, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee told his colleagues that the commission would work towards boosting agriculture infrastructure, horticulture, quality of crops and their marketing. We have set up the commission to improve our performance in agriculture.

 Along with the agriculture minister, Bhattacharjee will fix the commissions terms of reference.

 Officials associated with the implementation of the agriculture policy drawn up in 2003 said the chief minister had consulted Swaminathan (in picture above) time and again before formulating the new farm policy to fit a market-driven economy.

 The policy that the government had drawn up in consultation with consultants McKinsey had envisaged a market-driven approach towards farming with emphasis on cash crops and a shift in crop pattern where there was a glut of traditional produce. 

 Better front

 The chief minister today also announced a committee headed by chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb for better governance. 

 We have set up the committee for a transparent and dy- namic administration, Bhattacharjee said. It will include the home secretary and experts from IIM Joka and ISI.

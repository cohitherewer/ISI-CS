The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Panel on bridge mishap

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, May 30: A committee has been constituted by the Second Vivekananda Bridge Tollway Company (SVBTC) to investigate the accidents that occurred during the construction of the bridge connecting Howrah with Calcutta.

 Accidents are accidents and can happen in any project of such magnitude. But we have formed a committee to investigate the matter, particularly the cause of the slip of mechanical parts. A report should be submitted in a month, said S.S. Chakraborty, the chairman of the company.

 A couple of weeks ago, a portion of the bridge over the Hooghly collapsed, killing two and injuring two labourers. Around 10 to 12 additional safety measures have been introduced in each of the 75 workstations, Chakraborty said. A quality system is in operation and there has been no failure in the actual construction of the bridge.

 The bridge, scheduled for completion by April 2007, is on track to meet the deadline, an official said.

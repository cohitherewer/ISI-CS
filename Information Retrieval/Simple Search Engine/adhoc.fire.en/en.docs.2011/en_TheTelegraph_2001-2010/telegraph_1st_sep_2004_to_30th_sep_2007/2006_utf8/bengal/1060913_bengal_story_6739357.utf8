 The Telegraph report on Anchala Pramanicks 

 death

Midnapore, Sept. 12: A team working for the Supreme Court has slammed the local administration in West Midnapores hunger belt for trivialising suffering and glossing over a starvation death.

 The group of four, which toured villages in Belpahari last month, handed in its re- port last week to the commissioners appointed to monitor implementation of the apex courts order on the right to food. Copies of it have also been sent to the Bengal government and the state human rights commission.

 After Anchala Pramanick, a tribal woman in her 40s who survived on water for seven days, died crying for a little rice last month, the local administration had balked at calling it a starvation death. 

 The probe panel has rapped the Binpur-II block health officer, who had said in his report that Anchalas death was caused probably from cardio-respiratory failure after prolonged suffering.

 The BMOH (block medical officer of health) does not make any comment on the womans nutritional status even though that is the main question that has been raised. Nor does he comment on (the) availability of food with the family which would have been one of the essential elements of any nutrition given to her, the probe team has pointed out.

 The team visited Bamundiha, Namopara, Dompara, Amlashol, Kankrajhor and Shimulpal, about 250 km from Calcutta, between August 27 and 29, and interviewed villagers. 

 Whether it (Anchalas) was medically a starvation death or not has become a subject of debate which is in very bad taste. It has involved trivialisation of the very hard circumstances in which she lived and died and in which her family continues to live, the report says.

 The team has mentioned that it found lack of food in many families. 

 In one of the villages, Dompara, 99 per cent of the people are living on one meal a day. Amal Midya, a villager, told the team that his family went without food on August 27 and 28. Sukra Shabar of Amlashol was also living on a single meal a day. 

 The report says that pensions under central poverty alleviation schemes were not being given. Many of the villagers had not received the money for months. 

 However, according to the report submitted by the Binpur-II BDO to the team on August 28, there was a balance of Rs 53,278 in the pension account. The money, had it been utilised, would have been enough to pay the old-age benefit to all 60 pensioners in the block for the past nine months.

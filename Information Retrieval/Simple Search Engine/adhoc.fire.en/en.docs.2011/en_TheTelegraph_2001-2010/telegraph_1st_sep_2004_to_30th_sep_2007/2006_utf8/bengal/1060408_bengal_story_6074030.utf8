 Tippler cripples school

 ABHIJEET CHATTERJEE

 Durgapur, April 7: Most students of a primary school in Bankura are not being sent there by parents apparently because the headmaster has a drinking habit, though he denies doing so in working hours.

 The guardians had lodged a complaint with the district inspector of schools against A.N. Mukherjee, the head of Kotalpur Primary School in Onda, 260 km from Calcutta.

 District primary school council chairman Shakti Ranjan Bose told Mukherjee: I shouldnt hear such complaints when I come back for another inspection on April 19.

 But five boys have already left the school that has 75 students from Class I to IV, two permanent teachers ? one of them Mukherjee ? and a para-teacher (on contract). 

 Some of the students who had stopped coming to school earlier have returned after Boses visit, though. We hope all students would come back and the headmaster would mend his ways, said A.K. Samanta, a member of the Kotalpur village education committee.

 Mukherjee, who has been working at the school for 10 years, admitted that he drinks. I drink at night and on holidays? never on the school premises. Whats wrong if Im drinking at home? he asked. 

 The teachers alleged that he almost always smells of al-cohol and is also not in a position to speak properly.

 Sujoy Bauri, a Class IV student, echoed his teachers. My friends from other schools make fun of our headmaster. I have asked my father to change my school. 

 The allegations, Mukher- jee said, are a conspiracy to malign me because I ask the teachers to come on time and take classes properly. 

 The teachers denied getting any such instruction.

 Girls drown, mother rescued

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Durgapur, July 20: A 36-year-old woman tried to commit suicide by jumping into the Damodar after throwing her two children ? Sukanya, 3, and Sandhya, 4 ? into the river last evening.

 Poonam Gupta, a resident of Shaknara village in Burdwan, was rescued by villagers but her daughters could not be traced, police said. 

 She kissed her children before throwing them into the water and then jumped off Krishak Setu, a bridge on the Damodar, said an officer of the local police station. 

 The villagers who rescued her said Poonam was depressed as her husband Chedilal, an iron scrap trader, would abuse her for giving birth to two girls. He would ask her to get money from her parents to bear the expenses of her daughters, said a villager.

 Poonam was rushed to Burdwan Medical College and Hospital and was reported to be critical. She sustained severe chest and head injuries during the fall from a height of about 40 metres, a doctor said.

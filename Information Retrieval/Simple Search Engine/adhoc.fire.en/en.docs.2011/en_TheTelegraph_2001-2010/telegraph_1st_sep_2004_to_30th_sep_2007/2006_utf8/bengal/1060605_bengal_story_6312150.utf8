The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Bereaved, but thanks for brave doctor

 - Kashmir 

scares them but the Dattas love the Kashmiris 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Idyllic, but for some 

 Calcutta, June 4: The Dattas of Kasba will probably never set foot in Kashmir again, but they havent forgotten the samaritans of Srinagar without whom their tragedy could be worse.

 With head of the family Swaraj Datta dead in Wednesdays grenade attacks on tourists from Bengal, and his son Sujay and daughter-in-law Sumona bed-ridden in hospital after multiple surgeries, the scars will take long to heal.

 But that will not come in the way of Sujays brother Sanjiv writing to his new found friends in Srinagar to thank them for the help.

 One of them is Dr Majid, the surgeon at SKIMS Hospital who saved Sumonas left leg by performing a difficult operation in far-from-ideal conditions. And there are the two young men who worked tirelessly to collect the 14 bottles of blood that were so crucial for the two successive surgeries that saved the kathak enthusiast from amputation.

 The doctors in Calcutta who have examined Sumonas leg all agree that had it not been for Dr Majid, she would have probably lost her leg. The surgeon actually cut out a vein from her thigh and used it to repair one that was damaged in her leg, Sanjiv said.

 This is a very complicated surgery ? yet he managed to do it successfully at a government hospital that lacked proper infrastructure. We are moved more than we can express.

 The Dattas were in one of the two buses, carrying tourists from Bengal, that were attacked with grenades by suspected militants near the Dal Lake in Srinagar. Apart from Swaraj, Sujay and Sumona, the group of six included Sujays mother Bithi and Sumonas parents Biplab and Rubita Datta.

 Swaraj was the only tourist to die in the blasts that injured at least 23 others. They have now been flown back to Calcutta.

 Sumona was rushed to a city hospital straight from the airport last night. After a two-hour surgery this morning, she was shifted to the intensive care unit. Doctors said it would be three months before she stands on her feet again.

 Biplab, too, had minor surgery and was transferred to a bed near Sujay, who was operated on last evening.

 When my brother Somnath and I reached Srinagar the day after the grenade attack, Sumonas mother broke down before us. She said her daughters left leg might have to be amputated. Its a miracle that her leg has been saved, Sanjiv said.

 And it wasnt only the doctor, so many people there helped us ? the police officers, the airport officials, the two men who arranged for those vital bottles of blood. Imagine trying to collect 14 bottles of blood at night in this city ? youll understand how difficult it must have been for them. How can we forget them?

 Other injured tourists and their families have also spoken warmly of the help they received from the people of Srinagar. The attacks, however, are certain to deter many in Bengal from visiting Kashmir.

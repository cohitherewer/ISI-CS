The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Rules go up in smoke

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Sept. 21: A little over a year since the death of police officer Prabal Sengupta, lessons on handling improvised explosive devices (IEDs) seem to have been lost somewhere in the pages of instruction manuals.

 Or else, officers of the bomb disposal squad would not have repeated the mistake today that the officer-in-charge of Barikul police station made while opening a black leather and canvas bag in July 2005.

 After Barikul, one of the lessons learnt was that one should never try to handle an IED on his own even after it has been defused. There are certain thumb rules to go about it and these should be strictly adhered to, said a senior officer of Calcutta polices bomb disposal squad.

 One of the basics, experts say, is to carry a portable X-ray machine to photograph the explosive. The X-ray plates can show the position of the coiled spring and other gadgets in the canister on the basis of which experts can identify the type of IED and see if it is fitted with a timer.

 Cutting off wires neednt necessarily mean that the explosive has been defused and the circuit broken. Instead of trying to open it in a crude manner, the officers could have used a bomb blanket on the canister, as is the rule, an officer said. Using a bomb blanket to cover an IED while trying to defuse it ensures that in case of an explosion, the tremor is absorbed.

 The canister should never have been handled in a place with people around, said an officer.

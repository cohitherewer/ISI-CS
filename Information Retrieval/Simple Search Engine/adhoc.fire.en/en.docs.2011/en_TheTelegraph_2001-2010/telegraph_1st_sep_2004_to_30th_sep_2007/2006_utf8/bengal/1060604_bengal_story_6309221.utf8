 Boy killed in road mishap

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Barasat, June 3: A speeding Tata Sumo crushed seven-year-old Babar Ali near Beliaghata bridge in the northern fringes of the city this morning.

 The boys mother, Jaifoon Biwi, is fighting for life in hospital.

 Police said Babar was on his way to the local market with Jaifoon.

 While the duo was crossing the road, a speeding Tata Sumo heading towards Bashirhat hit them and sped away, said Abdur Rahim, a local resident.

 The boy died before he could be taken to hospital. Jaifoon was admitted to hospital and put on emergency medical care by doctors.

 Soon after the incident, local residents put up a roadblock by placing tree trunks on the road and protested against the lack of police personnel on the road.

 They also demanded compensation for Jaifoon, who earns her living by working in a brick kiln after her husband deserted her.

 The roadblock continued for about three hours from 8 am. 

 The protesters lifted the blockade after a police contingent arrived and assured them to look into their demands.

 CPM reaches out to the rich amp; the 

 poor 

 - Industry, the poll mantra

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, Jan. 8: The CPM today declared industrialisation the key issue of the upcoming Assembly polls but reassured the rural poor that it wouldn?t come at their cost.

 The party kicked off its election campaign at Brigade Parade Grounds with leader after leader pledging that the rush for new factories and townships would not lead to rural Bengal being robbed of fertile land.

 Mamata Banerjee has been doing the rounds of the districts, raising the emotive issue of land acquisition to try and dent the CPM?s formidable rural vote bank. She has been telling people that if the Left Front returns to power, it would unveil a massive land-grab programme in favour of industrialists.

 The CPM leaders? speeches, before a gathering of over 15 lakh, was geared to defuse mainly that threat.

 ?Garib manush bachiye aamader unnayan hobe (deve-lopment will not come at the cost of the poor). We will carry them along, improving the quality of their life,? chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said.

 Former chief minister Jyoti Basu began by saying: ?So far, we have won elections on the strength of the poor?s vote. Now, we want votes from every stratum of the society.? But in the same breath, he stressed that the drive for industrialisation must not ignore the rural voter?s interests.

 ?Gram o shaharer madhye aikya gorte hobe; gorib o madhyabittor madhye aikya gorte hobe (We must build bridges between urban and rural Bengal, between the middle classes and the poor),? state party secretary Anil Biswas said.

 ?Urbanisation is taking place fast in our state in response to rising economic aspirations and changes in the demographic profile,? Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said. He mentioned the townships being built at Rajarhat, Howrah and Dankuni, the expansion of Siliguri and Haldia, and the rising number of municipalities.

 But his government, the chief minister said, would not copy the Mumbai, Hyderabad or Delhi models. ?Unlike these places, slums will not be demolished; large tracts of fertile land will not be taken over and people will not be evicted. We will keep in mind that the people supposed to benefit from development are the poor.?

 The CPM leaders, who included front chairman and party politburo member Biman Bose, spoke mainly in general terms and avoided specifics, perhaps mindful that the issue was a tricky one.

 ?Make no mistake, industrialisation will be the most important issue in this election,? Biswas declared. He said only industrialisation could create jobs on a large scale.

 The CPM leadership?s emphasis on balanced development was also meant to signal to its allies ? such as the Forward Bloc, RSP and CPI ? that it hadn?t forgotten the rural poor in its eagerness to woo capital. Some differences had earlier cropped up between the allies over the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government?s approach to development.

 The CPM leaders also said they didn?t see the Election Commission observers as enemies. ?Some people are expressing fears that the Election Commission is sending its observers to defeat us,? Basu said. 

 ?Why should that be? They are not our enemies. They are coming here to see that the elections are peaceful and transparent.?

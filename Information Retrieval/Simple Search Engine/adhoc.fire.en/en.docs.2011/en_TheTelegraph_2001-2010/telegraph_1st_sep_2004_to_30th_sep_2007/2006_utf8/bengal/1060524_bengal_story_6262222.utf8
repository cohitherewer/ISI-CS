The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Investor-land paradox

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, May 23: The government today admitted that when investments are pouring in finally, there isnt enough land to offer in places where investors want to set up shop. 

 We have no dearth of investment proposals, but we dont have land. Finding the land fast to match this high requirement is our priority now. If I give Tata Motors land tomorrow, they will start work on the car unit the day after, commerce and industries minister Nirupam Sen said today.

 Sen said the government was trying to complete the land acquisition process in six months to speed up the proposed projects. 

 However, the acquisition of the 25,000 acres identified for the chemical hub at Haldia will take more time, the minister said.

 Sen discussed the faster land acquisition process with land and land reforms minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah as well as the district magistra-tes of North and South 24-Parganas, Hooghly, Howrah and East and West Midnapore today. 

 Sens department has already identified areas around Calcutta, like Rajarhat, and Haldia, Sankrail and Uluberia, where investors have sought land and where land acquisition has to be carried out immediately. 

 The government is set to begin acquisition of 31,750 acres mainly in North and South 24-Parganas for seven major projects.

 Officials said the problem is that investors want plots mainly in districts close to Calcutta rather than in places like Bankura and Purulia where there is no dearth of land. 

 At times, however, we have difficulty finalising which tract of land to acquire. It all depends on what ultimately suits the investor. For Tata Motors, we had in mind the Kharagpur site all along and it was the one we showed them first. But they chose Singur instead, Sen said. It is a high-profile project and they wanted it somewhere nearer to Calcutta. 

 However, the industries department is yet to identify land for Salim Groups proposed industrial township and special economic zone near Sonarpur in South 24-Parganas.

 We will start scouting for land only after the Salim Group submits a detailed project report in early June, Sen said.

 Land sharks are also making the governments job difficult by grabbing plots well in advance. Land sharks are already active in areas around Calcutta. Vast tracts here have already been bought by them in anticipation and, consequently, prices here are spiralling, Sen said.

 Keen to spare farmland as much as possible, the government would mostly try to acquire single crop tracts, he said. Exceptions will, however, have to be made in areas like Singur, which has double-crop stretches.

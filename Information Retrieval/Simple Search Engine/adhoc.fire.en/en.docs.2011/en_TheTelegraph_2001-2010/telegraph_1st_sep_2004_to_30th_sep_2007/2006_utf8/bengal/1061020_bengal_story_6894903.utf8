 Teen trauma in cop gaffe

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Oct. 19: Mistaking a 15-year-old boy for a satta gang member, police last night picked him up and took him to various suspected gambling dens, only to later dump him at a graveyard on the outskirts of the town.

 A traumatised Pranoy Chakraborty, a Class IX student of Krishnagar Government School, fainted on returning home around 11 pm. His father Arun Chakraborty, a trader in Krishnagar, about 85 km from Calcutta, took Pranoy to hospital.

 Pranoy is stable now but is crying, shivering intermittently and behaving hysterically. Even if his mother touches him, he trembles, said Arun, who is also an RSP worker.

 In a trembling voice, the boy said that around 9 pm yesterday, while he was returning to his Nazirapara home in Krishnagar, a patrol car from Kotwali police station screeched to a halt beside him. Around seven policemen dragged me into the car and asked me to identify places where satta and other gambling activities are held. When I pleaded ignorance, they slapped me repeatedly.

 Pranoy said he was taken to several criminal dens in the town. They (the police) forced me to visit several places where gangs were drinking. When I repeatedly told them that I didnt know anything about these things and that I am from a respectable family, they hurled abuses at me and thrashed me.

 After a policeman told his colleagues that Pranoy may not have criminal links, the police jeep dropped him at a graveyard around 10.30 pm. I was writhing in pain. Street dogs kept barking at me and it was a horrifying experience, said the boy.

 This morning, Pranoys father, along with neighbours and RSP supporters, lodged complaints against Kotwali police with Nadia additional superintendent of police Subrata Mitra and Nadia district magistrate .S. Meena.

 Mitra said a probe had begun. I dont know how the police did this. If the allegations are true, strong action will be taken.

 A police official said that following complaints from residents that many students were involved in gambling and drinking, the police had launched a drive against such activities.

 We think the raiding party, seeing a student walking down the street alone at night, thought he might be involved. But the policemen later realised they had picked up an innocent boy. Raiding parties should be more careful, he said.

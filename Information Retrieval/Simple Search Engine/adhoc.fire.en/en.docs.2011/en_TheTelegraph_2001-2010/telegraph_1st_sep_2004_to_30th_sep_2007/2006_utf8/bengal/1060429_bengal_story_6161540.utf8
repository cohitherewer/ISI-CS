The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 BRIEFS

 Calcutta: When the citys policemen were sitting idle at poll booths yesterday, a group of boys decided to give them a job.

 Ei je, ora (the paramilitary jawans) thanda jal chaichhe (Hello, they want cold water), a boy in his early 20s told some policemen sitting on a pavement on Lenin Sarani near Taltala High School, where three booths had been set up.

 As he and his four friends came out out the school after casting of their first votes, the boy had applauded the jawans. Apnarai to sob korchhen, amader police to sudhu boshe achhe. Daran, apnader janye oder jal ante bole di (You are doing all the work. Our policemen are sitting idle. Wait, let them bring some water for you).

 Chinsurah: For residents of Tribeni, the paramilitary forces mean good business. On April 22, when polls were held in Hooghly, the jawans on duty in Tribeni ? located at the confluence of the Hooghly and the Saraswati ? flocked to shops to buy plastic bottles and jerrycans to carry home some Gangajal. Now, Tribeni is hoping the jawans keep flowing in.

 Durgapur: Desperate to wrest Nadanghat in Burdwan from the CPM, Trinamul Congresss Swapan Debnath has recruited five persons on wheelchairs to campaign for him. But the CPM feels Debnaths ploy will backfire and leave him handicapped.

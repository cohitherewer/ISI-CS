The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Glare on poll-duty truants

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 8: State government employees trying to play truant from election duty will have a tough time.

 Those who have not reported for polling personnels training so far will be traced to their offices or homes, chief electoral officer (CEO) Debashis Sen said today.

 Were launching a special drive to track down these absentees. After finding them, well organise another training session for them. Except those certified sick by doctors, no one else will be exempt from election duty, Sen added.

 District magistrates have been asked to form medical boards to examine those seeking exemption from election duty on the ground of illness or physical disability.

 About 53,000 polling personnel and presiding officers are required to man 53,000-odd booths this time. Well have to minimise absenteeism, the CEO said.

 Asked if those playing truant would be punished, Sen said they would be persuaded to join election duty.

 The CEOs office is also trying to work out a contingency plan in anticipation of a cash shortage because of the strike by State Bank of India staff.

 All treasury-linked banks in the districts are SBI branches. Were trying to link up with other banks, in case the SBI is not available till then. We need cash for the training of poll personnel, repairs and fuel for vehicles, and contingency, said Sen.

 Having realised that it will not be able to issue electoral photo identity cards to all voters, the election department has instructed district election officers to issue identification slips to those who do not get the cards. The modalities are being worked out, said an official.

 The Election Commission has dismissed allegations of bias made by the CPM against the Keshpur observer, Manmohan Singh, who ordered police raids at various places, including the partys office.

 The poll panel said it was pained to note that the facts of the case have been distorted and unfounded allegations levelled against the observer, who performed his duty correctly and in right earnest.

 It had deputed a team comprising deputy election commissioners R. Balakrishnan and Anand Kumar to inquire into the raids after the CPM lodged a complaint.

 According to the findings, observer Singh wasnt aware of the places to be raided. Those who provided the tip-off regarding hoarding of arms didnt reveal the location till the last moment as they feared the information would be leaked, said an EC official.

 Child rape penalty: Fine

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Malda, Oct. 31: The penalty for raping a seven-year-old? Rs 25,000 should be enough, felt village elders in Maldas Kaliachak. 

 But the culprit, 37-year-old Netaurh Sheikh, is not ready to pay. Threatening daily wager Salam Biswass family into submission should not be tough for a labour contractor.

 Biswas is scared to go to police because that might offend the village heads who sat in judgement. 

 And the police have better things to do than help a poor family in a remote village. 

 Malda superintendent of police Dilip Mondal conve- niently washed his hands of the Biswass plight saying: What can we do if no one lodges any complaint? 

 That the little girls parents are too scared to lodge a complaint does not cut much ice with him.

 Moitan Sheikh, Nezaul Sheikh and Mukuleswar Rahman, who delivered the verdict on Thursday, are said to be missing since. They ordered Netaurh to pay Rs 25,000 in three months and leave the village after that. 

 That Biswass daughter had been raped was apparent when she returned home crying on the night of October 25. He went to the village elders the following day to ask what he should do, They suggested the shalishi meeting. 

 Netaurh and his men are constantly threatening us. Those who delivered the verdict are also avoiding me. If I go to the police, the village leaders will be angry, Biswas said.

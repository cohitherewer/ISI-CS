The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 I-card real; Age: 257

 UTTAM DUTTA

 Serampore, Feb. 1: Krishnaram Biswas was 257 years old in 2001 and 261 in 2005. He is 109 years old now. 

 The man from Serampore can make it to the Guinness Book if its makers trust Indian voter identity cards for proof of age.

 Krishnaram, 67 years old now, received his first I-card about a decade ago. It identified him as Krishnadhan. 

 Until 2001 ? when the last Assembly elections were held ? he did not feel inclined to get his name corrected. He did not have to produce the I-card while voting in the meantime either. 

 I applied for the rectification of my name in the run-up to the 2001 polls, the retired officer of a private firm said.

 He got a new card. But this time, Krishnarams age had jumped a couple of centuries. 

 The new card spelt my name right but put my age at 257. When I went back to the subdivisional office, I was told it was a minor error and there would be no problem in casting my vote. 

 In the polling booth, Krishnaram was stunned again. His wife Banani, 45 then, was also 257 years old according to the voter list. 

 Although the cause of much amusement among officials in the booth, the couple from BP Dey Street, 50 km from Calcutta, had no problem voting.

 In January 2006, election observer for Hooghly N. Shibasailam was also amused. You two must be the oldest living voters in the world, he quipped. 

 Krishnaram was determined to have the errors rectified. When the roll revision started, he filled the necessary forms and applied for the corrections. Officials I spoke to at the SDOs office promised to rectify the errors on the voter list, Krishnaram said. 

 The voter list was rectified and both our ages were printed as 261. The system was definitely working ? Krishnaram became four years older between 2001 and 2005. 

 I did not receive any response regarding my I-card, he said.

 At a loss, Krishnaram went back to the SDOs office. They assured me again that everything will be all right. But in the draft roll, we were 109 years old.

 Additional district magistrate (general) Onkar Singh Meena said Krishnarams is an isolated case. We have initiated a probe. All necessary corrections will be made on the final electoral roll.

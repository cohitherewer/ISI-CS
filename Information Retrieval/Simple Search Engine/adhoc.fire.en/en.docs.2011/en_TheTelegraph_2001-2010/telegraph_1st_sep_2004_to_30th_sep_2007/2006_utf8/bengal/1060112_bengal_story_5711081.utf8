The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Rebels seethe at CPM salvo

 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE

 Calcutta, Jan. 11: Various Naxalite factions today criticised CPM politburo member Biman Bose for exhorting party workers in Purulia to use bullet for bullet to fight Maoist guerrillas.

 Boses comment was not a responsible one, said Asim Chatterjee, the leader of the Communist Revolutionary League of India, a former constituent of the Left Front. If anything, it would lead to a possible escalation of tension in the districts.

 Addressing a rally at Bandwan in Purulia yesterday, Bose, who is also the Left Front chairman, had urged party workers to take up arms to fight the Maoist guerrillas.

 The rally, addressed by Bose and state CPM secretary Anil Biswas, was organised to boost the morale of party workers in the wake of the December 31 incident in which local CPM leader Rabindranath Kar and his wife were burnt alive and their house torched by the Maoists.

 Make sure next time they cannot escape after an attack. You have to resist them with arms, Bose had told the gathering.

 Naxalite leader Santosh Rana also criticised Bose. It is not in conformity with the CPMs stated political line. Now the Maoists will feel emboldened to carry out more attacks, said Rana, a front-ranking leader of the Naxalites armed struggle in the seventies.

 We condemn the killing of people by the Maoists and never support their subversive activities. But armed resistance is not the answer. They have to be defeated politically, Rana said.

 Chatterjee and Rana said that in the seventies, the CPM had taken up arms to eliminate Naxalites and in the retaliation that followed, thousands had died.

 Political observers believe that Bose tried to boost the morale of the party workers, who were feeling insecure after the Maoists attack. 

 Thirty-one CPM leaders and workers have been killed by Maoists in the last five years.

 Party functionaries in the rebel-dominated areas of Belpahari, Bandwan, Ranibandh, said the Naxalites could not be tackled only with an ideological campaign and armed resistance was needed.

 Bose had realised the sentiment of the leaders while meeting the members of the Purulia district committee last week.

 The leaders had tried to convince Bose that the rebels could not be fought with empty hands.

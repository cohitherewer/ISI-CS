The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Flood toll up by five

 July 14: Five people have died since last night and the flood situation in Murshidabad has taken a turn for the worse. 

 After a days break, the rain, which started lashing Birbhum and Murshidabad on Sunday, returned.

 The chief minister said in Calcutta the situation was worrying. 

 Murshidabad district magistrate Subir Bhadra said the water level in over 150 villages had risen since last night and they can only be reached by boat. The Kandi-Behrampore road is now under at least three feet of water and the road link between the two places has snapped. A child bitten by a snake was among the dead.

 The flood toll in Birbhum and Murshidabad is now nine.

 Mamata says quit, MLAs ask why

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Aug. 9: Mamata Banerjee wants her MLAs to quit all Assembly standing committees, but they dont.

 The Trinamul Congress chief is angry at Speaker Ha- shim Abdul Halims decision to appoint Partha Chatterjee the leader of Opposition conditionally. 

 The party, according to the Speaker, has to win the Bongaon bypoll and take its tally to 30 to retain the status.

 Mamata has asked all four leaders Chatterjee, Sadhan Pande, Dinesh Bajaj and Sital Sarder who were appointed chairmen of the standing committees of finance, labour, petitions and paper laid to resign to pressure Halim to withdraw his condition. 

 But besides Chatterjee, who enjoys cabinet rank by dint of being the leader of Opposition, none of the other three appears to be sharing Mamatas anger.

 Pande said he would have quit had Chatterjee said he would also not accept the status of the leader of Opposition on condition.

 To be recognised as the principal Opposition party, Trinamul needs 10 per cent of the seats in the 294-member House. Having fallen short of the magic figure of 30 after the death of its Bongaon MLA, Trinamul had to depend on Halims discretion for the status. 

 It was decided at Sundays meeting that Chatterjee would write to the Speaker saying he would not accept the conditional status of the leader of Opposition. But so far, he has not written any such letter, said Pande, the Burtola MLA. 

 If Chatterjee agrees to accept the conditional status of the leader of Opposition, we are not going to resign as chairmen of the standing committees, he added.

 Bajaj, the MLA from Jorasanko, said it would be unfair to quit. It is the Speakers prerogative to nominate the chairmen of the standing committees. So, the party should have nothing to do with it. 

 Sarder would not say anything until the matter is discussed at the working committee meeting on Friday. 

 Chatterjee was not available for comment, but party general secretary Mukul Roy insisted that all four would resign from the House panels.

 Alipurduar, May 29: Three elephants were killed within hours of one another and a fourth was injured when they stumbled onto the path of speeding trains in forests here. 

 A bison, too, is fighting for its life. 

 The accidents have once again triggered a debate on the speed limit of trains passing through sanctuaries and wildlife reserves. 

 The state government had been expressing apprehension that the conversion of tracks from metre to broad gauge would lead to trains picking up speed.

 The issue will be taken up with the (Northeast Frontier) railway officials. A meeting with senior forest staff has been called tomorrow, said for-est minister Ananta Roy, who visited Rajabhatkhaowa in the Buxa Tiger Reserve to see the tusker killed at 8.30 last night. It was hit by the Alipurduar-bound Mahananda Express. 

 The forest officials were in for another shock this morning ? another train had injured a female elephant and killed its calf in Jalpaiguri. Around 8 am, the mother and child were hit by a passenger train. The calf was killed on the spot. 

 At the same spot, a female was killed by an inter-city express this evening. The same train had critically injured the bison at Hilla Jhora yesterday. 

 The condition of the bison is serious. The animal, still bleeding, has taken refuge among bushes along the track. 

 The track between Alipurduar and Siliguri had been converted in 2003. In 2000, World Wide Fund for Nature and Natural Resources, an NGO, had filed a PIL in Calcutta High Court objecting to the conversion on the ground that animals would be killed by speeding trains.

 Following a court order, the frontier railway had asked drivers to slow down while passing through forests, but environmentalists allege that the norm is frequently flouted.

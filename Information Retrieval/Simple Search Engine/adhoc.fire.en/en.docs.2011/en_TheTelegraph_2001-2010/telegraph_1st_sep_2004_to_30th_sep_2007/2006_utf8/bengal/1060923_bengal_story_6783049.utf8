 No puja, Subhas respects custom

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Sept. 22: Transport 

 minister Subhas Chakraborty today denied having offered 

 puja at the Tarapeeth temple last week.

 He had only observed some rituals to pay respect to traditional customs under situational compulsions.

 I told them I did not offer puja at Tarapeeth. They were satisfied. Whatever I may be by birth, I do not believe in pujas or casteism and swear by the philosophy of Marxism, the minister said after meeting CPM state secretary Biman Bose at the partys Alimuddin Street headquarters, where was summoned this morning to explain the temple trip. 

 Mentor Jyoti Basu, who said Chakraborty had lost his head after the minister equated him with Lord Krishna, was also present at the hearing. 

 Chakraborty said he was not censured or criticised, though he expressed regrets to those in the party who felt embarrassed and hurt over his visit to Tarapeeth. 

 Now that he (Chakraborty) has cleared the air, I have nothing to say, said Bose.

 I would not have made my detour to Tarapeeth while returning from Malda had I known that it would trigger such a furore, Chakraborty said. 

 Neither was the visit to Tarapeeth pre-planed nor the temple trip, the minister insisted, adding that he had gone to the Birbhum town only to inaugurate a hotel. 

 I visited the temple on the requests of some priests who gave me jaba flowers to be offered to the deity. Should I have thrown them away? I offered the flowers where others do, (at the feet of the deity).

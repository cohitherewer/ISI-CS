The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 AICC stitching deal

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Feb. 22: The Congress high command has assured the state unit that it will see to it that the party has a seat-sharing deal with Mamata Banerjee.

 Margaret Alva, the AICC general secretary in charge of Bengal, apparently conveyed this to former state party chief Somen Mitra when he called on her in Delhi last night. 

 AICC sources said Alva, who discussed seat adjustments with Mamata twice last week ? apparently under Sonia Gandhis instructions ? will arrive in Calcutta in early March to carry forward the talks with the Trinamul Congress.

 Be patient, things are taking shape fast as far as seat adjustments with Mamata are concerned, Alva reportedly told Mitra during the one-to-one.

 Alva appears confident about the seat-sharing deal with Mamata. Although the high command is against any sort of direct electoral alliance with Mamata because of her BJP links, it is not against a seat adjustment with Trinamul, Mitra told The Telegraph over the phone from Delhi.

 Mamatas one-time enemy Mitra has been lobbying for seat adjustments with Trinamul since Mamata began a move three months ago to stitch to- gether all Opposition parties to prevent a split in anti-Left votes. 

 Mamata refused to make a comment at this juncture as discussions with the AICC on seat adjustments are on. But she did say that something positive will emerge in the next few days.

 The Trinamul chief told some of her key party functionaries during the day that she was ready to give more seats to the Congress than the 57 she had granted before the 2001 Assembly elections. 

 In her bid to keep the Congress happy, it is likely that Mamata will not publish a joint election manifesto with the BJP or launch a campaign with the saffron party, a key Trinamul leader said. 

 During last months convention of her partys minority cell, Mamata had not invited any state BJP leader.

 A central BJP leader was present, though ? Shahnawaz Hussain.

 Political observers said Mamatas decision to distance herself from the BJP would endear her both to the Congress and the minority voter.

 State Congress working president Pradip Bhattacharya, who is also camping in the capital, said the pact with Trinamul will top the agenda for the state partys executive committee meeting on Saturday.

Durgapur, June 4: A girl who went to her school 

to collect her Madhyamik mark sheet yesterday morning was beaten up by a teacher 

and an official for not being in uniform.

 Kazi Kamreen Manir of Burdwan Municipal Girls School, who scored 595 out of 800 in the secondary examination, is still in shock at home, instead of celebrating her good marks.

 Her mother lodged an FIR with Burdwan police station this evening.

 Kamreen, the daughter of a small businessman living in Burdwan town, 90 km from Calcutta, was allegedly hit on her back and head with a wooden ruler and had to be taken to the local medical college and hospital for a check-up. 

 Her mother, Kazi Sayeda Afrin, today alleged that Nalini Dev Barman, a mathematics teacher and Debabrata Karmakar, a clerk, beat her daughter when she entered the school office yesterday. 

 When my daughter pleaded that she did not wear the school uniform because she would not attend her classes, they became even more furious and abused her?. Not wearing the uniform on result day can be no reason for assaulting a girl.

 Headmistress Swapna Sinha did not entirely deny that Kamreen was beaten up. The girl was not beaten up to the extent her mother is saying. She did not wear the school uniform, which we considered a violation of school rules.

 Police said they had registered a case against Barman and Karmakar. We are pro-bing the incident. We have already contacted the school authorities and sought their explanation, said Burdwan superintendent of police Peeyush Pandey.

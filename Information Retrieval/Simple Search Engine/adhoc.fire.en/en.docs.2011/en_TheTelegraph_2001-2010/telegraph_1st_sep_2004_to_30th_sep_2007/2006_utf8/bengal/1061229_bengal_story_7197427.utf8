 Calcutta, Dec. 28: As Mamata Banerjees health deteriorated, the Trinamul Congress today set up a seven-member medical team to monitor the condition of its fasting chief round the clock.

 She is suffering from profound weakness and is almost unable to speak, said Sudarshan Ghosh Dastidar, a member of the panel.

 Suffering from respiratory distress, Mamata has been on oxygen support since December 26. Her blood pressure is very low and that is a major concern for us, said one of the doctors.

 Mamatas blood pressure is fluctuating between 90/55 and 96/60, which, the doctors said, is quite low. During the day, she also complained of chest and abdominal pain. 

 These are quite common syndromes for a person who is on fast for the last 25 days, said a member of the medical team.

 The results of the blood tests, done yesterday, have shown that her liver has also been affected. 

 In the evening, a chest specialist and a cardiologist examined her. The problem is, she is refusing any kind of treatment, a doctor said.

 The doctors, however, said they were keeping a close watch on her health and would shift her to a hospital if there was any threat to her life.

 The armys Eastern Command has kept a medical team on standby at the command hospital here, following Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs directive yesterday to central authorities to extend whatever medical help Mamata requires. 

 If the doctors treating her or she herself requests for an admission, it will be done immediately. A medical team is on standby, said an army spokesperson.

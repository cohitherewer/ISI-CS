 Calcutta, Aug. 20: Floods in faraway Gujarat have put dairies in Bengal in a spot.

 Supply of skimmed milk powder, a key ingredient in packaged milk, from the rain- ravaged state has been reduced to a trickle and prices are soaring.

 Milk procurement has been affected in large parts of Gujarat because of the floods. This is going to have an adverse impact on the dairy industry here as we are heavily dependent on skimmed milk powder from there, said S.K. Chanda, the chief general manager of Mother Dairy Calcutta. 

 Skimmed milk powder is prepared from surplus milk. 

 A litre of packaged milk comprises 45 to 50 grams of the powder. Besides, the sweetmeat industry in the state is also dependent on powdered milk. 

 Bengal being a milk-scarce state, dairies here source their skimmed milk powder from northern and western India. 

 Normally, the price of the milk powder varies between Rs 70 and 80 a kg, but it is selling at Rs 110-120 for the past few months. 

 The prices start easing from September, but that will not happen this time. The supply will shrink because of the rain. Besides, demand will also increase as we are approaching the festival season. So the milk powder price is bound to rise and our costs will go up further, said Chanda. 

 He admitted that Mother Dairy has been suffering losses for the past few months, unable to cope with the spiralling costs. 

 Sumit Deb, managing director, Metro Dairy, said the price rise is man-made. 

 Mother Dairy Delhis decision to buy skimmed milk powder from the market at a premium, the high price realisation from export of Cassien, a milk product, and last years cyclone in Tamil Nadu are the real reasons behind the rise, he said.

 Calcutta consumes around 20 lakh litres of milk everyday. With a 20 per cent market share, the government-run Mother Dairy dictates the price of milk. 

 Animal resources development minister Anisur Rahaman said: It is true that costs are on the rise and the flood situation in Gujarat will have an impact, but we are yet to take a call on a price hike. The government is monitoring the situation. 

 The government recently allowed a 50 paisa per litre rise in Mother Dairy products. So, the wait and watch before another hike.

 With the government not keen on the price rise, the private dairies are preparing for the worst. 

 If the losses keep mounting, we will have to cut down on production to minimise losses, said the owner of a farm that supplies milk to Mother Dairy.

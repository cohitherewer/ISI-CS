 After results, rush for admission

struggle against student surge

 Problem of plenty: Jubilant Madhyamik students 

after their results 

 Calcutta, June 3: Barely 24 hours have passed since the Madhyamik results were out. But the students have no time to savour their success or fret over failure.

 A rush has begun to find a place in a school that offers higher secondary courses. 

 The schools, too, are feeling the pressure, with a large number of high-scoring students flooding them for admission.

 This morning, students with their guardians in tow queued up outside schools like South Point, Path Bhavan, St Lawrence, Gokhale Memorial for Girls, Vidya Bharati Girls, Hindu and Hare. The long wait proved futile for many of them.

 I tried to buy an admission form for my son in the science stream from at least four schools. But all the four institutions refused to give a form, Esha Mukherjee, the mother of a South Point School student who has scored 82 per cent marks, said.

 South Point has decided to give admission forms to students, both internal and external, in the science stream if they have scored 700 or above in Madhyamik, which is approximately 87 per cent.

 Mukherjee had to return empty-handed from Nava Nalanda, St Lawrence, Jodhpur Boys and Patha Bhavan. Finally, after much persuasion, she managed to get a form from South Point. The school made a concession for her son as he had scored 80 per cent marks in math and science.

 There is a major rush for seats among admission-seekers this time. But we are helpless, Jayati Solomon, the principal of South Point School, said.

 We have a total of 500 seats in our Plus II section. All our students who had appeared in Madhyamik have scored extremely high marks, particularly in mathematics and science. We have to accommodate all the high-scorers of our own school first. It is this factor that is forcing us to turn away many good students, she said.

 Like Mukherjee, Anwesha Mitra spent the day running from one school to another to get a form for her daughter who passed from Gokhale Memorial. Her task was tougher as her daughter has scored 75 per cent and wants to study science. 

 We are sorry that we had to refuse forms to many very high-scoring students who approached us all through the day, said Sharmistha Banerjee, principal, Vidya Bharati School. It is impossible for us to give an admission form to a child who has scored less than 700 because the highest score of our school is 765, and many of our own students have scored above 700. 

 The school has only 160 seats in Plus II ? not enough to accommodate even its 289 examinees this year.

 Some school authorities said the shrinking number of good HS schools has also resulted in the seat scramble.

 Over the past few years, the city has seen at least 100 new private English-medium schools that offer Plus II courses, but most of them are affiliated to either the Indian School Certificate council or the Central Board of Secondary Education.

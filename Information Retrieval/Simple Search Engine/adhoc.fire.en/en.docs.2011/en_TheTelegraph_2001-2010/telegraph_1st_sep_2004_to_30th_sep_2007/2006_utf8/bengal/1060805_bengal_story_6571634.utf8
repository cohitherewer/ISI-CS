The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 At climbers door to solve trek puzzle

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 4: The CID will take the help of mountaineering and hiking experts to clear confusions that still surround the deaths of three Jadavpur University students who were part of a team of five that went trekking to Purulia.

 The father of one of the victims, Sanyasi Charan Das, today submitted a letter to the Belgharia police station, under which falls his house at Ariadaha, Dakshineswar, seeking a probe into his daughter Swatis death.

 Swati, Arundhati Ghosh and Subhankar Saha died after being swept away by a flash flood in the Sobha at the foothills of the Ayodhya Hills on July 28. Two other JU students, Bappaditya Chatterjee and Kaushik Sarkhel, survived.

 Sanyasi Charan wrote that several versions of one incident have emerged. I request the police to find how exactly the incident happened. 

 Arundhatis relatives had earlier made a similar appeal to the police.

 Rajeev Kumar, a CID deputy inspector-general of police, said there remain a few unanswered questions, which came to light during the interrogation of Bappaditya and Kaushik. We will engage mountaineering and hiking experts to clear the confusions.

 The main point that has created a major confusion is the way the womens bodies were found. Why did they not have any clothes on? We will want to know from mountaineering experts and geo-morphologists the character of flash floods and their after-effects, Kumar added. 

 Bappaditya and his MPharma classmate Soumya Kanti Roy were questioned at the CIDs Bhavani Bhavan headquarters today. Soumya, who was in Calcutta, had received the first call from his friend after the incident.

 The other survivor, Kaushik, could not be questioned as he has been admitted to Baghajatin State General Hospital.

 A team led by special superintendent Sanjay Singh, which went to Purulia, left for Calcutta today after recovering Swatis yellow top from the banks of the Sobha.

 We cross-checked the statements made by Bappaditya. There was no contradiction in what he and Soumya told us, said Kumar.

 Nothing suspicious has come out from Bappaditya and Soumyas call statements. It shows that Bappaditya had contacted Soumya at the time that he had mentioned in his statement, an investigating officer said.

 CID officers said doctors at SSKM Hospital will examine Bappadityas injury marks tomorrow. We will verify whether the bruise marks were self-inflicted.

 Sept. 25: The flood toll rose to 52 today with five more deaths reported in Murshidabad.

 The situation in the district, over 200 km from Calcutta, has worsened as the road connecting Behrampore town and Kandi has gone under several feet of water. The Bhagirathi is flowing above danger level. 

 Ananda Mondal, 32, and Biswanath Bagdi, 40, were swept away at Jajan village in Bharatpur. At nearby Sukdanpur, Paru Majhi, 47, drowned. At Harinagar, 12-year-old Sumitra Biswas died following a snakebite. 

 Another body could not be identified. 

 The situation in Howrahs Udaynarayanpur has also turned worse, finance minister Asim Dasgupta said in Calcutta. The chief minister has asked Dasgupta to visit the place, about 60 km from the city, where about 400,000 people have been affected.

 Mamata no-show at NDA meet

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Nov. 18: Mamata Banerjee will not attend an NDA meeting which has been convened at former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayees residence in New Delhi on November 20.

 Trinamul sources said BJP national president Rajnath Singh today made a phone call to Mamata requesting her to attend the meeting, which has been arranged to discuss the NDAs strategy for the winter session of Parliament from November 22.

 But Mamata has declined the invitation on health grounds. She is suffering pain in the waist, said a key Trinamul functionary.

 Mamata said she had been informed about the NDA meeting but was yet to decide on attending it.

 State BJP chief

 Sukumar Banerjee was today elected unopposed as state BJP president. He replaces Tathagata Roy.

 Siliguri, Aug. 27: An eye in the sky will map tea estates. 

 In a bid to develop a centralised network of the brew belts in India and create a comprehensive database of the es-tates, the Tea Board of India has decided to have satellite imaging of plantations across the country. 

 The idea is to have a detailed database of every tea estate in our country, G. Boriah, director (tea development) told The Telegraph. 

 Scanning the images, the board will know the climatic condition and groundwater level at every garden and, accordingly, help everyone involved in the industry.

 The project, to be taken up by the Bangalore-based Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro), will be funded by money released from the 11th Five-Year Plan, which will come into effect in April 2007. 

 Boriah said once the satellite imaging is over, village resource centres would be set up in the tea belt. Once the centres are set up, those attached to the smaller gardens can also get expert advice through a centralised server, he said.

 The resource centres, Boriah explained, will also help the growers as crucial information on production, price of tea at various auction centres, quantum of sale and import and export will be available online.

 A tea industry source said the board was keen on diversification. Boriah confirmed it. We want planters to earn more from alternative sources, he said. 

 We have already had meetings with officials of the rubber and spices boards and the horticulture department. They have promised tailor-made schemes for the plantations after inspecting them.

 Planters sounded happy with the apex bodys initiative. Were glad that the board is planning to use information technology and scientific techniques to overhaul the industry, said Bijoygopal Chakrobarty, the convener of the United Forum of Small Tea Growers Association. Diversification will help small growers the most as they depend solely on the sale of tealeaves.

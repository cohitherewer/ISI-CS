 Confirmed: Women better leaders

 Disciplined voters, they also make 

 more reliable leaders

 New Delhi, Dec. 13: Women make better leaders than men, the Unicef has found.

 A report authored by the United Nations Childrens Fund reveals that around the world, greater participation of women in local politics has led to a more equitable distribution of community resources with direct benefits for women and children, particularly girls.

 Making a strong case for gender-based reservation, it cites the example of Bengal where gender quotas have worked to the advantage of local communities. 

 In villages with reservation policies, investment in drinking water facilities was double that of villages without quotas (reserved seats for women). The roads were almost twice as likely to be in good condition, the Unicef says, quoting from the results of a research project covering 165 village councils of Bengal.

 Research by the Poverty Action Lab of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) backs the Unicef conclusion.

 The Unicef says that the most comprehensive findings on the impact of women in local government come from developing countries, particularly India where a third of all leadership positions in panchayats are reserved for women.

 Major roads were 20 per cent more likely to have been repaired in villages with reservation, it says. 

 New biogas (a substitute for cooking fuel and electricity) projects were introduced in 26 per cent of villages with reservation policies (compared to 6 per cent in the villages without quotas).

 Women panchayat leaders also pay more attention to health care. The number of visits paid by health workers in the six months covered by the research project was significantly higher because of active monitoring by women panchayat leaders.

 A survey covering 100 villages in Rajasthan collected information on the immunisation record of every child between the age of one and five living in a village reserved for a woman pradhan. The findings showed that the reserved villages have a far better probability of completing their immunisation cycle. 

 The impact of women leaders on school attendance is even more significant, the Unicef says. The study showed the presence of a woman pradhan reduces the gender gap in school attendance by 13 percentage points.

 The Unicefs strong advocacy for gender reservation comes when the government is dragging its feet on the bill to reserve 33 per cent seats for women in Parliament and Assemblies. 

 The report also punches holes in the argument often put forward by male MPs against reservation that women leaders cannot exercise an independent choice, and that they are puppets in the hands of the men in their family who prop them up.

 Bengal seals animal farm deal

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 22: The Bengal government today formally handed over 500 acres in West Midnapores Salboni farm to a Delhi-based company for an animal breeding farm and a meat processing unit.

 The project is expected to generate employment for around 1,000 farmers initially. The number is expected to go up to 5,000 over the next five years. 

 During its first year of operation, the company ? Hind Agro Industries Limited ? will rear 5,000 buffaloes and 10,000 black Bengal goats. 

 We will allot five goats and two buffaloes to each of the 1,000 families in the first year. We will also give them feed supplements, medicines and training on rearing, said S.K. Ranjhan, the director of Hind Agro Industries Limited.

 Company head Shirazuddin Qureshi said a tannery unit was also being planned at the site. 

 The companys annual turnover from meat export is around Rs 500 crore, he added. 

 Were handing over 500 acres now. Later on, well allot another 500 acres for their expansion plans, which include a milk-processing dairy, a feed-manufacturing unit and a leather-processing unit. The government cannot run these centres by itself, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said. 

 The government has leased out the 500-acre land for 99 years at Rs 5 crore.

 According to officials, the Salboni farm was closed for sometime as the government was unable to run it.

 The project will increase farmers income and improve the quality of their lives, Bhattacharjee said.

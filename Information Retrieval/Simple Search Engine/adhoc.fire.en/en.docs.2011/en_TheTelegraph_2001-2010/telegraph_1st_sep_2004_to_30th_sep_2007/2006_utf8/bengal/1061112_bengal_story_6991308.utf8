The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Sonia letter to Mamata

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Nov. 11: Mamata Banerjee today claimed that Sonia Gandhi has asked her to plan joint programmes with the Congress on issues of common interest.

 I have received a letter from Soniaji on drawing up a joint movement on common issues like land acquisition in Singur for the Tata project, the blood kit racket and crib deaths at BC Roy Memorial Childrens Hospital, Mamata said tonight.

 The Trinamul Congress chief, who has refused to part ways with the BJP despite the Congresss repeated requests, said: The time has come to stitch together the Opposition forces in Bengal. 

 Congress sources said Margaret Alva, the party general secretary in charge of Bengal who is scheduled to address a public meeting in Malda this month, is likely to call on Mamata. 

 Contacted in Delhi, Alva merely said: I can tell you that things are moving in the right direction. 

 The Congress is backing the Trinamul candidate for the December 4 bypoll to the Islampur Assembly constituency.

 Mamata today named her man for the seat, Abdul Karim Chowdhury, and said: Karimda is a formidable candidate. He will sail through.

 Fat too fast? Beware of ovary cysts 

 SANJAY MANDAL

 Calcutta, April 1: Losing flab through a strict fitness regimen and regaining it in no time could be more than a lifestyle problem for a woman.

 Polycystic ovarian syndrome is now common in an increasing number of city women suffering from obesity, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, heart diseases, diabetes or infertility. 

 Doctors said the existence of multiple small cysts in the ovary is essentially a genetic problem, causing imbalance in certain enzymes. It leads to an insulin-resistant state that affects all internal systems. But lifestyle factors like junk food, lack of exercise and stress aggravate the situation. 

 In the 15 to 30 age group, the doctors said, every fourth woman in the city suffers from problems that have their roots in the syndrome. 

 If not detected early, it might cause infertility and even uterine cancer at a later stage, said Rajiv Agarwal, a fertility expert with Care IVF clinic. 

 Those suffering from the syndrome also have associated thyroid problems. Although there are a number of symptoms, the most common manifestations are irregular menstrual cycles and obesity, Agarwal said. Women also tend to grow facial hair and develop acne and other skin problems.

 Characteristically, weight is difficult to shed and even after the pa tient loses flab through exercise, it comes back quickly. Nearly 75 per cent of the women suffering from the syndrome are obese. 

 However, a small percentage of these patients is thin. But they have other complications, said Basab Mukherjee, a gynaecologist attached to Calcutta Medical Research Institute.

 Women suffering from the syndrome have a high chance of miscarriage, heart attack and diabetes-related problems, Mukherjee said.

 Doctors said at least half the women who have fertility problems suffer from the polycystic ovarian syndrome. 

 Early detection of the problem, however, can save later complica- tions. The manifestations of the syndrome are clear in the adolescent years. There is a lack of awareness about the disease, so women tend to ignore the symptoms, a doctor said. 

 Regular exercises and proper balanced diet is a must for patients. They also must undergo regular medical check-ups.

 According to doctors, there are new methods of treatment besides surgery, which are proving to be effective. A particular anti-diabetic drug, working as an insulin sensitiser, has shown excellent results.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Loan payback time? Bank on women

 IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI

 Calcutta, May 9: When it comes to repaying loans, the ladies are giving the men a run for their money.

 The West Bengal Minority Development and Financial Corporation (WBMDFC), which provides soft loans to unemployed men and women belonging to minority communities, has seen its women beneficiaries diligently paying back loans, but the men dont seem to be in much of a hurry.

 So far, there has not been a single defaulter among women. On the contrary, the percentage of defaulters among men is growing, which is a matter of concern, said Syed Nasiruddin, the corporations managing director.

 That only 15 per cent of the total beneficiaries are women makes matters worse.

 The corporation disburses loans throughout the year to men and women whose annual family income does not exceed Rs 40,000 in rural areas and Rs 55,000 in urban areas. Once the loan is sanctioned, the beneficiary is given post-dated cheques to repay the loan in 20 quarterly instalments in five years.

 Since its inception in 1996, the corporation has seen a whopping increase in the number of loan-seekers. From 684 in 1996-1997, the number has swelled to 7,705 in 2004-2005.

 Unlike men, women are sincere in repaying loans. It speaks volumes of the dedication and commitment among women beneficiaries, said MP Mohammed Selim, who is the chairman of corporation.

 Selim pointed out how important recovery of loans is to keep the organisation going. The corporation also provides interest-free loans to poor students pursuing higher studies like MBA, MBBS, MCA, etc. 

 Keeping this in mind, the number of recovery agents has been increased for monitoring beneficiaries and legal action is being taken against defaulters. We have also launched awareness campaigns in the city as well as in the districts, persuading beneficiaries to repay loans according to the given terms and conditions, the MP said.

 In their success stories, the women have given the corporation another reason to smile. 

 Parvin Khanam, a resident of Ekbalpore, took a loan of Rs 85,000 and set up a beauty parlour. Not only did she repay the loan in time but also expanded her business. She is the proud owner of a public phone booth now.

 I wanted to do something to improve the condition of my family. It was in 1998 when I saw an advertisement in a newspaper and got to know about WBMDFC. Soon after getting the loan, I opened a beauty parlour and now it is a hit in the area. Now, I am successful and my family is very happy, says Parvin, who also teaches a beauticians course to slum girls for free.

 Like Parvin, hundreds of other women are running wool-knitting, doll-making and tailoring businesses, encouraging the corporation to reach out to remote villages. We have decided to visit the districts and create awareness, especially among women, about our schemes, said Nasiruddin. 

 Several enterprising men, too, are reaping the fruits of the loans. Only if they had been so enterprising when it was time to pay back.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 CPM jumps on to band wagon

 SANJAY MANDAL

 Calcutta, April 14: Forget 

 poll rallies where politicians rattle off pledges, they 

 are passe. Its time for some techno. 

 If you are wondering what the young man on the street-corner dais rapped in red is up to, with a guitar slung from his shoulders and ears cocked to the drummer warming up, hold your breath and dont feel let down ? it is another CPM campaign meeting.

 To make its way to young ears, the party is using the rage called Bangla band. Artistes from various groups have come together to form Swapno (Dream). 

 And with the curb on use of microphones gone after the HS exams, it had its first show at Sankrail in Howrah this evening. 

 From golden oldies like Sohag chand badani dhoni and Dariyay ailo toofan to Phirey ashchhi, phirey ashbo (were coming, well come back), the repertoire was varied, but the message single. 

 Swapno has been formed specifically for election campaign? we are all Left supporters, said Sunita Sengupta, one of the vocalists. 

 The gang with guitars, keyboards, octopads and sundry other instruments has also composed some of the songs. 

 Dhan Kuda Kud/Desh Jude Mon Mohini Sur, for example, has been written against the Manmohan Singh governments financial policies. The disunity in Opposition ranks will find mention in the parodies of old hits.

 Ours is a fusion of rock and traditional music and we are keen to impress voters, Sunita said.

 The CPM student wing, Students Federation of India, first hit upon the idea. When conventional campaign strategies like graffiti and banners have been vetoed, the senior leaders took no time to pick up the students brainwave.

 The band will perform in Calcutta, Howrah and North and South 24-Parganas till April 25. We are planning around 30 performances, said Sudip Sengupta, the SFI state president. 

 At Sankrail, about 25 km from the city, the group sung for CPM candidate Anirban Hazra, also a Howrah district committee member of the SFI. 

 He is the only candidate from the SFI ranks in the four districts and so we planned the first performance there, said Sengupta.

 Swapno will perform at chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees constituency Jadavpur, Subhas Chakrabortys seat Belgachhia East, Rabin Debs Ballygunge and RSP leader Kshiti Goswamis Dhakuria. The schedule is packed ? if it is Tollygunge tomorrow, Bhatpara in North 24-Parganas figures the day after.

 In the last Lok Sabha elections, we found tremendous response from the young voters by launching a band ? Feel Bad, an SFI leader said. 

 Feel Bad (the name ridiculing the NDA governments feel good campaign) had performed in 30 shows in and around Calcutta.

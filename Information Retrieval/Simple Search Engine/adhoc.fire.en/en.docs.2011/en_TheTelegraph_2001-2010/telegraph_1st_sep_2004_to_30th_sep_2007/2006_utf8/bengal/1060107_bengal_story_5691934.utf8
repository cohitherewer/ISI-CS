 CPM brass against Mamata arrest

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Jan. 6: Mamata Banerjee will not be arrested, Jyoti Basu has made it clear.

 We dont want Mamata to be arrested before the Assembly elections, the veteran CPM leader told The Telegraph tonight.

 Barasat chief judicial magistrate Siddhartha Roy Chowdhury had asked police to ensure the presence of Mamata and seven others before him by tomorrow in connection with an over-a-decade-old rioting case.

 Gobinda Banerjee, a Youth Congress worker, was killed in police firing on February 22, 1994, after Mamata allegedly incited a mob while leading a delegation to the North 24-Parganas district magistrates office. She was the state Youth Congress president then.

 Court sources said if Mamata does not turn up tomorrow, it might fix another date for the hearing. 

 In the morning, Basu told reporters at the CPMs Alimuddin Street headquarters that the government has not asked the police to pick up the Trinamul Congress chief.

 This is a court matter and the government has nothing to do with it, he said, adding that the police might be hauled up for contempt of court for not executing the arrest order. But we cannot help if the police face flak from the court.

 Basu attended a meeting of the state CPM secretariat where Mamatas arrest was discussed in the presence of chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. 

 It is learnt that Bhattacharjee, too, opposed the arrest at the meeting.

 Mamata has been charged with rioting, attempt to murder and damaging public property.

 The CPMs discomfiture over the arrest-Mamata order was evident when the partys state secretary, Anil Biswas, tried to skirt the issue. Its a matter that the court and the police will decide and we have no authority to comment, he said. 

 Biswas, however, described the Trinamul leader as a small fry and added that the government would not soil its hands by arresting her at this juncture. 

 With the decision to let Mamata roam free, the CPM avoided giving the Trinamul leader an issue to whip up support before the elections. 

 Mamatas arrest would have not only triggered Trinamul protests but also prompted the Congress rank and file to rally behind her, a CPM functionary of the Calcutta district committee said.

 The arrest, he added, would have also influenced the Congresss decision to tie up with her before the elections.

 Although Mamata will return to Calcutta from Cooch Behar tomorrow morning, she told a rally there: The question of my being present in the court does not arise because I have got no official intimation from anyone 

 The court order, she added, was a CPM attempt to malign me.

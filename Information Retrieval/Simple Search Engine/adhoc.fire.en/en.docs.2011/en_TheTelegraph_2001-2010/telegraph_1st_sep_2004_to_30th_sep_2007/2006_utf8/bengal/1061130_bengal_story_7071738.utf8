 Newborn dies after a night in police station

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, 

 Nov. 29: A four-day-old girl died outside a police 

 station in Howrah after her mother was made to wait there 

 through the chilly November night. 

 The girl was born to the unwed, 22-year-old mother following a relationship with Sanatan Mudi, a married man with two children, in whose house she worked as a help. 

 Sanatan is a Group-D employee of a nationalised bank in Garia. 

 Malati Giri, the womans mother, had lodged a complaint with Jagachha police station against Sanatan yesterday, accusing him of promising marriage to become intimate. Sanatan was arrested. 

 An officer said Sanatan had taken the pregnant woman to a nursing home in Bankra from where the police brought her to the station around 11 last night. 

 The baby started feeling ill early in the morning and sensing trouble, the police took the mother and daughter to the Howrah district hospital, where the child was declared brought dead.

 District superintendent of police Niraj Singh today ordered additional superintendent (town) Milan Kanti Das to probe the incident.

 Prima facie, I found negligence on the part of the investigating officer. So, I asked the additional SP to inquire into the matter and submit a report, Singh said. 

 Das said he is looking into why the mother and child were kept in the police station through the night. 

 Malati, who was with her daughter at the police station, said the police did not arrange for the babys treatment despite her repeated appeals. I requested them repeatedly that my daughter and grandchild were unwell but they didnt let us go, she alleged.

 As soon as the news of the death spread, about 200 people gathered in front of the police station and demonstrated, demanding action against the policemen responsible. 

 Senior officers persuaded the mob to calm down. 

 We simply dont understand why the police had to drag the woman to the police station from the nursing home. She is mentally challenged and now she will have to cope with the shock of her babys death, said Sanjay Sarkar, a neighbour.

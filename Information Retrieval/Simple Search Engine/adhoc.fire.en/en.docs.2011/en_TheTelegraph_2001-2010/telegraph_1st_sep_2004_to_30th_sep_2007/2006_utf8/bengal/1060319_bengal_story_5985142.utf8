 Calcutta, March 18: After a night of violence, cries of injustice rent the air at National Medical College and Hospital.

 Junior doctors, protesting against an alleged assault on a colleague by relatives of a dead patient, have gone on an indefinite ceasework since last night.

 The doctors also accused police of beating them up. 

 Nearly 200 interns and house staff went off duty, demanding adequate security on the hospital premises, action against the errant police personnel and the arrest of the relatives who allegedly assaulted the doctor.

 Indoor treatment was not affected today, but there were long queues at the outpatients department, where some people were refused admission, hospital sources said. 

 The hospital turned into a battlefield last night after Aniruddha Basu, a junior doctor, was allegedly beaten up by relatives of Humayun Rashid, 45, who was admitted in the afternoon with a heart problem and died a few hours later. 

 Basu is in hospital with head and eye injuries. 

 We have filed an FIR against the attack. A copy has been sent to the commissioner of police, said a senior official of the hospital. 

 The hospital authorities today held a meeting with officers of the state health department, who have promised to take steps by Wednesday, an official said. 

 However, the agitating doctors said they would continue the ceasework till the authorities take concrete steps. 

 This is the fifth incident in the last few months when our doctors have been attacked by outsiders. There is absolutely no security for us, said junior doctor Rahul Bhowmick.

 There was little chance of his (Rashids) survival, added his colleague Tirthankar Guha Thakurta. 

 At the medicine ward of the Raja Rammohan Block, Aniruddha was trying to save the patient by giving chest compression. But his relatives accused him of negligence and beat him up, he said.

 Basu hurt again

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Nov. 14: Jyoti Basu again injured himself last night after a fall at his Salt Lake house while going to the toilet.

 In August, the 93-year-old CPM patriarch had hurt his hip and elbow as he tripped while trying to switch off his bedroom fan.

 This time, Basu has suffered minor injuries but has pain in his hip, said Joykrishna Ghosh, his personal attendant.

 The superintendent of the Bidhannagar State General Hospital, Somnath Bhattacharya, and an orthopaedic were called to Indira Bhavan this morning as Basu continued to be in pain. They advised him complete rest. 

 Later in the day, Basus personal physician A.K. Maity attended to him.

 An X-ray will be conducted tomorrow to check if he has injuries in the hip, Ghosh said, adding: All his engagements have been cancelled for the time being. 

 A source at Basus house said he fell close to his bed around 2.30 am today. He got up on his own and went back to bed.

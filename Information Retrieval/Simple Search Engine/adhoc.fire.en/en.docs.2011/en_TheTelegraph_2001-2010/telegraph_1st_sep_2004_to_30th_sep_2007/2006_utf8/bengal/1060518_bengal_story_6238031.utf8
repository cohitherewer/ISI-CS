The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Mamata vows to march alone

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Calcutta, May 17: Smarting from her partys 

disastrous performance in the Assembly polls, Mamata Banerjee is singing a different 

tune.

 The Trinamul chief, whose mahajot mantra went largely unheeded, is now humming Ekla Cholo Re (Go it alone). And that means she also wants to keep the BJP ? her ally at the Centre ? at bay in Bengal.

 We have decided to carry out a state-wide sustained agitation independently to expose the CPM, which has unleashed terror on our party workers and supporters across Bengal in the wake of the Assembly polls, Mamata said this afternoon.

 She clarified that the BJPs Bengal unit is not party to her present movement since my party workers and supporters are solely being targeted in places where (my) party candidates have won.

 Trinamul workers will stage a dharna at Esplanade tomorrow while chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and his cabinet colleagues are being sworn in at Raj Bhavan. 

 We will step up the movement across the state if atrocities are not stopped on my party men within the next 48 hours, she warned.

 On the BJP, she said it is an altogether different party with a different political ideology. And we have nothing to do with it. 

 Other Trinamul leaders, too, hummed along with their leader. 

 The BJP, which also drew a blank in the 2001 elections, is a liability rather than an asset for us. So it is high time that we sever ties with the party for the panchayat polls in 2008, said a key party functionary. 

 Sultan Ahmed, who was defeated in Bowbazar and stayed away from todays session, said we lost a huge chunk of Muslim votes owing to our association with the BJP.

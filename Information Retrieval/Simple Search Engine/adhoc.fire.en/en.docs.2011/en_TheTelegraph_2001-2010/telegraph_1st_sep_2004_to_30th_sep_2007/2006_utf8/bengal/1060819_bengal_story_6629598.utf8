Calcutta, Aug. 18: Jolted by the drought-like situation in north Bengal, the government today announced a relief package of Rs 47 crore for farmers.

 The six north Bengal districts have received 81 per cent less rainfall this year than they need. Only 60 per cent of the targeted sowing could be completed. Of this, 24 per cent of the crops have already been damaged, finance minister Asim Dasgupta said today. He was speaking after chairing a meeting with agriculture minister Naren De, water resources minister Nandagopal Bhattacharya and minister of state for panchayat and rural development Bankim Ghosh.

 Of the targeted 9,21,000 hectares, sowing could be carried out on only 5,69,000 hectares, Dasgupta said. 

 The shortfall in rains for the entire region is 33 per cent less compared with last year. 

 In the Rs 47-crore package, Rs 32 crore will be spent on irrigation and Rs 15 crore on fertilisers and seeds to be provided at subsidised rates to farmers. 

 It was also decided at the meeting that the state government would request the Reserve Bank to go soft on repayment of agricultural loans.

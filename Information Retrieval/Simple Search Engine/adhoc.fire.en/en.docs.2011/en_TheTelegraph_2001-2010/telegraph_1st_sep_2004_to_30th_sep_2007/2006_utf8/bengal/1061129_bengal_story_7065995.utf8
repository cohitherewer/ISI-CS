The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Land map SOS to govt

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Nov. 28: The Assembly standing committee on industry has called for immediate drawing of a land-use map to make investors aware of the nature of plots available.

 The committee tabled its report on special economic zones (SEZs) in the Assembly today. 

 The chairman of the committee, Congresss Sudip Bandopadhyay, said: The report is based on our visit to Haldia and Nandigram, where special economic zones are set to come up. We have mentioned in the report that the government will face problems while acquiring land for SEZs if the map is not drawn up at the earliest. I hope the government heeds our proposals.

 Over 22,000 acres in East Midnapore are to be handed over to the Indonesia-based Salim Group. But theres little knowledge about the exact nature of land there, Bandopadhyay said. 

 The report says: Contiguous land measuring even 1,000 acres is not available in most districts, except Bankura and Purulia. The land-use map is the only way to speed up industrialisation and it should be prepared on an urgent basis. Mono-crop, multi-crop, fallow and forest land should be clearly demarcated on the map.

 The Oppositions queries on farmland acquisition for industry are also a result of this lack of details, Bandopadhyay suggested. 

 The industries and land and land reforms departments are drawing up separate land-use maps. Industries minister Nirupam Sen had said it would be drawn on the basis of census figures, while land minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah said satellite images would be used.

 Party opposed to crisis report

 Mollah will table a report on land use in the Assembly tomorrow. It says the states land resources are dwindling. 

 But his party said there is no need to announce the dearth of land as it would only scare away investors and boost Opposition protests against acquisition. It is well known that we have only 16 decimals per head. But those who are making a hue and cry over acquisition on the pretext of land crisis are advocating stagnation and backwardness, CPM state secretariat member Benoy Konar told The Telegraph.

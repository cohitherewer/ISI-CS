 CPM gears up to foil bandh

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, Oct. 5: CPM state secretary Biman Bose today called upon the partys rank and file to hit the streets to foil the October 9 bandh called by the Trinamul Congress against the Singur land acquisition.

 Even though Bose did not urge party workers to confront bandh supporters, he asked them to hit the streets to collect donations for flood-victims on the day of the bandh. Some district committees have decided to go for a donation drive on Sunday and Monday. We are asking other districts to join.

 Calling the bandh politically motivated and designed to disrupt the state governments drive for industrialisation, Bose said the Left Front would launch a campaign highlighting the Trinamuls insensitivity to the plight of the flood-hit people and towards Muslims who fast during Ramazan.

 Home secretary Prasad Ranjan Ray said measures are being taken to ensure normal life, particularly in the IT sector.

 Transport minister Subhas Chakraborty said public transport would ply as usual.

 Criticising the bandh call, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said: They (Trinamul) do not understand the sentiments of the common people.

 The Congress, SUCI and some Naxalite outfits will support the 12-hour bandh.

 Congress leader Subrata Mukherjee held a public meeting in south Calcutta in support of the bandh. We are not going to backtrack on Singur. We will participate in the bandh. On Tuesday, we will march to Tata Centre, he said.

 A notice was issued today extending to October 17 the deadline for farmers in Singur to submit the consent form for selling their land voluntarily. In all, 400 farmers have received compensation till today.

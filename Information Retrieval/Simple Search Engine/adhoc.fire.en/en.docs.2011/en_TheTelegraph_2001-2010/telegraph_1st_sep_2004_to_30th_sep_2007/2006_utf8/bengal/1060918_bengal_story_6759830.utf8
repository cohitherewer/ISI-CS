 Militants on fast

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Siliguri, Sept. 17: Thirty- four suspected KLO militants lodged in Jalpaiguri Central Jail will go on an indefinite hunger strike from tomorrow in support of their 19 comrades who have been fasting for the past 13 days. 

 The 19 12 said to be KLO militants, six suspected Maoists and an alleged Ulfa member who have been in jail custody for three years started their fast on September 5 demanding speedy trial and bail. 

 They were shifted to the North Bengal Medical College Hospital on the fourth day of the hunger strike and have since been on saline drip and medicines. 

 Members of the Rajnaitik Bandi Mukti Committee, an apolitical organisation fighting for the rights of political prisoners, said unless the authorities concede the demands by Thursday, the jail inmates relatives would also start a similar agitation.

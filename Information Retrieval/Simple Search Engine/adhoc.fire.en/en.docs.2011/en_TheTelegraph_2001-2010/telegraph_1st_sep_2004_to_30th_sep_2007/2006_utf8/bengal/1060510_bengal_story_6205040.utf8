The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Leader slips out to make a living

 RABI BANERJEE

 Samar: A decent life at last

 Tehatta, May 9: His village knew he was missing. His family knew he was of some worth finally. His party, the Trinamul Congress, came to know on April 22 that theyve lost a leader, though not his vote.

 Samar Pramanik, 40, was a popular man in his village, Gopalpur in Nadia, about 150 km from Calcutta, and he had to pay a heavy price for that. 

 Jobs started drying up since he became a panchayat member in 1998 because many thought he had become too big to still work as a labourer.

 In a few years, Samar stopped earning a penny, and his mother, wife, three daughters and two sons survived on about Rs 400 that he got every month for attending panchayat meetings. 

 Pushed to the brink, he slipped out of the village nine months ago, telling his wife and mother he was going to Calcutta. 

 As the village of 1,600 people wondered where their elected representative had vanished, his wife Deepali received a money-order of Rs 1,500, about a month after he had left. The cash kept coming and the familys apparent lack of concern over the disappearance became permanent.

 But when Nadia voted, Samar was in the queue at a poll booth.

 From a few disbelieving gazers, the crowd around him swelled to a few hundred. Tumi kemon neta he, amra tomaye kajer shomoy paina? (What sort of a leader are you that we dont get you when we need you?) asked someone. 

 The panchayat never provided me two square meals a day. Look at my hut, the cracks on the mud walls. Id love to work for you but wholl feed my children and my old mother? Samars eyes welled up.

 The roads are bad, the school needs a new coat of paint, someone else was still keen to be heard.

 Because of you, I became a leader who could not work for a living, Samar replied. 

 Deepali said politics was killing the family. One day, I asked him if he wanted to continue in politics and see us die.

 After he left home last August, Samar did go to Calcutta. Then he went farther ? to work at construction sites in Orissa, Maharashtra and Gujarat, earning Rs 3,000 a month.

 When I was a panchayat member, my daughters (Asha, Soma and Rakhi, who are between 15 and nine) had to drop out of school to help their mother earn from sewing jobs. My youngest son Bijoy, who is a year old, suffers from malnutrition, Samar told the villagers surrounding him.

 Last year, he had approached his district Trinamul leadership for help. It didnt come.

 We had told Samar that we were facing a financial crisis ourselves, said Naresh Chaki, the president of the partys Nadia unit.

 Samar has had enough of being a leader. Once the election results are out, hell go back to work.

 His daughters, of course, would love to have him stay with them. But they understand. I was not used to my father being away from home for so long. But then he started sending money and we could at last have two square meals a day and live a decent life, said Asha, his eldest.

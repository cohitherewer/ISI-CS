 Calcutta, Dec. 18: Violence rocked Bhangar in South 24-Parganas today when Trinamul workers fought police to protest against the fencing of a piece of land that the government said was earmarked for an engineering college.

 Trinamul leaders said the plot at Bairampur village, about 25 km from Calcutta, would be handed over to the Salim Group, but land minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah denied that.

 The 20-acre land was purchased by a private engineering college from farmers for the construction of its building. And it has nothing to do with the Salim projects, the minister said.

 The officer in charge of the Calcutta Leather Complex police station, Prabir Banerjee, was hit by stones and allegedly thrashed with a bamboo pole. 

 Banerjee, who suffered internal injuries, had to be shifted to a city hospital tonight as his condition deteriorated. 

 According to the police, the trouble started around 4 pm when Trinamul workers led by local party MLA Arabul Islam stormed Bairampur to uproot posts and destroy the fence built around the 20-acre plot last night.

 After Trinamul supporters, armed with stones and sticks taken off party flags, attacked Banerjee, Baruipur subdivisional police officer K.P. Barui arrived. His force was also outnumbered and more policemen had to be called from neighbouring Cossipore.

 The police lathicharged the mob. Four Trinamul supporters were hurt in the melee. Eleven people were arrested. 

 We maintained utmost restraint by not opening fire, said South 24-Parganas superintendent of police S.N. Gupta. 

 The Trinamul MLA said the police attacked them without any provocation. He also denied the assault on the officer-in-charge. 

 The fenced land, he said, was meant for the Indonesian conglomerate. 

 The minister, however, said that the land to be acquired by the Salim Group for an expressway between Raichak in South 24-Parganas and Barasat in North and an industrial hub is located about a kilometre from Bairampur.

 Mamata lobs arrest challenge

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Barasat, Jan. 19: Mamata Banerjee, against whom a non-bailable warrant is pending, today dared the government to arrest her.

 If the government has the guts, let someone serve me the arrest warrant. I can assure that no one will resist. But does the government have such courage? the Trinamul Congress chief said at a 50,000-strong rally at Kachhari Maidan in North 24-Parganas ? the place where trouble had broken out on 22 February, 1994.

 Mamata was accused of inciting violence during a demonstration in which one person was killed in police firing.

 Asked why Mamata was not arrested, district superintendent of police Praveen Kumar said: The court did not instruct police to arrest her.

 Over 200 people were charge-sheeted in the case of the 1994 incident, most of whom got bail. But Mamata and some others failed to appear before the court, following which non-bailable arrest warrants were issued.

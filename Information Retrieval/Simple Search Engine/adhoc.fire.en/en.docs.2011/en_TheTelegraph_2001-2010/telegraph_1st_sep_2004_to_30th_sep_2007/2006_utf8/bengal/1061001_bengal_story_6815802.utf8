The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Bid to get airlines back

 SANJAY MANDAL

 Calcutta, Sept. 30: This festival season, it is Bangkok or Singapore. Next year, it might be Kuala Lumpur. 

 The Malaysian government has already drawn up plans for next year to attract more tourists from Calcutta. It will also speak to Malaysian Airlines about a return to the city. 

 The Visit Malaysia Year 2007 campaign to mark the countrys 50th year of Independence has been launched. 

 We will discuss with the airline the reason for its withdrawal of operations from Calcutta and the probabilities of its return, Datuk Seri Tengku Adnan B Tengku Mansor, the Malaysian minister of tourism, told The Telegraph. 

 With a team of senior officials, he was here as part of an India-wide tour to promote tourism in his country. 

 Calcutta is looked upon as a place of interest and there is a lot of tourist movement to Southeast Asia from here, Mansor said. However, economic viability (for the airlines operations) is vital.

 Malaysian Airlines pulled out from Calcutta earlier this year and the official reason was lack of passengers. 

 It is important to have direct connectivity between Kuala Lumpur and Calcutta to promote tourism in that country, admitted Sanjay Budhia, the honorary consul of Malaysia in Calcutta. 

 Travel agents feel Malaysia has the potential to become a more popular destination. Around 10,000 tourists (from the city) went there last year. The number is likely to be higher this time, said Tarakeswar Singh, chairman (eastern India), IATA Travel Agents Association. 

 To attract tourists, the Malaysian ministry is organising events such as an international firework competition, international tattoo show, a motorcycle grand prix and a dragon boat festival. 

 From September 1, the country has introduced visa on arrival for Indians. For Rs 1,300, Indians can now avail the papers valid for 30 days.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Parade to catch cops

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 15: Police will conduct an identification parade to catch the two constables who had abused a 26-year-old woman in front of the municipal corporation yesterday after she refused to pay them a bribe.

 We have collected the names of all the constables present on duty yesterday at Calcutta Municipal Corporation and its adjoining areas. The woman will be called on Monday for the identification parade, said Tapan Pramanik, additional officer-in-charge of New Market police station.

 Around noon yesterday, Tanushree Ghosh, a resident of Howrah, was on her way to her Lenin Sarani office, riding pillion on brother Amits motorcycle. When they reached Corporation Place near the main gate of the CMC, the two constables stopped them.

 They asked Amit to show them the motorcycles papers and demanded that they pay a fine of Rs 1,000 as the vehicle did not have a number plate. 

 Tanushree told them they had bought the bike a few days ago and that the registration would only be complete on Saturday. One of the constables then told her to pay Rs 650. 

 Tanushree, realising that she and her brother were at fault, agreed to pay Rs 1,000 and asked the constables to call a traffic sergeant to collect the amount. 

 One of the cops then grabbed her hand from behind, hurling abuses at her, and tried to drag her away. When Tanushree pushed him and began shouting, they fled.

 Following a written complaint, officers from New Market police station accompanied Tanushree to the spot to identify the guilty duo. But there was no sign of them. 

 An investigation is on to trace the two constables and they will be brought to book, deputy commissioner (headquarters) P.K. Chatterjee said.

 No trace of imposter

 Police are yet to trace the middle-aged man who robbed a Japanese student of Rs 1,850 off Park Street yesterday masquerading as a police officer.

 When L. Tsui, 24, asked the man for directions to Indian Museum, he snatched her purse, got into a taxi and fled.

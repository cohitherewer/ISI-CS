The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Land taken, damages zero

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 6: Eighteen families ousted from their land 37 years ago for the construction of a highway have yet to get the compensation due to them.

 From 1969 to 2005, they were told that it was coming the following year. 

 Their patience finally wearing thin, the residents of Birnagar in Ranaghat, about 160 km from Calcutta, moved court last year. 

 A lawyer for the petitioners said according to the 1969 rate, the value of the acquired land would not be less than Rs 50 lakh. The government will now have to pay over Rs 3 crore, including the interest accrued.

 The high court today issued contempt rule to the PWD secretary and the Nadia district magistrate for their failure to pay the damages. 

 Justice P.K. Chatterjee asked the principal secretary of the PWD, P.K. Agarwal, and district magistrate Rajesh Pandey to appear before this court on June 20 and state why contempt proceedings should not be drawn against them for not paying the compensation by May 31.

 Early this year, the judge had asked the PWD to provide the compensation money to the district land acquisition collector so that it could be paid to Gita Rani Basu and 17 others.

 Justice Chatterjee had also asked the authorities concerned to file a compliance report before the court by June 6.

 When the case came up for hearing today, the land acquisition collector filed a report saying the court order could not be carried out because the PWD had not released the funds yet.

 The petitioners had alleged before the court earlier this year that the district land acquisition collector had issued notices to them requisitioning more than 25 acres for the construction of the Ranaghat-Krishnagar state highway in 1967-68. 

 Finally, in 1969, the district land acquisition collector acquired the plots with an assurance that compensation would be paid at the market rate. But they havent got a farthing, the lawyers told the court.

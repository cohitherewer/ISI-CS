The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Dunlop dues

 Calcutta, Feb. 23: The government is willing to allow concessions on outstanding dues of Dunlops Shahgunj unit, says our staff reporter.

 Weve allowed exemptions to closed units earlier to facilitate their reopening. Well do the same for Dunlop, said commerce and industries minister Nirupam Sen today.

 At a meeting chaired by Sen, various departmental secretaries, including the commercial tax commissioner, took stock of the units dues to their departments.

 The secretaries have been asked to examine the extent to which waiver can be allowed, said a senior state government official.

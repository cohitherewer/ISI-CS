The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Rs 2-crore shield for CM

 KINSUK BASU

 Calcutta, March 20: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees security would be recast to neutralise the threat from Maoists who, according to intelligence reports, are now adept at remote-controlling explosions.

 The finance department has already cleared the Rs 2-crore plan and the list of gadgets to be purchased has been forwarded to the Union home ministry for approval.

 State home department sources said the prompt clearance came in the wake of an Intelligence Bureau report that outlined the heightened threat to the chief minister when the extremists have gained expertise in the use of sophisticated weapons and an upper hand in Bankura, Purulia and West Midnapore. 

 The must-buy list drawn up by the bureau includes two bullet-proof cars, one of which is already on its way from its manufacturer ? the ordnance factory at Medak in Andhra Pradesh. 

 Two years ago, the government had bought five bullet-proof cars to strengthen the chief ministers security. But he was reluctant to be cocooned in a security blanket and the vehicles had to be deployed elsewhere.

 One of the cars was sent to Siliguri for the chief ministers use there. The militant Kamtapur Liberation Organisation (KLO) is considered a major threat in the region. 

 Two of the cars were kept aside for VVIPs entitled to Z and Z-plus security. The remaining two are with the special branch of Calcutta police ? one as a standby for Bhattacharjees car and the other a general back-up.

 However, this time, intelligence officials said, they have been able to convince the chief minister about the need to enter the cocoon. 

 A vehicle-mounted jammer ? like the one that trails the Prime Ministers convoy and those of others entitled to Z-plus security ? will also be purchased. This Rs-1 crore device can jam all remote signals used to trigger blasts. 

 Special mine detectors figure on the list. The detectors now in use can identify mines only a foot underground and have not been very effective in West Midnapore, Bankura and Purulia, where the Maoists have on occasion planted mines deep in the ground. 

 Personnel of the special unit that is in charge of the chief ministers security would get bullet-proof jackets.

 Justifying the recast, the intelligence report details the recent change in the Maoists tactics. Senior police officers are now frequenting the rebel strongholds to reassess Bhattacharjees threat perception.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Hunt on for Bengals girl runners 

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 10: The CID told the high court today that it was hot on the heels of a gang that smuggles women from rural Bengal.

 During the hearing of the bail petition of Laxmi Rani Singh, a Uttar Pradesh resident and an alleged trafficker, the CIDs lawyer said: Four girls from Durgapur and Asansol, who had been taken to Lucknow and then sent to Mumbai and forced into flesh trade, have been rescued so far.

 The division bench of Justices D.P. Sengupta and S.K. Gupta rejected the bail plea.

 In December, a police team from Burdwan arrested four people, including Laxmi Rani, from Lucknow on the basis of a complaint lodged by Debaki Shaw, a 17-year-old from Ushagram in Asansol. 

 Debaki had alleged that Shiv Kumar Singh, a trader from Uttar Pradesh, came to her house and told her poor father that he wanted to marry her. 

 His smart appearance convinced her parents, but after marriage Shiv allegedly took her to Mumbai via Lucknow and handed her to Rambabu Singh, for Rs 60,000. 

 Debaki said: Rambabu sent me to Laxmi Rani, who forced me into prostitution.

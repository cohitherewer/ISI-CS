 Trader son found dead

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 15: Police today found the body of 25-year-old Arghya Daw, a businessmans son who went missing from his Muchipara home on June 10.

 The body was lying in a paddy field at Dhaniakhali in Nadia district. Taken to the site, Arghyas family identified the body. 

 The day after Arghya disappeared, his family got a call demanding that Rs 5 lakh be handed over at Tarapith. But the police are also probing whether the murder is linked to a property dispute with relatives. A close relative of Arghya has been missing since June 13. 

 No one has been arrested so far.

 Fatal fall

 Lalu Pandit, a 24-year-old mechanic, died after the parapet on which he was standing gave way while he was repairing an air-conditioner on the second-floor of a building on Park Street this morning. 

 Pandit fell on a passer-by, Park Circus resident Mohammed Nizamuddin, who was seriously injured.

 A resident of Titagarh in North 24-Parganas, Pandit was rushed to National Medical College, where he succumbed to his injuries.

 Beniapukur police have started a case of negligence against Pandits employer.

 There was no scaffolding to help the mechanic reach the top of the second floor while attending to the air-conditioner. As a result, Lalu had to stand on the parapet, which collapsed, said an officer of Beniapukur police station.

 The police are also probing whether the three-storey building ? 76 Park Street ? was properly maintained. The building does have a fresh coat of paint but maintenance involves a lot of other things as well, the officer said.

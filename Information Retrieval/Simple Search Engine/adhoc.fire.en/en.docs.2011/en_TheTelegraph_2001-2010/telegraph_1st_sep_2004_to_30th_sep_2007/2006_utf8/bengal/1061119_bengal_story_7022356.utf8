 Calcutta, Nov. 18: A gang raided an ATM counter of the State Bank of India today and tampered with the machine but failed to steal any cash.

 Police are probing the incident, which took place early this morning at Haltu in Kasba.

 The bank officials have given us in writing that the money kept in the ATM has not been stolen. They said it was almost impossible to break the vault because of its foolproof technology. But we have launched a probe to find out who were involved, said a senior officer of Kasba police station.

 When a customer of the bank went to the ATM around 8 this morning, he found the place ransacked. He informed some local residents, who reported the matter to Kasba police station.

 The police found the ATMs monitor smashed and the central processing unit damaged. 

 There were marks to suggest that the gang had tried to open the vault.

 In course of our investigations, it turned out that the door of the ATM, which would usually open only with the banks ATM card, had been defective for the last few days. Therefore, anyone could enter the counter, said a police officer.

 The police believe the culprits were local residents who came to know that the door was defective and had accordingly planned their operation.

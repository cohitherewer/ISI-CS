 Calcutta, May 27: Junior doctors and medical students protesting against reservation today put the outpatients department of Medical College and Hospital under lock and key.

 The hospitals 12 OPD units were shut from 9 am to noon, keeping hundreds of patients, including children, waiting. 

 The doctors later started a makeshift parallel OPD on the hospital premises. But by then, most patients had left.

 Till now, we had not closed OPDs although we were contemplating it. But there is no other way as the government is not paying heed to our demands, said Debjit Saha, a house staff and a member of Youth for Equality, the organisation spearheading the nationwide agitation against reservation for Other Backward Class students.

 The protesters are planning a similar move in all medical college hospitals in the city from Monday. There could be trouble in store with some senior doctors and the Junior Doctors Council opposed to shutting down the OPD.

 The act was unprecedented and shameful. We cannot allow them to harass the patients, said Kaushik Rakshit, medical officer of the hospitals cardiology department.

 Arunava Dhar, a member of the council, said it would oppose any move to harass the patients.

 Around 9 am, the hospital staff and doctors were about to start work when a group of medicos barged into the OPD building and asked everyone to go out. Then they locked the units.

 Witnesses said there was a scuffle between some relatives of patients and the protesters. Some patients got locked in the OPDs. They were later rescued by the authorities, Rakshit said.

 Some senior doctors and members of the council held a counter-rally at the spot and appealed to the agitators to reopen the OPD units. 

 The quota protest spilled onto the streets with nearly 5,000 junior and senior doctors, engineering students and guardians marching from Medical College and Hospital to Shahid Minar.

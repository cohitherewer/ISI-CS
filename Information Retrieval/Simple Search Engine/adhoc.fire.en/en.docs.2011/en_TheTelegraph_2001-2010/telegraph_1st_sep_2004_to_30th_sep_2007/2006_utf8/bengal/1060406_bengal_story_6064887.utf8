The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Election job scare takes toll

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, April 5: Pradip Sain, 54, a PWD employee, committed suicide today, allegedly not being able to bear the tension of having to go on election duty. 

 Sain had been short-listed for poll work in Nadia on April 22. His wife Bharati said he was an asthma patient. 

 He was very tense and used to tell me he didnt know how he would carry out the responsibilities. When I asked him to go to the district magistrate and plead exemption on health grounds, he refused. He did not wish to use his failing health to avoid the job.

 Sain was found hanging from the ceiling of his room in his government flat at Krishnagar town, about 85 km from Calcutta, this morning. 

 Police said he committed suicide while his wife went out to escort their 16-year-old daughter to her private tutors house around 9.30 am. 

 There was no suicide note, though. 

 Sains son Pritam, an unemployed graduate, was also absent from home when he locked himself up in his room.

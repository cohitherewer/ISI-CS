 Boyfriend sells teen to brothel

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Oct. 27: A teenager, who was sold to a brothel in Calcutta allegedly by her boyfriend but managed to flee the place and go to police, was shot dead last night. 

 Police said Sandhya Das was in love with Abhijit Das, 25, who was put behind bars after she alleged that with friend Arijit, he had sold her to Sonagachhi for Rs 12,000.

 Now on bail, Arijit Das, 26, had been threatening Sandhya to get her complaint against them withdrawn. But the 19-year-old daughter of a daily labourer refused to go back on it. 

 At Sutra village in Nadias Chakdah, about 70 km from Calcutta, she was first hacked and then shot dead.

 In August, Sandhya escaped from the red-light zone and returned home. Both Abhijit and Arijit were picked up, but Arijit obtained bail last month. Since then, the local tough has been harassing Sandhya.

 On October 5, her house was set on fire. But the teenager had the support of father Asit and mother Chhabi to go ahead with the case. 

 On October 8, the police came to inquire about the arson and, while going through the debris, found six crude bombs in a bush near the house. Asit was arrested.

 The two had promised her a job in Calcutta. All along we thought they would kill my daughter as she refused to bow to their threats. They set fire to our house and planted bombs to falsely implicate my husband, said Chhabi. 

 The gang of four that attacked the Dases house last night slashed Chhabi with daggers when she rushed to her daughters rescue. Sandhya died before she could be taken to hospital. Her mother was admitted to the Chakdah state general hospital by her neighbours, said an officer of the local police station. 

 The culprits will be arrested soon, said Debasish Roy, the Murshidabad range deputy inspector-general of police. We have received several names, including that of Arijit, among Sandhyas attackers.

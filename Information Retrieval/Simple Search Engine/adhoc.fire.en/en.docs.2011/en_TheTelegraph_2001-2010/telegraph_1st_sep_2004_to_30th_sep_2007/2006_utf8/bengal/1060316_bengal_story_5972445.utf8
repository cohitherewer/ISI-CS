The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 EC watchdog for conduct

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, March 15: The Election Commission has ordered the creation of a monitoring cell to keep vigil on politicians now bound by the model code of conduct.

 In the run-up to earlier elections, there used to be a cell to deal with complaints lodged by political parties and the public. Steps were taken only on the basis of complaints. 

 But this year, the commission has made it clear, the state election authorities will have to take the initiative and look into whether there has been any violation of the code of conduct. 

 We can monitor cases of violation suo motu and take appropriate action after informing the commission, chief electoral officer Debasish Sen said. 

 Political parties in general and ministers in particular are now under surveillance. 

 The commission has also asked the election authorities to examine instances of alleged violation that have been written about or shown in the media and find out their veracity. 

 The poll panel is now looking into reports of an agreement signed between the labour department and the management and employees union of a private company in east Calcutta. The pact was reportedly signed after the conduct code came into effect on March 1.

 Sen said: The agreement is being looked into. I had talks with the Election Commission in this regard. 

 Acting on the commissions directives, the government has decided to launch a combing operation in the Maoist strongholds ? West Midnapore, Bankura and Purulia. 

 The chief minister today reviewed the details of the mission in a meeting with chief secretary A.K. Deb, home secretary P.R. Roy and director- general of police S.C. Avasthy. 

 Roy said the state was waiting for the Union home ministrys response to its demand for the deployment of 600 companies of central forces by March 31. The three districts will go to polls on April 17.

 But sources said only 60 companies would be available by April 2 and a hundred more by April 10.

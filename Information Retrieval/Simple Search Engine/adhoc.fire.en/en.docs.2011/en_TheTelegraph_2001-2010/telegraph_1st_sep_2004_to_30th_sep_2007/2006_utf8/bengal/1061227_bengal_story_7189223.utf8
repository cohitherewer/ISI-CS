The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Centre, state in Maoist fight plan

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 VK Duggal: Double-barrelled offensive

 Calcutta, Dec. 26: The Centre will launch a two-pronged fight jointly with Bengal to tackle Maoist activities in Purulia, Bankura and West Midnapore, Union home secretary V.K. Duggal said today.

 The strategy involves he- ightened police operations and a flood of development activities in the Naxalite-hit areas, some of the most impoverished in Bengal.

 While there would be a surge of development initiatives, a series of counter operations would also be undertaken, Duggal said on the sidelines of a conference on urban policing in the city. 

 You will surely witness more combat operations but that would be just a part of the strategy, he added.

 Duggal also expressed hope that the turn of events in Nepal would impact the Maoists in India. We hope that a large number of women cadre would give up arms and that should have a positive impact all over, including Bengal. By 2007, Maoist activities should be on the wane, he said.

 On a days visit, Duggal met chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb. Among what they discussed were border policing and threats from ISI and other subversive agents.

 The border issue is a cause for major concern and we had a meeting in presence of senior officers from the BSF. There are some problems with land acquisition but it has been agreed upon that by March 2007, border fencing of the Phase II would be completed, Duggal said. 

 Insiders said continuing insurgent operations from the jungles of Bhutan and intelligence gathering also featured on the agenda.

 We have had talks with the Bhutan government about the camps.... But we need to have more police and the Bengal government has agreed to recruit 5,000 personnel soon against a vacancy of 50,000 to strengthen policing at the grass-roots level, Duggal said. 

 India has handed to Bangladesh a list of ISI operatives and their sleeper cells operating from there, he added. 

 It has also been decided that six police stations in coastal Bengal would be strengthened to counter subversive activities using the sea route.

 Maoists loot bank amp; rob cops

 OUR BUREAU

 Midnapore/Purulia, Feb. 13: Maoist guerrillas looted a bank in Bankura today and walked away with police rifles from a camp in Purulia.

 Police said the strikes could be to avenge the arrest of two Maoist women from West Midnapores Belpahari six days ago.

 Seven CPI (Maoist) activists armed with rifles and carbines arrived on bicycles at the Bikrampur branch of Allahabad Bank in Sarenga, 300 km from Calcutta, around noon. At the first-floor office, an armed policeman confronted them, but he was overpowered and tied up. 

 There was another armed policeman, Rabi Soren, in the bank. He could not shoot from his rifle, as there were customers inside. Maoists also overpowered him and threw him down from the first floor. 

 Soren was seriously injured. The rebels took the policemens rifles.

 The guerrillas pointed their guns at the manager and other employees and asked them to open the vault. They took away Rs 91,000.

 The manager called police, who almost caught up with the dacoits. After a shootout near Dataram village, they left their cycles and a bag behind and fled into the Sarenga forest, Midnapore range deputy inspector-general G.P Singh said. The bag was packed with ammunition.

 A gang raided the Kantadih police camp, located in a health centre off Tata-Purulia Road about 300 km from Calcutta, around 6.30 pm and snatched five rifles and three muskets from 10 policemen. 

 The Purulia police chief said the rebels, who hurled a bomb and beat up the policemen, fled towards Ayodhya Hills.

 Poverty crushes first-division boy

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Nov. 13: An 18-year-old who had passed Madhyamik with first-division marks three years ago but had to quit studies because of poverty has committed suicide, unable to steer his family towards a brighter future.

 Rabin Ghoshs dreams of higher studies were shattered when his father Nityagopal, a small husk and rice bran trader, virtually became bankrupt after marrying off his only daughter in 2005. 

 Rabin left his studies last year, when in Class XII. 

 At Simulia in Nadias Nakashipara, 130 km from Calcutta, he had also attempted suicide a fortnight ago.

 A senior police officer said a tearful Nityagopal told a probe team how the pressure of contributing to the family mounted on Rabin since his sisters marriage. 

 Nityagopal had spent about Rs 50,000 for the wedding. Of late, he had started asking his eldest son to go out and try to earn. Rabin realised that his education was meaningless to his family. Had he gone to college, it would take another four years, by when the family would have starved to death, the officer said. 

 Rabin wanted his brother Akshay, a Class IX student, to continue studies as he was also a good student. 

 After quitting school, Rabin started giving private tuitions and soon drew quite a few students. He earned about Rs 1,500 a month. 

 Nityagopal, 45, earned around Rs 1,000 a month. The family lived on a tight budget until Rabins mother Chinu, 40, took ill early this year. 

 Doctors detected a major heart ailment and one of her valves needed to be operated on. The surgery would cost about Rs 1 lakh. 

 We lived hand to mouth. Rabin became very tense and visited houses of our well-to-do relatives for help. But no one came forward. He gradually became frustrated and it showed, said Nityagopal.

 The tension also affected his tuitions. Some of the students left him.

 Akshay had saved Rabin the last time he tried to hang himself. He had forgotten to bolt the door and Akshay entered the room in the nick of time. Rabin did not make that mistake last night.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Go-slow on landfill nod

 Calcutta, Sept. 13: Land minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah today said his department would not take the initiative to grant approvals to those who had illegally converted water bodies and farmland for industrial or real estate purposes.

 The minister had told The Telegraph on Tuesday that his department was mulling an amendment to the West Bengal Land Reforms Act, 1955, to give post-facto approval to cases of conversion, apparently bowing to pressure from the builders lobby.

 Today, he said the issue should be placed before the cabinet as it involves an amendment to the land reforms law. 

 Over 33,000 such cases of conversion are now pending with the department. It is also under pressure to regularise an industrial complex at Sankrail in Howrah, which came up on farmland without the requisite clearances. The government had earlier said it would regularise the project. 

 But Mollah today said the issue was complex because once his department gives approval to the Sankrail project, it would have to do the same in all the other cases.

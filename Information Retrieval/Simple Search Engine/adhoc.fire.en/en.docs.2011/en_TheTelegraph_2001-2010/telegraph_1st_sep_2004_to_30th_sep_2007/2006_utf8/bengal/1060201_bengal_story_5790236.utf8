 BRIEFS

 Purulia, Jan. 31: A block development offi- cer in Maoist-infested Jhalda got a letter today that says his head will be severed if he does not heed peoples needs.

 District magistrate Mukul Sarkar said the letter to the BDO of Kotshila, 305 km from Calcutta, says: If you do not improve relations with local people, your head will be chopped off and gifted to your wife. The Purulia police chief said the writing in red ink is being examined.

 Rights rap on health centres

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Barasat, Jan. 11: The chairman of the state human rights commission, Shyamal Sen, today slammed the health authorities of North 24-Parganas for failing to keep a watch on the performance of the health centres.

 Sen sought a report from district magistrate Manoj Pant and the health authorities after visiting a health centre and the district hospital. He said he was shocked by the appaling condition there.

 I visited a block primary health centre at Thakurnagar, 55 km from Calcutta, and found there were no patients. There was a doctor but he could not explain why patients from nearby villages were unwilling to visit the health centre for treatment, he said.

 Sen also alleged that the health centre authorities later asked two local residents to visit the centre posing as patients.

 Sen asked district officials accompanying him to find out the reason why patients chose to avoid the health centre.

 Debashish Biswas, a patient at the Barasat district hospital, 23 km from Calcutta, told Sen that he was not getting blood though a requisition had been sent two days ago.

 Sen asked the district magistrate to conduct an inquiry into the functioning of the blood bank and inquire into the quality of food.

 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, Aug. 29: The high court today acquitted 12 people who were sentenced to life for murder in three cases. 

 Three division ben- ches ruled that the ses- sions judges had made mistakes while convicting eight people from Hooghly, three from North 24-Parganas and a West Midnapore man.

 Durgapur: A Citu-affiliated worker was suspended on Monday night for allegedly assaulting a Durgapur Steel Plant officer. Sunil Kisku had apparently been asked to get back to work when he was idling. Citu den- ied the charge.

 Krishnagar: Trinamul leader Sushil Biswas, a former CPM MLA, was arrested for the alleged murder of a CPM worker. His two sons were also held after a revolver, pipegun and bullets were found in their house, 90 km from Calcutta. 

 Calcutta: Badal Sinha, the math teacher of a Kulpi school who was detained on Monday for caning a girl, has been arrested. Ruma Haldar had been punished because her mason father had made mistakes in his written explanati- on for her absence.

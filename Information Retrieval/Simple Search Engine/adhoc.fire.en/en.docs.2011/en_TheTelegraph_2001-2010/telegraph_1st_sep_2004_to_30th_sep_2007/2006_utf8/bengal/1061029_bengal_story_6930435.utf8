 Criminals in khaki: CPM 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Shantipur, Oct. 28: With a stunned police chief looking on, a CPM leader today said a section of the force was nothing but registered anti-socials.

 People often tell me about their bitter experiences about policemens behaviour. A section of them is nothing but registered anti-socials and I believe that the allegation is absolutely true, said Rama Biswas, chief of the Nadia zilla parishad.

 When his turn to speak came, director-general of police A.V. Vohra gave it back, suggesting that the ruling party change itself to get better policing. 

 You get the police force you deserve, he said, adding that the leaders sometimes mould the force the way they like.

 The CPM leader and the police chief were speaking at the opening of a new building for Shantipur police station in Nadia, about 70 km from Calcutta. 

 Biswas urged the police to be more responsible when dealing with people and not harass then unnecessarily. 

 The director-general rued that the polices contribu- tion to society is not remembered and they are only made the butt of criticism. 

 Biswass tirade against the police is not the first by a CPM leader. Two years ago, land minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah had accused the police force of being among the most corrupt. The chief minister is in charge of the police department and Mollahs critique was believed to have been aimed at him.

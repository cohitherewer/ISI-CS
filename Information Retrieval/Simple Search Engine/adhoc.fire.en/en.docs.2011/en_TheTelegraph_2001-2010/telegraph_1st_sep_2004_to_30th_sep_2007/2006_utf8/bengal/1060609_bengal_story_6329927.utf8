 CPM in Singur strikeback

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Singur, June 8: The CPM today launched a counter-offensive against the Trinamul Congresss false propaganda to win farmers support in Singur.

 The state government wants to acquire 1,000 acres in Singur in Hooghly district, about 45 km from Calcutta, for Tata Motors small-car project. 

 Yesterday, many farmers, fearing eviction, rallied behind the Krishijami Bachao Committee (Save Farmland Committee) when its leaders, Trinamuls Saugata Roy and Partha Chatterjee, came here. The farmers pledged to fight the acquisition of their land.

 The Hooghly unit of the CPMs Krishak Sabha today met and finalised a string of programmes to reassure disgruntled farmers who are misinformed about the governments compensation package. 

 Krishak Sabha secretary Samar Baora said in Calcutta today that the Tatas would keep in mind the interests of the poor and marginal farmers whose land is taken. 

 From today onwards, our district leaders will work at the grassroots level to counter Trinamuls false propaganda. You will see in the coming days that farmers are with us, he said. 

 The following decisions were taken at todays meeting:

 Krishak Sabha will invite memberships from Singur farmers to gauge their mood

 Bipartite meetings will be held to improve co-ordination among the peasant wings of Left Front partners

 Senior CPM leaders will address farmers in Singur next month.

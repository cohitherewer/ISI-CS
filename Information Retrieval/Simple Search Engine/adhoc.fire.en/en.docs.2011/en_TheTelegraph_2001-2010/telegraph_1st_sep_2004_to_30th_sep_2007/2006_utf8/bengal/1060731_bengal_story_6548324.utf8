Purulia/Calcutta, July 30: An air of gloom descended on Deben Mahato Sadar Hospital in Purulia as the body of Swati Das was placed in the hearse for the journey home to Ariadaha, Dakshineswar.

 Her uncle and members of a local club, who had come here to claim the body after the post-mortem, maintained a grave silence.

 At 10.15 tonight, Swatis body reached her Kalinath Ghosal Road residence. 

 It will remain for the night at Sunday Club of which she is a member. She will be cremated tomorrow after her elder brother, an engineer in the US, arrives.

 Her parents broke down as the hearse came to a stop in front of the house. I dont want any inquiry. My daughter wont come back, said father Sanyasi Charan.

 A JU team, which came to Purulia to search for Arundhati, who is still missing, stayed back at the hospital till late afternoon when Subhankar Sahas body, too, was brought out for the ride to his home in Dinhata, Cooch Behar.

 At the hospital, Swatis uncle Balaram Koley said: It was just a few days ago that we spoke to her, urging her not to go for the trek at this time of the year. Now her body lies in front of me. It seems so unreal. 

 Koley and Swatis club mates reached Bagmundi this morning by train and went straight to the police station. We went there to find out if they (Kaushik and Bappaditya) knew anything. But they avoided us. Its very fishy, said Mana Das, a club member.

 As only one hearse was available, Subhankars family had to arrange for a mini-truck. The body was laid in a wooden coffin and covered with ice. His uncle Madan Saha said the family didnt want a probe. Everything is finished. What is the use?

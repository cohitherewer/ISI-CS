 Will clue in man murder 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, May 16: A possible motive behind the murder of 65-year-old Daud Mondal here on Sunday evening could be his intention to change his will, police said today.

 Mondal, who had retired from an accountants job in Calcutta five years ago, had willed his single-storey house and modest savings to youngest daughter Chandrani.

 When his wife Sabita, son Ananda and elder daughter Latika came to know about it, they were shocked. The brother and sister also found it strange that their father would deprive their elderly mother. So they started pressuring their father, who saw reason and planned to change his will, an investigating officer said.

 Mondal was hacked to death in his drawing room on Sunday evening. 

 Chandranis husband Kashi Rao and Anandas estranged wife Rosemary were detained for questioning yesterday.

 As soon as we came to know about the plan to change the will, we started looking for the one who would be most badly hit by it. Kashi Rao was heavily in debt, said another officer.

 Sabita, 60, told the police that Latika, who stays with her husband in Bangalore, and Ananda, who works in a Mumbai hotel, had created pressure on their father to revise the will.

 The needle of suspicion is pointing at someone in the close family circuit, an officer said.

 The police have come to know from Sabitas interrogation that Mondal had been scared of something of late. 

 He had gone to a lawyer in Chapra on Sunday to discuss his will. In the evening, he sent his wife to get a new statuette of Jesus. Maybe he had received threats, an official said.

 The police have also detected contradictions in some of Sabitas statements.

 Last night she told us that she went to buy the Christ statuette at High Street. But they are usually sold near the cathedral, the officer said. 

 However, the district police chief said the police were yet to find anything against Rosemary who had filed for divorce and accused her in-laws of torture.

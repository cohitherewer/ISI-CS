The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 10-year jail for schoolgirl rape

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, May 19: Four teenagers were sentenced to 10 years jail today for raping their former classmate, who later committed suicide.

 Fifteen-year-old Sushmita Roy used to love one of the boys ? Sadhan Kirtonia ? who raped her a year ago in Nadias Murutia, about 190 km from Calcutta.

 Sadhan, Harshajit Bala, Pabitra Das and Bula Tikadar, all between 18 and 19, broke down as a fast-track court judge read out the verdict.

 After the incident, Sushmitas parents secretly married her off to a man thrice her age. She drank pesticide this March.

 Additional sessions judge Prasun Bhattacharjee today said that Sushmita had given the court an account of the events, accusing all four of rape. 

 Each of them was also fined Rs 2,000. If the boys fail to pay up, they will have to spend an eleventh year in prison.

 Public prosecutor Sadhan Mondal said Sushmita could not accept marriage to the middle-aged Siliguri man just to get rid of the social stigma. Some people may have thought that the accused would be set free after the death. But the court was in possession of her statement, in which she described her traumatic experience on February 22, 2005, Mondal added.

 Sushmitas mother Anima sat in a corner of the courtroom wiping tears with the end of her sari as the judge read out his verdict. At last my daughters soul will rest in peace, she said. 

 None of the boys parents was present.

 The Class VIII girl was returning home after school when Sadhan, Harshajit, Bula and Pabitra accosted her on the road. They gagged her and took her to a field and raped her one by one. 

 The next day, Anima took her daughter to the Murutia police station and registered the rape case. 

 Police said Sushmitas father Bhabani, a labourer in Dubai, had objected to her relations with Sadhan. He engineered the rape to take revenge on her, said an officer. 

 All the boys were Sushmitas classmates till the sixth standard. They dropped out of school after that.

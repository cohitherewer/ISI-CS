 Schoolboy in picnic tragedy

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 30: A Class XII student of St Thomas School and another young man, who were part of a group of eight picnickers, drowned while taking a dip in a pond at Sonarpur this evening. 

 South 24-Parganas superintendent of police S.N. Gupta identified the dead as Abhishek Saha, 18, of St Thomas School, Kidderpore, and 24-year-old Jeet Pal. 

 A police team has rushed to the spot. An investigation is already on to ascertain whether there was any foul play, Gupta added. 

 The group of eight and their two cooks had reached a private bungalow at Langalberia in Sonarpur, 21 km from the city, around 1 in the afternoon. 

 All members of the group except Jeet, a businessman, were residents of Manilal Banerjee Road in Kidderpore, the police said. 

 Jeet, though also from Ki-dderpore, lived in a different locality. 

 They had hired a Maruti Omni and an Esteem and set out from the city around 6 am. 

 After spending some time in Sonarpur town, the group apparently headed for Langalberia bungalow, which has a pond on its premises and a signboard declaring that swimming is prohibited. 

 Abhishek allegedly ignored the sign.

 Around 6.30 pm, Abhishek jumped into the pond for a swim. But he began to drown. Seeing him drowning, Jeet dived into the water. But both drowned. We are probing how the drowning took place, an officer of the Sonarpur police station said.

 Other members of the group raised an alarm and the caretaker of the bungalow and some of the villagers rushed in. They were the ones to fish out Abhishek and Jeet.

 They were taken to a nearby nursing home and later to a private hospital off EM Bypass where the duo was declared brought dead, the South 24-Parganas police chief said. Our officers are now questioning their companions, he added.

 The police said when the private hospital refused to issue death certificates, the bodies were taken to a hospital in Ekbalpore.

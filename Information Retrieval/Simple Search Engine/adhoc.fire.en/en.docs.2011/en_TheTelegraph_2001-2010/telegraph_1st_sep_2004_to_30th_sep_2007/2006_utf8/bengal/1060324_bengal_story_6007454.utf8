 Student ire

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, March 23: A group of students in Nadias Karimpur allegedly broke into a school storeroom this morning and set fire to answer scripts and question papers.

 Police said the students of Goash Secondary School, 180 km from Calcutta, were mostly from Class VIII and IX and might have included 15 students who were hauled up for cheating in the annual exam.

 The school authorities lodged an FIR but did not name any student.

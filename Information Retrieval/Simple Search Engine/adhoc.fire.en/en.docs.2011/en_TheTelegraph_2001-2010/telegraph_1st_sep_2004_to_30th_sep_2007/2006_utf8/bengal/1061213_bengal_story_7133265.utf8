The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Approval for BEd colleges, finally

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Dec. 12: The impasse over Bengals unlicensed BEd colleges, which had put the future of over 70,000 students in doubt, has ended. 

 The National Council for Teacher Education has granted accreditation to all 74 colleges with retrospective effect from 1995, higher education minister Sudarshan Ray Chowdhury said today.

 That means the degree granted by these colleges over the past decade will hold good.

 A stalemate had been prevailing since Calcutta High Court ordered in April that courses offered by 28 BEd colleges in the state were illegal as they did not have the national councils accreditation. 

 It was found later that 46 other colleges also did not have the permit to offer the BEd course. 

 The degrees already issued by these colleges, the court said, were not valid. 

 The council said it would not recognise the courses until the colleges applied for accreditation individually. 

 In the wake of the court order and the council directive, all state universities to which the colleges are affiliated deferred their 2006 examinations. 

 The minister today said circulars will soon be sent to the universities, asking them to immediately resume the process of conducting the examinations.

 Under the National Council for Teachers Education Act, 1993, the Centre had made it mandatory for BEd institutions to obtain the councils accreditation before starting the training for teachers.

 But a public interest litigation in the high court first pointed out that 21 north Bengal colleges were not recognised by the council and so their degrees were illegal. In no time, over triple that number of colleges was declared illegal.

 A council team inspected the facilities offered by the 74 colleges in October after they applied for accreditation. 

 The higher education minister said the state had to give over Rs 12.14 crore to the colleges to clear their dues to the council and to pay fines.

 Each college had to pay Rs 30,000 as inspection fee and Rs 5,000 for every student as fine.

 The minister blamed the universities for the impasse. It could have been avoided if the universities had been more vigilant, he said.

 Broom charge in Singur

 OUR BUREAU

 Singur/Calcutta, Aug. 14: Wielding sticks, sickles and brooms, farmers and their families stood in the way of district officials who arrived in Singur today to serve notices for the hearing of objections to land acquisition for the Tata small car project.

 The government has, however, decided to complete the hearing by August 28. It had recently said it would speed up the process of acquiring land.

 Twenty-three district officials, divided into two groups, went to Gopalnagar and Bajemelia villages in Singur . 

 When they reached Bajemelia hospital, they were stopped by around 500 people. 

 At Gopalnagar, the Krishi Jami Banchao Committee had gathered another army of protesters. We will never allow the Tata officials or those in the government to visit our villages, said Jyotsna Barik. 

 The government today decided that further announcements would be made over microphones.

 Kids hold abuse class for cops 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Feb. 25: The citys police force learnt a thing or two about handling child abuse, from children.

 Child welfare officers ? restricted to a few police stations so long ? have recently been appointed in all 48 thanas in the city. Their training kicked off yesterday with an interactive session with students of Loreto School, Sealdah.

 Besides presentations by the schoolgirls on child domestic workers they have known, representatives of NGOs Save the Children, UK, Right Track and Campaign Against Child Labour spoke about cases of abuse where police intervention was indispensable.

 We were a little scared to meet so many cops. But they laughed when we told them how we felt, said students Madhusree Ghosh and Paramita Chakraborty.

 How can the underprivileged children approach the cops when those from well-to-do families are so apprehensive? The idea behind the programme was to convey this point to the child welfare officers, said Christine Gupta, the co-ordinator of the schools anti-child domestic labour campaign.

 Buddha plans Haldia recce

 Bhattacharjee: Industry zeal

 Calcutta, May 20: Chief Minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee is likely to visit some industrial units and meet entrepreneurs when he goes to Haldia on May 24 to open a Rs 400-crore petrol refinery of the Indian Oil Corporation.

 Commerce and industries minister Nirupam Sen and CPM MP Lakshman Seth will accompany the chief minister on his tour to take stock of the industrial scene in Haldia.

 Union petroleum minister Murli Deora and IOC chairman Sarthak Behuria will also attend the opening ceremony.

 Officials of the chief ministers secretariat said Bhattacharjee would soon visit parts of north Bengal, Barjora in Bankura and West Midnapore to ensure that entrepreneurs do not face problems in setting up and running industries. The schedule for the visits will be prepared soon, said commerce and industries secretary Sabyasachi Sen.

 IOCs new unit will produce 3.5 lakh tons of BS-III standard petrol a year. Most of the fuel produced will feed outlets in the city and suburbs.

 According to the national auto fuel policy, all vehicles in Delhi, Calcutta, Mumbai and Chennai, have to ply on BS-III standard fuel. Units to produce BS-III standard petrol and diesel have been set up in the other three metros.

 For Calcutta, officials said IOC has set up an unit in Haldia to produce BS-III standard diesel. But to maintain supply of petrol, the company had to import it in large quantities. At times, this would result in disruption of supply.

 Henceforth, there will be uninterrupted and adequate supply of BS-III petrol and diesel in the city, said IOC general manager Gautam Dutta.

 Dunlop dispute

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, May 23: Representatives of Citu and Intuc at the Sahagunj unit of Dunlop today met labour minister Mrinal Banerjee to discuss the dispute over the agreement on payment of back wages. 

 The government had called the meeting of unions as well as the owner, Pawan Ruia, to discuss the issue but he could not attend as he was abroad.

 The labour minister said after the meeting that the unions were willing to honour the bipartite agreement signed on April 9 but there were some misunderstandings about the calculation of arrears.

 There is logic in what the unions are saying in this matter. May be there is logic also in the managements views. That has to be ascertained, Banerjee said. 

 He said the government was keen to have the factory reopened. In the wake of the April 9 agreement, the plant was tentatively slated for opening in August or September.

 After Ruia took over the management of the unit early this year, trouble began on April 30 when around 4,300 em- ployees refused to accept the first instalment of the one-time settlement of Rs 30,000 for previous arrears. 

 Maintenance work at the plant was also hit after the workers protested against the manner in which the job was assigned to 42 employees.

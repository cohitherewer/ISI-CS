The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Cellphone tracker on killer trail

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 21: A slew of calls to and from cellphones used by the trio of Hardik Vipani, Ankit Desai and his alleged killer Shyam Karia led police to the breakthrough at a break-neck speed.

 When the Desais lodged a complaint with Ballygunge police station on Wednesday saying that Ankit did not return home the previous night, officers asked whether he used a mobile phone. 

 Two of them, his elder sister Pinky, who lives in Bangalore and is now on a visit to her hometown, said. 

 Ankit had been killed by then. The detectives contacted the mobile service provider. 

 They traced the most called and call-received numbers and identified five people, including a woman, for watch.

 We interrogated each of them and gathered details of Ankits lifestyle and the com-pany he kept, an officer said. We came to know how he got acquainted with Shyam and about his time with him in discs and pubs.

 Late on Wednesday even- ing, a police team that went to Shyams house on CR Avenue was told that he had been missing since the day Ankit disappeared. As the focus of the probe narrowed, the sleuths got down to tracing calls made to and from his number. That led to Hardik.

 Statements showed that Hardik and Shyam spoke to each other 35 times the day before Ankit was killed. Ankit, too, had received several calls from Hardiks Pune number.

 The police then went to the Vipanis flat in Bhowanipore. Hardiks twin Hiren was quizzed there along with a common friend, Nishant. At the end of it, the Vipanis were told to get Hardik back at the earliest. The police knew that the end of the puzzle was near.

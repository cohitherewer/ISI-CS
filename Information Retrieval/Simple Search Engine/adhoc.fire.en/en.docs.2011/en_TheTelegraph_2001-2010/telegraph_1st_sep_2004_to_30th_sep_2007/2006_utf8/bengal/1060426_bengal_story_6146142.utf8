The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Minister not for the mundane

 people struggle to get heard by big names far away from the 

 grind 

 ANINDYA SENGUPTA

 Rahara, April 25: Money is important but the tracks can be fatal.

 Residents of Khardah say they have been trying to get this message across to Asim Dasgupta for the past many years. But the finance minister, whom they sent to the Assembly last time with a margin of 24,000 votes, is too busy tracking the states finances to bother about their needs.

 The result is a ticket counter they have been wanting desperately on one side of the station here is yet to come up. It means everyone, young or old, planning to catch a train to Sealdah has to cross the tracks to the counter on the other side and hop back again.

 There is an overbridge but very few use it for lack of time. If you miss a train, its quite a while before the next one rumbles in.

 Our minister doesnt have the time to take care of our problems. He is preoccupied with more important work. And he stays in Salt Lake, far removed from Khardah, said Rahara resident Arun Hazra, a vegetable seller who travels to the Sealdah wholesale market twice a week to buy his stuff cheap.

 Like other constituencies, Khardah ? on the northern outskirts of Calcutta ? which includes Rahara, Mohanpur, Patulia, Ruhia, parts of Barrackpore and four wards of New Barrackpore municipality, has its own share of problems. But it is the ticket counter that seems to be the pressing need of most residents.

 Advocate Manas Kumar Mitra, a long-time Khardah resident, blames the party more than the minister. 

 The CPM, he says, could have easily done this favour to the residents. 

 The party could have asked (MP) Basudeb Acharya to get things done. After all, he is the railway standing committee chairman. A party in power for 29 years could have easily done this, Mitra says.

 Ajoy Saha, who runs a bus service, says ticket counters have been set up on either side of the tracks in adjoining stations Sodepur and Belghoria. If Nantu Ghosh (the Trinamul MLA from Panihati) could do that in Sodepur, why couldnt the CPM here?

 I dont know why, says 71-year-old Ranjit Ghosh, who visits his ailing sister in the city once a week. But it is better not to talk much as Khardah is very much CPM.

 Despite the chorus for the ticket counter, CPM leaders seem hardly bothered. People want it but not everything can be done by our MLA, says a party functionary.

 Dipak Mitra, another member of the partys North 24-Parganas unit, concedes that a counter should be set up but adds that he is not sure whether it would be. There is no such plan yet, he says.

 The CPM leader, who looks after Khardah, says his party is now working on the areas drainage system.

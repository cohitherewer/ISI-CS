 March 17: The higher secondary examination began on a not-so-happy note today with a student committing suicide in the city and another getting crushed on the way to her centre in South 24-Parganas. 

 An examinee believed to have been abducted last night, however, returned home and a girl who staged a kidnap found herself in police custody. 

 Anita Kumari Singh, 19, who got herself transferred to a college from school by furnishing a fake certificate to make sure she did not lose a year, was found hanging in her Behala house this morning. 

 Police said she had got herself admitted to Class XII of Kidderpore College last August by furnishing a forged transfer certificate from Khalsa English High School. 

 ?According to our records, she failed to secure pass marks in English, Hindi, education and political science in her Class XI examination. After that, she stopped coming to school. She wasn?t issued any transfer certificate,? said the Khalsa school principal, Kamalpreet Makol. 

 The college detected the foul play, though after having admitted her. ?Eleven students took admission from her school. Ten of them had produced fake certificates. We didn?t allow them to fill up HS forms,? principal Shamsul Alam said.

 Jerina Khatun was killed and her cousin Rehana, also an examinee, was injured when a mini-bus hit the motorcycle on which they were riding pillion in Kulpi, South 24-Parganas, 70 km from Calcutta. 

 Jerina?s elder brother Illias was taking them to the centre at Janapriya High School. District police chief S.N. Gupta said the two-wheeler went flying after the collision. 

 The conditions of Rehana and Illias are critical.

 Azad Sheikh, who went missing at Goalia village in Bishnupur in the same district, came back. Police said he had fled home to avoid the exam.

 In Hooghly, Paramita Banerjee, who had failed her Class XI exam, was held after she claimed that two men in burqa and travelling in a ladies? compartment had taken her hostage at gun-point.

 The resident of Nabagram in Burdwan, 80 km from Calcutta, was found crying at Kamarkundu station and taken by hawkers to a Government Railway Police booth. 

 Paramita said her father was in a general compartment with her admit card. ?The goons apparently prevented her from getting down at the station nearest to her centre but she fled,? said the GRP officer in charge of Kamarkundu.

 The police rushed her to Dhaniakhali Girls? School and requested the authorities to allow her to write despite the delay but were told that no such candidate was to sit there. Paramita was held for cheating.

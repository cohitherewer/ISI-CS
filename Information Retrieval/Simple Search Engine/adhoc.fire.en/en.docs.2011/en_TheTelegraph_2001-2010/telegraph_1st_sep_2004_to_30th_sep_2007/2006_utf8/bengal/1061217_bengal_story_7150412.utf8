The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Denied leave, jawan fires

 SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE

 Calcutta, Dec. 16: A BSF jawan, posted on the Bangladesh border, fired several rounds in the air yesterday, apparently because he was denied leave.

 Gurmel Singh of the 191st battalion wanted a few days off to go to his home in Punjab. His leave application was turned down three days ago. Since then, Singh had been very agitated, said A.K. Jha, acting in-charge of the south Bengal frontier. 

 Singh is posted at Panitore in Basirhat, about 80 km from Calcutta. 

 Around 10 yesterday morning, Singh suddenly began to shout at his superiors, demanding that he be allowed to visit his home in Punjab, said a BSF official.

 Then he started firing from his service rifle. Koi mere samne mat aao, hum sirf mediawallese baat karenge (Dont come near me, I will only talk to the media), he screamed.

 Some officers, who had tried to pacify him, did not dare venture out of the border post as Singh had already fired 10 rounds in the air. 

 Late in the afternoon, the jawan drove away in a BSF jeep. He went to the nearby Maslandapur railway station, from where he went to Howrah to catch a train to Punjab, said another official. 

 A team of BSF officials followed him to Howrah, where they handed him a letter sanctioning his leave. 

 We allowed Singh to visit his house as he is stressed because of work pressure. But once he returns, we will definitely take action against him, the officer said. 

 BSF officials admitted they are reluctant to sanction leave to juniors because of shortage of manpower. 

 The incident has again brought under glare the alleged ill-treatment of junior personnel manning the India-Bangladesh border.

 S. Dwibedi, a BSF inspector posted in Calcutta, had earlier said in an internal bulletin that border personnel are often ill-treated by their seniors and denied leave. He had also pointed a finger at financial irregularities in the force.

 Dwibedi had moved Calcutta High Court, alleging that he was being harassed. He said the authorities threatened to throw him out of the force by labelling him a psychological patient.

 The case came up for hearing last week. Justice Tapen Sen rapped the BSF authorities and directed them not to conduct any medical test on Dwibedi.

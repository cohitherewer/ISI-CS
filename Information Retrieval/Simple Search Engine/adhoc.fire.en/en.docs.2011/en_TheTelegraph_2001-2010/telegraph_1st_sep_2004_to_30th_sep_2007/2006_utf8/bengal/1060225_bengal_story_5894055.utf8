The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Polls pull Asims purse strings open

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Feb. 24: The government today announced a 2 per cent dearness allowance for its 10 lakh employees payable from March.

 The bounty will benefit state government employees, teachers and non-teaching staff of government-aided schools and colleges and employees of public undertakings, panchayats, municipalities and local bodies in addition to nearly 400,000 pensioners. 

 Flush with funds from the 12th Finance Commission, finance minister Asim Dasgupta has so far awarded four instalments of DA in the current financial year, amounting to 12 per cent of basic pay. The four instalments are likely to cost the government over Rs 500 crore annually.

 The finance department faces an annual salary burden of over Rs 12,000 crore.

 The Bengal governments DA has now gone up to 61 per cent of basic pay. The Centre pays its employees 71 per cent of the basic.

 Were now only three instalments behind the central government. This is the most we could do since we want to strike a balance between developmental work and employee benefits, Dasgupta said at Writers Buildings.

 Our focus at this time is road repair, irrigation proj- ects and repair of embankments, he added.

 Asked if the DA would now be merged with the basic pay as the Centre has done, Dasgupta said the government has not decided on it yet. Well examine the matter at a later stage.

 He refused to say whether the later stage could come before the Assembly elections in May.

 The governments generosity in the run-up to the polls is not limited to awarding DA alone. Since it lifted the embargo on recruitment last September, it has filled up 11,000 vacant posts, the finance minister said.

 The government has also decided to create 550 new posts of college teachers and 21,000 schoolteacher posts.

 Recruitment in place of employees who died in harness has also begun. We have initiated the process. Many cases have already been processed. I dont have the total figures with me, the finance minister said.

 In January, the government set about regularising all contract employees hired on regular vacancies between 2000 and 2005.

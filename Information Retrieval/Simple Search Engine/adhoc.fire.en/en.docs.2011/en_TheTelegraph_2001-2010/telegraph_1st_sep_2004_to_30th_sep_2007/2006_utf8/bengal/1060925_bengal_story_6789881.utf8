 Fruits at lunch fell 100 men of air force

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Siliguri, Sept. 24: Over 

 100 Indian Air Force personnel contracted a bacterial infection 

 after having pineapple and cucumber along with lunch at 

 the Bagdogra air base on Thursday. 

 All of them had to be admitted to the Bengdubi Army Base Hospital. 

 The air base station commander, Group Captain Chandra Mouli, said the airmen were out of danger and would be released by tomorrow.

 The first batch taken ill reported upset stomachs early on Thursday afternoon. Within an hour, another eight to 10 men had started feeling unwell, Mouli said. 

 I personally checked with all my men who had lunch at the mess and found that most either had a stomachache or stomach disorder.

 The group captain said the matter was not serious.

 Doctors at the Bengdubi hospital said uncooked food had caused the infection. All the patients would be all right in a couple of days, added one of them.

 Air force officials said pineapples and cucumbers were the only uncooked items that the airmen had that day. The fruits were procured from the local market. 

 Samples of the fruits have been sent for tests. Once the reports come in, what the caused the illness would be clear, a senior air force officer said, adding that the fruits pesticide content could be a factor.

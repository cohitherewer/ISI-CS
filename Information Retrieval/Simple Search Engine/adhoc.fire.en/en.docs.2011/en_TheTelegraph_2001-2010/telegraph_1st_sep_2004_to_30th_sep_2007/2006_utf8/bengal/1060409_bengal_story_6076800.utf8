The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Snoop-and-steal ATM suspect held

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, April 8: Police have rounded up a youth who has been accused of repeatedly withdrawing money from other peoples ATM accounts.

 Alok Kumar Sonkar, 22, would walk into ATM counters, wait behind customers and then withdraw money from their account. This is possible as all ATM accounts stay activated for a few seconds after a transaction is done. 

 In these few seconds, Sonkar would insert his card and withdraw money from the account of the customer who last used the machine.

 The police found several cards in Sonkars possession when they arrested him from his house. 

 Over the last few months, the 22-year-old had been hopping around from one ATM counter to another across Girish Park, Posta and Burrabazar withdrawing money. 

 On Saturday, Girish Park police rounded him up from his Jorabagan residence after hunting for him for over a fortnight. 

 Sonkar has confessed to withdrawing amounts ranging between Rs 10,000 and Rs 25,000. 

 The police first received a complaint on March 22. 

 We received a complaint from Somnath Sen of Jhampukur Lane claiming that someone had withdrawn an amount from his ATM without his knowledge. The man spoke of an ATM counter on Vivekananda Road and gave a detailed description of the youth who stood behind him while he was operating, said a senior officer at the Girish Park police station.

 Sen told the police that inside the ATM, a youth had asked for his card and soon after he handed it over to him, he realised the mistake. He immediately took it back. 

 Back home after withdrawing Rs 10,000, Sen had a hunch and dialled the banks customer service. He learnt then that another withdrawal had been made from his account.

 After Sen, more such complaints poured in. Finally, this evening, Sonkar was caught.

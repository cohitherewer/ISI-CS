 Mamata shadow on Singur cop transfer

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

Chinsurah, Oct. 7: Chandernagore subdivisional 

police officer Kalyan Mukherjee, who was assisting the administration in acquiring 

land at Singur for the Tata Motors project, has been transferred.

 Mukherjee was present when police resorted to a lathicharge in the early hours of September 25 to disperse Mamata Banerjee and Trinamul Congress workers from the Singur BDOs office.

 Mukherjee, who has completed only eight months as SDPO in Chandernagore, will take over as deputy superintendent of police, discipline and training, South 24-Parganas. He will be replaced by Rishikesh Meena from Purulia.

 Hooghly superintendent of police Supratim Sarkar said Mukherjees transfer was a routine affair.

 Mukherjee refused to comment on whether his transfer was linked to the incident in Singur. I can only tell you that I received an order last night concerning my transfer, he said.

 But officials close to Mukherjee said the sudden transfer is linked to the lathicharge on the Trinamul chief.

 Members of the Krishi Jomi Banchao Committee, which is opposing the land acquisition, will organise a procession tomorrow on the 10-km road from Kamarkundu railway station to Ratanpur to protest against the Tata Motors small-car project.

 Leader of Opposition in the Assembly Partha Chatterjee will lead the procession.

 We will not bow to the CPMs pressure tactics, Becharam Manna, the convener of the committee said. There will be bloodshed if attempts are made to take away land on which we are dependent for our livelihood.

 The district administration has made elaborate arrangements to maintain peace during the demonstration.

 Officials said Congress workers are expected to join the procession along with the Trinamul activists.

 So far, 688 acres have been acquired for the Tata Motors project and 2,269 cheques issued to farmers.

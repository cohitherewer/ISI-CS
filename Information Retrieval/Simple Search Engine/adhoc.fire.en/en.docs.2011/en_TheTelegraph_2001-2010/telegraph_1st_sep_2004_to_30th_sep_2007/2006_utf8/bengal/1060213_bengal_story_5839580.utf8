The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Open school in a new avatar

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, Feb. 12: Over 40 lakh children drop out of schools in Bengal between Class I and X and only a handful of them enrol in the open school system. The government wants a change. 

 It will table a bill in the Assembly in a few days which, among other things, will change Rabindra Mukta Vidyalaya to Rabindra Nath State Council of Open Schooling.

 A government survey had shown that targeted groups ? particularly dropouts from the weaker sections ? were not keen to get enrolled in the open school because of the misconception that a course offered by the Mukta Vidyalaya could not have any academic value.

 From its name, people often mistook our organisation 

 as an ordinary school. We hope to increase our enrolment after 

 it is rechristened Rabindra Nath State Council of Open Schooling, 

 said Jyotirmoy Mukherjee, the head of Rabindra Mukta Vidyalaya 

 said.

The Mukta Vidyalaya (open school) conducts Class X and XII examinations that are equivalent to Madhyamik and Higher Secondary. But only about 18,000 students take the Class X test and 2,000 the HS.

 The government set it up in 1997 to enable dropouts of formal schools to continue their education. 

 In 2001, the Rabindra Mukta Vidyalaya Act was formulated. With the act, pass certificates awarded by the Vidyalaya became equivalent to those awarded by the secondary board and the higher secondary council. A committee under the school education department oversees the open school education.

 The purpose of having the open school was to reach out to students to whom formal education cannot reach. We will restructure its syllabi and teaching methodology in a way that those availing of this education can be taken into the mainstream without a problem, school education minister Kanti Biswas said. 

 According to the Rabindra Mukta Vidyalaya (Amendment) Bill, 2006, the administrative set-up of the proposed council will be more or less similar to the secondary board and the HS council. It will have a whole-time president, a secretary, an academic advisory committee and boards of studies. The Mukta Vidyalaya only has part-time heads.

 The new council will offer a certain flexibility that the other boards do not. Students appearing for its Class X or XII examinations will get to appear in two examinations instead of one ? the first will be followed by another that will be held after six months.

 Moreover, every student under the open school system will get nine chances to clear their exams. Madhyamik and HS students get only three. The mark-sheets of these students will not bear any mention of how many times they had been unsuccessful.

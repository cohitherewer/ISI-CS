The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Friend stabbed for party hug to wife

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Dec. 3: A man killed his buddy here last evening allegedly because he tried to embrace his wife during a party to celebrate their wedding anniversary.

 Mohar Saha stabbed Mahadeb Majumdar several times with a kitchen knife and then tried to hide his body with the help of his wife and friends. 

 Police said Mohar and Mahadeb were of the same age around 35 and in the same business stationery but they were never rivals.

 Both owned shops at the same market in Nakashipara, about 130 km from Calcutta.

 Mohar and his wife Saraswati had called friends home to celebrate their anniversary last evening. 

 When Mohar and 10 of his friends were drinking, Saraswati was busy in the kitchen, an officer of the Nakashipara police station said. The friends were drunk and playing cards while Saraswati served snacks.

 At one point, Mahadeb, who had earlier made lewd remarks at Saraswati, followed her into the kitchen and held her in an embrace. None of those present had noticed him walk into the kitchen. They were alerted by Saraswatis cries for help, the officer added.

 Mohar rushed to the kitchen and flew into a rage when he found Mahadeb trying to molest his wife.

 As the other guests dragged Mahadeb out of the kitchen, Mohar picked up a knife and stabbed his friend repeatedly.

 A profusely bleeding Mahadeb succumbed to his injuries. The guests panicked and advised Mohar to get rid of the body.

 The Sahas took it out of the house and threw it in a paddy field a few kilometres from their house, Nadia superintendent of police Ajay Nand said.

 We found Mahadebs body in the paddy field at Kathalberia this morning. Mahadebs father Krishna told us his son had gone to attend a party at Mohars house, Nand added.

 Mohar and his wife were arrested after that. The couple has apparently confessed to their crime. 

 Saraswati said during interrogation that she had instigated her husband to kill his friend. She also told us that Mahadeb had been eyeing her for a long time. But she did not tell her husband as it could have soured their friendship. We are looking for the others present during the murder, who also tried to hush up the crime, said the district police chief.

 Both Mohar and Mahadeb were married for nearly 15 years and have children aged between 10 and 12.

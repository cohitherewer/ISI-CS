 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Burdwan, Nov. 11: Residents of a Burdwan village ransacked the houses of two CPM leaders who allegedly siphoned off funds for development and mid-day meals in local primary schools.

 Some 200 people, who attacked the houses of Sukur Ali and Basudev Khan at Madhabdihi village in Raina block 2, about 144 km from Calcutta, also swooped down the local CPM office. 

 Police had to lathicharge the mob. Thirty people were injured in the fracas. 

 District superintendent of police Pijush Pandey said 14 people have been arrested. 

 The CPM said the allegations were false. District committee secretary Amal Haldar said hooligans led the attack. We had prevented them from collecting subscriptions forcibly during Puja. Now they are trying to exact revenge, Haldar said.

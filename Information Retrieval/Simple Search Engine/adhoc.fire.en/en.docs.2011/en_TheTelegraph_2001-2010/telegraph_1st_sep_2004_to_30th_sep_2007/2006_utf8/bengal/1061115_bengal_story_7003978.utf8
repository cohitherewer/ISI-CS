The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, Nov. 14: The high court today rejected the bail plea of Ghanshyam Sarda, the former Monozyme India managing director and brother of Govind Sarda, the main accused in the blood test kit scam. 

 Another brother of Govind and Ghanshyam, Jagadish, today moved an anticipatory bail prayer. Police said he is absconding. Ghanshyam was arrested from the airport while trying to flee the city. His lawyers told the court he was not connected with the supply of faulty kits to hospitals and blood banks. The police, though, said the company procured the kits when Ghanshyam was its director.

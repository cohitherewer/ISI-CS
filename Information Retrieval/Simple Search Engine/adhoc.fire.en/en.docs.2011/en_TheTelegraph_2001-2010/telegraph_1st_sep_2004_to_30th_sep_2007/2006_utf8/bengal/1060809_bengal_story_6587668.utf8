 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 8: A man has approached Calcutta High Court alleging that he was beaten up by his wife and driven out of his own house in Dum Dum. 

 The husband also said that even after his complaint, Dum Dum police did not take any action.

 Acting on the petition moved by Subhash Chandra Das, Justice Soumitra Pal of the high court today directed the superintendent of police, North-24 Paraganas, to probe the matter. The judge also asked the officer-in-charge of Dum Dum police station to submit a report.

 Das, 57, a senior auditor in a central government office in Calcutta, said for 14 years, he was subjected to constant torture by his wife, Lakshmi.

 I moved the Barasat criminal court in 1995. The judge had convicted my wife and fined her Rs 500, said Das.

 The petitioner added that after the courts order, his wife had filed a divorce suit and claimed Rs 10,000 per month as maintenance for her and their two children. Though the case is pending, the court ordered Das to pay Rs 2,500 each month.

 Dass lawyer said there was a tenant at Dass house. Recently, the tenant sent him a letter saying he would vacate the flat and requested him to collect the keys. Accordingly, Das went to the flat. As soon as he reached there, his wife, with the help of some local youths, mercilessly beat him up, said the advocate.

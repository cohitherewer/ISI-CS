Four leopard skins, a rhino hide and the skull and bones of a tiger were seized from Ramrati Sharma of Haryana. An official said the stink suggested the animals were killed recently.

 Calcutta: The government is considering a law to prevent water theft. Public health engineering minister Gautam Deb told the Assembly on Friday that rampant water theft, especially in the dry Asansol-Durgapur belt, had prompted him to mull the legislation. We have a law to prevent power theft. Im exploring the possibility of introducing a similar law to stop pilferage of water, Deb said.

 Ragging

 Calcutta/Midnapore, Oct. 17: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has intervened to ensure that action is taken against those involved in ragging Chandrasekhar Pal, a second-year computer science student of the College of Engineering and Management at Haldia.

 Ragging is banned by law. I have personally intervened so that those involved in the crime are punished, Bhattacharjee said this afternoon at Writers Buildings.

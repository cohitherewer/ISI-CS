The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Missing girl found dead

 Missing Jadavpur University trekker Arundhati Ghoshs body was found on Tuesday in these bushes (left) flattened by Fridays flash flood.

 The first-year MPharma student is the third casualty of the Purulia expedition of five JU students who were apparently swept away by a swelling and swift mountain stream in the Ayodhya Hills.

 Swati Das and Subhankar Saha were found dead on Saturday. Arundhatis maggot-infested body was found over 2 km from the place where the five were last said to be together. Her elder brother Samir had one look at it and covered his face in shock. 

 We dont suspect foul play, Purulia police chief Ashoke Prasad said. 

 Survivors Bappaditya Chatterjee and Kaushik Sarkhel were allowed to return home on Monday. 

 In a relatives house in Calcutta, Bappaditya looked jaded (picture above) a day after. The story he said did not match his friends. 

 Bappaditya said the flash flood hit them when they were cooking on the bank of the Sobha. Kaushik had said they were trying to cross it.

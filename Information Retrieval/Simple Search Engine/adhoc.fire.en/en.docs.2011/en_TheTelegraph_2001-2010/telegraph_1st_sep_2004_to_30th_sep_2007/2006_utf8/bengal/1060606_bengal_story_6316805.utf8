The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Bengal model to stem British power theft

 IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI

 Calcutta, June 5: Believe it or not, Bengal has a few tricks to teach the UK. 

 The British are looking east to devise a way to capture power thieves who seem as enterprising as their Bengal counterparts ? so the services of Rajat Majumdar, former additional director-general of police, West Bengal State Electricity Board, have been sought to hound them out. 

 The UKs Revenue Protection Association loses about ?250 million (over Rs 2,100 crore) every year, but its method of tracking down the pilferers is slow, unlike Bengals, said a UK official.

 Majumdar, now the director-general of the state armed police, represented Asia at a conference on revenue protection in Birmingham a fortnight ago and made a presentation on what he called the Bengal model. 

 The UK authorities were impressed. Peter Cotterill, the countrys revenue recovery manager, told The Telegraph over phone from Birmingham: We are very impressed with (the) West Bengal model to control power theft and want to implement it in our country.

 Unlike the state electricity board, the British power utilities have to go through a lengthy process before launching a raid on the alleged pilferers. The power distribution companies raid a place only after a specific complaint is lodged. After the theft or tampering is detected, they report it to the police, who inform the accused that a case is being lodged and proceedings initiated.

 Its a very time consuming, said Majumdar.

 In Bengal, the state electricity board has a loss control unit made up of retired police officers in every district to keep a tab on power theft. 

 They conduct random raids and check meters in front of consumers. If any tampering is detected, a police case is lodged immediately. Its a very transparent process and very fast. Prompt action is taken against those stealing power, Majumdar said.

 Engineers provide technical support to the retired officers in the loss-control units. 

 Majumdar finished his stint as the additional director-general of police, electricity board, earlier this year. During his three-year posting, the board made profits for the first time in 50 years. 

 A spokesperson for the power board attributed the turnaround to the ability to stem theft. In 2003, about half the power distributed was stolen. Three years on, the figure has been brought down to 19 per cent. This is an achievement, said a senior power board official. 

 In 2001, the board had an accumulated loss of Rs 686 crore, but it was reduced to Rs 258 crore in 2004-2005.

 Contrary to the general perception, Majumdar said, a large part of the theft was committed by industries. Investigations have suggested that industries cause the maximum amount of loss.

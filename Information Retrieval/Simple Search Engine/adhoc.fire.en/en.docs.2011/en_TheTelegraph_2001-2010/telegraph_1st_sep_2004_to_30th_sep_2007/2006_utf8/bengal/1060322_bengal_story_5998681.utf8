The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Fear pushes polls to back seat

 OUR BUREAU

 Purulia/Calcutta, March 21: Less than four weeks before the polls, campaign is yet to begin in many Purulia villages. The reason: Maoists.

 CPM leaders of Bandwan are reluctant to admit, though, that they are skirting certain pockets for fear of the rebels. 

 Upen Hansda, the party nominee there, said: We have started campaigning, but on a low key. He added later: Our workers are not participating in large numbers fearing Maoist attacks.

 On July 9, last year, CPM leader Mahendra Mahato was shot dead. On December 31, Rabi Kar and his wife were burnt alive. On January 23, this year, a landmine destroyed a government bungalow. Bandwan has by now learnt to live with fear, but not vote.

 Lakshmi Singh of Khantgora said no leader of any party has come to the village yet. No one had come before the 2004 general elections either. We are all too scared to vote, she added. 

 There was campaigning in the village in the run-up to the 2001 Assembly polls. The Maoists had not grown roots in Bandwan then.

 Many in neighbouring Dulukdihi are not even aware of the election date. They dont want to be seen voting either. None of the candidates has campaigned yet. Their names have not been written on the walls. Whatever little we are getting to know is through the radio, said Rupchand Singh, an agricultural labourer, who apparently is not aware of the government ban on graffiti.

 As the candidates for the April 17 polls in Purulia drew up campaign itinerary carefully avoiding the CPI (Maoist) strongholds, the government said CPM leaders in two other districts ? Bankura and West Midnapore ? have refused police escort. The reason, once again being Maoists.

 They apprehend that the Maoists might target them more if they take police help. The administration is keeping watch on the developments, home secretary Prasad Ranjan Ray said at Writers Buildings this afternoon.

 He reviewed the functioning of the special operations group, set up to combat Naxalites in the three districts at a meeting with director-general of police S.C. Avasthy. 

 Maoists are still very active there despite intensive and regular raids, Ray said.

 The government will place a report on steps taken to curb the menace at a meeting with Union home minister Shivraj Patil on March 31.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Out of wedlock, baby killed

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Nov. 25: The newborn whose body was found wrapped in a blood-stained cloth in the Regent Park area yesterday was killed by the father because he was an illegitimate child, police said today.

 Samir Karmakar, a local youth, and his girlfriends elder sister, who helped him dispose of the baby, were arrested today.

 The baby was packed into a plastic packet and suffocated to death, the police said. Residents of Sonali Park saw stray dogs tossing around a plastic bag last evening. When they came closer, they saw blood oozing from it and then the body.

 The police said Samir had an affair with a woman of the same locality. She became pregnant early this year and pleaded with Samir repeatedly to marry her but he refused, South 24-Parganas superintendent of police S.N. Gupta said. 

 Samir, who works in a jewellery shop, and Anjali, a nurse, allegedly hatched the conspiracy. An officer said: They took the girl to a nearby healthcare unit where she gave birth. But the duo told her that it was a stillborn baby.

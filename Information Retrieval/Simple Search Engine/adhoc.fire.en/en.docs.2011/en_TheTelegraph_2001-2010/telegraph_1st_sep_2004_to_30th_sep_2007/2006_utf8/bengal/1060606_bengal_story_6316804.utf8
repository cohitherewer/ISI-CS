The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Land law change

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, June 5: The government will amend a law to raise the compensation to be paid to share-croppers, land and land reforms minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah said today. 

 Under the new law, the damages payable would be to the tune of 50 per cent of the market price of the land acquired. Share-croppers now get only six times the amount their produce fetches in a year.

 The compensation for share-croppers is politically sensitive for the CPM and its allies as it is still not clear whether they would receive a share of the compensation to be received by the land owners. 

 Mollah today said: They would receive compensation separately from the land developers, be it a government agency or a private company. 

 Industries minister Nirupam Sen had earlier indicated to the CPMs peasant leaders that land owners should share their compensation. 

 However, both have turned down the demand for compensation for unregistered share-croppers or funds for resettling farmers living above the poverty line.

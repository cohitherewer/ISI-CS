The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Winner of Rs 17 crore sends envoy

 ZEESHAN JAWED

 Calcutta, May 27: The veil shrouding the winner of the Rs 17-crore Sikkim Super Lotto jackpot, the biggest ever in India, refused to lift today. 

 A person claiming to be a relative of the winner walked into the Playwin office on Ho Chi Minh Sarani this morning and produced the photocopy of the ticket. He left with the promise to come back with the winner very soon. 

 The company then discovered that the winning ticket ? worth Rs 17,29,15,375 ? had been validated at a terminal in Lokenath Stores, Kankurgachhi, on Friday. The winner, they believe, is a Kankurgachhi resident. 

 Weve heaved a sigh of relief. Now we know that somebody will claim the money. The gentleman who came to us wanted to understand the procedure for doing so. He said the winner would be present when the actual claim is made, said Playwins eastern region head Aniruddha Basu.

 When The Telegraph contacted the man who visited the Playwin office, he said: The person who has won came to know about the jackpot yesterday when he was passing by Shree Krishna Communication on 1 Hidaram Banerjee Lane off College Street, from where he had bought the ticket. He saw that he had hit the jackpot and quietly moved away. 

 Then he entrusted me with the job of completing the procedure so that he gets his prize money. I cannot divulge anything else. I do not want that person to feel betrayed. 

 To claim the prize, the winner has to validate the ticket by signing on it and getting it punched at a Playwin terminal. A slip pops out of the machine directing the winner how to claim the money.

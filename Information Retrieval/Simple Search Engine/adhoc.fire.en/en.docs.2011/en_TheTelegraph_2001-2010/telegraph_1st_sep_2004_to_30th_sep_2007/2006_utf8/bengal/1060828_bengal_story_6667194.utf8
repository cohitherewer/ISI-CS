 Dead on bus seat, toddler 

in arms 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Midnapore, 

 Aug. 27: A lady clutching a toddler was found dead 

 on her bus seat at Contai bus terminus early this morning.

 The one-and-a-half-year-old boy clung to his mothers breast as she sat on the bus from Paradip. 

 When the woman, around 35, did not get off even after being called several times, the conductor shook her shoulder, but was stunned to see her slide down the seat. The babys body was burning with fever. As other passengers had left long back, he raised an alarm. 

 The driver scrambled to the wheel and drove the empty bus to Contai hospital, where the lady was declared dead on arrival.

 The woman was pro-nounced dead at the hospital, while the baby, who was running a temperature, was admitted for treatment. The womans attire and appearance suggested that she belonged to a respectable family, said Pravat Sarkar, the officer-in-charge of the Contai police station, about 180 km from Calcutta. 

 According to U.K. Jana, the doctor who attended to the mother and child, the woman had died a few hours before she was brought in. 

 In all probability, she died of a sudden stroke. We will conduct a post-mortem as the police have registered a case of unnatural death, Jana added.

 Recounting the events, conductor Gouri Shi said the bus left Paradip around 9 pm on Saturday and reached Contai at 6.30 this morning, a little late because of bad weather on the way. 

 We thought she was feeding the baby and did not disturb her, but when she did not budge even an hour later, we went close, shook her and realised that she was dead, said Shi.

 As soon as she slumped to the floor, the baby started bawling. Although the lady was sitting in the drivers cabin, no one realised when she died. We rushed her to the hospital believing that she had a faint of chance of survival, but the doctors declared her dead, Shi added.

 Sarkar said a Khehuri phone number was found scribbled on a piece of paper in a bag the woman was carrying, but the man who answered the phone claimed he knew nothing about her. 

 However, we have asked the man to come to us. She may have gone to a relative in Paradip, Sarkar said. 

 In the hunt for clues, Jana is anxious about the babys fate. What will happen to the boy. Who will look after him? he asks.

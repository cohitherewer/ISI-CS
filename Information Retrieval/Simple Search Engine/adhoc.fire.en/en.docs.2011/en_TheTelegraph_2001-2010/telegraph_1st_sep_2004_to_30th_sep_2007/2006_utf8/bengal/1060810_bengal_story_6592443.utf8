The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Term set for poll machines

 ANINDYA SENGUPTA

 Calcutta, Aug. 9: The Election Commission has told the state poll panel that electronic voting machines (EVMs) would not be loaned for local body elections unless it buys at least a fourth of the required number in three years.

 The commissions directive states that the precondition for loaning EVMs is that at least 25 per cent of the machines will have to be procured by 2009.

 The missive has landed the state body in a spot as a huge amount will have to be coughed up for the purchase.

 The state commission, which has some 5,000 voting machines, would require about 60,000 of them for the 2008 panchayat polls 50,000 for voting and another 10,000 as reserve. 

 A single machine costs about Rs 12,000. Because the state body already has 5,000 machines, it has to buy 10,000 more to fulfil the commissions precondition. The expenditure will amount to around Rs 12 crore.

 To make things easier for the state body, the commission has suggested phased procurement of the voting machines. If it is not possible to buy all at one go, 10 per cent might be purchased by March 31, 2007, and the rest by March 31, 2008.

 State election commissioner Ashok Gupta said: Efforts are on to build an EVM reserve. But the question is whether well be able to arrange the funds. We will approach the government for the money.

 State officials are now busy figuring out the exact number of machines to be required for the panchayat polls, said S.N. Roychowdhury, the state election commission secretary.

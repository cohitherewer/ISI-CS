The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Now, Nadia on hit list

 RABI BANERJEE

 Krishnagar, July 20: Police have put Nadia on the Maoist map of Bengal and decided to step up vigilance on the lines of Purulia, Bankura and West Midnapore.

 The move follows the killing of two CPM tribal leaders, Uttam Sardar and Swapan Sardar, on June 20 by a group of rebels at Chandpur in Nadia, 120 km from Calcutta.

 The government has decided to set up a police station and six outposts in the district.

 The attack on the CPM duo is the first outside the three Maoist strongholds ? Purulia, Bankura and West Midnapore. The guerrillas have also threatened at least a dozen CPM leaders in Nadia. 

 We have reasons to believe that there might be more such strikes in the future as the Maoists have made inroads into Nadia. Areas where Maoists are active in the district are Phasilnagar and Nasirpur villages in Karimpur, Teghari, Badbillo and Durgapur villages in Nakashipara and parts of Chapra and Kotwali police station areas, an officer said.

 If we dont act now, the Maoists could pose a bigger problem for us in future.

 Last week, Nadia police had sent a proposal to the government for more police stations and outposts in the Maoist-hit areas.

 Nadia superintendent of police R. Rajsekharan said the government has sanctioned a police station in Bhimpur that will help keep a close watch on neighbouring Chandpur and Asannagar. 

 As Chandpur ? now covered by Kotwali police station ? is a remote rural area, we have decided to build a new police station there. The government approved our proposal and we are trying to build it as soon as possible. We will also set up six outposts in Karimpur, Chapra and Nakashipara police station areas, the SP said.

 Police take veil off job fraud

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Aug. 26: A scuffle near New Market a few days ago led police to uncover a job racket that has duped hundreds of youths over the last year. 

 Two persons named Sanjay Gupta and Jitendra Singh were caught fighting outside a cinema hall. New Market police took them into custody.

 During interrogation, Gupta told the police that he had paid Rs 70,000 to Singh in May after he promised him a job in the railways. When Singh refused to give me the appointment letter and sought more money, I called him to New Market, Gupta reportedly said.

 Investigations revealed youths were lured with the false promise of jobs in central government organisations, including the railways and the Food Corporation of India, for huge sums of money. 

 Apart from Singh, three others have been arrested, and considering the number of complaints pouring in, the police believe the amount collected by the racketeers could well run into a few crores.

 The main accused is still absconding. We are trying to dig deep into the racket and find out the extent of the fraud. Things are at a preliminary stage and we need to probe further to get details, said Ajay Ranade, the deputy commissioner of police (central).

 Singh, who hails from Jharkhand led the police to his gang members Nand Kishore Srivastava, Bipin Kumar Srivastava and Yogesh Dubey. 

 The alleged kingpin of the racket, Jagat Narayan Srivastava, had been operating from his sprawling house in Naihati for the last few years, the police said.

 Their modus operandi was to call the youths for training at Rampurhat in Birbhum by former railway employees, including Travelling Ticket Examiners. 

 Apart from cellphones, the police found eight fake notes of Rs 1,000 denomination on Singh.

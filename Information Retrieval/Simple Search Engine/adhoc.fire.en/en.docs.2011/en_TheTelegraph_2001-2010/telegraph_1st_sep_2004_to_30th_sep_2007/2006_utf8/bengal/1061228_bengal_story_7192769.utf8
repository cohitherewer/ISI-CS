The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Scribe beaten

 Calcutta, Dec. 27: Anindya Sengupta, special correspondent with The Telegraph, was beaten up last night by a gang of men on Chittaranjan Avenue while he was returning to office after covering Mamatas dharna.

 They hurled abuses, which were political in nature, and slapped and punched him. They also snatched his wallet. Anindya received injuries on his hands and face.

 On December 20, while trying to protect a lady reporter of a local TV channel from the wrath of Mamatas supporters, Anindya was repeatedly abused and assaulted by those gathered around the Esplanade manch.

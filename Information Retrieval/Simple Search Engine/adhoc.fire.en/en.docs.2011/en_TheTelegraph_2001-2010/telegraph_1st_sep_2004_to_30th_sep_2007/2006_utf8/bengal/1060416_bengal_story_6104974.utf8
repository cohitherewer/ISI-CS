The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Witnesses complain against threat calls

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 15: Two key witnesses in the murder of Biswajit Dey, an associate of Gunjan Ghosh who was involved in the Roma Jhawar kidnap case, have complained to police about threat calls in the past week.

 The unidentified caller apparently warned Rajiv Sarkar and Saumitra Gupta against testifying in a city court on April 20, when the case will come up for hearing.

 The duo had seen some policemen pulling out a revolver, which was allegedly used in the murder, from a ditch off VIP Road on March 9 last year. According to them, one of Gunjans associates, Amitava Saha, was accompanying the cops.

 Sarkar and Gupta have written to deputy commissioner of police, north division, Damayanti Sen and superintendent of police, North 24-Parganas, Praveen Kumar for help. Our family members are also very scared. We are in a fix over whether we should appear in court or not, Sarkar said. 

 Sen tonight said steps would be taken to protect the witnesses. However, I am yet to go through the complaint. 

 Officers of Narkeldanga police station said Gunjan along with his aides Pappu Singh and Amitava had shot Biswajit, also an associate, with the revolver. Amitava, who is out on bail, is often seen in the Baguiati area, where the two witnesses stay, they added.

 Sarkar today recounted the events of March 9. Amitava, with some policemen from Narkeldanga police station, came to Joramandir near VIP Road around 3 pm. He showed the ditch where he had thrown the revolver. The sleuths spotted a bag from which they pulled out the six-chambered revolver along with some other documents.... I and my friend Saumitra were targeted as we were the only witnesses.

 An officer from Narkeldanga police station said the witnesses are vital because if they fail to testify, we will not be able to prove that Gunjan had used the revolver to kill Biswajit. It will also be difficult to prove that Amitava knew about it.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Zinc missing, with a twist

 IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI

 Calcutta, Aug. 20: A truck carrying zinc was hijacked from Howrah last month. Investigating agencies traced the vehicle that was on the way to Hindustan Zincs Kidderpore depot from Visakhapatnam in two weeks, but minus the consignment worth over Rs 35 lakh.

 The security agencies here are concerned not because of the value of the stolen zinc, but because it can be used to make explosives. 

 There has been a spate of such zinc robberies and seiz- ure of illegal consignments from Bangladesh. 

 It is a matter of concern. The consignment can be used for making explosives, especially smoke bombs, a CID officer said. Raids are on. We have alerted all police stations in the districts and intelligence officials, he added. 

 Although sleuths are yet to find any terror link with the Howrah heist and the illegal zinc trade, CID officers stressed that the frequency of such incidents is causing serious concern.

 This is not the first time that a consignment of zinc has gone missing. About nine months ago, a consignment was hijacked near Petrapole (on the Bangladesh border in North 24-Parganas). It could all be the handiwork of one gang, said Mahabir Prasad Sarawgi, president, Transport Corporation of India, which owned the truck that went missing in Howrah. 

 According to him, 15 to 20 truckloads of zinc arrive at Hindustan Zincs Kidderpore depot from Vizag every month. 

 Information available with the Border Security Force (BSF), too, indicates that zinc has become a sought-after metal in the past few months and there have been several attempts to push it into India illegally. 

 In January, a wagon full of powdered zinc was seized from a Bangladeshi goods train near Benapole (on the other side of Petrapole). 

 In February, the BSF seized nearly 600 bags of powdered zinc stuffed in used cement bags from a goods train that arrived at Petrapole station from Benapole. 

 We had arrested five Bangladeshi nationals in connection with the illegal zinc trade. All of them were also involved in fake currency rackets. They were handed over to the CID for further interrogation, a BSF officer said. 

 The CID said the investigation is in progress.

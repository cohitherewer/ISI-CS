 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, Jan. 6: The high court today asked the state electricity board to pay an interim compensation of Rs 30,000 to Alamgir Sheikh, a five-year-old boy who lost his right arm after a supply post fell on him. 

 Justice J. Biswas will decide on the final amount of damages six weeks later.

 Haringhata: Dacoits raided a state power board office here in Nadia, about 55 km from Calcutta, and looted Rs 8 lakh on Thursday night. Police said the dacoits overpowered and gagged the office guard. A part of the loot was supposed to be paid as employees salary while the rest was dues deposited by consumers.

 Krishnagar: Police have launched a hunt for Gopal Haldar and Debu Haldar, who allegedly lured away 35 tribal youths to Uttaranchal from Shantipur. The 35 had apparently been handed over to a racket that sold them as slaves. Six of them fled the place and reached Shantipur, 70 km from Calcutta, on Thursday night.

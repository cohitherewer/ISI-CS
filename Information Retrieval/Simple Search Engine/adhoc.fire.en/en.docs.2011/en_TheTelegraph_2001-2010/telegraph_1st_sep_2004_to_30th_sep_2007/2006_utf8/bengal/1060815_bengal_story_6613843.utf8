The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Cola support amp; split

 OUR BUREAU

 Aug. 14: The CPM central leadership is backing Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees decision not to ban Pepsi and Coca-Cola in his state till he gets word from Delhi.

 As chief minister, it is his responsibility to get FDI for his state, CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury told a news conference in Delhi today.

 It is not an ideological fight here. The demand is to set standards for permissible levels of pesticides in soft drinks. The Joint Parliamentary Committee should set up universal norms. That is our concern, he said. 

 In Calcutta, however, the CPI struck a discordant note, saying it would stick to its demand for a ban on the cola twins in Bengal.

 We are in favour of implementing the ban as it has been done by the Left Front government in Kerala. We think the Bengal government can act independently like our Kerala comrades without waiting for the Centre to take a decision, CPI state secretary Manju Mazumdar said. 

 The party has decided to raise the matter at Wednesdays Left Front meeting. 

 However, two other Front partners, the RSP and the Forward Bloc, were reluctant to discuss the thorny issue. Bloc leader H.A. Sairani said his party would like to wait for the test reports of the cola samples.

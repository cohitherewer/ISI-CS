 Garbage dump protest

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 15: Unable to bear the stench from an illegal garbage dump, residents of ward number 20 of the Rajarhat municipality prevented unloading of waste at a site in Narayantala.

 Municipal workers collect garbage from localities around Narayantala, about 6 km from here, and unload it at the vacant plot. Trucks carry away the waste to the Mathpukur dumping ground.

 This is a residential area and dumping garbage here is unhygienic. The municipality is illegally using this plot as a dumping ground. We wont let them pollute our neighbourhood, said Asit Chatterjee, whose house is located near the dumping site.

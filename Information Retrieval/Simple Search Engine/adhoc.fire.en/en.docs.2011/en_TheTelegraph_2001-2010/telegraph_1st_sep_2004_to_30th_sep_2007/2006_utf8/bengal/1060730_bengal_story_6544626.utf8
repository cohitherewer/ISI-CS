The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Dead? Families still cant believe

 OUR BUREAU

 Friends and relatives outside Swatis house

 July 29: The telephone receiver dropped from Shankar Sahas hand. The caller, his sons roommate in a Calcutta mess, had said Subhankar was dead. It was 9.30 am. 

 His body has been found, Gour Gopal Pandit told Saha, the head clerk of Dinhata court in Cooch Behar.

 Weve lost everything, the father said later. 

 Subhankar had come home only last June. He called on Wednesday and said he was going to Digha. He didnt say anything about a trekking expedition, Saha said.

 At the Sahapally Road house, Subhankars mother Madhuri and sister Mousumi fainted several times. 

 Last night we heard Baptu (Subhankars nickname) and four others were missing. But we never thought he could be dead, said Debabrata Saha, his uncle. 

 Another uncle, Alok Saha, headed to Purulia today to bring back Subhankars body.

 At Kalinath Ghoshal Road in Ariadaha, the call came from Bagmundi police station. The officer wanted someone from Sanyasi Charan Dass family to identify a body that could be Swatis. That was around 2 pm.

 She had often gone trek- king to this place. But this time we had tried to dissuade her because of the rain. If only she had listened to us, Das, a BSNL officer, said, his voice failing. 

 Trained in a local club, she had been part of several expeditions since Class IX. We still cannot believe it, said mother Runu. 

 Some of the Dases relatives and neighbours left for Bagmundi tonight to bring back the body. It had been confirmed by then that it was Swatis. Her brother, an engineer in the US, has been informed. 

 Arundhati Ghoshs family in Garbeta, East Midnapore, swung between hope and despair through most of the day. 

 Whenever we are calling police, we are being told that they are busy probing the incident. There is no trace of my sister. We hope she is OK, her cousin Sandip Ghosh said.

 Schoolteacher Subhash Ghoshs daughter was home only 10 days ago. She would have come again in September. 

 Our relatives have left for Bagmundi. They havent had any good news yet, Sandip said.

 The parents of Bappaditya Chatterjee and Kaushik Sarkhel are also anxious. 

 When we told him not to go, he said Swati was an expert and we need not worry, said retired government employee Tarak Nath Chatterjee. 

 Around 2 pm, Bappaditya called his parents at his Kalyani home to say he was safe. But you can understand what we are going through, said Chatterjee, who underwent a bypass surgery recently.

 Kamal Sarkhel suffered convulsions at Garia. He has high blood pressure, but wants to rush there. It is difficult to stop him, said Kaushiks mother Mitali.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Now, hunt for rebels friends

 OUR BUREAU

 Dec. 17: Unable to identify the Maoists killed in an encounter with CRPF jawans at Bogdoba village in Bankura on Friday night, police are planning to move court for permission to bring rebels from jails to see if they recognised the duo.

 Three days have passed but we are yet to make any headway. As a last resort, we may have to approach the court to allow us to bring Naxalites from jail to identify the bodies, Bankura superintendent of police Rajesh Kumar Singh said.

 Singh said 15 people, including some former Naxalites and their associates, were brought today for the identification but in vain. Until we identify the bodies, we will not be able to speed up the probe, he added. 

 IG, prisons, B.D. Sharma said in Calcutta he had no problem sending the rebels for the identification but security will be a problem. 

 Some 70 Maoists looking for a CPM leader were engaged in a gun battle with the paramilitary, resulting in the death of two rebels and a jawan. After the encounter, the Maoists apparently fled to Jharkhand carrying two others who were injured. From the blood trail, we have come to know that they first went to Bandwan in Purulia and from there to Jharkhand, said IG, western zone, Arun Gupta.

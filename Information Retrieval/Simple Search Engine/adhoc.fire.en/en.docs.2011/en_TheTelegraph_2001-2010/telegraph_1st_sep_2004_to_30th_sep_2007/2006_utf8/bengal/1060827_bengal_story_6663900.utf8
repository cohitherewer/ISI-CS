The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Spurned, man stabs in-laws

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 26: A man plunged a kitchen knife into his in-laws last night when they refused to let him take their daughter home.

 Soumen De, a resident of Belgharia on the citys northern fringes, also assaulted a neighbour who came to the couples rescue.

 Rabindranath Sarkar and Monica Sarkar both are in their 50s are battling for life in the state-run Sagar Dutta Hospital. Police have arrested Soumen on the charge of attempt to murder. 

 Superintendent of police Praveen Kumar said Soumen, who is in his early 30s, married 24-year-old Urmistha a few months ago. 

 For the first few weeks, everything was fine, Kumar said. But soon, the bliss gave way to regular bickerings. 

 Soumen, who works as a tout for a real estate firm, was struggling to make ends meet. Frustrated with their financial troubles, Urmistha decided to go and stay with her parents, whose house is in the same neighbourhood. 

 She has been living with her parents for the last four months, said an officer of Belgharia police station.

 During interrogation, Soumen told the police that the couple had not met even once since Urmistha left. I decided to bring her back and went to my in-laws house. I told them to let me take my wife home, but they refused, he said.

 When Urmistha, too, told him to go away, a murderous rage swept Soumen.

 He ran to the kitchen and got a knife. Rabindranath saw his son-in-law lunging towards him, said an officer. Soumen pounced on him and stabbed him on his chest and abdomen several times. As Rabindranath slumped to the floor, he attacked Monica in the same manner. 

 On hearing their cries, Bapi, who lives next door, rushed to the house. He saw Soumen clutching a blood-stained knife. When he tried to hold Soumen back, he was punched and pushed away.

 A bruised Bapi was taken to a nearby hospital. He has been released.

 Soumen was caught when other neighbours went there and pinned him down. After sending Rabindranath and Monica to hospital, they called the police.

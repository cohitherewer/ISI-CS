The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, Feb. 12: Three women died when a Maruti Van overturned and rolled into a ditch metres away from Science City.

 Tripti Desai, Versha Parekh and Reshmi Mehta were residents of Bhowanipore. Reshmis husband Rajesh, who was driving, is in hospital. Five people had died when a Sumo overturned almost at the same spot off EM Bypass on Saturday.

 Calcutta: No new employment-generating scheme can be implemented once the election dates are announced. Although the government is duty-bound to provide employment for at least 100 days to a person in rural areas, the poll panel prohibits that, the chief electoral officer said on Sunday.

 Calcutta: The government wants the National Highway Authority of India to test the stretch of National Highway 6 (Bombay Road) between Kharagpur and Dankuni to determine its stability. The road caved in near Bally on Wednesday. A crack has also developed in a 200-metre stretch nearby. Is there any guarantee that no other portion will collapse? PWD minister asked. The entire stretch was built by the same contractor.

 Robbed cops face axe

 OUR BUREAU

 Feb. 14: Two policemen were suspended today for failing to put up a resistance against Maoist guerrillas who raided the Kantadih camp in Purulia last evening. 

 There were four National Volunteer Force cadets on duty who have also been withdrawn for the same reason. 

 Weve suspended the constables and withdrawn the cadets who were on duty last evening, Midnapore range deputy inspector-general of police Gangeswar Prasad Singh said.

 Around 25 extremists raided the camp about 386 km from Calcutta and took away five rifles, three muskets and ammunition after beating up the personnel. 

 The police today removed all rifles, carbines and muskets from four camps at Chakaltore, Tamna, Suklara and Kuspar on the outskirts of Purulia town fearing more strikes.

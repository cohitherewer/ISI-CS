The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Jobless, champ hangs herself

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, April 5: A woman who had quit studies after school to pursue Indias national sport as profession committed suicide last night unable to cope with poverty even after being part of a champion side.

 Jhumur Biswas, who had represented Bengal in kabaddi until last year, hanged herself from the ceiling in her house at Ghugia village in Chakdah, Nadia, 70 km from Calcutta.

 The 31-year-old had desperately wanted a government job but she only got assurances. There were times she was told she would get a job in the railways but nothing came her way. She was very depressed and would often not resp-ond to our pleas to continue kabaddi, which she loved to play, said her mother Padmini. 

 Last night, she did not eat her dinner and went to her room asking her parents not to disturb her because she wanted to sleep. 

 The last time Jhumurs parents saw her alive was when she shut the door of the small room in their thatched house, stacked with medals and trophies. 

 When repeated calls and knocks failed to evoke any response this morning, her father Tarak broke open the door and found her hanging at the end of her dupatta. 

 Tarak, a night guard in a village mart, earns Rs 700 a month. He said: Jhumur wanted to be a good kabaddi player. 

 She used to cry in front of me and talk about ways to overcome our poverty. I told her we can live a better life only if you begin to earn. Jhumur was the last hope for my family.

 Tarak has three daughters. Jhumur, like elder sister Mamata, was unmarried. Their eldest sister was married four years ago. 

 After finishing Madhyamik, Jhumur took up kabaddi full time. 

 In the same year, she first participated in the national kabaddi meet in Hyderabad. 

 We won the trophy that year for Bengal. Jhumur performed excellently. She represented Bengal till last year. Her financial condition did not improve because she played kabaddi and not cricket or tennis, said Soma De, her friend and co-member of the Bengal team, also a resident of Chakdah.

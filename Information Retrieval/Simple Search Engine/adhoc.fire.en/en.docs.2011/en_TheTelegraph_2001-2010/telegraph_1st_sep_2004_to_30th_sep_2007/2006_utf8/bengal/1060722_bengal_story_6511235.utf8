 Civic duties amp; deadlines on public display 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, July 21: Every municipality in the state will publish a citizens charter detailing services being offered and the time it should take in providing them.

 Moving a municipal amendment bill in the Assembly today, municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya said the system is being put in place to make civic bodies accountable to the people. 

 The citizens charter would force municipalities to offer services within the specified period. Promises wont do. Failure to keep assurances would mean disciplinary action, Bhattacharya said.

 Besides the nature of civic services and the delivery deadlines, the charters will carry information on the availability of licences and certificates. 

 Some municipalities have already framed regulations to make public the nature of services they provide. Todays bill is a step forward, the minister said.

 Two days ago, the land and land revenue minister had announced a similar initiative. Revenue inspector, block land revenue and subdivisional offices would also display charters and names of officers with whom complaints may be lodged in case of delay or a demand for a bribe.

 According to the municipal bill, services shall include maintenance of roads, open spaces, parks, recreation grounds and playgrounds, supply of water and electricity, street lighting, sewers and drainage. 

 Officials would be entrusted with the task of overseeing the implementation of civic assurances. 

 The minister moved another amendment bill pertaining to elections. The new stipulation says a person will not be allowed to continue as a councillor of two wards and will have to resign from one within two months of the first meeting of the board of councillors.

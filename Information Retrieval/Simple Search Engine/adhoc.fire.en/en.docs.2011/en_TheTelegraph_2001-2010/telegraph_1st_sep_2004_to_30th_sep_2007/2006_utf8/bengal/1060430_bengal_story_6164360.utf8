The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 BRIEFS

 Kuli (Murshidabad): Annoyed by Sonia Gandhis barb at the Left Front government for the sorry state of Bengal, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said on Saturday he was saddened by the sorry state of affairs in the Congress. 

 The Congress president said she was at pains to see Bengal lagging in all respects during the Left rule. But I take pity on Sonia Gandhi.... Gone are the days when Congress was in power in almost all states. Now it survives on our support, the chief minister told a rally here, about 250 km from Calcutta.

 Krishnagar: On national highway 34, it was a scene out of a Hollywood rib-tickler on Saturday morning. The CMs convoy was heading to Murshidabad when the driver of the first car slammed the brakes to save a cyclist. Six cars following it then bumped into each other. Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees car was unharmed and none of the collisions was big.

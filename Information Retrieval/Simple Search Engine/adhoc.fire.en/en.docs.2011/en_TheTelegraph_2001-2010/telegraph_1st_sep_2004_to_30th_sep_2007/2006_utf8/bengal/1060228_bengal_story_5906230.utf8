The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Students vote for elections

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Feb. 27: Cutting across political differences, all major students unions in the state today urged a panel formed to assess the need for polls to student bodies that higher education institutions should be allowed to hold campus elections. 

 The seven-member committee headed by former chief election commissioner J.M. Lyngdoh is here for two days to interact with student leaders, teachers, heads of colleges and universities and academics to take their views on students union elections.

 The Union human resource development ministry had formed the committee following a Supreme Court directive. The court will strive to frame guidelines to regulate all students union elections on the basis of its report.

 The guidelines will focus on ridding campus elections of muscle and money power, deciding the funding procedures and ceiling on expenses and qualification and disqualification of candidates. 

 It will also decide whether students with political affiliations should be disqualified. 

 SFI, Chhatra Parishad and Trinamul Chhatra Parishad leaders today made it clear to Lyngdoh that they were against the proposal to bar politically-affiliated bodies from contesting. Students should be allowed to set up their unions through a democratic process, SFIs Koustav Chatterjee told Lyngdoh.

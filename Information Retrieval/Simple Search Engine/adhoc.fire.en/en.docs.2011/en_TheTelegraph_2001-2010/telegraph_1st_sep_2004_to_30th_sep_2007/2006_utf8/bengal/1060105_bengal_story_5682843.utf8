 Purulia, Jan. 4: Left Front chairman Biman Bose today spewed venom at Mamata Banerjee, accusing her of encouraging Maoists to eliminate CPM functionaries.

 Bose, who visited the charred house of Rabindranath Kar at Bhomragarh where the Purulia secretariat member and his wife Anandamoyee were burnt alive on Saturday by Maoist guerrillas, alleged that the Trinamul Congress chief was openly asking the rebels to target CPM activists.

 A few days back, she came to Jhilimil and held a meeting with her party workers where she urged them to eliminate our functionaries. The murders are a fallout of the call. It has been proved on past occasions that her Trinamul Congress supports the Maoists, Bose, a member of the CPM politburo, said.

 On Sunday, CPM state secretary Anil Biswas had pointed to the nexus between the Naxalites and the Trinamul. The Maoists who attacked Kars house had left behind posters saying the torching was in revenge of the Chhoto Angaria massacre in which 11 Trinamul supporters were allegedly killed by CPM cadre. Mamata, however, rubbished the charge.

 We will have to counter the Maoists bloody politics of murder. If necessary, we will do what we did in 1971 to resist the Naxalites politics of annihilation, Bose said today.

 Escorted by police, the CPM leader, along with party colleagues Rabin Deb, Nakul Mahato and others, arrived at Bhomragarh in Bandwan around 11.30 this morning. 

 Bose held a marathon meeting with the CPMs district committee. According to party insiders, most leaders, especially those belonging to the Bandwan zonal committee, went hammer and tongs at the police. If the police fail to protect our senior leaders like Kar, the grassroots workers will be demoralised. The situation has come to such that no villager is willing to join any rally organised by the party, a district committee member told Bose at the meeting.

 The Maoists are using sophisticated arms and ammunition. How can we resist them with empty hands? If such things continue, we may have to lose many of our leaders and workers, another leader added.

 A large section of party leaders in the district is in favour of tough retaliation. They say bullet against bullet is the best strategy to combat the Maoists .

 Bose, however, urged the district leadership to stay calm and not take any provocative measures.

 Pichkurir Dhal, Dec. 17: For once, passengers are more concerned about ticket-less travelling than the railways.

 At the small station here in Burdwan, it is impossible to miss the posters pleading passengers to buy tickets and a loudspeaker blaring its benefits none of it the handiwork of the authorities.

 Following reports that Pichkurir Dhal station might be shut down if it failed to generate more revenues, daily passengers have launched a campaign here, 39 km from Burdwan town, urging passengers to buy tickets.

 About 145 km from Calcutta, the station in the Bolpur section was set up 30 years ago. For people from at least 14 villages it is the best way to reach Burdwan, Bolpur or Calcutta, where many go to work. 

 On an average, about 300 passengers use the station every day. In the absence of the station, they will have to travel by bus to Guskara or Bhedia, some 10 km away, to catch a train.

 Some of the residents have also taken it upon themselves to ensure that no passenger skipped the small queue in front of the ticket counter.

 The campaign was launched in late August by Sadananda Dutta, a 55-year-old primary school teacher, who first learnt from people he knew in the railways that the station was running at a loss and would be closed down.

 The railways confirmed that Pichkurir Dhal is among the blacklisted stations. The performance of stations running at a loss is reviewed periodically. Pichkurir Dhal is one such. Last year, we had to close down a few of them, said the suburban railway manager of Howrah division, J.N. Lal. 

 A review committee will decide the fate of Pichkurir Dhal. 

 Following reports that the station was under review, the schoolteacher called a passengers meeting. With some like-minded people, I tried to impress upon them that it is our responsibility to increase revenue, Dutta said. 

 A forum was launched to steer the buy-tickets-please campaign.

 Daily passengers have been asked to buy monthly tickets. Well keep watch for some time and hang a list of those who did not do so. Everyone will buy tickets to avoid embarrassment, Dutta said.

 Stationmaster Samiran Achariya said: Our daily earning used to be very poor only about Rs 600 a day. Since the passengers launched their campaign, ticket sales have gone up manifold. Pichkurir Dhal now earns about Rs 3,000 a day on an average.

 Doya korey ticket ketey trainey chorun. Naholey ei station are thakbe na. Ticket katun station bachan (Please buy tickets or this station will cease to exist. Buy tickets, save the station). The plea appears to have worked.

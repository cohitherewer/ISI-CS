The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Siege of school to cast away evil spells

 - Officials 

 step in after last years encore 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Dec. 10: A school that was closed for a week exactly a year ago to allow villagers to sing devotional songs on the premises has shut down again despite the authorities insistence last time that there wont be a repeat.

 The villagers body that has been organising the yearly kirtan session at Muktarpur Primary School over the past decade disregarded the headmasters refusal to allow the programme this year and forcibly occupied the compound last Saturday.

 Even before that, about 1,000 villagers had descended on the school in Nadias Karimpur, 200 km from Calcutta, and fitted loudspeakers along its perimeter. 

 Over the past week, some 150 students came to the school, responded to the roll call and returned home.

 Headmaster Prabhat Biswas pleaded helplessness. The organisers threatened me with social boycott if I didnt allow them to hold the kirtan. I had asked them not to operate loudspeakers during school hours (11 am to 4 pm). But they did not pay heed. Please tell me what to do. 

 The district primary school council chairman had told him what to do: file an FIR. 

 The headmaster was too scared to do so.

 The council then referred the case to the district magistrate, who cracked the whip. 

 Block development officer Swapan Kundu went to the school with police yesterday, seized the loudspeakers and asked the villagers to vacate the premises. 

 Classes should resume tomorrow, district magistrate .S. Meena said today.

 Utpal Sarkar, the president of the committee organising the kirtan, said it was held every year to ward off evil forces. If we dont hold it every year, evil forces will cast their spell on villagers. We hold the kirtan in the school so that the children benefit from attending it, he said. 

 Last year, the headmaster had given permission for the kirtan. Subsequently, he faced a government inquiry as the district primary school council slapped a show-cause notice on him. He was let off with a warning after he apologised. 

 The kirtan, planned to last a fortnight was cut short midway.

 Yesterday, guardians lodged a complaint with district primary school council chairman Bibhas Biswas and he served another showcause on the headmaster.

 The headmaster would in all likelihood be let off with a warning again like the villagers and kirtan organisers. 

 Utpal Sarkar said the kirtan would be held in the school again next year. We are doing it for the villagers good.

 The school council chairman said a high wall would be built around the school to prevent an encore. 

 The DM said: If the kirtan is held there again, the organisers would be arrested.

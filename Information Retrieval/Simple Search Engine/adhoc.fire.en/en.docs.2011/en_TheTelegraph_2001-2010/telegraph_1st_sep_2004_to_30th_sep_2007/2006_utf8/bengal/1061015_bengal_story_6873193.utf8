The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Techie robbed in Salt Lake

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, Oct. 14: A software professional returning from her Sector V office last evening was blinded by the lights of a car that stopped near her mess in Salt Lakes BL block. 

 Before Priyanka Padhi could gather her wits, she was surrounded by five men, one of whom lunged at her bag. 

 She resisted and cried for help, but the goons got the bag. Before speeding away, they pushed the Tata Consultancy Service employee to the ground. 

 Neighbours rushed to the rescue of the girl from Orissa, living here for the past 10 months. Priyanka, in her mid-20s, received four stitches on her head. Her HDFC and SBI cards, the key to her room and money were gone.

 Abhishek Ghosh, a college student, said: I heard a noise and rushed to see her standing with her hand pressed against her head. She was bleeding.

 Bengals showpiece tech town is worried. At 6.30 pm, there are people on the road. Yet, the culprits had the courage to pull off such a heist, said a senior TCS official.

 The residents of the block are no less unhappy. Two such incidents happened here a year ago, said Alok Satsangi. We want police patrolling, especially in the bylanes, said J.C. Ghosh.

 But the authorities are not ringing the alarm bell. Salt Lake is absolutely safe for women. Stray incidents keep happening everywhere, said S.A. Ahmed, the chairman of the Sector V civic body.

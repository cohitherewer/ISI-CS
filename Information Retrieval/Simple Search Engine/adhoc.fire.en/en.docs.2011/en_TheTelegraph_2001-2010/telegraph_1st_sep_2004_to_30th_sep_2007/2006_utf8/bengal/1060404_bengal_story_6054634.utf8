 Bengal to buy water for boro crop

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 3: A crisis looming, the government today said it had decided to buy water from Jharkhand to save the boro crop now being rav- aged by a dry spell.

 Irrigation secretary Sadhan Biswas said Bengal would procure about 1.30 lakh cubic feet of water from Tenughat in Jharkhand. The water from the upper reaches of the Damodar will cost the state over Rs 14 crore.

 When 35,000 cusecs of water from the Ganga are going to Bangladesh every day in accordance with a pact with that country, levels of all major rivers in the state such as the Mayurakshi, Bhagirathi, Roopnarayan and the Kangshabati are going down because rain appears to have deserted Bengal. There has only been about 7 mm of rainfall in south Bengal from November to March.

 The government had last purchased water from Jharkhand in 1999, when it was faced with a similar dry spell. 

 The water crisis, already severe in Purulia, Bankura, Murshidabad, Birbhum, Burdwan and parts of Nadia, might soon extend to Hooghly, the rest of Nadia and North 24- Parganas. 

 The entire boro crop, which is wholly dependent on irrigation and is being cultivated on 14.8 lakh hectares, is in danger. Besides, the whole range of summer fruits and vegetables, mustard, sunflower and cotton will be affected. Cultivation of jute will not be possible unless it rains within the next fortnight, an official said.

 Usually, we get about 100-250 mm rain between February and March, which helps boro farming that begins in January. This year, weve only received 4-10 mm. The crop needs to be watered at least twice a week but the rivers are dry, said agriculture director D. Konar.

 DVC officials today met Konar to discuss the situation. They told us that water would be brought from Jharkhand via the DVC canal and supplied to its command area, he said. 

 DVCs command area includes Burdwan, Hooghly and parts of Bankura.

 The state has received less-than-normal rain for the past three years. Consequently, the ground water couldnt be recharged sufficiently and is depleting fast. Deep tube-wells are getting defunct, said Swadesh Mishra, the chief agricultural meteorologist.

 The extent of damage to the crops is not clear yet. We will know only after the harvesting is done. Paddy harvesting will begin in about 15 days. Not only will the yield be low, the quality will also suffer. In a period of water scarcity, the fruits and vegetables are bound to be undersized and not good to taste, Konar said. 

 So, after the weather, the markets would be on fire.

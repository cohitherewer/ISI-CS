 SFI sticks to Presidency repoll cry

 A STAFF REPORTER

 on the boil: Presidency College

 Calcutta, Jan. 7: The Presidency College campus continued to be on the boil today with the Students Federation of India sticking to its repoll cry. 

 Stung by Wednesdays defeat in the elections to the Presidency College Students Union, the SFI has gone into battle mode.

 Sounding curiously like Mamata Banerjee, the CPM-affiliated union dubbed the polls unfair and rigged after it lost 11 office-bearers posts to the Independent Consolidation-Progressive Democratic Students Federation (IC-PDSF) combine.

 Demanding that the entire panel of office-bearers be scrapped, the SFI yesterday gheraoed the principal of Presidency College and other officials.

 The siege continued till midnight, when the deputy commissioner of Calcutta police (central), Ajay Kumar, arrived on the campus and drove out the protesters. 

 He held a meeting with members of a tribunal that oversees the college elections.

 The IC and the SFI had each won 36 seats of class representatives, but the former went ahead with support from the PDSF, which bagged two seats.

 Out of the 74 class representatives who were to elect the 11 office-bearers yesterday, only 73 had showed up. But the number of votes cast for the assistant general secretary (AGS) was 74 ? the election was tied at 37-37. With an SFI member being suspected of casting two votes, the IC and the PDSF demanded re-election to the post.

 A repoll gave the post to the IC-PDSF and all hell broke loose. The SFI refused to accept the decision and demanded that a fresh round of elections be conducted to all office-bearers posts. 

 We are not going to accept this new panel of office-bearers because they used unfair means to win the election, said SFI leader Neel Abhra Bhowmick.

 The chaos on the campus is expected to continue next week with the SFI in no mood to relent. The SFIs Presidency College unit held meetings through the day to plan its next course of action.

 The IC-PDSF brushed aside its rivals demand, hoping to take charge of the college union soon as the authorities have officially announced the names on the new panel except that of the AGS. 

 It now depends on the decision of the college authorities. We can start functioning as soon as we get the nod from the authorities, Anirban Saha, an IC leader, said. 

 The tension on the campus, however, was palpable with clashes breaking out between members of the SFI and the IC.

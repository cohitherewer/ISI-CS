The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Mamata latches on to Salt Lake

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, Jan. 24: Mamata Banerjee today said the Left Front governments irregularities in allotting plots in Salt Lake would be her principal poll plank.

 The Supreme Court had yesterday issued notices to the government, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, Jyoti Basu and his son Chandan pointing out alleged irregularities in the plot allotment since 1977. 

 The apex court has vindicated our stand that the Left Front government is neck deep in land scams of one kind or the other across Bengal. Now, we shall forcefully highlight them in the run-up to the elections, the Trinamul Congress chief told a media conference this afternoon. 

 We also have documents to prove illegal transaction of land in Curzon Park, Ra- jarhat, Bhangar, Baruipur, Dum Dum, Salop and Haldia. The cat is out of its bag and we want the government to come clean, she said.

 Mamata demanded a white paper on the issue from Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees government. Unless that is done, she will move the peoples court.

 A massive campaign against the land scam will, however begin tomorrow itself.

 Basu tonight discussed the apex courts notice with N.N. Gooptu, the former advocate-general. 

 The former chief minister was, however, not available for comment. 

 Plots in the township were distributed during Basus tenure as chief minister. The notice was also sent to his successor, Bhattacharjee, because he held the urban development portfolio from 1987 to 1992.

 Urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya said at Writers Buildings his department was unaware of the latest development. We havent received any notice. We are not aware of any writ petition pending before the Supreme Court over the Salt Lake land quota. Weve asked our lawyers in Delhi to find out what has happened. Till this morning, they had no idea about the developments.

 A bench headed by Justice Ruma Pal issued the notices on the allegation that in 1977-78, the chief ministers discretionary quota was created by unlawful and confidential executive orders without informing the cabinet.

 The state government scrapped the chief ministers quota in 1999, Bhattacharya said.

 The plots case, he added, last came up for hearing on November 19, 2004, when the Supreme Court admitted the petition against only one person ? retired judge Bhagabati Prosad Banerjee.

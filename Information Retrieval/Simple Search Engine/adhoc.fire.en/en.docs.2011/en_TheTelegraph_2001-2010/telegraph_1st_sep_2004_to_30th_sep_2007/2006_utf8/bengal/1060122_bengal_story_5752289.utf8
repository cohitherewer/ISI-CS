The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, Jan. 21: Mamata Banerjee today shared dais with BJP leader L.K. Advani and said she would not sever ties with the NDA. 

 I am not going to leave either the BJP or the NDA, the Trinamul chief said on the side- lines of a book launch at Birla Sabhaghar. 

 At its plenary session in Hyderabad, the Congress, however, made it clear that it will not tie up with Mamata until she cuts off her BJP links.

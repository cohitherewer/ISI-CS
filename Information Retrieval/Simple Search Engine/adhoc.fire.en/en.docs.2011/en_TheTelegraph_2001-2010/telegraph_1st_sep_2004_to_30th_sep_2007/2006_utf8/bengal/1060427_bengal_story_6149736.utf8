The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Officers taken off poll duty

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 26: The officer-in-charge of Amherst Street police station, Aloke Ghosh, has been barred from election duty tomorrow.

 Chief electoral officer Debashis Sen said the action was taken after deputy election commissioner Anand Kumar gave me the instructions over phone and we, accordingly, conveyed the message.

 Sources said Kumar had received reports that Ghosh was not accepting poll-related complaints from Opposition parties. 

 The axe also fell on a sub-inspector of Sagar police station in South 24-Parganas, who has been taken off election after he was found accompanying a local ruling party leader. The CPMs Sheikh Jalaluddin was allegedly intimidating voters when the two were travelling in a police-requisitioned auto-rickshaw last evening.

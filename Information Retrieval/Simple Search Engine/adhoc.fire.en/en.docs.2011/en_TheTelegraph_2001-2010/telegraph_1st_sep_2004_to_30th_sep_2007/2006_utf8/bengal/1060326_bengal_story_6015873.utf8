The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Two arrested for train death

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 25: Two persons have been arrested in connection with yesterdays dacoity on the Diamond Harbour-Sealdah local train, which left a 12-year-old boy dead.

 As the train slowed down at Kalyanpur station in South 24-Parganas, the gang which had snatched a bag of money from a businessman jumped off. 

 The passengers ? among them was the Class VI student of Sarishas Ramakrishna Mission School ? gave chase and the robbers fired aimlessly in defence. A stray bullet hit the boy, Somnath Majumdar, in the temple.

 According to Nabarun Bhattacharya, superintendent of the Government Railway Police (GRP), the duo was arrested from a hideout near Kalyanpur station. We got a tip-off that the two were hiding in a house near the station. Our officials conducted a raid and arrested them today. They will be produced in court on Monday.

 Bhattacharya, however, refused to divulge the names of the arrested duo for the sake of investigation. 

 He said: They have past criminal records. Although five persons carried out the operation yesterday, they are a gang of eight. We hope to nab the others soon. 

 A South 24-Parganas police officer, however, claimed that they had got the tip-off first, which they passed on to the GRP. He also denied the claim that the duo was part of a larger gang. These two are local criminals. They usually work on contract with several gangs and operate locally as well as in the neighbouring districts, the officer said.

 According to the GRP, the dacoits knew the businessman was carrying Rs 96,000. They had their target set... It seems a person who knew the trader passed on the information to them. We have come to know his identity, an officer said.

 Raids are going to be conducted in and around Mograhat tonight, where the other members of the gang are believed to be hiding, he said.

 The students of Ramkrishna Mission at Sarisha today held a prayer meeting in Somnaths memory.

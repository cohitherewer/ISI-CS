The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Lease of life for rickshaw

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, July 20: The move to ban hand-pulled rickshaws in Calcutta, initiated by chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, has been put on hold.

 Moments after the Calcutta Hackney-Carriage (Amendment) Bill, 2006, which seeks to enforce the ban, was tabled in the Assembly today, it was referred to a select committee for further discussion.

 There is little chance of the bill ? contested by sections within the ruling Left Front as well as the Opposition ? being passed in this session of the Assembly.

 The chief minister later told reporters that he would ensure that the House approves the piece of legislation in the next session. The plying of hand-pulled rickshaws has to be stopped. Since the Opposition wanted more time for discussion, I have relented for now. But it will be passed in the next session, he asserted.

 Speaker H.A. Halim said the bill has been referred to the select committee in an attempt to reach a consensus on the issue. The Geneva convention speaks against man-drawn rickshaws. But many are opposed to the ban, as it will affect the livelihood of the rickshaw-pullers, mostly poor migrants from UP and Bihar.

 The bill stresses the need to eradicate the inhuman practice of plying man-drawn rickshaws and man-carried palanquins and to ease... traffic congestion caused by such slow-moving vehicles.

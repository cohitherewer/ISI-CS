The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Report rings stress alarm in BSF ranks

 SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE

 OVERWORKED?

 Calcutta, Aug. 13: An internal report tabled at the Border Security Force headquarters here has revealed that psychological problems could have driven as many as 30 jawans to death since February last year.

 Due to lack of proper man management, cruel attitude of senior officers and the number of psychiatric patients, suicide and shootout cases are increasing (in the force), the report said.

 In 20 such cases, the jawans either shot themselves with their service revolvers, or died by hanging or drinking poison. A senior BSF official said the force is probing the reasons behind the deaths.

 The jawans who took their lives held ranks ranging from inspector and constable to cook.

 The report cites the case of Surjit Singh, an inspector in Murshidabad, who was found hanging inside his battalion complex in February last year. 

 Head constable P.K. Goswami of the 140 battalion in Murshidabad shot himself in April last year, while constable Parma Ram of the sixth battalion in North 24-Parganas gulped down poison in October. 

 BSF officials said 45 per cent of the jawans who committed suicide shot themselves with their service revolvers. 

 We cannot deny that jawans suffer from stress due to heavy workload. They also stay away from their families, which adds to the pressure, said Somesh Goyal, BSF inspector-general (south Bengal).

 There are also allegations of harassment by superior officers.

 Inspector S. Dwivedi had moved a city court challenging a decision to transfer him seven times in two years. Dwivedis lawyer P.N. Sharma said: He had appealed to his superiors against the transfers and other forms of harassment but in vain. 

 BSF deputy inspector-general (headquarters) Anil Kumar Jha said attempts are being made to improve the living conditions of jawans on the Bangladesh border.

 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, March 21: The Assembly today passed a bill that clears Calcutta Universitys ground for granting autonomy to affiliated colleges. 

 The Calcutta University (Amendment) Bill, 2006, became necessary after it decided to grant autonomy to St Xaviers in early March. Higher education minister Satyasadhan Chakraborty said the need to grant independence to some colleges was utmost. 

 Last day: The Assembly was adjourned sine die at the end of the last session of the 13th House.

Calcutta: The high court has stopped for the time being the 

construction of an industrial unit on a plot apparently leased out by the maharaja 

of Burdwan in 1960. A family member of one J.N. Chatterjee claimed a 948-acre 

plot at Kamalpur in Burdwan, 220 km from Calcutta, had been leased out for 999 

years. The Asansol-Durgapur Development Authority had handed over a portion of 

it for a factory.

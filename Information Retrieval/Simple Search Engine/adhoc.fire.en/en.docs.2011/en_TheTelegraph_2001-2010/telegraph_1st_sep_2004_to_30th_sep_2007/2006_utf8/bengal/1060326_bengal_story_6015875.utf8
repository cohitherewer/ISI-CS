The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Officials held, flight school cries foul

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 25: Two officials of the Air Hostess Academy (AHA) were arrested today on the charge of duping a student with false promises of a job in a prominent airline.

 This is the second time in a year that the police have cracked down on the Delhi-based academys Ballygunge Circular Road branch. A few months ago, two other officials had been held on the same charge.

 Todays arrests followed a complaint filed by Soumyajit Bhowmik, a student of the academy who was allegedly promised a flight stewards job. 

 The academy authorities charged Rs 32,000 from me and assured that I would get a job in a prominent airline. But I did not get any job within the time promised by the institution, he alleged.

 According to the police, Bhowmik enrolled into the institute after an advertisement caught his eye. 

 The AHA authorities mentioned in their advertisement that they have tie-ups with prominent airlines and regularly organise campus interviews in collaboration with different flight operating agencies. They also claimed that 70 per cent of their students get jobs in leading airlines immediately after completing their course, N.R. Babu, deputy commissioner of police, south division, said.

 An AHA official said the allegations were a conspiracy hatched by a rival institute.

 It has over the years tried to defame and disparage AHA? either by taking out advertisements or making others take out advertisements merely to degrade AHA in the eyes of its potential students, AHA said in a statement. 

 The statement added that the rival company has been restrained by court from taking out any advertisement with any reference to AHA. 

 The modus operandi is to plant its own people as students and influence them to make false complaints to the police authorities and get a case registered against AHA, it said.

 Acting on Bhowmiks complaint, a team led by sub-inspector Soumya Thakur went to Mumbai. They spoke to the heads of the airlines whose names were mentioned in the academys profile. The airlines authorities said they had no tie-up with AHA, said an officer.

 After getting a written statement from the airlines authorities denying the academys claim, the police raided its premises in Calcutta. 

 We arrested two persons, identified as Atul Chawla and Kaushik Bhawal. The two were in charge of the branch, the officer said.

 The police said they would have to go to Delhi for further investigations. Top officials of the organisation control its activities from Delhi. A team will soon leave to probe the matter, said a senior officer at the Lalbazar police headquarters.

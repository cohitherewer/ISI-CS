 Corn flake fire kills 7

 Behrampore, March 31: A blaze caused by burning flakes of corn killed three schoolboys and four others in a village mart in Hariharpara, about 235 km from Calcutta. 

 Seventeen people were admitted to Behrampore General Hospital. Rajibul Sheikh, 10, Mintu Molla, 10, and Rinku Ansari, 13, were among the seven who died there. 

 Police said the fire started when burning flakes of corn flew in the breeze from the oven of a maize seller to a hardware shop that was selling petrol and diesel illegally.

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Malda, July 29: A 13-year-old schoolgirl from Malda was gangraped yesterday before being strangled to death, police said.

 Her body was found buried in a paddy field. 

 Police said the incident took place when the girl was returning home from a private tutors house in Bakchar village near Nalalgola under Bamangola police station, about 250 km from Calcutta.

 The body was exhumed in the small hours today and police arrested three youths, who later confessed to the crime during a marathon interrogation. Three other alleged accomplices are at large.

 Residents of Nalalgola today observed a 12-hour bandh and demanded the arrest of the rest of the culprits. 

 Debasish Boral, the Malda additional superintendent of police, said preliminary investigations revealed that the girl, a Class VI student of Nalalgola High School, was gangraped as there were several injury marks on her body. Both the skirt and the top she was wearing were torn. 

 The police said the girl, the daughter of a farmer, used to go for tuitions everyday. As usual, she went to the private tutors house last evening. Normally, she would come home by 8 pm. Her parents grew anxious when she did not turn up till 10 pm. They went to the tutors house and came to know that she had left for home around 8 pm, an officer said. 

 Her parents alerted some villagers and they went looking for her. Around 10.30 pm, some people spotted a leg jutting out of the ground in a field and called the police. 

 A team from Bamangola police station arrived past midnight and the body was dug out around 1 am today. 

 Officer-in-charge of Bamangola police station Anil Roy said: The arrested youths are from the same village and they used to follow her everyday on her way to school. 

 According to Roy, some villagers noticed the trio ? Anarul, Jahangir and Mithun ? and three others moving about the village at 9 pm. 

 He said the arrested trio have been charged with rape and murder. Though we are yet to receive the post-mortem report, we have come to know that the girl was gangraped before being murdered, he added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Autos get to the eyes

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Barakar, April 28: Autorickshaws using adulterated fuel are kicking up a lot of dust in Barakar town ahead of the Assembly polls. 

 Residents say their eyes are getting affected as about 250 autorickshaws ply across the town every day, emitting thick clouds of smoke. The cheap fuel that they run on ? made by mixing petrol and kerosene ? is fast turning into an election issue here. 

 Please save us from this severe air pollution. Stop the autorickshaws that use adulterated fuel. We are falling sick, 60-year-old Siddhi Vikash Barnawal told the Forward Bloc candidate for the Kulti constituency, Maniklal Achariya, when he came here to campaign. 

 He was soon joined by Praveen Kedia, who said his 10-year-old daughter had a burning sensation in her eyes. I am thinking of taking her to Chennai for treatment.... We live in a ground-floor flat on Barakar Station Road and have to keep the windows closed till late at night because of the thick clouds of smoke the autorickshaws belch out. 

 The complaints have come to the notice of the state pollution control board. 

 We will thoroughly investigate the matter and ask the police to take strong action against the offenders, said Biswajit Mukherjee, senior officer at the PCB headquarters in Salt Lake.

 The autorickshaw drivers cite the high price of petrol. We mix the two fuels because it is cheaper. Petrol has become costly but we cant charge extra fare from passengers, said Tarik Anwar, who runs his autorickshaw between Barakar and Chirkunda in Jharkhand.

 Achariya, the sitting MLA, too, sympathises with autorickshaw drivers saying petrol does not come cheap. I have urged them to avoid using kerosene. But what will they do? They have to sustain their families.

 Debesh Das: On a mission

 Bangalore, Oct. 31: A sincere minister, an investor-friendly state and a government that is keen to perform Bengal IT minister Debesh Das boarded the flight to Calcutta with a bouquet of compliments. 

 Not just kudos, Das also won promises, which he claimed would turn into investments for the state. Three small companies have evinced keen interest and the government will soon sign MoUs with them. Their presence in Calcutta is bound to attract a host of other companies, said Das, claiming success from his maiden appearance at Bangalore IT.in 2006. 

 Vivek Kulkarni, CEO, BrickWorks said: The IT pie is big enough to be shared, especially by those states that take a lesson out of Bangalores negatives and plan properly. 

 A stable government should help Bengal, Kulkarni said, adding that the state needs a master plan to avoid Bangalores traffic congestion and lack of infrastructure. 

 Besides promoting Bengal as a perfect destination for the IT and ITES companies, the minister also tried to hard sell the state to the semiconductor industry. 

 On Sunday, Das hosted a lunch for CEOs. 

 I met at least 25 CEOs from the semiconductor industry. We are mutually excited about the states prospect in attracting semiconductor companies. Theyve given many suggestions and ideas, said Das. 

 Chip-makers Intel, NXP, Texas Instruments, Samsung India and AMD and Wipro, TCS and MindTree Consulting were among companies represented at the lunch meeting. 

 The government, he said, will weave in the suggestions of the semiconductor industry to frame an investor-friendly policy. 

 While Das is desperate to bring in the chip manufacturers to Bengal, the environment lobby in the state has started expressing its concerns. 

 Semiconductor companies are being shown the door by developed countries because of environment hazards. It is surprising that the Bengal government is rolling out the red carpet for them, said an environment activist. 

 Bengal does not have any chip-manufacturing company now and so there are no specific guidelines for the industry, said a source in the state pollution control board. 

 Layers of wire and semi-conductors sandwiched between layers of silicon comprise a computer chip. 

 The semiconductor industry generates toxic waste. Besides, the organic materials used are a source of carcinogenic waste. So a proper due diligence is a must before letting them enter the state, the pollution board official said.

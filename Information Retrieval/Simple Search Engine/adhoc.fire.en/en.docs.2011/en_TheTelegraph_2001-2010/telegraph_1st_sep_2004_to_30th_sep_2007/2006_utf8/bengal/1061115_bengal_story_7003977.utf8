The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Great Bengal job trick

 - Unemployment figure falls as govt raises minimum age

 SIMI KAMBOJ 

 Calcutta, Nov. 14: The number of unemployed in Bengal came down by 11 lakh in minutes today after the government decided to scrap employment exchange registrations of those below 18.

 This segment accounts for 11 lakh individuals out of the 73 lakh who are registered with the exchange.

 We have decided to discontinue the practice of registering those aged 14-17. For one, they are not employable till they attain the age of 18. Second, the inclusion of this group makes the unemployment figure bigger than what it is, a senior labour department official said.

 The Centres employment manual prescribes that registration with employment exchanges is possible once a person attains the age of 14. 

 But the state labour department issued a notification effective from November 1 to bring about the change in Bengal.

 The government is also trying to cut down the time taken to call registered candidates short-listed for a particular job. 

 Earlier, the employment exchange took about 75 days to summon them. The possible recruiter should now get the names of the candidates within seven days, labour secretary Subesh Das said.

 Das said the move was meant to curb unfair practices, including interception of interview call letters.

 Many FIRs have been lodged by candidates alleging that their interview call letters were wilfully destroyed, said employment exchange director Shyamal Bhattacharya.

 For a single vacancy, around 35 candidates registered with the employment exchange get an interview call.

 The number of people registered with the exchange, however, does not reflect the states actual unemployment figure. With the lure of government jobs fading, many do not get registered with the exchange anymore.

 Many youths have found jobs elsewhere but continue to be registered. Similarly, there is a large section of youths employed in urban areas, mainly in the corporate sector, who have never registered at these exchanges and have remained out of reckoning, said Das.

 Recruitment through the employment exchange is made primarily to fill govern-ment posts not covered by the public service commission and the school service commission.

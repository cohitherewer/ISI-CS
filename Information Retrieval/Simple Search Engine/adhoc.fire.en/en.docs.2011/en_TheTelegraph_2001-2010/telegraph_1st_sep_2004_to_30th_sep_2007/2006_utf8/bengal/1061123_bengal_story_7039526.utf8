The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Law to speed up land acquisition on way

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Nov. 22: The 29-year-old Left Front government is poised to amend the law, allowing investors in industry, commerce and infrastructure ventures to acquire, hold and transfer land in excess of the rural ceiling in a move that could speed up its industrialisation drive.

 The changes, envisaged in the West Bengal Land Reforms (Amendment) Bill, 2006, will be tabled within a few days.

 Officials of the land and land reforms department say the government needs the new law to acquire around 40,000 acres for mega projects of the Salim Group as well as a string of SEZs. 

 The amendments will be made to West Bengal Land Reforms Act, 1955, which allowed tea garden, mill and factory to retain land above the ceiling. Now, industry, commerce or infrastructure will be added to the list.

 The bill empowers district collectors to regularise the change, conversion or alteration in the area, character or mode of use of any plot of land except water bodies in public interest. 

 This means investors who have already purchased agricultural land without prior government approval will not face penalties like fines or jail terms. 

 Investors will not be given raiyat or tenancy rights, but only a lease or licence on the basis of a permit from the state. 

 The government will take back the land and enforce the ceiling if investor-developers fail to utilise the land for such a purpose within three years, or transfer the plot without permission. However, the approval wont be needed for townships.

 The bill allows a bargadar or share-cropper to surrender the right of cultivation in respect of 50 per cent of land cultivated by him to the owner who wants to sell it to investor-developers or the government. 

 The sharecroppers the most visible beneficiaries of Bengals land reforms will probably get 50 per cent of the land value as compensation; at present, it is six times the value of the annual yield. For this, a separate amendment will have to be made in a central statute, an official said. 

 The bill says a tribal raiyats land cant be transferred unless an equivalent quantum of land of the same character in the vicinity of the transferred plot of land is given.

 The government plans to levy development charges on industries and commercial organisations. The West Bengal Town and Country (planning and development) second Amendment Bill, 2006, says the government will specify the fees for changes in the use of agricultural land. 

 An amendment to the Ground Water Resources (management, control and regulation) Act was passed today, empowering the government to levy charges on industry and high-rises for use of ground water.

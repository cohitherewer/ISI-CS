 Chicken fear in fever zone

 SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE

Baduria (North 24-Parganas), Oct. 7: A mysterious 

fever suspected to be chikungunya, which has affected over 2,000 people in Baduria, 

has sparked a fear of chickens and other birds. 

 Many residents are unaware that it is mosquitoes that cause chikungunya, not chickens the result of the state health departments inability to clear the confusion in peoples minds.

 We have heard of dengue but not of chicken-guna. All of us in our village have stopped eating chicken. The disease must have origin- ated from birds, said an upset Sanjib Das of Ramchandrapur. 

 Can it be treated or will we die if we are infected? he asked. 

 Most patients flocking to the health clinics suffer high temperature, body ache and vomiting.

 Das said the first case of the fever surfaced in early September. The district health department was informed but did not heed the warning.

 Kusum Kumar Adhikary, the chief medical officer (health) of the district, said: We have collected blood samples and sent them to the School of Tropical Medicine in Calcutta and the National Institute of Virology in Pune for tests. So far, only a single case of dengue has been confirmed.

 More than 25 patients had to be admitted today, said A. Khara, a physician of Rudrapur Rural Hos- pital. 

 I have treated quite a few patients so far and the symptoms seem to be that of chikungunya. 

 A team of experts will visit Baduria on Monday and collect blood samples.

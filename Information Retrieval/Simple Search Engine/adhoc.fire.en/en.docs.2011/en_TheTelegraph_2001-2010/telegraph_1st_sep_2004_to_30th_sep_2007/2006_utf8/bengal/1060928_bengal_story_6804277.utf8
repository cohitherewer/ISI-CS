 Biman catcall

 Calcutta, Sept. 27: Biman Bose continued with his animal imagery to describe the Opposition parties, likening them with cats today. 

 At a rally in Jadavpur this evening, the CPM state secretary raised his hands and mew-mewed to describe their voices. Mamata and the Congress leaders, he said, are like the cats in Singur. 

 Bose had yesterday called the Trinamul Congress-Congress combine an alliance of monkeys.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Candidates CV on view

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 26: The Election Commission has made it mandatory for all candidates to submit details of their educational qualifications, assets, liabilities and criminal antecedents, if any. 

 The same set of information on their spouses and dependants will also have to be provided. Copies of the affidavits will be distributed free by the administration, if anyone wants the details.

 The poll panel had introduced the system before the 2004 Lok Sabha elections. It would be a first for the Assembly polls in Bengal. 

 Every citizen has a right to know about the candidates contesting an election and make an informed judgement, chief electoral officer Debasish Sen said today.

 The commission has directed all returning officers to put on display copies of nomination papers and the accompanying affidavits in their offices. As a voter, you have every right to seek this information and get it. However, this affidavit cannot be challenged, Sen added. 

 The returning officers will provide voters details of loans taken by a candidate from a government agency through newspaper advertisements.

 For physically challenged voters, ramps would be constructed on the way to ground-floor polling booths so that they can vote without any difficulty. 

 Graffiti ? banned by the government following a poll panel request ? should have been erased across the state by March 25. Sen said the government is to submit a compliance report by tomorrow.

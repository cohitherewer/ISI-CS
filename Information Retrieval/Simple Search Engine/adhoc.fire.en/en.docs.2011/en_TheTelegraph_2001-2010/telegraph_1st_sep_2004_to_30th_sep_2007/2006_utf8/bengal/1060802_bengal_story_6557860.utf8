The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Naxalites stun special squad with firepower

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Midnapore, Aug. 1: Maoist guerrillas matched paramilitary jawans deployed especially to tackle them bullet for bullet in a battle in Belpahari last night that raged for over two-and-a-half hours. 

 West Midnapore police described the encounter on a hillock at Chhurumara, about 260 km from Calcutta, as unprecedented in Bengal.

 India Reserve Battalion personnel fired from their self-loaded rifles, light machineguns and carbines when the Maoists attacked their camp in an under-construction building around 11.35 pm. But the rebels firepower surprised them. 

 District superintendent of police Ajay Nand confirmed that the rebels were also armed with semi-automatic guns. This is the first time that an encounter between the paramilitary and Maoists went for so long, he added.

 Although around 80 rounds were exchanged, no casualties were reported. The police blamed it on the darkness and the forest cover. 

 A search for the rebels was launched today. 

 Sixty Indian Reserve Battalion personnel are stationed in the area since 2004 to assist the district police in Maoist combat. Besides, seven police camps have also been set up. Yet, none of the rebels could be held last night. 

 But the armed forces put up a brave front today in declaring that construction of the camp will resume again tomorrow. 

 Maoists had earlier attacked an under-construction police camp at Gurpana in Purulia earlier this year.

 It is a matter of concern, inspector-general, law and order, Raj Kanojia said in Calcutta.

 Belpahari and its adjoining areas are known Maoist strongholds where CPM supporters and policemen have been targeted on several occasions in the past few years.

 The partys Belpahari local committee member Rabi Das was shot dead in June. 

 In February, four civilians returning in a police jeep after attending a medical camp were blown to pieces when a landmine planted by the Maoists exploded. In February 2004, seven police personnel and their driver were also killed when the jeep they were travelling in was blown up.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Teachers bunk, students in class

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bolpur, May 23: Parents fed up with the regular absence of teachers locked up a primary school in a Birbhum village this morning. 

 Papuri Primary School st-arted as usual around 6 am ? with a lone teacher in attendance during the morning prayer sung by some 250 children.

 The second teacher walked in at 7.30. But none of the three others or the headmaster turned up. 

 The parents of Papuri village in Nanoor, 230 km from Calcutta, did not always believe their children when they alleged that their teachers were mostly missing. 

 Today, they lay in wait to see if what they said was true. It was.

 Sudeb Thunder, the teacher who arrived late, was on the verge of being beaten up when Mohammad Mohsin, his more punctual colleague, jumped to his rescue. Mohsin told the parents that Sudeb had sought permission for coming late. 

 Our children would freq-uently tell us that the teachers are absent and that is why home works are not checked regularly, said Sheikh Giasud- din, father of Class III student Asibur. 

 Nurul Haque, a commerce graduate and a former student whose house is a stones throw away, said: It is clear that neither the teachers nor the headmaster are interested in running the institution. So we closed it down.

 Haque added that the headmaster came only twice or thrice a week. 

 After the school was shut down, the villagers went looking for the headmaster, Mohammad Mojahar Hossain. His house was locked.

 The chairman of the district primary school council, Goutam Ghosh, said he would visit the school tomorrow.

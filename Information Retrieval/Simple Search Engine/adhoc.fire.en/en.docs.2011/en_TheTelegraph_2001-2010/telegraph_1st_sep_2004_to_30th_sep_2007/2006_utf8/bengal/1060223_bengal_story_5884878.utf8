 Doctor body on rail tracks

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Purulia, Feb. 22: A doctors body was found mutilated on railway tracks about 15 km from the district town early this morning. His mangled Wagon R was also on the tracks, about a kilometre away. 

 Aniruddha Chel, 41, a resident of Purulia town, was working on contract at a health centre in Keroa village in the mofussil police station area.

 Police said a train hit him near Gourinath Dham station around 5.30. It rammed against the car after running over Chel and pushed the vehicle nearly a km before coming to a halt.

 A police officer, however, said it was not possible for the doctor to drive across the tracks in that stretch. There is no level crossing there.

 The driver of the Bokaro-bound local train from Burd-wan saw someone lying on the tracks around 5.25 am, said an officer of the Government Railway Police. In the faint light, he realised late that there was someone there. He ran over the doctor and hit his car.

 The father of a 10-year-old son and five-year-old daughter, Aniruddha went to Bokaro in Jharkhand every Tuesday to treat patients there. Around 11 last night, he called up his father and told him that he would not return home in the morning. Around 7 am, his father received a call from the police informing him about his sons death, the officer said.

 Satya Narayan Banerjee, the deputy superintendent of police (headquarters), said: It is difficult to say at this stage whether it was an accident or a murder. We have to wait for the post-mortem report.

 Aniruddhas father Nani Gopal, 70, is a popular dermatologist in the town. 

 Ramen, the doctors brother, said: We believe that he was murdered. He was either drugged and laid on the tracks or murdered elsewhere. He could not suggest a motive.

 After the accident, the train was held up for over two hours. Villagers helped railway employees remove the car.

 This is not the first time that a doctor has died under mysterious circumstances in the state. In 2004, Sushil Pals body was found in a canal at Bally in Howrah. It bore multiple injuries. The CID said he was killed for allegedly refusing to carry out an abortion. 

 The year before, surgeon Chandan Sen was found dead in a pond in Nadias Ranaghat. The post-mortem revealed 11 injuries and ruled the death was caused by asphyxia as a result of smothering.

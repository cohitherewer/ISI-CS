 Pox shuts down NIT

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Durgapur, March 8: A year after National Institute of Technology here had to close down following an outbreak of jaundice on campus, it has had to do the same to deal with a bout of chicken pox.

 All under-graduate classes and mid-semester examinations in the institute, known as the Regional Engineering College earlier, have been put off till March 20.

 Altogether, 13 second-year students have been affected by the infectious disease and another 12 are suspected to have contracted it, director Swapan Bhattacharjee said today. 

 Those students willing to leave the hostels have been asked to go home, he added. 

 Two undergraduate stud- ents first took ill a week ago but the problem came to the authorities notice on Monday when the mid-semester examinations were scheduled to begin. Some students drew my attention to the situation, Bhattacharjee said. 

 The institute has nearly 2,500 students, including some foreigners, who stay in nine hostels on the campus, about 210 km from Calcutta.

 M.K. Nandy, the superintendent of Durgapur Subdivisional Hospital, confirmed that 13 students were suffering from chicken pox. I am definite that 12 others have also developed symptoms of the disease, he said. 

 Last May, classes had to be suspended for a month when over a hundred students were affected by jaundice. All students had fled the hostels then.

 Institute officials said this time, 120 students have already left. 

 A second-year student of metallurgy from Guwahati, who was busy packing his belongings this afternoon, said: I wont take chances. My parents are worried and have advised me not to stay here. The disease is spreading.

 Snehasish Panigrahi, the general secretary of the students union, has already returned home. From his house in Bhubaneswar, he said over telephone: We are happy that the classes have been suspended. I have also requested them to clean the toilets and canteens properly.

 The 30 students from Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan, however, do not have the easy option of leaving the hostel. Many of them were today looking for cheap hotels.

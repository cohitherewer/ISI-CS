 Calcutta, Oct. 29: With Reliance Industries keen to set up terminal markets as part of its Rs 2,000-crore agri-retail project, the agriculture marketing department has pressed the pause button on the revamp of 64 regulated markets. 

 The government had set up these markets to ensure fair price to farmers and to keep away middlemen. 

 Out of 64, only 20-odd regulated markets are now operational. So, the agri-marketing department was planning their revival by conducting first a pilot project in four markets and then floating a tender inviting private partners, a source said. 

 The revamp road map was worked out over the past year involving industry bodies and consultants. But everything is now on hold as Reliance has come up with a similar proposal and the government is more interested in involving it than developing regulated markets in a joint venture format, explained the source. 

 The Mukesh Ambani-led conglomerate wants to set up procurement and collection centres, model farms and retail outlets. But the lifeline of the model will be the terminal markets, where farmers will bring their produce and sell it to the company.

 Reliance has already submitted its plans to the state and is ready with the draft agreement. It is planning similar initiatives in Punjab, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh and Andhra Pradesh. 

 The Bengal government is working on the specifics of an MoU with Reliance to hand over some of the regulated markets to the company to convert them into terminal markets, said the source. 

 Most regulated markets spread over 10-15 acres have basic infrastructure in place and turning them into terminal markets will be easy. 

 Chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb had recently called a meeting with departmental secretaries to discuss the Reliance plan and work out how the government can facilitate its implementation. 

 The secretary of agricultural marketing, Bimal Pandey, refused comment. 

 The chief secretary also chose not to divulge the governments response to the Reliance proposal. It cant be explained just like that Deb said before hanging up. 

 The silence at Writers over the Reliance proposal is an indication of divisions in the Left over letting Ambani make a foray into agriculture. 

 While Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee wants it to be put on the fast track, sections in his party and the Left Front want certain clarifications on the proposal that promises to corporatise agriculture. 

 Commerce and industries minister Nirupam Sen had got in touch with Reliance to get the clarifications. The companys answers have been forwarded to the CPM central leadership in Delhi. 

 If proper checks and balances are not incorporated, there is always a possibility that Reliance will be dictating the price of the produce and nature of production in the state, a source said. 

 The instruction to the government now is to go slow and wait for the politburos approval. At the same time, officials are clearing the decks for immediate implementation of the Reliance project once the party gives the nod.

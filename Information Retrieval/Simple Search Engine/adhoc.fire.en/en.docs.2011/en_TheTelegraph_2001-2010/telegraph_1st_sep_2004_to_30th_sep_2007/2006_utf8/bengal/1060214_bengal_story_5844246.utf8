The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Nothings impossible, says Alva

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Feb. 13: Margaret Alva, the AICC general secretary in charge of Bengal, is still optimistic about a poll pact with Mamata Banerjee.

 Out of 30 Congress MLAs, Alva today spoke to 20 and also the partys district presidents. All of them, she said, advocated an alliance with the Trinamul Congress.

 She will meet members of the state Congress executive tomorrow. 

 Something positive will definitely emerge in the run-up to the Assembly polls as discussions are on at every level. We have not shut our doors, neither has Mamata. Efforts are on to work out how we can together prevent a division of anti-CPM votes, Alva said after winding up her seven-hour interaction with party Congress functionaries.

 She has apparently been sent to the city on the two-day fact-finding mission by Congress president Sonia Gandhi. 

 Alva said she would call on Mamata on her return to Delhi. We have been friends for a long time. Mamata is basically a Congress woman who must be aware of our stand vis-?-vis the BJP. I think she will take a positive decision taking all aspects into consideration.

 On Mamatas decision to not snap her BJP ties, Alva said: Dont be impatient. Nothing is impossible in politics. We have made certain offers (see box) to Mamata and it is now up to her to respond.

 Before leaving for the capital, Mamata said seat adjustments with the Congress could be worked out following a formula former Prime Minister V.P. Singh had adopted in 1989 to bring the Janata Dal, BJP and the Left together to ensure Rajiv Gandhis defeat at the Centre.

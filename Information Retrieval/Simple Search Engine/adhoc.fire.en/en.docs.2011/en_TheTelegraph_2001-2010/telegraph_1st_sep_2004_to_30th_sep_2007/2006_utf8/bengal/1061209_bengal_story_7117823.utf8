 Schoolboy kidnapped from park near home

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Dec. 8: A six-year-old boy was kidnapped near his house in the Phoolbagan area this morning, police said. 

 Rohan Gupta, a student of Class I, was about to set out for school around 10 am when the phone rang.

 Rohans family members said the caller was Santosh Gupta, who used to work for the boys father, Bankelal Gupta. 

 The Guptas, who live on B.T. Road, have a flourishing business of transport and scrap iron.

 My son Sujit, who was about to take Rohan to school, took that call. Santosh said he wanted to see Rohan once. He requested Sujit to take Rohan to the nearby Biswanath Park, where he was waiting, said Bachchulal Gupta, Bankelals elder brother. 

 Bachchulal said Santosh told Sujit he wanted to take Rohan for a ride in his Tata Sumo. After waiting for nearly an hour, Sujit panicked and informed his family, who got in touch with officers of the local Sinthi police station.

 Our preliminary investigation suggests that the man (Santosh) was very close to the Guptas. He sped away in a Tata Sumo with the boy. We have launched a hunt for the boy, said Damayanti Sen, the deputy commissioner of police (north).

 The police detained Sujit and interrogated him for hours. The other members of the family were also questioned. We are investigating the matter from all angles, the DC said. 

 On hearing the news, neighbours and relatives rushed to Rohans house. 

 We cant believe such a thing can happen. Rohan was such a sweet boy. Who can harbour any malice against him? asked neighbour Gopal Singh.

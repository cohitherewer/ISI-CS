 Eye on Simi

 Calcutta, July 13: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today said the government was monitoring the activities of the banned Students Islamic Movement of India (Simi), says a staff reporter. 

 Simi activists do not operate directly after the ban. Its members work under different names. We are keeping a close watch on their movements, Bhattacharjee said.

 He added that several militant outfits, including the ISI, are active in the state. We have asked police in the border areas to be on alert.

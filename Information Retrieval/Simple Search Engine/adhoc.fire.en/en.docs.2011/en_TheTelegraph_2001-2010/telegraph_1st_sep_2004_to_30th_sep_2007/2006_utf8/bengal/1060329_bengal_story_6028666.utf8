The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Mamata spares Cong duo

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, March 28: Mamata Banerjee today announced candidates for all the seats she had left out earlier expecting a deal with the Congress but for two which Somen Mitra and Priya Ranjan Das Munshis wife Deepa will contest.

 Former state Congress chief Mitra, once a known Mamata baiter, has been renominated from Sealdah and Deepa, a first-timer, has entered the fray at Goalpokhar in South Dinajpur.

 Asked why she did not put up candidates for two seats out of the 294, Mamata refused to elaborate, but said: Discussions are on at various levels. 

 Mitra refused to comment on Mamatas decision, but said: The people want us to get united?. It is unfortunate that we could not fulfil the peoples aspirations because of our national compulsions. 

 Deepa was out of bounds. 

 Mamata had broken away from the Congress in August 1997 primarily because of her strained relations with Mitra, then state Congress president. 

 The situation came to such a pass that Mamata had even organised a parallel rally at Esplanade to counter an AICC session at Netaji Indoor Stadium. Expelled on the charges of anti-party activities, Mamata floated the Trinamul Congress in January next year. 

 For the 2006 polls, the Trinamul chief had earlier announced 201 candidates. 

 Out of the 292 candidates on her final list, ally BJP has 32 and the partners of the front she recently floated 10 candidates. Trinamul has 252.

 The Congress had ruled out any truck with Mamata because of her ties with the BJP.

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Durgapur, Feb. 6: Physician Bholanath Bhattacharya, 54, allegedly committed suicide by jumping in front of a running train this morning near the east cabin of Durgapur railway station.

 Police recovered the mangled body from the tracks and on interrogating witnesses apparently saw no foul play. The doctor did not leave any suicide note.

 Bhattacharya, who had been working at the Durgapur Projects Ltd (DPL) hospital, 180 km from Calcutta, for the past 22 years, arrived at the outdoor clinic like any other day around 8 am today. After examining patients, he left around 11 am. Usually, he stays at the hospital till 1 pm.

 We dont suspect any foul play. After inspecting the injuries and speaking to witnesses, it appears to be a case of suicide. However, we are waiting for the post-mortem report, said an officer of the Durgapur government railway police.

 The doctors relative and local Trinamul Congress MLA Apurba Mukherjee said: He was honest, polite and very popular. I know him ever since my cousin got married to him 25 years ago. My cousin was happy with him.

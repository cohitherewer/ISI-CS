 Are you nuts? Cong asks pro-deal camp

 Calcutta, Jan. 7: The Congress today poured cold water on Mamata Banerjees hopes when it ruled out an alliance with a party that has ties with the BJP.

 The state Congress leadership took the decision at a meeting of the PCC executive committee, convened exclusively to discuss the proposed tie-up. 

 The meeting follows state Congress chief Pranab Mukherjees one-to-one with Mamata, the Trinamul Congress president, on December 31.

 Forty-five state Congress members submitted their opinion at the marathon meeting that lasted seven hours since 11 this morning.

 Imagine a situation in which Congress president Sonia Gandhi is proposing the name of the alliances candidate (Mamata) for the post of chief minister and (former) BJP chief L.K. Advani is seconding it. Against this backdrop, can the UPA coalition survive at the Centre? Mukherjee shot back when some of his party functionaries insisted on the electoral alliance.

 Be practical and get your head examined. Dont forget that we did not improve much even though we had tied up with Mamata during the last Assembly polls. Ours is a national party and we should come clean vis-?-vis an electoral alliance with Mamata, who is still with the NDA. We should not go for any tie-up with her until she severs ties with the NDA, he said. 

 Information and broadcasting minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi made it clear to the pro-alliance leaders that the Congress would not repeat the blunder committed by the CPM when it had joined forces with the erstwhile Jan Sangh to oust Indira Gandhi from power in 1977 and Rajiv Gandhi in 1989.

 Let Mamata snap her ties with the BJP and lead the anti-Left secular alliance to victory, he said.

 Mukherjee later told reporters at the Congress office that the party was ready to back a progressive secular democratic front consisting of all non-Left parties except the BJP and other communal parties.

 Mamata, however, stuck to her stand that she wanted to stitch together all anti-CPM forces, including the BJP. I am not opposed to the Congress for taking support from the CPM to run its coalition government at the Centre. Then why is the Congress imposing pre-conditions on me? she asked.

 Youth cries custody torture

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 9: A youth from Sodepur, who was detained on Thursday night for allegedly harassing a housewife, today said he was tortured in custody that landed him in hospital.

 Babusona Debnath, a 25-year-old carpenter, was picked up from his home in Sodepur, on the northern fringes of the city, by officers of Ghola police station.

 He was admitted to the Panihati State General Hospital yesterday with bruises on his back and legs. Debnath was released today. 

 The police beat me up in the lock-up. My only fault was that I had protested against a woman who was running a sex racket in our locality, he said, while coming out of the hospital. 

 Hospital sources confirmed that Debnath was badly bruised and had to be admitted to the surgical ward.

 The police today rubbished the carpenters charges. We kept him in the lock-up for interrogation on Thursday night and the next day we produced him in court, which granted him bail. So the question of torturing him does not arise, said a senior officer.

 Praveen Kumar, the superintendent of police, North 24-Parganas, however, promised a probe if Debnath lodges a complaint with us.

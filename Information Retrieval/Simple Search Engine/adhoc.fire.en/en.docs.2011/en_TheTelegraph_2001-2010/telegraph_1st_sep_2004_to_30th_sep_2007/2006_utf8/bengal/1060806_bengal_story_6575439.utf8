 Calcutta, Aug. 5: A traffic constable and a sergeant emerged heroes this morning as they rescued a six-year-old stranded in a bus after an hour-long chase.

 Subir and Krishna Das had boarded a CSTC bus route 33 at 9.45 am to get daughter Trishas eyes checked at a clinic in Rajabazar.

 The bus, which was travelling at breakneck speed, was stopped at the Shyambazar five-point crossing. 

 The conductor of the bus requested some of the women passengers to help him persuade the traffic sergeant to let them go.

 I got down along with the others and approached the sergeant. He warned the conductor and let him off. He did not even have to pay the Rs 300 fine, Krishna said.

 But when Krishna turned back to get onto the bus, it had sped away, leaving me stranded, she said. 

 The bus was crowded and my husband was sitting on the rear side. So I called him up on his cellphone and told him what had happened. I asked him to wait at the Rajabazar bus stop.

 But Krishna had made a mistake. She forgot to tell her husband that Trisha, who was sitting in another corner of the bus, was not with her. Subir got off at Rajabazar and the child was left behind. 

 When they realised what they had done, Subir boarded another bus. However, he knew it would not be possible for me to find the bus carrying our daughter. I got down and informed a traffic policeman and asked for his help, he said.

 The next one hour proved to be a battle of nerves for the couple as the cop relayed the description of the six-year-old and details of the bus to his colleagues.

 Finally, traffic constable Abdul Rauf Gain spotted the vehicle near Alipore. I stopped it and was enquiring about the child when I saw her sitting by a window. When I called her by her name, she responded but would not budge from her seat, Gain said.

 By that time, Amaresh Ghosh, a traffic sergeant who had been chasing the bus, reached there. It took a lot of coaxing by the duo to win little Trishas confidence. 

 She was brought to the Tollygunge Traffic Guard office on Ghoshs motorcycle. 

 The happy ending came at 11.40 am when Subir and Krishna reached the office to see their daughter chatting with her new-found kakus.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 PIL for fair polls

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta/Midnapore, Jan. 31: A Trinamul Congress leader moved the high court today demanding its intervention to ensure free and fair elections in the state.

 Virtually expressing a lack of faith in the Election Commission, Tarak Singh, a former Calcutta Municipal Corporation councillor, pointed out in his public interest litigation (PIL) how both the poll panel and the government had flouted rules during the 2001 Assembly elections and the 2004 municipal polls.

 Some documents relating to election observers reports and compact discs have been attached with the 150-page petition in which the Trinamul leader has prayed for orders directing the commission to apply all its powers to ensure free and fair elections. 

 The elections should not be held until names of 85 lakh fake ration card holders are struck off voter lists, the petition says. 

 So far, the government has admitted the presence of only about three lakh bogus voters.

 Singhs lawyer Amalesh Roy said the case would come up for hearing next week.

 Singh had earned a name after moving court pointing out irregularities in the distribution of plots in Salt Lake. The Supreme Court observed recently that there was a nexus between the state government and then high court judge Bhagabati Prosad Banerjee during the distribution of plots on then chief minister Jyoti Basus quota. 

 Not just the Trinamul leader, the Election Commission today also came under pressure from the CPI, a Left Front partner. 

 Days after the CPM asked election observers not to overstep limits, CPI leader A.B. Bardhan accused the commission of creating panic among voters.

 The Election Commission did a commendable job in Bihar, where the mafia ruled the polls. But in Bengal people cast their votes without fear. Then why is the commission sending its men over and over again? What does it want? Does it want to create panic? he asked at a meeting of the CPI peasants wing in Contai, East Midnapore, about 180 km from Calcutta.

 The CPM-dominated West Bengal Secretariat Employees Association accused the commission of trying to create pressure on the government by trying to keep schoolteachers away from election duty.

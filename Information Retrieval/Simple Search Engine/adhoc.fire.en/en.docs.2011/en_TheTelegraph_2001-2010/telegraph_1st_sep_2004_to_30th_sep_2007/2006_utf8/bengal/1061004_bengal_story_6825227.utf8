 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, Oct. 3: A three-year-old boy, who was hit by a two-wheeler, died at Medical College and Hospital this evening after an operation on his injured abdomen could not be conducted allegedly because doctors were not available. 

 Rohan Shiuli, who was first admitted to MR Bangur Hospital, had to be shifted to the medical college after his condition worsened. His relatives said he was to be operated around 11 am, but remained unattended till 5.45 pm, when he died. 

 Krishnagar: A 35-year-old man was beheaded allegedly by the wo- man he wanted to marry and her brothers at Thanerpara in Nadia. Sambhu Mal had fallen in love with Santi Pahari four years ago. But her mother Bamni objected to the match because he was married. Sambhu then allegedly killed his wife and passed it of as a suicide. Bamni refused him again. In January, she was found with her throat slit. However, neither Santi nor her brothers suspected foul play until a friend of Sambhu spilled the beans unwittingly. 

 Barasat: A former jawan, his wife and their son were found dead at Sindrani in Bongaon, 70 km from Calcutta. Shankar Biswas, a chit fund agent, left a suicide note saying he had taken a loan of about Rs 1.5 lakh but was unable to repay.

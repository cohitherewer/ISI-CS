The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Holy river of filth in full flow

 A STAFF REPORTER

 How clean is my ganga? 

 Calcutta, May 6: Holy river or a flow of filth? 

 Results of an analysis done by the West Bengal Pollution Control Board during 2004-2005 at eight sampled points across a 560-km stretch of the Ganga seems to suggest the latter.

 The minimum faecal coliform count ? an indicator of the faecal contamination of the river water ? found by the state board was 4,000 MPN (most probable number) while the maximum count was a whopping 850,000 MPN recorded in Dakshineswar during high tide in December 2004.

 Most of the sample points, from where water quality was measured during high and low tides, lie in greater Calcutta.

 According to the former director of the All India Institute of Hygiene amp; Public Health (AIIH amp;PH), K.J. Nath, drinking water should have zero faecal coliform while the maximum permissible limit for bathing is 500 MPN.

 Public health experts feel that regular bathers in the Ganga may be affected with diseases like diarrhoea, cholera, typhoid and may even develop eye and skin problems. While millions bathe in the ghats every day, the number climbs significantly during auspicious days in places like Babughat and Dakshineswar.

 The findings also show that the quality of the river water is particularly worrying along stretches of Garden Reach, Palta, Howrah, Serampore and Dakshineswar, where the faecal coliform count is consistently over 50,000 MPN. 

 A recent report by the ministry of environment and forests has shown how critical water quality parameters like dissolved-oxygen and biochemical-oxygen-demand have deteriorated in the Ganga in the last two decades, despite the ambitious and costly Ganga Action Plan (GAP) undertaken by the state.

 GAP has been a conceptual failure. Improvement of river water quality is not possible by putting up a few sewage treatment plants. That too, without proper sewer network in many places and with open defecation being rampant in non-sewered urban, periurban and rural areas, said Nath, who is also a former member of the GAP steering committee.

 The main reason for the failure of GAP is the lack of co-ordination with municipalities. Many of them refuse to shoulder the financial burden of running high-cost intensive treatment plants that practically serve no purpose in areas without sewer network, said river expert Kalyan Rudra.

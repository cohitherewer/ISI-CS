 Women panel wings clipped

 - Commissions directive on husband paycut set aside

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, Dec. 12: The high court today ruled that the state womens commission has no authority to direct an employer to deduct the salary of a husband to pay maintenance to his estranged wife. 

 In Bengal, the commission often directs employers to attach or deduct a portion of a mans salary to pay the maintenance.

 Justice P.S. Banerjee today said the law does not allow that. The Womens Commissions Act does not permit the commissions to ask the employing authorities to deduct the salary of the husbands for paying maintenance to their estranged wives.

 The wives, the judge added, will have to move (a) criminal court as default in paying maintenance is a criminal offence. However, a civil court can also hear the plea.

 A womens commission order asking the directorate of employment to deduct a third of the salary of one of its employees every month was set aside today.

 Samar Kumar Roy, now on deputation to Rabindra Bharati University, had married Jharna on February 18, 2002. 

 After marriage, the couple rented a house in Baranagar and started staying there.

 In September 2003, Jharna asked her husband to stay at her parents house in Firdose Lane, Sealdah. Samar agreed, but moved out of his in-laws house the next month.

 Jharna then moved a petition before the womens commission accusing her husband of torturing her mentally and physically during their stay in Baranagar and claimed maintenance from him.

 The commission directed the employment directorate to attach Samars salary. 

 Samar moved the high court. 

 In March this year, Justice S.K. Mukherjee directed the authorities concerned to release Samars salary.

 Then the womens commission passed an order asking the directorate of employment to deduct a third of Samars salary every month and pay it to Jharna. 

 Samar moved the high court again, challenging the commissions authority to pass such an order.

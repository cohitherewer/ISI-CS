The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Blow to graffiti trade

 RABI BANERJEE

 Krishnagar, March 4: Paint trader Chinmoy Bharati of Nadias Krishnagunj invests a few thousand rupees extra to stock up before every election to make the best of a spurt in demand for wall writing.

 This year, too, Chinmoy travelled to Calcutta and purchased 100 kg of paint powder of different hues.

 But the Election Commissions directive banning graffiti has made him anxious.

 Though the CPM is going ahead with writing graffiti, the Congress and the Trinamul Congress have decided to campaign against wall writing in Nadia.

 I thought my stock would be sold off fast. But sales have dropped ever since the governments directive. I was waiting for the polls as I did not do good business last year, said Chinmoy, who runs a paint shop at in Krishnagunj, about 110 km from Calcutta.

 During the Lok Sabha polls in 2004, Chinmoy had made a profit of several thousands by selling paint for graffiti.

 Like him, Nanda Biswas of Gede and Anup Ghosh of adjoining Bhimpur had also made hefty profits. 

 My most profitable customers are the CPM and other Left parties. The red they use is costlier than other paints. One kilogram sells for Rs 500, Chinmoy said. Green ? mostly bought by the Congress and the Trinamul ? comes next, fetching Rs 300 per kg.

 The ban has also put artists and labourers engaged in wall writing in a spot. About 100 artists from the district are engaged in graffiti work in Nabadwip, Krishnagar and Ranaghat. Some of the artists earn Rs 300 to Rs 400 for writing a wall.

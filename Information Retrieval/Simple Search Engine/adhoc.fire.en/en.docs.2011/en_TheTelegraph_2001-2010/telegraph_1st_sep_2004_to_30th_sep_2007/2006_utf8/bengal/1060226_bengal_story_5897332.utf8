The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Booths under EC scanner

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Feb. 25: The Election Commission has decided to appoint officers at polling stations across the state to make the final electoral rolls as error-free as possible.

 Chief electoral officer (CEO) Debashis Sen is planning to appoint one officer to keep an eye on at least three booths. Although the figure has not been finalised yet, the total number of polling stations may touch 56,000, which would mean about 14,000 government officers scanning the final rolls.

 Sen is going to hold a video-conference with all district magistrates on Monday, after which he will start appointing the booth officers.

 I will ask the district magistrates to inform me about the availability of government staff for appointment as booth officers. I believe this process will help ensure an error-free electoral list, Sen said this evening.

 Six lakh fake ration cards

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 7: Over six lakh forged ration cards have been detected across 17 districts over the last 11 days, CPM state secretary Anil Biswas said today.

 He was speaking after a meeting between the CPM state leadership and zilla parishad sabhadhipatis.

 Although Biswas claimed the crackdown happened over the last 11 days, officials in the food and civil supplies department said the drive had started in December last year. 

 This is only about 50 per cent of the estimated number of forged cards. Such forged ration cards are in circulation in municipal and urban areas also. Our drive will continue and this time around, we will also involve heads of municipalities and municipal corporations. Our party will soon hold meetings with them, Biswas said.

 The CPM leader, however, admitted that the number of ration cards issued across the state exceeds the population. 

 After the 2001 census, if there have been five lakh births every year over the last five years and two lakh deaths, we still have a population of around eight crore. But our number of ration cards is more than this, Biswas said.

 These include cards that are forged or lie unused after their owners death or are worn out over the years. 

 The CPM leader cited the migrating population from neighbouring states as one of the reasons behind the problem. 

 Were not denying that a large number of migrants from Bangladesh have got themselves ration cards and are using them. Were trying to identify them.

 On the decision to issue 1.53 crore new ration cards, Biswas said the government was following a Supreme Court order and would stop issuing the cards once the courts deadline expires. The apex court has fixed February 15 as the deadline for the distribution of ration cards.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Medical college duo in the net

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Oct. 28: A group- D employee of Medical College was arrested today for getting a scrap dealer abducted after he refused to pay him Rs 30,000.

 Sheikh Bashir, who has been trading in scrap on the side for years, had sent youths working in the medical college canteen to extort the money from Mohammed Shaukat.

 Shaukat, 40, who had bagged a Rs 1-lakh contract in August for removing scrap from Calcutta Universitys College Street campus, turned up yesterday to carry away the materials mostly waste paper. 

 Late in the afternoon, when he had removed a bulk of the scrap, Bashirs man Ajay Madrasi turned up with two others. They called him to the lane between CU and Presidency College and dragged him into a car at gunpoint. 

 The guards at the varsity gate saw the youths dragging Shaukat into the car and called up the Jorasanko police station. Based on their description, the police traced Shaukat to Bashirs hideout on Eden Hospital Road. 

 Bashir, in his late 40s, and Madrasi have been arrested.

 A resident of Keshab Chandra Sen Street, Shaukat had been in the scrap business for some years and bagging contracts in colleges and universities in and around Calcutta, like Bashir. 

 As Bashir and his gang learnt about Shaukat bagging the Rs 1-lakh deal, they started looking for him. Early this month, they got in touch with Shaukat and demanded 30 per cent of the amount, but couldnt get him to pay, said an officer.

 Deputy commissioner (central) Ajay Ranade said Bashir, whose son was held for murder six years ago, wields a lot of clout in the central Calcutta scrap market and bags most of the contracts given out by CU and the medical college.

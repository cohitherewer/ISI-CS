 Hope for PSUs in a coma

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 8: The Centre is considering the revival of Andrew Yule, Burn Standard, Hindustan Cables and Tyre Corporation of India, which might involve funds to the tune of Rs 4,000 crore. 

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today said the Union ministry of heavy industries and public enterprises was considering his governments proposal to bring back to life the four ailing central public sector undertakings (PSUs). 

 Bengal houses 11 such units and none of them is doing well.

 The ministry has already approved a Rs 442-crore package for three units ? Braithwaite and Co, Bridge and Roof and BBJ Construction. The Board for Reconstruction of Public Sector Enterprises approved their revival proposal last July. 

 Union heavy industries and public enterprises minister Santosh Mohan Dev said after a 30-minute meeting with Bhattacharjee this evening that his ministry had taken a policy decision to run sick units and not retrench workers. 

 Bhattacharjee said the decision was a result of the pressure created by the Left Front government. It is on my request that the central minister has come down from Guwahati, he said. 

 Jadavpur University has already offered to take up the assets, liabilities and manpower of another sick PSU ? National Instruments ? and revive it.

 We have recommended to the Centre that the laboratory and other assets of National Instruments be handed over to JU. Talks with them on this issue are in the final stages, the chief minister said.

 The two also discussed the erosion of the banks of the Ganga and Padma. 

 Dev said: I have already spoken to the Prime Minister on this issue. The Bengal irrigation and water resources investigation departments will form a committee to address the problem.

 A technical committee comprising central and state government officials has also been formed.

 Bhattacharjee said he had demanded that the Teesta barrage ? being constructed for over two decades in Darjeeling district ? be declared a national project and the Centre has agreed.

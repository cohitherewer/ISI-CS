 Krishnagar, Oct. 29: Snipping the red tape around procedures involved in giving out compensation to the relatives of those killed in a calamity, the Nadia administration has started distributing relief for last months floods.

 Twenty-two people died in the September floods in Nadia. Twenty cheques have already been given after what district magistrate .S. Meena said were brief inquiries. 

 The next of kin of the victims are getting Rs 1 lakh Rs 50,000 from the state and an equal amount from the Centre. Under usual circumstances, the first instalment would have taken six months to reach them. 

 In many cases a year, an official said.

 The police investigation formed a major part of the process. The post-mortem report took months to come. The victims families could apply for compensation only after getting the post-mortem report. The block development officer would then start his investigation. 

 This time, superintendent of police Ajay Nand was told to wrap up the police probe on a war footing and make sure that the post-mortem report came fast. 

 The health brass were told that the detailed report could wait but not the basic information on the cause of death. I told them to find out if there was any foul play and submit an early report, Nand said.

 After every flood, families of those killed go through a complicated procedure to get their dues. The next of kin of the dead have to find a witness and obtain a death certificate from the panchayat. That certificate has to be attached to a form and submitted to the block office. The BDO then sends an inspector to verify the claim, a process that takes between six months and a year. 

 Meena instructed the BDOs to personally visit the victims. We tried to play a pro-active role by identifying the victims quickly and sending our officers to hand over the cheques. The paperwork could be completed later, he said.

 In 2000, Sumati Biswas, her husband and three children fell into swirling floodwaters after their rescue boat capsized in Krishnagunj. Sumati could be saved but not her husband the familys only earning member and children. She received her compensation two years later.

 In 2006, Hanifa Bewa, a resident of Fakirdanga in Nabadwip who was widowed, saw block development officer Dilip Banerjee at her door last week. The BDO asked me a few questions on how my husband died and handed me a cheque for Rs 50,000, she said.

 Her husband, Rustam Ali, 45, had fallen into the floodwaters from a relief boat on September 25. 

 The BDO told her she would get the remaining Rs 50,000 the Centres share later.

 Madhyamik belly bulge sparks scare 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Dec. 31: Those seeking admission to Class XI in 2006 might as well begin fretting with the New Year.

 The number of Madhyamik examinees is set to go up by 300,000 and Bengal would not have seats for about a third of them. That means a 100,000 shortfall of HS seats.

 School education minister Kanti Biswas today said one of the main reasons for the sharp rise in the number of candid-ates for the February exams was upgrading of 700 schools to the Madhyamik level in 2002. All these schools taught up to Class VIII till then.

 The minister was, however, more happy than concerned, with the rise in numbers. It is an indication that we have been able to bring a larger number of students under the school education system. 

 Biswas also said: We need to ensure that there are enough seats at the HS level to accommodate all those who pass Madhyamik. He was addressing a programme of the CPM-controlled All Bengal Teachers Association (ABTA).

 A school education department official said if the capacity of all 4,800-odd HS schools is taken into consideration, there are about four lakh seats. There will be over 200,000 more admission seekers in 2006 because, on an average, the success rate in Madhaymik is between 68 and 70 per cent. 

 The minister had a word of assurance. The government will introduce HS in 250 Madhyamik schools from 2006. That means about 100,000 more seats. Not enough, but, still.

 Slap in teacher face

 The government has increased financial and other benefits for school and college teachers beyond expectations but their sense of responsibility and commitment to the job has declined, two CPM leaders said today.

 The school education minister and Left Front chairman Biman Bose lashed out at the teaching community for neglecting their primary responsibility ? to educate. 

 At the ABTA programme in which Jyoti Basu was also present, Biswas said: It is shocking and painful to see teachers making gross mistakes in evaluating Madhyamik and HS answer scripts.

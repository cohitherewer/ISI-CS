 Bank raid in Maoist belt

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Purulia, July 25: A gang of six today walked into a nationalised bank in Purulia, snatched nearly Rs 3 lakh at gunpoint and shot at the guard before fleeing.

 Police are probing a possible Maoist link in the raid as Purulia, about 260 km from Calcutta, is one of three Naxalite-affected districts. 

 The police said the dacoits, carrying revolvers and pipe guns, came on three motorcycles. Four of them entered the Allahabad Bank branch ? housed in a one-storey building ? around 11.45 in the morning, while two stood guard outside. 

 There were only two customers in the bank at Jhapra village in the Para area of the district. A lone constable armed with a lathi was posted there.

 They brandished their weapons and asked everyone to keep quiet. The constable was also forced to stay quiet as a pipe gun was aimed at him, said an officer of Para police station.

 The police said the dacoits seemed to be familiar with every inch of the bank. They headed straight for the cashier, held a revolver to his temple and demanded the keys to the iron chest containing cash. One of them opened it and took out Rs 2.82 lakh and put it in a canvas bag, said an officer. 

 The entire operation took about 10 minutes.

 The four then started walking backwards to the exit, still aiming their guns at the two customers, the constable and half a dozen bank employees.

 Suddenly, the constable, Dipak Chakraborty, lunged at the dacoit who was pointing the pipe gun at him. The dacoit fired a shot. The bullet hit the constable in the abdomen. The gang then rushed out of the bank and fled in their motorcycles towards Raghunathgunj, said a police officer.

 Chakraborty, who was seriously injured, was later taken to a hospital.

 We have started combing the area to nab the culprits. Road blocks have been set up throughout the district and vehicles are being checked, said district superintendent of police Ashok Prasad.

 We are trying to step up security in banks and intensify mobile patrolling. We are not giving rifles to police constables guarding establishments like banks because they might be snatched by Maoist guerrillas, the SP said.

 An employee of the bank said the dacoits chose a time when the bank would be almost empty. It appears they had been keeping a watch on the bank. They knew when the bank would be less crowded and they even knew where the money was kept, he said.

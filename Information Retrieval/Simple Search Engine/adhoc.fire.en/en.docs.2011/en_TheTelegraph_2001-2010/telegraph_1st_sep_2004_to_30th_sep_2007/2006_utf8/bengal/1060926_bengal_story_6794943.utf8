Calcutta, Sept. 25: The 

 Friday deluge did not spare even the reservoir of knowledge. 

 Bhasha Bhavan the two-year-old annexe of National Library that houses over 3 million rare books, manuscripts, maps, periodicals and other precious documents is still under ankle-deep water. 

 The library blamed the central public works department (CPWD), which built the annexe, for the flooding.

 The new building was built because the main library was not ideal for preserving the rare reading materials. CPWD built Bhasha Bhavan and is responsible for its maintenance. On Friday, we discovered that water was seeping in and we informed it, said Sudhendu Mondol, director, National Library. 

 Bhasha Bhavans treasures 

 include rare history books available only in the national 

 library. 

 Library employees were seen rushing in and out of the building this afternoon with buckets of water. Inside, the vaults were covered with polythene sheets to minimise the impact of damage due to seepage. 

 Our staff members are working round the clock to save the books and other documents. But these are all temporary measures and it is not humanly possible to save all the books with tarpaulin sheets. We have sent repeated pleas to the CPWD, but they have done nothing, said Saibal Chakraborty, secretary of the National Library Staff Association. 

 CPWD officials could not be reached despite repeated attempts. 

 This is the second straight year that rains have played havoc with the library. Last October, water seeped into Bhasha Bhavan and even the underground vaults of an old annexe, damaging many rare books. 

 Last year, we sanctioned Rs 20 lakh for repair works after water damaged books at Bhasha Bhavan and the old annexe. But the CPWD did not carry out its responsibilities. This year, we are again facing the same problem, rued Mondol. 

 According to the library officials, 

 a faulty drainage system is the main culprit. 

 Bhasha Bhavan, billed as a modern 

 facility to preserve precious books, was built at a cost 

 of Rs 100 crore. It is centrally air-conditioned to protect 

 books from moisture damage. 

 We just cant figure 

 out how the internal drainage system of a Rs 100-crore building 

 can be faulty. quot;Moreover lakhs were spent last 

 year . quot;said Chakraborty.

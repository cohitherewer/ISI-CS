The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Jute bag opens with EC nod

 AMIT CHAKRABORTY

 Calcutta, April 18: The Election Commission has finally permitted the distribution of jute seeds to Bengal farmers but has kept panchayats out of the project. 

 About 400,000 small farmers will benefit from the decision. 

 The commission has said that the distribution of free and subsidised jute seeds to marginal farmers could be carried out as it is an ongoing annual programme, a top government official revealed. 

 The permission came late last week and about 300 tonnes of jute seed has already been despatched to the agriculture directorates extension offices at block levels, agriculture director D. Konar said. 

 According to a Jute Balers Association official, the con-fusion and delay in seed dist-ribution has not had a deep impact because of the lack of rain during the pre-sowing period. 

 There has finally been some rain in the districts since the weekend, creating the right soil conditions for sowing jute, he added.

 The association, a body of raw jute traders, monitors cultivation from sowing to fibre marketing. 

 The general availability of jute seed, which mostly come from Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh, has improved this year. The price, too, has eased compared with last year, association sources said. 

 Jute seed prices hit a high of Rs 200 a kg last year in rural pockets where recognised co-operative bodies ? through whom subsidised seeds are distributed ? are virtually non-existent. 

 This year, the balers association official said, the supply has improved and prices have ranged between Rs 70 and 100 a kilogram.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Dart squad kills, again

 Jalpaiguri, March 20: The idea was to put the rampaging bison to sleep. But in the absence of experts, the tranquillising shots proved to be fatal. 

 One of the bisons died yesterday while being taken to Gorumara National Park ? from where the herd had strayed into the villages. The other died in the sanctuary today. 

 A fortnight ago, when another herd wreaked havoc in Alipurduar, the forest staff killed one of the animals as there were no skilled tranquillisers. 

 There are only three tranquillising squads for the five wildlife and five territorial (forest area without wildlife management) divisions in the region. The only appointed technical assistant to tranquillise animals is posted in Calcutta.

 The lack of skilled personnel has not only led to the deaths of two bisons, but also cost two human lives ? if that serves as a louder wake-up call. 

 Before the animals could be shot at, they gored villagers who came in their way. An amateur photographer, who went too close for a picture, was killed on the spot. Another man, injured yesterday, succumbed to his injuries today.

 Constables daughter charges OC with rape

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bolpur, July 31: The daughter of a constable today moved court against Swargajit Bose, the officer-in-charge of Sadaipur police station in Birbhum, alleging repeated rape. 

 The girl, a resident of Kirnahar in Nanoor, about 230 km from Calcutta, told the court of the Bolpur additional chief judicial magistrate, Debashis Halder, that Bose had raped her repeatedly over the past two years, promising to marry her when she would turn 18. Bose was then the OC of Nanoor police station. 

 The Class XII student of Nanoor High School also produced a marriage registration form on which Bose had allegedly signed to gain our trust. But he married her cousin instead in May this year. 

 She told the court that she had once become pregnant and underwent an abortion in Calcutta. She had stayed in Boses house in Garia for a few days before that.

 The girls father is a constable at the Kirnahar police outpost.

 He raped me for the first time on December 26, 2004. Thereafter, he regularly forced me into a physical relationship, promising marriage after I turned 18. When I told my parents about it, he even signed a marriage registration form to gain our trust. He told us to keep the form and wait, she said. 

 The girl produced some photographs before the court showing her and the OC on the Digha beach. 

 He was transferred in March this year and we came to know in the first week of June that he had married my cousin, she said. 

 The girls father took the help of a lawyer to send letters to Nanoor police station and the Birbhum superintendent of police. When there was no response, the girl moved court.

 Halder today directed officers at Nanoor police station to register an FIR, carry out an inquiry and submit a report.

 Bose alleged that the girl was making false allegations. They are doing all this to harass me. The photographs she has produced should not be taken seriously as the girls parents, too, had gone on that trip to Digha, he said. 

 The OC added that the relationship between the girls family and that of his wife had turned sour after his marriage.

 Gunshots to scare witness

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Midnapore, Oct. 8: A band of suspected Maoists raided the house of Kanika Mahato, sister of slain CPM leader Anil Mahato, and threatened to kill her if she testified in her brothers murder case.

 Police said around 15 youths raided Kanikas house at Ergoda village under Binpur police station, about 230 km from Calcutta, around 2 am on Saturday.

 The youths fired several rounds in the air and said Kanika would meet her brothers fate if she became a witness in the murder case. Kanika is a member of the CPM womens wing, the Ganatantrik Mahila Samiti.

 Anil, 45, the CPM local committee secretary at Shilda, West Midnapore, and his AK-47-toting bodyguard Dinesh Baskey were dragged out of a bus and shot dead on September 19. The driver, conductor and the passengers screamed in panic, ran out of the bus and fled wherever they could. 

 Kanika, returning home with her brother after a party meeting, stayed put on the bus, helpless. 

 Police, who had suspected the hand of Jharkhand Party activists in the murder, have arrested nine people so far.

 After laying siege to Kanikas home for nearly an hour last night, the youths left, leaving behind posters with slogans such as Snap your relations with the CPM if you want to live in peace and Boycott policemen who are killing us.

 Panic-stricken neighbours came to Kanikas house after they were sure that the rebels had left.

 A terrified Kanika, who was inside with cousin Jyotsna Mahato and friend Hasi Kisku, peeped through a window when the other residents called her from the courtyard.

 The police took Kanika to the Binpur police station. Her relatives were sent home.

 Kanika returned to her village in the afternoon under police cover. A police picket has been posted outside her house.

 West Midnapore superintendent of police R. Rajsekharan said the identity of the youths is yet to be established. 

 But we have seized some posters in which they claim to be CPI (Maoists), said a senior officer associated with the probe.

 The CPMs Binpur local committee secretary Amiya Sengupta claimed that the youths who raided Kanikas house belonged to the Jharkhand Party (Naren). However, Chunibala Hansda, the Jharkhand Party MLA from Binpur, denied the allegation.

 Joint job with tiny cut

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Dec. 9: Cuts for joint replacement operations in Calcutta are increasingly becoming smaller with the arrival of the computer-aided navigation system.

 We are working towards a technique in which a very small incision has to be made to replace a joint, said Buddhadeb Chatterjee, an orthopaedic surgeon at Apollo Gleneagles Hospital. 

 The hospital has recently installed the computer-aided system and 10 patients have undergone surgery with the new equipment.

 With the computer-aided navigation system, the surgical process is more accurate. So small mechanical jigs to replace the worn-out joints can be used, Chatterjee explained. 

 C.S. Dhar, an orthopaedic surgeon at CMRI, said: A smaller cut means the surgeon is unable to see inside the joint that is to be replaced. The computer guides the surgeon and at the same time provides data about the condition inside.

 The computer also helps ensure a perfect alignment of the hip, knee and ankle centres. The better the alignment, the better the movement of the joint after the operation and there is also less wear and tear of the implant. 

 The navigation system guides the surgeon, making sure the bone cuts are precise, and shows the exact location of soft tissues, which helps the surgeon fix the artificial joint without causing any stress to these tissues. 

 In a routine knee replacement surgery, an incision of 10 to 12 cm is essential. With the incision bigger, there is more room for errors in cutting and placement. 

 The pain is less in the modern procedure and the recovery time faster. In this process, a knee replacement surgery would require a less-than-10 cm cut.

 Doctors said a patient usually takes around six weeks after the operation to recover completely. 

 A patient can walk on the day after the surgery, said Chatterjee. The patient can also bend the replaced joint much more than what the standard procedure would have allowed.

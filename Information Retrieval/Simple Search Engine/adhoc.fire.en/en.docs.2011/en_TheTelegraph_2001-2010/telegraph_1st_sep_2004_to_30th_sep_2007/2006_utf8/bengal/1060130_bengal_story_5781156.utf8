The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Clear water out of coal pits

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 29: Water in the abandoned coal mines of Ranigunj and Asansol will be treated and made fit to drink.

 The government will undertake a Rs 1-crore project for the purpose, to be implemented by the public health engineering department at Salanpur in Asansol, about 200 km from Calcutta. 

 The water will be collected from open-cast pits and treated. This water will be stored in reservoirs for supply to households.

 Public health engineering officials said that initially 1.5 million gallons of water would be supplied daily. Nearly 50,000 people in the colliery belt would benefit. The foundation stone for the project will be laid on February 4.

 The project is the first of its kind in the country and can be a model to be followed in areas where there is a scarcity of natural water resources and the underground reserve is inadequate and impure, public health engineering minister Gautam Deb said.

 The Burdwan administration and the government had been facing the peoples wrath for their failure to provide safe drinking water.

 Prabir Dutta, the chief engineer in Debs department, said: After a survey, we found that the only way to solve the crisis was to filter water deposited in the mines. We hope to finish the project in a year.

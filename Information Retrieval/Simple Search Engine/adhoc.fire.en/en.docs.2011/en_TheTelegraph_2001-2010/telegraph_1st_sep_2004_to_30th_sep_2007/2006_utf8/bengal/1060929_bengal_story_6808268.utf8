The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Medical test kit racket busted

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 28: Police yesterday arrested businessman Govind Sarda for allegedly supplying diagnostic kits that had either been tampered with or had crossed their expiry dates.

 Sarda, a jute baron who recently ventured into supplying diagnostic kits to blood banks across the state, has also been accused of passing off pregnancy-test kits as those used to determine HIV. 

 Sarda was arrested from his Alipore residence and his associates Anand Kumar Mallu and Bimal Daga were picked up from Hyderabad. 

 Sardas offence is unprecedented, said commissioner of police Prasun Mukherjee. The kits tampered with not only resulted in wrong blood reports but could have led to a number of deaths. Now, the health department is investigating into the extent of damage caused. 

 The racket came to light while the police were probing a complaint lodged by Sarda against two of his company executives, accusing them of misappropriating money worth more than a crore. 

 The two, during interrogation, blew the lid off the racket. 

 According to the police, the businessman, who heads Sarda Group of Companies, became a major share-holder of Monozyme India Ltd, a Secunderabad-based firm that supplies medical kits, in 1994. Since then, he started supplying diagnostic kits for serious diseases like hepatitis B and C, HIV and malaria. He also provided kits for pregnancy tests.

 Sarda used to be the main supplier for nine regional blood banks, including Manicktala Central Blood Bank. He supplied several lakh kits over the past two years, Mukherjee said.

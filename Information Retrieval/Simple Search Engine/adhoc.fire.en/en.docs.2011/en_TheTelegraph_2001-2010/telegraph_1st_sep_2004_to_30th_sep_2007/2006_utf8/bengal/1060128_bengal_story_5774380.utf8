The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Chunk of ice out of blue

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta/Burdwan, Jan. 27: The sudden appearance of a chunk of ice on a playground, which some said fell from the sky this evening, set Katnabil in Burdwan aflutter.

 No one had seen it fall from the sky, but no one in the village ? about 100 km from Calcutta ? knew where it came from either. So, hundreds flocked to the field in front of a primary school within minutes.

 A local photographer, Rana Ghosh, who reached the spot around 9.45 pm said the ice had melted to a chunk weighing 4 to 5 kg. The jagged and melting piece is lying in a crater about a foot deep, he said over phone.

 District magistrate Subrata Gupta said he had not heard about any such occurrence, but the officer-in-charge of Madhabdihi police station, Sudipta Banerjee, said he had sent a probe team. 

 Burdwan zilla parishad chief Uday Sarkar said he has asked the Raina block-II panchayat samiti president to try and preserve some of it so that it can be tested.

 The weather section director at the Alipore Met office, G.C. Debnath, said: It sounds absurd. The atmospheric condition is not favourable even for hail. This cant be a meteorological phenomenon.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Rebel ultimatum to informers

 PRONAB MONDAL

 Calcutta, April 9: Barely a week before the Maoist-dominated districts are to go to the polls, CPI (Maoist) leaders sent a chilling message to CPM leaders and the administrators ? stop tarnishing our image or youll pay for it.

 The missive, a copy of which is with The Telegraph, named the CPMs West Midnapore secretary, Dipak Sarkar, and superintendent of police Ajay Nand and accused them of making false statements against the rebels.

 The Maoist message, signed by Bikash, says Dayasindhu Mahato, a CPM worker from Purnapani village, distributed pamphlets saying he had left the party a few days ago. This is a conspiracy hatched by Sarkar and Nand. They thought we would not follow Mahatos movements after this announcement and taking advantage of this, he would pass on information about us to the police and the CPM, he said.

 The state chief of the outfit, Somen, had last week said: Announcing that a cadre has quit the party is a new CPM tactic to keep watch on our activities. It will not be effective. Rather, it will force us to go for more strikes targeting informers and policemen.

 Sarkar said tonight that he was aware of being a target. I am the CPMs district secretary. So, there is nothing unusual that I should be their target, he said. 

 Nand said: I fail to understand how I am involved in a conspiracy relating to Mahato quitting the CPM. I have heard that Mahato had left the party, but I had no idea about the pamphlets. He added: I am a government servant and keeping law and order under control is my job.

 During an interaction with The Telegraph in a dingy room somewhere near Asansol, Somen had said that Mahato had identified himself as a garib dinmajur (poor daily wager). But in reality, Purnapani is a poor village and Mahato is the only rich person there. His house is well built and he travels in a motorcycle. His lifestyle does not bear out that he is a daily wage earner. 

 Several CPM leaders have been killed in Purulia, West Midnapore and Bankura over the past few years ? all after being branded police informers. CPM leaders on rebel turf now get police protection, but often shun it for fear of being singled out. 

 The top Maoist leader in the state had, however, said that whether a man is with the CPM or not does not make a difference to the outfit. Anyone can support any party. But those like Mahato work as informers in a party workers guise. Well not tolerate that.

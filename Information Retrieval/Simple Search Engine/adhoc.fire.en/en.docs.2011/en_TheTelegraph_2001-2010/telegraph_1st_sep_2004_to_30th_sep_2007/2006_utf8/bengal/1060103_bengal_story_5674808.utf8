 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, Jan. 2: Representatives from Tata Motors will meet chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee at Writers Buildings tomorrow to discuss investment in the state. 

 The companys president will have on the agenda the setting up of a vehicle manufacturing unit at Haldia or Howrah. The meeting is a followup of Bhattacharjees talks with Tata group boss Ratan Tata last year.

 Krishnagar: A Class X girl was found hanging from a tree at Bethuadahari in Nadia on Monday morning. Police said Papia Biswas, 16, who would have sat for Madhyamik this year, went to attend a dinner on Sunday and returned home late. On her return, Papia told mother Sulata that she would stay up late to prepare for her exam. Sulata was woken up early on Monday morning by neighbours, who told her that Papias body was hanging from a tree close to her house, about 130 km from Calcutta. The death is mysterious, the district police chief said. We are probing several angles.

 Burdwan: Shiuli Khatun, 16, was allegedly burnt to death by Ali Sheikh at Kashihara village in Katwa, about 180 km from Calcutta, on Monday. Police said the local youth had approached her with a marriage proposal, which her family opposed. On Monday afternoon, he entered Shiulis house when she was alone, poured kerosene and set her on fire.

 Krishnagar: The vice-chairman of Krishnagar municipality, Asim Saha, surrendered to the sessions court here on Monday. The Congress leader was wanted in connection with the murder of an activist of the CPM youth wing, DYFI, seven months ago. Saha was absconding since. He was remanded in jail custody for a fortnight.

 Girl suicide

 Krishnagar, Sept. 7: A 12-year-old girl committed suicide in Nadia today after her mother slapped her for disturbing her sisters studies.

 Asmina Khatun, a dropout, entered into a quarrel over her seven-year-old sister Asmas school books in Changu village of Nakashipara, about 130 km from Calcutta. Their mother, Amina, rebuked and slapped Asmina.

 The weeping girl found a packet of rat poison and consumed it. Asmina was taken to the Bethudahari hospital where she was declared dead.

 CPM support in quicksand

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Dec. 31: For the CPM leadership, the daring Maoist strike came as a wake-up call regarding its slipping grip in districts like Bankura, Purulia and West Midnapore.

 Political observers said the party is showing signs of alienation from its constituencies and conceding ground to the Maoists. If the alienation continues, the 2006 Assembly polls might spring a few surprises for the party in these districts.

 CPM leaders of Bankura and Purulia ? like MP Basudev Acharya, former state health minister Partha De and the CPMs Bandwan zonal committee leader Pijush Kar ? blamed police for failing to pre-empt this mornings attack.

 But state CPM secretary Anil Biswas said it was the failure of the partys own intelligence. It is our failure that we could not save our party leader despite knowing that he was on the Maoists hit list.

 What he did not say was that the party had been unable to counter the Maoists, who have been growing roots in the villages along the Jharkhand and Bihar border using a blend of ideology, articulation of popular concerns and terror.

 A large number of people in these three districts is trapped under a millstone of poverty. People do not get a full meal, mothers and children die without treatment. There are no schools for the children. 

 The portrait of a hungry household in a remote village has always come to the fore in the wake of Naxalite strikes and amid reports of their increasing influence. 

 It is the same story this time. Some of yesterdays have- nots are prosperous now but equally callous about those at the bottom of the scale. 

 Biswas said: It is not true that there has been no development work in the three Maoist-infested districts. A lot of work ? construction of roads and schools and sinking of tubewells and dugwells ? has been done over the past five years. We will mobilise public support in our favour through development.

 But villagers in Purulia were sceptical. If the leaders are moving with armed men, how can we resist the Maoists? a Bandwan resident asked.

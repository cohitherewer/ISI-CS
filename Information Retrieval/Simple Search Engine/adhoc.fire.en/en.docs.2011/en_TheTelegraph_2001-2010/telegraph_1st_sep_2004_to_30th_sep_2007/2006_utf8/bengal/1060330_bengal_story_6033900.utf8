The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Guard shortfall

 Calcutta: With 160 companies set to be withdrawn for the elections, the BSF today warned that the borders could become more porous.

 Director-general Ashish Kumar Mitra said those on border duty would be equipped with mobile patrol vans to neutralise the shortfall of personnel. 

 In keeping with the Election Commissions demands, we have decided to give 160 companies for the polls. There is no denying that the withdrawal of such a huge force would put pressure on those left to cover the borders. Well try to make up by sending reserve forces from headquarters and the mobile vans.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Raid on fake note factory

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 17: Police last night unearthed a unit manufacturing fake currency notes and arrested four persons.

 The officers from Jorasanko police station seized fake notes amounting to Rs 1.5 lakh ? all in denominations of Rs 100 and Rs 500.

 Recently, we tracked down a number of rackets involving Bangladeshi nationals and ISI agents who used to smuggle fake notes into the city. But so far we had not found any manufacturing unit, said an officer.

 The crackdown came after Jorasanko police received a tip-off. We promptly laid a trap and two of the culprits fell into it. Our proposal was that we would give them Rs 25,000 for fake currency notes of Rs 50,000 and they readily agreed, said the officer.

 The duo told the police about the manufacturing unit during interrogation.

 A team of policemen stormed the hideout on Alimuddin Street and saw bundles of fake notes and equipment scattered on the floor, said another officer. We also found a number of half-printed currency notes of Rs 500 at the spot.

 Police said the notes used to be printed with the help of silk-screen technology. The officers found liquid colours, bundles of white paper and other equipment in the hideout.

 There is very little to distinguish a fake currency note from the original, apart from the fact that the counterfeit is thicker and rougher, the police said.

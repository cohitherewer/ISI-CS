The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Probe into CU pass rate slide

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Calcutta, 

 Nov. 24: Calcutta University ordered a probe into 

 the performance of students in this years BA and BSc 

 Part I examinations hours after the results, declared today, 

 revealed a sharp drop in success rates. 

 In BSc honours, the pass percentage dropped to 78.2 from 84.95 in 2005. In the BSc general category, the fall was over 15 per cent. In BA, the honours success rate came down by about 4 per cent; 6 per cent fewer students passed in the general stream. 

 The low pass percentage in all four categories is a matter of serious concern. We were not expecting this kind of decline in performance, said Suranjan Das, pro-vice-chancellor, academic affairs.

 The Part I results under the old 2+1 year structure were delayed by about a month. It is still not clear when the results of the Part I examinations under the 1+1+1 year pattern would be announced.

 The exams had to be deferred by over a month and a half because of the Assembly elections. Also, the university was unable to marshal enough examiners.

 The university brass held a meeting with head examiners this afternoon to discuss the drop in pass percentages. A meeting with the boards of studies for all subjects has also been convened.

 A section of the head examiners felt that a change in question pattern, which laid emphasis on objective-type answers and discouraged suggestion-oriented studies, could have led to the drop. 

 Das said a quick glance at the results suggested that a large number of failures in mathematics could be the reason for the drop in BSc pass percentages. But we havent been able to identify any particular reason for the BA performance, he added.

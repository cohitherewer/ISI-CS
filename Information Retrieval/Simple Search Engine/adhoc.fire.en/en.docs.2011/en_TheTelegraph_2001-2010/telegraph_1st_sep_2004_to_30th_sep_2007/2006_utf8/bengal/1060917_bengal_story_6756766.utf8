 BRIEFS

 Islampur, Sept. 16: A cycle mechanic today saved the lives of hundreds of passengers on the Kanchan Kanya Express when, waving a red gamchha (towel), he brought the train to a halt after spotting a crack on the tracks.

 Haricharan Chouhan was on his morning walk when he saw the crack near Panjipara railway station. The New Jalpaiguri-bound train was 100 metres from the station then. 

 Calcutta: A six-year-old girl went missing from Behala on Saturday evening. Sugam Singhs father, a trader of plastic granules, said that around 9 pm, he found an anonymous note in his letter box asking for Rs 1 lakh if he wanted to see his daughter alive. The letter did not mention how and where the money was to be delivered. After questioning Sugams family members and some neighbours, police detained three persons.

 Siliguri: A rickshawpuller was arrested and two pipe guns and seven live cartridges were seized from him on Saturday. Acting on a tip-off, paramilitary force officials raided the house of Gobindo Singha, where they found a pipe gun. During interrogation, Singha said he had buried some arms at Lalijota on the Nepal border.

 Diamond Harbour (PTI): Jayanta Bhattacharya, a senior leader of the CPMs peasant wing, was killed when a matador hit a van, which in turn hit him in Rajpur in South 24-Parganas on Saturday. He was 64.

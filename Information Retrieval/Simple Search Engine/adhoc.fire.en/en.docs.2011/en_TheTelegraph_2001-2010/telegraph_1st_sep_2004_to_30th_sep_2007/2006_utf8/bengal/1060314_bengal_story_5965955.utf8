 Hoarding bar

 Calcutta, March 13: The CPM has asked its district units not to use municipality-owned hoardings for campaign.

 The decision, state CPM secretary Anil Biswas said, followed consultations with legal experts who said the 1976 anti-defacement law had overriding powers over any municipal act allowing the use of hoardings for political propaganda. The partys state committee will discuss on Saturday the alternative means of campaign .

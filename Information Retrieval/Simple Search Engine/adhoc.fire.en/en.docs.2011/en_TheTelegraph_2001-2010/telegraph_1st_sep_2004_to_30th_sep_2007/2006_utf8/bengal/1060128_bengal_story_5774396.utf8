The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Poll panel okays officer conduct

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 27: The Election Commission today virtually gave a clean chit to its observer N.B. Dhal, whom the CPM had targeted for having used a Trinamul Congress letter-head for scribbling official in-structions.

 Deputy election commissioner R. Balakrishnan said it was not unusual. 

 The observer had received a complaint from a political party and he referred that letter to the appropriate authority, he added.

 Dhal, who went to Howrah, had allegedly written to the Sankrail block development officer on the district Trin- amul units letterhead, asking him to delete names of de- ad/shifted voters and illegal Bangladeshi immigrants. 

 CPM state secretary Anil Biswas had lodged a complaint with the poll panel accusing the observer of violating rules. He had termed Dhals act highly objectionable and an example of electoral malpractice. Biswas also urged the chief election commissioner to look into the complaint and order appropriate action.

 The deputy election commissioner, however, said the observer had simply referred the complaint to an appropriate authority. 

 Dhal was one of the 19 observers who recently toured the state to supervise the revision of electoral rolls. The Assembly elections in the state are to be held by June.

 After meeting the returning officers of all districts, chief electoral officer Debasish Sen and other officials at Writers Buildings, Balakrishnan said the revised rolls would be published on February 15.

 In the face of a flurry of Opposition complaints against the state administration, the Election Commission has apparently taken a tough stand on irregularities in the poll process and presence of a large number of bogus voters on the electoral rolls. 

 Cautioning against dereliction of duty by polling personnel, Balakrishnan today said action has already been taken against some officials and it is a continuous process. 

 The commission, he added, would prepare a database of polling personnel, their duties and responsibilities and mode of deployment, which would be monitored regularly.

 Our emphasis will be on management of polling staff and the EC (Election Commission) will consistently and thoroughly monitor the entire process, he said.

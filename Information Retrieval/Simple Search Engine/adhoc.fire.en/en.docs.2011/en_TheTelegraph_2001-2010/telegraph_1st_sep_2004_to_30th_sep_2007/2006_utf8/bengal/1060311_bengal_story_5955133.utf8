The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, March 10: The public accounts committee has rapped the public works department for paying more to contractors by mistake and irregularities in the use of cars.

 The panel headed by Trinamul Congress MLA Saugata Roy, which submitted its 2005-2006 report today, has said that PWD paid contractors about Rs 5.47 crore in excess and hired cars for use of officers not entitled to them.

 Calcutta: The high court has approved the no-confidence motion tabled by the Opposition in Maldas Englishbazar municipality against its Left Front chairman. The front constituted the board with 12 members six months ago after an Opposition member voted in favour of its chairman candidate, Nihar Ghosh. Recently, a united Opposition ? Congress, Trinamul and BJP ? moved the no-confidence motion that the front challenged in court.

 Durgapur: Two boys aged about 12 were killed on Friday evening when hit by a speeding minibus that was trying to overtake another on the same route. Police said Bijoy Roy and Sheikh Chand were cycling to a tuition class when hit at the Secondary Rd crossing in the heart of the town, 200 km from Calcutta.

 IIT muscle for ageing railway bridges 

 - Team 

 led by professor gets build- amp;-protect assignment 

 NARESH JANA

 Midnapore, Oct. 4: IIT Kharagpur will help Indian Railways protect 1.2 lakh bridges in the country and build new ones.

 A four-member team led by civil engineering professor Subhasish Dey has been set up to carry out a survey of the existing bridges and draw up plans for new ones. 

 The railways have signed a memorandum of understanding with the IIT for the project that will take about four years to complete and cost Rs 1.52 crore.

 Dey, an expert in bridge technology, had been roped in by the railways in 1994 for the protection of its bridge across the Sone.

 We are providing our expertise in three phases. In case of new bridges, we will first have to find out how their piers can be saved from scouring and landslides and set them up keeping in mind the rivers ebb and flow, said Dey.

 In case of existing bridges, Dey said, a study would first be conducted to assess their condition. 

 We will be using various types of technology to understand the conditions of the piers and other parts of a bridge. We have often seen that even if the soil is undisturbed on the surface, severe erosion eats into it underneath, he added.

 In the third phase, the experts would try to evolve a formula to monitor bridges across the country. We will store the designs of all bridges, the character of the soil and rivers on our computer for this purpose, said Dey.

 The technology evolved by the IIT would also help other agencies involved in construction of bridges like the armed forces and the PWD. 

 We are evolving the technology keeping the railways in mind but it will be useful for all bridge-making agencies across the country, Dey said.

 The railways have around 1.2 lakh bridges, around 80,000 of which are over 80 years old. 

 Protecting them is among our priorities. So far, we had used our own technology. But now we want to engage the IIT to do the job and construct new ones using better technology. We know Professor Dey as an expert in the field. He has worked for us before, Piyush Agarwal, the executive director of the railways Research and Design Standard Organisation, said from Lucknow. 

 The IIT team has categorised railway bridges over 50 years old as sick. 

 As part of their work, IIT experts will go to Auckland, where they will meet bridge experts B. Melville and J. Coleman, who have, according to Dey, done some of the finest research on bridges.

 Bridges in north Bengal and the Northeast deserve a close look as they are among the most damaged in the country, Dey said. These bridges in the foothills often bear the brunt of strong currents.

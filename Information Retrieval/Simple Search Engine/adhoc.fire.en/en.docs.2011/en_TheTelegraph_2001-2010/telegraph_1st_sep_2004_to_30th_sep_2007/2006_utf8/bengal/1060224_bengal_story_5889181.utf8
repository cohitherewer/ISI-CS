 Gang loots wedding party

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Feb. 23: A gang looted a wedding party in Nadia in the early hours today, beating up the people and tearing off the womens dresses.

 The bus carrying 45 people from Kalipara was headed for Goalia ? both in Hanskhali.

 At Badkulla, about 75 km from Calcutta, around 25 people stopped the bus, demanding Rs 500 from the driver as subscription for a puja. When the driver refused to pay up, around 15 gang members in their mid-twenties ? and drunk ? beat him up.

 When Sanjit Biswas of the wedding party protested, the enraged gang members climbed into the bus and started beating the passengers.

 In the melee, the driver managed to get into the bus and set off. He drove the bus, with one gang member on board, to the nearest police camp. Three other persons were later rounded up.

 Nadia police superintendent R. Rajshekharan said: We have identified the gang and its members will be arrested.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Boys shot at by bird-keeper

 Deadly allure

 Krishnagar, Nov. 10: An affluent construction businessman with the hobby of keeping birds illegally today fired his air rifle at two schoolboys who had sneaked into his compound for a closer look at a pair of peacocks. 

 Amit Pal and Sumanta Biswas, Class V students of Bapuji High School in Nadias Chakdah, about 60 km from Calcutta, had to be hospitalised.

 The condition of Amit, hit beside his spine, is said to be serious. Sumanta was hit in the leg. 

 They were attracted by the collection of peacocks, budgerigars, parrots, cockatoos and many other varieties in the compound of Ramesh Dass residence.

 On their way to school, around 10.30 am, the boys caught a glimpse of the peacocks through the grilled fencing. They climbed an iron gate and sneaked in.

 As they were watching the birds, Ramesh emerged from the house, an air rifle in hand. He fired at least 10 pellets at them, police said.

 The schoolboys fell to the ground. Ramesh opened the gate, stepped out and nonchalantly called a few youths sitting at a tea stall and asked them to take the two to hospital.

 It is apparent that the boys were shot from the back while they were trying to escape, an officer of the Chakdah police station said. 

 The youths did not realise that the wounds were caused by air rifle pellets. The boys told them what happened. The pellets were extricated from Amits back at the Chakdah State General Hospital. 

 As word spread, about 500 people rushed to Rameshs house and broke open the gate. They ransacked the ground-floor rooms of the two-storey house and threw stones, breaking windowpanes. But Ramesh and his wife had fled by then.

 Chakdah police station inspector-in-charge Sanjit Dutta said a hunt has been launched for Ramesh on the basis of a complaint lodged by the headmaster of the school. The man (Ramesh) is inhuman, said headmaster Haraprasad Maitra. 

 Divisional forest officer S.N. Pal said all the birds were kept illegally. Keeping birds in confinement is illegal. Well seize them.

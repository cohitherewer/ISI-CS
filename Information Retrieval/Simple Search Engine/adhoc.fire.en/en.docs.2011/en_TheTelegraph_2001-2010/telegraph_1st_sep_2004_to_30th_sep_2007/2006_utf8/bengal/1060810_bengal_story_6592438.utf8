 Calcutta, Aug. 9: Missed the deadline and spent all the money allocated for a project with much of the work left? Rope in the finance minister for a survey.

 Over a week after the July 31 

 deadline for the concrete makeover of the citys tram 

 tracks, Calcutta Tram Company (CTC), the transport department, 

 HRBC and Calcutta Municipal Corporation got Asim Dasgupta 

 to stare at gaping holes mid-street.

 Dasgupta, transport minister Subhas Chakraborty and mayor Bikash Bhattacharya scanned the streets late last night. At the end of it, pat came the assurance from Dasgupta by Puja, most of the work would be complete.

 Sounds fine, but if policemen out on the road are proved right, it might not be a smooth ride this Puja. 

 Except for a few stretches, most of the tracks will have to make do with patchwork, only to be dug up again after the festival season. 

 Following is a list of stretches the finance minister visited and what lies ahead.

 Mahatma Gandhi Road 

 Phase I 

 Tram tracks from the western slope of the Sealdah flyover to Purabi cinema were to be paved with concrete by now. 

 After Dasguptas visit, it has been decided this patch of Mahatma Gandhi Road would be just covered with a layer of bitumen. The stretch would be layered with concrete after Puja. This means it would be dug up again, an officer of Sealdah Traffic Guard said.

 Phase II 

 The Mahatma Gandhi Road-Rabindra Sarani intersection in the north will be left un- done. 

 The contractors claim it is difficult to complete the intersection within a short period of time. So, expect waterlogging at the intersection, which will disrupt traffic, said an officer of the Jorabagan Traffic Guard.

 Phase III

 The junction of MG Road and Strand Road has been left uncovered and has not been concretised. It was decided that this part would be done up after Puja. This means traffic heading towards MG Road from Howrah Bridge will suffer. Besides, talks are on to start tramcars on MG Road. This will make matters more difficult, said an officer. 

 Rabindra Sarani 

 The 1.5-km stretch between Chitpur and Ganesh Talkies will be concretised by Puja. But the area between Sovabazar and Ganesh Talkies will be taken up after Puja because the work cant be completed within a short time.

 Nirmal Chunder Street 

 The HRBC contractors tasked to concretise tram tracks on this road have been asked to deliver by August 31 instead of September 10. Officials apparently want to ensure that comrades turning up for the September 1 Left Front peace rally dont face hurdles while walking down this stretch connecting BB Ganguly Street and SN Banerjee Road.

 Last word: We are not going by deadlines or specific dates. Whatever can be done will be completed by Puja. The rest will be taken up after Puja, said Rajdeo Gowala, the chairman of CTC.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Bank manager in loan fraud net

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Barasat, June 4: A manager of a nationalised bank and its lawyer were arrested last night in connection with a home loan fraud on the outskirts of Calcutta, where real estate is booming and hundreds queue up for funds every day.

 Sachindranath Hazra, a senior manager, and Asim Dutta, a lawyer with the Barasat branch of Allahabad Bank, were arrested on charges of cheating and criminal conspiracy, North 24-Parganas superintendent of police Praveen Kumar said today.

 Hazra and Dutta have been accused of granting home loans on the basis of forged documents.

 On Monday, Aloke Ghosal, Amiya Ghosal and Pranab Dutta, who had taken loans, Gita Roy Biswas and Tushar Hazra, who posed as promoters, and their agent Arup Banerjee were arrested. The police stumb-led upon the nexus between the bank officials and Roy Biswas while questioning them.

 Hazra had sanctioned loans worth Rs 16.7 lakh though he knew the documents were fake. In his report, he said the apartment was ready but, in reality, nothing had come up on the site. Dutta had roped in manager Hazra and helped the promoter and her accomplices to process the documents as he was aware of the formalities for getting the loan, Kumar said. 

 The racket came to light following a complaint from the chief manager of the bank, Dinesh Kumar. He suspected foul play by a section of bank officials in the way the documents were processed. We found that the plot (on which the apartment building was to come up) had not been sold to any promoter, said an investigating officer. 

 Wiser after the crime, the police have decided to bring banks in the Barasat-Barrackpore belt under the scanner. 

 Their mode of operation is simple, one person poses as promoter and some others as home loan applicants. They promise a share of the money to bank officials who can be lured and get fake documents prepared, said S.M.H. Meerz, the Barasat subdivisional police officer. 

 The money is invested in other businesses, the police said. The home loan is repaid in due time. Since it is the cheapest loan available, the racketeers can make a neat game.

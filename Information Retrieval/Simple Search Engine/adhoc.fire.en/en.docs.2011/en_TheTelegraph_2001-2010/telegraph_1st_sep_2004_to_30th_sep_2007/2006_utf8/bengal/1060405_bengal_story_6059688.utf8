The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Cong soldiers send Delhi brass scurrying

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, April 4: Rattled by regular reports of resentment in the party over distribution of Assembly tickets, Margaret Alva, the AICC general secre- tary in charge of Bengal, is rushing to Calcutta.

 We cannot tolerate regular demonstrations at the Bengal Congress headquarters. The candidates were finalised after consultations with senior state leaders, an AICC office-bearer said over the phone from Delhi this afternoon. 

 But dissent in the Congress was today not limited to Calcutta. Adhir Chowdhury, its Behrampore MP, lashed out at the state leaders for re-nominating three legislators ? Atish Sinha, Mayarani Pal and Niamat Sheikh ? from Kandi, Behrampore and Hariharpara.

 None of them had rallied with Chowdhurys supporters when he was arrested in connection with a double murder. Their re-nomination is an insult to the Congress workers of Murshidabad, the MP said.

 Since the AICC began naming candidates, Congress supporters have virtually taken over the state unit headquarters in Calcutta. A group from Nadanghat in Burdwan staged a sit-in at Bidhan Bhavan today because the seat has gone to an ally. 

 Yesterday, party workers from Jorasanko protested because Manoj Poddar, who had lost the 2001 polls, was not given a ticket. On Sunday, a group from Garden Reach shouted slogans when state party chief Pranab Mukherjee arrived.

 Things have come to such a pass that policemen have been deployed. Demonstrations are taking place almost daily despite our efforts to choose nominees on the basis of consensus., said Pradip Bhattacharya, the state party working president. He said a report on the developments would be placed before Alva when she arrives here on Thursday. 

 The AICC today named Om Prakash Mishra, a Jadavpur University teacher, as its candidate for Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees Jadavpur seat.

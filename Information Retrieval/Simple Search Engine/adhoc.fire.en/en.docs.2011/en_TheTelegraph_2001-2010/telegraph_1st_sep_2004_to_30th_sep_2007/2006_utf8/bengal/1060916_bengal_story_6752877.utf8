The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Calcuttan in border race

 SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE

 Bongaon, Sept. 15: The contest between Trinamuls outsider and CPMs son of the soil has livened the fight here in North 24-Parganas, an Assembly seat that the Opposition snatched from the CPM in May.

 The CPM has campaigned hard on the plank that Saugata Roy, the babu from upscale Lake Gardens in south Calcutta, has set up base in this border area, 80 km from home, to become an MLA again.

 Roy admitted that his residential address has been the talking point. The CPM doesnt have anything else to say against me. But the voters know that a party can field a candidate from anywhere. 

 Trinamuls Bhupen Seth, who won the seat several times in the past as a Congress candidate, wrested the seat from CPM in 2006. He died days after the results were announced.

 Trinamul fielded Roy he lost the May polls from Dhakuria denying a ticket to Seths son, who filed his nomination as an Independent in protest and then pulled out.

 Bhupenbabu was a gentleman and used to hear out peoples complaints. Saugata Roy cant do that, said a CPM zonal committee leader.

 That is the vein in which all Left campaigners have spoken, including chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, who told a rally: Please do not vote for a candidate who stays so far away.

 Roy tried to convince voters that it would not be a problem shuttling between Calcutta and Bongaon. Im used to travelling, he said.

 But can he be the next-door person that the CPM is challenging him to be? 

 Trinamul, which won the seat by only 3,400 votes, has the Congresss support this time. 

 Roy has said he would build a house in Bongaon if he wins. He appeared sincere when he said that. He is an educated man, said Keshab Som, who runs a cellphone shop.

 People are not so nave, said an aide of CPM candidate Pankaj Ghosh.

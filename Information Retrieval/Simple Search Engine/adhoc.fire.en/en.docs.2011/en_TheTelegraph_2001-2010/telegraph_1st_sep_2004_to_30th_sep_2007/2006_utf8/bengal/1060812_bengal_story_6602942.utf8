The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Trinamul voice in govts favour

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Sadhan Pande: On front foot

Calcutta, Aug. 11: Risking Mamata Banerjees wrath, Trinamul Congress MLA Sadhan Pande today spoke in fav- our of the CPM-led governments industrialisation drive in her presence. 

 Industry is the need of the hour and that is why we should not go against the governments move to set up new industries, the Burtola legislator said at a party working committee meeting. 

 Minutes after former Union minister Ajit Panja said Trinamul workers would oppose tooth and nail the governments decision to acquire land for industrial and infrastructure projects, Pande stood up to say: Our party will be viewed as anti-development if we continue to oppose industrialisation. We will be isolated from a large section of people in the near future. 

 All party MLAs and 20 working committee members attended the meeting.

 Winding up the three-hour session, Mamata, who sat stoically during Pandes outburst, declared that the party would take forward its agitation against land acquisition to Nandigram in East Midnapore from Singur in Hooghly and Bhangar in South 24-Parganas.

 The Salim Group has proposed an industrial park at Nandigram, adjoining Haldia.

 Asked if she was contemplating disciplinary action against some of her MLAs for going against the party line, Mamata avoided a direct answer. We have just reconstituted the disciplinary action committee. It is the committees prerogative, she told a news conference after the meeting.

 Party general secretary Sauguata Roy claimed that those at the meeting did not share Pandes views. His opinion has nothing to do with the partys decision to protest against land acquisition. 

 Pande later said: Some of our senior leaders do not understand that new industries will create job opportunities. 

 On Wednesday, he criticised Partha Chatterjee for not relinquishing the leader of the Opposition status given to him by the Speaker conditionally. 

 Pande also refused to resign as chairman of the Assembly standing committee on labour. Mamata had wanted the resignation to protest against the Speakers directive that Chatterjee would be stripped of his status unless Trinamul wins the Bongaon bypoll and takes its tally of MLAs to 30. 

 Two others, Dinesh Bajaj and Sital Sardar, also standing committee chairmen, had also said they would not resign.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Another escape after explosion

 PRONAB MONDAL

 Calcutta, Sept. 22: Deputy superintendent of police Shyam Singh, who survived the explosion narrowly, had another close shave here in the city last night because of his superiors callousness. 

 Singh was sent to a south Calcutta hospital from Midnapore along with a sub-inspector who had visited the city only twice before and had little idea about where to get what.

 Rajeswar Chowdhury was not even provided a set of phone numbers where he could call for help.

 Asked to fetch three units of blood past midnight, he was at a loss.

 Singh, who had sustained splinter injuries all over his body, had been operated upon once in Midnapore, but had to undergo a more complicated procedure in Calcutta as several splinters were still lodged inside, one 5 mm from his heart. Two others were planted on the outer surface of the intestine and in the abdomen. 

 No other policeman was present in the nursing home and there was no vehicle to take Chowdhury to a blood bank.

 The sub-inspector from Sabong in West Midnapore, who was posted in the Midnapore police lines recently, reached the nursing home with Singh around 9 pm in an ambulance that went back immediately.

 I was totally confused. I had to arrange three bottles of B+ by 4 am for Sirs operation. I know no one in this city, said Chowdhury, in his mid 20s. 

 A journalist, who was at the hospital to see a wounded colleagues, saved the sub-inspector, Singh and the police, already accused of being callous at work. 

 Chowdhury got the mobile number of N.D. Paul, the Alipore police station officer-in-charge, around two in the morning. The officer was prompt. He (the OC) told me to come to the police station immediately, Chowdhury said. Paul rushed to office from home. 

 He not only gave me three cards to collect blood, but also asked an officer, S.K. Chandra, to accompany me to the Central Blood Bank in his vehicle. I returned to the nursing home on time, Chowdhury said. 

 Singh underwent a successful surgery, which finished around 7 am.

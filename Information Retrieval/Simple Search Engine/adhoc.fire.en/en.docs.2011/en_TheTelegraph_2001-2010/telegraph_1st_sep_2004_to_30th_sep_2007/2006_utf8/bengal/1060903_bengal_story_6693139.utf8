The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Bio bus on trial roll today

 JAYANTA BASU

 Calcutta, Sept. 2: Biodiesel will make its Bengal debut tomorrow.

 WB 25 3136, the 52-seat bio-diesel school bus, will start from Gokhale Road and travel around 20 km, covering Rabindra Sadan, Victoria Memorial and Park Circus via the AJC Bose Road flyover before returning to the flag-off point. 

 A mixture of diesel and biofuel, which is extracted from plants like jatropha, honge, jajoba and karanjiain, biodiesel is considered by many experts to be an answer to both increasing oil import costs and vehicular pollution in the country. 

 Although the Centre had notified three years ago that vehicles may run even on 20 per cent blended fuel without engine modification, virtually nothing has changed since.

 Besides reducing pollution and increasing engine efficiency, use of biodiesel on a larger scale will reduce the import cost of diesel. We hope that the live demonstration of a vehicle running on biodiesel will create awareness among decision-makers and commuters, said Swarajit Basu of the Institute of Engineers. 

 The programme is billed as a curtain raiser for a September 8-9 seminar on biodiesel to be organised by the institute. Well make the 1995-model bus run on 20 per cent blended biodiesel and the blending and filling of the tank will also be done live, auto emission expert S.M. Ghosh said.

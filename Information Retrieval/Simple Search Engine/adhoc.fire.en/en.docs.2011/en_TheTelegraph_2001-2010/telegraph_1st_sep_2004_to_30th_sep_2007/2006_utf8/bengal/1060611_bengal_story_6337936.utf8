The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Bullets fly across border

 RABI BANERJEE

 Gede, June 10: Indian and Bangladeshi border guards here in Nadia fought a mini war until early this morning, spraying 12,000 bullets at each other across paddy fields over eight hours.

 The Border Security Force (BSF) said Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) soldiers shot first after a smuggler was gunned down while trying to sneak into India. 

 An alert has been sounded all along the 2,100-km south Bengal border, from Murshidabad in the north to South 24-Parganas.

 The BDR fired more than 10,000 rounds while we fired only 2,000 in retaliation, claimed Somesh Goyel, the BSFs south Bengal inspector-general who came here, about 150 km from Calcutta, this morning. 

 The Bangladeshis posted at Thakurpur outpost of Chuadanga district stopped firing at 5.30 am, the BSF said.

 Yusuf Mandol, who was killed, was allegedly part of a gang of six carrying some 500 Phensedyl cough syrup bottles and ganja. The smugglers hurled bombs at BSF jawans when chased. The BSF shot back, but five of them gave the slip. 

 The force described Mandol, 28, as a notorious smuggler from Chuadanga. 

 Nadia district magistrate Rajesh Pandey, who visited the scene of action with superintendent of police R. Rajsekharan, said he had sent a report to chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb. Ive learnt that senior government officials are trying to establish contact with the neighbouring country to lodge a protest, Pandey said.

 The vehicle in which BSF company commander Subhash Chandra was rushing to the war zone from his office a few hundred metres away was also fired at last night. He escaped unhurt. But he would have been killed if he had not jumped out of his jeep, said S. Ramaswamy, the BSF deputy inspector-general of the Krishnagar sector.

 Ramaswamy said the BSF had tried to get in touch with BDR officers over the phone but nobody responded. Instead, they went on firing. 

 Sadhan Pal, a middle-aged farmer of neighbouring Uttarpara village, said: We were very scared. The ring of bullets was continuous and never-ending?. Many took shelter further away as some of the bullets landed on our tiled roofs.

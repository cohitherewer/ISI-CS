 US is not OK, US money is

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 3: The chief minister today sang praise of foreign capital at a party forum but with polls round the corner, could not miss out on the dig at the US. 

 Never mind that he is most likely to go there to sell brand Bengal after the elections.

 Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, also a CPM politburo member, and the partys state secretary, Anil Biswas, said they would organise countrywide protests against President George W. Bushs visit to Delhi this year.

 The UPA government has to shift its stand on the US. Otherwise, we will not support it, Bhattacharjee thundered at the Ganashakti event.

 The chief minister, after all, had to soothe the feelings of grassroots functionaries who have known the US as an imperialist evil. So, he said the Manmohan Singh government would not be allowed to continue with the (earlier BJP-led) NDA governments policy of keeping friendly ties with the US.

 Bhattacharjee also said there was no bar on bringing in US investment and technology. Industrialisation is taking place and we want foreign capital in industry and infrastructure. Thousands of youths are looking to us for jobs.

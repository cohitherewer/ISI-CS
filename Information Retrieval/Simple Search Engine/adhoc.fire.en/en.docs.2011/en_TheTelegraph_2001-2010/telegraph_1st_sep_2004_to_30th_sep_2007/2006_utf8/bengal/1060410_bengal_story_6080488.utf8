The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Blackout close shave

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, April 9: Calcutta was spared an almost complete blackout at the cost of south Bengal this evening after two 250-mw thermal units collapsed at the CESCs Budge Budge plant around 4.30 pm. 

 At one point, the combined deficit in the CESC and state electricity board- served areas shot up to 500 mw. In the peak hours, the shortfall in the CESC areas was about 150 mw. But the situation was much worse in the districts as the state board fed the CESC grid to save the city from a major blackout.

 Southern and central Calcutta were the hardest hit as the CESC resorted to rotational power cuts for about an hour.

 Power department officials said the impact of the collapse would have been much greater had it been a working day. On Sunday, the demand was much less. 

 Bengal is experiencing power cuts since April 2 when the National Thermal Power Corporation authorities at Farakka shut down a 500-mw unit and another 200-MW one because of water scarcity. 

 On April 3, Bengal narrowly escaped a power crisis after neighbouring Jharkhand started overdrawing electricity from the eastern grid to tide over a breakdown there. Jharkhand had tapped the grid following the collapse of the 420-mw thermal power plant at Tenughat. 

 Today, the stifling heat added to the discomfort of power cuts. 

 Calcutta is yet to get a Norwester this year, though there have been reports of thunderstorms from the districts. 

 We have lot of moisture and clouds over the city with wind blowing from the sea. But we need a low-pressure area over Bihar and Jharkhand to trigger a thunderstorm, an official at the Alipore weather office said.

 CESC officials said the two Budge Budge units collapsed following a snag at a 132-kv transformer. To tide over its crisis, the state board supplied about 540 mw to the CESC grid around 6.30 pm. Power department sources said the board later realised that it could not supply such a huge quantum to the CESC at the cost of the districts.

The CESC said one of the Budge Budge units was restarted 

around 7 pm.

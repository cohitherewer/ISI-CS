 HS council promises balance in papers

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 11: HS questions would be neither too tough nor too easy, the higher secondary council said today. 

 Its secretary, Debasish Sarkar, said the papers have been set in a way to ensure that students who prepare well do well. It is our duty to see to it that questions are prepared in such a way that neither are standards compromised nor do students find them tough, he said. 

 The written examinations would begin on March 17 and end on April 13. The practicals are to be completed by April 21. There will be 4,34,571 candidates this year ? 1,83,252 of them girls. 

 A hundred candidates are physically challenged. These students would be allowed an extra 30 minutes to write their answers, council president Gopa Dutta said.

 Beginning this year, the council has colour-coded question paper packets to ensure that they are not unwrapped by mistake before the day of the particular test. 

 Dutta said: We are not taking chances. We are trying to do everything to ensure that no question paper comes in contact with anyone before the day of the examination. That is the reason why we have assigned a different colour to each set.

 On March 17 for example, the colour of the question paper packets will be khaki. On March 20, they will have magenta on white and on the following exam day ? March 22 ? the parcels will be blue. 

 On a given day, all centres across the state will get a parcel of a particular colour to be opened just before the examination.

 Dutta said students admit cards have been despatched to the authorities across the state. The terms and conditions for the candidates have been outlined on the back of the cards ? no electronic gadgets such as mobile phones, pagers, digital diaries or scientific calculators will be allowed inside examination halls. They can, however, carry a simple calculator for basic operations, she added.

 The council has requested the government to see to it that all photocopy outlets in the vicinity of the test centres are closed during examination hours ? 10 am to 5 pm. 

 Dutta said: We have also requested the transport department to introduce special bus and tram services during the examinations.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Job robbed to end boycott

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Oct. 16: Seema Pramanick was today sacked as a mid-day meal cook at a school in a deal that ended a social boycott triggered by a mix-up about her husbands illness.

 Her husband, a grocer, was suffering from Hepatitis B but villagers thought that he had dengue.

 The school authorities took the decision after mounting pressure from villagers of Tungi in Nadias Krishnagunj, about 130 km from Calcutta.

 The ostracism of the family had started with villagers refusing to send their children to the primary school, next to the Pramanicks house. 

 On October 9, the villagers had marched to the school and asked the headmaster, Samir Maulik, to shut it down. 

 They alleged that Narayan was suffering from dengue and that the school should be closed or else their children might catch the disease. The villagers had also boycotted his grocery shop.

 The Telegraph had published Narayans tale of woe on October 13.

 The villagers finally agreed to have the school reopened and call off their boycott. But they insisted that Seema should not cook mid-day meals. We had to bow to the pressure, said Maulik.

 Nadia primary school council chairperson Bibhash Biswas said attempts were on to persuade villagers to allow Seema to be reinstated.

 Blood tests for Mamata

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Dec. 27: Her head was reeling and her feet were numb, but Mamata Banerjee remained dogged in her refusal to be taken to hospital as she was put on oxygen support for the second day.

 The Trinamul Congress chiefs blood samples were also sent for tests this afternoon.

 Mamata is not keeping well and her blood pressure has dropped. But she will continue her fight against the injustice meted out to farmers of Singur. She is also having breathing problems, leader of Opposition in the Assembly, Partha Chatterjee, said.

 Trinamuls Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar, a doctor, told party leaders that Mamatas pulse rate today was hovering around 53, while her BP had dropped to 80/50. I dont know how Didi is carrying on after 24 days of fasting. Her condition is worsening everyday, Ghosh Dastidar was quoted as saying by a Trinamul MLA.

 Mamatas personal physician, Shambhu Das, arrived at the hungerstrike manch around 1.30 pm to collect her blood samples, which have been sent for tests to find out the state of her liver and kidney.

 Lying on her cot at the Esplanade manch, the Trinamul chief asked party leaders to chalk out programmes on the Singur issue. All of you know my health is deteriorating. My head was reeling and my feet became numb this morning. But I am mentally strong. I will not go to hospital, Mamata told them.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 CPM lines up expose campaign

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Sept. 26: The Congress-Trinamul combine is an alliance of monkeys, state CPM secretary Biman Bose said tonight.

 Away in Delhi for most of the day to attend the partys central committee meeting, Bose said on his return here: These people (those opposing land acquisition) should be dragged by their hair and driven out of the state.

 Not all CPM leaders are mulling that, though. What Trinamul and the Congress are doing only reflects their anti-development attitude. We will hit the roads to expose the Congresss double standards after Puja, CPM state secretariat member Benoy Konar said.

 The show of Opposition unity would not hold back the government from acquiring land for industrial projects, he added. 

 Referring to Congress-ruled Haryana and Maharashtra, Konar said: The party owes an explanation why 1,500 acres of farmland was handed over to Mukesh Ambani for a special economic zone in Haryana. Why has the group been allowed to buy as much land as it wants there? Why is Maharashtra handing over 35,000 acres to the Ambanis? 

 Reacting to Sonia Gandhis opposition to special economic zones on fertile land, Konar said it would be difficult to find barren tracts large enough for setting up industry close to Calcutta.

 The CPM central committee has supported the action taken by the government in Singur. But the CPMs allies are not too pleased.

 The police interference in a democratic movement is against Left Front policy. The chief secretary had said force would not be used. The administration did not keep its word, CPI state secretary Manju Majumdar said. 

 The Forward Bloc, too, was complaining. Agriculture minister Naren De sounded more like an Opposition leader when he said: We do not want industrialisation at the cost of agriculture.

 The partys state secretary, however, said the front would stand united against the Opposition-sponsored bandh on October 9.

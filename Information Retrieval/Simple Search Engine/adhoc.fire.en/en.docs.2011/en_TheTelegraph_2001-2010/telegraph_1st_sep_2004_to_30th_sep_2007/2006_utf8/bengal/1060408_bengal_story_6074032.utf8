The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Water flowing

 Calcutta, April 7: DVC opened its tap today to water Bengals thirsting boro crops. 

 It released about 7,000 acre-feet of water from its Panchet reservoir around 6.30 pm.

 The water will be used to irrigate over 1.20 lakh acres in Burdwan, Bankura, Hooghly and Howrah. Officials said 7,000 acre-feet of water will be supplied for eight days, during which an equivalent amount from Tenughat in Jharkhand will flow into Panchet. 

 The water was released after the poll panel okayed Bengals request that it be allowed to buy water from Jharkhand. The state has also sought its permission to sink 6,000 handpumps for drinking water.

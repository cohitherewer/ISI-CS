The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Husband pays Rs1500 to get teacher killed

 MADHUMITA BHATTACHARYYA

 Lakshmikantapur, March 4: How much does the life of a 26-year-old teacher cost? Rs 1,500.

 That was all it took to murder Panchali Baidya, Nilambarpurs favourite didimoni, on Thursday morning. Her husband Lalmohan, a masala muri hawker, and hitman Doot Kumar have both been arrested. The reason for the supari killing, police said, could be the alleged relationship between Panchalis husband and her sister.

 Around 11 am, a man called out Panchali from a class full of children at a non-formal education centre in the village near Lakshmikantapur in South 24-Parganas, about two and half hours from Calcutta. He said her mother-in-law had suffered head injuries and that she must accompany him immediately. Panchali asked the kids to go home for the day and rushed off.

 The messenger, whom none of the primary-school children could recognise, was Doot Kumar, an ointment salesman who had allegedly been paid Rs 1,500 by Panchalis husband to help him kill her.

 He led the unsuspecting young teacher, mother of a nine-year-old son, down a deserted stretch till they reached a pond. Lalmohan lay in wait here, and the two men overpowered Panchali, throttled her and dumped her body in the water. A few hours later, frightened children came running back to the village with the news that their didimoni had drowned. Panchalis body had surfaced in the pond.

 She has been teaching here for years, said Aru Bibi, who lives near the centre, and at whose house Panchali would keep her keys to the school. The children havent been eating or sleeping since the news came. The whole para loved her so much.

 Police from the Mandir Bazar thana soon descended on the distraught neighbourhood. Word had spread that Lalmohan, who lived with his wifes family, had been having an affair with Panchalis youngest sister.

 After interrogating villagers, including the children who had caught a glimpse of Doot Kumar, police managed to track down Lalmohan and his accomplice on Friday. They were booked under sections 302, 201 and 34 of the IPC. They have both confessed and were produced before the sub-divisional judicial magistrates court in Diamond Harbour on Saturday. The hearing is scheduled for March 7.

 Panchali, who worked with an NGO, Haripur Amra Sabai Unnayan Samity, only spoke of her trauma to the imam of the local mosque. She had apparently asked him for a tabeez to mend her husbands ways just a few days ago.

 That was not going to be enough to save her.

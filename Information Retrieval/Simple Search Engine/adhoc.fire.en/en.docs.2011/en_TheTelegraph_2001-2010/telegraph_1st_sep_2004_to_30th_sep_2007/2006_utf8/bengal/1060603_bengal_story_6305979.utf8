The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Reliance mart worth 2000 cr

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, 

 June 2: Reliance Industries will pump Rs 2000 crore 

 into its retail business in Bengal and develop as many as 

 60 outlets by 2010.

 The company will enter into a buy-back agreement with farmers, who will sow and reap according to its specifications. The farmers produce will go to Reliances supermarkets, hypermarkets and speciality stores across the state.

 The chain of outlets will sell the agro-products to the domestic market and also export them. 

 In Bengal, the company is especially interested in potatoes, tomatoes, rice and vegetables, which it intends to supply across the country.

 Procurement would be done through 80 rural business hubs, which the company will establish across the state. 

 Facilities for related activities like collection and packing will also be set up here. 

 Reliance Retail will procure from farmers at remunerative rates. The state government wants the buy-back agreements, whether they are with individual farmers or their co-operatives, to ensure good prices for farmers, Dipankar Mukherjee, the principal secretary to the chief minister, said today. 

 The project will generate around 10,000 jobs, he added. 

 Instead of calling the new arrangement contract farming, a term political parties are averse to, the pact with the farmers will be known as a buy-back agreement. 

 Reliance officials made a presentation on the project before chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb and the other departmental secretaries on Thursday. 

 Deb has asked the company to furnish a detailed project report to the agriculture secretary. 

 Reliance Industries boss Mukesh Ambani (in picture left) will meet chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee in the city around June 20-22 and discuss the fine print. 

 Several demonstration farms would be set up to train farmers on new technology and practices in cash crop cultivation. Reliance would provide agricultural inputs, modern equipment and arrange credit to farmers at the hubs. 

 The government has promised land for the 60 Reliance outlets at reasonable prices. It will also allow the company to use its agricultural land to set up the demonstration farms.

 Each retail outlet will require around seven to eight acres. Bengal Ambuja, which is likely to partner Reliance in the project, will develop the land and set up the infrastructure.

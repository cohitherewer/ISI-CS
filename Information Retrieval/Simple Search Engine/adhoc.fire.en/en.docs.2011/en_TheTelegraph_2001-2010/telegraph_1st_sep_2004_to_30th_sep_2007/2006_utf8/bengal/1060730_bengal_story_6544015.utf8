The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Mystery among the mountains 

 - One story, several versions

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Swati Das?s parents 

 break down. Pictures by Sanat Sinha 

 Two Jadavpur University students 

 have been rescued and the bodies of two others have been 

 recovered. One student remains un-traced. An air of confusion 

 and apparent contradictions, however, envelop the tragedy 

 with different versions of what happened emerging at every 

 turn. 

 Here are some of the ?mysteries? that police are trying to grapple with:

 Bappaditya Chatterjee said that 

 around five in the evening on Friday, when he finally emerged 

 from the waters of the Sobha, he was surprised to find his 

 cellphone still functioning. 

 Police wonder how his phone could be working after the thorough soaking. 

 Even assuming that it was miraculously working, why is it that he took a full two hours to call up a friend in Calcutta? 

 Manindra Gope, a district CPM leader who had been part of the rescue team, said: ?I asked Bappaditya why he took two hours to inform Calcutta about the accident. What was he doing in these two hours? I got no reply.?

 If the five students were going 

 trekking and were members of the university?s trekking club, 

 why did they not take the university?s permission and follow 

 procedures like filling up a form before leaving for Purulia?

 Why did Subhankar Saha tell his 

 family that he was going for a holiday in Digha when in 

 fact he was headed for Purulia? What was the reason for 

 concealing a simple thing like a trekking trip from his 

 family?

 Swati Das?s body was found minus 

 clothes in the Ayodhya forest. How could that have happened, 

 especially as she was seen by the villagers of Egra, dripping 

 wet but fully clothed, in tracksuit bottoms and a T-shirt, 

 after she had emerged from the waters of the Sobha? 

 If they were going on a trekking 

 expedition, why was it that other than a tarpaulin sheet, 

 which they had used to set up a tent, no other equipment 

 was found in their possession?

 Why were they so far off the 

 usual route? 

 Local forest beat officer Partha Mahato said they were about 15 km off the trekking route when they decided to cross the river. So, where were they headed?

 Why did Swati and Arundhati suddenly 

 decide to flee into the forests all by themselves, as claimed 

 by Kaushik? What were they so afraid of? 

 Why had the five decided to go 

 on a trekking expedition during monsoon? 

 It is well known that during this season some of the stretches in the Ayodhya area can be very tricky and unsafe and the rivers swollen.

 How is it that Bappaditya has 

 given two different versions of how they attempted to cross 

 the river?

 In one, he has said they used a rope to cross it; in another he said they attempted to cross it jumping from one boulder to another. 

 ?If we get answers to even half of these questions, we would be able to provide a decent account of what really happened and how,? said Banibrata Basu, the western range inspector- general of police.

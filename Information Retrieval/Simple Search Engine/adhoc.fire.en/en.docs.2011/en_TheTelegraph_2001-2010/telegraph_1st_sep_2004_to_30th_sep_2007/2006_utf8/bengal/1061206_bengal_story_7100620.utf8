The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Dropout count: all over again

 - Disparity in state and Centres study prompts private survey

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 Calcutta, Dec. 5: A private agency has been roped in to conduct a survey on the school dropout rate in the state be- cause of discrepancies in the governments findings and the National Council for Educational Research and Trainings.

 An NCERT report submitted to the Union human resource development ministry showed that the number of students who drop out of school between Classes I and VIII was higher than what the state government had claimed.

 We want to recheck the number of out-of-school children because the NCERT has claimed that the numbers they have gathered through their sample survey have not tallied with those that we have supplied, school education minister Partha De said.

 According to the states statistics, Bengal has 6.66 lakh out-of-school children, mostly dropouts.

 The fresh study is expected to provide an accurate pic- ture of the states performance, De added.

 So far, all figures concerning elementary education were drawn up on the basis of information supplied by the district information system of education, a state body. 

 The fresh study, to begin this month, will involve a door-to-door survey. 

 Bengals performance in terms of its ability to retain students till Class VIII is dismal, according to sources in the government. 

 They said all states except Bihar and Uttar Pradesh have brought down their dropout rate to less than 1 per cent this year.

 The dropout rate between Classes V and VII is over 7 per cent in Bengal. The rate goes up to about 22 per cent as a batch of Class V students reaches Class VIII.

 A majority of the dropout students are from poor families. There is a lack of initiative on the part of the government to prevent them from leaving school, an official said.

 Since 2000 when the Centres Sarva Siksha Abhiyan was launched in Bengal the state government conducted 30 surveys and got NGOs to do 50 others to examine various aspects of the dropout issue. 

 The surveys identified poverty as the main cause for large-scale dropouts. They also suggested ways to provide support to poor parents so that they do not have to depend on their children to make both ends meet. But they often went unheeded, the official added.

 In one such survey, researchers pointed out that Tamil Nadu was able to retain all its students till Class VIII because of two reasons it started the mid-day meal scheme way back in 1972 and also provided cycles to students. 

 Remedial measures such as distributing cycles have never been adopted in Bengal.

 At the opening of a workshop on the Sarva Siksha Abhiyan in Burdwan, De today blamed teachers for the high dropout rate in the state.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Bus emptied, set on fire

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Dec. 28: A hundred-strong mob screaming anti-CPM slogans set a government bus on fire in Howrah tonight after ordering the passengers to get off.

 Police said the mob intercepted the crowded bus near Garfa bridge on the Kona Expressway. After the frightened passengers rushed out, some of the agitators lit a piece of cloth and put it into the vehicles fuel chamber, eyewitnesses said.

 Soon the entire bus was in flames. We have sent two fire tenders. The bus is badly burnt. But there has been no report of injuries or casualties, a fire brigade official said.

 Asked if Trinamul Congress workers were behind the incident, an official said an investigation is on and nothing could be said till it is over.

 The police are conducting raids, but no one has been arrested yet.

 Trinamul Howrah district chief Arup Roy said the incident, in the Domjur police station area, may have been an outburst of popular anger at the way chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees CPM-led government was playing down Mamata Banerjees hunger strike against the land acquisition in Singur.

 The Trinamul chief ended her 25-day fast at midnight on Thursday.

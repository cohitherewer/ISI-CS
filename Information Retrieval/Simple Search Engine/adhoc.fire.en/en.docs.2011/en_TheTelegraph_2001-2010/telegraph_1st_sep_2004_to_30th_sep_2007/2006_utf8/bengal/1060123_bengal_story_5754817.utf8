The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Rs 3 lakh for rescue

 Krishnagar, Jan. 22: An ayurved who was rescued from his abductors in Nadia last evening has offered Rs 3 lakh to police out of gratitude.

 On his way back from a patients house in Krishnagunj, a car intercepted M. Halsanas motorcylce on Friday morning. Five armed men forced him into it and took him to Hanskhali, 70 km from Calcutta.

 The kidnappers demanded Rs 10 lakh from the family of Halsana, 47, who has a roaring practice at Dhubulia. His brother Saroj went to police.

 The numbers from which the calls came were traced to booths between Hanskhali and Krishnagunj. By the time a police team swooped on their hideout, the goons had fled, leaving the doctor behind.

 A police officer said the kidnappers were known to him. He had treated them at some point of time or the other. 

 Halsana said: I never believed the police could rescue me. The kidnappers had threatened to kill me?. I want to reward those who saved my life. 

 The Nadia police, however, said they needed government clearance to accept the money.

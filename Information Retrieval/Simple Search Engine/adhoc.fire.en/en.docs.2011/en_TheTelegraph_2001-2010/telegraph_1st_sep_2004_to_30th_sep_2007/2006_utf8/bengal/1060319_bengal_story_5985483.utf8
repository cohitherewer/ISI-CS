The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Scan on express train yields four bombs

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 18: Four bombs were found inside a compartment of the 3147 Up Sealdah-New Jalpaiguri Uttarbanga Express this evening.

 The bombs were found in a non-AC sleeper-class compartment of the train during an anti-sabotage checking drive undertaken jointly by the Government Railway Police (GRP) and the Railway Protection Force (RPF).

 These were country-made bombs. Preliminary investigations suggest that some criminals had kept them to commit a dacoity, said Nabarun Das, superintendent of railway police, Sealdah. No one has been arrested.

 The train was standing at platform 9A of Sealdah station and was scheduled to leave at 7.35 pm. The GRP and RPF teams were jointly checking the train with the help of sniffer dogs.

 All north Bengal-bound trains are being checked specially because of threats by militant outfits like Ulfa and KLO, said Das.

 Routine checks are also being done in other important trains like the Rajdhani Express. Similar drives are also being conducted in trains at Howrah station.

 When the patrolling team reached the S-1 compartment, they found a white plastic bag under a seat. The passengers were evacuated and the anti-bomb squad was called in, which defused the bombs.

 After the bombs were found, an intense scanning of the train compartments was launched. Passengers were evacuated from the train for the operation, which lasted nearly an hour.

 The train finally left at 8.20 pm, Eastern Railway officials said.

 Apparently, a criminal gang had hid the bombs under the seat. They would have committed a dacoity after the train left the station, Das said. It is easy to frighten the passengers with such bombs.

 However, he ruled out any extremist connection. These bombs are used by common criminals and are not powerful explosives which terrorist groups use, he said.

 Security was beefed up at the station after the incident.

 Officials said all long-distance trains leaving Sealdah would be thoroughly scanned. Scanning operations will continue throughout the night, an official said.

 A search for the criminals who left the bombs has also been launched.

 Voters dead on poll rolls

 March 1: The Murshidabad authorities today suspended a village panchayat secretary on charges of enlisting names of genuine voters as dead. 

 Based on the information provided by Madhumangal Biswas, 16 genuine voters were struck off the electoral rolls published on February 22.

 Kabatullah Sheikh, Ainul Sheikh and Halema Bewa of East Maheshpur, about 190 km from Calcutta, were among those who lodged their complaint with block development officer Reshma Debnath.

 The BDOs probe revealed that the names were deleted as Biswas had informed election officers that they were dead. The subdivisional officer confirmed the finding. 

 Genuine voters were shown as dead in a motivated manner. A false list of dead voters was submitted to my office. An FIR has been lodged against Madhumangal Biswas, the district magistrate said.

 Biswas said: I depended on what the villagers told me. It was a terrible mistake. I have apologised to the DM.

 In Hooghly, the names of the CPMs Baidyabati municipality chairman, Sujit Guha, and his family members have also been struck off the rolls.

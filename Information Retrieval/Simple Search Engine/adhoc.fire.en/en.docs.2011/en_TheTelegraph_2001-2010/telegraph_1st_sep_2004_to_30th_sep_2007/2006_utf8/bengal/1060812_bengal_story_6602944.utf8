The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 New plan in rebel combat

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Midnapore, Aug. 11: In the wake of last weeks attack on a paramilitary camp in Belpahari, police in West Midnapore, Bankura and Purulia have drawn up a blueprint to strengthen around 35 camps set up to combat Maoists.

 An officer of inspector rank will be deployed to head the personnel in these camps. About 25 of them now have a sub-inspector in command, said Ashok Prasad, the Purulia superintendent of police.

 Maoist guerrillas matched paramilitary jawans deployed especially to tackle them bullet for bullet on a hillock at Chhurimara in West Midnapore, about 260 km from Calcutta, on the night of July 30. 

 Armed with semi-automatic guns, the Maoists attacked the India Reserve Battalions camp set up to pre-empt a possible bid to foil the construction of a 14-km road between Chakadoba and Kakrajhore.

 Midnapore range deputy inspector-general of police N. Ramesh Babu, who visited the Chhurimara camp after the strike, decided to strengthen the camps after meeting the police chiefs of the three districts.

 Several camps were set up on a temporary basis to keep a watch on Maoist corridors or ensure uninterrupted construction of roads and other infrastructure projects, he said.

 These camps would have been wound up after the projects were completed. But after last Mondays attack, we decided to make them permanent, West Midnapore superintendent Ajay Nand said.

 Police and paramilitary personnel engaged in Maoist combat are armed with light machine guns or AK rifles. Their camps will be fortified with more sandbags because the Chhurimara assault showed that the rebels are also upgrading their ammunition.

 Security forces have also asked for uninterrupted power supply to the camps from the government. 

 We have generators in most places. After sundown, when they start working, all other sounds drown in the din. The night the guerrillas attacked the Chhurimara camp, the security personnel realised their presence late. If the generators were not on, the rebels could have been detected earlier, an officer said.

 The police brass have also urged the government to improve roads between Bandwan in Purulia, Barikul in Bankura and Belpahari.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 BJP shies from quota promise

 Calcutta, Jan. 31: The Bengal BJP found itself caught in a cleft stick today following ally Mamata Banerjees promise of job reservation for the minority community. 

 State BJP leaders were busy distancing themselves from the plans Mamata unveiled last evening after party president Rajnath Singh slammed Mamatas mission to woo Muslims at a meeting also attended by BJP supporters. 

 The Trinamul chiefs pre-poll pledge goes against the BJPs stated opposition to any reservation on grounds of religion. Our party president was critical of Mamatas move when he met us last evening, a senior BJP leader said today. 

 However, with the elections only months away, the state BJP unit could not also afford to be seen opposing Mamata. 

 We are opposed to reservations on religious ground, but we shall not comment on Mamatas promise of reservation for Muslims at this moment, state BJP general secretary Rahul Sinha said this afternoon. 

 After a preliminary round of talks on seat adjustment with Mamata over dinner last night, Singh discussed at length the proposed reservation with the BJPs state unit functionaries. 

 Several BJP leaders today said the reservation issue would give a handle to the Congress to beat the Trinamul-BJP alliance in the coming days. However, Muzaffar Khan, a former BJP vice-president, said tonight he had switched over to Trinamul because of the BJPs stiff opposition to reservations for Muslims.

 Sick unit plots on study table

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Sept. 3: With the demand for setting up industries on closed and sick unit premises instead of farmland growing louder, the government will organise a workshop next month on ailing industries and proper use of their assets. 

 IIM Calcutta will help the industrial reconstruction department organise the programme in which the private sector and representatives of other states would be invited. We will share our experience with other states in tackling industrial sickness and the use of the sick units surplus land, said Ardhendu Sen, the department secretary. 

 The details of the workshop will be finalised after industries minister Nirupam Sen gives his approval, he added. 

 According to the govern- ments own estimate, around 41,000 acres are now in the possession of sick and closed units in Bengal.

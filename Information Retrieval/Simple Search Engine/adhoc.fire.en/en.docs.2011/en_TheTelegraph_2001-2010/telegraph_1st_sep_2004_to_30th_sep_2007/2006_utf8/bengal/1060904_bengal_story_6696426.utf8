The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Witch family thrown out of police station 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Sept. 3: A day after 65-year-old Haridasi Sardar and her family of witches took shelter in the Ranaghat police station, officials there drove them out asking them to look for shelter elsewhere.

 Residents of Balaighata in Nadia, about 60 km from Calcutta, Haridasi, her four sons and their wives and six children have all been accused of casting a black magic spell that resulted in several deaths of people and livestock in the village over the past month. 

 Today, they took shelter in the veranda of the Ranaghat block-I development office, half a kilometre from the police station, where officers said they were trying hard to reinstate the family in their village but could not allow them to stay at the police station. 

 How can we allow them to make the police station their home? We are in talks with the administration for an alternative, Nadia additional superintendent of police Subrata Mitra said.

 Hundreds of villagers dragged the 15 out of their home and drove them out of the village on Friday, obeying the diktat of a witch doctor. 

 Penniless because they were not allowed to carry anything with them, the family is at the mercy of the authorities. The police have already tried to reinstate them in their village twice and failed. 

 If we use force, the situation could turn violent. The administration is looking for alternatives, an officer said. 

 Ranaghat subdivisional officer Mezboul Haque described the situation as tense. 

 He said he had asked Ranaghat-I BDO Amit Bose, outside whose office the family has taken shelter, to find an alternative shelter for them. 

 I have told the BDO not to drive them out of the office without finding an alternative. The local administration has been asked to arrange for food for them till they are led back to the village. Where will they go if we keep driving them out? Haque asked.

 He added that the administration was trying to get in touch with NGOs and other organisations to launch a campaign in the village against belief in voodoo and black magic. We will not be able to take them back using force. We tried twice but each time armed villagers confronted us.

 A hapless Haridasi said: They have destroyed my house, my property. What will we do in the village now?

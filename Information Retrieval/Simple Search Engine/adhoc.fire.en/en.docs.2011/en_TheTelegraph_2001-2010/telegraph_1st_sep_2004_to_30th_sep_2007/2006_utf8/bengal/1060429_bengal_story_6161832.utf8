 April 

 28: Reazul Karim and Sujan Mondol were clutching 

 a piece of paper in their hands, staring in disbelief at 

 the scrawl penned hurriedly by Sonia Gandhi when they asked 

 her for an autograph.

 We had come to see the helicopter land and take off and were standing at the edge of the bamboo barricade. I still cannot believe that I shook hands with Sonia Gandhi and she even kept my request for an autograph, gushed Sujan. 

 Both Reazul and Sujan had cycled six kilometres to the South Malda College grounds to be at the makeshift helipad.

 The Congress president landed in a swirl of dust under the blazing sun at 2.20 pm after addressing a rally in Jangipur in Murshidabad district. She was accompanied by Pranab Mukherjee and Margaret Alva. 

 With thousands crowding around the helicopter, Sonia was rushed to a room in the college while leaders like Pradip Bhattacharya implored the people to stand in front of the dais.

 Mukherjee, the state Congress chief, began the proceedings, with a handful of people as audience. 

 Then Sonia took the stage and the crowd swelled. 

 In a 10-minute address, she paid her respects to A.B.A. Ghani Khan Chowdhury, the late leader from Malda, and attacked the lack of development in CPM-ruled Bengal.

 The speech over, Sonia had a surprise in store for the crowd. Instead of getting into the bullet-proof Tata Safari, she made for the barricade where hundreds of people were chanting her name.

 As she walked, sometimes stumbling on the uneven ground, the Congress president waved at the people and sometimes greeted them with folded hands. 

 Mukherjee, party leaders from Malda ? Gautam Chakrabarty, Ruby Noor, Abu Hashem Khan Chowdhury ? and the SPG personnel struggled to keep pace with her.

 Pranabda and I had a hard time given Soniajis enthusiasm. Her close contact with the crowd will help the party sweep the polls in Malda, Chakrabarty said after Sonia left for Kaliaganj in North Dinajpur.

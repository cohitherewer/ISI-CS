 CPM backs industry drive

 New 

 Delhi, Dec. 5: The CPM central leadership has defended 

 the police action in Sin- gur and backed Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees 

 resolve to have the Tata plant there.

 The police were not the attackers but the attacked, politburo member Sitaram Yechury said. Those who attacked were not villagers, he added, echoing the chief minister. There were outsiders who had come armed with bombs. They attacked the police, said Yechury, also a Rajya Sabha member from Bengal. 

 He said the state government was on the right track and that it was part of a development strategy that moves from agriculture to industry. Singur is not a case of a special economic zone. It is a case of industrialisation.

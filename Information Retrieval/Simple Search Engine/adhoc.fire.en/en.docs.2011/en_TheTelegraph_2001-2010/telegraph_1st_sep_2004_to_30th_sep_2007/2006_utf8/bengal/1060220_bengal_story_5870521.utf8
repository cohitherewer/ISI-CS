The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Woman locked up for alleging assault

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Feb. 19: Residents of a Nadia village today locked up a young housewife in her room for hours and tried to pressure her to withdraw a sexual harassment charge against a popular alternative medicine practitioner arrested last evening.

 The resident of Khajuri village had alleged that Musharaf Halsana molested her for over an hour when she went to his nursing home in Dhubulia with pain in the abdomen.

 On the basis of her complaint, police picked up daktarbabu last night and sealed his two-storey nursing home, about 120 km from Calcutta. 

 As the news of the arrest spread, about 100 villagers attacked farmer Montaj Mondals house. They dragged him out and confined his wife to her room for over three hours after ransacking it. 

 How dare you lodge a complaint against daktarbabu... We get free treatment.... He even performs surgeries without fee, the villagers told the 20-year-old housewife. 

 Some youths, however, called the police and a team from Dhubulia police station rescued her around 1.30 pm.

 Nadia superintendent R. Rajsekharan said the police had information that Halsana had also sexually assaulted other women in the past, but this is the first time a complaint has been lodged.

 The woman did not withdraw her complaint. 

 She has shown exemplary courage by lodging the complaint. Her husband was also initially reluctant to let her go to the police fearing the villagers wrath as Halsana is a popular quack, he said. 

 District deputy chief medical officer of health Mohan Basu said he had sought a report from the police. We dont recognise such alternative medicine practitioners. To us they are quacks. It has to be probed how he managed to set up a nursing home, said Basu.

 Accompanied by her husband, the woman went to Halsanas nursing home on Friday. He initially diagnosed appendicitis and asked her to get admitted to the nursing home for surgery. 

 He told my husband that a doctor from Krishnagar would carry out the operation and asked him to leave. After he left, daktarbabu told me that the pain may also be due to other reasons and that a close examination was required.

 The police said the so-called examination continued for over an hour when she started crying. Hearing that, some nursing home employees and nurses knocked on the door. The doctor walked out and the woman fled.

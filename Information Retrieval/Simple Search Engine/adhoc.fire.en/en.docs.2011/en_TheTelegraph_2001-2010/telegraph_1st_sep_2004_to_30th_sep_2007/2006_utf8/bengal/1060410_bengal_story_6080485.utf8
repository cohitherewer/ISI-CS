 CPM slams commission

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 9: The CPMs tussle with the Election Commission is becoming increasingly bitter.

 In a statement, the party politburo today accused commission officials of arrogating executive powers to themselves after the poll panel gave a clean chit to Manmohan Singh, its observer who had ordered police raids in West Midnapores Keshpur.

 The way some observers are behaving in ordering arrests, raids etc show that they are arrogating executive powers to themselves, the statement says. It is necessary for the Election Commission to clarify whether the observers have executive powers under the present law of the land to direct such raids, it adds.

 The party accused Singh of acting in a partisan manner. The observer had ordered the raids at the behest of some Trinamul Congress leaders, the CPM said, pointing a finger at Ashish Pramanik, Mamata Banerjees candidate there. 

 On what basis can the observers rely on Mr Pramanik, who is a candidate belonging to a rival party.... How can police be asked to act on the basis of an identifier supplied by Mr Pramanik? the CPM asked. 

 Pramanik had expected the raids on the CPMs local office and some of its leaders to throw up arms and ammunition. They drew a blank.

 All political parties must be concerned about the attitude adopted by the commission, which does not consider raids on the offices of a nationally recognised party instigated by electoral rivalry of an opposing candidate to be a serious matter, the politburo said.

 Three days ago, CPM central committee member Nilotpal Basu wrote to the commission protesting the Keshpur raid and urging immediate action against Singh. 

 The commission inquired into the charges and said: Distorted and unfounded allegations have been levelled against the observer, who performed his duty correctly and in right earnest.

 The commissions response, the politburo today said, was a post-facto defence for Singhs partisan behaviour.

 Last week, a Left Front delegation, including CPM general secretary Prakash Karat, met chief election commissioner B.B. Tandon and protested against some of the commissions moves and the conduct of some of its observers.

 The CPM regrets the commission has come to conclusions which are not borne out by the facts, the politburo said. 

 It accused Singh of not asking the police or the district administration to verify the charges. Instead, the observer told the SP to arrange forces... as requested by Mr Pramanik... so that the raids could be simultaneously conducted at many places.

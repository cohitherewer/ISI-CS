 Computer classes for labour welfare

 CHANDREYEE CHATTERJEE 

 Calcutta, Nov. 21: Empow-ering the working class with knowledge of computers is the best form of welfare in a technology-driven world, the Bengal government has realised.

 So, labour welfare centres in the state will impart IT training. 

 According to the plan, drawn up by the labour welfare board in consultation with the states nodal IT agency, Webel, 21 labour welfare centres in the state will offer computer courses. The programme is likely to be launched by January 2007. 

 Computer literacy has become very important to be employable and there is a demand for such courses from our contributors. So, we decided to introduce computer training in our centres, said Arun Bhattacharya, the labour welfare commissioner. 

 There are 51 labour welfare centres, set up by the government to impart vocational and other training to industrial workers and their family members, across the state. Industrial workers contribute to the welfare fund and are members of the centres. 

 But many of these centres do not function anymore and some are in derelict condition. We have chosen the functioning and the undisputed ones for the programmes, said Tamal Sen, manager, Webel Informatics Ltd (WIL).

 Initially, the courses will be conducted in Calcutta, Howrah, the two 24-Parganas, Hooghly, Burdwan, Nadia, Jalpaiguri and Darjeeling. 

 WIL, which is Webels IT education and training arm, would monitor the curriculum, recruitment of trainers, fee structure and examination process.

 All the WIL courses, from basics in computer literacy, accounting, multimedia modules and networking and Linux packages, would be offered at these centres along with other vocational courses that these centres already offer. 

 Depending on the course, the fees will range from Rs 1,000 to Rs 15,000. 

 Although the govern- ment is targeting industrial workers and their families, others will also be allowed to register for the certificate programmes. 

 WIL and the labour welfare board would together give certificates on completion of the courses and they will be recognised by the employment exchange, said Sen.

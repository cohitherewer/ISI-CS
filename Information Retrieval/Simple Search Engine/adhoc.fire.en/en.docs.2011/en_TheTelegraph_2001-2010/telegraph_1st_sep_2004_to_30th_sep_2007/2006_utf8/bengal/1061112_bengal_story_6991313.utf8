The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Eviction order to govt babus

 BARUN GHOSH

Calcutta, Nov. 11: Fresh notices have been served on nearly 200 government employees who have retired or have been transferred elsewhere but are occupying official flats in some of Calcuttas most sought-after residential areas.

 Housing department offi- cials said some 200 of them, from managers and supervisors to clerks, are holding on to government accommodation in housing estates at Golpark, Kankurgachhi, Belgachhia, South Sinthi, Ibrahimpur Road near Jadavpur and Behala. 

 One of the main reasons for not vacating the flats is their prime location. Although notices have been served on the illegal occupants time and again, they have refused to leave, a senior official said. 

 The West Bengal Government Premises (Regulation and Occupancy) Act, 1984, says government employees must vacate their flats after their retirement or transfer. 

 The move to issue fresh notices follows a four-week deadline set by the Supreme Court on November 7 for the department to file an affidavit stating the steps it had taken to evict the illegal occupants.

 The housing secretary was earlier accused of not providing details about action taken by the government. Threatened with contempt proceedings, he had to apologise in court. 

 The Supreme Court had asked all states to file affidavits on illegal occupants following a petition by a Karnataka employee who was served an eviction notice after retirement.

 We give them (retired or transferred government employees) sufficient time to look for alternative accommodation. But many do not bother to move out despite reminders, housing minister Gautam Deb said today. 

 Some of the occupants have moved court against the eviction order, he added.

 According to a government submission in the apex court, 76 unauthorised occupants had moved Calcutta High Court and obtained a stay on their eviction. 

 Housing department special secretary J.N. Bandopadhyay said over 60 families have been evicted in the past three months. It is a continuous process.

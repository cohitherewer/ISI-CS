The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 A tribute to the past through the future ? that is what Kolkata Film and Television Institute has lined up on its third anniversary. 

 Students of the institute will perform to felicitate three film greats from Bengal ? Sharmila Tagore, Sabitri Chatterjee and Aparna Sen. 

 Nachiketa will sing and Saumitra Chatterjee will recite, but the show-stealer could well be the dance programme featuring the students and their mentor, Indrani Halder. 

 It will be a collage of old Bengali film songs presented in a narrative form, said Halder, the head of the institutes acting department. 

 The narration in between the songs will be in the form of a drama. I had visualised this part as a live performance. But Chandan (Sen, another faculty member) suggested that since our students are being trained to work with the camera, this part be shot in advance and beamed between the dance items, she said.

 The proceeds from the show will go to the benefit of the thalassaemia-affected.

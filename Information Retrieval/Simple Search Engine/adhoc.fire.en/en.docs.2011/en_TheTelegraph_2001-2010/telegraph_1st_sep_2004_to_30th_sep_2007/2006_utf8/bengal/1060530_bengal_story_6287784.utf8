The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Fill the benches, Buddha tells allies

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, May 29: The chief minister today appealed to Left Front leaders to ensure that legislators attended the Assembly regularly so that it did not look deserted in the absence of Opposition MLAs.

 Opposition members are less in number this time?. Against this backdrop, our MLAs should be present in large numbers in the House so that it does not look deserted, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee is learnt to have told a front meeting.

 Front chairman and CPM state secretary Biman Bose said after the meeting the Left partners have been asked to issue a whip to all their 235 legislators to be present in the Assembly during the three-week budget session beginning June 12 without fail. 

 In the 294-member House, the Opposition has only 58 legislators. Trinamul has 29, one short of the number that would have given it the status of an Opposition party. The Congress has 21 MLAs, GNLF three and SUCI two.

 Todays move is also aimed at disciplining a section of front legislators who skip the House on one plea or the other. Speaker Hashim Abdul Halim recounted tonight that he had pulled up some of them for being absent from the House during the last session. 

 However, the House has no rules to make a legislators presence mandatory. 

 If an MLA is marked absent for 60 days at a stretch when the House is in session, the membership can be cancelled, Halim said. 

 An absent MLA, however, misses out on the Rs 350-a-day allowance.

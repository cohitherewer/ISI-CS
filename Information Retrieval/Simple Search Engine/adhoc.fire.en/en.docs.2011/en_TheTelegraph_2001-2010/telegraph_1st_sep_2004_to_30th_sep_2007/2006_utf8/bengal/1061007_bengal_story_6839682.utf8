 Air force jobs for jubilee

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Oct. 6: The Indian Air Force will go on a recruitment drive across the country as part of its platinum jubilee year, between October 9, 2006, and October 8, 2007. 

 The special drive by the Airmen Recruitment Centre, Calcutta, will be undertaken in Sikkim and Bengal, beginning in Gangtok on October 14. 

 There is a huge vacancy for airmen and thats why we are holding these camps across the country, a defence ministry official said. 

 Airmen are personnel below the officers rank engaged in various technical and non-te- chnical functions related to aircraft and equipment maintenance. The equipment include missiles, radars and other mechanical and electronic gadgets. 

 From Gangtok, the recruitment caravan will roll into Siliguri, Behrampore, North and South 24-Parganas. There is no specific target. Merit is the priority, the official said. 

 The air force imparts extensive training to airmen before commissioning them. The recruiters would be looking for technical knowhow among the aspirants. 

 Besides infusing fresh blood in its ranks, the air force is planning year-long celebrations across the country to mark the day when Indian officers were commissioned in the Royal Air Force in 1932. 

 From display of aircraft in the air and on the ground to programmes showcasing the forces achievements, the plan is matching the occasion. It will give us an opportunity to showcase our strengths and achievements and encourage young people to join the force, the official said. 

 In Bengal, the events will be held at all major air bases Kalaikunda, Bagdogra, Hasimara and Barrackpore.

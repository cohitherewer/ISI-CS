 Enter, the election boss 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Jan. 8: K.J. Rao landed in Calcutta this evening.

 The man who ensured the cleanest elections in Bihar in recent times will arrive here on a weeklong visit tomorrow. 

 Nadia has been the district most tainted by reports of fake voter I-cards and rations cards and dead voters appearing on electoral rolls.

 Over 10,000 forged I-cards were seized from Nabadwip, Shantipur and Kalyani recently and the district administration has admitted that about a lakh ration cards are false. Ration cards are a proof of identity in the absence of voter I-cards. Forged ration card surrender certificates ? showing which a person can acquire a new ration card ? also number in thousands. 

 Rao, an adviser to the Election Commission, is expected to have his hands full. 

 Nine people were arrested in police raids late last month and fake voter I-cards and surrendered ration card certificates were found.

 The Opposition parties have also alleged that several thousand Bangladeshis vote for the CPM every election and go back. Trinamul Congress district president Naresh Chaki has apparently given details of fake and Bangladeshi voters in a 150-page report that he will submit to Rao. 

 The report prepared by the Congress runs into 100 pages. 

 Well try to put up specific complaints before him. My memorandum would be probably the lengthiest but I am sure he will read it. If Rao stays here till the elections, I am sure the polls in Nadia will be free and fair, Chaki said. 

 He added that he could prove that at least 7,000 Bangladeshis vote for the CPM every election.

 Ajoy De, the district Congress president and Shantipur MLA, said: Nadia has the highest voter growth compared to the increase in population. We have painstakingly secured facts and figures for him.

 The district administration is making massive security arrangements for Rao. 

 During the 2004 Lok Sabha polls, central observer Aniruddha Mukherjee was assaulted when he went to a booth in Nadia on poll day. 

 He will be provided combat force personnel and additional vehicles. The security will be further upgraded if he wants, said district magistrate Rajesh Pandey. 

 On his arrival, Rao will hold separate meetings with all political parties. After hearing their complaints and suggestions, he will meet officers of the district election department, Pandey added. 

 CPM leaders, whom Rao will meet first, however, sounded confident. The Opposition claims are preposterous. The nine people arrested from Nabadwip and Kalyani for faking voter and ration cards are all close to Trinamul. We will present similar cases before him. We are ready to accept any officer as observer, said S.M. Sadi, a CPM district secretariat member.

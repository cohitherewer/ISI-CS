The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 After mobike chase, 3 shots

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, June 10: Two men on a motorcycle chased a trader on the Park Circus-EM Bypass connector, teeming with people and vehicles this afternoon, and shot at him thrice. 

 Haji Abdul Rezzak, who was on a scooter, lost balance and fell on the road, but that was it. None of the bullets had hit the 33-year-old and his bag, which had Rs 1 lakh and was apparently the target, was still with him.

 After Rezzak, 33, fell and a local youth rushed to his help, the goons fled. 

 The trader dealing in leather gloves was later taken to the Jamad Ali mosque on Abinash Chandra Lane where he is also the Imam. 

 A section of the residents later took to the streets and blocked the eastern slope of Bridge No. 4, bringing traffic to a halt for over 45 minutes. 

 Karaya police station has started a probe. Officers from the detective department and the special branch are also working on the case.

 Rezzak took the bridge on the way to his factory on Abinash Chandra Lane. The duo started trailing him as soon as he took the bridge on his way from the Ladies Park branch of a nationalised bank. It appears to be a case of attempted robbery with a murder bid, said Ajoy Kumar, deputy commissioner of police, south.

 The police described Rezzak as a prosperous trader who was popular in his locality and connected to a string of mosques and madarsas. 

 Almost every year he would send his parents for Haj. He had also been there once. Every Saturday, he made weekly payments to his labourers, an officer said.

 The man himself is not sure if he was the target or his bag. A call that he received on Thursday is feeding the doubt. Rezzak said: Someone called me on my mobile and abused me. I couldnt make out why. I have told the police about it.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 BRIEFS

 Calcutta: A couple of explosions outside Bidyadharpur Girls High School at Haltu, Dhakuria, triggered a scare around 11.15 am. But some from the queue summoned courage and gave the duo who hurled the bombs a chase. They were caught. Paramilitary jawans locked the two in a schoolroom and then handed them to police. The explosives, the police said, were chocolate bombs. They are banned, though more for their sound than their fury.

 Calcutta: Polling was disrupted for nearly an hour at New Alipores St Joseph and Mary School when a first-timer demanded that he be allowed to vote on the basis of his school identity card. Denied permission, an angry Nandlal Prasad, 18, smashed the voting machine. Voting resumed after the machine was repaired around 1. Prasad was arrested.

 Calcutta: The citys first citizen, Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya, was not allowed to vote on the basis of his driving licence and PAN card at Mukul Bose Memorial Institution in Dhakuria. The mayor was not carrying his voter ID and the poll officials wouldnt accept the four-wheeler permit and IT card that he produced. The presid-ing officer, however, stepped in and gave Bhattacharya the go-ahead. 

 Calcutta: A dozen people travelling in two auto-rickshaws, who claimed to be voters, were held in Karaya as they failed to prove their bona fides. IG Raj Kanojia said 265 people were arrested during the day, 198 from Calcutta.

 Calcutta: Angry villagers clashed with police in Falta, South 24-Parganas, about 60 km from here, when the parami-litary prevented them from voting around 8.30 pm. The voters, who had queued up for hours, were told it was late and they had to go home.

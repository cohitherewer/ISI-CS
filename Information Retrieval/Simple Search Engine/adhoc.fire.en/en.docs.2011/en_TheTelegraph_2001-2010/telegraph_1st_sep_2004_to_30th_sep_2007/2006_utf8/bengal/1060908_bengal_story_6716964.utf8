The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Fake-note blot on councillor

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Barasat, Sept. 7: A cache 

 of counterfeit Indian currency notes was found in the house 

 of a Trinamul Congress councillor in North 24-Parganas during 

 a raid today.

 Officials of the directorate of revenue intelligence (DRI) along with the Border Security Force and the customs department conducted the raid on the house in Bongaon, about 80 km from Calcutta.

 We assisted the DRI officials in raiding the house of Shankar Addhya alias Daku and seized fake currency notes of Rs 48,250 in different denominations from him. He has been arrested and is being interrogated by DRI officials, said Somesh Goyal, the BSF inspector-general, south Bengal.

 Another person was also detained but released after he was found to be working on Addhyas instructions.

 The cache found from an elected representative has embarrassed the Trinamul Congress in the run-up to the Assembly bypolls to the Bongaon constituency. But the partys candidate, Saugata Roy, said: This is an attempt to frame a Trinamul leader on the eve of the elections. We dont think it will affect our poll prospects.

 DRI officials said they raided the house of Addhya, the councillor of ward number 21 of Bongaon municipality, on a tip off. He denied that he had fake currency notes. But when we searched his house, we found the notes hidden behind an almirah, said a DRI official.

 Addhya told DRI officials that he acted as the kingpin of a racket that spread fake currency notes in the area.

 Trespass arrest

 Hubert Rogerio alias Gilbert Rego, said to be a US national, was arrested in Basirhat on the charge of trespassing without valid documents and possessing Rs 50 lakh worth of Iranian and US currency.

 Police are verifying whether the currency is genuine. Rogerio was remanded in seven days police custody.

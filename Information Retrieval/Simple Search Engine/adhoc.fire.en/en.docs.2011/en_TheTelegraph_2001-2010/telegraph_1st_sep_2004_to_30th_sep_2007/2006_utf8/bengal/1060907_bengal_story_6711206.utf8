The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Chinese coming with Rs 150 crore

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Onward to Bengal

Calcutta, Sept. 6: Chinese investment worth Rs 150 crore is all set to flow into a high-technology zone Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees government is going to create in the joint sector at New Town over the next four years. 

 Returning from a five-day visit to China, representatives of Bengals joint sector hous- ing companies said here today that Nanjing Hi-tech Zone, which houses cutting-edge information technology, automotive and biotech companies and Sunwoh Hi-tech System software, would together invest Rs 150 crore in hardware development units and training centres.

 To be promoted by Bengal Peerless Housing Development Company, the Rajarhat project would be called Nanjing Bengal Peerless Hi-tech Zone. 

 The tech zone would spread over 600,000 sq ft, at least half of which would be initially occupied by the Chinese.

 We will have it operational by 2009, said Kumar Shankar Bagchi, managing director of Bengal Peerless. 

 The company will also facilitate the entry of Indian companies in the hi-tech zone at Nanjing, where nearly 250,000 sq ft have been earmarked for the purpose.

 Bengal housing minister Gautam Deb, who is now in Beijing leading a five-member CPM team, also visited Nanjing to lend weight behind the Bengal delegations execution of the final agreement with the Chinese hi-tech zone. 

 A Sino-Indian centre of excellence for modern service industry will also be established at proposed hi-tech zone in Rajarhat. 

 Chinese companies want a toehold in Bengal because the state has a vast pool of skills, is strong on software and, of course, knows English, Bagchi said.

 In June, Nanjing hi-tech zone and Peerless signed a MoU in China. The September development springs from the joint initiative of the Chinese ambassador to India and the Bengal government.

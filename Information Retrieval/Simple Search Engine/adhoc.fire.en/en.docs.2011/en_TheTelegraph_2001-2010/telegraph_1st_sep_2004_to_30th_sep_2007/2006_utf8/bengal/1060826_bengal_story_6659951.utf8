The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Feast miss in protest

 Calcutta, Aug. 25: Trinamul Congress legislature party leader Partha Chatterjee boycotted a lunch hosted by the Speaker today after being told that the Speaker could not lower the number of seats required for Opposition status without the Assemblys consent.

 But after Chatterjee, also the leader of the Opposition, left in a huff, fellow Trinamul MLA Sadhan Pande stayed back for several helpings of sheek kebab, fish fry, fried rice, chicken curry and ice cream. 

 Im not a person who is very keen to attend a lunch hosted by the Speaker. I was there at the rules committee meeting, Chatterjee said later. 

 He would have been at the lunch, though, had things gone his way at the meeting. There, Hashim Abdul Halim refused to bring down the number of MLAs a party requires for the status. The figure is now 30 MLAs in the 294-member House. Trinamul is one short.

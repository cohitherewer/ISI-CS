 CPI lines up letter on Tata deal 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Oct. 15: The CPI has decided to send a letter to Left Front chairperson Biman Bose seeking details of the Tata deal.

 The decision comes in the wake of a government announcement that it would lease land at Singur to the Tatas at concessional rates. 

 Being a Left Front partner, we want to know details of the agreement. We have every right to be kept informed but are in the dark. So, we have decided to write to the front chairperson, CPI state secretary Manju Kumar Majumdar said.

 A CPI leader said the letter would also mention what he referred to as preconditions set by the company.

 But Bose said he was not aware of any preconditions. 

 If our partners demand a discussion, we can do so. But, prior to that, I will have to know whether the Tatas have talked about preconditions, the CPM state secretary said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Mom faces police truth test

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Nov. 1: A woman who came here all the way from Assam to take home her daughter, who had been rescued from a girl-running racket, has been told to prove that she is indeed her mother.

 Santi Das has no idea about how that is possible. Her 14-year-old daughter Sumita (name changed) is languishing in a home for destitutes for over two months.

 The teenager hugged her mother and broke down on seeing her. 

 But police moved court saying the woman from Assam had to prove first that she was the real mother. 

 In July, the Class VIII girl saw a young man on synthesiser in the forefront of an orchestra belting out Bollywood hits at a fair in Guwahati and was impressed.

 Sumita told him that she wanted to learn music and he convinced her mother that she could train her if she came over to Nadia, where his troupe was based. Neither the mother nor the daughter smelt anything foul.

 The teenager realised her blunder when 25-year-old Biswajit Biswas forced her to dance to sleazy numbers at a seedy hotel in Balia, Uttar Pradesh. 

 When she failed to perform well, she was sent back to Nadia. Hopeless as a bar dancer, Sumita would have been sold off to a flesh racket in Bihar had the police not rescued her from a house at Nalupur in Krishnagunj. 

 Biswajit is absconding.

 Reading The Telegraph report on her rescue in August, an NGO traced her mother to Barpeta in Assam and brought her to the Krishnagar home for destitute women on October 17. 

 The CID moved the Krishnagar chief judicial magistrates court the next day seeking the motherhood proof and praying for time to interrogate the girl. The court accepted the petition. 

 Assistant public prosecutor Bijoy Chatterjee said: The case is serious and more arrests need to be made. The CID has taken up the case because it involves kidnapping and trafficking. So, Sumita will be questioned again. Her mother, too, has to prove her identity. 

 However, the secretary of the NGO, an arm of Action Aid International, said it would be difficult for Santi, a poor widow, to produce evidence in Krishnagar to prove that she is Sumitas real mother. 

 This we feel amounts to harassment. This is one of the reasons why common people do not co-operate with the police, said J.L. Dasgupta. Weve to again send the poor woman to Assam to bring her ration card, voter identity card and other evidence, he added.

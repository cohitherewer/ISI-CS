The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Saved from street, man on road to recovery 

 - City 

 salutes Samaritan 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 14: Amal Krishna Talukdar, who was saved by a college student as he lay dying on a street surrounded by a gaping crowd, is better and has been shifted to the general ward of Medical College and Hospital.

 Doctors at the hospital today described his condition as stable.

 Talukdar, on his way to work at the General Post Office in Dalhousie last week, was suddenly struck by a massive heart attack. He collapsed on the pavement and within minutes, curious passers-by circled him. But none moved to help the man writhing in pain.

 Dinesh Chandra Das (in picture), a third-year student of Sanskrit College, was returning to his hostel when he saw the crowd and stopped. He called a rickshaw and asked the onlookers for help. But they refused, saying they did not want to invite police harassment. 

 Dinesh then took Talukdar to Medical College and Hospital, where doctors performed ECG and admitted him to the ICCU.

 We are grateful to him. He saved my brothers life and we have no words to express our feelings, said Amulya, Talukdars younger brother.

 However, when Dinesh turned up at the hospital to visit Talukdar the next day, the guards at the gate refused to let him in as he was not carrying an entry permit. 

 But Dinesh took it in his stride. Although I told them about the incident, they did not let me enter. But I understand and did not mind. They were, after all, doing their duty, he said. 

 Later, Amulya went to his hostel room and arranged for a visit. You are like a family member, said a tearful Amulya, hugging his brothers saviour.

 A week after the incident, the city that had shied away from helping a dying man heaped praise on his saviour. 

 But Dinesh, who is from a remote village in North 24-Parganas, is unaffected. I only did what my conscience told me to do, he said.

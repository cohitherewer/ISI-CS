The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Biman backs CM on colas

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Aug. 16: Left Front chairman and CPM state sec- retary Biman Bose today de-fended Buddhadeb Bhatta-charjees decision not to ban colas in Bengal until the Centre takes a final decision.

 After a Left Front meeting, Bose said nothing fatal was found in the cola samples tested in Bengal. 

 The Telegraph had reported yesterday that a confidential pollution control board report had shown that pesticide residues in samples collected from the state were only marginally above permissible limits, unlike an NGOs study which had said they were way above the mark. 

 The chief minister has made it clear that nothing fatal was detected in the samples. Only contaminants present in sub-soil water or bott- led mineral water were found. However, we are waiting for the reports of further tests, Bose said.

 Three days ago, Bhattacharjee had said scattered bans by one or two states served no purpose as they (Coke and Pepsi) would leave such places and go to others.

 Bose said: Bengal cannot impose a ban on the basis of a Kerala report.

 Left-ruled Kerala had banned production, distribution and sale of Coke and Pepsi soft drinks.

 CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury, too, said: Kerala and Bengal have different perspectives. 

 But ally RSP insisted on a ban and the CPI has decided to make public the findings of another government study contradicting Bhattacharjee and Bose.

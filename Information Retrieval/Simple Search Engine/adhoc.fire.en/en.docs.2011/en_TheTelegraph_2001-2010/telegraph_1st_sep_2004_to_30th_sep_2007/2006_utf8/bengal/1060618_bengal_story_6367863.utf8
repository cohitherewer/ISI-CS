The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Petrol strike

 Calcutta, June 17: Truck operators and petrol dealers have threatened to go on an indefinite strike from next month if prices of petrol and diesel are not reduced, says a staff reporter.

 We will submit a memorandum to finance minister Asim Dasgupta and transport minister Subhas Chakraborty next week, demanding reduction of sales tax and cess. We will wait till June 30 and if we do not get any favourable response, we will have to stop operations for an indefinite period, said Raja Roy of the Federation of Truck Operators Association. 

 Petroleum dealers, too, decided to keep their outlets dry from next month if oil companies do not increase their commission and reduce the price of fuel.

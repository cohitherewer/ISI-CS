 March 1880: Lord 

 Lytton arrives in Siliguri to inaugurate Tiny, the first 

 Darjeeling Himalayan Railway (DHR) engine to ply between 

 Siliguri and Tindharia. The Tiny, when the occasion arrives, 

 can barely work it is unable to pull the viceroys 

 large entourage up the steep slope. An army of coolies is 

 pressed into action. They pull the engine and the two carriages 

 for 18 miles. Impressed by the hardy Gurkhas, 

 Lord Lytton offers a reward of Re 1 to each of them.

 Aug. 23, 2006: The 802 

 loco ran out of steam bringing the DHR, toy train to tourists, 

 to a standstill twice. 

 But none of the heavyweights on board had to part with even a paisa as the train pulled into Rongtong station (25 km from Siliguri) a minute ahead of schedule. 

 It still rocks, said a railway official as he got off the train specially chartered to mark the close of celebrations for 125 years of the DHR. 

 As a fitting tribute to the heritage-on-wheels, the Northeast Frontier Railway (NFR) today ran three vintage steam trains on three gauges simultaneously. Siliguri Junction is the only station in India where all three gauges exist together.

 As the clock struck 10.48 am, A.K. Sanwalka, the general manager of NFR, S.B. Ghosh Dastidar, member (traffic), railway board, and divisional railway officer Mehtab Singh flagged off the three trains from Siliguri. Decked up with flowers, the trains chugged out as hundreds cheered. 

 We arranged the show to promote and preserve the DHR heritage, Sanwalka said

 On the narrow gauge, the Queen of the Hills (DHRs special name for the day), ferried its passengers mostly railway officials and their wives to Rongtong. 

 On the broad gauge, a 1965-built engine brought from Revari in Haryana pulled the Queen of the Dooars till Chalsa. On the metre gauge, a 1944-built beauty hauled the Queen of the Terai to Bagdogra.

 Steam gives the real feel of a train, said broad-gauge driver Jagadish Bhagat, as he steered the regulator (steering wheel for the train).

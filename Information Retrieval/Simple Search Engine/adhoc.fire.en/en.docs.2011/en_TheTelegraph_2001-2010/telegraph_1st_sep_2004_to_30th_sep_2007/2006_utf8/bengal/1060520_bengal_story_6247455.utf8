The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Headmaster promises job for Rs 1.5 lakh

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, May 19: Faced with arrest, a high school headmaster today returned Rs 1.5 lakh which he had taken from a man promising a peons job.

 Sukhendu Bikash Pal, the head of Purandarpur Sajina Public Higher Secondary School, had moved the high court confessing to his crime and seeking anticipatory bail, but the division bench of Justices D.P. Sengupta and P.K. Deb set a condition ? he had to submit the money first. 

 The headmaster of the school in Birbhums Suri came to court with the money today.

 The judges, who granted the anticipatory bail, also directed Pal to pay Rs 10,000 to the job aspirant, Mukul Banerjee, as legal expenses as early as possible. 

 The managing committee secretary of Pals school, Tarani Chatterjee, has been accused of taking Rs 86,000 promising Banerjee that he would approve his job.

 Tapas Middya, the lawyer appearing for the state, told the court that Banerjee, 25, was desperately looking for a break. He (Banerjee) used to approach many people for a job. When he met the headmaster in February, Pal told him that he could provide him a peons job if he paid him Rs 1.5 lakh.

 Banerjee borrowed the amount from some relatives and friends and handed it over to the headmaster, who then told Banerjee that he would also have to pay money to those who would approve the job. 

 The headmaster was supposed to provide Banerjee the job by March 31. But he failed to keep his promise, Middya added.

 When Banerjee went back to the headmaster, he told him that the secretary of the school managing committee wanted Rs 86,000 for the approval. Banerjee paid it to the secretary, Middya told the court.

 In early May, Banerjee realised that the headmaster had given him false assurances and lodged a complaint with Suri police station, about 240 km from Calcutta. 

 Apprehending arrest, the headmaster approached the court. His advocate, Sekhar Basu, told the court his client was ready to repay the amount he had taken from Banerjee. 

 The division bench said: Until the money is paid, we will not grant him anticipatory bail.

 Legal experts said that though the headmaster has returned the money, he would have to face the criminal case lodged against him by the young job aspirant. 

 However, Pal can go back to the school despite the bribe charge hanging on him. Birbhum inspector of schools (secondary) Tapan Kumar Dutta said he could only initiate action against the headmaster if asked by his superiors in the school education department.

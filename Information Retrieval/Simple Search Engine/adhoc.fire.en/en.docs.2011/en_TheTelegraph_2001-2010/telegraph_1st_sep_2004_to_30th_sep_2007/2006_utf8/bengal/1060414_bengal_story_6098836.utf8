The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Clued-in cops 

 in combat 

 Young, smart and sensitised policemen battle old ghost in 

 Maoist belt 

 SUJAN DUTTA

 THE FEAR FACTOR

 Bandwan, April 13: The 

 road from Bandwan to Purulia cuts through an enclave of 

 Jharkhand?s East Singhbhum before it enters Bengal again 

 near Borabazar. In the uplands of Kasai river, the earth 

 heaves and undulates. The bed of the river is parched.

 In Bandwan, the youngish block 

 development officer, Taheruzzaman, says: ?If we could conserve 

 water, Bandwan would be a different place.?

 Taheruzzaman is from Birbhum. 

 Bandwan is his first posting as BDO. He has been here for 

 a year and a half. In that time, he has seen the story behind 

 the dateline. 

 There is a lot on his plate. The 

 returning officer for the elections is due here in the afternoon. 

 They will have a candidates? meeting. 

 Taheruzzaman is quick with the 

 statistics: the state government has identified 4,612 villages 

 as the ?poorest?. Of these, 996 are in Purulia district. 

 Seven hundred of the 996 villages are in eight police station 

 areas from where Maoist activity has been reported, 78 in 

 Bandwan.

 In Purulia, district magistrate 

 Mukul Sarkar will give the same statistics and conclude: 

 ?So there seems to be a direct correlation between this 

 kind of poverty and this (Maoist) kind of activity.? 

 Sarkar is an alumnus of Ramakrishna 

 Mission School, Narendrapur. ?I have no hesitation in saying 

 that in our youth, our world was anti-establishment,? he 

 says. Decades later, he is administering a district where 

 the Left is confronting an old ghost.

 But there is more in Bandwan than 

 the poverty-drives-people-to-Maoism idea. If that were so, 

 vast swathes of Rajasthan or Haryana would have been coping 

 with insurgency.

 The point leads to a minor argument 

 in the chamber of the officer-in-charge of Bandwan police 

 station. ?Isn?t that just what it is?? he stresses. There 

 is a small reunion here of police officers from neighbouring 

 police stations who have come for a security briefing coinciding 

 with the candidates? meeting.

 In the five years since the last 

 Assembly poll, there is evidence of a change in Bengal?s 

 constabulary. At four police stations in Purulia, the officers 

 in crucial posts are younger and smarter and are also willing 

 to engage. And this set of officers is not of the IPS cadre.

 It?s been a tough and often scary 

 year for many of these officers. They are looking forward 

 to a vacation after the April 17 polls. That may not be 

 available easily.

 In the compound of the Bandwan 

 BDO?s office, an assistant sub-inspector is talking to a 

 deputy company commandant of the BSF from Haryana. The Bengal 

 policeman explains that Bandwan has a majority tribal population. 

 The chat leads to a discussion on the comparative merits 

 and demerits of reservation.

 In Burdwan, the ASI says, where 

 the scheduled tribes are barely 5 per cent of the population, 

 their educated are more likely to find jobs in panchayats, 

 schools and zilla parishads than in Bandwan where the Santhals 

 alone are about 45 per cent of the population.

 What this means is there are more 

 educated unemployed among tribals as a ratio in Bandwan, 

 making them ready for the picking by politics and/or insurgents 

 and/or criminals. 

 Many of the suspected Maoists 

 in Bandwan villages were earlier with the CPM. Having switched 

 sides, they can still be identified by CPM leaders. It is 

 not surprising, therefore, that the Maoists have targeted 

 CPM leaders suspected of having been informants.

 The ASI?s argument is subject 

 to corroboration because literacy levels in Bandwan are 

 among the lowest in the state. But it reveals a crop of 

 deeply sensitised policemen.

 Another officer points out why 

 Bandwan has seen so much Maoist activity. The block is hemmed 

 by Jharkhand?s East Singhbhum district on three sides. The 

 most active Maoists here are from Patamda, a village in 

 East Singhbhum. It is important for police stations on both 

 sides to coordinate. But Bengal police are convinced that 

 Jharkhand police are simply not up to the task. The support 

 for Maoists in Jharkhand villages, he says, is palpable.

 Such insights underline where 

 Bengal makes the difference. The state?s politics has ensured 

 that its administration is probably manned by a cadre that 

 is more sensitised. Whether it is the civil officers or 

 the police, they are capable of demonstrating an appreciation 

 that may not be comparable with Jharkhand, Orissa, Chhattisgarh, 

 Bihar, and, yes, Andhra Pradesh.

 Yet, there is evidence on hand 

 that Bengal?s government is passing up the chance because 

 successive Maoist attacks on the CPM have created an element 

 of panic in its local leadership. There is plenty to suggest 

 that this will translate into heavy-handed military action 

 post the elections.

 Mitsubishi incentive gets nod

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 18: The government today okayed in principle a special incentive package for Mitsubishi Chemicals and some other companies planning expansion.

 The decision was taken at a meeting of the cabinet committee on industry attended by chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, commerce and industries minister Nirupam Sen and finance minister Asim Dasgupta.

 However, the government cannot make the incentive package public because of the electoral code of conduct prevailing in the state.

 Sen said the committee had reviewed the governments incentive package to industry.

 Mitsubishi, which is planning a second phase at Haldia, had requested the government for some incentives relating to VAT and electricity duty.

 A team of top officials from the company had called on the chief minister on Thursday and asked him to look into their request.

 The company has also sought exemption on import duty on capital goods as well as some income-tax exemptions from the Centre.

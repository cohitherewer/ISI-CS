The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Born in captivity, bred in poverty 

 PRONAB MONDAL 

 Kotuchua, April 14: Five-year-old Bandiram is lean and pale. Clad in blue shorts held at the waist with a safety pin, his bare body is covered with a layer of dust ? his chin and the rim of his lips smeared with dried dal from lunch.

 Tomar naam ki Bandi- ram? (Are you Bandiram?) 

 Bandiram does not respond. He scoots into his mud-walled house and jumps onto his mothers lap. 

 Bandiram was born in Midnapore Jail on February 10, 2001, four days after Sulekha Soren was arrested. 

 She was held because her husband was a suspected Maoist. Jaleswar had gone to fetch firewood from the forest when the police raided his home in this village in West Midnapores Belpahari, about 250 km from Calcutta.

 When they did not find my husband, they dragged me along, Sulekha said.

 She was charged with nine offences, including having links with the MCC and the KLO and shifted from Midnapore Jail to Jhargram Jail and then to Siliguri. 

 To the residents of Kotuchua and neighbouring Bangbuta, Harinarayanpur, Odalchua and Garrasini, Bandirams tale stands for the way the state and its police treat them. We will never forget the period between 2001 and 2003. Bandi- ram is a constant reminder? we fully support the Maoists poll boycott, said Bhutnath Mahato of Harinarayanpur. 

 Villagers like Mahato cannot openly claim to be Maoist sympathisers. Many of them support the CPM and attend its rallies and meetings. 

 The police beat us, the government neglects us. No road has been constructed in our village in the past three decades. It takes a three-hour walk through the forests to reach the nearest town, Belpahari, said Ratan Soren of Bangbuta.

 Sulekha, then only 25, had broken down and pleaded with the authorities when she was told she would be shifted to Siliguri in connection with the KLO case. 

 Id never heard of the KLO and had no idea where they were taking me. A year after my arrest, I was taken to Siliguri and then sent back. I spent sleepless nights with my son covering him with my sari to keep away the mosquitoes in the cell, she said. 

 The police could not prove the charges. Sulekha now lives with her husband, who earns Rs 20-30 as a dailywager.

 They kept the mother and son in jail for a year and a half. How do you expect us to vote? It is better to listen to them (Maoists). At least they are fighting for poor people like us, said Budhni Murmu.

 After Sulekha returned home, people from the five villages christened her son Bandiram as he was born in captivity. Some also call him Jelu because he was born in a jail.

 The CPM would like to believe that the villagers support the election boycott out of fear. There is threat from the Maoists and also the Jharkhand Party, said Uttam Soren, a party worker of Chakadoba.

 The police, however, have now gone a little soft and are trying to better relations with the people. There was a time when the police worked differently. Now we do not go for such widespread arrests even after major guerrilla strikes, said Banibrata Basu, the western range inspector-general.

 Losing battle against apathy

 PRONAB MONDAL

 Lagadori (Banspahari), 

 April 15: Amar meyeta mone hoy vote-er 

 phal beronor ageyi more jabe...

 (I guess my daughter will die by the time the election results are out) oke ar bachate parbo na (I cannot keep her alive any longer). Jodi ora aekbar ashto... (If only theyd visited us once...), Minati Shabar is barely able to speak.

 She sits in front of her hut clasping daughter Shibani, as if trying to prevent death from snatching the three-year-old away. 

 She had sold the few titbits left at home and spent the money on Shibanis treatment clinging to a faint ray of hope ? that some politician would drop by in search of votes and offer her some money. 

 That was not to be. No politician ventured anywhere near this village, Lagadori, in Binpur Block II, inhabited by 87 Shabar families. 

 Campaigning for Mondays polls ended this evening.

 Lagadori is a village that has no water ? the only source, a mud-filled pond, is dry through the summer. Villagers travel over 8 km for a pot of water. They eat wild vegetables, rodents, and an occasional fish. 

 While her husband was gathering leaves to light a fire at a distance to smoke the fish he had caught ? the only food for the five members of the family for the day ? Minati said: I had gone to the health centre a few kilometres away. They prescribed medicines worth Rs 300 for Shibani. Where do I get the money, we cannot afford one square meal a day. My husband suffers from chest pain and cannot work. Our only source of income is collecting kendu leaves from the forest. 

 The leaves, used to make bidi, fetch Rs 25 a day.

 Kanai Shabar, too, was waiting for a neta. Neither (sitting CPM MLA) Shambhu Mandi nor Chunibala Hansda visited us. If they did, we could have requested them to pay us a few hundred rupees so that we could get some medicine to save Shibani and the rest we could use to buy food, Kanai said.

 Hansda is the Jharkhand Party (Naren) candidate from Binpur backed by the Congress. 

 No one in the village knows what has happened to Shibani. She had fever a couple of months ago. Since then, her frame has simply been shrinking. The girl is little more than a skeleton now. 

 The West Midnapore administration made an exceptional argument for the state of the Shabars. Joint block development officer Srikanta Roy said: They are not interested in becoming literate. They do not understand that it will help them earn money and overcome poverty. 

 Roys list of development work mentions 13 tin-roof houses and a mobile medical unit. 

 A little look-around revealed that 11 of the houses have already turned into rubble. They could not even withstand one monsoon. And it rarely rains here. The mobile medical unit last visited the area in September 2005.

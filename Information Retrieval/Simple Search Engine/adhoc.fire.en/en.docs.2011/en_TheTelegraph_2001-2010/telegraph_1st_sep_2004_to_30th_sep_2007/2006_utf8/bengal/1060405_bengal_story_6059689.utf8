 Bloc warrant

 Behrampore, April 4: A non-bailable warrant was today issued against the Forward Bloc nominee for Murshidabad, Bibhas Chakraborty, in connection with the murder of a party colleague last year. 

 The Behrampore chief judicial magistrate issued the notice following the statement from the widow of the slain district Bloc president, Sampad Das. Sylvia was present when Das was shot dead in the town on the night of August 31, 2005.

 Chakraborty is now the Murshidabad Bloc secretary.

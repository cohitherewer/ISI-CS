 Union leaders face wrath

 Barasat, May 20: Around 500 workers of two jute mills at Kankinara in North 24-Parganas vandalised the houses of Citu and Intuc leaders today following closure of the mills, reports our correspondent.

 The Nafarchand Jute Mill had shut down yesterday while the Kankinara Jute Mill put up a closure notice today, rendering around 6,000 workers jobless. When the leader of the CITU-led mill workers union, Mewalal Shaw, and Intuc leader Ashoke Shaw pleaded helplessness, the workers ransacked their houses.

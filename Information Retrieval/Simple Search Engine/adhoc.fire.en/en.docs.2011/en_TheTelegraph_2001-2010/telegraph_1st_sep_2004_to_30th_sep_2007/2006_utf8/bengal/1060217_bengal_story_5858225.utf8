 Teacher ties knot after groom quits

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Burdwan, Feb. 16: Twenty-one-year-old Nibedita Hazras world came crashing down last evening when she heard that the groom, who had just arrived for their wedding, had called off the marriage.

 Joydeb Dalal, a 34-year-old engineer with South Eastern Railway, said he would not be able to marry Nibedita for personal reasons. A pall of gloom descended on the Kalna Gate house on the outskirts of Burdwan town.

 Nibeditas father Uma Shankar, who owns a provisions store, said: We had already handed over Rs 50,000 in cash and ornaments as dowry. Joydeb was arrested after Uma Shankar filed a complaint.

 Later, residents approached Kundan Ghosh, a schoolteacher living in the same locality, with a proposal. He was ready to marry Nibedita if his father agreed, said Amiya Tah, a neighbour. Ajit Ghosh, also a teacher, readily agreed. The marriage took place early this morning.

 Joydeb told police that he had a relationship with a cousin.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 IOC Haldia pact today

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 26: Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) will put its commitment to a mega chemical hub in Haldia on paper tomorrow when its chairman Sarthak Behuria signs the memorandum of understanding with the state government. 

 Commerce and industries secretary Sabyasachi Sen will do the honours on behalf of the government. 

 The pact will put an official seal on IOCs status as the anchor-investor in the hub. The state government has already written to the Centre seeking clearance.

 IOC has major plans for Haldia. The investment could run into crores, said Sen. 

 The oil company plans to increase the capacity of its 6-million tonne refinery and acquire an adjoining 80-acre plot owned by the ailing Hindustan Fertiliser Corporation. It has also commissioned a study for a paraxylene unit. 

 The biggest of them all will be a new 15-million tonne refinery that Indian Oil plans in the port town. A study has been initiated to see if this can be integrated with other petrochemical units. IOC is also exploring if it can bring in a multi-national partner for a hydrocracker unit, said an official in the chief ministers office.

 Salim venture

 The West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation (WBIDC) has set up Acharya Prafulla Chandra Ray Chemicals, a joint venture with the Salim Group. It will develop infrastructure at Haldias planned multi-product SEZ and chemical hub.

 Essar chief to meet Buddha

 Calcutta, Dec. 28: Essar Group chairman Shashi Ruia is scheduled to meet chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee tomorrow and discuss some business proposals with him. 

 The group had earlier tabled a proposal for an aircraft maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) facility in Bengal before the commerce and industry department. It is planning to rope in a Singapore-based collaborator for the Rs 1,000-crore project and will need around 500 acres, government officials said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

High-cost shot of life

Two-year-old girl can live, if...

PRONAB MONDAL

 Minati Shabar with her daughter at Lagadori 

village 

Calcutta, May 12: Amar meyeta mone 

hoy vote-er phal beronor ageyi more jabe... (I guess my daughter will die 

by the time the election results are out) ...oke ar bachate parbo na (I 

cannot keep her alive any longer), Minati Shabar had said last month.

A day after The Telegraph reported how Minatis 

two-year-old daughter Shibani was shrinking without food or medical support and 

that even vote-hungry politicians had stayed away from their starving village, 

help had arrived in the form of an NGO.

The group brought Shibani and her parents to Calcutta 

and admitted the girl to SSKM Hospital.

But lack of food since birth had already taken a toll 

of the little girls health. 

The mothers eyes welled up this evening as she 

was told that Shibanis condition had deteriorated and at least 15 more vials 

of a life-saving antibiotic were needed to combat an infection. 

A single vial of the injection costs Rs 2,250, more 

than the NGO, Diganta, can afford beyond a point. 

Eto taka kotha theke ashbe (where will 

so much money come from)? Minati asked. 

The plight of the residents of Lagadori ? the village 

in Banspahari inhabited by the Shabar tribals who survive on half a meal a day 

and have to walk 8 km for a pot of water ? had appeared in the paper before the 

first phase of the Assembly polls. 

After Shibani was brought over to the city, top health 

department officials had enquired about her condition.

Shantanu Tripathi, the superintendent of SSKM, said: 

When Shibani was brought here, she was in a critical state. She was suffering 

from tuberculosis, malnutrition and bacterial infection. We formed a board comprising 

13 doctors and started treatment. She was responding and started gaining weight.

But now she needs a particular medicine which 

is costly. Shell have to be administered 15 ampoules for the treatment of 

the infection.

Sibanis father is suffering from acute tuberculosis 

and undergoing treatment at SSKM.

Utpal Roy of the NGO said: Only a handful of 

people came forward to help us treat the child. It was not adequate.

 IT venture tips

 Kharagpur, Nov. 4: Information technology minister Debes Das today said the government would take the assistance of IIT, Kharagpur, to train meritorious students on entrepreneurship, reports our correspondent.

 After inaugurating the IITs entrepreneurship cell, the minister said instead of working in the information technology sector as professionals, brilliant students from across the state should be trained so that they can set up industries and offer jobs to others. 

 Why should meritorious students opt for jobs when they have the potential to become entrepreneurs and industrialists? I am seeking the IITs help to create awareness among such students, Das said.

 The IT minister added that an entrepreneurship cell is being set up in the Jadavpur University and similar steps would be taken in other engineering colleges in the state.

 Das said employment generation in Bengals IT sector is expected to touch 1.5 lakh in the next two years. It would be difficult to manage this growth unless bright students become entrepreneurs, he said.

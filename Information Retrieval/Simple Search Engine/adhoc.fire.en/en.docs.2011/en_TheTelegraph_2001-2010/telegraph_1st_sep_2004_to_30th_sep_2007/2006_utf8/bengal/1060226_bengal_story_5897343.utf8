 UK spin to Victorias angel

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, Feb. 25: The angel atop the Victoria Memorial could be rotating again, with a little help from Britain.

 The angel, on the roof of the Memorial hall, has been standing still for more than 15 years. Britains foreign and commonwealth office has shown interest in extending technical assistance to India to set it in motion.

 The department has asked environment activist Subhash Dutta to send all relevant documents, including reports of an expert committee and those prepared by an engineer of Jessop and Company. 

 Six months ago, Dutta had moved Calcutta High Court, which asked the Victoria Memorial authorities to ensure the angel begins moving from January 1.

 In January, the authorities told the court that engineers from Jessop and Company, which had been entrusted with the task of repairing it, have not been able to ascertain why it stopped rotating.

 Dutta then wrote to British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who referred the matter to the foreign and commonwealth office.

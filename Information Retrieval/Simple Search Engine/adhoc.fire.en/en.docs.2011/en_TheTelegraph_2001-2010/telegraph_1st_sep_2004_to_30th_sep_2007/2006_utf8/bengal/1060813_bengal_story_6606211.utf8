 Health city on cards for Siliguri 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Siliguri, Aug. 12: A health city spread across 70 acres and situated just outside Siliguri is on the cards.

 State urban development and municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya today announced this after attending a board meeting of the Siliguri Jalpaiguri Development Authority. 

 It will be a health and education city spread over 70 acres, he said. We have found a plot adjacent to North Bengal Medical College Hospital. 

 The health city, about 8 km from Siliguri, will be close to a satellite township that the Siliguri Jalpaiguri Development Authority is planning to bring up. 

 We have received a number of proposals from persons attached to the health sector, Bhattacharya said. The Birla Heart Research Centre has expressed interest in setting up a centre here. There is also a proposal for a childrens hospital on the health city campus. 

 There is no medical facility in north Bengal where cardiac surgeries can be done, though we have a lot of private nursing homes and government hospitals. Bhattacharya said. The health city should address this problem. 

 The health city would also have education facilities, like courses on medicine and nursing and paramedic training. 

 Bhattacharya also said the government has shortlisted three areas for the Reliance Group to set up an agro-based retailing and trading unit.

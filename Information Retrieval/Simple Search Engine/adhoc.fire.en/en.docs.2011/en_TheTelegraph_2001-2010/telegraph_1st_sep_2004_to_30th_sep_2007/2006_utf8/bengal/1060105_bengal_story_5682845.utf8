 Night raid on Teesta Torsa

 - Marauders 

 on the move 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Behrampore, Jan. 4: An armed gang of eight youths stormed the Sealdah-bound Teesta Torsa Express at Farakka station last night and robbed passengers of cash and valuables. 

 Two army jawans ? D. Ravi and Prafulla Adhikari ? who boarded the train from New Jalpaiguri were injured when they tried to put up a resistance.

 The Ajimgunge government railway police, in charge of law and order at Farakka and nine other railway stations, carried out a night-long raid and picked up two persons. We are probing if the duo and their associates were involved in last nights incident, said officer-in-charge Amalesh Bala. 

 Police said the youths, armed with pipe guns, bhojalis and iron rods, boarded the train at Malda around 10.40. Half an hour later, when the train pulled into Farakka station, about 300 km from Calcutta, the gang swung into action, brandishing their weapons at the passengers of a reserved compartment, most of whom had fallen sleep.

 The passengers were jolted awake by the youths who threatened them with dire consequences if they did not hand over what they had. Two army jawans tried to put up a fight, but they were overpowered and wounded. As the passengers raised an alarm, the gang pulled the chain at the next station (Ballarpur) and fled under the cover of darkness, said an officer associated with the investigation.

 Haraprasad Das, who was robbed of his gold ring and wrist watch, is still in shock The youths woke me up and asked me to part with what I had, brandishing bhojalis and pipe guns. I had to give in since any resistance at that time would have proved futile, he said.

 Das, who was travelling to Khagrahat, around 90 km from Farakka, said he panicked when the youths hit Ravi and Adhikary with the butt of their pipe guns. 

 He said the two received first-aid at Ajimgunge station and were sent to Sealdah on the same train.

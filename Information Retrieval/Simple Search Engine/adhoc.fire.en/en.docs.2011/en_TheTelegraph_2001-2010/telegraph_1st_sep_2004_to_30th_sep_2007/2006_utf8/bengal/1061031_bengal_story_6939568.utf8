The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Town plan for districts

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Oct. 30: The government is mulling planned townships in each of the 341 block headquarters in the state.

 They will serve two purposes: housing villagers eager to migrate to urban areas and ensuring maximum utilisation of space.

 The plan will be discussed at a meeting of the state land use board next month.

 According to land reforms department officials, around 2 per cent of agricultural land is lost every year because of houses built by villagers. If we can convert 5,000 mouzas out of the states 42,000 into planned townships, it might save a lot of agricultural land. At present, people are building houses in a scattered way, which results in wastage of good farmland, a senior official said.

 Bengal now has 126 municipalities. Another 263 townships are coming up in areas that havent yet been notified as urban.

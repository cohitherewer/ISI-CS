The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Pay plea granted

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 12: A division bench of Calcutta High Court has refused to stay an order asking the education department to grant higher pay to schoolteachers who had completed their masters while teaching. 

 Three teachers had moved the high court challenging the decision of school education officials who refused to revise the pay. 

 Court records say Sahidullah Alam was a graduate when he appeared for the School Service Commission examination in 2000. He got a job in a North Dinajpur high school in 2001. After joining, he completed his MA in Bengali in 2003. But when Sahidullah asked for a raise, the school authorities and the district inspector of schools, North Dinajpur, refused him. 

 He moved a writ petition in the high court last year. Two other teachers also filed similar petitions. 

 The case was decided in their favour. But the education department challenged the judgment and asked for a stay, which was not granted.

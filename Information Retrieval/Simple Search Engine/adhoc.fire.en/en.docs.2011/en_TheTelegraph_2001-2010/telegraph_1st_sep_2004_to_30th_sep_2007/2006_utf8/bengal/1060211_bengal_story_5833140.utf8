 Timid girl extremist

 NARESH JANA

 Bidri, Feb. 10: In this impoverished village in Belpahari, 13-year-old Baburam Mahato was bent over a tattered history book on the floor of his hut this morning.

 Yesterday, he stopped going to school ? out of shame.

 The face of his elder sister Sulekha is now famous across the state. The teenager dressed in army fatigues was a shield for Maoist guerrillas during a shootout with security forces at Ukhuldoba forest, about 15 km from here, on Tuesday. She is in custody now.

 Picking at his right toenail, Baburam said his elder sister, whom he loved very much, disappeared about 20 days ago. 

 When he came to know what she had become, the Class V student felt so embarrassed that he stopped stepping out of his house. We came to know from neighbours that she has joined the bon party (the villagers name for the Maoists). Her picture has come out in the papers, said Baburam. 

 Sulekhas mother Bharati, who was widowed when Baburam was one, grapples with poverty and is convinced that the penury has forced the 17-year-old to join the rebels.

 Sulekha was a very quiet and timid girl. She trembled in fear at the sight of a cockroach. I cant imagine such a girl being charged with carrying arms or waging war against the state, Bharati said.

 Sulekha was five when I lost my husband. Since then, I have been struggling to make ends meet. 

 With two children to feed, she worked as a labourer during harvesting season, earning Rs 50 to Rs 60 a day. These days, health does not permit and I cant work as a labourer. I make ropes out of babui grass. It fetches Rs 20-30 a day, she said.

 Sulekha was getting increasingly impatient with the poverty. She often shouted at me demanding food. Why didnt you kill me when I was a baby in your arms? she would ask. Then one morning she went to collect firewood and disappeared, Bharati sobbed. 

 Not many days before that Sulekha had told Bharati that the day is not far when we will have enough food and money and Baburam his pen and exercise books. 

 Bharati and Baburam are not the only ones battling poverty in this pocket of West Midnapore, about 300 km from Calcutta.

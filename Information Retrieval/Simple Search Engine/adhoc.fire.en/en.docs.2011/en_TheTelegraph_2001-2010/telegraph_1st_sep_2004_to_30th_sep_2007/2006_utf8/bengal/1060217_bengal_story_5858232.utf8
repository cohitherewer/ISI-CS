 Death row convict freed

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, Feb. 16: A person sentenced to death by an East Midnapore sessions court three years ago was today acquitted by the high court.

 A division bench of Justices A.K. Basu and P.K. Deb also acquitted another person sentenced to life in the same case.

 According to legal circles, acquittal of someone facing a death sentence has not been heard of in the last 30 years.

 On the night of October 27, 2000, some persons called on Saraswati Guchhait, 37, who lived with her husband in East Midnapores Contai. When she opened the door, they poured acid on her. 

 She was admitted to the subdivisional hospital. Three days later, she requested a man, who had come to see a relative at the hospital, to write out an FIR on her behalf in which she accused Purnendu Patra and Rabin Jana.

 Saraswati died on November 23, 2000. The police started a murder case against Purnendu and Rabin. In 2003, Purnendu was sentenced to death and Rabin got a life term.

 Lawyers for the duo questioned why the trial court sentenced them on the basis of circumstantial evidence only.

 The investigating authority failed to prove the crime before the trial court, the doctor did not perform his duty satisfactorily and, moreover, the trial court failed to find out the motive behind the murder, the high court judges said.

 Life term for duo

 The high court today sentenced rebel CPM workers Anjan Dasgupta and Biswanath Pal to life imprisonment on the charge of murdering Debal Ghosh, a CPM leader of Naihati in North 24-Parganas. Bhola Kundu, Saroj Roy and Basudeb Palit, also accused in the same case, were acquitted.

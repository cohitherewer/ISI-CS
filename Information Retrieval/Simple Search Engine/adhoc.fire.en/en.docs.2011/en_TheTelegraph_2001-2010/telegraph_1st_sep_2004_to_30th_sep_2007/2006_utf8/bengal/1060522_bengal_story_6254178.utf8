 Men in mufti for motorcycle gang

 ABHIJEET CHATTERJEE

 Durgapur, May 21: A gang of four snatchers zipping around in motorcycles has forced police to set up a crack team in the Durgapur-Asansol industrial belt.

 About a dozen incidents have been reported since April and the police are sure that the gang, hooded while committing the crime, had precise information on where to strike.

 After several futile raids, Burdwan police have decided to press around 20 revolver-toting men in mufti into action. They are being posted in front banks, offices, shopping malls and other commercial centres, where people carrying large sums are not rare.

 These groups, also motorcycle-borne, will be led by sub-inspectors.

 We suspect that the snatchers hail from Jharkhand or Bihar. Two-wheelers in the bordering areas are being checked specially, said Satyajit Banerjee, the Asansol additional superintendent of police. 

 The gang, another officer added, has a wide spy network that enables it to pick targets with precision.

 On May 16, Papiya Das, 35, who was going to drop her eight-year-old daughter at school, was surrounded by the goons around 6.30 am. Two motorcycles circled her movie style at Durgapur City Centre. Then one of them rolled towards her, the pillion rider snatched her gold necklace and the four raced away. 

 Three evenings earlier, Dinesh Agarwal, 35, who owns grocery and garment stores in the Durgapur station bazaar, had lost his days earnings and a gold bracelet. 

 Around 10.30 am on May 9, four hooded men gheraoed Sudhir Ruidas, a Durgapur Steel Plant employee who had walked out of a bank near City Centre with Rs 40,000 and was approaching his car. The bag containing the money was taken away at gun-point.

 Two days before, Purnendu Roy, an employee of a private transport company in Asansol, was robbed of Rs 92,000 when he emerged from a bank. 

 The police are convinced that the same gang was at work in all the cases ? the series beginning with a heist on April 3 when four motorcycle-borne men snatched Rs 35,000 from a businessman at Benachity in Durgapur. 

 Were scared, said Biswadeep Roy Chowdhury, who owns a petrol pump in Durgapur.

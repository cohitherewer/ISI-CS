 Skeleton find starts probe

 Krishnagar, Jan. 8: Residents of Raghunathpur in Nadia dug out a skeleton by accident yesterday, prompting police to begin a fresh probe into the disappearance of a housewife six years ago.

 From the bangles on the arms, Kalo Bewa claimed that it was her sister Jogona Bibis skeleton. The police today sent it for forensic tests. We have started a murder case on the basis of Kalo Bewas statement, Nadia police chief R. Rajsekharan said. 

 Jogona, 30, went missing from her husbands house in Nakashipara, 130 km from Calcutta, in February 1999. Her husband Tazu Sheikh and Tazera Bibi, whom he had married within a month of his first wifes disappearance, were charged with kidnap. That trial is yet to begin and they are out on bail now.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Anil date with CM 

next week

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 7: Anil Ambani is scheduled to meet chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on August 18. 

 Sources said the discussions would revolve around Ambanis participation in the rail transit project.

 The younger Ambani has expressed interest in funding the Rs 2,400-crore project and tied up with French firm TGV. Ambanis company has already sent a team to Prague to assess the light rail technology.

 The state government has shortlisted Siemens and Amex, a Czech company, after floating tenders for the project. In the first phase, the project is expected to connect Panihati and Joka.

 Since we havent finalised the built operate and transfer (BOT) partner yet, Anil Ambani stands a chance. After we hear his proposal, we will take a decision, said a government official.

 During his meeting, Ambani is also expected to discuss a city project near Kalyani in Nadia. He had earlier written to Bhattacharjee seeking 60 acres for the proposed Dhirubhai Ambani health city.

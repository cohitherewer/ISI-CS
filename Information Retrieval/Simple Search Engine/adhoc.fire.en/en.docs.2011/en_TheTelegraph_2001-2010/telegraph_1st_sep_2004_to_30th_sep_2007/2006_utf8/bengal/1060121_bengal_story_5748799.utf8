The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Girl puts dad in cuffs

 Krishnagar, Jan. 20: Lakshmi Kanta Biswas, a father of three girls, was arrested today after one of them ? a 13-year-old ? told police that he had fixed up her marriage.

 Shampa, a Class VII student who would have got married tomorrow had the police not stepped in, wants to continue studying. 

 A poor weaver at Shantipur in Nadia, 70 km from Calcutta, Lakshmi Kanta could not turn down the proposal from Sujon Roy, a stationery shop owner, who initially selected Shampas elder sister Champa, 20, but changed his mind later.

 Nine-year-old Bilkis Khatun had fled home in Murshidabad last year to lodge a police complaint against her mother, who had married her off to a man almost thrice her age. 

 Moyna Bibi was arrested and her daughter recommended for a bravery award.

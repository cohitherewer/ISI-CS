 Rebel surrender shield

 Sulekha, Bimala: Cover-up 

 Jhargram, Feb 9: The two Maoist women held on Tuesday were used as decoy to help other guerrillas escape, police said today.

 The much-touted arrests of Sulekha Mahato and Bimala Sardar came after an encounter in Ukhuldoba forest in the Belpahari terrain of West Midnapore, 215 km from Calcutta.

 The two women, who were interrogated through the night, revealed that their commander Madan Mahato had first picked Sulekha ? who had joined the CPI (Maoist) barely a fortnight ago ? to act as a shield.

 As policemen and jawans of the Central Reserve Police Force rained bullets on the rebels, Madan asked Sulekha to step out and surrender, knowing that would prompt the forces to drop their guns.

 The Maoists thought that the security forces would hold their fire when the girl would walk out in the open with her hands raised in surrender, a police officer said.

 However, Bimala did not want to leave the 19-year-old Sulekha alone in the police net and volunteered to surrender with her. 

 The Maoists used the two young women as a shield and escaped when the shooting stopped, said Ajay Nanda, the West Midnapore superintendent of police.

 Senior police officials, including inspector-general, Intelligence Bureau, Sadhan Chandra Mondal, and other IB officers from Jharkhand, were present while Sulekha and Bimala were being questioned.

 The two were today produced in the court of the chief judicial magistrate of Jhargram, Sanchita De, amid tight security as the police were apprehensive that the Maoists may make an attempt to rescue them.

 Since last evening, all vehicles approaching Jhargram were stopped, searched and their numbers taken. We simply dont want to take any chances, an officer said.

 The judge remanded Sulekha and Bimala to a weeks police custody.

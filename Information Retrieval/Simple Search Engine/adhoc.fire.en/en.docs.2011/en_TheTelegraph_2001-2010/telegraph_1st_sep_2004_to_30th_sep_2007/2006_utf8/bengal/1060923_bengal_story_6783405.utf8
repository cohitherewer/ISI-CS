The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, Sept. 22: The BSF today said it will take up with chief secretary A.K. Deb North 24-Parganas polices reluctance to arrest alleged Bangladeshi infiltrators. 

 We detained 900 people from the border in the past year, but the local police refused to take them into their custody pleading that jails were overcrowded, BSFs south Bengal inspector-general Somesh Goyal said. The BSF is not empowered to arrest the intruders. Our job is just to detain them, Goyal said.

 Calcutta: Around 550 g of heroin was seized from two persons in Shantipur on Thursday night. They raised the polices suspicion by driving at a break-neck speed on spotting a patrol van, about 70 km from Calcutta.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Good cop tag gets bombed out

 SUBHENDU RAY

 Siliguri, Aug. 25: Once 

 a hero, now villain. 

 CID constable Biswajit Majumder was known to residents here as the man who busted fake currency rackets and persuaded KLO militants to surrender during his stint with the Intelligence Bureau (IB) two years ago.

 But the involvement of 37-year-old Majumder and his colleague Kailash Roy in planting explosives has left senior police officers stunned. The role of the two constables two others were also there in the Maruti van that was intercepted at NJP has also shaken the CID headquarters in Calcutta. 

 So shocked was the headquarters that immediately after the duos arrest, deputy inspector-general P. Ravi boarded a Bagdogra-bound flight and arrived here this afternoon. Ravi, sources said, questioned the constables at the NJP police outpost. 

 The interrogation, in which Jalpaiguri superintendent of police Tripurari accompanied him, continued late into the night. Five others have reportedly been detained from the Alipurduar subdivision of Jalpaiguri.

 We knew Majumder as an honest and brave man. He had developed a good network when on deputation with the IB, said an Intelligence Bureau officer who is also Majumders neighbour. 

 In 2004, Majumders name was recommended for the police bravery medal.

 However, Majumders former IB colleague also said that he was accused of demanding bribes in a village close to Siliguri about a year ago. He went there to track down a fake currency racket. 

 The Darjeeling police chief confirmed that a case had been registered against him.

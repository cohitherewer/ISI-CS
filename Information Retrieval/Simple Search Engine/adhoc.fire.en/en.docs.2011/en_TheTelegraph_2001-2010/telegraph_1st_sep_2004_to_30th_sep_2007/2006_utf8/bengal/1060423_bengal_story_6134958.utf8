The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 SHORT TAKES

 Calcutta: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had a narrow escape on Saturday evening when a tree fell a couple of seconds after the chief ministers car passed Taki Road, around 50 km from the city. 

 Bhattacharjee was caught in the rain and thunderstorms that lashed the city and other parts of the state on Saurday. He was returning from a public meeting in Baduria. The chief ministers convoy, however, got stuck. 

 Chinsurah: Booted out of Chinsurah, will the king of the jungle get luckier in Jagatdal? Forward Bloc candidate Naren De could not put up 40 clay lions at Chinsurahs street corners after a rap from Election Commission. So, theyre being ferried across the Hooghly to Jagatdal for party leader Haripada Biswas.

 Calcutta: The Election Commission has ordered DIG (Presidency Range) Herman Preet Singh to be taken off poll duty as a court case is pending against him. Singh is an accused in the 1993 Bhikhari Paswan disappearance case. DIG (vigilance) Surajit Purokayastha is holding charge of Presidency Range while Singh has gone on leave.

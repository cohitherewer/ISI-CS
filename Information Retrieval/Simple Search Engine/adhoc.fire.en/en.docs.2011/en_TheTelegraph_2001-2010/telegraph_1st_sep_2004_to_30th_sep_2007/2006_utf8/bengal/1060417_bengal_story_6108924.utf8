The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Most wanted, least known about

 SUJAN DUTTA

 Bandwan, April 16: Gurucharan Kisku, who left home to lead the life of a rebel, had married Raimuni Murmu of Bagdoba. 

 A woman says Raimuni did not beget children. Some one else also says so. 

 They think it is important that Raimuni did not beget a child. It is important because there are different accounts of the circumstances leading to Guras (fellow villagers call Gurucharan by that name) disappearance.

 One account is that he went to Bandwan where he was doing some kind of work and earning some money. In Bandwan town, a telephone booth owner remembers him. 

 He says Gurucharan worked for a small investment company. But there were some creditors after him and he went back to Gurpana, fell in with the Maoists and disappeared.

 Another account says Gura was disappointed with Raimuni at the same time that he got acquainted with and close to Jagori Baske, also of Bagdoba. Jagori was already with the bon party (the forest party, the Maoists). She waylaid him. 

 Yet another account says Gura was very much with the Maoists by the time he met Jagori. No one is sure if Jagori and Gura are friends or comrades or lovers or, indeed, man and wife.

 Jagoris name figures in a number of cases. She is among the most wanted of the Maoists in these parts. She is now rumoured to be leading an armed squad.

 In the camp of the Central Reserve Police Force that has come up just after Gurpana on the way to Bagdoba, inspector Prithvi Singh is in charge. The bon party had blown up the building on October 3 last year even as the police were about to move in. 

 It is a police strategy to establish as many camps as possible along the inter-state border. Almost every cluster of pucca houses on the road from Bandwan to Belpahari is a camp of the police, the Border Security Force or the India Reserve Battalion.

 Singh says no photograph of Gurucharan is available. 

 But it is his task to nab Gurucharan if he were to come by Gurpana again. Maybe he does and the police simply do not know. 

 Informants are in short supply. The Maoists have bumped off one after another. In February, for example, they killed two former CPM workers on suspicion that they had led the police to two activists Bimala and Sulekha, now lodged in the Purulia womens jail.

 We have encouraged them to set up shops near our camp but they refuse. Even to buy bidis we have to drive quite far, says Singhs Bengali-speaking aide, a constable. 

 Singh says his men of the 171 battalion B company have opened a club for the residents of Bagdoba. 

 A place where the villagers and the police can meet?

 The villagers have effectively boycotted the police. Even the gram panchayat member from Gurpana, Laski Murmu (Trinamul Congress), is reluctant to talk to the police. The villagers do not want to be seen with us, says Singh. 

 They will not meet the cops in private either.

 Why? Is it because of Gurucharan? That terrorist.

 Prithvi Singh has tried to find out from the villagers about him many times to no avail. He is from Haryana and has to rely on information from Bengal police. Is it done to call Gurucharan a terrorist?

 The inspector gets into the mood. Deep in the jungles here, he hasnt had much of an audience since he was asked to camp here in October. 

 Why do people become terrorists? Singh is now into the swing of things. 

 I was in Punjab. Do you know the agriculture director there turned into a terrorist? Why do such things happen with people who can think?

 The question is rhetorical. And terrorists always survive because they get local support, he adds helpfully.

 What else can Gurucharan Kisku be?

 In Gurpana, Gura is not a romantic figure. To the villagers, he is one of their own. 

 The police force calls him a terrorist. 

 He was so- meone who lived and loved ordinarily in his own milieu. 

 He is now among Bengals most wanted, the 21st century Maoist whose covers been blown.

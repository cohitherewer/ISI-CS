The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Stone-laying season

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Feb. 6: Elections approaching, it is time for ministers to lay foundation stones of new projects.

 But today, PWD minister Amar Chowdhury laid the foundation stone of a bridge in Nadia for the second time.

 Twenty years ago, the then CPM MLA from Krishnagunj, Ganendranath Biswas, had laid the foundation stone of the bridge over the Churni in Bazitpur, 110 km from Calcutta. But despite being the local MLA of the ruling party, he could not get the bridge constructed.

 Ganendranaths daughter Rama Biswas, the sabhadhipati of the Nadia zilla parishad, worked hard to get funds to the tune of about Rs 4 crore sanctioned for the bridge.

 Dont think that we are laying the foundation stone as elections are approaching. That the bridge will soon be a reality is the result of relentless effort of Ganendrababu. He struggled hard to make the bridge a reality but could not get it done by the government. But now his daughter has done it, said Chowdhury.

 The minister said the bridge was never on the priority list of the government. We were preoccupied with construction of other bridges. But Rama Biswas kept at it. Villagers also came forward to help by giving the land required for construction of the approach roads to the bridge. It may have taken 20 years. But this time, it will be constructed.

 Chowdhury said the Left Front government has constructed 115 bridges in the last 25 years.

 Almost all of them were constructed with help from financial institutions like the Asian Development Bank or Hudco. But this bridge is among the few bridges which is being funded from the (state) budget, the PWD minister said.

 The PWD minister also laid the foundation stone of another bridge in Nadias Nakashipara over the Bhagirathi connecting Burdwan and Nadia at a cost of Rs 7 crore.

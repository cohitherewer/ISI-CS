 Back from restaurant, officer dies

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Nov. 4: Police refuse to find anything unnatural about the death of a 54-year-old man from Behala though his relatives suspect foul play and the post-mortem suggests that the death was due to severe head injury.

 Behala resident Shibaprasad Ganguly, an officer with the land department, had gone on an evening out with an acquaintance from his locality and a lawyer last evening. 

 According to Gangulys companions, the three had gone to a bar-cum-restaurant in Bhowanipur. 

 At the bar, Ganguly said he wasnt feeling well and was rushed back to his Biren Roy Road home. Around 2.30 am, his condition started deteriorating. He was taken to a private hospital in Alipore where he died, said a senior officer of Behala police station.

 The police have not received a formal complaint from Gangulys relatives, he added.

 Following the death, the hospital authorities informed Alipore police. A case of unnatural death was initiated.

 Experts from the Kantapukur morgue, where the post-mortem was conducted, said they were struck by the presence of blood all over the skull. 

 This happens only if the victim has been hit hard on his head or has fallen off a place and rolled down some distance or has suffered a severe head injury in any other form, said one of the doctors at the morgue.

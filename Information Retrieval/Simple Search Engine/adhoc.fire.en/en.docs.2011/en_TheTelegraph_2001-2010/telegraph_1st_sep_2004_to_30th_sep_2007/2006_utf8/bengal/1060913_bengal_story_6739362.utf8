 Rs 24-lakh bank loot

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Chandernagore, Sept. 12: A gang of eight armed with revolvers walked away with about Rs 24 lakh from the United Bank of India branch here today.

 Branch manager Anup Sen Sharma said six men, apparently between 25 and 30 years of age, entered moments after the branch opened at 9.40 am, while two stood guard outside. 

 A duo forced deputy manager Kamal Mullick to part with on of the keys to the vault. They took the second from head cashier Rathin Dey when he walked in a while later. 

 After stuffing the cash from the vault in two side-bags, the Hindi-speaking men locked up the employees in two toilets and left,Sen Sharma said.

 The deputy manager of UBIs Chinsurah branch, Bi- shnupada Mondal, said Mullick had managed to call and whisper to him about the heist, but the cops wasted five minutes asking him about his identity and designation. 

 We have alerted all police stations in the region, Hooghly superintendent of police Supratim Sarkar said. 

 No arrests were reported till late tonight.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Youth found hanging at Metro site

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Nov. 18: A youth in a T-shirt and jeans was found hanging from the ceiling of the site office of a company constructing the Bansdroni Metro station platform this morning.

 Regent Park police have started a probe into the death of the man, in his mid-twenties, whose body was found with deep injury marks around the neck. 

 We are waiting for the post-mortem report, said S.N. Gupta, the South 24-Parganas superintendent of police. 

 Till late in the evening, the short and sturdy youth in red-and-black T-shirt and blue jeans had not been identified.

 Five persons, including the site in-charge, have been arrested and raids are on to find more suspects. 

 The guards of two companies constructing the platform and the railway line for the Metro station claim they had caught the youth trying to enter the site from the rear end and walk towards the scrap yard where iron rods are stored, and had locked him up in the site office. When the office was opened in the morning, he was found hanging, they said.

 But locals disputed this version, saying they had seen the guards beat up the youth around 5.30 am. I had arrived to open my shop when I heard cries of help. As I went closer, I saw two guards beating up the youth, said Pankaj Shaw, who owns a tea stall off the site. I protested but the guards insisted that this was the best way to teach him a lesson.

 A senior officer of Regent Park police station said: It could well be that someone had beaten the youth to death and then, to mislead the police, had hanged the body from the ceiling. We will know once the post-mortem report arrives.

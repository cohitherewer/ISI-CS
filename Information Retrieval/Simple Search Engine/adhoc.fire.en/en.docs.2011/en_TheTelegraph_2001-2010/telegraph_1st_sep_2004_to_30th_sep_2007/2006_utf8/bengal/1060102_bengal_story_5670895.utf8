 Hit list in circulation

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bandwan, Jan. 1: Maoists have circulated their hit list among villagers in West Midnapore, Bankura and Purulia and top CPM leaders are living in fear.

 The guerrillas came in small groups under the cover of darkness and apparently told villagers who their next targets could be. 

 According to intelligence reports, Anil Mahato, the partys local committee secretary of Banspahari in West Midnapore, Purulia secretary Nakul Mahato, MLA from Purulia town Nikhil Mukherjee and the state committee member from Purulia, Manindra Gope, figure on the list. 

 This is their style of functioning. Before killing Mahendra Mahato in July 2005, they had spread the word that he would be their target any day, an officer of Bandwan police station said. 

 We are keeping a close watch and all security arrangements have been made for the safety of the CPM leaders in the three districts, said inspector-general, western range, Banibrata Basu. 

 Sources in the special combat force, formed to tackle the Maoists, said senior officers had earlier proposed strengthening of Kars security. 

 At a meeting to review the security of CPM leaders who are on the Maoist hit list, we asked the state administration to increase the number of Kars security guards. The recommendation was made immediately after Mahendra Mahato was killed in Bandwan. But nothing was done, a senior officer said. 

 Kars daughter Chandana Modak told the police: After they (the Maoists) barged into our house, they asked which language we would feel comfortable with, Hindi or Bengali. Some of them were speaking in Hindi while the rest of them were speaking in Santhali and Bengali. 

 Investigators said the plan to kill Kar was drawn up in a dense forest on Tobo hill in Jharkhand. 

 The blueprint was chalked out in the first week of December when the Maoists were observing Peoples Liberation Guerrilla week in a forest on the Jharkhand border to decide, among other things, who their next target will be, an officer said.

 JU beats rivals to HP grant

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 4: Jadavpur University has left behind several other institutions of repute to bag a grant of $85,000. 

 Among those in the race for HP Indias Technology for Teaching award were the University of Tokyo, University of Canterbury, New Zealand, and Yonsei University of Korea.

 Jadavpur and Anna University are the first Indian institutions to qualify for the grant aimed at supporting the development of mobile technology environments through the use of wireless technology. 

 The technology in Jadavpur could be integrated to redesign key courses, said Biswanath Bhattacharya, a director of HP India Sales.

 The endowment includes a $15,000 stipend for staff to work on projects and $70,000 worth of technology such as HP tablet PCs, external storage and optical drives and wireless networking cards, said Pradip K. Das, the director of JUs school of mobile computing and communication.

 The company, which has helped JU set up its digital library, would also provide content access for its mobile learning centre and MTech course in mobile computing.

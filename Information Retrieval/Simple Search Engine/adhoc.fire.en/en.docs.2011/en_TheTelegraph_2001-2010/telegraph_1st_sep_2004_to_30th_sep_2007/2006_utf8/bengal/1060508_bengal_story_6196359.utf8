The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Subhas hates EC

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, May 7: Subhas Chakraborty today again took on the Election Commission for allowing only gazetted officers to act as supervisors during Thursdays counting of votes.

 I disregard the commissions order. It is an insult to our state government employees (Aami commission-er ei siddhantake abagya kari, karan eta amader sarkari karmacharider apaman kora), the transport minister told a television channel.

 He added: Commission-ke aami ghrina kari, oder manusher proti kono daiboddhata nei (I hate the commission. It has no responsibility towards the people).

 The poll panel tonight sought video clips from the channel to ascertain exactly what the minister had said.

 The commission had earlier issued a circular saying besides state employees of gazetted rank, only central government officers will be allowed to supervise counting. Group-D employees will be there just to assist in the counting.

 During the counting of ballots in 2001 and after the 2004 Lok Sabha polls, all categories of state government employees were assigned supervisory roles.

 Eibhabe konodin vote-er counting hoy ni. Commission taholey Bihar, Jharkhand thekey lok ene vote ganana koruk (Never has counting of ballots taken place this way. Let the commission then bring personnel from Bihar and Jharkhand to conduct the counting), Chakraborty told The Telegraph this afternoon.

 He also accused the pan- el of misusing its absolute powers. 

 Only last month, the poll panel had lodged a police complaint against Chakraborty after he accused government officers engaged in poll duty of acting as EC stooges despite being on the state governments pay rolls.

 Veteran CPM leader Jyoti Basu, who has mentored Chakraborty, did not approve of what he said. 

 The commission acts in accordance with our Constitution. So, it is better to keep quiet and abide by its directives, Basu said tonight. If people are with us, we should not waste time on unnecessary matters, he said.

 State CPM secretary and Left Front chairman Biman Bose, however, blamed the commission for the huge expenditure we have incurred because of the five-phase polls.

 The Bengal government is likely to spend about Rs 150 crore, more than double the amount estimated, on the polls.

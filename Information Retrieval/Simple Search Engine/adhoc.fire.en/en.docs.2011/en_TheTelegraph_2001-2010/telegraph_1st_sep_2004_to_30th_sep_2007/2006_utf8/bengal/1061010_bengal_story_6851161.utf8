The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Strike and run in Singur

 SAMARPAN DUTTA AMP; UTTAM DUTTA

 Singur, Oct. 9: Bandh supporters today played hide-and-seek with police while trying to enforce the shutdown.

 In small groups, farmers owing allegiance to the Krishi Jami Banchao (save farmland) Committee hopped from national highway 6 to the railway tracks along a 10-km stretch to disrupt traffic and trains. As the police arrived, they fled. 

 We applied cunning just like guerrillas do, said Bapun Patra, 27, who owns about an acre in Bajemelia mouza and has vowed not to part with it.

 Some others, who either do not see any other option or are glad to have been able to sell off their plot at a price higher than its market value, collected their compensation cheques today. 

 The residents of Bajemelia and Gopalnagar mouzas got their dues from the block development office. 

 Many farmers did not turn up, said the district officer in charge of the distribution.

 The office complex, like most of Singur in Hooghly, about 40 km from Calcutta, was crawling with policemen. Rapid Action Force and combat force jawans were also doing the rounds along dusty village paths and fields where Tata Motors will build its Rs 1-lakh car.

 When the raja (the king, in this case the state) sides with the rich and powerful and leaves the poor to survive on their own, a mass agitation is bound to take place, said Abha Patra, a villager. Well not give our land. 

 The government, however, already owns her piece on paper. It is likely to take physical possession in a few days.

 In Calcutta, the Trinamul Congress said it would observe lajja divas (day of shame) in Singur on October 15. On November 29, we will assemble in front of the Gandhi statue on Maidan and march to Singur to protest against government atrocities on farmers, said former MP Ajit Panja.

 Tata Metaliks land

 Industries minister Nirupam Sen said at Writers Buildings the Tatas will buy 250 acres in Kharagpur for the expansion of Tata Metaliks there. 

 In this case, acquisition will not be a problem, though. The company will buy the land directly from local farmers, we do not have to acquire it, said Sen.

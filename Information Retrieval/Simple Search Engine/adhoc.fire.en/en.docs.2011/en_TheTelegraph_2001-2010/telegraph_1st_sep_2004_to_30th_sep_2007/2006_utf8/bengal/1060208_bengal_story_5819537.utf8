The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Passenger pat for Metro

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Metro Railways: Happy commuters but under-capacity utilisation resulting in mounting losses

 Flyovers: Great image enhancement for the city but bottlenecks continue due to poor planning

 These are samples of the findings of a study on eight infrastructure projects supported by Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) in Bengal.

 Metro Railways, Calcutta Transport Infrastructure, Haldia Port Modernisation, Bakreshwar Thermal Power Plant, Teesta Hydroelectric, West Bengal Transmission System and Purulia Pumped Storage and Industrial Pollution Control were the projects covered under the study.

 Commissioned by JBIC, which has funded projects worth Rs 82.5 billion in the state, the study was carried out by The Energy Resource Institute (TERI), a Delhi-based research centre, to assess the impact of the projects on poverty reduction.

 Around 1,800 beneficiaries were surveyed in criteria such as relevance, efficiency, effectiveness, social and environmental impact and sustainability. The JBIC uses the same criteria to assess projects worldwide.

 The study found a huge gap between the actual and planned passenger traffic of the Metro. The majority of respondents said they preferred it over other means of transport and the underground railway was punctual and reliable.

 Almost all respondents felt that flyovers had reduced commuting time and enhanced the citys image. 

 But bottlenecks on the stretches leading to and from the flyovers continue because of improper planning, the study found.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Teenager held for twin rapes

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Oct. 10: An 18-year-old gagged two girls aged six and seven and raped them in a Nadia village last evening. 

 Asraful Sheikhs father thought Rs 10,000 should be enough to buy the girls parents silence on his sons crime.

 That was not to be as the local panchayat chief, a woman, rushed in to foil a meeting of village elders that Safikul had arranged to plead for a settlement. 

 Sheela Sarkar, the Naray- anpur panchayat pradhan, advised the girls parents to go to police and they did.

 Asraful was arrested this morning. The victims, his neighbours, have been admitted to the Karimpur block hospital, about 190 km from Calcutta, with serious injuries.

 Police said the Class II students were playing in a field when Asraful lured the older girl to a deserted garden with the promise of chocolates. 

 The other girl went in search and became a victim herself. Asraful chased and caught her as she tried to flee on seeing her friend being tortured, said Pradip Bose, the Karimpur circle inspector. 

 The girls were writhing in pain in the garden when farmers returning home from the field saw them.

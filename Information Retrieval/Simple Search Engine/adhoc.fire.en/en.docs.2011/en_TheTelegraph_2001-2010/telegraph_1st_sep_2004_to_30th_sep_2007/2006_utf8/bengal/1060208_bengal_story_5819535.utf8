 EC raps negligent officials

 OUR BUREAU

 Feb. 7: Over a dozen government officials have been pulled up for negligence in carrying out revision of electoral rolls across Bengal in the last two months.

 The officials ticked off include four block development officers from Birbhum, Murshidabad and Malda who were showcaused, two subdivisional officers from Balurghat and Uluberia who were transferred, and two teachers from Nadia suspended by the Election Commission.

 State chief electoral officer Debashish Sen said today that the disciplinary action was taken on recommendations from EC officials who visited the state twice to oversee the revision of electoral rolls.

 In a related development, election observer K.J. Rao, now touring West Midnapore, today pulled up the BDO of Keshpur, Lakshan Chandra Halder, for not co-operating with the Election Commision in stirking off names of dead and shifted voters in the Keshpur area.

 If the report of inquiry into such irregularities is not submitted to me by 1 pm tomorrow, all the officials concerned will face suspension, he warned.

 During the second day of his visit to the district today, Rao took the BDO to the Kaigara, Birpota and Kuspata villages, where he deleted names of 18 dead voters, following complaints.

 Caught on the wrong foot, an embarrassed Halder had to stay back in the village to carry out the investigation.

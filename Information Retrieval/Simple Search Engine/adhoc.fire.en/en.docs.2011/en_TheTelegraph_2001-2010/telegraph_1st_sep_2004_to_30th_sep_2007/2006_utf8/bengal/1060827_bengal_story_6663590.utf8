 Krishnagar, Aug. 26: Information and broadcasting minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, who is also a state Congress leader, has said the party has lost a chance to corner the CPM on the Singur land acquisition issue.

 Das Munshis contention a veiled attack on the party leadership in Bengal comes at a time when the Trinamul Congress-backed Krishi Jami Bachao Committee in Singur has launched an agitation opposing the land acquisition.

 The acquisition of farmland for the Tata project in Singur is a reflection of the anti-people policy of the Left Front government in Bengal. But what has the Congress done to oppose it and build up an effective movement? Nothing. This shows how the Congress has moved away from the people in Bengal, Das Munshi told party workers at a meeting here.

 Das Munshi said that launching a movement against the land acquisition would have put Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees government against the wall. But we lost a golden opportunity. I dont say Trinamul Congress has been able to create much of a ripple by their protest. But at least they have tried. Whereas the Congress has failed to do anything.

 He also blamed the Congress in Bengal for being unable to come up with a campaign against the CPM-led governments anti-people policies.

 Our leader Sonia Gandhi is perturbed over the growing isolation of the state Congress from the people at the grass-roots and the landless farmers. Can any block Congress leader present here tell me how many landless, marginal farmers or daily labourers are in their respective areas? I am sure none of you knows about it, said Das Munshi.

 We have no representation from the landless and marginal farmers. But the CPM has been able to make major inroads among these sections, he added.

 Das Munshi said the Congress chief has asked the state leadership to reach out to the neglected sections. We may keep arranging meetings and writing slogans on the walls, but we will not be able to unseat the communists if we do not take steps to improve our relations with the poor.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Quack drives away ojha

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Dec. 27: Black magic brought his hopes back to life, but not his son.

 Badal Malik had taken the body of eight-year-old Susanta, who had been bitten by a snake, for cremation when a witch doctor told him he could revive his only son. 

 A hopeful Badal watched Kailash Nayak at work from 5 pm yesterday to 9 this morning. But Susanta lay as still as before.

 Badal, a daily labourer from Dadpur in Howrahs Sankrail, had taken Susanta on a picnic to a nearby paddy field on Monday.

 The boy had gone to fetch banana leaves, to be used as plates, when a snake bit him.

 The villagers rushed him to Uluberia Divisional Hospital and later shifted him to Port View Nursing Home at Kidderpore. Doctors declared him dead the next day. 

 Susantas body was brought home when the witch doctor (ojha) came. He asked Badal to make arrangements for a puja to Manasa, the goddess of snakes. 

 Milk, bananas, sweets and flowers were brought, and the ojha began chanting mantras. 

 As word spread around the village, Sushanta Naskar, a local quack, rushed to the spot and demanded that the ojha be stopped immediately. The body is decomposed and is stinking, he said. 

 Some local boys backed the quack. Sensing trouble, Nayak fled.

 The ojha told us an evil soul was trying to snatch away the life of my son. He would drive away the evil soul by the strength of his black magic. We agreed because we saw it as our last hope, sobbed Badal.

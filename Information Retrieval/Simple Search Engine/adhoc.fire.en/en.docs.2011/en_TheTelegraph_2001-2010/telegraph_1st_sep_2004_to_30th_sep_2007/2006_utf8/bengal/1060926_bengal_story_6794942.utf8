 Suicide over Puja dress

 Krishnagar, Sept. 25: A young housewife committed suicide in a Nadia village today after a fight with her husband over a Puja dress for his nephew.

 Tumpa Mondal, 20, who was childless, loved her brother-in-laws 10-year-old son Raju like her own and wanted to gift him an expensive set. At Chakdah market, about 60 km from Calcutta, where Tumpa and her tailor husband Uttam went to shop yesterday, she pestered for a Rs 300 dress material for Raju. Uttam said he could spare only Rs 60.

 How can a tailor who earns around Rs 70 a day spend Rs 300 on a dress? asked a Chakdah police station officer. 

 During the tiff, Uttam snubbed Tumpa in public. She returned crying and hanged herself early this morning.

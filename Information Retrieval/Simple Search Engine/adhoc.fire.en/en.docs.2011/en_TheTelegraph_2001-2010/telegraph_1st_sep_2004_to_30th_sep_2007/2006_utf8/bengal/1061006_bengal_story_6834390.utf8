 Doctors on leave, patients on edge

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Midnapore, Oct. 5: Twenty out of 29 doctors at the Ghatal sub-divisional hospital are on leave, throwing services out of gear.

 The government has cancelled leave of health employees in flood-hit areas, including West Midnapores Ghatal, where about 2.5 lakh people were affected across 200 villages and 12 municipal wards. 

 But the doctors went on leave two days before Durga Puja. Since then, all out-patients departments have been shut except one counter that has to handle the daily rush of about 600 patients. The 130-bed hospital in Ghatal town, about 140 km from Calcutta, caters to nearly 4 lakh patients in the subdivision.

 Hospital superintendent Sisir Das could not be contacted because, he, too, is on leave.

 Snake-bite patients from flood-hit areas have started coming in. There might be an outbreak of post-flood enteric diseases any moment. But we are painfully short of doctors. Seven snake-bite patients have been admitted over the past couple of days, said a doctor.

 For 28-year-old Ayan Mondal from Rajnagar village, a tumour operation has to wait. I consulted a surgeon in the outdoor well before the Pujas and was asked to take admission on October 4. When I came yesterday, I was told to take a fresh date, Ayan said.

 As of now, we can only treat simple ailments. We have no doctors in specialised fields. We have no other option but to turn back patients, said a medical officer at the hospital.

 West Midnapore chief medical officer of health Mangobinda Mondal said all hospitals were sent the circular on cancellation of leaves. So, there is no question of getting (the leave) authorised. Only the hospital superintendent took special permission from me as his mother is ill. I have asked my deputy to conduct a probe on the doctors who have gone on leave, Mondal said.

 Theft at Tagore home again

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Santiniketan, May 15: Two years after Tagores Nobel medal and other memorabilia were stolen, thieves struck at Uttarayan again.

 This time, they were caught along with their loot ? mangoes, about a dozen or so.

 Eight guards belonging to a private security agency, who were accused of picking the fruits blown off trees behind Tagores mud house Shyamali by a Norwester, were removed from duty today.

 Visva-Bharatis own watch-and-ward employees, who oversee the security of the premises, had caught one of the private guards with a bundle of mangoes around 10 pm on May 4. He said his colleagues were his accomplices. 

 All of them had been assigned to guard the Uttarayan campus, which houses the Rabindra Bhavan museum, from where the priceless memorabilia were stolen. 

 We have complained to the agency chief to take necessary action. Our security staff had caught them with mangoes stolen from Uttarayan, said Sunil Kumar Sarkar, the university registrar. 

 The agency removed all eight from Visva-Bharati duty. We have taken the step following complaints from the authorities, said A.K. Sanyal, who is in charge of the security agencys operation in Santiniketan.

 Thirty-six guards work in three shifts on the Uttarayan premises. In every shift, there are 12 guards. Of them, three armed men and seven others are from the private agency. There are also two other armed personnel ? from the National Volunteer Force. The watch-and-ward staff members go around the entire university campus to oversee the security. 

 The private guards were inducted into the universitys security ring in April last year following pressure from the University Grants Commission to reduce the number of non-academic posts.

 Besides, the university was also facing accusations that the security arrangements to guard the memorabilia were inadequate. 

 In March 2004, the burglars stole 51 items from the museum, including the medal, Tagores wife Mrinalini Devis Baluchari sari and a sword gifted to the poet in Japan.

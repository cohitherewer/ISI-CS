The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Newspaper brings girl home

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Oct. 9: Banita Biswas, who left home on being told she would not have new clothes for Puja, was united with her family at Nadias Taldaha village yesterday.

 Distraught since her daughter went missing, Namita, 40, did not come to the house in Calcutta where she worked as a help since September 30. When she joined work last Saturday, her employer enquired about her absence. Babu, my daughter is missing, she said.

 The name Banita rang a bell and Dr Sukumar Basak looked up the October 5 issue of The Telegraph. He went into a room and brought out a newspaper which had my daughters story, said Namita.

 Mantu Biswas, a rickshaw-puller at Taldaha, 130 km from Calcutta, had found Banita on October 3, exhausted, hungry and with a swollen foot. He took her home, gave her food and raised the money for two salwar-kameez sets. But Banita, 13, could only tell her mothers name.

 Namita, a widow, and her son went to Taldaha yesterday and found her.

 Council bites after dogbite lapse

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Aug. 30: The headmaster of a primary school in Nadia has been showcaused for sending home a student bitten by a stray dog instead of rushing him to hospital.

 Kanai Haldar of Gobindapur Primary School in Krishnagunj, about 110 km from Calcutta, bled profusely after the dog attacked him while he was having a midday meal of rice and meat in the school last week.

 Headmaster Gopal Chandra immediately sent the Class I student, whose left arm was mauled, home with a group D employee. 

 The boys fisherman father, Kartick, took him to hospital. My son lost consciousness on reaching home. It was irresponsible on the part of the headmaster to send him back, he said.

 Chandra said he could not take Kanai to hospital as he had to attend a meeting.

 Karticks son was admitted to the Krishnagunj block hospital but could not be given the anti-rabies vaccine (ARV) as it was not available there. 

 The doctor, however, cautioned me that Kanai must be given at least three anti-rabies injections or else he could be in danger, Kartick said.

 The fisherman, who earns about Rs 30 a day, had to borrow Rs 1,000 from a moneylender to buy the vaccine from a medicine shop. I have given my son one dose, which cost Rs 1,100. Two more have to be given. I dont know how I will arrange the money, he said.

 Kartick has lodged a complaint with Krishnagunj BDO Dilip Ghosh. I want the headmaster to be punished as well as money for my sons treatment, he said.

 Nadia primary school council chairman Bibhas Biswas, who served the showcause on the headmaster, said: I have sought a report from the school inspector in three days.

 The school would bear the expenses of the boys treatment, he added.

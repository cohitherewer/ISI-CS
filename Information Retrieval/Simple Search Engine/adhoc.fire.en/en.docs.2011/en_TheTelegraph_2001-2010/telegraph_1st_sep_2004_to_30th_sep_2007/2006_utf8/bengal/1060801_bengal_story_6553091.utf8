 Animals for adoption

 A pair of red pandas in Darjeeling zoo

 Darjeeling, July 31: Fancy your own fluffy red panda or a ferocious snow leopard? Heres a chance to adopt them.

 An animal adoption scheme will soon be launched by the Padmaja Naidu Himalayan Zoological Park here. 

 The offer, which is yet to be opened to the public, has already found a taker. The West Bengal Forest Development Corporation recently decided to adopt a pair of red pandas for Rs 75,000 a year. 

 The price is high, admits director of the zoo A.K. Jha, but that is because adoption means looking after every need of the animal. 

 For the red pandas, enlisted as endangered species in Schedule 1 of the Wildlife Protection Act, this means a rich vegetarian diet, which mostly consists of leaves and shoots of malingo bamboo. They are also given seasonal fruits like apple and vegetables like carrot, apart from milk. The animals like to move around and need a big enclosure with a few trees. Adoption charges include regular medical check-ups.

 However, animal lovers can adopt even small birds, which will definitely come at a low price, said Jha.

 We are currently working on the price chart and expect to finalise it within a fortnight. In a months time, the programme will be in place, the director added.

 All animals and birds housed in the zoo ? from the slow loris to the Himalayan black bear and the colourful Himalayan pheasant ? will be up for adoption by corporate houses or individuals. 

 Apart from being allowed regular visits to the zoo, the names of the sponsors and their pets would be prominently displayed on the zoo premises.

 Although similar programmes have been successful in zoos across the world, this is the first time the concept is being introduced in the state. In India, zoos in Lucknow and Mussoorie allow people to adopt animals.

 The Darjeeling zoo authorities said the funds they receive from the Centre and the state are sufficient for the maintenance of the animals, and the adoption programme is not aimed at improving finances. For us, the participation of the people is more important, Jha said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Police hunt for puja goons

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, 

 Dec. 9: Police today sprang into action and picked 

 up two members of Adi Shakti Club, some of whose Kali Puja 

 organisers had killed 20-year-old Bikram Jha for not paying 

 the subscription they demanded, following todays report 

 in The Telegraph on his parents predicament. 

 Two other members of the Kidderpore club, who have been accused of murdering Bikram and are still at large, had been terrorising the Jhas to get the complaint against them withdrawn. 

 Kabitirtha Congress MLA Ram Pyare Ram, the president of the club, had allegedly asked Bikrams father to take back his police complaint. Political intervention had initially prevented the police from accepting an FIR. 

 Bikram, an agent for a multinational bank, died on October 21. The politician-puja goon nexus came to light after that and two club members were arrested. 

 Bikrams father Dhaneswar said the MLA called him three days ago and asked him to withdraw the complaint against Dipu and Bhola. 

 MLA saheb told me there will be no harassment of my family if I withdrew the complaint, Jha said. 

 The state Congress today asked Ram to dissociate himself from Adi Shakti Club. Ram has informed the PCC that he is not associated with the club. But since his name is still being dragged into the incident, I have asked him to sever links with the club. His alleged involvement has tarnished the partys image, state party working president Pradip Bhattacharya said. 

 Ram was not available for comment. 

 Todays report in The Telegraph said the murder accused were roaming freely and terrorising the Jhas. 

 The police came to my house this morning. They assured me that no harm will be done to us but we are living in fear, Dhaneswar said.

 He had moved the high court on Thursday alleging police inaction. The court demanded an explanation from the police, who conducted raids in the port area today and picked up two accused from Bhukailash Road. 

 We are interrogating them. They were among those tormenting the Jhas, said J. Dholey, the South Port police station OC. Three constables have been posted in front of the Jhas house on vigil.

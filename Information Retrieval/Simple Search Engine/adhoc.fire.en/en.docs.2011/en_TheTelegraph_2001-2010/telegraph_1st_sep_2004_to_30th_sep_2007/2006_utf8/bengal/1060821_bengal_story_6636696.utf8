The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Taunted ex-dacoit chooses death

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Aug. 20: Tofazzel Sheikh had quit his profession dacoity to stick to the straight and the narrow.

 When he surrendered in Tehatta court two years ago to return to the mainstream, promises to help him on the way came flowing. 

 The dreaded criminal committed suicide last night, unable to feed his wife and four daughters.

 The 45-year-old resident of Rashikpur in Nadias Muru- tia, 190 km from Calcutta, left home yesterday morning and did not return. He was found hanging from a mango tree. 

 My husband was debt-ridden and could not provide us two meals a day. We are virtually starving now. With him gone, we will die, said Aufa Bibi, his second wife. 

 His first wife, Ameza, divorced him 10 years ago because of his criminal activities.

 An accused in about 20 looting, dacoity and murder cases, Tofazzel was out on bail.

 Nadia superintendent of police R. Rajsekharan said he could not even engage lawyers to defend himself in court and was probably scared that he would have to spend the rest of his life in jail.

 An officer who probed some of Tofazzels alleged crimes said returning to normal life was not easy for him. His gang broke up and he became lonely. His partners deserted him. Knowing his past, no one gave him a job and he started borrowing money.

 Tofazzel did not have land to till. Villagers who had applauded when he tried to mend his ways turned their backs on him. Aufa said: Every one avoided him because he was a criminal. 

 He had got the job of guarding a piece of farmland for Rs 500 a month, but lost it after its owner came to know about his past. My husband had become a subject of taunt. Villagers keep their children away from my daughters, Aufa said.

 Kartick Pal, the chief of the local Digalkanti panchayat, accepted the widows charges. We had persuaded him to surrender and assured him that we would help him return to the mainstream. We tried our best to find someone to give him a job, but no one came forward.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 MLAs want to have laptops

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Calcutta, Oct. 30: Bengal MLAs want laptops not because it is fashionable to carry one but because they want to work better.

 But the tech support alone wont do. They need confidential assistants as well. It is not known, though, whether they would be tasked to operate the laptops.

 We are sending the proposal to the government as it is in tune with our policy that public representatives need secretarial assistance to deliver the goods. As for laptop computers, the financial involvement is not much, said Syed Mohammad Mashi, the government chief whip.

 The decision was taken at todays meeting of the Assemblys committee on entitlements, which is headed by Speaker Hashim Abdul Halim.

 The ruling bloc and the Opposition were united on the demand for laptops and confidential assistants for each of the 294 Bengal MLAs. Ministers and leader of Opposition Partha Chatterjee now have confidential assistants, who are basically party appointees. Given the increasing workload, MLAs should also be entitled to confidential assistants, Opposition chief whip Ashok Deb was quoted as saying. 

 Mohammad Mashi pressed the demand for laptops. Computers are a must in todays world. Legislators would have all information at their fingertips if provided with laptops, he told the meeting. 

 But will all MLAs be able to use them? They should be made computer literate, Mashi said. The leader of the Opposition supported him.

 A computer training session had been organised in the Assembly last year. There was an overwhelming response, the Speaker had said then. 

 Mohammad Mashi said: Purchasing 300 laptops would cost no more than Rs 1 crore. Thats not a big deal.

 The leader of the Opposition said he was happy that the Left parties had also realised the importance of computers. Laptops would raise the standard of debates in the House, said Chatterjee.

 He also supported the proposal for secretarial help. Its not that only ministers work.

 Todays meeting also gave the go-ahead to hikes in the MLAs compensatory and constituency allowance. Both will be raised by Rs 500. The daily allowance and standing committee meeting attendance fees have been raised from Rs 350 to Rs 500. The pension for former MLAs is also up by Rs 500, making it Rs 2,000 a month.

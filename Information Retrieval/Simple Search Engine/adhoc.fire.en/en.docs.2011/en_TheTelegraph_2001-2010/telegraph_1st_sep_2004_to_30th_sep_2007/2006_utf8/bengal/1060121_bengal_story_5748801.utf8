 CPM axe

 Calcutta, Jan. 20: The CPM has hurriedly expelled two of its members who were held at Habra yesterday for running a press that printed fake voter I-cards. 

 An embarrassed secretary of the North 24-Parganas party unit, Amitava Bose, said: Parimal Biswas and his brother Rabi were expelled as soon as the news of their arrest reached us. 

 The duo has been remanded in seven days police custody. The district superintendent said a hunt is on for others involved in the racket.

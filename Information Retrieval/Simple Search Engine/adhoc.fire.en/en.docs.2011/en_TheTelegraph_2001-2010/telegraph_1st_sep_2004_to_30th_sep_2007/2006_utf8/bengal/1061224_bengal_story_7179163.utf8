 BPO hand in robbery net

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Dec. 23: A young BPO employee drawing about Rs 12,000 a month has been arrested for allegedly snatching money from customers leaving the Ballygunge branch of a private bank.

 Yusuf Ahmed, the police said, had robbed a few lakhs over the past year. 

 A commerce graduate, Yusuf, 27, was arrested from his house in Phoolbagan early this morning. 

 He first tried his luck last December. After scanning customers turning up at the bank for a few days, he picked a person who withdrew around Rs 1 lakh. As the man left the cash counter, Yusuf called two of his partners and followed him on a motorcycle. The man was intercepted on Gurusaday Road and his money snatched, a senior detective department officer said.

 He is very smart, speaks English and comes from a good family. During interrogation, he admitted to having committed crimes in between jobs, the officer added.

 According to the police, Yusuf struck again three months later. 

 Being a customer of the bank, he would turn up during peak hours and keep a watch on those in the queue in front of the cash withdrawal counter. On a few occasions, he withdrew money himself just to have a close look at the amounts being taken out by others, the police said.

 Yusuf always came with his partners, who waited for him with a motorcycle. 

 Having identified a man with a heavy amount, Yusuf tipped his friends and then intercepted him some distance away from the bank the officer added.

 Rattled by frequent complaints, the police started keeping a watch and, having pursued him for months, traced Yusuf to his house today.

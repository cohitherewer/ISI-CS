 Dec. 23: Christmas should be cooler, the Met office assured Calcutta today. 

 A cyclonic circulation (anti-clockwise movement of air) over the Bengal coast, which fed the city and its adjoining areas with moisture over the past four days blocking the north wind, has cleared.

 This cyclonic circulation had led to the rise in temperature over the past few days. Now that the circulation has cleared, we expect the minimum temperature to drop, said G.C. Debnath, director of the weather section at the Alipore Met office. 

 Two days before Christmas, the city recorded a minimum of 17.2 degrees Celsius, about 3 degrees above normal.

 With the promise of chill, however, came a caution. The temperature is expected to drop slowly as the atmosphere is still loaded with the warm moisture sucked in from the bay by the cyclonic circulation, Debnath added.

 Met officials said that during the last week of December, the minimum temperature generally hovers around 14 degrees Celsius. But the north wind is often blocked by cloud formed because of the incursion of moisture. The sky over Calcutta has now cleared and the north wind has started blowing. The minimum temperature will drop and the chill will slowly set in, an official said.

 The coldest day of the season was December 4, when the mercury dipped to 12.6 degrees. Since then the north wind has shied off Bengal.

 Fog in flight path

 The weather office also warned of fog in the morning as the cyclonic circulation has left behind warm, moist air. 

 Dense fog in Delhi has caused long delays in morning flights to and from the capital. All Jet Airways flights to and from Delhi were delayed by two and a half hours on an average. 

 The first Calcutta-Delhi Air Sahara flight left at 9.20 am instead of the scheduled 6.25 am and the second, slated to leave at 9 am, took off at 2 pm.

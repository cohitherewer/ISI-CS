The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Pranab asks party to go it alone

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Feb. 5: Defence minister and state Congress president Pranab Mukherjee today asked party functionaries to independently launch a campaign for the next Assembly elections following Mamata Banerjees decision to continue ties with the BJP.

 He also said the party would shortly begin choosing nominees for the polls.

 Though I twice met Mamata to persuade her to lead a Congress-Trinamul Congress alliance and sever ties with the BJP, she did not budge. Forget about any electoral understanding with her. Instead, start campaigning on your own at the grassroots to take on the ruling CPM, Mukherjee told a meeting of the PCC executive committee.

 Chairing the meeting at the PCC headquarters, Mukherjee said the Congress and its allies would put up candidates for all 294 seats across Bengal. He also directed all 26 sitting Congress MLAs to visit their constituencies and prepare the groundwork for the polls.

 Remember, we cannot sacrifice our political ideology for the sake of forging an electoral understanding with Mamata in Bengal. The AICC is opposed to any sort of alliance with a party that has BJP links, he was learnt to have said, snubbing some pro-alliance leaders at the meet.

 Later, Mukherjee told reporters that the state Congress would shortly release its list of candidates for the polls.

 Asked about a proposed meeting between the AICC general secretary in charge of Bengal affairs, Margaret Alva, and Mamata on seat adjustment, Mukherjee said: Our doors are always open for talks. But if Mamata does not change her stand vis-?-vis the BJP, it is impossible to tie up with her.

 However, observers said Congress leaders would forge unofficial electoral pacts with the Trinamul in almost all seats by putting up weak nominees against Mamatas candidates. An unofficial tie-up with Mamata is inevitable in a state like Bengal where voters are polarised. Here, the CPM is a bigger enemy for us than the BJP, said a key PCC functionary.

 In another development, the Left Front said it would announce its list of 294 candidates on February 16 and release its election manifesto, which would focus on industrialisation.

 Front chairman and politburo member Biman Bose said Left parties would send in the names of their candidates by 11 February to help expedite the process of selection of Front nominees.

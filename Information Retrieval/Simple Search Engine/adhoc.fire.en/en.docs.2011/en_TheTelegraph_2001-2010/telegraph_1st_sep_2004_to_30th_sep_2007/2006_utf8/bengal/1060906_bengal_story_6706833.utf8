The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 IT bandh on politburo plate

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Sept. 5: State 

 CPM secretary Biman Bose today indicated that Citu president 

 M.K. Pandhe would not have the last word on shutting down 

 Bengals IT and ITES companies during the December 

 14 bandh. 

 I have come across what Pandhe has said. The matter is likely to be discussed in the politburo meeting, Bose told The Telegraph. 

 We cannot exempt the IT and ITES sectors from the strike since employees there are subjected to the worst kind of exploitation, Pandhe, also a CPM politburo member, had said on Friday.

 The CPM labour arms bid to enforce the bandh last September had prompted a red-faced chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to assure IT firms that there would be no such shutdowns in the future. 

 But Pandhe said: We will try our best to organise strike in all industries, including the IT sector, in Bengal.

 He got support from Citu leader and fellow politburo member Chittabrata Majumdar. The IT sector exploits labour like any other. These firms cannot be considered emergency service-providers just because they run three shifts a day. Many industries do that. Nobody bothers about them, Majumdar said.

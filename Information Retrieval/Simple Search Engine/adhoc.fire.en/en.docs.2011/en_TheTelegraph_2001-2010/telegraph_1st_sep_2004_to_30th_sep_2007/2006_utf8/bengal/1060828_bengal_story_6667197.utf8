The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Lakh trees in desert

 Relief

Durgapur Aug. 24: Around 100,000 saplings are being planted in the Asansol-Durgapur industrial belt, where only a little over 3 per cent is now under green cover.

 On an average, 17 per cent of India is under forest cover and 14 per cent of Bengal.

 Rapid urbanisation and a spurt in the number of sponge iron and other steel-related industries have taken their toll on the environment in Burdwans business belt, a report prepared by the Forest Survey of India says. 

 The international standard for forest cover in an urban zone is at least 33 per cent, said Kumar Vimal, the Durgapur divisional forest officer.

 The Forest Survey of India and the state government are providing funds for the Asansol-Durgapur project.

 Around 32,000 trees of the fast-growing kanchan, sonalu and jarul varieties have already been planted in the 80-km stretch between Galsi and Asansol. Over 60,000 more will be planted in the Ukhra region of Andal, Salanpur in Asansol and the Kanksa-Aushgram-Guskara areas of Burdwan, said Vimal.

 Coal smugglers have made the task difficult, a forest department official said. On 46 hectares in Ukhra, they have dug up holes to access abandoned mines, making it impossible to plant trees. 

 The pollution control board said it was high time that the district authorities reacted. The central pollution control board had declared the Asansol-Durgapur area and Howrah most polluted in the state, said Biswajit Mukherjee, a senior law officer of the board.

 Smoke and carbon billowing from the steel units, sponge iron factories and the power plant have poisoned the air. More and more children are suffering from bronchial diseases, alleged Kabi Ghosh, the general secretary of a Durgapur residents association.

 Calcutta, April 8: A cab speeding down the eastern slope of the Park Circus-Bypass connector hit a woman, her eight-year-old daughter and two youths this morning, minutes before chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees convoy was scheduled to pass.

 Protesting against the rash driving, a mob damaged a private bus and later put up a blockade on Darga Road for over an hour. As a result, the chief ministers convoy had to be diverted. 

 According to an eyewitness, the taxi hit Yasmin Begum, 32, and her daughter Gulshan, 9, and two brothers ? Wasim Basar 16 and Irfan Basar 12 ? as they were crossing the road from north to south direction at the eastern slope of the bridge. 

 Yasmin and her daughter were rushed to National Medical College and Hospital. Gulshan, who suffered serious head injuries, is in a critical state. The mother and daughter stay in Darga Road.

 Wasim and Irfan, residents of Shibpur, Howrah, were admitted to the nearby M.B. Nursing Home. Their condition is stable. The brothers had come to visit a relative admitted to Dilkhusha Nursing Home in Park Circus. 

 Jawed Shamim, deputy commissioner of police (traffic), said the cars brakes had failed.

 The taxi driver tried to slam the brakes after noticing the four people crossing the road but the brakes failed. Realising this, he started shouting to them. However, the vehicle hit the four, Shamim added.

 A large number of people gathered at the spot after the accident. 

 Cops from both Karaya and Beniapukur police stations rushed to the spot and took the four to hospital. 

 Later, over 200 people smashed the windscreen of a route 39 private bus near National Medical College. 

 A large police contingent, including the Radio Flying Squad, reached the spot and brought the situation under control. The driver of the cab was arrested and the vehicle seized.

 Senior government officials today said that Calcutta police, concerned by the recurring accidents at the same spot, had proposed that a north-south footbridge be built near the eastern slope. This has been sanctioned by the state transport department. 

 The transport department has agreed to the proposal and a footbridge with lifts on both sides will be erected soon. There will be a staircase, too. Lifts will be used by elderly people and children, Shamim said.

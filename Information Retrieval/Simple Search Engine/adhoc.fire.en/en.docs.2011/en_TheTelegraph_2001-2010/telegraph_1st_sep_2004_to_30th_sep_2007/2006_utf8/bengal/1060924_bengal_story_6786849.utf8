The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Bomb drama bursts on cops

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 23: The 

 top brass of the state police are contemplating disciplinary 

 action against an over-confident bunch of policemen 

 whose enactment of defusing a mine led to Thursdays 

 blast in West Midnapores Jhitka forest.

 Around 11.30 on Thursday morning two hours after an improvised explosive device (IED) had been discovered and retrieved from a milk can the policemen, apparently spearheaded by Utpal Bhakta of the bomb disposal squad, took it back to the forest to replay the incident before reporters and photographers.

 In a report to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, a group of senior officers of the state police who visited the site yesterday rapped the members of the bomb squad for their carelessness.

 It cost the police two lives, which included that of Bhakta, an IED expert who had successfully defused at least a dozen such explosives in his career. At least 27 others, including journalists and photographers, were injured in the blast in the Maoist-hit Lalgarh district.

 Having travelled with the IED for over 4 km from the incident site to Lalgarh police station without any visible signs of the bomb being alive, the members felt they could take it back and plant it for a photo shoot, said a senior officer.

 Director-general of police A.B. Vohra, senior officers of the Intelligence Branch, director of security A.K. Maliwal and IG (western range) Banibrata Basu were part of the team that visited the forest yesterday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 IIMs set 50% cut-off

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, July 14: A 50 

 per cent score in graduation has been made mandatory for 

 admission to the Indian institutes of management (IIMs) 

 from this year. 

 The six-member Common Admission Test (CAT) Group, which conducts the nationwide entrance test for the six IIMs, has taken this decision keeping in mind the interests of students. 

 We have seen that a lot of students neglect their graduation courses while preparing for CAT. But not all of them can make it to the IIMs and so we decided to put in place the cut-off to ensure that students also pay attention to graduation courses, said Asish Bhattacharyya, chairman, admissions, IIM Calcutta. 

 Taking together all the six IIMs, there are around 1,700 seats in the postgraduate programme in management. Besides, around 40 management institutes across the country use the CAT score to select students. 

 Last year, around 175,000 students ? an all-time record ? appeared for the entrance test. This years examination is scheduled for November 19. The IIMs are also hoping that the cut-off will restrict the number of applicants to a manageable level. 

 This eligibility criterion will not create any problems for us or for the students. Our records suggest that almost all students who get into the IIMs have secured 50 per cent or more in undergraduate examinations, added Bhattacharyya. 

 Not will it just introduce an eligibility criterion, the CAT Group might also change the format of the test, including the duration of the examination and structure of the question paper, to build in some surprise element. But Bhattacharyya refused to comment on the issue. We dont disclose such information, he said. 

 The other changes in CAT this time are introduction of on-line form submission and interactive voice response system numbers to help applicants fill up forms.

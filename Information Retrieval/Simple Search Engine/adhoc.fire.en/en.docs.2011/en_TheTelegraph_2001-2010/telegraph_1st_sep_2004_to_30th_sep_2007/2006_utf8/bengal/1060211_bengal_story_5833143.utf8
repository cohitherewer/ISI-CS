The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, Feb. 10: A high court judge today said government authorities should not suspend an employee simply for spending over 24 hours in jail in connection with a criminal case.

 Justice P.K. Chatterjee said it is not wise to take penal action until a guilt has been proved. He was hearing a petition filed by Abdul Bari, a schoolteacher of Champdani who was suspended in 1993. The trial is still pending in a Hooghly court. He should be allowed to join duty immediately, the judge said. 

 Calcutta: BJP leader Arun Jaitleys meeting with Mamata Banerjee on Thursday night over seat sharing for the Assembly polls ended in a stalemate. Sources said Mamata refused to part with the 90-odd seats which Jaitley claimed.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 BRIEFS

 Calcutta: From a distance, they looked like a bunch of basketball players doing a lap of honour. But, then India would have been a world beater had its players been that big. These guys were nine to 10 feet tall. 

 A closer look gave away the truth. They were walking on stilts and their red jerseys had hammers and sickles emblazoned in gold. The gang was campaigning for transport minister Subhas Chakraborty in Lake Town with a band following them.

Suri: If magicians in Burdwan are making Opposition candidates 

disappear, musicians are silencing them in Birbhum. When district Congress secretary 

Barun Bhandari was introducing candidate Biswajit Mukherjee, an expelled CPM member, 

at party stronghold Mohammadbazar, a dozen CPM cadre climbed on the roof of a 

nearby building and started playing the dhamsa. The tribal drum can make enough 

din to drown a voice, never mind the electric amplifiers. 

 Krishnagar: Trinamul leaders see CPM mischief in almost anything, but a cassette shop fire? Naresh Chaki, the Nadia party president and its candidate from Chakdah, did just that and even blocked railway tracks on Friday. Trains were stalled for an hour as the 71-year-old squatted on the tracks till the fire brigade said it was a short-circuit. Its a mistake Nareshda, said a supporter. If only politicians turned red.

Calcutta: Sonia Gandhi will arrive here on Thursday. She 

will address rallies at Baduria in North 24-Parganas, Garden Reach and Park Circus 

Maidan.

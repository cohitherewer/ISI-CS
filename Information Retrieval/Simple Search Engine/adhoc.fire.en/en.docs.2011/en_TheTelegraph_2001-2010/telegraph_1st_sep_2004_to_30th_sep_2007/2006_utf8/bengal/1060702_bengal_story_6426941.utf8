The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Ire at tax men

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 1: About 300 traders today confined two sales tax officials in a godown to protest against extortion and harassment by them.

 Some shop owners detained two sales tax officials when they visited the area for inspection and asked the traders to show documents. But no formal complaint was lodged with us, said Amiya Kumar Lahiri, officer in charge of Burrabazar police station.

 Shop owner Hansraj Sethia said: For the past two months, a section of sales tax officials have been harassing us. They demand money on the pretext that we do not have proper papers. 

 The traders also held a demonstration demanding that sales tax officials should stop harassing them.

 A settlement was reached after police intervened. The traders will meet sales tax authorities on Wednesday to sort out the problems.

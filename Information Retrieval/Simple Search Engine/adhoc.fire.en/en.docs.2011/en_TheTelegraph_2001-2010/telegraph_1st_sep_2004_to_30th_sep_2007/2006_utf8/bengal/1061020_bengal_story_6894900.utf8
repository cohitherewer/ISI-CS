 Adhir daughter still critical

 Shreyashi

 Calcutta, Oct. 19: Congress MP Adhir Chowdhurys daughter Shreyashi, who attempted suicide by jumping off an apartment house yesterday, is still critical.

 Her condition over the next few days would be crucial to her recovery, doctors said.

 Shreyashi has suffered serious injuries to her head and chest and multiple fractures. She is still on ventilator, said Sanjay Bagchi, an orthopaedic surgeon treating her at AMRI.

 When contacted, Adhirs voice betrayed nervousness and tension. Doctors told me it was difficult to say before a week how my daughter will progress. Please pray for her, he said. We dont want to think about anything else. We want her to get well.

 Police officials investigating the case said 18-year-old Shreyashi had been suffering from acute depression for the past few months. 

 We interrogated some of her friends. They said she was under tremendous pressure from her parents, who were not happy after she joined a modelling school, said an investigating officer of Lake police station. We came to know that Shreyashi had a heated argument with her father over the phone on Tuesday night. The conversation continued for over half an hour and she was very agitated after that.

 We have not been able to speak to Adhir Chowdhury and his wife, Arpita, as they are too shocked. What exactly prompted her to take such an extreme step will be known once we speak to the parents, Sukumar Chakraborty, the officer-in-charge of Lake police station said.

 The only child of Adhir and Arpita Chowdhury, Shreyashi is a Class XII student of St Johns Diocesan School on Sarat Bose Road. She stayed at the apartment along with two housekeepers.

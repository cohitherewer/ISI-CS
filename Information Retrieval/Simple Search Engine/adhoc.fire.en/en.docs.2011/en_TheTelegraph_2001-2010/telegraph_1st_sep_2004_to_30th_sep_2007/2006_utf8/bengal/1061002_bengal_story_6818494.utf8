The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Trinamul split over CM meet

 BARUN GHOSH

 Calcutta, Oct. 1: Mamata Banerjees party is divided over whether or not to attend the meeting called by Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to discuss land acquisition in Singur.

 A day after leader of the Opposition Partha Chatterjee said the Trinamul Congress would skip it to press its demand for a public apology from the chief minister for alleged police brutalities on Mamata, MLA Sadhan Pande and several other leaders voiced opposition to such a condition.

 We should be there at the meeting to make our stand on Tata Motors small-car project clear, Pande, the MLA from Burtola in north Calcutta, said this afternoon. When the government invites leaders from all political parties to seek their views on land acquisition for a project, they should use the forum to voice their concerns.

 Pande also suggested that the party could draw attention to the police high-handedness at the meeting. Since Bhattacharjee himself has said that the police action was undesirable, we should not give the meeting a miss. 

 The MLA had incurred Mamatas wrath last month by criticising her for opposing the governments industrialisation drive. 

 I was the only person to speak up in front of Mamata and point out that the party would be wrong in going against industrialisation, the need of the hour, he said today. 

 Ironically, the Trinamul MLA from Singur is in favour of attending the meeting. It is the best place to highlight how CPM men are threatening poor farmers who are not willing to sell their land for the Tata project, said Rabindranath Bhattacharya. 

 Mamata, still in hospital, recovering from suspected lung haemorrhage, is learnt to have said that Chatterjee overstepped his limits by demanding the chief ministers public apology as a condition for taking part in the meeting, which the Congress has already agreed to attend. 

 Parthada should restrict himself to his job as leader of the legislature party. We had other senior leaders to comment on the issue, a Trinamul leader quoted her as saying. 

 Mamata, the doctor attending to her said, can now get on her feet and take short walks. 

 If we dont attend the all-party meeting even after the chief minister virtually regretting the police action, it will send a wrong signal to urban voters, our strongest support base, warned a senior leader from south Calcutta.

 Another leader who did not want to be named said: It would be a forum to convince the people that we also want industry, but not at the cost of those who depend on farming for their livelihood. 

 Party sources said Chatterjee did not take other leaders into confidence before making the statement. 

 That the Behala West MLA had been censured was evident from the manner in which he reacted tonight to the chief ministers comment on the police action. Dont ask me. Henceforth, I shall comment only on the affairs of the legislature party, he said.

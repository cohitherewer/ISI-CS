 Pandas cry foul over lost right

 Calcutta, Sept. 16: A day after a Calcutta High Court interim order prohibited Kalighat pandas from entering the sanctum sanctorum of the temple, they vowed to take the issue to the human rights commission as a last resort.

 We have been at work here since 1962. If attempts are made to evict us from the Kali temple after so many years, we will be left with no option but to move the rights panel. We cannot be denied our right to survive, said Malay Ghosh Dastidar, chairman of Sathi Brahman Sangathan, the pandas umbrella organisation. 

 Around 2,000 of them roam around the temple to help devotees offer puja at the garbagriha (sanctum sanctorum).

 Not all devotees consider their services help. Pandas have been accused of harassing devotees and extorting money from them promising a better view of the idol. Refusing their help allegedly spells trouble for visitors. 

 Mayank Agarwal, a south Calcutta resident, heaved a sigh of relief hearing the court order. 

 Devotees throng the temple on Saturdays and the pandas have a merry time picking their victims. But today the ambience on the temple premises was different. They seemed to be somewhat sober and things were in order. It could well be that the police deployment in the area made the difference, he said.

 Ghosh Dastidar said the high court may have barred them from the sanctum sanctorum, but one must realise that the pandas never enter the garbagriha. 

 He blamed local goons for the mess inside. Some local goons, who enjoy the sebayits support, have access to the sanctum sanctorum. 

 Five families, who are the sebayits or paladars, appoint priests and take turns to organise the puja every day. 

 Ghosh Dastidar has not received a certified copy of the court order but he was apprehensive of a possible eviction. 

 It is unfortunate that some of the devotees had a misconception about the pandas and they were often referred to as goondas. Our members are not involved in extortion or robbing devotees, though I must admit that there may be a few exceptions, Ghosh Dastidar said.

 Some devotees like Anshuman Das, from the outskirts of the city, believe that the pandas were indeed a help. If they are banned from the premises, he said, it would be difficult for people to access the main entrance to the sanctum sanctorum, especially on Tuesdays and Saturdays when the crowd is bigger.

 I agree that they were very aggressive at times and harassed people, but they also used to help people have darshan (a sight) of the deity. Their absence might result in a chaos, Das added. 

 Kalighat Temple Committee treasurer Jagadish Haldar expressed his satisfaction over the court directive and asserted that the pandas were not being allowed to go near the garbagriha since this morning. Action has been taken against both pandas and beggars. A number of police personnel have been deployed and plainclothes personnel from the special branch and the detective department are keeping a watch.

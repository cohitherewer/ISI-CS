The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Basu bogus plainspeak

 Calcutta, Jan. 13: Jyoti Basu today resented the inclusion of Bangladeshis in voter lists in districts along the border.

 This is not expected. Why has the administration not taken steps to tackle the issue? he asked while speaking to The Telegraph tonight. 

 On the role of the election observers now touring the districts to oversee the revision of electoral rolls, the CPM veteran said: They (observers) are rightly striking off the names of Bangladeshis.

 In the morning, the former chief minister said at the party headquarters that bogus voters did exist on the electoral rolls. He later parried a question on why his government and Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees had failed to weed them out. 

 At a CPM state secretariat meeting today, bogus voters were at the centre of talks. Left Front chairman Biman Bose had last week admitted their existence, something that the Opposition parties had been alleging for years.

 CPM leaders gunned down in Naxalite den

 Two leaders of the CPM youth wing, DYFI, were shot dead by suspected Maoists at Binpur in West Midnapore, about 180 km from Calcutta, this evening. 

 Police said Tapas Mondal, 29, and Akash Bej, 27 were returning home to Lalgarh after a party meeting when 20 masked men surrounded them. CPM leader Dahareswar Sen also saw a hand of the Jharkhand Party (Naren Hansda) in the strike.

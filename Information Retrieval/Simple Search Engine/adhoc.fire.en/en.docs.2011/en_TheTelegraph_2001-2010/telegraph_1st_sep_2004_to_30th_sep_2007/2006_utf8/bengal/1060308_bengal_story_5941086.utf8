The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 No verdict on judge house

 New Delhi, March 7: The Supreme Court today reserved its verdict on former Calcutta High Court judge Bhagabati Prosad Banerjees plea to set aside the auction of his Salt Lake house. 

 Banerjee, who got Rs 30.5 lakh for his house, had alleged that the governments valuation was unreasonable, arbitrary? and without any basis.

 Arguing on Banerjees behalf, former chief minister S.S. Ray alleged irregularities in the publication of the auction notice and the sale on February 4. The market value of the house that has five bathrooms, two garages and two underground water tanks is much higher, he said.

 The house and the land sold for Rs 51 lakh, but a prospective buyer submitted before the court that he was willing to pay Rs 80 lakh.

 The bench of Justices H.K. Sema and A.R. Lakshmanan reserved its order after hear- ing all sides. 

 On November 19, 2004, the court set aside the allotment of land to Banerjee under the chief ministers discretionary quota and ordered the public auction of the property. The price of the building was to go to the judge and the rest to the state.

 Signal post kills teen on train

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, April 8: Train services in the Sealdah south section were thrown out of gear after a youth, struggling to find a foothold in a packed moving train, died when his head hit a signal post.

 Sheikh Md Imran of Subhasgram had boarded the Up Laxmikantapur local. 

 The 19-year-old was on his way to Park Circus where he works in a bag-manufacturing unit. Imran was struggling to get inside the compartment. As the train chugged into Sonarpur station, his head hit the signal post. He immediately fell off the train. 

 Passengers in his compartment pulled the chain and brought the crowded train to a halt. 

 Imran died around 8.45 am, before the railway doctor could turn up from Sonarpur station. He had suffered heavy internal head injuries. 

 Enraged by the death, some passengers and residents vented their anger on the signal post by uprooting it. It had been put up only yesterday. 

 A 500-strong crowd gathered at the spot in a flash and started moving the signal post till it was uprooted. The common feeling was that had the post not been placed so precariously, the boy would not have been hit. There was no way we could resist such a strong crowd, said a senior officer of the Government Railway Police (GRP), who was present at the spot.

 Local trains in the south section came to a halt. 

 The Sonarpur GRP called for help from nearby police stations and the GRP from Ballygunge and Jadavpur to control the mob which threatened to snap the overhead wires. 

 The agitation continued for over two hours, forcing senior officers of the GRP and the railways to rush to the site to pacify the agitators, who would not let the police remove Imrans body. 

 Railway officials later said 19 trains were delayed by half an hour on an average and two pairs of local trains between Sealdah and Baruipur and Sealdah and Diamond Harbour were cancelled. 

 A case has been started and the body has been sent to NRS Medical College for post-mortem, said Nabarun Bhattacharjee, a Sealdah GRP officer.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Cry for neurologists

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Nov. 18: Wanted, neurologists and neurosurgeons.

 It would reduce the congestion in medical college hospitals in Calcutta where patients from outside flock because of lack of specialists in the districts.

 In other words, critically injured patients like Kuldeep Yadav who suffered cerebral haemorrhage after a road accident yesterday may not then be turned away from a state-run hospital like SSKM.

 Health department officials today said shortage of neurologists and neurosurgeons was coming in the way of expanding treatment facilities. In neurosurgery, there is need for more manpower if we have to expand treatment facilities to peripheral hospitals, said director of medical education Jayasree Mitra Ghosh. 

 Of the 316 postgraduate seats in the state, there are only two for neurology and two for neurosurgery. For general medicine, there are 31 seats; for general surgery 25 and 30 for gynaecology, officials said.

 There is also an integrated five-year course in neurosurgery, which a student can take up after completing MBBS. But health department sources said these seats usually remain vacant. 

 The sources said the first thing required for extending infrastructure is trained personnel, who can handle complicated neurosurgery cases like Yadavs.

 The 45-year-old, whose two-wheeler collided with a car, was refused admission as there was no bed vacant in the neurosurgery ward at SSKM. He was then rushed to the National Neurosciences Centre (NNC) on the Peerless Hospital premises where he underwent surgery. He is showing signs of recovery, said K. Sreedhar, medical director and head of the neurosurgery department of NNC.

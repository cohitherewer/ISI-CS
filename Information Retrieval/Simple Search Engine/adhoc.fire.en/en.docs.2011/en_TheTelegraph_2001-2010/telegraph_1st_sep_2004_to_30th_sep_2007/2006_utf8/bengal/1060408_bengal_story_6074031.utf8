The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Blame it on Mamata

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, April 7: The BJPs twin yatras have given the Congress a stick to beat Mamata Banerjee with.

 Now it will be easier for us to expose Mamata in the run-up to the Assembly polls. Its good that she has frustrated our efforts to tie up with her party, Margaret Alva, the AICC general secretary in charge of Bengal, said tonight.

 Here to oversee the partys poll preparations, Alva said the Congress had tried its best to forge an alliance to prevent a split in anti-Left votes. But Mamata backed out despite our repeated overtures to her. Now we should tell people why she prefers the (BJP-led) NDA to the Congress, she added.

 Mamata said the Congress has already been exposed ? as the main team of the CPM. 

 I waited till the last moment for the Congress to join the anti-Left platform to keep the CPM at bay. But it did not respond because of its hobnobbing with the CPM in Delhi. Now people know that it is the CPMs main team, she said.

 The Trinamul Congress chief had earlier called the Congress the CPMs B-team. 

 BJP general secretary Arun Jaitley met her tonight.

 Alva, though on the front foot regarding Mamata, could not be happy with feuds within her own party.

 She resented the manner in which party workers from Garden Reach, Burrabazar and Burdwan demonstrated at the party office for three days opposing the selection of candidates. All of them were chosen on the basis of consensus and there should not be any grievances, Alva said. 

 Behrampore MP Adhir Chowdhury has fielded Independents against three party nominees in Murshidabad. Alva said: I shall speak to him, so that he withdraws the Independent candidates.

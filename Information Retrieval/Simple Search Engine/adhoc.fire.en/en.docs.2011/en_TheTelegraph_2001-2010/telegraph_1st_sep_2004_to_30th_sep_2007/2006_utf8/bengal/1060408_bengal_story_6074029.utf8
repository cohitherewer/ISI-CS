The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 A clarification

 The quotes in Fridays news item ? EC video not enough proof: SP/Police boss splits hair on Subhas ? were wrongly attributed to Praveen Kumar, the superintendent of police, North 24-Parganas. 

 The report quoted Kumar as saying: There are many factors to be taken into account before we take any action. This is not a complaint concerning theft or dacoity. Moreover, the charges have been levelled against a senior state minister. So we need other circumstantial evidence to prove the allegation against (Subhas) Chakraborty?. I cannot say when the inquiry will be wound up. But we are trying our best to expedite it.

 The superintendent did not make any such comment. We regret the error.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Basu sermon to Buddha

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Oct. 30: Jyoti Basu today advised the government to be cautious while acquiring multi-crop land for industrial and infrastructure projects and to ensure enough compensation for the landlosers. 

 The comment, on the concluding day of the CPM state committee meeting, comes in the backdrop of a raging debate on the acquisition of farmland within the party, its allies and Opposition. 

 The government has to move cautiously while acquiring double-crop or three-crop land. Enough compensation has to be paid (to farmers), Basu said, reacting to complaints from Left Front partners that the state government had violated the coalitions policy. 

 The allies have said that it has been their policy to encourage new industry on the premises of closed factories or fallow or at best mono-crop land. 

 At Writers Buildings, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said the government is cautious.

 Basu will attend the next Left Front meeting, likely to be held on November 3. A source said his presence is required to ensure an amicable resolution of the land row within the front. 

 The next Left Front meeting is important. I have to be present. Detailed discussions (on land-related issues) will be held. We have to ensure front unity, said Basu. 

 The CPI, RSP and the Forward Bloc have even raised questions on transparency in the land deals and sops offered to the Tatas, Salim Group or Reliance. 

 CPM insiders said land issues were raised today. Leaders from Howrah, Hooghly and South 24-Parganas urged the party brass to prepare comprehensive policy guidelines on land acquisition as well as compensation and rehabilitation to clear the contradictions within the government, the party and the front. 

 A Hooghly leader said Singur, where several hundred acres of farmland have been acquired for Tata Motors, should be an exception rather than the rule.

 However, Haldia MP Lakshman Seth said the acquisition of 27,500 acres in the port town for a chemical hub, a special economic zone and a township will go ahead, though some of the plots there are multi-crop.

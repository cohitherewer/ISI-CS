The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 In the name of Constitution

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Nov. 30: Through the events leading to the rampage in Bengals seat of democracy and during it Mamata Banerjee was clutching a copy of the Indian Constitution.

 It was this she had waved in police officers faces, quo-ting from its articles, as she argued with them when they stopped her at Maitipara on her way to Singur.

 It was with her when she barged into the Assembly while party leaders vandalised it.

 The Trinamul Congress chief was well aware of the heavy police presence at Maitipara, near Dankuni, before her motorcade set out from the city around noon. With her were party faithfuls Madan Mitra and Shovon Chatterjee.

 When the convoy was sto- pped while approaching the Durgapur Expressway, she opened the car door, stood on the footboard and thrust the copy of the Constitution under officers noses.

 I wont create any trouble in Singur. Why are you preventing me from visiting the place? The Constitution gives us the right to hold meetings and express our opinion, she screamed at the police.

 Hooghly district magistrate Binod Kumar and superintendent Supratim Sarkar told her section 144 had been clamped in Singur.

 After arguing for about 15 minutes, Mamata tried to force her way though the cordon. 

 The officers then ordered women personnel to grab her and push her into a police Tata Sumo.

 You cannot rough me up this way and force me to go back. You have to arrest and produce me in court, Mamata protested, jostling with the policewomen.

 She was shoved into the car and sat sandwiched between the policewomen and a few of her companions till they were released at the Vidyasagar Setu toll plaza.

 On her way back to the city, she had first thought of meeting the governor but changed her mind after a few calls to her MLAs inside the Assembly. Since the House was in session, it was more important to go there, she said.

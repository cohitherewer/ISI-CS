 Calcutta, July 29: Struggling to cope with the tragedy, Jadavpur University today decided to ask police for a thorough inquiry.

 The incident is extremely unfortunate. We want a thorough investigation to know for sure how such a tragedy took place, registrar Rajat Banerjee said.

 It is unfortunate that the students did not inform us before planning the trek, he added.

 Four of the five students were members of the universitys rock climbing club, which routinely organises treks for student members. 

 But the group of five that went to the Ayodhya Hills had not followed many of the routine formalities. 

 As a rule, whenever such treks are organised, every student joining the team has to fill in a series of forms and provide all details about themselves. 

 They have to give an undertaking in writing stating the route they would take during the trip and the tools that they would be carrying.

 The university has to inform police and district administration of the place where the trek is being organised.

 These formalities are observed in order to ensure that the local police can constantly stay in touch with our students during the trek and can swing into action immediately if there is an accident, a university official said. 

 The university was completely in the dark about the whereabouts of the five students as none of them had informed the club about their programme. We were shocked when around 7 pm yesterday, we received a phone call from Purulia informing us about the incident, the official added.

 Police officers working on the case have informed Jadavpur University that the students were not carrying adequate equipment. 

 The university will start a probe of its own into how the four students who regularly participated in trekking programmes had planned their tour without the necessary gear. Preliminary police reports have revealed that the five were carrying only a tarpaulin sheet.

 It is also mandatory for the parents of every student participating in a trek to submit their consent in writing. The students are allowed to go on a trek only if the parents approve. 

 The registrar said: We are constantly in touch with the Purulia administration. We are trying our best to see the survivors return home safe.

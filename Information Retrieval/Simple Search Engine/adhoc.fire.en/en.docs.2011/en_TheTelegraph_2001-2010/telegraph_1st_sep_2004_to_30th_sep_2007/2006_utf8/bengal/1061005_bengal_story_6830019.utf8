The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Mollah suggests a change of course

 BISWAJIT ROY

 Calcutta, Oct. 4: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and Nirupam Sen may be trying to convince the Opposition of their rationale behind acquisition of farmland for industry, but land minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah is singing a different tune. 

 In his latest note to state CPM secretary Biman Bose, he has opposed the move to relax the rural land ceiling for cultivation of commercial crops as proposed by some agri-business companies. 

 The government has renewed its move to amend the land acquisition act after receiving feelers from corporates such as Hindustan Lever and Dabur, who want commercial farming of cash crops like jatropha, which produces biodiesel and medicinal herbs. 

 According to the act, one can hold only 12 acres of irrigated land and 17 acres of non-irrigated land. 

 Suggestions to relax the rural land ceiling will open the floodgates for land sharks who would displace small farmers. If we allow this in the name of commercial farming, jute and potato cultivators and those growing other cash crops would be ruined, Mollah told The Telegraph.

 The minister has also mooted the contours of a new policy draft on the compensation and rehabilitation of landlosers for the partys consideration (see box). 

 This includes a job for one member of each displaced farmers family, which runs counter to the governments policy, and a much higher payment for the land. 

 Mollah wants the party to forward his proposals to the Centre, asking it to amend the British-era land acquisition act and make them mandatory for all states. 

 But the state party brass are apparently not in the mood for a rethink as they fear that such conditions would scare away investors.

 The minister has apparently taken the cue from Orissas pact with Posco for a steel plant in Paradip, a copy of which he collected during his Puja break in Puri. 

 According to Mollah, Posco will provide a job to one member of each landloser family. We should also ask the big private sector projects to provide jobs to landlosers, he said.

 He admitted that some of the investors could run away from Bengal as their projects would cease to be cost effective, but insisted that they should be asked to bear the burden for a greater social good. 

 Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees government has decided to provide rehabilitation only to families living below the poverty line.

 Mollah also wants sharecroppers to get double the amount the government is planning to give them.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Office as usual for CM, but...

 - Writers to be closed, says bandh leader

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Dec. 13: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee will be in office tomorrow but he may not get a file if he wants to go through one.

 The reason: the CPM-controlled co-ordination committee of state government employees.

 The union today ridiculed the administrations efforts to maintain normality. 

 What normality? There will not be a single peon to open the rooms at Writers tomorrow, let alone administrative employees, said Jyoti Prasad Basu, its general secretary. 

 Nearly five lakh govern-ment employees will stay away from office in Bengal, he bragged.

 I will be in office as usual, Bhattacharjee said after a meeting at Writers Buildings to discuss tomorrows transport and law and order. 

 Chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb, home secretary Prasad Ranjan Ray, director-general of police A.K. Vohra and city police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee were among those present. 

 Basu said no government driver will work tomorrow. So ministers and officials will have to come to office in police vehicles if they want to.

 Deb said tonight that ministers and officials would be provided with police vehicles if they ask for them. 

 Administrative steps are being taken to ensure normality in all respects and necessary circulars have already been despatched to district magistrates and police chiefs across the state, he added. 

 Transport minister Subhas Chakraborty, who asked ordinary people to walk if they wanted to work, said he would come to office. Unlike many others, he would probably have a motorcade at his service. 

 The minister added, though, that he would return home if he finds his office locked. 

 I have particularly requested trade unions to ensure availability of transport to those stranded at railway stations. Left Front chairman Biman Bose asked me to oversee that these passengers can reach their destination safely, the transport minister added.

 Inspector-general, law and order, Raj Kanojia, said elaborate police arrangements were being made to maintain law and order. 

 In big districts such as the 24-Parganas and Darjeeling, two-three platoons of policemen will be deployed, he said, adding that bandh supporters will be prevented from obstructing traffic.

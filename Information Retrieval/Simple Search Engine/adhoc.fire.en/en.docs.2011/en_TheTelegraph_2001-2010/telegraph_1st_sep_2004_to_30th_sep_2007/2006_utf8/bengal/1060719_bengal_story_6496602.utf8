The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Laptop pitch for grapes

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, July 18: The CPM peasants wing took recourse to hi-tech today to drive home the point that Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees government was not undermining agriculture by acquiring farmland for industries. 

 In a powerpoint presentation with the aid of laptops, Krishak Sabha leaders tried to motivate their district counterparts to encourage industrialisation and promote cultivation of vineyards and orchards in arid zones to compensate the loss of farmland elsewhere. 

 Samar Baora, the Sabhas state secretary, made the presentation on grape cultivation on the laterite soil of Bankura, Purulia, West Midnapore, Birbhum and parts of Burdwan at the end of its state council meeting and distributed CDs of the lesson among the audience. 

 The Sabha has sent a team to Nashik, which grows grapes in plenty, to study the conditions there. We are convinced that grapes can be cultivated here as well, said Madan Ghosh, a CPM state secretariat member.

 But it was difficult to tell if Baoras initiative impressed those present. Many peasant leaders chatted or slipped out for tea as he spoke.

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had earlier sought the Sabhas support for his industrialisation drive. Baora today called the apprehensions about land acquisition aired by some of the Left Front allies and the Opposition baseless. We stand by the government and will continue to campaign in favour of industrialisation. Investors would set up units at sites of their choice and we cant dictate to them. 

 In the same context, Bhattacharjee had said that the days of command economy are over.

 Baora added: Those who want the government to goad the industry to nest in backward areas should take the initiative to find such socially committed investors.

 Unions shut door on worker widow

 RABI BANERJEE 

 Krishnagar, 

 Dec. 13: When trade unions are up in arms against 

 the Centres anti-labour policies, their leaders turned 

 away the widow of a worker who died in a mill mishap. 

 Ordinary villagers earned for Hanifa Sheikh what neither the CPM nor the Congress unions could a compensation. 

 The unions did not take interest in young Hanifas plight as her husband Meher was not a union member.

 Meher Sheikh, 35, died a day after he joined Plassey Sugar Mill at Kaligunj in Nadia, 150 km from Calcutta. He fell into a machine that chops the crushed sugarcane and transforms it into pulp.

 Mehers father Abdul Karim, 60, and Hanifa, 23, pleaded with the mills Citu and Intuc leaders to approach the management for the compensation on their behalf.

 Turned away, they went to the Kaligunj village elders, who are more used to settling marital discords in conciliation meetings.

 My husband was the breadwinner for us. What will we do now? Well have to starve, Hanifa told the elders. 

 One of them, Asgar Ali Sheikh, said he was touched by the appeal. With some 500 slogan-shouting villagers, he started a demonstration in front of the sugar mill yesterday. The demand: Rs 2 lakh for Mehers widow. 

 The management, often stubborn with the unions, realised this protest was different. So we decided to sit with the villagers, said deputy general manager B.L. Sharma. 

 Sharma tried to reason with the villagers that Meher was not a mill worker in the strictest sense of the term. He only used to work under a contractor attached to us, said Sharma. However, the villagers would not relent.

 The meeting continued for four hours. 

 No trade union played a role in it. We invited the local MLA and the chief of the panchayat samiti to be witnesses to the pact, said Sharma.

 Hanifa got Rs 50,000 at the end of the meeting.

 Although late in the day, the Citu leadership realised that the villagers had stolen a march on them by directly negotiating with the management. After the widow went home happy, the union demanded Rs 1 lakh for her. 

 Yes, we have demanded Rs 1 lakh from the management for Mehers widow. We are hopeful of realising our demand, said S.M. Sadi, a Citu district leader. 

 The Intuc union was unfazed. Why should we fight for Meher? He wasnt a member of our union, said its leader Lokenath Agarwal.

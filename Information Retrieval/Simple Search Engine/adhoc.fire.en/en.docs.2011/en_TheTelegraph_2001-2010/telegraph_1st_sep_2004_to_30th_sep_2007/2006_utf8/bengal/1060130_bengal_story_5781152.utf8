The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Rao XIX on Mission Bengal - II

 OUR BUREAU 

 Calcutta, Jan. 29: K.J. Rao, the special adviser to the Election Commission, and his team of 18 observers are set to tour Bengal for the second time in a month.

 N.B. Dhal, the observer who had angered CPM leaders by using a Trinamul letter-head to scribble instructions to a government officer, would be part of the team that will begin its weeklong tour from February 1. 

 The mission will be the same as last time ? to monitor the revision of electoral rolls and weed out bogus voters. 

 Rao, the officer most credited with ensuring free and fair polls in Bihar last year, will visit West Midnapore. 

 The observers will take stock of developments since their last visit and will check how far action has been initiated on complaints they had referred to the state administration then, a senior Election Commission official from Delhi said.

 Asked if there was still enough time to make changes in the electoral rolls which are scheduled to be published in mid-February, the official said: The updation of rolls is a continuous process. If we feel the need to include names of genuine voters and delete those of false voters, well continue to do so even after February. The electoral roll is the basic document and were trying to make it as clean as possible.

 During his last visit, Rao had zeroed in on ghost voters, including Bangladeshis, in Nadia. This time, the commi-ssion wants him to take stock of the situation in a Maoist stronghold, an official said.

 In West Midnapore, the rebels have a strong presence in Jhargram, Binpur and Gopiballavpur. In the 2001 polls, the Left Front had bagged 18 out of 21 seats in the district. 

 The office of the states chief electoral officer has already begun compiling a report detailing the action taken on complaints registered with the observers during their last visit as well as the instructions they issued. It will be placed before the commission on Tuesday.

 This is the first time that the poll panel has deployed observers in Bengal during electoral rolls revision.

 In November, it sent five teams to monitor the process. Over 25 state officials were showcaused for neglecting their duty of receiving applications for inclusion and deletion of names. In end-November, chief election commissioner B.B. Tandon met officials of Burdwan presidency and Jalpaiguri division. In January, 19 observers ? one for each district ? came down to probe complaints about bogus voters.

 The CPM repeated its ob- jection to the officers allowing the media to follow them about. Observers are welcome but if they take media personnel along again, we will have to take up the matter with the commission, state party secretary Anil Biswas said.

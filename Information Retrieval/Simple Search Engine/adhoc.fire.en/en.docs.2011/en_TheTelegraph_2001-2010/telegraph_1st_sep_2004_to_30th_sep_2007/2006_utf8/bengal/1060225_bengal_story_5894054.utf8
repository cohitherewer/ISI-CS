The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 CPM seeks graffiti guidelines

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Feb. 24: The CPM today sought from the Election Commission guidelines on campaign through graffiti, saying the panel had earlier issued conflicting orders on the subject.

 Citing the previous orders, state CPM secretary Anil Biswas sent a letter to the commission tonight, asking it to clarify which order a party should go by. 

 At the poll panels behest, the government issued a cir- cular yesterday stating that public and private buildings cannot be defaced anywhere in the state.

 The commission had requested the government to imp- lement the West Bengal Prevention of Property Defacement Act, 1976, ahead of the polls. 

 The law says neither public nor private property in the state can be defaced. 

 But while laying down the rules earlier, the government had issued a notification that left out private buildings in Calcutta. Now that it has decided to implement the act in its entirety, it will have to publish a gazette notification.

 Biswas said a poll panel order dated April 23, 2004, says public buildings will not be allowed to be defaced, while a September 2, 2005, order states that walls of private buildings can be used if the owner permits.

 Now the EC is requesting the state to implement the 1976 act. How come the 2004 and 2005 orders are different from provisions of the act? Which one should we follow? Thats why we want EC to give us clean and comprehensive guidelines. We will wait for a reply and till then ask party workers not to write on the walls.

 After a CPM state secretariat meeting, Jyoti Basu said: We will ask EC to tell us what should be the mode of campaign for the polls.

 The SUCI said it would continue to write on the walls.

 Malaysia 

job racket

 Barasat, July 12: Sixty-four labourers who went to Malaysia after being promised lucrative jobs are stranded in the country virtually without food and shelter, reports our correspondent. 

 Paschimbanga Khet Majdoor Samity, an NGO, has lodged a complaint against three persons who had promised the workers from Nadia and North 24-Parganas jobs with fat pay packets about six months ago. 

 But when they landed in Kuala Lumpur, they were paid peanuts, and when they protested, their employer took away their passports. 

 Police have started a probe.

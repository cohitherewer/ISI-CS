The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 State soft on child labour 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Oct. 10: The state is fighting shy of a crackdown on child labour. 

 Amendments to the Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, 1986 which came into force today may have banned hiring under-14 children at homes, eateries, spas and gyms, in addition to other workplaces where it was already prohibited, but the scene on the ground remains the same. 

 In stained clothes and unkempt hair, children below 14 are still serving roti, tadka and tea to customers in the heart of Calcutta.

 The law spells out the crime and punishment minimum six months jail and a fine of Rs 20,000 plus more if allegations of harassment are proved but Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees government is not keen to enforce it immediately.

 At present, well not punish anyone. Well just warn those violating the law, minister of state for labour Anadi Sahu said. 

 The reason: Not too many people are aware of it.

 NGO activists had been doubting the political will to end child labour all along.

 Im from Bihar and working here for the past couple of months. My owner does not pay me any money but provides me with lunch and dinner, said Mahesh Verma, an 11-year-old boy who works in a tea stall on CR Avenue.

 Twelve-year-old Pramod Sau, employed at an eatery at Tirettabazar off CR Avenue, said: I wake up at 4 in the morning, clean utensils and then cook.

 Instead of bringing to book those who make many like Mahesh and Pramod toil for a pittance or nothing, the government has decided to make a list of such people. 

 The labour department said officers are being sent to various places to spread the word about the recent amendments. Our primary job is to make people aware of the law, the minister said. 

 The state also wants to hold talks with the Centre for an alternative to support the children who would be deprived of their earnings. 

 The Centre has to understand that in a country like India where poverty has increased in the last 15 years, it is very important to come up with an alternative to make the law a success. Many families survive on the earnings of these children, Sahu said.

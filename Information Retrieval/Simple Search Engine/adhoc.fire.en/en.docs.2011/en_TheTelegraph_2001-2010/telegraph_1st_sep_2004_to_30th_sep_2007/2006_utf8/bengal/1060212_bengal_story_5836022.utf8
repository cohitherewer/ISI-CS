The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Park Street shop looted

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Feb. 11: A gang of robbers broke into an opticals shop off Park Street this morning and fled with Rs 49,000. 

 Police arrested three youths late in the evening and recovered Rs 42,000. 

 A search is on for the rest of the group.

 Going by their modus operandi, the police suspect this could be the gang that has cleaned out a series of shops recently. Yesterday, too, four cellphone shops in Bowbazar were raided, with the burglars walking away with phones worth around Rs 15 lakh.

 These youths, in their early 30s, would break into shops by slightly lifting the iron shutters and then slip inside. The pattern was the same for the thefts at a string of mobile shops yesterday and even todays incident, said a senior officer of Park Street police station.

 The arrested trio ? Mohammed Farooq, Manzur Alam and Umesh Paswan ? hail from Motihari district in Bihar. The gang had put up at a hotel in Howrah for the last few days. 

 This evening, they were arrested from one of their hideouts in south Calcutta. 

 The robbery came to light this morning when employees of the shop arrived and found a portion of the iron shutter jutting out from below. Then they discovered that the cash box was empty. 

 However, nothing else had been touched.

 Officers probing the case said that going by the shops it has targeted, the gang seems to have a fascination for mobile phones.

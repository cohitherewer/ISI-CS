The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 SHORT TAKES

 Durgapur: Mrigen Pal has a surefire formula for success ? bring on the celebs. 

 On his campaign trail, the Congress candidate from Durgapur-2 in Burdwan district wants party chief Sonia Gandhi, no less. And he has apparently been promised her presence. 

 But everyone knows how busy the lady from 10 Janpath is. So, till Sonia arrives, the star-struck candidate will bank on actor-MP Govinda to work his magic on voters. Govinda will address a rally soon at various places in Durgapur. If we can have both Sonia Gandhi and Govinda to campaign for the Congress, then no one can stop me from winning, says Pal. 

 Midnapore: With the showcause 

 came the shock. Nirmal Samanta, the Congress candidate from 

 Daspur in West Midnapore and a primary schoolteacher, recently 

 received a showcause from the election department for not 

 turning up at a training session for polling officers! A 

 red-faced administration has admitted to a mistake 

 and ordered an inquiry. 

 Mathurapur (South 24-Parganas): If posters cant be pasted on walls, why not use the sky? Heavyweight CPM candidate Kanti Ganguly has struck upon a novel way of campaigning ? kites (red, of course) bearing the hammer-and-sickle symbol and slogans are dotting the sky over Mathurapur. I thought of this mode of campaign myself, Kanti announces proudly. When two kites compete, one of them is bound to cut loose. These kites will fall on rooftops with my symbol and slogans. Isnt this innovative? You bet!

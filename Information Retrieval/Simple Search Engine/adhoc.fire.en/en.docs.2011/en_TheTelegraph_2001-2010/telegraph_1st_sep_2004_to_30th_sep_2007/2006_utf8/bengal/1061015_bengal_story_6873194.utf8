 Broker with laptop amp; Rs 2 lakh missing

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Oct. 14: Atul Choudhury, a 26-year-old share broker who was carrying a laptop and Rs 2 lakh, apparently went missing from the heart of the city yesterday evening. 

 Although his family is yet to receive a ransom call, police havent ruled out kidnapping. 

 We are trying to ascertain whether there was foul play or he disappeared on his own, said Gyanwant Singh, the detective department deputy commissioner.

 According to a complaint Atuls family lodged with the Hare Street police station, he called up his mother around 5.30 pm yesterday and said he was going to receive a payment from a businessman on Hare Street and would later meet another client at Bhowanipore. He was to return home around 9 pm. 

 He never did. His mobile was switched off. His father, a bank manager, and younger brother went to the police this morning. Atuls elder brother is in the UK.

 The family said he had the money and the laptop with him.

 We have alerted all 48 police stations in the city and our counterparts in the adjoining districts. We are trying to find out from where he made the last call to his mother, an officer said. 

 Atul left home for his Dalhousie office around 10.30 am. He called up his mother around 1 pm and told her he was with friends and would return home early. 

 We questioned some of his friends and businessmen whom he used to meet everyday. We also interrogated the businessman from Bhowanipore, who denied any meeting with Atul yesterday, an investigating officer said. 

 Plainclothesmen are keeping an eye on railway stations and bus terminuses. We have asked the mobile service provider to give details of calls from his phone before 5.30 pm, the officer said.

 The police are not sure whether Atul went to Hare Street. Some other businessmen close to him are also being questioned.

 Highways back on track

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Siliguri, Sept. 16: National Highway 31A was reopened this morning after the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) cleared around 17 landslides between Sevoke and Kalijhora.

 Road links with Sikkim and Kalimpong had been snapped yesterday. 

 BRO officials used dynamites today to blast some major landslides, like those in Kalijhora, Seti Jhora and SNT Jhora. 

 In some patches, where the road condition is precarious, we are allowing only one-way movement. There, vehicles are being allowed one at a time on alternate routes, a senior BRO official said.

 The traffic movement was slow today. 

 Sanjeev Moktan, a Kalimpong resident who was among hundreds waiting on the highway, said: It took me the whole day to reach Kalimpong from Siliguri, a journey which on a normal day can be covered in less than three hours.

 Movement of smaller vehicles on NH 31A began last evening but had to be stopped a short while later because a truck had got stuck near Kalijhora. 

 Another highway NH 55 connecting Darjeeling with Gangtok was back on track yesterday after a landslide near Tindharia was cleared. The toy train, whose tracks were buried under debris in several places, has also started running. 

 As many as 20 landslides blocked the road to the hills yesterday morning.

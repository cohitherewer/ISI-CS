 Phantoms revenge on ex-boss

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Comic caper 

Krishnagar, Nov. 2: Sacked, a 23-year-old in Nadia dressed up like Phantom and attacked his former employer, his wife and daughter today, grievously injuring them.

 The three were operated on in the Shaktinagar district hospital and their condition is stated to be stable.

 The youth, Abhijit Biswas, was beaten up by residents and was admitted in a critical condition to the same hospital. He is under arrest.

 Police said Abhijit was unemployed. So, his neighbour Tarun Kanti Saha, 45, a businessman dealing in fertilisers, in Nadias Dignagar, about 80 km from Calcutta, hired him to run errands.

 But as Abhijit was lazy and not sincere at work, he was fired a few months ago. He felt humiliated and set out to take revenge, a police officer investigating the case said. Interrogating his parents, we learnt Abhijit was influenced by cinema.

 Son of a small farmer, Abhijit wrapped himself from waist up with crepe bandage. He then pulled a brief over his black trousers. He covered his face with a black mask, the type Hrithik Roshan donned in Krrish.

 He got two knives and dangled them from his hips like Phantom wears his holster. He also stuck a toy pistol in his belt. With his make-up complete with a black cape hung from his shoulders, he scaled the wall of Tarun babus house around 6.30 am, the officer said.

 Ghoshs wife, Krishna, was sprinkling water on the plants when Abhijit attacked her. Hearing her cries, her 18-year-old daughter Kaberi, rushed down the stairs. When I came down, Abhijit attacked me, said Kaberi.

 Ghosh was woken up by the commotion. I saw my daughter and wife lying in a pool of blood and cried out for help. Suddenly, Abhijit jumped on me and tried to murder me, he said.

 Residents broke open the main gate. Seeing the blood-splattered victims, a mob beat up Abhijit with sticks and rods.

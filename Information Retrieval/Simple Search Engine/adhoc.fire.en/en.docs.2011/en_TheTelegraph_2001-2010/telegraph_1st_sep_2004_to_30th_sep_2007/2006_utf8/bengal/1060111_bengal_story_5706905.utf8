 Citu drives out skilled workers

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Durgapur, Jan. 10: Their political bosses might want them to shun militancy, but habits die hard and Citu supporters at Graphite India Ltd have shut the plants doors on 32 skilled technicians recruited last month. 

 The CPM labour wing is preventing the Industrial Training Institute (ITI) pass-outs, who joined on December 12 and worked for a week, from entering the factory.

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee will inaugurate a Rs 200-crore expansion programme of the Durgapur plant on Thursday.

 But the union leaders do not appear bothered. They hold that employees already on contract were competent to do the same job but were denied the opportunity. 

 Nitya Hari Dutta, the general secretary of the Citu-affiliated Graphite India Ltd Mazdoor Union, alleged that most of the new technicians are unskilled and inexperienced to work in the field for which they had been chosen. The appointment procedure was also not transparent. We will not allow them to join work, Dutta said.

 The company, which produces electrodes and also has units in Bangalore and Nashik, has sought the intervention of the labour department and the Burdwan authorities.

 Deputy labour commissioner (Durgapur circle) Pashupati Ghosh, who met management representatives and the union leaders on January 5, said he would inquire into the selection procedure. 

 Till the probe is over, the 32 workers have been asked not to come to the plant. 

 Dutta said the company has to either promote competent contract workers or invite fresh applications through the local employment exchange.

 The management has refused to consider the demand. 

 Senior personnel manager P.K. Banerjee said: We had collected the names of candidates from the local employment exchange and through newspaper advertisements. Theres no question of lack of transparency. The plants technical selection committee cleared the selection of the 32 skilled workmen on probation.

 The manager was at a loss about why the protests began days after the new employees had joined. The union, he added, had been informed about the selection at a meeting attended by Dutta.

 The union leader said: We did not initially realise that the workers recruited were not skilled enough. After they joined, we found out they did not have the required skill. 

 The plant works in three shifts and has around 450 permanent workers and 300 on contract. Officers number 170. It produces 1,400 tonnes of electrode every month and plans to increase capacity to 3,000 tonnes when the modernisation and expansion is completed, a senior official said. 

 Banerjee said: The new workers are qualified. They have passed out from Industrial Training Institutes.

 Another official added that the company needs skilled workers to operate the new, sophisticated machinery.

 The district Citu leadership is supporting the Graphite India union. What the management has done is wrong. It has recruited unskilled workers. Before taking the step, the managers should have spoken to the union, said Debabrata Banerjee, the general secretary of the district Citu unit. 

 Ghosh said the inquiry would include scrutiny of the selection procedure and eligibility of those recruited. 

 The union leaders remained noncommittal about what they would do if the procedures were found to be in order.

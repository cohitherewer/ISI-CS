 Cleared: cell for green power

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Jan. 1: The government has decided to set up a green power corporation to exclusively deal with generation, transmission and distribution of power from renewable sources like the sun, wind and bio-mass. 

 The move was finalised at a power department meeting a few days ago and a draft on how the proposed corporation would work is being readied. 

 We decided to set up the corporation to promote power generation from renewable sources in an organised manner. We also plan to connect the power with the states transmission network and so such a body was essential, said Sunil Mitra, the power department secretary.

 The Centres target is to electrify all households in the country by 2012. In our state, it will not be possible to provide thermal or hydel power to all households. So, we have to concentrate on renewable energy, Mitra said. 

 The government has lined up several thermal power plants, to come up across Bengal over the next few years and over 2,000 mw will be added to the existing capacity by 2008. While the power scenario will turn brighter, it will increase the pollution level. 

 We have to cut down on the pollution. It is for this reason we have to develop a parallel environment-friendly power-generation system so that in the future, we can effectively switch over to pollution-free power, said S.P. Gonchowdhury, the director of West Bengal Renewable Energy Development Agency.

 To encourage generation of power from renewable energy sources, the Centre has also come up with incentives. An official said: In pockets of Gujarat and Maharashtra, municipalities offer tax rebates. Talks are on with the income-tax department to offer such rebates to individuals who help the government promote green power.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 AMRI takes over Suraksha 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Jan. 21: Suraksha Hospital in Salt Lake has found a lifeline in the Emami and Shrachi group, which owns AMRI Hospitals in Dhakuria.

 On December 13, 2005, The Telegraph had reported that AMRI Hospitals had signed an agreement with the Suraksha group for a possible takeover and was about to start the mandatory due diligence for the final acquisition.

 Today, the Emami-Shrachi combine announced the acquisition. 

 Our new hospital will provide facilities in adherence to international standards. From the best medical treatment and multiple innovations to compassionate nursing and efficient complementary support ? diet and housekeeping for example ? we will offer the entire gamut of outstanding healthcare, said S.K. Todi, director of AMRI Hospitals and chairman of the Shrachi group of companies.

 The 160-bed Suraksha hospital will undergo a Rs-5 crore upgrade and will be known as AMRI Hospitals, Salt Lake, in its new avatar. 

 Suraksha still has sophisticated instruments and equipment. The facilities available include cardiology, neo-natal, critical care, intensive trauma and nephrology units.

 One of the major reasons for the acquisition, according to AMRI officials, was the location of the hospital. Besides Salt Lake and neighbouring areas, it will cater to New Town, now coming up at Rajarhat. With this takeover, AMRI will have a strategic presence in both south and north Calcutta, an official added.

 We will work towards transparency as far as treatment and billings are concerned, said Aditya V. Agarwal, director, Emami group and AMRI Hospitals.

 Excessive billing was a recurrent complaint against Surakhsha.

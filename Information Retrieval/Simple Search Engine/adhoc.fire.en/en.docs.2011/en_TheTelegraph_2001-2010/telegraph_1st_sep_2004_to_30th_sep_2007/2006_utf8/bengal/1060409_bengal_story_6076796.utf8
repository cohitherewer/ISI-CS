 Gun amp; bombs in Burrabazar

 A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta, April 8: Armed extortionists last night tried to rob a Burrabazar businessman at gunpoint and then fled hurling bombs at eyewitnesses. 

 Although police were informed immediately, no arrests have been made. But some porters who were hanging around chased the goons. 

 Ajay Kumar, deputy commissioner of police, central division, said the incident took place around 10.30 pm in front of a telephone booth owned by Ranjan Kumar Shaw off Jamunalal Bajaj Street. 

 Shaw had closed his shop and was about to go home. As soon as he came down the road, three persons, all in their 20s, intercepted him, said Kumar.

 They surrounded him and one of them took out a gun. They tried to snatch a leather bag from Shaws hand. But Shaw held the bag tight. When the goons tried to pin him down, he yelled to attract the attention of other traders, said an officer of the Burrabazar police station.

 To stop his screams, the youth with the gun hit Shaw on the head with the weapon. 

 The trader slumped on the road but a some residents, most of them porters sitting on pavement, rushed to the spot. There were no other traders because most of them left, the officer added.

 One of the onlookers, Biren Moitra, came to Shaws rescue. But the miscreants assaulted him too, but then sensing trouble they started hurling bombs as they fled. 

 After preliminary investigations, the police said the attack could be by local extortionists. 

 It seems, they were demanding money from the trader for the past few months and he refused to oblige, said a Burrabazar police officer. 

 A local businessman said: We knew the police would not do anything. Locals gave them a hot chase, but they could do nothing when the miscreants started hurling bombs. 

 Burrabazar has recently seen a spurt in crime. In February, burglars broke into a mobile phone shop and decamped with three phones and Rs 1.5 lakh.

 People of the locality rushed Shaw to Calcutta Medical College and Hospital as blood was oozing from his head. 

 Officers at the local police station, headed by OC A.K. Lahiri, held meetings to chalk out a plan to arrest the culprits. We are hopeful they will be tracked down soon because they were from local gangsters who operate in the Burrabazar?Posta area, he said.

 Singur, Dec. 5: As over 1,300 people worked on a war footing on the fields of Gopalnagar to fence off the 997 acres to be handed over to Tata Motors, some villagers resolved to carry on with their protest against the acquisition. 

 They are fencing off the area, but we have not given our land. We will lose our livelihood without it. What will we eat? asked 67-year-old Geetarani Koley, surrounded by five other women who, like her, are on a fast. 

 For the mother of four sons taking part in the first agitation of her life, the familys 2-bigha plot is a matter of life and death. 

 Jomi chole gele na khete peye morbo. Anashan-e mara jaoa tar theke bhalo (Well die of hunger without our land. Its better to die in a hunger strike), said Geetarani, as other residents of Gopalnagar looked on at the six members of the Krishi Jomi Banchao Committee. 

 At Ghosh Para, some distance away, and Beraberi village, 10 men led by Trinamul MLA Rabindranath Bhattacharya are also on a fast. 

 Farmers took a pledge today to sow potato seeds to defy the governments diktat. Itll be a mistake if the government thinks that the battle is won by fencing off the area, said Snehasish Chakraborty, the Hooghly president of the Trinamul Youth Congress. 

 While the administration and the CPM district leadership may earn brownie points for meeting the fencing deadline set by chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, the dissenting voices in the villages were clear. 

 Khasherbheri, where police clashed with villagers on Friday night, wore a deserted look with many still behind bars and over a hundred absconding, but there was no missing the undercurrent against the administration. The police barged into our homes without any provocation and beat us up. They ransacked our small grocery store. My elder son is in hospital and another son is under arrest and they said outsiders created all the problems, said a frail Biphol Patra, walking towards the tube-well to fetch water. 

 Another villager, Dilip Polen, came forward to lend a helping hand to the 70-plus man, struggling to come to terms with the shock. 

 The district police denied the charges. The trouble was created by outsiders and they attacked us with bows, arrows, acid bulbs and even swords. We chased them away, said a senior officer. 

 An official said that the villagers still protesting against the land acquisition are mostly unrecorded sharecroppers who have got nothing by way of compensation.

 The director of industries, M.V. Rao, held out a ray of hope for them. We have started the process of registering the unrecorded bargadars. The government has decided to give them some compensation as well. 

 But an eerie silence hung over the main bazaar around Shibtala More, the meeting point for local youths.

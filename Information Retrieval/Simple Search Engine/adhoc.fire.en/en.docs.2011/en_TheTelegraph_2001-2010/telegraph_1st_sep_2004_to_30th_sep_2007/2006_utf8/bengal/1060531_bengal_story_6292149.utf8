The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Infosys on Rajarhat recce

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, May 30: Infosys, keen to set up a 100-acre campus in the city, surveyed a plot in Rajarhat today. 

 Two company representatives had a look at 750 acres owned by the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation (WBIDC) about half an hours drive from the airport.

 When the price of land in the city and on its outskirts is being perceived to be one of the main roadblocks to IT investment in the state, the WBIDC plot is expected to turn the tide favourably. 

 Government sources said the corporation is likely to be more flexible with the land rate than Hidco (the Housing Infrastructure Development Corporation), which has refused to go below Rs 2.16 crore an acre. 

 Bengals rate of growth in 

 IT exports dipped below the previous years and lower 

 than the national average last year. 

 Most of the WBIDC plot would be used for industrial purposes, confirmed G.D. Gautama, the principal secretary of the information technology department. But it wouldnt be reserved for IT alone.

 Infosys would invest Rs 250 crore in the 100-acre campus.

 Its senior vice-president, commercial and facility, H.R. Binod, and Bhubaneswar-based regional manager Niladri Mishra today met the new IT minister, Debesh Das. 

 They also held a meeting with Sabyasachi Sen, the principal secretary of the department of commerce and industries.

 Das said: They seemed very optimistic.

 The Infosys team is expected to get back to the Bengal government and reveal its plan of action in a month.

 The IT department, stifled by the lack of land, had earlier said it would acquire 630 acres in phases and try to convince companies to invest in places away from Calcutta. 

 Over a dozen IT parks are slated to come up in Salt Lake and Rajarhat with a built-up area of 13.3 million square feet over the next 30 months. Four of them would be in Rajarhat and the rest in Sector V and neighbouring areas.

 Gautama said if the state is targeting a 15 per cent share of the national revenue in IT services and 20 per cent in IT-enabled servi-ces by 2010, it has to be competitive in every way possible.

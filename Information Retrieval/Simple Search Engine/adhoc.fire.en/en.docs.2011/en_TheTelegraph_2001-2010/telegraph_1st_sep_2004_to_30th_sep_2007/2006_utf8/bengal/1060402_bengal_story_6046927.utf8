The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Toll takes toll of VIP cars and bribe fleet

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 1: The days of free-trippers on Vidyasagar Setu ended today with a private company taking charge of the toll plazas. 

 After losing lakhs of rupees in revenue, the Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners handed over the running of the booths to SMSL-IRD in exchange for an annual payment of Rs 20.07 crore.

The new companys officials manned both sides 

of the toll plaza to ensure no vehicle managed to dodge past the glass windows, 

causing consternation among a section of motorists and a mini snarl (picture

 Truck drivers, who regularly cross the bridge about the same time early in the morning, were surprised to see long queues on the approach roads.

 Earlier, there were no queues as a large number of trucks crossed the bridge without halting at the toll plaza. Their drivers, police and the plaza employees were allegedly hand in glove. 

 The known faces that gave the trucks their pass permit were missing this morning. 

 Trouble started after the new officials blocked the way of a private car that tried to get past the plaza without paying toll. The driver tried to convince them that the car belonged to a senior police officer of Lalbazar and had been crossing the bridge for three years without paying a paisa. 

 Some more cars bearing the sticker on duty, Govt. of West Bengal faced a similar situation. 

 Some drivers tried to seek help from policemen on duty on the bridge, but they did not come forward. Most drivers paid the toll. Some, though, preferred to take Foreshore Road to enter Calcutta crossing the Howrah bridge. 

 I was personally present near the entry point and made it clear that they must either pay the toll or take another route. Please dont bring in Lalbazar or Writers (Buildings) or drop the name of a Dada. We will not take note of who the owner of the car is. No vehicle is exempted from paying toll except ambulances and those belonging to the fire brigade and the police on duty on the bridge, said SMSL-IRD spokesperson Ramesh Rawat.

 Two police jeeps with officers sitting on the front seat paid the toll and crossed the plaza without any argument.

 The Telegraph had earlier quoted Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners officials as saying that hundreds of vehicles cross the bridge regularly by bribing the police and the toll plaza staff.

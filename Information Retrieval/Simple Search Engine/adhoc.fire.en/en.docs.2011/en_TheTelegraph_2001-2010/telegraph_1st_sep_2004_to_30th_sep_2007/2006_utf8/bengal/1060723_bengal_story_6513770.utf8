 Malda, July 22: Twelve people were killed and 48 injured when a matador ferrying them from a wedding hit a tree last night on the Malda-Nalagola highway.

 The bridegroom, Sujoy Kisku, survived with injuries. His new wife. Rekha, escaped the crash because she was travelling in another vehicle. The grooms father, Lalu Kisku, was among the dead.

 The accident occurred near Maheshpur village in Bamangola, about 280 km from Calcutta.

 The front portion of the matador was smashed. We had to use a gas cutter to get the bodies out, Anil Roy, the officer-on-charge of Bamangola police station, said.

 The driver of the matador and most of the 65 people packed into it were drunk when they had set out from Bijahalbari village, where the ceremony took place, police said.

 According to the police, drinking pachani, a local brew, is common at tribal weddings. 

 The injured were taken to Malda Sadar Hospital after first-aid at the Modipukur primary health centre. The driver is absconding.

 We were supposed to start at 4 in the afternoon but could not do so as the driver of the matador was drunk since morning, Sujoy said from his hospital bed.

 He thanked his stars that his wife, Rekha Hembram, was alive. It was sheer providence that my wife was not in the matador.

 Sujoy said Rekhas parents decided against sending their daughter in the matador as the driver, Rakshit Roy, was drunk.

 Malda district superintendent of police Dilip Mondal held Rakshit responsible for the tragedy. He was drunk when he was driving. He lost control and the matador hit the tree, he said. 

 At the Malda hospital, another ordeal awaited the families of the injured. They lay in the corridors for hours as there were no doctors or nurses around. They were finally treated after district magistrate Chittaranjan Das intervened.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Train suicide by jilted girl

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Ranaghat 

 (Nadia), June 1: A college student apparently spurned 

 in love ended her life by jumping in front of a running 

 train at Pairadanga station today.

 Anindita Ghosh, 21, had come to the station, about 60 km from Calcutta, with her boyfriend around 8 am. Eyewitnesses said the third year English honours student of a girls college in central Calcutta had an argument with him and jumped on the tracks as a train was entering the station.

 I saw the girl talking excitedly with the boy. Suddenly she jumped on the tracks when the Shantipur local from Sealdah entered the station, said Bhavesh Kundu, a fruit seller.

 Train services were suspended for about 15 minutes.

 Police said Anindita had left her home in Agarpara, 20 km from Calcutta, yesterday. She had told her parents that she was going to a classmates at Barrackpore and would return this morning.

 But Anindita went to her boyfriends house at Pairadanga and stayed there at night. Inquiry revealed that the girl was opposed to a marriage her father had arranged. She had an altercation with her boyfriend on the platform as he was not ready to marry her. The boy said he could not marry as he was unemployed, a police officer said.

 A search has been launched for the boy who disappeared after the incident.

 Police got the telephone number of Aninditas home from a chit found in her purse and informed her father Netai Ghosh, a bank officer.

 I could not believe that my only daughter could end her life. I had fixed her marriage in August with a youth from Calcutta, Ghosh said.

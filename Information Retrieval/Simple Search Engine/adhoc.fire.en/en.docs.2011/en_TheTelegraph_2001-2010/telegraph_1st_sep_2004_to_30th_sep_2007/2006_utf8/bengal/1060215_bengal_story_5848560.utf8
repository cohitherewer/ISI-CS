 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, Feb. 14: Family members of former high court judge Bhagabati Prosad Banerjee today refused to accept a cheque for Rs 30.5 lakh from the government against his Salt Lake house, which was auctioned on February 4.

 Directed by the Supreme Court, the urban development department had auctioned the two-storey house. Businessman Pradip Murarka bought it for Rs 51 lakh ? Rs 20.5 lakh for the 4-cottah plot and Rs 30.5 lakh for the building. The court had said Banerjee should only get the price of the building and vacate it within a month of receiving the money. This morning, two government officials went to his house with the cheque, but Banerjee was away in Delhi. The former judges relatives called the auction a farce. He has urged the court to cancel the auction.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 EC to post extra officer at all booths

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Calcutta, March 18: The Election Commission 

(EC) has decided to appoint an additional polling officer for all booths in the 

state to prevent false voters from jamming them.

 This will mean an additional requirement of half-a-lakh poll personnel for the 50,000 booths to be set up across Bengal.

 The usual practice has been to assign four polling personnel for every booth, one among them being a presiding officer. The other three are required for election-related work inside the booth.

 However, this time the poll panel has decided to have an additional polling officer outside each booth to check whether people waiting in queues outside polling stations have electronic photo-identity cards (EPIC). This is aimed at checking if the people outside the booth are waiting with the intention to vote.

 According to existing instructions of the EC, production of EPIC is a must for being allowed to vote.

 Sources said the poll panel had received reports that political parties are in the habit of shepherding activists to poll booths even if they are not bona fide voters. 

 This leads to genuine voters turning away from polling stations because of the inordinate delay in casting their votes, thus helping the ruling party or the Opposition.

 Bengals chief electoral officer (CEO) Debashis Sen said today that voters who have been photographed for the voter identity cards would have to produce their EPIC to cast their votes.

 A month-long photo session is under way till April 6 and state election authorities said all voters would be covered under this drive.

 Every day, more than a lakh voters are being photographed. The question of not being able to produce EPIC is not realistic. The EC has asked for production of EPIC for voting, said the CEO.

 State CPM secretary Anil Biswas also said party workers had been told to ensure that every new voter is photographed. In this election, EPIC has been made compulsory. So, our workers must persuade new voters to get their photo identity cards.

 Sen and joint CEO Nikhil Sahana today held a video conference with 226 returning officers (ROs) of the state and instructed them on the dos and donts on filing and scrutiny of nomination papers. Some ROs raised questions on the scrutiny of nominations Were doing our best to issue clarifications, Sen said after the conference.

 The EC has also sent directives on setting up of voting compartments as it wants to strictly maintain secrecy of votes.

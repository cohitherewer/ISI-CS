The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 BRIEFS

 Ilambazar: Chun Palashi is a Birbhum village that has always voted Congress in panchayat polls. 

 No road has been built or repaired there for decades. Congress leaders say it is because the village did not vote Left. Their candidate for Dubrajpur, Vivekananda Sau, is campaigning on ox carts. What better way to highlight the condition of roads, he said.

Calcutta: Men on stilts may be chanting his name and wearing 

it on their Tees, but Subhas Chakraborty is worried because of a Subhas Chakraborty. 

A namesake of the transport minister is also contesting from Belgachhia (East)

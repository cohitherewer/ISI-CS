 CPM partners want Singur bar off 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Dec. 19: The CPMs allies want the government to take tension-reducing steps, including lifting prohibitory orders under section 144 in Singur and providing alternative plots to farmers whose land was acquired without consent. 

 Left Front chairman and CPM state secretary Biman Bose has advanced to Wednesday a meeting that was scheduled for Friday, in view of the Trinamul-sponsored bandh from Thursday. 

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and Jyoti Basu will be attending it.

 The CPM will hold discussions with the RSP, CPI and Forward Bloc, allies who are critical of the acquisition of farmland in Singur and elsewhere. 

 Separate talks with the RSP will be held on Wednesday morning. This will be followed by discussions with the CPI and the Bloc on the two bandh days.

 The government should lift section 144 and withdraw cases against Trinamul-led agitators to ease political tension, Bloc veteran Asoke Ghosh said today. 

 In a letter to Bose, Ghosh suggested that Tata Motors be persuaded to issue equity shares to the Singur landlosers. 

 The government had stopped Trinamul chief Mamata Banerjee, Medha Patkar and other political leaders from visiting Singur for fear their presence could spark trouble and hinder fencing of the acquired land.

 The ban on political activities in Singur only helped the Opposition to fan the agitation in the city and get media mileage. This is harming the states interest. We will request the chief minister to work out measures to end the impasse, a senior RSP leader said. 

 Bose also indicated that he was not averse to the offer of alternative land to farmers unwilling to give up their plots in Singur. 

 If Mamata really proposes alternative land for unwilling farmers, let her place the proposal officially, end her fast and call off the bandh. She should talk to the chief minister on her new proposal.

 However, CPM state secretariat member Benoy Konar said: I have no knowledge of such a proposal from our side. If conceded, it would mean the willing farmers committed a mistake by selling their land.

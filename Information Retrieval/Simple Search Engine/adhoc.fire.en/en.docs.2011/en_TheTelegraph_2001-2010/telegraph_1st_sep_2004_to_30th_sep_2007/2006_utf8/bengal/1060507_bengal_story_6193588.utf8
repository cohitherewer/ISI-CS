The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 BRIEFS

 Malda: On the last day of campaigning for election 2006, the chief minister sought votes here saying the Left would never neglect Barkatsahebs Malda. 

 The Congress leader, much respected here, has been on the lips of every party since his death in mid-April.

Balurghat: CRPF jawans deployed here have been accused of 

making phone calls and taking shop items without paying for them. We are 

here to work for you, has been their riposte. Sudeb Roy filed an FIR at 

Balurghat police station after he was allegedly pulled down from his cycle and 

beaten up for no apparent fault.

 Calcutta: Subhashish Sinha, the presiding officer of a Burrabazar booth, has been showcaused. He didnt offer a Braille ballot to the lone visually-challenged voter who went there on April 27. As an experiment, the poll panel had installed Braille voting machines in all booths in Burra-bazar and Bowbazar but none of them was used.

 EC seal: The panel has said an observers signature would be mandatory before the result for any seat is declared. 

Dinhata: Police wielded the baton on Saturday as pro-Greater 

Cooch Behar activists tried to hold a rally calling for a vote boycott.

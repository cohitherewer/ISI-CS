The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 At fathers pyre, a stab of pain

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Sujay Datta

 Calcutta, June 3: As they mourned for Swaraj Datta, the family of the Srinagar grenade blasts lone casualty received another shock last night: that of a bungled operation on his son Sujays leg.

 Hours after he lit his fathers pyre at Keoratala crematorium last night, Sujay Datta was rushed to a private hospital in excruciating pain. On Saturday, the 34-year-old chartered accountant had another surgery to remove residual splinters from his left leg.

 The bank employee has been told he would not be able to step out before a week and must be confined to his wheelchair for now.

 Last night, he was not even in a state to sit on the wheelchair. At the crematorium, we carried him to the pyre on a stretcher and rushed him out as soon as the rites were over, said cousin Pallab Ghosh.

 After his plaster was cut open at the hospital, the doctors found that the splinter injuries hadnt been properly treated. The operation should set things right but its a blow to Sujay. He had been desperate to return to normal life.

 But its Sujays wife Sumona that the Dattas of Kasba are more worried about. The May 31 attack had left both her legs so badly damaged that the doctors at Srinagars SIKMS Hospital didnt let her fly home. But she refused to stay on in Srinagar any longer.

 Sumona was flown back to the city and was admitted to a private hospital at 11.15 tonight. Hospital sources said her legs were badly hurt but she was very much conscious and was responding well to treatment. 

 Several other injured tourists have been admitted to hospitals in Calcutta. At SSKM, six of them are under the treatment of plastic surgeon Arindam Sarkar. They were taken to the operation theatre and had their wounds cleaned this morning.

 One of them, four-year-old Tamali Naskar, would need reconstructive surgery on her hand and leg. Tamali has fractured her right palm and also has serious wounds in her leg, said medical superintendent Dr Shatanu Tripathi. 

 Her mother Gayatri, too, requires major surgery.

 Most of the other patients have only suffered damage to the soft tissue and not their bones.

 At first, we thought they would require orthopaedic treatment but investigations have revealed they need treatment by a plastic surgeon, Tripathi said. All the patients are stable.

 So are the three victims at Medical College Hospital, officials said. Tapan Ghosh, lying in a private hospital with a splinter in his head, too, is recovering, his family said.

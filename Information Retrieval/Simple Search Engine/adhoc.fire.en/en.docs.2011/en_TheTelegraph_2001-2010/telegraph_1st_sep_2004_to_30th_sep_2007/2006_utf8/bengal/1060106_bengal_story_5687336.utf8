 Twin births with help from quack

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 5: A 33-year-old woman gave birth to twin daughters on a railway platform last night after a doctor at the Canning subdivisional hospital asked her to be shifted to a city hospital as he suspected the babies in the womb were dead.

 Kanchan Mondal of Koragachhi village in South 24-Parganas, 60 km from Calcutta, was admitted to hospital yesterday afternoon. The doctor said she had developed complications and he suspected the baby was dead. He asked me to shift her to a city hospital, said Kanchans husband Satya.

 Satya, a rickshaw-puller, and Kanchan left for Canning station to take a train to Sealdah but failed to reach on time. When Kanchan went into labour at the station, some people advised Satya to take Kanchan to a local quack, Kumud Ranjan Gharami.

 This man (Satya) came with some local residents and told me what had happened. Initially, I hesitated. But they urged me to have a look, Gharami said. I helped her (Kanchan) deliver two healthy babies. By 10 pm, the woman left with her husband and the babies.

 District chief medical officer of health Pradip Chandra Mondal has sought a report from the Canning hospital authorities on the incident.

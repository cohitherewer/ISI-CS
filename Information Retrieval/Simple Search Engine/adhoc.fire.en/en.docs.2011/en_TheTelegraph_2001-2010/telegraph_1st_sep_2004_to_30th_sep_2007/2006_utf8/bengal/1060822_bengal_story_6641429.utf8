 Women vs women

 Calcutta, Aug. 21: The CPM is ready to un- leash its women on Mamata Banerjee.

 To counter the womens brigade floated by the Trinamul Congress chief last month to oppose land acquisition at Singur, the CPM has decided to employ the Ganatantrik Mahila Samiti.

 The CPM womens wing would campaign among farmers wives to convince them about how Tata Motors car factory would benefit the region. They will also tell the villagers why there is no alternative to the governments push for industrialisation.

 The samiti will hold its first rally in the heart of Singur, about 45 km from Calcutta, on August 29. The Tatas want around 1,000 acres there for the project.

 Our main purpose is to motivate women members of the peasants families, who have become a stumbling block in the land acquisition drive. Mamata has taken a considerable number of women for a ride by launching a false campaign about the proposed factory, said Shaymali Gupta, the state president of the samiti.

 The Trinamul leader had organised a procession of village women armed with brooms and utensils last month, Gupta said. But after August 29, you will see more women rallying behind us in support of the Tata project.

 The CPM campaigners have been told to visit every Singur household. We will have to drive home the point that thousands will get jobs on the land where a handful of people work now, Gupta added. 

 Acquisition in court

 A petition on behalf of the farmers opposing the acquisition was filed in Calcutta High Court today. 

 The petitioners sought an order restraining the state from acquiring their plots before announcing the compensation. The matter will come up for hearing in a couple of days, said Arunava Ghosh, the advocate for the farmers.

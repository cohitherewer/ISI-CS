The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, Aug. 23: The high court today granted bail to former Forward Bloc MP Bir Singh Mahato, who was sentenced to 10 years rigorous imprisonment in May for an alleged gang rape in November 1982. 

 The court called the trial courts decision faulty because the Purulia leader was tried under the gang rape act, which came into effect a year after the incident.

 Calcutta: The cabinet will consider filling up over 1,000 posts in lower courts at its meeting on Wednesday. Vacancies in groups B, C and D have often been held responsible for the slow disposal of cases.

 The cabinet is likely to green-light Hindustan Motors proposal to sell off a portion of its over 700-acre premises in Ut- tarpara. The company, which will develop the plot for real estate, has pledged to plough back Rs 100 crore into the unit.

 Calcutta: West Midnapore district magistrate D. Nariala will be the state project director of the district primary education programme. Cooch Behar DM R.I. Singh will replace him.

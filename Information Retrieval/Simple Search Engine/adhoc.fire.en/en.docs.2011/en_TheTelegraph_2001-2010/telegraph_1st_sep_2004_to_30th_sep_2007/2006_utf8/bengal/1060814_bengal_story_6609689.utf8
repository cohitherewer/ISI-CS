 Arrest in Puri beach murder

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Aug. 13: The CID has arrested a 28-year-old contract killer in connection with the murder of Congress councillor Tapas Mitra. 

 The 40-year-old councillor of the Bongaon municipality in North 24-Parganas was shot dead on Puri beach on June 22. 

 Police said Samir Mondal alias Munna was a key member of the gang that gunned down Mitra just as he had taken a bite of a dosa at a snack stall. 

 Munna was arrested from a hideout in Nadias Taherpur. 

 Two persons who had reportedly hired him for the murder are on the run. 

 Munna has several murder cases against him. He would work for a hefty down payment and even in this case, it appears he had received a good sum. But it is too early to comment as we need time to interrogate him further, particularly on the whereabouts of the two who had hired him, said Rajeev Kumar, DIG (operations). 

 Mitra had escaped two attempts on his life in the last year before the night of June 22.

 Preliminary investigations suggest two local toughs from Bongaon, Bapi and Swapan, had hired Munna to kill the councillor.

 The CID said one of the reasons behind the murder could be that Mitras men had recently bagged a contract to fell about 1,000 trees for widening a road in Bongaon. Bapi and Swapan, too, were eyeing the contract worth several lakhs of rupees, it added.

 A team from Orissa police arrived here to take the contract killer into custody. 

 Orissa police will now look into the case because the murder took place in Puri, said an officer of the CIDs special operations group.

 Singur, Dec. 29: Police today said a property dispute in the family had led to the deaths of Tinkari and Maya Dey and that the killers were close acquaintances of the family.

 There are reasons to believe that the Deys knew those who turned up at their house on Wednesday night and spent some time with them, said Arun Kumar Gupta, the western range inspector-general. 

 We have found some definite leads and a breakthrough should come very soon. Its too early to say anything definitively, but it appears that a dispute over property was at the root of the murder, he added.

 Tinkari, in his mid-50s, and his 45-year-old wife were found dead in a room on the ground floor of their two-storey house in Gopalnagar (East) yesterday morning with a single wire around their necks. 

 The deaths came close on the heels of the murder of teenager Tapasi Malik, who was strangled and burnt to death in a field near her home at Bajemelia, on land acquired for the Tata Motors project. 

 Tapasi was a leader of anti-land acquisition protests in parts of Singur.

 Tinkari was one of the first to hand over his land to the government for the small-car project. 

 The post-mortem report suggests that the killers had strangled the couple to death using their hands.

 An officer said the murder could be over a four-cottah plot that Tinkari had sold to someone distantly related to him. The police are probing whether he had handed over the papers for the plot to the person to whom it was sold. 

 It could be that Tinkari had possibly passed the land off as his own and collected compensation from the state government in exchange of it. This could have left the buyer enraged as he should have got the compensation and not Tinkari, said an officer of the Singur police station.

 Tinkari had got over Rs 4 lakh from the government for the less-than-half-an-acre land and opened a fixed-deposit account at the local co-operative bank. 

 For the moment, though, officers of the criminal investigation department who turned up today to interview some of the Deys relatives, are zooming on how the murder was carried out. 

 Some puffed rice was strewn on the floor, which suggests that the Deys possibly had snacks with the assassins. There was also a bucket inside the room. We would like to take a look at all those with whom Tinkari would usually have his drink in the evenings, said a senior CID officer. 

 The Deys sons Uttam, Gautam and Bidhan, all goldsmiths in Delhi arrived here late last night and performed their last rites.

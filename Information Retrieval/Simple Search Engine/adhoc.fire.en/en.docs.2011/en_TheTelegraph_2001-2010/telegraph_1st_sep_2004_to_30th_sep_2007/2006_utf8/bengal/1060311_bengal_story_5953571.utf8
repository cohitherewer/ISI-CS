The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Delhi officer on poll mission

 Calcutta, March 10: Deputy election commissioner R. Balakrishnan is coming here to discuss poll preparations with the district magistrates on Monday.

 The trip follows yesterdays poll panel meeting with the 20 observers who had toured the state earlier this month to look into flaws in the final electoral rolls and get an update on law and order. Government sources said the commission had expressed unhappiness at reports of tardy progress in deletion of bogus voters names and execution of non-bailable warrants.

 Balakrishnan will discuss the weeding out of dead and shifted voters, polling arrangements, deployment of central forces and preparation of photo-identity cards for new voters.

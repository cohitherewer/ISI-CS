The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Ladies set for border debut

 OUR BUREAU

 Krishnagar/Behrampore, Sept. 17: The Border Security Force will for the first time deploy women near the Bangladesh border. 

 The BSF brass had sent a proposal to the Centre two months ago seeking the nod to recruit women constables in view of the growing number of women involved in border crimes, particularly smuggling and girl-running.

 The force, which mans the 4,100-km boundary, now has women working only in clerical posts. 

 The Centre has agreed to our proposal in principle. We expect a formal approval any day, said Damodar Sarengi, the additional director-general of the BSF (eastern region).

 Recruitment will start once the formal nod comes.

 The situation along the Bangladesh border is changing and so creation of a womens force was necessary, Sarengi said. 

 Somesh Goyal, the inspector-general of the BSFs south Bengal frontier, said jawans are charged with rape whenever they catch women smugglers. Our jawans are also often accused of excesses when they catch women or boys involved in smuggling across the border. If the jawans are always tense while dealing with women, how will they work? he asked. 

 According to BSF statistics, at least 10 jawans have been booked in the state over the past two years on charges of molesting women and beating up boys. 

 Officials said in most of these cases, the jawans were only performing their duties and were falsely implicated. 

 The women are engaged in sugar and medicine smuggling and children are used for narcotics, said Goyal. 

 The force had earlier asked local police to provide some women constables to assist its jawans. But they refused. So, we had proposed to the BSF director-general to at least provide some women constables on deputation from other forces like the Central Reserve Police Force, the IG said. 

 Separate houses would be constructed for the new women recruits in every battalion. Goyal said: The women will not be sent to border outposts. They will be called from the nearest battalion whenever required.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Ganga clean-up

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 18: The cleansing of the Ganga is finally on course. 

 A high court-appointed committee on the flowing sewage that the river has become prodded the West Bengal Pollution Control Board to act.

 We have asked the board to call all 42 riverbank municipalities tomorrow to discuss the issue, said environment secretary M.L. Meena, the chairman of the committee.

 The panel has also suggested that the board seek action plans from the Calcutta and Howrah civic bodies regarding the Tolly Nullah and Nazirgunge outfalls, which still discharge untreated sewage into the river. Bhadreswar municipality in Hooghly will be directed to clear encroachments on the riverbank. 

 We have received the recommendations and action will be taken soon, said Biswajit Mukherjee, senior law officer of the pollution board and member convener of the high court panel.

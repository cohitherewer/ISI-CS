 Scent of feud in murder

Singur, Dec. 22: Sleuths probing the murder of Tapasi Malik are now looking into whether a family dispute led to the ghastly killing. 

 Preliminary investigations have apparently turned the needle towards such a dispute and equations within the Malik family are being examined. 

 Two CID officers spent several hours at Gopalnagar village today. They spoke to Tap- asis father Monoranjan and her brothers. We are verifying every possible aspect. Officers are visiting the area regularly, said D.P. Tarenia, CID inspector-general (II).

 According to officers working on the case, the Monday murder had no link with the anti-land acquisition protests in Singur. It appears to be a fallout of either a personal grudge or a family dispute, said an officer. We are collecting details of Tapasis relatives.

 Monoranjan, who sat in the courtyard in front of his small hut and answered polices queries, later said: They asked me about my family property and relatives. I had to give a blow-by-blow account of the fateful day again, describing how I ran to the pit and saw my daughter in flames.

 The 18-year-old was throttled, dumped into a pit and set on fire while she was still alive. The event assumed a political colour initially as the girl had led some anti-acquisition protests in the area.

 After examining the nature of the crime, the sleuths are sure that the killers were known to Tapasi. They knew when she usually came out of her house to relieve herself every morning, an officer said. 

 Unlike other days, Tapasi had left home without cousin Aparna Dhara on Monday. So, the police suspect that the killers had been waiting for her.

 Tapasi used to sleep with Aparna and they used to leave the house together for 10-15 minutes. On Monday, when Tapasi did not return home after 30 minutes, Aparna called her mother, the officer said. 

 The killers were most probably from the locality. The officer said: They knew about the the pit in which Tapasi was dumped and set on fire.

 It had been dug to cook food during the harvest festival.

 Some students of Jawahar-lal Nehru University, Jadavpur University and Presidency College spent the day in the villages of Beraberi, Khasherbheri and Bajemelia. They tried to exhort villagers into a bigger movement.

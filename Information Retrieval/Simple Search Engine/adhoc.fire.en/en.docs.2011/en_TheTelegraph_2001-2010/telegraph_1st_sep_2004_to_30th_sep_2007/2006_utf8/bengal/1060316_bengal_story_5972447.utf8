The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Wedding bar pulled down

 - Hc raps state for girl plight; jjjjj amendment

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 15: The high court today asked a trial court to free a rape victim, who has been stuck in a home for destitutes for the past 16 years and cannot even get married because an appeal by the alleged rapist is pending.

 It is ridiculous and embarrassing for the administration of justice that a victim woman could not be released for so many years because the appeal moved by an accused was lying pending with this court, Justice S.P. Talukdar said in his order, directing the chief judicial magistrate of Bankura to allow the woman to be freed immediately against a personal bond of Rs 200.

 In 1990, the victim, then six, was kidnapped and raped by a local youth at Bishinda in Bankura. The police found the child and arrested the alleged rapist. 

 When the police produced the victim before the chief judicial magistrate, he sent her to Ananda Math, a home for destitute women in Purulia, and started the trial of the accused.

 In 1994, the judge convicted the accused of rape and sentenced him to life. But he filed an appeal before the high court and also obtained bail from it. 

 So while he walked free, the victim was stuck at the home as long as the appeal was pending.

 The child was brought up at the home and is now 22. According to the rules, she should have left two years ago, because women over 20 are not allowed to stay at the home. 

 Its management and the Purulia administration have even found her a match, but the marriage has to wait till she is free.

 The wedding cannot take place until the girl is released from the home, said Pradip Roy, appearing for the home. 

 He said his client had appealed to the Bankura chief judicial magistrate to allow the home to let her go. But the CJM did not grant the prayer on the ground that the appeal moved by the accused youth was pending before the high court. 

 What a tragedy my Lord. While the accused is leading a free life, the victim is rotting behind the bars.

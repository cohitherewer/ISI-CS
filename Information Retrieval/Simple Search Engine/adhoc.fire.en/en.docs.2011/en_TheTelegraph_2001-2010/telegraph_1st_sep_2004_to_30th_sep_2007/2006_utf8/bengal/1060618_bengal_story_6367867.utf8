 Brainstorming to beat Maoists

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 17: The Maoists are suspected to have made their first strike since the Assembly elections, prompting Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to convene a meeting with top police officials this morning.

 The chief minister reviewed the situation in rebel-hit districts, three days after Maoists are believed to have gunned down a CPM leader from Belpahari in West Midnapore. Rabi Shankar Das was killed a few metres from the local police station.

 Bhattacharjee said there should be foolproof security and extensive patrolling in Purulia, Bankura and West Midnapore.

 Director-general of police S.C. Avasthy, home secretary Prasad Ranjan Roy, zonal inspector-general Banibrata Basu, DIG (Midnapore) N. Ramesh Babu, IG (law and order) Raj Kanojia and the police chiefs of the three districts attended the meeting. 

 We had a detailed discussion on the steps to be taken at police stations in these districts. We will seek 12 companies of central forces for increased vigilance, Kanojia said.

 Bhattacharjee later held another meeting with the DGP and the three superintendents of police.

 The government has decided to set up nine more police stations. Of these, five would come up in West Midnapore, two in Purulia and two in Bankura. West Midnapore now has 25 police stations, while Bankura has 22 and Purulia 20.

 The chief minister had recently admitted that there is a shortage of personnel at the police stations as the state lacks funds for recruitment. 

 You will cry foul if we increase the police budget, Bhattacharjee had told leaders of the Opposition parties in the Assembly on Thursday . 

 The chief minister today stressed that the police would have to win the confidence of the people. Only then can they alienate the insurgents from the local population, said Kanojia.

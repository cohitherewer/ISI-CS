 600 farmers at DMs door

 OUR BUREAU 

 Chinsurah/Calcutta, July 13: Around 600 farmers from Singur today marched to the district magistrates office and submitted in writing that they would not sell their lands to make way for industry.

 The farmers belonging to the Krishi Jomi Bachao Committee also submitted documents related to their lands.

 Tata Motors requires 1,000 acres in Singur to set up a small-car manufacturing unit. The farmers who turned up at the DMs office today own about 500 acres.

 These farmers came spontaneously to register their protest and more will arrive in the coming days, said Becharam Manna, the convener of the committee.

 District officers said that as no official notification has yet been issued on the land acquisition, todays protest was not legally valid. However, we received the documents from the farmers as a public grievance, said additional district magistrate Liakat Ali.

 Manna said the committee would hold a convention in Chinsurah on Monday.

 The CPM, on the other hand, worked in full swing to convince farmers to part with their land. 

 Ranjit Mondal, a member of the partys core committee set up in Singur to facilitate the acquisition of land, said: Farmers are approaching us on their own to give their land. Already, 483 farmers have offered 412 acres.

 In Calcutta, CPI MP Probodh Panda met industry minister Nirupam Sen, land and land reforms minister Abdur Rezzak Molla and food minister Naren De at Writers Buildings and demanded a revision of the governments compensation package for displaced farmers.

 The government has finalised a package offering 152 per cent of the value of land. The 152 per cent cannot be called a humanitarian package. The government should consider that the value of land would have gone up by 10 per cent annually and that a farmers income would have also increased by 10 per cent over the next 20 years had the land remained with him. These components should be added to the package, Panda said.

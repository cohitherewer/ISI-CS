 Calcutta, May 17: Writers Buildings will roll out a 50-metre-long red carpet to usher in Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees new cabinet tomorrow. 

 The states seat of power ? it is more than 150 years old ? wore a festive look this evening as it dressed up for the big day. 

 Red shamianas flanked the central gate and, in a trial run of tomorrows ceremony, the red carpet was laid. Red was also the colour of flowers ? in over 200 pots ? lining the path and fairy lights adorning the main gate and the building.

 Till late this evening, painters were at work trying to conceal the patches where the paint had peeled off. 

 Were also changing the flooring in the corridors leading from the central gate as well as gate numbers 1 and 6. Artificial flooring will be laid tonight no matter how long it takes, a PWD official said.

 The Co-ordination Committee of State Government Employees and Associations will hold an hour-long felicitation ceremony for the Left Front cabinet ? which returns to Writers for the seventh time ? after it makes its way from the swearing-in at Raj Bhavan.

 As the chief minister and his cabinet colleagues walk down the red carpet, the women members of the co-ordination committee will shower petals on them.

 When Bhattacharjee steps on the podium, he will be presented a bouquet. The committee leaders will then release seven balloons ? proclaiming Welcome Seventh Left Front Government ? into the sky.

 The Writers Buildings Employees Cooperative Canteen has lined up a lunch for over 500 people. The spread ? bhat, daal, aloo bhaja, aloo potoler dalna, papad and chutney ? will be served at only Rs 6 a plate.

 Jyoti Prasad Basu, the general secretary of the co-ordination committee, will welcome the cabinet after which the chief minister will address the gathering.

 The government has won by a large margin this time. We will tell the new government that the people of Bengal as well as the workers have great expectations from it, Basu said.

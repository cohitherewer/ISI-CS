 Room for pros in XLRI 

 Calcutta, Oct. 28: With demand for part-time MBA courses shooting up, XLRI Jamshedpur is ready to expand the reach of its executive training programmes. 

 We have a tie-up with Al Abbas Institute of Technology in Dubai, where we have been running a three-year part-time executive postgraduate programme since 2000. The success of the programme has prompted us to offer similar courses in other countries, said Father N. Casimir Raj, director, XLRI.

 This year, the institute has launched a training programme in Singapore for working professionals. 

 In India, XLRI is branching out to Hyderabad, where it is planning to launch all its courses by 2008.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Plan to hire 2000 college teachers

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Behrampore, Feb. 8: State-aided undergraduate colleges will get relief from scarcity of teachers in the next two months with the recruitment of 2,000 new teachers, state higher education minister Satyasadhan Chakraborty said today.

 At a function to mark the inauguration of a new building at the Behrampore Government College of Engineering and Technology, 200 km from Calcutta, Chakraborty said the colleges will not have to depend on part-time teachers when vacancies are filled up by the state college service commission.

 We have created a few hundred new teaching posts for the states undergraduate colleges. The problem faced by the students because of scarcity of teachers will be mitigated once we start recruiting teachers to the new posts, the minister said.

 Several of the 340-odd state-aided colleges are reeling from severe scarcity of teachers.

 A recent survey carried out by the government revealed that the problem is more acute in courses in emerging-area subjects like biochemistry, molecular biology and computer science. 

 Many colleges do not have a single full-time teacher for these departments and have to depend entirely on the services of part-timers.

 We are trying to ensure that no college has to run a department without even a single full-time teacher, the minister said.

 The interviews and final selection of the candidates are likely to be completed in the next two months, he added.

 Chakraborty also promised to provide adequate help to the colleges so that they can have proper laboratory facilities, computers and books for libraries.

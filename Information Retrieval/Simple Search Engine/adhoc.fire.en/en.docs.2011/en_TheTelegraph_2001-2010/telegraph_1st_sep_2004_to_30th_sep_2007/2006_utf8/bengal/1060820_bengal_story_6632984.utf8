 Suspended school head stays put

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Aug. 19: A day after she was shown the door, headmistress Krishna Bhowmik was back in school, refusing to accept the suspension order.

 Bhowmik was yesterday told to leave Rajlakshmi Kanya Vidyapith in Nadias Haringhata, about 45 km from Calcutta, by the schools managing committee. 

 She had allegedly prevented Haripada Sil, president of the managing committee, and Sanjay Chatterjee, its secretary, from entering the school premises while classes were on in December last year. 

 The committee had first served a showcause on her in January but she did not reply.

 Bhowmik refused to take her suspension order, saying it was illegal. She urged students, their guardians and teachers to demonstrate outside the school in her support.

 A large number of students boycotted classes, some of them threatening to go on indefinite strike from Monday if the order was not withdrawn. Most of the schools 32 teachers joined them.

 I never received any showcause order from the school managing committee. They are asking me to go out of the school since I am a strict administrator, Bhowmik said.

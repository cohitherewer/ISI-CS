 Saugata thorn pulls out

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Sept. 2: Saugata Roy, the Trinamul Congress candidate for the Bongaon Assembly seat, today breathed a sigh of relief after party rebel Gopal Seth withdrew his nomination for the byelection slated for September 16.

 The bypoll was announced after the death of Gopals father Bhupen Seth, who had won the Bongaon seat in May.

 Trinamul chief Mamata Banerjee had initially planned to field Gopal but later changed her mind in favour of Roy, who lost to PWD minister Kshiti Goswami in south Calcuttas Dhakuria.

 Stung, Gopal filed his nomination as an Independent with backing from the BJPs state unit. The BJPs relations with Mamata have soured of late after she decided to support the Congress nominee for the Malda Lok Sabha bypoll.

 Its really a great relief for us. There would have been a division in the Trinamuls votes if Gopal was in the fray. Now a straight contest with the CPM nominee will help us win the bypoll, Mamata said this afternoon. 

 Roy said he had called on Gopal at his Bongaon residence to persuade him to stay away from the poll. Gopal has genuine grievances. Its good that he opted out to avert a split in the anti-Left vote bank. 

 According to Trinamul sources, Gopals move came after he extracted his pound of flesh he was appointed president of the Trinamuls North 24-Parganas unit. 

 The state Congress has decided to back Roy in Bongaon to reciprocate Mamatas gesture in Malda. It will also join the Trinamul in a daylong sit-in at Singur on September 10 to protest against the governments decision to acquire land for Tata Motors small-car unit.

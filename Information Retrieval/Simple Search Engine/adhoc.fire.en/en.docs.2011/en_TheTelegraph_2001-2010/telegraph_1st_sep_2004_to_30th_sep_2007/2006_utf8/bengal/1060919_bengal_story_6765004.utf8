 Purulia/Behrampore, Sept. 18: Ten Murshidabad policemen, including three officers, have been suspended for misbehaving with their Purulia colleagues yesterday during a delay in refuelling buses in which they were to return home after bypoll duty.

 Over 316 Murshidabad personnel were deployed in Purulia for Saturdays poll. After work, they went to the police lines for refuelling and encountered a long queue. But a group of 40 wanted their vehicle refuelled early.

 There were many policemen returning to their respective districts. Logbook entries had to be made and a lot of paperwork had to be done, an officer said.

 The Murshidabad men blamed transport officer Kailash Mahato for the delay and started abusing him. This enraged the Purulia constables on duty and resulted in a standoff. Deputy superintendent Tathagata Basu, who tried to pacify the visiting team, was also greeted with abuses. 

 Hearing that the DSP had been insulted, hundreds of armed policemen rushed out of the barracks crying revenge. Purulia additional superintendent Rajesh Yadav finally restrained his men.

 Murshidabad police chief Rahul Srivastava said his Purulia counterpart, Ashok Prasad, spoke to him before suspending the 10, who had been identified as the principal troublemakers.

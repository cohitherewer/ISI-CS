 Threats face EC thunder

 OUR BUREAU

 April 13: The Election Commission has taken serious note of the rising instances of intimidation of polling officers by political parties in the state, especially in Nadia.

 Deputy election commissioner R. Balakrishnan today said they would be dealt with strictly. He was in Krishnagar to attend a meeting with 19 Nadia observers, district magistrate Rajesh Pandey, superintendent of police R. Rajshekharan and chief electoral officer Debasish Sen.

 The DM and SP along with the observers have expressed concern over the rising instances of intimidation here. Weve asked them to take stern action and send us a report on this. The polling officers are shaken. Ive asked the DM to take measures in boosting their confidence, he said. 

 I havent received such large-scale complaints of intimidation of poll officers from anywhere else like I have in Nadia, he said. 

 At least 10 cases of officers being threatened by parties were reported in the last couple of months in the district.

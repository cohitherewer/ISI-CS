The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 BRIEFS

 Calcutta: After dead voters and false votes, mock poll votes have created furrows on Election Commission foreheads. 

In a Purulia booth, the presiding officer apparently forgot to delete 

from the electronic voting machine 21 votes polled during a mock exercise. The 

chief electoral officer had to write to the four district magistrates involved 

in Round II to make sure it did not happen again.

Durgapur: A Congress candidates launders are either 

happy with him or hopping mad. He has decided to wear the same pajama-panjabi 

everyday. Mrigen Pal, in the fray in Durgapur-II, believes they will bring him 

luck. On the first campaign day, I felt good and received a warm response, 

he said. So, the same dress is being washed, dried and ironed every night. 

 Calcutta: The poll panel has committed a wrong on the Bengal rights bosss family. The names of Shyamal Sens daughters-in-law have been struck off in the revised electoral rolls published recently. The family of the former Supreme Court judge and one-time acting Bengal governor is baffled as Debarati Sen, 32, and Ushri Sen, 30, had figured on the list published in February, but went missing on the one that came out on April 8. The residents of Cossipore hold voter I-cards and had exercised their franchise in the civic polls last year.

New Delhi: Bengal might be in the middle of Elections 2006 

but some are trapped in 2004. A Calcutta resident and two NGOs had moved the Supreme 

Court seeking the countermanding of elections to 35 Lok Sabha constituencies. 

The court refused to entertain the PIL.

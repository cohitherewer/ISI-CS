 Biswas still on support system

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 23: CPM state secretary Anil Biswass condition remained critical today.

 His neurological status has not shown any improvement and he still remains on ventilator support. Overall, his condition continues to be critical, the medical bulletin published today said.

 The CPM leader was admitted to Woodlands Medical Clinic on Saturday night after he suffered a stroke, leading to massive brain haemorrhage.

 A seven-member medical board is monitoring his health round the clock.

 Biswass blood pressure had started fluctuating since Tuesday and doctors had to use drugs to stabilise it. 

 The fluctuating blood pressure is a serious problem and drugs are being used to maintain stability, doctors treating Biswas said. The brain problem is affecting other parts of the body. Other factors are also affecting the blood pressure.

 The blood clot in the right hemisphere of Biswass brain still persists. Doctors said it would take some time to remove the clot with the help of medicines. 

 There is still a big clot and we are trying to dissolve it with drugs. At this moment, there is no plan for any further surgery, the doctors said.

 Biswas was briefly taken out of the ventilator on Monday as there was a marginal improvement in his condition and he could breathe for a brief period without the support system. However, now there is no question of taking him out of the ventilator, doctors said.

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee visited the hospital tonight to see Biswas. He spoke to the doctors and family members of the leader. 

 His wife Meera Bhattacharjee was also at the hospital for a long time today.

 CPM MP from Calcutta North-East Md Salim and mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharjee also visited the hospital.

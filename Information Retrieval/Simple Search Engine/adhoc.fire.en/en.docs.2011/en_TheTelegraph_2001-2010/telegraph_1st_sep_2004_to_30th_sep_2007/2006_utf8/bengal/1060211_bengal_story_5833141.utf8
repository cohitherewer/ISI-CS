The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Highway cave-in probe begins

 - Needle of suspicion points to engineers

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, Feb. 10: The National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) today started an inquiry into the subsidence of Bombay Road at Bally in Howrah on Wednesday night.

 The approach road to the bridge, which collapsed taking down two trucks with it, is part of the Golden Quadrilateral project and was opened to traffic less than a month ago. 

 The owners of the trucks today lodged a joint FIR against RBM-PATI, the Malaysian company that rebuilt the road.

 We are questioning officials of the company and trying to ascertain the cause of the collapse, said Kalyan Banerjee, the Howrah additional superintendent of police (town). 

 A visit to the site today revealed that the cracks on the road had widened.

 A team of engineers led by NHAI project director B.K. Majhi inspected the site this morning and collected samples of construction material for examination. 

 Theres been some gross neglect of duty and we are trying to find out who were responsible, an NHAI officer said.

 Experts said the cave-in occurred because of lapses during the rebuilding of the National Highway 6. 

 National highways are built by laying white sand, fly ash, a compound of lime and soil and a mixture of stone chips and cement in layers so that it becomes a raised embankment, which is held together by a concrete or brick wall.

 Once these layers are firmed together by a roller, a layer of bitumen and stone chips is laid on top. The entire process has to be done in controlled temperatures. 

 If the wall holding together the layers is not strong enough, there is every possibility of the road sliding in, said A.K. Pal, a former vice-chairman of the Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners. 

 NHAI officials said preliminary inquiries have revealed that the soil could not bear the load of the road. We are re-testing the soil and examining whether the load-bearing capacity of the soil was taken into account during construction. We will also see whether steps specified by the NHAI were followed when the road was being built, an official said. 

 Officials said the supervising engineers of the contractor as well as the NHAI cannot avoid their responsibility. 

 Representatives of the contractor, RBM-PATI, said it is not possible to say anything definite at this stage. We are now planning the restoration of the affected portion of the road, said Sandipan Deb Roy, a senior manager.

 The government today criticised the NHAI for ignoring it while implementing the Golden Quadrilateral. 

 It has not, at any point, consulted us on any matter in the past three years. We could have provided them information on soil and other condi- tions, said PWD minister Amar Chowdhury.

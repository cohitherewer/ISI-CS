The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Trespass glare

 Sept. 5: A central election observer for the Katwa bypoll was today accused of barging into a college and misbehaving with a teacher.

 Kalna College principal Santiranjan Chakraborty said Pradip Vyas entered the class when Arun Chowdhury was delivering a commerce lecture. When Chowdhury expressed displeasure over the manner in which his lecture was interrupted, Vyas told him that he had a right to enter any room, any time. On Teachers Day, it was insulting, Chakraborty said.

 Left Front chairman Biman Bose said in Calcutta he would lodge a complaint with the Election Commission against Vyas.

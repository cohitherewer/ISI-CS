 Murder row mars meet

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Barasat, Feb 9: Cracks in the ruling CPM came to the fore today when some party activists stopped a meeting midway, accusing leaders of soft-peddling the murder of DYFI activist Amulya Pal.

 Over 500 CPM activists had gathered to express condolences for Pal, who was shot dead at Pannajheel near here yesterday.

 Trouble broke out around 11.30 this morning when some CPM activists spotted Subol Poddar, an accused who had been handed over to police yesterday, on a street. 

 How could police release Poddar who was involved in Pals murder? Ananda Biswas, a local CPM member, asked those present at the condolence meet. 

 Biswas was joined by nearly 300 others, including some women, who went up to the podium and urged the leaders to stop the tamasha. 

 Daya kore natak bandha korun. Eta apnara shok sabha korchen na voter prachar korchhen? (Please stop the drama. Are you holding a condolence meeting or campaigning for the elections)? thundered Niranjan Mondal.

 After the meeting came to an abrupt end, the activists blocked the Barasat-Barrackpore road for about half-an-hour, demanding Poddars re-arrest. 

 The protesters budged only after some CPM leaders intervened. Police then put Poddar and his two associates behind bars again.

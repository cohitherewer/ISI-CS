The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Stamp paper fraud

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Aug. 19: A gang thriving on the high court premises has been passing off fake stamp papers as original for over a year, police said today. 

 A bulk of these papers was used for filing affidavits and registration of property. 

 The arrest of four people last night and one this morning, following a complaint lodged by the Calcutta High Court Lawyers Clerks Association, blew the lid off the racket.

 The association alleged that in three petitions filed yesterday, the Rs 20 stamp papers used were fake. 

 Those arrested allegedly posed as law clerks and passed off the fake papers to unsus-pecting litigants. Joydeb Karmakar, his wife Sushmita, Sukumar Patra and Shantanu Das were arrested yesterday. Mihir Roy was held today. 

 It appears that many people frequenting the high court move around posing as registered clerks and trap clients. We are trying to identify these people, said Premasish Maity, the general secretary of the clerks association.

 The fraud came to light when Patra went to the courts oath commissioner who verifies affidavits before cases are filed with three petitions yesterday. All three stamp papers, though of the same denomination, had different colours. 

 Patra was detained. He later revealed the names of his accomplices.

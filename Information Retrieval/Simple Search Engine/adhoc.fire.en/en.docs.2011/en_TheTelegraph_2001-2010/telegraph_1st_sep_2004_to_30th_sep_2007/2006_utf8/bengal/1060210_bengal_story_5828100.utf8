 Calcutta, Feb. 9: The CPM politburo meeting, which began here today, focused on working out an electoral strategy for the Bengal and Kerala Assembly elections. 

 Leaders took note of reports that there may be an unofficial alliance between the Congress and Trinamul Congress in Bengal and discussed whether it would be wise to establish ties with K. Karunakaran, who has broken away from the Congress, in Kerala.

 The first day of the meeting was primarily devoted to exploring ways of retaining Bengal and wresting Kerala from the Congress. 

 Senior politburo members are learnt to have been quite high on anti-Congress rhetoric, calling it a party of the bourgeoisie and landlords. 

 They harped on how the UPA, which the Left supports from outside, has diverted from the common minimum programme and its words should not be taken at face value.

 The CPM acknowledged reports that the Congress may try to pose a challenge by unofficially tying up with the Trinamul and, thus, the BJP. Jyoti Basu is learnt to have expressed such apprehensions.

 According to sources, much of todays session saw a debate on the strategy to be adopted for the Kerala elections, where the CPM is smelling victory. 

 The debate reportedly revolved around whether an alliance should be struck with Karunakaran. 

 The Kerala state CPM, led by P. Vijayan, is said to be in favour of a tie-up, but some politburo members made their resistance clear, the sources said. They suspect Karunakaran could switch loyalties in the event of a close finish. 

 The CPM is now faced with a tough decision ? whether it should treat both the Congress and Karunakaran as rivals in Kerala. 

 A senior CPM leader suggested that there could be adjustments with Karunakaran in some marginal seats, but Kerala veteran V.S. Achyutanandan is strongly opposed to an alliance and Karunakarans inclusion in the Left Democratic Front (LDF), a stand that has found favour with CPM general secretary Prakash Karat.

 Non-CPM constituents of the LDF are also against the tie-up. 

 Prakash Karat and some senior politburo members will visit Kerala to discuss the possibility of seat adjustments with the breakaway group of the Congress there, Basu said. 

 Deliberations on airport privatisation and referring Irans nuclear programme to the UN Security Council are expected to be taken up tomorrow, when the meeting comes to a close. 

 The CPM has decided to sound out parties like the National Conference, the Rashtriya Janata Dal and the Samajwadi Party to block cabinet decisions taken at the initiative of the Congress.

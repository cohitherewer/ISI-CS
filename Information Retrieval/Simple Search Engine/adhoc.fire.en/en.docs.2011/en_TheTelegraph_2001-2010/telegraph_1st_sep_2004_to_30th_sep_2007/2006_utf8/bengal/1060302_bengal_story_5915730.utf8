The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Split polls: CPM cries foul and counts pluses 

Advantage cadre also for Opposition 

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, March 1: On the face of it, and judging by its initial reaction, the CPM has every reason to be unhappy about the Election Commission?s decision to stagger the Assembly polls over five phases.

 But does it tell the full story? 

 After the commission?s announcement of election dates, CPM state secretary Anil Biswas said that the ?unprece- dented?? decision was ?absolutely unnecessary?. 

 His argument was if Tamil Nadu, with an equal number of seats, could have a one-day poll, why not Bengal, as has normally been the case.

 The obvious reason for the unhappiness is that in a five-phase poll, the commiss- ion can pool its resources to ensure that it is freer and fairer, prevent bogus voting and the unfair practices that the CPM is often accused of indulging in.

 But observers say that as true as that might be, there is a flip side over which the party is hardly going to town. 

 In a staggered election, they say, the party can bring in cadre from across the state to work in places where the polling is being held.

 ?Imagine a situation like the one in Salt Lake during the municipal polls last year,? said a party leader. ?The boys can be brought in from anywhere in the state in large numbers to work for party candidates, get their supporters out of their homes so that they can cast their votes and generally do whatever they can to make the party win.?

 That the Left Front might benefit from a staggered schedule has been a widely-held view. 

 But there is another story to be told. This one is about the Opposition and the glee the parties displayed at the commission?s announcement. This may well influence the outcome to an extent.

 Far weaker organisationally than the Left, the Trinamul Congress and the Congress have both welcomed the election calendar. 

 Their resources normally stretched, the parties would now be in a better shape in getting together supporters from all over Bengal to counter the might of the Left.

 For Trinamul and the Congress, the major problem has been their beleaguered presence in the districts and the fact that neither has ever been able to put up polling agents in all booths. 

 In the 2001 polls, which was a one-day affair, Trinamul had focused on the lower half of south Bengal, while the Congress did so in the north, leaving the Left to consolidate its position in the rest of the state.

 Political circles feel that with two phases of polls for the upper half of south Bengal and the entire north, the Congress may be at an advantage in both areas. 

 ?It would be easier for us to focus on Murshidabad and Birbhum for the fourth phase, while workers can be mobilised for the last phase in north Bengal,? state Congress working president Pradip Bhattacharya said.

 ?We can now deploy workers in polling booths,? said Trinamul?s Mukul Roy.

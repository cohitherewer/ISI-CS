 Code waiver for Nathu-la

 Gangtok, July 21: Traders heaved a sigh of relief today as they learnt that they can do business at Nathu-la without the Importer-Exporter Code, reports our correspondent.

 The waiver came in the form of a public notice (No. 35) from the directorate-general of foreign trade under the Union commerce ministry. 

 It allows import and ex-port from/to China of a single consignment of goods worth not more than Rs 25,000 through Gunji, Namgaya, Shipki-la and Nathu-la. 

 Symbolic barter through the silk route had started on Monday but the code had been a stumbling block for full-fledged trade.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Sonia visit

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Sonia

New Delhi, April 6: Sonia Gandhi is expected to address six meetings over two days in Bengal but will begin her campaign after the first phase of polling.

 Party sources said Sonia had delayed her visit as there are restrictions on holding of rallies and use of loudspeakers in the first phase because of examinations.

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh will spend a day and address two public meetings, one in the north and the other in the south. Sonias meetings will be held mostly in Malda, Murshidabad, North Dinajpur, Calcutta and the industrial belts.

 A suggestion by the state Congress that Sonia could address gatherings in large halls was turned down by the central leaders who felt it would detract from Sonias aura and charisma as a mass leader.

 Defence minister and state Congress chief Pranab Mukherjee and the general secretary in charge of Bengal, Margaret Alva, will hold fort during the first phase of polling.

 Sonia will be backed by younger leaders like Sandeep Dixit, Sachin Pilot and Randeep Surjewalla but Rahul Gandhi is unlikely to put in an appearance because he is managing his mothers by-election from Rae Bareli.

 Besides Mukherjee and Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, the other central ministers to come calling will be Kamal Nath and Santosh Mohan Deb. Among chief ministers, Sheila Dixit and Vilas Rao Deshmukh from Maharashtra have promised to campaign.

 Party functionaries Salman Khursheed and Mirza Ershad Beg will woo the Muslim voters while Jagmeet Singh Brar, a former Youth Congress president, will address meetings in Sikh-dominated areas.

 Former Orissa chief minister Hemanand Biswal will woo Oriya voters while central minister and JMM leader Shibu Soren will canvass in the tribal areas. The Congress will not have the benefit of Lalu Prasad Yadavs mobilisation skills because he has opted to align with the Left.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, March 17: Former mayor Subrata Mukherjee resigned as MLA today and filed his nomination as a Congress candidate for the March 28 Rajya Sabha polls.

 To win, though, he has to hope for cross- voting among Trinam- ul Congress MLAs. The Congress, which has 27 MLAs and the support of three Independents, is sure to get the votes of four dissident Trinamul members ? Paras Dutta, Nirbed Roy, Nayana Bandopadhyay and Shibdas Mukherjee. But Subrata Mukherjee needs 49 votes. Trinamuls Mukul Roy, who also filed his nomination, is set to win comfortably. The party has 50 legislators in the 294-member House. 

 New Delhi/Calcutta: The BJP leadership has announced the names of 14 candidates for the Assembly polls, taking care not to include any constituency for which Mamata Banerjee has already announced her nominee. Party general secretary Arun Jaitley will be here on Saturday to discuss the course of action with Mamata.

 Burdwan: The ceasework by junior doctors at the medical college and hospital here entered its second day with services virtually collapsing and most patients unable to consult doctors at the outpatient department. A skeletal team of about 35 heads of departments and senior doctors struggled to cope with 1,200 patients admitted at the hospital. Some 200 juniors resorted to the strike as some of them were beaten up after a patients death.

 Krishnagar: A Nadia fast-track court has sentenced Raju Das of Nakashipara ? 135 km from Calcutta ? to 10 years jail for having physical relations with a woman after promising marriage and then ditching her. She is now the mother of his child.

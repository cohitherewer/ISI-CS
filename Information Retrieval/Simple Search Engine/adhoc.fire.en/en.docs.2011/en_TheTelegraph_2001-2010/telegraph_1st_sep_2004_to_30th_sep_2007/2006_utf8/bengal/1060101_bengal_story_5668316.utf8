 Calcutta, Dec. 31: A Delhi police team picked up Narcotics Control Bureaus Calcutta superintendent last night on charges of duping a businessman. 

 Gora Chand Chatterjee, 53, was arrested from outside the CBI office in Salt Lake for carrying out a fake raid to intimidate a Delhi-based businessman. He was produced in court today and sent to Delhi on transit remand.

 Earlier, six others were held in connection with cheating Harbans Lal, a realtor. The police said he met Parminder Singh in Delhi, who claimed that he had access to precious gems. Singh told Lal that he could get him a rare Nagmani (amazing stone) that could make him rich overnight. 

 This will make you wealthy like me. I can get you one from Calcutta if you pay Rs 1.5 crore, Singh reportedly told Lal. On June 27, Singh accompanied Lal to Calcutta, where he also got a fake tester to check the stone. 

 The stone is genuine, Lal quoted the tester as saying. Convinced that it was real, he went back to Delhi and paid Rs 1.5 crore to Singh on August 20 at the latters South Patel Nagar house. 

 But Singh refused to give him any document of the transaction, Lal told the police. 

 The same night, Lal, Singh and the tester flew to Calcutta and checked into a hotel where he was supposed to get the stone. Two days later, Singh asked Lal and Kumar to go to another hotel on VIP Road, where the stone would be handed over to him. 

 Around 10 pm on August 22, Singh arrived with a packet that supposedly contained the Nagmani. 

 However, five armed men who identified themselves as officials of Delhi police crime branch ? but were actually Chatterjee and his team? stormed into the room and whisked Singh and Kumar away. They threatened him with dire consequences and left, Lal said in his complaint. 

 Delhi police arrested Singh along with narcotics bureau inspectors R. Vasist and Rajeshwar and three others. Vasist has confessed that Chatterjee had led the team that conducted the fake raid on the hotel room, said H.R. Mallik, a Delhi police inspector who was in the city today. 

 Chatterjee, however, denied the allegations. He told the court that he had got a concrete tip-off from Vasist about 4 kg of heroin and 5 kg of charas being traded in the room. 

 However, as nothing was found during the raid, no FIR was lodged, he told the court.

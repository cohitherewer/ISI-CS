The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 CM rings border alarm

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 12: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today expressed serious concern over rising infiltration along the Indo-Bangla border. 

 The chief minister was addressing a meeting with officers of the Border Security Force this afternoon. The BSF director-general, A.K. Mitra, echoed Bhattacharjee. 

 Of late, a lot of fundamentalist groups have become very active in Bangladesh. Also, a large number of Indian insurgent groups are getting shelter in Bangladesh. I share the chief ministers concern.

 In fact, the BSF has been giving BDR (Bangladesh Rifles) a list of insurgent camps in Bangladesh, asking them to take action, at every meeting over the past four years, he told reporters later.

 The BSF wants to get cracking on the proposal of introducing identity cards for people living within 8 km of the border, but its counterpart across the border, the BDR, is not as enthusiastic, Mitra said.

 According to the DG, the BSF had tried to expedite border fencing. In order to strengthen patrolling along the border, we are using hand-held thermal images, surveillance equipment and more vehicles. We also have to guard the fences or they will just remain physical structures, he said.

 Asked whether the Bangladeshi insurgents had any link with yesterdays bomb blasts in Mumbai, Mitra said it was too premature to make such an assumption. However, he added that a border alert has been sounded in the wake of the incident. Home secretary P.R. Roy held a meeting today with police officials to review security arrangements in the state. 

 On the BSFs deteriorating relations with people living along the border, the DG said it was an occupational hazard.

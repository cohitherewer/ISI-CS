 Cooch Behar, May 25: The secretary of the Greater Cooch Behar Peoples Association, Bangshibadan Barman, surrendered before the chief judicial magistrate today. 

 Accused in several cases, including the violence of September 20 last year that killed five persons, Bangshibadan was remanded in judicial custody till May 31. 

 As the judge read out the order, outside the courtroom Bangshibadans supporters claimed that he was innocent and had been framed. 

 In September, one police officer and two constables were lynched and two other persons killed during a hunger strike called by the association demanding a separate state of Greater Cooch Behar.

 Along with Bangshibadan, 46 people were accused of involvement in the violence. All of them ? except Bangshibadan, Punyeswar Roy and Jyotish Sarkar, who now heads the rival faction ? were arrested. They were charged under various sections of the Indian Penal Code for murder, attempt to murder, destruction of government property and unlawful assembly. 

 Although he was always available to the media, Bangshibadan proved to be elusive for the police. 

 Today, the association secretary, accompanied by other top leaders of his outfit such as Asutosh Barma, Bhabesh Barman and Phanindranath Barman, drove to court in a Maruti Omni around 10.40 am. 

 A crowd of 200 raised slogans in his support. They waited till late afternoon when the tearful leader boarded a police van and was taken to jail.

 Chief judicial magistrate Chapal Kumar Panda had in the morning ordered the police to send Bangshibadan to the court lock-up where he had to wait for three-and-a-half hours till his case came up for hearing after 2 pm.

 Before coming to court, Bangshibadan visited his lawyer, Shibendranath Roy, and told reporters that the struggle for statehood would continue even after he is put behind bars.

 I have been implicated in false cases. That I am innocent will be proven in court. I gave myself up to honour the courts directive that I be arrested. Phanindranath Barman will do the secretarys job while I am in jail, he said.

 We are the descendants of brave warriors and kings and our determination to get recognition as a C category state was further strengthened today, said Phanindranath.

 Security was stepped up throughout the district following Bangshibadans surrender.

 District police superintendent Jagmohan said the police were extra vigilant in order to arrest the last two persons named in the FIR ? Jyotish and Punyeshwar

 District CPM secretary Chandi Pal said Bangshibadans movement had been scuttled the moment the association voted for the Trinamul Congress in the Assembly polls. The people are not going to side with a violent and divisive movement. That is all I have to say, Pal said.

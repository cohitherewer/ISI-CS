The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Road to IIT set to become smoother

 SHALMOLI KUNDU

Calcutta, Aug. 9: The public works department 

has decided to pave and broaden the road linking IIT Kharagpur with National Highway 

60. 

 The new-look 6-km road would be of help to over 4,000 students and teachers of the IIT, who have to reach to the highway to catch a bus. 

 National highway 60 connects Mumbai and Calcutta.

 Now three metres wide, it would be four metres broader after the project is completed. The work should start before Puja.

 The main problem of the road is its width. No car can pass through it. People have to make a detour to reach the campus, said P.K. Agarwal, the principal secretary of the public works department.

 Its very unfortunate that the condition of the main approach road to one of the countrys premier institutions is pitiable. The road should be repaired on a war footing because it is the only link between the campus and the highway, a former student said.

 It would take over Rs 60 crore to make the road worthy to be used.

 A flyover across the Kharagpur railway tracks is also on the cards. 

 The public works department has got South Eastern Railways nod for 1.5-km flyover, which would be built at a cost of Rs 30 crore. 

 Agarwal said: Twenty-five per cent will be funded by the state government and the rest by the railways.

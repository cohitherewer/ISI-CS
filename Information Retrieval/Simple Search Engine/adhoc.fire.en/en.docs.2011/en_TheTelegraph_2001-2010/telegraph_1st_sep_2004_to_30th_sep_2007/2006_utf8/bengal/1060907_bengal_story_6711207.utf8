 Voter cards within a day

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Sept. 6: The Election Commission has ordered instant preparation and distribution of photo-identity cards for voters of the three Lok Sa-bha seats and one Assembly constituency where byelections would be held on September 16.

 Beginning today, voters will be photographed in all block development offices and municipalities in Purulia, Katwa, Malda and Bongaon till Sep- tember 11. The I-cards will be distributed within an hour of the photo session. 

 Chief electoral officer Debashis Sen said: The district administration will have a major role in ensuring smooth delivery of the cards.

 Of the 33 lakh voters in the three Lok Sabha constituencies, 1.8 lakh do not have the card. In Bongaon, about 10,000 voters in the electorate of 1.99 lakh do not have it. 

 As in the May Assembly polls, the commission has made the card a must for voting if a person has been issued one.

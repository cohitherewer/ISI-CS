The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Mamata calls for probe into CPM money

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, Jan. 9: Mamata Banerjee today said she would seek a poll panel probe into the size and source of funds the CPM used to organise yesterdays rally at Brigade Parade Grounds. 

 The Trinamul Congress chief also told a news conference that she would ask the Election Commission to seek the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee governments explanation on why it allowed CPM units to commandeer government and private buses to ferry party workers to and from Brigade. 

 It is clear that the government spent crores to enable the CPM to hold its picnic at Brigade, Mamata said. 

 The Election Commission (EC) must seek an explanation for this criminal misuse of public resources. 

 The CPM leadership chose to ignore Mamatas criticism, but hit back with a charge that the Opposition had so long levelled against the Left Front ? using bogus voters. 

 The CPM, too, will move the poll panel.

 Without naming any particular party, front chairman and CPM leader Biman Bose said: There are many bogus voters in the electoral rolls. This is ruining Bengals image. There are also fake voter and ration cards. We are not involved in this malpractice. The EC should take steps to find out who are behind this.

 After a meeting among the front partners, Bose added: We welcome the (election) observers. We also want them to find out bogus voters and comb them out like lice.

 After every election, the CPM, however, claimed that the polls were free and fair. This is perhaps the first time that the party has admitted the presence of bogus voters.

 The administration should have known that bogus voters, voters photo identity cards and ration cards exist. Let the Election Commission find out the forces behind the corruption, Bose said.

 Bose referred to police raids in Kalyani, Shantipur and Nabadwip (all in Nadia) last month in which fake voters I-cards and forged certificates for surrendered ration cards were found. The district administration admits the existence of 1,00,000 fake ration cards.

 Insiders said the CPM has already complained to the commission about fake voters in Nadia, Murshidabad and Malda. 

 It is interesting to note that both the Congress and Trinamul have a considerable presence in all three districts.

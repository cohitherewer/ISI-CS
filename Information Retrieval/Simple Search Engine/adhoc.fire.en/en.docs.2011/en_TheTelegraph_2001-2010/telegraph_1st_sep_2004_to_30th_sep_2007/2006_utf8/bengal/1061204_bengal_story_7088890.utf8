The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Govt plans agri-mart

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Dec. 3: About a third of vegetables and other perishable goods produced in the state are damaged every year because of the lack of a proper marketing infrastructure and so the government is planning to set up terminal markets across the state. 

 Once the terminal facilities are in place, farmers will not have to travel to faraway markets to sell their produce. The new hubs will be linked to a number of collection centres, which will be conveniently located at key production centres to allow easy access to farmers.

 The terminal markets will provide transport, cold storage and banking facilities to the farmers. There will also be a computerised auction system through which farmers can sell their produce to the highest bidder.

 Sources in the food and supplies department said most food and vegetables perish in the absence of adequate arrangements to preserve them. 

 The sorry state of the farm marketing network has become a matter of concern for us. Seeing the loss suffered every year because of damage of almost 30 per cent food and vegetables, we felt that terminal markets should be developed at the earliest. They will be professionally managed and will bring marketing services to farmers at their doorstep, said M.L. Meena, secretary, food and supplies.

 Mukesh Ambanis Reliance Industries, too, wants to build its own terminal market in Bengal. The terms and conditions of its agreement with the government are now being fine-tuned.

 The government markets will be developed with public-private partnership.

 The project has been approved as part of the national horticulture mission. The food and supplies department recently had a detailed discussion with the ministry of agriculture on it. 

 The government is looking for 100 acres in Barasat, North 24-Parganas, Siliguri in Darjeeling district and Dankuni in Hooghly for the terminal markets. 

 We have spotted some convenient locations for setting up the terminal markets. One of them is in Barasat, where we have already identified the land. As soon as the remaining two plots are confirmed, we will start the construction work, said Meena.

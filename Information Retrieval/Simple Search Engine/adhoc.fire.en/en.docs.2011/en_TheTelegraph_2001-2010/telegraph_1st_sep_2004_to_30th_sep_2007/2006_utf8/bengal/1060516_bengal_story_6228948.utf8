 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Midnapore, May 15: The CBI has arrested four policemen and a homeopath for their alleged involvement in the custody death of Soumendu Mondal, a grocer who was picked up on a theft charge in June, 2004.

 Assistant sub-inspector Tapas Sanyal and constables Srikanta Hota, Rabin Chanda and Hari Mahato of Kharagpur police station were arrested last night in Calcutta after the CBI called them for questioning. 

 Homeopath Rabindranath Nandi was arrested in Kharagpur, about 120 km from Calcutta, this morning.

 Calcutta High Court had asked the CBI to probe the charge against the policemen. 

 The bureau is supposed to submit its action taken report tomorrow, when the case will come up for hearing. 

 The policemen were accused of torturing Soumendu to death Nandi of giving a a false report on the injuries inflicted on him.

 The Midnapore chief judicial magistrate this afternoon remanded the quartet in four days CBI custody.

 CBI sources said the then Kharagpur sub-divisional police officer, Jayanta Chakraborty, and then Kharagpur police station officer-in-charge Apurba Nag might also be arrested.

 The high court ordered the CBI to investigate Soumendus death after his 70-year-old mo-ther, Biva Mondal, moved a writ petition in 2005. A fortnight ago, the division bench of Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurkar and Justice S. Sen directed the CBI to file a report stating what steps it had taken.

 According to the mothers petition, the police had raided her house at Debra, West Midnapore, on midnight of June 4, 2004, assaulted the family members and picked up 27-year-old son Soumendu.

 The next day, Biva went to Debra police station to enquire about the whereabouts of Soumendu. But the officers there told her that Soumendu was not there. 

 When Biva again went to the police station, the officer on duty told her that he had been taken to Kharagpur. 

 At Kharagpur police station, Soumendus mother was told that he was killed while trying to flee from a police jeep. We admitted him to a local hospital. After treatment, he was released. But on the midnight of June 5, he felt severe pain in his abdomen and died early on June 6, a policeman told the Mondals. 

 The mother alleged in the high court that her son was tortured inside Kharagpur police station and he succumbed to his injuries. 

 Her lawyer, Aloke Kumar Mitra, said she had tried to lodge a complaint against the police both at Debra and Kharagpur, but the officers there refused to accept it.

 Soumendus widow had moved a case in the Kharagpur chief judicial magistrates court, which directed the district police chief to arrest the accused. When no arrest was made, the high court asked the CBI to inquire into the case.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 No leave for poll officers

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Jan. 20: Election officials in the state would not be allowed to go on leave till revised electoral rolls are published on February 15.

 The states chief electoral officer, Debasish Sen, said he issued the directive today under instructions from the Election Commission. Such a step was necessary to draw up error-free electoral rolls on a war footing.

 Chief election commissioner B.B. Tandon had said yesterday that the Assembly elections, due this June, would be held on time. 

 Sen said nearly 1,000 government employees ? from district magistrates to block development officers ? will have to abide by the directive. They have been asked not to leave the areas of which they are in charge till mid-February.

 The electoral officer, who had a detailed discussion with the election commissioner on irregularities in the rolls, said the names of 300,000 bogus voters ? they are either dead or have shifted elsewhere ? will be scrapped by January 24. 

 The election office has so far received complaints about three lakh cases. 

 Asked why leave was being cancelled till February 15 when false voters will be weeded out much earlier, Sen said death registers with panchayat and municipal offices would be scrutinised to ensure that no dead or bogus voter finds a place on the revised rolls.

 He added: We can take suo motu action and delete names of bogus voters if we get complaints from political parties even after January 24.

 Mamata Banerjee urged the commission not to hold the elections till the names of all bogus voters were deleted.

 The election office, now housed at Writers Buildings, will start working from a new address ? 4 Camac Street ? from Wednesday. The poll panel had earlier asked Sen to look for space outside the secretariat.

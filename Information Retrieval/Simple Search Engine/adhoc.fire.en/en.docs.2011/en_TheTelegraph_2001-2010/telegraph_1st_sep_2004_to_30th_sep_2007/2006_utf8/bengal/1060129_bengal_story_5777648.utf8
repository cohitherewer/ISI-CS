The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Murder tale, blow by blow

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 28: The murder of realtor Pranab Deb, the brother-in-law of People for Democratic Socialism chief Samir Patitunda, was the brainchild of Rajesh Nayak, an extortionist from Baguiati, police said. 

 Pinaki Mitra, the contract killer arrested on Thursday, gave the police this information as he provided a blow-by-blow description of the fateful November night when Deb was killed.

 The police have been interrogating Pinaki for two days. The Lake Town-based contract killer also confessed to supervising the murder.

 Debs five associates in the iron-scrap business that he used to run and Rajeshs wife Meena, who was heading her husbands gang after his arrest, are already behind bars. 

 Pinaki narrated to us how Deb was murdered by his business associates and dumped in a heap of garbage, said Praveen Kumar, the superintendent of police, North 24-Parganas.

 Deb, the elder brother of former CPM legislator Anuradha Deb, went missing from a musical soiree in front of his Shyamnagar apartment on November 12. The next morning, his body, bearing multiple injury marks, was found in a dumping ground a kilometre from his residence.

 On the night of the murder, Pinaki, after receiving a message from Rajesh, asked the realtors associates-turned-rivals to call Deb. 

 As soon as the soiree ended, he came to the designated spot in Dum Dum. After exchanging a few words, Debs partners started beating him up as I watched from a corner. We carried him to a Maruti van when we became sure he was dead. Well after midnight, we drove to the dumping ground and left his body there, Pinaki told the police.

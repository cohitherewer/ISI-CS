 Rain shadow on first flush

 Darjeeling, Feb. 12: A dry winter spell ? the first time in a decade ? has pushed the Darjeeling tea industry almost to the brink of a crisis. 

 With the rain failing to make it on time, the Darjeeling tea that depends on nature for its muscatel flavour and exquisite bouquet is set to lose a substantial percentage of its first flush, which commands the highest price in the global market.

 Rajeshwar Singh, senior manager of Badamtam tea estate, said: There has been no rain since October end and if this continues, it could have a severe impact on the premium first flush. 

 Darjeeling produces 9,000 tonnes of tea annually. Of this, 80 per cent is exported. 

 The lack of rain could also have a severe impact on the quality of tea and the future of the industry, as this would mean that the overall production could nosedive this year. The first flush, which usually starts towards the end of February or early March, could also be delayed.

 After a relatively dry November, the crucial Christmas rain ? as the planters call it ? too skipped its date. If there is rain next week, we can at least salvage something, Singh said. 

 Darjeeling receives around 13 mm of rainfall in November, 6 in December and 10 mm in January. In February, it is usually 21 mm. There have also been instances when Darjeeling has received about 51mm in January, much to the planters delight. 

 Sandeep Mukherjee, secretary of the Darjeeling Tea Association, summed up the mood as gloomy. 

 The weathermans forecast has not helped much to lift the spirit either. Subir Sarkar, the man in charge of North Bengal Universitys weather station, confirmed that there hadnt been such a dry winter in the past decade. 

 Usually, western disturbances bring rain to north Bengal this time of the year. Right now, a western disturbance is developing in Pakistan and Afghanistan but there is no sign of rain, said Sarkar. 

 Meteorologists have not been able to understand this puzzling phenomenon, but the planters are hoping that the western disturbance will return to its normal course and bring rain to the hills.

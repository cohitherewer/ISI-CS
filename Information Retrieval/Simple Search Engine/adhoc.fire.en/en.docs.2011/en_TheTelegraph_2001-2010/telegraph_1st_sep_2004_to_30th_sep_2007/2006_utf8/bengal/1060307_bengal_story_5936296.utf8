The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Govt office opens at 12, jobless may wait

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, March 6: About 300 jobless youths stood in queue this morning for the employment exchange here to open at 10, but the babus turned up for work around noon.

 When the youths protested, the officers called police.

 At least a dozen people were injured when the police resorted to a lathi-charge in front of the employment exchange office ? about 85 km from Calcutta ? around 12.30 pm. 

 Two youths, Rupam Joardar of Hogolberia and Mrinal Sarkar of Tehatta, were admitted to Shaktinagar General Hospital. Rupam has a fractured right arm. Mrinal was hit in the head.

 There were many women in the queue waiting for the employment exchange officer-in-charge, Tarapada Roy, and his colleagues.

 Roy denied being late. He accused the youths of attacking him. No employee of this office arrived late. Whatever the youths are saying is false. They tried to beat me up and I tried to save myself by calling up the police. They smashed office furniture and I have lodged a police complaint. 

 Nadia superintendent of police R. Rajsekharan said an inquiry has begun.

 What witnesses said does not tally with Roys version of events. Seeing the police charge towards them, the youths tried to reason with them, said a tea-stall owner. There were so many women... the youths tried to tell the police officers that they had only protested against the delay in opening of the office. But the police beat them up.

 The youths later met additional district magistrate (general) Rajesh Sinha and submitted a memorandum. Sinha said: Some of them were injured. I have ordered an inquiry into the incident. If the employment exchange officer and the employees are found guilty, strong action will be taken against them.

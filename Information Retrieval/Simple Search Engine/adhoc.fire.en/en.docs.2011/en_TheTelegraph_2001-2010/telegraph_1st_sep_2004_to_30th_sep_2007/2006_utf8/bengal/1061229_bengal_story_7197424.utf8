The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 A spring in Writers step

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Dec. 28: The mood at Writers Buildings was upbeat from early afternoon as news spread of an impending meeting and the possibility of a solution to the impasse.

 Journalists, government staff and onlookers began to gather in the corridors even as officials and ministers began arriving for the meeting.

 Housing minister Goutam Deb, who had been picked for informal talks with Trinamul Congress leaders because of his trouble-free acquisition of 10,000 acres for Rajarhat, was the first to arrive.

 Soon after, the managing director of the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation, Debashish Som, who is handling the paperwork on Singur, walked in. 

 Hooghly district magistrate Vinod Kumar and industries director M.V. Rao came around 4.15 pm. Both these officers were engaged in compiling the list of farmers who had consented to hand over their land.

 Soon after commerce and industries minister Nirupam Sen made his entry around 4.45 pm, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee walked in, looking tense. The meeting began at 5 in the evening.

 Deb was the first to leave the chief ministers chamber around 6.30 pm. He said Bhattacharjee would address a news conference in five minutes. Soon after, joint secretary Bhaskar Layek left with a letter for Mamata Banerjee.

 As the clock ticked away without any announcement from the Trinamul Congress camp, the mood at Writers turned sombre. Bhattacharjee and Sen were glued to the TV set to watch the reaction of the Mamata camp.

 Around 8 pm, Bhattacharjee left Writers. Ive written a letter but am not revealing the contents. Lets hope for the best, he said.

 By midnight, Mamata had called off her fast.

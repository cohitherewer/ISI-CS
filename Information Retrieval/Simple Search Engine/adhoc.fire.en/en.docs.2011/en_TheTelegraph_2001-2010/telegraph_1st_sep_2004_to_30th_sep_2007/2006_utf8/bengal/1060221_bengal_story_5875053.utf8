 Shirkers beware, CMs here

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Siliguri, Feb. 20: Handing over an ailing food-processing plant here to an electronic appliance maker, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today said all employees would be absorbed in the new unit but there would be no room for shirkers.

 Nobody will lose their job, the chief minister said, allaying fears that the 35 remaining workers of Darjeeling Fruit and Vegetable Processing Cooperative Society, popularly known as Kanchan, would have nowhere to go.

 He added: Faki mere kaaj shekha jabe na. Mon diye kaj korben (No one can learn by shirking. Work sincerely). 

 All workers, even women, will be trained. 

 Kitchen Appliance India, a fully-owned subsidiary of Videocon, will build its unit at Matigara on the outskirts of Siliguri. Over 400 people will be employed in the Rs 100-crore plant to be ready for production in three months.

 Gautam Sengupta, Videocons chief operations officer (east), said all Kanchan workers will also be paid their dues.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Result timetable

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, May 7: The counting of ballots will start at 8 am on Thursday and the results will start trickling in from 11.

 The final results will be available on the Election Commissions website.

 Election observers, who have been part of the polls from the time of the rolls revision, will also be present during the counting, chief electoral officer Debashis Sen said to- day. Counting will be held in presence of EC observers in nearly 100 venues comprising over 450 counting halls across the state, he added.

 All result inputs would be sent to the commission in Delhi and then redirected to its Calcutta headquarters. In this process, trends will be available from time to time, Sen said.

 The chief electoral officer held a video conference with the south Bengal district magistrates this evening to finalise arrangements for the counting. 

 About 450 companies of the paramilitary have been deployed for the final round of elections in north Bengal tomorrow. The BSF has been issued guidelines to step up vigil along the international borders.

 To ensure uninterrupted polling in some of the remote hill areas, extra voting machines have been sent. 

 Shrikhola in Darjeeling, for example, is the second highest polling station in the country at 12,000 feet. The nearest sector office, from where alternative voting machines can be sent to Shrikhola in case the ones being used develop snags, is 146 km away. 

 Observers ? two for each constituency ? and sector officers are already at work.

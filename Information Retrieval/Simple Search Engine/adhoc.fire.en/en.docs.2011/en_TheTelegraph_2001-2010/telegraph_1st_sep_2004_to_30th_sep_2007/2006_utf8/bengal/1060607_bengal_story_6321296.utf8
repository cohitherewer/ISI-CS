The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Elections take toll of blood bank stocks 

 ABHIJEET CHATTERJEE

 Burdwan, June 6: Blood banks in Bengal run dry every summer but the polls this year have taken a heavier toll.

 Burdwan and Bankura medical colleges are now reeling under the scarcity. 

 Subodh Bhattacharya, the blood bank director of Burd-wan Medical College and Hospital, said: We require about 1,600 units every month, we have only 55 now.

 The banks primarily depend on blood donation camps organised by NGOs, clubs and political organisations for fresh stocks. Many of their activities are anyway on a low scale during summer. The preoccupation with the polls has compounded the problem. 

 A.K. Pradhan, the chief medical officer of the blood bank at Bankura Sammilani Medical College and Hospital, said: We are left with only 50 pouches. We are trying to organise camps. 

 There are only two blood banks in Bankura. Besides the medical college, there is one at Bishnupur Subdivisional Hospital.

 Doctors at the medical college said Bankura requires 2,000 pouches of blood every month. The medical college alone requires about 1,500 of them.

 The blood bank at the Burdwan medical college also caters to patients in subdivisional hospitals at Birbhum, Purulia, Bankura and Hooghly and several nursing homes. 

 Midnapore Medical College and Hospital, however, does not face the scarcity crippling the other two.

 The West Midnapore deputy chief medical officer of health said the blood bank there had learnt a lesson from last year. We faced a crisis in 2005 because of lack of camps during summer. So we took special measures this time, said Bibhutibhusan Mahapatra.

 The hospital needs 1,000 units a month. It has about 150 in stock.

 Sujata Bhar, 26, who came to the hospital from Memari, about 15 km away, for transfusion was sent back today because there was no + blood.

 Sanatan Dawn, 42, of Burdwan town, who needs regular blood transfusion, has returned home without treatment for anaemia twice in about a week. 

 Bhattacharya, the blood bank director, said: We have also asked the patients and their relatives to bear with us.

 The chief medical officer of the Bankura medical college blood bank blamed the districts backwardness for the crisis, which often runs through the year. 

 Many people, Pradhan said, lack awareness about the need to donate blood and social welfare organisations find it difficult to convince them.

 Girls in kidnap drama after test

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Sept. 16: Three teenage girls in school uniform created a stir at Belghoria railway station this evening claiming they were being kidnapped and had somehow slipped out of their train.

 Questioning by railway police, however, revealed that the girls all of them students of class VIII had cooked up the story. 

 They were trying to run away from home after doing poorly in their weekly school tests. 

 Initially, when the girls claimed they had managed to wriggle out of the clutches of their kidnappers, we believed them. But as we questioned them on the details, inconsistencies began to emerge, said Barun Mullick, the superintendent of Government Railway Police, Sealdah.

 The girls, for instance, said the kidnappers had snatched their golden earrings but we later found them inside their bags. We informed their parents and handed them over.

 Witnesses said the girls had got off a Gede-bound local train around 5.30 pm and were moving aimlessly around the railway station, located on the northern fringes of the city.

 Railway police officers soon spotted the girls and brought them to the forces outpost on platform No. 1 for questioning.

 The girls said the kidnappers had forced six of them into a Tata Sumo from outside their school in Kasba soon after classes closed around 2 in the afternoon. The three of them were later herded into a local train they didnt know what had happened to the others, an officer said.

 As the bluff gradually unfolded, the GRP got in touch with the Kasba police station. The parents were asked to receive their children at Belghoria.

 Student suicide

 A 14-year-old schoolgirl was found hanging from the ceiling at her home on Saturday morning in Howrah town, police said.

 Class IX student Priyan-ka Saha, a resident of Ramchandrapur near Bally, was known to be a fairly good student. 

 It is apparently a case of suicide. However, we have sent the body for post-mortem and begun an investigation into the matter, said Milan Das, the additional superintendent of police (town), Howrah.

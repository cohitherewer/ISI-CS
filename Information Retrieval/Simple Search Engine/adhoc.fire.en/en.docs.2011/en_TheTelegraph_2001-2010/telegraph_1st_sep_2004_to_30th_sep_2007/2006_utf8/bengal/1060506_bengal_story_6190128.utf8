The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Gorkhaland awake in the lap of penury

 Menoka Thapa doesnt think twice before saying she would vote for the GNLF. 

 Ask why and she stares at her husband, hiding her apologetic smile behind hands blackened by years of making dallas (balls of black soil used as fuel). 

 Like many other women of Tindharia, a small town in the hills, around 30 km from Siliguri, the sister-in-law of Kishore Thapa, who was killed by a CRPF bullet in 1988 when he was 15, doesnt have an alternative. Khai koni (dont know why), she says. Then, search-ing for a better answer, she adds: Weve always done that. 

 Mention Kishore and Menoka, 40, flares up. He was a kid and the CRPF shot him along with his friends, she says, refusing to say whether he was a GNLF activist.

 In her room ? one of three in the house ? theres a Sushmita Sen poster pasted on a wooden showcase that displays sundry cups and shields. 

 Kishore had won many of them. Her son, Yugen, earned the rest in football matches and cultural competitions. 

 Asked if she likes the former Miss Universe, Menoka says: I dont even know who she is. The picture hides the crack in the glass. 

 She loves listening to Nepali songs and watching movies on the black-and-white TV in the corner, but wheres the time?

 With the Rs 1,900 husband Uday earns as a DGHC forest guard, a job he got as compensation for his brothers death, it is difficult to make ends meet. His job is not yet permanent, Menoka shrugs. 

 I have to walk over a kilometre every day for water, wash clothes and dishes in the dhara (stream) and make dallas, Menoka says, trying to explain the tan on her taut skin. 

 Has she heard about sunscreen lotions? No.

 Menoka, mother of Yugen (Class VII) and Amar (Class II), sometimes wishes she had a daughter. The boys chip in, fetching water before school. But they have a long way to go, they have to get government jobs. A daughter could have been a bigger help.

 Menoka has a Janata stove, but kerosene is Rs 20 a litre. So, the chullah (earthen oven), fed by her dallas, is lit up every morning. Frugal meals ? chapattis, dal, vegetables and meat once in a blue moon ? cook in the small kitchen outside the wooden house. 

 Making the dallas is tiresome and much more expensive than what it used to be. She needs about two sacks of black soil (60-65 kg in each) every month. They cost Rs 120-150 each. I mix gelatine to make them burn better.

 Even her dreams reach no farther than a pucca house. If Yugen or Amar gets a government job, maybe she would have one.

 Menoka will vote and so will her 72-year-old mother-in-law. She is at her sister-in-laws in Kurseong, 20 km away, but will be back before Monday.

 Is she a Gorkhali (as Indian Nepalis want to be called) or Nepali (Nepalis from Nepal)? Gorkhali, she declares. Does she want Gorkhaland? Yes.

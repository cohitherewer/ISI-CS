 Sadhu fathers 32

 Burdwan, Feb. 3: A sadhu here is allegedly the father of 32 people who want their names included in voter lists.

 The district administration has ordered a probe into the CPM charge that Kapilananda Brahmacharis name appears as the father of 32 residents of Jahannagar on applications that they have submitted to election officers.

 The sadhu runs an ashram in the village in Kalna, 250 km from Calcutta, part of the Nadanghat Assembly constituency. Local CPM leader Anju Kar said the party suspects that the 32 are Bangladeshis.

 The administration has also asked the BDO of Barabani, Abdul Hasid, to go on leave and issued a showcause notice to Someswar Dey, the BDO of Ausgram-II following alleged dereliction of election duty.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Voters fret for photo cards

 OUR BUREAU

 March 24: Lack of co-ordina-tion among election officials is resulting in harassment of voters in Calcutta and the 24-Parganas.

 Shila Karmakar, 23, a resident of Habra in North 24-Parganas, had to stand in the sun for over four hours in her advanced stage of pregnancy along with a few hundred people to get a new voter card from the subdivisional office. She had lost the earlier one in the 2002 floods. 

 When I reached the official concerned, four-and-a-half hours after I queued up, I was feeling sick. But there was more trouble. I was told to approach the mobile photographing centre about which I had no clue, said Shila, a voter from Deganga constituency. 

 Complaints have poured in from Calcutta as well.

 A 73-year-old resident of Southend Park did not get his I-card despite being photographed twice before the 2004 Lok Sabha polls. He applied again this time and was photographed on March 23 after having to wait for over an hour. 

 I had to go to Adi Bally- gunge Vidyalaya for the photograph, where there was chaos and absolutely no system. Id to ask around for a long time before I could find my counter in the absence of signboards mentioning part numbers, said the former IAS officer. 

 Barasat subdivisional officer S.C. Ghosh blamed lack of infrastructure for the problem. He said he was earlier told to attend to voters who had shifted house or had mistakes in their I-cards. But our work increased manifold as people who lost their cards also started coming to us. 

 Nineteen-year-old Priyab-rata Guha of Atabagan in Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees Jadavpur constituency had applied for inclusion in the voter list. His name was not on the final electoral rolls. 

 Last week, he went to Kishore Bharati Krirangan in Jadavpur for an enquiry and stood in a queue for several hours. 

 Election workers came to our house and took down my name. But it was not there on the list. I dont know whether I will be able to vote, said Priyabrata, a first-timer. 

 Joint chief election commissioner Nikhil Sahana pleaded a communication gap. We have made elaborate arrangements, but instructions often do not reach the lower level. District authorities have been told to hire extra cameras, if necessary.

 Calcutta, May 15: Difference of opinion over some portfolios at the secretariat meeting today forced the CPM to convene another session of its apex decision-making body in the state tomorrow.

 The search for a labour minister is on, while discussions also took place on whether there should be a change of guard in health, land and land reforms, panchayat, information technology and sports.

 After the meeting, veteran leader Jyoti Basu said: We will meet again tomorrow even- ing. I will also be there.

 Sources said power minister Mrinal Banerjees name cropped up during the search for a labour minister. He has reasonable experience in trade union politics, they added. 

 If labour goes to Banerjee, power might go to a South 24-Parganas MLA.

 IT, a section of the party feels, should be looked after by an expert in that field. Taltala MLA Debesh Das, a computer engineering professor at Jadavpur University, is a contender for the job.

 Although Subhas Chakraborty has Basus patronage, the party is divided on his continuance as sports minister. 

 Leaders close to the chief minister are keen to see urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya handling sports. But our report is that Subhasda will get both transport and sports, a North 24-Parganas CPM secretariat member said. 

 Most secretariat members are in favour of Surjyakanta Mishra retaining health, but a section of the party wants him in land and land reforms ? a crucial department at a time of rapid industrialisation. 

 Land reforms minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah had initially struck a discordant note when the government began looking for land for the Salim Group in South 24-Parganas last year. That did not send right signals to the chief minister, a CPM leader said.

 There was a debated today on whether former health minister Partha De should replace Mishra. 

 There was talk on whether De can be given education, but some leaders voiced apprehension because English had been withdrawn from the primary level during his stint as education minister.

 The CPMs allies will submit names of their ministers to Left Front chairman tomorrow. The RSP and the CPI are likely to retain their portfolios but the Forward Bloc may be asked to sacrifice agriculture. 

 The CPM state committee will meet on Wednesday to ratify its list of ministers and a front meeting will follow it.

 Duty roster glare on DC

 IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI

 Calcutta, April 22: A senior IPS officer has come under the Election Commissions glare for violating its directives on deployment of police for Thursdays poll in the city.

 In a booklet relating to police arrangements, deputy commissioner of police (headquarters) Anuj Sharma had said Calcutta police would be deployed at polling stations.

 According to the poll panels directives, only central paramilitary forces are to be deployed on the premises of polling booths.

 In the 20-page booklet issued by Sharma under his signature, the controversial part appears on page 14 under the heading Nature of Duty.

 It says: Central paramilitary forces would be responsible for protecting the polling stations and regulating the entry inside polling stations. Calcutta police would be responsible for maintaining law and order in various constituencies both inside and outside the polling booths and premises.

 Chief electoral officer Debashis Sen said: I have not seen the booklet signed by the officer concerned directing the policemen to enter polling stations. But I have heard about it and this is a violation of norms. We have already mentioned that police have to abide by the Election Commissions directive. Lets see whether it was a mistake or he (Sharma) meant it (the directive in the booklet).

 Admitting the mistake, Sharma said: I didnt mean what has appeared in the booklet. Policemen will be outside the polling booths and their job will be to maintain law and order. Only central paramilitary forces will be allowed inside polling booths.

 The police can go inside only in case of an emergency or if the situation so demands, he added.

 As deputy commissioner of police (headquarters), Sharma is in charge of maintaining law and order in the city during the elections.

 The booklet was released last night and a copy was sent to all IPS officers and officers-in-charge of all 48 police stations in the city. Some IPS officers noticed the mistake and drew Sharmas attention to it.

 This is a major blunder. According to the Election Commissions directives, only central paramilitary forces will be allowed at polling stations. State police will be outside to maintain law and order. The DC (headquarters) should be more careful, said a senior police officer.

 In accordance with the order published in the booklet, some officers of police stations had been allotted duties on polling booths premises in their respective areas.

 A meeting was called in the evening and Sharma was asked to rectify the mistake, the police officer added.

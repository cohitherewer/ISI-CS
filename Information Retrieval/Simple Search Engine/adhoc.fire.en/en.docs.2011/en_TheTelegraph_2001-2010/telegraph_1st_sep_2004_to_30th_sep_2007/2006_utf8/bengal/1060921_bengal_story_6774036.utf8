 Kidnap after shalishi

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Behrampore, Sept. 20: A 50-year-old father-in-law was kidnapped at gun-point last evening after he refused to cough up Rs 60,000, which a kangaroo court that granted divorce to his daughter-in-law wanted him to pay as compensation.

 Iqbal Molla, the 24-year-old son of Luzbal, accused CPM panchayat member Mehboob Halsana of playing a lead role in the shalishi a meeting of the village elders to solve his marital dispute.

 Luzbal is allegedly held captive somewhere in Nadias Tehatta, where Iqbals wife Rakiba hails from. Iqbals family lives in Naoda, Murshidabad, about 220 km from Calcutta.

 The officer-in-charge of the Naoda police station, Sanjay Biswas, said his Tehatta counterpart has been alerted about the kidnap complaint. Were looking for Luzbal and his kidnappers, he added. 

 Panchayat member Meh- boob is absconding. The police are also looking for Iqbals father-in-law Mahiruddin Khamaru.

 Iqbal got married a year and a half ago. His wife left for her fathers home six months later. Over the past year, we tried to bring her back but she didnt return. My father-in-law approached the panchayat member recently for a shalishi to get the divorce. The meeting was held yesterday, he said.

 The villagers fined Iqbal without saying what his fault was. Baitullah Halsana, who was one of the judges, said: In almost all shalishi meetings relating to divorce, the verdict goes in favour of the girl. In this case, we were worried about the girls future and the prospects of her second marriage. So we asked Iqbals family to pay Rs 60,000. I was not present during the kidnapping. 

 Iqbal said after his father refused to pay, Mehboob, his father-in-law Mahiruddin and three others dragged Luzbal away. I tried to stop them. But they pointed a gun at me. My father was whisked away on a motorcycle, he added.

 Behrampore subdivisional officer Prabhas Biswas said the shalishi was illegal. No one can hold such meetings to solve a marital dispute. We will start a probe.

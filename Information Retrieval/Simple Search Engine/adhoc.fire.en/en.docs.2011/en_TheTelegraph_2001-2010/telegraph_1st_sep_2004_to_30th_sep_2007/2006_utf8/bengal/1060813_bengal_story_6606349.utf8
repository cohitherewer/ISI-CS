The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Tortured mother and child in death hug

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 12: A homemaker in her twenties and her six-year-old son died today after she set herself on fire and wrapped the kerosene-drenched child in a fatal embrace, possibly to escape dowry harassment. 

 Nirmala Ram, a resident of Alipore, and her son were admitted to hospital last night, where they succumbed to burn injuries around 2 this afternoon.

 Her husband Arun, a salesman in a private firm, and his parents were arrested after Nirmalas brother lodged a complaint accusing her in-laws of torturing her for dowry. 

 Nirmala locked herself in a room in her in-laws home on Rakhal Das Auddy Road. Her son was also in the room, said the officer-in-charge of Alipore police station, Nanda Dulal Paul.

 Nirmala sprinkled kerosene on herself and Ayush. After setting herself on fire, she grabbed the boy, he said.

 Hearing their screams, her in-laws and neighbours broke open the door. They doused the fire and took the two to hospital.

 Both had more than 80 per cent burns. We started their treatment immediately and provided them all medical support. But their condition was serious, said a doctor.

 First, Ayush stopped responding to treatment. A few minutes after he was declared dead, Nirmala succumbed to her wounds, said an officer of Alipore police station.

 When the news reached Nirmalas home in Gaya, her brother Radhakrishna Narayan rushed to Calcutta and lodged a police complaint.

 She mentioned about it (torture by her in-laws) a number of times. But we thought the problem would not continue. We hold the in-laws completely responsible for my sisters death, Radhakrishna said in his complaint.

 According to the police, Nirmala married Arun seven years ago. Neighbours said they would often hear the couple quarrelling late at night but never thought that it would take such a tragic turn, Paul said.

 Nirmalas in-laws said during interrogation that she had her lunch and went to her room. They said they came to know about the incident only after hearing Nirmala and her son screaming, an officer said.

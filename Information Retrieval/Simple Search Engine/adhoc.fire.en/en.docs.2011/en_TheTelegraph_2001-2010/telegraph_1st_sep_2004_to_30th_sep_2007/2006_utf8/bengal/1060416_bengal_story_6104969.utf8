The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Teachers school blow to govt

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 15: Calcutta High Court on Wednesday said it could not hear a petition seeking revision of an order banning 115 Primary Teachers Training Institutes across the state because a judge had been transferred.

 The division bench of Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurkar and Justice A.K. Ganguly released the case from the court, landing the state education department in a soup. 

 The government had moved the petition early this month seeking revision of the order that declared the 115 institutes illegal as they had not obtained clearance certificates from the National Council for Teachers Education (NCTE).

 With thousands of people, many of them CPM workers, affected by the order, the high courts move could be cause for trouble for the education department in the run-up to the Assembly elections. 

 On Wednesday, the judges released the matter from their court as Justice Ganguly had been transferred to Orissa High Court.

 It will be not possible for us to hear the petition because Justice Ganguly is leaving the court, the chief justice said.

 On March 2 this year, the same division bench had directed the government to ask the 115 Primary Teachers Training Institutes to stop admitting students as they did not have the clearance certificates.

 It also asked the West Bengal Board for Primary Teachers Education not to issue certificates to students who passed from these institutes.

 The judges had said that according to the National Council for Teachers Training Act, 1993, the NCTE certificate is mandatory.

 In its revision petition, the government had tried to convince the court that the state had enacted a law empowering the board of primary education to affiliate private teachers training institutes. It also said priority was given to the candidates with certificates from these institutes.

 The high court, however, has completed the hearing of a case on a similar issue. The court asked North Bengal University to cancel the affiliation of 15 BEd colleges, which have allegedly not obtained the NCTEs permission before starting their courses.

 The verdict in the case will be delivered by the same bench on Monday, Justice Gangulys last working day.

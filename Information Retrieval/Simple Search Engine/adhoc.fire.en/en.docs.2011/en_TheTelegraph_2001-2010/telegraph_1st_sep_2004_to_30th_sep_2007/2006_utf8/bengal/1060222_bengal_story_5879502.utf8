The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Poll rolls today

 Calcutta, Feb. 21: The revised electoral rolls will be published tomorrow. 

 Voters will be able to check their names in the rolls, which will be displayed at nearly 48,768 booths across the state. 

 N.K. Sahana, the joint chief electoral officer, said people who find their names missing will be able to apply in plain paper praying for their inclusion within 15 days. Names of nearly 4,500 people from all over the state ? barring Darjeeling and West Midnapore ? have been deleted as they had non-bailable warrants against them.

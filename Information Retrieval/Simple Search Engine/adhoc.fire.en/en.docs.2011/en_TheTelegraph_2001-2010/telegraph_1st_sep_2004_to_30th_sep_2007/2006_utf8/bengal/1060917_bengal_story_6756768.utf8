 Constables drag youth from death

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 16: Two constables of the Lake police station in south Calcutta today saved a jobless youth who was about to jump in front of a train near Dhakuria railway station.

 Ajay Kumar, deputy commissioner of police, south division, said the youth was in his mid-20s . Had the constables taken a few more minutes to reach the spot, he could not have been saved, he said.

 He left home saying he would meet some of his friends in the neighbourhood. But he came to Dhakuria railway station and started walking along the tracks.

 When the constables saw the 21-year-old standing close to the railway tracks in an isolated place, they realised something was wrong. 

 A local train was on the line. First they cautioned him by shouting, said an officer of the Lake police station. But when he did not respond, the constables rushed to him and dragged him to safety.

 The youth told the police that he was mentally disturbed because he could not find a job. Officers later took him home.

 A couple of a days ago, policemen from the same thana had stopped a poor man and his eight-year-old son from jumping into Rabindra Sarobar.

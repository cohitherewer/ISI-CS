The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Common code for all schools

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Feb. 20: The Assembly today passed a bill making it mandatory for all state-funded minority schools to recruit teachers through the School Service Commission.

 Last year, the government made it compulsory for Ramakrishna Mission-run schools ? which receive government aid ? to recruit teachers from the panel drawn up by the commission. 

 School education minister Kanti Biswas said the government felt the necessity to pass the West Bengal School Service Commission (Amendment) Bill, 2006, after noticing an increasing trend among government-aided minority schools to appoint teachers not recruited by the commission.

 Biswas said the bill would also ensure a uniform system of teacher recruitment in all categories of state-aided schools.

 The government had received complaints that state-funded minority schools that did not take teachers through the commission were not being transparent in their recruitment process. 

 There are nearly 700 minority-run government-funded schools in the state. All of them will have to appoint teachers through the West Bengal School Service Commission, Biswas said.

 Many minority institutions, the minister added, were approaching the government with the demand that they be allowed to recruit teachers on their own citing two clauses in the existing act that empowered such schools to do so with the commissions approval. 

 Biswas said the new system will be applicable to all state-aided schools run by Christian and other religious and linguistic minorities in the state but not the 60-odd Anglo-Indian schools as they are not fully funded by the government.

 In a bid to promote education among the minority communities, the government had kept a provision in Section 15 of the West Bengal School Service Commission Act, 1997, empowering the state-funded minority schools to recruit teachers on their own, the minister said.

 But many schools had started taking advantage of that. When we tried to stop them, they moved court, he said.

 At least 15 minority schools which were denied the permission to recruit their own teachers had filed cases against the government. 

 The government lost the cases because the court, in most of them, cited Section 15 of the act and ordered it to allow the schools to recruit teachers from outside the commissions panel.

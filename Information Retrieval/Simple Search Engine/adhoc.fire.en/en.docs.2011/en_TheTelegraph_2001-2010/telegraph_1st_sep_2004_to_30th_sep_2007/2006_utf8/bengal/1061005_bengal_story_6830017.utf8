 Calcutta, Oct. 4: Mamata Banerjees party today asked the government to put Tata Motors Singur project on hold. 

 The entire process has to be stalled for a review in the interest of poor farmers whose land has been acquired through a government order, former MP Ajit Panja said today.

 Multi-crop land has been acquired in Singur for the Tata project hurting the farmers interests, he added.

 Asked if the decision to skip the all-party meeting on Bengals industrialisation would send a wrong signal to the people, the Trinamul leader said: The meeting is an eyewash.... The government has already acquired land for the Tata project.

 Panja claimed that several Congress leaders, including Subrata Mukherjee, had called to congratulate us (Trinamul) for the well thought-out decision. 

 He again urged the government to acquire land occupied by 58,000 closed and sick fac- tories for industry. We object to the manner in which the chief minister is grabbing land of farmers who depend on them for livelihood. 

 Congress legislature party leader Manas Bhuniya said he had requested the chief minister not to do anything in haste regarding the Tatas small-car project in Singur, about 40 km from Calcutta. 

 Bhuniya and Congress chief whip Asit Mal attended todays meeting.

 We suggested that a land commission be set up first to identify land for large and medium-scale units keeping in view the states agricultural growth, Bhuniya said.

 Till such a commission is constituted, the government should not proceed with the Tata project. 

 Asked about the govern- ments announcement that Tata Motors will start construction by the end of the year, Bhuniya said: It is up to the government, but we have placed our demands.

 The Congress also asked for a white paper on the entire industrialisation process. 

 Left Front partners who had yesterday said they were happy with the governments explanation on the choice of Singur as the birthplace of the Rs 1-lakh car, today demanded rehabilitation of the landlosers. Agriculture minister Naren De of the Forward Bloc and the RSPs Debabrata Bandopadhayay were among front leaders not entirely happy with the government. 

 There would be bloodshed if attempts are made to go ahead with the project overlooking farmers interests, said SUCIs Manik Mukherjee.

 The Congress has decided to actively support the Trianamul-sponsored bandh on October 9 in protest against the Singur project. Panja said Subrata Mukherjee had told him that Congress workers would take to the streets to make the bandh a success. 

 But whether Mamata herself would be as active is not clear. The Trinamul chief, in hospital since Wednesday, was released tonight. But Sudarshan Ghosh Dastidar, a doctor who attended to her, said: She is stable, but needs rest.

 Mamata had been admitted with chest pain and breathing problems.

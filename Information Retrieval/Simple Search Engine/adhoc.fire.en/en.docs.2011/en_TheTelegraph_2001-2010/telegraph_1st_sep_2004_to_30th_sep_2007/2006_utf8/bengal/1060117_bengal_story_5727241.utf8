The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 JU sows hope of silky routes

 MITA MUKHERJEE

Calcutta, Jan. 16: Jadavpur University today announced a study on every aspect of the citys transportation system that could ultimately lead to a commuter getting to know on a mobile phone the best route to a place at any point of time.

 We want to prepare a det-ailed report with facts and figures to present a micro-level picture of the citys roads and traffic movement and the kind of improvement they are crying for, said Partha Pratim Biswas, a member of the universitys executive council.

 A university official said everything to do with transport and commuter movement ? volume, space available, possible expansion, pattern of people and vehicle flow in and out of Howrah and Sealdah stations, circular rail, metro, bus, auto and taxi services and their fares ? will be examined. The first phase of the research will be over in 2007.

 The findings will be made available to all agencies concerned so that they can plan projects better.

 Scientists and teachers of three departments ? computer science, construction engineering and civil engineering ? will participate in the research, part of a Rs 30-crore project funded by the World Bank. 

 The other objective of the project is to provide the commuter a real-time picture of on-road conditions, traffic movement, fares, available modes of transport and level of rainwater on roads. They only need to have mobile phone connectivity and they will be able to take the route that best suits them, Biswas said.

 At 9 am, the user may be asked to take a particular route. At another hour, he might take a different route to the same destination. If that route passes through a water-logging-prone area, the commuter may be asked to take yet another way during monsoon.

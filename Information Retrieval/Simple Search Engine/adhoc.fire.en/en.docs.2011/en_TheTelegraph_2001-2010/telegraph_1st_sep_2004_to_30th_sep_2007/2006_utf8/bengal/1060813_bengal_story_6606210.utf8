The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Rural link to Writers

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Aug. 12: Nadia today became the first district to have all its 17 blocks connected to Writers Buildings via video- and teleconferencing.

 This is the first step in the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee governments larger plan to link all panchayats through video- and teleconferencing.

 It is being done so that instructions can travel straight to the grassroots level administration. 

 The government, with the help of the Indian Space Research Organisation, is spending Rs 6 crore for each district for this connectivity.

 Bankim Ghosh, the minister of state for panchayats and rural development, today said the administration would shortly begin linking other districts to Writers as the chief minister wanted contact with the lower-level administration officials to make sure that projects are being implemented at the grassroots.

 The ministers and the secretaries of various departments at Writers Buildings would now have to oversee the progress of each project that is coming up in the districts, Ghosh said. 

 Earlier, there was no way of passing on an order on any scheme and then relaying it to the district administration for implementation. But under the system, the chief minister, too, if he wishes, can seek clarifications from a panchayat pradhan or a panchayat samity president, the minister said.

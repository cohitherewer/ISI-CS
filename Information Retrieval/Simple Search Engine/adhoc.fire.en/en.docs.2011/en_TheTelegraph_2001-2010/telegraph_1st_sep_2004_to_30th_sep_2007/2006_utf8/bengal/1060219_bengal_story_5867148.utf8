The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Jaitley puts pact ball in Cong court

 Calcutta, Feb. 18: BJP leader Arun Jaitley today said it was for the Congress to decide if it wanted to help the CPM by splitting anti-Left votes.

 Jaitley, the party general secretary in charge of Bengal, came down to Calcutta to attend a state committee meeting. It is learnt that the state party spoke about strengthening the alliance with the Trinamul Congress and concluded that Mamata Banerjee should be treated as the undisputed rallying force in Bengal.

 Jaitley said: (The) Congress will have to decide whether it would help the CPM by not strengthening the Mamata-BJP alliance. It is for the Congress to think whether it wants a consolidation of anti-Left forces or play a spoiler by splitting the anti-Left votes.

 He equated the Congresss dilemma in Bengal to its indecision in Bihar over whether to align with Ram Vilas Paswan or Lalu Prasad Yadav.

 Jaitley, however, gave no hint of his partys formula for sharing seats with Mamata.

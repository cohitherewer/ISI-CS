 Calcutta: Under attack from the Opposition, land and land reforms minister A.R. Molla told the Assembly the Salim Group has been asked to submit a detailed report on their South 24-Parganas project. If I find that it will benefit people, we will acquire land.

 Calcutta: Mohammad Ayub was held on Friday night for the murder of Mohammad Iqbal in Ekbalpore on Thursday.

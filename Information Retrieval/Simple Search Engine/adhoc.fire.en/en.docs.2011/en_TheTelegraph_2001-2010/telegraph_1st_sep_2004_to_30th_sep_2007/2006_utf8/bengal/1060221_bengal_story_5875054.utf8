 Calcutta, Feb. 20: Like the Congress leaders over the past few days, Mamata Banerjee today conceded that something positive might emerge on seat-sharing with Sonia Gan- dhis party.

 We shall discuss further with AICC how to prevent a split in anti-CPM votes. Wait for a few more days and something positive will emerge, Mamata said on her return from Delhi.

 Yesterday, the Trinamul Congress chief had held a second round of talks with Margaret Alva, the AICC general secretary in charge of Bengal, apparently to work out a seat-sharing formula that would suit both parties. 

 The Congress enjoys CPM support at the Centre and Trinamul is a BJP ally.

 Mamata had first called on Alva on February 15 after the Congress leader returned to the capital from Calcutta having gauged the mood of the Bengal party unit on a possible tie-up with Trinamul. 

 Before that, Mamata had twice met state Congress president and defence minister Pranab Mukherjee in Calcutta. 

 A change is inevitable in Bengal and the CPM cannot stop this by even mounting pressure on the Centre. People will give a mandate against the communists this time for its 29-year misrule, Mamata told a rally of civic employees opposite the Calcutta Municipal Corporation headquarters this afternoon.

 She did not utter a word against the Congress, giving enough hint that she would not like to antagonise the party at this juncture.

 State Congress working president Pradip Bhattacharya said tonight: Our high command is working overtime to explore every possible way to forge an understanding with Trinamul.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Booths off party yard

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, Feb. 5: The Election Commission has asked state poll officials to identify every polling station located within 200 metres of a political partys office and shift it elsewhere.

 The move, aimed at preventing the parties from influencing the polling, comes on a day chief election commissioner B.B. Tandon, speaking in Delhi, promised to try and stop booth-jamming.

 We have so far identified nearly 2,000 such polling stations across Bengal barring Calcutta. They have to be shifted under the model code, state chief electoral officer Debashish Sen said. This is being seen as a first?.

 CPM leader Rabin Deb said his party would close down its smaller offices that are within 200 metres of polling stations, but we cannot shut our central offices.

 Deb, the Left Front chief whip in the Assembly, added that the CPM had expressed its reservations on the subject at an all-party meeting called by the poll panel.

 Sen said its thanks to the election authoritys pro-active role that the names of a staggering 10 lakh bogus voters had been deleted and those of nearly 21 lakh new voters included. 

 In (January) 2005, the names of 3.39 lakh voters who had died or shifted (out of their constituencies) were deleted and 10.33 lakh fresh voters included, he said, adding that last years was a summary revision compared with a total cleaning process this time.

 The commission, Sen said, has devised a technique called e-roll cleaning process to weed out bogus voters. Its a massive exercise involving scrutiny of municipal and panchayat death registers, collection of information at the local level, two visits to the state by panel officials and another two by the observers.

 The BJP today alleged that a file of complaints it had lodged with the Burdwan town administration had been lost. Party leaders, however, managed to submit a copy.

 The observer for Burdwan, Rabindranath Das, visited Asansol, Barabani and Hirapur, where Trinamul MLA Moloy Ghatak handed him a complaint purportedly listing fake ration cards and dead voters.

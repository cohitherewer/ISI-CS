 Behrampore/Calcutta, Sept. 8: The chief minister today said Opposition leaders in the state were trying to make land acquisition for industry an issue in a desperate bid to protect their political identities.

 Reacting to the Congresss decision to match the Trinamul Congress in protesting against acquisition at Singur, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said: The problem is that our Opposition leaders have nothing else to do. That is why they are desperate to do something for their political existence.

 They cannot stop us from setting up industry in the state. Let them shout as much as they can, well do what we have to, he added while talking to reporters in Behrampore on his way back to Calcutta from Malda, where he had gone to campaign for the bypolls. 

 Information and broadcasting minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi will lead a Congress procession in Singur on September 11. Tata Motors wants to build a car factory on 1,000 acres there.

 The Congresss Subrata Mukherjee said in Calcutta that the Singur rally would mark the beginning of a pro- longed agitation against the governments conversion of agricultural land. 

 Like Trinamul, which has been saying it is not opposed to industry but is resisting land acquisition for the Tata project, Mukherjee said: We are not against industry or the Tatas. But why should the government force farmers to give away land for a car factory?

 He added that jute, paddy and potato farming would suffer, spelling disaster for jute mills and cold storage units.

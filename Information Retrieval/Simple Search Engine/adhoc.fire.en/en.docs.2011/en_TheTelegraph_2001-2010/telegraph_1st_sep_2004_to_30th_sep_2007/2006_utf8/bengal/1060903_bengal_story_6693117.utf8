 Debt turn to doctor death

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Burdwan, Sept. 2: A day after gynaecologist Aditya Prasad Roy was arrested for allegedly murdering his friend and business partner, his son Krishnagopal today told police that Abhaypada Das owed his father Rs 3 lakh, which might have driven him to suicide.

 Abhaypada was found hanging in the polyclinic he co-owned with Aditya in Khoshbagan area of Burdwan town, 90 km from Calcutta, on Thursday night.

 Apart from Aditya, his son and the caretaker of the clinic were held after residents of Khoshbagan roughed up the gynaecologist. Aditya was admitted to hospital after he complained of chest pain and started vomiting at Burdwan police station.

 Krishnagopal today lodged a complaint against the residents for ransacking the polyclinic. He and the caretaker have been remanded in judicial custody for two weeks. 

 Krishnagopal told the police that Abhaypada had borrowed Rs 3 lakh from his father a year ago to send his daughter abroad for higher studies.

 My father had been asking him to return the money for a couple of weeks, which led to a strain in their relationship. But that does not mean he has killed Abhaypada. Why should he when he owed him so much money? he asked.

 It is a simple case of suicide and we are innocent, Krishnagopal pleaded to the police. 

 According to Abhaypadas elder brother Shyamapada, Aditya called his friend to the clinic on Thursday for some business-related discussion. 

 At midnight, we received a call from the doctor saying my brother had committed suicide. When we reached the clinic, we saw a crowd who said they had heard my brother and Aditya squabbling. We believe the altercation ended in the murder of my brother, he alleged.

 But the Roys lawyer Swapan Banerjee has suggested an alibi for the gynaecologist. At the time Abhaypada hanged himself, my client was not in the clinic. He had left after speaking to Abhaypada. When he returned, he saw Abhaypada hanging from the ceiling fan.

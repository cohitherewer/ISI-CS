 Cong letter to CM candidate

 Durgapur, Jan. 16: The Congress had written to Mamata Banerjee 10 days ago saying she would be the Oppositions chief minister candidate in the Assembly elections if she snapped ties with the BJP.

 Today, Pranab Mukherjee, the defence minister and state Congress chief, said the Trinamul Congress chief has not responded yet. 

 We sent a letter to Mamata 10 days ago expressing our willingness to project her as the alliances candidate for chief minister if she parts ways with BJP, he said here.

 We are serious about stitching together all like-minded, secular anti-CPM forces. There is no problem if Mamata leads the alliance?. But she has to end her relationship with the NDA, he added

 Sticking to her known stand, Mamata today said she will not leave the BJPs side. 

 The Trinamul chief added that she would go through the Congresss letter if it has reached her home at all.

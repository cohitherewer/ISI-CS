The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Salim proposals now under CPM scanner

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, July 14: The 

 CPM today scrutinised the Salim Groups detailed project 

 proposals in the wake of resentment among key Left Front 

 partners at not being kept in the know about the goings-on 

 in the government. 

 Party secretariat members such as Jyoti Basu today informed chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and industries minister Nirupam Sen that there should be a consensus on the projects among all the front partners. 

 The meeting decided that the detailed proposals would be taken up with the RSP, Forward Bloc and the CPI.

 The CPM brass also sensed trouble in the party with land and land reforms min-ister Abdur Rezzak Mollah warning of a food crisis if farmland continued to be acquired at the present rate.

 In the Assembly today, Mollah announced the governments intention to acquire 43,180 acres this year for 11 major industry and infrastructure projects (see box) ? about 5,000 acres more than what the chief minister had earlier said.

 Land department officials said the amount would exceed 50,000 acres in the near future as the list of projects is incomplete and the estimates of land requirement for some projects have been increased substantially. 

 The Tatas small-car project at Singur, for example, would come up on 1,250 acres and not 1,000 acres as thought earlier.

 The Salim Group has offered to build a 100-km Barasat-Raichak expressway and a 2-km bridge from Raichak to Kukrahati and develop a special economic zone at Haldia. In return, the government is to give the company 5,000 acres for a township in Baruipur and space for knowledge and health cities in North 24-Parganas and 10 commercial complexes along the road.

 State CPM secretary Biman Bose and Basu hinted that the party had advised the government not to enter into a deal with the Salims in haste and rather bargain harder.

 The industries minister, also a secretariat member, briefed the leadership about the Salim proposals submi-tted to the government on Wednesday. 

 Everything has to be clear 

 to all concerned. The Salim Group projects are under the 

 scanner because we want to ensure more cushions for land-losers 

 and the local economy. I cant say yet whether the 

 party has given a final approval to them or not, 

 Bose said after the meeting.

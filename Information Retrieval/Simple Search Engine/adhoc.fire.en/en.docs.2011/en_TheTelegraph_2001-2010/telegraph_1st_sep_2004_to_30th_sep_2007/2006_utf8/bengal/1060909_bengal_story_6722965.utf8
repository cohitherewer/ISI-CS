The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 SC rap on abbatoirs

 New Delhi, Sept. 8: The Supreme Court today threatened to close down slaughterhouses in Bengal if the state government failed to convince it that they were adhering to environment norms.

 A bench headed by Chief Justice Y.K. Sabharwal said the state had failed to give details on steps taken to monitor pollution from slaughterhouses and directed the Calcutta Municipal Corporation and the pollution control board to file affidavits within four weeks saying what they had done in this regard.

 If you are monitoring, tell us about the steps taken. If you do not know the number of slaughterhouses, what are you monitoring? the court asked the government counsel.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Kanti vetoes US training for teachers

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Scary? 

 Calcutta, March 7: Wary 

 that imperialist America will corrupt Bengals 

 schoolteachers, the government has prevented some of them 

 from travelling to the US for a training programme.

 Two US-based NGOs had proposed the six-week training for English teachers during which participants had to spend three weeks with American families to know their culture better. 

 That was too much for the Left government to bear.

 The country (US) has no business to force our teachers to learn their culture. We are not going to allow a single teacher working in government-recognised institutions to accept the offer, school education minister Kanti Biswas said. 

 The US education and culture department funds the NGOs ? Relief International and Schools Online ? Biswas said. And he is convinced that there is more to the scheme of luring Indian teachers to visit the country than meets the eye.

 However, its primary objective, the minister admitted, was to improve English teaching skills of those who work in institutions where the subject is taught as a second language. 

 Thirty teachers from Bengal, Bihar and Orissa were to be selected for the training. But the Bengal government today sent a circular to schools saying no teacher is to be allowed to attend the training. 

 An inquiry has been ordered into how the teachers were allowed to respond to the NGOs offer without the governments consent. 

 The NGOs have comple-ted the first round of screening and the process came to the governments knowledge when the selected teachers sought official permission to go to the US.

 Teachers from 39 countries where English is taught as a second language will attend the training provided by Hamline University in Minnesota.

 The Left government had abolished English from primary schools in the early 1980s but reintroduced it in 2004 following increasing pressure from guardians and academics, including some who were close to the CPM.

 Biswas said: We do not need the help of US experts to improve our English teaching skills.

 An education official admitted that there was a need for English teachers in state schools to improve their skills, but added: The only foreign agency that has the expertise is British Council.

 The government is not averse to American moneybags coming to Bengal or a Kentucky Fried Chicken opening shop in Calcutta. But when it comes to culture, import is a no-no ? never mind the jeans and T-shirt, Microsoft or IBM.

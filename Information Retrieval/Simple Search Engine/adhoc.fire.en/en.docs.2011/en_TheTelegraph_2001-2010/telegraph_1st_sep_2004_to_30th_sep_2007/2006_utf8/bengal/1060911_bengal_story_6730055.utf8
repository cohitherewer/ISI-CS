 Police said the girl ran back to her mother crying and bleeding. When her mother raised an alarm, a crowd stormed Dasaraths house and thrashed him. 

 Officers from the local police station then arrived and arrested him. The girl has been admitted to Serampore Walsh Hospital.

Speaking at the district conference of the West Bengal College and University Teachers in Ranigunj, Raychoudhuri said many colleges are not able to improve their standard of education because of lack of funds.

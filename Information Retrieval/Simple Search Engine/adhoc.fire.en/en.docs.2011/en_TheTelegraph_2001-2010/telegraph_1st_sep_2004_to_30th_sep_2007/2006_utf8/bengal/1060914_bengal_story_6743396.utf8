The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Dog bears pups, cop bears brunt

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 13: The increments of a central force cons- table have been frozen and his salary has been snipped because a bitch he was in charge of mated with a stray dog and delivered 10 pups.

 Sunil Kumar, a Central Industrial Security Force jawan posted at Durgapur Steel Plant, moved Calcutta High Court today against his bosses, who saw his dereliction of duty in Labrador Mastas misdemeanour.

 In his petition, Kumar has said that around 6.30 am on November 20, 2004, he took the bitch outside the steel plant premises for a stroll and let it roam free like any other day. Masta allegedly sneaked into a bush and Kumar, who went looking for her after some time, saw her mating.

 On January 29, 2005, Masta delivered 10 pups mixed with 60 per cent Labrador. On February 18, the disciplinary unit of the CISF issued a notice to me to explain why I had not performed my duty pro-perly and allowed Masta to mate with a street dog, Kumar said in the petition. 

 In reply to the showcause, Kumar said: Biological phenomenon relating to sexual urge of the dog was responsible for the incident.... When an animal experiences the urge to mate, it does not pay heed to its trainer.

 The authorities were not convinced. Kumar said: They have scrapped my last three years increment and reduced my basic salary from Rs 3,540 to Rs 3,295. I have also been barred from increments for another three years, beginning this August.

 The constable has sought an order from the court directing the CISF authorities to withdraw the penalty.

 Kumar claimed that the force auctioned the 10 pups and earned Rs 23,050 from them. Masta is still on night patrol at the steel plant, about 220 km from Calcutta.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Assembly vandals pay frozen

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Dec. 4: Twenty-one Trinamul Congress MLAs involved in Thursdays vandalism in the Assembly will not be allowed to draw their salaries and allowances until the Speaker receives a PWD report on the extent of damage to property that they have caused.

 Till the PWD makes an assessment of the damage, the 21 MLAs will not get salaries and allowances, Speaker Hashim Abdul Halim said.

 Trinamul MLAs had smashed tables, broken chairs and yanked off microphones in protest against polices refusal to let their leader reach Singur.

 They faced flak as soon as proceedings began this morning. Rabin Mondal of the CPM moved a privilege motion against Mamata Banerjee for creating pandemonium and provoking party members. Government chief whip Syed Mohammed Mosih then moved another motion against the 21. 

 The Trinamul members demanded that they be allowed to reply to the charges against them. Halim rejected the plea. Both motions were referred to the privilege committee. 

 Most of our members were not in the House when the motion was moved today. This is in violation of parliamentary tradition, said Trinamuls Partha Chatterjee. He added that the House had no jurisdiction to accept a privilege motion against Mamata as she is a Lok Sabha member. 

 Halim said: The motion against Banerjee may be referred to the Lok Sabha after the privilege committee gives its observations.

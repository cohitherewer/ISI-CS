 Maoists break lull with blast

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Midnapore, May 28: Suspected Maoists blew up a nearly 2,000 sq ft godown used to store kendu leaves in a Bankura village last night.

 The guerrillas, police said, used landmines to blow up a portion of the storehouse in which 4,000 bags of the dried leaves, used to bind bidi, were stacked and they caught fire. 

 The godown was gutted by the time the fire brigade arrived at Mathgoda village in Raipur, about 250 km from Calcutta, early this morning. 

 The blast, around 11 last night, was heard from far off villages and panic gripped the residents. This was the first guerrilla attack since the Assembly polls.

 The police found a large number of Maoist posters from the area around the go-down. They demanded an immediate hike in the purchase price of kendu leaves and also asked why the CPMs Susanta Ghosh had been made the minister for the development of paschimanchal (west zone).

 Several aspects of the strike have led us to believe that it was the Maoistss handiwork. The kendu price hike is a long-standing CPI (Maoist) demand. The use of landmines, too, smacks of their hand. Moreover, Ghosh is on their hit list, a police officer said.

 Additional superintendent of police D.S. Rudra said the explosives were dropped into the godowns through gaps in the rolling shutter. 

 We have also found electrical wires that suggest the explosives were detonated from a distance.

 The impoverished villagers of Maoist-hit Bankura, Purulia and West Midnapore sell kendu leaves and make ropes from babui grass for a living. They get about Rs 30 for every 1,000 kendu leaves.

 The godown blown up belonged to the Mathgoda branch of the government controlled Large-scale Multipurpose Co-operative Society. 

 There were kendu leaves worth about Rs 20 lakh in the godown collected over the past two years. We have suffered a huge loss. The godown will have to be rebuilt if we are to use it again, said Kanta Tudu, the vice-chairman of the co-operative branch.

 The co-operative society had been set up by the government to protect poor tribals from exploitative traders and middlemen. 

 The entire neighbourhood shook with the explosion. We thought dacoits had raided the village. When we looked out of our windows, we saw flames leaping out of the godown, said Bijoy Modak, a Mathgoda resident.

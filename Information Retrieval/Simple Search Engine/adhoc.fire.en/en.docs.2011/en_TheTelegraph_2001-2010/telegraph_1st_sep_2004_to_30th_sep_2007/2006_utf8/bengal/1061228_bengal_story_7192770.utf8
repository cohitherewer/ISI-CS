 Maoists in net

 OUR BUREAU

 Krishnagar/Calcutta, Dec. 27: Two suspected Maoists were arrested from Nadia district today during a joint raid by the criminal investigation department (CID) and police.

 Two double-barrel guns and 18 rounds of cartridges were seized from their hideout in Noapara village, about 120 km from Calcutta.

 Shahajaman Sheikh and Asgar Sheikh are wanted in several murder cases in Nadia and Murshidabad districts. 

 We arrested them from a house in Noapara, a remote village known to be a Maoist stronghold. We are sure they have links with local Maoists, said a CID official.

 Nadia police said they had earlier been hiding in other Maoist dens in the district like Nakashipara, Chapra Bhimpur and Khamarpara.

 A week ago, the CID had received a tip-off about Shahajaman and Asgar both are in their mid-30s from residents of Noapara. 

 Around 4 this morning, a team of officers from the CID and the district police cordoned off the house and some of them stormed in. The two were sleeping. We rounded them up, giving them no room to escape, said an officer.

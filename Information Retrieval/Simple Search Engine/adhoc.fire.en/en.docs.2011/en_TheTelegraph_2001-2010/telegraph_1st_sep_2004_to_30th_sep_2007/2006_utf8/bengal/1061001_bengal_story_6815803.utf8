The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Blood on road on Ashtami

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Sept. 30: The 

 rush to beat the weather gods and rain-drenched roads took 

 their toll of pandal-hoppers as vehicles skidded off streets 

 or collided, leaving three dead and six seriously injured. 

 Around 2 am on Saturday, Debrabrata Dutta, a Baguiati resident, was unable to control his motorcycle, which skidded on EM Bypass.

 Both Dutta, 23, and Partha Laskar, 32, a resident of Jadavpur who was riding pillion, were hit on the head and died in hospital. Neither was wearing a helmet.

 Police said Dutta was speeding between Parama Island and Ruby Hospital. 

 Three hours later, Biju Singha Roy, 30, was killed after the scooter he was travelling on crashed into a Maruti van on VIP Road near Lake Town. 

 His friend Partha Bhowmik was riding the two-wheeler on the way back home after pandal-hopping. Near the VIP Road-Bangur Avenue intersection, Partha lost control of his vehicle and came in front of the van. 

 The scooter hit the wrong side of the Maruti van, which suggests that its rider was not in any position to control the vehicle. As the van was travelling at break-neck speed, the accident couldnt be avoided, a Lake Town police station officer said. 

 The police seized the vehicle but the driver fled. Bhowmik is still struggling for his life at Dum Dum Municipal Hospital, where Singha Roy succumbed to his injuries. 

 Around 4 in the afternoon, four persons, including a seven-year-old boy and his mother, were seriously injured by a private bus rushing down Durgapur Bridge near Ultadanga. 

 Police said the bus, which went out of control, hit three cars before hitting the group which was crossing the road.

 Sixty-year-old Govordhan Sharma was hit by a taxi carrying Puja revellers on Strand Road around 7.45 in the evening. He was taken to Medical College and Hospital.

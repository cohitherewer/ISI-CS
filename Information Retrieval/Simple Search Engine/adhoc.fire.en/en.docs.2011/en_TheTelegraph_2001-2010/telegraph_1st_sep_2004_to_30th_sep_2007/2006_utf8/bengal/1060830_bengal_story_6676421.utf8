The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Lalus prize to courtiers

 Bolpur, Aug. 29: Lalu Prasad went around Santiniketan today and so impressed was he with some Visva-Bharati artists and railway singers who performed for him, that he announced Rs 150,000 from the railway purse.

 Jo log gana gaya, unko pachaas hazar de do, aur jo woh falak banaya, unko ek lakh (Give Rs 50,000 to those who sang and Rs 1 lakh to those who built the column), the railway minister said. 

 The column, in memory of two freedom fighters who fell to British bullets here on this day in 1942, was built by Kala Bhavan principal Prabir Biswas and his team. The railway chorus sang Tagore songs for Mr and Mrs Lalu Prasad.

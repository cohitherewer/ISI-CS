The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Fire services fairer

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 17: Women in Bengal have a fresh career option ? firefighting.

 The fire services department is looking for young, energetic women ? between 18 and 27, fairly tall, athletic and with at least high school education.

 Preference will be given to those with sports or NCC backgrounds.

 About 35 of them will be hired soon and trained in special rescue operations.

 But one of the reasons fire services minister Pratim Chatterjee gave for the recruitment is hilarious, although very real. There have been instances when women trapped in buildings have refused to be rescued by men. Dont touch me, Id rather die in the fire, they have said.

 But, will the female fire personnel rescue only women?

 Not necessarily. They will also carry out essential fire fighting, the minister said.

 Department officials claimed that Bengal would be the first state to hire women as fire fighters.

 A fireman corroborated what Chatterjee said: Women are loath to be touched when theyre being rescued. Even in life and death cases, they keep saying dont hold my hand or dont touch me.

 Police officers will be consulted during the recruitment to ensure that the fittest women are in the fray. 

 The fire services department is also introducing Agni Sourjya Padak for firemen who have shown exceptional courage on duty.

 This year, the first prize of Rs 20,000 will be awarded to Krishnendu Kundal and Balaram Naskar, who saved two elderly women from the YMCA building in Firpos market that was gutted.

 The department is planning to procure 10 fire-retardant suits for its personnel at a cost of about Rs 4.5 lakh each. The minister said global tenders will soon be floated for the first lot.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Faces and facts behind the high figure

 Calcutta, April 27: Till the crunch of the boots passed by her home this morning, all that was ringing in Jaheera Bibis ears was the sound of the two explosions at her doorstep in 2001.

 Once the paramilitary squad marched through the neighbourhood in Taltala, Jaheera had made up her mind: she would cast her vote. Unlike last time, I was not scared today. We reached the booth in a group without coming across any partymen on the way, Jaheera said later and added: Everything was smooth.

 So smooth in some seats that thousands of Jaheeras today unknowingly became part of a silent multitude that pushed the turnout in Cal- cutta to 65 per cent. Compare that to the figure in 2001: 55.78 per cent.

 A turnout of 65 per cent may not look striking again- st the 75-plus tally in the Mid- napores but Indias metros have always been somewhat reluctant in participating in elections, largely because of the fear of the possibility of violence. 

 One reason that has brought out the voters this time seems to be what Ananta Dey, a voter in Shyampukur, describes as the enabling environment. 

 The enabling environment meant different things to different people, but mostly it revolved around the absence of intimidation and a congenial atmosphere.

 In the last 35 years, I have never seen such an election. The presence of paramilitary forces encouraged us to come out. Even the women of our house voted after a long time, said Iftikar Ali.

 Others like Umesh Adhikary of Chetla displayed faith in the system built by the Election Commission. Adhikary waited for over 40 minutes in the blazing sun while officials tinkered with a voting machine that packed up.

 I did not mind standing in the queue because I knew that at the end I would be able to cast my ballot. On the last occasion, I could not vote though I reached the booth, the 56- year-old said.

 But in absolute terms, the number of voters has not gone up in Calcutta if the final percentage does hover around 65. 

 Between 2001 and now, the electorate in Calcutta has gone down to 24,33,862 from 34,84,784. Deletion of names when the voters list was cleaned up and population mo- vement towards suburbs could be the reasons behind the sharp fall.

 When the turnout percentages are converted into absolute figures, the number of people who voted today totals 15,82,010 against 19,43,812 of 2001. 

 In fact, the Lok Sabha el- ection of 2004 clocked a high-er turnout. At 67.43 per cent, 20,15,902 people voted in the city then.

 The statistical blizzard has left the political parties grappling with calculators, trying to figure out which formation stands to gain.

 It is possible we (the Left Front) will get about 44 seats (of a total 76 in three districts), Left Front chairman and CPM politburo member Biman Bose said. Many genuine voters could not cast their ballots. They went to the booths only to find that their names have been deleted. 

 But the Opposition thinks otherwise. 

 The high turnout means that this time genuine voters have cast the ballot. They are not going to vote for the party because of which they could not vote, which is the CPM. So we are going to be the benefactor, a Congress leader said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Hunt for kangaroo court killers

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Sept. 5: A day after a cow thief was lynched following a trial by village elders in Nadias Gopalpur, police arrested five people and said they were looking for more.

 Twenty-two-year-old Safikul Mahaldar was caught outside a cattle shed on Monday midnight. 

 Yesterday, some 20 people pounced on him after the kangaroo court sentenced him to death in a shalishi meeting. They beat and hacked Safikul to death with sticks and scythes at Gopalpur in Hogolberia, 200 km from Calcutta. 

 Around 100 people saw the murder being committed, screaming abuses at the condemned man. The body was later dumped in a paddy field. 

 Those in custody include farmer Kuram Biswas from whose shed Safikul was found sneaking out with a cow. 

 The trial was held in Kurams house. He instigated other villagers to kill Safikul, Tehatta subdivisional police officer Asoke Roy said. 

 Those who passed the judgment and those who lynched Safikul have fled. We are looking for them, an officer said. Those arrested were detained yesterday.

 Safikuls brother Sheikh Majid, a resident of neighbouring Harekrishnapur, lodged a complaint at the Hogolberia police station today demanding the murderers arrest.

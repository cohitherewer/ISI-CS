 Jewellery heist

 Calcutta, June 17: A gang of five from Allahabad came to a jewellery shop in Posta last night posing as businessmen, and took away a gold chain worth Rs 2.5 lakh, says a staff reporter.

 Police said the five ? all are in their early 30s ? arrived at the shop in central Calcutta in a Tata Safari around 7 pm. They selected the gold chain but told the shopkeeper that they did not have enough money. 

 They said they would bring the cash from their Alipore home. When they left, the shopkeeper realised the chain was missing.

 Officers from Posta police station tracked down the Tata Safari parked on the approach to Howrah Bridge and arrested Mohammed Sheikh and Rajendra Prasad, who were sitting in the car and drinking beer. But the whereabouts of the rest of the gang members are unknown, an officer said.

 Chickens die but no flu: Officials

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Barasat, Feb. 26: Around 1,000 chickens have died in a village in North 24-Parganas over the past 10 days but officials ruled out bird flu.

 Over 50 chickens died today, too, sparking some amount of concern and prompting a few to leave the village.

 But the animal resources development department said the birds had died in Basirhats Noda village, around 65 km from Calcutta, of a viral infection called Gumbaro.

 Our team brought back three dead birds for tests at the Regional Disease and Diagnostic Lab in Belgachia. After conducting post-mortem on one of them, it was confirmed beyond doubt that the infection was Gumbaro, said Jawahar Lal Chakrabarty, the additional director of the Animal Resources Development department.

 The infection was detected among a few birds of the same poultry farm a few weeks ago and we had asked the owner to take precautions. It appears that the owner had not taken adequate steps to fight the infection, he said.

 Coupled with the infection, the birds also suffered from asphyxia after a chemical was sprayed as a preventive step.

 A team of officials had visited the village and found that the poultry farm owner had been stuffing the dead birds inside jute bags and keeping them in the backyard.

 Preliminary investigations revealed that the farm owner had bought the chicks from the agent of a Pune-based poultry farm in Kharagpur.

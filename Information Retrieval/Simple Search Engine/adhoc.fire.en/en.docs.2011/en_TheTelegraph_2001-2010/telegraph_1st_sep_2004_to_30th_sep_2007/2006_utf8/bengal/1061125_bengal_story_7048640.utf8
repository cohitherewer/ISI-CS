 Calcutta, Nov. 24: The British department for international development (DFID) is offering more funds to Bengal for social infrastructure development this year. 

 The UKs trade, investment and foreign affairs minister, Ian McCartney, said: We have told the Bengal chief minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, the government should prioritise the sectors for which they want the funds in the next phase.

 The UK has chosen Bengal as one of four partner states for assistance along with Orissa, Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh. 

 In 2005-06, Bengal had received assistance worth Rs 243 crore. This year, the DFID will provide 35million (Rs 297 crore) for its ongoing health and education programmes.

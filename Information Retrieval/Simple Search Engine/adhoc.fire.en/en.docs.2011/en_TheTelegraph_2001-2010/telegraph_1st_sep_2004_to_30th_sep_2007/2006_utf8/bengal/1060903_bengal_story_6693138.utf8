 JU impasse ends, result by Tuesday

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 2: Jadavpur Universitys engineering students ended a 16-hour siege to the vice-chancellors office this morning after the authorities agreed to publish their results by Tuesday and consider a couple of other demands. 

 Members of the Faculty of Engineering and Technology Students Union had begun their agitation around 5.30 last evening. Vice-chancellor S.K. Sanyal and 20 teachers were held hostage since then.

 After the students relented at 9.30 today, a varsity official announced: We have decided to declare the results latest by Tuesday. We will go through the present status of the issues raised by the students and a faculty meeting will discuss them at length on Thursday.

 Union representatives said they were happy. We hope the committee will address our problems, said one of them.

 About a month ago, the union had demanded timely results and publication of the names of students who would have to take supplementary tests. It also wanted that the supplementary candidates be allowed to follow the old syllabus. But the authorities did not respond, resulting in the sit-in.

 The existing system does not allow a student who is writing a supplementary paper to go by the old syllabus.

 Weve started classes for the next semester without knowing how we fared in the earlier one. Itd be difficult if we are asked to sit for the exam in the middle of another semester, said Amit Chakraborty, the general secretary of the union.

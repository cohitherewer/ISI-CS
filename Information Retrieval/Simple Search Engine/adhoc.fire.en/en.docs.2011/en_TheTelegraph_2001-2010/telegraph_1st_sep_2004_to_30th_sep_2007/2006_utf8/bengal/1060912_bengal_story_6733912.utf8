The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Miracle man superhit here

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Behrampore, Sept. 11: The man at the centre of controversy at Loreto Convent, Lucknow, has earned quite a reputation as an occultist in at least two Bengal districts. 

 Nobo Kumar Mondol, 40, a resident of Chandra village in Nadias Hanskhali, who used to be a rickshaw-puller earlier, is now the caretaker of the small village church. 

 Mondol and Father Sebastian Kuzhipala, the priest in charge of the Behrampore Catholic Church in Murshidabad district, now form a team that cures diseases with (the) blessing of Jesus Christ in Nadia and neighbouring Murshidabad.

 At Chandra village, about 70 km from Calcutta, the performances are held on Saturdays and many turn up for the magic cure. 

 Before going to Uttar Pradesh with Father Sebastian, Nobo Kumar performed at Behrampore Catholic Church, about 200 km from Calcutta, on September 1. 

 Recounting his experience on that day, Majid Biswas, an employee of the Behrampore church, said Nobo Kumar appeared in a loincloth and stood erect with his arms spread like the crucified Christ as Father Sebastian sat by his side. The patients, who stood in a row and prayed, appeared in front of Nobo Kumar one by one. He whispered something into the ears of a lady who whispered into Father Sebastians ears. The father put his hand on the head of the patients and blessed them before offering holy water and bread, Majid said.

 Nobo Kumar had recently set up a temporary establishment in Lucknow, where he has developed a following.

 Sister Margarita of Kri- shnagar Catholic Church in Nadia said Nobo Kumar was very sick eight years ago. 

 His kidneys were damaged. He knew he would die and started praying to Lord Jesus. One day, the spirit of Jesus appeared before him and he was cured. The Lord told him that anyone who prayed to him through Nobo Kumar would be cured of disease. I could not walk, he cured me. At Chandra, Nobo Kumar and Father Sebastian have cured many, she said.

 However, not all priests agree. Father M.T. Thomas, a colleague of Father Sebastian here, said: I had a bypass surgery and have countless stitches on me. Im alive because of medical science. I have full faith in Jesus Christ, but I believe in curing my diseases with the help of science.

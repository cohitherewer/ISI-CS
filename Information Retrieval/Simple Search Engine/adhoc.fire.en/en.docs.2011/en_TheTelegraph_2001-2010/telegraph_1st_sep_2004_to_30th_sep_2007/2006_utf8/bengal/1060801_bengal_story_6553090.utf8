 Scolded at home, girls drink poison

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, July 31: Two girls aged 10 and 13 committed suicide last evening by consuming poison in Nadia district after being scolded by their guardians.

 Ten-year-old Rupali Ghosh was pulled up by her parents for going to a neighbours house with whom they did not share a cordial relationship. 

 A resident of Keshtopur village in Krishnagunj, 110 km from Calcutta, Rupali went to the neighbours house yesterday morning. The families are locked in a dispute over land. 

 When Rupali, a Class IV student, came home in the afternoon, all hell broke loose. Namita (her mother) could not check herself and scolded her. She also thrashed her and called her a beggar for having food in that house. But my daughter could not take the humiliation, said her father Gopal, a daily labourer. 

 In the evening, she took a bottle of pesticide kept in a corner of the house and went to a deserted paddy field. After gulping it down, Rupali ran back home gasping for breath. She collapsed soon after. Her father and other villagers rushed her to the local health centre, where she died last night.

 At Karimpur, 180 km from Calcutta, Munmun lived at her maternal uncles house with her widowed mother. 

 A Class VII student, Munmun was told to wear glasses, but hated it. She would say it did not fit and that she looked horrible in them. She was the apple of her uncles eye, her mother Aradhana said. 

 After being scolded by her uncle and mother for refusing to wear glasses, she gulped down muriatic acid.

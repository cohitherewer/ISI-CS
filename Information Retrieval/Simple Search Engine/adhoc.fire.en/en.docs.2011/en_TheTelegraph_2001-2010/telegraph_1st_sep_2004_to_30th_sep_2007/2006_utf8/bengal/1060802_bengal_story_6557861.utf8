 Up the garden track 

 ANURADHA SHARMA LAKHOTIA

 Wanted: Flowers

 Siliguri, Aug. 1: Say it with flowers! Thats one of the motifs of Darjeeling Himalayan Railways 125th-year celebrations.

 A drive is afoot to deck the 81-km toy train track with flowers and a competition has been launched to reward the best garden house along the route, from New Jalpaiguri in the plains to Darjeeling in the hills.

 DHR India Support Group, a Siliguri-based organisation working towards popularising the heritage on wheels, has launched the best garden house on the DHR contest.

 We have planned the contest with the basic objective of offering a visual treat to tourists travelling on the toy train, said Vivek Baid, a senior member of the organisation. 

 As it is, people in the hills are fond of gardening and most of them have well-kept gardens, even in their small houses. We want all of them to grow flowers on a larger scale. 

 Residents can also put up flowers on sale. 

 The contest will start this November and end in January. Three houses with the best gardens will get the prize, which is yet to be decided. There will be a special award for those who grow the highest number of hill trees. 

 We have decided to judge the gardens from November to January because most flowering plants are in full bloom during that time, Baid said. 

 But this is the time of the year when saplings should be planted. So, the competition should soon begin in earnest. 

 To ensure a spirited kickoff, the toy train support group will distribute grafts of some plants free of cost.

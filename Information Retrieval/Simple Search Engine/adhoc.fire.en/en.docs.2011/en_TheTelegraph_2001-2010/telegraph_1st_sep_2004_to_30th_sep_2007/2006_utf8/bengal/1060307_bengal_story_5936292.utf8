The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Chopper check on rebel turf

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Poll bound?

 Calcutta, March 6: Helicopters might be pressed into action for surveillance of trouble-torn Purulia, Bankura and West Midnapore in the run-up to the elections and on D-day.

 Alarmed at the recent Maoist strikes, the Election Commission is contemplating the aerial mission to overcome the challenge of ragged terrain often blanketed by thick forests.

 Sources said if used, the helicopters will be under a combined command ? meaning no chopper will be reserved for a particular district. 

 The commissions concern over the increasing violence had found reflection in its decision to club the three districts together and hold the first phase of elections there. 

 It is also going to draw up a detailed plan to ensure safe movement of poll personnel. Chief electoral officer Debasish Sen said: The modalities are being worked out jointly with the police administration of the three districts.

 The government apprehends violence in about half of the 50 constituencies, some 18 of them in Purulia and Bankura. The focus would be on Bandwan, Bagmundi, Jhalda, Arsa and Hura in Purulia, Barikul, Ranibandh, Indus, Khatra and Indpur in Bankura and Belpahari and Binpur in West Midnapore. 

 Sen visited Bankura today and spoke to the district officials on law and order. Sources said he was briefed on the sensitive areas and places that are now Maoist strongholds.

 Dengue claims boy in Bankura

 - Five more cases reported in Calcutta

 OUR BUREAU

 Oct. 10: A six-year-old boy died of dengue in Bankura last night, taking the toll in Bengal to four.

 Ayan Mishra was brought to the Bankura Sammilani Medical College and Hospital from a subdivisional hospital in Purulia on Sunday.

 He had high fever and severe muscular pain. He started vomiting blood yesterday morning and died last night. His blood sample tested positive for dengue, said Susanta Banerjee, the medical college principal.

 Hospital sources said Ayan lived at Maheshpur village in Kenda, Purulia.

 We spoke to his father Pradip Mishra. The child had gone to Durgapur to his ma- ternal uncles house during Puja. He was afflicted with the fever after he returned to Maheshpur. Four days ago, he was admitted to the Purulia hospital. He was probably infected with the virus in Durgapur, said Banerjee.

 After Ayans death, the Bankura medical college has opened a dengue monitoring cell. We have also sought kits to test the dengue virus from the health department, a hospital official said. 

 Five new cases of dengue were identified in Calcutta and Salt Lake today. 

 A 65-year-old woman from Duttabad in Salt Lake was admitted to Calcutta Heart Research Centre in extremely critical condition. 

 A 35-year-old man who lives in the townships SA block was also admitted to the same hospital, as were a 17-year-old boy from Kasba in south Calcutta and a 12-year old boy from Sabang in East Midnapore.

 A five-year-old from Kidderpore was admitted to Woodlands Hospital in Calcutta. He has tested positive for dengue, said Santanu Roy, a paediatrician. 

 The doctor said an 18-month child from Howrah was admitted to BP Poddar Hospital with the disease.

 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation confirmed that a three-year-old girl from Cossipore has tested positive. 

 At North Bengal Medical College and Hospital and several private nursing homes in the region, a large number of fever patients queued up to get themselves tested.

 The results of tests conducted at the medical college so far have been negative. 

 No dengue case has been recorded in the hills yet, but the Darjeeling deputy chief medical officer said a blood sample from Kalimpong has been sent for tests.

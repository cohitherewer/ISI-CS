 Raninagar, Aug. 11: Rakesh Sarkar is extremely intelligent. He outscored all but one in his Class VIII final examination earlier this year, totting up 73 per cent. 

 But the boy stands out from the rest of his peer group not only in his studies the 14-year-old resident of Bardhanpur here in Murshidabad weighs only 9 kg and stands at less than two feet, barely reaching 22 inches.

 His father Abdur Rashid said he was born a healthy child and had a steady growth until his third year. Over the last 11 years, his head has grown but his body has remained the same.

 Doctors have assured Rashid that his son can be cured of his ailment if it is treated in time. But I dont have the means to take him to Calcutta, Rashid said.

 A small farmer, he depends on a three-bigha plot, 240 km from Calcutta, for his livelihood and earns Rs 15,000 annually, which proves insufficient to feed the family of four, leave alone Rakeshs treatment. 

 I had taken my son to a child specialist in Behrampore. The doctor carried out several pathological tests, but there was nothing unusual in the reports. Later, I took him to another doctor who asked me to take him to SSKM Hospital in Calcutta as no treatment was available here, Rashid added.

 Rakesh, who was born in July 1992, never let the physical condition come in his way. I often walk down to my school with my friend Khaled. I also participate in football and cricket matches with my classmates and friends. But of late, I feel pain in my joints if I walk a lot, he said. 

 G.D. Pan, the child specialist in the district town of Behrampore who had conducted the tests on the boy, expressed concern over his condition. I performed all possible pathological tests and came to the conclusion that he is a pituitary dwarf a condition triggered by the lack of growth hormones in the pituitary glands. That is the reason why he looks four years old, though he is 14, he said.

 If he is treated in time, he will have normal growth, the doctor added.

 Hormones have to be injected in his system to revive his growth. But this hormone is not always available in our country. Whatever needs to be done, should be done at the earliest because after 17 or 18, this treatment would be of no use, Pan asserted.

 Rakhaldashpur High School headmaster Sabir Ahmed said: Undoubtedly, Rakesh is the brightest student in our village. He is the best but, during examinations, he takes time to write because of his physical shortcomings. Otherwise he would be way ahead of the rest. 

 In sports, too, he is a trier. We are proud of him.

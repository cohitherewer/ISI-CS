 Exam fee plan for Class XI

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Nov. 14: HS students appearing for their Class XI final exam early next year may have to pay a Rs-100 examination fee.

 Sources in the West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education said the decision to introduce the fee was taken to meet the expenses of conducting the examination, earlier held by the schools. 

 In keeping with the structure followed by other (plus-two) boards across the country, the council has bifurcated the higher secondary course. 

 With the split, the HS examinations will be held only on the syllabus covered in Class XII. In the earlier system, the HS examinations covered the entire syllabus taught in Class XI and XII.

 Officially, the council was tight-lipped on the new fee. The council is still working on the fee issue. We have introduced a number of academic changes in the higher secondary education system this year and we are busy ensuring that the 4,000 schools get the right information from us about the new changes, said Gopa Dutta, its president. 

 The council would send the question papers and answer scripts for the Class XI examinees. The schools will, however, have to get the scripts evaluated and prepare the results, Dutta said. The results will be sent to the council to enable it to maintain a data profile of the schools performance. 

 According to the council chief, important documents for holding the class XI exams will be distributed to the schools from the 33 camp offices of the council across Bengal from November 30.

 HS examinees of 2007 would be awarded grades along with marks and they wont be awarded divisions on the basis of their aggregate. 

 Dutta said the system of assessing students with grades would also apply to those appearing for the Class XI examination in 2007.

 Environmental education has become a compulsory subject from this year. Dutta said the theoretical examination for the subject will have multiple-choice questions.

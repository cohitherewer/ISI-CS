The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Priya hat in Singur ring

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 10: Congress leader Priya Ranjan Das Munshi today said the CPM and chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee should practise in Bengal what they preach in other states.

 You cannot be so double-faced as to oppose industrialisation in other states and promote it in Bengal... such hypocrisy is unbecoming of the CPM. You should have a clear stand, be it industrialisation or FDI, said Das Munshi, who stressed he was speaking as a Congress leader and not a Union minister.

 The Raiganj MP hastened to add that he welcomed the Tatas as investors in Bengal. Tatas are a very prestigious business group. Their endeavour to produce a car worth Rs 1 lakh is a noble one. Our contention is why be adamant on Singur? There are other sites in Bengal where they can set up shop. Why is the state government not shifting the site? he asked, adding that Kharagpur and Sankrail were available.

 The Tatas, though, had rejected a Kharagpur site earlier. 

 Das Munshi said: Never in the history of India has police and brute force been used to hand over an industrial site. My question is, why create such bad blood? Are you going to impose section 144 in perpetuity? How is anybody going to run an industry in such an atmosphere? No party is opposed to the entry of the Tatas but the government should take care of the farmers as well.

 Das Munshis Bengal party colleagues said tonight that his criticism of Bhattacharjee is aimed at rescuing his image, which received a beating after Congress candidate Hamidul Rahaman lost in the Islampur Assembly bypoll on December 4.

 We had decided to back Mamata Banerjees candidate Adbul Karim Chowdhury but Priya, as the MP from Raiganj in north Bengal, influenced the AICC to get his man nominated for the seat. Pushed to a corner after the humiliating defeat, he is desperate to refurbish his image, a senior Congress leader said.

 According to him, Das Munshis sudden turnaround is also meant to undermine the PCCs agitation over Singur.

 A section of the Congress had been protesting against the land acquisition in Singur.

 Asked why he had suddenly woken up to the plight of Singur oustees, the Congress MP claimed that he was one of the first to raise the issue. 

 When the movement started, it was about who the real landholders were. I have been articulating their issues for a long time, he said defensively.

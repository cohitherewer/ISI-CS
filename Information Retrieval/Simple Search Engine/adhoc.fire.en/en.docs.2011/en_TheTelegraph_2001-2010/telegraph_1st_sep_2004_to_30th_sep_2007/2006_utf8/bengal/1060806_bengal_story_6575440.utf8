The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Deaf and mute woman raped

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Aug. 5: Police arrested a 34-year-old man last night for allegedly raping a deaf and mute woman on July 31. 

 The 22-year-old was sitting in a temple close to her house on Tollygunge Circular Road off Kumarpara around 7 in the evening. Her father was away and her mother had gone to a neighbours house. 

 Tinku Dutta, who lives close by, allegedly gestured to her that her mother was calling her. He then took her to a deserted house and raped her, according to the complaint lodged by the girls parents at New Alipore police station. 

 The girl came back home and broke down when her mother wanted to know where she had been so long. She told her she had been raped and even identified Dutta, who makes clay models at Kumarpara.

 Her parents met the officer-in-charge of New Alipore police station last evening and filed a complaint against Dutta. An hour later, officers turned up at his house with an arrest warrant. 

 We have no clue why the girls parents did not lodge the complaint earlier. That would have made matters easier for us, more so as the girl needs a medical check-up. Anyway, the accused has been arrested and we will grill him more for details, said an officer.

 Dutta was produced in court today and has been remanded in police custody till August 17.

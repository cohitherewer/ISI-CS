 Woman teased amp; threatened

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Nov. 21: A newly-wed housewife was teased on a busy north Calcutta road and threatened with dire consequences if she reported the incident by youths who followed her on the way from a wedding on Sunday evening. 

 The incident took place near Ganesh Talkies, off Rabindra Sarani, around the same time as young men on a motorcycle were harassing two Irish tourists on Sudder Street, not very far away. 

 The husband and other family members, who were accompanying the housewife, were beaten up when they protested. Elderly Madan Lal Bagri had to be hospitalised. 

 Pawan Verma and Raj Kumar Sonkar have been arrested. A hunt is on for the others in the gang. They are local youths; we are sure to round them up, said a senior Posta police station officer.

 For the same reason they are local youths the Bagris are scared.

 Around six on Sunday evening they went to attend the family wedding. On the way back, around 9.30 pm, a youth started passing comments at the 22-year-old woman. 

 As she refused to respond, he abused and threatened her. Her husband protested and several youths rushed in. Madan lal was picked out and punches rained on him.

 Although the Irish women have left, the police have arrested one of the youths who harassed them. A search is on for the other.

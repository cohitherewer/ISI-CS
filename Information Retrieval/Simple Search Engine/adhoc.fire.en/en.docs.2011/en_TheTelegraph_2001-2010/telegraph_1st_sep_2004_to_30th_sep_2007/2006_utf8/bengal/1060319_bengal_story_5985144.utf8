The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Questions crowd sons mind

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Ghoshs daughter (top) and son Anindya: 

Baffled 

 Calcutta, March 18: The police may be claiming to have solved the doctor murder case, but there are some questions that his son simply cant crack. 

 Why did it have to be my father, asks Anindya, the son of Jayanta Ghosh who was allegedly abducted and murdered by five first-time criminals. 

 It could be their first brush with crime but they have brushed us the wrong way, the doctors son said. My father did not deserve this after serving the people of Paikpara for 34 long years.

 After Ghoshs body was found in Murshidabad on March 7, the family had spent sleepless nights trying to figure out who could have killed the physician who always extended a helping hand to those who came to him. 

 Anindya, however, did not forget to acknowledge the police departments role in tracking down his fathers assassins. I must thank the city police ? they have done a commendable job by cracking the case so fast. This time, they have risen above the general public opinion of the police being insensitive and inefficient, he said. 

 We sincerely hope that no one will have to go through something like this. It is a horrid experience to lose a near and dear one... in such dreadful circumstances. However, I am concerned about our society in general. I wonder what prompts these men to take up crime, he said.

 I have not seen any photograph of the killers yet but I have heard that one of the five arrested today is a hawker and another, a driver. What could drive them into killing a man, who did no harm but served them for decades? 

 Ghoshs wife Anima is dumbstruck by grief. What can I say? I have lost all that I had. These arrests mean nothing to me, she mumbled.

 For Prasanta, Ghoshs elder brother, the arrests are fine but there is more than meets the eye. 

 The motive just cant be money. If that was so, then the gang would have taken him to a forest or any other place and bargained over the amount. It was a pre-planned act, aimed at murdering him.

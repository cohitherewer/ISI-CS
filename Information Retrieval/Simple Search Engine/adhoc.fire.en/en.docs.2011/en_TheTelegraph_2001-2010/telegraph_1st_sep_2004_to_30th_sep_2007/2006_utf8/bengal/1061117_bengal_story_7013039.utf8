The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Govt gets teeth to acquire land

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 16: The Supreme Court has said that the government has sole and absolute discretion in acquiring land for public purposes.

 Public purpose cannot and should not be precisely defined and its scope and ambit be limited as far as acquisition of land for the public purpose is concerned, Justices Ashok Bhan and Dalveer Bhandari said, upholding the Bengal governments decision to acquire a plot in Calcutta.

 Public purpose changes with time and requirements of the community, they added.

 Although the ruling came on a building taken over more than 60 years ago, acquisition has been an emotive issue in Bengal with the government planning to take possession of thousands of acres for industry and infrastructure projects.

 The building on Pretoria Street has been the office-cum-residence of a deputy commissioner of police since 1943. The 0.24-acre premises have been in the governments possession since that year, when it was requisitioned under the Defence of India Rules. The government issued a notification in December 1994 saying it was acquiring the land after the high court quashed the requisition order and directed it to hand over the possession.

 Daulat Singh Surana, who claimed to have purchased the land in 1982, said the land could not have been validly acquired as the government had retained possession illegally. 

 But the apex court today ruled that the government could compulsorily acquire private land for public purposes.

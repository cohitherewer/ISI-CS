 Raped amp; married off, teen commits suicide

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, March 28: A girl who was raped by her classmates ? one of whom she loved ? a year ago and then secretly married off by her parents to a man thrice her age, committed suicide last night.

 Fifteen-year-old Sushmita Roy was found writhing in pain outside her house at a village in Nadias Murutia, some 200 km from Calcutta. 

 Before consuming pesticide, she apparently met one of the alleged rapists on her way to a friends place. Sadhan Kirtonia is out on bail.

 On a visit to her parents, Sushmita had left home around 6.30 pm, saying she was going to see a friend.

 Around midnight, a doctor at Karimpur hospital declared her dead.

 Sushmita used to love Sadhan, but he allegedly raped her with three others, an officer of the Murutia police station said. 

 Unable to face the social stigma on their daughter, Sushmitas parents married her off last month to a 45-year-old Siliguri-based trader, Santosh Mondal. Yesterday, Sushmita came home for the first time since marriage.

 It is apparent that marriage did not bring peace to her life, Nadia superintendent of police R. Rajsekharan said. 

 Bhabani Roy, a small farmer, admitted that his daughter, who was in Class VIII, was married off against her wish. What else could I do? he asked. Life was becoming miserable.... She could not walk freely in the village anymore. We had to send her to a far off place, where no one would raise questions about her character, Bhabani added, breaking down. 

 One evening in February last year, Sushmita was gagged and taken to a paddy field allegedly by Sadhan, Bula Tikadar, Pabitra Das and Harshajit Bala, all students of Class VIII in the same Goalia School, when she was returning home after class. 

 Two hours later, they left her writhing in pain in the field. Sushmita returned home at night. Bhabani lodged a police complaint the next day. All four boys were arrested. But for Sadhan, all of them are now in jail and awaiting trial. 

 The Tehatta subdivisional court granted bail to Sadhan after his lawyer claimed in court that he was not present at the scene of the rape.

 The Murutia officer said: Local people said they had seen Sushmita talking to Sa-dhan on the road yesterday. They also saw Sadhan apologising to her for the incident. We will question the boy again regarding the suicide.

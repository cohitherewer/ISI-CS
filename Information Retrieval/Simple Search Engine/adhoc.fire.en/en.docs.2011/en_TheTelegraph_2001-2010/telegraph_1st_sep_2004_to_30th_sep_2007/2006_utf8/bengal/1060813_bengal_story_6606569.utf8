 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, Aug. 12 : Trinamul Congress MLA Sadhan Pande, today refused to resign as chairman of the Assembly standing committee on labour, defying Mamata Banerjees diktat.

 But three other Trinamul legislators Dinesh Bajaj, Sital Sarder and Partha Chatterjee quit three House panels following the party line. Pande said he was not informed of his appointment as chairman of the standing committee either by the Speaker or by party leader Partha Chatterjee. So, the question of sending my resignation does not arise, he said. 

 Calcutta: Police in Maheshtala, South 24-Parganas, have started a probe on the disappearance of 13-year-old Sushanta Samanta from the southern fringes of the city last Wednesday. On Saturday, the boys father lodged a complaint saying the Class VIII student disappeared after he left school for home.

 Burdwan: The body of Santanu Sahu, 28, was found on Saturday morning from a pond in Kalna, about 100 km from Calcutta. Police sources said miscreants killed Santanu on Friday night. Two persons have been arrested.

 Barasat: Two persons were killed and six injured when an ambulance rammed into an oil tanker near Barasat on Sunday. Police said Bimal, a police constable from Birbhum, was heading to the Medical College hospital with his ailing brother in the ambulance. Ambulance driver Pradip died on the spot. Bimal died in RG Kar Medical College.

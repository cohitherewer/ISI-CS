 Metro tightens safety belt

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 On guard 

 Calcutta, Aug. 12: The security ring around Metro Rail is being tightened with more personnel from police and the Railway Police Force.

 The home ministry has put Calcuttas Metro stations on the list of suspected soft targets on Independence Day.

 The personnel, who were put through a short training session, have been deployed at all Metro stations from today to lend a hand to the short-staffed Metro Railway Police (MRP).

 They will form the second security ring after the first comprising MRP personnel.

 Metro Rail is one of the obvious areas of concern and weve worked out strategies to make up for the shortage of staff as well as ways to take on any threat. We cant discuss everything in detail but we have initiated certain steps that are aimed at beefing up the security at different vital installations, said Subrata Narayan Sarkar, the acting city police commissioner.

 Apart from manning the entrances and the exits, the security team will, along with sniffer dogs, frisk people carrying objects that are not transparent. 

 The new team has been briefed and trained so that it can evaluate the threat perception at any given point of time, said Sudhir Mishra, the joint commissioner of police. 

 Mishra added that the RPF and police personnel would not be withdrawn immediately after August 15. 

 However, some MRP personnel pointed out that the security system at stations is still not up to the mark to combat terror threats. Just hand-held metal detectors or even door-frames are not enough to scan if someone is carrying explosives. For that, you need vapour detectors that we do not have, said a policeman at Dum Dum Metro station.

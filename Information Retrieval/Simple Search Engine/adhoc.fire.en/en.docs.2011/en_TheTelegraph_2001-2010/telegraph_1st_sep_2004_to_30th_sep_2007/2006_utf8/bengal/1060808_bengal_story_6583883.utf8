The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Japanese lose out to Salim

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 7: The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government is set to call off its agreement with Japanese consultant Jaica for a feasibility study of the proposed Raichak-Kukrahati bridge.

 The government decided to drop the Japanese study after it entered into an agreement with the Salim Group, which has offered to build the bridge at the companys own cost.

 Chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb will meet officials from Jaica on August 11 and tell them that the government does not need the Rs 2-crore technical loan assistance that the Japan Bank for International Co-operation (JBIC) had sanctioned for the feasibility study.

 A feasibility study by the Japanese is not required since the Salim Group will employ its own consultants for the job. Jaica was slated to table the study report by September 2007. Work on the project would have begun only after that. But the Salim Group wants to start the work before, a senior government official said.

 The Japanese consultant was reportedly peeved since it had already started work on the study three months ago.

 Public works department minister Kshiti Goswami had expressed apprehensions that the Japanese might take offence at the study being called off.

 According to Goswami, Jaica took up the study in the hope of bagging the bridge construction project. 

 The minister feared that the refusal might have a negative fallout on projects under consideration by the JBIC.

 But government officials said they are confident that the Japanese collaboration is here to stay. 

 The Japanese have been our biggest collaborators. From all major power projects to transport infrastructure be it flyovers or tram track repairs weve carried out many projects with financial assistance from the Japanese. We will need their assistance for the sixth phase of Bakreswar power project also. There will be many other projects where we will need their expertise, an official said.

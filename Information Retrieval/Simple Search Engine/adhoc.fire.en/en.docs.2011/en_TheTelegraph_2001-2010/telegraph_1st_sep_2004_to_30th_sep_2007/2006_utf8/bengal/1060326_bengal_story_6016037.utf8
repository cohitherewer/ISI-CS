 Doctors thrashed for patient death

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Durgapur, March 25: A mob beat up two doctors after a patient died at a nursing home in Durgapur last night.

 Satyabrata Deb, a 35-year-old contractor, was admitted to the nursing home after an accident. He was taken to the operation theatre for an amputation around 10.30 last night but was declared dead after an hour. The nursing home authorities said Deb died because of cardiac failure.

 As the news spread, Debs relatives and some local residents went on the rampage at the nursing home, about 200 km from Calcutta. They beat up anaesthetist H.M. Singh and Bappa Dutta, one of the co-owners of the nursing home. Singh sustained serious injuries on the head and was admitted to Durgapur Projects Limited Hospital, where he is the chief medical officer.

 Today, he was arrested on the charge of attending to Deb allegedly in a drunken state. Durgapur additional superintendent of police Anand Kumar said: We took Singh into custody on the basis of a complaint from the deceaseds brother, Subrata, who accused the doctor of attending to the patient in a drunken state. We have shifted him to the local subdivisional hospital for a medical test.

 The president of the Indian Medical Associations Durgapur unit, A.F. Azizur Rahman, alleged that the doctors were roughed up in the presence of policemen who did not come to their rescue.

 He also alleged that the police flouted a Supreme Courts order by taking Singh into custody. A doctor cannot be arrested on the charge of negligence unless a medical board suggests so. We have called a ceasework on Wednesday as a mark of protest, he said.

 Denying the charge, Kumar said: We are aware of the Supreme Courts order and did not arrest Singh on the charge of medical negligence.

 The Indian Medical Association also submitted a memorandum to subdivisional officer Balaram De, complaining against the police and demanding the arrest of those involved in the attack.

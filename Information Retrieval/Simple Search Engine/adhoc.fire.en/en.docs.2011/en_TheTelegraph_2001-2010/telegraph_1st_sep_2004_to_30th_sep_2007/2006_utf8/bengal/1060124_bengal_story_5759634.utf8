The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Train seat mafia in VIP misfire

 OUR BUREAU

 Jan. 23: Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjees daughter and son-in-law were among passengers heckled and abused on a Howrah-bound train this morning by daily travellers who wanted them to vacate reserved seats.

 Around 8.30 am, Anushila Basu (file picture on right) and her husband Debiprasad boarded the S-3 coach of Intercity Express at Bolpur, 175 km from Calcutta, along with members of a cultural troupe ? Kalabhrit ? she runs. The troupe had performed in Bolpur yesterday.

 We had reservations, but found all our seats occupied. When we asked them to let us sit, they hurled abuse and told us that they would not budge, Anushila said.

 The couple tried to reason with the daily passengers, but it fell on deaf ears. Most of the encroachers had monthly tickets for local trains.

 Chatterjee, the MP from Bolpur, said: Strong action should be taken against the seat mafia.

 Told to do whatever you like, Anushila called up her father from the train. 

 Chatterjee got in touch with the civic chief of Guskara, where the train was supposed to stop next. Municipality chairman Binod Chowdhury called the GRP. 

 Around 9 am, when the train halted at Guskara, 135 km from Calcutta, several CPM leaders and GRP personnel stormed the coach. Taken aback, the troublemakers withdrew and apologised.

 Anushila did not lodge a police complaint.

 Many other passengers present in the coach said such behaviour from daily passengers was common.

 GRP officer-in-charge of Burdwan Tapas Das said no such complaint has been lodged since he joined two months ago.

 The elections in Kolkata are on Thursday. Ive been told to stay close to home in case there are any skirmishes. The police and army are out in full force and it really should be quite safe, but everyone offers advice to the foreigner and takes care of me.

 The communists are ruling in West Bengal, have been for many years and fully anticipate to get in again. Kolkata was very advanced and one of the best cities when they first got into power, but it went down hill for a time, large corporations pulling out etc but in the past few years, they have been drawn back in, malls have been built and everyone is pretty happy with them

 I have long been a revolutionary 

 tourist. Years spent in Kolkata where the Communist Party 

 of India Marxist (CPI-M) has been the ruling ? democratically 

 elected ? party for over twenty years. There even the Opposition 

 parties are mostly communists, though sometimes this has 

 led to fratricidal conflicts as comrade kills comrade. I 

 was out on the streets souveniring red flags and photographing 

 political wall slogans, emonstrations and million-person 

 rallies. 

 The wall slogans have been banned 

 in West Bengals present election ? a blow to political 

 expression most agree, but Kolkata is still the city of 

 politics. Its an easy place to travel, despite the 

 reputation it has abroad, as a site of Mother Teresa-enhanced, 

 reputation distorting, photogenic poverty... But despite 

 what everyone usually hears of Kolkata in global media, 

 when it appears as news it is either as curio or as another 

 kind of politics, as sight of impoverishment or as the 

 longest freely elected communist democracy, none of 

 the representations seem to measure up to the reality

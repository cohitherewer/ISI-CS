 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, Feb. 18: Over a week after the approach road to Bombay Road caved in, a member of the probe panel and an officer of the National Highway Authority of India visited the spot at Bally to supervise soil-testing operations.

 Calcutta: Junior doctors of SSKM and Medical College and Hospital called off their two-day-old ceasework on Saturday evening. The doctors demanding a 100 per cent hike in stipend relented after the government granted a 30 per cent raise and promised to look into a further increase.

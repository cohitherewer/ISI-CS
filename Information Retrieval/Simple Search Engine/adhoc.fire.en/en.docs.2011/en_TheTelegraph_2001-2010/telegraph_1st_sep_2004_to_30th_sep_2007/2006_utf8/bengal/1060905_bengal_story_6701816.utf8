The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, Sept. 4: Transport minister Subhas Chakraborty today took potshots at his party for inviting foreign investment and attacking imperialism in the same breath. 

 Lenin taught us that imperialism is the export of capital. Communists fight imperialists.... Now the same capital is being invited here.... A lot of things are not clear to me, the CPM leader told a CPI programme.

 Calcutta: The Defence Research and Development Organisation has signed an agreement with Calcutta University to set up a radio research laboratory. It will come up at Nayabandh in Jadavpur. 

 Calcutta: The Left Front is meeting on Tuesday to chalk out its strategy in the wake of a pact between the Congress and the Trinamul Congress for the September 16 bypolls. Mamata Banerjee is backing the Congress in Malda and Katwa. The favour is being returned in Bongaon.

 Barasat: The parents of a local CPM leader, Govinda Ganguly, have been arrested on charges of torturing his wife. At their home in Agarpara, 20 km north of Calcutta, they allegedly poured hot water on her on Sunday.

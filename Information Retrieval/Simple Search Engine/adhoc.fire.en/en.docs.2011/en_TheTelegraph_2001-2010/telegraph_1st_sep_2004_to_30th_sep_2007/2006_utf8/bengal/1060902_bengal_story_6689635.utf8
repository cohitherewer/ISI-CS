The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Jawan arrested

 Midnapore, Sept. 1: Central Industrial Security Force jawan R. Rai was arrested today for gunning down two civilians at Haldia market last evening following a scuffle with some local toughs.

 Plainclothes CISF personnel picked a quarrel with the hoodlums while shopping at the bazaar, 130 km from Calcutta. As the goons mobbed constable N.J. Saha, his colleagues called the CISF control-room in the Haldia dock and some 20 others came rushing. 

 One of them, Rai, opened fire inside the market, teeming with Puja shoppers.

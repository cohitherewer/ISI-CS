 Christians seek church fatwa on vote

 MITA MUKHERJEE AND RABI BANERJEE

 Calcutta/Krishnagar, April 14: Christians, who have traditionally voted Left, are giving the CPM a wrinkle or two.

 From the Darjeeling hills to Sunderbans, the community is getting together to press for the withdrawal of the West Bengal School Service Commission (Amendment) Bill, 2006, which makes it mandatory for state-aided minority schools to recruit teachers through the commission.

 The Bangiya Christiyo Pariseba, a body of representatives of various churches, has decided to convene an emergency meeting to discuss whether it can take a decision on which party the community should not vote for.

 We are flooded with appeals from Christian voters across the state requesting us to make a formal appeal to every Christian voter not to vote for the Left Front, said Herod Mullick, its general secretary.

 The voters have a genuine reason to make such a demand. But we need to examine whether we can make such an appeal, Mullick added. 

 The community is protesting because it feels that Christian missionary-run institutions will not be able to retain their character if they are not allowed to recruit their own teachers and headmasters. 

 The Pariseba is under pressure, Mullick said.

 In several places in Nadia, voters of the community launched a campaign on the eve of Good Friday asking people not to vote for the Left Front. 

 Ashish Mukherjee, the president of the Parisebas Nadia chapter, said: Our community can change the election equation in several pockets of the district. We have a strong base here. 

 In Bengal, the Christian population is about 10 lakh with about 1.5 lakh living in Calcutta and 32,000 in Nadia. 

 Darjeeling, Kurseong, Ka- limpong and Jalpaiguri in the north and Chapra, Hanskhali, Ranaghat and Krishnagar in Nadia, Hooghly town and Bandel in Hooghly district, Baruipur, Kalyanpur, Canning, Gosaba and Basanti in South 24-Parganas and parts of Bankura, Birbhum and the two Midnapores have a high concentration of Christians. 

 In Calcutta, areas under several constituencies such as Taltala, Sealdah, Entally, Bowbazar, Kabitirtha and Dum Dum have a sizeable Christian population.

 The CPM candidate from Chapra, Samsul Islam, wrote to state party secretary Biman Bose last week to reconsider the bill, explaining the Christians stand. 

 We are just 2 per cent of the total population of the state. But even then you passed a bill that would change the character of our institutions. Hence, it will be difficult for us to support you. We are sorry for that, Mukherjee wrote to the four Nadia CPM MLAs. 

 In Hooghly, a large number of people today met the Bandel church authorities and sought the clerics opinion on whether to vote for the Left.

 There is no doubt that the bill is against the Indian Constitution. It is also anti-people because 90 per cent of the students of Christian schools are from other communities, Father K.T. Thomas, a priest at Bandel Church, said after a meeting with the local voters this evening.

 Refused Rs 10, teen breadwinner kills himself

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Sept. 6: A 14-year-old boy, who brought to his mother Rs 400 every month as a tea-stall hand and domestic help, killed himself last night after she refused to give him Rs 10 to go to a local fair.

 Gobinda Mukherjee of Chakdah, Nadia, handed all that he earned every month to his mother and did not have a paisa on him when he wanted her help for a little amusement.

 He had dropped out of school three years ago, when in Class IV, to help his mother run the family. His father Joydeb, who migrated to Bihar to work as a labourer three years ago, sent money home once in a long while.

 Gobinda could not accept that his mother was unwilling to pay him Rs 10 when he contributed 50 per cent of the familys monthly income. He had given her Rs 400 just four days ago, an officer of the Chakdah police station said. 

 Gobinda used to leave home at 8 am for his tea stall duty at Kalibazar market. Past noon, he swept and mopped floors at wealthy farmer households. After having lunch in one of these houses, he returned to the stall around 4 pm to work till around 8.30. He returned home around 9 pm.

 Child labour is banned. Gobinda may or may not have known that. Even if did, he was helpless. For a year, he had been earning Rs 400 a month, the same as his 40-year-old mother Malati, who did stitching jobs.

 Last evening, Malati could not make her teenager son understand that she still found it difficult to make ends meet.

 Malati had tried to tell Gobinda that Rs 10 was a lot of money. Not that I refused to give it to my son because I did not have it. But I wanted to tell him that for people like us, blowing Rs 10 in a mela is a luxury. There are dues to be paid to the grocer, she told the police.

 Inspector Jiten Sarkar said Gobinda had promised his friends that he would join them on the trip. When his mother refused him the money, Gobinda started nagging. Emotionally, he told his mother that he should be paid from his part of the family income. He said he had a right to the money. 

 At this, Malati lost her cool and slapped her son. 

 Gobinda locked himself up in a room and did not come out for dinner. In the morning, when there was no response even after repeated knocks, his mother broke the door open with neighbours and found him hanging, Sarkar said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 CM meet on Salim plans

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 1: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee met Salim Group collaborators this morning to learn about of the groups investment plans before talks with his party allies tomorrow.

 We briefed the chief minister about our plans for the 100-km Barasat-Raichak expressway, Raichak-Kukrahati bridge and the Haldia special economic zone. A consolidated, detailed project report on the projects will be ready next week, said NRI industrialist Prasun Mukherjee after meeting Bhattacharjee at Writers Buildings.

 Bhattacharjee as well as commerce and industries minister Nirupam Sen will explain the project to RSP and Forward Bloc leaders in two separate meetings tomorrow.

 The Salim Group is preparing the project report in consultation with the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation.

 However, officials said the government had not yet decided on awarding the bridge project to the Salim Group.

 Chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb okayed a pre-feasibility study of the project by the Japan International Co-operation Agency last week. The study will be completed by September 2007.

 The government hasnt made a final decision on the project yet, said commerce and industries secretary Sabyasachi Sen.

 But Mukherjee seemed confident. Were donating the bridge to Bengal, he said at Writers. He also told Bhattacharjee that there has been progress on the proposed convention centre at Rajarhat and the logistics hub at Kona Expressway and foundation stones for both would be laid shortly.

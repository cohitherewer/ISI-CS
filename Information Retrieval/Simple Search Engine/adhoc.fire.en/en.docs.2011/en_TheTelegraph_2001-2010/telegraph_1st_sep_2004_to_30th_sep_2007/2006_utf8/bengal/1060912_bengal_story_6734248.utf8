The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 BRIEFS

 Mumbai, Sept. 11: A Bengali couple commi-tted suicide in their Andheri flat this evening.

 Identified as Shubhankar Milan Bhaumick, 23, and Amrit Shubhankar Bhaumick, 29, the two left a suicide note saying no one should be blamed for their deaths. Police said the man was found hanging from the ceiling fan, while his wife was on the bed. 

 Calcutta: Delhi wants Bengals help to tide over its power crisis. Chief minister Sheila Dixit has written to Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee expressing intent to buy 400 mw daily. The Uttar Pradesh chief minister also made a similar plea to his Bengal counter- part recently. Bengal earned Rs 1,000 crore selling power last year.

 Calcutta: Manowara Begum, whose husband was allegedly killed in a police station lock-up in 1999, wants to sell a kidney to feed her four children. But the hospital she approached refused permission as her husbands case is sub judice. Manowara pleaded for the permission in the high court on Monday.

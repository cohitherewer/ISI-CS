 Singur fencing begins

 SAMARPAN DUTTA AND UTTAM DUTTA 

 Singur, Dec. 1: A day after Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee asserted that the Tata Motors plant would be a reality soon, the state industrial development corporation began fencing off the Singur plot acquired for the car maker.

 Industries director M.V. Rao, who is camping in Singur, said fencing around the perimeter of the 997 acres would be finished in four days. We need to fence roughly 10 km. We hope to cover about 4 km a day, but today being the first day we managed to put up the pillars on a one-kilometre stretch, Rao said.

 Senior district officials were not so sure about when they would be able to complete the work. As the administration started working on the fence at Joymollah in Beraberi mouza in the presence of a large contingent of police, rapid action force and combat force personnel this morning, farmers armed with sickles, shovels, axes and allegedly bombs lined up to register their protest.

 The situation was tense to start with as the protesters shouted slogans and hurled bombs. However, as the day progressed, the situation improved and we could carry out our work without a hint of trouble, an officer said.

 We are trying to figure out how much resistance we are likely to face. Things seem to be under control now, said Hooghly superintendent of police Supratim Sarkar. 

 There was another farmers gathering on the bank of the Julkia canal in Khasherbheri mouza, which overlooks the portion of the plot fenced today as the day wore on. 

 Over 500 labourers from Burdwan were ferried to the spot to erect the sal post and barbed wire fence. 

 The land belongs to the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation, which has given the contract for putting up the fence to Mackintosh Burn, district magistrate Binod Kumar said. 

 Mamata Banerjee, however, claimed in Calcutta that the fencing work could not begin because of the farmers protest. The women will play a major role in the fight. The resistance will increase in the days to come and Id be there any day.

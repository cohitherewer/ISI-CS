The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 ...Another takes a pot shot at EC

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Siliguri, April 4: What the Election Commission is doing is just not cricket, feels Asok Bhattacharya, an ardent votary of Sourav Gangulys return to Team India.

 Our fate is like Souravs. The Election Commission is like Greg Chappell and Kiran More, the urban development minister said at a news conference, likening the poll panel to the duo branded villains by supporters of the Behala boy.

 Bhattacharya, the CPMs man from Siliguri, alleged that a few commission officials are playing a dirty game with the Left Front by banning poll graffiti and hoardings.

 The minister, who returned from Assam ? where the first phase of polling was held yesterday ? claimed there was no dearth of election graffiti and hoardings in the neighbouring state. But in Bengal, the commission had not only implemented the undemocratic anti-defacement act of 1976, but its observers are also creating problems when (Left) Front candidates are wearing the partys logo on T-shirts and caps, he said, citing some recent local incidents. 

 This, Bhattacharya said, was much like the treatment meted out to Sourav who is on sticky wicket in the More-Chappell era. 

 Bhattacharya alleged that the Congress and BJP candidates in Assam had made a travesty of the poll process. They had indiscriminately used loud speakers and convoys to attend meetings and surprisingly, the commission turned a blind eye to all these, he alleged.

 The minister had been sent to Assam to boost party workers there. The CPM has an alliance with the Asom Gana Parisad this time.

 People want development, which our government has provided in Bengal, he said, adding: Rest assured that the Left Front is coming back. And so will Sourav, he added.

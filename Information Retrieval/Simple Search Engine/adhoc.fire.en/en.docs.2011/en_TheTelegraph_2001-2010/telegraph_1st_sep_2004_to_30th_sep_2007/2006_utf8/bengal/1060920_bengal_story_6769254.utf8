 Maoists get CPM leader in strike II

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Midnapore, Sept. 19: A CPM leader and his AK 47-toting bodyguard were dragged out of a bus and shot dead in Bengals Maoist heartland this evening. 

 Anil Mahato, 45, the par- tys local committee secretary at Shilda, West Midnapore, had been provided the armed guard after a failed bid to kill him in February.

 The body of constable Dinesh Baskey, 34, was lying next to his in a roadside field, about 230 km from Calcutta, today. 

 Mahato had survived a bullet injury on the side of his abdomen. Today, he was riddled with bullets.

 He had gone to attend a programme of the CPM womens wing at Murari village. After the programme, he took the bus travelling from Raipur in Bankura to Jhargram in West Midnapore on the way to Joypur where he was to attend a another party meeting, an officer of the Belpahari police station said.

 Around 5.30 pm, when the bus was nearing Joypur, three guerrillas grabbed Mahato by his collar and started pulling him towards the gate. Even before Baskey could take aim, his gun was snatched. 

 A rebel pulled out a pistol and shot at Baskey. The gang ordered the bus to halt and dragged Mahato and the injured bodyguard out. 

 Four other guerrillas on motorcycles were waiting there, a police officer said.

 In front of some 40 passengers, who stared out of the bus in disbelief, the assailants pumped bullets into the duo from automatic weapons. 

 District police chief R. Rajsekharan said they died immediately.

 The driver, conductor and the passengers screamed in panic, ran out of the bus and fled wherever they could.

 The guerrillas sped away on the motorcycles.

 The CPM has called a dawn-to-dusk bandh in the Binpur Assembly segment tomorrow. Maoists have killed over half-a-dozen party workers and leaders over the past few months.

 Belpahari police said the extremists appeared to have changed their strategy. This is the first time they followed their targets in the guise of ordinary villagers.

 After the murderers escaped, residents of neighbouring villages set the bus on fire. 

 CPM district secretariat member Dahareswar Sen said Mahato was a party member since 1977. 

 He left behind his wife and two sons in their teens.

 The police said the passengers gave contradictory accounts of the direction in which the gang went after the murder. We are trying to get more details from the villagers who saw them flee, an officer working on the case said.

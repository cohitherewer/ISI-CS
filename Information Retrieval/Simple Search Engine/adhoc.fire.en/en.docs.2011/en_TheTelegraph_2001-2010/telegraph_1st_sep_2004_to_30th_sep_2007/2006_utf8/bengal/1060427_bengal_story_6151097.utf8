The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Comrade first, computer credentials come later

 ANINDYA SENGUPTA

 They couldnt have asked for a truer comrade.

 And if you are wondering why, just spend a few minutes with Debesh Das.

 The CPM candidate and sitting MLA from Taltala is a professor of computer engineering in Jadavpur University. 

 But he sits in the back benches of the Assembly and watches ? without a murmur of resentment ? his party colleague, IT minister Manab Mukherjee, talk about information technology.

 He doesnt even have a say on how far the state has progressed in IT. All he does is par-ticipate in debates on any de- partmental budget. 

 Isnt it high time the party gave him a chance to prove his worth? After all, he does have the credentials to be an IT minister.

 Das brushes aside such suggestions. Like any CPM member, he says it is for the party to decide. And he sees no connection between academic qualifications and portfolio management.

 If that is so, somebody from the military should be a defence minister and an IPS a home minister. I am a professor of computer engineering. But that does not mean Man- abda is short of technocrats. He has a pool of technical experts to give him the right advice, he says.

 Asim Dasgupta, an economist, is in charge of finance and Surjya Kanta Mishra, a doctor by profession, handles health. So what makes him feel he doesnt fit the bill?

 Im not saying that I cannot handle IT, Das shoots back. But it is the partys decision. And I have excellent rela- tions with Manabda. Being a technocrat, there may be an advantage. But Manabda is doing well.

 Please dont think that I hanker after a ministerial berth, he adds after a pause. I work for the party and that gives me enough satisfaction.

 Das thinks he will win this time, too, despite the close call in 2001 when he scraped through by some 800 votes.

 He has reasons to be optimistic. Taltala, a small constituency, has four wards. 

 Of them, wards 54, 56 and 58 have Left councillors. The Trinamul Congress won ward 55, by 500 votes. In the 2004 Lok Sabha elections, the CPM candidate got a huge lead from this segment.

 Yes, our position was quite bad in 2001 but we regained lost ground, says the MLA who expects more than 50 per cent of the votes to go in his favour. 

 Das believes the contest has become easier because of the Trinamul candidate. 

 He is not the only one who feels that way. I dont care whether the CPM wins the seat or not. But who is this man? asks Aditi Basak, a student of mass communication, alluding to Trinamul candidate Sumanta Hira.

 I think Trinamul could have put up a better candid- ate, says Gouripada Sarkar, a resident of Radhanath Chowdhury Lane. Trinamul has sacrificed the Taltala seat by nominating Hira.

 In 2001, Hira managed just 550 votes, or 0.7 per cent of the total votes polled.

 Then why has he been nominated this time? Our partys policy is to create a forum for like-minded people and Hira is one of them, says Trinamul leader Mukul Roy who looks after Taltala.

 What Roy did not mention is that his party chose Hira because he happens to be a CPM rebel. During campaigns, Hira was heard telling voters they should vote for him as he represents the only uncompromising force against the CPM.

 As for the voters, they dont have much to talk about, ex- cept for inadequate supply of drinking water. But they can look forward to a booster pumping station in Tangra to take care of the problem.

 It has been sanctioned and work will start after the elections, says Das.

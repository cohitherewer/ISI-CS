The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Mine Mystery

 An abandoned coal mine on a river island in Purulia, near the Jharkhand border, is at the centre of a controversy with villagers from the neighbouring state complaining that 10 youths have gone missing after entering the pit.

 Padma Mondal (in picture), one of the complainants, said her son Ujjal is trapped in the Gangtikuli mine, about 280 km from Calcutta.

 However, officials have yet to confirm whether the youths, aged between 18 and 25, did go inside the mine. Deputy inspector-general (Midnapore range) N. Ramesh Babu visited the island on Monday. The mine is flooded. We have no plans to launch a rescue operation immediately, he said. The villagers said the youths had drowned in the mine that was flooded by the waters of the Damodar and Barakar rivers.

 All the missing youths are from Khayerkiari village in Jharkhand.

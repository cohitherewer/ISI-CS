The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Blackout in south 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Aug. 30: The sou- th Bengal districts, including Calcutta, reeled under severe power cuts this evening foll- owing the collapse of a string of power generation units in Burdwan and Birbhum.

 A snag at the state electricity boards sub-station in Durgapur town led to the collapse of three thermal units at Durgapur Projects Limited, power department sources said.

 The sudden drop in gen- eration (at DPL) led to the collapse of two 210-mw uni- ts at the Bakreswar thermal power units. So, the shortfall in south Bengal rose to about 500 mw, said an official of the department.

 Normal supply was restored in Calcutta around 8.20 pm but in the districts, power cuts continued till late night.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Partners in con on the prowl

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Happy hunting ground 

 Calcutta, May 6: A walk in the evening breeze on the Maidan may be a good idea after a day under the scorching sun. But men looking for blind dates, beware. 

 For, the hot spot has become a happy hunting ground for a group of young women who befriend men, offer them soft drinks, juices or biscuits laced with drugs and then rob them. And they are not alone. Their partners watch from a distance while the women are at work. 

 The menace has reached such a level that police have issued a warning to the public. If a young and attractive young woman approaches you and becomes friendly within minutes, be careful. Dont accept if they offer you a biscuit or a soft drink. If you take the doctored stuff, you will find yourself unconscious and robbed of all your belongings.

 The warning comes in the wake of the arrest of a 22-year-old and her companion in front of Victoria Memorial on Thursday. That evening, Sima Bibi had befriended 21-year-old Sudipta Sarkar, a member of an NGO who was at a pollution awareness camp in front of Tata Centre. 

 Asking him questions about pollution, Sima told Sudipta to move away from the crowd so that she could listen to him properly. She then gave him spiked mango juice. Later, an unconscious Sudipta was found on Robinson Street, his watch and cellphone missing. 

 Sima and her partner in crime, Mohammad Akhtar, were caught when they were approaching their second victim at the north gate of Victoria Memorial.

 Last February, another youth, Jay Dutta Roy, was found lying on the Maidan. He told the police that he had been sitting alone when a woman came to him. He accepted some biscuits from her and lost consciousness soon after. 

 N.R. Babu, the deputy commissioner of police, south division, said Sima and Mohammad have revealed that there are several couples in the city who have adopted this modus operandi to rob people. 

 The gangs use a young woman as honey-trap. She approaches a man and takes him into confidence with friendly conversation. After taking him to an isolated place, she offers him foodstuff. Once a person accepts it and falls unconscious, the woman and her partner rob him of his belongings, said Gyanwant Singh, deputy the commissioner of police, detective department.

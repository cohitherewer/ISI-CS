The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Trader and son bombed

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bankura, Oct. 8: Dacoits, who broke into businessman Fatik Mondols house in a Bankura town last night, beat him with rods and hurled a bomb as his son rushed to shield him. Mondol was killed and his son left without an arm.

 Hiru, 25, is now fighting for life at Bankura Medical College and Hospital.

 Police said the marauders took away cash and jewellery worth over Rs 1 lakh from the Mondols house in Gangajalghati, 275 km from Calcutta. 

 Mondols younger son Tapan said before storming their house, the dacoits burst two bombs to scare the neighbourhood. Around midnight, they broke open our door. They dragged my father out to the cou-rtyard and started beating him. I tried to call the police from my cellphone but could not establish contact. They came long after the miscreants had fled, Tapan alleged. 

 Mondol, 55, a country liquor shop owner, was forced to lead the goons to his room and open an almirah. They took out Rs 42,000 and jewellery from the locker and brought him out of the room and started beating him again when Hiru intervened, Tapan said. 

 Residents said a police patrol was nearby when the first explosions were heard. They returned after the dacoits left, said Dhabal Singh Dev, secretary of the local traders association.

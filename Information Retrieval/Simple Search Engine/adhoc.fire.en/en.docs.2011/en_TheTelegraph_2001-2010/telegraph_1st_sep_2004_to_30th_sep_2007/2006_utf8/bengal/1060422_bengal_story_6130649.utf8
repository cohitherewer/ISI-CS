The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Showcause to dead MLA

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 21: Former MLA Krishnadhan Haldar, who died last year, was first appointed polling officer and then served with a showcause notice for failing to turn up for training.

 Haldar was the CPM legislator from Kulpi in South 24-Parganas, 70 km from Calcutta, between 1977 and 1992. Also a schoolteacher, he died last December at age 58. 

 We fail to understand how this happened. My father was an MLA for four terms. His death was duly recorded by the local panchayat and condoled in the Assembly, said son Birendranath.

 The officer in charge of the elections in South 24-Parganas, Tanvir Ahmed, blamed the computer for the error.

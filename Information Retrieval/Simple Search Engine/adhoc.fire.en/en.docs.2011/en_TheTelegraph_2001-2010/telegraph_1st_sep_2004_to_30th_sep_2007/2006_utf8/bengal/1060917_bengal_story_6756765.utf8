The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Communist sermon after temple tryst

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Calcutta, Sept. 16: Subhas Chakrabortys jai Tara in a Kali temple has struck a jarring note for his CPM colleagues, who today reminded him about the basic tenets of communism.

 At the Alimuddin Street headquarters, state party secretary Biman Bose and politburo member Sitaram Yechury said communists are not expected to believe in god.

 After being admitted as a member of a communist party, nobody should indulge in any activity that goes against the basic tenets of communism. Every party member should remember this, Bose said. 

 But, he added, he had not sought an explanation from the transport minister for his visit to the Tarapeeth temple on Thursday. I have a lot of work, I have not had any time for this, he said. 

 Yechury, who was in the city today, echoed Bose. As far as a communist party is concerned, we have conducted a historical and ideological debate on whether god created man or man created god. Communists believe that man created the concept of god. 

 However, the CPM state secretary pointed out that the party constitution does not make it a must for a person to be an atheist to become a member. Bose also made it clear that the CPM does not hate people with religious beliefs. In our party constitution, it is not written that membership will not be given to people who are not atheists. We dont hate people who believe in god. But after being admitted to a communist party as member, one has to follow communist ideals and principles, he said.

 Yechury, too, stressed this point. Although there is no bar on anyone who believes in god in getting a membership of the CPM, we would expect that the members would follow the tenets of Marxism. Or, at least, we expect that over the years party members will embrace Marxism.

 On Chakrabortys comment where lakhs of people bow their heads before the deity, I found nothing wrong in doing so myself Bose said it the ministers personal belief. 

 Chakraborty had also said that he considered himself first a Hindu, then a Brahmin.

 Our partys basic foundation is dialectical materialism, Bose said. We dont function on the basis of abstract ideas. Communists are human beings and not inanimate objects. There are instances of old-timers in the party deviating from communist principles and habits. However, that will not affect the image of our party.

 He added that the CPM has not been embarrassed by the ministers comments.

 Even if the party was embarrassed, Chakraborty showed no signs of regret. Instead, he urged transport workers of Haldia to celebrate Visvakarma Puja tomorrow with pomp and grandeur.

 In the port town to inaugurate a bus service, the transport minister brushed aside Boses advice that a party member should not indulge in activities that go against communist principles. 

 Tomorrow is Visvakarma Puja. Celebrate it with pomp and grandeur, he told a gathering of transport workers.

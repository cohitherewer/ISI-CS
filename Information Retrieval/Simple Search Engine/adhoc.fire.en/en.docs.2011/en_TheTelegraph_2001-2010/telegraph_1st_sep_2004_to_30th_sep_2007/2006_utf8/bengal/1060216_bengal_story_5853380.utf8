 Chandan duty skip in court

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, Feb. 15: The case relating to the alleged evasion of central excise worth Rs 37 lakh by Jyoti Basus son Chandans Eastern Biscuits today came up for hearing in the high court after 18 years.

 The case could not be heard before as the papers relating to it disappeared mysteriously in 1988 after a division bench issued an interim order asking Chandan to deposit a bank surety of Rs 15 lakh against the outstanding duty. 

 While hearing a public interest litigation last year, Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurkar ordered court employees to find them and the papers resurfaced last November.

 Today, lawyers appearing on behalf of the biscuit company and its managing director, Chandan, argued that the case should be first heard by an appellate forum of the central excise department. 

 The bench of Justices Pinaki Chandra Ghosh and Tapan Dutt allowed that.

 But, according to the Central Excise Act, Chandan Basu will have to deposit the outstanding amount before moving the appeal, said Uma Prosad Mukherjee, the lawyer representing the high court on behalf of central excise.

 In 1985, the Bolpur office of the central excise department had issued a notice to Eastern Biscuits and its MD asking it to pay Rs 33 lakh as accumulated excise duty.

 Chandan challenged the notice 

 in court and a single bench of the high court stayed it. 

 When central excise appealed against the stay, the division 

 bench passed the interim order asking Chandan to pay Rs 

 50,000 in cash and the bank surety.

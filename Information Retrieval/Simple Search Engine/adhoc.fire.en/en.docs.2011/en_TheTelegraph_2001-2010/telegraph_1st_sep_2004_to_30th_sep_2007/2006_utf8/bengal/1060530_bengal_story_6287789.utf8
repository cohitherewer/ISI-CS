The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Dunlop deadlock continues

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, May 29: A meeting called by labour minister Mrinal Banerjee to end the stalemate at Dunlops Sahagunj unit ended without a result today. 

 Another tripartite meeting will be held on June 5.

 A spokesperson for the Pawan Ruia management said: ...We are positive that a solution would be found in the next meeting.

 The management is believed to have offered options to the workers unions on the calculation of the one-time settlement of back wages and pressed for checks to ensure that the agreement signed between the two parties earlier was adhered to in the future.

 Ruia attended the meeting. Representatives of both Citu and Intuc were also present.

 The minister gave us a patient hearing and told us our demand was justified. But the managements attitude was not very promising, Citu leader Dipankar Roy said.

 On April 30, around 4,300 employees of the Hooghly factory refused to accept the first instalment of the one-time settlement of Rs 30,000 citing errors in the calculation.

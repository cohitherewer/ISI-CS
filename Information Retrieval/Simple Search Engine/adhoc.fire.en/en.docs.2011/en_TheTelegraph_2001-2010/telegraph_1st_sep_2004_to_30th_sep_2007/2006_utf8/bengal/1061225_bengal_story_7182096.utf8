The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Back home from hell in Haryana

 CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA

 Calcutta, Dec. 24: A teenager from Bengal who was part of a dance troupe that performed in Uttar Pradesh villages and was sold to a Haryana man is returning home after a long run through vast maize and sugarcane fields.

 Rubina Mandals story highlights the growing number of women being trafficked from the state. A person I knew offered me a job about a year and a half ago. I went with him without telling my family, said the 18-year-old from Gaighata in North 24-Parganas. We were very poor. My parents are farm labourers and we are three sisters. I am the eldest. 

 Her first stint away from home was not bad. In Uttar Pradesh, she joined the troupe that danced at weddings. All the 16 girls in our team were Bengalis, said Rubina (name changed). 

 Each performance earned her Rs 500. There could be 20 performances a month and she did not face any demand for sex-work. 

 Rubina had trusted the man who took her to Uttar Pradesh with her savings of Rs 15,000. After he escorted her back home, she demanded the money which he refused to return. Instead, he promised her work again, in a factory. 

 This time, he drugged her on the train and brought her to Delhi. Rubina was sold. 

 I was put in a car with two old men. I refused to travel. But my acquaintance slapped me. 

 She was confined to a room at the new place. In the evening, one of the two old men tried to comfort me and said he had bought me. 

 Rubina was first taken to Gurgaon and then to Bahadurgarh in Haryana. 

 There she started to plan her escape. I said that I wanted to use the toilet and a woman took me out. I didnt know who she was, but she showed me which way to run, said Rubina. I spent hours in the dark, in bhutta (maize) and sugarcane fields. Then I saw some people.

 They asked her to stay back and get married, but called the police. The police, too, asked me to get married, but then brought me away, Rubina said, giggling. 

 She was produced in court and sent to Nari Niketan in Karnal, when the NGO, Shakti Vahini, tracked down her family. 

 There are numerous Bengali girls in Haryana who have been sold for marriage in villages with very few women, said Rishi Kant of the NGO. There are so many of them that they are known by a generic name, Paro (from Devdas). 

 Rubina has also been lucky with her family. Her father, who went there to bring her back, has been very supportive. Rubina spoke to her mother over the phone. Both of them cried.

 For every Rubina, there are many from Bengal languishing in brothels, factories or rescue homes in faraway states, often driven to the misery by parents or relatives.

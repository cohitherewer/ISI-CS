 State law no-balled

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 15: A law empowering a zilla parishad chief to nominate panchayat samiti members to village-level sub-committees was today branded ultra vires of the Constitution by the high court. 

 About 3,300 village panchayat sub-committees will have to be reconstituted following todays order.

 According to the high court, the Constitution does not allow a person to act as a member of any upa-samiti (sub-committee) without being an elected panchayat member. 

 A village panchayat upa-samiti is like the mayors council in a municipal corporation. Just like the council has members handling portfolios like health, education and water supply, the upa-samiti, too, has members holding similar charges. 

 Their members draw up development schemes and handle funds allotted for the projects. Sometimes they also receive and disburse funds for the implementation of central government schemes.

 In 1992, the government had amended the panchayat act to empower the zilla parishad sabhadhipatis (chiefs) to nominate panchayat samiti members into the various panchayat sub-committees. 

 Todays court order followed a petition by Golak Roy, the pradhan (chief) of Pajipara gram panchayat in North Dinajpur, challenging the induction of a panchayat samiti member into an agriculture and animal resource development sub-committee.

 Roys lawyers, Anupam Chatterjee and Goutam Thakur, told the court that according to the Constitution, a seat in a village body had to be filled by an elected member. 

 According to the Constitution, election of sub-committee members must be direct, they said.

 For the government, Rabilal Moitra said the state had the right to enact such a law. But Justice J.K. Biswas did not agree. 

 Experts in panchayat law said the Left Front had amended the law to pack its own people even in the sub-committees of Opposition-run panchayats. According to the act, the role of a village panchayat sub-committee is vital. So, the governments intention was to control the panchayats by inducting Left-leaning people, said one of them.

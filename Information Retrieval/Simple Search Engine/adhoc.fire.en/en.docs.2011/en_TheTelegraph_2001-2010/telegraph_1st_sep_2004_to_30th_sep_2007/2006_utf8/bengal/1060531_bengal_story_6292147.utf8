The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Whip on ministers

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, May 29: The Forward Bloc has issued a whip to its four ministers, asking them to attend party office everyday before stepping into their departments. 

 If Buddhababu can attend Alimuddin Street daily at 9 am sharp before going to Writers, why cant our ministers? state Bloc secretary Ashok Ghosh asked the ministers at a meeting last week.

 All our ministers have been told to be present at the party office for an hour from 10 am everyday to discuss the functioning of their departments. It will help better co-ordination between the government and the party, he added.

 Writers Buildings sources said agriculture minister Naren De, food minister Paresh Adhikari, co-operation minister Rabin Ghosh and the minister for relief and agricultural marketing, Murtaja Hussain, have been reaching office about an hour-and-a-half behind schedule since the party whip was issued. 

 Government employees are supposed to be in office by 10 am, though there is no rule for the peoples representatives. They can squeeze in a party meeting or a victory rally in their schedule.

 We are coming a bit late at Writers because of our preoccupation at the party office, admitted Hussain, who reached the secretariat around 11.15 this morning.

 Adhikari reached his food department office on Free School street at 11.30 am. 

 What can I do if I am asked to go to the party office before coming to the secretariat? he asked.

 A senior Bloc leader also said it was difficult to emulate the chief minister, who reaches the party office much before nine and Writers by 10.

 In this years election, the Blocs tally came down by three to 22. One of its ministers, Hafiz Alam Sairani (relief), too, lost.

 The party needs to be briefed by ministers on the functioning of their departments as that information has to percolate to the grassroots for a stronger organisation, the agriculture minister said.

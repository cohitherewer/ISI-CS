The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 The battle goes on

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, May 8: The CPM continued its offensive against the poll panel with Biman Bose pointing out how its personnel had violated guidelines a day after Subhas Chakraborty said he hated it.

 At the partys Alimuddin Street headquarters, state secretary Bose said: Some of the panels observers had violated guidelines laid down by the panel itself. Voters, candidates and polling agents were harassed by them. 

 Five observers had been withdrawn following the partys complaints during the five-phase polls. The commission should have been more careful while selecting observers, Bose said.

 Chakraborty, too, refused to put his gun down. Today he made the media party to what he thought were the panels excesses. The transport minister asked reporters: Dont you people have self-respect? Why have you fallen at the feet of the Election Commission?

 Yesterday, Chakraborty had said that he hated the commission, which was not accountable to the people. 

 Credit for the peaceful polls should go to the people and the state administration, the minister said. Not the EC.

 Reacting to Chakrabortys statements, chief electoral officer Debashis Sen said: Were keeping track of the developments and EC is also being kept informed. 

 Video clips of the ministers statements yesterday have been sent to Delhi.

 The CPM had been promising co-operation to the commission and also attacking it from the time of the electoral rolls revision, in which around 25 lakh names were deleted and around 21 lakh added. 

 Bose today lashed out at the panel for having failed to ensure an error-free voters list. In some constituencies that went to the polls today, he said, the lists with the presiding officers did not match those with the polling agents. This is unheard of and is a pointer to the ECs incompetence.

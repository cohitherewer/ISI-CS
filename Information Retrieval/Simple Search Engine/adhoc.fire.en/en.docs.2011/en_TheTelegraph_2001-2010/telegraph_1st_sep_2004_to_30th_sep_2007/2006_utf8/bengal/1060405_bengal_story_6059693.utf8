 Buddhadeb: Im fine

 Calcutta, April 4: Burdened with a 12-hour daily schedule that includes party work, poll campaign and running Writers Buildings, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee is tired.

 The strain of several weeks took its toll on the chief minister this morning as he woke up feeling exhausted and running a temperature. 

 He stayed the day at home. 

 Hes been very busy owing to his election schedule. He called up this morning saying he was tired and not feeling well. We told him to rest. This mornings cabinet meeting has been deferred, industries minister Nirupam Sen said. 

 When he arrived at Writers around 4 pm, Bhattachar- jee said: Im fine. I have to stay well now. 

 Asked if he would take it easy for a while, he added: No way. Im on my way to the party office. Theres no need to take it easy.

 Bhattacharjees day starts at 9 am, when he leaves for the state CPM headquarters on Alimuddin Street. He reaches Writers around 11 am. Till evening, there is little respite from files, officials, visitors and the media. In the evenings, he has been travelling extensively of late, addressing campaign meetings. 

 Weekends offer no respite. Bhattacharjee spent the last Saturday addressing rallies at Joynagar, Kultali, Mograhat and Usthi in South 24-Parganas. On Sunday, he went to Canning, Baruipur and Sonarpur in the same district.

 Party sources today confirmed that the chief minister was overburdened with work and fatigue led to his illness. Hes been emotionally upset after Anil Biswass death. All this work in this heat and humidity has also taken its toll, a party insider said.

 The CPM state secretary, Biman Bose, who is now touring north Bengal, has cancelled his April 7-8 Guwahati trip after learning about Bhattacharjees indisposition.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Party for new state

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Hisabiatari (Dinhata), Aug. 20: The outfit demanding a separate Cooch Behar state today launched the Greater Cooch Behar Democratic Party.

 The formation of the political arm of the Greater Cooch Behar Peoples Association was announced in the house of one of its sympathisers as police denied permission to hold the programme on the grounds of a primary school.

 We will continue to demand the state of Greater Cooch Behar, said Asutosh Barman, the new party president . The association being an apolitical body, was not effective in pressing for the demand, he added.

 In September 2005, a rally organised by the association turned violent, leading to five deaths. Its founder-secretary Bangshibadan Barman is now in jail.

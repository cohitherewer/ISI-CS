The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Mother, sister shot, boy under bed

 DEBASISH CHATTOPADHYAY 

 Calcutta, Dec. 26: Dacoits shot dead a zari traders wife and seven-year-old daughter last night before making away with Rs 1.35 lakh from his house in South 24-Parganas Canning as his little son Akaash hid under a cot through the night.

 Neighbours saw Tanzira Biwi, 30, and Suraiya Khatoon lying in a pool of blood in the courtyard in front of the single-storey house around six this morning. 

 Four-year-old Akaash was still under the bed. The neighbours heard him sobbing.

 Jahangir Mistry was at his office-cum-rest house at Baruipur town 30 km from his house at Kochua village last night.

 Police said that he sent the money home yesterday. 

 Jahangir, who supplies zari to cloth merchants and is also a leader of the CPM farmers wing, returned home to a family that had been reduced to half. Akaash is still in shock and unable to speak.

 The police said the goons, who broke open the main door to enter the house, were armed with improvised guns.

 Mistry said that he gave the cash to his wife yesterday. The amount was to be distributed among his employees in the zari business, additional superintendent of police A.K. Ghosh said.

 Mithun, a local youth, has been detained for questioning on the basis of Jahangirs complaint, the officer added.

 The murder could have been for revenge too.

 Four months ago, Jahangir had apparently taken part in a village meeting that punished one Amjad Mollah over a land dispute. Mithun is Amjads son. He was picked up because his father was missing, an officer said. 

 Akaash, the officer added, would not be asked anything about the incident until he recovers from the shock.

 As is the wont in the region, the CPMs Gopalpur zonal committee accused the SUCI of targeting Jahangirs family. He oversees the organisation of our peasants wing and had switched to our party from the SUCI two years ago, a CPM leader said. 

 The chief of the local SUCI-controlled panchayat rubbished the charge.

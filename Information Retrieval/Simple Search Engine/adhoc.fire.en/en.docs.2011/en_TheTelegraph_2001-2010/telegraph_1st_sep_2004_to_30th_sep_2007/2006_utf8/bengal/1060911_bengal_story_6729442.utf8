 Teacher in molest net

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Sept. 10: A primary school teacher in Nadia was arrested today on charges of molesting over half a dozen schoolgirls.

 According to police, Ramananda Debnath of Natna Primary School in Karimpur, about 180 km from Calcutta, had been harassing the girls for the past six months.

 Last week, parents of the girls lodged complaints with the block development officer who started a probe against the teacher. 

 The girls had told their mothers that they did not want to go to school until the teacher was removed, said an officer of Karimpur police station. 

 The first complaint came from the parents of a Class III student six months ago, the officer said. 

 The girls father, Bibhash Swarnakar, a goldsmith in Natna village, said the police at that time let Debnath off with a warning. 

 But my daughter refused to go to school. She told me she was scared of the teacher, Swarnakar said.

 Two months later, the father of another Class III student, Budhu Sarkar, lodged a molestation complaint against Debnath. 

 My daughter told me that the teacher used to call her to an empty classroom and then molest her. I told the headmaster of the school, but the teacher showed no signs of changing even after being warned by the headmaster, said Budhu, a farmer. 

 Dukhi Sardar, another farmer from Karimpur, said his daughter who studies in Class IV told her mother that Debnath had physically abused her several times. One day, she returned from school crying and told her mother that she would never go back.

 When some us complained to the headmaster, he summoned the teacher, who denied all the charges. The children did not open their mouth in the teachers presence as they were scared of him, Sardar said.

 However, the parents found that their children would go cold at the very mention of going to school. Last week, they approached the block development officer of Karimpur II, Saumitra Kundu. 

 We carried out an inquiry and found the allegations are not baseless, Kundu said. 

 The BDO then asked the police to take action against the teacher. 

 Sub-divisional officer of Tehatta, Ashok Roy, said the police had warned the teacher earlier. But he did not change his ways. So we arrested him from his home today. We produced him in court and he was remanded in 14 days judicial custody, he said.

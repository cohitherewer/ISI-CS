 7-year girl rescued

 Durgapur, May 14: A seven-year-old girl kidnapped here on Wednesday was rescued from Gaya early this morning before they could sell her off to flesh trade. 

 The kidnappers had asked Munni Bhartis father to pay Rs 2 lakh as ransom. But real- ising that Manoj, a grocer, did not have that kind of money they changed their plan. Police traced the ransom calls made from their mobile.

 Munni went missing on her way home from school. In the course of investigation the police learnt that she was last seen at Durgapur station with Prahllad, who lived in the same locality.

 We caught Prahllad near his residence on Friday night when he secretly came to meet his wife, said Anand Kumar, the Durgapur additional superintendent of police. 

 Prahllad, 35, a petty thief in the polices book until then, said he had handed Munni to a man called Karu, who took her to Gaya. He also revealed that the kidnappers had decided to sell her in Dubai. 

 A team led by Durgapur OC Sankha Biswas went to Gaya with Prahllad and rescued the girl. Karu was held, but Sakikuddin, his boss, escaped.

 Munni returned home to-day smiling, a potato chips packet in hand.

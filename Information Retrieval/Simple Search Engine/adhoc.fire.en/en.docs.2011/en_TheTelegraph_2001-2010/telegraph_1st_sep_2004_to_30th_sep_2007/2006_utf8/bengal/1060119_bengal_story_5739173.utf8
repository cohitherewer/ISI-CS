The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 Karat on EC mission

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Karat: Limit watch

 Calcutta, Jan. 18: Unhappy with the role of election observers touring the state to screen bogus voters, the CPM today said it would take up the matter with the Election Commission.

 CPM general secretary Prakash Karat discussed the issue with Jyoti Basu at the latters residence this afternoon. Karat called on me to discuss the role of the election observers touring Bengal. I have asked him to talk to the Election Commission on his return to Delhi, the veteran Marxist and former chief minister told The Telegraph.

 Karat, on a days visit to the city to attend a programme of the Bank Employees Federation, said that the observers should work within their prescribed limits.

 If they (observers) go beyond that, we shall take up the matter with the appropriate authorities, he told reporters at the CPM headquarters.

 Karat took a dig at the observers for taking along photographers during their trips to detect irregularities in electoral rolls. I dont understand why they (observers) are concerned about publicity.

 Asked about the possibility of the Centres intervention in Bengal, the CPM general secretary said: The Congress has learnt its lessons from Bihar. I dont think it is planning any arbitrary action.

 Replying to a question on the probability of the Assembly elections being deferred, Karat said: I dont think there is any reason to defer the elections beyond May. Elections have to be held within May, when the term of the present government ends.

 At a rally in South 24-Parganas yesterday, CPM state secretary Anil Biswas had threatened that there would be a mass upsurge if attempts were made to defer the polls.

 The state Congress today took strong exception to his statement, terming it unconstitutional.

 Moodys outlook stable for rupee debt

 OUR BUREAU

 Mumbai, May 4: Moodys Investor Services, the international credit rating agency, today raised the outlook on Indias domestic currency debt rating to stable from negative because of the improvement in the countrys debt ratios.

 The outlook upgrade on the countrys Ba2-rated domestic currency debt brought it in line with the other India-specific ratings ? the BAA3 country ceiling for foreign currency debt, the BA2 country ceiling for foreign currency bank deposits, and the governments foreign currency issuer rating.

 The main explanation for the shift in the trajectory of the debt ratios, after many years of deterioration, is the combination of robust nominal gross domestic growth and cost savings achieved as lower interest rates mitigated the costs of servicing an ever-higher debt, Moodys said.

 These factors are likely to keep the public debt high, but at worst, the trend is likely to flatten out even in the absence of reinforcing structural adjustment.

 However, Moodys cautioned that the countrys fiscal indicators remain at extremely high levels compared with the countrys local currency rating peers despite the uptick in the outlook.

 An ongoing improvement in Indias fiscal credit metrics is expected to proceed, although occasionally at an awkward pace, Moodys said.

 Moodys said all of Indias fiscal indicators remained much worse than other countries carrying the same local currency rating.

Moodys outlook upgrade comes two weeks after 

S amp;P raised the outlook on Indias sovereign credit rating to positive 

from stable.

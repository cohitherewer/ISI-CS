 Demand for plug-in hybrids 

 Los Angeles, Sept. 2 (Reuters): Pacific Gas amp; Electric Co is asking its 5.1 million customers to petition automakers to speed up development of plug-in electric-gasoline hybrid vehicles, Californias largest utility said on Friday. 

 Along with their power and gas bills for September, PG amp;E customers will get a request to lobby the automakers. 

 PG amp;E and its parent, PG amp;E Corp, have joined with an Austin, Texas-based organisation called Plug-In Partners that has set up an Internet petition drive to pressure US and foreign automakers to make cars that can charge up by plugging in to a regular 120-volt household outlet. 

 The petition basically says, If you build it, we will buy it, said PG amp;E vice president Bob Howard. 

 For their part, the automakers say plug-in hybrids are not ready for the showroom floor. 

 The leading hybrid seller in north America is Toyota Motor, which, including August US sales figures issued on Friday, is on pace to sell 198,000 hybrids in 2006, up from 145,560 in 2005. 

 In June, Toyota said hybrids will be the core technology of the 21st century.

 Hybrids on the road use electricity generated by the gasoline-fuelled engine. But affordable plug-in hybrids are a decade away, Toyota spokesman Bill Kwong said on Friday. 

 If that is so, said PG amp;E spokeswoman Jann Taber, the petition drive and other efforts to pressure automakers could speed up the process of development to mass production. 

 Automakers arent convinced there are enough buyers, PG amp;Es Howard said. Thats why PG amp;E is hoping to harness the power of its 5.1 million customers.

 The three major US automakers, General Motors, Ford Motor and DaimlerChrysler, do not see hybrids as the winning alternative to gasoline-fuelled vehicles. 

 GM is in the early stages of plug-in hybrid development and has not committed to any production, spokesman Dave Barthmuss said. 

 Hydrogen fuel cells are the alternative of the future, but plug-in hybrids are likely to be among several alternatives that will serve as a bridge until the time hydrogen fuel cells are affordable and practical, Barthmuss said.

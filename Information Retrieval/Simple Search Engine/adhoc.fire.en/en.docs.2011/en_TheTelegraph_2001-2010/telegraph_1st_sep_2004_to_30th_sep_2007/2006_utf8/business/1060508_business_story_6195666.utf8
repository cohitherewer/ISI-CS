 Indian Airlines, ICICI Bank ink craft buy deal

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Dealmaker

 Calcutta, May 7: Indian Airlines has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with ICICI Bank to fund its pre-delivery advance payments (PDPs) to buy 43 aircraft.

 The airline said ICICI Bank would arrange and underwrite the $152-million external commercial borrowing (ECB) to be taken from a syndicate.

 The agreement with ICICI Bank was for four years, from June 2006 till January 2010, the airline said.

 The bank will also assist Indian Airlines in raising long-term funds from European export credit agencies (ECA) .

 The MoU was inked by Indian Airlines chairman and managing director Vishwapati Trivedi and Kalpana Morparia, joint managing director of ICICI Bank .

 ICICI Bank was short-listed after a competitive bidding process.

 The MoU will help Indian Airlines raise funds for its aircraft acquisition programme, which will allow the airline to step up growth, expand market and improve the quality of its product offering, besides replacing some of its Boeing 737 and A300 aircraft, the airline said.

 On February 20, Indian Airlines had signed an agreement with Airbus Industrie to purchase 43 Airbus A320 family aircraft ? comprising 19 A319s, four A320s and 20 A321s ? for around $2 billion.

 Air-India plans

 Air-India is tapping overseas markets for taking on lease three medium-capacity, long-range aircraft, likely through the wet-lease route, to maintain its schedules in the winter season starting October. 

 While dry-lease implies leasing of the aircraft only, wet-lease means inducting the pilots and cabin crew as well. 

 However, officials said the airline was not looking at inducting the cabin crew, but could induct pilots along with the three aircraft.

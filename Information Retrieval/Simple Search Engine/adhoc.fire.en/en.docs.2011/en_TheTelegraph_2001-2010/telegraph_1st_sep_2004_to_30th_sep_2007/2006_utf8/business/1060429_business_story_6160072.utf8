 IDBI moves court for Haldia Petro stock

 URVASHI KAUL

 New Delhi, April 28: The Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI) has moved Delhi High Court against the company law board (CLB) order deferring allotment of Haldia Petrochemicals shares to the financial institution.

 IDBI has alleged that The Chatterjee Group (TCG) has obtained the interim order by suppression of material facts regarding its arrangement with Haldia Petrochemicals.

 The CLB, while allowing the allotment of a 7.5 per cent stake to IOC, had restrained the company from allotting shares worth Rs 135 crore to IDBI till the final disposal of the case.

 IDBI has argued that its agreement with Haldia Petrochemicals was not considered by the CLB. It also said the CLB had acted beyond the scope of the petition as there was no request to restrain the issuance of shares in its favour.

 The financial institution also alleged that the order had come in the way of implementing the package approved for the corporate debt restructuring of the company.

 The CLB had ruled that the decision on IDBIs application, seeking allotment of shares, would be taken at the time of final hearing on the main petition. 

 IDBI had appealed to the CLB on August 2, 2005, to allow share allotment in its favour.

 IDBI is the principal lender in a consortium of 52 financial institutions. 

 The CLB had observed that with further allotment of shares to lenders, according to the terms of the corporate debt restructuring, the petitioners (TCG) stake would be reduced to a minority. 

 Haldia Petrochemicals has a debt burden of Rs 3,000 crore.

 The CLB had issued an injunction order on August 4 last year.

 The Chatterjee Petroleum Mauritius Company had argued in its appeal that if more shares were allotted to IDBI, TCG would become a minority stakeholder. 

 However, IDBI had sought to vacate the status quo order. It had also moved the board seeking allotment of shares.

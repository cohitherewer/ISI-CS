 Wal-Mart profit inches up

 Chicago, May 16 (Reuters): Wal-Mart Stores Inc, the worlds biggest retailer, posted a better-than-expected 6 per cent rise in quarterly profit on Tuesday, as new merchandise, such as its Metro 7 clothing line, boosted spring sales. 

 Earnings rose to $2.62 billion, or 63 cents per share, in the first quarter ended April 30 from $2.46 billion, or 58 cents per share, a year earlier.

 Analysts on average expected 61 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Wal-Mart said in April that quarterly profit would probably be between 58 cents and 62 cents. Last years first quarter results included $145 million in one-time gains for a tax settlement and legal issues.

 We are very pleased with our start to this fiscal year, Wal-Mart chief executive Lee Scott said in a statement. We continued to have record sales and earnings, and our inventory performance was the best we have seen in many quarters.

 Inventory had been problematic for Wal-Mart in previous quarters. Many suppliers said Wal-Mart asked them to cut back on shipments in the first quarter as the retailer tried to reduce what it called clutter in its stores. 

 Net sales rose 12.3 per cent to $79.61 billion.

 Wal-Mart has been adding more upscale merchandise such as fashionable clothing and flat-panel televisions to its stores in the hope of tempting customers to buy more than just groceries, which carry low profit margins.

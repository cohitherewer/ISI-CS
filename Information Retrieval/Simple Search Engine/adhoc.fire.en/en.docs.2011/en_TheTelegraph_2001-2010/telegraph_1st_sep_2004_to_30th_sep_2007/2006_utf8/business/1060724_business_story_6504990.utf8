 Double trouble

 Some smart get-rich plans are in the market, warns Srikumar Bondyopadhyay

 Have you got a call from a bank or a brokerage house offering you an investment plan with this spiel: ?It?s a five-year investment plan where you will have to put in a minimum of Rs 10,000 to Rs 15,000 every year for the first three years only and in the sixth year you will get nearly double the amount you have invested. If you want, you can withdraw partially or fully from the accumulated fund after three years. Moreover, you will also get a life insurance. The investments and withdrawals are tax-free. Are you interested??

 Admitted, it?s a very tempting proposition. But pause for a minute: any investment that promises to double in five years has got to be suspect, especially now when the stock markets have turned choppy and banks and post offices are offering a maximum interest rate of 8 per cent that makes every Rs 100 grow to Rs 200 in eight years nine months!

 What these banks and brokerage houses are offering isn?t a brand new knockout investment instrument; it?s just unit-linked plans of life insurance companies. 

 For some time now, life insurers are offering ?premium holidays? on their Ulips to arrest policy lapses. Under this facility, if a policyholder fails to pay the premium, the policy will still be in force. To keep it alive, the insurer deducts the charges for the risk cover and other administrative fees by knocking off units from the policyholder.

 The premium holiday is available till the total unit value in the policyholder?s account falls below Rs 1,000. The policy lapses after that. Making a tacit use of this facility, banks and other corporate agents of life insurance companies are offering their investment plans.

 Their telemarketing executives are trying to catch investors with this bait. At the first instance, they won?t tell you that the scheme they are offering is a Ulip and not an investment product.

 Second, they won?t tell you that during the ?non-contributory? period (read, premium holiday), there will be deductions towards the insurance coverage and other charges by reducing units from your investment kitty. 

 Since Ulips are market-linked and there is no accretion in investment during the premium holiday, the deduction of charges by knocking off units actually reduces the value of your unit fund. A back-of-the-envelope calculation of such an investment plan as offered by a foreign bank in bancassurance tieup with a private life insurer reveals that the accrued value after five years falls below the total investment made during the first three years.

 Here we have assumed an annual return of 10 per cent and an annual investment of Rs 15,000. The minimum sum assured will be Rs 75,000 (five times of annual premium as prescribed by IRDA). Total investment after three years stands at Rs 45,000. Assuming a 10 per cent annual rate of return on investment (in growth option), the units in the kitty after all deductions will be 2,742 and the fund value stands at Rs 40,145.62! So, there you are if you have gulped the bait. 

 Leveraging the premium holiday for an investment bet is not a good option, particularly in Ulips. The allocation of premium during the initial years is much smaller than in later years. Insurers pay a higher commission to its agents in the first year of every policy they sell and this commission is included in the expenses, which is deducted from the first year?s premium. Insurance is a long-term contract. Beware of short-term investment gains from an insurance product.

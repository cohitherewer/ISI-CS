 Number scare stalks market movers

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Jan. 11: After two heavyweights reported quarterly performances that failed to meet the market expectations, stocks are expected to come under pressure when trading resumes after a days gap on Thursday.

 The bourses were shut today on account of Bakri-Id. Observers believe the third quarter results of Reliance Industries (RIL) and Infosys Technologies will have a bearing on the markets. They see shares opening lower and operators turning aggressive sellers. 

 Reliance on Tuesday reported a 15 per cent drop in net profit. For the first time in 10 quarters, the refining and petrochemicals giant saw its earnings coming down ? to Rs 1,776 crore at the end of December 31 from Rs 2,091 crore in the corresponding period last year. The results disappointed investors who had anticipated a decline of 10 per cent.

 Infosys numbers today were in line with what had been expected. 

 Though net profit of the Bangalore-based IT services major grew 31 per cent to Rs 649 crore, it failed to cheer optimists who had expected the earnings to touch Rs 660 crore. 

 The results of RIL were definitely a disappointment for many in the market. On the other hand, Infosys displeased those who were looking forward to better numbers. Therefore, the markets are likely to open lower and speculators may unwind their positions at the outset itself, said an analyst. 

 He hastened to add that long term investors are unlikely to join the band of sellers tomorrow.

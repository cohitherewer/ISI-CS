 Arcelor votes for Mittals steely grit

 June 30 (Agencies): Shareholders in steelmaker Arcelor rejected on Friday a merger deal with Russias Severstal, clearing the way for an agreed $32-billion takeover by Mittal Steel.

 Shareholders representing 57.94 per cent of capital voted against the plans, which would have given Severstals main owner Alexei Mordashov a key stake in the merged group. At least 50 per cent of the capital was required to block the deal.

 Seeing this vote, the board will now unwind the agreement with Mr Mordashov, Arcelor chairman Joseph Kinsch told shareholders.

 Originally hailed by Arcelors board as salvation, the deal with Severstal was the prime obstacle to the companys present agreement with Mittal to join forces.

 Immediately after the vote, Mittal Steel said in a statement that it was delighted that 57.9 per cent of all Arcelor shareholders voted down the Severstal proposal.

 At a press conference following the EGM in Luxembourg, Kinsch said he expects Mittals offer for Arcelor to close on July 12 and for Mittal to know how many shareholders had tendered their shares into the offer on July 15.

 Immediately afterwards we will sit together to define the new company, he said. 

 Kinsch said the future of current Arcelor chief executive Guy Dolle was still uncertain, but that both he and Mittal Steel chairman Lakshmi N. Mittal wanted Dolle to remain at the new company.

 Shares in Arcelor and Mittal gained after the news. Arcelor shares were up 1.3 per cent at 38.00 euros. Mittal shares were up 2.8 per cent at 24.80 euros, to value the Mittal offer of 13 shares plus 150.60 euros in cash for every 12 Arcelor shares at 39.42 euros.

 Severstal shares had risen 2.4 per cent to 286.01 roubles on Moscows Micex exchange.

 The vote clears the way for Indian-born billionaire Lakshmi Mittal to realise his dream of creating a steel giant three times larger than its nearest rival, with about 10 per cent of the global market. The deal would create a group with 3,20,000 employees producing about 116 million tonnes of steel annually.

 Mittal made its first proposal to acquire Arcelor in January. After five months of bitter resistance, Arcelors board finally accepted an improved offer on Sunday. The Severstal deal had been a cornerstone of its defence against Mittals unwanted embrace.

 I understand the situation has been confusing for you and that I owe you an explanation, Kinsch told shareholders at the start of Fridays meeting.

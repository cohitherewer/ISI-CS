 Crisil finds local banks to be quite resilient

 Mumbai, Aug. 29: A review conducted by rating agency Crisil has come to the conclusion that Indian banks can withstand the changes that will come with the implementation of Basel II norms.

 The study said if the new capital adequacy framework proposed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is implemented, capital adequacy for the system will still be comfortable at over 10 per cent compared with the regulatory minimum requirement of 9 per cent.

 Krishnan Sitaraman, head of financial sector ratings, said the new capital adequacy framework (Basel II) requires banks to provide incremental capital for market and operational risks by March 31, 2006 and March 31, 2007 respectively. He added that Crisils study of 23 banks found that if the proposed framework were to be applied to the banking sectors portfolio as on March 31, 2005, the overall systemic capital adequacy levels (the capital that banks must maintain of their risk-weighted assets), as a proportion of risk-weighted assets, would decline by 1.9 per cent to 10.9 per cent. But the capital adequacy levels will remain above the minimum RBI stipulated levels as the banking system had strong capitalisation levels.

 This finding was only one aspect of the Crisil review. A study done by Arun Panicker, Crisils director of financial sector ratings, said the sector is more robust than ever before. While liquidity is adequate to support overall credit growth of 25 per cent given normal deposit growth rates, core profitability should remain stable in the medium term, with net profitability margins exceeding 1.5 per cent.

 According to the rating agency, even though the current environment mirrors that of the mid-1990s preceding economic downturn of the late 1990s the stronger fundamentals of the system reduce its vulnerability to economic stress. Crisil has simulated a stress scenario by applying the historic high default rates observed in the late 1990s to the current asset portfolio of banks. The stress scenario results show that the increase in non-performing loans and capital coverage of bad loans would be at acceptable levels, Panicker said while adding that a more diversified asset portfolio, the Sarfaesi Act, stricter provisioning norms, loan write-offs over the last five years and higher capitalisation lend resilience to the system.

The tight liquidity conditions prevailing in the second 

half of 2005-06 have eased. A deposit growth rate of 16 per cent and a marginal 

reduction in the investment portfolio can support credit expansion of as much 

as 25 per cent in 2006-07 while still maintaining the SLR portfolio at 30 per 

cent for the system as a whole.

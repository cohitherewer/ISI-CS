 Wrangle over ship projects

 S.P.S. PANNU

 A rough patch

 New Delhi, Oct. 29: The shipping ministry has accused the Planning Commission of delaying its projects by upholding its mandatory in-principle approval for the projects.

 Sources said shipping secretary A.K. Mahapatra discussed the issue at a recent meeting. He has asked his colleagues to confront the commission with a list of projects that have been purportedly delayed because of the commissions in-principle approvals not materialising in time.

 The ministry now wants the commission to dispense with its mandatory in-principle approval for big projects that have to be cleared by the Public Investment Board (PIB), which has representations from both the finance ministry and the commission.

 According to the ministry, since the commission is represented on the PIB, there is no need for its approval before this stage.

 However, the commission is a body of experts that vets all major proposals by evaluating their rate of return through a cost-benefit analysis. That is why the initial in-principle approval has been put in place by the government so that projects with huge financial implications for the country are not hastily pushed through without adequate analytical inputs, a senior Yojna Bhavan official said.

 If the Planning Commission accedes to the demand of the shipping ministry, similar demands will be made by other ministries as well and the system of careful checks and balances would break down, he added.

 With the commission amassing great powers under its new deputy chairman, Montek Singh Ahluwalia, the shipping ministry faces an uphill task. According to sources, commission approvals are not the only reason for delays in projects. The failure to obtain timely environment clearances has also held up port projects. 

 The Ennore port, for instance, could only spend Rs 13.4 crore of its total outlay of Rs 76 crore in 2005-06 as environment clearances for its capital dredging project did not come through. The port chairman has informed the ministry that the clearance has been obtained only during the current year and the project would now go ahead. 

 Sources said the shipping secretary wants to include achievements in respect of plan expenditure targets as a criterion for evaluating the performance of ports.

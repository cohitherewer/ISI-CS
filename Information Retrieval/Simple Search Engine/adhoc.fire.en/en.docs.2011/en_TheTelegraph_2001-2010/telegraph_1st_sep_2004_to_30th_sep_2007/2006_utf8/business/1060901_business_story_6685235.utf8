 Govt holds on to Balco rump stake

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Aug. 31: The UPA government today decided to stall the sale of its rump 49 per cent holding in Bharat Aluminium Company to Sterlite Industries. Instead, it will return the cheque for Rs 1,098.89 crore that Sterlite had sent to the government to buy out the shares. 

 The decision comes on the back of a report by the Comptroller and Auditor-General which said the original sale of a controlling interest in Balco for Rs 550 crore had been undervalued.

 The cheque for Rs 1,098.89 crore that the company gave us will be returned to Sterlite immediately for appropriate negotiation and conciliation proceedings. A committee of officers under the chairmanship of the law secretary, supported by the disinvestment secretary, the department of disinvestment and the ministry of mines, has been constituted, said information and broadcasting minister P.R. Das Munshi.

 Sterlite maintains it should be given the remaining government equity in Balco, in which it had bought a majority stake. It had sent an unsolicited cheque for the rump shares to the government and later filed a court case on the issue. However, the courts have directed Sterlite to settle the matter through arbitration. 

 The government has decided to go along with the ruling of its attorney-general who has said put and call options in buy-outs are not valid under Indian law and has also made adverse comments about the manner in which the residual share sale price had been fixed by SBI Caps.

 The cabinet note, which had been circulated to all ministries concerned, says the government should accept the advice of the attorney-general in this matter. 

 In a written opinion, the attorney-general has said in view of sections within the Companies Act 1956 and Indian Contract Act 1872, the provision of valuation date and call option do not survive and consequently M/s Sterlite cannot exercise option or bind the government to accept the same.

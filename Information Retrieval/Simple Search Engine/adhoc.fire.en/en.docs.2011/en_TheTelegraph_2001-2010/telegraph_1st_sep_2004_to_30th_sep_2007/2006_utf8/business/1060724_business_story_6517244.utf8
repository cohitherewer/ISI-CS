 Iran favours rethink on LNG deal

 New Delhi, July 23 (PTI): In a major blow to Indias plans to source gas from Iran to meet its energy requirements, Tehran today said there are difficulties in honouring the $22-billion contract to sell liquefied natural gas to New Delhi.

 I think both sides (have) found out that there are some specific difficulties to implement the agreement as it is now, Irans foreign minister Manouchehr Mottaki told a television channel.

 In June last year, Iran agreed to supply 5 million tonnes of LNG for 25 years beginning in 2009-10. It has since then not been able to source the technology to liquefy the gas, a domain of the US and European firms that are not inclined to provide the know-how to Iran in view of the American economic sanctions.

 I think both sides understand that it is a little bit complicated because of the changing circumstances from the time when the contract and the agreement was signed, Mottaki said.

 India has, however, insisted that Tehran honour its commitment and even sought legal opinion to see if the contract can be enforced.

 Union petroleum minister Murli Deora had raised the issue of implementing the contract with Irans president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in Shanghai last month.

 After the meeting, Deora had said Iran must honour all its commitments and there was no question of re-negotiating or reopening the June 2005 LNG supply contract.

 GAIL concern

 GAIL (India) Ltd has expressed concern regarding its projects with Iran, which are embroiled in various geo-political issues.

 There are uncertainties involved due to the geopolitical developments in the country. Everything depends on how the government handles the situation, sources in the company said. 

 GAIL and the National Petrochemical Company of Iran entered into an agreement in 2005 to set up a gas cracker unit in Iran at an investment of Rs 8,000-10,000 crore.

 A pre-feasibility report on the proposed one-million-tonne-per-annum petrochemical plant to bet set up in south Pars zone in Irans Assaluyeh has been completed after which a joint venture is to be formed.

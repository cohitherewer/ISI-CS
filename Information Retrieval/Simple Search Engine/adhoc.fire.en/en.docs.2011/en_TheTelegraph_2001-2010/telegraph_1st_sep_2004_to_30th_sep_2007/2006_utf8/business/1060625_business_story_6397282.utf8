The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Recipe for more jobs

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 24: A double-digit growth in manufacturing and a shift from crop farming to value-added agriculture are imperative to foster employment generation, said Ashok Lahiri, the governments chief economic adviser. 

 At a seminar organised by the Bengal National Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Lahiri stressed on the need for value-added farm production, such as poultry, dairy and food processing. 

 The share of agriculture in GDP has come down to below 24 per cent... But a decent growth in agriculture is very important for a sustainable GDP growth of 8 per cent.

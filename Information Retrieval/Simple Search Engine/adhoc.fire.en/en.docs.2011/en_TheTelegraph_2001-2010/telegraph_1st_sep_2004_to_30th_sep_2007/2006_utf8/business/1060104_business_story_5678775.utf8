 Calcutta, Jan. 3: Eveready Industry India Ltd is planning an overhaul of its packet tea business 

 Eveready, which is the country?s largest manufacturer of drycell battery, aims to double the volume over the next three years.

 ?Our packet tea business is growing by 35-40 per cent. We hope to close this year with a volume of 7,500 tonnes,? Deepak Khaitan, vice-chairman and managing director, Eveready Industry India Ltd, said today.

 Tea consumption in the country is growing by 3.5 per cent annually and packet tea sales are going up at a faster pace.

 Even after record crop this year, there could be a shortage in the bulk tea market.

 Eveready sells packet tea under the Greendale brand, which has four variants ? Tej, Jaago, Pure Gold and Classic.

 The plantation and the bulk tea businesses are now vested with the group company, McLeod Russel.

 So far, the company has not promoted the brands by way of advertising. 

 The group is now trying to put up an all-included plan that will also have specific programmes to spur the packet tea business.

 Khaitan said the volume of packet tea segment would touch 15 per cent of Eveready?s turnover in the next three years when the company would achieve a turnover of Rs 1,500 crore.

 The packet tea business currently constitutes around 10 per cent of the company?s Rs 800-crore turnover. Going forward, the company plans to include a few more variants to its existing portfolio of four.

 Packet tea industry, dominated by players like Hindustan Lever and Tata Tea, is going to get a further fillip when the remaining states will join the value-added tax regime.

 Beyond batteries

 Eveready today forayed into the mosquito coil business. The company will use its existing distribution channel to sell the product. It will also lend the dry-cell battery brand, Poweron, to this product.

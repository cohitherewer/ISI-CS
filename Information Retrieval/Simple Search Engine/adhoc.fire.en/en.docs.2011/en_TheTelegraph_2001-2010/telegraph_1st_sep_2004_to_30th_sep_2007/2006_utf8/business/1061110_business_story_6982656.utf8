 Coal tender emits heat

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Calcutta, Nov. 9: Japanese conglomerate Marubeni has hauled Eastern Coalfields and the AV Birla group to court after it was unceremoniously dumped from a bidding process for a Rs 4000-crore contract to modernise open cast mines at Rajmahal in Jharkhand.

 Justice Soumitra Pal of Calcutta High Court today admitted Marubenis petition challenging the manner in which it was left out of the bidding process in the pre-qualification stage, allowing Essel Mining of the AV Birla group to walk away with the contract. 

 Justice Pal directed ECL to abide by the result of the writ petition moved by the four-member consortium that included Marubeni, HMP Construction Pty, McNally Bharat and Bramhaputra Corporation.

 After hearing the parties, the court admitted the petition for final hearing. ECL and Essel are to file their written affidavit by November 24. We will file our reply on December 1 and the matter will be heard thereafter, Debanjan Mondal, advocate for the consortium, told The Telegraph.

 ECL had invited international competitive bids for the expansion of open cast mines at Rajmahal that attracted bids from a consortium comprising Marubeni and HMP of Australia, and Essel Mining of the AV Birla Group.

 The ECL tender was first floated in February last year but it was scrapped. It was re-tendered on March 1, 2006 when three parties Essel, Thiess Minecs, and the four-member consortium led by Marubeni Coal Pty Ltd submitted bids.

 The bids were submitted on May 23. ECL then sought clarifications on June 21 asking the consortium to submit documents to prove that Marubeni Coal Pty was a mine operator.

 The 200-page reply went on July 12 detailing the work that Marubeni Coal Pty had done, mainly in Australia.

 ECL again asked for a detailed break-up of the turnover of McNally Bharat on August 30. The reply was sent on September 4, but after that there was no communication from ECL.

 When the consortium learnt that it had been dumped along with Thiess at the pre-qualification stage, it wrote a letter to ECL seeking an explanation. The consortium members charged ECL with lack of transparency, accountability in the process and its inability to handle such a large international contract.

 ECL countered the argument by saying Marubeni Pty was not a mine operator and did not have adequate financial resources to undertake such a large contract.

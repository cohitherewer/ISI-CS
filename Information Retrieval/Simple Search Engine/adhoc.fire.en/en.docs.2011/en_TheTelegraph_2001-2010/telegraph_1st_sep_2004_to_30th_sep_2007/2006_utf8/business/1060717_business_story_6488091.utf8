The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Size does matter in infotech world

 Everybody knew that Infosys?s first-quarter results were going to be good because of the depreciation of the rupee against the dollar. But it wasn?t just the rupee depreciation that was the reason for Infosys?s excellent results ? while earnings per share was up 19 per cent on an Indian GAAP basis, compared with the previous quarter, they rose a not-to-be-scoffed-at 15 per cent in terms of US GAAP. That was well ahead of analysts? expectations.

 The main driver for the superlative performance has been volume growth, which was 11.3 per cent over the previous quarter. The icing on the cake was provided by Infosys?s improved guidance for financial year 2007, with the revenue forecast improving by 8 per cent over its earlier projection at the beginning of the financial year, and earnings estimates going up by 10 per cent. What?s more, as the Infosys management pointed out at the conference call, the guidance doesn?t factor in any change in the rupee/dollar rate for the rest of the year. There?s some good news on pricing as well ? onsite billing rates were up 1.1 per cent, while offshore rates were up 0.2 per cent. Also, new business is being signed at a 2 to 3 per cent price increase. Onsite revenues grew strongly, indicating a sharp rise in new projects. No wonder the stock has been well supported even in a weak market.

 What about the much-feared pressure on margins? EBITDA margins are down 220 basis points sequentially, primarily on account of higher wage costs and visa fees, while the rupee depreciation helped repair some of the damage. Sure, attrition is increasing and wage hikes are inevitable, but they need to be seen in the context of several facts. 

 One, as CEO Nandan Nilekani pointed out, with Indian wages rising by 15 per cent annually and with Indian salaries accounting for 12 per cent of the total revenue, the company has to manage a hit of 1.8 per cent, which shouldn?t be difficult. Two, the salary increases for the year are now behind them. 

 And three, the management says they will be able to maintain the operating margins on a year-on-year basis, in spite of the decrease in the first quarter.

 With earnings growth forecast at 38.3 to 39.6 per cent in rupee terms for the year, and with its current PE at around 38, valuations are more than reasonable.

 iGATE disappoints

 iGATE Global Solutions? results, out on the same day as Infosys?s, were a study in contrast. Unlike the last quarter, iGATE was able to show decent topline growth ? an 8.5 per cent rise in operating revenues ? in the first quarter. But even here, offshore volume growth in IT services was lower than in the previous quarter. 

 Moreover, the entire benefit of the higher revenue growth was more than nullified by rising cost, especially salaries. Analysts also point to cost overruns in projects. The bottomline: a 78 per cent sequential drop in earnings per share. That?s in spite of the boost provided by rupee depreciation. 

 The lesson is a simple one. While frontline firms like Infosys benefit from their size, brand value and economies of scale, that benefit cannot be taken for granted for the smaller IT firms. 

 That?s precisely the mistake the market had made by ramping up the iGATE stock prior to its results.

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, July 19: NIIT Technologies has posted a 56 per cent year-on-year rise in its profit after tax for the first quarter ended June 30 at Rs 21.8 crore. Revenues were up 40 per cent year-on-year at Rs 191 crore, the company said. It posted an operating profit of Rs 36.3 crore and an EPS of Rs 5.64 for the quarter.

 During the April-June quarter, NIIT won orders worth $38 million, CEO Arvind Thakur said.

 We added four customers in our areas of focus and expanded business with a transportation customer through an intake of $20 million worth of orders during this quarter, Thakur said.

 Three new clients were added in transport business while one in retail, he said refusing to divulge the name of the clients.

 Additional revenues from Room Solutions, which NIIT acquired in May, supplemented the 27 per cent year-on-year organic growth in the quarter, NIIT Technologies chairman Rajendra S. Pawar said.

 The companys operating profit margin is expected to decline in the second quarter due to integration costs of Room Solutions, the UK-based insurance solutions provider, Thakur said.

 However, it is likely to be up in the subsequent quarters, he added. The IT solutions segment contributed to 94 per cent of total business at Rs 179 crore, while revenues from business process management was Rs 12.1 crore.

 Business from Europe contributed 46 per cent to the total revenue, while the Americas share was 34 per cent during the quarter.

 Sebi stays away from court

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, May 5: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) is unlikely to move the courts ? which are all going into a month-long break ? to vacate the stay orders that have been obtained by people and entities embroiled in the IPO scam.

 On Thursday, Saumil A. Bhavnagari, one of the 85 financiers of the key operators behind the scam, had obtained a stay on the capital watchdogs directive that barred him from the securities market, including the IPO segment. 

 Bhavnagaris stay is a lot more significant than the one that the Karvy group obtained on Tuesday since this is the first that actually allows a person charged in the scam to continue trading. 

 Karvy, however, had obtained a stay on just one portion of Sebis directive, which ordered Karvys over seven lakh demat account holders to switch their depository participant (basically shift their demat account) within 15 days. Except for a handful of people, the demat account holders are innocent and would have had to undergo a lot of trouble to shift their accounts.

 Although it is vacation time in almost all courts, Sebi can get a stay from the vacation judge. But it appears to have decided against such a course of action.

 There were rumours yesterday that it would file a caveat in Bombay High Court. The caveat would have meant that the court should hear it first before entertaining any cases from the people named in the interim Sebi report. But here too Sebi seems to have decided against it.

 Meanwhile, Sebi today postponed its meeting with the representatives of the Karvy group. 

 Apparently, an e-mail was sent to Karvy last night informing it that the meeting with Sebi has been postponed till further notice. 

 As of now, Karvy has obtained an oral stay order from Andhra Pradesh High Court. The interim order stays the Sebi order that asked clients of Karvy Stock Broking Ltd to transfer their accounts to other depository participants. Karvy is one of the most prominent intermediaries in the multi-crore IPO scam.

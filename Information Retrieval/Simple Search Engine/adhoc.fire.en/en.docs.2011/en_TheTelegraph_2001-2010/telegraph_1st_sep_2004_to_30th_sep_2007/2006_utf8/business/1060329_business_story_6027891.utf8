 Calcutta, March 28: The Bengal government has welcomed the opening of the Calcutta chapter of the American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham), an association of American business organisations in India, though the ruling Left Front was up in arms against the recent visit of US President George Bush. 

 We have failed to attract foreign direct investment in the same way as Delhi did ? we got only 10 per cent of what Delhi has bagged so far. The reason is that we could not instill confidence among foreign investors. Now, the presence of the chamber in the city will convey the message that the state is investment-friendly and help build investors confidence, said Bengal industry secretary Sabyasachi Sen.

 The chambers city chapter plans to do more than that. We will be able to bring in US investments here irrespective of policy difference between the Centre and the state, said AmCham India executive director Ramesh Bajpai. 

 There are over 1000 small and medium enterprises from the US operating in the Asia-Pacific region. But these companies dont have any presence in India. We want to bring them here. For this, we have already formed a special SME committee headed by our Hyderabad chapter head J.A. Chaudhry, Bajpai said. 

 The chamber is planning to hold talks with the apex SME association in the US in October-November. 

 We will also organise an Indo-US business summit in January next year either in Delhi or in Hyderabad with a special focus on the SME sector, he added. 

 Bengal will, of course, be showcased by AmCham as an important investment destination. 

 This is the third fastest growing state and Im happy that the chamber, which looks after the business interests of US firms in India, has opened its Calcutta chapter, with 11 members to start with, said Henry V. Jardine, the US consul general in Calcutta.

 J amp;J may up bid for Guidant

 Philadelphia, Jan. 11 (Reuters): Johnson amp; Johnson is weighing a higher takeover offer for medical-device maker Guidant in a move to thwart a $25-billion bid from rival suitor Boston Scientific, a source familiar with the situation said on Wednesday. 

 J amp;J and Guidant have held discussions since Boston Scientific submitted its definitive bid for Guidant on Sunday, the source said. A decision on a potential new bid is imminent, said the source, who declined to be identified by name. 

 J amp;J had agreed to buy Guidant in December 2004 to gain a greater share of the $10-billion market for devices that help regulate heart beats. 

 But J amp;J had slashed its offer in November last year following safety concerns and litigation over Guidants heart products, opening the door for Boston Scientific to make its offer. 

 Boston Scientific, which makes cardiovascular devices and products used in oncology and urology, formalised its offer on Sunday and set a January 19 deadline for Guidant to respond. Guidant shareholders are scheduled to vote on the J amp;J pact on January 31. 

 J amp;Js offer is currently valued at about $64.36 a share, or $21.9 billion. Boston Scientifics offer, meanwhile, is valued at $72 a share, or $25 billion. 

 Hedge fund Elliott Associates LP, a Guidant shareholder, on Tuesday urged Guidant to favour the Boston Scientific bid over the pact with J amp;J. 

 The fund said quot;anything less than $71 per share from J amp;J should not be accepted. quot; 

 Guidant shares were up 90 cents, or 1.3 percent, at $70.29 in morning New York Stock Exchange trade. 

 J amp;J declined to comment. Guidant and Boston Scientific could not be immediately reached for comment.

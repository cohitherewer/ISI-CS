 New Delhi, July 14: Car aficionados can now drool over the Raging Bull.

 The Lamborghini Murcielago ? touted as the world?s fastest production car that some test drivers say can vroom at speeds of 160 kmph in second gear ? has now come to India. And it sports a price tag of Rs 3 crore.

 The Murcielago ? a two-seater, two-door coupe with gull-wing doors ? spells brute power and raw beauty and will wow anyone who loves sports cars. Under the hood, it has a V-12 engine that produces 580 hp, goes from zero to 100 kmph in three and a half seconds and has a top speed of over 300 kmph.

 Along with the Murcielago, Italian sports car manufacturer, Automobili Lamborghini, today launched two super luxury sports: the Gallardo and the Gallardo Spyder.

 The Gallardo is a two-seater sports car that carries a ?modest? sticker of Rs 1.65 crore while its twin ? the Spyder ? is a convertible that will set one back by Rs 1.85 crore.

 Lamorghini?s entry into India spices up the offering in the luxury car market which is bristling with sedans and limousines like the Maybach, Bentley Arnage and Rolls Royce Phantom to name a few.

 Stephan Winkelmann, president and CEO of Automibili Lambhorgini, S.p.A, said the company has already sold six cars in India of which two have already been delivered.

 The company is aiming to sell 10 cars in this calendar year and is looking at selling a similar number in 2007.

 In India, it has tied up with Satya Bagla?s Exclusive Motors, which has a showroom in Delhi and plans to start a new dealership in Mumbai by the year-end.

 Launching the cars, Winkelmann said, ?The Indian economy is doing well. In the next four to five years, we see a good demand picking up for luxury cars. However, India?s infrastructure needs an improvement.?

 Senior company officials said Lamborghini will prefer ?exclusivity? than look for volumes in the country.

 However, sales for the company have been increasing with augmenting model line-ups and its entry into newer markets like Russia and the Czech Republic.

 ?We are a 43-year-old company and were selling just 250 cars per year annually for as many as 40 years. However, this has changed in the last three years where we crossed the 1,000 mark. We finished 2005 with sales of 1,600 units and hope to touch 1,900 this year,? he said.

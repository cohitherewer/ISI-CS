 New Delhi, Dec. 11: Coal India is eyeing mines in Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Indonesia and Bangladesh to secure the countrys energy security. 

 Relief is at hand for steel, cement and power companies as far as sourcing of coal is concerned as the government plans to buy coal mines abroad, Dasari Narayan Rao, minister of state for coal, said.

 We have shortlisted Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Indonesia and Bangladesh to acquire coal mines and they are under consideration, Rao said on the sidelines of a coal seminar here. 

 Coal India wants to have its own mines abroad. However, the proposal is yet to be approved by the cabinet, he said.

 Rao said the mines would be acquired through Coal Indias subsidiary Coal Videsh Ltd. 

 Last month, Coal India chairman P.S. Bhattacharya said the company was already in talks with public sector companies Steel Authority of India Ltd and Rastriya Ispat Nigam Ltd to jointly acquire coal blocks abroad.

 The minister said 35 million tonnes of coal was likely to be imported during the financial year ending March 2007.

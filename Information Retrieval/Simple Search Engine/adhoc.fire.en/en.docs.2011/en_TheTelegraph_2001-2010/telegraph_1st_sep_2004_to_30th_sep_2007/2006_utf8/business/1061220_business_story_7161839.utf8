 ITC bets big on paper division

 New Delhi, Dec. 19 (PTI): ITC will invest Rs 1,540 crore in its paperboards and speciality papers division by October 2008.

 We will invest Rs 1,100 crore by April 2008 in Bhadrachalam in Andhra Pradesh and Rs 440 crore by October 2008 in the plant near Coimbatore in Tamil Nadu, ITC paperboards and speciality divisional chief executive Pradeep Dhobale said.

 ITC has already got clearance from the ministry of environment and forests for the expansion of the Bhadrachalam plant and is awaiting clearance for investment in the Coimbatore plant, he said.

 We are creating two centres of board manufacturing in the Bhadrachalam and Coimbatore units, he said. The total paper production capacity of the Bhadrachalam plant would rise to 4 lakh tonnes per annum by April 2008 from 3 lakh tonnes. The total elemental chlorine free (ECF) pulp production would increase to 2.2 lakh tonnes per annum by the last quarter of 2007 from 1 lakh tonnes.

 ECF pulp, based wholly on plantation wood and introduced in 2002 by ITC, is a state-of-the-art fibre line, which meets effluent norms set by the ministry of environment and forests and pollution control boards.

 ITCs plant in Coimbatore, which is based on recycled fibre, would increase its total annual capacity of paper production to 1.80 lakh tonnes by October 2008 from 1 lakh tonnes. 

 The clearance for the Coimbatore plant will take a couple of months, but we have set the target of increased production by October 2008, keeping in mind the time to get clearance, Dhobale said.

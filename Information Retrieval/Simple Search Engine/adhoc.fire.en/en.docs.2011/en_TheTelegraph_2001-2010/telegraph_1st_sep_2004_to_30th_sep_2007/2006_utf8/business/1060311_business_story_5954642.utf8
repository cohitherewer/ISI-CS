 State Bank appetite for fresh equity

 Purwar: Big plans

 New Delhi, March 10: The State Bank of India (SBI), the countrys largest commercial bank, is planning to come out with a follow-on public offer and a mega debt issue in the coming months. SBI is also in talks to acquire a bank in Bangladesh.

 The public offer is likely to be worked out during the second quarter of the next financial year, SBI chairman A.K. Purwar said, but refused to divulge any details about the amount the bank was planning to raise through the issue.

 SBI is also planning to float a debt issue to raise around Rs 4,000 crore to meet its fund requirement as it expands it global footprint.

 We may raise Rs 3,000-4,000 crore in debt through bonds or some hybrid instrument, Purwar said on the sidelines of a seminar organised by Ficci here today.

 While no official word was available, speculation is rife that SBI is negotiating to acquire Rupali Bank ? a medium-sized bank in Bangladesh. Although he refused to name the bank, Purwar indicated that the deal may be clinched in the next couple of months. 

 The Bangladesh Privatisation Commission is, at present, holding roadshows in the overseas market to divest equity in the bank. SBI has thrown its hat in the ring and has submitted its expression of interest.

 We are interested and they are also interested, said Purwar.

 If the deal goes through, it would be the fourth overseas acquisition of SBI in recent times. It had acquired three foreign banks in 2005 ? in Mauritius, Indonesia and Kenya. 

 SBI, sources said, has a budget of $100 million for acquiring medium-sized banks overseas.

 Purwar had earlier said SBI has infinite appetite for more acquisitions and the bank has set a target of increasing its presence in Saarc countries (other than India) from the present seven branches to 27 in three years.

 SBI is also looking at entering into alliances and joint ventures with local institutions in other countries to expand its non-banking services such as credit-cards, mutual funds, merchant banking and insurance.

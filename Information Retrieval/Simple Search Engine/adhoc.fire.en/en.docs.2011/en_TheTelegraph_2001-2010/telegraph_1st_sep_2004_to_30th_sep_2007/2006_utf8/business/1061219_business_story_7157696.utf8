 Lanco, Tatas win showcase power projects

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Dec. 18: Lanco Infratech and Tata Power Company have bagged the two 4,000mw ultra mega power projects, to be set up at Sasan in Madhya Pradesh and Mundra in Gujarat, respectively. The total investment in these two projects will be up to Rs 40,000 crore.

 The Lanco-Globoleq combine quoted a tariff of Rs 1.196 per unit to outbid nine other companies, including public sector NTPC, for the coal pithead-based Sasan project.

 Tata Power pipped five rivals to the post with a tariff of Rs 2.26 per unit for the coastal Mundra project to be fuelled by imported coal. 

 Power secretary R.V. Shahi told journalists that the two companies would be formally awarded the projects by the end of this month. Finances for the projects will be tied up in six months and power generation is likely to start from 2010-11.

 According to Shahi, private companies offered very competitive tariffs, while public sector NTPC, which bid only for Sasan, quoted a tariff of more than Rs 2 per unit.

 Reliance Energy had quoted a tariff of Rs 1.29 and Tata Power Rs 1.41 per unit for Sasan, Shahi said. 

 State-run Power Finance Corporation, the nodal agency for conducting the bidding process, had received 10 bids for the Sasan project and six for the Mundra project.

 The process of tariff-based competitive bidding has been vindicated... It has been established that when we have support from the government on tying up inputs and clearances, the confidence level increases, Shahi said.

 He said the industry had responded with very competitive rates, taking the first steps to fulfill the governments objective to provide electricity at affordable rates.

 While the government had already allocated a coal block for the Sasan project, the process for importing coal has been initiated for the Mundra project. 

 According to power minister Sushil Shinde, there is no dearth of money for projects in the Eleventh Plan (2007-12) .

 This is evident from the number of bids we have received for the first two projects, he said.

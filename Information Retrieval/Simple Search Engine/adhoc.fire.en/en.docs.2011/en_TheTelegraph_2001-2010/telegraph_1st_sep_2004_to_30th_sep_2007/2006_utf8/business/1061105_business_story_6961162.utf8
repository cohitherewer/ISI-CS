 Sriperumbudur, Nov. 4: A day after Craig Barrett made it known that Intels investment in this country hinges on a clear-cut semiconductor policy, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh promised fast action and announced that a policy to support the industry will be finalised soon.

 Inaugurating the Flextronics Industrial Park here, he said the government would also come out with an electronics and IT hardware manufacturing policy.

 Emphasising the need to develop semiconductor fabrication facilities and to support this sectors growth, Singh promised a forward-looking policy to promote investments and create new employment in this sector. 

 We will reduce tariffs on 217 IT items to zero per cent as agreed at the WTO and the SEZ policy is already quite favourable for electronics manufacturing firms, Singh said.

 We will create an investment environment to offer new opportunities for entrepreneurs, both domestic and foreign.

 Speaking to reporters in New Delhi yesterday, Barret said, For the last ten years, we have been asked this question on our India plans. It is still an open issue. We are eagerly waiting for the governments incentive package (under the semiconductor policy) and weve had extensive discussion with the government on this. We are awaiting the final set of rules and regulations and will respond quickly once we get the policy.

 According to the Prime Minister, the government was committed to setting up a mission on vocational education to improve the skill base of the people as the country would be faced with shortage of employees with essential skills with the rapid growth in the IT and electronics sector. 

 Singh said with the commissioning of the Flextronics facility, Sriperumbudur is poised to emerge as a world class manufacturing township for the electronics and IT sector. 

 Congress president Sonia Gandhi said India has a long way to go before it could bridge the digital divide and convert it into digital dividend. She said the establishment of major companies like this in Sriperumbudur was a fitting tribute to late Rajiv Gandhi who heralded a new revolution in the Indian telecom sector. 

 Electronic manufacturing services provider Flextronicss new facility would have a total area of eight million sq feet, of which around a million sq feet has been completed.

 While laying the foundation stone for the Rs 470-crore Global Automotive Research Centre at Oragadam, 15 km from here, earlier in the day, Singh said it is the beginning of a new chapter in the history of the automotive industry in the country. 

 The centre will have state-of-the art infrastructure for automotive testing and homologation.

 Mike Mcnamara, CEO of Flextronics, said the company had committed a total investment of $200 million in Tamil Nadu, spread over a period of five years.

 The company has already lined up six customers and the maximum supply would be to Nokia, at present. 

 Peter Tan, president and managing director of the Asia operations, said an average of 8,000 people would be employed per million square feet, which was the companys global benchmark. 

 The company would initially manufacture cell phones. Mcnamara said the new facility complements the companys other facilities across the world in Mexico, Brazil, two in China and one each in Hungary and Poland.

 The Prime Minister also visited the Nokia factory nearby.

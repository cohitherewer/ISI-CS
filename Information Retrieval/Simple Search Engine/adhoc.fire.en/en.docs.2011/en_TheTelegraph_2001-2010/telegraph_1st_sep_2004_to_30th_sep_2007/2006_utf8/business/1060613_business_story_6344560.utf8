 Guj NRE buys stake in Kiwi firm

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Calcutta, June 12: Gujarat NRE Coke has picked up a stake in a New Zealand company that has coking coal reserves.

 The largest domestic low ash metallurgical coke manufacturer has paid NZ$20 million, or Rs 58 crore, to pick up a 13 per cent stake in Pike River Coal Company Ltd.

 Pike River is a subsidiary of New Zealand Oil and Gas Ltd, a listed company with major oil, gas and coking coal reserves.

 Moreover, Gujarat NRE will procure 400,000 tonnes of Pike Rivers ultra low ash coking coal annually as long as the mine is operational.

 This fresh investment will extend Gujarat NREs Australian interest to New Zealand. In the last couple of years, the company acquired two coal mines in New South Wales and an interest in other mining and mineral exploration ventures. 

 Gujarat NRE will start taking 200,000 tonnes of coking coal from 2007 from Pike River. 

 With its two existing producing mines in Australia, Avondale and Gujarat NRE 1, the company will bring close to 1.9 million tonnes of hard coking coal in 2007.

 Gujarat NREs stake buy is part of a pre-initial public offer (IPO) placement made by Pike River.

 Arun Kumar Jagatramka, vice-chairman and managing director of Gujarat NRE, will join the Pike River board after the IPO. We aim to secure the hard coking coal resources to meet the demand of our Indian and overseas customers, Jagatramka said.

 Given the low ash and low phosphorous level of Pike River coke, Gujarat NRE will be able to manufacture high performance coke sought by the makers of high quality steel.

 The company plans to mix Pike River coal with regular coking coal to make a special grade met coke.

 According to Sumit Khetan, president of the company, Gujarat NRE could get $20 a tonne premium for this grade over the regular low ash coke.

 India mostly depends on imported coking coal as the domestic variety is high on ash content. 

 India imports around 22 million tonnes of coking coal per annum. With the expected growth in the steel industry, the import is seen to rise to 64 mt by 2011-12.

 To meet the demand, Gujarat NRE is putting up a 0.4-mt coke oven plant at Dharwad in Karnataka. This will take Gujarat NREs met coke capacity to 1.4 mt. This plant is slated to start production in July 2007. 

 Khetan said the acquisition would be funded from internal resources and there would not be any further equity dilution.

 The Gujarat NRE stock was today down by 1.42 per cent, or 90 paise, to close at Rs 62.40 on the BSE.

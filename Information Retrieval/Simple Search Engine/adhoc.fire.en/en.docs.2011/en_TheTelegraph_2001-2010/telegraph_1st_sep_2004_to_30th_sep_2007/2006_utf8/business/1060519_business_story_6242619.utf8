 Punjab Bank to raise Rs 1000 cr

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Gupta: Big plans

 New Delhi, May 18: Punjab National Bank (PNB) is planning to raise Rs 1,000 crore as Tier-II capital to meet the capital adequacy norms as mandated by the Basel II requirements.

 The bank is also contemplating an increase in interest rates between 25 and 50 basis points after July.

 I do not see any softening of interest rates in the next three to six months. We are preparing ourselves for market risk. A 25 to 50 basis point increase in interest rates should not cause any anxiety in the market. However, interest rates would remain stable at current level up to June-July, bank chairman S.C. Gupta said. 

 Gupta said the bank would raise Rs 1,000 crore to increase its capital to meet the Basel II requirements.

 The board has already given its approval for raising the amount. We are looking at the appropriate time to raise the funds. We plan to raise about Rs 500 crore within the first quarter itself, he said.

 The bank has not decided on the specific instrument through which this money would be raised, he added.

 Indian banks would have to raise a significant amount of capital after the new norms come into effect from March 31, 2007.

 Under Basel II, the capital requirements are more risk sensitive and requires banks to hold capital not only for credit and market risk but also for operational risks. Moreover, they are required to hold capital for concentration risks and liquidity risks.

 Announcing the financial results for the year-ended March 31, 2006, Gupta said net profit of the bank stood at Rs 1,439.31 crore compared with Rs 1,410.12 crore at the end of March 2005, registering a growth of 2.1 per cent. 

 This is after providing for necessary provisions of Rs 1,435 crore towards income tax, wealth tax, NPAs, standard assets, depreciation compared with Rs 994 crore in the previous year, he said.

 However, net profit for the fourth quarter amounted to Rs 288.67 crore compared with Rs 360.63 crore in the corresponding previous period, registering a decline of 20 per cent.

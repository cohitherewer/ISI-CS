 Ban on Parekh stays

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Parekh

 Mumbai, July 14: The Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) upheld a Sebi order that barred tainted stock broker Ketan Parekh from trading in the market for 14 years for executing illegal and manipulative transactions. Parekh had challenged the December-2003 order against him and seven co-related entities. 

 The three-member tribunal, headed by SAT Justice N.K. Sondhi said, Ketan Parekh had rigged the market in a big way and the penalty imposed on them was quite reasonable having regard to the gravity of the charges proved against them. Hence, we find no ground to reduce the period of debarment. 

 SAT also criticised Sebi for passing a light judgment on the two brokers, Credit Suisse First Boston (India) Securities and Dresdner Kleinwort Bensons Securities. Sebi banned Credit Suisse from trading for 18 months and Dresdner for two years.

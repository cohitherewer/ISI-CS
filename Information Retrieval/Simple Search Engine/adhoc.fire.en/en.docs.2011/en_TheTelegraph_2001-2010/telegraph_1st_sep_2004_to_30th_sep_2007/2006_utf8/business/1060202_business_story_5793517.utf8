 Calcutta, Feb. 1: Berger Paints India Ltd will set up a greenfield automotive paints plant in Haryana for passenger cars, two-wheelers and tractors. In the fist phase, the company will invest Rs 35 crore. 

 Berger has acquired the land for the project and is in the process of securing other statutory approvals.

 The plant will be completed by December 2006 and become fully operational from January 2007 with a single shift production capacity of 500 kilolitres per month per shift. 

 Managing director Subir Bose said this would be the companys eighth factory in India. Its other factories are two in Bengal, one each in Pondicherry, Goa, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh and the powder coating plant that was recently started in Jammu.

 Berger caters to companies like Tata Motors, Fiat, Hero Honda, Escorts, Yamaha, Bajaj Tempo, Swaraj Mazda and Mahindra and Mahindra with a 10 per cent market share in the automotive paints segment. After the new plant becomes operational, the company hopes to increase its share to 13 per cent.

 The factory in Shibpur, Howrah, currently caters to the automotive category with a monthly capacity of 700 kl.

 The setting up of the second phase is completely subject to market demand and would mean doubling the capacity, Bose said.

 Berger has a plant in Nepal called Berger Jenson amp; Nicholson Pvt Ltd. Its $2.5 million plant in Krasnadar in Russia ? Berger Paints Overseas Ltd ? will become operational from July.

 The paint industry has been growing at the rate of 11-12 per cent and Berger has a market share of 19 per cent.

 The prices of solvent-based paints is expected to rise sharply due to the rally in crude oil prices. With the crude hovering at $67 a barrel globally, margins will come under pressure.

 Although Berger is investing in a new plant for automotive paints which is primarily solvent based, it plans to focus on water-based products through a host of innovations, especially in the decorative paints segment.

 The company has registered its highest growth in the south. 

 Last fiscal, Berger has clocked a turnover of Rs 913 crore and has set a target of Rs 1,100 crore for this year.

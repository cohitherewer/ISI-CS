 IA gets first of 43 new planes

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 19: Indian Airlines (IA) today got the first jet of a 43-plane order placed with Europes Airbus Industrie at a cost of $2 billion. The entire order is expected to be delivered by March 2010. The A319, which joined the fleet today, is the domestic carriers 74th aircraft.

 The government is planning to merge international carrier Air-India and its domestic counterpart Indian Airlines into a carrier with about 130 aircraft to take on competition from global rivals like British Airways, Lufthansa, Singapore Airlines as well as local airlines like Jet and Sahara. 

 However, the merger deal is currently undergoing close scrutiny by a group of ministers. The new Airbus planes are expected to replace 70 per cent of Indian Airliness ageing fleet. Indian Airlines is buying a mix of Airbus-319s, Airbus-320s and Airbus-321s, which will be delivered over four years.

 The state-run airline now has planes that are 12-20 years old. In contrast, Sahara and Jet have recently inducted new planes, bringing down their average fleet age to about 7-8 years.

 Officials said 90 per cent of the cost of acquiring the new aircraft will come from loans while 10 per cent will be funded by the airline itself.

 Todays plane was the first purchase of the airline in the past 15 years. The first of the Airbus aircraft will not have in-flight entertainment gadgets like music and TV monitors. Therefore, it is likely that this aircraft will be used for domestic flights.

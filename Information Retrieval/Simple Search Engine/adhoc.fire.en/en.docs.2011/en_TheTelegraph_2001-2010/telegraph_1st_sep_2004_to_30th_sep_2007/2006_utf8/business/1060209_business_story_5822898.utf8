 Deora takes pipeline pledge

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Deora: Carrying the baton

 New Delhi, Feb. 8: Petroleum minister Murli Deora today promised to carry forward the efforts that Mani Shankar Aiyar was making on the proposed Iran-Pakistan-India pipeline project. 

 Deora told reporters that he is looking forward to meeting and discussing the issue with Amanullah Khan Jadoon, the Pakistani oil minister, when he visits New Delhi on February 17. 

 We are committed to making the project happen. We need the gas from Iran and will continue to pursue it, he said. There are hurdles and the project will take time. But we are sincere and keen on it. 

 He also said the ministry of external affairs would be involved in the discussion. The new minister appears to be careful about not stepping on the toes of the external affairs ministry as Aiyar had ended up doing. 

 The project proposes to transport 90 million standard cubic metres of gas per day from Irans South Pars field to India from 2009-10. This is almost equal to the amount of natural gas available in the country at present.

 Deora will discuss the project structure, framework agreement, technical and legal issues and political insurance of the pipeline with his Pakistani counterpart. The pipeline will supply 60 mmscmd of gas to Pakistan.

 Asked about the status of the $22-billion deal with Iran to import 5 million tonnes of LNG a year for 25 years beginning 2009-10, he said, Iran is a friendly country and we are negotiating the terms. I hope the deal will come through.

 Deora also said oil companies would continue to look for oil and gas fields abroad as the Russian and Sudanese investments had turned out to be highly successful.

 He said talks would continue to tie up gas supplies from Myanmar where Aiyar had been holding negotiations. 

 Deora also held talks with Maharashtra chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh on the Dabhol power project for which GAIL has not yet been able to secure gas supplies. 

 According to current plans, the project may be started with naphtha as fuel for a trial run. The only problem is that the high price of naphtha will lead to an increase in the price of electricity as well.

 Global monitors see growth losing steam

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Dec. 14: Rating agency Standard amp; Poors (S amp;P) today said deceleration in investment and monetary and fiscal corrections for macro-economic stability could rein in growth at 7.5-8 per cent in 2007. The agency, however, said growth in 2006 will touch 8.5 per cent.

 The rating agencys forecast was echoed by World Bank, which in a report released today, projected the Indian economy to grow at 8.7 per cent this year but estimated that the high growth would moderate in 2008 due to tighter financial and fiscal conditions.

 S amp;Ps Asia Pacific Market Outlook for 2007 said Indias rating could be upgraded to investment grade if its public finances improved further. The outlook on the sovereign credit rating on India was revised to positive from stable in April, highlighting that if current credit improvements continue, especially on the fiscal front, India could achieve investment grade ratings, the rating agency said. 

 Speaking to The Telegraph on the S amp;P report, Subir Gokarn, executive director and chief economist of Crisil, said 2006-07 was the third year of an upsurge in investments. 

 Typically, such cycles last for three years and we are anticipating some moderate slowdown based on that, Gokarn added. S amp;P analysts said the measures taken by the RBI to crimp interest rates could also moderate the growth rate.

 The report warned Indian companies against relying too much on debt to fund their acquisition and expansion plans. The agency said the companies, which were borrowing heavily to finance acquisitions abroad, stand the risk of getting downgraded.

 Anshukant Taneja, director (corporate ratings), Asia, S amp;P, also gave the downgrade warning to those companies which are weakening their operating margins by raising debt to fund capacity expansions, at a time of rising rates.

 He said companies should review their debt profiles.

 Phantom firms face the heat

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 7: MCA-21 will not only help companies file their documents on an anytime, anywhere basis, it will also aid the ministry of company affairs to weed out the defunct and vanishing companies. 

 Every month 80-100 new companies are incorporated in Bengal only. There are more than 7.5 lakh registered companies in the country. But the true picture is that 30 per cent of these are defunct companies, said U.C. Nahata, regional director, ministry of company affairs. 

 The ministry has already initiated stringent measures such as forced delisting of companies which have not filed returns for the last three years. 

 After MCA-21 replaces paper filing of documents by the end of this year, the registrar of companies offices will strike off the names of the defunct companies in their respective jurisdictions, Nahata said.

 The ministry of company affairs is also taking strict actions against vanishing companies prior to the full-fledged implementation of the mission mode project.

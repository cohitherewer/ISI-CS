 HPL verdict in October 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 7: The Company Law Board is likely to give its final verdict on the dispute between the Bengal government and the TCG group over the control of Haldia Petrochemicals (HPL) by the end of October. 

 The Bengal government holds shares in HPL through the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation. 

 CLB chairman S. Balasubramanian, who was here today for the 34th annual conference of the Institute of Company Secretaries of India, said, Possibly by October- end, a final order will be given. The hearing on the dispute is over and both the parties have been asked to submit their returns by October 10. After that, it will take another 10-15 days to prepare the order. Returns are written opinion of the counsel of WBIDC and Purnendu Chatterjee, respectively.

 The final hearing at CLB is on October 4. 

 Last week, Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and TCG promoter Purnendu Chatterjee separately met HPL chairman Tarun Das in Delhi. 

 Earlier state industry minister Nirupam Sen had failed to convince Chatterjee of the need to settle the dispute outside the CLB. 

 Das is expected in the city later this month for a crucial board meet of the company.

 It seems both the parties are keen to settle the dispute out of court; and many meetings are expected before the CLB verdict.

 GAIL stake sale nets IOC Rs 561 crore

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, March 2: Indian Oil Corporation today sold half of its cross-holding, or a 2.41 per cent stake, in GAIL for Rs 561 crore. 

 A total of 20.4 million shares were sold at Rs 275 apiece to various domestic and overseas financial institutions, including Life Insurance Corporation and ICICI Prudential. IOC had a 4.83 per cent stake in GAIL, which amounted to 40.8 million equity shares. The downstream oil company also holds 9.61 per cent in ONGC with an entitlement for 13.7 crore shares.

 On December 28, the IOC board had approved the sale of 20 per cent and 50 per cent of its stakes in ONGC and GAIL, respectively, during the current fiscal. It had appointed JM Morgan Stanley and Citi Financials as merchant bankers for the stake sale.

 IOC had received 13 presentations for the stake sale and shortlisted three for putting in price bids for the ONGC stake and four for GAIL.

 With international crude prices skyrocketing and the government forcing downstream oil companies to sell their products at fixed prices, IOC had come under increasing financial pressure. 

 A senior official said the debt burden of the company had gone up to Rs 24,000 crore in the first seven months of this fiscal from Rs 17,000 crore for the entire 2004-05. IOC wants to reduce this burden. IOC had decided to sell GAIL and ONGC shares, as it needs the cash urgently, he said. 

 Oil regulator

 The government today introduced in the Rajya Sabha the bill to set up a regulatory authority for the downstream petroleum and natural gas sector.

 Petroleum minister Murli Deora said the legislation provides for a statutory status to the regulator and contains specific provisions for the gas sector. The Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board Bill is aimed at regulating refining, processing, storage, transportation, distribution, marketing and sale of petroleum and gas products.

 Grasim net drops 25%

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Jan. 25: Grasim Industries Ltd has reported a 25.43 per cent decline in net profit to Rs 161.87 crore for the quarter ended December 31, 2005 from Rs 217.08 crore in the corresponding quarter a year ago.

 A shortage in natural gas supply and a steep rise in input costs in the sponge iron business have affected the profits of the flagship company of the Aditya Birla group.

 Total income, however, increased to 4.12 per cent at Rs 1,663.44 crore for the third quarter in current fiscal from Rs 1,597.52 crore in the year-ago period, the company has informed the BSE.

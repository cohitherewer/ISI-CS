The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Common man left to do the legwork

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, April 28: While repeat offenders get away scot free, Indian retail investors are repeatedly left out in the cold everytime a scam is unearthed in the securities market. 

 This time around, the man on the street faces the prospect of having to queue up with fresh applications and associated hassles to find suitable replacements for their depository participants (DP). 

 In a clarification issued by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) to the interim order issued yesterday, the regulator has asked the investors with demat accounts with Karvy and Pratik DPs to switch over to another DP within 15 days. 

 Karvy boasts of being one of the largest DPs in the country with six lakh demat accounts across 250 cities and towns. What happens to all these accounts? 

 While it will benefit other DPs, most of the business will again go to the most visible and aggressive ones like Karvy itself, said a DP official. 

 But what about the fees and charges which we have paid to our current DP? Why should we be subject to go through the entire process of filling out forms, giving necessary proofs, signing numerous agreements and making round trips to the office of the new DP? And we have to scramble around to complete all this within just 15 days, asks a retail investor. 

 Officials at National Securities Depository Limited (NSDL) said, We have around 300 DPs registered with us and we give the details of each one of them, including fees charged on our website and the complete procedure of opening a demat account. A retail investor can get all the required information from there. The Central Depository Services Limited (CSDL) also has over 550 registered DPs. 

 A typical demat account opening procedure takes about one to five days and the charges varies across each DP. While some take a one-time fee, others might charge an annual account maintenance fee also, the official said. 

 However, with the norms for opening demat accounts now becoming more stringent... such switchovers might take more than the stipulated 15 days, said the DP official.

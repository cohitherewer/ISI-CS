 Centre weighs curb on ore exports

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 28: The Centre is considering a proposal of the steel ministry to restrict iron ore exports as part of a new policy being thrashed out by the ministry.

 Steel minister Ram Vilas Paswan today told an industry conference here that his ministry favoured restrictions on overseas sales to ensure supply to domestic steel producers. 

 There are serious differences between the ore exporters and steel producers over exports, with even chief ministers and political leaders joining the debate. While exporters demand unfettered sale, the steel producers are lobbying with the government to eventually ban exports. 

 To achieve a 110-million-tonne steel-making target by 2020, we should ensure sufficient quantities of the raw material for the steel producers, Paswan said.

 The Congress-led government favours a middle path, with the prime ministers office (PMO) reportedly considering a compromise formula to cap ore exports.

 Paswan, however, today made a pitch to ban exports of only high-grade ore that he said must be stopped immediately.

 India produces 155 million tonnes of iron ore annually, of which 89 mt is exported, including about 75 mt to China.

A high powered panel, has, however recommended exports 

of iron ore with ferrous content of above 65 per cent but with a tax. The cabinet 

will take a call after assessing the report of the group of secretaries which 

has been asked by the PMO to prepare a position paper on this issue.

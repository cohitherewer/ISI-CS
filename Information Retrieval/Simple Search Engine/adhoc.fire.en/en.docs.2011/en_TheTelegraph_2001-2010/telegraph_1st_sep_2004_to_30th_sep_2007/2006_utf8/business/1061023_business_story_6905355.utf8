 Squabble over crude oil storage site

 S.P.S. PANNU

 New Delhi, Oct. 22: The petroleum ministry has directed Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd, the subsidiary of ONGC, to hand over 80 acres at the site of its proposed petrochemicals complex to build the underground crude oil reserve facility. 

 MRPL is adamant on using the land for petrochemicals and has even obtained the support of the Karnataka government which has told the ministry that the land has been allotted to MRPL for the complex.

 The petroleum ministry, however, has asked MRPL to give the land to Indian Strategic Petroleum Reserve Ltd (ISPL) which will set up the storage facility. ONGC has drawn up a Rs 35,000- crore plan to set up the petrochemical complex as a downstream project of the Mangalore refinery.

 The Karnataka government is also keen to hand over the land to ONGC as it wants this huge investment outlay for the state. 

 The Engineers India Limited has informed the ISPL, which is headed by the petroleum secretary, that the site was ideal for the facility because the rocky area terrain can be blasted out to carve out space for storage. 

 The model for the project is the storage facility of South Korea. 

 The Indian team studied the facilities of several countries before adapting the approach of the Koreans.

 Senior petroleum ministry officials feel the land at Mangalore is best suited for the storage. 

 They feel the project is of national importance and must get precedence over MRPLs petrochemical plans.

 ONGC officials fear the heavy blasting below the ground to carve out space for the facility will affect the foundations of the Mangalore refinery.

 The petroleum ministry had then asked EIL to carry out some underground test blasts in the region and observe the impact on the refinery.

 However, ONGC officials feel no inference can be drawn from the test blasts which was conducted on a small scale. According to them, bigger blasts could affect the structure of the refinery, necessitating a distant site for the facility. 

 EIL and Indian Oil Corporation, which were entrusted with the task of drawing up a feasibility report for the project, had selected the site over a year ago. 

 The cabinet committee on economic affairs (CCEA) in January last year approved the proposal to set up 5 million tonnes of strategic crude oil reserves at an investment of Rs 11,267 crore. It is expected to take nine years to build the storage tanks.

 The facility will be built in Mangalore and Vizag by ISPL, a subsidiary of oil industry development board (OIDB).

 ISPL will implement the project and manage the strategic crude oil reserves. 

 OIDB has the funds from the cess collected from oil companies.

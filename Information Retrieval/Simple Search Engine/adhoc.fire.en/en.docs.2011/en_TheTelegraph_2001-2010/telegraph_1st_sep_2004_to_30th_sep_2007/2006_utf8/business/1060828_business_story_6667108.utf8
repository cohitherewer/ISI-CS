 Heres a premium plan for you 

 Icici 

 prudential life Insurance company has launched a premium 

 guarantee plan, which, despite being a unit-linked insurance 

 plan, guarantees repayment of the sum of all premia paid 

 on maturity or if the policy-holder dies. Insurers offer 

 three investment options in their unit-linked plans growth, 

 debt and balanced. But no one offers a premium guarantee. 

 So whats the trick in ICICI Prus InvestShield Life New plan? This is a balanced fund with 60 per cent investment in debt instruments and 40 per cent in equities. But the plan works more like a fixed maturity plan of mutual funds. The investment in the debt instruments will be made in such a manner that the maturity value equals the total premium paid during the policy term. This takes care of the premium guarantee, while the equity investment ensures capital gain, if any.

 Your sum assured will be calculated as half of the annual premium multiplied by the policy term. For example, if you choose to pay an annual premium of Rs 10,000 for 20 years, your sum assured will be Rs 1 lakh and guaranteed maturity amount will be Rs 2 lakh. 

 On survival of the policy term, you will get a higher of the guaranteed amount (i.e. the total premium you had paid) or the fund value. On death during the term, your successors will get the sum assured, i.e. Rs 1 lakh, plus the higher of the guaranteed amount or the fund value. However, in the first year, only 65 per cent of your annual premium will be allocated for investment. In the second year, the allocation percentage will be 85 per cent and it will be 97 per cent from third year onwards.

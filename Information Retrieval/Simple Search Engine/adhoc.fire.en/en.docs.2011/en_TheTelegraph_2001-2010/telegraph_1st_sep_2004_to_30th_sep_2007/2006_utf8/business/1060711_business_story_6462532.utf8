 Honda sales up 22% in China

 Shanghai/Tokyo, July 10 (Reuters): Honda Motor said on Monday its China sales rose 22 per cent in the first half of 2006 from a year earlier, driven partly by the new Civic, but growth slowed down a faster expansion in the overall market with production running at maximum capacity.

 Honda, the top Japanese car brand in the burgeoning Chinese market, is racing to add capacity with an additional 120,000 units planned at Guangzhou Honda, its joint venture with Guangzhou Automobile Group, later this year.

 That follows a capacity boost in February to 120,000 units from 30,000 units at Dongfeng Honda, its other local joint venture, in central China. By the end of this year, Japans third-biggest automaker will be able to build 530,000 vehicles annually in the worlds second-largest car market.

 In the first six months, Honda sold 143,519 vehicles in China, up from 117,751 units a year earlier. Sales at Guangzhou Honda rose 16 per cent to 123,512 units, while those at Dongfeng Honda totalled 20,007 units, up 73 per cent, Honda said in a statement.

 Hondas sales lagged a 37 per cent jump in overall Chinese car sales to 2.51 million units for the January to June period.

 A Honda spokesman in Tokyo said the first-half sales were within expectations, adding the company was sticking to its full-year sales target of 353,000 vehicles in China, with stronger growth seen in the second half. It sold 257,000 units in 2005.

 Honda in late April added the new Civic sedan to its product line-up, which also includes the Accord sedan, CR-V crossover, and the City and Fit compact cars.

 Rival Toyota Motor Corp, a latecomer to the Chinese market, has said it expects to sell about 300,000 vehicles this year, up 64 per cent from 2005.

 General Motors Corp, Chinas top car brand, posted a 47 per cent surge in six-month sales to 453,832 units, while second-placed Volkswagen AG moved 345,375 vehicles, up 32 per cent.

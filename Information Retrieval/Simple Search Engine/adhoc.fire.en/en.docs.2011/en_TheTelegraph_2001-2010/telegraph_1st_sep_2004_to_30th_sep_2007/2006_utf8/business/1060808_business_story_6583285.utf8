 Banks mull options

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 New Delhi, Aug. 7: After the finger wagging by the finance ministry on rates, banks are inclined towards a fixed PLR matched by higher rates for other lenders and a larger tab on services.

 Top bank officials said banks were free to fix rates for other debtors, depending on their creditworthiness, keeping the prime lending rate (PLR) unchanged. This gives banks the leeway to raise rates for most borrowers other than triple A rated companies, who mostly get loans below the PLR. 

 The lending rates to prime customers are now at about 11-11.5 per cent, up from 10.25-10.75 per cent a few months back. The tab, however, is much higher for other types of loans, with the rates on personal loans and for industry varying between 11 per cent and 16 per cent, while housing loan costs 9-9.5 per cent from just 7-7.5 per cent six months ago.

 Even at unchanged PLR, banks can earn more through higher service charges, bankers said. The policy of a nominal or zero fee on services such as account statements and new cheques needs to be abandoned for a more aggressive pricing strategy.

 A fixed PLR will, however, prevent banks from raising their deposit rates, triggering fears of a cash crunch with credit far outpacing deposits. 

 Deposit rates, varying from 3 per cent for a 7-day deposit to 7 per cent for 5-10 years, are almost unchanged. Though India Inc is opposed to any hike, they might be swayed by a proposal to raise term deposit rates as this will channel money out of speculative assets to more productive investment avenues. Real estate and stock market operators are unlikely to support such moves.

 CA pulls out of TCG venture

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 3: Computer Associates (CA), the information technology management software company, is exiting CA-TCG Software (CATS), its joint venture with The Chatterjee Group (TCG).

 The decision to part was mutual and the financial implications are currently being worked out, said Pravir Arora, a senior CA official. CATS was set up in 1998 with CA having a 51 per cent stake.

 CA, however, will continue its other joint venture in India, with Satyam, focussing on areas like e-learning.

 Exiting the TCG partnership would help CA focus on its development centre in Hyderabad. A section of CATS employees have already moved to the Hyderabad centre, CA officials said.

 Hyderabad is already our biggest development centre outside the US, Arora said. CAs development centre in the US has a headcount of 3,000 while the Hyderabad centre has a strength of around 1,000. Within a year we plan to make it the biggest in the world, Arora added.

 CA is also looking at more development centres and support facilities in India ? it has one in Chennai currently ? as it focuses on the SMEs and Class B cities. From healthcare to BPOs, we are seeing the market open up for SMEs. There are significant opportunities in Class B cities? Weve opened our office in Ahmedabad and are planning one in Pune, Arora offered.

 The New York-based company also sees great potential in Calcutta and Bengal. At present, it has clients for its eTrust security solutions in sectors such as manufacturing, mining, healthcare and the government. 

 Identity and access management (IAM) is a key focus area for CA. The market in India for IAM is $7.39 million with a CAGR of 29.7 per cent up to 2009, Arora said. 

 The company has acquired technology worth $1 billion in the past one year, including companies like Tiny Software, PestPatrol and Netegrity.

 The home segment is also set to feature big in CAs plans. We currently have OEM deals with vendors like Xenitis, HCL and Acer who pre-load our anti-virus software on their PCs. Its minuscule now but we have a lot of plans for home users, Arora added.

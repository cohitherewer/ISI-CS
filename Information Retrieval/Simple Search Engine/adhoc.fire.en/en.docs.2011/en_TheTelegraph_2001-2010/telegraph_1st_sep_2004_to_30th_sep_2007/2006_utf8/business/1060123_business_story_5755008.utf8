 Well-oiled Assam sits pretty

 S.P.S. PANNU

 New Delhi, Jan. 22: Assam has received annual oil royalty of Rs 894 crore, next only to Gujarat, which took home Rs 1,131 crore during the financial year ended March 31, 2005.

 However, disturbed conditions have affected the annual crude output in Assam. The output has remained at 4.5 million tonnes in recent years. 

 ONGC produces 1.2 million tonnes of crude, while the output of Oil India Ltd (OIL) is higher at 3.2 million tonnes in the state. 

 ONGC is producing about 6.1 million tonnes of crude a year from its fields in Gujarat. There is not too much of a difference between the recoverable crude reserves in Assam, which are estimated at 163.68 million tonnes and Gujarat, where the corresponding figure is 173.99 million tonnes. 

 However, the unrest in Assam is a stumbling block in raising the level of oil production. A higher crude output would enable the state to rake in a larger royalty for its development works as well.

 ONGC chairman Subir Raha hopes to increase the companys crude output to 5 million tonnes in the next three years and is ready to allocate Rs 3,300 crore for exploration and development work in the state. However, this depends largely on the law and order situation in the state, he added. 

 The recent extortion letter and the subsequent threats by the ULFA to the oil companies do not augur well for the investment climate in the state. The oil companies will be forced to put their expansion plans on hold if such a situation continues, a senior ONGC official said.

 According to recent data compiled by the petroleum ministry, Tamil Nadu figures in the third spot with Rs 102 crore as oil royalty during 2004-05, followed by Andhra Pradesh with Rs 77.25 crore.

 Arunachal Pradesh and Tripura figure next on the list with Rs 11 crore and Rs 3 crore, respectively. Interestingly, in the case of Arunachal Pradesh the royalty received in 2003-04 was close to Rs 21 crore and this fell to half the amount in the following year. Assam had received a royalty of Rs 703 crore in 2003-04. 

 Rajasthan, where Cairn Energy has discovered some small and mid-sized fields recently, has emerged as the third state with 11 million tonnes of recoverable reserves of oil. 

 Arunachal Pradesh, with 5.21 million tonnes of recoverable reserves, ranks higher than Andhra Pradesh, which has only 4.72 million tonnes in reserves. Nagaland, which has recoverable reserves of 2.69 million tonnes, does not receive any royalty as the companies have not been able to produce any oil due to the civil unrest in the state. 

 The total onland recoverable reserves of oil in the country have been estimated at 369.56 million tonnes. There are also 32.53 million tonnes of oil off the eastern coast.

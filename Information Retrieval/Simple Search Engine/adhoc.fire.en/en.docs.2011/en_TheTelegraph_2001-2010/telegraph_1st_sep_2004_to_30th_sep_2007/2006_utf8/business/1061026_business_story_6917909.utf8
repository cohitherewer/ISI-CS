 Credit risk cover for corporates

 CHANDRALEKHA TULAL

 Mumbai, Oct. 25: India Inc is going global but with newer territories come newer risks. This provides a huge business opportunity for global credit insurers, who are lining up to provide credit insurance and credit management services to Indian companies. 

 Corporate India is growing fast but when one grows at such a pace, they forget to manage the credit. Companies are no longer selling to their known partners but are dealing with unknown customers, said Jerome Cazes, chief executive officer, Coface. 

 A sale is a sale only when it is paid for. World over, it has been witnessed that a bankruptcy occurs because a customer went bust and did not pay up. At any point of time, trade receivables would be the largest component of any companys balance sheet. Thus, it is of utmost importance to monitor credit across the company and its subsidiaries, said Cazes. 

 Coface, Atradius and Euler Holmes account for 80 per cent of the global credit insurance market of 5 billion euros. In India, the credit insurance market is slated to grow more than three times to $140 million by the year 2010. At present, it hovers at $41 million. 

 While the current market size might appear insignificant in comparison with the global figures, it provides us the potential to grow at over 30 per cent for many a year, said Cazes. 

 With that growth as the target, Coface has reinforced its presence in the country and has launched three lines of business, including solvency information, multinational credit insurance cover and political risk cover. 

 Coface provides cover through ICICI Lombard General Insurance and Iffco Tokio General Insurance. Euler Hermes, a member of the Allianz group, has projected a similar business potential for the Indian credit insurance segment. The company has tied up with Bajaj Allianz General Insurance to offer its domestic and export credit insurance products in India. Atradius has a tie up with New India Assurance. 

 The recent sigma study of Swiss Re says, Total premiums for credit insurance were $6.9 billion in 2005 and rapid rise of international trade creates growth opportunities for credit insurance and surety in the emerging markets and in OECD countries. 

 The report says there is a huge potential for export and domestic credit insurance in the expanding Asian and central and eastern European economies. The US market, whose ratio of premiums to GDP suggests that it is less highly penetrated than other major markets, is also expected to grow briskly. In the mature European markets, small and medium-sized enterprises are a promising segment that credit insurers have yet to fully address. 

 In India, companies believe that they know their customers and would rather do their own appraisal before deciding whether to sell on credit. Thus, in India, we have larger number of clients who opt for solvency information on companies and fewer large clients who outsource their credit management to us, said Cazes.

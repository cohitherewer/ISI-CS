 AllBank to set lower credit growth target for this fiscal

 Reorienting priorities 

 New Delhi, May 12: The board of Allahabad Bank is likely to consider scaling down its credit growth target for 2006-07 when it meets on Sunday.

 Sources said the bank is expected to moderate its credit growth to 25-27 per cent in 2006-07 even as it has clocked a year-on-year growth of 35 per cent in advances in 2004-05 and 2005-06.

 Sources said the bank would shift focus on quality of credit from volume of offtake to improve profitability.

 The business, comprising loans and deposits, has crossed Rs 79,000 crore in 2005-06. Credit rose by 35.4 per cent to Rs 30,000 crore and deposits by about 19 per cent to Rs 48,000 crore. The bank is expecting the deposits growth to remain constant at about 20 per cent in 2006-07.

 Besides, the bank is working on a Rs 225-crore core banking solution (CBS) project to be executed by Tata Consultancy Services (TCS). It would eventually connect all the 900-odd branches of the bank spread across the country.

 The bank is also working on a medium-term branch expansion plan. The management has already discussed the plan with the Reserve Bank late last month. It plans to reorganise its branch network and open new ones in the south. 

 Allahabad Bank will also open branches and representative offices overseas. 

 The public sector bank has recently been granted approval to open a branch in Hong Kong ? its first international branch.

 Allahabad Bank has also got the Reserve Banks nod for its China foray. The bank has also obtained permission from the China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) to open a representative office at Shenzhen. The process of opening the office is underway, a company release said.

 With a branch in Hong Kong and a representative office at Shenzhen, the bank will be all set to act as an effective intermediary in the booming trade and commercial linkage between the two Asian giants, a senior bank official said.

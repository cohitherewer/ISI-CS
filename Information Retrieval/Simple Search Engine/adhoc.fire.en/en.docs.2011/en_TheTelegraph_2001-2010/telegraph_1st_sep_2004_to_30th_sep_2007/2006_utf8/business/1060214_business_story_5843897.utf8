 New shares make a debut

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Feb. 13: ICICI Bank today listed its new shares on the stock exchanges. These shares were offered in December to raise over Rs 7,000 crore.

 The new shares, which were traded with the old ones, did not impact the banks share price since it continued with the upswing seen in recent times. On the BSE today, the ICICI Bank shares opened at Rs 605, shot to an intra-day high of Rs 614 and closed at Rs 609.05, gaining Rs 5.60 over its last close.

 ICICI Bank had priced its domestic public offering at Rs 525 per share, which was at the centre of its band. Its American depository share (ADS) offering was, however, priced at $26.75, translating into a price of around Rs 618 a share.

 The domestic issue generated good interest from qualified institutional buyers that included foreign institutional investors and mutual funds. Subscriptions from retail investors stood at 90 per cent of the number of shares offered for this segment. ICICI Bank had announced a discount of 5 per cent to the issue price for retail investors. Therefore, retail investors had to pay a price of Rs 498.75 per share. The issue was subscribed by more than 7.10 times.

 ICICI Bank came out with the offering to increase its capital base to meet the requirements arising from a growth in its assets. The issue was the biggest one made by a domestic company after the ONGC offer of 2004.

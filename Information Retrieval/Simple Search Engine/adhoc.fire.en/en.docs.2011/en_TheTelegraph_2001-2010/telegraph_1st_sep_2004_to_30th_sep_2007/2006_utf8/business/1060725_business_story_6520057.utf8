 Calcutta, July 24: The United Bank of India (UBI) will soon place a proposal before the government to restructure its capital base, which will pave the way for its maiden public issue.

 The board has approved the proposal to reduce the banks equity capital from Rs 1,532.43 crore in June 2006 to Rs 332.43 crore by converting either Rs 1,200 crore into preference shares or Rs 905 crore into preference shares and Rs 295 crore into innovative perpetual debt instrument (which form tier I capital), UBI chairman and managing director P.K. Gupta said while announcing the banks results for the first quarter of 2006-07.

 We will soon send the proposal to the finance ministry and the Reserve Bank of India for approvals, Gupta added.

 We have proposed a 5 per cent fixed dividend for the preference shares and a same rate of interest for the perpetual debt instruments, said another bank official. 

 The bank top brass, however, would prefer the government accepting its proposal of converting Rs 1,200 crore equity into preference capital. The reduction in equity size will help the bank shore up its earnings and book value per share and attract a good premium when it comes out with the initial public offering.

 Last April, the government allowed UBI to write off Rs 278.44 crore loss accumulated by the bank till March 2005 against its share capital of Rs 1,810.87 crore and return Rs 700 crore from its adjusted capital of Rs 1,532.43 crore. The Union cabinet also allowed the public sector bank to convert a part of the Rs 832.43 crore remaining capital into preference shares. 

 But we are not in a position to return capital fund to the government as that will significantly reduce our capital adequacy ratio from 12.38 per cent, Gupta said. The bank has, therefore, proposed to convert Rs 1,200 crore equity capital into preference capital, he added. 

 During the April-June quarter, UBI has clocked a total business of Rs 46,304 crore, a growth of 19.55 per cent over Rs 38,733 crore during the same quarter last year. However, UBIs business grew by only 2.41 per cent when compared with the January-March quarter of 2005-06 (the banks total business on March 31, 2006 was Rs 45,213 crore).

 Deposits during the April-June quarter increased to Rs 29,945 crore from Rs 29,250 crore in the previous quarter, a growth of 2.38 per cent. The banks gross advances in the first quarter of the current financial year vis-?-vis the last quarter of 2005-06 improved by only 2.53 per cent to Rs 16,367 crore from Rs 15,963 crore.

 However, net profit has gone up significantly from Rs 30 crore on March 31 to Rs 70.35 crore on June 30.

 We are targeting a total business of Rs 53,500 crore this fiscal, said Gupta.

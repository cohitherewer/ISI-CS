 Purwar plainspeak on home loan rates

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Purwar: Crystal gazing

 Mumbai, Jan. 16: Those planning to take a home loan, watch out. A rise in interest rates may be in the offing. 

 State Bank chairman A.K. Purwar today said there was an upward pressure on interest rates because of tight liquidity conditions and housing loans could turn more expensive.

 Purwars comment comes only days after the countrys largest bank raised interest rates on deposits. The move had generated speculation that the bank may take a fresh look at its lending rates, particularly at the retail end.

 The SBI chief was speaking on the sidelines of a seminar on Basel II, which was organised by the National Institute of Bank Management, Pune, today. 

 Purwar said liquidity conditions in the banking system was tight because of the redemption of India Millennium Deposits (IMDs). This coincided with a strong demand for credit from the corporate sector, he added.

 Because of the IMD redemption, there is some pressure on liquidity and this is a busy credit season. There would certainly be some sort of upward pressure on interest rates in the short, medium and long term. There could be some impact on the retail side and on housing loans too, he said.

 Purwar, however, clarified he was commenting as the chairman of the Indian Banks Association (IBA) and that SBI has not yet taken any decision on this front. It is for individual banks to take a view, he added.

 SBI raised its deposit rates across the board by 25-50 basis points on January 7. Reports say HDFC may also raise home loan rates by the end of this month. However, chiefs of many public sector banks feel interest rates are likely to remain stable in the immediate term. All eyes are now on the third quarter review of the monetary policy by the Reserve Bank later this month.

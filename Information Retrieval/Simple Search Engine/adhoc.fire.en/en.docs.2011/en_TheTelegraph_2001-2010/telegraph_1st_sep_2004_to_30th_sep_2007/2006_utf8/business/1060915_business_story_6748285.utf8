 IMF sees economy growing at 8.3%

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Sept. 14: The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has forecast an 8.3 per cent growth rate for the economy this fiscal. In April, the Washington-based IMF had forecast a growth rate of 7.3 per cent for the year.

 In its World Economic Outlook that was released today, the IMF, however, sounded caution on the possibility of the RBI raising interest rates again to check inflation which is feeding on a demand surge and higher fuel prices.

 There is the possibility of even faster-than-projected growth, IMF said in the report.

 Inflation has picked up with rising oil prices and strong domestic demand. While the central bank has raised interest rates in recent months, further tightening may be needed to resist inflationary pressures. 

 IMF favours a tight monetary policy to limit inflation even if it puts some marginal checks on growth.

 It said it did not rule out the possibility of the growth rate slipping to 7.3 per cent its forecast in April if interest rates rise and oil prices remain firm. 

 Analysts, however, said the economy would clock a growth rate of 8 per cent in this fiscal.

 Expansion in both the manufacturing and services sectors has led to the economys rapid growth, Nagesh Kumar, director-general, Research and Information System for Developing Countries, said. The IMF is also wary of the high fiscal deficit. Strong spending pressures have emerged, limiting fiscal adjustments in the year 2006-07 after more substantial consolidation in recent years, it said.

 The fund revised downwards its forecast for the US economy to 2.9 per cent from 3.4 per cent. In Europe, growth will pick up this year followed by moderate rise next year. In Japan the economy will expand.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Terms set for Japan rail loan

 S.P.S. PANNU

 New Delhi, Oct. 9: The soft loan from Japan for the Rs 22,000-crore dedicated railway freight corridor, one from Calcutta to Delhi and the other from Mumbai to Delhi, will carry a rider. A large part of this loan would have to be used to buy equipment from Japan.

 Senior government officials said the portion of the loan that would be used to buy equipment from Japan had not been finalised yet. However, the officials indicated that this could be as high as 30 per cent. 

 The Japanese government wants the long-term loan to have a backward linkage with its own economy. It wants to ensure that the railway project in India gives a fillip to Japans industrial production and employment as well.

 The positive aspect is that the Japanese are running a world-class railway system and the locomotives, signalling equipment and rolling stock produced in that country are of a high quality.

 Since switching over to a dedicated freight corridor also entails moving on to a higher technological paradigm, the Japanese technology and equipment would fit the bill, a senior official said.

 However, it is felt that some hard bargaining is required to get the equipment at the right price.

 It is also true that the railways needs funds. The Comptroller and Auditor-General of India has said in a report tabled in Parliament this year that 107 of 133 gauge conversion and new line projects that have been taken up by the railways in recent years are not financially viable. The total outlay earmarked for these projects is Rs 54,716 crore.

 Most of these projects have been sanctioned by various railway ministers on political considerations and the practice continues.

 The Japanese government is carrying out its own feasibility study for the dedicated freight corridor project before extending the long-term loan. The exact amount of the loan will also be decided after this study is completed.

 Sources said while Rail India Technical and Economic Services (RITES) is preparing a detailed feasibility report for the project, the Japanese will not depend on their estimates but will go by the figures thrown up by their own feasibility study.

 The finance ministry has traditionally been against tied low interest aid, which officials feel has always proved to be more costly than normal sovereign guaranteed forex loans.

 In the past, many tied aid proposals were refused. However, with India keen to woo the Japanese both as major investors in the country as well as for support to its ambitions of becoming a permanent member of the security council, the ministry is likely to relent.

 Tide Water off ONGC radar

 S.P.S. PANNU 

 Retail Rattle

 New Delhi, Oct. 15: ONGCs plans to take over Tide Water Oil appear to have been put into cold storage with the new management deciding to focus on upstream oil exploration and production activities.

 Tide Water Oil did fit into the earlier diversified business model of ONGC as it had intended to set up a network of petrol pumps supported by supplies from Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd. This retail chain would have facilitated marketing of Tide Waters Veedol brand of lubricants.

 Since ONGC has shelved its retail marketing plans, it does not make much sense to pursue the Tide Water proposal at this stage, a senior company official said.

 Senior industry officials said, It makes more business sense for downstream oil marketing companies Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum or Hindustan Petroleum to take over Tide Water Oil.

 Veedol is a good lubricant brand and given the vast marketing network of these downstream companies, sales could pick up further, a senior official said. 

 As part of the revival plan for Andrew Yule amp; Co, the government was keen to hive off its subsidiary, Tide Water, to ONGC. When Subir Raha was the head of ONGC, the PSU was keen to take over the company. 

 ONGC had even carried out a due diligence exercise of the company. The petroleum ministry and its heavy industries counterpart had also discussed the issue to arrive at the right valuation.

 Meanwhile, the government has made considerable headway over the revival package for Andrew Yule. A senior official said the Board for Reconstruction of Public Sector Enterprises (BRPSE) has cleared the revival proposal. 

 A cabinet note, prepared by the ministry of heavy industries, has been sent to the finance ministry for its comments.

 The proposal will then be sent for cabinet approval. Senior officials expect the clearance to come through in the next two or three months.

 Tide Water Oil is among the better performers of the loss-making Andrew Yule group. The government has decided to hive it off from the main loss-making company and go for a strategic sale of the company.

 While Andrew Yules stake in the company is 28 per cent, financial institutions such as LIC and United India Insurance own a 14 per cent share. The sale would enable Andrew Yule to get more funds to turn around. 

 The ministry of heavy industries plans to allow Andrew Yule amp; Co to sell its surplus land to raise funds to nurse itself back to health. 

 The ministry feels that two loss-making Calcutta-based public sector companies Andrew Yule and Braithwaite amp; Co should be allowed to sell a portion of their prime real estate on the same lines as National Textile Corporations (NTC) surplus land was sold in Mumbai. The money raised would have to be ploughed back in the same company.

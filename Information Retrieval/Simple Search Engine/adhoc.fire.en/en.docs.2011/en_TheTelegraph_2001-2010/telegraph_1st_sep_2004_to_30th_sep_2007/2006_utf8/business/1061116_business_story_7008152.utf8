 US Air offers to buy Delta

 Ground reality

 New York, Nov. 15 (Reuters): US Airways proposed a $8-billion takeover of bankrupt Delta Air Lines on Wednesday to streamline costs and capitalise on a sector showing signs of recovery. 

 The deal, which US Air said would create the No 1 trans-Atlantic carrier, is the latest move by chief executive Doug Parker, who orchestrated the May 2005 takeover of then-bankrupt US Air by financially healthier America West. 

 Delta, the No 3 US airline, intends to emerge from bankruptcy as a stand-alone carrier, a spokeswoman said Wednesday. 

 Maybe US Airways did a preemptive strike here, Calyon Securities Ray Neidl said. The big concern is government regulators, if they give the green light. And if they do, it will probably set off a series of potential M amp;A activity in the industry. 

 Delta creditors would receive $4 billion in cash and 78.5 million shares of US Air stock with an aggregate value of around $4 billion based on Tuesdays closing stock price.

 This appears to be sort of a hostile takeover, CreditSights analyst Roger King said. Delta CEO (Gerald) Grinstein has made it clear that he doesnt want to merge. But US Airways is appealing directly to the creditors.

 Industry leaders such as UAL Corp chief executive Glenn Tilton and Parker have been outspoken proponents of consolidation, and both have approached Delta in the past about a merger.

 US Air said its proposal represented a 25 per cent premium over the current trading price of Deltas pre-petition unsecured claims as of November 14, and a 40 per cent premium over the average trading price for Delta unsecured claims over the last 30 days. While the stock is considered of little value, creditor claims have monetary value and can be traded by investors. 

 US Air believes that the combination will generate at least $1.65 billion in annual synergies. Parker proposed becoming the CEO of a merged airline, with no decision yet on a location for headquarters. The Delta name would be kept, as its name recognition is better than US Airways, Parker said.

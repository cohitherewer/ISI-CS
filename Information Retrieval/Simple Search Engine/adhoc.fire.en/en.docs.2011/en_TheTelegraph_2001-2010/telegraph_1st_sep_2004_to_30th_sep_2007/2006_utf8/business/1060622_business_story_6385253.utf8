 Aviation scrips beat sensex in days gain

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, June 21: It was the aviation story, all the way. The possibility of the Jet-Sahara deal falling through lifted all four airline scrips, which registered gains of 4-5 per cent on a day when the sensex gained only 2.22 per cent.

 Leading the pack was Jet Airways, which ended the day with a gain of Rs 34.25, or 5.10 per cent, at Rs 705.70 against yesterdays close of Rs 671.45. The stock had jumped almost 6.5 per cent to touch the days high of Rs 715. 

 Strong buying momentum in bluechip stocks saw the sensex overcome the initial pressure and rally to the intra-day high of 10054.05 before closing at 10040.14 against Tuesdays 9822.52, a net rise of 217.62 points or 2.22 per cent. Initially, it dropped to a low of 9752.65 on a cue from weak Asian markets, which later recovered early losses.

 The worst seems to be behind us, but the market is yet to consolidate. However, the daily volumes remain way below average, said brokers. 

 The total turnover on BSE amounted to Rs 2,825.74 crore, lower than Tuesdays turnover of Rs 3,202 crore. 

 SpiceJet was the second biggest gainer in the airlines sector and ended the day with a 5.04 per cent gain at Rs 42.75 against a previous close of Rs 40.70. Jagson Airlines followed with a gain of 4.7 per cent at Rs 27.85 against yesterdays Rs 26.60, while Deccan Aviation gained 3.93 per cent to Rs 90 against Tuesdays Rs 86.60. 

 Analysts and brokerage houses have been crying themselves hoarse predicting the adverse effect the Sahara deal would have on the valuation of the Jet scrip.

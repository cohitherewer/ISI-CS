 Maruti net rises 63%

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 27: The countrys leading carmaker Maruti Udyog Ltd has posted a 63.1 per cent rise in net profit at Rs 369.5 crore during the first quarter ended June 30 against Rs 226.4 crore in the same period last year.

 Robust sales of high-end models and enhanced cost control measures helped Maruti overcome the pressure of high raw material prices.

 Total income (net of excise) stood at Rs 3,268.7 crore, up 20 per cent from Rs 2,723.6 crore in the year-ago period.

 Measures to cut costs, value engineering and higher efficiency in production, apart from favourable yen exchange rate, have helped us increase operating margins in this quarter, said Ajay Seth, general manager, finance, MUL.

 The Maruti scrip rallied on quarterly numbers today. The stock closed at Rs 782.50, up 2.37 per cent from the previous close of Rs 764.35 on the BSE. 

 After witnessing a single-digit growth in volumes last year, Marutis sales, including exports, increased 18.9 per cent in the April-June period at 1,44,948 units against 1,21,866 units a year ago. Sales in the domestic market were up 19.2 per cent at 1,37,104 units.

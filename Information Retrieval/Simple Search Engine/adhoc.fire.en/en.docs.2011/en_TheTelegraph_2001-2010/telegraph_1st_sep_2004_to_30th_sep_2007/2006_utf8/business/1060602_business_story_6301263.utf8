 Wipro snaps up firm in Europe

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, June 1: Wipro Technologies, the global IT services division of the Wipro group, has acquired European retail solutions provider Enabler for 41 million euros ($52.41 million) in an all-cash deal.

 Enabler was set up in 1997 by spinning off a division of Portugals leading retailer, Modelo Continente, owned by the Sonae Group. 

 Enabler offers consulting services to global retailers. It is a leading player in consulting and implementation of integrated solutions. It also offers effective support to retail systems. 

 The company has implemented more than a dozen of Oracle retail formats for a diverse set of clients.

 Enabler, with delivery centres in Portugal and Brazil, has over 300 employees in Portugal, the UK, Germany, France, Spain, Italy, West Asia and Brazil. Last year, Enabler earned a revenue of approximately 30 million euros. 

 Commenting on the deal, Sudip Banerjee, president, enterprise solutions, Wipro Technologies, said, Retail is one of the largest and fastest-growing segments of our enterprise solutions business. Enablers proven track record in the retail domain consulting and package implementation skills will help us strengthen our position as a preferred solutions provider to large retailers globally.

 Senior vice-president Bhanu Murthy said Enabler would enhance Wipros retail knowledge and package implementation expertise, apart from bringing strong relationships with some of Europes best-known retailers and wholesalers.

 This is a win-win partnership where our clients will benefit from Wipros scale, range of complementary services, and the proven global services delivery capability. We are excited about expanding Enablers offerings in retail solutions to Wipros customer base worldwide, said Antonio Murta, CEO of Enabler.

 The transaction is expected to be completed in the next one month. 

 The Enabler acquisition comes days after Wipro Technologies signed a definitive agreement to acquire US-based Quantech Global Services Llc along with its India arm, Quantech Global Services Ltd, in an all-cash deal.

 Global cues guide FIIs action

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, May 18: The finance ministers clarification on FII status could not save the sensex from getting thrashed by 826.38 points on huge anticipatory selloff by foreign funds. 

 The pummelling received cues from abroad in the shape of falling base metal prices and an expected rise in US fed rates. 

 Foreign institutional investors have exposures in both the stock and commodities market. Fall in the commodities market would trigger margin calls and since the FIIs are sitting on huge profits in the Indian market, they will book profits here to cover positions in commodities market, an analyst said. 

 The churn got intensified by the expected rise in the US Fed rates. The possibility of higher rates on safe-haven US treasuries has drawn investors away from riskier assets in emerging markets. 

 Analysts said FIIs had turned net sellers from April with domestic mutual funds picking up the baton to shore up the market. 

 Sebi figures show FIIs were mostly net sellers in April; only a huge inflow of Rs 2,513.80 crore on the last trading session of the month turned them into net buyers.

 FIIs were net buyers in the first week of May. They changed tack on May 11 when they sold shares worth Rs 1,199.10 crore. On May 15, when the sensex shrunk more than 450 points, FIIs sold Rs 728.40 crore of shares. When the sensex gained 344 points yesterday, they lifted Rs 423.50 crore from the market.

 Though the global cues might seem negative, the fundamentals of the Indian market has not changed, said Naresh Kothari of Edelweiss Capital. 

 Now that the finance minister has clarified that the FIIs shall not be treated as traders, the market should start on a positive note and the FIIs should also recover its nerves, quot; added marketmen.

 . So, if the economy continues to grow at a robust rate, capital inflows will continue as investors, either domestic or international will want to be part of the growth

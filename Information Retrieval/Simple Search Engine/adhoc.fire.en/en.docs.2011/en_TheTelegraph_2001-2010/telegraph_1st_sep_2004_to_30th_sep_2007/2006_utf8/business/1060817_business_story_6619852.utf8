 Hutchison posts first profit since listing

 Clear call

 Hong Kong, Aug. 16 (Agencies): Hutchison Telecommunications International, which offers mobile-phone services in nine countries and regions, including India and Hong Kong, today posted its first profit since listing in October 2004. 

 First-half net income was HK $2 million ($257,000) compared with a loss of HK $352 million a year earlier, the Hong Kong-based company said today on its website. Sales rose to HK $15.7 billion from HK $10.8 billion. Hutchison Telecom was expected to report a profit of HK $401 million, according to the median estimate of three analysts in a Bloomberg survey. The estimates ranged from HK $144 million to HK $448 million.

 Hutchison Telecom, controlled by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-Shing, is relying on earnings in emerging nations such as India as growth stalls in its home market. India, which added 15 million mobile users in the first quarter, is expected to triple subscribers to 300 million by 2009, researcher Gartner Inc said.

 The Indian business will be the most critical, said Louis Wong, who helps manage $25 million as a director of PhillipCapital Management in Hong Kong, before earnings were announced. 

 Indian operations

 Even as it is embroiled in a bitter battle with its Indian partner Essar over the merger of BPL (Mumbai) circle, Hutchison Telecommunications posted profits, riding mainly on its fast-growing India operations. Hutchison Essar was the largest revenue contributor with a share of 45.22 per cent out of its global turnover HK$ 15,666 million ($2 billion). 

 The India operations reported a first-half revenue rise of 51 per cent to HK $7085 million (about $1 billion or Rs 4,671 crore) while its customer base doubled to 17.5 million, a 108 per cent year-on-year growth. The EBITDA increased to 46.7 per cent to HK$ 2,316 million (Rs 1,386 crore). 

 Hutchison Telecom has attributed the improvement in its profitability in the first half to strong performances in India and Israeli markets. Hutchison Essar, the groups Indian business, reported excellent results in the first half of 2006. 

 Record customer growth fuelled by Hutchison Essars aggressive network expansion and the introduction of several new tariff plans were the key drivers for growth in the period. 

 Turnover increased to HK $7,085 million, an increase of approximately 51 per cent year-on-year, which mirrored the doubling of the customer base and the integration of BPL operations in Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Kerala (BPL circles) since January 2006, the company said in a statement in Hong Kong.

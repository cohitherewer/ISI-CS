 Luxembourg to clear the air on Mittal

 In demand

 New Delhi, March 19 (PTI): The Mittal Steel-Arcelor takeover tussle has touched upon Indias relationship with Luxembourg, where Arcelor is headquartered.

 Luxembourg, which last month questioned Indias involvement in the issue after commerce minister Kamal Nath criticised the Grand Duchys opposition to the deal, is sending its minister for economy and foreign affairs, J. Krecke, here on March 28 to explain why it opposes Indian-born industrialist L.N. Mittals move to acquire Arcelor. 

 During his two-day stay here, Krecke will meet Nath and steel minister Ram Vilas Paswan, besides finance minister P. Chidambaram, and emphasise that the issue should not spoil ties between the two countries, sources said. He (Krecke) may also meet Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, but the meeting has not yet been confirmed, they said.

 Krecke will explain why Luxembourg is opposing Mittals bid. He is likely to argue that his country was expected to intervene in the bid as it was a shareholder in Arcelor with a 5.6 per cent stake, the sources said. Besides, he may point out that Luxembourg has historical, cultural, sentimental and economic attachment with Arcelor as the ancestors and relatives of every second person in the country has served or is serving in the company.

 The Netherlands-based Mittal Steel has made a $22.3-billion bid for Arcelor, which would create a steel company with an output three times bigger than its three nearest rivals combined. The bid has sparked objections from the governments of Luxembourg, France and Spain and from labour unions, which are worried about job losses even though Mittal has assured that no worker would be shown the door. Mittal cited his operations in various countries which had not resulted in retrenchment.

 The Luxembourg minister will seek to convince the Indian government that Mittals bid did not involve any industrial project and was merely a financial offer. 

 The two sides are also expected to discuss the proposed double tax avoidance agreement.

 Promoters win in share rejig

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Jan. 17: The promoters holding in Reliance Industries has changed significantly in the last quarter due to some major share deals between the promoters and persons acting in concert (PACs). The promoters hold 20.38 per cent in Reliance for the quarter ended December 31, 2005, up from 12.64 per cent in the preceding period.

 During this quarter, the company was busy consolidating the holdings amongst a few entities in the group. Along with their shareholdings, the number of persons acting in concert also came down during the period. 

 From 131 PACs holding close to 34.11 per cent in the company on September 30, the number came down to 92 PACs with a 26.88 per cent stake.

 Reliance saw a flurry of block deals on the bourses recently. The biggest was on December 21 when close to 4.94 crore shares were transacted on the NSE. The size of the deal was over Rs 4,240 crore. 

 Bhumika Trading, Eklavya Mercantile and Ekansha Enterprise, which were listed as promoters and owned just 63 shares each as of September 30, bought up 4.95 crore shares from other group entities in a recent block deal. 

 RIL said the deal was part of an inter-se transfer of shares within the group. Some other PACs also had acquired 8,19,600 shares on the same day. At the end of the third quarter, Bhumika had 4.07 crore shares (2.92 per cent), Eklavya Mercantile 3.78 crore shares (2.71 per cent) and Ekansha 3.26 crore shares (2.24 per cent).

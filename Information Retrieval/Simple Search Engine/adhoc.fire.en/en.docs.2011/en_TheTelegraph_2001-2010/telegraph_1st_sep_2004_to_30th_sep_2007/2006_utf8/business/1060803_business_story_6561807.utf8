 Yahoo stake in marriage portal

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Aug. 2: Yahoo and venture investor Canaan Partners have invested $8.65 million each in BharatMatrimony.com Pvt Ltd. 

 The company refused to divulge the valuation and the equity stakes of the investors; both of whom will be on the board. 

 Veda Corporate Advisors was the consultant to the deal. 

 The infused capital will be used to further sustain our leadership position in the matrimony sector. The investment will also be used to enhance our portfolio of services and take them to leadership positions in their respective sectors, said Murugavel Janakiraman, chief executive officer of the BharatMatrimony group. 

 The group is the leading matrimony service provider with 7.5 million registered members and plans to expand its presence significantly on-ground. It will also invest in the global personals space. 

 BharatMatrimony is the first portal to offer content in six Indian languages. 

 We plan to offer content in two more languages soon. We also expect to double our headcount to 700 by the end of this year and increase the number of BharatMatrimony Centres (BMC), our offline initiative, from 38 to over 300 across the country by 2008, said Janakiraman. 

 The company plans to open offices in the UK and in key South East Asian markets. It also plans to launch religion- and country-based matrimony portals. 

 India is one of the fastest growing Internet markets and our investment in BharatMatrimony furthers our plans to extend our leading position in the country, said George Zacharias, managing director of Yahoo! India.

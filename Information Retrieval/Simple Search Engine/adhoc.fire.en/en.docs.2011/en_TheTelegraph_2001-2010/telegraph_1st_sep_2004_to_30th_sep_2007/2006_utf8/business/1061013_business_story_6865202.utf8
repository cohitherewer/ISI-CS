 Mumbai, Oct. 12: Indian drug companies are gung ho over prospects in China as they gear up to forge alliances with their peers across the Great Wall.

 Jumping on the bandwagon, after multinational giants and Indian major Ranbaxy, are mid-sized outfits, with Granules India today announcing that it has signed a memorandum of understanding with Hubei Biocause Heilen Pharmaceutical Company.

 Granules, a formulations outfit, has acquired a 50 per cent stake in the Chinese company and the joint venture will manufacture and sell active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), starting with the antibiotic ibuprofen. Biocause is one of the worlds largest ibuprofen manufacturer and exporter.

 The Granules-Biocause pact follows Gujarats Torrent Pharmaceuticals acquiring the exclusive marketing rights for India from Chinas Tasly on the latters blockbuster drug, cardiotonic.

 Analysts expect Indian companies to forge closer ties with their Chinese counterparts either through investments in China or marketing arrangements.

 Granules said the physical assets of Biocause would be transferred to the 50:50 joint venture. The plant, located in Jingmen which is in the Hubei province of China, makes ibuprofen, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug. 

 Granules will market the products of the joint venture.

 Biocause is the largest manufacturer and exporter of bulk ibuprofen powder and tablets in China, with a capacity to produce 4 billion tablets. The company also supplies bulk ibuprofen to pharmaceutical companies in as many as 46 countries.

 Tasly rakes in $360 million globally from sales of cardiotonic in 30 countries, including $30 million in the US and $160 million in China where it is the highest selling medicine. 

 Torrent feels it has a potential blockbuster on its hands as it gears up to spice up its topline within two years of the launch of the drug in India. 

 Cardiotonic is an oral droplet formulation, based on traditional Chinese medicine, used in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.

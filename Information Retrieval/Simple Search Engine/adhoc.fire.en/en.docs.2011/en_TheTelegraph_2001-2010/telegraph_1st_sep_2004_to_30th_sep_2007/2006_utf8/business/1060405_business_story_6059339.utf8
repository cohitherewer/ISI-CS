 Arcelor hikes dividend

 Acting pricey

 Brussels, April 4 (Agencies): Arcelor beefed up its defences against bigger rival Mittal Steels $25-billion takeover bid by further boosting payouts to shareholders and ring-fencing assets that Mittal had planned to sell.

 The company said on Tuesday it will increase its 2005 dividend to 1.85 euros per share from the 1.20 euros it previously announced and additionally offered shareholders 5 billion euros ($6.0 billion) in cash.

 Reacting to the Arcelor move, Mittal Steel said, Todays announcement by the board of Arcelor goes against the interests of its own shareholders and is an attempt to deprive them of the right to decide on the merits of Mittal Steels offer. Mittals offer is not dependent on the sale of Dofasco and nothing in this announcement alters our resolve or ability to proceed with our offer. 

 In terms of the proposed increased dividend, we regard any dividend distributed by Arcelor above 0.80 euro as an advance payment on the cash consideration of our offer, which would be adjusted accordingly, Mittal Steel said.

 Arcelor shares, which soared after Mittal unveiled its offer, were trading down 1.8 per cent at 32.20 euros in a slightly weaker overall stock market. 

 Mittal shares were off 2 per cent at 31.63 euros. 

 Arcelor said the cash payment would take place between April 28 and the year following a withdrawal or failure of the hostile offer by Mittal.

 Such payment, which does not include the dividend payment of 1.85 euros, and the terms of which shall be decided later by the board of directors, could take the form of a share buyback, an extraordinary dividend payment or a self tender offer,

 Arcelor said in a statement. Arcelor will also transfer the shares it holds in Dofasco and the rights to Dofascos technology to a Dutch foundation, a move designed to hinder a sale of the Canadian company.

 The foundation would have independent control over any decision to sell Dofasco. 

 Mittal has said that, if it succeeded in acquiring Arcelor in a deal valued at around 20 billion euros, it would sell Dofasco to ThyssenKrupp, the German company that Arcelor outbid in a bid battle for Dofasco.

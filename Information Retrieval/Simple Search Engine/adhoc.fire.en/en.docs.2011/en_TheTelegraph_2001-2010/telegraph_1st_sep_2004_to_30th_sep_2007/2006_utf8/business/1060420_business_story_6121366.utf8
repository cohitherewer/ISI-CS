 Calcutta, 19: April: Mahindra Renault Limited, a 51:49 joint venture between Mahindra amp; Mahindra (M amp;M) and Renault SA of France, would launch the Logan sedan by October 2007.

 M amp;M sources said the car would be positioned in the B/C segment, adding that the price was yet to be fixed. This would mark the entry of M amp;M in the passenger car segment. The company is a dominant player in utility and light commercial vehicles in the country.

 Meanwhile, M amp;M today introduced a new version of the Scorpio targeting the upwardly mobile segment. M amp;M is offering the new Scorpio with 43 additional features at no extra cost for a limited period.

 The company is expecting to log significant growth in sales through the All-new Scorpio, Vivek Nayer, vice-president (marketing) of M amp;M, said.

 The company also plans to launch variants of the Bolero later this year. It had introduced the Bolero SLX a few months back.

 The Bolero is one of our more successful brands and we sold more than 35,000 vehicles last year. It has also been a success in South America where the Bolero Camper is used by the police, said Nayer.

 M amp;M was targeting foreign destinations like South Africa, Malaysia, West Asia and Italy for exports, he added.

 There was no plan to set up manufacturing bases outside India, since the company has already tied up with leading tier-I component suppliers of the world which have set up bases in the country, he said.

 The company planned to double its exports in the current financial year.

 In the utility vehicle segment, the company enjoyed a market share of 12 per cent. Last year, M amp;M sold 1.5 lakh vehicles.

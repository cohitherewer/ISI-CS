 Matsushita eyes plasma peak

 Viewers choice

 Tokyo, July 11 (Reuters): Matsushita Electric Industrial Co Ltd, the maker of Panasonic brand electronics, said on Monday it hoped to start selling the worlds largest plasma television by early next year. 

 Measuring 2.4 metres by 1.4 meters and weighing 215 kg, the 103-inch panel is bigger than a double-sized mattress and almost as heavy as an upright piano. 

 The worlds largest consumer electronics maker has yet to set the price but Matsushitas 65-inch plasma TVs, its largest available now, sell for about $7,500 in Japan. 

 The plasma panel used in the Matsushita TV will be just one-inch larger measured diagonally than a 102-inch model developed by Samsung SDI Co. Ltd. The South Korean company has not launched the model commercially. 

 Matsushita is the worlds largest plasma TV maker competing with smaller rivals such as South Koreas LG Electronics Inc. 

 As liquid crystal display (LCD) TVs encroach on the market for 40-inch TVs and above ? which had previously seen as plasma TVs turf ? developing even larger-sized panels is important for plasma TV makers to remain competitive. 

 Sharp Corporation plans to bring on stream the worlds first plant that cuts LCD panels from eighth-generation glass in October. 

 Eighth-generation glass is bigger than seventh-generation glass now used by Sony and Samsung Electronics in their joint venture, and allows LCD makers to produce large-sized panels economically

 Matsushita also said it had started taking orders for the 103-inch panels in the United States for business use, such as studio monitors at broadcasting companies and electronic billboards, and planned to deliver them from this autumn. 

 Matsushita aims to sell 5,000 units of the 103-inch panels a year, with TV demand accounting for little less than 20 per cent, which can be calculated into annual sales of some 1,000 103-inch TVs.

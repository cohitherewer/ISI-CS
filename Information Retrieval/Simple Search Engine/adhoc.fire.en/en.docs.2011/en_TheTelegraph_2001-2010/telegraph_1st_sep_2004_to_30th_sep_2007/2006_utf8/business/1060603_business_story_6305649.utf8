 Selloff flagged off with Tungabhadra 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 2: In its first attempt to privatise sick state-run companies, the UPA government today gave an in principle approval to a proposal to revive Tungabhadra Steel Products Ltd (TSPL) by divesting up to 74 per cent stake to a private partner.

 A voluntary retirement scheme in TSPL has also been approved. The government feels this will make the company more acceptable to a joint venture partner.

 The joint venture, floated by the Centre, which held 79 per cent equity, and the Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh governments with minority holdings of 9 per cent and 12 per cent respectively, was in a financial mess.

 Numaligarh stake

 The cabinet approved increasing the stake of Oil India in Numaligarh Refinery (NRL) to 26 per cent. It will get a 12.34 per cent stake from the Oil Industry Development Board and 1.31 per cent from Bharat Petroleum Corporation. Oil India will make a total investment of Rs 252.10 crore. The restructuring is expected to help the three PSUs Oil India, NRL and BPCL improve their performances.

 Jute mission

 The cabinet also approved the Jute Technology Mission, requiring funds worth Rs 355.55 crore. It cleared Rs 2.46 crore and Rs 9.75 crore for Mini Mission-I and Mini Mission-II under the JTM for the remaining year of 2006-07. However, the approval is subject to the condition that the ministry of agriculture and the department of expenditure find enough savings from the existing allocation to the ministry.

 The cabinet also okayed allocation of plan funds for technology upgradation, establishment and modernisation of food processing units.

 The cabinet approved setting up of two hydroelectric projects 44-mw Chutak and 45-mw Nimoo Bazgopro in Jammu and Kashmir.

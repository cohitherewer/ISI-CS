 Lukewarm response to bank offers

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Jan. 16: The follow-on public offers of Bank of Baroda (BoB) and Andhra Bank opened to a modest response from investors today. 

 The BoB offer was subscribed by 60 per cent of its offer size, while the figure for Andhra Bank was 56 per cent.

 Data available with the stock exchanges showed that after a rather slow start, investors slowly trooped in. BoB received bids of over 4.29 crore shares against the total issue size of 7.1 crore share.

 Merchant banking circles said investor interest should increase in the days to come.

 Andhra Bank received bids for 4.75 crore shares against an issue size of 8.50 crore shares. BoB has set a price band of Rs 210-230. Andhra Banks price band for its follow-on issue is Rs 82-90 and the minimum bid size has been set at 75 shares.

 Andhra Bank has a total customer base of 13.9 million and 1177 branches, while BoB has 25 million customers and 2,694 branches.

 Post-issue, the governments holding in BoB will come down to 53.81 per cent from 66.83 per cent. The follow-on offering will augment the banks capital base to meet the capital requirements once the Basel II norms come into effect. Moreover, the banks assets, primarily the loan and investment portfolio, are also growing due to the boom in the economy.

 There are other banks waiting to approach the capital markets this year. These include Central Bank of India, Corporation Bank, Indian Bank, Punjab amp; Sind Bank, Uco Bank, United Bank of India and Vijaya Bank. 

 Union Bank of India will soon come out with a follow-on offering.

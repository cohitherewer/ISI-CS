 LOOSE CHANGE

 The Reserve Bank of India has introduced a new series of ?star? banknotes, which will be issued in the 10, 20 and 50 denominations to replace defective notes in various series. The new notes look like the existing ones in the Mahatma Gandhi series but will have an additional character ? a *(star) in the number panel. These notes are being issued as part of efforts to benchmark its procedures with international best practices.

 Tata to visit Patna this month

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, Sept. 8: Tata group chairman Ratan Tata will visit Patna on September 21. He will be the first chief of a big corporate house to visit the city after chief minister Nitish Kumar came to power on November 24 last year. 

 The state investment promotion board has asked its officials to identify investment sectors for the group. 

 Bihar Industries Association president K.P.S. Kesri said the board has already received over 120 investment proposals.

 Twenty proposals, including two pertaining to sugar (Rajshri group) and five multiplexes (Holy Cow Pictures), have already been cleared. Besides, the board has been studying 40 proposals in construction, education, health, agriculture, food processing and IT sectors. 

 The state, enthused by the interest of investors, will host a meet of non-resident Indians next year. 

 While the state government will play a supportive role, bihartimes.com, a Patna-based news portal, and Delhi-based Institute of Human Development will host the meet. The date of the meet will be decided later.

 Bihartimes.com chief Ajay Kumar said, We are committed to package Bihar as a favourable investment destination.

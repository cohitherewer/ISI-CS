 India plans rail link to Southeast Asia

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Dec. 11: India is aiming to establish a 350-km rail link with Myanmar, which will connect the country with the Southeast Asian countries and China.

 Railway board chairman J.P. Batra said the link with Myanmar would be the first step towards the international railway corridor the countries are planning.

 Asked about the status of the Kohima-Myanmar rail link, Batra said India was yet to take a decision about it, but it makes strong business sense to compete in the market. Compared with sea routes, it reduces the time of journey by one-fourth.

 India has taken initiatives with its neighbouring countries to develop global railway corridors in the eastern and western regions to cut down the travel time by sea and to link up various countries up to Russia.

 Batra, who was unanimously elected chairman of the International Union of Railways three days ago, said the eastern international corridor beginning from Kohima would link up Myanmar with Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos on one hand, economically developed southeastern China on the other hand and Russia.

 He said on the western side, India has held talks with Pakistan and other countries in the region to develop rail links to connect with the Middle East Railways. This would boost transhipment of goods and services to the strategic region, he added. 

 There have been talks with countries in the western region. India will automatically get linked with railways in the European Union via Iran, he said. India has already opened two routes, Wagah-Attari and Munabao-Khokhrapar connecting with Pakistan, he added. 

 Batra said while there is a 150-km gap between Kohima and Myanmar, the distance between India and Pakistan at Wagha-Atari border is only 120 km.

 Expected to materialise in three to five years, the eastern corridor linking Southeast Asian countries would become a major trade route in the future as part of Indias look-east policy.

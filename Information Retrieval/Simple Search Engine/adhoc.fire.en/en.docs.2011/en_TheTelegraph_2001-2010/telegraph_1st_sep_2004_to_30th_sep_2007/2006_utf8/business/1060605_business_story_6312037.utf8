opportunities between the spot market and the derivatives markets of equity shares. 

The scheme will also invest a part of the fund in 

fixed-income securities. The new fund offer 

period closes on June 30 and there will be no entry fees during the NFO. 

Change at Chola 

 Chola Mutual Fund has been renamed as DBS Chola Mutual Fund following a change 

in the sponsor asset management company. Chola Mutual Fund was sponsored by Cholamandalam 

Investment and Finance, promoted by the Murugappa group. The group had formed 

a joint venture called Cholamandalam DBS Finance with DBS Bank of Singapore in 

1996. The joint venture now takes over Chola Mutual Fund. All schemes have been 

renamed.

 Kotak Mutual Fund is planning to bring out more close-ended, structured schemes 

under the Twin Advantage series launched recently. According to CEO Sandesh Kirkire, 

the fund house will come out with a second series under its Twin Advantage scheme 

 a balanced fund within a couple of months. It will also launch a 

small-cap scheme soon.

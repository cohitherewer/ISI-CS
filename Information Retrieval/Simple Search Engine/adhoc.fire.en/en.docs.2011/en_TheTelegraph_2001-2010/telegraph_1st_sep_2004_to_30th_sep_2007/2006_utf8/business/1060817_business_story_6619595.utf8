 Opec sees slowdown in demand

 London, Aug. 16 (Reuters): World oil demand will rise more slowly than previously expected in 2006, partly because of record high prices, the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) said on Wednesday. 

 Demand will rise by 1.3 million barrels per day (bpd), 80,000 bpd less than expected in July, the 11-member producer group said in a monthly report. Opec left estimated growth in 2007 unchanged at 1.3 million bpd. 

 Opecs outlook comes as oil is trading at nearly $73-a-barrel, within sight of a record $78.40 hit in July. Oil demand in industrialised OECD countries fell in the second quarter and last weeks alleged aircraft bomb plot may curb air travel, Opec said. 

 The planned attack on airliners in London is expected to dent jet fuel demand, at least in the short run, the report said. High oil prices have somewhat dampened oil demand growth, especially in some Asian countries. 

 Oil is up 20 per cent in New York this year due to attacks on Nigerias oil industry, concern about the row over Opec member Irans nuclear program and worries that the Lebanon conflict may spread in West Asia. 

 The report from Opec, source of more than a third of the worlds oil, points to an easing of the strain on supply in the 84.5-million-bpd world market, analysts said. 

 The fundamentals are finally beginning to deteriorate from the point of view of prices, said Adam Sieminski, chief energy economist at Deutsche Bank. 

 The high prices are beginning to encourage some downward shifts in demand. 

 Prices to remain high

 Even so, world tension and a strain on oil refineries may keep prices high, despite a rise in Opec oil output and production capacity over recent months. These positive developments in the upstream may not be sufficient to moderate crude price levels given the ongoing bottlenecks in the downstream and continuing geopolitical tensions, it said. Opec produced 29.51 million bpd of crude in July, down 230,000 bpd from June, the report said, citing estimates from secondary sources. 

 Except Saudi Arabia, Opec members are pumping at full tilt. Top world exporter Saudi Arabia has cut output in recent months and held supply steady at 9.16 million bpd in July, Opec said. While dropping in July, Opecs production is up from an average 29 million bpd in 2004. 

 Easing pressure on the group, a rise in supply from rival producers will lower the need for Opec oil next year. Demand for Opec crude in 2007 will drop by 800,000 bpd to 28.3 million bpd, the report said.

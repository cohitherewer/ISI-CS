 McNally to form JV with foreign firm

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 3: McNally Bharat, the engineering company promoted by B.M. Khaitan and C.K. Birla, may set up a joint venture for industrial gear boxes with a foreign collaborator.

 Managing director Srinivash Singh said talks were at an advanced stage and a decision would be taken in the next three months.

 The facility will come up at Kumardubi on the Bengal-Jharkhand border. The foreign partner may take up an equity in the project, he said after announcing the financial results for 2005-06 in Calcutta today. The project will require an investment of around Rs 40 crore. 

 McNally Bharat may also look at a licensing arrangement with the foreign collaborator, under which it would only pay a fee for the technology. It could also become an outsourcing agent for the foreign firm. 

 The company will also set up other product manufacturing facilities, especially for the steel sector.

 McNally Bharat plans to set up a unit for airport luggage handling systems at its Bangalore facility.

 Products now contribute 15 per cent of the turnover of McNally Bharat which focuses on project implementation.

 The company has posted an 18 per cent topline growth from Rs 288.07 crore to Rs 332.74 crore. Net profit doubled from Rs 2.62 crore to Rs 5.25 crore.

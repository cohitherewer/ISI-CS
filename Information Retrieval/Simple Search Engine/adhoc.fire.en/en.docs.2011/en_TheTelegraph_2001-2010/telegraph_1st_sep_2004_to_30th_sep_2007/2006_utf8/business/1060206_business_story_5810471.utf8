 Govt issues airport letters

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Ready to take off

 New Delhi, Feb. 5: The government has sent letters to GMR-Fraport and GVK-South Africa Airport combines ? the successful bidders for the Delhi and Mumbai airports ? awarding them the contracts and asking them to furnish a bond guarantee of Rs 500 crore in the next 10 days.

 The letters come a day before Delhi High Court hears the Reliance petition challenging the bidding process.

 The letters dated February 4 have asked the consortia to put Rs 500 crore as performance guarantee into an escrow account.

 The actual contracts will be sent later, said officials. The letters were drafted soon after a meeting was held between civil aviation minister Praful Patel and the striking employees, where a decision to end the strike was taken.

 Officials said with these letters, the process of awarding the contracts have been initiated but not completed. This still leaves scope for the courts to intervene. 

 Reliance had moved the high court last week against what it called arbitrary last minute changes in bid norms. The Anil Ambani-owned Reliance Airport Developers has alleged that the terms and parameters of evaluation and award of tenders were changed at the last moment without sufficient reason or notice.

 Reliance had offered the highest revenue-sharing percentage to the Airports Authority of India (AAI) for Delhi. But GMR-Fraport, the second highest bidder, won the contract after it was allowed to match the highest bid on grounds that it was the sole technically qualified bidder. GMR matched Reliances offer of a 45.99 per cent share.

 Another bidder ? Sterlite-Macquire-ADP of Anil Agarwals Vedanta group ? has protested against its exclusion from the financial bids. The group has claimed that its offer was higher than that of GVK Industries and that the government stood to lose Rs 2,000 crore in revenue share. Civil aviation ministry officials, however, said the consortium was never in the race as it was technically disqualified at the beginning of the bidding process. 

 Sterlite has written a letter to the members of the empowered group of ministers, including defence minister Pranab Mukherjee, who headed the EGoM, seeking the reasons for its disqualification for Mumbai even though it was considered for Delhi.

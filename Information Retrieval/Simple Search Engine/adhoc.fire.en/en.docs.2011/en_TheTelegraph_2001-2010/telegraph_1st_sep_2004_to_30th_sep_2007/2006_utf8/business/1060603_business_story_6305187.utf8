 NYSE beats rival to buy Euronext

 Winning streak

 New York, June 2 (Reuters): NYSE Group Inc struck a deal to buy European bourse operator Euronext for 7.78 billion euros ($9.96 billion), beating out rival bidder Deutsche Boerse AG and putting it on track to create the first trans-Atlantic stock exchange. 

 Termed a merger of equals by the pair, the new company will be called NYSE Euronext and will have its United States headquarters in New York, international headquarters in Paris and Amsterdam and its derivatives business located in London. NYSEs CEO John Thain will be chief executive of the combined group. Pressure has been building on stock exchanges globally to combine to cut costs and increase execution speed. But despite consolidation within Europe and the United States, there has not so far been a major deal linking exchanges in both continents. 

 The race kicked off earlier this year when Nasdaq Stock Market Inc, the No. 2 US equities exchange, bid for the London Stock Exchange, which was rebuffed. It has since built a stake of more than 25 per cent in the LSE, but under UK takeover rules it cannot launch a takeover bid for six months. 

 Under the terms of the deal, Euronext shareholders will have the right to exchange each of their shares for 0.98 NYSE Euronext shares and 21.32 euros in cash. The deal values Euronext at 7.78 billion euros. Euronext will also pay a previously announced extraordinary distribution of 3-euros-per-share. 

 The companies said NYSE Euronext would have a market capitalisation of about 15 billion euros ($20 billion), putting it ahead of futures mart Chicago Mercantile Exchange Holdings Inc, USs biggest publicly-traded exchange valued at about $15 billion. 

 Deutsche Boerse 

 The NYSE unveiled its proposed offer for Euronext on May 22, but faced a competing cash-and-share proposal from Deutsche Boerse worth around 8.6 billion euros that day. Euronext executives favoured the NYSE deal. 

 Deutsche Boerse was not immediately available for comment about what its next move might be. 

 Jan Michiel Hessels, chairman of the supervisory board of Euronext, who will be chairman of the new company, said in a statement Euronexts supervisory and management boards had gone through an extensive process of identifying the best consolidation opportunity for our shareholders, issuers, and users, and we strongly believe NYSE is the best partner. 

 Thain said in a statement, A partnership with Euronext fulfils our shared vision of building a truly global marketplace with great breadth of product and geographic reach that will benefit all investors, issuers, and our shareholders and stakeholders. 

 Thain said earlier on Thursday at the NYSEs first annual shareholder meeting it became a public company in March that a definitive agreement with Euronext would not stop the Paris-based exchange from entertaining other offers. 

 He also said a deal with Euronext could take six months to complete amid regulatory hurdles and possible competition from other bids, but said regulators in the United States and France were supportive of a potential NYSE/Euronext tie-up. 

 In an e-mailed statement, SEC chairman Christopher Cox said, We are working with our counterparts in Paris and Amsterdam to establish a co-operative approach to the type of combination being proposed. We have every expectation that a transaction can take place that will benefit investors in all of the affected countries. 

 NYSE and Euronext said on Thursday they expected to generate pre-tax annual cost and revenue synergies of 295 million euros ($375 million) through the deal. 

 NYSE shares closed 4 per cent higher at $62.45. Euronext rose 2.8 per cent to 68.90 euros. 

 Earlier on Thursday, it emerged that the CEO of NYSEs arch-rival Nasdaq, Bob Greifeld, on Wednesday held a meeting with the chief executive of the LSE, Clara Furse, according to people close to the matteralthough they said that takeover talks were not on the agenda.

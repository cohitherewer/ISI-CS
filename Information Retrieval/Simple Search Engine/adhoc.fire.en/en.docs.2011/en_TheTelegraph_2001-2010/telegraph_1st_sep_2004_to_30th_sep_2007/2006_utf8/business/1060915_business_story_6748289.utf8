 Chennai, Sept. 14: Dell has signed an MoU with the Tamil Nadu government to set up a manufacturing facility at Sriperumbudur at an investment of Rs 280 crore. The plant is expected to begin production by June next year.

 The agreement was signed in the presence of chief minister M. Karunanidhi and Union communications and IT minister Dayanidhi Maran. Rajan Anandan, vice-president of Dells India sales, signed the MoU on behalf of the US company, while Tamil Nadu industries secretary Shakthikanta Das signed it on behalf of the state government. 

 The facility, to come up on a 50-acre land in the Sriperumbudur high-tech park, would initially manufacture desktop computers that account for 70 per cent of the companys current business in India, Dell vice-president (south Asia) Paul-Henri Ferrand said.

 The investment would be made in two phases. About Rs 140 crore will be spent in the first five years, which will be scaled up in the second phase. The plant is expected to manufacture three to four lakh units in the first year, Simon Wong, vice-president, Asia operations, said.

 Kip Thompson, vice-president global facilities, said the facility would initially cater to the Indian market. The pricing of the computers would be cost-effective compared with other branded computers in the Indian market, he said, but refused to divulge further details.

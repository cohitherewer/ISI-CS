 Das Munshi: Fund offer

 New Delhi, July 20: The government today liberalised the scheme to strengthen agriculture marketing infrastructure by allowing state agencies to utilise their funds instead of depending on bank credit.

 The cabinet committee on economic affairs today approved the incorporation of a few modifications in operational guidelines on the central sector scheme.

 Under the existing guidelines for the central scheme on ?development/ strengthening of agricultural marketing infrastructure, grading and standardisation?, assistance was credit linked.

 It was also subject to sanction of an ?infrastructure project? by the specified banks based on economic viability and commercial considerations.

 Under the revised guidelines, state government agricultural marketing boards/ state agencies will be allowed to utilise their funds in lieu of bank loans to finance projects under the scheme, said P.R. Das Munshi, Union minister for information and broadcasting.

 It also decided to allow projects in Uttaranchal, Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir to be eligible for higher subsidies admissible for hill areas, irrespective of the altitude at which a project may be located.

 Hilly area is defined as land situated 1,000 metres above mean sea level. 

 Under the existing guidelines, the rate of subsidy stands at 25 per cent of the capital cost of the project.

 However, for northeastern states, hilly areas, tribal areas and entrepreneurs belonging to SC and STs and their co-operatives, the rate of subsidy is 33.33 per cent of the capital cost of the project.

 With this approval, state agencies will be better enabled to take up infrastructure projects from their own funds by dovetailing the subsidy under the scheme, without borrowing from the financial institution, said Das Munshi.

 He said J amp;K, Himachal Pradesh and Uttaranchal would be entitled to higher subsidy in the on-going scheme for taking up marketing infrastructure projects at all places, irrespective of altitude.

 This would benefit producers at higher altitudes who market their produce from projects located at lower altitude.

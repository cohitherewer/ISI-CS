 EDS keen to cash in on India story

 ARUNDHUTI BAKSHI-DIGHE

 Mumbai, April 2: Its boom time for India and everyone wants a share of the pie.

 The latest in line is Electronic Data Systems Corp (EDS), which plans to make capital expenditure worth $35 million in India during the financial year 2006. The bulk of the investment will go into beefing up its Pune and Chennai centres. Both these centres will eventually be the hub of information technology outsourcing, business process outsourcing (BPO) and application management and delivery capabilities. 

 We plan to create a campus environment in both these places, said a company spokesperson. The Pune centre will concentrate mostly on BPO and application delivery, which encompasses creating and maintaining software for IT applications. The Chennai centre will concentrate more on information technology outsourcing.

 The India story seems to have attracted the worlds second largest technology services company so much that the country has climbed to the top of its list of global best shore initiative. Most of our global clients are looking at best quality work at low cost. The global best shore initiative basically helps us identify such destinations. India tops the chart of our best shore initiative worldwide followed by China, Latin America and eastern Europe, he added.

 The company has also, for the first time, hired 13 management graduates from Indian School of Business (ISB), Hyderabad. They will be part of its global management programme. Eight of them will join the company at senior consultant levels at its headquarters in Plano, Texas. The rest will join as consulants.

 EDS is estimated to earn about $1.2 billion per year from a majority share of the five-year, multi-billion-dollar General Motors (GM) systems integration services contract. EDS has recently won approximately 70 per cent of the contracts it pursued, worth $3.8 billion over five years. With this agreement, plus another business that was not part of the recompete deal, EDS now expects $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion in annualised revenues from GM over the next five years.

 Begun in 2004, the GM recompete was the largest commercial contract bidding process in the history of the IT industry.

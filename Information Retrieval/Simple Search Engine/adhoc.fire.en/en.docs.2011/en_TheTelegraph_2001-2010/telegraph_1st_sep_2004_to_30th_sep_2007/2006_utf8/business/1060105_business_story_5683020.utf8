 Mahindras forge UK buyout

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Jan. 4: Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd has acquired a 98.6 per cent stake in Stokes Group Ltd, the largest automotive forging company in the United Kingdom.

 The deal-size was not disclosed, though it is understood to be an all-cash transaction. The Stokes Group includes three companies with two manufacturing firms situated at Walsall and Dudley, near Birmingham.

 According to Mahindra and Mahindra (M amp;M), major customers of Stokes are Koyo Bearings, GWK Group, Land Rover, ZF, Bosch, Benteler, Visteon, Ford and Jaguar. The group reported a turnover of ?25 million for the year ended December 31, 2004.

 M amp;M said the acquisition would strengthen Mahindra Systems and Automotive Technologies (MSAT). 

 MSAT aims at offering a full range of services from design-to-delivery covering engineering services, strategic sourcing of components and supply of auto components, the company said in a statement.

 Hemant Luthra, MSAT president, said the deal would offer multiple benefits to shareholders of MSAT and Stokes.

 While customers in Europe will continue to get high-quality product from a better capitalised supplier at an economic rate, the Indian customers will get access to world-class technology.

 Both will benefit from the design capabilities of Mahindra Engineering Services that can accelerate product development, he added.

 Luthra said the senior management of Stokes will continue under the M amp;M umbrella and their expertise will be used to enhance the quality of its domestic forging business.

 Anand Mahindra, M amp;M vice-chairman and managing director, said, We believe the Stokes acquisition demonstrates our commitment to build a world-class business that serves its global customers and enhances value for M amp;M stakeholders. 

 Khaitan amp; Co and Sherrards Solicitors, UK, were legal advisers to M amp;M for the deal.

 Miffed Corus investor starts diluting stake

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Calcutta, Nov. 10: Standard Life Investment, the largest shareholder in Corus Group Plc, has diluted its stake for the first time after Tata Steel announced its offer for the Anglo-Dutch steel maker on October 17, signalling waning resistance to the bid.

 Standard Life was the only vocal shareholder who publicly issued a statement, airing dissatisfaction over the Tata offer of 455p a share.

 The investment company, which manages funds worth 124.8 billion, had a 7.9 per cent stake in Corus. 

 Today, it offloaded 3,47,154 shares on the London Stock Exchange at 4.69812 per share.

 The development gains significance as Corus today sent out the offer documents to shareholders detailing the timetable for the successful completion of the Tata deal by the end of January next year.

 The Corus scrip has been trading higher than the Tata offer ever since the Indian steel maker disclosed its intention of buying the Anglo-Dutch company. The stock closed today at 471p or 3.5 per cent higher than the Tata offer.

 Persistent rumours of possible counter-bids from rival groups like German steel maker Thyssen Krupp and Brazilian company Cia Siderurgica Nacional had kept the price firm.

 When contacted, Standard Life spokesperson declined to comment on the development.

 There has been no change in our stance from what we said on October 20, a company spokesperson said.

 Standard Lifes move comes close on the heels of a few other institutional investors who have been offloading Corus shares in the market, cashing in on the higher market price.

 Alliance Bernstein, Barclays and Jupiter Asset Management have already cut their stake in Corus.

 Alliance, which is the fourth-largest shareholder in Corus, sold 28 million shares since October 6, thus reducing its stake to just 0.9 per cent from 5.2 per cent. Barclays Plc, the companys second largest shareholder after Standard Life, has cut its holding to 4.7 per cent from 6.4 per cent by selling 15.3 million shares. Aviva exited Corus on Wednesday. 

 Incidentally, Tata Steel managing director B. Muthuraman had recently said the response from Corus shareholders was positive. 

 Standard Life had said the 455p per share offer by the Tatas for Corus was lower than expected.

 More suitors may emerge for Corus

 OUR BUREAU AMP; AGENCIES

 Oct. 18: Tata Steel may have to raise its offer price for Corus, analysts said, as reports of possible counter bids swirled with Brazilian steel maker Companhia Siderurgica Nacional (CSN) widely tipped to make an offer.

 The Metal Bulletin cited a source close to Corus saying that the Brazilian company was waiting in the wings to launch a bid for Corus.

 Tata Steel yesterday said that it has offered 455 pence a share to buy 100 per cent of Corus and it is in talks with the Corus management on the issue. The indicative price was at a 5 per cent discount to the closing price at the London Stock Exchange.

 The Tata Steel bid valued Corus at $7.6 billion.

 Corus previously had called off a multi billion pound merger proposal with CSN, which has the controlling stake in the worlds largest iron ore exporter CVRD.

 Besides CSN, Russian steel maker Severstal and Novolipetsk may also make an offer, though there is no confirmation in this regard. The two companies had previously evinced interest in Corus.

 If there is a counter bid, Tata Steel may have to increase its bid price. Initial reports had suggested that it would pay 5.8 a share when the news first broke out in the British media earlier this month.

 The speculation of a counter bid has spiked the Corus stock on LSE. At the time of going to press, the share was trading at 4.87, up by 8 pence over yesterdays closing.

 Tatas Corus gambit follows the steel leader Mittal Steels ambitious takeover of the then number two Arcelor. Mittal Steels bid, even though a hostile one, had to be sweetened to win shareholders support. 

 The Tatas, who are also trying to consolidate like Mittal, may have to do the same.

 The acquisition of Corus will help Tata Steel reach its target of 30 million tonnes by 2015 fast since most of its greenfield projects are yet to take off.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Hero flops, market awaits Infy heroics

 - Bike companys lower-than-expected profit upsets mood, serial blasts to add to woes

 OUR BUREAUX

 July 11: The stock markets stumbled at the start of the earnings season today with Hero Honda Motors ? the countrys leading two-wheeler manufacturer ? disappointing with a lower-than-expected 16.2 per cent rise in net profit for the quarter ended June 30, 2006 at Rs 237.74 crore.

 The sensex swooned almost 70 points to close at 10614.35 on extremely low trading volumes.

 Marketmen were looking to Infosys ? the prima donna among information technology companies that traditionally kickstarts results from the technology pack ? to report resounding results tomorrow.

 But the chances of a recovery receded sharply after the series of bomb blasts rocked the commercial capital and sent a frisson of fear through Mumbai. This will almost certainly weigh heavily on the market when it opens for trading on Wednesday.

 Market pundits fear that there could be a knee-jerk fall of at least 150 points as sentiments will be affected. 

 How the markets behave tomorrow, will be a function of how the world markets behave and what Infosys has to tell us. However, though Infosys numbers or their guidance will be positive, in the early part of trading, it will be taken negatively due to the prevailing sentiment. The blast will certainly have an impact earlier on, said V.K. Sharma of Anagram Stock Broking.

 Enam Financial Services, the brokerage, expects Infosys to report a net profit of Rs 712.5 crore, a growth of 34 per cent over Rs 531.5 crore recorded in the corresponding period last year. Infosys has given a topline guidance of Rs 2,793 crore to Rs 2,816 crore. However, Enam expects the company to post a topline of Rs 2,853 crore.

 Hero Honda, which had reported a net profit of Rs 204.45 crore in the corresponding period last year, blamed an increase in input cost as the main cause for the lower-than-expected profit. 

 The news sent the companys share prices skidding by 6 per cent to Rs 720.45 in a weak market after falling at one stage to as low as Rs 713.30.

 Turnover during the period increased to Rs 2,416.65 crore from Rs 2,007.63 crore in April-June 2005, recording a growth of 20.5 per cent.

 Significantly, operating margins for the company dropped to 13.5 per cent in the April-June 2006 quarter from 16.1 per cent in the previous quarter.

 Price hike planned

 Hero Honda, which has about 40 per cent of Indias market of 6 million motorcycles a year, said it would raise prices by this month-end to offset the increase in input costs.

 This is the first time in five years that the company will raise prices despite facing stiff competition from rivals Bajaj Auto Limited and TVS Motor Company. 

 Pawan Munjal, managing director of Hero Honda, however, refused to specify the quantum of the hike or the models which would see the price increase.

 Munjal said the hike in motorcycle costs would see margins recover in the third and fourth quarter, though overall margins were likely to be subdued this fiscal. 

 However, he expected overall sales to rise by a healthy double digit for the full fiscal with good sales in the third and fourth quarters. 

 Meanwhile, analysts say that the second quarter is usually sluggish for vehicles because of the monsoon, while the concern is that vehicle manufacturers may not be able to manage margins, especially with the growing competition and the aggressive product launch plans.

 Hero Honda sold 832,692 units in April-June, up 21 per cent from a year earlier. The company, which last month launched the countrys first bike to feature a fuel-injection engine, is also considering a fourth plant if necessary.

 Debt recast, VRS pills to revive Hind Cables

 S.P.S. PANNU 

 New Delhi, Sept. 10: The ministry of heavy industries has prepared a plan to revive the ailing Hindustan Cables Ltd (HCL) through debt restructuring and a voluntary retirement scheme (VRS).

 The Board for Reconstruction of Public Sector Enterprises (BRPSE) would discuss the proposal this week, a senior official told The Telegraph. 

 Sources said the department of telecommunications (DoT) was yet to respond to another proposal of the ministry for a tie-up with BSNL or MTNL that would provide HCL the comfort of a bulk order to overcome its present crisis.

 An official said HCL owes Rs 600 crore to banks and Rs 250 crore to the government. HCLs net worth has turned negative many times over, the official said. 

 The proposed restructuring package seeks to waive a substantial portion of its loans, while the VRS aims to considerably prune down the number of its employees, which is 3,000 now, to reduce the expenditure on salary and wages. HCL was set up in 1952 to manufacture and supply telecom cables. It has expanded to become a multi-product entity with facilities at Rupnarainpur in Bengal, Hyderabad and Allahabad. HCL took over the machine tools facility of Cycle Corporation of India in 1984 in Bengals Narendrapur.

 However, since the reforms in 1991, HCL was often at the receiving end of the intense competition from global majors such as Siemens, Alcatel, Fujitsu and AT amp;T in the tenders of BSNL and MTNL. There were also complaints of the company failing to meet its delivery schedules. 

 HCLs main products are jelly-filled and fibre optic cables. It has a capacity to produce 120 lakh conductor kilometers of jelly-filled cables. 

 The manufacturing capacity for fibre optic cables is 40,000 fibre kilometers per annum.

 The company has also set up a manufacturing capacity of 2.5 million sets of telephone cords and computer cords at Rupnarainpur.

 IOC chemical hub hinges on new port

 Dock deal

 Calcutta, Sept. 27: Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) has linked the viability of the chemical special economic zone (SEZ) in Haldia to a new deep-sea port in the region. 

 The company today signed a memorandum of agreement (MoA) with the Bengal government to become the anchor investor of the chemical SEZ, which will span 10,000 acres.

 IOC will set up a 15-million-tonne (mt) refinery at an investment of Rs 15,000 crore in the SEZ.

 However, IOC believes a deep-sea port capable of handling large crude carriers is essential for the viability of the refinery.

 Since a refinery is the mother unit for the chemical and petrochemical facilities in the SEZ, the project hinges on the port.

 Big ships cannot dock at the existing port in Haldia because the Haldi river at the port is not sufficiently deep to permit navigation. 

 To overcome the problem, IOC is setting up a pipeline from Paradip to transport crude to its existing refinery in Haldia.

 However, IOC feels the sheer scale of operations in the proposed SEZ rules out the possibility of ferrying crude from Paradip.

 Bengal has been lobbying with the Centre for assistance to build the port, and chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had recently discussed the issue with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.

 However, a port is still a long way off. The Centre is yet to appoint a consultant for the feasibility study that itself will take one-and-a-half years. Building the port will take up another five years.

 The state government is pushing for integrated development of the entire Haldia region, industry minister Nirupam Sen said.

 We are building a Petroleum, Chemical, Petrochemical Investment Region (PCPIR) at Haldia. We will formally name it after scientist APC Roy. Three SEZs and the existing Haldia town will be part of the PCPIR, he said. The PCPIR will cover 250 square kilometres.

 As the PCPIR takes shape, IOC and the Bengal government will do a study on the proposed refinery.

 A joint co-ordination team will monitor the progress. According to the MoA, Bengal will provide land free of any encumbrances to Indian Oil.

The MoA is for a year and can be extended by mutual 

consent. The MoA would be converted into definitive agreements over the next two 

years.

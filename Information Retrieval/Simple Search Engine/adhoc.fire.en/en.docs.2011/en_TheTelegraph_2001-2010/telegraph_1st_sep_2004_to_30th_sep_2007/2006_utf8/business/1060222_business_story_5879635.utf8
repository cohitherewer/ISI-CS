 Tata Tea stirs China potion

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Kumar: Looking ahead

 Calcutta, Feb. 21: Tata Tea plans to set up a greenfield project in China in the tea and beverage space, even as it continues to pursue acquisition opportunities in North America.

 Tata Tea vice-chairman R.K. Krishna Kumar said a decision on the Chinese foray could be taken within the next six months. Even though he did not spell out the details, Tata Tea could zoom in on a new segment where it is not present so far. 

 Traditionally, China has a strong domestic green tea market. Tata Tea, however, is likely to explore the tea derivative segment.

 While a strategy for China is being readied, the company is on the lookout for more acquisitions in North America. It bought Good Earth Corporation of the US in October.

 Earlier, the company had said it could strike an acquisition deal worth $1 billion.

 Kumar said the company Tata Tea was eyeing has been bought by a clutch of private equity investors through a complex deal.

 However, we are still pursuing it, he added. 

 In this connection, Kumar said Tetley negotiations had started in 1995 and the deal was completed in 2000.

 However, the greenfield project in China is in addition to the companys acquisition plan, the cost of which would roughly amount to $1 billion.

 It will be our endeavour to step up the global footprint of the company, Kumar added.

 The demand for herbal and speciality varieties has grown over 50 per cent in the last four years in the UK and the growth rate was nearly 8 per cent in the US, double the growth in regular tea.

 Plantation business

 Tata Tea will withdraw from the plantation business in Sri Lanka and north India. It is likely to follow the same model used for exiting from the south Indian plantation operations.

 Unlike in south Indian operations, the company will own less than 20 per cent of the new plantation entity, said Kumar.

 Tata Tea had transferred 17 tea estates in south India to a private limited company formed by employees.

 The company initially gave employees of the Kerala operations two options. They could either form co-operative societies, which would run the estates, or the managers could opt for executive buyouts.

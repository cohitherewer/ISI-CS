Bengal stirs strong brew

 A STAFF REPORTER

Siganporia: Testing time

 Calcutta, Sept. 23: The Bengal government will not allow random use of tea garden land and property for other purposes.

 The tea industry has approached the state government with a proposal to allow it to grow other crops or use the gardens for promotion of tourism. The use of land for any other purpose will require prior approval of the government.

 We are aware of this issue. But there cannot be any general rule. The government will consider each case individually on its merits, M.V. Rao, director of industries, said.

 Speaking on the sidelines of the annual general meeting of the Indian Tea Association (ITA) in Calcutta on Saturday, Rao said employment is a critical issue the government has to keep in mind.

 Tea companies have placed their demand before Bengal and Assam. ITA chairman Percy Siganporia said both the governments were sympathetic to the proposal.

 Industry sources claimed that high cost of operations and non-remunerative prices have rendered tea plantation business unviable at many gardens and there is a need to search for new revenue streams. Incidentally, India is the highest cost producer of tea. Tourism and real estate, among others, are widely seen as those options. 

 However, the approval process is going to be a long drawn one. The land is leased to the tea gardens for the specific purpose to grow tea. 

While ITA is hopeful of a positive bias from the state 

governments, the immediate concern for the industry is the contour of the Special 

Purpose Tea Fund (SPTF).

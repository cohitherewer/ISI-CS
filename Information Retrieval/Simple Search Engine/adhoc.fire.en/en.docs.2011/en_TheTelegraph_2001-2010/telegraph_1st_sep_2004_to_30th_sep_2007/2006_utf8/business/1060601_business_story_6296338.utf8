 Weak spots in growth grandeur

 Chidambaram: Fault lines

 New Delhi, May 31: Finance minister P. Chidambaram today listed mining and power as party poopers and said more reforms are needed for a faster growth. The Prime Minister would meet key ministers to work out reform packages for these two sectors, he added.

 The mining sector grew by a mere 0.9 per cent in 2005-06 against 5.8 per cent in the previous year, even as the overall economy grew by 8.4 per cent. Sources said moves were on for a reform package to allow FDI in coal and iron ore mining, besides changes in the electricity act.

 Mining and power sectors, which grew by 3 per cent and 6.1 per cent, respectively, in the January-March quarter, are being seen as weak spots which Chidambaram described as great disappointments.

 I will meet the Prime Minister (Manmohan Singh) and will discuss the issue for more reforms in mining and electricity, he said. I have flagged mining as a sector where wider and deeper reforms are required, he added.

 There has been hectic lobbying by multinationals keen to bring in 100 per cent FDI in mining and by domestic firms that want scarce minerals to be used within the country instead of being exported. This has forced the government to set up a high-level committee to review the National Mineral Policy and recommend possible amendments to the Mines and Minerals Development and Regulation (MMDR) Act, 1957.

 Mittal Steel and Posco want both iron ore and captive coal mining to be opened up to 100 per cent FDI. They also want the mining to be done by companies which need not own the steel plants to which the ore from the captive mines is supplied.

 Domestic firms like Tata Steel and SAIL want exports of scarce resources like high-grade iron ore to be banned.

 Their contention in private conversations has always been that MNC steel mills and others are promising to set up plants here simply because they want to export some of the high-grade iron ore back home.

 Cheap exports of high-grade iron ore to Japan have long been a sore point with steelmakers in India.

 New Delhi, July 21: Bankers expect Reserve Bank governor Yaga Venugopal Reddy to raise short-term interest rates when he reviews the quarterly monetary policy on Tuesday. 

 However, they feel the cash reserve ratio and statutory liquidity ratio will not be changed. Canara Bank chairman M.B.N. Rao said the market expects a 25 basis points hike in the repo rate. But the RBI may not change the cash reserve ratio and statutory liquidity ratio, he told reporters after the bankers meeting with finance minister P. Chidambaram here today. (Repo and reverse rates are those at which the RBI lends and buys bonds vis-a-vis commercial banks, to park their excess liquidity overnight.)

 The RBI should ensure enough credit to the productive sectors and take measures to contain inflation. Interest rates are under pressure and the future rate revision will depend on the deposit growth, world oil prices as well as the growth in economy, Rao said.

 I expect the RBI to raise repo and reverse repo rates by 25 basis points during the credit policy review, said Oriental Bank CEO K.N. Prithviraj. 

 Interest rates are hardening as the growth in deposits is not keeping pace with loan portfolio, Prithviraj said.

 Steel stocks make merry 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Jan. 27: Steel stocks were on fire today after Mittal Steel announced a hostile bid for Arcelor. Hectic buying by foreign and domestic funds triggered by firm global stock markets, including the Dow and Nasdaq, added to the frenzy and the sensex gained a whopping 185 points.

 The sensex started the day with a record high of 9764.26 points against Wednesdays close of 9685.74 and continued its upward march to touch a lifetime high of 9883.95. It finally settled at a new closing high of 9870.70, up 185.05 points or 1.91 per cent. For the week, the BSE sensex gained 3.7 per cent. It has risen by 406 points or 4.29 per cent in the last three trading sessions.

 The sensex gained 136 points to set a new record on January 25, the last day of the derivatives contract.

 Other sectors, including aluminium, auto, banking, engineering, also took part in the rally. However, some FMCG, pharma and software stocks ended lower. 

 Analysts feel expectations of a hike in steel prices coupled with Mittal Steels bid for Arcelor seems to have charged up the steel sector. 

 The BSE metal index outperformed the other indices and closed up 4.96 per cent at 7024.51 as stocks, including Jindal Stainless, Tata Steel, Jindal Steel, SAIL, JSW Steel, Nalco and Sterlite Industries, flared up. 

 The market is expected to touch 10000 in the coming week, riding on the high FII inflow and positive sentiment prevailing in the market, said Motilal Oswal, chairman of Motilal Oswal Securities. 

 The total market turnover today was Rs 34,048.56 crore, while the BSE cash turnover was Rs 4,580.53 crore. 

 Among the bank stocks, SBI, ICICI Bank and Punjab National Bank gained ground, while in the auto segment, Bajaj Auto, Maruti and Hero Honda faired well. 

 The overall market breadth, however, was in favour of declines, which outnumbered advances in the ratio of 1.3:1 on the BSE, which clearly suggested that the buying was entirely concentrated on the index stocks.

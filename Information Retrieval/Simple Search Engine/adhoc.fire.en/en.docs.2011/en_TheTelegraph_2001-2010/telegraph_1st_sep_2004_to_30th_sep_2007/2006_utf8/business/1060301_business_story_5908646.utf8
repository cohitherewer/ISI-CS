 Tea fund raises cup of cheer for firms

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Feb. 28: The patience and perseverance of four years have borne fruit for the tea industry with the commerce ministry planning to set up a special purpose tea fund. The government has pledged a Rs 100-crore support to the fund for this fiscal.

 This was announced as part of finance minister P. Chidambarams budget speech.

 The finance minister also said the initial amount of Rs 100 crore would be followed up by levelised contribution from the Centre every year, which would benefit the tea growing states of Asom, Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Uttaranchal. The Indian Tea Association (ITA) welcomed the proposal to start off the fund with a corpus of Rs 100 crore. It especially appreciated the commitment made by the government to make a levelised contribution annually for the 15-year programme for replantation and rejuvenation.

 After four years struggle, this comes as the governments acknowledgement of the issues plaguing the tea industry. Its a good start, said B.M. Khaitan, chairman of McLeod Russel India Limited. 

 Around 2.12 lakh hectares require replantation or rejuvenation with the cost of replantation being Rs 2.60 lakh per hectare with rejuvenation costs being a little lower, said Monojit Dasgupta, general secretary of ITA. 

 The association feels the governments commitment to the special purpose fund would make it possible to raise funds from commercial banks and financial institutions.

 The budgetary provision for infrastructure in the Northeast, doubling from Rs 346 crore to Rs 600 crore, would reduce the time taken to transport the processed tea to the market, said Gautam Bhalla, executive director of Warrren Tea. The ITA is concerned with the widening of the service tax net to include auctioneering/ broking services. This could substantially increase the cost of buying tea from auctions.

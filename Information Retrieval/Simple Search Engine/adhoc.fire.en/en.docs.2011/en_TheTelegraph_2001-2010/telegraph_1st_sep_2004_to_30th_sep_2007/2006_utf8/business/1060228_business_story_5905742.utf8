 National Grid to snap up KeySpan

 New owner

 London, Feb. 27 (Reuters): Britains National Grid Plc has agreed to buy US natural gas distributor KeySpan Corp for around $7.3 billion in cash in a major tie-up it says can generate savings of $200 million a year.

 The UK power-network and gas-pipeline operator said on Monday the deal to buy the fifth biggest gas distributor in the United States also involved taking on $4.5 billion of debt.

 It hopes to close the deal, which comes less than a year after it sold half its UK gas-distribution assets for ?5.8 billion, raising money to return 2 billion to shareholders and invest in US markets, early next year. It expects the deal to enhance earnings in the first full year.

 National Grid has long planned to expand in the US north east, and the move comes only two weeks after it agreed to buy the Rhode Island utility assets of Southern Union Co for nearly $500 million.

 The British company said it was buying New York-based KeySpan for $42 cash per share and would fund the deal from borrowings. The stock closed at $41.41 on Friday.

 KeySpan is a natural extension of our business and our strategy. It fits strategically, operationally and geographically, National Grid chief executive Roger Urwin, who retires at the end of this year, said.

 National Grid said cost savings of $200 million, half of which it expects to make after the first year, would come from reductions in back-office overlap and IT cost savings.

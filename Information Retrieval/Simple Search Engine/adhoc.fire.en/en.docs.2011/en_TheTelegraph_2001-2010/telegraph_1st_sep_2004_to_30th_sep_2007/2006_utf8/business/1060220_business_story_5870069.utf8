 Betapharm tonic for DRL stock

 Dr Reddys was one of the few scrips that withstood the carnage in the market on Friday and the stock is up 25 per cent in the last one month. The Betapharm acquisition has given a huge boost to the stock.

 The acquisition is seen as an expensive one, with reports varying from the price being 2.9 times to 4 times sales. The Betapharm website, however, puts the companys turnover at 186 million euros in 2005 - that puts the price at 2.58 times the turnover. Even if the multiple is higher, it really reflects the going price for German generic companies. Recall that Novartis paid a price of four times sales for its acquisition of German generics major Hexal a year ago.

 Of course, Hexal is a much bigger company than Betapharm.

 The advantages to Dr Reddys are numerous. Margins in the US generics business continue to remain under pressure, as seen from the recent third-quarter results. Sales in the US in the third quarter were down 58 per cent year-on-year. The entry into the German generics market will be a much-needed diversification.

 Next, with healthcare reforms in Germany, opportunities for generics companies have increased. Also, a use has finally been found for the cash sitting on the companys books. Betapharms margins are much higher than Dr Reddys and the acquisition is likely to be earnings accretive soon in spite of higher finance costs - the acquisition will increase Dr Reddys operating profits by two-thirds. 

 New patent expiries will also expand the generics market. And there exist immense opportunities for margin expansion by taking advantage of Dr Reddys low-cost manufacturing base.

 More importantly, the company is now being seen as a pro-active one, after the de-risking of its earnings stream by transferring its R amp;D costs to JVs and its current aggressive stance on acquisitions.

 Tea companies

 Tea stocks are on fire. In the last month, McLeod Russel is up 90 per cent, Goodricke is up 80 per cent, Jayshree Tea higher by 86 per cent, Dhunseri 50 per cent and Warren Tea 78 per cent.

 Tea prices have been moving up in auction centres across the world because of the terrible drought in Kenya. 

 Analysts believe that if the rains dont arrive in Kenya by the middle of March, the market will continue to be strong for some time. One indication that the market movement has a firm basis is seen from the fact that Tata Tea, which is a tea buyer, has seen its stock hardly move in the past month.

 The calculation is that Kenyas production might fall by 25 per cent or so, which is around 2.5 per cent of the global crop. But the shortfall will be in CTC teas, which is the reason why Indian tea prices are rising. 

 Sri Lanka produces mainly orthodox teas. Indian tea prices have also been helped by the fact that carry-forward stocks are low and the crop this year is unlikely to equal last years record levels. But the prices of tea companies have run up too far too fast.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 JP Morgan sets date for mutual fund offer

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Feb. 7: Following in the footsteps of foreign institutional investors, foreign asset management companies are now making a beeline for India. The latest to announce its foray into the domestic mutual fund market is JP Morgan. 

 The US-based asset management company with $900 billion worth of assets under management (AUM) today said it would start mutual fund business in the country by the second half of this year. The fund house has already appointed Vijayan Krishnamurthy, the former head of JM Financial Mutual Fund, to lead its India business. 

 The business will provide mutual funds to institutional and retail investors in India through third parties, including local banks and registered financial advisers, a company release said.

 Foreign fund houses have started to believe that there is a huge growth potential of retail participation in the stock market and that retail savings can be channelised to the equity market, said Dhirendra Kumar of Value Research.

 Two years ago HSBC and ABN AMRO started offering diversified equity products. Then came Fidelity, Standard Chartered. And now, JP Morgan, Kumar added. 

 Interestingly, some big names ? Temasek of Singapore, Aegon, Axa, and ING Investment arm, Optimix ? are still waiting in the sidelines. 

 Dundee close

 Sebi today cancelled the registration of Dundee Mutual Fund and withdrew its approval to Dundee Investment Management and Research to act as an AMC.

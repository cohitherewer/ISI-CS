The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Short-term strategy sheen on BK Birla outfits 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Birla: Holding on

 Calcutta, June 29: Basant Kumar Birla, chairman of the BK Birla empire, is drawing up short-term corporate strategy for all his group companies.

 Birla said he had asked the plans to be in place in two years. He was speaking at the annual general meeting of group flagship Kesoram Industries. Birla?s comments are significant as he had earlier expressed his desire to retire due to old age. Many believe he could step down in two years when he turns 87.

 Birla himself dismissed that possibility saying he would continue to run the show in all companies ? Kesoram, Century Textile, Century Enka and Jay Shree Tea ? as long as he could.

 However, he turned emotional while addressing Kesoram shareholders, dropping hints of his desire to step down. ?I joined the company at the age of 18 and became a director at 23. I am the chairman for many decades. I have attended 58 AGMs. But I do not know how long I will be able to continue,? Birla said.

 According to the succession plan officially known, Century Textile and Century Enka will go to BK?s grandson Kumar Mangalam Birla; Jay Shree Tea and Kesoram will be with his daughters Jayashree and Manjushree respectively.

 While Jayashree and Manjushree are on the boards of Jay Shree Tea and Kesoram, Kumar was inducted to Century Textile recently.

 Yesterday, Century Enka also created a provision to appoint an additional director paving the way for Kumar on its board.

 ?I want to retire. But nobody is letting me go. They say I should continue,? Birla told The Telegraph.

 Birla said the transition would be smooth when it happened since there were competent people on the boards and in the companies.

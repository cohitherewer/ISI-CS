 Problems for pipeline project

 - Pakistan, Iran put pressure on India to act fast

 S.P.S PANNU 

 Hosseinian amp; Srinivasan: Different strokes

 New Delhi, May 1: Iran appears to be building up pressure on India to push through the Iran-Pakistan-India pipeline project.

 Iranian deputy oil minister Hadi Nejad Hosseinian met petroleum secretary M.S. Srinivasan today after his visit to Islamabad. Iran and Pakistan may consider going it alone on the pipeline project if India does not come on board soon. 

 Interestingly, Iran?s stand until now has been that the pipeline is not viable unless India joins the project. Iran has huge quantities of gas. However, it has been isolated by the western countries and could have economic sanctions imposed against it.

 Energy-hungry India will provide a long-term market for the gas. However, India has to tread cautiously as the pipeline will pass through hostile Pakistani territory. 

 The Iranian minister discussed the gas pipeline and LNG issues with Srinivasan during a 90-minute meeting and is scheduled to meet petroleum minister Murli Deora tomorrow. 

 According to petroleum ministry sources, the discussions with the petroleum secretary were inconclusive and would be resumed tomorrow morning. 

 The roadmap for carrying out consultations and finalising the proposal has already been agreed upon in the earlier meetings among the three countries.

 However, Iran and Pakistan sprang a surprise today by stating that Pakistan would get a two-third share of the gas. 

 In the earlier meetings it was decided that India would get a two-third share, while Pakistan would be allocated a one-third share as its demand was less. In fact, Pakistan is self-sufficient in natural gas and it would require more gas only four to five years down the line. 

 According to agency reports, Pakistan has increased its proposed offtake of gas from the pipeline from 2.1 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) to 2.8 bcfd. This would make it difficult to accommodate India?s demand as the capacity of the proposed 2600-km-long pipeline is only 3.2 bcfd.

 Hosseinian and Pakistans petroleum secretary, Ahmad Waqar, said at a joint press conference in Islamabad that India could be accommodated through the second pipeline if it was interested in importing gas.

 The fact that the US is opposed to the proposed pipeline in any case puts a big question mark over the entire project. It is quite unlikely that Pakistan can push through the project without the US giving its consent. 

 The US has also floated a new proposal for building an intercountry power transmission line that will carry electricity generated in Kazakhstan and Turkmeinistan to energy-deficient Afghanistan, Pakistan and India. The power plants will be based on natural gas and some hydel power will also be fed through the grid, according to this proposal. 

 The US proposal clearly competes with the Iran-Pakistan-India pipeline project insofar as most of the gas that will be pumped through the proposed pipeline is envisaged to be used for power generation.

 State Bank gets China licence

 Beijing, Feb. 17 (PTI): The State Bank of India today became the first Indian bank in China to get approval to start normal banking operations there. 

 We have received the licence from the China Banking Regulatory Commission to start normal banking operations in foreign currency, said T.C.A. Ranganathan, CEO of SBI Shanghai branch.

 We are extremely happy with this development, Ranganathan, who was here to collect the licence from CBRC, said and added that normal banking operations would begin from the next fiscal.

 SBI, the largest commercial bank in India, has already taken adequate office space in Shanghai, he said.

 Welcoming SBIs upgradation as a full-fledged bank, Indian ambassador to China Nalin Surie said it bode well for further stepping up bilateral trade, which rose 37.64 per cent to hit a record $18.71 billion last year. He hoped that SBIs upgradation would encourage more Indian banks to venture into China.

 Sugar mills to end site tiff

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Nov. 26: The Centre has tightened the locational norms for sugar units to remove some of the ambiguities in existing rules that are the source of many disputes among companies over the site of their plants.

 While re-affirming the 15-km minimum distance between two sugar mills, the government has placed several riders to clarify the conditions for a licensee to stop a new mill from infringing on its turf.

 The order was passed more than a fortnight ago and will come into effect when notified in the official gazette.

 The ministry of consumer affairs, food and public distribution (department of food and public distribution), issued the order to amend the Sugarcane (Control) Order, 1966.

 Case in point

 This order may play a significant role in settling a dispute in the Supreme Court between Balrampur Chini Mills and Ojas Industries. 

 The two are sparring over Balrampur Chinis plans to set up more mills in Uttar Pradesh.

 The dispute is over the interpretation of the existing minimum 15-km distance norm under Press Note 12, issued by the ministry of industry in 1998. The note does not clarify whether the minimum distance is between an existing mill and a new one or also between two proposed mills that have filed industrial entrepreneur memorandum (IEM) .

 Balrampur Chini tried to set up mills at Nihalpur, Guleria and Kumbhi, all within 15 km of Ojass mills that are under construction. Ojas filed a writ petition before Allahabad High Court and Balrampur Chini Mills filed a transfer petition against this before the Supreme Court.

 When the matter was before the Supreme Court, additional solicitor-general B. Dutta, appearing for the government of India, had said a fresh look is being taken at the controversial issues and an effort is being made to iron out some of the difficulties highlighted by the parties in these cases.

 Industry circles say the latest government order is part of this process. Through the new order, the government had tried to remove some of the ambiguities in Press Note 12, sources added.

 Fresh norms

 The order has reiterated that no new factory will be set up within a radius of 15 km of any existing factory or another new factory in a state or two or more states.

 The order said an existing factory would mean a facility in operation as well as a unit which has taken all the effective steps for its establishment. This definition excludes a factory that has not carried out crushing operations for the last five sugar seasons.

 According to the order, a new factory would mean one, which is not an existing sugar factory, but has filed the IEM as prescribed by the department of industrial policy and promotion, ministry of commerce and industry.

 Firms also have to submit a performance guarantee of Rs 1 crore to the chief director (sugar), department of food and public distribution, ministry of consumer affairs, food and public distribution, for implementation of the IEM. 

 The government has also set several riders to avoid frivolous IEMs being filed. According to the order, companies have to take effective steps to implement the IEM.

 They have to purchase land in the name of the factory, place firm orders for plant and machinery and pay requisite advance or open a letter of credit with suppliers.

 Steps should also be taken to begin civil and construction work and get sanctions for term loans from banks or financial institutions.

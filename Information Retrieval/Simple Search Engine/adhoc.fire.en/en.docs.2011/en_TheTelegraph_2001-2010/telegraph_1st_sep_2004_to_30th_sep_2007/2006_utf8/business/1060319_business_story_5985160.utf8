 Fresh tender for sale of Orissa firm 

 SUBRAT DAS

 Bhubaneswar, March 18: The Orissa government today decided to invite fresh tender for the privatisation of state-owned Hirakud Industrial Works after a Calcutta-based firm backed out of the takeover deal.

 State industries minister Biswa Bhusan Harichandan said Varsha Fabrics was about to take over the sick Hirakud Industrial Works and was supposed to sign the share purchase agreement by first week of March. 

 However,the company did not turn up for signing the agreement. Hirakud Industrial Works, located 16 km away from the Sambalpur district headquarters, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the state-owned Industrial Development Corporation of Orissa Limited (IDCOL). 

 The unit manufactures machinery components and transmission line towers.

 Tata bid to thwart talent poachers

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Gopalakrishnan: Upbeat

 Mumbai, July 19: The Tatas have put in place an HR strategy to beat off the threat from rivals who have been trying to poach on its managerial talent.

 Four months ago, the group ? which has 93 firms spanning seven business sectors ? launched a human resource (HR) initiative to stem the attrition rate in its 215,000 manpower pool, which is the largest in the private sector.

 Attrition rates have been a big source of worry for software and BPO companies ? but traditional, smokestack industries are also beginning to feel the heat as rivals prepare to gouge talent.

 The gouging has got a lot easier because of two reasons: more and more managers are developing cross-functional expertise, and are keener to step on to accelerated career paths, crossing major milestones sooner than their predecessors did. To stop the raids on its resources, the Tatas have created an internal market for managers that helps talented individuals achieve career goals within the group rather than seek it somewhere else.

 Its early days yet, but R. Gopalakrishnan, director of Tata Sons, says the group has started by advertising 50 jobs that managers within the group can apply for.

 So, is this an admission that poaching is getting a wee bit uncomfortable for the group which has been known to nurture exceptional managerial talent? Gopalakrishnan prefers to side-step the question and chooses to focus instead on how the group has created an HR template that others in industry might be keen to learn from.

 We have seen three basic waves of change: the first phase began soon after liberalisation in the early 1990s when industry embarked on a course of modernisation by shaking up the management structures and slashing cost structures. The second wave started about five years ago with the modernisation of financial markets and balancesheets. We are now seeing the third wave where industries are being forced to modernise their human resources. Its going to be the most important phase in industry over the next 15 years, says Gopalakrishnan.

 Its interesting to see how the upscaling of people skills has changed the manpower pool within the Tatas, he says. Before the liberalisation phase began, the Tatas had 230,000 employees, of which only 40,000 to 50,000 were knowledge workers like engineers and software and IT professionals. The remaining 180,000 were workers. Now, the manpower pool is about the same but the knowledge worker pool has swelled to 110,000 to 120,000 with an equal number of workers, he adds.

 Satish Pradhan, executive vice-president for the groups HR, says the process of nurturing leadership within the group begins by giving Tata Administrative Service trainees exposure to at least one overseas posting in the first five years. The group also believes in creating a home-grown leadership by allowing mobility within the group.

 The group has gone in for major acquisitions over the past six years. Gopalakrishnan believes that the biggest challenge to the success of an acquisition is the ability to retain the talent pool, especially if it is an overseas buyout. We have succeeded very well because we have remained sensitive to the cultural differences, he says. Almost all the companies acquired by the Tatas continue to have the same management teams that existed before the buyout.

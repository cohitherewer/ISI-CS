 Calcutta, Aug. 18: Siemens Information Systems Ltd (SISL), a 100 per cent subsidiary of Siemens Ltd, will increase the headcount at its Calcutta centre from 173 to 750 by 2008 and 1,000 by 2010. 

 This was stated by SISL managing director Anil R. Laud today at the opening of the 40,000-sq ft Centre of Excellence (CoE) here for managed services to telecom companies and integrated service providers in the city. 

 SISLs city centre generated Rs 46.50 crore business last year. In India, SISL clocked a total business of Rs 643.1 crore in 2005-06, of which 85 per cent came from exports. 

 We are aiming at a 55 per cent compounded annual growth rate in top line, and from the Calcutta centre we are looking at a business turnover of Rs 110 crore by 2008, Laud said.

 SISL has six centres offering managed services end-to-end solutions for software application and operation management, performance management, remote network operations and maintenance for different industries including healthcare, telecom, media, manufacturing, financial services, utilities, airport and automotive.

 Calcutta, Sept. 22: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is concerned about a high money supply growth, coupled with a double-digit increase in industrial output, so far this fiscal. It is feared that the two factors together could foster a demand-pull inflation. This will add to the inflationary pressure, which has been a cause of concern for the apex bank for some time now.

 We will have to tread cautiously, RBI deputy governor Rakesh Mohan said on the sidelines of a seminar organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry here today.

 The increase in money supply in the system so far this fiscal was much more than what was projected. However, deposit growth during the period was higher than expected and a large part of net bank credit to the commercial sector was met from the increased deposits, Mohan said.

 Between April and August, money supply in the system increased by 19.9 per cent compared with 14.6 per cent during the same period last year, according to the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE). The RBI had projected a growth rate of 14.2 per cent for 2006-07.

 According to CMIE, among all components of money supply, demand deposits (read, current and savings deposits) with banks grew at a faster rate of 22.6 per cent than 19.8 per cent in fixed deposits and 18.2 per cent in currency with the public. Last fiscal, these three components recorded a growth of 18.8 per cent, 13.4 per cent and 14.1 per cent, respectively. 

 The major source of increase in money supply was net bank credit to the commercial sector, which was up by 28.2 per cent to Rs 17,67,815 crore.

 We should remember that our monetary policy has a lag effect (there is a time lag between measures announced by the RBI and the results materialised), Mohan said.

 Admitting that inflationary pressure is a concern for the apex bank, Mohan said there was, however, no change in RBIs monetary policy and projections. The RBI has pegged inflation for 2006-07 between 5 per cent and 5.5 per cent.

 He, however, allayed fears that India would be affected by the slowdown in US economy. India is muted against US economic slowdown as only a small part of our external trade is with that country, Mohan said.

 Mumbai, July 25: Tata Motors and the Fiat Group have set up a joint venture to make passenger vehicles, engines and transmissions for India and abroad. 

 According to the agreement, Fiat will introduce its premium cars for the B and C segments ? the Fiat Grande Punto and the new Fiat sedan ? and manufacture small diesel engines. 

 Fiat and Tata vehicles will be manufactured at the plant in Ranjangaon, Maharashtra, which has a capacity of one lakh cars and 2.5 lakh engines and transmissions. 

 ?This is the beginning of what promises to be a far-reaching, long-term relationship between Fiat and Tata Motors. Both companies have complementary strengths, convergent objectives and shared values,? Ratan Tata, chairman, Tata Motors, said here today. 

 ?Together, we can meaningfully address markets in India and other select geographies, combining technologies, products and human skills of both organisations,? Tata said. 

 The companies have also entered into a 60-day study to assess opportunities for collaboration in Latin America. 

 The study will focus on the sales potential of utility vehicles and pickups and the extent to which Fiat?s production facilities in Cordoba, Argentina, can fulfil the needs of the joint venture. 

 Vehicles from the Argentina plant will be sold in Latin America and elsewhere under both the Fiat and Tata brands. 

 ?As we said at the time we signed the distribution agreement in India, this is a strategic partnership which is evolving by leveraging on the respective strengths and continuously identifying new opportunities to be jointly exploited not only in India but also on a global scale,? Sergio Marchionne, chief executive officer of the Fiat Group, said.

 Q amp;A

 Rent rules

 I have recently purchased a flat in joint name with my daughter, who is 20 years old. I am a central PSU employee and a regular taxpayer. Can my daughter issue house rent receipt to me so that I can claim the same according to tax rules, while my daughter will submit income tax returns as income from house property. She does not have any other source of income.

 N. K. De, by e-mail

 ce you are the joint owner of the house, it is not possible to have rent receipts issued in your name.

 Stolen melodies

 The stereo system of my car has been stolen. How would the insurance company settle the claim filed for the theft? 

 Pritam Singh, Calcutta

 ce stereo or any other electrical or electronic gadget fitted on the vehicle is a separately identifiable item it also has its separate value for which it is insured. The theft claim is settled on the total loss basis of the article, which means the market value or the sum insured, whichever is less.

 MIS foreclosure

 I have a post office MIS account, which would mature in September 2006. Can I foreclose the account?

 R. K. Mishra, Ranchi

 You may close the MIS account only after one year from the date of opening. However, there is a penalty of 5 per cent on the deposited amount if it is withdrawn before three years. Premature withdrawal after three years will not attract any penalty. But, the 10 per cent bonus will be scrapped.

 Motor insurance

 I wish to change the insurer for my motor insurance policy. Is it possible to do so? 

 Mithu Sanyal, by e-mail

 Yes, you can change the insurance company at the time of renewal of insurance policy. However, while changing the insurance company, it is advisable to obtain the no claim discount certificate from the existing insurance company. Preferably, there should not be any break in the insurance.

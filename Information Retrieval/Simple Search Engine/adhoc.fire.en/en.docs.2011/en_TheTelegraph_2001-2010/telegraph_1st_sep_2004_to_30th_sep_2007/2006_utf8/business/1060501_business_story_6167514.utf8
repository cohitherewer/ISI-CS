 Tatas to invest more in Bangla

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, April 30: The Tata Group has scaled up its investment plan for Bangladesh to $3 billion for establishing greenfield operations in steel, fertiliser, power and coal mining.

 The Tatas have submitted a revised proposal to Bangladesh?s Board of Investment (BoI). The earlier investment plan envisaged investments of $2 billion. 

 ?Bangladesh continues to be a focus market for Tata Group?s international expansion plans,? said Alan Rosling, executive director of Tata Sons. ?We are hopeful that our revised proposal meets the concerns raised by the Bangladesh negotiation team.?

 The negotiations of the key terms of these projects commenced last year and have now entered the final stages with the submission of the comprehensive package which addresses issues of gas prices, fiscal incentives and coal mining. 

 ?The Tatas? negotiating team has given a well thought out proposal and has shown that they are committed to the project. We hope to give our reply soon,? said Mahmudur Rahman, chairman of BoI. 

 In this submission, the Tata Group has proposed a product-linked gas pricing formula, which at today?s commodity prices offers Bangladesh an attractive price for its natural gas. 

 The Bangladesh government has been offered an equity participation option of 10 per cent in all projects. 

 The Tatas have also indicated their intention to list the projects in the local capital markets at an appropriate time. The proposal also gives details on how the Tata Group would implement its commitment to corporate social responsibility (CSR) in these projects. It plans to set up two hospitals and three technical training institutes near the plant sites. 

 Rosling added, ?We strongly believe that these projects are good for Bangladesh and good for the Tata Group. They would have positive economic impact on Bangladesh. We look forward to an early positive response from the Bangladesh government.?

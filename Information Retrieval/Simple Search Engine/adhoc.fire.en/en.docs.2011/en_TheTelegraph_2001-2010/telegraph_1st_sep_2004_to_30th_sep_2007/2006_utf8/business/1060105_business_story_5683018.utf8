 Ficci for PSU stake sale in small lots

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 4: The Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci) today urged the government to privatise all non-strategic public sector undertakings in a phased manner. Saroj Poddar, Ficcis newly-elected president, said the Left parties should rethink its stand on the issue.

 It certainly does not appear to be a principled stand. We ask them (the Left) to reconsider the decision, said Poddar. The Left parties have been opposing even small stake sales in navratna companies. 

 The chamber feels the government could begin with a 49 per cent sale and go up to 74 per cent in the second phase of stake sale in non-strategic companies. The chamber, however, feels navratnas should be considered strategic companies and the government should hold 51 per cent in them. 

 The Left is, however, against any move to bring down government equity in navratnas to 51 per cent as it feels this could be a prelude to eventual divestment through a public offering. 

 It is important for the government to continue its dialogue with the Left parties, Poddar said. We are confident that eventually they will see the rational of economic decisions and support the government, he added.

 In an effort to smoothen this transition, the chamber will plan a series of interactions with the Left this year. 

 Poddar added that the government should be considered a shareholder in these companies, which should be run professionally. 

 On privatisation of loss-making PSUs, Poddar said the government could unlock the assets, particularly real estate, in units which were beyond redemption.

 If the government is unable to privatise the sick units, it should monetise the assets, he said. Why should the government keep pumping in money? he quipped.

 On the implementation of the proposed 0.25 per cent stamp duty on loan agreements by the Maharashtra government, Poddar said, We will take up the matter with the state very soon. It will be a big burden, especially on industry. It will increase our cost of business, he said.

 If this happens, soon other state governments will also adopt this policy. The government must find other ways to raise revenues and not hurt industrys competitiveness, he added. The Maharashtra government has now amended the Bombay Stamp Act to levy stamp duty on all loans, including those taken by individuals. So home loans, personal loans, consumer durable loans and all other retail loans now attract stamp duty.

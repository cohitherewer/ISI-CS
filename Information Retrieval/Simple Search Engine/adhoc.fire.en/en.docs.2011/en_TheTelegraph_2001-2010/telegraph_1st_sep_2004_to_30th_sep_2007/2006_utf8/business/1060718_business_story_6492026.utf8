The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Discount brokerage just a month away

 CHANDRALEKHA TULAL

 Mumbai, July 17: Stockbrokers are running scared as Anil Ambanis new broking outfit ? R-Trade ? plans to kick start a discount brokerage model in India. R-Trade is expected to open its doors for business within a month. 

 The Charles Schwab group launched the discount brokerage model in the US on May 1, 1975, which precipitated a shakeout among brokerages on Wall Street. The group notched up a revenue of $4464 million in 2005.

 Breaking a trend of more than 180 years, the US brokerage industry acted on a Securities and Exchange Commission mandate on the day and deregulated commissions, which meant trading fees were to be set by market competition. Deregulation paved the way for an entire new industry ? discount brokerage ? in which ordinary investors bought and sold securities without a stockbroker, making their decisions themselves.

 Stockbrokers in India ? who have survived on wilting commissions ? are spooked by the thought that a discount brokerage model could throw them out of business.

 In laymans term, a discount broker typically takes orders from his clients and follows them accordingly. In other words, you tell them to buy or sell, and they do exactly what you requested, and nothing more. Their service is a way to save money for people who are looking out for themselves and who do not require or desire any advice or hand holding during their forays into the markets.

 However, R-Trade might go beyond the original definition of discount broking and provide all the services of a full-service broker. 

 Stockbrokers say the broking scene is already quite competitive in the country. Even though the commission structure in India is capped at 1.5 per cent, the average fees charged by brokers for a retail investor varies between 0.5 and 1 per cent. For institutional investors, it goes down to as low as 0.15 per cent.

 R-Trade is expected to change all that. 

 There are serious apprehensions in the market over their pricing strategies; with their scale of operations and deep pockets, they may slash the fees indiscriminately, said a leading broker. 

 When contacted, Reliance officials refused to comment. The Reliance hangover could also spill over into the mutual fund distribution industry if they decide to follow the Charles Schwab model in this sector too.

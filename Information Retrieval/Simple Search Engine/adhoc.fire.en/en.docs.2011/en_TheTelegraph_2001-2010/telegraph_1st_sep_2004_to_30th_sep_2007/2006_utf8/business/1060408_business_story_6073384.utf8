 Power struggle for Suri

 Calcutta, April 7: When Lalit Suri took over Great Eastern Hotel in November last year, he knew the heritage property came with a baggage. However, he could not have anticipated that an electric transformer could come in the way of restoring the oldest hotel in the country.

 The transformer supplies power to Raj Bhavan, barely 100 metres away from the hotel, and moving it would mean disruption of power supply to none other than the governor of the state.

 ?Now it?s a problem. The transformer cannot stay on the premises. At the same time, the power supply has to be maintained to the governor?s house,? Suri said.

 One has to wait for an opportune time when the governor would not be here, he added.

 However, it might be far from easy. CESC, entrusted with the job of supplying power and maintaining the transformer, has to agree. Who, after all, says that a transformer cannot be within a hotel?

 ?We are not in a position to comment unless we know the details,? CESC officials said. 

 For Suri, the transformer is just one of the many hair-raising problems he?s facing in his quest to revive the heritage hotel.

 For instance, there are about 31 tenants on the property, including many shops in the arcade. Not only are the shops unbecoming, being on a five-star property, they are also a stumbling block on the way of restoring the hotel. Being a heritage property, the building can only be strengthened and not demolished.

 The columns have to be fortified but they run through the shops. Suri said many of the tenants had not been paying rents for decades and some have no legal locus standi to be on the premises.

 The new owner plans to submit the master plan to restore the property within six weeks to Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC).

 It is hoping that CMC would declare the property unsafe for habitation, making the job of removing the tenants easy. The new-look hotel, catering mainly to business travellers, is expected to open in mid-2007 if everything goes as planned.

 The property is being modelled on the famous Raffles Hotel of Singapore, which, Suri claimed, has a striking similarity with Great Eastern. 

 Singapore-based company Architect 61 has been entrusted with the job of designing the hotel, as it has done for Raffles. 

 Suri has lined up an investment of Rs 120 crore for the work that would provide modern facilities in a Raj ambience.

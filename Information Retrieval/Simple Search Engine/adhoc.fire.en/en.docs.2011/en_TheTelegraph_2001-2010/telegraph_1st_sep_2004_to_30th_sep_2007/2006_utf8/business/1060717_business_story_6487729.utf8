 Bank on the best

 Fixed deposits emerge as a clear winner, says Srikumar Bondyopadhyay

 At a time when the stocks markets have turned choppy, investors are scouting for avenues that will give them an assured rate of return and still be tax efficient.

 Unfortunately, there aren?t many options. 

 National Savings Certificates (VIII series) of post offices and public provident funds have traditionally been the most popular avenues for parking investible surpluses to save tax as well as earn a high assured return on investment. 

 Now that investment up to Rs 1 lakh in bank fixed deposits for five years or more has been made eligible for tax deduction under section 80C of the income tax act, these have become lucrative investment options. 

 At a glance, both PPF and NSC, which offer an 8 per cent interest rate per annum (which is linked to the government-administered rate of interest on small savings), appear to be paying more than bank deposits (at 7-7.5 per cent). But the average return even between the two favoured investment options varies. This is because the mode of interest compounding varies between the two. While the interest is compounded annually in public provident fund, it is compounded half-yearly in case of national savings certificates. In figures, if Rs 1,000 is invested today in a PPF account, it will grow to Rs 1,586.90 after six years. If you have instead bought NSC with the money, you would have got Rs 1,601 after six years.

 Thus, NSC proves a better investment option than PPF over a given tenure in terms of returns. A longer lock-in period of 15 years also works as a disadvantage of PPF investment. Then, there is a maximum investment cap of Rs 70,000 in PPF, which is the greatest drawback of public provident fund.

 Though there is no upper limit for investment in NSC and these certificates can be bought in denominations as low as Rs 100 or Rs 500, the greatest demerit of national savings certificates is that one cannot withdraw one?s investment from it before maturity unless some eventualities such as the death of the account holder. Otherwise, the NSC investment can be prematurely withdrawn with a high court direction. However, an NSC account can be transferred from one post office to another, but those who have done it know how difficult it is. 

 In comparison, bank fixed deposits are more convenient. While most of the banks are offering an interest rate between 7.5 and 7.75 per cent, a couple of banks such as Centurion Bank of Punjab and Yes Bank are also giving an 8 per cent interest on fixed deposits for more than five years. Senior citizens get a 0.5 percentage point more in bank fixed deposits ? this provision is not there in NSC. 

 Besides, interest in bank fixed deposits are compounded quarterly. This means Rs 1,000 invested in a six-year bank fixed deposit will amount to Rs 1,562 at an annual interest rate of 7.5 per cent and Rs 1,585 at an interest rate of 7.75 per cent. At 8 per cent interest rate, it amounts to Rs 1,608.40.

 Even if we consider a 7.5 per cent rate of interest in bank fixed deposits, the difference in returns between NSC and a bank fixed deposit is only Rs 6.50 per Rs 1,000 a year. 

 However, one can give a mandate to the bank to transfer the accrued interest on a monthly basis to a savings account. This facility is absent in case of NSC. 

 A remunerative strategy would be to invest the monthly interest in a recurring deposit account with the same bank and earn an additional income thereon. The total interest income from your investment in a bank fixed deposit will thus be greater than that on NSC.

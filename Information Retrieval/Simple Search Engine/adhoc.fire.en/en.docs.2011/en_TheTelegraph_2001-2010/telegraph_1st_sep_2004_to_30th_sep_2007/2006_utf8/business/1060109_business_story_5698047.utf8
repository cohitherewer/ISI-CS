 Anchor for new Bengal port 

 S.P.S. PANNU 

 New Delhi, Jan. 8: The shipping ministry has cleared a proposal for a feasibility study to set up a deep-water port at a suitable site on the Bengal coast. A senior ministry official said a global tender would be floated soon to appoint consultants for the job. 

 The study will find out a site with a deeper draft than Sagar on the coast of Bengal where a modern port can be set up. Since the draft at Sagar is not considered deep enough, given the gigantic size of modern ships, it is increasingly being felt that an alternative site should also be explored.

 The official also said Rs 10 crore would be allocated in the forthcoming budget for carrying out the study. However, the process to shortlist the consultants is likely to start this fiscal as not much money is required at this stage. 

 Sources said the proposal was cleared by the shipping ministry after the Bengal leadership had discussed the issue with the Prime Ministers Office. 

 The state-of-the-art Ningbo port near Shanghai is being considered as a model for developing the new deep-water port. Closer home, the Ennore port in Chennai, which has been developed with breakwaters by foreign experts, provides another example that can be emulated. 

 A port at Sagar on the mouth of the river Hooghly is under consideration. It will enable the Calcutta port system to take in bigger ships since the draft at the port would be 12 metres. Ships with a 10.5-metre draft could then dock at the port as the mandatory under keel clearance of 1.5 metres for vessels could be maintained. 

 While this draft will allow ships bigger than those currently sailing up the Hooghly, it falls far short of what is required for mother vessels that are increasingly being introduced to avail of the economies of scale in the shipping industry.

 Although a port in the sea at Sandheads could provide a 50-metre draft, the prohibitive cost involved in setting it up had made the decision swing in favour of Sagar as the next location to expand the Calcutta port system.

 The shipping ministry was also of the view that a port at Sandheads would be of no use during the monsoon as ships would not be able to anchor in the turbulent weather out at sea. It now remains to be seen whether the new deep-water port being mooted at some site on the Bengal coast proves to be a better alternative.

 The shipping ministry has also drawn up a proposal for setting up a world-class shipyard on the east coast, possibly at Paradip. 

 However, going by shipping minister, T.R. Baalus stand on the issue, political factors are likely to eventually come into play in determining the selection of the site.

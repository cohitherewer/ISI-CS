 Bengal picky about SEZs

 Calcutta, Aug. 30: The Bengal government is not going to give blanket approvals to the SEZ proposals it has received. Rather, it will be selective in giving its go-ahead.

 We have received many such proposals, but we are not going to approve all of them. Only those projects that comply with the state governments priority in terms of location or product will see the light of the day, Bengal industry minister Nirupam Sen said at an interactive session organised by the Merchants Chamber of Commerce here today.

 The government will, however, encourage setting up special economic zones in the backward areas, Sen said.

 But he did not disclose the number of proposals the government has received so far.

 A project that qualifies under the special economic zone scheme of the Centre, also needs to obtain the local governments clearances and requires to abide by the local rules relating to land acquisition, labour laws, and area planning.

 Sen also denounced the provision under the Centres scheme that at least 25 per cent of the land area of an SEZ must be developed for manufacturing and processing. If only 25 per cent of the total land area of an SEZ project is developed for processing use, what will be developed in the remaining 75 per cent area? Sen asked. In Bengal, we have maintained the area planning clause (for an SEZ project) that at least 50 per cent of the land must be developed for a manufacturing or processing unit, he added.

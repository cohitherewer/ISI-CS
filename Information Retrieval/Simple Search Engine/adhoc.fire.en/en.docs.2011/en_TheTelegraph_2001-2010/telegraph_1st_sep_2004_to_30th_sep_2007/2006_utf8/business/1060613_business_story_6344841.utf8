 We aim to achieve a turnover of Rs 5,000 crore by 2011 and are constantly capitalising on untapped areas and opportunities in both organic and inorganic way to drive growth. Simplex is also eyeing the real estate sector since strong infrastructure opportunities are emerging in this space, said B.D. Mundhra, chairman and managing director of the company.

 The company has declared a 50 per cent dividend. It would also split the stock in the ratio of 1:5.

 To reduce regional dependency and increase margins, Simplex will foray into new overseas markets. 

 We have projects in Qatar, Dubai, West Indies and also see opportunities in North Africa and central Asia, said director Amitabh Mundhra.

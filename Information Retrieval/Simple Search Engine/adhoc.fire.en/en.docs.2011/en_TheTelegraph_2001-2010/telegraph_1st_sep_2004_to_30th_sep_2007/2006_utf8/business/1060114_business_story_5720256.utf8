 New Delhi, Jan. 13: Tata Motors today launched a refigured version of the Indica ? its entry-level vehicle that debuted in 1998. 

 The Xeta is powered by a 1.4-litre petrol engine that gives a fuel efficiency of 14 km per litre. The car is priced at Rs 2.69-3.65 lakh (ex-showroom, Delhi).

 This will be the second makeover for the Indica ? the first was in January 2001 when the Indica V2 diesel was launched.

 The Xeta is an acronym for extra fuel efficiency, torque advantage engine. It will be available in five colours, including three exclusive colours

 The Tatas also unveiled Fiat?s Grand Punto. The car is being launched under an exclusive global agreement that the two companies signed last September.

 This is the first time that Fiat cars are being showcased along with Tata cars at the Auto Expo. Under the ?no holds barred? agreement signed by the two carmakers, Fiat will sell its cars through Tata?s select dealer network in the country. In return, Fiat will give the Indian auto giant access to its technology and marketing support abroad.

 ?Two big companies have come together to look at opportunities not confined to India but reaching out to other places of the world,? said Ratan Tata, Tata group chairman, after signing the deal with Sergio Marchionne, CEO of Fiat Spa. It could see the Fiat ? which was facing tough times in India ? leverage the Tata marketing muscle to push their products.

 ?The agreement is a recognition of the fact that we do need to do work in this market,? Marchionne said.

 Asked whether Fiat would outsource its excess production capacity in India to Tata Motors, he said, ?There are no immediate plans yet.?

 Marchionne said the company wants to expand its portfolio in the Indian market, but there was no proposal to launch any model this year. ?It will happen at an appropriate time?.

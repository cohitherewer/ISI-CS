 Quick end to disputes seen

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, March 6: Anil Ambani is hoping that all the prickly issues in the contentious non-compete and the trademarks agreements with Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) will be resolved by March 31 when the fiscal year runs out.

 We have informed Reliance Industries about all the deviations in the agreements from earlier agreed positions. We are well on our way to resolving all issues on a bilateral basis, Ambani told reporters here today.

 He said after March 31 there would be no payables or receivables between the two independent groups that have been carved out of the Rs 100,000-crore empire that patriarch Dhirubhai Ambani had built.

 Discussions were also progressing to resolve the differences between the two groups over the gas supply agreement that Reliance Industries had signed with Reliance Natural Resources Ltd (RNRL).

 All the agreements were signed in mid-January when the four demerged companies were still under the control of Reliance Industries.

 The Reliance-Anil Dhirubhai Ambani group (ADAG) had pointed out that according to the overall settlement, ADAG will have the first option to get 40 per cent of gas from the entire future reserves of RIL, including new discoveries.

 However, in the gas supply agreement entered when RNRL was under RILs control, this option has been unilaterally restricted to RILs blocks acquired only up to June 18, 2005 and it excluded all future acquisitions of blocks by RIL.

 Today, Anil Ambani again staked claim for 40 per cent of RILs gas future discoveries from new blocks. This gas, he said, should go to RNRL. 

 Ambani said RNRL was exploring the option of entering other business that includes gas distribution in Delhi and Mumbai. This apart, the company would also look into coal mining as soon as the sector is opened for private players.

 He said the Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group (ADAG) was interested in setting up nuclear power plants but would have to wait till appropriate legislation was passed allowing complete private participation in the sector. quot;We have already held some discussions with the Nuclear Power Corporation in this regard, quot; he added.

 Ambani said ADAG intended to invest Rs 1000 crore over the next two years in Reliance Life Insurance, the renamed AMP Sanmar that it acquired last year.

 Reliance Communications Ventures Ltd (RCoVL) could end up joining hands with Microsoft Corporation in Internet Protocol TV (IP TV) that enables communication service providers to deliver next generation television services.

 Steve Ballmer, CEO of Microsoft Corporation, spoke about the possible alliance in a message ahead of RCoVLs listing. Later, Ambani revealed that IP TV would be rolled out by the end of this year.

 New Delhi, Feb. 6: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today tried to hardsell the investment opportunities in India to Japanese investors. 

 He invited Japan to invest in infrastructure and industrial sectors.

 Singh met a 73-member delegation led by Osamu Watanabe, CEO and chairman of Japan External Trade Organisation (Jetro), and asked them to consider the huge foreign investment opportunities.

 Senior officials from the Prime Ministers office and the ministry of industrial policy and promotion were also present during the meeting.

 Japan has financed the first phase of Delhis metro railway project and it will fund the second phase as well. It has also agreed to conduct a feasibility study of the Rs 22,000-crore rail freight corridor connecting Mumbai, Delhi and Calcutta.

 While the poor infrastructure in the country is viewed as a bottleneck for industrial development, the flip side is that it offers a huge business opportunity, as there is a scope for investing $150 billion over the next five years.

 Private investments have already started flowing into the countrys ports and highways, but it is only a fraction of what China is attracting. The government, therefore, is keen to exploit this avenue to boost the countrys economic growth rate. 

 Commerce and industry minister Kamal Nath also addressed the delegation and said a new area for collaboration between small and medium enterprises of India and Japan could open up.

 Nath said a Japan cell had been set up in his ministry to assist Japanese investors. 

 The minister said while globally Japan is investing $35-40 billion per year, India is getting a meagre $200-300 million.

 Even if reinvested earnings are included, the investments are not very significant and have not showed an increasing trend, he said.

 The state governments of Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Rajasthan made presentations about the investment opportunities in the respective states.

 Besides, there were sectoral presentations on automobiles and auto components by the Auto Components Manufacturers Association and on electronic components.

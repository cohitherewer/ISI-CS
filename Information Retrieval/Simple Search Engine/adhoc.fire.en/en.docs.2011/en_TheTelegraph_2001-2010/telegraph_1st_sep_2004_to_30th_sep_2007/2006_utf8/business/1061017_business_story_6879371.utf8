 Toray water purifiers come to India

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Oct. 16: The $12.4-billion Toray group of Japan has entered India by launching three models of water purifier Torayvino in Calcutta.

 These would be distributed through the firms Indian partners AK Exports and Imports. The models would be imported as these specialised hollow fibre membrane water purifiers are manufactured only in two of Torays plants in Japan.

 After studying the market, we have brought our water purifier range to India through our partners, AK Exports and Imports, with whom we share a business relationship for the past six years through textiles. We plan to sell 2 lakh systems and 4.5 lakh pieces of replacement cartridges by 2010, said Yoshhiaki Karatsu, manager, Torayvino sales, Toray Group.

 The launch in Calcutta would be followed by introduction in Bangalore, New Delhi, Mumbai and Hyderabad.

 It took a lot of time for the Toray group to come to India. But, hopefully through Torayvino, the foray would prove to be the foundation for the companys subsequent plans for the country, said Kazunari Takeda, general manager, amenity division, Toray Group. The domestic water purifier market is estimated to be worth $250 million with a CAGR of 18 to 20 per cent.

 This purifier technology does not involve water storage, which is conducive to breeding of germs. Certain models also work effectively without electricity and are available in faucet-mount and counter-top types. We decided to launch it in Calcutta after an in-house study on the water contamination level showed that the level in the city is one of the highest in the country among the metros, said Ashish Tibrawalla, chief executive officer of AK Exports and Imports.

 The prices of the filters are Rs 3,530 and Rs 5,050 for the MK models while the counter-top ones cost Rs 10,710, inclusive of taxes, with one variety of cartridge at Rs 950 and the other at Rs 2,850, the latter has to be replaced around once a year.

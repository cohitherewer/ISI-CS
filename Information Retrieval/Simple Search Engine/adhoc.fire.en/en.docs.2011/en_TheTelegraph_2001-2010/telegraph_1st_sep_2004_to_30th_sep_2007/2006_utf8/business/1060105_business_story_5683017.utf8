 Mumbai, Jan. 4: The rupee today roared to a three-month high, closing at 44.79 against a dollar that has been twitching in sync with US interest rates.

 The rupees runaway rise has also been underpinned by the burst of capital that has flowed in from foreign institutional investors into equity. They were believed to have injected $10.5 billion last year.

 In turbulent trading at the inter-bank foreign exchange (forex) market, the rupee opened at 44.78 and plumbed a low of 44.88 on dollar purchases by state-run banks, possibly on behalf of the RBI to stem gains. 

 Later, however, dollar supplies came in thick, propelling the local currency to 44.79, a whopping increase of 26 paise over its last finish, inter-bank dealers said.

 Public sector banks buy and sell dollars at Reserve Banks bidding to suck out excess volatility in the currency markets and to prevent sharp swings either way.

 In overseas markets, the dollar quivered moments after a meeting of the Federal Reserves rate-setting panel indicated that the cost of money would not rise further.

 Even the rising crude oil prices have failed to rein in a resurgent rupee, whose fortunes have been intertwined with the portfolio investment flows into booming exchanges than with any other factors, a dealer said.

 The closest the local currency came to todays finishing line was on October 10, when it had settled at 44.76. Traders expect it to consolidate now, though there are fears the march could be halted if the RBI steps in.

 Oil was quoted at $63.05 a barrel before settling at $62.69 in Asian trade today due to lingering supply concerns.

 Pre-emptive step: FM

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Jan. 24: Finance minister P. Chidambaram today said the RBIs move to hike repo rates was a pre-emptive action to keep inflation in check and could be reversed once the external situation improved. 

 The government and RBI are keen to keep inflation below 5 per cent and given the strong credit and consumer demand, we do not want to stoke inflationary expectations, he said. 

 The hike in repo rates is a pre-emptive action by the RBI, which wants to stay ahead of the inflation curve. It could be reversed once the situation clears, he said.

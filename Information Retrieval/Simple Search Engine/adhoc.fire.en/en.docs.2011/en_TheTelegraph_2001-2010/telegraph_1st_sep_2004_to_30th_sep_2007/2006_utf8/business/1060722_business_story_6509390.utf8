 Calcutta, July 21: Eveready Industries India Ltd is planning to unlock the real estate potential to the tune of 39 acres at its facilities in Chennai, Hyderabad and Noida.

 The company has existing manufacturing facilities at two of these locations in Chennai and Hyderabad.

 The Chennai facility is spread over 7 acres, Hyderabad 25 acres and Noida 7 acres.

 Our first consideration is our people and the existing operations as well as to minimise loss of production through relocation. We have to ensure that by unlocking the real estate potential, the existing capacity should not be affected. Our capacity will go up to 2 billion batteries per annum with the start of the Rs 70-crore Uttaranchal operations. Currently, the company is selling 1.5-1.6 billion pieces, said Suvamoy Saha, chief financial officer, director, EIIL.

 The Uttaranchal plant should be operational by April 2007.

 For the quarter ended June 30, 2006, the company got Rs 35.87 lakh from the sale of real estate and for the last fiscal, the total income from the sale of real estate was Rs 76.62 crore.

 The company had earlier sold eight acres in Guindy, near Chennai for Rs 100 crore. This deal will be the benchmark of returns for Eveready from real estate, Saha said.

 For the quarter ended June 30, 2006, EIIL clocked a net profit of Rs 12.18 crore on a gross sales of Rs 256.02 crore. In the same period last year, the companys earnings stood at Rs 6.29 crore and sales at Rs 213.15 crore.

 Benchmark set for PSU turnaround

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 New Delhi, Feb. 9: The Congress-led government has set a benchmark to turn around state-run firms. According to North Block officials, only those PSUs will be considered for turnaround whose revival packages meet the standards set by banks for normal business loans.

 The money for the revival package, which will be mix of equity infusion and loans, will partly come from the Investment Fund. Divestment proceeds are being ploughed into this fund. So far, revival packages of PSUs were sponsored by budgetary funds. Although the Investment Fund will be outside the budget, revival packages will continue to be cleared by the cabinet. Sources said some of the funds for revival will also come by way of debt from banks and financial institutions as well as from sale of assets. 

 However, the budget for 2006-07 will still have provisions for recapitalisation of sick PSUs by way of waiver of past government loans and taxes.

 Andrew Yule, Burn Standard, Hindustan Cables and Tyre Corporation of India are among the state-run companies likely to benefit from the new scheme. Others in the queue are FACT and HOCL. 

 State-run companies whose revival packages are not considered viable will face either the auctioneers hammer or a shutdown.

 If the government ropes in a private partner, it would have two options. It could induct a minority partner, which would bring in technical or financial expertise but would not get management control. Alternatively, if the firms revival is found to be risky, there could be a majority partner with management control. 

 The decision to induct a private partner would depend solely on the need to gain technical, managerial and commercial expertise. 

 The cases for revival which will be taken up under this policy will be finalised on the basis of recommendations received by the government from the Board for Reconstruction of Public Enterprises (BRPSE) headed by Prahlad Kumar Basu. 

 Senior officials expect the Left to push for revival of every sick central PSU in Bengal and Kerala. 

 The government and the BRPSE will decide on reviving sick PSUs after considering factors such as cash flow, profitability, growth rate and earning power as well as their ability to implement the turnaround strategy. This policy decision has been taken as the government will no longer extend any sovereign guarantees to these PSUs for loans taken as part of the revival package.

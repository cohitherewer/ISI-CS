 Fed set to hold rates steady

 Bernanke: Close vigil

 Washington, Dec. 12 (Reuters): US Federal Reserve officials are expected to hold interest rates steady on Tuesday and retain a cautionary warning about inflation risks, while taking stock of cooler economic growth. 

 A decision by the Fed to keep benchmark borrowing costs at 5.25 per cent would extend an interest-rate pause policymakers initiated when they stepped to the sidelines on August 8 after a two-year string of 17 consecutive rate increases. 

 Holding steady would be in keeping with the view, expressed by Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke and colleagues, that higher-than-desired core inflation is a worry, but price pressures should ease as slower growth pushes up unemployment. 

 We do not expect the FOMC at Tuesdays meeting to depart from chairman Bernankes recent message that spillovers from the housing downturn will stay limited and inflation risks still predominate, Goldman Sachs chief US economist Jan Hatzius said in a note to clients. 

 Bernanke called core inflation uncomfortably high in a speech on November 28, adding there were risks prices would not recede in spite of the drags on growth from slowing housing markets and weakness at auto plants and other factories. 

 Fed vice-chairman Donald Kohn renewed the warning on inflation early this month, saying that while policy-makers expect inflation to ease, the risks around that expectation are tilted to the upside, suggesting the US central bank sees a greater chance of rates rising than falling. 

 Kohn pointed to tight labour markets and an economy that, while growing more slowly than at the beginning of the year, is expanding at a pace not that far below the speed limit for keeping inflation under control. 

 US output grew at a 2.2 per cent annual rate in the third quarter, slowing from 2.6 per cent in the second quarter and 5.6 per cent in the first three months of the year. Many economists think the long-term trend growth rate is around 3 per cent.

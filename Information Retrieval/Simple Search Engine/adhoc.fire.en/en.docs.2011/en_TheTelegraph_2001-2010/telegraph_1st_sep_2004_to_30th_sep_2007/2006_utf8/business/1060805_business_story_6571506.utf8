 Beeline for BSE pie

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Aug. 4: The Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) is in talks with several overseas bourses for the strategic sale of a 26 per cent stake as part of its demutualisation and corporatisation process. 

 We have received expressions of interest from various stock exchanges, including leading Asian and global ones. However, we are still awaiting Sebi guidelines on the matter, said Rajnikant Patel, chief executive officer and managing director of BSE.

 Although the BSE chief refused to name any entities, market speculation is that Nasdaq is in the reckoning for picking up a stake. 

 Earlier this week, top Nasdaq officials, including president and chief executive officer Bob Greifeld and Charlotte Crosswell, head of Nasdaq International, met BSE officials. 

 Other bourses interested in picking up the stake are Singapore Stock Exchange and London Stock Exchange, market sources said. 

 Globally, bourses are looking at mergers and acquisitions and the exchanges are bound to look at the vibrant Indian stock exchanges. 

 While we are in discussions with other bourses, we might also look at other investors, including financial institutions, both domestic and foreign. However, all decisions will be based on the final guidelines, said Patel. 

 The market regulator had formed a committee to examine the issues involved in the divestment of shareholding on the exchanges and had sought public comments on the report submitted by the committee in early May. The stock exchange has appointed Kotak Mahindra Capital Company as its financial adviser. 

 We have to complete the corporatisation process by May 2007 and expect to make the strategic sale by December this year, said Patel. The exchange will offload the remaining 25 per cent through an IPO or an offer for sale. 

 The Sebi report recognises that some bourses might not wish to take the IPO route and they should be allowed to induct strategic partners, though subject to certain restrictions. 

 In case a partner is an exchange, multilateral agency, insurance company, bank, depository or clearing corporation, it will be allowed to hold up to a maximum of 26 per cent of the share capital and voting rights of the stock exchange either singly or collectively along with persons acting in concert. Any other entity, including foreign investors, can be allowed to hold less than 15 per cent.

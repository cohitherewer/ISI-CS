 Sales dip forces RIL fuel retailing review

 Drop by drop

 Mumbai, Sept. 13 (Reuters): Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) is rethinking its fuel retail plans due to shrinking sales, a senior company official said on Wednesday, as he urged a level playing field for all oil firms.

 RIL has seen its market share fall to 2 per cent from 16 per cent at the beginning of the year after it raised petrol and diesel prices in the past quarter, vice-president Ashok Dhar said.

 State-run refiners, which dominate the market, sell fuel at government-controlled prices and are compensated for losses.

 But private retailers receive no such subsidies and RIL was forced to raise its prices as global crude rates surged.

 We are rethinking our strategy as our volumes have come down because of price increase, Dhar said.

 We are trying to see how exactly we can come out of this ... when the situation becomes right, he added.

 Shares in the company ended nearly 1 per cent higher at Rs 1,116.35 in a firm Mumbai market.

 RILs petrol and diesel prices are about 5 per cent more than those of state-run Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum Corporation and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation.

 The private refiner, which has a market value of $33 billion, is expected to report a 7 per cent rise in net profit to Rs 9,700 crore in the full year to March 2006, according to Reuters Estimates.

 It has invested more than Rs 4,000 crore in its retail network, while its dealers have spent about Rs 1,500 crore.

 The company runs a 660,000-barrels-per-day refinery at Jamnagar, Gujarat, and sells fuel through a network of 1,300 retail outlets.

 Indias oil ministry should treat private firms in the same way as it does state-run oil retailers, Dhar said.

 If the government wants to protect the consumer, it can do so by giving subsidy to the entire oil sector and not only to state-run firms, he said, seeking a level playing field in retail fuel marketing.

 He said the state should also implement the recommendations of a government panel seeking a simpler tax structure for retail fuels.

 However, an official from Indias oil ministry said there was no provision in the government policy to subsidise private players, which were not obliged to sell their products at lower prices.

 About a year back at some places, private retailers were charging less on the sale of petrol products. They did not suffer losses at that time but the market share of state-run companies declined to a great extent, he said.

 RIL has already wound up bulk supplies and is going slow on its aggressive plans to set up retail outlets across India. 

 Essar Oil Ltd has cut operations, while oil major Shell has set up only 13 outlets in the country.

 Godrej puts TV foray on hold

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 3: Godrej amp; Boyce Manufacturing Company Ltd has put its plan to foray into colour television business on the backburner.

 The company, which entered the consumer electronics market with DVD players early this year, had already carried out a feasibility study of its CTV venture and the project was to begin this fiscal. However, a reversal in growth of the colour television business last financial year forced the company to hold back its plan, at least for the time being.

 We have not yet shelved the plan (to foray into CTV). We have decided to go slow about it. We are now cautious about our consumer electronics foray, said Kamal Nandi, vice-president (sales amp; marketing) of Godrej amp; Boyce Manufacturing Appliance Division.

 The consumer electronics market grew by only 5 per cent last financial year. The CTV segment, which constitutes the lions share in the domestic consumer electronics market, saw a negative growth. The domestic colour television market, particularly for CRT (cathode ray tube) televisions, is shrinking amidst stiff competition.

 George Menezes, chief operating officer of the division, said, We will instead focus on increasing our DVD sales during the current financial year.

 Launched in February, we have acquired a 3 per cent market share (in DVDs) till now and expect to shore it up to 7-8 per cent by the end of this financial year, said Nandi.

 However, the company has no plans to manufacture DVDs in the near future. The company now outsources the products from China and other Southeast Asian countries. The sales volume needs to achieve a critical mass to make manufacturing them on your own an economic sense, Nandi said.

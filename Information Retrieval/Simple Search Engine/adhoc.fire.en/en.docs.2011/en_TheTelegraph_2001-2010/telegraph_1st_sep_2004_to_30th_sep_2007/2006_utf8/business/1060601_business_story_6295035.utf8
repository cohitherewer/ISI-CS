 OUR BUREAU

 Booster dose

 May 31: Dr Reddys Laboratories has reported a net loss of Rs 14.01 crore for the fourth quarter ended March 31 compared with a net loss of Rs 8.75 crore in the same period last year.

 The company lessened the pain of the loss by announcing a 1:1 bonus for shareholders.

 The bonus announcement boosted the falling DRL share prices on the BSE today. The scrip had slipped to an intra-day low of Rs 1,282.10 after opening at Rs 1,365. It closed at Rs 1,357.40, a loss of Rs 13.45 over the last finish.

 After posting profits in the previous three quarters, the company slipped back into losses during the fourth quarter due to lower returns from its high-margin international formulation business. Margins of the UK generics business was also lower.

 During the first nine months of fiscal 2005-06, international formulation business contributed 41 per cent to the total revenues of DRL. This came down to 30 per cent during the quarter.

 Total income during the quarter increased to Rs 524.98 crore from Rs 375.99 crore a year ago. 

 For the year ended March 31, DRL recorded a net profit of Rs 211.12 crore, a 223 per cent rise over Rs 65.46 crore in 2004-05. Total income shot up to Rs 2,136.57 crore from Rs 1,629.04 crore.

 Taking stock of the companys performance, chief executive officer G.V. Prasad said, During the year, we improved short-term profitability without compromising on our long-term strategic initiatives. We were able to achieve both these objectives through a combination of corporate initiatives and improvement in operations. 

 The companys revenues crossed the $500-million milestone, registering a 25 per cent growth, he added.

 Managing director and COO Satish Reddy said the losses were due to lower margins from the UK and the US and large acquisitions in Europe and America.

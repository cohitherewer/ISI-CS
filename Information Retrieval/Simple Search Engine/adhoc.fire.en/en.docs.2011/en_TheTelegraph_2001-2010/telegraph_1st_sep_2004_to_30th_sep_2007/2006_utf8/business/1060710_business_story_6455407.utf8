The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

New and better

 If you chose not to buy the old Ulips, you did yourself a favour, says Srikumar Bondyopadhyay 

 A notice at a Calcutta office of the Life Insurance Corporation bares it all: the insurer will reward agents who generate a composite premium of over Rs 20,000 during the month-long campaign period that ended on May 31 by selling any one or all of the following six plans ? Jeevan Tarang, Jeevan Akshay, Bima Bachat IV, Bima Nivesh, Future Plus and Jeevan Plus. 

 Barring Jeevan Tarang and Jeevan Akshay, all the others are unit-linked insurance plans (Ulips) which in their earlier form ceased to exist from July 1. So, it was a last minute rush from the country?s largest life insurer to sell as many Ulips as possible before these are relaunched in the new format in compliance with the revised guidelines put out by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA). 

 However, LIC was not the only one running hard before the June 30 deadline; private insurers were also looking to snare unwary customers. 

More cover

 Buyers who have chosen not to buy Ulip policies in this last-minute scramble to beat a deadline have done better. The new Ulips will not only come with a higher coverage (read sum assured), but the premium costs of these plans will also be lower. 

Transparent

 ?Insurers are now required to disclose the various fees and charges in their respective plans. This disclosure will entail a standardisation of cost and fee structure in Ulips because buyers will now compare the costs more easily,? said an official of Birla Sun Life Insurance Company. Insurers, who have been making money hand over fist from Ulips, will have to rework their cost and fee structure to remain competitive. 

New kids on the block

 As of now, only a couple of life insurers, notably Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance Company and Birla Sun Life Insurance Company, have come up with a portfolio of new unit-linked plans. ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company has launched a single premium Ulip and LIC has introduced a pension plan. Others are waiting to understand the cost and fee structure of their competitors before they come up with their own schemes. 

Low premium

 Interestingly, the new Ulips of Bajaj Allianz and Birla Sun Life come with a significantly lower premium. 

 ?There is a structural change in the new plans,? explained a Bajaj Sun Life official. ?In many of our earlier plans, the death benefit included the sum assured plus the unit value. But under the new IRDA norms, the death benefit should be the higher of the two (sum assured or the investment value). So, we had reworked the pricing and the premium table,? she added. 

 Although the fees and charges in Bajaj Sun Life?s new Ulips still remain heavily front-loaded (charges are high during the first year and gradually reduce), the basic premium cost, including the charges, is lower than in old Ulips. For example, in its new Flexi Save Plus Endowment plan, the premium allocation charge is 29.9 per cent for policies with a premium paying term between six and nine years. Earlier, the allocation charge would have been 32 to 33 per cent. Now a higher portion of your premium will be allocated to buying units in the investment fund than before. In Bajaj Allianz Life?s UnitGain Super plan, the allocation to investment fund out of premium paid has been increased to 88 per cent from 85 per cent earlier. 

Fund management fees

 However, different insurers still charge different fees for fund management. For example, Bajaj Sun Life charges up to a maximum of 1.5 per cent of the fund value under its Enhancer (growth) option, while the fund management fee is 1.75 per cent for the growth option in Bajaj Allianz?s scheme.

 ?The differential in charges such as fund management, premium allocation, and administrative fees will even out in the face of competition in the near future, thereby bringing down the cost of unit-linked plans,? said an LIC actuary. 

Mortality charges

 He added, ?Mortality charges are fixed, no one can charge a premium or a discount on that. The maximum commission an insurer can give to an agent is also fixed by the IRDA. These two comprise a major portion of the premium cost in an unit-linked plan. So, the insurers that are largely dependent on unit-linked plans will have to become more efficient in managing investments so that they can charge less on the fund management front.? 

 With the insurers requiring to disclose all the fees and charges in their respective unit-linked plans, it will be a field day for policy buyers. As a buyer, you can now shop for the low-cost policy from among the insurers. Besides, one can join a new Ulip during the first month of its launch at a net asset value of Rs 10. 

 As the returns in unit-linked plans are market determined, one can also check out the past performance of the insurer with its other Ulips as most of them are now over three years old.

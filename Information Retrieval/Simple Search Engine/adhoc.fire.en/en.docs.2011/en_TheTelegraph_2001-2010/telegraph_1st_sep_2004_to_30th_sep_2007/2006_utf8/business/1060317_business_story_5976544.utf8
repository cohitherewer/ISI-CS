 Airlines to take market flight before merger touchdown

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 16: Air-India and Indian Airlines will each offload a 15-20 per cent stake through initial public offerings, which are likely to hit the market in 2006-07, before going ahead with a planned merger.

 The stake sale and listing of the two airlines would be followed by a merger of the two by the end of the financial year. 

 Such a merger, which will create an airline with some 130 aircraft and flight rights to virtually all parts of the world, is needed to take on large players like Lufthansa and British Airways in the international skies and the Jet-Sahara combine at home.

 Senior officials of the civil aviation ministry said the government would soon bring before the cabinet a note on the initial public offerings and would also intimate its intention of eventually merging the two airlines. A 20 per cent stake in these two airlines is estimated to be worth about Rs 4,000 crore.

 The two airlines will offer employee stock options as part of the initial public offering. The proceeds will fund expansion programmes being undertaken by both the airlines. While Indian Airlines is buying some 43 Airbuses, Air-India will purchase around 68 Boeing aircraft. The total cost of these big-ticket purchases is expected to be nearly Rs 45,000 crore and the airlines want to perk up their equity base to leverage the huge loans needed to fund these purchases.

 Officials said the two airlines would come out with the initial public offerings after receiving equity boosters, which the government has already agreed in principle to grant them. Initially, the government will infuse about Rs 350 crore as equity in Indian Airlines, which currently has an equity base of just Rs 107 crore.

 Both Indian Airlines and Air-India were constituted in 1953 with an equity base of Rs 100 crore. Later on, an additional Rs 5 crore and Rs 2.14 crore were added to Indian Airlines equity. Investment analysts, however, have always opined that the two airlines are drastically under-capitalised.

 The new capital issue is likely to fetch around Rs 2,000 crore for each airline as the nominal face value share of Rs 10 is likely to be sold at a massive premium. 

 This infusion of funds should help meet some of the expenditure on new aircraft as well as leverage cheap loans from international financiers for aircraft purchase.

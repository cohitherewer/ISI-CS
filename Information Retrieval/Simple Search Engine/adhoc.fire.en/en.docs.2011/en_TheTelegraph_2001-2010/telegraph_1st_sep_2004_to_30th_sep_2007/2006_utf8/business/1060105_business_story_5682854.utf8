The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 New chief at Dow Jones 

 KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

 New York, Jan. 4: In a 

 management shake-up, Dow Jones amp; Co, which publishes 

 The Wall Street Journal, named a successor Tuesday 

 to its chief executive, Peter R. Kann, bypassing Kanns 

 wife, Karen Elliott House, publisher of The Journal, 

 who is leaving the company.

 Dow Jones picked its chief operating 

 officer, Richard F. Zannino, as chief executive, ending 

 the reign of one of the storied power couples of the corporate 

 media world. Kann announced the changes Tuesday morning 

 at his monthly meeting with senior managers.

 Though House had a higher profile 

 inside and outside the company, she reported to Zannino, 

 and he increasingly was seen inside Dow Jones as the likely 

 successor to Kann. Her rise had concerned some insiders 

 who felt that it created a conflict for the chairmans 

 wife to hold such a senior post.

 The appointment of Zannino, 47, 

 who joined Dow Jones in 2001 as chief financial officer 

 and is the first non-journalist to run the company in modern 

 times, was welcomed on Wall Street, where the companys 

 shares rose sharply after the announcement. Along with the 

 personnel changes, the company said its fourth-quarter earnings 

 would be better than expected. Dow Jones shares rose $3.65 

 to close at $39.14.

 The appointment could presage 

 other major changes at Dow Jones and The Journal, 

 its flagship paper. The announcement comes at a tumultuous 

 time for the newspaper industry, with readers and advertisers 

 defecting to the Internet. But the last several years, since 

 the dot-com bubble burst, have been particularly difficult 

 for The Journal, which is more dependent than most 

 papers on technology and financial advertising.

 As reporters, Kann and House both 

 won Pulitzer Prizes for international reporting at The 

 Journal and rose quickly up the corporate ladder, with 

 Houses promotion to publisher coming in 2002 during 

 Kanns tenure after she ran The Journals 

 international operations in the 1990s. Kann had been named 

 publisher of The Journal in 1989 and chief executive 

 of Dow Jones in 1991.

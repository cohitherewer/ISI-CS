 Reckitt earnings up 13%

 London, July 24 (Reuters): Reckitt Benckiser, the worlds biggest maker of household goods, reported a 13 per cent rise in second-quarter net profit on Monday and raised its profit growth target for the year. 

 The maker of Cillit Bang cleaner, Finish/Calgonit dishwash products and Lysol disinfectants, said it had seen a strong first half, while Bootss non-prescription drugs unit, acquired earlier this year, contributed ahead of expectations.

 But the shares dipped 2.3 per cent to ?20.28 by 9:30 am after a recent strong run, with analysts saying the increase in the profit target was positive, but appeared to be in line with consensus expectations and would not inspire the stock. 

 The results are in line with forecasts across the board, but Reckitt usually beats forecasts so that is why we are seeing some weakness to the shares, one analyst said. 

 Chief executive Bart Becht said the group had seen profit margins rise above its expectations, while costs had been kept under control and even tough mature European markets saw first-half revenues grow 5 per cent. 

 The UK-based maker of Mr Sheen polish and Lemsip and Disprin cold remedies posted second-quarter adjusted net profit of ?162 million, in line with analysts consensus forecast of ?161 million. 

 The result was margin-performance driven, while costs were kept under control and likely to be for the rest of the year, Becht told a conference call after the results. 

 The company added that its half-year operating margin before restructuring rose 70 basis points to 17.8 per cent. 

 The group upgraded its targeted growth in adjusted 2006 net profit to 14 per cent at actual exchange rates from a low double-digit rise at constant currencies set at the start of 2006. 

 Becht said currency swings meant there would be little difference between constant and actual rates for the full year. 

 The company held its target for net revenue to grow in the full year 2006 by 15 per cent at constant exchange rates. 

 Reckitt shares have outperformed the FTSE 100 index by over 5 per cent since the start of the year, and are at a premium to European rivals. 

 Overall second-quarter group revenues rose 19 per cent, 17 per cent at constant exchange rates, boosted by new products such as Vanish Oxi Action Crystal White fabric cleaner, Airwick Freshmatic, Cillit Bang Stain and Drain and Finish 5 in 1. 

 Becht said the integration of the Boots business, which makes Nurofen painkillers and Strepsils throat lozenges, was on track with ?75 million of cost savings due by 2008. 

 Reckitt bought the Boots unit on February 1 for ?1.9 billion.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Word of advice for Orissa

 PRABUDDHA S. JAGADEB

 Bhubaneswar, March 7: Orissa needs to strike the right balance between private and social interests to make growth equitable and inclusive, according to the World Bank, which conducted an investment climate assessment survey of the state.

 The World Bank has given this advice to the Naveen Patnaik government, which is at the crossroad of development and displacement. 

 The survey, a copy of which is available with The Telegraph, has noted that balancing the private and social interests remains a particular challenge for Orissa.

 The legacy of mining and industrial development in the 60s and 70s caused a significant environmental degradation and social deprivation and that continues to give rise to doubts about the broad-based benefits of investment and growth agendas. The ability of the government to resolve this conflict for future investments will be key to creating a more balanced and stable economy, the survey said. 

 The survey was done at the behest of the state government months before the 12 tribals were killed in Kalinga Nagar following their clash with the police.

 The survey advised the state government to grant mining leases on a first come, first serve basis. Any discrimination in the selection criteria for granting mining leases such as the applicants ability or commitment to establish downstream industrial facilities should be avoided.

 The survey noted that corruption still remained the bane of the state and needed to be addressed immediately. About 90 per cent of the sample comprised small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in manufacturing, food processing, mineral processing, metal work and tourism.

 Almost two-thirds of the managers (62 per cent) interviewed in six urban centres of Bhubaneswar, Cuttack, Rourkela, Berhampur, Puri and Keonjhar rated corruption as a severe obstacle to business operations and growth. 

 Pointing out that Inspector Raj is still widely prevalent, the survey shows an average of 12 inspection visits in the year leading up to the survey. This is almost double the overall Indian average of 6.5 visits per year. Managers in Orissa have reported 13 per cent of their time being spent on attending to such visits. Not surprisingly, South Korean steelmaker Posco, whose $12-billion investment is the largest investment in India, has underlined the need for a hassle-free approval, the World Bank study said.

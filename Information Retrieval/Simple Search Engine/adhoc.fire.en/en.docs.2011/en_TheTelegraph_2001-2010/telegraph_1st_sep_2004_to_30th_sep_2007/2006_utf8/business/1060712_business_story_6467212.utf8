 Hyundai hikes car prices

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, July 11: Hyundai Motor India today announced a price hike across various models, including the Santro, to offset the increase in costs of input materials and freight. While the price of the Santro will go up by Rs 3,500, the companys premium compact Getz will be dearer by Rs 1,601-2,601, a company official said, adding that the hike would be effective from tomorrow.

 The mid-size Accent will be expensive by Rs 1,600-2,600 between various variants, while the Elantra sedan will be dearer by Rs 6,300. The CRDi LP variant of the Elantra will see prices go up by as much as Rs 26,300.

 Price of the Sonata and the SUV Tuscon will see a marginal hike of Rs 700.

 Last month, Arvind Saxena, vice-president (marketing and sales), had said, We will increase the prices of cars from this month-end as there is a lot of pressure due to higher costs of prices of inputs like plastics and rubber.

 Managing director Heung Soo Lheem had said the company was absorbing the hike in production costs for some time. But all that put together is too much to absorb and thus we will raise prices.

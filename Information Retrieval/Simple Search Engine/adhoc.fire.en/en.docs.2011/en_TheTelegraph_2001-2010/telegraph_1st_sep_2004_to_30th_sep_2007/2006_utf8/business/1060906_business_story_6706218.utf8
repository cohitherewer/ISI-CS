New Delhi, Sept. 5: The bandwidth battle has started to escalate.

 Mahanagar Telephone Nigam (MTNL) and Bharat Sanchar Nigam (BSNL) have decided to join hands to lay a submarine cable system that will connect India to Southeast Asia and West Asia to meet the growing demand for international bandwidth.

 Union IT and communications minister Dayanidhi Maran made the announcement here today and added that eventually, the cable system would be extended to the US and Europe.

 With MTNL and BSNL throwing their collective hats into the ring, Anil Ambani-controlled Reliance Communications and Tata-run VSNL have competition on their hands.

 Maran made the announcement even as he inaugurated Reliance Communicationss Falcon cable system, which is touted as the largest undersea cable network and is expected to pare international bandwidth costs further. Falcon connects 11 countries across three continents.

 The 2.56-terrabit undersea cable stretches almost 11,859 km from Mumbai to Egypt and covers Oman, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar and Saudi Arabia.

 VSNL which dominates the countrys international bandwidth capacity had recently announced setting up a cable system between India, West Asia and Europe at a total cost of $600 million to be ready within the next 18 months.

 In the increasingly competitive bandwidth market, there will always be new players, but our aim will continue to be to expand our international presence, a VSNL spokesperson said.

 With 5 million new subscribers every month, and the industrys target of getting 20 million subscribers by 2010, India is poised to witness a huge demand for bandwidth.

 Maran said in view of the potential growth in international bandwidth requirement, all operators are trying to establish their own cable systems to meet future demand.

 The India-Sri Lanka submarine 

 cable project by BSNL is on the verge of being launched, 

 he said.

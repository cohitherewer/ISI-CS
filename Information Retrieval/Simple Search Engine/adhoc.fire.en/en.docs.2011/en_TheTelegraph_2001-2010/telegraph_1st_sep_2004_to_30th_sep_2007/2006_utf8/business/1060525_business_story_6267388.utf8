 New Delhi, May 24: Information technology minister Dayanidhi Maran today said the government would set up special economic zones in telecom, to make India a manufacturing hub.

 He said the government would make cellphones for Rs 1,000 by next year. 

 ?We are hopeful of investments in the region of $10 billion in manufacturing in the next 2-3 years,? the minister said.

 The government would set up an export promotion council that would impart the necessary thrust to the export of telecom equipment, Maran said.

 Nokia was the first company to get a permission to set up an SEZ in Tamil Nadu to manufacture telecom equipment and mobile handsets. 

 Production at the Nokia unit began early this year, and the company will invest $150 million in the SEZ to meet the growing demand for handsets and network infrastructure in the Asia-Pacific region. 

 At a press conference here today, in which he highlighted the achievements of the UPA government in the past two years, Maran set a target of providing 500 million phone connections by 2010.

 The government had earlier set a target of 250 million connections by 2007. The current subscriber base is about 150 million. ?Now, we are setting a target of 500 million telephone connections by 2010,? he said. 

 He said the government aims to release 45 mhz of spectrum by the end of this year. ?The department of telecommunications, along with the ministry of defence, had already taken up a Rs 1,000-crore project to release 45 mhz of spectrum by the end of this year,? he said.

 The government also plans to provide spectrum for the third generation mobile services.

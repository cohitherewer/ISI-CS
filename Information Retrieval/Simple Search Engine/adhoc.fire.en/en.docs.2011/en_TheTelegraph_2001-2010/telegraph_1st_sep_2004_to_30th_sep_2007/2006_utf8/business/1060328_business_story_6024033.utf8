 Tax trouble in penny stocks

 Mumbai, March 27 (PTI): The investigative wing of the income tax department has unearthed tax evasion up to Rs 400 crore in the secondary market dealing in penny stocks, a senior officer said. 

 Authorities anticipate the amount could touch over Rs 1,000 crore.

 We were informed through market intelligence that there were a lot of transactions at the capital market, particularly through bulk deals in penny stocks. This led us to conduct massive searches in Maharashtra and Gujarat, the official from the Directorate of Income Tax (Investigation) said.

 The department first collected details of bulk deals from exchange websites. The officials found over 100 names appearing repeatedly in a number of scrips. The exchanges keep details of large transactions made by every broker, the official said.

 After scrutinising the available details, the department stumbled upon some facts, which provided leads to track the offenders.

 We have found that the bills were issued by a number of people who were posing as brokers and sub-brokers, which they were not, the official said.

 There were also more than five brokers, who have admitted misuse of their trade name by issuing bogus bills and their names, he said.

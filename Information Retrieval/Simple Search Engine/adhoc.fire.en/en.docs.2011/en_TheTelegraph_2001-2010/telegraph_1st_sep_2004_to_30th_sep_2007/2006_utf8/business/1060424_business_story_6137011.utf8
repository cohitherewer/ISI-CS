 Petronet meets green norms for Kochi terminal 

 S.P.S. PANNU 

 Green signal

 New Delhi, April 23: Petronet LNG Ltd (PLL) has obtained the environmental clearances for the Kochi liquefied natural gas terminal and is planning to cruise ahead with the project. 

 PLL director (technical) Sham Sundar told The Telegraph that Tractabel of Belgium, Japanese company IHI, Technimont of Italy and French firm Technigen have emerged as the front runners to set up the Rs 2,300-crore LNG terminal.

 The capacity of the terminal, which was initially planned at 2.5 million tonnes per annum, has now been increased to 5 million tonnes and for this the size of the storage tanks has been increased from 1,10,000 tonnes to 1,55,000 tonnes. 

 The increased size of the tankage required a fresh set of environmental approvals which have now been obtained and work will proceed once the engineering project contract is awarded, Sundar said. 

 The LNG terminal at Kochi was proposed in 1998 by PLL, a joint venture of major national oil companies (IOC, BPCL, GAIL, HPCL) and foreign partners Gaz de France and Ras Gas of Qatar. 

 The Dahej LNG terminal in Gujarat, which was proposed along with Kochi, became operational two years ago but work on the Kochi terminal has fallen behind schedule. The delay in getting environmental clearances was a major cause of concern. 

 Regasified LNG is now available from PLL Dahej terminal through GAIL pipelines at $4.3 per mmbtu (million metric British thermal units) to power plants, fertiliser producers and sponge iron units. Originally, the LNG supply for the Kochi terminal was contracted until 2008 to Ras Gas of Qatar. 

 The gas earmarked for the Kochi project has been re-allocated to Dahej, where the capacity has already been doubled and gas supply from Iran was earmarked for Kochi terminal.

 However, relations with Iran have taken a turn for the worse over the nuclear issue. Iran has been isolated on the issue but was expecting Indian support. However, India did not want to compromise its stand because of its energy requirement and has separated the two issues. 

 India is banking on the fact that Iran has to find a market for its gas and India is an attractive proposition as the western countries have distanced themselves from Tehran.

 PLL is looking for LNG from Australia for the Kochi terminal and the talks are reported to be at an advanced stage.

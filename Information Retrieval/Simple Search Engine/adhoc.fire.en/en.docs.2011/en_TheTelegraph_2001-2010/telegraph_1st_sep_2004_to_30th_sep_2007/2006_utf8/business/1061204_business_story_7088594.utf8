The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Alls well for MNCs, barring infrastructure

 The road ahead

 New Delhi, Dec. 3: With India becoming one of the most preferred investment destinations, estimates reveal that 70 per cent of foreign investors are making profits from their operations in the country and 83 per cent are considering expansion of business.

 However, lack of infrastructure still remains a sore point with foreign investors.

 Almost seven in 10 foreign investors have reported profits from their Indian operations. Ninety one per cent of the profit-making companies say they have been successful in meeting their profitability targets, said the annual foreign direct investment survey conducted by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci).

 A look at the evaluation of infrastructure facilities in India by the foreign investors, however, showed they are disappointed with the condition of roads and highways in the country. 

 Fifty four per cent of the companies have rated the condition of roads and highways as bad, while 42 per cent have put the power and port facilities in the same category.

 The chamber surveyed 76 current foreign direct investors across various industries and verticals with a turnover ranging between Rs 1 crore and Rs 100 crore and few above Rs 100 crore.

 Investor confidence in the government machinery to attract more FDI has gone up. 

 While only 43 per cent respondents rated government efforts to attract FDI as average in the 2005 survey, the proportion of respondents thinking the same has increased to 83 per cent this time.

 Around 87 per cent of the respondents said there were opportunities for greater FDI in India. This seems realistic with a vast majority of current foreign investors realising their profitability targets from their Indian operations.

 Moreover, Indias perception as a manufacturing base has reasonably improved over the last two years.

 While 32 per cent of the participating companies rated India as an attractive manufacturing base in the survey of 2005, the proportion has increased to 48 per cent in the recent survey. 

 Around 67 of the respondents have cited intense competition as a constant feature while describing the Indian market. However, with domestic and foreign players scaling up operations, respondents said there is a crunch in the availability of skilled manpower.

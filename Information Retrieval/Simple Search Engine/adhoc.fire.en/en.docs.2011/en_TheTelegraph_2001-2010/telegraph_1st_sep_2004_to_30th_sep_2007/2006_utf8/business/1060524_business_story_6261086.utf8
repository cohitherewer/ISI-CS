 Bangalore, May 23: Intel president and CEO Paul S. Otellini today unveiled a PC that is at least 20 per cent cheaper than the lowest Intel-based PCs available in the market. 

 The worlds largest chipmaker will spearhead the sell of low-cost PCs in the country to increase the use of computers.

 With only 2 per cent of Indias population having a PC or an Internet connection, the challenge is large. By multiplying the effects of computers, Internet and education, we can accelerate the reach of the technologys benefits across the country in the next five years, Otellini said. 

 The high-quality PCs with easy-to-use interface will have similar feature-rich configurations of a lowest Intel-based PC and will be available within the next two months. The PCs will be distributed through HCL, Millennium, PCS, Wipro and Zenith Computers. 

 Intel plans to spend $1 billion over the next five years to promote Internet use and computer training in India.

 The programme, dubbed World Ahead, unifies Intels local efforts to give high-speed wireless Internet access to the Indian population who cant get online.

 India will play a key role in designing and developing computing technologies that will be used worldwide under the World Ahead programme, Otellini said.

 By working with the countrys leading businessmen and government leaders, and developing the technology locally, we want to create a sustainable environment that offers the right tools to meet the needs of the local people, he said.

 Intel would also collaborate with ICICI Bank to facilitate loans for buyers. 

 Otellini said small, affordable and rugged learning devices for students based on Intel platforms called Eduwise would be available here by the first half of 2007. The notebook PC is designed for use by an individual student and teacher. 

 The hardware and software for the student learning device has been developed at Intels Bangalore centre, one of four such centres worldwide that builds specialised products for emerging markets.

 Mumbai, Jan. 10: Oracle Corporation is expanding its operations in India. Besides increasing its total headcount to 10,000 in the country, Oracle will be present in nine more non-metro cities.

 The expansion plans reflect Indias role in Oracles global operations, both as a market and as a centre of product development, Oracle Corporation president Charles Phillips said.

 Phillips, who was in the city to participate in Oracle OpenWorld 2006, said the company will enter nine non-metro cities, including Ahmedabad, Chandigarh, Coimbatore, Indore, Jaipur, Kochi, Lucknow, Pune and Viskahkapatnam.

 After the expansion plans are implemented, Oracle will be present in over 15 cities. Oracle also plans to increase its partner network for additional support. It plans to reach more industry segments, particularly the small and medium (SME) enterprise market. Oracle currently has 275 partners in India with 75 being added in 2005. Close to 80 per cent of its licence revenue in the country is generated through partners.

 Oracle is planning to increase its headcount in the country to more than 10,000 over the next eight months. The additional resources will be in sales and marketing, product development, consulting, product, support and services. In India, Oracle employs 17 per cent of its total worldwide staff of 51,000.

 Phillips said, We have been in India for more than 19 years and the infrastructure we have put in place now enables us to go beyond the metros into the cities that are the up and coming economic engines of India. He said over the past five years, the corporation has invested close to $2 billion in the country.

 According to Derek Williams, executive vice-president, Asia Pacific, Oracle Corporation, India now has over 6,000 technology customers and many of the companys key global partners are also from the country. These include Infosys, Satyam, Wipro and TCS.

 Looking ahead

 Calcutta, April 23: TVS Electronics (TVS-E) is eyeing a 45 per cent share of the domestic dot matrix printer market and hopes to retain the second position in the overall printer segment. In the Saarc region, it is the second largest player in dot matrix printers.

 The companys dot matrix printer business grew 37 per cent by volume last fiscal. Its market share by revenue was around 23 per cent.

 Growth in market share for dot matrix printers would be driven mainly by small and medium enterprises (SMEs). The company has an existing market share of 33 per cent in the SME segment, which is expected to cross 40 per cent, said S. Narendran, head of marketing and printer business, TVS Electronics.

 TVS-E spends 6 per cent of its turnover on research and development. The company has introduced a printer with a cost of 2 paise per page compared with the prevailing 8 paise to 10 paise per page, Narendran added.

 The printer business generated a turnover of Rs 150 crore last fiscal, and the company expects to maintain over 20 per cent growth rate this year.

 The government has been a dominant revenue generator for the dot matrix printer business of the company. TVS-E also has a 50 per cent market share in the banking and insurance sectors. 

 The domestic dot matrix printer market is valued at Rs 330 crore while that for printers is Rs 1,000 crore.

 Narendran said the business has grown as SMEs are increasingly automating their operations, especially after the introduction of the value-added tax. Their buying power has also increased. A large percentage, therefore, would be first-time users. In India the SME market comprises 7.5 million businesses, of which 21 per cent uses computers.

 An AMI-Partners study shows that 40 per cent of the non-PC small businesses are planning to purchase 1.4 desktops on an average next year. This means a future planned hardware budget of over $570 per business.

 India Inc gets red mark in green initiative

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Cause for concern

 Calcutta, Oct. 6: Indian companies are less concerned with environment pollution than their foreign peers. They attach more value to efficiency parameters associated with employees.

 These are the findings of a survey on corporate values by ECCO International Communications Network, a group of 35 public relations companies, which encompassed 12 countries, 14 sectors and 3,236 companies.

 ECCOs first Corporate Value Index 2006 says companies across the world attach the most value to quality, innovation, customer satisfaction and integrity, while social responsibility, safety, ethics and communications get low priority.

 Of the 301 Indian companies in the survey, as many as 140, or 47 per cent, assign core corporate value to customer satisfaction, quality and innovation and skill. Social responsibility comes a distant 10th in the ranking. The last on the list is the involvement of employees in decision-making, with only 12 companies considering employees participation as a corporate value. 

 Workplace safety and environment concerns are also ranked lower by Indian companies vis--vis their overseas counterparts. Indian companies rank environment as 21st and workplace safety as 26th. Internationally, however, environment is ranked fifth and workplace safety 17th.

 The index for defined corporate values is 4.3 for India against the global average of 5. This value is highest for Germany at 7.7, followed by 6.9 for Hungary and 6.5 for the US. Italy is last at 2.5.However, there, is no index associated with transparency in the study. 

 Transparency is important in the wake of the WorldCom and Enron accounting scandals that led to the Sarbanes-Oxley audit rules mandatory for listing on the US stock markets.

 Rallis blueprint for surge in exports

 About to spread

 Calcutta, Sept. 3: Agro-chemicals firm Rallis India Ltd, a Tata enterprise, has appointed an international consultant to chart out a roadmap to double its international business within the next three to five years. Around 20 per cent of the companys Rs 630.35-crore turnover last fiscal came from international business and exports. 

 We have identified two thrust areas as part of our long term growth vision seeds and international business. As a company, we would expect the share of exports, or international business, to go up 40 to 42 per cent in the next three to five years, which currently is not up to the mark as other Indian companies with lesser revenues have half their shares coming from international business, said V. Shankar, chief operating officer of Rallis India. 

 The consultant, who Shankar declined to name, will be presenting a report in the next couple of months on the strategy required to tap the opportunities existing in new markets, technology and focus areas in the agro-chemicals business internationally. Rallis is also open to inorganic growth options. The agro-chemicals market in India is valued at around Rs 3,500 crore. While the industry failed by 12-15 per cent last year, Rallis, supported by its domestic business, had a growth of 6 to 7 per cent and is targeting a double-digit growth this year. 

 The company is the second largest agro-chemical firm after Bayer which has a market share of around 18 per cent with a market share of 14 per cent. 

 The seeds business of the company, which is also another focus area, contributes less than 10 per cent to its turnover, which, according to the company, should increase 10 to 20 per cent in three to five years. 

 The seed portfolio covers cereals, pulses, oilseeds, fibre crops as well as vegetables. 

 We produce and market several hybrids/research varieties of maize, paddy, wheat, cotton, jute, mustard, castor, soya bean and gram. But we are looking more at alliances, like we have for Bt cotton, as seed-breeding programmes are typically very time consuming taking six to seven years, Shankar said. 

 Rallis will also set up a formulation unit in Jammu, which will have a capacity of 5,000 to 6,000 million tonnes (mt) per annum, at an investment of Rs 10 crore. It will shift a couple of its formulation facilities to Jammu from Andhra Pradesh. 

 The company has factories spread across five locations in the country with one of the largest production capacity of 10,000 mt of technical grade pesticide and 30,000 tonnes per litre of formulation per annum. 

 The company had launched an insect growth regulator (IGR) called Applaud in Bengal, which would counter the brown plant hoppers (categorised as a destroyer) for paddy and mealy bugs for grapes.

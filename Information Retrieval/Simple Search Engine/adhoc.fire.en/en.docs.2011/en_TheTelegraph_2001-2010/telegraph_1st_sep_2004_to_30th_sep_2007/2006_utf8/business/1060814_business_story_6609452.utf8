 NJMC expands reform scope

 New Delhi, Aug. 13 (PTI): The government has decided to revive a National Jute Manufacturers Corporation (NJMC) mill in Bihar along with two in Bengal. The Board for Reconstruction of Public Sector Enterprises (BRPSE) has approved the plan. 

 The government had earlier decided to revive the Kinnison and Khardah mills of NJMC, but another mill at Kathiyar in Bihar was included for revival later, sources said.

 The revised scheme to revive the public sector jute company has also got the approval of BRPSE, they added.

 NJMCs revival will not require any fresh infusion of funds as the company had earlier got a financial support of Rs 978 crore for the voluntary retirement scheme and for liquidating statutory arrears, gratuity and secured liabilities.

 If more funds are needed, they can be raised from sale of company assets as five of its six mills are situated in and around Calcutta.

 The net worth of NJMC, which was suffering cash losses since its inception through the nationalisation of the mills, was referred to the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR) in 1992. Various revival proposals were drawn up when the company was with the BIFR, but all of them were turned down. In 2004, the BIFR ordered to close down the company. Advised by the government, the company management challenged it in Calcutta High Court and a stay order was issued, which is still in force.

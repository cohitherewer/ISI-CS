 Mixed bag in farm credit

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 8: Agricultural borrowers in Bengal, on an average, owe the co-operative credit system Rs 48,778, notwithstanding a relatively high recovery rate in the last few years. The other two states, which are ahead of Bengal in terms of the agricultural co-operative credit outstanding, are Himachal Pradesh and Manipur.

 The recovery rates of agricultural co-operative credit societies in the state, however, have been high, especially since 2001 when compared with other states. Credit societies in Bengal have, on an average, managed to recover about 60 per cent of the outstanding loans. Although this is still way behind Punjab, which has a 92.7 per cent recovery record and Haryana (88 per cent), Bengals record is impressive compared to states such as Assam (8 per cent) and Manipur (2 per cent).

 The onus of non-performing assets (NPAs) of agricultural co-operative credit entities in Bengal is also much lower (about 22 per cent) than the national average of 35.5 per cent. Manipur has the dubious record of possessing a 100 per cent NPA, which effectively means very little of agricultural loan lent out by the co-operatives in the north-eastern state have never been repaid.

 The co-operative societies of Assam have fared only marginally better than its neighbouring state. The overall NPAs of these entities in Assam stands at a whopping 98.7 per cent, followed by Orissa (87.5 per cent) and Bihar (83.7 per cent).

 As on March 31, 2003, the co-operative credit societies in Bengal had lent out agricultural loans to 1,80,000 members through 84 outlets and the loans outstanding stood at Rs 878 crore.

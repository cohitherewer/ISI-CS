 Scope for State Bank to raise Rs 9000 cr 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Aug. 25: The State Bank of India (SBI) may raise over Rs 9,000 crore through a combination of preference shares and a follow-on offering after the Union cabinet cleared the SBI (Amendment) Bill yesterday.

 The amendment comes at an appropriate time for the countrys largest bank, which continues to see a strong growth of credit. With Basel II norms set to be implemented from next year, SBI, like other banks, has outlined fund-raising plans. 

 Recently, an executive committee of the bank approved the raising of unsecured and rated rupee innovative perpetual debt instruments /upper Tier II subordinated debt up to Rs 5,000 crore. These funds will be raised during the remaining part of the current fiscal in tranches, with a minimum maturity period of over 60 months.

 If the SBI (Amendment) Bill is tabled and passed this year, the Reserve Bank of Indias (RBI) holding in SBI will come down to 51 per cent from the existing 59.73 per cent. At present, the central bank can only bring down its holding to 55 per cent in the bank. The lowering of this floor, therefore, provides a broad scope for another public offering from the bank.

 Sources close to the bank said there are two ways in which an offering can be made. There could either be a fresh issue of shares or the government could directly bring down the holding by offloading 8 per cent shares in the market. Though senior officials of SBI were not available for comment despite repeated attempts, sources said the bank could raise over Rs 4,000 crore at the current market prices by divesting the stake.

 On the BSE today, the SBI share received a major boost on news of the amendment. The counter attracted huge interest as market participants speculated on the possibility of a follow-on offering and a stock split by the bank. The SBI share, which played a major role behind the BSE sensex 40 points gain, ended at Rs 903.75, a rise of 3.39 per cent over its last close.

 The move was long awaited. It will be positive for SBI and its capital adequacy ratio (CAR) would improve, said Sarika Lohra, banking analyst at Angel Broking. 

 SBIs capital adequacy at the end of June was 11.97 per cent, against the minimum requirement of 9 per cent.

 Despite the amendment, there is still lack of clarity on whether the government has done away with the cap of 20 per cent fixed on foreign holdings (GDR and FII) in the bank. While it is understood that the Centre has retained this cap, analysts say that this could be a disappointment in the whole process as SBI may not be able to take full advantage of the relaxation given. During the quarter ended June 30, the FII holding in SBI was at 11.90 per cent and the Bank of New York depository held 7.88 per cent.

 Citigroup buys BAA shares

 London, June 2 (Reuters): A bank advising Spains Grupo Ferrovial was spending up to 1.35 billion ($2.52 billion) on shares in takeover target BAA Plc on Friday as it moved to secure its bid for the UK airports group, dealers and sources familiar with the situation said. 

 Citigroup, which advises Ferrovial on its 9.73-billion cash bid for BAA, was buying up to 150 million shares in the company at 900p per share, dealers said. 

 The raid sent BAA shares racing to a record high and came ahead of a final deadline next week for Ferrovial to raise its offer or for US investment bank Goldman Sachs to come in with a rival offer. 

 BAA shares were trading 2.7 per cent higher at 902p by 1053 GMT after hitting a record high of 907p. It was the first time the stock had matched Ferrovials 900p offer. 

 Citis move on behalf of Ferrovial shows the Spanish builder is trying to close the deal, although it also appears Ferrovial is not willing to pay more than its improved offer, a Spanish dealer said.

 Acquisition hunger strong in Tata Steel 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Muthuraman: Good show

 Mumbai, July 21: Tata Steel Ltd, which has declared a better-than-expected 3 per cent growth in net profit for the first quarter ended June 30, will continue to look at acquisitions in India, China and Southeast Asia.

 The strategy is part of Tata Steel?s ?de-integrated production? plan that requires it to be present in multiple locations. Tata Steel aims at becoming a 30-million-tonne steel company by 2015 and has already acquired Millennium Steel in Thailand and NatSteel Asia in Singapore.

 Tata Steel may increase its stake in Millenium Steel to 75 per cent in the current fiscal. ?Our stake in Millenium Steel may go up to 75 per cent provided we can buy the shares at the initial prices,? company deputy managing director T. Mukherjee said.

 In 2004, Tata Steel had acquired a 40 per cent stake in Millenium Steel for over $400 million, which was subsequently increased to 55 per cent. Currently, the company holds a 67.1 per cent stake in the Thailand-based company.

 Tata Steel had earlier raised $900 million for expansion and acquisitions. The company has a surplus cash of about Rs 4,000 crore.

 ?Tata Steel is constantly looking for acquisitions. We are looking at China now,? managing director B. Muthuraman said after the company announced its first quarter results. In raw materials too, the company is training its sights abroad. Tata Steel is planning to acquire coal mines in Australia and limestone facilities in Oman, Muthuraman added.

 The company has posted a net profit of Rs 953.41 crore in the first quarter, up from Rs 924.11 crore in the same period last year. Industry observers said the performance is commendable considering the fact that steel companies are expected to take a hit on bottomlines due to soft prices during the period.

 Muthuraman said under normal circumstances, Tata Steel would have lost close to Rs 300 crore as there was a drop of Rs 2,500 per tonne in steel prices during the period. The company, however, beat this trend because of higher volumes, better product mix and a sound marketing strategy.

 During the period, while production rose 17 per cent, sales were up 27 per cent because of lower inventories and turnover jumped 11 per cent. 

 On a stand-alone basis, steel production was 1,108,514 tonnes (948,926 tonnes), while sales stood at 1,115,066 tonnes (875,498 tonnes). 

 Net sales of the company was Rs 3,915.85 crore, up from Rs 3,557.06 crore in the same period last year.

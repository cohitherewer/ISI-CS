 Euronext, LSE eye merger

 London, April 9 (Reuters): The London Stock Exchange and Euronext have held secret talks about an all-shares merger of equals to create a European super exchange valued at about ?6 billion ($10.5 billion), The Observer said on Sunday. 

 The newspaper said detailed discussions on a nil-premium merger deal had taken place between Paris-based Euronexts financial advisers Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch representing the LSE. 

 The plans could be put before Euronexts shareholders at the annual meeting on May 23, the paper said. 

 It also quoted unnamed sources saying that in the event of a merger with Euronext, the LSE would be valued at about ?12 a share and its chief executive Clara Furse would be offered the opportunity to continue to run the LSE from its British base.

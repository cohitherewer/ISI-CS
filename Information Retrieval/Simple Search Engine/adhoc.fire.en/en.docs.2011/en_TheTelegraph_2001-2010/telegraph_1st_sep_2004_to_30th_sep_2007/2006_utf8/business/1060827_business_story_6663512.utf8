 Exide export unit in Haldia

 SOHINI MOOKHERJEA

 Ganguly: Big plans

 Haldia, Aug. 26: Exide Industries is setting up a plant in Haldia, adjacent to its existing facility, to manufacture traction batteries for the export market. To be set up in six to eight months, the plant will need an investment of Rs 60 crore.

 The foundation stone for the plant was laid by chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today. To be built on a 9-acre plot, the plant will have a total capacity of 1 million units. 

 Domestic demand is so high we are finding it difficult to satisfy both our local and foreign customers for some time. The new export facility will take care of the demand from these technologically-advanced markets, Exide chairman S.B. Ganguly said. 

 The state-of-the-art plant, which will manufacture traction batteries for forklift trucks, will cater to the export markets of Germany, the UK, Australia, Japan, Korea and Singapore. 

 Exide has targeted an export revenue of Rs 60-70 crore this year and expects the figure to reach Rs 200 crore in the next three years. 

 The plant and equipment for the Hadia unit have all been imported from Germany and Italy. 

 We tried getting a special economic zone (SEZ) status for the plant but have not succeeded. So we have decided to register the same as an export oriented unit (EOU), Ganguly said.

 The export-oriented plant will employ 150 people directly in the first year and 300 people during the next three years. 

 The capacity of 1 million units will be attained in phases while the initial amount of investment will be Rs 30 crore. 

 Speaking on the status of possible acquisitions in Germany and Switzerland, Ganguly said Exide is now focusing on deploying its resources to make the new plant a success. 

 Bhattacharjee, meanwhile, has requested the company to try and develop economically viable batteries for water transport, which would get a boost once eco tourism and water cruise projects in the Sunderbans take off.

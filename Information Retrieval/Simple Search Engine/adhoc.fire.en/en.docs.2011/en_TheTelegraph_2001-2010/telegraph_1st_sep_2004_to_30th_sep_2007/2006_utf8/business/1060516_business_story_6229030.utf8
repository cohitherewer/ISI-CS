 Cement units get down to repair cracks

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Nath: In control

 New Delhi, May 15: The cement companies have assured the government that they will raise output in order to help bring down prices, commerce minister Kamal Nath said today. 

 However, they have asked for more time to come up with a comprehensive action plan to bring down prices as the three-day deadline set for the purpose came to an end. 

 Nath said the cement majors had also agreed to lower prices by 5 per cent for cement supplied for government projects. But this is considered a negligible amount as cement prices have soared by 50 to 60 per cent in recent months. 

 It still remains to be seen whether cement prices will fall significantly in the coming days. 

 The commerce ministry also tried to play down the issue today in sharp contrast to Friday when the deadline was issued and the minister had read out the riot act to the cement manufacturers. 

 Nath had dismissed arguments given by the Cement Manufacturers Association that the price rise was due to increase in costs of inputs such as coal, freight and power. He said prices should not have gone up by more than 7-8 per cent due to a rise in input costs. 

 The minister had called the meeting after builders complained of an abnormal rise in cement prices during the past five-six months. Cement prices have gone up by 40-50 per cent since November 2005 in the country, particularly in the northern and western regions. 

 The minister is reported to have pointed out that even after taking all input cost increases into account, the rise in the retail price of cement should have been about Rs 16 per bag only against the actual increase of Rs 41 per bag, which had taken place. 

 He had read the riot act to representatives of the cement manufacturers association, including major companies such as Gujarat Ambuja Cement Limited, J.K. Lakshmi Cement, J.P. Rewa Cement, Grasim Cement, Birla Cement Corporation and Associated Cement Company (ACC) Limited. These together account for over 80 per cent of Indias cement output. 

 The government cannot and will not remain a silent spectator, he had said, adding the cement companies are indulging in limitless profiteering. 

 India is the worlds second largest cement manufacturing country with production of about 150 million tonnes. Exports amount to about 9-10 million tonnes. Interestingly, cement prices have also been going up in neighbouring Pakistan where the government has threatened to import the commodity from India if prices did not come down.

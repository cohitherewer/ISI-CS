 Foreign rules for MFs on way

 Mumbai, April 9 (PTI): The Securities and Exchange Board of India has asked the Association of Mutual Funds in India to form draft guidelines for mutual fund investments in overseas equity.

 Yes, we have formed a committee for the purpose and are working on it. We will be providing our inputs and views on it to Sebi, Amfi chairman A.P. Kurian said.

 With budget 2006-07 relaxing norms for Indian mutual funds investment in overseas securities, fund houses in the country are waiting for the final whistle from the market regulator.

 Sebi is expected to come out with guidelines for overseas investments. Once it is done, we are ready to make the go, UTI Asset Management Company managing director and CEO U.K. Sinha said.

 Budget 2006-07 had proposed the removal of 10 per cent reciprocal shareholding requirement for mutual funds to invest in overseas instruments.

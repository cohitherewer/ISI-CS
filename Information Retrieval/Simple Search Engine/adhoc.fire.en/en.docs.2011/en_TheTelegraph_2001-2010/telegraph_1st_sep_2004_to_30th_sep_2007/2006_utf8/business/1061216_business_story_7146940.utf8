 FM gives good news on bad assets

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Dec. 15: The non-performing assets (NPAs) or bad loans of public sector banks were down both in absolute terms as well as a proportion to advances, Union finance minister P. Chidambaram said here today.

 I want to dispel the impression that NPAs are rising. NPAs are not mounting. Both gross and net NPAs have declined in absolute numbers as well as in proportion to the total advances, Chidambaram said in the Lok Sabha during question hour.

 He said outstanding gross advances of public sector banks have nearly doubled to Rs 11.35 lakh crore in March 2006 from Rs 5.78 lakh crore in March 2003, but gross NPAs were down to Rs 42,106 crore from Rs 54,090 crore. The percentage of NPAs to gross advances was down to 3.7 per cent from 9 per cent, the minister added.

 The recoveries of NPAs in 2005-06 were Rs 23,210 crore, including Rs 8,833 crore written off by banks after arriving at a compromise with the borrowers, he said.

 To a query by Rupchand Pal of the CPM on the possibility of the government monitoring use of bank funds to check speculation, the minister said this was unnecessary as bank boards have the mandate to track the use of funds.

 When asked whether banks were eyeing foreign capital to bridge the liquidity crunch arising from NPAs, the minister said the level of bad assets did not significantly impact liquidity of the banks.

 He said the list of defaulters was published only when a suit was filed by a defaulter, in reply to a question by Sujan Chakraborty of CPM. 

 The ministers optimism about the financial strength of banks appears to be supported by the rising prices of bank scrips on the stock market. 

 Public sector banks such as Canara has an NPA of 1.73 per cent much below the average of 3.7 per cent, though this points to some banks having an NPA more than this average.

 Bankers feel the amended securitisation act has helped in the recovery. PSU banks prefer to pursue recoveries on their own and consider transferring their cases to asset reconstruction companies as the last option.

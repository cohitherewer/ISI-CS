 Lehman settles Enron case

 Houston, Feb. 3 (Agencies): Enron Corp. said on Friday that Lehman Brothers has agreed to pay $69.9 million in cash to settle claims over certain equity transactions.

 Under the deal struck yesterday, Lehman will also withdraw with prejudice its $173 million claim against Enron, which filed a complaint against Lehman asserting preferences, fraudulent transfers and conveyances and recovery of payments.

 The settlement is subject to the approval of the US bankruptcy court for the southern district of New York.

 The deal is unrelated to the federal trial of former Enron CEOs Kenneth Lay and Jeffrey Skilling, who are accused of lying about Enrons financial health before it collapsed in December 2001.

 If approved, the deal closes a lawsuit filed by Enron in November 2003, almost two years after Enron filed for bankruptcy protection.

 The embattled energy conglomerate sought to recover $236 million in payments Enron claimed should never have been made to Lehman in 2001. The suit claimed that preferential payments to a stockholder were made at a time when Enron was truly insolvent.

 An insolvent company ? in this case, Enron ? is not allowed to make payments to stockholders, said Enron spokesman Harlan Loeb.

 Lehman is the first among four financial advisers to settle these claims. 

 Trial proceedings

 Enrons former investor relations chief has told jurors of the ongoing company trial that he pleaded guilty in August 2004 to aiding and abetting securities fraud because he helped mislead analysts by minimising losses or failing to accurately describe revenue.

 Its clear to me that, had that information been known to investors, large or small, they would not have made those same investment decisions, Mark Koenig, said on the second day of his testimony yesterday.

 Koenig, who is the governments first witness against the former Enron chiefs, had testified on Wednesday that bankrupt energy giant Enron falsified and exaggerated quarterly earnings estimates in 1999 and 2000 to meet or beat Wall Street expectations,

 The former chief of investor relations also contradicted ex-chairman Kenneth Lays defence that he was uninvolved with daily management and said former chief executive officer Jeffrey Skilling knew the company changed earnings reports to meet or beat forecasts.

 Jurors in the trial yesterday heard a recording of a 2001 conference call in which Skilling cursed at a Wall Street analyst asking tough questions. During the April 2001 call that has since become legendary on Wall Street, an irritated analyst pressed Skilling as to why he could not provide more details on the companys finances.

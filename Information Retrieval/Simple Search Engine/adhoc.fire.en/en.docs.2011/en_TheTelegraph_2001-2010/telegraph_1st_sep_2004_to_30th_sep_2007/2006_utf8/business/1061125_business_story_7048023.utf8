 Free STD bonanza from Reliance

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Happy hours

 Mumbai, Nov. 24: Reliance Communications has launched an STD card that allows subscribers to make free domestic long distance calls between 11 pm and 6 am.

 Available in only a single denomination of Rs 675 with a talktime of Rs 601, the card can be used to make free calls to and from any Reliance phone, including fixed wireless.

 Between 11 pm and 6 am, the calls will be free, but for all other calls during the day, subscribers would have to pay Re 1 per minute, a company statement said. The card has a validity of 30 days, within which the talktime has to be used. 

 This facility will be appreciated mainly by couples staying apart and wanting to have long conversations, students staying in hostels and wanting to stay in touch with families and BPO employees who are active at night, said S.P. Shukla, president (personal business) of Reliance Communications. 

 The companys 29 million subscribers can use this card irrespective of whether they use pre-paid or post-paid services. The cards will be available all over the country.

 The company is trying to make the most of the slack period between 11 pm and 6 am. During this time, the minutes of usage is very low, said a telecom analyst.

 A few days ago, the company had introduced an offer under which its mobile and fixed wireless pre-paid and post-paid customers could make calls at a tariff of Re 1 per minute to any network. It was introduced to cater to heavy STD users and was applicable on the Rs 675 denomination calling card. 

 Airtel, Hutch or Tata Indicom do not have any similar offer as of now.

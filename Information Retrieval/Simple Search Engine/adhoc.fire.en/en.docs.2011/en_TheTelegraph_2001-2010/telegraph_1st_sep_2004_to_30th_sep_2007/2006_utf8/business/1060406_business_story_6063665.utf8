 Slimmest Samsung mobile for US market

 Las Vegas, April 5 (Reuters): South Koreas Samsung Electronics will sell the slimmest cell phone in the US, aiming to compete with US market leader Motorolas popular Razr line.

 Equipped with a colour screen for playing videos and an external memory slot, the silver, candy-bar-shaped t509 phone is 9.8 mm thick, which makes it thinner than the 11.5-mm Slvr, a sibling of the clamshell Razr.

 Samsung will unveil the new phone and other models at the annual CTIA Wireless show in Las Vegas this week in a bid to boost its market share in the US, where it competes with Nokia and LG Electronics for the second place, according to the Gartner research group.

 The company, which ranks third after Nokia and Motorola Inc in the global handset market, hopes to cash in on the popularity of slim phones following the hit Razr.

 I dont know of anybody else thats doing anything this slim this year, said Peter Skarzynski, a senior vice president of Samsung.

 The new phone, which is too thin to squeeze in components for photo-taking found in most advanced cell phones, will hit store shelves in the second quarter, along with the d807, another skinny phone with a sliding lid.

 Skarzynski would not say which US cellular service providers would carry the phones.

 At Las Vegas, Samsung will also unveil the first cell phone in the US based on HSDPA, a network technology with fast data speeds suitable for delivering video and music to mobiles. The phone, called zx20, will likely work on Cingular, owned by AT amp;T Inc and BellSouth Corp, as it is the only US operator using HSDPA technology.

 Samsung hopes to win over some consumers by offering e-mail on another cell phone, the t719, which operates software based on Blackberry.

 MindTree logs on to Bhubaneswar

 SUBRAT DAS

 Bhubaneswar, March 27: MindTree Consulting will set up a software development centre in Bhubaneswar ? its first in the eastern region.

 MindTree, co-headquartered in Bangalore and Somerset in New Jersey, is the fifth big IT player to have zeroed in on Bhubaneswar. The other four are Infosys, Satyam, TCS and Wipro.

 Subroto Bagchi, chief operating officer of MindTree, yesterday signed a memorandum of understanding with the state government to set up the centre at Infocity, the IT hub spread over 250 acres on the outskirts of the city. The proposed development centre would be of the same size as its Bangalore centre.

 We have a long-term goal of recruiting about 5000 software professionals at the Bhubaneswar centre, said Bagchi, adding that at least 1000 would be employed within two years of operations.

 Around 30 acres will be acquired in Infocity and the construction work will start in 2006-07. The Bhubaneswar centre will focus on R amp;D, consultancy and software development. 

 MindTree develops enterprise solution methodology for business-to-business and business-to-consumer applications and communication services.

 Bagchi, however, declined to reveal the investment amount for the project. Its too early to say, but it will be substantial, he said.

 N. Krishna Kumar, president amp; CEO (IT services) of MindTree, said the company found the political leaders of Orissa quite responsive.

 Availability of talents weighed in favour of Bhubaneswar, said S. Janakiraman, president amp; CEO (R amp;D services). The company had a number of efficient managers from Orissa and Bengal, he added. 

 Chief minister Naveen Patnaik said his government was keen on developing Bhubaneswar as a major IT destination and had, therefore, adopted an industry-friendly IT policy. He said the first SEZ for IT and ITES would start in Infocity soon.

 An IT city will come up in Bhubaneswar soon, said chief secretary Subas Pani. According to state IT minister Surya Narayan Patro, 4000 IT professionals were already working in Bhubaneswar and the annual software export from the state had crossed Rs 500 crore.

 Last month, a senior team from Wipro Technologies, led by chief information officer Laxman Badiga, visited the city to finalise the companys plans for a development centre. Wipro is keen to start its operations this year with about 150-200 professionals.

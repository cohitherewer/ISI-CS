 Reliance signs deal to bring gas pipeline to Bengal

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Calcutta, April 14: Reliance Industries has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Bengal government to bring a gas pipeline from its Bay of Bengal reserve (off the Orissa coast) to the state.

 The development marks the first step by India?s largest private sector company towards investing in Bengal.

 Reliance officials came down to the city earlier this month to sign on the dotted line. However, neither the state nor Reliance could make a public announcement. While Bengal is headed for the polls, Reliance is now in a silent period because of the Reliance Petroleum public issue.

 The broad contours of the MoU says Reliance will undertake a detailed feasibility study to assess the demand for natural gas in Calcutta and the Haldia region.

 The state has also agreed to assist the company in acquiring the crucial right of way (RoW) to lay the pipeline. In other words, the government will help Reliance procure land to build the pipe network. 

 According to the plan, the first landfall point (where the undersea pipeline surfaces on land) will be Basudebpur on the north coast of Orissa. It will then be extended to Calcutta, through Haldia.

 The 400-kilometre pipeline will entail an investment of over Rs 1,000 crore.

 Reliance is primarily targeting industrial customers at Haldia, but the large unexplored Calcutta market is a big attraction for the company.

 Reliance can set up a large pipeline network within the city on the lines of Delhi and Mumbai, which will supply compressed natural gas (CNG) to the auto sector. A piped natural gas (PNG) network can also be developed to supply gas to home users and industry.

 According to the development plan of the Mahanadi basin reserve, known as NEC 25, Reliance can start production by the end of 2008 or early 2009. Early estimates suggest that 10 million standard cubic meter gas per day will flow in through this pipeline.

 Reliance may also link the mega reserve of the Krishna Godavri basin in offshore Andhra Pradesh with this pipeline. Reliance, along with its partner Niko Resources of Canada, has made six consecutive gas discoveries in the Mahanadi basin. Early indications suggest that the size of the find could be in the region of 2-3 trillion cubic feet. 

 GAIL is also considering a pipeline to Bengal. 

 Industry observers feel that Reliance could seek firm commitment from the government on an exclusive arrangement to serve the state. ?One will not commit such investment without exclusive marketing rights. It has not happened in Delhi or Mumbai where the city gas distribution industry has matured,? they said.

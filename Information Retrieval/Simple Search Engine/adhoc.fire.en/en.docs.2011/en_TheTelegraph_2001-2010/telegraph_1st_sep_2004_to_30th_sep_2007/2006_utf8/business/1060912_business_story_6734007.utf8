 Birla: Parting with debt

 Mumbai, Sept. 11: Aditya Birla Nuvo Ltd (ABNL) will raise up to Rs 780 crore through a rights issue to repay existing debt. It will also use part of the proceeds for general corporate purposes.

 The company, which has diversified interests, has invested in Idea Cellular, TransWorks and Birla Sun Life Insurance. It has also injected funds into its ongoing capital expenditure.

The benefit of additional shareholding is expected to be fully reflected in the financials of the company from the next quarter. ABNL has posted a consolidated turnover of Rs 4,830.3 crore during 2005-06.

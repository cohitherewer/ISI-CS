 Spat over oil bond delay

 S.P.S. PANNU 

 Source of discord

 New Delhi, Nov. 22 : The petroleum ministry has shot off a strong note to the finance ministry for not releasing oil bonds in time despite collecting advance taxes from the oil PSUs on the basis of higher expected revenues by the PSUs from the sale of the bonds.

 There has been no issue of the second tranche of oil bonds that was due on November 15, the petroleum ministry has curtly informed the finance ministry. Sources said Indian Oil Corporation, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum have factored in these payments in their books and paid an advance tax on them as well. 

 The oil PSUs hold a grudge against the finance ministry for treating them as cash cows, which are a source of fat revenues, while being indifferent to their operational problems. 

 The resentment runs deep since the finance ministry has delayed the issue of bonds on earlier occasions as well. 

 Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) had announced a net profit of Rs 3,050 crore during the second quarter (June to September) based on calculations of receipt of Rs 7,168 crore from the bonds that will be issued in three tranches. The government had approved bonds worth Rs 14,150 crore for the three downstream oil marketing companies.

 However, IOC received Rs 2,838 crore only on October 15. The next tranche, due on November 15, is yet to be released.

 Falling global oil prices have helped the oil marketing companies to cut losses to an extent, though they are still not out of the woods and are borrowing heavily to meet their working capital requirements.

 The oil bonds are interest-bearing IOU slips issued by the government which the oil companies can include in their balance sheet. They have been selling these bonds at a discount to meet their liquidity requirements and keep operations going. 

 The finance ministry issues the bonds in tranches to minimise the burden on the exchequer. However, with the control over revenue deficit a priority, the finance ministry tends to delay the issue of these bonds.

 Senior officials of the oil companies say the finance ministry had refused to give statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) status to the oil bonds, leading to the sale of bonds at a discount as otherwise the banks are reluctant to buy them.

 Assam Company plans $40-m overseas float

 Calcutta, Jan. 4: Assam Company Ltd is planning to raise $40 million through an overseas flotation to fund its oil exploration and production (E amp;P) business to cash in on the boom in the international crude market.

 The company is in talks with various market participants to raise the funds.

 The issue is likely to hit the market in the next six months.

 It is still at a preliminary stage. But our idea is to raise this fund for the E amp;P work in Assam-Arakan basin, chief financial officer Abhay Chawdhry said.

 The modalities of the issue, which is likely to comprise foreign currency convertible bonds (FCCB), are being worked out. 

 This offer will be in addition to the companys private placement with three Mauritius-based foreign financial institutions (FIIs).

 Assam Company will raise Rs 188 crore through the issue of warrants by placing Re 1 shares at a premium of Rs 22.25 with the FIIs.

 However, these investors can pay 10 per cent of the total dues now. Therefore, in effect, about Rs 18 crore will flow in 2006.

 With crude oil prices at $60 a barrel, the company is in a hurry to produce oil from its Amguri field where it has a 40 per cent interest. Canoro Resources of Canada is the operator with a 60 per cent interest.

 The company today bought a 33 per cent stake in an Australian prospect for $1 million. It has tied up DMS Exploration of the US for the same.

 The company has also signed a memorandum of agreement with the Texas-based company for jointly exploring opportunities in Nigeria, Kazakhstan, Australia and Indonesia.

 There could be a number of opportunities demanding fast investment decision. The money raised by the overseas issue will come in handy for them, Chawdhry said.

 Moreover, Assam Company intends to fast forward its development plan in Amguri which, according to the company, might produce 250,000 barrels of oil in 2006.

 The field was once abandoned by the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation. With the present crude prices, development of such fields makes commercial sense, an oil and gas industry expert said.

 The investment in Australia is also a calculated risk taken by the company. To begin with, it is investing $4 million to explore 625 sq km apart from putting in $1 million for equity.

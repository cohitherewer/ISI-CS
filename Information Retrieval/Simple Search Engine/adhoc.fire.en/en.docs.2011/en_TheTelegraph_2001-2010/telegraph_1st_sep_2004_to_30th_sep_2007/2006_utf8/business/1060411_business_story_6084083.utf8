 Fidelity sells LSE stake

 Hogging limelight

 London, April 10 (Reuters): Fidelity Investments, at one point the London Stock Exchanges (LSE) biggest shareholder, has sold its stake in the bourse, citing concerns over the stocks high valuation, Financial News reported on Monday.

 The US fund manager ? which once held 10 per cent of the London Stock Exchanges shares ? sold the remaining holding of just under 1 per cent, the publication said in its website edition, citing industry sources.

 Neither Fidelity nor the LSE were immediately available to comment.

 Shares in the LSE have surged almost 150 per cent over the past 12 months while it has been courted by European rivals Deutsche Boerse, Euronext, Australian bank Macquarie and US exchange Nasdaq, although it has rejected offers as being too low.

 Trading at around 1,036 pence, the LSE is valued at around ?2.6 billion.

 Shares in rival exchanges have also risen as the prospect of a full-scale consolidation prompted a re-rating of the sector. 

 Nasdaq withdrew its offer for the London Stock Exchange in March.

 The LSE and Euronext have held secret talks about an all-share merger to create a European super exchange valued at around ?6 billion, the Observer said on Sunday.

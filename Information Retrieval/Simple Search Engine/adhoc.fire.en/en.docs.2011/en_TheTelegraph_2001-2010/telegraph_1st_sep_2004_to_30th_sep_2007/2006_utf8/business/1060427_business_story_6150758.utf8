 Delhi wakes up to realty

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 26: After last years blowout in Mumbais realty prices, its Delhis turn to ignite a storm in the property markets.

 In one of the biggest realty deals in recent times in the capital, a joint venture between DLF Universal Ltd and Indiabulls Financial Services today snapped up a 35.8-acre plot of residential land that the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) put on the block for just over Rs 450 crore.

 The area, offered in a public-private partnership project, is located in South Delhis Okhla Industrial area.

 The land has been acquired by Kenneth Builders and Developers Pvt Ltd, which is a 50:50 venture between Indiabulls Infrastructure and DLF Universal. Sources said out of 1,40,000 sq metres, 80,000 sq metres will be used for built-up residential area (lower cost housing), while 20,000 sq metres will be earmarked for a green facility. 

 You can expect many such deals, four times bigger than this in Delhi and other parts of India, as we are in an expansion mode and are creating a land bank, said a source in DLF.

 As the real estate industry witnesses exponential growth in the coming years, property consultants feel that the process of acquiring huge chunks of land will continue.

 Real estate consultants said as the industry sees more and more joint ventures being signed with international players, the pressure on the industry to acquire more land will increase.

 It certainly is a trend which will stay here as the real estate industry expands over the next 5 to 7 years, said Pankaj Dayal, CEO of NAI Collaborations. 

 It is not the biggest deal in terms of value. But these deals are surprising everybody because they are beating the market expectations in terms of land prices, said Sanjay Verma, joint managing director, Cushman and Wakefield India. 

 There is clearly a sustainable demand for land, but there is a shortage of land with clear titles, he said. There is demand for retail, housing and industrial land, he added. 

 Verma said the property prices would continue to rise till the government, which holds the largest reservoir of vacant land in urban areas, releases more tracts to take care of supply constraints. 

 At the moment these deals will continue to put pressure on the market, and consequently on prices, which is bad for the health of the industry, said Verma.

 According to Dayal, real estate property prices in Delhi could zoom by approximately Rs 1000 per sq feet. Dayal, however, said, While the deal is a little over-priced, it would eventually be good for the industry and the market as this is a huge area in the heart of Delhi, sold by the government.

 Last week, the Reserve Bank of India cautioned against the surge in real estate price and the emergence of an unsustainable asset bubble.

 I dont see it as a bubble in the real estate market, but certainly some of the micro market areas are going to see correction, said Verma. 

 The real estate industry, which contributes about 14 per cent to the GDP, has a huge role to play, said Verma.

 Last year, DLF was involved in 

 one of the largest realty deals in the country when its 

 subsidiary, Jawala Real Estate Developers, stumped up Rs 

 702 crore for NTC-owned Mumbai Textile Mills 17.5 

 acre property.

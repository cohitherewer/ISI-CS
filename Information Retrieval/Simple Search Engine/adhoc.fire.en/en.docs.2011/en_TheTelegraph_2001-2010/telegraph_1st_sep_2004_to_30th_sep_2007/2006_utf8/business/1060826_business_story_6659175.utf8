 Holcim incurs Sebi wrath

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Aug. 25: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has imposed a penalty of Rs 25 crore on the Swiss cement giant Holcim for failing to come out with an open offer after indirectly acquiring shares of Everest Industries. Holcim indirectly bought into Everest Industries through Associated Cement Companies (ACC), which held 76 per cent in Everest.

 Holcim and its holding company Holderind Investments had picked up 67 per cent of Ambuja Cements India (ACIL). The deal received approval from the FIPB on March 30, 2005. 

 Later, Holcim, Holderind Investments, ACIL and Gujarat Ambuja Cements (GACL) together made an open offer to the shareholders of ACC. Upon completion of the offer process on April 26, 2005, the aggregate holding of the acquirers and persons acting in concert, together with their existing holding, increased to 34.71 per cent of ACCs equity. 

 While Everest Industries shares are listed on the BSE and NSE, ACC held 76.01 per cent of the companys equity. Therefore, the acquisition of 34.71 per cent in ACC also led to indirect holding in Everest Industries. 

 Amit Pradhan was appointed as adjudicating officer to inquire into the indirect acquisition of shares of Everest Industries by Holcim without a public announcement to that effect.

 In todays order, Pradhan said: Considering the large amount of money involved (above Rs 50 crore) in the default by Holcim, I think it appropriate to impose a penalty of Rs 25 crore on Holcim. The amount would be commensurate to the nature of violation committed by Holcim.

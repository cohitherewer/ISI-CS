 RBI lists weak banks

 Sorry state

 Calcutta, Oct. 15: With only six months left for banks to adapt to the Basel II norms, a Reserve Bank of India study says that at least five old private sector banks are in poor health. 

 These banks Sangli Bank and Ratnakar Bank in Maharashtra; Dhanalakshmi Bank in Kerala; Lakshmi Vilas Bank in Karnataka; and Mumbai-based Development Credit Bank have a low capital base and high non-performing assets (NPAs). The net-worth of the banks are also well below the mandatory Rs 300 crore. 

 The Development Credit Bank, which has just made a public issue, will have a capital base of more than Rs 300 crore after the issue, while its gross NPA is nearly 15 per cent.

 Ratnakar Bank and Sangli Bank have capital plus reserves of less than Rs 100 crore and capital adequacy of just above 9 per cent. Dhanalakshmi Bank has a capital plus reserves of Rs 120 crore, while the banks capital adequacy ratio stands at 9.75 per cent as on March 31, 2006. The bank has a gross non-performing asset at close to 9 per cent.

 Though the banks are prime targets for takeovers judging from the experience of Nedungadi Bank, Global Trust Bank and more recently the United Western Bank, all weak entities that were acquired by other banks fragmented promoters holding, except for Development Credit Bank, huge employee cost, high incidence of bad debts and small number of branches pose major hurdles for potential buyers.

 The banks are not as weak as the UWB, which would have necessitated immediate RBI intervention, but they need to shore up their capital base immediately to provide for enough capital adequacy ratio (CAR) to take care of the Basel II norms. The risk-adjusted capital adequacy of each of these banks is marginally above the minimum requirement of 9 per cent.

 Besides, some of them also require to reduce promoters stake to below 10 per cent by 2008-09.

 Toyota aims for the top slot

 Nagoya, Japan, Dec. 22 (Reuters): Toyota Motor Corp expects to produce a record 9.42 million vehicles in 2007 a 4 per cent rise that should see it overtake General Motors Corp as the worlds biggest auto maker.

 As the Japanese firm lures buyers worldwide with cars that are safe, affordable and fuel efficient, US rivals GM and Ford Motor battle falling market share, closing factories and shedding thousands of jobs.

 Soaring fuel prices have battered Detroits auto heartland, with customers shunning gas-guzzling pickups in favour of cheaper-to-run models from Japanese and South Korean car makers.

 Toyota, which makes the Camry, Yaris and popular Prius hybrid cars, has overtaken Chrysler Group in the US and is expected to pass Ford next year, market forecaster Edmunds.com says.

 In the first 11 months of this year, Ford had a 16.6 per cent share of the US market, while Toyotas share was 15.3 per cent. Ford has said it expects its US market share to slip to 14-15 per cent next year.

 The Toyota group, which includes mini vehicle maker Daihatsu Motor Co and truck maker Hino Motors Ltd, has forecast 2007 global sales for the group of 9.34 million vehicles next year, up from an estimated 8.80 million units this year.

 GM does not provide sales or production forecasts on an annual basis. Adding GMs January-September global sales to its production plans for the current quarter puts its 2006 volume at 9.168 million vehicles.

 In the year to March, Toyota expects to earn a net profit of 1.55 trillion yen ($13.1 billion) a record for any Japanese company.

 Toyota shares have gained almost 27 per cent this year to a record high, valuing the Japanese firm at close to $230 billion about 14 times GMs market capitalisation.

 One hole Toyota has yet to fill is the development of cheap, tiny cars to compete in emerging markets such as India.

 Watanabe believes this is a top priority to ensure future growth, especially as mature markets in North America, Europe and Japan see sputtering demand.

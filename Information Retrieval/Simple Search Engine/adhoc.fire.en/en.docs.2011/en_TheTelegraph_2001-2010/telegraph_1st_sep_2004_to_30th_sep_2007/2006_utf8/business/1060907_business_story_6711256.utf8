 IMF voices concern about SEZ success

 K.P. NAYAR

 Washington, Sept. 6: The debate in India over special economic zones (SEZs) has spilled over into the global financial arena with leading lights in the International Monetary Fund (IMF) taking sides on the issue.

 In a stinging attack on plans to create new SEZs, the IMFs chief economist, Raghuram Rajan, has predicted that these zones will tempt entrepreneurs with their incentives to shift existing production to the new zones at substantial cost to society.

 In his regular column in the latest issue of the IMFs quarterly journal, Finance and Development, Rajan has accused vested interests of lobbying for tax holidays in the SEZs and sections in the government of supporting these lobbies.

 In his latest column, Rajan picked holes in the governments argument that the SEZs will offer benefits only to new investment.

 He asked: Who is to judge what new investment is? The poorly paid tax inspector? And will firms not also shift all investment that would have taken place outside the zones to the new zones, thus depriving the government of revenues? 

 India must absorb the lessons of its own past: if you create perverse economic incentives and then rely on bureaucrats to stand in the way of businesses exploiting those incentives, the outcome will be little more investment than would otherwise have happened and a lot less revenue, but much richer bureaucrats.

 Rajan had cautious praise for Nehruvian policies, which have been assailed in the past by international monetary institutions. Indias past policies relating to science and education, no matter how distorted, gave it capabilities in skilled manufacturing and in services, where its comparative advantage now lies.

 India should not sacrifice this advantage in a blind attempt to follow the East Asian path of unskilled, labour-intensive manufacturing.

 In a separate official document that effectively counters the arguments being made in favour of SEZs, the IMF has painted a dim picture of Indian efforts so far to attract foreign direct investment (FDI). 

 India attracts relatively little FDI, and as Indian firms invest abroad, the share of net FDI in total private capital inflows has fallen to about 10 per cent.

 In a separate development, three IMF economists, including Rajan, have presented a paper at a monetary conference in the US in which they challenged the notion that capital account opening will help developing countries.

 Aid likely for telecom SEZs

 JAYATI GHOSE

New Delhi, Oct. 29: The government plans to facilitate the setting up of telecom special economic zones (SEZs) and telecom hardware parks, to make the country a manufacturing hub.

 The government plans to assist private players to set up these hardware manufacturing plants by providing financial support of up to Rs 4,060 crore, said a senior DoT official.

 The plan drawn up by DoT proposes support of 5 per cent of the investment made by the developer of the SEZ and units in that zone, up to Rs 50 crore.

 The assistance would be given to entities who invest at least Rs 100 crore and set up the facility over a minimum of 10 hectares, the officials said.

 The draft proposal says the telecom hardware parks will be given sops of zero duty and income tax benefits.

 There are also provisions for fiscal incentives that are on abatement to Indian manufacturers for products designed in India and manufactured in India as well as products not designed in India but manufactured in India.

 Specifically, it has proposed reduction of excise duty on telecom equipment and the intermediates used to make the equipment to 8 per cent from 16 per cent.

 Analysts predict a demand of Rs 1,84,000 crore for telecom equipment by 2010. The combined domestic and export volumes can offer a tremendous potential for telecom manufacturing in India, they said.

 The domestic demand itself would be about Rs 46,000 crore per annum from 2010 onwards, the analysts added.

 Nokia has already become the first company to get the permission to set up an SEZ in Sriperumbudur, Tamil Nadu to manufacture telecom equipment and mobile handsets.

 Backed by financial support and incentives from the government, India is trying to woo European and Chinese players to enter the telecom equipment manufacturing sector. Among those reportedly keen are Huawei.

 DoT has also suggested to state governments to exempt entry tax, local sales tax and other taxes at least till 2015. 

 The proposal says domestic manufacturers be allowed access to external commercial borrowings for capital expenditure and working capital requirement. It says domestic financial institutions should lend money for capital expenditure and working capital requirement of the telecom equipment manufacturers at rates equivalent to those at which telecom service providers or infrastructure providers are entitled to.

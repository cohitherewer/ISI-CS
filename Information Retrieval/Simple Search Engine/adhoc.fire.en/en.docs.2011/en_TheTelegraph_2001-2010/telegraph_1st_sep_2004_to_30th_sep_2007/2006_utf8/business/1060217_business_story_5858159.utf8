 Phone firms await sweet tidings

 The Buzz gets louder

 New Delhi, Feb. 16: A bonanza is in store for private telecom companies as the government is likely to reduce the amount these firms pay to BSNL as access deficit charge. This is a levy the firms pay to support the government?s rural telephony obligation.

 The government will also allow them greater access to spectrum ? airwaves on which voice and data travel. 

 There is a proposal to put in place a mechanism to vacate spectrum used by the government for commercial purposes, President A.P.J Abdul Kalam said in an address to Parliament today.

 Officials said the government planned to release spectrum over a three-year timeframe and this would help telecom operators bring in new services like 3G, which allow instant downloads of live events like television shows, news tickers and stock market quotes. Telecom companies could earn high revenues from these services, they added.

 Private telecom operators, including Reliance and Tata, have long been lobbying for more spectrum bands. Operators accuse defence and police departments of not using the entire spectrum bands allotted to them. The government will soon decide on the amount of spectrum that can be vacated. Actual release of a small chunk of spectrum could kick off as early as June, officials said.

 The finance ministry would like spectrum to be auctioned like the FM radio licences. Officials said Ratan Tata had offered to pay Rs 1,500 crore for a spectrum bandwidth some time back. 

 However, the communications ministry does not favour the auction route. A compromise on this issue is likely to be worked out soon.

 Officials said the government will take steps to reduce the ADC even before vacating the spectrum bands. Private telecom operators, grappling to counter the Re 1 STD rate announced by BSNL-MTNL, have been demanding that the ADC be pared down by making it a percentage of their revenues. 

 Currently, an ADC is levied on telecom operators on all long-distance calls. Operators pay 30 paise per call, besides carriage costs. Private telecom operators have resented this payout and have been lobbying hard to remove it or reduce the charges. 

 Private operators say it is impossible for them to match the Re 1 STD per minute tariff offered by the public sector telecom duo under the existing regime. 

 Their ability to respond to this market challenge would depend on how the government reduces the ADC.

 Q amp;A

 Dividend doubt

 Is the dividend yield the P/E ratio? P/E is easily available in many dailies; but dividend yield, if it is different, hardly available. Some mutual funds are offering dividend yield funds. Are these the same as the Dogs of the BSE? 

 Biswanath Ghosh, Durgapur 

 A dividend yield is different from a price-earning ratio of a companys share. The dividend yield is measured by the ratio of the last dividend paid per share by a company to its current share price. The price-earning ratio of a stock is arrived at by dividing the current share price with earning (net profit) per share of the company. Dividend figures are available in newspapers as and when they announce it. Under their dividend yield schemes, mutual funds pick those stocks which have a relatively high dividend yield. These stocks may or may not be index stocks. They can be small- or mid-cap stocks.

 Tax concern

 Can I pay the life insurance premium of my husbands policies and get tax deduction up to Rs 1 lakh under section 80C while filing my return?

 Maya Kirpalani, Calcutta

 He can claim tax deduction on the premium paid for 

 a spouses life insurance policy(s) provided the 

 spouse is economically dependent on the policy proposer.

 Capital query

 Is a holding period of two years and above necessary to classify an asset as long-term capital asset? Is there any exception regarding the period of holding to determine whether an asset is long-term or short-term? Is the tax rate of 10 per cent on long-term capital gains applicable to all kinds of assets?

 Biman Saha, Calcutta

 If the capital assets comprise equity shares, units of mutual funds and listed securities, holding period must be in excess of 12 months for the asset to be classified as a long-term capital asset. In case of immovable assets such as a house property and investments other than shares and securities, the long-term holding period is more than 36 months. There are two rates for capital gains tax. The rate is 10 per cent for assets covered u/s 115AB, 115AC and 115AD. These are generally shares of listed companies, units of mutual funds and other listed securities. For others, a flat tax rate of 20 per cent is imposed.

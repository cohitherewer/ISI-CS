The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 August date for tea party

 SOHINI MOOKHERJEA

 Calcutta, July 17: The Tea Board will meet Reserve Bank officials and representatives from Nabard and commercial banks in the first week of August to work out the modalities of the special purpose tea fund.

 The Tea Board is lobbying for the minimum possible borrowing cost for garden owners and factories. The board is comfortable with a rate of 9 per cent or lower.

 Commercial banks, however, are divided on whether the rate should be linked to the prime lending rate (PLR) or to government securities because of the long-term nature of the loan and the cost of capital.

 The rates on government securities have been firming up, while bank interest rates are also on the upward swing. In such a situation and going by the tea industrys records on loan repayment over the last six years, the rates should cover the long-term risk and cost. Therefore, a rate between 10.75 and 11.25 per cent, which is closer to the PLR of most banks, would be advisable, a source in a South India-based bank said.

 The line of credit would have to factor in the cost of capital and take into account the long-term nature of the loan. The rate of 9 per cent, which has been recommended after the study conducted by SBI Capital, would entail better servicing of the loan, said Monojit Dasgupta, secretary of the Indian Tea Association.

 The industry feels the loan should be treated on a par with long-term capital-intensive infrastructure loans and cannot be offered at commercial rates.

 Some sections of commercial banks also favour a lower rate of interest. We feel the loan should be linked to bank rates and government securities as the initial line of credit is being extended to the Tea Board, which minimises the chances of default. The rate should be much lower than the PLR to provide the much needed boost to the industry, said A.K. Bandyopadhyay, deputy general manager, Uco Bank.

 Some other sections of the commercial banking sector feel tea production is not an economically viable activity without subsidy. The situation in Bengal is worse, where provident fund defaults and delay in garden land lease renewals are rampant.

 The SPTF would have funds worth Rs 4,100 crore to be disbursed over the next 14 years for the rejuvenation and replantation of tea bushes.

 The Tea Board had approached Nabard to guide the SPTF in terms of the unit cost (the cost per acre required to plant any given crop). 

 We have come up with a guideline 

 cost instead of the unit cost. The guideline cost is more 

 flexible and the ultimate liability lies with the Tea Board, 

 said Gautam Taute, chief general manager of Nabard.

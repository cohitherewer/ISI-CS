 Comfort from mega policy

 GARIMA SINGH

 New Delhi, Oct. 25: Insurance companies that have provided a composite cover to Reliances assets in Jamnagar, Patalganga and Hazira are busy assessing claims of losses arising out of the fire that broke out at the Jamnagar refinery today.

 Sources confirmed the sum assured of the mega policy taken by Reliance Indias biggest private sector conglomerate is approximately Rs 40,000 crore. The sum assured for the 33-million-tonne Jamnagar unit alone is expected to be in the region of Rs 20,000 crore, said sources.

 The mega risk policy essentially covers loss of property and profits arising due to fire. Under the terms of the policy, claims can also be pressed on account of machinery breakdown.

 Reliance pays an annual premium of Rs 100 crore plus, which is divided amongst all the state-owned insurance companies as well as private insurers, said a senior PSU insurance company official.

 New India Assurance is the lead insurance provider covering 55 per cent of the total assets, while Oriental Insurance covers 15 per cent. The remaining risks under the insurance policy are shared between the other two PSU general insurers National Insurance and United Insurance and private insurance companies ICICI Lombard and Bajaj Allianz.

 Meanwhile, a New India Assurance official said, The surveyors have been asked to make an assessment of the losses. It will take us a couple of days before we reach a final figure.

 It is learnt that Reliance renewed its policy with insurers earlier this month, seeking cover for increased number of assets. However, the figures were not confirmed by company officials. Determined and benchmarked by reinsurance pricing in the London market, as much as 95 per cent of the risks covered by the domestic insurance companies are reinsured with top overseas insurers. The Jamnagar unit was damaged by a devastating earthquake in 2001. The company had then claimed an insurance of $22 million.

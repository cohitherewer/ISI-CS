 Calcutta, May 26: The government of Singapore is talking to various state governments to set up a multi-product special economic zone (SEZ) at an investment of $1 billion.

 The city state has informed the commerce ministry about its plans and the project might take few more months to shape up.

 The Singapore government is in talks with the governments of Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat for this project. Ascendas is representing Singapore. Ideally the Singapore government would prefer a location on the eastern coast, which would facilitate transportation, said G.K. Pillai, special secretary in the ministry of commerce and industry.

 Each project would initially require 2,500 acres. Once the location is finalised, it would possibly take the 51:49 joint venture route. The presence of Japanese companies in the state could be a plus point for Bengal, Pillai added.

 Another 52 new proposals for the SEZ will be considered at the next meeting of the approval committee scheduled for June 12.

 Of these, 14 are for the multi-product SEZ requiring 1000 hectares or more land, 18 for sector specific ones with 100 hectares or above land and the rest are in the 25 and 10-hectare category, including IT and ITeS projects.

 The projects will entail an investment of Rs 100,000 crore in the next three years.

 The Bengal government has submitted a proposal for setting up a multi-commodity special economic zone spanning 15,000 acres with a projected investment of Rs 4,000 crore to develop social infrastructure, Pillai said.

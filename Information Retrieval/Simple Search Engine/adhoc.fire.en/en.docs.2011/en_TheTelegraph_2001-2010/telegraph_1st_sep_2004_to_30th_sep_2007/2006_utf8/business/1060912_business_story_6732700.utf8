 ONGC bags more Cuban blocks

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Sept. 11: ONGC-Videsh (OVL) has clinched a deal for two more offshore exploration blocks in Cuba stretching across 4,300 square km in the island nations exclusive economic zone. 

 OVL managing director R.S. Butola signed the production sharing contract in Havana with CUPET, the Cuban state oil company, to finalise the deal on Saturday. 

 Butola said, The blocks, N-34 and N-35, are located in a favourable geological set-up and are estimated to hold considerable hydrocarbon resources.

 The Cuban government has the option to take 20 per cent participating interest in these blocks. 

 OVL, as the operator of the block, will carry out the exploration with its own management. 

 The exploration period will be spread over six years in three phases. 

 During the first phase of exploration, seismic data would be acquired and processed to pinpoint the oil or gas bearing structures. 

 ONGC chairman R.S. Sharma said, Cuba offers a promising exploration play and OVL is pleased to enhance its investments in the country.

 In May this year, OVL had acquired a 30 per cent participating interest in six deep-sea exploration blocks in Cuba from Spanish company Repsol YPF, which holds a 40 per cent participating interest with the remaining 30 per cent being held by Norsk Hydro, a Norwegian company that specialises in deep-sea oil exploration.

 The blocks are spread over an area of nearly 12000 sq km in Cubas exclusive economic zone. 

 The hydrocarbon resource potential in the blocks is estimated to be in excess of 4 billion barrels. One exploratory well drilled in one of these blocks has indicated the presence of hydrocarbons.

 These blocks are in the third phase of exploration period. The work programme during this period includes acquisition of 3000 sq km 3-D seismic data. Drilling wells in selected prospects will be decided in the next exploration phase.

 The opportunity is also expected to give OVL valuable insight into deep-sea oil exploration technology, an area where ONGC has just entered.

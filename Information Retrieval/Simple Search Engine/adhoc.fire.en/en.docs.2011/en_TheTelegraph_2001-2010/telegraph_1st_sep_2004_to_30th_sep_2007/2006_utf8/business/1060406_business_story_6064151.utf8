 Chidambaram: Way out?

 New Delhi, April 5: With the lean season credit policy less than a fortnight away, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Y.V. Reddy met finance minister P. Chidambaram here today and discussed strategies to enhance the liquidity in the banking system.

 The liquidity crunch is raising concerns about the economys capacity to sustain the recent high-growth rates. Banks are demanding a cut in the cash reserve ratio (CRR) to infuse liquidity. A percentage point cut in CRR will inject cash to the extent of Rs 20,000 crore into the banking system.

 RBI is also exploring the possibility of releasing the excess funds maintained under the statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) over and above the mandatory 25 per cent. Banks are maintaining an SLR of 31 per cent, and the extra 6 per cent can release funds to the tune of Rs 60,000 crore, according to a senior banker.

 Another option for the RBI is to tap the market stabilisation scheme (MSS), which has a corpus of Rs 30,000 crore.

 The RBI has allowed banks to increase rates on NRI deposits by 0.25 per cent to make them more attractive. 

 Reddy is now faced with the task of performing a delicate balancing act of improving liquidity in the system, while keeping the interest rates stable for borrowers.

 Chidambaram has said that interest rates will remain attractive for all borrowers. In addition to the cash squeeze, demand for higher interest rates on deposits is another reason behind the upward pressure on lending rates.

 The credit-deposit mismatch is worrying policymakers. Bank credit contributes about 30 per cent of the GDP. Assuming that the economy grows at an average rate of 7 per cent, the additional credit requirement will be Rs 1,00,000 crore.

 The liquidity position appears to have improved with the RBI resorting to the reverse repo window. The RBI absorbs liquidity through the reverse repo (repurchase) auctions at 5.50 per cent and injects liquidity through the repo window at 6.50 per cent. 

 The RBIs purchase of foreign exchange inflows for nearly two months has also led to injection of liquidity into the system.

 Play the planner

 Tax calculations could send anyone into a tizzy. Not any more, says Chandralekha Tulal 

 It is that time of the year again, when you scuttle in and out of your tax planner?s office to save most of your hard-earned salary.

 And as last year?s budget made tax saving easier by cutting down the complex provisions of various rebates and deductions, one might even be tempted to play the tax planner oneself.

 To make it easier, we have put together the applicable deductions one can still enjoy to reduce one?s tax burden. 

 But before that, let us understand what a deduction means, how it works and how it is different from the earlier rebates.

 Deductions are straight away deducted from the total income, which means the taxable income stands reduced by the applicable amount. 

 On the other hand, a rebate is a discount, which is calculated as a percentage of the taxable income (arrived at after making all applicable deductions) and deducted from the tax liability, again calculated on the taxable income. 

 The latest section inserted under the deductions is 80C, which was brought about after the old rebate section 88 was scrapped in the budget. Under section 80C, an individual is allowed to claim deductions for the amount paid or deposited subject to a maximum limit of Rs 1 lakh.

 Most popularly, the amounts deposited include a premium on life insurance policies for self, spouse or child up to 20 per cent of the sum assured, contribution to a provident fund, unit-linked insurance plans, equity-linked savings schemes, annuity plans and specified tax saving bonds. 

 For proud house owners, repayment of their housing loans makes them eligible for a double tax relief ? one in the form of principal repayment under this section and another in the form of interest repayment up to Rs 1.5 lakh under income from house property. 

 The tuition fees paid for two children is also eligible for tax deduction under the section. However, any development fees or donation or payment of a similar nature shall not be eligible. 

 Section 80C also includes a sub-section, 80CCC, for an investment of up to Rs 10,000 in a pension policy of any insurer. 

 Further deductions that can be claimed include payment made towards a medical insurance premium for self, spouse, children and dependent parents up to a maximum of Rs 10,000. In case the person insured is a senior citizen, the maximum deduction allowed is Rs 15,000. 

 Another useful section allows an individual to claim deduction for specified medical treatments for up to Rs 40,000. In case the amount paid is for an individual, or a dependent person, who is a senior citizen, the deduction allowable is Rs 60,000. However, the deduction allowed shall be reduced by the amount of insurance cover for the treatment. 

 Repayment of interest on an education loan is also eligible for deduction for individuals who had taken such loans.

 Any assessee not entitled to a house rent allowance can claim deduction for rent paid subject to the condition that the individual, spouse or children do not own any property at the place of one?s profession or the assessee does not own any self-occupied residential accomodation at any other place. The deduction allowed is the least of the following ? rent paid minus 10 per cent of total income, 25 per cent of total income or Rs 2,000.

 Donations made to specified funds (either up to 100 per cent or 50 per cent of the amount, as applicable) is also allowed as deduction.

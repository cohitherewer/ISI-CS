 Aerospace gains altitude

 ANGELA JAMESON 

 London, July 10: BAE Systems, part-owner of Airbus, may want to quit the aircraft-making business, but the British aerospace industry is going from strength to strength. 

 A survey that looked at sales, investment and jobs across the defence and civil aviation sectors has concluded that 2005 was a bumper year for British industry, reflected in the strong results of its seven biggest aerospace companies, including BAE, Rolls-Royce and Smiths Group.

 According to the Society of British Aerospace Companies (SBAC), the number of jobs in the UKs aerospace industry in 2005 rose by 9 per cent to 124,237. Almost 10,000 jobs have been created in last year alone, according to the SBACs annual survey, after a 25 per cent increase in sales and orders for new aircraft hitting record levels.

 Chris Geoghegan, president of the society and chief operating officer of BAE Systems, said, The aerospace industry has had a phenomenal year with substantial increases in turnover, employment, R amp;D investment and record levels of new orders. The sector has demonstrated a remarkable resilience and has world-leading companies across a range of products and technologies. 

 The survey also reveals that productivity in the industry increased by 15 per cent last year, ahead of the annual 5 per cent long-term trend.

 Aerospace defence sales rose 30 per cent to ?12.2 billion, civil aerospace sales rose 18 per cent to ?10.5 billion and sales in the space sector increased ?603 million.

 Not only has direct employment in the sector risen, but the number of jobs supported by the sector has also increased to 276,000. Figures revealing the extent of jobs created by the aviation industry will be noted as the government holds talks with EADS, the 80 per cent owner of Airbus, over the future of 13,000 jobs at its British factories. 

 The Government is being asked to support continued production of aircraft wings in the UK for the new A350 model, as pressure mounts from other countries such as Spain for the work. 

 The SBAC survey shows that aerospace made a positive net contribution of ?2.25 billion to the balance of trade, while overseas British aerospace companies employ 43,000 people and generate ?6.4 billion of turnover outside the UK. 

 Sally Howes, SBAC director-general, said, An increase in employment, record order books and salaries 31.6 per cent above the manufacturing average are some of the reasons why the aerospace industry is so incredibly important for the UK economy.

 Sales to the Government last year increased by 21 per cent to ?4.1 billion.

 Stop that CHURN

 Srikumar Bondyopadhyay provides an alternative to frequent portfolio shuffling

 The share indices are currently at their lifetime highs. After a sharp fall from its earlier peak at 12600 points in May this year, the BSE sensex surged past 13700 last week. But did small investors ride this bull run and rake in the moolah?

 Most pundits reckon they didnt. The equity-oriented mutual funds where most small investors tend to park their cash arent reporting knockout returns, probably because they were slow to reshuffle their portfolios and ride the wave. The more adventurous small investor would have probably chickened out when the sensex stormed to new highs, preferring to book small profits. 

 Most small investors are driven by what John Maynard Keynes calls the animal spirit a tendency among investors to buy and sell shares and eke out small profits from daily or short-term fluctuations in stock prices.

 Rising costs

 Investors are so busy trying to make profits that they dont pay attention to the pitfalls of quick churn in their investment portfolios which comes at a cost in the form of brokerage fee, stamp duty, security transaction tax, service tax and short-term capital gains tax.

 These costs taken together may, at times, be greater than the capital gain from each transaction.

 Besides, the stock pickings are often not guided by any definite knowledge about the fundamentals of the company that would bolster the hunch that a stock should move up. The result is that ones portfolio of stocks gets stretched to unprofitable limits.

 Keynesian theory

 Diversification is an insurance against ignorance, Keynes said in his magnum opus, The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money (1936). He argued that it would be a mistake to think that one limits ones risks by spreading too much between enterprises about which one knew little and has no reason for special confidence. Ones knowledge and experience are definitely limited and there are seldom more than two or three enterprises at any given time in which I personally feel myself to put full confidence, he said.

 Students of economics would know the famed economist. But not many would be aware how successful an investor Keynes really was. After burning his fingers during the market crash in 1929-30, Keynes showed his stock market prowess while managing the Chest Fund at Kings College in Cambridge, UK, for 19 years between 1927 and 1946.

 This period covered some of the most tumultuous episodes in the 20th century: the stock market crash in 1929, World War II and the Great Depression of 1933-35. The UK stock markets yielded a negative annual return of 0.5 per cent; yet Keynes managed to generate a compounded annual return of 13 per cent for the colleges fund.

 Three golden rules

 Keynes investment principles were:

 a) A careful selection of a few stocks having regard to their cheapness in relation to their actual and potential value over a period of years ahead and in relation to alternative investments at the time;

 b) A steadfast holding of these fairly large units through thick and thin, until either they have fulfiled their promise or it is evident that they were purchases on a mistake, and; 

 c) A balanced investment position a variety of risks in spite of large individual holdings.

 All successful stock market investors in the world, like JM Keynes and Warren Buffett, have always advocated for long-term investments and closed their eyes to short-term trading. 

 Stock picking

 Stock picking is probably the easiest task in the overall game of equity investment. The simple advice is: pick those few stocks that you know the best.

 Small investors, who cannot devote much time in reading the balance sheets of companies and analyse the fundamentals, can go with frontline enterprises that are highly liquid in stock markets and have a well-established market share in their respective areas of business. 

 Profit booking

 Stock picking is an easier task because the long-term trend in general share prices in all countries over a sufficiently long time horizon, say, 10 years or more, is upwards. The crucial trick for successful stock investment is profit booking. One must know when to sell and which one to sell portfolio churning, to put it simply.

 Since there is a cost involved every time one buys or sells a stock, one must give enough time to ones portfolio to grow sufficiently in value so that there is a profit to justify any churn. 

 With this in mind, one can look at ones portfolio stocks once every year to see if any of them needs to be tossed out. Now, at any given point of time, it is either a buy or a sell with reference to its current market price for every stock. Buy or hold on to the stock if you think its intrinsic value is greater than the current market price, otherwise sell it. However, it is not always easy for a lay investor to determine the intrinsic value of a stock. 

 An easier way for them is to reconcile the annual rate of return on portfolio stocks against a benchmark index. If the average portfolio return is less than the index return during a bull phase, it is time to sell those stocks that have performed below average.

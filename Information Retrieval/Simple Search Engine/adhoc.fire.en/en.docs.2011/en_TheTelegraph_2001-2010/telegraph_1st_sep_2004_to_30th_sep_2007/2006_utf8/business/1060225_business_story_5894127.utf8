 Wagon makers firmly on track

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Packed house

 New Delhi, Feb. 24: Wagon makers can rejoice. This years rail budget has made a provision for 25 per cent rise in wagon manufacturing.

 In order to meet the rising demand of traffic, an increase of 25 per cent will be made in wagon manufacturing, Lalu Prasad said today while presenting this years rail budget in Parliament. 

 Considering the pace of growth in freight traffic, expansion of wagon-making capacity has become essential, he said.

 Welcoming the announcement, Titagarh Industries chairman J.P. Chowdhury said, The hike in wagon procurement will boost the private sector in the industry.

 According to the industry estimate, the wagon industry is pegged at Rs 2,000 crore.

 However, Texmaco president and CEO Ramesh Maheswari did not sound that bullish.

 We welcome the announcement, but the proposed increase in procurement of wagons by 25 per cent will be wholly inadequate if we consider the actual ordering level and offtake by the railways in the last two years. In my opinion the hike should be at least 100 per cent of the present level, Maheswari said.

 The average order by the government in the last five years has been 6086 vehicle units and actual procurement is 5553 vehicle units, he said.

 The railway minister also announced plans for special industry-specific and modern wagons to modernise and improve the freight business. The Rs 22,000-crore freight corridor will also boost the sector.

 Prasad said while railways modernised its locomotives and coaches in 1990s, wagons deployed, at present, still use the technology of the 1980s and announced that all possible efforts would be made to start manufacturing aluminium and stainless (steel) wagons.

 Welcoming the railway budget, Jessop chairman P. K. Ruia said, the budget is expected to create substantial demand for rolling stock as the railway minister has increased the wagon manufacturing capacity by 25 per cent. We have already been contacted by the railways and have committed a supply of 300 wagons a month. I expect a larger order for coaches too.

 HFCL first to win Qualcomm mandate

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 25: US- based Qualcomm, the developer of CDMA technology, has granted the first licence in India to Himachal Futuristic Communications Limited (HFCL) to develop, manufacture and sell CDMA mobile handsets and other devices. 

 Under the terms of agreement, HFCL will pay royalties to make and sell Qualcomms third-generation wireless CDMA2000 subscriber units and modem cards. 

 We shall start full-scale manufacturing from April 2007. We expect to produce four million devices in the first year of which about 3 million will be mobile phones and the rest fixed wireless phones and CDMA modules, such as PC cards for computers, said chairman Mahendra Nahata. 

 HFCL plans to invest about Rs 25-30 crore in the first year, Nahata said. It would be our endeavour to supply handsets both to domestic players as well as export in the overseas markets. 

 The deal is the first with an Indian company and provides a shot in the arm for Qualcomm, which was recently criticised by Indian operators for charging too much for its royalty rates and pushing up mobile phone prices in India, a cost-sensitive market. 

 With this deal, HFCL gets into the league of big telecom players like LG and Samsung. The agreement will now allow HFCL to participate in the rapidly growing 3G CDMA market and enable it to join other manufacturers in providing Indian operators with affordable, yet feature-rich and innovative wireless products, said Marvin Blecker, president, Qualcomm Technology Licensing. 

Several mobile phone makers, including Motorola and 

Nokia, have set up manufacturing facilities in India to tap the countrys booming 

phone market.

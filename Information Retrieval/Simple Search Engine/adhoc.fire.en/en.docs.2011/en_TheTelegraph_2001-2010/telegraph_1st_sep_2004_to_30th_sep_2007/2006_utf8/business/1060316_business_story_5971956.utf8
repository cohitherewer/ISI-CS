 GAIL defends pricing policy

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 15: The GAIL management has argued that its pricing strategy creates a level-playing field to compete with private players who charge a marketing margin on the sale of natural gas. This defence comes in the wake of the petroleum ministry asking the gas behemoth to stop charging a marketing margin on the sale of natural gas to private firms such as Reliance-owned IPCL.

 With the petroleum ministry passing an order in favour of IPCL, GAIL will take a hit of Rs 40 crore.

 GAIL will have to return the money that companies other than IPCL had readily paid to it as the marketing margin on the gas already supplied to them. 

 Senior GAIL officials said, We believe that private companies are charging a margin of around 10 to 12 cents per million British thermal units to cover their marketing costs. There should be a level-playing field for GAIL to be competitive in this market. The private companies marketing gas in the country include the Panna-Mukta-Tapti joint venture, in which Reliance Industries and BG own a share, and Gujarat Gas. Sate-owned gas companies like Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation are also charging a marketing margin on the gas supplied.

 GAIL has also pointed out that the tariff commission has already addressed the issue of marketing margin on the sale of regassified liquefied natural gas in India and is currently examining the issue of domestic gas price. We hope that the tariff commission would also address the issue of marketing margin on the sale of domestic gas as was done in the case of regassified liquefied natural gas, company officials said.

 GAIL said it had been levying marketing margin only on those customers who are paying the market-related price in terms of the gas-pricing order of June 20, 2005 and not on those who are buying gas at the administered price mechanism rate. GAILs increased profits from the sale of the sweet crude from its newly discovered Cambay basin oilfield are expected to be more than wiped out due to the Rs 40-crore hit. 

 GAIL has started selling crude commercially from September 2005. The current sales level of 350 barrels per day from the Cambay fields is expected to go up to 600 barrels per day in the coming fiscal.

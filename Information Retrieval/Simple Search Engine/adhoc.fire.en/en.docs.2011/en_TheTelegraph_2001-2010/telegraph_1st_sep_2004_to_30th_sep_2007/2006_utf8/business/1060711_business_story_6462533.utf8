 Kraft buys part of United Biscuits

 London, July 10 (Reuters): US-based Kraft Foods Inc, the worlds second-largest food company, has paid around ?575 million ($1.1 billion) to acquire a part of Britains United Biscuits (UB), Financial Times reported on Monday.

 The newspaper, quoting people close to the situation, said Kraft had signed the deal over the weekend for United Biscuits southern European arm.

 Private equity groups Cinven and MidOcean Partners each have a 30 per cent stake in UB, while PAI Partners has 15 per cent. Kraft owns the other 25 per cent.

 Kraft Foods and UK-based UB could not be reached for immediate comment.

 Kraft, maker of Ritz crackers and Toblerone chocolate, may announce the deal as early as Monday, the report said, adding that the acquisition will include UBs Spanish operations, where the UK group already owns seven of the top 10 selling biscuit brands.

 UB, which is Britains biggest biscuit maker and the second largest in Europe after Frances Danone, also commands a near 40 per cent share of the Portuguese market.

 UBs southern European business already makes Krafts Oreo cookies under license.

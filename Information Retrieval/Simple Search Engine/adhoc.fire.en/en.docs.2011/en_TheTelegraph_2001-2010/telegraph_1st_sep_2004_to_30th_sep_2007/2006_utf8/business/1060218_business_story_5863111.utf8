 RCVL to list on Tuesday

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Feb. 17: Reliance Capital Ventures Ltd (RCVL) ?the holding company for the Anil Ambani groups interests in financial services business ?will list on the bourses next Tuesday. RCVL will be the first of the four companies carved out of Reliance Industries to list on the bourses.

 But the big surprise is that RCVL, which has no income and expenditure as on date, is actually a loss-making company. A pre-listing financial statement issued today says the company is weighed down by an after-tax loss of Rs 2.54 lakh. The company has a pre-listing share capital of Rs 5 lakh which will swell to Rs 1223.13 crore once shares are allotted to all Reliance Industries shareholders on a 1:1 basis.

 RCVL has investments worth Rs 511.80 crore and an overall net worth of Rs 1223.15 crore. Post-listing, the promoters holding will be 40.54 per cent of the 122.31 crore shares to be allotted. The promoters of the company are Anil Ambani, his wife Tina, mother Kokilaben, two sons Jai Anmol and Jai Anshul, and three group companies ? AAA Global Business Enterprises Pvt Ltd, Anadha Enterprises Pvt Ltd and Bhavan Mercantile Private Ltd. 

 In the promoter category, Anadha Enterprises will end up with the largest stake amounting to 22.1 per cent (or 27.02 crore shares). Anadha is fully owned by the promoters and has Anil and Tina Ambani on the board of directors. Bhavan Mercantile comes next and holds 3.38 per cent of the stock. It is also fully owned by the promoters and has Anil and mother Kokilaben on its board.

 Anil holds 18.59 lakh shares (or 0.15 per cent) in RCVL, while Kokilaben has 36.65 lakh shares (or 0.30 per ent). Tina Ambani holds 16.5 lakh shares, while older son Jai Anmol has 16.69 lakh shares. Ten-year-old Jai Anshul holds just 100 shares in RCVL.

 Meanwhile, in its revised information memorandum, ADAG said the agreements on trademark management and non-competition contain significant deviations from the agreed position... the reconstituted board has decided to take steps to amend the agreements so as to bring them in line with the agreed position.

 New Delhi, April 11: Petroleum minister Murli Deora today said he expected investments of more than $7 billion over the next two years in oil and gas exploration under Nelp 6. 

 Back from the roadshows in London, US, Canada and Australia to market the 55 blocks on offer under the new exploration licensing policy (Nelp 6), Deora said, We hope that all 55 blocks will be snapped up. We expect over $7 billion investment within 24 months. 

 The minister said he expected an output of 20 million standard cubic metres of gas from the coal bed methane blocks to start flowing from next year. This is equivalent to 3.5 million tonnes of oil per year. 

 Deora said the investments under Nelp 6 would be much higher than under Nelp 5, which garnered $2 billion, as more blocks and a higher acreage will be available to the bidders.

 Since some of the blocks were located at great depths in the sea, investments would be substantially higher, Deora added. 

 Petroleum secretary M.S. Srinivasan said, Reserves of 650 million tonnes (mt) of oil and oil equivalent gas have been found in the last five years. The blocks offered under Nelp 1 will commence production from 2007.

 Deora said the roadshows were a success. We have already sold data worth Rs 40 crore to oil companies worldwide. We will collect about Rs 100 crore by selling data only. he added. He said bidder interest could be ascertained from the sale of data. The last date for submission of bids for the coal bed methane round 3 is June 30, while for Nelp 6 it is September 15.

 Nelp 6 is the biggest round for oil and gas exploration: Twenty four blocks are in the deep sea, mostly in the eastern coast, six are in shallow offshore and 25 onland.

 While two of the blocks are situated in the deep sea off the Bengal coast, 18 blocks are situated in the Krishna-Godavri and Mahanadi basin. 

 off the Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu coast. One block is in the sea around the Andaman and Nicobar islands. Five of the onland blocks are situated in Assam and two in Mizoram. 

 Of the 10 coal bed methane blocks one each is located in Bengal and Jharkhand. 

 The government is banking on the major gas discoveries by Reliance, ONGC and Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation off the east coast to attract global companies to join the oil and gas hunt.

 Though giants such as Exxon-Mobil, British Petroleum, Conoco Phillips and Petrobras have attended the roadshows, they are yet to confirm their participation in Nelp 6.

 Among Indian companies, ONGC and to a lesser extent OIL have been mainly involved in exploration under Nelp. To broaden participation, the government has allowed downstream companies such as Indian Oil, Hindustan Petroleum, Bharat Petroleum and GAIL to partner the upstream companies. Among private sector companies Reliance, after tasting success in the KG basin, has also stepped up its presence in oil and gas exploration.

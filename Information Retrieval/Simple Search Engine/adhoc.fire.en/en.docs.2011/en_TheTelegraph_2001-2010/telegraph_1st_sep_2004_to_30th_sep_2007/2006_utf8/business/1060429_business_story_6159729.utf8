 Growth momentum in FMCG markets has been sustained, and we continue to grow ahead of the market, said Harish Manwani, chairman, HLL.

 We remain on course in terms of strengthening our brand portfolio and improving our competitiveness in the market place. We will continue to judiciously use the levers of pricing, cost management and brand investment to sustain profitable growth, added Manwani. 

 The strong numbers posted by HLL saw the scrip gaining 1.18 per cent in a market rocked by the Sebi order on demat scam. 

 The stock ended the day at Rs 290.65 against yesterdays close of Rs 287.25 after touching an intraday high of Rs 294 amidst a volume of 30.05 lakh shares.

 Stable outlook for ONGC

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 27: Crisil and Icra have evaluated ONGCs credit rating as AAA and LAAA respectively. Both the rating agencies have forecast a stable outlook for the company.

 The ratings, released by Crisil and Icra today, are the highest applicable to domestic credit ratings for Indian companies.

 The credit rating exercise was initiated by ONGC to facilitate borrowing in the domestic market to fund its growth plans.

 ONGC has stepped up its domestic investment through joint ventures and special purpose vehicles, and is planning to invest further. These ratings should help in ensuring on-time availability of the required funds in case such a need arises.

 The rating exercise involved rigorous due diligence by Crisil and Icra, covering existing operations as well as future business plans of ONGC and its subsidiaries, OVL and MRPL.

 Earlier, Moodys carried out international credit rating for ONGC and released the report on February 1.

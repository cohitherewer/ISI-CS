 FM sees correction in slide

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 16: Finance minister P. Chidambaram today termed a nearly 1000-point slide in the domestic stock market over the last few days a market correction, in line with a global downward trend in commodity prices and a US decision to raise treasury bond rates. 

 I will put it as a correction provoked by reasons which are quite understandable. All metal prices are down and there is some impact of cement prices ... along with the increase in the US Fed rate. All markets are doing the same, he told reporters here. 

 The sensex rallied after falling more than 3 per cent in early trade with metal companies leading the pack of firms whose prices crashed. The index eventually closed up 0.97 per cent at 11936.54. 

 The worldwide fall in metal prices was triggered off yesterday after metal traders started lowering prices, fearing the market had got over-heated. This saw prices of metal-based industry firms crashing world-wide. 

 The Federal Reserve last week raised its benchmark federal fund rate by a quarter per cent to 5 per cent and indicated it might repeat this hike next month. The Fed rate hike proved to be a trigger for foreign funds to pull out money from developing markets like India for redeployment in the now lucrative Fed bonds. 

 Between Thursday and Friday, FIIs took out some Rs 1,200 crore, according to provisional data compiled by Sebi. On Monday. foreign funds took out Rs 800 crore, NSE figures showed.

The Sensex recovered after the initial fall in the 

morning, after state run domestic financial institutions started bargain hunting 

in blue chip shares whose prices had hit lows. Finance ministry officials however, 

denied that they had issued any instructions to domestic institutions to buy shares 

or prop up the market.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Sensex slide on

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, April 13: Amid intense volatility which reflected the jittery mood of the investing community, equities came under selling pressure for the second consecutive trading session on Thursday as FIIs continued to book profits. After a huge intra-day swing of 372 points, the 30-share sensex ended with a sharp drop of 119 points to close at 11237.23.

 Investors are jittery about Infosyss quarterly results, which will be announced tomorrow. They are apprehensive that if Infosys comes up with numbers that are below expectations or announces a modest guidance, equity indices will go for another tailspin. 

 What is worrying the markets now 

 is that FIIs are already taking a negative view. On Wednesday, 

 when the benchmark index tanked a huge 307 points, FIIs 

 sold close to Rs 735 crore. This comes after a net outflow 

 of Rs 422 crore and Rs 427 crore on the previous two trading 

 sessions.

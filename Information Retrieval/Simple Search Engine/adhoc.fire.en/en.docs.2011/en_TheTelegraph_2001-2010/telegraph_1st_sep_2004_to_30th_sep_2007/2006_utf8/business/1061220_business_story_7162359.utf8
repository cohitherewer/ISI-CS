 Thai U-turn too late to rescue sensex

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Mumbai, Dec. 19: Equity markets across Asia, including India, were struck by a Thai thunder on Tuesday and the benchmark BSE index ended sharply lower by 350 points after it had crashed by over 511 points in intra-day trades.

 Though the Thai government performed an abrupt U-turn late in the evening, it was too late for the stock markets to take note of it.

 Late on Monday, authorities in Thailand imposed drastic currency control measures on international investors to rein in the baht. This resulted in fears that foreign investors may exit the Asian region and nervous brokers pressed the sell button.

 However, today Thailand finance minister Pridiyathorn Devakula said the controls would only be on foreign investments in bonds and commercial paper and stocks will be kept outside its purview.

 Though the story in India was not as bad as that in Thailand where the SET Composite Index plummeted by more than 15 per cent, analysts were left wondering as to what would be the short-term course of equities in an over-valued market. The Thai U-turn has, however, raised the hopes of brokers that the markets may open a lot firmer tomorrow.

 While the 350-point crash came after a decent four-session bull run, brokers said it all began with the news of Thai authorities imposing tough currency controls. 

 It led to fears that FIIs may avoid the Asian markets. Though the situation there (Thailand) and here are not related at all, operators who were largely looking for an excuse sold shares aggressively, a broker said.

 The fall was largely seen in heavyweights like Reliance Industries, while small-cap and mid-cap stocks were a tad lucky. The fall in the sensex could be gauged by the sharp decline in 29 out of the 30 index-based scrips. Only Hero Honda survived the selling onslaught.

 After opening mildly higher at 13737.36 and rising to a high of 13748.62 earlier in the day, the benchmark index came under intense selling pressure and plummeted to an intra-day low of 13237.39. However, with domestic institutions stepping in towards the latter part of trading, it managed to erase part of the losses and end at 13382.01, a loss of 349.08 points or 2.54 per cent over its last close. 

 Among the various sectors, it was the capital goods that took the maximum hit, followed by information technology stocks. All the sectoral BSE indices ended in the negative zone.

 Though the entry of domestic institutions averted a drastic fall, foreign institutional investors (FIIs) were largely absent today.

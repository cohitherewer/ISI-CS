 Sanofi mum on Imclone bid

 Paris, Oct. 10 (Reuters): Sanofi-Aventis SA had no comment on Tuesday on a newspaper report it was the mystery bidder last month for US biotech firm ImClone Systems Inc.

 ImClone, best known for its Erbitux cancer drug, said on October 4 it had received a takeover proposal from an unnamed big drugmaker, but billionaire investor Carl Icahn had sabotaged the deal. The New York Times identified Sanofi as the suitor, citing people involved in the transaction.

 We decline to comment on market rumours or speculation, said a spokesman for the French group, which is the worlds third largest pharmaceuticals concern.

 Sanofi is no stranger to ImClone. The US company licensed rights to a patent on Erbitux from the French drugmaker and Sanofi earns a small royalty on sales of the drug.

 The Paris-based company also has close links to Bristol-Myers Squibb Co, which markets Erbitux with ImClone and is ImClones largest shareholder with a 17 per cent stake.

 Sanofis interest in ImClone suggests it is considering expansion in the United States and might indicate that it would look at other targets, the New York Times added.

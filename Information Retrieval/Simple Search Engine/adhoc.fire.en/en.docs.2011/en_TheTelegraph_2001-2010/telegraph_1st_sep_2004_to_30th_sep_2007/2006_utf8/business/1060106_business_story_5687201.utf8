 Tug-of-war over NMDC 

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 New Delhi, Jan. 5: The steel and finance ministries have differences on stake sale in National Mineral Development Corporation Ltd. The former wants a buyers stake capped at 1 per cent of the equity.

 Although the ministry is willing to agree to the stake sale, it is keen on a mega-merger of all iron ore mining PSUs before committing itself to the equity divestment. 

 The finance ministry, on the other hand, is pushing for the sale of a 15 per cent stake in the corporation. But the actual stake sale through public offering would depend on further talks between the Congress-led government and its Left allies.

 The Centre holds a 98.3 per cent stake in the mini-ratna public sector undertaking, which mines iron ore at Bailadilla and Bellary Hospet. These regions are famous for their high-grade ore. 

 Sources said the steel ministry would make it clear at the cabinet meeting that it prefers a clause similar to the one followed in the case of PSU banks. It is a restrictive proviso which states that no single shareholder will hold more than 1 per cent stake in these highly profitable firms. 

 The finance ministry is against the idea. Instead, it prefers sucking out reserves from the company by way of a special dividend and then splitting the stock into lower denomination face value shares to make it attractive to small investors. 

 However, the steel ministry has reservations about NMDCs savings being sucked out merely because the government needs financial resources. It also feels that Kudremukh Iron Ore Co Ltd should be first merged with NMDC as it would help them capitalise on each others synergies. 

 Steel minister Ram Vilas Paswan has gone on record saying that it is his plan to merge all state-run mining entities into one and all state-run steel firms into another behemoth.

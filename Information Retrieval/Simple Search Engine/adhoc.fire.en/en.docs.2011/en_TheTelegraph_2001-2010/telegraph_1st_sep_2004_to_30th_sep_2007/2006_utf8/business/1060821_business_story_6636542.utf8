The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Q amp;A

 Wrong choice

 I had invested Rs 38,000 in units of Fidelity Equity Fund, SBI Magnum Comma Fund and Sundaram Capex Opportunity Fund. Can I claim deduction of Rs 38,000 under section 80C for the assessment year 2007-08?

 Bijay Gupta, Calcutta

 The mutual fund schemes you have invested in are all ordinary diversified equity plans and not equity-linked savings schemes (ELSS) of the respective fund houses. The tax benefit under section 80C is available only in ELSS and not in any equity scheme. You will not get any tax deduction on your investment in the schemes mentioned above.

 Play your cards safe

 Im a retired person and above 65 years of age. My annual income is less than Rs 1,85,000. I was allotted a PAN GIR number while on service. I need to sell a jointly owned property now. Do I need to have an updated PAN card? 

 Manas Paul, Calcutta

 If you already have a PAN card it would suffice for any future references. A permanent account number (PAN) once allotted remains the same forever. However, if you were allotted only a PAN GIR number and not the card, then you will have to apply for an updated card. 

 State of finances

 Can a state government employee investing Rs 70,000 every year in a PPF account and Rs 30,000 in a GPF account claim deduction of Rs 1 lakh under section 80C? 

 A.C. Sarkar, Salt Lake

 Yes, one can claim deduction of the amount of Rs 1 lakh from the total annual income under section 80C.

 Taxed or not

 I retired from a private company due to health reasons and have invested Rs 6 lakh in a post office MIS with my wife. We dont have any other income apart from the monthly interest. What will be our tax liabilities (our total annual interest income is Rs 54,000) and how do we save on taxes?

 Dhiman Bagchi, Salt Lake

 ce your total annual income, which is the sum of monthly interest income from POMIS, is less than Rs 1 lakh, you are not taxable. Neither do you have to file any annual returns for income tax purposes.

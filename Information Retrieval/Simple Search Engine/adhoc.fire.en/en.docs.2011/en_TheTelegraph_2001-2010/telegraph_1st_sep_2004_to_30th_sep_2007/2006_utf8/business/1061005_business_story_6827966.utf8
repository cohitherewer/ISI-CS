 New Delhi, Oct. 4: To cash in on the booming digital camera market in India, Japanese electronics firm Casio has tied up with HCL Infosystems Ltd to market, sell, service and distribute its digital cameras here.

 The exclusive tie-up with HCL Infosystems is aimed at expanding our presence in the country to 25 cities in the next six months, said Kulbhushan Seth, head (sales and marketing) of Casio India. 

 Seth said the digital camera market in India was valued at around Rs 250 crore and expected to grow by 100 per cent within the next year. 

 Expecting the market to cross the Rs 1,000-crore mark by 2010, Casio India plans to increase its share in the country to 25 per cent by the end of the year from around 10 per cent and become a market leader in two to three years. 

 We aim to become a market leader in two to three years. To ensure it and set up a strong distribution network within the country, the tie-up with HCL Infosystems was necessary, Seth said. 

 Stating that digital cameras contribute around 10 per cent to the companys turnover, Seth said Casio India expects to increase the contribution to 40-50 per cent of the total turnover by next year. The current turnover stands at Rs 50 crore.

 Casio Indias product portfolio includes digital cameras, wrist watches, clocks, calculators, digital diaries, pocket viewers and electronic musical instruments. 

 We aim to provide the latest technology at affordable prices. We simultaneously launch the products in India as soon as they are launched worldwide. For digital cameras, we are planning a communication strategy that includes the electronic media. Our media spend would be around Rs 1 crore in this fiscal, said Seth. 

 The latest from the house of Casio is the Exilim range with 10 mega pixel capacity and anti-shake DSP (digital signal processors) that reduces blurring due to camera shake and subject movement. The product is available in the price band of Rs 16,000 and Rs 30,000.

 Sanyo beams bounce-back signal

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, March 28: Sanyo Electric Co Ltd, the Japanese consumer electronics major, is looking to carve out a substantial marketshare in India.

 Close to $73 million has been invested in its 50:50 joint venture with BPL called Sanyo BPL Private Ltd, which was formed in December 2005. Another $27 million will come in as working capital investment over the next 12 months. 

 The company plans to increase its colour television (CTV) market in India from 8 per cent to 16 per cent by 2007 and increase the number of CTV units manufactured to 1 million by 2009. 

 This will make Sanyo the second Japanese consumer electronics company after Sony to aggressively pursue a piece of the Indian market. The market in India is dominated by the Korean mega brands like Samsung and LG. 

 While the joint venture will be looking at marketing and sales of CTVs for the rural and the semi-urban markets in the country, Sanyo India Private Limited, a 100 per cent subsidiary of Sanyo Electric Co, will look at the marketing and sales of high-end products like plasma and flat screen TVs for the Indian market. 

 Sanyo plans to raise its dealer network to 16000 from 2500 in the coming years. 

 ?We will be aggressive again in the Indian market and we have the assets now and will use them to our advantage, quot; Toshimasa Iue, president of Sanyo Electric said on his first visit here today. 

 ?We will be using the BPL distribution network and the 300-plus customer care centres for after sales services,? said V.G. Rajagopalan, vice-president (marketing). 

 ?We are aiming at a sales turnover of $500 million by 2008-09 from our Indian operations,? Toshiki Yabuuchi, CFO, Sanyo BPL, said. 

 ?The Indian consumer is more demanding today. The Sanyo and BPL brands will provide such a platform,? Ajit Nambiar, CEO, Sanyo BPL Pvt Ltd said.

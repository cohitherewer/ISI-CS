 FII selloff sparks share slide

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, March 8: The sensex today plummeted 217 points as investors ? jittery after a huge selloff by FIIs in the futures and options segment ? sold heavily across the board. This is the biggest single-day fall since September 22, 2005, when the benchmark index plunged by 265.50 points.

 Panic was triggered in an otherwise dull market towards noon when data showed that foreign investors made net sales of Rs 1,600 crore in futures, of which around Rs 1,500 crore was in Nifty futures alone. Investors started selling on fears of a major FII pullout in the near future. While the key equity indices have touched historic highs recently, there have been apprehensions that Indian stocks are overvalued at their current levels.

 The BSE benchmark index, which started the day on a softer note at 10728.39, witnessed a virtual meltdown after the mid-session. As the selloff gathered pace, the sensex dipped to an intra-day low of 10493.91 before closing at 10,508.85 against yesterdays 10725.67, a net fall of 216.82 points or 2.02 per cent. 

 This fall came even as the combined turnover in both the exchanges was an all-time high of Rs 60,469 crore.

 While some saw the fall as a necessary and healthy correction needed by an overpriced market, there were others who felt that the indices are likely to bounce back tomorrow. However, most market watchers are awaiting the data showing the FII behaviour in todays trading.

 Though the selloff was across the board, metal stocks bore most of the brunt. The BSE metal index crashed by 340.28 points or 4.32 per cent on reports of a fall in international aluminium and copper prices. In yesterdays trading on the London Metal Exchange (LME), prices of leading non-ferrous metals plummeted by over $100 per tonne compared with the average prices last month.

 As the softening global prices are expected to hit the realisations of domestic firms, investors sold shares of Nalco and Hindalco. Even shares of Tata Steel and SAIL could not break out from the jinx that pervaded non-ferrous metal shares.

 FMCG shares, which have scored huge gains in recent weeks on account of better performances from majors like HLL, also suffered a setback. The BSE FMCG index lost 2.77 per cent or 56.65 points as HLL and ITC came under selling pressure. Heavyweights like Reliance Industries and ONGC also contributed to the huge fall.

 On the BSE, the volume of business spurted to a five-year high of Rs 5,818.03 crore from Rs 5,328.33 crore yesterday.

 Lloyds picks new chief

 London, March 7 (Reuters): Lloyds of London on Tuesday named Richard Ward, former head of the International Petroleum Exchange (IPE), as its chief executive, tasked with implementing a three-year plan to revive the insurance market.

 Lloyds, the worlds largest insurance market which is made up of 62 syndicates underwriting insurance, said Ward will start on April 24.Ward had been tipped as the front-runner to take over at Lloyds. He was chief executive of London-based IPE, which was rebranded ICE, from 1999 to 2005, and has since been vice chairman of ICE Futures.

 Lloyds began a search for a new leader after announcing last October that Nick Prettejohn, its CEO, was leaving to become head of the UK business of Prudential, Britains second-largest life insurer.

 The 317-year-old market in January launched a three-year strategic plan aimed at ensuring its survival against increasing competition from overseas.

 A string of new insurers was set up last year in Bermuda, which has a fast-growing insurance industry, to exploit demand for certain types of insurance following last years US hurricanes, which could cost the industry up to $80 billion (?46 billion).

 In Wards six years as chief executive of IPE, he led the exchange through a period of radical development to improve efficiency and profitability, and Lloyds said he faces a similar task and joins the market at a critical time.

 Lloyds has made huge progress in recent years and is in good shape, but we are clear there is still much to do to improve the markets efficiency and move to the next level, said Peter Levene, chairman of Lloyds.

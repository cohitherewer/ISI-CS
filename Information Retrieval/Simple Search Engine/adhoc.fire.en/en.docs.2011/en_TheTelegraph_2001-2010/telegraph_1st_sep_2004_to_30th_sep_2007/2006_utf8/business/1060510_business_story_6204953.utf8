 MTNL to offer STD service

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 9: Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited (MTNL) has won a national long distance licence (NLD). This win paves the way for a fresh bout of STD rate cuts.

 Sources in MTNL said the state-owned company, which offers telecom services in Delhi and Mumbai, received a letter of intent from the government giving it the go-ahead for an NLD licence. The company is working out the cost structure of the STD service between Delhi and Mumbai. 

 An NLD licence will enable the state-owned telephone company to offer STD services without having to use the network of either BSNL or any other private operator. 

 Sources said MTNL plans to keep BSNL out of the hugely profitable Delhi-Mumbai circuit where it will use its own NLD network. 

 We have received the NLD licence and are busy preparing the cost structure for our STD service between Delhi and Mumbai, said Anita Soni, director (finance) of MTNL.

 Soni said no decision has been taken about the traffic in the rest of the country.

 We are discussing with BSNL on getting a competitive rate (carriage charge). Or we will look at other options where we can get competitive rates, said Soni.

 Possessing its own NLD licence could save MTNL up to Rs 400 crore when it begins carrying its own traffic.

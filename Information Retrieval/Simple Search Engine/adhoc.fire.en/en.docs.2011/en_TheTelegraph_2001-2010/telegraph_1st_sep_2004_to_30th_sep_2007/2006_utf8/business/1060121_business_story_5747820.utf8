 Maruti takes a Swift ride

 New Delhi, Jan. 20: Riding on the popularity of its recently-launched Swift, Maruti Udyog Ltd has posted a 41 per cent growth in earnings during the third quarter ended December. 

 The countrys largest carmakers net profit swelled to Rs 339 crore against Rs 239 crore in the same period last year. Cost savings have also helped Maruti post a higher profit.

 Total income (net of excise) increased to Rs 3,220.79 crore compared with Rs 3,016.47 crore in the corresponding period last fiscal.

 The carmaker has registered growth at a time when the industry has been plagued by an overall drop in volumes due to a cyclical downturn, higher input costs, tougher anti-pollution norms and the introduction of a new value-added tax regime.

 Marutis overall sales rose nearly 7 per cent in the October-December quarter at 1,45,013 units. However, exports dipped by 44 per cent.

 From this month, the company has hiked prices across all models ranging between Rs 1,500 and Rs 15,000. This was the second price increase announced by MUL. It had earlier raised prices in October.

 The company has attributed the price rise to higher input and freight costs, which has gone up following the rise in oil prices.

 It has also announced plans to invest Rs 2,178 crore by 2008 and add five more cars to its stable, including a diesel vehicle, over the next five years.

 These investments are over and above the Rs 3,000 crore that Maruti is pumping in setting up a new car plant and a diesel engine facility.

 Earlier this month, the government sold an 8 per cent stake in the company for Rs 1,567.60 crore to eight financial institutions. It may sell the remaining 10 per cent holding at an appropriate time.

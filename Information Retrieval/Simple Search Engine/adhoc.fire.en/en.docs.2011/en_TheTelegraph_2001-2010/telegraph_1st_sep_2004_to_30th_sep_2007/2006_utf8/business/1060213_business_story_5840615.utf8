 Q amp;A

 Cost of maturity

 I have invested in Kisan Vikas Patra. The amount will double in seven years, which is three months from now. Please let me know whether I shall have to pay tax on the whole amount or on the interest accumulated. My public provident fund for 15 years will mature in August 2006. Do I have to pay tax on the whole amount or on the interest?

 H.B. Mukherjee, Jamshedpur 

 Till April 2005, only the interest component of an investment in Kisan Vikas Patra was subject to income tax deduction under section 80L. However, the tax deduction under section 80L has been withdrawn from April last year. Hence, you will now have to pay a tax on the interest earned on the KVP. The rate of tax will be determined by your total income, including the interest income from the KVP. The principal amount will not be taxed. For PPF, the maturity is tax-exempt now. 

 Forget about tax

 I am 62 years old and a retired person. My sources of income are interest from post office monthly income scheme (Rs 48,000 per annum) and interest from senior citizens (9 per cent) account in bank (Rs 45,000 per annum). Thus, my total income for the year 2005-06 is Rs 93,000. Am I liable to pay income tax?

 L.V. Waugh, Rourkela

 If Rs 93,000 is your total annual income, then you dont have to pay any tax. This is despite the fact that you are not a senior citizen in the eyes of the income tax department. 

 Senior status

 I have retired from service on December 31, 2001 and I have attained the age of 65 in December 2005. The income tax department defines a senior citizen (for tax assessment) as one who has attained the age of 65 years at any time during the previous year. Am I entitled to the special concessions, including higher exemption limit, under the Income Tax Act for the assessment year 2006-07?

 Manoj Kumar Dutta, Calcutta

 No, you cant claim the tax benefits as a senior citizen though you have attained 65 years last December because you have to attain that age in the previous assessment year, not calendar or financial year. The income tax return that you are going to file in 2006 is for the financial year 2005-06 and assessment year 2006-07. So, you can claim senior citizen benefits from the next assessment year.

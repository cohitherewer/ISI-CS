The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Strict vigil on Jet-Sahara deal 

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 Gupta: Taking stock

 Action may be initiated if the Centre feels the merged entity is abusing its new-found monopolistic status. 

 The complete facts (about the takeover or merger) would be known only when the two sides approach the high court that has jurisdiction over them to seek approval of the merger. Once these facts are conveyed to the government, it will certainly look into all relevant aspects according to the provisions of the law, company affairs minister Prem Chand Gupta told The Telegraph. 

 Several Left ministers have written to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh seeking a probe into stock market operations prior to the deal as well as violations of the monopoly laws. Last week, after months of speculation, Jet took over Air Sahara for Rs 2,300 crore. It announced that the two airlines would be merged after formal regulatory approvals are granted. Officials expected letters written to the Prime Minister on the issue may be redirected to the company affairs ministry as it dealt with such cases.

 So far, I have only learnt of this merger from the media. However, I may tell you that under existing provisions of the Companies Act, no merger can be affected unless the high court gives its order on the issue and at that stage the government will be involved, Gupta said. 

 He added that Section 31 of the MRTP Act contains provisions for investigation of monopolistic behaviour and restrictive trade practices while Section 2 (I) defines monopolistic trade practices. But, right now we do not visualise any cause for concern, Gupta said. The important thing is that in todays liberalised world and Indias own stage of economic development, the size of the undertaking itself should not be any cause for concern. It is only when there is misuse the dominant position that we have cause for concern. After all, an even more powerful airline could enter the market since we follow an open skies policy or an existing player could buy an even larger fleet or network.

 The minister, however, added that the far harsher Competition Act 2002 had not been implemented as it was sub-judice before the Supreme Court and probes under it could not be launched. But there should be no apprehensions about the absence of legal mechanism to look into such issues .... we have them. 

 Look at the Microsoft case, the European Commission had imposed a penalty of nearly $700 million against the Bill Gates-run firm for monopolistic and unfair trade practices. Now Korea has also done the same. What I wish to point out is that action can be and will be taken if someone does abuse monopolistic powers, he said.

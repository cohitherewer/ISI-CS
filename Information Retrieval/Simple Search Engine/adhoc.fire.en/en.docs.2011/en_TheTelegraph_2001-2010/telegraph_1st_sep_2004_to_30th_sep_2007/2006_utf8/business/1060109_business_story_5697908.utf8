 Snuffing out the Ulip craze

 The Ulip bubble appeared to burst when the regulator devised new guidelines. Srikumar Bondyopadhyay checks what?s in store for investors

 Tapas Majumdar bought a unit-linked life insurance plan from a leading private insurer in the country two years ago. He is a little worried now. 

 Last month, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) issued new norms for Ulips being sold by insurers hence forth. While the plans in the pipeline will have to fall in line with the new guidelines immediately, the insurers have time till June 30 this year to modify their existing Ulips to conform to the new rules.

 So, what do the new rules say?

 First, all Ulips sold by life insurance companies must have a minimum sum assured ? 50 per cent of the total premium paid over the tenure of the policy or five times the annualised premium, whichever is higher. Even the existing Ulips must comply with this on or before June 30, failing which they will not be allowed to sell. 

 A Ulip, after all, is an insurance plan and not an investment product, says the regulator. 

 When Majumdar bought a Ulip from ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company, he opted for a 20-year policy term with a sum assured of Rs 1 lakh. The annual premium for the policy worked out at Rs 18,000. Now, under the new rules, this sum assured will go up to Rs 1,80,000. 

 ICICI Prudential Life Insurance is, however, not the only insurer who will have to provide for increased insurance to their existing Ulip customers. 

 Most of the insurance companies, which have been making money hands over fist with unit-linked plans, have been selling them as investment products rather than insurance products, offering low life cover thereon.

 ?A higher life cover on their existing unit-linked plans may prove a cost burden for many insurers. They will now have to reallocate the invested funds so as to comply with this norm and this, in other words, means a lower return for Ulip holders,? said a senior official with another private life insurance company on condition of anonymity.

 Second, all Ulips must have a three-year lock-in period during which no withdrawals, even partial, will be allowed. 

 ?This norm will make Ulips less popular now and decelerate the growth of the product,? said Sam Ghosh, managing director, Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance Company. This clause will apply to the existing policies also. 

 However, a three-year lock-in will free the insurance companies from the redemption pressure during the initial years and will help them invest more judiciously and give a better return to investors. 

 But, unlike the mutual fund houses, these life insurance companies lack the in-house expertise of fund managers. 

 They can?t outsource the fund investment activities either under the IRDA regulations. This becomes clear from the fact that the existing Ulips struggled to match the stock market return (see chart).

 Further, it should be remembered that the net asset value of an Ulip does not depict the true value of the policyholder?s investment. When one buys a Ulip, the units are bought at the NAV. 

 But, the insurer deducts its expenses from the Ulip holder?s account by knocking off the units in the kitty. This reduces the number of accumulated units of the policyholder and hence the investment value. 

 These expenses have hitherto been quite hazy.

 Third, the insurers will now have to clearly mention and display on the policy prospectus/brochure all the expenses in their Ulips. 

 ?This will definitely make Ulip investment more transparent to buyers,? said Ghosh. 

 But he didn?t agree that this would entail a reduction in Ulip costs, at least for now.

 ?It is unlikely that the insurers can reduce the charges on their existing schemes all of a sudden. They may reduce them in their new plans,? Ghosh added. 

 Fourth, the insurers will also have to publish the portfolio of investments under their various Ulips so that a buyer can make an informed decision. 

 However, all these entail a cost on the part of the insurers and this is likely to eat into the returns on Ulip investment.

 Banks free to pick auditors

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 New Delhi, Jan. 21: In a surprise move, the finance ministry has given the boards of state-run banks the freedom to appoint statutory auditors. 

 In a letter written to the banks, the finance ministry says they may obtain names of statutory central auditors and branch auditors from the Comptroller amp; Auditor General of India and the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India, respectively, and appoint them with prior approval of the Reserve Bank.

 However, the RBI and CAG, who used to appoint these auditors, are not amused by the North Block move. They feel the move in the name of PSU autonomy may see a conflict of interest with bank boards appointing friendly auditors.

 The whole problem, sources say, is that many private and co-operative bank boards have been known to follow a policy of hiring or firing auditors in order to tailor accounts. 

 In several banks, including Global Trust Bank, the RBI had discovered that the auditors had allowed a set of fudged numbers to be reported when actually their net worth had turned negative. 

 Both RBI and CAG feel the current system of selection of auditors for PSU banks is far more independent because both these entities act as watchdogs in the selection process. Consequently, these auditors have been able to maintain an independent stance while evaluating bank accounts. 

 In many cases these auditors have managed to bring to light major financial irregularities which bank boards or management may have otherwise whitewashed, sources said. 

 The finance ministrys letter (D. No. 7/48/2004-BOA) is a follow-up action to the discussions held with bank chiefs last year. The letter, however, gives banks the option to follow the old system of letting RBI appoint their auditors. 

 Sources say as auditors have not always got along with bank boards, these boards are trying to get friendly auditors. Officials said even the ICAI, which is not affected by the finance ministry directive, has written a letter to Vinod Rai, additional secretary, protesting the move.

 This letter apparently states there must always be somebody who will not look at the business from the point of view of management and who will act and look at it from the point of view of good governance and goes on to state that if government bodies like CAG do not have time to be involved in the exercise, then responsibility (of appointing PSU bank auditors) could be handed over to the RBI only.

 Both CAG and ICAI seem to feel that public sector banks should be treated as other PSUs in terms of audit as they represent major interests of citizens of this country.

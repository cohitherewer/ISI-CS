 Mutual magic charms Gulf investors

 SRIKUMAR BONDYOPADHYAY

 Calcutta, Aug. 16: Investors from United Arab Emirates have been the largest subscribers to Indian mutual fund schemes followed by those from the UK, according to a study by the Reserve Bank of India.

 The apex bank undertook a survey in the first half of 2005 to assess the foreign assets and liabilities of the growing domestic mutual fund industry and it found that investors from the Gulf country subscribed to the schemes more than those from any other nation.

 The UAE investors share in the outstanding units issued by Indian fund houses to non-resident investors went up steeply from 3.49 per cent on March 31, 2003 to 13.96 per cent on March 31, 2005.

 In the last three years, the share of Singapore also increased from 0.85 per cent to 2.06 per cent.

 The share of all other countries, including the US, the UK, Hong Kong and Switzerland, declined steadily.

 The survey also reveals that Mauritius was the largest contributor to foreign direct investment in Indian mutual fund companies at 48.65 per cent on March 31, 2005. However, its share remained almost at the same level over the last three years.

 The other countries that contributed to the equity holdings of Indian mutual fund joint ventures include the Netherlands, the UK, Singapore, Canada and the US. Of these, FDI from the Netherlands showed a steady growth over the last three years from 9.83 per cent in 2003 to 18.14 per cent in 2005. The share of the UK rose to 26.60 per cent in 2004 from 18.97 per cent in 2003, but declined to 11.87 per cent in 2005. The shares of all other countries declined steadily.

 According to the survey, Sri Lanka and Mauritius were the only two countries where Indian asset management companies formed joint ventures or picked up an equity stake in the local mutual funds/companies. Sri Lanka accounted for a large share of the total FDI by Indian mutual funds. The share of Mauritius steadily increased from 12.50 per cent in 2003 to 13.78 per cent in 2005, while that for Sri Lanka declined from 87.50 per cent to 86.22 per cent.

 The domestic funds still preferred to invest (under their different schemes) in stocks of companies in developed markets rather than in developing ones.

 The top five countries attracting more than half of portfolio investments of domestic mutual funds include the US, Japan, Germany, Sweden and Switzerland.

 Prime Focus buys UK firm

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, May 11: Prime Focus Ltd has acquired a 55 per cent stake in UK-based VTR Group for ?4.7 million.

 This is our first overseas acquisition and VTR is one of the largest post-production firms in the UK. Since we offer similar services, we have strategic synergies, said Namit Malhotra, managing director of Prime Focus.

 The deal comprises ?4.2 million as cash and equipment worth ?0.5 million, Malhotra said.

 Prime Focus, an end-to-end post-production and visual effects service house, will hit the primary market with an initial public offering of Rs 115 crore. It has already filed the draft red herring prospectus with Sebi.

 Reliance Capital holds about 14.53 per cent in Prime Focus, Adlabs 4.66 per cent and Rakesh and Rekha Jhunjhunwala around 8.5 per cent. The balance is held by promoters and persons acting in concert.

 The UK acquisition is part of the objectives set in the IPO, which also includes setting up studios in the US, Dubai and Hyderabad, Malhotra said.

 The company will offer more services and set up a centre for high-end visual effects and animation, he added.

 This acquisition would provide Prime Focus with an internationally recognised post-production and visual effects facility, which would enable it to bag outsourcing contracts for visual effects and other media services.

 After the acquisition, Namit Malhotra will join the board of VTR as chairman. Naresh Malhotra and Rivkaran Chadha have also been appointed to the board as non-executive directors.

 Prime Focus reported revenues of Rs 33.57 crore for the first nine months ended December 31, 2005 and a profit after tax of Rs 11.04 crore. 

 VTR Group, a ?20-million media service company, has a fully integrated service for top-end commercials, music videos, feature films and channels branding and packaging.

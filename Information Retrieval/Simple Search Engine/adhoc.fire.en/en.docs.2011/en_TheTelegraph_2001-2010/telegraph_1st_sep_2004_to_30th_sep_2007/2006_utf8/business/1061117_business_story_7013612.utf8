 Cabinet okays trade pact with China

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 16: Ahead of the maiden visit of Chinese President Hu Jintao next week, the Union cabinet today agreed to a bilateral investment promotion and protection agreement (BIPA) with China.

 The agreement will increase investment between China and India and will be in force for 10 years, Union minister for information and broadcasting Priya Ranjan Das Munshi said after the cabinet meeting.

 The two sides are also expected to sign 12 pacts, including BIPA, to boost trade and commerce during the four-day visit. Trade between the two countries has been growing rapidly and is expected to touch $20 billion this fiscal against $18.7 billion last year.

 The signing of BIPA will be significant as Chinese companies have taken up projects worth $2.2 billion in India during the first half of 2006. This represents a big jump over the $1.8 billion of business that they secured last year.

 However, Chinese companies have some misgivings over not being allowed to invest in ports and telecommunications where India has security concerns.

 However, of the 38 foreign direct investment proposals submitted by Chinese companies, as many as 33 have been cleared since 2004.

 According to a recent AT Kearneys FDI Confidence Index, which polled global executives to determine their order of preferences, India has displaced the US as the second-most favoured destination for FDI in the world after China.

 However, Chinese firms wanting to enter telecommunications and ports continue to face problems. New Delhi has derailed the Indian plans of Hong Kong-based Hutchison Port Holdings, a unit of Hutchison Whampoa. 

 In the past, Chinese telecom firms Huawei Technologies and its rival ZTE Corp have been denied permission by the FIPB to invest in India.

 India has rejected a bid by China Harbor Engineering Company for the Vizhinjam port near Thiruvananthapuram as the company is also developing Pakistans Gwadar port, which opens the possibility of a Chinese naval presence next to Indian borders.

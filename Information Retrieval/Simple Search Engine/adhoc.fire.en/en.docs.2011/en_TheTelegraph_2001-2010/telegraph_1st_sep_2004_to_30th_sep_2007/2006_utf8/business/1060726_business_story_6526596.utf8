 Calcutta, July 25: BK Birla flagship Kesoram Industries has reported its best-ever performance during the April-June quarter of this fiscal. Net profit increased more than four fold and sales grew 22 per cent, backed by strong realisation from its cement business.

 For the quarter ended June 30, earnings rose to Rs 63 crore from Rs 12 crore in the same period last fiscal.

 Sales stood at Rs 554 crore compared with Rs 456 crore in the April-June quarter of 2005-06. Director S.K. Parik said strong demand for cement and its high prices were the growth drivers. Coupled with this, the companys tyre business also posted a robust performance. 

 Kesoram has a 2.9-million-tonne cement capacity split into two plants located in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh.

 It has undertaken a Rs 456-crore expansion programme to raise the capacity by 1.6 million tonnes. The new capacity will start production later this year and its contribution will be reflected from the next fiscal.

 Segment results show that profit from its cement business leapfrogged from Rs 12.04 crore last year to Rs 88.61 crore in the April to June quarter of this year. Our plants have operated at more than rated capacity. Moreover, we sold out old stocks. So sales were high, Parik said.

 Cement sales stood at Rs 273.78 crore against Rs 171.21 crore in the year-ago period. After a long time, prices were strong in Andhra Pradesh this quarter. The company also cut down on logistic costs by shifting despatches from road to railways.

 Parik said the outlook remains positive for cement even as second quarter results may not match the reporting quarter, as cement prices traditionally go down during monsoon.

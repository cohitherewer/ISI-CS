The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Corporation in merger mode

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 30: Corporation Bank is planning to merge with itself CorpBank Homes, the wholly owned housing finance subsidiary, and CorpBank Securities, the primary dealer subsidiary, said chairman and managing director B. Sambamurthy.

 Corporation Bank is also set to acquire the management control of two money transfer companies, one in Oman and the other in Qatar.

 We have already sought the RBIs approval for taking over the management control of the money remittance company in Oman. We are yet to apply before the central bank of UAE, he said.

 The bank has received the RBI approval to open a representative office in Dubai. Sambamurthy said the representative office would be gradually converted into a full-fledged bank.

 The bank will start offering its proprietary credit card before the end of this calendar year. We will start the credit card business as soon as the board approves the proposal, he said.

 The bank will add more than 100 branches during the next 12 months to take it to 1,000 from 835 at present and increase the headcount by 1,000.

 SIP to snip the risk

 Never invest at one go. Prefer systematic plans, says Srikumar Bondyopadhyay

 Last December, Shantanu Mitra invested Rs 1 lakh in the SBI Blue Chip fund when the mutual fund house floated the scheme. Eight months later, his investment has gone under water. The current market value: Rs 99,000, which is less than his original investment. 

 There are hordes of people who had invested in mutual fund schemes that hit the market early this year and now have a net asset value (NAV) below the face value of Rs 10. 

 Over a longer period of time, the loss will be wiped out and the schemes will hit the profit trail again. 

 But how many people have the patience to sit out this uncertain period, remain unfazed by a paper loss on their investments and hang on grimly till the tide of fortune turns. 

 Thats the greatest problem of a lump-sum investment in equity schemes at one go. Agreed, equity investments should be made with a long-term perspective. But is there a better way to reduce the risks associated with stock investments. The answer is: yes. Short-term volatility can be reduced by what is called price averaging or systematic investment plan (SIP), to put it simply. 

 Under this plan, investments are made at regular intervals rather than at one go. 

 However, an SIP can be improved by integrating it with a systematic withdrawal and reinvestment plan. This integrated version is called systematic transfer plan (STP). 

 An STP gives the investor the flexibility of switching between mutual fund schemes and, thereby, not only wards off market volatility associated with stock investment to a great extent but also improves the returns on investment by leveraging the fixed income schemes. 

 If you have an investible surplus of Rs 1 lakh, invest it in a liquid fund scheme of a mutual fund for one year. Liquid funds are schemes that invest predominantly in money market instruments, such as treasury bills, commercial papers, and do not have any lock-in period. There are no charges on entry to and exit from the funds.

 Over the last 12-month period, the liquid funds available in the market have given an annual return of between 5.75 per cent and 6.25 per cent, which is similar to those in one-year bank fixed deposits, and over the last 30-day period, the return is 1.5 per cent. 

 Since liquid funds invest in interest-bearing instruments, the return will depend largely on interest rate movement. Liquid funds also have dividend and growth options like equity schemes. 

 After parking your investment in a liquid scheme, you have to issue a mandate to the fund house to switch Rs 8,500 every month from the liquid fund to a diversified equity scheme (of the same house). This takes care of your systematic investment in equities and the overall return is higher than one-time investment in an equity scheme. 

 You can always change the STP mandate with a prior notice to the mutual fund. 

 There is, however, a flipside to such an investment plan: capital gains tax. Both short-term and long-term capital gains taxes are payable on investments in debt instruments (unlike equity investments). 

 Under an STP, the mutual fund house will first redeem liquid fund units having equivalent value to the switching amount and reinvest the money in your chosen equity scheme. The redemption of liquid fund units attracts short-term capital gains tax. 

 If the SIP is made in an equity-linked savings scheme, you can claim a tax deduction under section 80C on the reinvestment amount over the one-year period.

 A year to forget for oil PSUs

 S.P.S. PANNU

 New Delhi, Dec. 25: Year 2006 saw national oil companies reeling under skyrocketing global crude prices as they struggled under a regulated price regime.

 Upstream oil companies ONGC and OIL, which would have raked in millions in a free market, had to pay a Rs 20,000-crore subsidy bill for cooking gas and kerosene from their earnings. 

 This, together with government bonds worth Rs 28,000 crore, would help keep downstream oil biggies Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum from going into the red during the current financial year.

 International crude prices, which had been hardening since last year, reached $75 per barrel in August. They started edging downward in September to an average $62.5 a barrel. They have now come down to around $57 per barrel.

 Even ONGC chairman R. S. Sharma is relieved at the declining crude prices. Sharma says, As much as 90 per cent of the hike in crude prices that ONGC was supposed to have earned, has been passed on to downstream companies.

 He has asked the petroleum ministry to put in place a transparent mechanism by which ONGC passes on about 75 per cent of the increase when crude prices skyrocket.

 However, the political imperatives of the government continue to take precedence over the economics of the oil companies. The public sector oil firms felt they had got a breather with the decline in global crude prices but they were forced to cut petrol and diesel prices by Rs 2 and Re 1 per litre respectively, which lowered their profit margins again.

 With the Opec members deciding to cut output to prevent prices from declining further, oil importing countries appear to be at the receiving end.

 There was little to cheer about in the energy sector this year as natural gas prices have also been moving up with crude rates. GAIL has not been able to source gas for the Dabhol plant and efforts to import gas from Myanmar and Iran have hit a rough patch because of the high price being demanded by the two countries.

 Reliance Industries has announced that it would double the output from its eastern offshore KG basin field. However, the company is locked in a court battle with the National Thermal Power Corporation over the price issue.

 A recent gas find by ONGC in the Mahanadi basin could turn out to be the big one that has been eluding the government-owned company, but it is too early to quantify the reserves on the basis of a single exploratory well. 

 ONGC-Videsh Ltd (OVL) also provides a ray a hope for the countrys energy security as it made a foray into South America and Nigeria this year.

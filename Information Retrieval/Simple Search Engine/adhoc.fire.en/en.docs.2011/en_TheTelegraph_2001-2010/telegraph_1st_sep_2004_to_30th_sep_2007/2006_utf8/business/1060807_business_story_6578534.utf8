 Attrition bug bites tourism mandarins

 GARIMA SINGH

 Way to go

 New Delhi, Aug. 6: The tourism ministry may see a flight of senior bureaucrats to greener pastures.

 It is learnt that Rajeev Talwar, additional director-general in the ministry, is off to DLF to head its hospitality and tourism division, while joint secretary Amitabh Kant is likely to return to his home state, Kerala. He is of the 1980 batch IAS cadre.

 Sources said Kant, who has been in the tourism ministry for five years, is seeking an extension. Kants term ended on July 31, and the ministry has given him a temporary extension of about a week.

 Confirming the development, tourism secretary A.K. Misra said, Yes, there is some move in this direction. He (Kant) may be offered an extension. However, the decision is pending at a very senior level.

 When asked about the period of extension, he said, Nothing has been decided. It could be a term ranging from six months to a year.

 Meanwhile, it is learnt that the Kerala government is keen to have Kant back and may offer him the position of secretary-tourism or secretary-home ministry.

 Kant is a competent officer, and Kerala is aggressively trying to promote itself as a tourist destination. The state government will always be happy to have him, said a senior tourism ministry official.

 Kant, who was chairman and managing director of India Tourism Development Corporation (ITDC), was in charge of Kerala Industrial Development Corporation in his previous posting.

 It is during his tenure that the tourism ministry had launched its Incredible India! campaign.

 Talwar, meanwhile, has already submitted his resignation and is hoping to be relieved later this month. Sources in the ministry said, The file is with the department of personnel but they are yet to accept his resignation.

 Meanwhile, the DLF group has drawn up aggressive expansion plans for the hospitality sector. The group intends to set up over 125 hotels by 2015 and is looking at setting up properties in all segments super luxury, four-star, business, budget hotels as well as service apartments.

 Through its initial public offering, the group is expected to pump in around Rs 4,000 crore into the hospitality sector.

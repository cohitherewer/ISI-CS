 VSNL closes Teleglobe buy

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Feb. 14: The Tatas-owned Videsh Sanchar Nigam Ltd (VSNL) today said it has completed the acquisition of Teleglobe International Holdings Ltd. 

 In July 2005, VSNL had announced the acquisition of Teleglobe for a sum of $239 million, which included a payment of $4.50 per share to Teleglobe shareholders and taking over the net debt of the company on its own book. 

 However, VSNL had mentioned in the buyout agreement that it would take about nine months to close the deal. 

 The combined entity will operate under the name of VSNL International, a company release said. 

 The takeover is a win-win situation for both the companies. For Teleglobe, the deal will strengthen its position in the turbulent telecom industry. Teleglobe went bankrupt in 2002 and was subsequently acquired by investment banks for $125 million. It suffered a net loss of $8.4 million during the first quarter of 2005. However, following the acquisition, Teleglobes annual revenues are expected to go up by 200 per cent in 2006-07. VSNL International, too, will be able to deliver a comprehensive portfolio of next-generation carrier and enterprise solutions. 

 The Teleglobe acquisition is a critical step toward our vision to become a global leader providing customers with comprehensive communications solutions, VSNL executive director N. Srinath said.

 AllBank ready to give cover

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Oct. 22: Allahabad Bank and its four allies in the proposed general insurance joint venture are set to sign the shareholders agreement this month.

 After Japans Sompo has come out clear of all its accounts-related disputes with the financial authorities there, shareholders are no longer uncertain about the proposed joint venture and we are waiting for a date that suits every party in the venture to sign the agreement this month, said Allahabad Banks chairman cum managing director A.C. Mahajan. 

 Allahabad Bank will be the largest shareholder in the venture with a 30 per cent stake, followed by Japanese partner Sompo with a 26 per cent stake. Indian Overseas Bank and Karnataka Bank will hold 19 per cent and 15 per cent respectively, while the Dabur family will pick up 10 per cent in the company. 

 Mahajan said once the shareholders sign the agreement, Allahabad Bank will approach the regulators the Reserve Bank of India and the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority for their approvals. He believes the venture will start operating from the next fiscal.

 The joint venture will start operations with a capital of Rs 100 crore, which is the minimum regulatory requirement for any insurance company to start business in this country.

 Allahabad Bank is also weighing the possibility of applying for a primary dealership (PD) licence to the RBI. Although banks are allowed to undertake government securities business, primary dealers get some added advantage in the from of concessions and so on. We are considering applying for a PD licence soon, Mahajan said. Mahajan also plans to get into stock brokerage through the banks sole subsidiary Allbank Finance. 

 The former executive director of Vadodara Stock Exchange, P.N. Akolkar, has been appointed the new chairman of Allbank Finance.

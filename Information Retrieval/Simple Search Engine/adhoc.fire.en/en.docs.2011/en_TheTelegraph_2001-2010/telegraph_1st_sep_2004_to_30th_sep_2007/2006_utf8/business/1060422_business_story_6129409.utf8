 Calcutta, April 21: Bengal is shining in more ways than one. Export of gems and jewellery from the region, mainly Calcutta, grew 21 per cent in 2005-06 against the national average of 6.5 per cent.

 In 2004-05, the national average was 18 per cent. The growth was affected by a slowdown in the US, which is the biggest export market. Exports to US were lower at 28 per cent against the earlier 36 per cent.

 Growth in the east was spurred by special economic zones like Manikanchan, which enabled the jewellery pieces to be finished in Calcutta. Earlier, the jewellery was sent to Mumbai and Jaipur and then exported from there.

 Global retail majors like Walmart and JC Penny used to source their retail jewellery from China. But we have been able to steer them to India with improved finished products, cost competitiveness and state-of-the-art infrastructure, said Pankaj Parekh, convenor (eastern region) of The Gem amp; Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC).

 The total export value from Bengal was Rs 921 crore, of which Rs 460 crore was generated from Manikanchan and Rs 461 crore from the domestic tariff area. The industry hopes to maintain a 21 per cent growth this fiscal.

 The council has also been given 1,100 sq ft at the common design facility in Manikanchan to set up a model making and casting institute. An additional 350 sq ft has also been allotted for the furnace required for such a facility. A sum of Rs 24 lakh has been allotted for the infrastructure.

 The institute should be operational from June-July, said Shantanu Rajguru, director (eastern region) of GJEPC.

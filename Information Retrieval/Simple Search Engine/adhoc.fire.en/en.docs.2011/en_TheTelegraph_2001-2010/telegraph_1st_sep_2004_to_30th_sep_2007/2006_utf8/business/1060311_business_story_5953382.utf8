 Bengal bullish on renewable energy

 Calcutta, March 10: Bengal is set to receive Rs 750-crore investments from the private sector for commissioning renewable energy projects in the next three to four years.

 The state has a 40-mw installed capacity of renewable energy. It plans to add another 60 mw by 2008 and generate 250 mw by 2012.

 The average cost for such power generation is between Rs 6 crore and Rs 7 crore.

 Moreover, the West Bengal Renewable Energy Development Agency (WBREDA) is in talks with a few private companies to set up a silicon ingot producing plant for silicon wafers used in photo voltaic cells, which will bring in investments worth Rs 1,200 crore. But the companies would need a clear area, said S.P. Gon Chaudhuri, director, WBREDA.

 Nothing has been finalised and discussions are still on. But the facility would require uninterrupted power supply of 25-30 mw and the location would possibly be somewhere in north Bengal which has clear open spaces, he added.

 The most recent investment in this area has been a 3-mw hydel power project by Texmaco in Neora at an investment of Rs 14 crore.

 Out of the 10 crore people who are without electricity in the country, 8 crore reside in the eastern region, Gon Chaudhuri said.

 WBREDA would soon invite expression of interest (EoI) for renewable energy projects of 50-mw capacity. It had earlier sought EoIs for 80-mw capacity. 

 The Union ministry of non-conventional energy sources is planning to change its name to renewable energy, said V. Subramanian, secretary, ministry of non-conventional energy sources.

 The thrust would be on generation rather than installed capacity, as out of the current installed capacity of 7000 mw, only 1500 mw reach the grids. And the issue of making it mandatory for state electricity boards to procure power from renewable energy is still premature. Power needs to be at least 20 per cent of the installed capacity and 10 per cent of the generated capacity of the conventional energy, Subramanian said.

 According to Subramanian, renewable energy should get a better price than conventional power from distribution companies, as they are non-polluting. Last year, of the 2000 mw capacity added, renewable energy comprised 1200 mw.

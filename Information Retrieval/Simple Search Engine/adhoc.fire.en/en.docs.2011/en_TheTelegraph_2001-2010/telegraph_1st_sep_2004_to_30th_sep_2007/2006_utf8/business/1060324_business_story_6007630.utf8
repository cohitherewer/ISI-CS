 Pune, March 23: DaimlerChrysler India, which manufactures Mercedes Benz cars, is scouting for vendors to make tippers for its forthcoming heavy trucks ? the Actros.

 ?We are already in talks with three to four vendors from the eastern and northern parts of the country. A decision will be taken shortly. The tippers will be manufactured according to our given standards,? said a senior official.

 The Actros will be imported to India as a completely built unit from the parent company. The trucks are likely to enter the Indian market by June.

 ?The Actros is a heavy- end truck and will be used for special purpose applications by mining companies,? said Manas Dewan, senior manager, corporate communications, DaimlerChrysler India.

 The company is likely to face competition from other heavy commercial vehicle makers like Volvo and Tatra. At present, the market size of such vehicles is roughly 800 units a year.

 DaimlerChrysler India had confirmed its plans to enter the commercial vehicle segment while launching the latest edition of the Mercedes S-Class and M-Class.

 The company is also planning to enter the luxury bus market. Here, it will compete with Volvo and Hispano, the Spanish bus maker in which the Tatas have a 21 per cent stake.

 ?Right now, we are evaluating the possibilities. An internal study is going on, but first we will test the market. If everything goes well, the buses may be introduced in 2007,? said Suhas Kadlaskar, director, corporate affairs and finance, DaimlerChrysler India.

 In countries like the US, Hong Kong and Taiwan, DaimlerChrysler?s luxury buses sell under the Setra brand. In London, they are sold under the brand name of Citaro.

 In 2005, DaimlerChrysler India sold 2,019 units across all classes. The company?s facility at Pimpri in Pune has the capacity to manufacture 4,000 cars a year. 

 At present, the company only works in a single shift and has 350 employees at its plant. 

 ?There are no plans to introduce a second shift as there is no additional requirement,? said Kadlaskar.

 DaimlerChrysler India sold 829 Mercedes C-Class, 825 E-class and 144 S-class cars last year. Officials said the C and E-classes are the best selling models in India.

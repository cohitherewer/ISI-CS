 Twin SEZ offers from Videocon 

 OUR BUREAU

 July 10: Videocon Industries has proposed to develop two special economic zones (SEZ) ? one in south Bengal and the other in Siliguri.

 In south Bengal, the company has offered to develop a multi-product SEZ, where it will be responsible for bringing in investors, said a state government official.

 Accoridng to officials, the Videocon top brass will be shown the 2,500-acre plot at Guptamani near Kharagpur, which was earlier set aside for the Tata Motors car factory.

 Meanwhile, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has asked state urban development minister Ashok Bhattacharya to acquire 1,000 acres in Siliguri for industrial development. The land will be used for Videocon projects, an IT park and a manufacturing components park.

 The chief minister said Videocon would be one of the companies to use this land. However, since Siliguri might not have the requisite land, we would also look at Jalpaiguri, Bhattacharya said.

 Videocon chairman Venugopal Dhoot had met the chief minister on July 7 to outline the companys projects in the state.

 Videocon is set to invest Rs 800 crore to set up an infotech park and Rs 100 crore to manufacture picture tubes for televisions and computers.

 The minister was addressing a meeting of the Federation of Chamber of Commerce and Industries of North Bengal (FOCIN) in Siliguri. 

 Minister of state for commerce and industry Jairam Ramesh, who was also present at the meeting, said Bhattacharjee considered Nathu La a major opportunity for north Bengal.

 The chief minister emphasised that unless the Siliguri Chamber of Commerce could avail of Nathu La for export, the area would only be flooded with Chinese silk and consumer goods, Ramesh said.

 Ramesh will help the area to leverage the export and import facilities offered by Nathula.

 India could export horticulture products and light consumer goods.

 Ramesh would arrange a meeting on July 17 between Bhattacharya and the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) to put the perishable cargo and integrated cold storage complex at the Bagdogra airport on a fast track. The project was stalled due to land acquisition problems.

 The long-standing demand for opening the Phulabari land customs station for trade with Bangladesh on the Siliguri-Jalpaiguri road would also be fulfilled, said Ramesh.

 He said he would talk to defence minister Pranab Mukherjee to try and relinquish the authority of the armed forces on the Bagdogra airport.

 Tata Motors-Fiat alliance gets ready for a long drive

 Mumbai, July 11: Fiat S.p.A and Tata Motors are considering the possibility of jointly manufacturing cars at Fiats plant in Ranjangaon near Pune even as they examine the option of exchanging products wherein a Tata Motor vehicle will be badged as a Fiat and vice versa.

 The two carmakers are looking to deepen the alliance they forged in March this year.

 Such a prospect had been raised when the grand alliance had been agreed upon but it is only now that the contours of the plan are beginning to emerge. It is almost certain that it will not be just confined to merely marketing the Italian companys vehicles through Tatas dealership network. 

 Over a period of time, it is not inconceivable that a Tata Motors dealer will market other brands from Fiats stable like Alfa Romeo, Maserati and Ferrari.

 Tata Motors chairman Ratan Tata articulated some key details of the broad-based agreement at the annual general meeting of the company here today. Replying to shareholder queries on the subject, he said, It is a broad-based agreement which will develop based on needs, rather than contractual obligations. 

 Justifying the agreement that was signed earlier this year, Tata said it would only go on to supplement the companys initiatives in the automobile space and that it will not hit its market share. Fiat operations are small when compared to ours?We will have access to their technology, new aggregates and we will market some of their products, he observed.

 While Fiat has a unit in Kurla in Mumbai with an installed capacity of 60,000 cars, the Ranjangaon facility has not been operational as yet.

 Earlier this year, senior Fiat officials had said the unit, which has an installed capacity of 100,000 cars, would be made operational if a ramp-up was required. Admitting for the first time that both the companies are looking at the possibility of a joint manufacturing at this site, Tata hastened to add that it would be based on commercial viability.

 Small car

 Tata also provided some details about the much awaited small car. Pointing out that the proposed Rs 1 lakh car will be made of steel, he revealed that Tata Motors and General Electric Company are simultaneously exploring the possibility of using re-engineered plastics supplied by the US multinational for the small car.

 We are keen to explore this area with GE ... Jeff Immelt (GEs chairman ) is also very keen, he said, while adding that though there is no partnership with the US multinational, the use of re-engineered plastics could reduce the time to market, apart from making the vehicle lighter and fuel efficient. 

 Tata said though a car that uses re-engineered plastics in its body is expensive at present, it would be ideal, if there is a cheaper version.

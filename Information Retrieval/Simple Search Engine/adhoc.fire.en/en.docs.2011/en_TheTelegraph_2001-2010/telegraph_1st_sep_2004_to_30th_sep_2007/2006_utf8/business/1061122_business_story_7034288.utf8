New Delhi, Nov. 21: India and China today agreed to double bilateral trade to $40 billion by 2010 and signed a bilateral investment protection agreement to enhance economic cooperation.

 They (India and China) shall make joint efforts to diversify their trade basket, remove existing impediments, and utilise the present and potential complementarities to sustain and strengthen bilateral commercial and economic cooperation, a joint declaration issued after talks between Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Chinese President Hu Jintao, stated. 

 The declaration has urged the joint task force of the two countries to quickly finish its study on the scope of a regional trading arrangement and submit the report by next October.

 The two countries signed a bilateral investment protection agreement that is expected to benefit Indian companies with a sizeable presence in China.

 The visa rules for workers and businessmen from China have been eased to boost bilateral trade and investment.

 The countries also agreed to implement the co-operation pact in oil and gas, signed in January 2006 to lower rivalry in the acquisition of overseas oil and gas assets. The rivalry often inflated the value of such assets.

 The pact also has provisions for collaborations at the enterprise-level in areas such as joint exploration and development of hydrocarbon resources in other countries.

 In the meantime, commerce minister Kamal Nath today assured his counterpart Bo Xilai of Indias openness to Chinese investments. The two will again meet tomorrow to give the final touches to implementing the measures.

 Bilateral trade between the two countries is currently around $17.5 billion, with India exporting $9.7 billion. The composition, however, is skewed with China exporting value-added products and India raw materials such as ores. 

 Greater exchange of experience 

 in agriculture and rural development, including food security, 

 and discussions on agricultural standards were in the declaration.

 Virgin Mobile to ring French bell

 Reaching out

 London, April 1, (Reuters): Richard Bransons Virgin Group will launch a mobile phone service in France on Monday, hoping to replicate its success in Britain in one of Europes least competitive mobile markets.

 Branson is partnering Europes largest mobile retailer Carphone Warehouse for the venture, which will carry the Virgin Mobile brand and offer services by piggy-backing on the network of dominant mobile phone operator Orange.

 Its will be a 50:50 venture between Virgin and Carphone Warehouse, a source close to the companies said on Friday, adding that both groups planned to spend around ?50 million over three years to set up a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO).

 However, Virgin Mobile (UK) Holdings will not hold a stake in the French business, another source said. Virgin Mobile (UK) is in talks to be acquired by cable group NTL.

 Virgin and Carphone officials declined any comment on this.

 Bransons Virgin Group, a music-to-airline conglomerate, helped pioneer the MVNO concept in Britain, where it has become the fifth-largest mobile brand by customers, before expanding into the United States, Canada and Australia.

 Carphone already operates a regional MVNO in France, called Omer Telecom, which will be rolled into the new venture. The firm also has a customer service and billing operation in France.

 France is dominated by its three network operators: Orange, Bouygues Telecom and SFR, which is owned by Vivendi Universal and Vodafone Group, and MVNOs are still to gain significant traction in the market.

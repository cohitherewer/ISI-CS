 Govt discovers leak in gas price formula of Ambanis

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, July 26: The government has rejected Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Industries Ltds proposed valuation formula for gas sale to Anil Ambanis Reliance Natural Resources Limited (RNRL). 

 The formula has been rejected on the ground that it has not been derived on the basis of competitive arms length sales in the region for similar sales under similar conditions. 

 The government has pointed out that the prevailing domestic gas price from fields operated by joint ventures, including private companies, command a much higher price than that mentioned in Reliances proposal.

 The transaction between Reliance and RNRL is part of the de-merger agreement but does not meet the governments production sharing contract criteria of arms length sales. 

 The proposal of RIL regarding the gas price formula for sale of gas to RNRL for the block KG-DWN-98/3 (also known as D-6 block) had been submitted to the government according to the requirement of the production sharing contract (PSC). 

 The government has been opposed to the sale of gas by RIL to the Anil Ambani company at a wellhead price of $2.32 per MBTU when gas from the Panna Mukta fields (where RIL is a stakeholder) was being offered to state-owned GAIL (India) Ltd at $4.8 per MBTU.

 The government is of the view that any price discovery should be the result of an open and transparent competitive bidding process that allows a fair and equal opportunity to all gas consumers to participate in the price discovery.

 The same procedure has already been followed by companies, including Reliance, in the Panna-Mukta and Tapti PSCs. However, to take care of situations where this may not be possible, the government has constituted a committee to prepare a framework of transparent guidelines for such valuation.

 The government said it has now examined the proposal in the light of the provisions of the PSC. The government, as a party to the contract, is concerned with the formula or basis on which the gas under the PSC is to be valued for the purposes of computing cost recovery linked to the valuation of cost petroleum, the profit share of the parties, including the government, and the royalty.

 Late tonight, an RNRL spokesperson said in Mumbai that the government approval was limited to price to be adopted for determining the governments share of profit petroleum. This is a matter between the government of India and RIL. RILs obligation to supply gas to NTPC and RNRL at the previously agreed prices are not affected, he added.

 Gold at three-month low

 Mumbai, June 14 (PTI): Gold prices experienced a free fall today to hit a three-month low. Stockists sold largely in tandem with a weakening global trend. The precious metals price fell between Rs 370 and Rs 470 per 10 grams.

 Gold prices in Delhi plunged by Rs 430 to Rs 8,590 per 10 gram after dipping to Rs 8,230, while in Chennai it lost Rs 425 to close at Rs 8,575 per 10 grams. 

 In Mumbai, it fell by Rs 415 to Rs 8,470, while it lost Rs 370 to close at Rs 8,615 per 10 grams in Calcutta.

 The metal remained a target of profit selling by stockists after reports of a steep fall in its prices in overseas markets, where it fell by $18.31 an ounce to $543.74 an ounce, its steepest one-day decline in 23 years.

 Overseas bullion markets continued to be in a dull phase, as gold continued its longest declining streak in two years. Most of the Asian central banks have raised interest rates, eroding the precious metals appeal as an alternative investment.

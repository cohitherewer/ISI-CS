 Calcutta, July 29: The 350 units under the software technology parks of India (STPI) in and around Calcutta are facing an uncertain future with the Bengal government deciding to take the special economic zone (SEZ) route for all future IT cluster projects. 

 The situation has become particularly critical because the privileges and tax exemptions enjoyed by these 350 units will come to an end on March 31, 2009.

 While the National Association for Software and Service Companies (Nasscom) and other IT organisations are lobbying for the extension of the STPI benefits, the Bengal governments ambivalent stand has made these units apprehensive.

 For all future IT projects, the SEZ course seems to be the logical option, said Debesh Das, the Bengal minister for information technology.

 Though Bengal is trying to get the STPI model extended, Das said much would depend on the policy of the Centre.

 Moreover companies or units under the existing STPI model might not be inclined to move to another location for the purpose of qualifying for SEZ benefits when they have established infrastructure at a certain place, he said.

 The minister was speaking at an interactive session organised by the Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry here today.

 Fujitsu to spend $1 bn on chip plant

 Big plans

 Tokyo, Jan. 11 (Reuters): Japanese electronics conglomerate Fujitsu said on Wednesday it would spend 120 billion yen ($1.05 billion) to build a new microchip plant at its manufacturing complex in Japan to meet growing demand. 

 Fujitsus capacity expansion comes at a time when growth in global chip demand is expected to pick up over the next few years. 

 The new plant, located in central Japans Mie prefecture and set to start output in April 2007, will process 300-mm wafers to make system chips with a circuitry width of 65 nanometres. 

 The large wafers can yield more than twice as many chips as the standard 200-mm variety, helping chip makers slash production costs and offer competitively priced products. 

 Finer circuitry decreases the size of a chip and cuts output cost. It also helps chips process data faster. Most of the worlds advanced chip factories currently use 90-nanometre technology. A nanometre is a billionth of a metre. 

 Fujitsu plans to invest 120 billion yen in the plant in the two years to March 2008 to bring the plants wafer processing capacity to 10,000 units a month. 

 Fujitsu already operates another plant that handles 300-mm wafers at the complex, and it plans to boost the existing plants processing capacity to 15,000 units a month by March 2007. 

 Global microchip demand will likely expand 8.0 per cent in 2006 and 10.6 per cent in 2007, after estimated growth of 6.6 per cent in 2005, according to industry group World Semiconductor Trade Statistics. 

 Prior to the announcement, shares in Fujitsu closed up 4.0 per cent at 1,004 yen, outperforming the Tokyo stock markets electrical machinery index, which gained 1.4 per cent.

 Items under export scheme cut

 New Delhi, Feb. 21 (PTI): The government today deleted diamonds, gems and jewellery, sugar, cereals, ores, and petroleum products from the list of products covered under the export incentive scheme target plus.

 A directorate-general of foreign trade notification announced the amendments to the scheme, which would cover exports during April 1, 2005 and March 31, 2006.

 According to the notification, crude, petroleum and crude petroleum-based products will not be covered under the scheme. The government has decided to discontinue the scheme from the next financial year. However, following the directions of the committee, the items covered under the scheme have also been pruned.

 The move follows directions given by the committee of secretaries which had asked an expert team to examine the export incentives schemes to see if they were WTO compatible. The commerce ministry had launched the scheme with much fanfare in the Exim policy on March 31, 2003 with the rider that it would come into effect from 2004.

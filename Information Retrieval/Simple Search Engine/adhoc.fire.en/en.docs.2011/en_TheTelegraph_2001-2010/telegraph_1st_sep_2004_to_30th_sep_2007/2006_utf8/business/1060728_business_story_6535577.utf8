 Calcutta, July 27: Heavy engineering company Jessop is planning to diversify into shipbuilding, repairing and metro rail coach manufacturing.

 Chairman Pawan K. Ruia said it has applied to the Bengal government for 1,500 acres on the banks of the Hooghly for the ship project, which may entail an investment of over Rs 1,000 crore.

 Jessop is also pursuing a project to build metro rail coaches in its works here in Calcutta, he added.

 The company plans to forge multiple tieups on technological collaboration for both the projects, Ruia said after Jessop?s 74th annual general meeting here today.

 The decision on the metro coach factory could be taken within the next six months. The shipbuilding/repairing project would depend on the allocation of land.

 Sources close to the development said Jessop could be eyeing unutilised land of a public sector company near Haldia.

 Given the small size of Jessop?s balance sheet (a turnover of Rs 78 crore last year), the ship project may be taken up through a separate company. Ruia indicated that Jessop?s holding company could be a partner along with a few others in the project.

 ?The order book of Indian companies are full till 2011. For repairing, ships go to Singapore. So the demand is robust,? he added.

 In order to raise cash for various projects, Ruia has decided to make a public offer and list shares on the Bombay and National Stock Exchange.

 Ruia said he would offload 10 crore share from his personal holding and offer 15 crore fresh shares.

 ?This will also help us meet Sebi regulation on bringing down promoter?s stake,? he added.

 The Centre holds a 4 per cent stake in Jessop, while 94.4 per cent is with Ruia.

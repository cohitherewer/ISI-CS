 ICICI Bank home loan gets dearer

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 High rise

 Mumbai, May 5: ICICI Bank has raised its home loan rates by 50 basis points for all tenors from May 8. 

 The new floating rate will be 9 per cent and the fixed rate 10.25 per cent. 

 The State Bank of India had kicked off the season of hike in home loan rates followed by Oriental Bank of Commerce and Punjab National Bank (PNB) among public sector banks. 

 On May 1, HDFC announced a hike of 50 basis points on both its fixed and floating rate loans. 

 This is the second hike by ICICI Bank this year. The bank had raised its rates on February 1. 

 For floating rate borrowers, the increase in the reference rate by 0.5 per cent will take effect from July 1, in line with the banks policy to review rates quarterly. 

 The hike, however, will not impact the existing fixed rate borrowers. 

 Home loan rates hit a rock bottom of 7 per cent in 2003 when banks started a rate war to win over customers.

 However, to improve the quality of loans, the RBI has increased the risk weight provision from 0.4 per cent to 1 per cent for loans beyond Rs 20 lakh in the first-half credit policy for 2006-07. 

 HDFCs floating rates now range between 9 per cent and 10 per cent, while fixed loans are between 10.5 per cent and 11.25 per cent, depending on the tenure and the principal. 

 The State Bank of Indias fixed rates up to five years is now 9.5 per cent against 9.25 per cent earlier; for 5-10 years it is 9.75 per cent against 9.50 per cent. Floating loan rates have gone up by 0.50 per cent. 

 For loans above five years but less than 10, the rate is now a minimum of 9.25 per cent instead of 8.75 per cent; for loans above 10 years and up to 15, the rate is 9.25 per cent against 9 per cent; for loans above 15 years and up to 20, the rates are 9.75 per cent against 9.25 per cent. 

 Punjab National Bank revised upwards its benchmark prime lending rates from 10.75 per cent to 11.25 per cent. 

 Oriental Bank of Commerce raised rates between 0.25 per cent and 1 per cent, while Bank of India raised home loan rates by 50 basis points under its floating rate scheme.

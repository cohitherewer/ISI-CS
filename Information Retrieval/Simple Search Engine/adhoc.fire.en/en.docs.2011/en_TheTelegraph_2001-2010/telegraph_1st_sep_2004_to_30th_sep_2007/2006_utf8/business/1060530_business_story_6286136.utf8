 Sebi heat on four CSE brokers

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, May 29: The 2001 scam still haunts Calcutta Stock Exchange brokers. The market regulator ? Securities and Exchange Board of India ? has come down heavily on four of its members for gross irregularities in their books of accounts.

 The registrations of Subhash Baheti amp; Co and Archna Khandelwal were suspended for 15 days and three months, respectively, with effect from June 1, 2006. Bagla amp; Co has been barred from trading in stocks for two months from May 19 and Rama Securities Pvt Ltd has been censured.

 The Sebi findings, however, relate to their account books during 2001-02.

 All these brokers messed up their clients funds with their own and did not maintain proper order books and registration details.

 According to a Sebi circular dated February 11, 1997, all brokers are required to maintain a proper order book and issue contract notes to clients confirming their orders for purchase or sale of shares. Brokers simply cant take orders over phone, make transactions and inform clients about deals.

 Brokers are also required to maintain a book on margin deposits by their clients along with their daily positions.

 Nippon Sheet to acquire British glass firm

 Tokyo, Feb. 27 (Reuters): Nippon Sheet Glass Co Ltd said on Monday it had agreed to buy the remaining 80 per cent of British glass maker Pilkington Plc it did not own in a deal worth more than $5 billion.

 The price tag, which includes the cost of taking over Pilkingtons existing debts, surprised some analysts, who said synergy effects from the merger of the two firms were still unclear.

 The price is too high. It will take some time until we find out if the merger will produce synergies, but well see an immediate impact of the huge financial burden on its stock price soon, said Mitsuyoshi Akino, a fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management Co.

 The transaction will be financed chiefly through borrowings of ?1.5 billion ($2.62 billion) from British banks and convertible bonds worth 110 billion yen ($941 million) to Daiwa Securities SMBC and UBS AG, among others.

 The three-year bonds, if fully converted into stocks, would boost the number of Nippon Sheet Glasss common shares by 43 per cent, causing a massive dilution in its share value. The announcement prompted Moodys Investment Service to place Nippon Sheets credit rating on review for possible downgrade.

 While this creates one of the leading sheet glass companies in the world, Moodys is concerned that this sizeable acquisition will impair Nippon Sheets financial flexibility over the medium term, the rating agency said.

 On Monday, the shares closed up 5.2 per cent at 509 yen after a weekend report saying the two firms had struck a deal, while the Nikkei average rose 0.57 per cent.

 Nippon Sheet Glass Chairman and CEO Yozo Izuhara said the company was not considering cutting jobs and that it would also keep Pilkingtons brand name, stressing it was a friendly buyout.

 We expect big synergy effects from this, Izuhara said. We can also, as a true global supplier, offer the best quality and the best prices to major auto makers.

 If the buyout is completed, Nippon Sheet Glass and Pilkington will hold about 14 per cent of the global sheet glass market, taking them close to sector leaders Asahi Glass Co Ltd and Frances Saint-Gobain.

 Under a revised proposal, the Japanese company said it would offer 165 pence a share, up from its previous offer of 158 pence, to buy the stake for ?1.8 billion ($3.1 billion), after its offers had twice been rejected by the British firm.

 The offer represents a premium of about 4 per cent on Pilkingtons latest share price.

 Nippon Sheet and Pilkington had been haggling over price and other issues since Japans number two glass maker made the initial offer in late October.

 The attempt to buy 180-year-old Pilkington, whose sales and market value are about double those of Nippon Sheet Glass, was seen as a big gamble, though some analysts said having access to Pilkingtons production facilities was key to responding to the rapid expansion of Japanese auto makers overseas operations.

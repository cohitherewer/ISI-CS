 Calcutta, Feb. 18: Housing amp; Urban Development Corporation Limited (Hudco) and Shristi Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited have formed a joint venture to set up a five-star luxury hotel-cum-service apartment complex in Bengal at a cost of Rs 400 crore. This project is the first of its kind in India.

 The joint venture company is called Shristi Urban Infrastructure Development Limited. It is one of the three joint ventures formed by Hudco, said company chairman and managing director P.S. Rana.

 Hudco received the mini ratna status in 2004. Since then, it has received more capital to set up such joint ventures to combine the best of private sector efficiency with the brand name of Hudco. It is in the process of signing 12 memoranda of association in various states.

 The core areas for the joint ventures would be real estate and infrastructure and the local market would determine the project type.

 Rana said urbanisation, which has grown from 17 per cent in 1950 to 27.8 per cent in 2001, is expected to go up to 60 to 65 per cent in the next 20 years.

 ?The ultimate aim would be to have at least two such joint ventures in the state,? said Kumari Selja, Union minister of state for urban employment and poverty alleviation, at the foundation stone laying ceremony of the project.

 Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee said such a five-star hotel project entails direct and indirect employment of 5000 people.

 The Intercontinental Hotels Group will manage this project with 225 rooms and 100 service apartments belonging to the five-star luxury category at an investment of Rs 1 crore per room.

 The project will be launched in September 2008. 

 It will be a hotel complex replete with shopping arcades and a replica of the Universal Studios CityWalk. Universal Studios CityWalk is a 30-acre complex featuring an eclectic mix of live entertainment, fun and fine dining establishments, specialty shops and state-of-the-art cinemas. This will be conceptualised and designed by architects like Cervera amp; Pioz of Spain, King Roselli Architetti of Rome and Ruben Anderegg of Switzerland and the Delhi-based C.P. Kukreja Associates.

 The built-up area will be 9 lakh square feet on an eight-acre land.

 Trinamool MLA Tanmoy Mondal, however, said such projects hardly helped the cause of local people who had given up land for these ventures.

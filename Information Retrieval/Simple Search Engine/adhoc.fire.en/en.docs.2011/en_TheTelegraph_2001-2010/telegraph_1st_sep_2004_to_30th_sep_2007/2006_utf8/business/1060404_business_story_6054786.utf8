 Banks spice up short-term deposits

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, April 3: Banks and financial institutions are scrambling to raise interest rates on short-term deposits as they struggle to tide over a temporary cash crunch.

 Last week, ABN Amro offered an 8 per cent interest on a 288-day fixed deposit for a minimum amount of Rs 10,000. Now, housing finance major HDFC is offering a pretty nifty 7.5 per cent on a one-year deposit ? an increase of 75 basis points over the existing rate.

 ABN Amro?s rate is comparable to the Public Provident Fund (PPF), while HDFC?s rate is at least a percentage point higher than that offered by commercial banks in the same maturity basket. At present, nationalised banks offer interest rates ranging between 6 and 6.25 per cent on one-year deposits.

 HDFC has raised its interest rates on deposits by 50 to 75 basis points across various maturities. The rate of interest for two to three years has gone up up by half a percentage point and the rate for deposits above three years is going up by 75 basis points.

 HDFC?s special deposit window is open till April 30. The moves by ABN Amro and HDFC come at a time when both the finance minister and Reserve Bank officials have acknowledged that there is a temporary liquidity crunch.

 Many expect the central bank to devise some way to ease the problem when it unveils the slack season credit policy on April 18, but clearly there are many who don?t want to wait till then.

 One reason for this shortfall is that individuals are preferring to park their money in other competitive instruments like mutual funds rather than deposits as they offer higher returns. 

 Although officials from HDFC did not comment on the reasons behind the special one-year deposit scheme, analysts said it was an attempt by the corporation to make its deposits more attractive. 

 ?It is in line with the general trend in market where interest rates are looking up yet again,? sources added.

 Others say this could be a prelude to another round of rate increase in housing loans by HDFC. 

 It may be recalled that HDFC chairman Deepak Parekh has hinted at the possibility of a 25 to 50 basis point hike in interest rate on housing loans. The corporation has already raised housing loan rates by half a percentage point early this year.

 Observers also note that while HDFC has been offering higher interest rates on deposits than commercial banks, the latter is hamstrung by the fact that any increase in deposit rates will have to be matched by similar hike in advances to maintain spreads. 

 The housing finance major is likely to end the fiscal year 2005-06 with disbursements of over Rs 20,000 crore.

 Analysts feel HDFC is raising deposit rates to be able to meet business commitments.

 Deposits are a major source of funding for the corporation, accounting for more than 16 per cent of the total funds raised. The other sources of funds include overseas borrowings and payments made by existing borrowers.

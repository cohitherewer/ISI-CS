 Land for Satyam centre in Vizag

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hyderabad, Jan. 17: The Andhra Pradesh cabinet today approved a proposal to allot 50 acres of land in Visakhapatnam to Satyam Computer Services Limited for its development centre.

 State information minister Mohammed Ali Shabbir said Satyam will create a special economic zone for IT services in the port town by investing Rs 100 crore.

 According to Satyams estimates, it could employ 2000 engineers directly and 3750 people indirectly and generate an export revenue of Rs 2,300 crore over the next five years, said the minister. 

 The land was being provided to the company at a cost of Rs 10 lakh per acre, Shabbir said.

 He said Satyam wants to expand its operations in Vishakhapatnam to promote back office and software solutions operations in a special economic zone to derive tax and other infrastructure benefits. 

 The Andhra Pradesh government has promoted IT-specific special economic zones in Hyderabad and Vishakhapatnam to decongest IT infrastructure in the state. We have learnt our lessons from what was happening in Bangalore and are taking better precautions. We will set up IT infrastructure in Hyderabad and other parts of the state that will be sufficient for the next 25 years, he said. 

 Satyam achieved a turnover of Rs 3,456 crore in fiscal 2005 and has projected a Rs 4,500-crore turnover in fiscal 2006. It has recorded a CAGR growth of over 81 per cent and net profit at 88 per cent over the last four years. 

 With over Rs 1,000 crore investment in IT infrastructure, Satyam employed over 22,500 people and had presence in 53 countries in six continents. 

 The company achieved a billion-dollar run rate in the last quarter ended September 30 and had 149 fortune global and 500 fortune US companies as its customers.

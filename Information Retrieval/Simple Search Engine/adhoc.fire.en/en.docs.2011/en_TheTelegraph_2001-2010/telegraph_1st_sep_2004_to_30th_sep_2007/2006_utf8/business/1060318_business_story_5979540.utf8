 Nicki Barton: Upbeat

 Calcutta, March 17: ICI Paints is expecting highest revenue contribution from Asia fuelled by growth in India, China, Vietnam, Thailand and Malaysia. These countries are set to contribute a little over 40 per cent to the firms global turnover by 2010.

 The United States is currently ICIs largest market by volume contributing 40 per cent to the global turnover, the UK highest in terms of value and China fastest in terms of growth.

 Evolved markets like the US are stagnating because the construction sector is not witnessing a boom there as it is in Asia. Currently, China contributes around 10 per cent to the global turnover and Indias contribution is less than 5 per cent to the ?2.3-billion global turnover, said Nicki Barton, global marketing manager, ICI UK.

 ICI India had reported a turnover of Rs 567 crore with a net profit of Rs 32 crore last fiscal and expects a growth of 18-20 per cent.

 The organised paints market in India is Rs 6,000 crore. ICI focuses on the premium segment, which comprises 22-25 per cent of the total organised market.

 While the paints industry is growing at 10-11 per cent, ICI is posting 18-20 per cent growth, said Jaideep Mahajan, general manager, institutional business, ICI India Ltd.

 The premium segment is growing between 14 and 16 per cent where ICIs share is around 20-22 per cent.

 ICI is the second largest player in the premium segment and in the overall paints market it is ranked fourth.

 India is the second country where ICI launched its fanbook shade cards comprising 2016 colours. It was first launched in the UK.

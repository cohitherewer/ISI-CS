 Dena money-raising plan gets go-ahead

 Gairola: Green signal

 Mumbai, Sept. 16 (PTI): Dena Bank will raise Rs 250-300 crore next month through the upper tier-II route to meet its capital requirement.

 We have received our boards approval to raise Rs 675 crore in this fiscal, of which Rs 250-300 crore is likely to be raised next month, Dena Bank chairman P.L. Gairola said.

 The amount will be raised in the domestic market, he added.

 The bank has also set an ambitious target of Rs 350 crore in recovery from its non-performing assets (NPAs).

 We are likely to recover Rs 200 crore of outstanding debt and Rs 150 crore through write-offs, he said.

 The public sector bank has roped in leading consultant PriceWaterhouseCoopers to sell off a substantial portion of its NPAs.

 We have provided them accounts worth Rs 600 crore for due diligence and we may decide to sell it off in several phases after evaluation, he said and added that the first lot should be sold off in the next couple of months.

 He, however, declined to state the size of the assets to be sold off.

 Talking about core banking foray, Gairola said Wipro has bagged the contract worth just below Rs 300 crore to bring all its branches on the CBS platform. The pilot project with 10 branches will start in the next three months while more branches will be added by March, Gairola said.

 He added the bank was looking at sites in Hyderabad and Bangalore to set up its disaster recovery (DR) centre.

 The bank has a network of 1,122 branches. 

 Dena Bank also announced its tie-up with UAE Exchange Centre, Abu Dhabi, for a rupee-drawing arrangement.

 The UAE Exchange Centre is the largest exchange house in the United Arab Emirates.

 The arrangement was launched here 

 in the presence of Gairola and UAE Exchange managing director 

 and CEO B.R. Shetty. Through this arrangement, the NRIs 

 in West Asia can remit funds to India by sending rupee drafts 

 drawn by UAE Exchange Centre on 200 designated branches 

 of the bank in India.

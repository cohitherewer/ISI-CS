 Calcutta, Jan. 17: Poland is keen to trade with Bengal in areas of tea and mining.

 A major portion of the tea in Poland is sourced from India. Bengal could export premium quality tea to the country compared with the lower grade versions currently available, Daniel S. Zbytek, first counsellor, head of economic and commercial office, Embassy of the Republic of Poland, said.

 He was speaking on Polands investment and trade opportunities with Bengal at a session organised by the Bengal National Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

 This is the first time the economic and commercial office of the Polish Embassy has set up a stall at the International Mining Exhibition being held in the city.

 Poland, with its considerable coal deposits, generates 80 per cent of the countrys electricity from hard coal and lignite. With its technological expertise, the country has provided assistance to 13 coal mines in India, Zbytek said.

 Polish ties with Bengal could attain new heights through active co-operation in specialised areas like information technology, biotechnology and mining technology and exploration, he added.

 Earlier, Poland had 70 collieries. The figure stands at 41 after extensive restructuring, which also helped improve productivity, Zbytek said.

 The volume of trade between India and Poland for the last fiscal was Rs 1150 crore against Rs 843 crore in 2003-04.

 The profile of Indias export basket to Poland is fairly diversified and includes manufactured tobacco, de-oiled cakes, black pepper, cotton yarn and textiles, cosmetics, chemicals and pharmaceuticals, light engineering products, machine tools and textile machinery. Poland exports furniture, ships, manufactured goods, garments, food products and transport equipment, said Zbyteck.

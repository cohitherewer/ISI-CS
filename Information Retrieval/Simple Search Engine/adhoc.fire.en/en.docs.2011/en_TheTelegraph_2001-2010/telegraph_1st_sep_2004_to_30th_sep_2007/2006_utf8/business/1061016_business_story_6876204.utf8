 MIPs look hot again

 Mutual funds monthly income plans had slid into the doghouse. Srikumar Bondyopadhyay says why they may be back in favour

 Over the past two years, post office savings plans have lost a lot of their lustre. One of the main reasons for this has been the withdrawal of the 10 per cent bonus in the post office monthly income scheme from February. 

 But post office savings plans had already started to lose their attraction even before finance minister P. Chidambaram stepped in and axed the bonus. This was reflected in the fact that total collections under small savings schemes in post offices in 2005-06 were 15 per cent lower than in the previous year. 

 After the withdrawal of the 10 per cent bonus, the deposits in post office schemes, besides public provident fund, fell by 30 per cent.

 Among the small savings plans, the post office MIS has so far been the most lucrative investment avenue, particularly for retirees. 

 Banks have now started offering the same 8 per cent rate of interest on their fixed deposits and this has started denting post office collections because they offer easier liquidity. 

 But the problem with banks is that if the interest income in a year is more than Rs 5,000, a tax at the rate of 10 per cent is deducted at source. 

Try this option

 If you dont mind taking a small risk for a better return, you can consider the monthly income plans being offered by mutual funds. But in one sense this category is a misnomer: it does not promise what it suggests. MIPs are intended to provide a monthly income, as the name suggests. In fact, that was the mandate with which mutual funds launched their MIPs. But after the market regulator clamped down on mutual funds offering assured return schemes in 2000-01 followed by a slump in the bond market beginning 2003-04, monthly income plans of mutual funds slipped into virtual oblivion. They had occupied centre-stage till 2002-03.

But no guarantee

 Now, no mutual fund can guarantee returns on capital. The returns in mutual fund plans are market driven. Fund managers may try (but are not obliged) to give you a regular monthly income. 

 Monthly income plans of mutual funds are debt-oriented schemes with a small equity component, generally up to 20 per cent. These plans ruled the roost between 2000 and 2003. This was powered by incessant interest rate cuts and a falling inflation rate during this period, which gave rise to a buoyant bond market. 

Times are changing

 After a three-year slumber, the equity market has woken up and started offering stellar returns. With the interest and the inflation rates firming up, the return on bonds and debt securities started to fall and fund managers found it hard to keep their monthly dividend payment promises. Most skipped them, resulting in a widespread complaint by investors about the poor performance of their MIP investments. 

 With market conditions becoming non-conducive for a pre-dominantly debt product, fund managers started to pepper their monthly income plans with equity elements. 

Other indicators

 But there are some indications now that both domestic and global interest rates have reached a plateau and could be heading downhill once again. The inflation rate has also started softening with a decline in global crude oil prices. In fact, the signs of a mild slowdown have emerged in some advanced economies.

 Economic growth in the country is likely to remain buoyant for sometime now and this is presaged by the robust 8.9 per cent growth in GDP in the first quarter (April to June). With the possible onset of a soft interest regime, we have a situation where the MIPs could once again become the flavour of the day.

A caveat

 However, the interest rate may not start coming down soon. The Reserve Bank of India is expected to hold off on the rate increase when it announces the mid-term monetary policy review on October 31, but it may not reduce the rates. Some quarters also believe that the RBI may again raise the rates in January next year.

 However, the growth in non-food credit, which the RBI wanted to restrict below 20 per cent with the rate rise, has slowed down to 15 per cent during the last two months. 

 The yield on 10-year government securities, an indicator to long-term interest rate movement, has also come down to 7.6 per cent from 8.3 per cent at the beginning of this fiscal. But the yield on short-term government papers has not come down. This indicates that the interest rate is unlikely to come down in the near term.

 The domestic interest rate in the long run is likely to come down with increased alignment of the Indian economy with global ones where the average interest rate is far below the domestic rate. However, investors must consider the nuances of investing in MIPs despite the advantages. Investors must bear in mind that MIPs dont offer assured returns. Quarterly or a half-yearly income plan is a better option than monthly income for an investor in MIP because these options assure a consistent dividend payout that may not be possible on a month-on-month basis.

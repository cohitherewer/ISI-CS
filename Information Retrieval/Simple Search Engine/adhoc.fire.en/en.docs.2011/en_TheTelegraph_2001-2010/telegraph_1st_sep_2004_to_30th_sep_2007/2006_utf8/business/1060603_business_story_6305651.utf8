 Heavyweights in pullback act

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, June 2: Investors, who were fretting over the recent erosion in stock values, heaved a sigh of relief on Friday as key frontliners led a strong pullback. Buoyed by a recovery in global commodities and overseas indices, coupled with short covering, the benchmark BSE index surged 380 points, the highest rise in over 15 years.

 After losing 782 points since Tuesday, the index shot up to 10,451.33, recording the second highest single-day increase after the 422-point rise on March 24, 1992.

 However, not withstanding the sharp pullback, the markets are not out of the woods as yet. This is evident from the pattern of the turnaround seen today, which indicated that the rise was not broadbased. Brokers said the surge was entirely contributed by bluechip shares and most of the mid-cap or small cap shares continued to reel under losses. This has raised a question as to whether Fridays rise is only a one-off event.

 Analysts feel though a clear picture will emerge next week when the government is expected to take a decision on fuel prices, there are concerns over rising inflation coupled with the possibility of higher interest rates. An added worry is the recent trend of massive sales by foreign institutional investors (FIIs). 

 These anxieties were, however, not seen today. After opening higher at 10104.57, the gap continued to widen as the 30-share sensex hit an intra-day high of 10477.35. It later finished at 10451.33, a rise of 379.91 points or 3.77 per cent over the last close.

 The rally was supported by sharp gains in auto and metal majors and index heavyweights like ONGC and Reliance Industries Ltd. The metal index, which suffered the most in the last few trading sessions, recovered to end notably higher by 389.39 points at 8572.86 followed by the BSE auto index by 192.61 at 4773.74.

 Brokers said metal shares were sought for as commodity prices showed some signs of improvement. It came after steel companies announced price increases for the month. Auto shares also ended in the positive territory, encouraged by better sales numbers by most of the companies.

 However, selling pressure continued to haunt mid-cap and small-cap shares as buying activity was confined to bluechip counters. Both BSE mid-cap and small-cap indices closed deep in the red.

 Skys the limit

 Mumbai, Aug 14: DHL Express (Singapore) Pte Ltd is planning to acquire the outstanding shares of Blue Dart and delist the company.

 DHL has 81.03 per cent in Blue Dart Express. Institutional investors hold 11.55 per cent, private corporate bodies 2.27 per cent and the Indian public 4.90 per cent. 

 Blue Dart Express today informed the stock exchanges that it has received a notice from DHL Express (Singapore) Pte Ltd to purchase its outstanding publicly held shares and delist the company under Securities and Exchange Board of India (Delisting of Securities) Guidelines, 2003. The board of Blue Dart will meet on August 17 to discuss the notice. 

 DHL acquired Blue Dart by buying out the 68 per cent share of the founders and Schroder Capital Partners for Rs 566.60 crore. They then made an open offer for 20 per cent of the shares of Blue Dart, offering to buy 47.5 lakh shares for Rs 350 a share. The formal announcement of the entire transaction was made in November, 2004.

 On the BSE today, the Blue Dart share ended at Rs 530.40 after opening at Rs 496 and rising to an intra-day high of Rs 544. The closing price is higher by almost 52 per cent over the earlier open offer price.

 DHLs plan to delist Blue Dart Express comes at a time when the domestic express courier industry is witnessing hectic action as the economy grows at a robust pace. Attracted by the prospects in India, global major TNT has arrived while other players are in a rush to acquire cargo liners to meet the demand rush.

 Recently, Blue Dart Express announced it has inducted two Boeing 757-200 freighters into its fleet. The aircraft were acquired on lease by Blue Dart Aviation which had an agreement with the company to utilise its aircraft for dedicated domestic air services.

 The 757s increased Blue Darts capacity from 166 tonnes to 250 tonnes per flight. 

 The route network was also extended to 60 with the addition of 21 new connections. 

 To strengthen the air infrastructure, the company also announced that the aviation hub at Ahmedabad and the Hyderabad outbound gateway will be upgraded.

 Fitch rating

 Fitch Ratings India has affirmed the best quality rating FI+(Ind) to the Rs 30-crore short-term commercial paper of Blue Dart Express Ltd.

 The rating factors in the healthy net cash accruals generated by the company in the last two years, leading to the reduction in debt and the consistent improvement in debt protection measures on December 31, 2005, Fitch said.

 The acquisition of a controlling 81.03 per cent stake by Deutsche Post AG through DHL Singapore Pte Ltd during 2004-05 is expected to provide Blue Dart with operational synergies, according to the rating agency.

 Tighter watch on data hubs

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 New Delhi, Dec. 1: The government will take a closer look at cyber security of financial markets and institutions in the country, especially in the wake of Al Qaeda threats to US financial data bases. 

 The US government has warned American private financial services on Thursday of an Al Qaeda call for a cyber attack against online stock trading and banking websites beginning Friday.

 The group aimed to penetrate and destroy the databases of US financial sites. Sources said the threat is believed to be from Anhiar al-Dollar.

 Though there is no immediate threat to Indian financial markets, sources said the government will be taking a cue from this threat and hasten work on a plan to tighten security at financial sites of national importance. 

 Gulshan Rai, director of Cert-in, the governments referral for cyber security, said the government was already working closely with the financial sector to implement best practices in cyber security.

 Officials said the Intelligence Bureau had some time back advised all government departments as well as institutions of national importance to shift to the Indian domain server which ends with .in to better protect them from cyber threats.

 However, many ministries and institutions, including stock exchanges, continue to use servers of the US or other countries. Rai explained that since it is an advisory, it is not mandatory for non-governmental bodies to accept it.

 The IB cyber security advisory is expected to be looked at more seriously now by many more departments. However, the Indian Internet set-up is electronically very close to the one in the US despite the physical distance and hence any major break-down of the US server system could have an impact on India. 

 The threat to US financial markets was posted yesterday on an Islamic-language jihadist website which was under surveillance by the US security officials. The site calls on Jihadis with computer skills to send viruses to financial markets and their users in the US via e-mail continuously for the next 30 days.

 The warning said the threat called for attacks in retaliation of the United States keeping terrorism suspects at the Guantanamo Bay naval base in Cuba. Earlier this year, terrorists hacked into scores of websites in Denmark, including Jyllands-Posten, the newspaper that published a cartoon defaming the prophet Mohammed. 

 India has been collaborating with the US on cyber security and has an organisation that coordinates among most government organisations, including that of the finance ministry, defence organisations and the Indian railways.

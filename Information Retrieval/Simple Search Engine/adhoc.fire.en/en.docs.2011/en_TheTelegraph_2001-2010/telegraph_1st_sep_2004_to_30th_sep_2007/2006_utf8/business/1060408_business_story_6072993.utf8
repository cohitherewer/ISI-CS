 Full float not before 2009

 New Delhi, April 7 (PTI): Finance minister P. Chidambaram has ruled out full convertibility of the rupee before 2009, saying revenue deficits would have to be wiped out first in the economy.

 I dont think in any event we will be ready until we can wipe out the revenue deficit and bring down the fiscal deficit to 3 per cent, which means, not earlier than 2009, he said in an interview to the Singapore daily, The Strait Times.

 The government had set targets in the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act to reduce revenue deficit by 0.5 per cent and fiscal deficit by 0.3 per cent of the GDP annually ? so that revenue deficit is wiped out and fiscal deficit is brought down to three per cent by 2009.

 Ahead of the RBIs credit policy on April 18, Chidambaram said he did not expect interest rates to rise and the central bank would take steps to inject more liquidity to ease the situation.

 I dont think interest rates should rise... We should expect an easing of liquidity situation, he said

 Asked about the booming stock market with the BSE sensex hitting the 11,000-mark, the minister said market regulator Sebi was a competent watchdog and I think it keeps a close eye on what is happening.

 The BSE sensex fell by 157 points today after rising by 863 points in one month to touch 11,746. It had increased by 77 per cent in one year. When asked if there was a bubble, Chidambaram said, Nothing has been brought to my notice so far.

 As long as there is no disorderly movement in the markets, I have to assume that investors, both buyers and sellers, know what they are doing, he said.

 He, however, cautioned investors to take informed decisions after a careful study. Anyone who does not have the aptitude or the ability to make a careful study should go through the mutual fund route, he said.

 About interest rates, Chidambaram said most of the corporate loans would continue to remain below the banks prime lending rates. There was no reason to believe that lending to the corporate sector or long-term investments will attract higher rates. He also said the liquidity has eased a bit in the last week. I am confident the RBI will take steps to inject greater liquidity.

 Calcutta, Jan. 10: Bank of Baroda will focus on mobilising more deposits from rural areas to keep its cost of deposits low. It will also continue with its focus on retail banking in the domestic market. 

 Rural and semi-urban areas are still largely untapped by banks. With nearly 1,200 rural branches and over 500 in semi-urban areas, we can garner low-cost deposits in an otherwise competitive market, said T.V. Lakshminarayanan, general manager of Bank of Baroda.

 The banks cost of deposits for the six months ended September 30, 2005 was marginally higher at 4.24 per cent compared with 4.23 per cent in 2004-05. This may go up as interest rates have started firming up with a number of banks already raising their deposit rates across all maturities by 0.25 per cent to 0.50 per cent.

 The bank is coming up with a follow-on issue of 7.1 crore shares from January 16. It will close on January 20. The bank aims to mop up around Rs 1,500 crore through the public offer, which means the price band for the issue could be Rs 220-230. 

 It will be a discount of 8-12 per cent to the banks current share price of Rs 250. If you look at the recent bank issues, the offer price band has generally been at a discount of 10-15 per cent. However, the price band for the BoB issue will be announced on January 14, said Siddharth Shah of Enam Financial Consultants, which is one of the eight lead managers for the book-built issue.

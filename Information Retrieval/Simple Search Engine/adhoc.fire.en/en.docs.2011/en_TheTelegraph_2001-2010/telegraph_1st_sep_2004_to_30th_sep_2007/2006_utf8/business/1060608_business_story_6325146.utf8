 Bear hug delays PSU offers

 New Delhi, June 7: The government, which was planning to flood the market with several initial public offerings (IPOs), now wants to delay them to tide over the bear phase on the bourses.

 Large IPOs of Indian Airlines, Air-India, State Bank of Hyderabad and Rural Electrification Corporation will be pushed to the third and fourth quarters of this fiscal when the markets are expected to look up considerably.

 The Power Finance Corporation issue, however, will hit the market in July since a draft prospectus has already been filed with Sebi. The government will put 15.45 crore shares on offer to garner between Rs 1,000 crore and Rs 1,400 crore. By July, many analysts expect the market to stabilise as the impact of a rate hike by the US Federal Bank would have been factored in by then.

 The finance ministry has been insisting on working out the schedules in such a way so that there is a sufficient gap between big PSU offerings to curb volatility on the bourses.

 According to ministry officials, the problem of volatility stems from sudden shift of resources by financial institutions, FIIs and high networth individuals.

 While the market movement is towards profit booking now, ?it has been noted over the years that FIs and FIIs shift from previous holdings towards new bluechip issues whenever they arrive?. This in turn can create a financial vacuum, causing stock prices to dip further.

 The finance ministry and Sebi officials have been studying the volatility on the bourses over the last few weeks. The government also wants to avoid overcrowding of PSU issues as that would have an adverse effect.

 Finance ministry officials fear that the message to state-run FIs to shore up PSU issues could result in a selloff in other stocks in their portfolio, causing a free fall as happened when the previous BJP government came out with oil PSU offerings.

 The government-run companies are expected to garner around Rs 5,000 to 6,000 crore through their offerings this year. ?Space out issues, especially the big ones,? officials said. 

 Most PSU issues have a price-earnings ratio of less than 10. This is considered conservative by global standards where P-E ratios of up to 17 are allowed. Both FIIs and retail investors will scramble to grab a pie of the bluechip firms whose shares would be on offer.

 Finance minister P. Chiadambarams mandarins say if retail investors become stakeholders in PSUs, it will become politically difficult for any party to stop PSU IPOs ?for the public offerings would create their own electorate as UTI had done some years back?.

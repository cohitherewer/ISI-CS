 Thomas Cook, Godrej to split shares 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, April 26: With the equity markets on a boil, corporate India has started to split the face value of its shares to increase liquidity and attract more retail investors. 

 Two companies ? Thomas Cook India and Godrej Consumer Products ? today announced plans to split the face value of their shares.

 Godrej Consumer has decided to sub-divide the face value of its share to Re 1 from Rs 4 per share. Thomas Cook informed the bourses that its board will meet on Thursday to consider a 10:1 split.

 Theres a strong buzz in the market that Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) may also go in for a stock split and a bonus, but this has been denied by the company.

 A stock split certainly appeals to the retail investor since he can obtain shares at a lower value. The interest of this class of investors generally tends to rise after a stock split, says an analyst.

 Past experiences show that after a sub-division, total volume of its shares traded on the bourses have shown a dramatic increase. More companies are now planning to split the face value of their shares to improve liquidity in a bull market. Earlier this year, the board of Siemens approved a proposal to spilt the face value of the shares of Rs 10 each into five of Rs 2 each.

 There are others as well. Last year, ITC Ltd sub-divided its equity shares in 1:10 ratio. In 2005, Ranbaxy also brought down the face value of its share to Rs 5 from Rs 10 apiece. Others who have adopted similar moves include Hindalco, construction firm IVRCL Infrastructure amp; Projects Ltd, Shasun Chemicals amp; Drugs and Kirloskar Oil Engines.

 The enhanced investor interest in shares whose face value have been split, can be seen in the case of Hindalco where the average daily volume prior to this announcement was around 70,000 shares. This has now shot up to over one lakh shares. Besides, its share price has also witnessed sharp movement.

 Likewise, shares of ITC which closed at Rs 1546.15 when the announcement was done, is now ruling higher (pro rata after the stock split) at Rs 201.40.

 Share price of Godrej Consumer which ended at Rs 725.80 on the day when the announcement was made, today ended higher at Rs 732.70 on the BSE. 

 For instance, on July 7, when the A V Birla group company announced the decision, Hindalco shares closed at Rs 1211.25. The shares are now ruling higher at Rs 214.40, though the climb can also be partly attributed to the massive surge in stock values in recent times.

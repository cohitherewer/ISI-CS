The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 City gas distribution norms this month

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Deora: On target

 Mumbai, Oct. 16: The ministry of petroleum and natural gas will come out with guidelines for city gas distribution projects by the end of this month. 

 The norms will see the establishment of a downstream regulator even as it will allow the sharing of infrastructure after a period of time.

 Close to Rs 10,000 crore of investment has been lined up in the Eleventh Plan for city gas distribution and the ministry is keen to see the participation of players from both public and private sectors in this field considering the huge level of resources required.

 Speaking to reporters after meeting key industry players ahead of finalising the policy, petroleum minister Murli Deora said the government was keen to see more cities brought within the purview of city gas distribution. 

 Ajay Tyagi, joint secretary, added that the ministry has set out a target of 25 to 30 cities getting this facility over the next three to four years. Some of the cities that have been identified include Hyderabad, Bangalore, Lucknow, Agra, and Vijayawada. Tyagi later told the The Telegraph that though Calcutta has also been identified, gas is likely to be available only by 2009-10. 

 He revealed that majors like Shell, British Petroleum, British Gas, Reliance , Reliance-Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group, GAIL and many others have evinced interest in city gas distribution throughout the country.

 Petroleum secretary M.S. Srinivasan said natural gas availability in the country was likely to increase considerably over the next four years due to a successful exploration policy. 

 While around 100 million cubic metres of natural gas will be added, the government is of the view that maximum number of households should derive benefit of this increase and at least 20 cities should convert to compressed natural gas. 

 The plan is to get 10 per cent of the population covered by these projects. Since this will require a huge level of investment, the government is keen to rope in the private sector. 

 But this has raised a crucial question: should one company be allowed to share the infrastructure set up by another? The debate is still open with those proposing to establish pipeline infrastructure reluctant to let another player use it.

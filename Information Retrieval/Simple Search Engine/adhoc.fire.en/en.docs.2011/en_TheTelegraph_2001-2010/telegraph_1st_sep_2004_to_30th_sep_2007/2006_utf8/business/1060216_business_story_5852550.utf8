 GE clings to banking hopes

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Feb.15: Global consumer finance giant General Electric (GE) is keen on setting up banking operations in India. One of its overseas units may seek a banking licence here in the next few months, though the company is evaluating other options.

 Vishal Pandit, president and CEO (India Region) of GE Money, gave a hint in this regard to reporters here today. 

 GE Money is the new global umbrella brand for the companys all consumer financial services. GE also has joint ventures with State Bank of India and Maruti Udyog Ltd in the country.

 GE has identified four developing countries as its focus markets and India is one of them, said Pandit. It is also carrying out a feasibility study on its foray into banking in the country, he added. 

 Pandit, however, quickly added that GE has not yet zeroed in on any specific route pending a detailed study on the implications of tax and regulatory issues.

 GE is also contemplating to acquire a stake in a weak bank, according to GE Money country head. 

 But under the current regulatory provisions of the Reserve Bank, foreign entities can start retail banking operations in India either by setting up a subsidiary or a branch here.

 Leela keeps Dubai on menu

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Feb. 8: LeelaVenture Ltd is open to exploring business opportunities in Dubai. We do not have any plans as of now, but Dubai makes a lot of sense for us if we are looking at the international market. London is another important destination for hoteliers, Leela Kempinski president Peter Leitgeb told The Telegraph. 

 Right now, we are more into the domestic market as we are looking at adding five properties in Delhi, Udaipur, Chennai, Pune and Hyderabad soon. Together all these properties will take our inventory up almost 126 per cent, he added. The Pune plot has already been finalised and the total expenditure on the development of the hotel will be close to Rs 220 crore.

 While the Chennai and Pune businesses will be owned by the group, the Delhi operations will be on a contractual basis. The Delhi operations will come under amp;M, that is, operated and managed by us, but we dont own the property, Leitgeb added.

 Under an amp;M plan, Leela will have a 10-year contract with the owner of the hotel, wherein it will operate and manage the hotel for a fee. The fee depends on a case-to-case basis, Leitgeb said. Leela has signed an amp;M pact with Ambience Infrastructure to manage a 319-room hotel at Gurgaon near Delhi.

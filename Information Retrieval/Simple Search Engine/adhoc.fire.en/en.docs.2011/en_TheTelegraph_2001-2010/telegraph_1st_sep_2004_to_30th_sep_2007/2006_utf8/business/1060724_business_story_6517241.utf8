 Steel giant boss for a fix on input woes

 Muthuraman: Cautious

 New Delhi, July 23: Indias natural resources like iron ore and coal should be used by the local industry, Tata Steel chief B. Muthuraman told a CII meeting recently.

 None of the capacities announced will take off due to the lack of availability of land. Creation of steel capacity in India is not matching the proposed demand. Imports are already shooting up and three years from now we will get into serious problems, he said.

 We need to earmark specific tracts of land near the coast or near the source of raw materials as steel projects require large plots. Many states do not have rehabilitation policies, which are a hindrance towards land acquisition, Muthuraman said.

 Indian steel industry will lose the competitive edge unless captive raw material is provided. Our natural resources must be used for the development of our country first, he added.

 Industry captains have also asked the government to solve the water problems of the industry. Steel production is a water guzzler. Therefore, we need to have mega water projects, Muthuraman said.

 Industry chieftains feel improvement in infrastructure like proper roads, railways and ports will not only help India meet its domestic requirements but also help neighbouring countries like China and Vietnam. Steelmakers have also highlighted the need for right policies for environmental protection and development of sites.

 National Manufacturing Competitiveness Council chairman V. Krishnamurthy said, India has the capacity and the capability to become the global metals hub given an enabling environment.

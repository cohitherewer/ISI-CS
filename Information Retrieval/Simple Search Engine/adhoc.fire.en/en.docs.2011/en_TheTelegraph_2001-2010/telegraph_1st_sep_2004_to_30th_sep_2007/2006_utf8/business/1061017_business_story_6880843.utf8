The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Reward for cellular rural duty

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 16: The government will support the operations of private telecom companies towards provision of mobile services in villages, with the Union cabinet deciding today to amend the Indian Telegraph (Amendment) Ordinance 2006.

 The government will use the proceeds from the Universal Services Obligation (USO) fund, hitherto used to subsidise the operations of the state-run BSNL in rural regions, to support private cellular operators.

 The government will fund facilities such as mobile phone towers and electricity and allow up to three operators in each circle to use the infrastructure to service the villages. 

 The Cabinet decision today, an outcome of lobbying by the telecom companies, paves the way for the private sector to access the fund.

 The Indian Telegraph (Amendment) Ordinance 2006 will enable the Universal Services Obligation fund to extend financial support for provision of mobile services in rural and remote areas, said parliamentary affairs minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi.

 The government proposes to utilise the money from the corpus to build 10,000 base tower stations (BTS), or telecom towers, and provide passive infrastructure such as power supply and back-up systems for mobile and broadband services.

 A maximum of three telecom service providers will share individual BTS to extend mobile telephone and broadband services in areas currently not covered by operators, Das Munshi said. 

 Officials of the Department of Telecommunication (DoT) said a sum of Rs 4,000-5,000 crore would be allocated from the USO fund for setting up the passive infrastructure. This infrastructure could later be used to provide broadband services like internet and cable TV to village communities, the officials said. 

 Set up in 2002, the corpus of the fund is Rs 7,206 crore, built from contributions by telecom operators which have to statutorily provide 5 per cent of their revenue towards the fund. The cabinet will soon send the Indian Telegraph (Amendment) Ordinance 2006 to the President for his approval. 

 The decision to amend the ordinance follows unsatisfactory growth in teledensity the number of phones per 100 people from 7.08 per cent in 2004 to 13.54 per cent, despite the massive penetration of mobile phones in towns and cities.

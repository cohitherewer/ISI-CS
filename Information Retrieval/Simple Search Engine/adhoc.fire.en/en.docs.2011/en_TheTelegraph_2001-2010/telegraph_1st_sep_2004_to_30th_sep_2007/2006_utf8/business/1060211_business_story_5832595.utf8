 Snag in airport bid review

 Troubled turf

 New Delhi, Feb. 10: The inter-ministerial group (IMG) appointed to look into the bidding process for the modernisation of Delhi and Mumbai airports was never allowed to do an independent evaluation of the bids. 

 Official documents available with The Telegraph clearly show that instead of independently checking the bid documents, the IMG depended on reports to form its opinion.

 This was despite a plea by the Planning Commission, which wanted the bids that had been evaluated by the external consultants to the entire bidding process to be reviewed by the IMG. 

 From the beginning, the role of the external consultants was a source of controversy. The Left parties had repeatedly said the consultants suffered from conflict of interest as they had links with the Reliance group as well as the GMR group. 

 An official committee, set up to review the evaluation, recorded in its findings that the inter se marking across various bidders for the same criterion based on experience, expertise, and commitments could be different.

 Available official documents make it clear, as recorded by the review committee, ?No independent search of any kind has been undertaken to ascertain whether any document or information submitted by the bidders are authentic, truthful and reliable.?

 The consultants selected two airport consortia led by Reliance and GMR, respectively. In the case of the first it was alleged by many that its scores were high because of a subjective reading of the selection parameters. It was also said that Reliance?s partner, Mexican Airports Authority, was not rated very highly globally. 

 In the case of GMR, the civil aviation ministry, in a note to the empowered committee, found flaws in the way it had drawn up its proposal where it was developing the midfield area as restricted airside area with no landside access.

 The IMG, which reviewed the entire process, also pointed out that the cut-off marks of 80 per cent meant only one bidder qualified for either airport. It too expressed ?concern about the way marks were allotted and weightage given to different parameters?.

 To stem all controversies, the government had set up a committee headed by E. Sreedharan to review the scores awarded by the evaluation committee of consultants.

 But civil aviation ministry officials point out that its main recommendation ? to cut down time in developing the two gateway airports by getting AAI to do the work in partnership with foreign airport developers ? was conveniently forgotten. 

 The Sreedharan panel wanted the airports to be funded through a special purpose vehicle, which would raise funds to develop the two airports.

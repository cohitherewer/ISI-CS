 Lanka taste for hotels

 SOHINI MOOKHERJEA

 Calcutta, Nov. 29: The leisure division of Sri Lanka-based John Keells Holdings (JKH) plans to enter the Indian hospitality sector and invest $100 million in the next two years.

 The company specialises in beach properties and resorts and operates 2,400 rooms in Sri Lanka and Maldives. It also has interests in food and beverage, logistics, tea, IT, real estate and financial services.

 We are looking at entering the hospitality sector in India with two of our major brands Cinnamon, the five-star resort, and Chaaya, our four-star signature brand, said Ajit Gunewardene, deputy chairman of JKH.

 Over the next 18 months, the company would scout for partners to introduce the brands.

 JKH is open to upgrading existing properties with partners and brand them accordingly. The Sri-Lankan company would have management control in these properties.

 The company is also considering developing properties from scratch and is looking at locations like Goa and Kerala to match its expertise in beach properties and coastal and inland resorts.

 The company has one of the largest tea warehouses in Asia and considerable experience in plantation. It could, therefore, develop tea gardens as resorts in hilly areas.

 Another Sri Lankan player, Aitken Spence, has a management contract with the Delhi-based Anant Raj Industries for a property in Delhi.

 Spence has beach resorts in Sri Lanka. It has also converted a tea factory into a hotel in the island nation. It has properties in Maldives too.

 Sri Lankan Airlines has also increased its links with Indian cities, with tourism in India set to grow by 8.8 per cent per annum over the next decade, according to the World Travel and Tourism Council. Tourist arrivals in India were up by 13 per cent in the first nine months.

 Sri Lanka has been plagued with political and insurgency problems and the after-effects of tsunami. A large of chunk of revenues in the hospitality sector for Sri Lankan players is set to come from overseas if the local situation does not improve.

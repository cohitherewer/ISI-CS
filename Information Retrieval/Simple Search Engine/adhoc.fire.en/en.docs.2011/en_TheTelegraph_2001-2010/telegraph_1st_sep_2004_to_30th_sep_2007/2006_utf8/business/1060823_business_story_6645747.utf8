 Chief minister trio resents ore export 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Kumaraswamy, Bhattacharjee and Singh: United 

stand 

 New Delhi, Aug. 22: Chief ministers of three mineral-rich states Karnartaka, Chhattisgarh and Bengal have written to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh against the export of iron ore.

 Karnartakas H.D. Kumaraswamy, Chhattisgarhs Raman Singh and Bengals Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee have pointed out that a proposal to lift quantitative and qualitative restrictions on iron ore exports could spell disaster for the countrys fast growing steel industry.

 A high-level committee set up to review the National Mineral Policy and recommend possible amendments to the Mines and Minerals Development and Regulation (MMDR) Act, 1957, has proposed such a move.

 The chief ministers have also protested plans to let the central government intervene in mining lease allocations. They are also against a clause allowing allocation of huge areas to large companies without following a process of auction.

 In his letter, Bhattacharjee said, Removing all quantitative and qualitative restrictions will surely result in the export of our best quality ores, deplete our finite and meagre reserves at a much faster rate and starve the domestic industry of a raw material on which its very survival depends. This is most certainly not in our national interest.

 Domestic industry needs to be provided an assured supply of iron ore, especially when it is committing itself to accelerated development. The committees recommendations would not help this development, Bhattacharjees letter said.

 The high-level committee has, among other things, recommended that all quantitative and qualitative restrictions of iron ore be removed and it has favoured regulating ore export through fiscal measures. It has also said the government should have the right to directly consider applications for mines which are not disposed of by state governments within a specified time frame. 

 Global steel majors like Mittal Steel and Posco want both iron ore and captive coal mining to be opened up to 100 per cent FDI in India. 

 Domestic players like the Tatas and SAIL want exports of scarce resources like high- grade iron ore to be banned altogether. Their contention has always been that MNC steel mills and others are promising to set up plants here simply because they want to export some of the high-grade iron ore back home. 

 Cheap exports of high grade iron ore to Japan have long been a sore point with most steel-makers in India. Their point is that domestic steel industry is expanding and would need scarce high class ore which is a scarce resource the world over and this should be kept back. 

 Among the two most scarce resources 

 now being sought after in the global commodities market 

 are high grade iron ore and high class coal, needed to make 

 steel. India and Brazil are the only nations with such high 

 class iron ore with iron content of between 60-65 per cent.

 Petronet closer to Chevron deal

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, May 17: Petronet LNG Ltd has made a headway in its efforts to clinch a long-term deal for buying liquefied natural gas from Chevrons Gorgon project in Australia.

 We are progressing well and expect to sign the deal sometime in July, Petronet CEO and managing director P. Dasgupta told reporters during the India-US gas conference here today. 

 Petronet plans to buy 2.5 million tonnes of LNG annually from Chevron for 25 years. Supplies are expected to begin in 2009 and would be received at the new terminal being set up at Kochi in Kerala.

 The deal assumes importance as the LNG that Petrronet had earlier proposed to import from Qatar for the Kochi terminal has been diverted for the revival of the Dabhol power project in Maharashtra.

 This had raised fears that the Kochi terminal would be left in the lurch, although Petronet was making desperate attempts to source LNG from elsewhere to keep it going. 

 The deal with Chevron will reduce Indias dependence on the Gulf region. Also, Iran has been getting difficult in the wake of the nuclear stand off with the West. 

 Dasgupta said Petronet LNG would float a special purpose vehicle (SPV) to pick up equity in shipping vessels being built to carry LNG to its terminal at Dahej in Gujarat and Kochi. 

 Petronet will hold a 49 per cent stake through the SPV in the three new ships it has ordered to ferry additional 2.5 million tonnes of LNG expected from Qatar and an equal volume from Gorgon.

 He said the Dahej capacity would be doubled to 10 million tonnes per annum by 2008 and the Kochi terminal would come up in 2008-09.

 The company currently imports 5 million tonnes of LNG per annum from Qatar and an additional 2.5 million tonnes will come from 2008-09. The company is in talks for additional volumes.

 GAIL India Ltd also tied up for importing spot LNG cargo from Algeria at a cost of $9 per million British thermal units.

 The first cargo is arriving on May 19 at the Dahej terminal and two more cargoes are expected in June-July, GAIL chairman Proshanto Banerjee said. This is the first LNG cargo that the company has bought from the international spot market.

 Banerjee also said GAIL was planning to bid for 23 of the 55 oil and gas blocks on offer in Nelp-VI and was talking to prospective foreign partners.

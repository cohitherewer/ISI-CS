 Chargesheet filed on CSE scam

A STAFF REPORTER

AWAITING JUSTICE

 Calcutta, June 8: Former big bull Ketan Parekh and his associates will now face trial for their alleged role in the Rs 120-crore Calcutta Stock Exchange scam of 2001 following the chargesheet filed by the city police today.

 The trial will begin on June 12 against Parekh and 18 others who were chargesheeted at Bankshall Court after four years of investigation of the payment crisis that had rocked the countrys financial markets.

 Along with Parekh, three of his associates, Dinesh Singhania, Ashok Poddar and Harish Biani, DSQ Software promoter Dinesh Dalmiya, former CSE president Kamal Parekh, former CSE vice-president K.K. Daga and former MD of Stock Holding Corporation of India Ltd B.V. Goud have been named in the chargesheet.

 The accused were charged under sections 420 (cheating), 409 (criminal breach of trust), 467 (forgery of valuable security), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), 471 (using as genuine a forged document), 477a (falsification of accounts) and 120b (conspiracy) of the IPC.

 At present, 14 out of the 19 accused are under arrest.

 Investigators, however, did not mention the names of eight persons ? all employees of Calcutta Stock Exchange ? as sleuths failed to collect enough evidence against them.

 The scam came into light after Prasun Kumar Roy of Calcutta Stock Exchange Association lodged a complaint with Hare Street Police Station against three broker groups, Biani, Poddar and Singhania, and two individuals, Parekh and Dalmiya. 

 In his complaint, Roy said the accused had hatched a criminal conspiracy to cheat the stock exchange by not making payment in the Settlement Guarantee Fund.

 After investigation by the detective department, sleuths arrested both Parekh and Dalmiya. Later, Parekh was granted bail. Dalmiya has been remanded to judicial custody till June 12.

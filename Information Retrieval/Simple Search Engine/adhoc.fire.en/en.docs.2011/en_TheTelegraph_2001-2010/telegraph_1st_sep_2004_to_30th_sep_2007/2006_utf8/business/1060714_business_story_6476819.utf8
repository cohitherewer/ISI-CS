 Price review on Qualcomm agenda

 New Delhi, July 13 (PTI): Faced with the possibility of losing market share, CDMA technology inventor Qualcomm is likely take up the issue of reducing the chipset price for the Indian market at its forthcoming board meeting on July 19. If the price is lowered, it will have a direct bearing on handset prices.

 The demand of Indian CDMA operators like Reliance Communications on royalty reduction may not have been picked during Qualcomm CEO Paul Jacobs visit to India last month, but the San Deigo-based company is in regular touch with the operators for strategic discussions, according to a source.

 The CDMA technology licensors market capitalisation has been knocked down by $15 billion owing to several reasons like Nokias pull-out of the CDMA-based handset market and Reliance Communicationss planned expansion into GSM-based mobile services.

 Jacobs is believed to have favoured the chipset reduction model over the royalty cut, which he said has no scope for further reduction as it is already low. But he had not committed any timeframe for this.

 Indian CDMA operators have proposed to Qualcomm to bring down the chipset cost at least on a par with that of the GSM chipset. In a low-end handset priced at $40, the chipset for a CDMA phone is $10 while in a GSM model, it costs $5.

 This gap is leading an artificial increase of 12 per cent in the handset cost.

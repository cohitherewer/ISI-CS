 RIL rises before demerger dawn

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Jan. 17: Reliance Industries (RIL) will appear in a new avatar on the bourses tomorrow sans its interests in utility, telecom and financial services. 

 There will be a special pre-market session for the shares tomorrow. But before that, investors scrambled to buy the scrip today.

 The share hogged the limelight on an otherwise dull trading day today. Around 46 per cent of the turnover on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) cash segment was accounted for by Reliance alone. 

 Similarly, on the Bombay Stock Exchange, the Reliance share clocked a record turnover of Rs 1,437 crore in a single session and closed with hefty gains of Rs 55.05 or 6.30 per cent to close at Rs 928.15.

 Both the stock exchanges will hold a special trading session tomorrow from 8.00 am to 9.00 am where only Reliance shares will be traded. 

 This is the first time that shares of a single company will be traded in a special session ahead of the normal market hours. 

 There will be no circuit filter during the special trading session and the volume weighted average price of Reliance during the session shall be used for adjustment to the base market capitalisation of the respective indices. No index will be calculated during the special trading session.

 Analysts are of the opinion that the rump Reliance stock is likely to open anywhere in the range of Rs 650-725 in the pre-market session tomorrow. This marks a fall of around Rs 278 from its closing price on the BSE today. 

 If the Reliance scrip moves above Rs 725, it could face a selling pressure. Similarly, if the share price dips below Rs 650, investors would consider it a good opportunity to buy the share, an analyst with a local brokerage pointed out.

 Market pundits feel that the value of the rump Reliance stock will not have any effect on the share prices of other two entities from the Anil Ambani group, which includes Reliance Energy and Reliance Capital.

 However, an investor holding Reliance shares is likely to receive stocks of the demerged undertakings 15 days after the record date. Reliance, it may be recalled, has fixed January 25, 2006 as the record date for the demerger.

 Under Reliances demerger scheme, four entities will be demerged from Reliance Industries. These include telecommunications, coal-based energy, financial services and gas-based energy businesses. 

 While Reliance has fixed January 25 as the record date for the scheme, both the BSE and the NSE have fixed January 18-24 as the no-delivery period.

 Wednesdays session is significant as Reliance has a huge influence on key indices. It has a weightage of 10 per cent in NSEs nifty and 12 per cent in the 30-share BSE sensex.

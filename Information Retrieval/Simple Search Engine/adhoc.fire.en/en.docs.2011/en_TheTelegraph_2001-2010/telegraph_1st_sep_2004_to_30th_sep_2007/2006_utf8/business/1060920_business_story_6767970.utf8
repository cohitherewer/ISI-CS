 Cabinet note on airlines merger in Nov

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 19: The civil aviation ministry plans to prepare a note for the cabinet on the merger of the state carriers Air-India and Indian Airlines in November.

 The ministry expects consultancy firm Accenture to finalise its recommendations on the merger by that time.

 Everything is going on as planned. There are no impediments to the process, aviation minister Praful Patel said.

 He said Accenture, which is preparing the blueprint for the merger, would submit its report in October.

 Sources said Accenture is considering the implications of the merger for the staff of the two airlines and on the operations and infrastructure of the carriers. 

 The consultant would also have to decide on the future of the two subsidiaries of the two airlines, Alliance Air and Air-India Express.

 We hope the cabinet note on the matter to be ready by November after we receive Accentures report, Patel said.

 He said the merger process was on track and would be completed by the end of the current fiscal. 

 The merger will spawn a giant with a fleet strength of 130 capable of challenging aviation majors such as Singapore Airlines, Emirates and British Airways.

 The aviation sector has seen some mega mergers in the past few years such as between KLM and Air France and Lufthansa and Swiss Air.

 The first mega mergers in India, between Jet and Sahara, however, failed to take off, and the parties are now battling in the courts.

 Meanwhile, official figures released recently show state-run Indian Airlines increased its market share to 22.6 per cent in August this year from 20.5 per cent in August 2005.

 However, private airlines like Jet Airways, Air Deccan and SpiceJet showed a decline in market share. The market share of Jet was down from 31.7 per cent last year to 31.1 per cent. Air Deccans share fell from 20.2 per cent last year to 18.3 per cent and SpiceJets from 7.5 per cent to 6.3 per cent.

 However, Air Saharas market share rose from 8.4 per cent to 8.8 per cent this August and Kingfishers from 8.2 per cent to 8.7 per cent. New start-ups like GoAir and Paramount ate into the market shares of major private sector players, analysts said.

 The total number of passengers carried by all carriers on domestic flights in August was 25.38 lakh compared with 24.73 lakh flown during the same month last year.

 The largest number of passengers 7.91 lakh was carried by Jet Airways, followed by 5.74 lakh by Indian Airlines, 4.64 lakh by Air Deccan, 2.25 lakh by Air Sahara and 2.22 lakh by Kingfisher.

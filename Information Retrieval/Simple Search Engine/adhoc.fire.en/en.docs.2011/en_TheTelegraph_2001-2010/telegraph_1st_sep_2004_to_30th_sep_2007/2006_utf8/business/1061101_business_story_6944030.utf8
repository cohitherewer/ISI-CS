 Oct. 31: Tata Tea today announced the divestment of its North India Plantation Operations (Nipo), comprising estates in Assam and West Bengal, into a new entity with effect from April 1, 2007.

 Tata Tea managing director Percy Siganporia said in Mumbai that the new company will be formed on the basis of a transaction value of Rs 359 crore. 

 Tata Tea will hold a 20 per cent stake in the new entity where International Finance Corporation (IFC), Infrastructure Leasing amp; Finance Services (IL amp;FS), Globally Managed Services (GMS), corporate professionals and employees of all categories of Nipo will also have equity participation.

 GMS is a business consultancy company founded by Assam tea tourism and industry veteran Ranjit Barthakur and Dipak Kripalani in 2002. The company has offices in Singapore, Mumbai, Delhi and Guwahati.

 According to sources, GMS is set to hold around 10 per cent in the newly-formed company.

 The enterprise will not only concentrate on tea but will also diversify into other cash crops.

 According to Nipo vice-president Dipankar Borah, the name of the new entity is being finalised and will be announced after the completion of all financial transactions.

 Hailing it as a landmark move for the tea industry in India, Borah said the new restructured model allows the worker to participate as the owner. He said the divestment should have no adverse effect on the welfare of the employees and the interest of workers would be fully protected. 

 On the proposed equity participation, Borah said interest-free loans would be provided to the workers to repay it over a period of seven years. Each worker will contribute Rs 8,000 and each staff will contribute Rs 2 lakh.

 Tata Tea officials were supposed to meet trade unions of West Bengal tea gardens tomorrow to further discuss the divestment but the date has now been deferred. Two such meetings had been held with West Bengal trade unions before. The company had also held meeting with Assam unions.

 Second-quarter net

 Tata Tea today reported a profit after tax of Rs 163.92 crore for the quarter ended September 30 as against Rs 62.92 crore for the corresponding quarter last fiscal.

 Total income stood at Rs 322.78 crore for the second quarter in 2006-07, while for the same quarter a year-ago it was at Rs 279.57 crore. The group posted a consolidated net profit of Rs 194.08 crore during the second quarter.

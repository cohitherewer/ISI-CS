 Nike beats quarterly forecast

 Los Aangeles, Sept. 22 (Reuters): Nike, the worlds No. 1 sport shoe and apparel maker, on Thursday posted quarterly earnings above Wall Street targets, boosting its shares nearly 6 per cent and easing some fears that pricey styles bearing its signature swoosh were losing their luster. 

 Although stock-based compensation and marketing spending crimped results, chief executive Mark Parker dispelled Wall Street speculation that US consumers were moving away from pricey styles by Nike, which has seen slower sales of such footwear in parts of Europe and Japan. 

 Were seeing performance and even sport culture product at those higher price points actually selling through quite well, Parker said during a conference call with analysts. 

 McAdams Wright Ragen analyst Sara Hasan said Parkers statement was a relief to Wall Street. 

 There was a lot of worry that the marquee product wasnt as popular and trendy. They put aside some of those concerns for investors (by saying) that the Nike brand is still strong at the high end, Hasan said.

 Opec may cut output 

 Riyadh, Nov. 25 (Reuters): Saudi oil minister Ali al-Naimi today said Opec would cut oil production again when it meets in December if recent supply curbs failed to balance the market. 

 Opec decided in October to cut output by 1.2 million barrels per day from November 1 to respond to a 25 per cent slump in oil prices.

 We must look at the impact of the measures decided in Doha. If they are adequate, we will be satisfied, if they are not we will act again. The aim is to bring stability back to the market, Naimi said.

 The (oil) price is not an indicator, the indicator is stockpiles and the excess of supply over demand, he said.

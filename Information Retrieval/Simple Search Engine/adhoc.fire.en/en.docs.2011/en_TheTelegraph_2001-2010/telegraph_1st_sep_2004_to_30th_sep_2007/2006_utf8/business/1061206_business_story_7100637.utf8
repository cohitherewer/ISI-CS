 Ruias up stake in Essar Oil

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Dec. 5: The Ruias of the Essar group have marginally raised their stake in Essar Oil Ltd. Entities controlled by the promoter group have subscribed to global depository shares (GDS) of the company, thereby leading to a marginal hike in their holding.

 Essar Oil today informed the bourses that Essar Energy Holding, along with 16 other persons acting in concert (PACs), subscribed to 365,708 GDA representing 5,59,53,324 shares. While their holding before this acquisition was 46,330,035 shares, representing 4.28 per cent, the acquisition done on December 2, resulted in their stake rising to 8.98 per cent.

 The PACs included Essar Investments, Teletech Investments (India), Essar Shipping, Vadinar Oil, Essar Steel Holding, Essar Global and Essar Logistics Holding among nine others.

 Shareholding data available from the stock exchanges for the period ended September 30, showed the promoters holding in Essar Oil was 20 per cent. However, when contacted, officials from the Essar group said the subscription to GDS is part of the corporate debt restructuring (CDR) programme and that the conversion of GDS into shares will only raise the promoters stake in Essar Oil marginally by 0.8 per cent.

 For the period ended September 30, while the total public shareholding in Essar Oil was put at 12.66 per cent, 67.22 per cent were held in the form of depository receipts. It may be recalled that Vadinar Oil had, on an earlier occasion, acquired 4,761,000 GDS representing 728,433,000 equity shares aggregating to 67.22 per cent of the total paid-up capital of Essar Oil.

 It is now being speculated that the Ruias may also move to delist Essar Oil over the next few months. This comes after Essar Shipping and Logistics Ltd (ESLL), a Cyprus-based subsidiary of Essar Global Ltd (EGL), sought delisting of Essar Shipping citing greater efficiencies.

 In August this year, the Essar group had announced the formation of ESLL, which will hold stakes in Essar Shipping Ltd (ESL), Essar Logitics Ltd (ELL) and Vadinar Oil Terminal Ltd (VOTL). ESLL is a fully-owned subsidiary of EGL which is the Ruias prime investment arm having interests in infrastructure, telecommunication and industrial construction. Essar Globals investments also include that in Essar Steel and Essar Oil.

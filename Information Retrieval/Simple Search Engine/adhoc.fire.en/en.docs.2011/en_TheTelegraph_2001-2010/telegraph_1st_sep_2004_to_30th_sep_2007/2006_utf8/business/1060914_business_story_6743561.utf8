 Three suitors queue up for StanChart MF

 CHANDRALEKHA TULAL

 Money game

 Mumbai, Sept. 13: The race to acquire the assets of Standard Chartered Mutual Fund has become intense with three big names emerging as the frontrunners: Reliance Mutual Fund, Morgan Stanley Mutual Fund and Lotus India Mutual Fund. 

 The three players have devised their own strategies to close the deal, but the biggest hurdle is proving to be the high valuation that Standard Chartered has put on its assets.

 The deal has big implications for all three bidders. In the case of Reliance Mutual Fund, the addition of over Rs 15,500 crore of assets of StanChart Mutual Fund to its existing asset size of Rs 28,753 crore will make it the largest mutual fund house in the country. At present, it is ranked third in assets under management after UTI Mutual Fund with Rs 35,027 crore and Prudential ICICI Mutual Fund with Rs 34,119 crore. 

 In the case of Morgan Stanley, it will mark its return to the mutual fund business in India after a hiatus of 12 years. 

 The Wall Street firm is already adding staff in preparation for its new operations. Narayan Ramachandran, currently head of global emerging markets for the company, has been tapped to head Morgan Stanley Investment Management in India. 

 Morgan Stanley launched its first mutual fund in India in 1994, but it struggled early to keep up with market indices. Since that launch, Morgan Stanley has refrained from opening a new fund. It now has the closed-end Morgan Stanley Growth Fund with an asset size of Rs 2,688 crore. 

 For Lotus India Mutual Fund, the joint venture between Temasek and Sabre Capital, the acquisition might just prove to be the end of the jinx which seems to have plagued the fund house. 

 The fund house had to wait forever for the green signal from Sebi. Recently, it suffered a setback with its star chief investment officer for equities, Sandip Sabharwal, getting embroiled in an investment scam and putting in his papers. Rumours has it that the fund house has since approached three candidates, but none are willing to join. 

 However, industry insiders say StanChart has not been able to finalise the sale because of its insistence on a high valuation. It is expecting a valuation like those received by Chola and Sundaram Mutual for their respective deals with DBS and BNP Paribas, said an industry source. 

StanChart has most of its assets in liquid debt schemes, 

which do not have any income and are not even loyal assets. Chola and Sundaram 

had managed to hang on to their south Indian investors. Equity constitutes less 

than 20 per cent of StanCharts total assets and thus the maximum sale price should 

be Rs 400 crore. They are demanding Rs 700 crore, which is way too expensive, 

he added.

 SPS budget hotels at industry hot spots

 SOHINI MOOKHERJEA

 Calcutta, Nov. 11: Travelling to far-flung areas like Jharsuguda, Paradip or Dhamra port on business or leisure and wondering where to stay? Do not worry. 

 The Rs 400-crore SPS Group is planning to set up business and budget hotels in emerging industrial areas in Jharkhand, Orissa and the industrial belt of Durgapur in Bengal.

 We have been advised by our consultants to look at areas like Jharsuguda, Dhamra, Paradip and other such locations which will witness tremendous industrial activity in future. 

 We are trying to expand our hospitality business but instead of choosing already congested metros and second tier cities, we will look at off-beat locations that provide a steady stream of clients, said Bipin Vohra, chairman and managing director of SPS Group.

 The company has recently acquired a hotel and lounge called The Loudon, former Hotel Rutt Deen. The company will hand over the mandate of managing the hotel to Fortune Park Hotels, an ITC group subsidiary. 

 Eventually, the company might bring its other hospitality ventures like the B.E.D. lounge under The Loudon brand.

 The company plans to take the upmarket chain to the other metros post 2007.

 The national foray of The Loudon would be spread across seven years and this would be the upmarket chain compared with the hotels we are planning in the industrial areas, said Vohra.

 Around Rs 45 crore is set to be invested in The Loudon.

 Vohra added that the companys lounge and dining facility called B.E.D (bar entertainment and dining) is also undergoing major renovations at an investment of Rs 15 crore. The B.E.D will now include 30 rooms in a motel style with a 24 hour coffee shop, lounge and banquet facilities spread across three floors on the 18-cottah plot. The facility was closed down in February 2006 due to parking problems.

 A revised plan, including permission for a basement car park for B.E.D and reconstruction of The Loudon has been submitted to the municipal authorities.

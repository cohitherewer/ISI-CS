 Rinker rejects Cemex bid

 San Agustin: Cut short

 Sydney, Oct. 30 (Reuters): Australian building materials firm Rinker Group rejected a $12-billion takeover bid from cement maker Cemex as inadequate, and its stock soared as much as 29 per cent as investors bet on a higher offer. 

 Mexico-based Cemex, the worlds third-ranked cement maker with operations in 50 countries, offered $13 (A$17) cash per share on Friday in what would be the biggest takeover ever by a Mexican company.

 We think we are fully valuing what Rinker is worth, Juan Pablo San Agustin, Cemexs senior vice president of planning and finance told a conference call in Sydney on Monday, adding he didnt think there would be a rival bid. 

 Regarding intentions by other people to jump in, we dont think that will be the case, no, because we think our offer is fully attractive to Rinkers shareholders, he said. 

 Buying Rinker, which derives 80 per cent of its earnings from the United States, would solidify Cemexs dominance in the US market, open the door in Australia and give it a foothold in China, where Rinker has four plants. 

 Australian shares of Rinker, which had already jumped 6 per cent to A$14.70 on Friday, shot to a high of A$18.90 shortly after trade resumed on Monday. They were last trading at A$18.52, up 26 per cent. 

 The bid which represents a premium of 23 per cent to Rinkers closing price on Thursday comes as a slumping US housing sector slowed US economic growth to its weakest in over three years in the third quarter. 

 Rinker Chairman John Morschel said Cemexs proposed offer was opportunistic and materially undervalues the company. The board advised shareholders to take no action. 

 Analysts said Cemex, or perhaps other potential bidders such as larger rival global cement companies Lafarge and Holcim, or CRH Plc, would have to raise the offer to be successful.

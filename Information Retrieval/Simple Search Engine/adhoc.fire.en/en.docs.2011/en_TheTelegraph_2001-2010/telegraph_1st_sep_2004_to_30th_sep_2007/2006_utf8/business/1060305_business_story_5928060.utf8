 Tata-Birla spat gets new twist

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, March 4: The war of words between the Tatas and the Birlas over Idea Cellular has turned shriller.

 The Birlas have now fired a broadside terming the Tatas decision to terminate the shareholders agreement between them as illegal and malafide. 

 Last week, the Tatas had issued the termination notice and offered to buy out the Birlas 50.14 per cent stake in the countrys fifth largest telecom services provider.

 The Birlas also took pains to buttress their stand that the Tata Group was the promoter of Idea Cellular ? a view that Bombay House disputes.

 The Tatas have a 48.14 per cent in Idea with the stake held through Tata Industries Ltd (TIL) and AWA Mauritius. On the other hand, the Birlas have an interest in Idea Cellular through Aditya Birla Nuvo Ltd, Grasim Industries, Hindalco Industries and Birla TMT Holdings.Sources close to Bombay House said the Birla group has been referring to the Tata group as one of the promoters of Idea.

 There is no legal entity called the Tata group. It is only a nomenclature used, they added, while explaining that a group has not been given a licence. 

 The Tatas have on an earlier occasion also said that the reference to the Tata group is misconceived and ill conceivedas none of the licences given to Idea recognised the concept of any group. However, it is learnt that the department of telecom has been sent some documents, including the articles of association of Idea, which describes the founders as the AT amp;T Wireless group, the AV Birla group and the Tata group. These three groups were represented pursuant to section 4 of the shareholders agreement, through AT amp;T, Grasim and Tata Industries, the article of associations said. Although senior officials from AV Birla group, including Sanjeev Aga, declined to comment on the spat, sources observed that the termination notice issued by the Tatas was designed to divert the media attention.

 On February 27, Tata Industries Ltd (TIL), which is a shareholder of Idea Cellular, had served a notice on the Birlas which stated that the latter had breached the shareholders agreement by revealing confidential information of Idea Cellular at an analyst presentation held by Aditya Birla Nuvo Ltd (ABNL). It consequently gave the Birla group a timeframe of 90 days, following which they would proceed to buy out their partners stake in the joint venture at a default price.

 The Birlas have also termed as malafide and mischievous the Tata demand for the appointment of auditors to value the Birla groups holding in Idea as the first step to buying them out. 

 The group also said there was no breach of the shareholders agreement by ABNL while disclosing the information to its investors which had been provided by Idea itself.

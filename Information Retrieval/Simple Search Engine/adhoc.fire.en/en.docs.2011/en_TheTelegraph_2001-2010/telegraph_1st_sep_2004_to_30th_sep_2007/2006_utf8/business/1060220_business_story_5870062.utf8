 Strict vigil on Net services

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 19: The government has initiated a multi-pronged strategy to detect tax evasion by service providers such as online matrimonial and employment sites.

 Sources said certain instances have come to light where service providers are evading the tax by using Internet as a platform and positioning themselves as only ?online data access sites?. 

 ?Service tax is levied on the amount charged for providing access to information and providing information through the computer network. If a website is providing information about a matrimonial alliance or a job for some payment, it is taxable,? said an official in the revenue department.

 According to sources, services provided by Internet, which are not in the nature of ?on-line information and data access retrieval?, come under the service tax net. 

 ?Services provided by a stock-broker are taxable under the stock-broker services. Whether or not the service is provided through Internet, the commission would be subjected to service tax. Similarly, if any agency or firm is providing information for marriage alliances for a price, it would be subjected to service tax, irrespective of whether or not the same is rendered through Internet or otherwise,? sources said.

 Sources said certain web-based services provided by tour operators are also being monitored. Booking accommodation for travel purposes through Internet is subjected to service tax. Similarly, commission on bill payment, if rendered as a customer care service on behalf of the client, would fall under the business auxiliary service whether or not the same is rendered through Internet, sources added. 

 They said information on service providers is gathered from ?various sources? and surveys are being conducted to identify ?non-filers? and bring them within the tax net. 

 At present, 81 specified services are covered under the service tax net. The tax was first introduced in 1994 and the number of services brought under it has been increased in subsequent years. Economists, however, said the services sector, which contributes more than 50 per cent of the GDP, pays less than 10 per cent of the total collections from indirect taxes. 

 Sources said service providers are being ?persuaded? to register with the department and pay their dues. 

 ?The approach in service tax is based on a voluntary compliance from the assessees. Until a comprehensive goods and services tax is put in place, the government will continue to focus on voluntary compliance,? sources added.

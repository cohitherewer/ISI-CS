 Essar Steel net dips

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, July 10: Falling product prices and rising raw material costs forced Essar Steel to post a lower net profit in the fourth quarter of the fiscal ended March 31. Net profit declined to Rs 86.37 crore compared with Rs 272.78 crore during the same period last year.

 While the company posted a lower total income of Rs 1,690.71 crore in the fourth quarter against Rs 1,926.64 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year, its performance for the full fiscal was a shade better. The company reported a net profit of Rs 530.18 crore, down from Rs 590.15 crore in the previous year even as total income rose to Rs 6,390.72 crore compared with Rs 6,121.27 crore in year before, recording an increase of 4.4 per cent. 

 Company sources said it was able to withstand the pressures of depressed and fluctuating prices in domestic and international markets on the one hand and rising input costs of raw materials such as iron ore, energy, zinc and other vital inputs on the other. Prices during the quarter fell by $150 per tonne.

 The company merged Hy Grade Pellets Ltd and Steel Corporation Gujarat Ltd with itself. The 8-million-tonnes-per-annum iron ore beneficiation plant at Bailadilla, the 267 km slurry pipeline and the capacity doubling of the pellet plant at Visakhapatnam were also completed during the year.

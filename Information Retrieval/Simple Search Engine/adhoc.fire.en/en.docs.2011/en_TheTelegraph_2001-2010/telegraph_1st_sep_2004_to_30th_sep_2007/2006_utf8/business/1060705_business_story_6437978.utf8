 Tighter norms for farm forward trade

 New Delhi, July 4: The government plans to continue with forward trading in farm commodities, but apply more stringent norms to curb volatile speculation. 

 Left parties, which support the Congress-led Centre from outside, have demanded a ban on forward trading in foodgrain and pulses. However, the government feels it could sanitise the market from the extreme volatility seen in the last few months by simply introducing stricter norms for futures and options trading. 

 More stringent circuit filters and margins will be among the measures to control the swing in grains and pulses futures witnessed in recent weeks. 

 Grain futures have risen and fallen by hundreds of rupees in a day even as prices offered to farmers have remained static, fuelling suspicion that traders are manipulating prices at will.

 The speculation, according to many top officials, has been fed by allowing options trading without proper control. Options trading allows buyers the right to buy a certain commodity at a specified future date at a fixed price without the obligation to actually go ahead with the purchase. 

 Officials also pointed out that open interest trading, which is the number of total futures contracts that are not finalised on a given day, needs to be tightened up. This facility allows traders to play without actually putting sufficient money on the block. 

 The National Commodities Exchange, where screen-based futures trading in commodities is held, has about 500 members, who ? the officials said ? will be looking at how to regulate it better. 

 The government has to tread cautiously on the forward trading issue, as any misuse of the system can result in an upsurge of prices. 

 Bullion dealers and representative trade bodies, for instance, want the government to permit forward trading in gold and silver as well. Only spot trading is permitted under the law now, as both forward and futures trading are banned. 

 Both gold and silver come under the purview of Section 15 of the Forward Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1952, which prohibits forward trading. 

 The bullion traders claim the restriction on trade is not in tune with economic liberalisation and is leading to undesirable trading practices, such as illegal forward trading. 

 However, in the case of oil companies making overseas crude purchases, the government is not averse to allow forward trading. 

 Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd has already received RBIs approval for hedging risks in the international crude and petroleum products trade. 

 The company was among the first Indian oil companies to study risk management options, but is moving cautiously on the issue as it requires a lot of expertise. The company plans to begin forward trading soon.

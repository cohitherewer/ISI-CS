 Standard Life rejects merger offer

 London, April 18 (Reuters): Mutual insurer Standard Life has rejected an all-share merger proposal from an unidentified suitor, it said on Tuesday, as it vowed to press ahead with Britains biggest initial public offering for five years.

 Europes largest mutual insurer said it had received a number of approaches, including requests to take a significant shareholding in the business, but had turned these down as well.

 We assessed the approaches and believe they do not offer value to our members. Indeed they significantly undervalued Standard Life, CEO Sandy Crombie said in a conference call.

 He added there were no ongoing contacts with the potential suitors, whom he refused to name.

 Standard Life, set to become the fifth largest UK-listed life insurer, has been seen as a possible target for a takeover even before its expected market debut in July, though analysts have said that high valuations in a sector fizzing with merger speculation could dampen deals. 

 Its not surprising people are interested and looking at Standard Life, one British fund manager said. But it looked like an opportunistic move rather than anything else.

 Competition in UK life insurance market is cut-throat, with most of the main players reporting a decline in the profitability of new policies last year as they were forced to cut prices to maintain market share.

 Its symptomatic of the whole urge to consolidate in the UK life market; its an area where people are wracking their brains on how to make money, said one analyst at an investment bank who declined to be named. 

 Top five players

 The Edinburgh-based firm, detailing its 2005 results and demutualisation plans for the first time, said it aimed to raise ?1.1 billion ($1.9 billion) in its flotation, giving a potential market value of ?4.8 billion to ?5.5 billion. This was based on a likely price range of 240-290 pence, which advisers said would have been the range had the shares been traded on April 13. That market value would make Standard Life the fifth largest UK-listed life insurer, behind Aviva, Prudential, Old Mutual and Legal amp; General but ahead of former mutual Friends Provident.

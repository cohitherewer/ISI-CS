 Job loss in full-throttle Ford recast

 Detroit, Sept. 15 (Reuters): Ford Motor Company will cut annual costs by about $5 billion by the end of 2008 and reduce salaried staff by one-third, or 14,000 jobs, accelerating a restructuring plan. 

 Ford shares dropped 6.7 per cent in early electronic trading.

 The US-based automaker said its troubled North American auto operations will not be profitable on a full-year basis before 2009, a year later than first projected. 

 Ford will also suspend its quarterly dividend, further reduce production capacity, and revamp its vehicle line-up, an area of weakness widely cited by analysts.

 On September 5, Ford named Boeing executive Alan Mulally as chief executive, ending the troubled five-year stint of Bill Ford Jr as the operational head of the automaker founded by his great-grandfather.

 Several asset sales urged by analysts were notably missing from the Ford plan.

 The automaker also did not announce any plans to sell a stake in its Ford Credit arm, which has suffered higher borrowing costs after its debt rating was cut into junk territory.

 The company also did not announce plans to sell any of its automotive brands apart from the already announced intention of seeking a buyer for British sports car maker Aston Martin. The new restructuring, Fords third in five years, replaces the companys initial way forward plan, which was announced in January, and called for cutting up to 30,000 jobs and closing 14 plants by 2012.

 Following Fords $1.4 billion loss in the first half of the year amid declining sales of its high-margin pickup trucks and sports utility vehicles, the automaker promised a more aggressive restructuring.

 The company and the United Auto Workers union said on Thursday the automaker will offer buyout packages to all of its 75,000 US factory workers.

 Ford said the deal will accelerate by four years to 2008 its previously announced target of cutting up to 30,000 factory workers. It originally targeted the cuts by 2012. 

 In another reversal of recent forecasts, Ford said it expected its US market share to slide to a range of 14 per cent to 15 per cent from its current share of almost 17 per cent.

 Its prior assumption of stabilising its share as soon as this year had been viewed with deep scepticism by analysts, many of whom see the company losing share through the remainder of the decade.

 Theyve got to get profitable at 14 per cent market share so these cuts need to be ahead of the curve, said Erich Merkle, an analyst at IRN Inc. (Fords lowered market share forecast) gives me some confidence that theyre at least coming clean here.

 Underscoring the pressures it faces in markets other than North America, the automaker now expects full-year operating losses at its luxury unit Premier Automotive Group, and Asia, the fastest growing automotive market. 

 Ford said it will take a bigger charge for the revamped turnaround plan, pushing special items for 2006 significantly above the $3.8 billion originally forecast.

 Ford also plans to overhaul its F-150 pickup truck for sale in 2008. The last redesign of the F-150, Fords best-selling vehicle, was in 2004. 

 Ford will also introduce an all-new, seven-passenger vehicle based on its Fairlane concept that was shown at the 2005 Detroit auto show. 

 Ford shares fell to $8.48 in electronic trading from Thursdays close of $9.09 on the New York Stock Exchange.

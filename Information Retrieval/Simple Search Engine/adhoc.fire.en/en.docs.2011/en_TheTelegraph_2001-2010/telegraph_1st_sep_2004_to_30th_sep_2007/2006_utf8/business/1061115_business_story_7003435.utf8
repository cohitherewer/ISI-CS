 Bank advice for debt-hit

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Mumbai, Nov. 14: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) today asked banks to start credit counselling for individual borrowers who may not have the wherewithal to understand how deep they could slide into debt when seeking bank loans.

 The advice assumes significance after floating rate home loan borrowers found themselves staring at the prospect of being in debt for close to half a century on loans they took two years ago.

 In its Report on Trend and Progress of Banking in India 2005-06 that was released today, the central bank indicated that while some banks have already started counselling borrowers more should follow suit. 

 The RBIs advice comes at a time when retail credit has witnessed a strong growth. Retail advances of the banking system increased by 40.9 per cent to Rs 3,75,739 crore in 2005-06, which was significantly higher than the overall credit growth of 31 per cent. Auto loans experienced the highest growth followed by credit card receivables, other personal loans and housing finance.

 Bankers circles say that its not only in housing finance where counselling is required. With many individuals having rising outstandings on their credit cards, this is another area where attention is required. During 2005-06 outstanding credit card receivables jumped to Rs 12,434 crore (Rs 8,405 crore) while housing loans were placed at Rs 1,79,116 crore (Rs 1,34,276 crore).

 According to the RBI, as individuals may not be able to articulate their financial situation adequately to the banks and therefore it will be in the interest of banks themselves to help individual borrowers through appropriate credit counselling. However, RBI advised banks that such counselling will be appropriate only if it addresses unique situations of households in different parts of the country.

 In its report, the central bank also advised banks to actively go out and beef up their deposits since they have lost a lot of headroom that was afforded by the mountain of statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) securities they had acquired over the years. The SLR mountain has started diminishing and is down to 29.8 per cent of net demand and time liabilities (NDTL).

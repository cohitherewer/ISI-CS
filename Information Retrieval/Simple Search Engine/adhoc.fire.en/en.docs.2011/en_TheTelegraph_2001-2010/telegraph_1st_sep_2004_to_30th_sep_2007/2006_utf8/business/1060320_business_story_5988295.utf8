 More Indian firms in super growth club

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, March 19: For Cassandras who snort at the India growth story, here are a few numbers that will make you sit up ? more than a third of India Inc, or almost 34 per cent, have achieved a super growth status in the past year. 

 Not just that, India and Hong Kong could soon be challenging the US for the top slot in the number of super growth companies in the world.

 According to the Super Growth Index 2006, part of international management firm Grand Thorntons International Business Owners Survey, the US has topped the charts for the second year in a row. But this masks the fact that the number of super growth companies in the US has actually fallen from 48 per cent in 2005 to 39 per cent in 2006.

 While Hong Kong saw a steady increase from 12 per cent in 2004 to 28 per cent in 2005 and 34 per cent in 2006, India reported a rise from 21 per cent in 2004 and 2005 to 34 per cent in 2006.

 Others who posted a strong performance included Sweden with 31 per cent firms achieving the super growth status and 26 per cent in Ireland. In fact, Sweden climbed to the fourth position after falling to the tenth in 2004. The United Kingdom with 23 per cent and Canada with 23 per cent took the next two super growth rankings.

 But what exactly is a super growth company? The report says a company, which has grown considerably compared with average firms measured against key indicators, including turnover and employment, is called a super growth company.

 Also, super growth companies were far less constrained by the ability to finance the expansion of their business. For example, cost of finance was an issue for 50 per cent ordinary companies than super growth companies, as was shortage of working capital (47 per cent) and shortage of long-term finance (58 per cent), the report said. 

 The survey has established that super growth companies are 23 per cent far less likely to export than others.

 Sustained quarter-on-quarter growth of Indian companies has also boosted their position. 

 Italy, Russia and Turkey jointly shared the bottom position in the index.

 Wine tiff spills over into WTO

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Bitter taste

 New Delhi, Nov. 20: The European Union has approached the World Trade Organisation over Indias high customs duties on wines and spirits, taking the first step towards starting litigations at the dispute settlement body.

 The 25-nation trading bloc has requested the global trade body to start formal consultations with India. If the dispute is not resolved in consultations within 60 days, the EU may ask for setting up a WTO panel to rule on the legality of Indias import duties on alcohol.

 The decision comes just days after the visit of EU trade commissioner Peter Mandelson to New Delhi last week.

 The European decision follows an investigation carried out in the framework of EUs trade barrier regulation at the request of the European spirits and wine producing organisations. 

 The EU says five years of diplomatic efforts have failed to resolve the dispute and that its 10-month probe into the matter was marked by an unprecedented lack of cooperation from India. 

 However, the Indian stand is that it imposes the extra taxes because some EU governments forbid the import of Indian whisky. The two sides can only settle the dispute based on reciprocity, commerce minister Kamal Nath said. 

 The western countries should give due recognition to the whisky made in India, he added. 

 Drinks makers in the 25-nation EU aim for a stronger foothold in India, where spirits consumption has grown about 4 per cent a year since 2000. The smaller Indian wine market has expanded at faster rates of as much as 9 per cent a year. India bought more than 4 million euros of European wine in 2004, according to the EU. 

 Todays request for consultations is the first step in the WTOs dispute process. The two sides must negotiate for at least two months before the commission, the EUs executive arm, can ask the Geneva-based global arbiter to step in and begin work on a ruling. A legal decision, once that work starts, may take at least 18 months. 

 EU claims that India buys less than 1 per cent of its spirits from foreign suppliers, and imports about 15 per cent of the wine consumed in the country.

 Typhoo flavour to tea

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Dec. 18: Apeejay Tea Limited (ATL) and Empire amp;Singlo, the tea companies of the Apeejay Surrendra Group, are planning to introduce the UK-based Typhoo range of tea here. The Apeejay group acquired the Typhoo brand from Premier Foods Plc in 2005.

 The group has conducted an internal study on the potential of Typhoo products in India, which has a range of specialty tea. The results have been encouraging.

 The plans are still at the drawing board stage and would have to be decided by the Typhoo board. After the acquisition of Typhoo, it is only natural that we consider bringing the brand to India. But a timeframe is yet to be decided, said Deepak Atal, managing director, Apeejay Tea Group.

 The group will make a pan-India foray into packet tea with the Typhoo brand. It will then be competing in the high-value tea bag market.

 Atal expects the launch to take place by the end of the next fiscal. The group is also open to using the distribution arm of an existing company for the Typhoo range.

 Typhoo produces around 22 million kg annually.

 The group has its own brand Mahamantra, which is available in select markets of Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. A five kg packet of Mahamantra was launched a few months ago in Punjab, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh.

 The group now produces 19.5 million kg and plans to scale it up to 23 million kg by 2010.

 To reach this milestone, the group is replanting bushes and modernising its factories.

 We are replanting 3.5 per cent of the total area under Empire amp;Singlo and 1.75 per cent of the area under ATL per annum for the last three years. We are investing Rs 10 crore annually for the past three years to modernise our 14 factories, Atal said.

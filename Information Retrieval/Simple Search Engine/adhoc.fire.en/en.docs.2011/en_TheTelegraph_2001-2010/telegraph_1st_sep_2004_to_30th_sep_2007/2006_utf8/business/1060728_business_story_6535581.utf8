 State Bank spoils market mood

 OUR BUREAU

 July 27: The first-quarter numbers of State Bank of India disappointed markets today. Hit by low income from treasury operations, the countrys largest bank has reported a 35 per cent drop in net profit at Rs 798.57 crore against Rs 1,222.83 a year ago. Also, the employee costs had gone up during the period.

 The lower income from treasury operations impacted its net interest income, which fell 8.68 per cent to Rs 3,884.09 crore from Rs 4,253.24 crore in the first quarter of last year. This is despite a close to 38 per cent rise in interest income on advances. However, excluding this, the banks core operations grew 9.68 per cent.

 During the quarter, SBIs income on investments dipped to Rs 2,940.21 crore from Rs 3,760.98 crore in the same period last year.

Both gross NPAs and net NPAs ratio came down from 5.67 per cent and 2.44 per cent to 3.88 per cent and 1.69 per cent, respectively.

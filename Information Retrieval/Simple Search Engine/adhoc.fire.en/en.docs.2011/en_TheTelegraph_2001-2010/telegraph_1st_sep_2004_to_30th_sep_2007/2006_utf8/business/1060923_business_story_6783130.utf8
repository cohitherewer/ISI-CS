 Stock split, payout on Pantaloon agenda

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Sept. 22: Pantaloon Retail, promoted by Kishore Biyani, may soon consider a stock split. In a notice to the Bombay Stock Exchange today, the company said it would seek the approval of its board on September 30 for the stock split. The company is also considering a dividend. 

 In the meantime, the shareholders of the company at the EGM today approved the issue of securities worth Rs 260 crore to investors.

 The securities could be new shares or existing shares of the company or a rights issue; or convertible securities with or without detachable warrants; or convertible debentures. The prospective investors could be institutions, incorporated bodies or mutual funds. 

 The shareholders at the EGM also approved a preferential issue to the promoters in the form of 12,12,480 warrants with the option to acquire for every warrant an equity share of Rs 10 each at a price of Rs 1,635 per warrant aggregating to about Rs 198 crore.

 An analyst said the company was keen on a stock split to raise its floating stock which is low, possibly, due to the high FII holdings in the company. 

 The shares of Pantaloon closed today at Rs 1,843.30, 5.61 per cent higher than yesterday. 

 Last month, the company announced it would divest up to 24 per cent in its subsidiaries, such as Home Solutions, Central Mall and Future Media and Future Logistics, to raise up to Rs 500 crore.

 The market is abuzz with rumours that Biyani plans to hive off Central Mall as a separate company.

 Considering that the company has drawn up an ambitious expansion plan of close to 30 million sq feet by 2010, Pantaloon is expected to need close to Rs 3,600 crore, believe retail analyst.

 RCoVL mulls $500-m bonds issue

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, March 21: Reliance Communication Ventures Ltd (RCoVL), the Reliance-Anil Dhirubhai Ambani group company, is coming out with a $500-million foreign currency convertible bonds (FCCB) issue.

 The RCoVL board, which met today, has approved a proposal to raise long term resources up to $500 million by issue FCCBs in the international markets, sources close to RCoVL said, adding that the bonds would be issued at a premium to the market price of the shares of the company. 

 RCoVL, with which Reliance Infocomm Ltd will be merged soon, had earlier announced plans to raise funds from international markets to increase the ability to compete with peer group in the domestic and international markets. 

 After RcoVLs listing on the bourses, Reliance-ADAG group chairman Anil Ambani had announced an ambitious investment plan to be made over the next few years.

 In a notice sent to shareholders, RcoVL had indicated its intention of raising resources through an American depository receipt or global depository receipt. However, the company later clarified that these securities would be issued in such a way that it would not result in increasing the issued and outstanding shares by more than 25 per cent.

 RCoVL also sought shareholders nod to raise the limit of foreign institutional investment in the company to 74 per cent.

 In the past couple of years, many firms have chosen the FCCB route for raising resources as the interest rates in the country are on their way up.

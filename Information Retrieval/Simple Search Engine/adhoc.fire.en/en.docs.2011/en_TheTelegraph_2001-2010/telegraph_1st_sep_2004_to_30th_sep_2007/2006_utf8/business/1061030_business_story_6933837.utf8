 Corus staff role in Tata Steel

 London, Oct. 29 (PTI): Corus employees could have a greater say in the day-to-day management of the company if the Tata groups 5.1-billion bid for the Anglo-Dutch producer is successful, the managing director of Tata Steel has said. 

 B. Muthuraman said that the company is run in partnership with unions and employees in India and could do so in the UK.

 Each department has a joint council and the chairman is often from the unions, he told the Observer, adding Tata had not had an industrial dispute in its history, and was hoping to maintain good relations in the UK, if its bid succeeds. 

 There is speculation that a counter-offer could come from Brazilian group CSN, although interest from other companies, such as Russias Severstal and Germanys Thyssenkrupp, has cooled. 

 Tata is keen to emphasise its social credentials. Tata Sons, which owns 24 per cent of Tata Steel, is 66 per cent owned by a charitable trust.

New Delhi, Dec. 22: The ministry of heavy industries is looking at the joint venture route to revive the ailing Tyre Corporation of India. A few leading tyre manufacturers are ready to pick up stakes in the company.

 A senior official of the ministry of heavy industries told The Telegraph, Tyre Corporation supplies to several tyre manufacturers such as MRF and most of them are interested in taking over the management of the company.

 The Pawan Ruia group is also in touch with the Centre to take over the company. This competition would help the government get a better deal for the ailing tyre firm. 

 The tyre companies that outsource part of their production to Tyre Corporation include MRF, Apollo Tyres, JK Tyres, CEAT and Birla Tyres.

 The senior official said the ministry would be seeking parliamentary approval to convert the public sector company into a joint venture as it is not capable of a turnaround on its own. 

 The officer said, The ministry was tied down with the Cement Corporation of Indias proposal and has missed the winter session of Parliament for getting the Tyre Corporation case through, but we will catch the budget session (beginning February).

 As the public sector companies have been created by an act of Parliament, any change in their management has to be approved by Parliament. The Supreme Court had upheld this ruling during the NDA regime when Arun Shourie-led divestment ministry wanted to rush ahead with the privatisation of blue-chip oil companies.

 Tyre Corporation was incorporated in 1984 as a wholly owned central public sector enterprise to take over the responsibility of running two nationalised companies Incheck Tyres and National Rubber Manufacturing. 

 Subsequently, its tyre manufacturing unit at Kakinara in Bengal was modernised and it started commercial production in April 1994. 

 However, due to a shortage of working capital, the commercial operations could not be sustained. 

 The corporation had to stop production under its own brand name. It started making tyres for other reputed brand names.

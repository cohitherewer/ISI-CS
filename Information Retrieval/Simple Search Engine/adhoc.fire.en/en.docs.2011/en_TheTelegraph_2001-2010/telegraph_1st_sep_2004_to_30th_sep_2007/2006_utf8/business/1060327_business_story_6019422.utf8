 Q amp;A

 Tax token 

 I have a pension policy for which I pay an annual premium of Rs 24,000. According to the recent budget rules, shall I be eligible to claim deduction for the total amount or for Rs 10,000 only? 

 Nithish Kumar, Ranchi 

 According to the recent budget proposals, investment in pension policies up to Rs 1 lakh shall be eligible for deduction from the next financial year. However, for the current financial year, you will be entitled to claim a deduction of Rs 10,000 only. 

 Cash count

 I work in a private company and they pay part of my salary in cash. Will I be eligible for a home loan and will the portion received in cash be considered while deciding my loan eligibility? 

 Ramesh Singh, Calcutta 

 The loan eligibility norms for various banks depend on their internal credit assessment. You need to approach a bank to check your eligibility. Most finance companies do not consider any income by way of cash unless supporting documents for the same are produced. However, if the proof for cash income is produced by way of vouchers or a statement from the employer along with relevant entries in bank statements, it may consider part or full of such income.

 Reducing the burden

 I have taken a home loan of Rs 5,00,000, which has to be repaid in EMIs for 20 years. The nominee of my house and the loan is my wife and in my absence, she will be liable to repay the loan. Is there any policy, which will pay the outstanding loan amount directly to the bank and my wife is relieved from the burden? 

 Rajat Kanti Ojha, Midnapur 

 You can take a mortgage redemption policy offered by many insurance companies, which will repay all loans and debts in the event of the death of the insured. Nowadays, most banks and financial institutions have tied up with insurance companies to offer such bundled products. You can approach your bank to enquire for the same.

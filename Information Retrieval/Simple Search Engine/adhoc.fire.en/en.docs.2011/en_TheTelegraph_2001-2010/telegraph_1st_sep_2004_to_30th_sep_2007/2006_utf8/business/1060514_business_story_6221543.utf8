 Myanmar keeps gas deal open

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 13: Myanmar today indicated it had enough gas for both India and China.

 Myanmar ambassador to India U Kyi Thein said Myanmar had enough gas to sell to China and India and an MoU had already been signed with both the countries. 

 Talks are on with both the countries. We are still in the negotiation stage and have not finalised with either India or China, Thein said at a CII conference.

 Surely, we will sell gas to India, he said while replying to a query from an OVL official who suggested that gas should be exported to India for increasing bilateral trade.

 The gas would come to India through a land route bypassing Bangladesh and linking the Kaladan river in Myanmar directly to Mizoram, he said. 

 Although this is a much longer route, India has been forced to opt for it as Bangladesh had set preconditions, like access to Nepal through an Indian land corridor, to the laying of pipeline. It had also sought guaranteed offtake of more Bangladeshi goods by India to improve the trade balance between the two countries. 

 Myanmar has huge reserves of gas in its offshore A-1 field. ONGC Videsh and GAIL together hold a 30 per cent stake in the A-1 field, which is operated by Daewoo of South Korea. 

 Myanmar had been in discussion with both India and China to sell gas from the A-1 field. The adjoining A-3 block also has a huge potential. 

 However, the price of the gas is also a contentious issue. India has informed Myanmar that it is ready to buy natural gas from its offshore Shwe fields on a take or pay basis in an effort to offer them a better deal than the Chinese.

 Chinas entry into the picture has strengthened Myanmars bargaining power. 

 The take or pay clause that India is willing to include in the terms will give Myanmar guaranteed earnings for its gas every year even if India is not able to pick up the gas.

 Myanmar seems to be aiming at a better price for the gas through increased competition among buyers rather than shutting India out of the deal. 

 Since the gas fields are situated in the south of Myanmar they are more or less the same distance from India or China. As a result China does not have an edge over India to offer a better price due to a lower transport cost, the official said.

 The in-place reserves from the A-1 block in the Shwe field have been assessed by Houston-based consulting firm Ryder Scott at 2.88 trillion cubic feet to 3.56 trillion cubic feet. Commercial production from the field is expected to commence by 2009.

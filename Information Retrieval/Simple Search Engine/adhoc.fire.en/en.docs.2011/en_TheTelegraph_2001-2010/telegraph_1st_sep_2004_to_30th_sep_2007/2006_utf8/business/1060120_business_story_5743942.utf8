 The engineering and construction company has reported a 96 per cent jump in net profit at Rs 259.27 crore for the quarter ended December 31 compared with Rs 132.35 crore in the corresponding previous quarter.

 Total income increased to Rs 3782.79 crore during the period under review from Rs 3311.47 crore in the same period last year.

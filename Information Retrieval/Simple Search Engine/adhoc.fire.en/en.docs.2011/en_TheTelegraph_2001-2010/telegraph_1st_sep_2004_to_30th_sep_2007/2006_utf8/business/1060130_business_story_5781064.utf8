 REL bags highway projects

 New Delhi, Jan. 29 (PTI): Reliance Energy Limited (REL), an ADAE group company, has bagged Rs 488-crore worth projects for laying two stretches of highway in Tamil Nadu under the National Highway Development Project-II (NHDP-II).

 The project envisages building a stretch of 33 km of highway from Salem to Karur at an estimated cost of Rs 205 crore and another 53 km from Karur to Madurai at a cost of Rs 283 crore, sources said.

 Anil Ambani-owned Reliance Energy would be awarded two contracts, which will be executed on a build-operate-transfer basis in the north-south east-west corridor under NHDP-II, they added. The final agreement is likely to be inked by Reliance Energy director J.P. Chalasani and NHAI chairman Santosh Nautiyal here on Monday.

 Reliance Energy had bought bid documents in June 2004.

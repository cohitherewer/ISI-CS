 Tata Tea combined profit drops

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, 26 July: Tata Tea Limiteds consolidated profit after tax for the first quarter dropped to Rs 83.45 crore from Rs 88.33 crore for the quarter ended June 30, 2005.

 The dip in profit is because of higher exceptional income during the first quarter of 2005-06, which was tax exempt.

 The exceptional income included profit on sale of certain estates in south India (Rs 10.72 crore) and The Tetley Groups gains on account of the closure of its defined benefit scheme (Rs 15.24 crore).

 The first quarters exceptional items represent amortisation of amounts incurred on the employee separation scheme in Tata Tea and its subsidiary Tata Coffee Ltd.

 The total income for the group, however jumped by 12 per cent to Rs 806.37 crore from Rs 716.69 crore due to an increase in the branded tea sales at home and abroad.

 The companys UK subsidiary ? The Tetley Group ? has posted an 8 per cent higher turnover in the first quarter at Rs 498.51 crore while profit after tax was lower by 17 per cent at Rs 35.61 crore.

 However, standalone Tata Tea figures show a 3 per cent rise in profit after tax at Rs 44.56 crore, buoyed by improved brand profitability and plantation restructuring.

 Tata Coffee, a subsidiary of Tata Tea, had signed a definitive agreement to acquire Eight Clock Coffee Company of the US for $220 million to be funded through a combination of equity and non-recourse debt.

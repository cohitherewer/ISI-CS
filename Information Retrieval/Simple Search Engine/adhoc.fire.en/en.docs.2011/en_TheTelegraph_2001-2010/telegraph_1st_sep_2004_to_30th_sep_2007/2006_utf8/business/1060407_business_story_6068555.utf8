 RSP production touches all-time high

 PRABUDDHA S. JAGADEB

 Bhubaneswar, April 6: Rourkela Steel Plant, the first public sector integrated steel plant to be set up in the country, has posted a record annual performance. 

 In 2005-06, the production of hot metal and crude steel surpassed the earlier levels despite an economic blockade by hundreds of armed tribals of Rourkela in January. The tribals were demanding that their surplus land acquired by the RSP be returned to them. RSPs production was stalled for three days during the protests. 

 Despite the hurdles, the hot metal production in the last fiscal reached an all-time high of 1.78 million tonnes, while the production of crude steel was 1.66 mt. It also notched up a record 1.62-mt production of total saleable steel. 

 Senior RSP officials said over the last three years, the steel plant has focused on the strategy of higher capacity utilisation to bring down the cost of production and retaining its market share by producing and dispatching in accordance with market orders to improve its profitability. In the last five years, the company has brought down its workforce from 24,000 to 22,000. The turnaround in RSPs fortunes began with an improved performance in 2001-02, which was sustained. The company plans to raise production to 1.8 million tonnes of saleable steel by 2011 and hot metal production to 2 million tonnes. 

 RSPs saleable steel dispatches during the last fiscal registered an all-time best figure of about 1.6 million tonnes. The plant saw production of its niche products go up.

 While plates from plate mill saw a hike of 13 per cent, hot-rolled plates and galvanised sheets were up 20 per cent, cold-rolled non-grain oriented steel by 24 per cent, cold-rolled coils by 10 per cent and a whopping 76 per cent in the production of spiral weld pipes. 

 RSP public relations officer J.C. Mohapatra said the performance of Rourkela Steel Plant during 2005-06 has been in conformity with the SAIL Corporate Plan 2011-12.

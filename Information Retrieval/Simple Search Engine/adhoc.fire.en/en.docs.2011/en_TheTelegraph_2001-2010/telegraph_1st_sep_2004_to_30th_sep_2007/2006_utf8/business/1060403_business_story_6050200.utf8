 JK Paper scripts plan for new unit 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 2: JK Paper will invest around Rs 235 crore to set up its multi-layered packaging facility in the first quarter of 2007.

 JK Paper managing director Harshpati Singhania told The Telegraph, With the introduction of multi-layered packaging next year, we expect to cross the Rs 1000-crore turnover mark in 2008. 

 Multi-layered packaging checks and reduces damage caused to paper during transportation by adding a number of layers to a bundle.

 The company recently entered the premium end of the coated paper segment, where its sole competitor is Bilt. We have so far invested Rs 80 crore on this segment, said Singhania.

 On further investment plans, Singhania said, These are early days. At this point, we cant say how much more we are pumping in, but surely, we will continue increasing investments in this segment.

 Both multi-layered packaging and coated paper are witnessing a higher-than-average growth. In the multi-layered packaging segment, ITC is the single largest player. 

 This investment will be part of the Rs 335-crore expansion plan announced for the modernisation and upgradation of its plants.

 JK Paper plans to raise $17 million through a gross depository receipt (GDR) issue and foreign currency convertible bonds (FCCBs) to part finance its expansion.

 The company has informed the Bombay Stock Exchange that it had made an international offering of five-year unsecured FCCBs of $5 million and 77 lakh GDRs of $1.54 each, aggregating $12 million.

 The manufacturing capacity of the facility is expected to be 2.4 lakh tonnes per annum, which is likely to double in three to five years.

 AIG mulls consumer finance foray 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Feb. 26: The American International Group (AIG) is the next big American moneybag that plans to tap Indias booming financial services market after GE Money.

 AIG, which has already announced its intention of entering the asset management segment in the continent through AIG Global Investment Group (AIGIG), wants to offer a lot more here in India.

 AIG Capital Corporation has filed an application with the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) on February 6, in which it expressed interest to get into consumer durable finance, personal, auto and mortgage loans and credit card activities.

 AIG will thus be competing with GE and others in the financial services business, if it goes ahead with its plan after obtaining the requisite approvals. 

 The group, which has life insurance, general insurance, asset management and financial services businesses, is present in India through a joint venture with the Tata group in life insurance. 

 The proposed entry into other services will enhance AIGs product suite in this country. 

 AIG has roped in Ravi Mehrotra, the former president of Franklin Templeton Investments to establish its asset management arm and look into its overseas asset management initiatives in the continent. Mehrotra, was the founding member of Kothari Pioneer, the countrys first privately-held fund house, which was later acquired by Franklin Templeton. Mehrotra is largely credited with taking Franklin Templeton among the top fund houses in the country. Mehrotra joined as the regional head of AIGIGs Asia Asset Management companies.

 AIGIG comprises a group of international companies, which provide investment advice and sell asset management products and services. As on September 30, 2005, AIGIG managed over $508 billion assets spanning equities, fixed income, private equity, hedge and real estate.

 AIGs entry into financial services comes at a time when GE Consumer Finance (now branded as GE Money), the global consumer-lending unit of the multinational giant, is looking at an asset book of around Rs 17,000 crore in India over the next three years.

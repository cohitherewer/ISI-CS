 Survey pats private insurers

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 9: Private insurance companies have bagged top positions in the customer satisfaction index of a government-sponsored survey.

 However, state-owned Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) has been voted as the most reliable company.

 But LIC is lagging behind in customer satisfaction, where it has been ranked fourth.

 These are some of the findings of a survey conducted by consumer rights group Consumer Voice.

 In customer satisfaction, LIC stood fourth after Tata AIG, Aviva Life and ICICI Prudential Life Insurance.

 When asked whether LIC agrees with this assessment, T.S. Vijayan, managing director of LIC, told The Telegraph, There is no question of agreement or disagreement. For all insurance companies, customer satisfaction is judged by claim settlement. As for private insurers, they are yet to see their policies mature.

 Private insurance companies have been operating in India since 2002 after the government opened the sector to foreign investment, capping it at 26 per cent.

 The survey states that customers of Tata AIGs health and life insurance products are the most satisfied.

 The experience is echoed by policyholders who are insured by HDFCs home insurance and Iffco Tokios motor insurance policies.

 Maximum policyholders surveyed voted for HDFC Chubb general insurance in the home insurance portfolio, while Iffco Tokio emerged as the most satisfying company in the motor insurance segment.

 The survey was based on responses of 3,790 policyholders. In general, private insurers earned maximum votes for being able to enthuse customers to purchase home insurance products against the ones offered by four public sector insurance companies.

 The four PSU general insurance companies operating in India include Calcutta-headquartered National Insurance, Oriental Insurance, New India Assurance and United Insurance.

 In health insurance, the targeted segment is not satisfied with the service parameters of the insurance providers, said the survey, conducted on the directive of the consumer affairs ministry.

 Estimation of damage is a major point of conflict between consumers and service providers in the motor insurance sector, it said, adding that the satisfaction level is low in life insurance and huge gaps exist between demand and achievements.

 Meanwhile, a majority of respondents have expressed dissatisfaction on the current status of health insurance in the country. Tardy clearance of mediclaim and insufficient cashless facilities have been cited as big drawbacks.

 It also revealed that home insurance is yet to find acceptability, while customers usually go by dealers choice in car insurance.

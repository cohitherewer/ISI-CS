 Toshiba in US power deal

 Charged up

 Tokyo, Jan. 23 (Reuters): Toshiba Corp has won a bid for Westinghouse, the US power plant arm of British Nuclear Fuels, for almost $5 billion, the Financial Times reported on Monday, a move that will expand its overseas operations but has raised concerns about the cost of the deal.

 British Nuclear Fuels CEO Mike Parker and chairman Gordon Campbell decided to sell Westinghouse to Toshiba late on Saturday night, the FT said. Other suitors for Westinghouse included General Electric of the US and Japans Mitsubishi Heavy Industries.

 Neither government-owned British Nuclear Fuels nor Toshiba would confirm the report.

 No final bid has been selected yet, said a spokesman for British Nuclear Fuels. That process will take place at a board meeting this week. Until that happens, that is the position of the company.

 Takeo Miyamoto, an analyst at CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, said the possible deal would be a step in the right direction for Toshiba, although he had yet to look at whether the reported price was in an appropriate range. Traditionally, the Japanese nuclear power business has depended heavily on the domestic market, which is barely growing. Seeking expansion into China and other overseas markets should be a sound strategy, Miyamoto said.

 Nuclear power generation is said to be vital to support power demand in such fast-growing countries as India and China. The deal would help heighten Toshibas chance to win contracts in those nations.

 The Financial Times, quoting a source close to British Nuclear Fuels, said not only was Toshibas bid of nearly $5 billion the highest offer but it was also seen as the best for Westinghouses future growth prospects and its workers.

 The price was much higher than levels quoted in previous news reports. The Wall Street Journal said on Friday that the eventual sale price for Westinghouse, based in Pittsburgh and a top supplier of nuclear plant technologies, could top $3.5 billion.

 An acquisition of Westinghouse would benefit Toshiba ... but the reported $5 billion price tag was a surprise, an analyst at a Japanese brokerage said. Toshiba is burdened with heavy capital investment programs for microchips and thin TV panels. I bet they wouldnt be able to pay that on their own.

 The reported price is more than 10 times as big as Toshibas group net profit estimate for the year ending March 31.

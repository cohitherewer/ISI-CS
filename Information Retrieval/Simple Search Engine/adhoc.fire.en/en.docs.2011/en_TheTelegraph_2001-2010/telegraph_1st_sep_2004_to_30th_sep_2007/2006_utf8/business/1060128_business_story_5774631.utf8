 IOC seeks bids for stake sale

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Jan. 27: Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) has invited price bids from institutional investors for the sale of a portion of its holding in ONGC and GAIL (India) Ltd.

 IOC has asked Kotak Mahindra, Citi Financials and JM Morgan to submit price bids for the sale of up to 20 per cent of its equity in ONGC. For the sale of up to 50 per cent in GAIL, Indian Oil has invited the SBI Caps-CLSA combine to put in bids by next week-end. IOC had received 13 proposals and had shortlisted three for sale of ONGC shares and four for GAIL.

 High international prices of crude pushed the ONGC stock past the Rs 1275-mark on the Bombay Stock Exchange today. 

 IOC holds 13.7 crore shares or a 9.61 per cent stake in ONGC and 4.08 crore shares or a 4.83 per cent stake in GAIL. 

 High global crude prices and the government?s insistence on selling products at fixed prices had put IOC under financial pressure. The company has also lined up plans to acquire a mid-sized European upstream company along with OIL for which it would require a lot of cash. 

 A senior company official said the debt burden of the company had gone up to Rs 24,000 crore in the first seven months of the current fiscal compared with Rs 17,000 crore in the previous year. IOC wants to bring this down, he added.

 IOC loss

 IOC has suffered a net loss of Rs 5.83 crore for the third quarter of the current fiscal due to government subsidy on fuel prices. The company posted a net profit of Rs 1,287 crore during the same period last year. 

 ?The main reason for reduction in profit is due to increase in under-recovery on sales of motor spirit, diesel, kerosene and LPG from Rs 6,496 crore to Rs 8,106 crore during December 2005,? chairman Sarthak Behuria said today.

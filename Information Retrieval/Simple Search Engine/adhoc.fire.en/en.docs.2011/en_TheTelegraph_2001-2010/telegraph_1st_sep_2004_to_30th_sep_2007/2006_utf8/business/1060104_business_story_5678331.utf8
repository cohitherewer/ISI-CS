 i-flex gets a Greek call

 Bangalore, Jan. 3 (PTI): Alpha Bank, the second largest bank in Greece, has selected i-flex Solutions bank financial software, Flexcube, for its consumer lending and loan syndication operations.

 Founded in 1879, Alpha Bank has more than 450 branches across Greece, the Balkans and western Europe, i-flex said in a statement here today.

 The winner of the best Greek bank award for the year 2005 by Euromoney, Alpha Bank would deploy i-flexs Flexcube in multiple phases across all its branches, the statement said.

 The deployment will allow Alpha Bank to launch new products faster and enhance their flexibility in addressing their rapidly changing customer needs.

 I-flexs technical and functional expertise in providing software solutions and its significant track record of implementing them across diverse geographies were the key factors in the selection process. Flexcube also enhances our ability to launch new and innovative products, Alpha Banks Olga Charitou said in the statement.

 Banks need to tighten their current lending IT infrastructure to address this fast growing market as technology can be a crucial differentiator by providing a competitive edge. We are pleased to help Alpha Bank in their endeavour to tap these markets and enhance service standards in the new environment, said V. Senthil Kumar, CEO, i-flex Solutions.

 Alpha Bank group is also active in the international banking market, with a presence in Cyprus and south-eastern Europe as well as in New York, London and Jersey in the channel islands.

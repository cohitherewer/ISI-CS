 Nasdaq mulls more of LSE

 London, Sept. 3 (Reuters): Nasdaq Stock Market is considering making a hostile bid for the London Stock Exchange (LSE), in which it has amassed a stake of over 25 per cent, weekly UK newspaper The Observer said on Sunday, without citing any sources. 

 The US exchange made an initial $4.2-billion takeover offer in March but was rebuffed by LSE, which it considers the crown jewel of European equities markets. 

 Nasdaq declined to comment on Sundays report.

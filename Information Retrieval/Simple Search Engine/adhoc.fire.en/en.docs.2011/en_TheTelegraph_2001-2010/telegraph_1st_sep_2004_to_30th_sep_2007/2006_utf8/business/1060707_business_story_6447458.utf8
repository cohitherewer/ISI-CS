 Jute must for grain packing

 New Delhi, July 6: Draping a comfort cushion around jute growers, the government today approved mandatory use of jute in the packing of foodgrain and sugar. 

 Information minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi said the jute norm was part of the common minimum programme. 

 It is in continuation of last years policy of providing sustenance to millions of people engaged in the jute sector, Das Munshi said after a meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs here today. The norm will take effect from 2006-07 jute year (July-June).

 The decision puts to rest attempts by the Union textile ministry ? the parent ministry for jute ? to promote the use of polythene.

 This was, however, strongly opposed by the Bengal government as it feared for the livelihood of 40 lakh jute growers and about 2.5 lakh workers. The state government also said polythene was environment unfriendly. 

 A recent meeting of the standing advisory committee decided to dilute the norms on mandatory use of jute in the packing of foodgrain and sugar. 

 The committee had proposed that reservation for jute in packing be reduced from 100 per cent to 80 per cent in foodgrains and 75 per cent in sugar for 2006-07. 

 The Left parties went on the overdrive in its opposition to the proposal. CPM parliamentarian Hannan Mollah wrote a letter to the Prime Minister against the proposals.

 Meanwhile, the CCEA approved the 1,000-mw Tehri Pumped Storage Power Plant in Uttaranchal at an estimated cost of Rs 1,657.60 crore. The project is being executed by the Tehri Hydro Development Corporation. 

 The CCEA also approved a mining project and a health sector proposal. The Rs 470-crore opencast mining project in Magadh of the Central Coalfields Limited has got the nod. The mine has reserves of 12 million tonnes, Das Munshi said.

 Permission was given to augment the corpus of Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI) by Rs 65 crore. The initial size of the corpus was Rs 200 crore. The mandate of PFHI is to create world-class institutions in public health.

 Relief for mills

 The cabinet decision is set to revitalise jute mills which expects to provide the bags at lower prices following a higher crop output.

 The trade estimates raw jute crop to be around 100-110 lakh bales against 85 lakh bales last year.

 Ranbaxy hungry for more buyouts

 Singh: Big plans

 Mumbai, Sept. 12 (Reuters): Ranbaxy Laboratories expects strong growth in the United States although pricing pressure in the key market would continue, chief executive Malvinder Singh said on Tuesday. 

 Ranbaxy, which has acquired several firms in Europe this year, is exploring more buys and has many opportunities on the table, he said. 

 But the United States will be a key market for growth. 

 Competition is going to be there but we have a strong presence in that market. Over the next few years, we have a large number of products, that will get approval, Singh said.

 There is larger value sitting in the pipeline, larger than what we have today, he said. 

 Revenue from the United States, which accounts for about a third of Ranbaxys revenue, is expected to rise to 45-50 per cent, Singh said, but he did not say when this will happen. 

 The company expects good growth in other markets also, Singh said. 

 We see growth everywhere, even in Europe. With rising healthcare costs, they will encourage generics further. The number of patents expiring is very large, he said. 

 In Europe, the companys acquisitions this year included Romanias Terapia for $324 million and firms in Italy, Spain and Belgium. 

 Singh said Ranbaxy had appetite for more acquisitions. 

 We continue to explore opportunities. We have a number of them on the table.

 Singh said the company was on track to achieve its target of being one of the top five generic players with $5 billion in annual sales by 2012. 

 Clearly a lot of work needs to be done to get there but if you look at the top 10, the first two are very large but the gap between the third and the tenth is not much. 

 He said Ranbaxys presence in 49 countries and more acquisitions would help it grow. We are looking at doing things which will enable us to have strong organic growth and complement it with inorganic growth, he said. 

 Although competition for sales of generics cheap versions of drugs out of patent remains strong, firms such as Ranbaxy, Cipla and Dr Reddys are likely to show higher sales.

 Mumbai, Sept. 20: Jet Airways has put its $800-million capital-raising plans on the backburner. It has, however, finalised flight plans to more international destinations and has asked for regulatory permission to fly to a number of cities in Europe, the US and China. 

 Considering the downturn in the domestic equity markets and in other emerging markets, we have decided to defer the capital raising plans until market conditions are more conducive, Jet Airways chairman Naresh Goyal told shareholders at the 14th annual general meeting today. 

 We have decided to undertake short-term borrowings from IDBI Bank, State Bank of India and ICICI Bank. We will closely monitor the market and revive efforts to raise additional capital as soon as the opportunity arises, said Goyal. 

 In February, the airline had decided on the capital expenditure programme of $2.5 billion, including the delivery of 30 new narrow-bodied and wide-bodied aircraft over the next three years. 

 With the wide-bodied aircraft due for delivery from next year, the countrys leading carrier is gearing up to expand its international operations. 

 Over the next two to three years, we expect our international operations to contribute about 45-50 per cent of our total revenues, said Saroj Datta, executive director, Jet Airways. 

 The international network of the company would include the US, Canada, the UK, South Africa, Kenya and Mauritius. It would connect points in China and South Asia and also in Europe like Rome, Zurich, Munich and Frankfurt. 

 The stock price of Jet Airways, which was issued at Rs 1,100 during the maiden offer in February 2005, got clobbered to Rs 475.10 in July this year following the announcement of the Air Sahara takeover. 

 While the stock has gained since then, it remains well below the issue price. It closed at Rs 652.60 today on the Bombay Stock Exchange. According to sector analysts, the scrip will be under pressure for the next few quarters. 

 Goyal said the losses in the airline industry are likely to mount due to escalating costs, especially of fuel. 

 Airlines in India are expected to suffer a cumulative loss of about Rs 2,200 crore in 2006-07, Goyal said. He said the situation was likely to worsen with five to six new airlines planning to commence operations in the near future. 

 Shah Rukh Khans presence as an additional director on the Jet Airways board added glamour to the meeting. The shareholders speeches mostly revolved round the actor with a few enthusiasts launching into starry-eyed poems. 

 Khan, on his part, did not deny his shareholder-fans a brief speech. This is my first appearance as a director of a public company. While it is true that I do not have the expertise in the airline business as other members of the board, I believe I can add value to the company and the shareholders with certain creative inputs, said Khan. 

 Edelweiss Capital has just released a report on the aviation sector where it remains underweight on the Jet Airways stock. It talks about the falling profitability of Jet Airways, which suffered a Rs 45 crore loss in the first quarter.

 Vodafone forays into broadband

 New venture

 London, Sept. 11 (Reuters): The Vodafone group confirmed its plan to enter the cut-throat fixed-line broadband Internet market via a deal with the wholesale arm of telecom firm BT Group on Monday. 

 Vodafone, which said in May it planned to enter adjacent telecom markets such as broadband Internet, said it expected to launch the new Vodafone-branded service by the end of this year. 

 This partnership enables Vodafones customers to benefit from bundled packages of mobile and broadband services nationwide, due to BTs unique footprint in the UK, Vodafone, the worlds biggest mobile phone operator by sales, said in a statement.

 Until recently, UK-based Vodafone had prided itself on being a pure play mobile operation, unencumbered by a declining fixed-line business. 

 But as fixed and mobile businesses move to cheaper, combined services, the firm has had to change track. 

 In May, Vodafone said it was aiming to get up to 10 per cent of its annual revenues over the next three to four years from its new Mobile Zone businesses, including converged fixed-mobile Internet services. 

 Competition in the broadband market is intense, with Carphone Warehouse, BSkyB and rival mobile phone group Orange recently announcing cut-price packages. 

 Investec Securities analyst Christian Maher said it was important for Vodafone to differentiate its offering. 

 The danger is its just a me-too product ... almost definitely low margin and only really there to keep customers that would otherwise use someone else, he said.

 Vodafone did not give details of the new fixed-line broadband product. 

 Britains second-biggest telecom group, Cable amp; Wireless Plc, recently exited the retail broadband market, in part because of the stiff competition. At 11:08 am, Vodafone shares were up 0.7 per cent at 114-1/4 pence, valuing the business at about 60 billion.

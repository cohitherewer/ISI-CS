 Sensex cheers up after mood swings

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

Mumbai, May 25: Shares were on a tempestuous mood today with the sensex fluctuating 445.74 points before ending the day with a gain.

 The 30-share index opened lower at 10520.90 on heavy selling pressure due to expiry on the futures contract for May 2006 series. It touched the day?s low of 10274.93 in the early session. 

 However, in the afternoon session, the market moved into the positive territory and after alternate bouts of buying and selling ended the day with a gain of 93.17 points or 0.88 per cent at 10666.32. The intraday high today was at 10720.67. Nifty advanced 62 points, or 1.99 per cent, to end at 3177.70. 

 Brokers were prepared for a volatile session today as the market was tense over F amp;O settlements and investors squaring off their positions. 

 In the afternoon session, settlement speculation abated, and investors started building fresh positions. 

 Nifty June 2006 futures ended at 3095, a steep discount of 82.70 points over the spot closing of 3177.70. Most contracts, including Reliance Industries (RIL) and Infosys, in the June 2006 futures settled at a discount, though MTNL bucked the trend. 

 Asian markets, however, were in the grip of a depression: Tokyo?s benchmark Nikkei fell 1.34 per cent, while Hong Kongs Hang Seng was down 0.79 per cent. The Shanghai Composite Index gained 0.03 per cent after dipping as much as 1.7 per cent earlier in the day. South Korea?s Kospi dropped to its lowest level in six months to 2.8 per cent. 

 UTI Mutual Fund?s A.K. Sridhar said, ?The recent fall in the Indian markets is not isolated and is in tandem with a correction witnessed in the global markets. From now on, the overall interest rate situation and the global liquidity situation will determine the direction of the markets.? 

 The total turnover on BSE, however, slipped to Rs 3,030.02 crore compared with Rs 3,739 crore yesterday. Also, the market breadth was weak with 1,523 stocks declining and 906 rising. 55 stocks remained unchanged. 

 Meanwhile, FIIs sold shares worth Rs 1,935 crore on Wednesday and Rs 1,243 crore on Tuesday. The cumulative outflow for May 2006 so far has reached Rs 5,378.50 crore.

 Calcutta, June 7: The century-old Calcutta Stock Exchange was saved today from going into oblivion. 

 After much acrimony, member brokers today agreed to demutualise the exchange, according to the scheme of the Securities and Exchange Board of India, and passed resolutions to amend the Memorandum of Association, paving the way for the exchange to become a corporate entity.

 The exchange, under the supervision of a Sebi-appointed administrator since December 2003, had to amend its MoA before June 10 to comply with the Companies Act 1956 and the demutualisation scheme of the market regulator. If the exchange failed to abide by these norms, it would have been derecognised by the regulator.

 The member brokers needed to approve an increase in the authorised capital of the exchange to a minimum of Rs 5 lakh from the existing Rs 3 lakh to become a corporate entity under the companies act and divest 51 per cent equity to at least two non-broker strategic investors. 

 However, they decided to raise the authorised capital to Rs 10 lakh by creating 2,800 fresh equity shares of Rs 250 each. Currently, the paid-up and the authorised capital of the exchange is Rs 3 lakh, comprising 1,200 equity shares of Rs 250 each held by 900 member brokers. The members have also agreed that not more than 1,300 shares should be issued to strategic partners. 

 With daily transactions down to just Rs 80 lakh in a handful of scrips, the CSE was staring at a closure till the last meeting of the members held a couple of weeks ago. The member brokers failed to come to a consensus on passing the MoA amendments and an extraordinary general meeting was called for today.

 At the earlier meeting, administrator T.K. Das, a former official of the West Bengal government, proposed to increase the exchanges authorised capital to Rs 10 crore by creating 3,98,000 equity shares of Rs 250 each. But the member brokers were opposed to this proposal as they feared this would dilute their control over the exchange after demutualisation.

 The members had then demanded that 2,04,000 of the 3,98,000 shares be allotted to new investors at a premium. The remaining 1,94,800 shares should be issued to them on right basis at par. 

 If the authorised capital was raised to Rs 10 crore and 2,04,000 shares were allotted to other than broker members, our shareholding in the exchange post-demutualisation would have come down to 0.3 per cent, said a broker.

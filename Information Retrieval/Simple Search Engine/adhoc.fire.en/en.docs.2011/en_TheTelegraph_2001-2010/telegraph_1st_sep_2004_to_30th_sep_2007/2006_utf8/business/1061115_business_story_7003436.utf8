 Please-all SEZ policy on drawing board

 S.P.S. PANNU 

 New Delhi, Nov. 14: The government plans to place before the cabinet next month a revised policy for SEZs and petrochemicals and petroleum investment regions (PPIRS) to allay fears of the Left over farmers getting a raw deal and mitigate worries over losses from the tax concessions to these regions.

 Sources said that the group of ministers (GoM) will work on the existing proposals to fix a ceiling on the size of these zones to prevent large tracts of fertile lands from being used for non-agricultural purposes.

 Farmers are likely to get a higher compensation for the land given to the these zones as the existing norms for payment are inadequate.

 There will also be limits on the tax concessions offered to units to accommodate the misgivings of the finance ministry.

 The GoM will also prepare guidelines on the pricing policy of companies in SEZs vis--vis sales to subsidiaries, to prevent any underinvoicing of revenues. The government is likely to recommend an arms-length pricing policy under which price for a subsidiary will be the same as any other company. 

 The Left is concerned over farmers getting displaced without adequate compensation, which is also worrying the Congress with party president Sonia Gandhi voicing her concern at the recent conclave of Congress chief ministers in Nainital.

 The government has decided to go slow on SEZs for the IT sector. The Left wants to limit such SEZs. However, the government has stopped short of putting a cap but will go slow for the time being, a senior commerce ministry official said. 

 The Left feels the developers of IT SEZs will be more inclined to make profits from realty deals inside the zones at the expense of realising the employment and other welfare potential of the zones.

 The Left has argued for the Centre to adopt the Bengal model for SEZs. 

 The state has stipulated 50 per cent of the land to be used for processing activities against the 35 per cent norm of the Centre.

 Inflation push to rate hike

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 23: The rate of inflation has risen to 5.24 per cent, the highest since May 2005, raising apprehensions that the government and the Reserve Bank of India would announce another interest rate hike early next month to cool down prices. 

 Senior finance ministry officials said a quarter to half a percentage point interest rate hike cannot be ruled out with the inflation rate topping the 5 per cent mark. The RBI had recently announced a repo rate hike to contain inflation, but officials feel it may not have been enough. 

 Our aim is to keep inflation at 5-5.5 per cent, any dangers of that level being breached will be met with monetary and fiscal (tax) measures, they said. 

 India has followed a cheap interest rate regime to help industry grow at near double-digit rates and to help a booming housing construction sector. Cheap credit will have to be something from the past if we want to keep the lid on the inflation monster, admitted officials. 

 Finance minister P. Chidambaram told reporters here the government could take further action to contain inflation. 

 Monetary measures, fiscal steps have been taken and some action has happened on the import side, he said.

 I am confident these steps will moderate the inflation rate. If necessary, we will take further steps, he added.

 The government has recently reduced customs duty on sugar and wheat and opened up imports by private firms.

 Calcutta, Feb. 21: After a dry run for almost 50 years, Bengal is witnessing big-buck investments in the automobile sector.

 Following the heavy truck plant announced by Russian firm Ural and a two-wheeler unit by Indonesian Salim Group, home-grown Xenitis Group has decided to foray into this sector.

 Today it announced a two-wheeler project in technical collaboration with Chinese firm Guangzhou Motors Co.

 The group will invest Rs 300 crore in the project. The plant will be set up at Chinsura in Hoogly district, close to the companys PC assembly line.

 The company will unveil the motorcycles under the brand Xoom on Bengali New Years Day in April, said Shantanu Ghosh, chairman of the Xenitis group and owner of the popular Amar PC brand.

 The motorcycles will be launched in three variants ? 100cc, 125cc and 150cc.

 Ghosh claimed that the project would be completed by June. Initially, the bikes will be imported in semi-knocked down form.

 In the first six months, the plant will have a capacity of 35,000 units, which will be later scaled up to 50000-60000 units per month.

 Global Automobiles (P) Ltd, the corporate entity of the groups motorcycle business, expects to sell 1.5-lakh units in 2006 and achieve a turnover of $80 million during 2006-07.

 A team of Guangzhou Motors is visiting the city. The group will visit the location where the new facility will come up.

 Tathagata Dutta, managing director of the company, said the project was being developed on a 1:2 debt equity ratio. 

 Asked if the Chinese company would pick up a stake in Global Automobile, Dutta said no decision has been taken on this, even though Guangzhou Motors has expressed interests.

 DLF flotation on course

 New Delhi, June 17 (PTI): Undettered by the volatility in stock markets as also controversy over its pre-IPO debentures, real estate major DLF today announced that it would bring out within four weeks its public issue, touted as the biggest in the Indian market.

 ?We are on schedule. July 10-15 is the timeframe that we are looking at for going to the public,? senior vice-president Saurabh Chawla told reporters debunking reports about any delay or cut in the issue size.

 ?There has been no dilution in the shares that the company plans to offer through its IPO,? he said when asked if DLF could cut the issue size due to volatility in the market and trading of the recent issues below par. The company hopes that the capital market would stabilise at the time when it intends to hit the market, he said.

 ?When we started the IPO process in March, the sensex was at 10500 and right now it is at the same level,? Chawla said, emphasising that investors also take into account the underlying value of the company.

 He said the company had given 

 its clarification to market regulator Sebi on complaints 

 raised by some minority shareholders that they were denied 

 participation in the debenture issue floated by the company 

 late last year and that there was no clarity at that time 

 about the company going public.

 Small pharma firms in US rush

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Sept. 3: Call it inspiration from industry heavyweights or a reflection of how domestic pharmaceutical companies are making their presence felt in the global scene, mid-sized drug companies from India have outnumbered biggies like Dr. Reddys Laboratories and Ranbaxy Laboratories in terms of drug master files (DMFs) filed in the US during the second quarter of this calendar year.

 While the quarter again showed dominance of Indian companies that accounted for more than 30 per cent of the filings, Aurobindo Pharma, Matrix Laboratories and many others hogged the limelight during the period as they too wanted to grab a slice of the opportunities emerging from many drugs going off-patent in the coming years. A DMF is submitted to the US FDA, and it provides confidential information regarding a specific manufacturing facility, process or article used in the manufacture of drugs.

 Apart from Aurobindo and Matrix, Cadila Healthcare, Dabur Pharma, Divis Laboratories, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals, Ipca Laboratories, Aarti Drugs and Jubilant Organosys filed DMFs. The filings were for products whose innovators included Sanofi Aventis, Novartis, Merck and Glaxosmithkline.

 According to a report from Morgan Stanley, Aurobindo topped the list with 21 filings, followed by Lupin and Matrix with nine and eight filings respectively. Among larger companies, Sun Pharmaceuticals filed six, Dr. Reddys Laboratories three and Ranbaxy filed one DMF. 

 Aurobindo is an example of the evolution of drug companies over the last few years. Largely known for manufacturing semi-synthetic penicillins (SSPs), it has ventured into formulations, cephalosporins, anti-virals and active pharmaceutical ingredients, and has also stepped into regulated markets. The cumulative DMFs filed by the company now stand at around 80. During the quarter, the Hyderabad-based firm made filings for various drugs, which include quetiapine fumarate (Seroquel-AstraZeneca), a drug used to treat schizophrenia, trandolapril, an antibiotic that is marketed under the brand name Mavik (Abbott Laboratories).

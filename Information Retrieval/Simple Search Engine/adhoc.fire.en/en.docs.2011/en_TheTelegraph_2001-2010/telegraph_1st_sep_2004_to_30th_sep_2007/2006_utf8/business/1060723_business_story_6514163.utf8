 The more, the merrier

 New Delhi, July 22: Pantaloon Retail (India) Limited today announced strategic tie-ups with Fun Foods, Wai Wai and Ruchi Soya Industries, which will allow the three companies to sell their products through the stores of the multi-format retailer. 

 As part of the alliance, Fun Foods plans to set up salad bars at Pantaloons stores such as Big Bazaar and Food Bazaar. 

 The agreement enables us to offer customers a variety of fresh salads with an array of salad dressings. The first such bar is likely to come up in another 10 days in Bangalore, said Viraj Bahl of Fun Foods.

 Similarly, Nepals Chaudhary group has signed an agreement to retail its Wai Wai noodles at all Food Bazaar stores across India. 

 Ruchi Soya, the producer and supplier of edible oils, will distribute its products such as Nutrela, Ruchi Gold, Ruchi Star and Nutrela Soyumm through Pantaloons retail outlets. 

 We are also working with Ruchi to launch Fresh and Pure, our private label in edible oil, which will be manufactured by Ruchi and is likely to hit the markets in the next eight weeks, said Damodar Mall, president of the food business division, Pantaloon Retail India.

 The company is planning to expand its Food Bazaar stores to 200 outlets from 50 in the next two years and is also looking at tie-ups with 12 or more enterprises.

 Senior company officials confirmed that Pantaloon is also in talks with shoe companies such as Action and Lakhani to retail their products. According to Mall, the company is on a vendor expansion spree. After shortlisting nearly 200 small and mid-term vendors across different business line-ups, it plans to tie-up with at least a dozen of them in the near future.

 The SME vendors will get a pan India platform to exhibit their products, while the tieups will give us (Pantaloon) the opportunity to offer better value and choice to our customers, he said. 

 Pantaloon Retail clocked a turnover of Rs 1,073 crore for the financial year ended June 2005. The company has retail presence across various segments, including food, fashion and footwear.

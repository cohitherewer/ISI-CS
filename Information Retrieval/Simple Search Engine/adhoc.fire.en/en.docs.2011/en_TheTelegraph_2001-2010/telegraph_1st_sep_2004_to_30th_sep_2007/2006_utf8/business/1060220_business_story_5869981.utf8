 Cashing in on dividend yield

 The stock market is at a heady high. Is it still the right time to plunge into the equity market?

 Stocks with a good dividend paying history are generally less volatile, particularly in the downward direction, when the market nosedives.

 In the present situation, dividend yield mutual fund schemes offer some ingress. 

 Dividend yield of a stock is a measure of its dividend return as a percentage of the current market price of the stock. 

 Dividend yield mutual fund schemes invest in stocks, which have a high dividend yield. 

 Such a scheme is suitable for small investors in particular at this hour. A stock with a high dividend yield entails two things ? a steady stream of dividend during a dull market and a potential spurt in the stock?s price when the market starts moving up.

 The first mover in the block has been Birla Dividend Yield Plus fund.

 Since inception in February 2003, it has given a total return of 162 per cent ? Rs 10 invested in the scheme then would have amounted to Rs 26.20 now.

 Other such funds are Principal Dividend Yield Fund, Tata Dividend Yield Fund, UTI Dividend Yield Fund, ABN AMRO Dividend Yield Fund and ING Dividend Yield Fund. 

 All of them have given reasonably good returns. 

 As these are actively managed diversified equity schemes, investors can expect handsome capital appreciation, besides regular dividend payments.

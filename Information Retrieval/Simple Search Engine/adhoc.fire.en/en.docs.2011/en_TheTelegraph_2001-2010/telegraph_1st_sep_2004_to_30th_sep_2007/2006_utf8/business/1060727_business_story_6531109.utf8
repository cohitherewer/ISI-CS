 Anil sees cash in bad assets

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Anil: Hopeful

 Mumbai, July 26: The Reliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group will foray into asset reconstruction as part of its strategy to provide the entire gamut of services that are available in the financial sector.

 The business will be undertaken by Reliance Asset Reconstruction Company, a unit of Reliance Capital. Corporation Bank, Indian Bank and General Insurance Corporation are the likely partners in the venture though this could not be verified from the company.

 Rajendra Kakkar, formerly of Asset Reconstruction Company India Ltd (Arcil), will head the venture.

 Sources expect Reliance Asset Reconstruction to do good business in stressed asset market, which is worth Rs 2 trillion and has only one other player ? Arcil ? besides Reliance. Arcil was floated by the State Bank of India, IDBI, ICICI Bank and Punjab National Bank.

 Sources said Reliance would score over Arcil as its policy of paying cash upfront would help it acquire stressed assets at a greater discount. 

 Kakkar was the managing director and chief executive officer (CEO) of Arcil and he undertook the crucial task of setting up the companys operations in India. 

 Prior to Arcil, Kakkar was the managing director of the State Bank of Hyderabad in 2002 and 2003 and was in the State Bank of India for over 35 years.

 Bid to spice up bank deposits

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Sinor: Bank on us

 Mumbai, March 28: Bankers are worried: with mutual funds scooping up sackfuls of cash from the market in recent months, money isnt flowing into staid bank deposits.

 Bankers are now looking to come up with urgent measures to make bank deposits more attractive.

 They realise that they need to do something fairly quickly because there is a massive demand for credit both from households and companies, but deposit growth isnt large enough to meet this demand.

 Although finance minister P. Chidambaram did oblige the community in the 2006-07 Union Budget by bestowing tax incentives on deposits above five years that brings them on a par with ELSS schemes, banks are not satisfied. Some feel that benefits of section 80C should also be extended to deposits that carry a maturity period of three years.

 Others want the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to relax interest rate restrictions placed on NRI deposits to boost remittances from overseas Indians which at one point of time was put at over $23 billion. The remittances from NRIs can be one very good source of liquidity, they contend.

 There are also a few who privately say that the governments insistence on holding lending rates steady is preventing them from raising deposit rates as spreads have to be maintained.

 It was amid these circumstances that leading bankers today met RBI governor Y. V. Reddy in a pre-credit policy meeting. The central bank is due to announce the lean season monetary policy on April 18. 

 At the heart of the problem is the slow pace of deposits growth vis-?-vis advances. The recently released weekly statistical supplement of the RBI throws some light on this. While aggregate deposits so far in this year is put at Rs 2,90,048 crore, non-food credit was placed at Rs 3,46,321 crore. The deposits are not growing at a pace in which the advances are rising, H.N. Sinor, chief executive of the Indian Banks Association told The Telegraph.

 The disappointing part is that banks have not been successful in mobilising resources in the manner in which some of the mutual funds have done. A recent testimony to this fact was the new fund offer of Reliance Equity Fund, which collected Rs 5,759 crore from over 9.29 lakh applications across the country. Reliance followed SBI Bluechip Fund which garnered Rs 2,855 crore.

 So far this year, 12 new fund offers have collected Rs 16,287 crore, which is nearly 65 per cent of the total collection by equity funds in 2005. However, this is not the end of it. There are many more new offerings in the anvil. Fidelity Mutual Fund today launched Special Situations Fund, while Franklin Templetons Equity Income Fund offer is already on. Another aggressive player ? Lotus Asset Management, a joint venture between Temasek and Sabre Capital ? will also enter the market.

 One reason for deposits not growing at a fast pace is that mutual fund is an instrument that has been preferred by the retail individual. Though in a system, we all have to co-exist, bank deposits could be made more attractive. The finance minister has announced the benefit of section 80C to deposits above five years. This will stop to some extent the cannibalisation by mutual funds, says a chief executive of a public sector bank.

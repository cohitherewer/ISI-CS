 BSE puts monitoring system in place

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, May 9: The Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) has deployed an online surveillance system, implemented by Wipro Infotech and Oracle, for proper functioning of the capital markets.

 While we had implemented the first phase in August 2005, the progress in the capital markets makes it even more relevant now, said Rajnikant Patel, managing director and chief executive officer of BSE.

 Though the exchange did not divulge the amount spent on the system, Patel said, It is a substantial sum and in future too, technology will be the major investment driver for the exchange.

 With over 5 million transactions per day, it is crucial for us to have an integrated surveillance system for effective monitoring and compliance. Among other benefits, this solution will help us improve the speed of investigations and cater to regulatory requirements, added Patel.

 The BSE online surveillance system-integrated (BOSS-I) permits realtime monitoring and data management for any suspicious activity.

 The BSE, currently undergoing demutualisation, is awaiting Sebis final guidelines regarding the same.

 Now that the regulator has drafted a proposal to increase public shareholding, we expect the process to be completed soon, said Patel. He is a member of the committee formed by Sebi to draft guidelines for exchanges post demutualisation. Yesterday, Sebi released the report submitted by the committee and has sought public comments.

 According to the recommendations, stock exchanges might opt for the initial public offering route to increase the public shareholding as required by the demutualisation scheme. However, the report said since all the exchanges might not wish to adopt the IPO route, exchanges should be allowed to induct strategic partners to aid development.

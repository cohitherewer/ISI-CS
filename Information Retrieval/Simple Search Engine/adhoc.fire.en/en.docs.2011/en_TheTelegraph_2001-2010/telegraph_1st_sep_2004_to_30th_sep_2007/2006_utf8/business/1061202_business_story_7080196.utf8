 Chidambaram: Troubled?

 New Delhi, Dec. 1: The inflation rate today surged to 5.45 per cent, the highest in the last 18 months, raising fears of the interest rate going up next month by a quarter to half a percentage point at the behest of the RBI.

 The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has fixed a inflation target of 5-5.5 per cent for this fiscal. It is a supply side problem. We have to manage it, finance minister P. Chidambaram told newspersons.

 However, both Chidambaram and RBI deputy governor Rakesh Mohan today said the cut in oil prices announced earlier this week would cool down prices. Fuel prices come under the wholesale price index (WPI) and it (fall in prices) would have some effect, Mohan said.

 North Block officials expect inflation to be tamed by lower oil prices and a softening of food prices with the winter harvest. Even then, inflation will hover around the 5-per-cent mark. This is not exactly a happy situation though expected, the officials said.

 If inflation hovers around the 5.5-per-cent-mark the upper limit of the RBI band a quarter to half a percentage point hike in the interest rate cannot be ruled out. This will dash chances of continuing with the benign interest rate regime that has helped the manufacturing sector post a double-digit growth and fuelled a boom in housing.

 If a rate hike is made, it will be part of a series of measures initiated to check prices, such as easing import norms.

 Though prices of some items are under check, that of essential food items such as pulses, wheat, sugar and vegetables are on the rise, keeping inflation above 5 per cent since the last week of September. For the week ended November 18, prices were up for wheat, gram, masur, iron ore, cement, edible oils, ayurvedic medicines and basic metals.

 Analysts feel the 9 per cent growth in gross domestic product (GDP) will keep the pressure on inflation for the rest of the fiscal.

 The Institute of Economic Growth, an economic think tank advising the government, in a report to the North Block has forecast inflation rate will be in the range of 5.44 per cent to 5.6 per cent for the third quarter of the fiscal.

 The main factor behind inflation, besides food and oil prices, is the high rate of growth of money supply, which shot up to 19 per cent by the middle of October.

 The government revised the final inflation figure to 5.43 per cent for the week ended September 23 from the provisional 4.77 per cent, while the wholesale price index (WPI) stood corrected at 207.9 points against the earlier estimate of 206.6 points.

 For November 18, the index for primary articles declined by 0.5 per cent to 213.4 points, due to cheaper food and non-food items. The index was at 199.3 points in the year-ago period. 

 The heavy-weighted manufactured products group index was up by 0.1 per cent to 180.3 points.

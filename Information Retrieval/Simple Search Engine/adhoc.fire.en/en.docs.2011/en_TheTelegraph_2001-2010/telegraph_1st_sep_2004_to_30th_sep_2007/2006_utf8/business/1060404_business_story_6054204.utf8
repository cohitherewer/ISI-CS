 Hedge fund set to buy 

GM unit

 New York, April 3 (Reuters): General Motors is expected to sell a controlling stake in its General Motors Acceptance Corp financial services business to a consortium led by hedge fund Cerberus Capital Management LP for a total of roughly $11 billion, sources familiar with the situation said on Sunday. The Cerberus-led investor group, which includes the private equity unit of Citigroup, has been viewed as the front runner for the GMAC stake in what has become a complicated and drawn-out bidding process.

 Cerberus may secure some funding to help buy the GMAC stake from its portfolio firms, including Aozora Bank Ltd of Japan, the sources said. 

 Japans Norinchukin Bank may also join the Cerberus consortium. Sources stressed on Sunday that efforts to structure a deal could yet prove unsuccessful.

 GM on Tuesday filed its delayed annual report, restating financial results for several years. GMAC warned then there was no guarantee GM would succeed in selling a majority stake in the business.

 Sources said the GM board met on Sunday to consider a GMAC stake sale. The GMAC stake would be a major coup for Cerberus, named after the three-headed watchdog in Greek mythology that guards the gates of hell. Cerberus made its name as a distressed asset buyer and has grown to become one of the largest hedge fund traders and buyout firms in the world.

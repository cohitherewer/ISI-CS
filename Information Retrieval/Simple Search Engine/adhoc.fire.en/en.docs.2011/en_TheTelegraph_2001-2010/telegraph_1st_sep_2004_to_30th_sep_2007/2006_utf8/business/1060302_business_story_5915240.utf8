 Post-budget sensex rally hits a peak

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, March 1: The bourses today recorded an all-time high post-budget rally, fuelled by the absence of any devil in details in the budget fine print.

 Bolstered by hectic buying in infrastructure and automobile stocks, the BSE benchmark index breached the 10500-mark and closed at 10565.47 against yesterdays 10370.24, a rise of 195.23 points or 1.8 per cent. 

 It took just 16 trading sessions for the sensex to reach 10500 after it first hit 10000 on February 6, 2006. 

 According to market watchers, with no negative surprises in the budget, funds that were waiting to be pumped in are now being put to use. The BSE clocked a turnover of Rs 4,276 crore compared with Tuesdays Rs 4,317 crore.

 Stocks across sectors ended the day in the positive with strong buying seen in auto, consumer durables, technology, metal, capital goods, FMCG and pharma sectors. However, a few banking and petrochemical stocks ended in the red.

 The governments thrust on power, road and infrastructure in the budget boosted cement, auto, construction and power stocks.

 To a great extent, liquidity will be the only factor that will affect the markets. People are happy with the finance ministers continuing policy of taxing the expenses and maintaining the income. The overall economy and major sectors will continue to perform well and therefore, the markets should continue to hold, said R. Sreesankar, research head of IL amp;FS Investsmart.

 Among the cement scrips, ACC rose 10 per cent to Rs 692.20 on a high traded volume of 15.3 lakh shares. Grasim gained 4.9 per cent at Rs 1,828, UltraTech Cement rose 4 per cent to Rs 584 and Gujarat Ambuja Cements gained 3 per cent at Rs 90.90. According to reports, cement firms have raised the prices of the commodity by Rs 8 to Rs 15 per 50 kg bag in the main Mumbai market and the price hike is likely to spill over to the southern market. 

 Maruti Udyog jumped nearly 10 per cent to Rs 903 on the back of a cut in its small car prices following a lowering of excise duty to 16 per cent from 24 per cent. Tata Motors also gained 3.5 per cent to close at Rs 843. Other auto stocks, including Cummins, Mico, Asahi India, Bajaj Auto, M amp;M, Bharat Forge, Apollo Tyres and MRF, also moved up.

 The IT stocks also ended higher as the relaxation in fringe benefit tax is expected to benefit the IT companies. Satyam Computer rose 3.7 per cent to Rs 798, I-flex rose 5 per cent to Rs 1,117, Infosys rose 2.8 per cent to Rs 2,910 and Wipro rose 1.3 per cent to Rs 527.

 RBI recipe for farm growth

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Close vigil

 Mumbai, Aug. 30: With the agriculture sector on a weak wicket, the RBI today gave the call for another Green Revolution to venture into new crops and seize emerging opportunities.

 In its report card of the economy for 2005-06, the RBI said agriculture will have to pull up its socks for the economy to sustain its momentum in recent years.

 It said the growth in the agriculture sector has been low and volatile. In the first four years of the Tenth Five Year Plan, agriculture grew by just two per cent against the target four per cent for the plan period. 

 The report said the share of agriculture in total gross domestic product (GDP) has fallen to 20 per cent from 35 per cent in 1980-81, but the proportion of the total population living off agriculture has declined only marginally.

 Production of staples such as wheat, sugar and pulses has also stagnated recently.

 Investments in agriculture have also stagnated, though the private sector is more to blame rather than the public sector which is gradually taking a greater exposure in the sector.

 While increase in investment is essential for improving the prospects of the agricultural sector, the composition of investments, the quality of facilities created and the efficacy with which these facilities are used are also important, the report observed.

 RBI said inadequate expansion of irrigation facilities has prevented quick assimilation of new technology. The farms are dependent on the vagaries of the monsoon with only 40 per cent of the land under irrigation.

 Given the several risks that farmers face such as future price and monsoon conditions, there is a need to put in place proper risk mitigation policies, the report observed.

 IndusInd earnings slide

 Mumbai, June 13 (PTI): IndusInd Bank has registered a steep fall in its operating profit in 2005-06 at Rs 224.57 crore against Rs 401.24 crore in 2004-05.

 The bank suffered a loss of Rs 62.40 crore in the fourth quarter of 2005-06 against a net profit of Rs 62.91 crore in the corresponding period in 2004-05. Its operating profit also declined to Rs 40.05 crore from Rs 112.06 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous year. Its profit after tax also slid sharply to Rs 36 crore from Rs 210.15 crore in 2004-05.

 Attributing the loss to an increase in cost of deposits from 5.44 per cent in 2004-05 to 5.97 per cent in 2005-06, the banks managing director Bhaskar Ghose said the bank also incurred a loss in trading activities.

 This, coupled with a lower trading income on investments and absence of securitisation profit, forced us into a loss in the fourth quarter of 2005-06, he said.

 Another reason for the loss was the higher provisioning and contingencies which the bank put in at Rs 102.45-crore against just Rs 49.15 crore in the fourth quarter of 2004-05.

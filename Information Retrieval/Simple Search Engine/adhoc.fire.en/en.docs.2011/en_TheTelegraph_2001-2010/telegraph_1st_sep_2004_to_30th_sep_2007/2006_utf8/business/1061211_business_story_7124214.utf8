 CII ups growth forecast to 8.6%

 OUR BUREAU

 Dec. 10: The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) sees GDP growth crossing 8.6 per cent, buoyed by a stellar performance by the economy during the first two quarters of the current fiscal. The chamber had earlier projected a growth of around 8 per cent. 

 Buoyant economic performance in the first half of the current year has set the stage for the GDP crossing the 8.6 per cent growth mark for the current fiscal, the latest quarterly report on the state of the economy issued by the CII said.

 Growth prospects of the economy are likely to be largely insulated from the current global slowdown as the major chunk of Indian production is consumed domestically, the report said.

 According to the CII, the industry would improve its performance to 9.1 per cent from the earlier 8.5 per cent in the next half of the fiscal. Services may witness a slight slowdown to 9.7 per cent from 10.2 per cent in the same period last year.

 Growth may slow down in the second half of the current fiscal to 8.2 per cent from 8.4 per cent during the corresponding period of the previous fiscal.

 The CII said the economy would have performed much better had it not been for the climbing inflation and interest rates.

 Inflation is driven mainly by supply-crunch, particularly of basic items, and it can be handled by ensuring availability of items which are in short supply, rather than by hiking interest rates, it said.

 On fiscal consolidation, the report says it should be revenue-driven as there is a large scope to widen the tax base by moderating its rate and increasing the tax base.

 China GDP

 Chinas GDP will grow at 10.5 per cent this year, reflecting stable growth and a soft landing of the worlds fourth largest economy, the countrys top planner said, reports PTI.

 The GDP is estimated to exceed 20 trillion yuan (about $2.56 trillion) this year, up 10.5 per cent over 2005, Ma Kai, minister of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) said. In 2005, Chinas GDP hit 18 trillion yuan. 

 Ma said the countrys economy has been developing fast this year with efficiency and low inflation. Stable economic operations have benefited the people and will power future development.

 He said the Chinese people have benefited from the steady and fast development.

 NIIT hungry for foreign buyouts

 URVASHI KAUL 

 Reaching out

 New Delhi, June 6: NIIT Technologies is looking at acquisitions in the US and Europe, targeting insurance, banking and financial and retail software firms. However, the company will go shopping only after consolidating its recent acquisitions. 

 The recent buyouts, too, have been in similar sectors, senior NIIT officials said. 

 Europe is a heterogeneous market, which is very under-penetrated. We want to use that to our advantage to be leaders there in these niche areas, said Arvind Thakur, NIIT chief executive officer. 

 Unlike the bigger companies that are offering services in all areas or verticals, we plan to focus on a few selected industry verticals, which includes insurance, financial and banking, retail, travel and transport, he added.

 The four verticals contribute about two-thirds of NIIT Technologiess revenue, he said. NIIT Technologies recently bought a 51 per cent stake in Room Solutions, a $25-million UK-based software company. 

 Room Solutions focuses on the commercial insurance market, including IT solutions to the customers of Lloyds, the largest re-insurance market in the UK.

 The managed IT services market is about $80 billion, according to a Nasscom and McKinsey survey. 

 At present, much of our services are in the advanced development solutions space. However, we see huge potential for us to grow in the managed IT services as less than 5 per cent of this market has been addressed, said Thakur.

 The Indian software services exporter also plans to increase its presence in the US. NIIT had acquired Data Executives International, a US insurance software company. One of the first acquisitions was Osprey, an accounting and office software solutions provider.

 NIIT Technologies is the only Indian mid-sized IT company that has presence in this space.

 The company posted revenues of Rs 625 crore in 2004-05. Forty three per cent of NIITs revenues in the last fiscal came from their European market, while the US contributed 40 per cent. 

 Thakur said, Once we consolidate our recent acquisitions, we would look at more strategic partnerships in these verticals. We have a group of people who are handling the task of identifying potential targets in these segments.

 NIIT will also start operations in Greater Noida by scaling up the employee strength to 12,000 in three phases. It employees 3,500 people now. 

 NIIT is operating from its centres in Delhi, Bangalore, Mumbai and Calcutta.

 Japan gears up to raise interest rates

 GARY DUNCAN

 Looking ahead

 London, July 10: Financial markets are steeling themselves for a widely expected move by the Bank of Japan on Friday to end the countrys long-running zero interest rate policy with its first rate rise in nearly six years.

 In a vote of confidence that Japan has finally vanquished the deflation menace that has dragged down its economy since the late 1990s, the BoJs policymaking committee is expected to lift its key overnight call rate, probably to a level of about 0.25 per cent.

 Expectations that the central bank will move to end the zero interest rate policy, sometimes known as the Zirp, have mounted since this months closely watched Tankan survey of Japanese business conditions pointed to an increasingly buoyant economic situation.

 The survey showed confidence among large Japanese companies outside the manufacturing sector climbing to a 14-year high last month, while confidence among big manufacturing groups also rose to robust levels.

 In a further boost to optimism over the outlook, the Tankan results showed that Japanese companies are preparing to unleash a powerful wave of investment spending. Large firms are reported to be planning to raise investment by almost 12 per cent year-on-year during 2006, which will mark the fastest pace of increase since 1990.

 The anticipation of a move by the BoJ after its two-day policy meeting on Thursday and Friday was fuelled at the weekend by reports in Tokyo that the central bank has concluded that all the conditions are in place for it to raise rates from their effective zero level. 

 The likely step will mark a further move by the BoJ to return monetary policy to more normal conditions after five years of emergency measures to counter deflation. In March the central bank ended a five-year-long policy known as quantitative easing, under which it flooded the Japanese financial system with excess funds to create ultra-easy credit conditions to stimulate growth and end deflationary price falls.

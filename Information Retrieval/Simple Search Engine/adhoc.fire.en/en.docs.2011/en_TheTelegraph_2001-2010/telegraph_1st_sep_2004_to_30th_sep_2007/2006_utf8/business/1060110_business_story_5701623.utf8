 Federal eyes Ganesh Bank

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Jan. 9: Kerala-based Federal Bank has shown interest to acquire Ganesh Bank of Kurundwad Ltd, which was placed under moratorium last week.

 Soon after the Federal Bank expressed its interest, the Reserve Bank of India placed a draft scheme of amalgamation of Ganesh Bank with the Federal Bank. The banks have time up to January 21 to consider the scheme. The RBI has also invited suggestions and comments from the public, including the banks shareholders, depositors and creditors.

 The RBI will take a view on the future setup of Ganesh Bank soon thereafter.

 In an urgent board meeting on Sunday, the Federal Bank decided to convey its willingness to acquire Ganesh Bank.

 In its submission, the Federal Bank has proposed to pay the depositors fully. The RBI has examined the proposal received from the Federal Bank keeping in view its financial parameters, retail network and synergies as well as strategic advantages. 

 Taking into account the interest of depositors of Ganesh Bank as well as the banks strengths and weaknesses, the RBI has prepared a draft scheme of amalgamation of the Ganesh Bank with the Federal Bank, a central bank statement said.

 Ganesh Bank was placed under an order of moratorium on January 7. The order is effective up to April 6 or an earlier date if an alternate arrangement is in place. 

 Ganesh Bank was placed under moratorium after being given time to arrange for infusion of capital as also to explore other options for its future set-up, RBI said in a statement.

 As Ganesh Bank was unable to raise the required capital, the RBI had to exercise the option of compulsory merger under section 45 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949. The banks net worth and capital adequacy ratio turned negative, resulting in the erosion of depositors money.

 Regarding Federal Banks interest in acquiring a troubled bank, sources said apart from improving the Kerala-based banks geographic presence, the price that is likely to be paid will also be insignificant.

 Federal Bank has a network of more than 500 branches in the country with a dominant presence in Kerala with more than 300 branches. At the end of March 31, 2005, it had total deposits of Rs 15,193 crore and disbursed loans worth Rs 8823 crore. 

 The bank has a strong franchise in retail banking and NRI business and SME segments. Recently, Federal Banks merger talks with Lord Krishna Bank were called off due to differences in valuation.

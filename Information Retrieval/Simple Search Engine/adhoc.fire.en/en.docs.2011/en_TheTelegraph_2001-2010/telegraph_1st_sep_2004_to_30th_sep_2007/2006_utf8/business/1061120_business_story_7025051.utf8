 VW faces Andhra legal ire

 Hyderabad, Nov. 19 (PTI): The Andhra Pradesh government today said it will look at various options, including proceedings against Volkswagen (VW) for breach of agreement, after the German automaker decided to shift its proposed plant to Chakan near Pune.

 We will look at various options, including proceedings against Volkswagen for breach of promise and agreement, Andhra Pradesh chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy said.

 He said Volkswagens decision was disappointing, and we are left with no option except legal recourse.

 Volkswagen had earlier decided to set up its Indian plant in Vishakhapatnam. The project got embroiled in a controversy over corruption allegation involving the then Andhra Pradesh industry minister B. Satyanarayana and the firms Indian agent.

 Following this, the state government ordered a CBI probe into the allegations and assured the German auto firm all necessary help in setting up the plant. However, Volkswagen has decided to move the plant to Pune. Meanwhile, Opposition parties, including the TDP and BJP, today demanded the resignation of the chief minister and a judicial probe into the deal.

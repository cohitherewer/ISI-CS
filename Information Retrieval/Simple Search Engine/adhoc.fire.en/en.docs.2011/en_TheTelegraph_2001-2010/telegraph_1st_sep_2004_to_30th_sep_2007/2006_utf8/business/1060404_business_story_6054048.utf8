 New Delhi, April 3: Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd (Bhel) has recorded a 70 per cent jump in net profit at Rs 1,621 crore for the financial year ended March 31, 2006. The public sector company had clocked a net profit of Rs 953 crore during the previous fiscal. 

 Announcing this here today, Bhel chairman and managing director Ashok Puri said the turnover of the company had shot up by 39 per cent from Rs 10,336 crore in the previous year to Rs 14,410 crore for 2005-06. 

 The earning per share of the company has gone up from Rs 38.95 to Rs 66.2.

 The companys exports reached a record high of Rs 3,348 crore, which was six times the value of the corresponding figure in the previous year. 

 An upbeat Puri said the company expects to maintain this growth momentum as the order inflow of Rs 18,931 crore during the year has taken its order book to Rs 37,500 crore for execution in 2006-07 and beyond. 

 Puri said to capitalise on the emerging opportunities for setting up new power plants, the manufacturing capacity of the company was being enhanced from 6000-mw at present to 10000-mw per annum by 2007. 

 He said the Central Electricity Authority has indicated that 67000-mw power generation capacity needs to be added during the eleventh plan period from 2007 to 2012.

 The government is also facilitating the setting up of ultra mega projects. Besides, nuclear energy projects are likely to get a boost after the signing of co-operation agreements with the US and France. This together with increased activity in the industrial sector would provide enormous opportunities for Bhel to grow, Puri added. 

 The chairman said Bhel was also looking out to acquire a small to medium sized company in one of the advanced countries which would give it access to the latest technology in the power sector. 

 He said the Bhel tie-up with Alstom would now enable it to produce power plants of 800-mw capacity, which operate with super critical parameters.

 Puri disclosed that Bhel was also proceeding with its own R amp; D efforts and as many as 84 patents were filed during the year. Bhel has until now filed 339 patents out of which 26 have been granted so far while the rest are in various stages of processing. A turnover of around Rs 1,064 crore was achieved during the year through products and systems developed in-house, he added.

 Banks keen to try out alliance game

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Sept. 17: The alliance between Corporation Bank, Indian Bank and Oriental Bank of Commerce is likely to spur more banks, particularly the nationalised ones, to explore such relationships rather than go for a merger.

 Bankers said the next few months could see some action on this front with the strong banks in one region striking alliances with those in other territories.

 Geography, however, will not be the sole reason that would drive these banks. A bank, which does not have expertise in one domain, could look for an association with another that has strength in that particular area.

 For instance, one bank will have expertise in a certain sector like SME, but it may not be strong in retail. Such an entity could strike an alliance with another bank, which is an expert in that area, a banker said.

 It is felt that the SBI group may not enter into such relationships since the countrys largest bank shares close synergies with its seven associate banks. However, the others who may explore options of an alliance include Allahabad Bank, Vijaya Bank, Canara Bank, Bank of Baroda, Uco Bank and Punjab National Bank.

 The alliance between Corporation Bank, Indian Bank and Oriental Bank could be a trend setter. Given the current competitive times, it makes more sense for a bank to tie up with another even as a legal merger looks difficult. There could be not only geography but also product synergies that could emanate, says Vishal Goyal, banking and finance analyst at Edelweiss.

 There are 28 public sector banks (including SBI and its associates) among 91 major scheduled commercial banks in the country. An analysis of the trend in banking over the past few years shows that though their share in aggregate deposits is close to 80 per cent, nationalised banks lag behind their foreign counterparts and those in the private sector in other parameters, which include the cost of funds.

 The alliance between Corporation Bank, Indian Bank and Oriental Bank of Commerce will have a network of 3,600 branches, 1,800 ATMs, a total business size of Rs 2,03,900 crore and a customer base of over 33 million.

 There is a faint hope among analysts that the alliance could also be the first step by nationalised banks to explore a legal merger route.

 Though K.N. Prithviraj, chairman and managing director of Oriental Bank of Commerce, ruled out a merger of the three banks, sources said few other PSU banks would keenly observe the progress of the alliance.

 Other banks would see how the alliance goes ahead. They may enter into such arrangements, which may later end in a merger, a senior official from a public sector bank said.

 Bankers feel that as unions did not object to the alliance, it is possible that they would not object in the case of a merger.

 Sasken snaps up Finnish firm in cash deal

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 26: Sasken Communication Technologies have acquired Botnia Hightech Oy of Finland in an all-cash deal of 35.5 million euros.

 The company plans to set up centres of excellence for hardware and mechanical design, which will be headquartered in Finland with competency centres across the globe, including Bangalore.

 Such centres will involve additional recruitment and the average cost per person in a new facility comes to around $5,000, said Prabhas Kumar, chief operating officer, Sasken Communication Technologies.

 A privately-held company with two subsidiaries ? one for hardware and mechanical design and the other for software design ? Botnia will now operate as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sasken, he said.

 The acquisition will give Sasken access to Botnias client base in Europe and is in line with the companys strategy to focus on tier I customers for services.

 Based in Kaustinen in Finland, Botnia is one of the leading suppliers of hardware, software, mechanical design and testing services to leading mobile handset vendors. It also has operations in Denmark and Germany.

 Botnia reported revenues of $22.4 million, or 17.7 million euros, for the year ended April 30, 2006. Sasken expects the company to maintain the similar rate of growth. 

 For itself, Sasken has set a growth rate of 30-33 per cent for fiscal 2006-07, Kumar said.

 The modalities of funding the acquisition are yet to be worked out. It would be a mix of debt and equity. Recently, Sasken secured the approval to raise up to $50 million.

 The company has put in place a special team, with representatives from Botnia and Sasken, to work out the integration of the two companies. The team will start work immediately after the deal is closed. The business plan will be in place in the next one month, Kumar said.

 As far as Botnias 230-strong workforce is concerned, Sasken is contemplating cross movements between the two companies and locations depending on the personnel and expertise required for particular projects, he added.

 The acquisition will help Sasken scale up its product portfolio. Sasken with 2,800 employees in India, China, Germany, Japan, Mexico, Sweden, the UK and US, caters to a large network equipment manufacturers (both wireless and wireline), semi-conductor manufacturers and terminal product vendors.

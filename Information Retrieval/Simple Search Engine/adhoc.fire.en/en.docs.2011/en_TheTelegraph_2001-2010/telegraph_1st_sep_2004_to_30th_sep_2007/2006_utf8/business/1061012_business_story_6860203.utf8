 Spotlight on sensex swing

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Oct. 11: Its the start of another earnings season and the big question is: will the sensex continue to sizzle?

 The mood in the market is truly bullish about a stream of good corporate results but marketmen jib at the prospect of reading the tea leaves and forecasting which way the sensex will move over the next three weeks.

 Overall markets are close to their all-time highs and the current valuations leave little headroom. The top end of our sensex target range indicates an upside of just about 7 per cent from the current levels, said Rajat Rajgharia, head institutional research at Motilal Oswal Securities. 

 The sensex opened much higher at 12446.72 and surged to 12514.18 on strong buying in index heavyweights, particularly Infosys. However, as the day progressed it started declining and slumped to a low of 12301.51, settling 10.28 points lower at 12353.49. 

 Market watchers say though the overall sentiment is bullish on corporate numbers, the indices will remain lacklustre unless the results beat the street expectations by a wide mark. 

 Most of the participants are expecting pretty strong numbers from the companies and this has been factored into the stock prices. Thus, only better-than-expected figures will give a further boost to the market, said Rajgharia. 

 We are not going to witness the run-up in the indices as was witnessed in May and June. The market will react more or less like it did in todays trading session, said a portfolio manager. 

 After a sharp correction in the first quarter of the fiscal, the markets rallied sharply in the second quarter. However, the sensex has slipped an aggregate of 25.64 points in the past three days. 

 The markets are expected to sustain at the current levels with the earnings expectations and any slip in numbers will see a slide in the market. However, there does not appear much upside from the 12000 level and the next push will come from policy initiatives by the government, said Sanjay Sinha, head of equities, SBI Mutual Fund.

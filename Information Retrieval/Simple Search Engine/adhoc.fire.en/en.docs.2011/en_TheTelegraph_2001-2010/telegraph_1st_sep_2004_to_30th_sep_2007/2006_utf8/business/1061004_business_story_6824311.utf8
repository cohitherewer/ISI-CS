 Federal Bank on the prowl

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Oct 3: Kerala-based Federal Bank is keen to take over another bank. 

 After acquiring Ganesh Bank of Kurundwad in Maharashtra last month, the bank is exploring options for a buyout in Tamil Nadu or Karnataka. 

 Ganesh Bank has only 35 branches. However, we hope to make some inroads in Maharashtra by taking it over. We are now looking to buy a bank immediately in Tamil Nadu or in Karnataka to increase our presence in these two states, said M. Venugopalan, chairman and managing director of the Federal Bank. 

 Though the Kerala bank wants to acquire a bank within the current financial year, it doesnt have a concrete proposal on hands. We are looking for one, we havent come across any meaningful proposal, Venugopalan said.

 Meanwhile, South Indian Bank, another bank from Kerala, is also scouting for a bank.

 The board has formed a sub-committee to look out for a small or a mid-sized entity. 

 South Indian Bank is the second largest bank in Kerala after the Federal Bank. There are two more private banks in the state, Dhanalakshmi Bank and Catholic Syrian Bank. 

 Federal Bank plans to have more branches. We will open 29 new branches this year, Venugopalan said. The bank has 508 branches, with 330 in Kerala. 

 He said the bank had networked all its branches and would implement the core banking solution in 15 branches from November. The aim was to have 750 branches in three years, Venugopalan added.

 The bank also plans to have a representative office in Abu Dhabi, its first outside India, and to set up a subsidiary there in a joint venture with a local bank.

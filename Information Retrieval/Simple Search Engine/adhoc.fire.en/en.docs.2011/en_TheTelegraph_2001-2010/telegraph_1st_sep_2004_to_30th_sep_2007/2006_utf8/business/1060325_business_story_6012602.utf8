 Insurers divided on sensex party

 Mumbai, March 24: The stock market is on fire with the sensex flirting with 11000 ? but insurers seem to be divided on whether or not to jump on to the rollercoaster.

 Life insurers are shovelling loads of cash into the bourses but the non-life insurance companies seem to be very squeamish about enhancing their exposures to the equity markets.

 The non-life insurance companies are allowed to invest up to 55 per cent of their investible funds in market securities subject to restrictions imposed by the insurance regulator. But their equity market exposure was a piffling 4.6 per cent in fiscal 2005, says a report prepared by Fitch.

 ?For non-life insurance companies, it is the primary objective to have sufficient funds to settle claims and not to generate returns on the funds,? said Abhijit Gulanikar, head of investments, Bajaj Allianz General Insurance. 

 ?Given the volatile nature of equity, we do not wish to assign large amounts to build an equity portfolio. We don?t want to run the risk of compulsory liquidation of the securities when the market is not at its best just when we have to pay out large claims,? he said.

 The 55 per cent limit on investments in market securities in the case of state-owned insurers seems substantial. ?But,? says an industry analyst, ?the 55 per cent represents the market-to-market value. The book value would be much less.?

 Life insurers ? led by behemoth Life Insurance Corporation of India ? have no such misgivings. LIC has announced its plan to increase equity investment from 8 per cent of its total investment in the last fiscal to 10 per cent by the end of March this year. 

 ?It is our thumb rule to invest around 8 to 10 per cent of our investible funds in equities based on our internal budgets. We have decided to increase our exposure in the current fiscal,? said D.K. Mehrotra, managing director of LIC. 

 The Fitch report says that in fiscal 2005, private life insurers investments in equities have risen noticeably and now range between 20 to 30 per cent of policyholders funds, up from 15 to 20 per cent in financial year 2004. 

 The equity exposure of HDFC Standard Life and Bajaj Allianz has shown a sharp increase in fiscal 2005 compared with the previous fiscal. While HDFC increased its exposure in equity to 28.2 per cent in fiscal 2005 from 10.2 per cent in 2004, Bajaj Allianz?s went up from 14.7 per cent in 2004 to 34.2 per cent in 2005. ICICI Prudential and Birla Sun Life also increased their equity exposure. However, SBI Life and Kotak Old Mutual saw some decline. 

 Despite the recent increase in exposure, the contribution of the domestic insurance companies as a whole to the stock market remains small. This is evident from the fact that though unit linked insurance products make up the bulk of the products sold in the private life insurance sector, investment in equities had until last fiscal remained low and below the level permitted by IRDA. 

 ?Overseas markets are dominated by unit-linked products. In India, investors prefer traditional products, thereby requiring more stringent and cautious investment practices, quot; said Mehrotra.

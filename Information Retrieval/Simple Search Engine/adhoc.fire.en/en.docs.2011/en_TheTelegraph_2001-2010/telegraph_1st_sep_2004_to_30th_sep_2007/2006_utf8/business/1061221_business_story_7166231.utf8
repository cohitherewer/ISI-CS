 Sobha Developers sizzles

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Dec. 20: The appetite for real estate in equity markets seems far from over. 

 Sobha Developers made a strong debut on the bourses today. It was listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) at Rs 1,111.25, a premium of 73.63 per cent over its issue price of Rs 640.

 However, interest at these levels could not be sustained. With volatility on the bourses, the share closed at Rs 968.75 on the BSE, up 51.36 per cent from the issue price. It had a market capitalisation of close to Rs 8,000 crore.

 The scrip hit a high of Rs 1,179 and a low of Rs 918.10 while 73.38 lakh shares changed hands in the counter on the BSE.

 The 30-share sensex today settled 41.80 points lower at 13340.21. It swung 335 points during the day from an intra-day low of 13232.56 to a high of 13568.09.

 The IPO of the real estate and development company was subscribed over 100 times.

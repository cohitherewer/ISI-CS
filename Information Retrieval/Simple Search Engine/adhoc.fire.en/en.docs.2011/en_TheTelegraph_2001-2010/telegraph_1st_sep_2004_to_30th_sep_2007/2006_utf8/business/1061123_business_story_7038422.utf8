 Calcutta, Nov. 22: JCB India Limited, a subsidiary of global construction equipment company JC Bamford Excavators, has invested Rs 280 crore in its facility coming up in Pune. It expects to roll out heavy line products like excavators reloading shovel trucks from April 2007.

 The company expects its Rs 1,500-crore turnover to grow by 25 to 30 per cent this fiscal.

 We have invested Rs 130 crore to set up the facility in Pune and another Rs 150 crore to put in place the heavy manufacturing line. We plan to initially roll out 20 equipment per month from the Pune facility from April 2007. After that, we would import only the telehandler range while the compaction equipment required for road construction would be manufactured from Pune, said Vipin Sondhi, managing director, JCB India.

 JCB has seven plants in the UK and one each in Brazil, China and the US.

 Last fiscal, the company invested Rs 150 crore to upgrade its Ballabgarh plant. 

 The company sold around 7,600 units of construction equipment last year.

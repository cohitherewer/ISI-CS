The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 IndiGo set to take off in August

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 13: IndiGo Airlines plans to start flying from next month. Its launch flight will be to Guwahati followed by flights to Imphal, Pune, Bangalore, Calcutta, Hyderabad and Chennai.

 The airline, which had placed orders for 100 single-aisle Airbus aircraft, will get its first two planes in July-end and August-end. IndiGo plans to induct six Airbus 320s by the year-end. These aircraft are being taken through operating sales leases, said IndiGo president and CEO Bruce Ashby in a tele-conversation with The Telegraph. 

 We have chosen Guwahati for our launch flight because we think it is a good route and government norms say we have to fly a number of flights to the Northeast or to Kashmir, said Ashby. IndiGo plans to have fares that are affordable, ideally in the range of Rs 2,500-3,500 ... though this will vary depending on the length of the route.

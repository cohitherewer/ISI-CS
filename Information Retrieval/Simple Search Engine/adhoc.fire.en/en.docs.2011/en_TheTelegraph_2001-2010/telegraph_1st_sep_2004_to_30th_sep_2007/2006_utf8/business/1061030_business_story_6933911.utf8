 Q amp;A

 Tax quotient 

 I have five Senior Citizens Savings Scheme accounts of Rs 26,000 each which are issued separately at different dates. Do I have to pay any TDS considering the gross receivable interest stands at Rs 12,100.

 Ajoy Chakraborty, Hooghly

 If you are an income tax payer, you will have to pay the TDS. If you are not a tax payer, you can submit a declaration for non-deduction of TDS in a specified form.

 Look before signing

 I approached a stock broker to open a demat account. The broker asked me to sign some legal papers. Is it mandatory to sign these stamp papers? Is there any risk involved?

 Sanjay Debnath, Dhanbad

 Yes, to open a demat account you need to undertake some legal declaration and agreement and sign stamp papers for this. However, some brokerage houses are also pursuing their customers sign a power of attorney for sale of securities held in the demat. Once the power of attorney is signed, they dont give the instruction slips for sale of stocks. This can pose a problem. So, before signing on any legal paper verify what document it is.

 Tax on maturity 

 I have an NSC of Rs 82,000 purchased in March this year for tax rebate. During the current year, the accumulated interest will qualify for benefit under section 80C. Will it be added to income for calculation of tax? Is the maturity amount taxable?

 Tapan Kumar Guha, Dum Dum

 The accrued interest will be considered as other income and will be added to your total annual income for calculation of income tax liability. However, since the interest in NSC is reinvested, it will qualify for deduction from total income under section 80C. The entire amount on maturity is not taxable, only the interest component is.

 To dad, with love

 My son wants to give me some money through cheque. Can he transfer the money by cheque from his account to my account in the same bank? Will it attract gift tax?

 Tapan Kr. Roy, Hooghly

 Your son can write you a cheque. The transaction will not attract any gift or income tax.

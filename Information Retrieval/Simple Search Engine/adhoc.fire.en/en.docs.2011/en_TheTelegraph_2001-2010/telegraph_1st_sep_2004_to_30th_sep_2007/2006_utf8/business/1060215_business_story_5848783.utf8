 RCVL closer to listing

 OUR BUREAU

 Mumbai/Delhi, Feb. 14: Reliance Capital Ventures Ltd (RCVL), the demerged undertaking of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) which is now under the control of Anil Ambani, today filed a revised information memorandum with the stock exchanges for listing the company. RCVL is likely to be listed by this weekend.

 Sources in the Anil Ambani group did not comment on the specific changes made in the information memorandum, though they admitted that there were some amendments.

 The company will be the first of the four demerged companies to list. 

 After RCVL, the Reliance-ADA group plans to list Reliance Energy Ventures Ltd (REVL) during the week starting February 20, Reliance Natural Resources Ltd (RNRL) in the subsequent week and finally Reliance Communications Ventures Ltd (RCoVL) in the week starting March 6.

 The listing of these four companies would be followed by a merger of REVL and RCVL with the utility major Reliance Energy Ltd (REL) and Reliance Capital Ltd (RCL) respectively. 

 Airport documents

 The Centre today agreed to provide to Reliance Airports Developers official documents relating to the airport modernisation bidding process, including the entire technical evaluation report of all the bidders submitted by the evaluation committee.

 Appearing for the Centre, additional solicitor-general Gopal Subramanian said the government was also ready to provide minutes and report of the inter-ministerial group and the full report of the government review committee.

 However, he said it could not provide minutes of the meetings of the empowered group of ministers, at which the division bench of Justice Tirath Thakur and Justice B.N. Chaturvedi asked him to file reasons for not doing so.

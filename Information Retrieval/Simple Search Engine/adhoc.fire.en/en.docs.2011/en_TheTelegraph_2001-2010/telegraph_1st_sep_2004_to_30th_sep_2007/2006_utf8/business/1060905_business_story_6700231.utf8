 Hyundai, Maruti in ad slugfest

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Hot on Heels 

 New Delhi, Sept. 4: The battle for marketshare between Hyundai Motors India and Maruti Udyog has taken an ugly turn with both companies complaining to the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Commission (MRTPC) about comparative advertisements, which they feel have damaged their reputations.

 The latest twist in the battle is a spat over a full-page advertisement that Maruti took out last month with the tagline: Buy it. Run it. Or sell it. A Maruti Suzuki is unmatched value.

 The advertisement compared the products of several car companies on mileage, maintenance costs and resale value and it rubbished the rivals.

 However, Hyundai was the only carmaker that complained, saying it was misleading and disparaging. A suit filed by the Chennai-based car manufacturer came up before the MRTPC today and was put off for hearing on September 27.

 Gearing up

 The commission directed Maruti to reply within two weeks. However, it declined to grant a stay on further publication of the advertisement.

 Maruti officials declined to divulge their plan of action. We are yet to study the papers properly. We will soon take a stand on it, an official said.

 During the proceedings, Hyundais counsel alleged that the advertisement was a case of unfair trade practices and was intended only to mislead consumers.

 Hyundai also submitted to the commission a letter of the rating agency on whose findings Maruti based its campaign. The agency had said the findings were to be confined to auto companies only.

 It was confidential and not to be used for such purposes ... The study was restrained only to auto companies and not for the public... It was also not meant to show low of the competitors, the agency said in the letter.

 This is not the first time that such a spat occurred. Last year, the two firms fought over advertising brochures of Hyundai titled Xing ahead of Swift.

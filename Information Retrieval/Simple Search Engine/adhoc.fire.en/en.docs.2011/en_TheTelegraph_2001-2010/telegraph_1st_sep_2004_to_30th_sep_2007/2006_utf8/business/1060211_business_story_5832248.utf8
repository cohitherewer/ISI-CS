 Industrial growth slows in December

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Feb. 10: The countrys industrial growth rate slowed down to 5 per cent in December from 8.9 per cent in the same month previous year, according to official statistics released today. 

 The performances of the manufacturing sector, which has a significant weightage on the index of industrial production, and mining and electricity were a drag on the industrial growth rate.

 The manufacturing sector grew by only 5.9 per cent compared with 9.8 per cent in December 2004. Mining sector recorded a negative growth of 1.8 per cent against 4.8 per cent in the same month a year ago.

 The electricity sector recorded a meagre growth of 2.9 per cent in December compared with 4.5 per cent a year ago. The decline in the growth of electricity is of particular importance as it has a cascading effect on manufacturing and agricultural sectors, which get crippled due to power shortages. 

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has emphasised the need to boost power generation and step up mining activity as the country is facing an acute shortage of coal, which has an adverse impact on the power sector. 

 During the first nine months of this fiscal, the index recorded a slower growth rate of 7.8 per cent compared with 8.67 per cent in the same period last year.

 The manufacturing sector reported slight drop in its growth rate at 8.9 per cent during the April to December period against 9.2 per cent in the same period last year.

 Mining sector posted a growth of only 0.4 per cent during this period compared with 5.1 per cent a year ago, while electricity recorded a lower growth of 4.8 per cent against 6.4 per cent in April-December 2004.

 Inflation drops

 The rate of inflation fell to 4.30 per cent for the week ended January 28 from 4.51 per cent in the previous week mainly due to cheaper manufactured items. 

 However, there was an increase in the in prices of food and non-food products.

 The wholesale price index (WPI) inflation fell by 0.3 per cent to 196.4 points as metals, including steel, some edible oil, vegetables, eggs, fish-inland, pork, fodder, sunflower, gur, chemicals and acid became cheaper. The index was 188.3 points in the year-ago period.

 However, rice, tea, soyabean, tobacco, sooji, atta, sugar, maida, imported edible oil, textiles, paper, cement and cables became costlier.

 The government has revised the final inflation to 4.44 per cent for the week ended December 3 from the provisional figure of 4.55 per cent, while WPI stood corrected at 197.6 from 197.8 points.

 The government has stated that it is committed to keep the inflation rate below the RBIs projection of 5-5.5 per cent for the current fiscal. However, it has agreed that this will depend on oil prices as pass-through effect of the surge in global oil prices is not complete.

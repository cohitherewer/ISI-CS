 Calcutta, Oct. 18: Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) has set up a dedicated Japan offshore delivery centre (J-ODC) in Calcutta. It now employs 100 people, which is set to double in the next two years.

 The global offshoring business is estimated to increase from $624 billion in 2005 to $827 billion by 2010 and Japan is set to have a world-wide market share of 13 per cent.

 We have been servicing Japanese clients from Calcutta and the number has increased by three times in the past three years. Currently, we service 35 Japanese firms. We want the J-ODC to evolve into a centre which will create additional capabilities to service a country with specific business environment and culture requirements like Japan, said N. Chandrasekaran, executive vice-president and global head sales and operations, TCS.

 The potential offshoring business market in Japan is estimated to be $32 billion. The combined offshore business volume of China and India is set to reach $5 billion by 2010.

 This centre would be supported by a local sales and marketing office in Yokohama.

 TCS globally employs 1,200 people who service Japanese companies from various locations around the world, of which 100 are in Calcutta. The number is expected to double in the next two to three years.

 The TCS Calcutta offshore centre has been providing excellent software engineering support to Citibank Japan. The J-ODC, coupled with the existing operations high resource retention and knowledge management skills, would add significant value to our relationship, said Shinobu Chibu, vice-president, Citibank Japan.

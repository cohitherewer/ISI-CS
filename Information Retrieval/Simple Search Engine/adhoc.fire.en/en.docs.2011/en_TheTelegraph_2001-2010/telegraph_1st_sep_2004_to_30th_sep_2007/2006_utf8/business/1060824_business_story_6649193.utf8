 FM forces delay in Maruti stake sale

 Dev amp; Chidambaram: 

 Advisory role

 New Delhi, Aug. 23: Finance minister P. Chidambaram has advised his heavy industries counterpart, Santosh Mohan Dev, to keep on hold the proposed sale of the governments 10.2 per cent stake in Maruti for the time being. He wants Dev to wait for an opportune time to sell the stock.

 Dev, who met the finance minister yesterday, said Chidambaram was in favour of waiting for some time before deciding to offload the governments remaining stake in Maruti.

 The finance minister said this was not an opportune time to sell the stake, he said.

 He said the finance ministry was in favour of getting the maximum out of the stake sale. 

 Sources said the finance ministry wants the stock to stabilise before taking a final call on the matter.

 We have offered to the finance ministry to sell the 10.27 per cent stake that the government has in Maruti. Now it is up to them to take the call, Deb said on Monday.

 Based on the current market price of the companys scrip, the government is likely to raise around Rs 2,500 crore if it decides to sell now. 

 As all divestment in public sector companies has been called off for now, the Maruti stake sale could offer the much-needed resources to the government.

 The government has raised nearly Rs 1,567 crore by divesting 8 per cent of its stake in Maruti Udyog in January this year. 

 Bids from eight banks and financial institutions were accepted by the empowered group of ministers at an average price of Rs 678.24 per share. 

 The floor price for the offer was set at Rs 620 apiece. 

 The shares were sold with a lock-in period of one year and this condition is likely to be retained this time around as well. 

 A total of 36 banks and financial institutions had bid for the shares. 

 The Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), which was allotted 1.68 crore shares, had been given the largest share of the stake being divested followed by the State Bank of India, which was given more than 39.29 lakh shares. 

 Before that, the government had held a 45.8 per cent stake in Maruti, comprising 13.23 crore shares of Rs 5 each.

 While the government has shelved the move to sell the shares of public sector companies, Maruti does not come under this category as it was in the joint sector and the government now has only a minority stake of 10.27 per cent. There is no government director on the board of Maruti either.

 Withdrawal magic

 Its a smart way to grow your money: take money out of your PPF account and reinvest it. Srikumar Bondyopadhyay tells you why

 Thirty-two-year-old Sushanto Sanyal is wondering where to get the money to invest in tax-saving instruments this year. Living costs are higher, while savings are lower every year. Add to it new responsibilities marriage, a new home, and social commitments. He surely has his plate full. 

 How will he save in time to put in money in his ongoing investments like the PPF (public provident fund) and LIC, leave alone fresh infusion in mutual funds or stocks? While leafing through his PPF passbook one day, he has a brilliant idea! 

 Sanyal had opened his PPF account with the State Bank six years ago. He now plans to withdraw a part of his PPF accumulation every year starting next year and reinvest the money in the same account.

 Whats the big idea?

 At present, almost all fixed income tax-saving schemes an NSC, bank fixed deposits for five years or more and the PPF give the same rate of interest of 8 per cent per annum. But the PPF scores over the other two because while the interest accrued in a tax-saving bank fixed deposit or an NSC are subject to income tax following the repeal of section 80L, the interest in the PPF is tax exempt under section 10 (11) of the act.

 A taxpayer will have to show every year the interest income from an NSC or bank fixed deposits as other income in his or her income tax return, but doesnt need to do so for a PPF account. A taxpayer, however, can claim deduction on the annual interest income from an NSC or fixed deposits under section 80C to the extent to which it is reinvested (read, not withdrawn).

 When judged from the tax angle, the PPF gives a better return of 12.36 per cent (over a period of 15 years) compared with 10.84 per cent in an NSC or bank fixed deposits.

 Different strategy

 But Sanyals strategy revolves round another merit of the PPF, which an NSC or tax-saving bank fixed deposits dont entail. This is the withdrawal facility.

 One can withdraw money from ones accumulated sum in a PPF account after completing five years from the end of the financial year in which the account was opened, that is, from the seventh year of opening a PPF account.

 However, there are certain restrictions. First, this withdrawal can be made only once a year and second, one can withdraw up to 50 per cent of the balance in ones account at the end of the fourth year immediately preceding the year of withdrawal or at the end of the just preceding year, whichever is lower.

 You may argue at this point that the recycling of the investment in tax-saving bank fixed deposits or in an NSC can also be done after every five or six years. 

 The advantage in the PPF is that while you can withdraw your money (subject to the limit) every year from the seventh year onwards, you cannot do it in an NSC or a bank fixed deposit. 

 Every year you will have to buy a National Savings Certificate or invest money in a fixed deposit. Simply put, Sanyals strategy becomes self-sustaining after six years of regular investment.

 A back-of-the-envelope calculation shows that if you invest Rs 28,767.52 lump sum every year in a PPF account, you will be able to generate enough corpus in your account in four years to withdraw Rs 70,000 every year from the seventh year onwards (see Table 2). 

 Now, by reinvesting the withdrawal sum in the same account, you can take care of your tax savings. 

 Time it right

 It should be kept in mind that the PPF interest is calculated on the minimum balance between the fifth day and the last day of a calendar month. Hence, you should synchronise your withdrawal and reinvestment in the PPF account accordingly.

 Whatever money you save, you can now put in high-yielding instruments such as equities and mutual funds.

 The PPF contributions can also be made in instalments (not more than 12 in a year) and these earn a simple interest of 8 per cent. For this, you only need to invest Rs 2,297.75 every month to take care of your tax. 

 However, this strategy works till PPF withdrawals remain tax exempt.

 Once tax is imposed on the withdrawals, it may defeat the strategy.

 Microsoft takes 10% in TCS China 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Nov. 23: Microsoft Corporation has bought a 10 per cent stake in TCS China, a joint venture among Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and three Chinese companies. Microsoft is expected to pay a little over $1 million for its stake. 

 The tripartite investment agreement among TCS, its Chinese partners, which are supported by the National Development and Reforms Commission (NDRC), and Microsoft was signed here today at an Indo-Chinese business forum, which was earlier addressed by Chinese President Hu Jintao. 

 According to TCS, the entry of Microsoft follows the grant of the business operating licence to TCS China. It also signals the culmination of the process to get the joint venture operational, after the MoU was signed in June last year.

 Investors need to make minor changes

 GUEST COLUMN-DHIRENDRA KUMAR

 Budget 2006 is a low-impact 

 budget, perhaps one of the lowest impact budgets in recent 

 years, at least as far as investing is concerned. The broad 

 contours of taxes, both personal and capital gains, remain 

 the same. The subtext of the budget is clear ? things are 

 okay and all thats needed is minor tinkering and adjustments. 

 Im not sure whether this 

 will prove to be the correct approach to take in the long-term 

 but since history has proven more finance ministers to be 

 guilty of doing too much than of doing too little, one should 

 be thankful to P. Chidambaram.

 For investors, its an easy 

 budget to understand simply because not much has changed. 

 The only changes are in areas of investing overseas and 

 in getting tax breaks on bank deposits. 

 The government has expanded the 

 scope for investing abroad through mutual funds. While in 

 theory investing overseas is a good way to diversify, it 

 is unlikely to invoke too much interest while Indian markets 

 continue to do better than foreign ones. 

 In the years since mutual funds 

 were first permitted to do this, a grand total of two fund 

 have been launched which invest abroad and these two funds 

 currently manage a pitiable Rs 14 crore ($3.1 million) of 

 assets. So the government has raised the investment limit 

 from $1 billion to $2 billion in an area where the actual 

 investor interest is to the tune of $0.003 billion. What 

 can I say? Governments are like this only. 

 It is interesting to see that 

 while removing the earlier caveat of funds being able to 

 invest in foreign companies with an Indian connection, the 

 government is now guiding such investment towards exchange-traded 

 index funds.

 The provision for bank deposits 

 being a tax-saving investments is quite interesting. To 

 a certain type of individual, being able to get a tax rebate 

 by making a bank deposit may appear to be an attractive 

 option. Although such an investment is convenient, I dont 

 consider this to be a very progressive step. The lack of 

 such options was actually turning investors to more productive 

 channels like equity schemes of mutual funds. 

 My feeling is that this is a move 

 that results from lobbying by the banks rather than any 

 genuine investor need but lets see how things work 

 out. Compared to PPF and NSC, such bank deposits will offer 

 lower returns and effectively, almost as much illiquidity.

 It doesnt appear to be a 

 very attractive option unless banks are able to offer special 

 rates for such deposits. Another change that impacts is 

 the further hike in the securities transaction tax. No one 

 seems to mind it while the going is good. However, whenever 

 the markets turn downwards, investors are going to find 

 it painful to pay the government its pound of flesh even 

 in loss-making transactions.

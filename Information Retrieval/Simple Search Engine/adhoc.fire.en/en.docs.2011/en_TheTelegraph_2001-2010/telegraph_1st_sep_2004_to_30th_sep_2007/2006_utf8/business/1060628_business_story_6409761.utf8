 Jet to move apex court

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, June 27: Jet Airways today said it would move the Supreme Court to transfer the cases relating to Sahara Airlines pending before Bombay High Court and the Lucknow district court. 

 A Jet statement said, A transfer petition is also being filed by Jet Airways before the Supreme Court.

 Any comments on the merits of the controversies between the parties would, therefore, be inappropriate and improper, it added.

 The company today reiterated that the deal with Sahara Airlines had expired and, therefore, was no longer valid.

 The controversy arose after Sahara Airlines submitted before the Lucknow district court that the deal was still subsisting, while Jet said it had expired.

 For commercial reasons, and in the interest of Jet Airways and its family of shareholders, the management decided not to extend the time after the expiry of the share purchase agreement on June 21, the statement said.

 Jet said commercial transactions had their own time frame based on financial and other techno-commercial compulsions. 

 Due to this, the time limits in the share-purchase agreement have expired before the conditions precedent have been met, the airline said. 

 Regarding the credentials of its management in the wake of the controversy over the delay in granting of security clearance to Jet chairman Naresh Goyal, the statement said, The latest communication by the government has laid the controversy to rest ? nothing more needs to be said. 

 Goyal received security clearance by the home ministry a day after the deal lapsed.

 Calcutta, Aug. 9: Keeping with the recent trend in industry, Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund has launched a five-year closed-end equity scheme, called Birla Long Term Advantage Fund. 

 Tata Mutual Fund and ING Vysya Mutual Fund had launched similar schemes, and UTI Mutual Fund is also planning to offer one.

 The recent spurt in closed-end funds is because Sebi has disallowed fund houses to amortise the initial issue expenses in their new open-ended schemes from April 1 this year, said Raghvendra Nath, who is the vice-president (marketing) of Birla Sun Life Asset Management Company. 

 Mutual funds are allowed to charge up to 6 per cent of their initial issue expenses to investors. For all open-ended schemes, mutual funds used to amortise the expenses over a period of five to seven years and charge no entry fee or an entry fee between 2 per cent and 2.5 per cent. Only a few would levy a fee for exit before a specified time, say one year. 

 Institutional and large investors took the advantage of this practice of expense amortisation and would enter and exit an open-ended scheme in quick successions. These quick churns would not only distort investments of retail investors but would also force fund managers to look at a short-term investment horizon, Nath said.

 Now that Sebi has disallowed mutual funds to amortise initial issue expenses for open-ended schemes, mutual funds would have to load their expenses (up to 6 per cent) during the new fund offer period for open-ended scheme. 

 Following this directive of the market regulator, no fund house has come out with a new open-ended scheme so far. 

 However, since mutual funds can amortise their initial issue expenses over the period of their closed-end schemes, a few of them have come out with this new category of equity schemes that are closed during the initial three or five years after which they would automatically be converted into open-ended schemes. 

 Such a plan will not only help us amortise the issue expenses over the closed-end period but will also help fund managers focus on long-term prospect of its investment portfolio and give a better return to investors, Nath said.

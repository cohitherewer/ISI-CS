 Calcutta, March 7: Blaupunkt, maker of car music systems, is planning to launch 30 branded stores across the country by the end of this year. 

 The German company, which has already set up 11 such stores in the country, has opened its twelfth branded outlet and the first in the city. Blaupunkt will also open another shop in north Bengal. 

 Blaupunkt operates in India through a dealer and distributor network and the branded shops are being opened through a franchisee network involving the distributors, said Ajay Sahney, deputy general manager, sales (car multimedia), Blaupunkts India operations. There are currently 650 dealers and 31 distributors of Blaupunkt systems, he added. 

 The company already has a presence in Bhubaneswar catering to the eastern region. Now, by setting up branded shops in this part of the country, Blaupunkt plans to strengthen its foothold in the eastern market and bring in the state-of-the-art car entertainment retailing technology to the customers.

 The car entertainment retailing market in India is worth Rs 600 crore with the grey market still comprising about 60 per cent of it. 

 The share of the organised market, which is growing at a rate between eight and nine per cent, is worth Rs 240 crore. Blaupunkts market share is 21 per cent of this.

 The investment per branded shop is estimated around Rs 10 lakh, which is shared by the company and the distributor, Sahney said.

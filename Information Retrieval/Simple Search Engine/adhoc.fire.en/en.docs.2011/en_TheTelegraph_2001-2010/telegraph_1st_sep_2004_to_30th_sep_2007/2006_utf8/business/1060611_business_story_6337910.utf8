 Calcutta, June 10: The Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC) has embarked upon an expansion plan that would put in place more power generation capacity in the next five years than the corporation has done in its 50-year history.

 Unfolding the Rs 19,000-crore plan, DVC chairman Ashim Kumar Burman said the corporation would commission 1,000 mw of capacity in 2007, while another 1,500 mw will be ready by the end of 2009. 

 DVC will also set up three greenfield units of 1,000 mw capacity each in the 11th Plan period.

 At present, it has close to 2,900 mw capacity, including 140 mw of hydel power and 82.5 mw of gas turbine.

 ?While 1,000 mw at Mejia in Bengal and Chandrapura in Jharkhand will be ready by September 2007, work on another 4,500 mw is also being taken up,? Burman said today.

 Going by the industry thumb rule of Rs 4 crore a megawatt, DVC will invest Rs 18,000 crore for putting up the new units. Moreover, it has forged two joint ventures ? Maithon Power Ltd with Tata Power and BPSCL with SAIL ? with a combined capacity of 1,500 mw.

 The corporation is planning to fund these projects with a 70:30 debt equity ratio.

 Goodyear to shut UK plant

 Shutters down

 New York, April 5 (Reuters): The Goodyear Tire amp; Rubber Co said on Wednesday it plans to close an automobile tyre plant in Britain and a bicycle tyre plant in Poland in order to achieve combined annual savings of up to $50 million (?28 million).

 The worlds largest tyre company, which is based in Akron, Ohio, said it has begun discussions with union employees as a step towards shutting its Goodyear Dunlop UK passenger tyre factory in Washington, northeast England.

 In addition, the company said it would discontinue production of bicycle tires and inner tubes at its plant in Debica, Poland.

 The company estimated the plant closures would lead to elimination of about 1,500 jobs, create annual cost savings of between $40 million and $50 million and result in a charge of between $105 million and $115 million.

 About $55 million of the charges will be taken in the first and second quarters of 2006, the company said in a statement.

 The companys global fourth-quarter sales edged up 2.1 per cent to $4.93 billion, supported by price increases and the sale of more expensive tires.

 To bolster earnings, the tyre maker had said last September it would continue a multi-year restructuring of job cuts, plant closings and sales of non-core businesses.

 Cant really bank on them

 If 

 you think the tax-saving bank fixed deposits are a better 

 option than the National Savings Certificate or Public Provident 

 Fund, heres a googly for you. 

 Though many scheduled banks, particularly the private sector ones such as IDBI, South Indian Bank and Karnataka Bank, are offering a comparable rate of interest (8 per cent) on their five-year tax-saving deposits, the devil can be found in the details of the latest notification of the finance ministry. 

 The notification not only prohibits encashment of these deposits before five years but interest income has also been made taxable. The tax will be deducted at source by the bank if the interest income on a single deposit account exceeds Rs 5,000 a year. 

 However, you can provide a self-declaration in Form G or Form H for non-deduction of tax at source if your gross annual income, including interest income, is not taxable. 

 In other words, this means that while you can claim a deduction up to an investment of Rs 1 lakh (inclusive of all investments under section 80C) in a five-year tax-saving bank fixed deposit, you will have to pay a tax on the interest income if you invest more than Rs 62,500 (assuming that the rate of interest is 8 per cent).

 There are other restrictions, too. For example, such a fixed deposit can be opened in joint names, but the tax benefit will accrue only to the first holder. 

 So, if both the spouses are working, they will have to open separate accounts to avail of the income tax benefit under section 80C.

 However, the most damaging clause is that a tax-saving fixed deposit certificate cannot be pledged to get a loan.

 You can take a loan by pledging your NSCs, but you will not get a loan against the tax-saving FD, even from the bank with which you have opened the account.

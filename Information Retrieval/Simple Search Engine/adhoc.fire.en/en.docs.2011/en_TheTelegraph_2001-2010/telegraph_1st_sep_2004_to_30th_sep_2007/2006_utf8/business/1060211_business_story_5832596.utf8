 Govt charts flight path to counter Reliance

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY AND SINGH GYANANT KUMAR 

 New Delhi, Feb. 10: The government feels that Anil Ambani-run Reliance Airports Developers, which has challenged the bidding process for Delhi and Mumbai airport modernisation, should have no reason for discontent as it was considered in the final round of bidding, despite being disqualified in the very first round on technical grounds. The government had reconsidered its proposal after the bidding conditions were relaxed. 

 In an affidavit filed before the high court here, the civil aviation ministry said Reliance came into the zone of consideration only after the empowered group of ministers (EGoM) relaxed the technical qualification benchmark from 80 per cent to 50 per cent.

 The civil aviation ministry has contended that Reliance was actually disqualified at the stage of technical pre-qualification (for Delhi airport) and it would have been arbitrary to qualify only one of the disqualified bidders. 

 In fact, a fair chance was given to the petitioner (Reliance) to compete with other disqualified bidders for the Mumbai airport, the ministry said.

 The government statement goes on to say Reliance Airports cannot place itself on a par with the winner of the bidding process as GMR was the only technically qualified bidder.

 Even GMR was asked to match the highest financial bid for Delhi airport in a bid to get maximum revenue and protect the financial interests of the public.

 Reliance had initially scored well with consultants but the Sreedharan Committee found fault with the numbers and the matter was referred to the empowered group of ministers (EGoM). The EGoM had the option of either calling for fresh bids or finding a way to go ahead with the process without compromising with the standards. 

 As fresh bids would take a minimum of two years, the EGoM decided to send three unqualified bidders along with GMR to the next round to ensure that there was adequate competition in the financial bids.

 The government decided against inviting fresh tenders as modernisation of the two airports is top priority. According to an Airports Authority of India forecast, passenger traffic was slated to increase from 59.3 million in 2004-05 to 173.2 million in 2016-17.

 The terms of evaluation were changed after due deliberation and in a reasoned manner and in the greater public interest, the government said. Reliance has, however, alleged that the terms and parameters of evaluation and award of tenders were changed at the last moment in an arbitrary manner without any notice.

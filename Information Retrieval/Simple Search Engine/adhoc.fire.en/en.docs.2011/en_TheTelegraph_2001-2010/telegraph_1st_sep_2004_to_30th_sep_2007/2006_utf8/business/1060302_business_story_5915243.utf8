 Twin tremors in telecom network 

Tatas serve notice to Birlas

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, March 1: The battle at Idea Cellular has intensified with the Tatas issuing a notice to the Birlas terminating their shareholders agreement and offering to buy out the Birlas 50.14 per cent stake in the countrys fifth largest mobile telephony company.

 The Tatas accused the Birlas of breaching the shareholders agreement by revealing confidential information (financial data) relating to Idea Cellular at an analysts presentation held by one of its group companies.

 Serving the termination notice on February 27, group company Tata Industries Ltd (TIL) said, We shall proceed to purchase the shareholding within 90 days of this notice at the default price. 

 The default price was not specified. 

 Although officials from Tata Industries were unavailable for comment, sources close to the group said they were well within the rights to do so as the laws gave them a period of 90 days to buy out a partners stake if they could prove that the shareholders agreement had been violated.

 Just last week, the AV Birla group had written to the Union communications ministry to clarify a rule in the telecom policy that it claimed barred the Tatas from holding more than 10 per cent in Idea Cellular when it already held a universal access service licence for CDMA operations provided by group company Tata Teleservices. 

 The Birlas move was designed to force the Tatas to sell their 48.14 per cent stake. At that time, the Tatas had said the rule did not apply to them and added they were holding out for a proper valuation.

 But the Birlas move to force the Tatas out of the company has prompted Bombay House to dig in for a long battle. 

 Senior Birla officials also declined to comment on the latest development. But the Birlas are sticking to their stand that the Tatas are violating licence conditions that prohibit a telecom player from owning a stake in two competing operations in the same circle. They also termed the latest allegation of TIL as baseless.

 A couple of years ago, the AV Birla group had indicated that it would divest its shareholding in Idea as telecommunications was not part of its core businesses.

 Differences between the partners came to a head when the Birlas wrote to the department of telecommunications (DoT) asking it to intervene and force the Tatas to reduce their stake in Idea Cellular below 10 per cent. The Tatas, however, said this would be done only if they obtained a fair value.

 The Tatas also said TIL held less than 10 per cent equity in Tata Teleservices (around 4.45 per cent) and, therefore, did not violate the regulatory norms at all. The group has also maintained that though TIL is a shareholder in Idea, it is not the promoter. Moreover, the company is not a promoter of Tata Teleservices or Tata Teleservices (Maharashtra) Ltd.

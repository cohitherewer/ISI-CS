 Bengal sees merit in Intel wireless offer

 SOHINI MOOKHERJEA

 Calcutta, Dec. 7: Intel India has placed a proposal before the Bengal IT department to create wireless hotspots in certain areas of the city.

 The company would also suggest ways to participate in the higher education system in the state.

 We had received a proposal from Intel during BangaloreIT, the national IT exposition in which the state participated. The proposal said Intel would create wireless hotspots (wi-fi) in those areas of the city where the company had more customers. I had thought of Sector V in Salt Lake as a prospective place for a wireless area. But after the ideas put forth during the Infocom, I am considering mooting the idea of extending it to an academic institute as well, Bengal IT minister Debesh Das said on the sidelines of Infocom 2006.

 The initial infrastructure investment would be borne by the company while it would draw up a revenue model depending on the number of customers in the area under consideration.

 The IT minister met Intel officials yesterday and, besides wireless connectivity, discussed the companys willingness to participate in higher education.

 They have certain modules, the details of which would be provided subsequently, which could be integrated with the engineering courses. We have asked them to look at the undergraduate level instead of post-graduate, Das added.

 Intel is awaiting the central governments semiconductor policy announcement to take a call on setting up an assembly and testing (A amp;T) unit.

 The fabrication units, which are based in the US, Ireland and Israel and involves investment of billions of dollars, are not what we are looking at for India. In India, we would look at assembly and testing facilities, investments in which will require a couple of million dollars, said Ramamurthy Sivakumar, country manager, Intel Technology India.

 Telecom top guns cross swords

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Sept. 20: The war of words between Reliance Communications Ltd (R-Com) and Videsh Sanchar Nigam Ltd (VSNL) is escalating. 

 Days after R-Com alleged that VSNL was violating its commitment under the FLAG Europe Asia Cable system, the Tata group today hit back in strong words, stating R-Com was using the platform of stock exchange to issue false statements that are defamatory.

 In doing so, VSNL, however, said both the parties are liasing for the upgrade of the Mumbai cable landing station by FLAG. 

 The upgradation of its capacity has been a major point of difference between the two telecom firms. Landing station of the FLAG cable system is with VSNL and R-Com has been seeking more capacity, a proposal that VSNL was initially reluctant to accept.

 VSNLs contention is that according to the construction amp; maintenance agreement, which governs cable systems run by a consortium, more capacity cannot be allotted.

 Another sore point between the duo relates to the access charge. R-Com had alleged that VSNL was levying a charge to the customers of FLAG Telecom, which are 166 times higher than what VSNL charges from customers in the Tyco Global Network (TGN) landing station at Los Angeles.

 The differences between the two reached an interesting stage when the Arbitration Tribunal of the International Chamber of Commerce, International Court of Arbitration, ordered VSNL to allow FLAG access the FEA cable landing station.

 City port keen on Shanghai blood-ties

 New Delhi, Aug. 6: The Calcutta port has indicated that it is ready for a twinning arrangement with the Shanghai port in China, as the riverine ports have the capability to manage common problems.

 If the plan is implemented, Chinese sailors visiting the city can avail of special facilities at the port and vice versa.

 Under a twinning arrangement, towns or cities or ports from geographically and politically distinct areas are paired to foster human contact and cultural links.

 A shipping ministry official told The Telegraph that all ports have been asked to identify foreign peers for twinning, and Calcutta responded with the request to explore this possibility with Shanghai.

 The issue is expected to be taken up by the Indian Ports Association, which co-ordinates closely with the ministry.

 The city port authorities, however, have said the role and responsibility of ports to provide facilities should be identified before making any commitments.

 Shanghai is situated on the Ningbo and Calcutta on the Hooghly, with ships from the open sea sailing up the river.

 The two ports face similar problems such as silting that necessitates regular dredging to maintain the draft of the river .

 The river regulatory measures for the Calcutta port is on hold as its impact on the neighbouring Kulpi port is yet to be reviewed.

 Since Shanghai also faces similar problems, Calcutta can leverage on their expertise. The Chinese have advanced systems in managing their inland waterways which will benefit Calcutta.

 Twinning dates back to 1944 when the city of Vancouver in Canada entered into an international arrangement with the Soviet city of Odessa. This was based on aiding Odessa during World War II.

 The American Sister Cities programme was started in 1956 by President Dwight Eisenhower. Sister Cities International is now a non-profit citizen diplomacy network. Its aim is to increase global co-operation at the level of municipalities, to promote cultural understanding and to stimulate private business and economic development. 

 The practice of town twinning was developed in Europe after World War II to promote understanding among European people and cross-border projects of mutual benefit.

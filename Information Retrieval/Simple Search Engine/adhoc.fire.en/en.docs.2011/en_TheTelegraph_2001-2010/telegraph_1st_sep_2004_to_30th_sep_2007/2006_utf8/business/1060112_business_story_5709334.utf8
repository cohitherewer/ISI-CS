 Aviva denies US deal

 London, Jan. 11 (Reuters) : Aviva Plc, Britains biggest insurer, denied on Wednesday a report it was poised to buy US rival AmerUs Group Co for $3 billion, but did not rule out the prospect of it making an acquisition.

 Aviva confirms that it has not made such a proposal and no discussions with AmerUs are taking place, Aviva said in a brief statement in response to a report in The Guardian.

 In line with its strategy for growth in the international long-term savings market, Aviva continues to review value-driven inorganic growth opportunities in the major global long-term savings markets.

 By 1040 GMT, Aviva shares were up 0.5 per cent at 718-1/2 pence, not far from Mondays near four-year high of 736p, to value the company at ?17.3 billion ($30.5 billion).

 Analysts said the muted reaction to the news reflected that a big insurer such as Aviva is likely to be looking at a number of potential deals at any time, although they said it could signal an increased interest on the competitive US market.

 I dont think it would be a ridiculous move and for Aviva with its good M amp;A track record it could make a lot of sense but youve got to bear in mind youre not going to buy much of the industry for what youve got to spend, said Marcus Barnard, insurance analyst at SG Securities.

 Theres always risk going into a market like that. Its very competitive, but it does give you scope to expand. 

 International intentions

 Aviva has leading market positions in many European countries, but sluggish growth in its core UK market has prompted it to expand in Europe and China, India and elsewhere in Asia.

 It generates about half its profits from outside the UK and around 62 per cent of life profits come from abroad, although this is almost all from Continental Europe.

 The insurer has a US business, based in Boston, providing annuity and other business, which reported life and pensions sales of ?393 million in the third quarter of 2005, up 54 per cent from a year earlier.

 But business is regarded as lacking scale in the United States. The Guardian report, citing unnamed banking sources, said the move for AmerUS was launched after Aviva failed to agree a merger with UK rival Prudential Plc.

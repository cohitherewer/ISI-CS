 Volvo India plans big

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Nov. 21: Volvo India Pvt Limited, part of the $30-billion Swedish auto engineering firm, is all set to start manufacturing construction equipment by 2010.

 The construction equipment division in India, which is worth $5 billion globally, now imports the entire range of 40 models from South Korea, Canada and Sweden.

 Our business is growing at an average of 30 per cent year-on-year with 100 per cent in the first year. This would entail manufacturing some models locally to cater to the growing Indian market. But it is still at a drawing board stage with details being finalised, said Mrityunjaya Singh, vice-president of Volvo construction equipment division.

 Volvos facilities for its trucks and buses occupies only one-third of the existing 120-acre $60-million factory near Bangalore.

 The construction equipment operations would therefore use the existing premises.

 The total construction equipment market is set to cross 10,000 units this year.

 The excavator market is set to reach 4,500 units this year with a growth of 40 to 50 per cent for the next three years. Volvo has 12 per cent of this dominant construction vehicle market and expects it to increase to 20 per cent during the same period.

 There are no pollution rules for construction equipment but the government plans to extend the Euro II norms to these vehicles by 2008 and Euro III by 2011.

 The Swedish auto firm has also made presentations to the Automotive Research Association of India on emission norms in other Asian countries.

 Volvo, however, has construction equipment vehicles that are Euro II and III compliance. In the 15-tonne wheeler loader market, Volvo has a market share of 40 per cent.

 The governments stress on national highway projects and the mining sector would lead to major growth in Jharkhand, Bihar, Orissa and south Bengal.

 Volvo has a 100 per cent market share in the articulated haulers that have been conceptualised by the company. Each articulated hauler costs Rs 2.5 crore.

 There are 45 such trucks plying in the country now and we expect to sell another 17 units in 2006, Singh added.

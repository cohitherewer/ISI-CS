 Ryanair seeks 3-m damage

 Leary: To right a wrong

 London, Aug. 25 (Reuters): Low-cost carrier Ryanair has submitted a claim for just over 3 million in compensation from the government after stepped-up airport security forced it to cancel flights.

 Ryanair lodged the claim which it said reflected losses from cancellations and lost bookings over the week of August 10 to 16, the airline said in a statement.

 However, the department for transport said Ryanair had no legal grounds to seek compensation. Other airlines said they had no plans to seek damages from the government. 

 The government had introduced hand luggage restrictions and heightened security screening at the airports following what it said was a bomb plot, forcing airlines to cancel hundreds of flights. 

 The longer these additional, yet nonsensical and ineffective security measures remain at the UK airports, then the more UK passengers and visitors will suffer unnecessary queuing, delays and flight cancellations, Ryanair chief executive Michael Leary said in the statement. 

 Ryanair said it would donate any compensation received to charity. 

 The DFT said Ryanair had no legal grounds to sue. 

 We continue to face a serious security threat and we are not going to compromise security a DFT spokesman said. 

 Aviation security measures are directed under the Aviation Security Act 1982, which does not have any provisions for compensation.

 Ryanair approached British Airways, Virgin Atlantic and other airlines last week urging them to sue the government for compensation.

 Google issue raises over $2 bn 

 Money matters

 San Francisco, April 1 (Reuters): Web search company Google Inc said its public offering of 5.3 million shares had priced at $389.75 each, raising about $2.07 billion.

 Google, based at Mountain View in California, had said it would sell as many as 5.3 million shares to offset the impact of its inclusion in the widely held Standard amp; Poors 500 Index. 

 The sale represents about 2.7 per cent of Googles float, the number of shares that are available for public trade.

 It will be the second follow-on offering Google has made since it went public in August 2004 at $85 per share. Googles share price has more than quadrupled since then, resulting in the amount raised from the two secondary offerings outstripping proceeds of the public issue.

 In the offer, a total of 19.6 million Google shares were sold for $1.67 billion. A year later, Google raised $4.2 billion through the sale of another 14.2 million shares, triggering speculations it was building up a war chest to enter new markets.

 Goldman Sachs is the sole underwriter of the offering, and shares will be offered primarily to index funds whose portfolios are based on stocks included in the S amp;P index, Google said in a Wednesday filing with securities regulators.

 Google, which has expanded into Web-based services such as e-mail, blogging and chat among others, said it would use the proceeds from the sale for general corporate purposes. 

 Last week, Standard amp; Poors said Google would replace oil and gas producer Burlington Resources Inc. at the end of March.

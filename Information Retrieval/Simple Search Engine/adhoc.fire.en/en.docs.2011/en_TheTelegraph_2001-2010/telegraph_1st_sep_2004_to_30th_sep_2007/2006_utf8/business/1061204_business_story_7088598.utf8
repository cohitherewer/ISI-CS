 TCS wins $100-m China deal

 Beijing, Dec. 3 (PTI): Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) has won a landmark deal worth $100 million from the Bank of China (BoC), industry sources said today.

 It is being dubbed as one of the major IT-related deals signed by a Chinese bank ahead of the opening up of the countrys banking sector to foreign competition by December 11 under Beijings commitment to the World Trade Organisation (WTO), industry sources said.

 It is a major breakthrough for Indian IT companies, who are aggressively expanding their operations and bidding for government contracts in China, a software expert said. Under the just-inked deal, TCS will provide a range of banking solutions to BoC. However, the details are not yet known. 

 All major Indian IT firms, including TCS, Infosys, Satyam, Wipro, NIIT, and i-flex have set up bases in China, servicing their multinational customers in the country and targeting the huge domestic software market.

 Govt to focus on three options for selloffs

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 New Delhi, Nov. 12: The Congress-led government, which has set up a group of ministers to kick-start the stalled divestment process, wants to focus on sale of residual stakes in PSUs already privatised, small sale of shares of non-navratna companies and auction off terminally sick PSUs. 

 The government has deliberately restricted the PSUs to be considered for divestment to avoid confrontation with the Left and other allies as happened in the case of Neyveli Lignite that put divestment on the backburner.

 However, the government has kept vague the method to be taken to sell the residual stakes. The Attorney-General, in the case of Bharat Aluminium, had said the residual stake was open to all and not just the company which had earlier picked up the strategic stake.

 Senior government officials, working on the strategy, said the big-ticket residual share sale on the cards is of Videsh Sanchar Nigam Ltd (VSNL). A call option is due in February 2007 on the governments 27.92 stake in VSNL. 

 If the government follows the Attorney-Generals recommendations, it can make a public offer for the VSNL shares rather than offer them to the Tatas. Similarly the residual shares of Hindustan Zinc, where Sterlite had picked up a strategic stake, may also be sold to the public.

 The officials said a formula for sell-offs of non-navratnas is on the works. The government intends to make an approval from the Parliament mandatory if after divestment the government holding in a non-navratna falls below 51 per cent. 

 In the case of terminally sick PSUs, the Left and other allies have agreed in the CMP to shut down or sell off such PSUs. The future of these sales, however, is in a limbo because of the Prime Ministers directive against divestment. Officials said any move on sell-offs would start after the Prime Minister or the Cabinet agrees to restart divestment.

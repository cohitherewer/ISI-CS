 Prime Focus lists below offer price

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, June 20: The choppy secondary market has taken its toll on the primary.

 After the weak listing of Deccan Aviation, Prime Focus today listed at Rs 374, down 10.3 per cent from its issue price of Rs 417.

 The scrip closed at a 22 per cent discount to the issue price at Rs 325.35 after an intra-day low of Rs 291.

 On the day it was listed, Deccan Aviation closed at Rs 98.85, down 33 per cent from its issue price of Rs 148. It closed at Rs 86.30 today.

 The 30-share Bombay Stock Market sensex today shed 175 points to end the day at 9,822.52, snapping a three-day winning streak, largely influenced by sluggish Asian trend amid negative FII activity.

 Earlier, Prime Focus had to extend the date and lower the price band of its initial public offering like Deccan Aviation citing poor secondary market conditions that affected investor interest in new offerings. 

 Prime Focus, whose issue was to close on May 31, had extended the date to June 3 and revised the price band downwards to Rs 417-475.

 Reliance Capital holds a 14.53 per cent stake in Prime Focus. 

 Apart from Reliance Cap, Adlabs owns about 4.66 per cent, while Rakesh Jhunjhunwala and Rekha Jhunjhunwala hold about 8.5 per cent stake. 

 The remaining is held by promoters and persons acting in concert. 

 Prime Focus has recently acquired a 55 per cent stake in the UK-based VTR Group for ?4.7 million. 

 The deal has a cash component of ?4.2 million and ?0.5 million worth of equipment acquired. 

 Prime Focus, a post-production and visual effects service house, has garnered revenues worth Rs 33.57 crore for the first nine months ended December 31, 2005 and a profit after tax of Rs 11.04 crore.

 Less of Fed hike spurs market rally

 The conditions seem to be in place for another rally. Friday saw a big rally in the US market and the S amp;P 500 gained the most last week since the week ended November 5, 2004. The reason: lower-than-expected growth in US second quarter GDP, which came in at an annual rate of 2.5 per cent compared with a growth rate of 5.6 per cent in Q1. That?s a clear indication that the impact of higher US interest rates is being felt in the economy.

 But won?t slower US GDP growth mean lower earnings for companies and hence be negative for markets? Moreover, since the US has been one of the main engines of global growth, won?t the slowdown hurt the world economy? In fact, slowing global growth has already been discounted, as shown by the latest Merrill Lynch survey of global fund managers.

 Also, BCA Research says, ?The bottomline is that slower US economic growth heralds a moderation in global growth as well, the signs of which are just beginning to emerge.?

 So why was the US market celebrating? Simply because it now expects that the US Fed will stop raising interest rates. Interest rate futures now indicate that the chances of an August rate hike are down to 32 per cent. US 10-year bond yields went down below 5 per cent and the dollar weakened. The end of the US interest rate cycle should also be good for emerging market stocks and we?re already seeing the beginnings of a rally. Markets feel that the soft landing for the US has been achieved and we?re back to the Goldilocks ?not-too-cold, not-too hot? economy, which has been so good for stocks in the past three years. The IMF too has forecast a soft landing for the US, ?with growth easing to potential and inflation remaining contained?. India, with its strong domestic economy and lower dependence on exports, would benefit, as the RBI too may now pause in its rate hiking campaign.

 Unfortunately, things are not so clear-cut. Simultaneously with the lower GDP figure, data also showed that US inflation has been higher. That raises the spectre of stagflation ? a combination of low growth and high inflation, which will be the worst of all possible scenarios. However, some economists have brushed aside the higher inflation numbers as a lagging indicator and even the Fed appears to believe that inflation will go down because of slowing growth. Whatever be the long-term outlook, the current optimistic reaction could herald a decent bounce in the Indian market as well.

 Oil prices

 So far as the outlook for inflation is concerned, much depends on crude oil prices. Will oil prices remain above $70 a barrel? A recent research report issued by Bernstein Associates argues that inventories of crude oil in the OECD nations are the highest in 14 years. What?s more, while global spare crude oil production capacity was very low last year, it will improve substantially this year and by 2008, spare capacity will almost reach 2003 levels.

 On the other hand, the report also says that the spike in oil prices has been fuelled by very large investments in commodity funds. It says that the incremental growth or funds flow in these commodity funds ?during 2006 will account for almost $21.3 billion, of which $7.7 billion will flow into crude. To place this in perspective, if matched by physical barrels, this would account for almost 120 million barrels annually or 320,000 barrels of daily demand. This is bigger than China?s (oil demand) growth and would be the largest source of incremental worldwide demand.?

 In other words, it?s not just the ?fundamentals? that are driving oil prices and much depends on fund flows into the crude oil market.

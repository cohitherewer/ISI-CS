 Nuke shadow on Iran pipeline deal 

 S.P.S PANNU 

 Pipe dream

 New Delhi, March 9: India will attend a tripartite meeting on the Iran-Pakistan-India gas pipeline in Tehran next week with the shadow of UN sanctions looming over Iran and the nuclear issue emerging as a sore point in the relations among the three countries.

 Cornered over its nuclear ambitions, Iran has not hesitated to complain about the Indo-US nuclear co-operation deal and this is bound to impact the relations between New Delhi and Tehran.

 While the inter-country pipeline is being viewed as a commercial project and talks will continue, its security is of paramount importance to India. 

 With Pakistan also upset over the new nuclear status that India has been accorded by the US, there is a simmering discontent in the region. This could slow down the pace of the talks.

 In spite of the apparent bonhomie, the price at which the gas will be sold has emerged as a thorny issue. While Iran wants to benchmark it with the current global crude rates, India is looking at the price from a long-term perspective and wants to benchmark it with coal, which is a substitute at the moment.

 Petroleum secretary M.S. Srinivasan, who will be leading the Indian delegation, has candidly stated that the price at which countries were willing to export natural gas has emerged as a key issue. ?This will determine the success or failure of the talks,? he had said at the Asia gas partnership summit last month.

 He had also sounded a note of caution on the proposed transnational pipelines. 

 While these pipelines offer the facility of early monetisation, they are vulnerable to the geopolitics of the region as well as the long time involved, which can range between 25 and 60 years.

 Since India is at the tail-end of the pipeline, it may end up investing close to $50 billion as huge power projects will be set up based on the gas as fuel. Industries dependent on this power will also be hit in case of disruptions. 

 India, therefore, faces a higher risk in the venture than the other two participants and needs to tread cautiously. 

 Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia also said the talk of a huge demand for natural gas in the country is quite ?meaningless? unless it is available at an affordable price.

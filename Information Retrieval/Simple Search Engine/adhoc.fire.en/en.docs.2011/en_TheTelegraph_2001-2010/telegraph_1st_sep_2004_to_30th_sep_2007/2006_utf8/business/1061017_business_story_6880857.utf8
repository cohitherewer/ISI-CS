 EMI sees dip in revenue

 London, Oct. 16 (Reuters): EMI Group expects first-half revenue to decline 3 per cent, but remains confident it can meet full-year expectations thanks to albums from Robbie Williams, Norah Jones and other second-half releases. 

 The worlds third-largest music company, EMI said in a trading update on Monday first-half underlying profit before tax is expected to fall 34 per cent to about 27 million, though its results are heavily skewed to the second half.

 The London-based company, also home to artists Coldplay and Gorillaz, said its recorded music division was on track for a 4 per cent decline in revenue in the six months ended September 30 on a constant currency basis. 

 EMI said the decline was due to its release schedule, which is expected to be stronger in the second half than in previous years, with albums from Jones, Williams, Joss Stone and Moby. 

 Its a tough comparative compared to last year when they already had Coldplay out, Numis analyst Paul Richards said, referring to the band which shipped around 7.5 million copies of their last album quot;X amp;Y quot; to stores. quot;We see full-year pretax profits of around 170 million and the first half is only 27 million, quot; he said. 

 Digital music which is replacing some of the declining sales of CDs represented about 9 per cent of the EMIs recorded music division revenue, compared with 11 per cent for the industry. 

 The planned artist releases, continued growth in digital revenues and delivery of the announced cost savings, are expected to drive strong growth in underlying revenues and profits in the second half of the financial year, quot; the company said. 

 EMI, which ended takeover talks with Warner Music Group this year, said revenue from its music publishing unit would be in line with last years first half, with the operating margin seen rising to about 25 per cent. 

 The $4.6 billion (2.5 billion) takeover talks with Warner Music were broken off after a European court annulled approval of the 2004 merger of Sony Corp.s Sony Music and Bertelsmanns BMG. The ruling cast doubt on whether an EMI-Warner deal would pass regulatory muster, and the companies abandoned efforts to buy one another until there was more clarity from competition regulators.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 BoB hints at internal restructuring

 SRIKUMAR BONDYOPADHYAY

 Calcutta, April 11: Bank of Baroda (BoB) plans to take over the primary dealership business from its wholly-owned subsidiary ? BoB Capital Markets Ltd.

 We may take over BoB Capitals primary dealership division, though nothing has been finalised yet, a senior official told The Telegraph. The official, who is also a director of BoB Capital Markets, said the investment banking business would continue to remain with the subsidiary.

 Primary dealers are appointed by the Reserve Bank as intermediaries-cum-underwriters for government securities and treasury bills both in the primary and secondary markets and they have access to the call money and repo markets. BoB Capital Markets got the RBI approval for primary dealership in April 2002 and reported a net profit of Rs 11.37 crore in 2003-04. However, it suffered a net loss of Rs 19.40 crore last fiscal following a turbulent treasury market.

 BoB Capital Markets had appointed Credence Analytics (I) Pvt Ltd to do its treasury businesses. BoB Capital Markets has been dealing mainly in government securities. However, it has recently sought (software) solutions for the derivatives market from us, said Tushar Nanodkar, who is looking after the companys accounts in Credence Analytics 

 Bank of Baroda plans to merge all its subsidiaries ? BoB Cards, BoB Capital Markets and BoB Housing Ltd ? with itself to provide universal banking services. 

 As of now, the merger of BoB Cards is not under consideration. We are only thinking about taking over the primary dealership business of BoB Capital Markets. The banks board is expected to take up the issue soon, said another Bank of Baroda official.

 Last month, the banks board had approved the buying out of National Housing Banks stake in its housing finance subsidiary, BoB Housing Finance Ltd. According to the proposal which was also approved by NHB, the public sector bank will pay Rs 19.24 crore to buy back NHBs 32.89 per cent stake in BoB Housing Finance Ltd. The transaction is expected to be completed this month.

 With this acquisition, BoB Housing Finance Ltd will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bank of Baroda. The bank, however, has not yet decided whether BoB Housing Finance will continue to exist as a separate entity or be merged with the parent bank.

 Dubai wins bidding battle for P amp; 

 HEATHER TIMMONS

 Smooth sailing

 London, Feb 11: Dubai appears to have won a bidding battle for control of Peninsular amp; Oriental Steam Navigation, the British shipping company, completing the Emirates rapid transformation from a local port operator to one of the worlds giants. 

 PSA International of Singapore said unexpectedly on Friday that it would drop out of the fight for P amp;, as the British company is known, after considering Dubais ?3.88 billion ($6.8 billion) bid made on January 26. 

 For PSA to pay more than this price would not be compatible with commercial business sense and PSAs future success, PSA said in a statement to the London Stock Exchange on Friday. 

 The board of P amp; has already approved the bid, made by DP World of Dubai, and its shareholders are expected to approve it at a meeting on Monday. 

 Were pleased by this development and remain encouraged by the P amp; boards unanimous recommendation to its shareholders of our offer, said the DP World chairman, Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, who works directly for the crown prince of Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum. It would be inappropriate for us to say anything more ahead of the shareholder vote, he said. 

 Port industry ownership is increasingly moving out of European and American hands, as state-controlled entities like DP and PSA pay to buy publicly traded competitors, hoping to reap the benefits from strong global trade. In the future, these large companies are only going to get more market share, analysts predict.

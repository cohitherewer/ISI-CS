 Manual ready for new-age banking

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Sept. 1: The Tarapore committee has put out a red rag for the Left by suggesting that the government should slash its minimum shareholding in public sector banks to 33 per cent from the existing level of 51 per cent.

 Justifying its recommendation to lower the minimum share of the government/RBI in the capital of public sector banks to 33 per cent as recommended by the Narasimham Committee on Banking Sector Reforms (1998), the committee said there are certain social objectives in the very nature of public sector banking and a reduction to 33 per cent would not alter the positive aspects in the public sector character of these banks.

 The committee also wanted the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to make certain changes in the prudential and other norms so that banks are better equipped in the new environment. The report said all commercial banks should be subject to a single banking legislation and separate legislative frameworks for groups of public sector banks should be abrogated. 

 All banks, including public sector banks, should be incorporated under the Companies Act as this would provide a level-playing field. The committee opposed the proposed move to transfer ownership in SBI from the RBI to the government, saying that given the imperative need for strengthening the capital of banks in the context of Basel II and fuller capital account convertibility (FCAC), this transfer should be put on hold.

 Stating that under FCAC, the banking system will be exposed to greater market volatility, the committee said both regulatory and supervisory aspects should be examined. 

 The RBI needs to review the prudential standards applicable to commercial banks and should consider making the regulations activity-specific, instead of keeping them institution-specific, it said.

 In a FCAC regime, banks will be expected to undertake transactions in multiple currencies acting as channels for flow of funds in and out of the country when they are enabled to receive deposits and raise borrowing from both residents and non-residents and lend and invest in both domestic and foreign jurisdictions. 

 As there would be various risks involved and capital adequacy standards would be critical, the system should move forward to a differential capital regime where consideration should be given to introducing a higher core capital ratio.

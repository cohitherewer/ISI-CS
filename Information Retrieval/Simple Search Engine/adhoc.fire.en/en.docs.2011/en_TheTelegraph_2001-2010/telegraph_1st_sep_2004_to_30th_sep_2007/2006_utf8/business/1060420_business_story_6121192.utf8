 Brussels, April 19 (Reuters): Mittal Steel will launch its 20.5-billion-euro ($25.1 billion) offer for rival Arcelor in two weeks, chief executive Lakshmi Mittal said on Wednesday.

 He said his takeover bid was being studied by regulators and a decision was expected in two weeks.

 We expect in two weeks the regulators will make official, he said when asked the time when Arcelors shareholders would be able to accept the offer. He added that the offer period would last 35 working days.

 Mittal today met Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt in Brussels and the presidents of Belgiums two main regions. We have reassured the Prime Minister. We have told them that we will honour all the commitments made by Arcelor in terms of jobs and investments, Mittal said after the meeting.

 Mittal said the worlds largest steelmaker would not sell Arcelors stainless steel division for 18 months.

 Arcelor chief executive Guy Dolle is reviewing whether its stainless steel business should remain within the Luxembourg-based group. Arcelor, the worlds second-largest steelmaker, has made no secret of its wish to remain independent and has set up defences against Mittals advances, notably its ring-fencing of recently acquired Canadian steel firm Dofasco within a Dutch foundation.

 The move might hinder Mittal, because it wants to sell Dofasco to Germanys ThyssenKrupp if its planned takeover of Arcelor succeeds.

 Mittal said the foundation was a defensive measure designed to frustrate his offer and criticised it for being decided without the prior consent of shareholders.

 Its not good governance, he said.

 Mittal also said Arcelors plan to distribute 5 billion euros to shareholders if Mittals offer fails would hinder the Luxembourg groups potential.

 It will restrict growth, Mittal said.

 Belgiums government, unlike those of Luxembourg, France and Spain, has taken a neutral stance since Mittal announced its offer and has said it will judge the offer on its merits in terms of jobs and investment.

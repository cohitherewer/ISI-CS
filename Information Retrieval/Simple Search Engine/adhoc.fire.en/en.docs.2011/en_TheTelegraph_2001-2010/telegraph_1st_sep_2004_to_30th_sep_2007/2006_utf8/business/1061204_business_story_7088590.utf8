 Centre sets ball rolling on oil pipeline to Kashmir

 S.P.S. PANNU

 New Delhi, Dec. 3: The 

 government is planning a strategic oil pipeline from Jalandhar 

 in Punjab to Jammu and Srinagar in Kashmir, to ensure constant 

 supply of petrol, diesel and kerosene to the northern province 

 under all climatic conditions.

 Sources said discussions on funding the project would now be held as the pipeline does not appear to be commercially viable for oil companies. The current offtake would not justify the heavy cost of laying the pipeline.

 A senior official told The Telegraph that the concept of viability gap funding might be adopted for the project.

 Under this scheme, while an oil company would construct the project and run the operations, the government would invest an amount that would bridge the loss involved in the project. The investment required by the oil firm would be lowered so that it would get a reasonable rate of return on its capital.

 Indian Oil Corporation has a pipeline between its refinery in Panipat and Jalandhar; this can now be extended to Jammu and further to Srinagar to cater to the residents of the Valley.

 The project is considered strategic given the deployment of the defence and paramilitary forces in the region as well the requirements of the civilian population which has to face harsh winters. The road link often snaps because of heavy snowfall and also due to landslides in the monsoon, the official said.

 The pipeline would also help ease the heavy traffic congestion on the main highway through Jammu and Kashmir.

 While IOC is the biggest oil firm and appears to be the leading contender for the project as it already operates the Panipat-Jalandhar pipeline, it is yet to be decided whether it would get the project.

 Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum are also experienced in laying and operating pipelines and could be entrusted to take up the task.

 Another option would be to float a special purpose vehicle, independent of the oil firms, to lay the pipeline and manage its operations. The model adopted to set up the strategic crude oil reserves in Mangalore and Vizag could also be adopted, under which the Oil Industry Development Board (OIDB) would take up the task.

 Initially, IOC was asked to float a special purpose vehicle, Indian Strategic Petroleum Reserves Ltd (ISPRL), to build the reserves. But the government later decided that the equity held by Indian Oil in ISPRL would be transferred to OIDB instead.

 OIDB already has funds which have flowed into its coffers as a result of the cess collected from oil companies. In line with the practice in other countries such as the US, Germany and Japan where the strategic reserves are financed by the government, it has been decided that IOC should not be burdened with the additional financial responsibility.

 However, since OIDB is already burdened with the responsibility of building the strategic oil tankage, it may not be in a position to take up the pipeline as well.

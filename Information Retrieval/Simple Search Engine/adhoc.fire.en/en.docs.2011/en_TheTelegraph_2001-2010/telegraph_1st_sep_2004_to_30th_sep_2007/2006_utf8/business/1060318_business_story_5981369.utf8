 ING bets big on India

 New Delhi, March 17 (PTI): The Netherlands-based ING group is eyeing a profit of 10 million euros from the three businesses in the country ? banking, mutual fund, insurance ? in which it is present through joint ventures with Vysya Bank. ING group chief executive Michel Tilmant said the group had set a target to become a leader in Indian banking, asset management and life insurance business.

 I dont like to give numbers, but at the same time if I give number, Ill say 100 million euro (profits), Tilmant said in reply to a query after his address at a Ficci session. 

 However, he did not specify in how many years the three ING ventures in India are targeted to touch the 100-million-euro profit mark.

 ING Vysya Bank Ltd, the listed entity of the three ventures, had suffered a net loss of Rs 38.18 crore in 2004-05 but earned Rs 33.81 crore net profit during the first nine months of this fiscal, according to figures disclosed by the bank to the Bombay Stock Exchange.

 Globally, the ING group earned a profit of 7.8 billion euros last year.

 I have come here to say that ING has real ambition to grow our business in India. And for this we have to provide quality and reliable products, Tilmant said.

 He said he had told his staff that the group wants to be one of the leaders in its businesses in India. I am expecting them to move forward, to look for clients, to look for products, to look for distribution channels and to be one of the leaders in this country.

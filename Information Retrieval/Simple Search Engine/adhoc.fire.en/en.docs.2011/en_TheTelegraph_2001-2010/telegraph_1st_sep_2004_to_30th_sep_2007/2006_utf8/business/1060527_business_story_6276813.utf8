 Time for bank mergers

 Chidambaram: New age

 Mumbai, May 26: Finance minister P. Chidambaram said that in this fiscal he expected consolidations in banks to be determined more by the need to acquire size and muscle. The minister believes this approach to mergers and acquisitions (M amp;As) is more ?true? than amalgamations influenced by regulatory concerns.

 The finance minister believes that M amp;As in this year will be influenced by the need to attain efficiency and reach a scale of operations on par with some of the large banks in the world.

 Addressing bankers at the annual general meeting of Indian Banks? Association (IBA) here today, Chidambaram said consolidations in India were driven by regulatory compulsions, adding that circumstances have now changed in a major way.

 He said the major agenda in this fiscal is the implementation of the Basel II norms by March. In an environment influenced by capital requirements, weak banks will find that they have no option but to be taken over by the larger ones. ?Consolidation may become inevitable,? he said. 

 Meanwhile, at a separate event here, Chidambaram said monsoons may moderate the impact of a oil price hike on the inflation rate. ?One price rise does not decide inflation. Once monsoon sets in, experience is that it has a price restraining effect,? he said.

 He urged IBA members to seriously explore the option. He reiterated that the initiative must be taken by banks themselves after taking the views of all stakeholders, including employees.

 ?I hope before the year is out, we will have at least one or two cases of true consolidation, not driven by regulatory concerns but driven by the need of acquiring size and muscle,? the finance minister said.

 He said Indian banks have a long way to go before they can be considered to be a major players in the world market as their capital base and asset size are insufficient to make them one of the top 1,000 banks in the world. The threshold, in this case, according to the finance minister, is $200 million in Tier-I capital and $4 billion in assets.

 He said the demanding Basel II norms require banks to shore up their capital base to account for the different risks. Despite a comfortable capital adequacy ratio of 12 per cent, banks still need additional capital of Rs 42,000 by 2010.

 To meet the Basel-II standards on capital, banks should look for options to shore up their Tier-I and Tier-II capital at a low cost. Though the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has given banks the freedom to devise loan products, it is still a daunting task given the requirements. ?The task is cut out for banks. They must speed up efforts to raise more capital,? Chidambaram said.

 Meanwhile, at a separate event here, Chidambaram said monsoons may moderate the impact of a oil price hike on the inflation rate. ?One price rise does not decide inflation. Once monsoon sets in, experience is that it has a price restraining effect,? he said.

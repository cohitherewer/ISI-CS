 Tata on UK advisory panel

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 23: Tata Sons chairman Ratan Tata will advise the UK government on ways to boost its economy.

 Tata has been inducted into a council that has Li Ka-shing, chairman of Hutchison Whampoa, and Microsoft chief Bill Gates as its members.

 The international business advisory council has been set up by Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown.

 The council, which will operate for three years initially, will meet once a year at 11 Downing Street. The first meeting will be held later this year.

 The 12-member council will advise the Chancellor and secretary of state for trade and industry Alan Johnson on ways to respond to the challenges of globalisation to ensure that the UK continues to be a favoured destination for international companies.

 Tata said: I am honoured and privileged. I hope I can make a meaningful contribution.

 Back home, Tata is also a member of the Prime Ministers council of trade and industry.

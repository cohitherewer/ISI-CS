 European car czars blow horn

 GARIMA SINGH

 New Delhi, Dec. 30: After the Japanese and the Korean car makers ruled the Indian roads for the entire nineties and the first half of this decade, 2006 saw the Europeans driving into the local motown.

 With the country witnessing an exponential growth in the small- and mid-sized car segments, companies such as Fiat Auto, Renault and Europes largest car manufacturer Volkswagen AG, are now ready with their plans for the Indian market. 

 To begin with, the 50:50 joint venture between Fiat Auto and Tata Motors has announced plans to invest Rs 4,000 crore to produce one lakh passenger cars and 2 lakh diesel engines and transmissions.

 The engines in the pipeline include the Fiat 1.3 litre multi-jet diesel engine, 1.4 litre and the 1.2 litre gasoline engines. The Italian car major will introduce its offerings in the B and C segments the Grand Punto and the Linea, respectively. The latter made its debut at the Istanbul motor show last month. 

 The cars will be manufactured at Fiats plant at Ranjangaon in Maharashtra. The plant, which will be managed by the two shareholding partners, will employ around 4,000 people in the next three to four years.

 With the markets in the developed countries reaching a saturation point and production costs spiralling beyond control, European car majors have found the growing Indian automobile market as the safest bet.

 An industry analyst said Maruti and Hyundai have made a resounding success in the small car segment and many like General Motors, Tata Motors and Toyota have big plans in this segment. Besides the small car, it is the mid-sized segment which is seeing phenomenal growth and is the segment to look for in future.

 While the Japanese and the Koreans are the leaders in the small car market, it is the Europeans who have a hold in the mid-sized segment.

 The mid-sized category includes cars in the B and C segment like the Ford Fiesta, Hyundai Verna, Chevrolet Optra, Skoda Octavia, Toyota Corolla and Honda Civic.

 Other than the Tata-Fiat venture, the Mahindra-Renault 51:49 joint venture is going ahead with its plans for the Indian road. The French car manufacturer is likely to launch the Logan by mid-February.

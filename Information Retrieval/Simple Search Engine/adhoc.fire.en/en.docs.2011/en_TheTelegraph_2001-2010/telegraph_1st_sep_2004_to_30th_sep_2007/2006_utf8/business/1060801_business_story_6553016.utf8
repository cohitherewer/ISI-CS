 Duties dampen European spirits

 All bottled up

 Brussels, July 31: India is the worlds biggest market for whisky and a major international market for spirits in general. But the European wines and spirits industries could export only euro 30 million worth of their products to India last year compared with their global exports of euro 10.5 billion.

 The two industries blame Indias hefty import duties, as well as the restrictions in force in some states, for their poor export performance. 

 Just over a year ago the two bodies representing them complained jointly to the European Commission, the executive arm of the 25-nation European Union (EU), in Brussels. 

 The Commission launched an investigation last September, which included a visit to India early this year. It concluded that the additional import duties levied by India, on top of a basic customs duty, are in violation of the ground rules of the Geneva-based World Trade Organisation (WTO).

 Unless India quickly abolishes the duties in question, the EU intends to take action under the WTOs dispute settlement mechanism. 

 The EU will seek to have the two additional duties declared illegal, with the full backing of its 25 member countries. 

 If the EU is successful, India will have to eliminate these duties, or face retaliatory measures by the EU. These measures could ultimately target the exports of states which restrict sales of imported bottled wines and spirits. 

 India imposes a basic customs duty of 100 per cent on wines and 150 per cent on spirits, calculated on their declared value (ad valorem in Customs jargon). 

 Since 2000, India also levies an additional duty on bottled spirits of 25 to 150 per cent, and on bottled wines of 20 to 75 per cent (depending on the import price of the products in both cases). 

 Since last year India also levies an extra additional duty of 4 per cent on imports only.

 Exports to India by the European spirits industry amounted to euro 24 million, excluding bulk shipments, last year. Wine exports were much smaller at Euro 5.6 million. 

 The wines and spirits industries see India as an important potential market for their products. What is more, rising disposable incomes and a growing middle class mean that growth prospects are good.

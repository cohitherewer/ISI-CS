 Foreigners pocket gains

 GAURAV CHOUDHURY

 New Delhi, April 2: The current euphoria in the market may have enabled foreign institutional investors (FIIs) to book hefty short-term profits.

 During the four-month period since December last year, world over returns from markets were positive. Indian markets gave the highest return followed by Indonesia and China, a good enough reason for FIIs to pump in money.

 While gross purchases by FIIs have progressively increased from Rs 16,0491.9 crore in April last year to more than Rs 45,000 crore at present, there have been periods during the last 12 months when FIIs had been net sellers, indicating that some of them may have exited after booking profits on a short-term basis.

 Figures available with The Telegraph show that in March this year (till March 28), FIIs had made gross purchases to the tune of Rs 45,479.7 crore and sold equities worth Rs 39,758.9 crore.

 The net FII investment in equities in this period was Rs 5,720.7 crore, much less than Rs 9,335 crore invested in December last year.

 During April and May last year, the net FII investment in Indian equities was in the negative zone ? the aggregate net outflow during these two months being Rs 1,794.20 crore.

 Again in October last year, the net FII investment entered the negative zone with outflow amounting to a staggering Rs 3,476.20 crore. During that month, FIIs made purchases worth Rs 25,624.5 crore, while their gross sales amounted to Rs 29,100.7 crore.

 Since December last year, the sensex has risen by about 23 per cent from 8944.78 on December 1, to more than 11000 now. During the same period, nifty has risen by about 22 per cent from 2698.95 to 3300.

 The figures of mutual funds (MFs) also throw up an interesting pattern. After investing positively from July to November last year, for three consecutive months since December, mutual funds were net sellers in the market.

 In these three months, mutual funds bought equities worth Rs 8,368.24 crore, Rs 9,857.25 crore and Rs 9,157.76 crore, but sold shares worth Rs 9,744.97 crore, Rs 11,029.54 crore and Rs 9,403.32 crore respectively.

 During the last month, however, MFs have bucked the trend by investing positively with the net investment (till March 27, 2006) standing at Rs 3,415.09 crore.

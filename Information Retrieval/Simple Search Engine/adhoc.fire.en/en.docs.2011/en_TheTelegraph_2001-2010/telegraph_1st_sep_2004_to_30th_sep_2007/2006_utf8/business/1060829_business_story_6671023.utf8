 Trade row with Pak simmers 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Aug. 28: India plans to take up with Pakistan the latters intransigence over the most favoured nation status issue at the next Safta (South Asia Free Trade Area) ministerial meeting possibly in October, Jairam Ramesh, minister of state for commerce and industry, said here today.

 Unlike other signatories to the Safta agreement, which came into operation in January this year with the tariff agreement being implemented from July 1, Pakistan has not allowed a freer trade with India, which is preventing benefits from flowing both ways.

 While India has already accorded Pakistan the most favoured nation status, Islamabad has refused to reciprocate the gesture. 

 Pakistan is clearly violating the letter and spirit of the Safta agreement by maintaining and restricting trade to the positive list, Ramesh said.

 BASF forecasts robust earnings

 Ludwigshafen, Germany, Feb. 22 (Reuters): BASF, the worlds top chemicals company by sales, expects strong earnings this year after hurricanes in the United States hurt production and trimmed its profit in the final quarter of 2005.

 The company, a bellwether for the European chemical sector with products ranging from plastics to pesticides, also said it saw an industry upswing stretching possibly into next year.

 BASF said on Wednesday that fourth-quarter earnings before interest, tax and special items came in at 1.591 billion euros ($1.90 billion).

 The results were hit by a charge for production losses related to hurricanes that struck the US Gulf coast last year. BASF said in November it expected charges of 120 million euros but did not give an exact number on Wednesday.

 BASF shares were flat at 62.95 euros, in line the European chemical sector and Germanys DAX index.

 This is a good performance if you strip away the hurricane effects, and shows that the chemical sector upswing is continuing, said WestLB analyst Harald Gruber.

 The period of booming growth in earnings in the sector is over. Growth rates are more modest but the quality of earnings has improved.

 BASF said it aimed to grow faster than the market in 2006 and follow on from last years strong income from operations before special items. A spokesman said the firm expected earnings similar or higher than in 2005.

 We dont see a peak of the cycle this year. We think the development will go on at least for 2006, chief executive Juergen Hambrecht told a news conference.

 Debt funds to regain pride of place

 Calcutta, Aug. 13: After five years, the tide may now turn for debt funds.

 Boom time for these funds ended with the economic downswing in 2002. Since then, equity funds have been dominating the market. Moreover, the rising interest rate from the first quarter of last financial year dealt a severe blow to debt funds with their returns plummeting.

 However, now there are indications of the interest rate softening in the near future, which will bring in good times again for debt and bond funds.

 The Reserve Bank of India has reduced the cut-off yield, which is inversely related to the rate of interest, on its benchmark 10-year paper during their last auction on August 8 indicating that it perceives a softening of interest rate in the near future.

 The cut-off yield on 10-year dated government stock 2016 was pegged at 7.59 per cent when the papers were first auctioned on April 10. Since then, the yield rose steeply to 8.2902 per cent during July 11 auction. However, during the auction of the 10-year paper on August 8, the RBI lowered the cut-off yield to 8.2706 per cent.

 Though the decline is marginal, when considered with the receding inflation rate in the domestic market and global indicators, such as the Fed rate, it gives a hint of the future course of movement of the interest rate.

 On the global front, US Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke halted the rate hike on August 8 in the face of a slowing US economy. A week before that, the Bank of England and the European Central Bank also raised their benchmark rates to 4.75 per cent and 3 per cent respectively. After a long gap, Bank of Japan also increased its benchmark rate from zero per cent to 0.25 per cent.

 The rates were increased to cool down overheating economies. The heads of the respective apex banks said they would go slow in raising the rates further.

 The interest rate in the domestic market is also expected to reach a plateau by the year-end, said UTI Mutual Fund chief investment officer A.K. Sridhar, adding that it might start coming down at the beginning of next year.

 The interest rate now may harden only in the short-term, said G. Ramachandran, head, global research group, ICICI Bank Ltd. 

 According to Santosh Kamath, senior vice-president and chief investment officer (fixed income) of Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund, the crude oil price is the greatest risk to inflation. At present, it is under a speculative influence. But if a commodity is traded at an artificially high price in the spot market for long, its futures prices start climbing down and the spot market prices soon follow suit, said A. Balasubramanian, chief investment officer, Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund.

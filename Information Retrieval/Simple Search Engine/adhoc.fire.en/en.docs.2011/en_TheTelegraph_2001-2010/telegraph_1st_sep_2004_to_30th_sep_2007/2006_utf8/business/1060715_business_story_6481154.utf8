 Rosneft IPO fetches $10 bn

 Richie rich

 Moscow, July 14 (Reuters): Russian oil firm Rosneft said on Friday its record IPO, the worlds fifth biggest, raised $10.4 billion (?5.7 billion), but a British court challenge from rival Yukos threatened to delay its market debut. 

 Rosneft said in a statement the IPO, priced at $7.55-a-share, gave Russias third-biggest oil firm a market capitalisation of $79.8 billion, a premium to its local benchmark and biggest producer Lukoil. It said the capitalisation may rise to $80.2 billion after an over allotment.

 Some of us havent slept all night, Rair Simonyan, head of Morgan Stanley in Russia, one of the adviser banks. Now it has all ended in great success. 

 But as Rosnefts bankers toasted the sale in Moscow, Yukos spokeswoman Claire Davidson said in London that the company was seeking a temporary injunction to postpone the IPO before Rosnefts shares make their market debut on July 19. 

 We may get a decision today (Friday) on whether or not the judge will accept our claim, Davidson said. If the decision is positive, then the court has to advise us whether or not there will be a hearing and when.

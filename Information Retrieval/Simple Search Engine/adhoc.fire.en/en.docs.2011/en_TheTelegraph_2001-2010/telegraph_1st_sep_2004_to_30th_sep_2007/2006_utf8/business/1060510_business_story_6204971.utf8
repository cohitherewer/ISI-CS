 IndiGo ropes in Airbus for training course

 In full throttle 

 Mumbai, May 9: Airbus Industrie will provide its active learning and competence focused training (AACT) in India in partnership with Delhi-based low-cost carrier IndiGo Airlines.

 The training programme, also globally known as Airbus AACT, will make use of virtual reality and simulated modules in the field of maintenance for the A320 family, and is the first such programme outside Europe. 

 The A320 is a recognised technological leader in single-aisle aircraft, with advanced fuel saving features. More than 4,300 planes have been ordered and over 2,700 are currently being used. In 2005, the A320 outsold its nearest rival by almost two aircraft to one.

 The cost of setting up the facility is part of the $6-billion deal that IndiGo has signed with Airbus for supplying it with 100 aircraft over the next few years.

 IndiGo Airlines, promoted by Delhi-based travel firm Interglobe Enterprises, placed one of the worlds largest aircraft orders last June at the Paris Air Show. The airline would get eight aircraft by the end of 2006, nine more in 2007 and induct one each every month after that.

 The current training facility by Airbus for IndiGo would be set up at Udyog Vihar in Gurgaon, said an Airbus Industrie spokesperson.

 The facility, however, is a moveable project and can be taken out of Gurgaon to other places by Airbus after the current project with IndiGo ends in October. This will mean that Airbus can set up the facility again at a convenient location for another customer, said a top source in Airbus.

 Apart from other Indian carriers like Kingfisher and Air Deccan, Airbus will supply some 48 aircraft to Indian Airlines. The Airbus source said the company plans to use the same facility to train other customers.

 Airbus has emerged as one of the biggest suppliers to the booming aviation industry of Asia. However, it was not clear whether the India facility would also be used to service carriers from other Asian countries.

 The eight-week long programme will train 12 maintenance engineers at a time using the latest methodologies and tools in new aircraft maintenance practices in a computerised simulated environment.

 Apart from using the conventional aids, for the first time in India, the training will involve new generation tools, which will provide a realistic simulated environment, said IndiGo CEO and president Bruce Ashby.

 Airbus executive vice-president Kiran Rao said, The programme will enable IndiGo to achieve the highest international standards in maintenance training and will play a key role in training for the future.

 Meanwhile, rival Boeing announced in April that its management had, in principle, decided to build a maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) facility in Nagpur. It also plans to spend around $100 million to train pilots.

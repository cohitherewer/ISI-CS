 PC sales set good growth pace

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, June 29: Personal computer sales, including desktops and notebooks, in India are expected to cross 6 million units this fiscal. 

 According to MAIT, an industry body representing hardware manufacturers, the PC market has grown by 32 per cent last fiscal over the previous year. PC sales touched 5.04 million units in 2005-06.

 MAIT attributed the growth in PC sales to consumption by various sectors, including telecom, banking and financial services, manufacturing, retail and BPO/IT-enabled services as well as e-governance initiatives of the central and state governments.

 However, the sub-Rs 10,000 PCs have not been able to drive sales, the industry body said.

 The initiative did create a lot of excitement in the market, but at the end of the day there is a need to focus on relevant applications, content, software and other significant details that adds value to your computer, said MAIT executive director Vinnie Mehta.

 The MAIT-IMRB survey says PC sales to households accounted for 25 per cent of the total consumption and the business segment 75 per cent. 

 We dont see any dramatic increase in the household figure in short term, unless the issue of content, better broadband penetration and applications are addressed, Mehta said.

 Computer sales in small towns grew by over 35 per cent, accounting for 54 per cent of the market. 

 The market share of assembled PCs shrunk to 37 per cent from 41 per cent in the previous fiscal.

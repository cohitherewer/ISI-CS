 Calcutta, March 24: Tantia Constructions Ltd will issue 11,250,000 fresh shares to fund a Rs 76.75-crore capital expenditure plan.

 The price band of the issue, which opens on March 27 and closes on March 31, has been fixed at Rs 45 to Rs 50 a share. The company aims to raise between Rs 50.625 crore and Rs 56.25 crore from the 100 per cent book-built issue. 

 However, only 42,50,000 shares of the follow-on issue will be offered to the public, of which 14,87,500 will be set aside for retail investors.

 Over 63 per cent of the issue have been kept aside for preferential allotment to promoters and other investors.

 After the issue, the promoters shareholding will come down to 51.19 per cent from 64.11 per cent at present despite their fresh acquisition of shares. Tantia Constructions is already listed on the Calcutta Stock Exchange and Delhi Stock Exchange, but the scrip is hardly traded. The new issue, however, proposes to list the shares on the Bombay Stock Exchange. 

 The proceeds will be used to purchase construction equipment, meet long-term working capital, repay unsecured loans and public deposits and invest in build-operate-transfer projects and joint ventures.

 For the nine months ended December 2005, the company has recorded a total income of Rs 96.54 crore against Rs 103.16 crore in the preceding 12 months. During the same period, it posted an after-tax profit of Rs 40.81 crore compared with Rs 18.72 crore for the full year of 2004-05.

 We have orders over Rs 800 crore at hand as on February 26, said Tantia Constructions chairman and managing director I.P. Tantia.

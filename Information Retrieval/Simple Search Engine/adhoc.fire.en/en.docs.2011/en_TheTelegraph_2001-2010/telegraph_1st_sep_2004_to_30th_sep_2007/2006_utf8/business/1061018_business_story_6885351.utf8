 New Delhi, Oct. 17: The Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited (MTNL) today launched the countrys first Internet protocol television (IPTV) services for its basic telephone and broadband subscribers in Delhi and Mumbai.

 Also know as triple play, IPTV allows viewers to enjoy TV channels through phone lines, besides simultaneously allowing calls and Net surfing on the same broadband connection.

 Broadband users can access television channels and video-on-demand services using the computer, while consumers with only a TV can use IPTV services via a set-top box attached to their television sets.

 A number of other operators, including Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited, Bharti Airtel and Reliance Communications, are also planning to launch IPTV by 2007.

 While state-owned telecom firms like MTNL and BSNL have the upper hand right now because they already own the last-mile link to homes, private players like Reliance and Bharti plan to utilise third-generation (3G) mobile services to resolve the last-mile issue. Bharti Airtel is already running an IPTV pilot project in Gurgaon where 1,000 customers are home-testing the service on copper wires.

 With the new technology, consumers can send their pictures to TV screens and can listen to music at the same time. Electronic mails can also be sent via TV in real time even while watching programmes.

 MTNL chairman-cum-managing director R.S.P. Sinha said, Our presence in over 3.8 million homes in New Delhi and Mumbai through our landline phones will give MTNL a tremendous headstart in changing the way people watch television.

 Under the present scheme, MTNL will offer 30 free-to-air channels at Rs 125, while at a monthly payment of Rs 250, one can see about 30 paid channels and all free-to-air ones.

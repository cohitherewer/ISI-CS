 $20-m kitty for two ABB units

 OUR BUREAU

 Bangalore, March 15: ABB group president and chief executive Fred Kindle, who is currently touring India, has said the group will invest $20 million to set up two manufacturing units ? a low voltage distribution electricals unit in Haridwar and a vacuum interrupter plant in Nashik. While the Haridwar plant is expected to go on stream by the third quarter this year, the Nashik facility will be operational by early next year.

 The group had announced a $100-million investment plan for India operations in November 2004. Over the past two years, ABB has set up manufacturing units in Bangalore, Vadodara, Nashik and Halol to expand its portfolio of products made in India. 

 ABB is firmly committed to growing its operations in India and our investment programme for the country is on course. Half of our proposed investments have already been made and the remaining will be done by early next year, said Kindle, who also inaugurated ABBs global operations and engineering centre in the city.

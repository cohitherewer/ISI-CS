 Verna rollout key to Hyundai strategy 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 25: Hyundai Motors India Limited (HMIL) today launched the Verna, its mid-sized sedan.

 The Verna, which will be available in three petrol and one diesel variants, will strengthen Hyundais portfolio in the mid-sized segment. The car is priced between Rs 6.21 lakh and Rs 6.36 lakh for the petrol variants and Rs 7.35 lakh for the diesel model.

 The petrol variants will be powered by a 1.6-litre engine while the diesel one will have a 1.5-litre CRDi engine.

 However, the current price is only an introductory offer. We will take a re-look. We may announce the change in prices by the month-end, said Arvind Saxena, vice president sales and marketing, HMIL.

 Speaking at the launch, H.S. Lheem, managing director of HMIL, said, The Verna, which has been designed in a smooth European style, is important for Hyundais India plans. The mid-sized segment has been witnessing exciting times in the last few years.

 This is Hyundais second mid-sized offering after the Accent that was launched in 1999. The car maker has positioned the Verna in the higher mid-sized category.

 Competing against this latest offering will be Hondas City and Fords Fiesta.

 Hoping to cash in on the growing segment, Saxena said, Together with the Accent, we will be a dominant player in the mid-sized sedan market.

 The company has already despatched over 1,000 units of the Verna to its dealers.

 On whether the launch of the Verna will affect the sales of the Accent, Saxena said, There are no plans to reduce prices.

 Ruling out speculation about Hyundai phasing off the Accent with the launch of the Verna, he said, We will have both cars operating simultaneously.

 On the companys overall sales target for the year, Lheem said the company planned to sell about 3 lakh cars this year, against 2,52,851 sold last year.

 Meanwhile, the company plans to start exporting its hatchback model Getz by next year.

 HMIL will invest Rs 4,191 crore in India to set up a new car and engine plant as well as a research and development centre.

 Currently, HMIL manufactures 3 lakh cars at its production facility near Chennai, in which it has already invested Rs 3,372 crore.

 The production is slated to double after the companys second plant begins operations by the end of 2007. 

 The new plant will involve an investment of Rs 2,429 crore.

 The company said its vendors will separately invest a total of Rs 2,585 crore to cater to the second plant.

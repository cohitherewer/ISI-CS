 Mumbai, Dec. 11: Bank of India (BoI) is buying PT Bank Swadesi Tbk, a mid-sized financial institution based in Indonesia, in its first overseas acquisition in recent years. BoI will buy 76 per cent of the company for an undisclosed sum.

 BoI today informed the stock exchanges that it has signed a conditional sale purchase agreement with the majority shareholders of PT Bank Swadesi for this purpose. 

 The acquisition will be completed after obtaining the necessary approval from Bank Indonesia and capital market regulators in Indonesia. 

 PT Bank Swadesi provides retail banking services and other financial services. It offers saving products, loans, foreign exchange transaction and other services such as ATM and utility bills payment. Earlier this year, the group had three branch offices, five sub-branch offices and six cash offices in the country. 

 Overseas players have been interested in Indonesian financial institutions and banks as the central bank there has asked them to seek investors or consolidate through the process of merger and amalgamation. 

 Commonwealth Bank of Australia is acquiring a significant stake in PT Bank Arta Niaga Kencana. The country has more than 130 such financial institutions and banks and the authorities have targeted to bring the number down to 70. 

 Last year, State Bank of India (SBI) bought 76 per cent of Indonesias PT Bank IndoMonex for an undisclosed sum. 

 PT Bank IndoMonex is a closely held entity and it had seven offices in Jakarta, Bandung and Surabaya. 

 BoI has taken a series of initiatives recently. Along with Union Bank of India, it has joined hands with Infrastructure Development Finance Company Ltd (IDFC) for loan syndication and large project funding. 

 Both BoI and Union Bank also decided to take initiatives of working together in the areas of marketing, cash management services, branch network, international operations and training facilities. 

 It also entered into the lucrative retail broking segment.

 HM vows launch rush

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan 12: Hindustan Motors today took the wraps off the new Mitsubishi Lancer Cedia and announced plans to introduce an array of sports utility vehicles, including the Montero and the Outlander, in the local market.

 We expect to introduce the Montero in six months, HM managing director Ravi Santhanam said.

 The Montero is more like a traditional rugged and heavy SUV and is in the same segment as the Toyota Land Cruiser. 

 Outlander, on the other hand, is a mini SUV, similar to Hondas CR-V and GMs Forester. It is known in Japan as the Airtrek and has been developed as the next generation SUV combining flexible utility with sporty style.

 The company also plans to introduce the Grandis minivan, although officials refused to divulge details. Known as a multi-purpose vehicle (MPV) in global markets, the Grandis in India is expected to be pitted against the Ford Fusion.

 Grandis is actually an upgraded version of the Mitsubishi Space Wagon and is superior to the latter in all aspects such as build quality, styling, refinement and use of interior space.

 Santhanam also ruled out the possibility of Hindustan Motors diluting any equity in favour of Mitsubishi.

 The Lancer Cedia, which was unveiled today, will have an ex-showroom (Delhi) price of Rs 9.87 lakh.

 Open door for closed funds

 Closed-end funds are staging a comeback. Early this year, Franklin Templeton, HDFC, ICICI Prudential and Standard Chartered Mutual Fund launched their closed-end schemes.

 Now Tata Mutual Fund and UTI Mutual Fund have lined up theirs. 

 Tata Mutual Fund has just launched Tata Capital Builder, a three-year closed-end diversified equity fund, which will automatically become an open-ended scheme after three years. UTI Mutual Fund is coming out with UTI Wealth Builder, a five-year closed-end fund. After five years, this fund will also automatically convert into an open-ended scheme. 

 Tata Mutual Fund is, however, providing a weekly exit option (sale of units to the fund house) through the NAV-based mechanism. But there will be an exit load to the extent of proportionate new fund offer (NFO) expenses. But there will be no entry load.

 In the UTI scheme, which is under Sebi?s consideration, the exit loads are 4 per cent, 3 per cent, 2 per cent and 1 per cent for redemptions during the first, second, third and fourth year, respectively. 

 However, the history of closed-end funds in this country has not been good. The equity-linked savings schemes, for example, started giving good returns only recently, after they were made open-ended from the late 1990s. 

 Even HDFC Capital Builder Fund, which was a closed-end fund under Zurich Mutual Fund?s fold, made a dramatic turnaround when made open-ended after Zurich was bought out by HDFC Mutual Fund.

 This implies that the fund managers have so far neglected closed-end schemes till they were made open-ended. But can they now do that in the face of competition? Probably not. The comeback of closed-end funds this time may herald a new era.

 Calcutta, April 4: Small and medium businesses (SMBs) would contribute significantly to Bengal?s revenue from information technology (IT).

 SMBs in the subcontinent are expected to invest $7.7 billion on IT solutions this year, according to a survey by the New York-based AMI-Partners.

 ?They will spend 26 per cent more than last year to beef up IT infrastructure. This is an indication of the rapid growth that this sector is witnessing,? G.D. Gautama, principal secretary, IT department, government of Bengal, said at a seminar on application of IT in the SMB sector at the Bengal National Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

 Their role is also crucial in increasing the state?s current contribution of 5.5 per cent approximately to the national IT exports.

 According to the survey, a third of all SMBs in India anticipate an increase of 20 per cent in their annual revenues and are therefore, spending more on bolstering IT infrastructure. SMBs in the state are no exception.

 In India, the SMB market comprises 7.5 million businesses, of which 21 per cent use the personal computer. 

 Gautama said the sector, therefore, has a lot of growth potential as a large part is yet to be tapped. The study shows that 40 per cent of the non-PC small businesses are planning to purchase 1.4 desktops on an average next year, allocating a future planned hardware budget of over $570 per business.

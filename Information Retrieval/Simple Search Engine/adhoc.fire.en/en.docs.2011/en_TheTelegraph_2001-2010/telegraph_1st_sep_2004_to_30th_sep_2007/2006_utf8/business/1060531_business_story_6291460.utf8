 Tata Steel priority to overseas synergy

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Mukherjee: Foreign call

 Calcutta, May 30: Tata Steel plans to integrate its overseas acquisitions in Singapore and Thailand in two years.

 T. Mukherjee, deputy managing director of Tata Steel, said the company would synergise the operations of three entities ? NatSteel of Singapore, Thailand-based Millennium Steel and Tata Steel ? during this period.

 NatSteel has a capacity of 2 mt while Millennium Steel has 1.7 mt.

 Tata Steel has a 5-million-tonne (mt) plant in Jamshedpur whose capacity is expected to go up by another 1.8 mt.

 Mukherjee said the capacity addition at Jamshedpur would be in long products.

 We will make about 1 mt billet, which will be supplied to these companies, thereby making it cost effective, Mukherjee said.

 Moreover, Tata Metaliks, a Tata Steel subsidiary, is also planning to make billets that could be sent to these units for rolling.

 NatSteel and Millennium Steel provide finishing facilities for the company in key Southeast Asian markets.

 Mukherjee, who is heading the integration process, said the consolidation would lead to a substantial cost reduction in operations for these two companies, resulting in higher profitability.

 Tata Steel closed the financial year 2005-06 with an EBIDTA (earnings before interest, depreciation, tax and amortisation) margin of 40 per cent, while those for NatSteel and Millennium Steel were 5.9 per cent and 9.2 per cent. The operational integration would eventually raise them to the level of Tata Steel.

 The consolidation would lead to many joint exercises by the two Southeast Asian companies. For instance, they will co-operate in buying key raw material scrap or selling rebar.

 Millennium Steel, acquired in December last year, is the largest producer of steel in Thailand accounting for 36 per cent of steel melting and 24 per cent of rolling facilities there. It manufactures long products used in the construction industry.

 Domestic operations

 Back home, Tata Steel plans to sell 0.5 million tonnes more this fiscal. On a consolidated basis, with international operations, the total sale will be 8.19 mt against 6.69 mt achieved last year.

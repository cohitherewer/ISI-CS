 Centre offers sop for jute exports

 AMIT CHAKRABORTY

 Calcutta, June 21: The Centre has offered a special incentive for export of jute goods to land-locked Latin American and African countries.

 This will offset the high freight cost and other infrastructure inefficiencies involved in exporting to these countries under the Focus Products and Focus Market schemes, sources said.

 The special incentive in the form of duty credit scrip of 2.5 per cent of the FOB value of export, however, will be restricted to 50 per cent of the export turnover. 

 The scrip and the items imported against it will be freely transferable, the Directorate General Foreign Trade (DGFT) said while announcing the scheme under the Foreign Trade Policy 2004-09.

 The incentive would boost export of jute goods to nearly 57 countries in South America and Africa, according to industry leaders.

 These countries account for around Rs 300 crore of the total exports of around Rs 1,000 crore.

 Export of food grade jute bags developed by Indian Jute Industries Research Association (IJIRA) is increasing as these are becoming popular for packing cocoa, coffee and shell nuts. 

 Industry sources said European buyers of these food products are insisting on these bags as the packing medium.

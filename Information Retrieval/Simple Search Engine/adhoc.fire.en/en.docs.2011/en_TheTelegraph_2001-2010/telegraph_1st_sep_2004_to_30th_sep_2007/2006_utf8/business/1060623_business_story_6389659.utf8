 Top shots go for the ground job

 SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI

 Mumbai, June 22: Air Sahara honchos were out there in full force on Thursday as the airline took over full control of its operations after the deal with Jet Airways collapsed yesterday.

 In recent times, Jet Airways had been overseeing operations of Sahara.

 Intrepid passengers at Mumbai airport, expecting severe flight delays, were pleasantly surprised to find a whole brigade of the Air Saharas senior officials manning every customer facility on Thursday.

 We came here certain that the flights would be cancelled or at best be highly delayed. But right from the time we arrived, Sahara staff has been all around making things extra smooth. It is wonderful. But I am sceptical how long this courtesy will last, said Mohit Garg, a Mumbai businessman on his way to Delhi for a family wedding.

 On Thursday, Air Sahara president Alok Sharma took effective charge of the aviation operations. Sharma, was present at the Delhi airport to motivate Air Sahara staff.

 I see energy and enthusiasm among the people behind the counters? Absolutely new freshness in them... If at all I see something, I am seeing something positive, he said.

 We decided to go all out and deployed our corporate officials at airports across the country to ensure smooth operations. We will continue to do this for a couple of more days till all processes are well lubricated like earlier. The employees are very upbeat and gung-ho, he added.

 On the staff crunch at Air Sahara, he said, Saharashri (Subroto Roy) had already said no employee would be jobless after the Jet-Sahara deal. But many left because they were not happy with the new jobs assigned to them by Jet. We are sending out messages that we are ready to welcome whoever wants to return to their earlier jobs. 

 At the Mumbai airport, Air Sahara valets and luggage handling staff stood outside the premises helping passengers under the watchful eyes of senior officials.

 I wonder why they let their services dip at all if they are capable of such niceties. One has become used to major flight delays these days but today I was surprised to see there was minimal delay by Air Sahara, said 69-year-old Shirley DaCosta who arrived from Bangalore. 

 Incidentally there were almost no delays in any of our flights across the country on Thursday, said an Air Sahara spokesman.

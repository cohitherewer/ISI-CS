 Paswan caps export of iron ore

 Paswan: Friend in need 

 New Delhi, March 21: Steel minister Ram Vilas Paswan will be playing Santa Claus to steel barons Prashant Ruia, Vinod Mittal and Sajjan Jindal. All of them met Paswan yesterday seeking more ore for their iron-starved steel businesses. 

 Paswan has asked the state-run National Mineral Development Corporation Ltd (NMDC) to cut down export of iron ore by about two-third, from 5.4 million tonnes (mt) to 1.7 mt, to make available more ore to steel makers like the Ruias and Jindals. They need more iron for their existing plants as well as planned factories in Gujarat, Orissa, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand. 

 Older steel makers like SAIL and the Tatas have captive iron ore mines, but newcomers look to NMDC for their iron ore. NMDC supplies about 16 mt iron ore to domestic steel makers and exports up to 6 mt high-grade ore abroad. 

 Paswan did not invite steel secretary Mono Ranjan to these meetings. Instead, D. Pathak, who is a far more junior official, took part in the discussions. Pathak is the chief controller of accounts and also on the board of NMDC.

 The steel and commerce ministries have faced a lobbying war between advocates of iron ore exports and those supporting a cap on overseas sales to feed domestic demand. The ministers ruling is seen as a victory for the domestic ore users? lobby against proponents of more exports. 

 The export lobby feels this could fetch higher forex earnings, adding that larger exports wont hurt Indias 22-billion-tonne reserve. 

 Only 45 per cent of this reserve can be mined due to various reasons.

 Cheap export of high-grade iron ore to Japan has long been a sore point with most steel-makers in India. They feel the domestic steel industry, which is expanding fast, will require high quality iron ore, a scarce resource the world over and this should be kept back. 

 Senior government officials said NMDC used to sell high-grade ore abroad and its diversion into the domestic market will mean a lot to local steel makers. NMDC has also been asked to stop ?loose change? sales, that is sale of small quantities and instead asked to concentrate on volume sales. 

 The iron ore mining company has some Rs 1,800 crore in cash reserves and reserves of some 550 mt but produces about 22 mt. Paswan is believed to have prodded it into expanding to take care of the exponential growth in the local steel industry.

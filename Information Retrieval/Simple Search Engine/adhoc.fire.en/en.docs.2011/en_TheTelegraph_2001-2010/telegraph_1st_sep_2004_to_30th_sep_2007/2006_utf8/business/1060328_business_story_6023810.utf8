 Sensex scales new peak on buying binge

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, March 27: The sensex today closed above 11000, fuelled by strong buying interests. 

 Kicking off at 10996.36 points, the 30-share benchmark index rallied to an all-time intra-trade high of 11101.42 and even ended the day at a new closing peak of 11079.02, up 128.72 points or 1.18 per cent. 

 The strong momentum is evident from the fact that the market ignored the possibility of a hike in US Fed rates. The Fed is meeting this week and is expected to hike the interest rates by another 25 basis points. 

 According to market watchers, the renewed movement in mid-cap stocks, apart from a continuing rally in heavyweight scrips, also point to a strong market. 

 Smart gains in metal shares saw the BSE Metal Index outperforming the other indices for the third consecutive day. It closed at 8498.71, up 3.85 per cent or 315.19 points as gains were seen in JSW Steel, Tata Steel, SAIL, Hindalco, Jindal Steel, Sterlite, Hindustan Zinc, Jindal Stainless and Jindal Saw. 

 FMCG, oil, pharma, banking, capital goods and auto stocks gained, while consumer durables and technology scrips lost ground. 

 FMCG major HLL was the biggest gainer, up Rs 5.55 to Rs 269.50. The company has hiked prices of some of its products. 

 Tata Steel, ITC, Hindalco, GAIL and SAIL were the other big gainers, while Wipro, Bajaj Auto, Tata Motors, Ranbaxy Labs, Zee Telefilms, HCL Tech and HPCL were the major losers. 

 The market breadth remained positive. About 1336 shares advanced, 1136 shares declined, and 72 remained unchanged. Among the sensex shares, 18 rose, while 12 declined. 

 The volume of business increased to Rs 6,162.90 crore from Rs 4,551.53 crore on Friday. 

 The total net investments of FII stood at Rs 4,831 crore so far in the month, while domestic mutual funds made net purchases of Rs 424.83 crore during the last week taking their total investment to Rs 2,948 crore for the month till date. 

 The NSE Nifty closed at 3321.65, up 41.85 points or 1.28 per cent and touched a life high of 3327.05. 

 The broad-based BSE-100 index gained 58.04 points to 5,804.50 from previous close of 5,746.46. 

 RIL was the top traded scrip with the highest turnover of Rs 1,338.12 crore followed by Tata Steel, HDFC, SAIL and ICICI Bank.

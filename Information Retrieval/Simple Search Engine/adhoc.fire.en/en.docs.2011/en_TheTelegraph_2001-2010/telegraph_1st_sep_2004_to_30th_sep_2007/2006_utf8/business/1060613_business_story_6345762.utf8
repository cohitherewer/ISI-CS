 NSDL gets a breather

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, June 12: The Securities and Appellate Tribunal (SAT) today set aside a Securities and Exchange Board of Indias directive in its interim order on the demat scam to revamp the management of the National Securities Depository Ltd (NSDL).

 The regulator had charged NSDL of gross negligence in the demat scam. In its order, it had asked the promoters of NSDL which include National Stock Exchange, IDBI Bank and UTI to revamp the management. Similar directives were also passed on the promoters of Central Depository Services Ltd (CDSL).

 NSDL appealed against the Sebi order relating to irregularities in the IPO allotments of Yes Bank and Infrastructure Development and Finance Company (IDFC).

 Sources said SAT set aside the directive as various issues needed to be considered.

 NSDL had contended that Sebi issued the order without giving the depository an opportunity to present its case, adding that it was also not a self-regulatory organisation as claimed by Sebi.

 NSDL said it had met with Sebi directives on Karvy Share Broking Ltd-DP. The market regulator had asked NSDL to carry out an inspection of Karvy, particularly the know-your-client norms, in the Yes Bank IPO allotment. NSDL conducted an inspection and submitted its report to the regulator in December 2005.

 The depository said though bank documents as required by Sebi norms were made available, there were lapses by Karvy in processing account opening applications.

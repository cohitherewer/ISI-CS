 Suzuki bike debut nears

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 3: The domestic two-wheeler market is set for a major shake-up with Japans automobile giant, Suzuki, ready to roll out its first range of motorbikes in India, the second largest two-wheeler market in the world after China. 

 Suzuki Motorcycles India Pvt. Limited (SMIPL), a subsidiary of Suzuki Motor Corporation, Japan, will launch a mix of commuter and premium motorbikes in the first phase. 

 According to sources, Suzuki is focusing on 125-cc motorbikes to begin with targeting a pie of the basic 100-cc bikes market and later move on to other segments. 

 While company officials are keeping the launch date under wraps, industry sources indicated that the first set of Suzuki bikes could be out sometime later this month. 

 Suzuki had earlier announced its joint venture with the Delhi-based Integra Overseas Pvt. Ltd. to manufacture and market Suzuki motorbikes in the country. 

 The company has already invested Rs 200 crore in India. The state-of-the-art facility in Gurgaon has a manufacturing capacity of 1,20,000 vehicles annually, which can be ramped up as and when demand picks up. 

 The bikes are specially designed to suit the Indian conditions and all the products are in conformity with the Bharat-II norms. Suzuki has taken due care of the significant parameters that influence Indian consumers such as contemporary design and looks, engine suitability for rugged usage and attractive price tags. 

 With the first set of bikes ready to roll out in a few weeks, other category bikes have already been designed and the production will commence soon. Majority of the parts going into the vehicles has been indigenised, while a few would be imported from Suzukis own stable in Japan. 

 Initially, Suzuki is targeting to provide the customer with feature packed bikes in the mass-market category and will eventually expand the line-up to cover all other segments. 

 The company is among the largest manufacturers of two wheelers in the world and is globally known for its range of high performance road machines, light-weight super bikes, dirt bikes, street bikes, motocross and fun bikes. 

 However, Suzuki will have to weather a stiff competition from Honda, its co-country rival, which has an Indian joint venture, Hero Honda.

 Uco ups key lending rate 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Sridar: At your service

 Calcutta, Aug. 21: Uco Bank today raised its benchmark prime lending rate (BPLR) by 50 basis points to 12 per cent.

 Last week, the banks board met here to review the rate hike. However, it left the decision to the asset liability management committee of the bank, said V. Sridar, Uco Banks chairman and managing director.

 The committee has decided to go in for a 0.50 percentage point hike in the banks PLR. 

 However, to ensure sufficient availability of credit at a reasonable rate, the bank has also reduced the spread of its lending rates over the BPLR. The spread for lending rates, which are currently charged above the BPLR, has been reduced so that these are not affected by the BPLR hike, a senior bank official said.

 Uco Bank has kept the maximum rate for priority sector lending up to Rs 25 lakh for three years at 11.50 per cent, which is 0.50 percentage point less than its new BPLR.

 With the revision in PLR, the rates for sub-PLR loans will go up.

 This is the banks first PLR hike after the Reserve Bank of India had raised its repo and reverse repo rates by 25 basis points each in its quarterly monetary policy review in July. 

 Uco Bank is also planning to offer financial derivatives to its customers. On July 5, the bank floated a tender inviting request for proposals (RFP) from consultancy firms to set up a functional derivatives desk in the bank within a stipulated timeframe. 

 We are planning to offer our customer value-added services such as financial derivatives products. For this, we need to set up a dedicated desk for derivatives trading, Sridar said. We also need our officials to be adequately trained to understand the risk management and other nuances in financial derivatives trading. For this, we are looking for consultants who can train our people, maintain their own books and set up a derivatives desk, he added.

 According to the tender document, the role of the consultant will be to draw up a policy document for the derivatives operations of the bank, including identifying the types of transactions (hedging or trading) to be undertaken, set up limits for banking books and trading books, the variety of derivatives products to be offered to customers, setting up stop loss limits, accounting policies and valuation principles, define organisation structure, prepare procedural manual for front office and back office, and draw up review procedure.

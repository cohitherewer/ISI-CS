 Plan for that nest egg

 Saving on taxes is passe: the changes in tax laws took care of that. Plan your investments, says Srikumar Bondyopadhyay

 Nothing is certain but death and taxes, said Benjamin Franklin in 1789. Well, nothing can be done about the former, but you can surely lower your tax burden by judiciously planning your savings and investments.

 Until a year ago, the motivation for many to invest was driven by the desire to save on taxes. Since different instruments attracted differential tax treatment, investments were skewed towards National Savings Certificates and life insurance policies: taxpayers would invest in instruments that gave them the highest rebates and an assured rate of return.

 Now that the interest rate has come down and all the instruments have been brought under an umbrella section (80C) in the Income Tax Act, allowing an overall deduction of up to Rs 1 lakh, there is little one can do to save on taxes. 

 In other words, earlier, you could show a nil tax liability on an annual income of Rs 2.5 lakh by claiming deductions and rebates. But not now ? on the same income, you will have to pay a tax even after availing of the Rs 1 lakh deduction. 

 So, one should stop worrying about tax savings and concentrate more on planning investments within the permissible savings limit.

 A taxpayer?s strategy should be to pick those instruments that give higher returns and more liquidity. Tax planning should be a part of the overall investment planning.

 This calls for two considerations: fresh investments should be made after taking into account earlier ones. Second, taxpayers need to start investing from the beginning of a financial year instead of waiting for the last few months, and, if possible, invest systematically rather than at one go.

 A younger person should take greater exposure to high-risk, high-return investment instruments such as equity-linked savings schemes. Historically, equities have given the highest returns among all asset classes in the long run. An exposure to stocks through professionally managed mutual funds also reduces risks to a large extent. 

 One can follow a simple thumb rule: 100 minus one?s age should be the percentage of one?s investments in equities. For instance, if you are 30 years old and plan to invest Rs 1 lakh to save on taxes, you should invest up to Rs 70,000 in ELSS. The rest you can spend in buying a life insurance policy and a pension plan. However, there is no hard and fast rule to this.

 Retirement and insurance planning should be made at a younger age in conjunction with tax planning. This is because premium cost is less for a 20-year-old than for a person who is 40. One can further reduce the premium cost (thereby releasing more sum for investment in other instruments) by choosing a term assurance cover, the lowest-cost insurance plan, instead of a traditional or a unit-linked one.

 Every investment plan, irrespective of the age of the taxpayer, should include an ELSS simply because of the rate of return and the liquidity they offer (see chart).

 Taxpayers in the age group of 40 to 45 must include a PPF account. With an 8 per cent cumulative interest, a PPF gives a decent, risk-free return. 

 However, a PPF has a 15-year lock-in. Hence, one may start investing in it 15-16 years before retirement to match the maturity of the PPF account.

 Bank fixed deposits for five years or more are the safest and hence are best suited for people over 50 years. At least half of the investment portfolio of those who are on the odd side of 50 should comprise fixed income instruments such as bank fixed deposits, PPF and NSC. One must choose the dividend option, instead of the growth option, if fresh investments are made in ELSS at this age. However, an ELSS investment should ideally be made following a systematic plan.

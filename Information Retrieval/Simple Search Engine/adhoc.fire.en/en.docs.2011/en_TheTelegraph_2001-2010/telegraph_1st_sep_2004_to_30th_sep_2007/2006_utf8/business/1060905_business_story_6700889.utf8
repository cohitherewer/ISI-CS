 Status quo on P-notes for now

 New Delhi, Sept. 4 (PTI): Days after the Tarapore Committee recommended a ban on fresh inflow of funds in the equity markets through participatory notes (P-notes) and their phaseout in a year, the government today said this route will be available to investors as of now.

 Status quo on policy on P-notes will continue, an official release said here.

 The government, however, said it would take a view on the matter after considering all suggestions made by the Tarapore Committee that outlined a five-year roadmap for fuller rupee float and the earlier Ashok Lahiri Committee on encouraging FII flows.

 Set up by the RBI following Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs suggestion to work out a roadmap for full convertibility of rupee to make Mumbai a major global financial hub, the Tarapore Committee had recommended a ban on fresh inflows through P-notes and their phaseout in a year.

 The committees recommendations received dissent notes from two of its members Surjit S. Bhalla and A.V. Rajwade. The earlier Lahiri committee had recommended continuance of the present dispensation for P-notes.

 Bhalla said if the committee wanted to give recommendations on P-notes against another government-appointed committee (Lahiri), it should have given reasons for this.

 The reasons were missing in the report, he said.

 He said full convertibility is allowed for foreigners but not for Indians. One can understand the restrictions on Indians taking out money from the country, but why should there be controls on bringing money into India. 

 Bhalla said, Most of the investments through P-notes are done by pension funds, which are a conservative lot. 

 He also said the approach being adopted in fuller rupee float is conservative, cautious and sometimes inconsistent.

 P-notes are like contract notes issued against an underlying security, usually to investors who are otherwise not eligible to invest in India.

 From around 15-20 per cent of net FII inflows coming through P-notes in 2002-03, it rose to 47 per cent in April last year and jumped to 52 per cent in March, 2006.

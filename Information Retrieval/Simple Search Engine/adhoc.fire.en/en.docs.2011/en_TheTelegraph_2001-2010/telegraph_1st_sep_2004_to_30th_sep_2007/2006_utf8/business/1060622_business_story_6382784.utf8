 Race hots up for Italy bourse

 Paris/Frankfurt, June 21 (Reuters): Pan-European stock exchange operator Euronext said on Wednesday it was to about to start more in-depth talks with Borsa Italiana as prospects of a takeover battle grew with Deutsche Boerse also showing interest in the Italian bourse.

 Talks between Euronext and Borsa Italiana continue and we will start to discuss more detailed terms, a Euronext spokeswoman said, reacting to a report in a French daily that it could make an offer to Borsa Italiana today or by Friday.

 La Tribune pegged the offer at between 1.0 billion euros ($1.26 billion) and 1.4 billion euros.

 Borsa Italiana confirmed that talks were continuing.

 Euronext said it was about to discuss detailed terms of a deal with Borsa Italiana, while a Deutsche Boerse supervisory board member said the German exchange ? which is also trying to woo Euronext ? could make an offer for the Italian exchange.

 The supervisory board has not discussed in concrete terms an offer for Borsa Italiana, the Deutsche Boerse board member said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

 But it is quite obvious that Deutsche Boerse will review all merger possibilities, especially since Euronext continues to reject Frankfurts offer, the board member said.

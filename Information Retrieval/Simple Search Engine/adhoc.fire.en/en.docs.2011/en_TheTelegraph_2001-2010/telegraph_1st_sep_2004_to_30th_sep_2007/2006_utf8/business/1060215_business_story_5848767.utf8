 Lodha takes ICAI to court

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Calcutta, Feb. 14: The battle for the Rs 5,000-crore legacy of M.P. Birla is set to take a new turn with claimant Rajendra Singh Lodha opening another legal front: this time against the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI).

 He and his two sons, Harsh V. Lodha and Aditya V. Lodha, have filed three separate petitions against the ICAI in Calcutta High Court. The matter is likely to come up for hearing later this week.

 This is the third front being created in the will battle. At present, Lodha is locked in two legal battles ? the probate petition case in Calcutta High Court and a criminal suit in the Alipore court.

 The development follows complaints filed by three Calcutta-based chartered accountants against alleged professional misconduct of Lodha and his two sons.

 The ICAI sought comments from the Lodhas on the complaints filed against them.

 The Lodhas argued that there was no basis for these complaints and these should be dismissed in limine or on the threshold (before a particular procedure or proceeding takes place).

 The ICAI, however, stuck to its claim and said the Lodhas should respond in accordance with the councils guidelines.

 Countering the ICAI argument, the Lodhas, in their petitions, have asked why their plea for dismissal would not be considered by the council.

 Fox amp; Mandal, the solicitor firm for the Lodhas, could not be reached for comment.

 The three chartered accountants made their first move against Lodha and his two sons in October 2004, months after a legal battle broke out between the Birla family and Lodha.

 Later, the ICAI asked the chartered accountants to file three separate petitions against Lodha and his sons.

 .P. Agarwal, Shashi Agarwal and Suresh K. Sharma filed three separate joint petitions afresh during June-July 2005.

 They highlighted five instances of professional misconduct on behalf of the Lodhas, the most important being the conflict of interest relating to MP Birla group companies.

 They claimed that the Lodhas have been actively involved in the management and business of MP Birla firms and yet they are acting as statutory auditors of them.

 They also claimed that the Lodhas are engaged in other businesses in violation of the ICAI norms.

 Moreover, the number of partners in Lodha amp; Company, which is 14, is fictitious as in reality it is a partnership of three ? Lodha and his two sons. 

 These three persons were set up by the Birlas to malign them and influence the probate petition of the 1999 will of late Priyamvada Birla, said sources close to the Lodha camp.

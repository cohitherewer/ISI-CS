 Tata Tea profit dips 25%

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, June 6: Tata Teas net profit in the fourth quarter has dropped 25 per cent to Rs 19.32 crore from Rs 25.83 crore in the corresponding previous period. Total income fell to Rs 243.53 crore from Rs 249.36 crore in the year-ago period. In 2005-06, net profit rose to Rs 186.93 crore from Rs 128.92 crore. Total income was Rs 1,040.01 crore against Rs 950.05 crore in 2004-05.

 The board has recommended a dividend of Rs 12, or 120 per cent, on shares of Rs 10 each.

 The figures of the previous year are not strictly comparable with those of the current year in view of the amalgamation of Tata Tetley and exit from plantations in South India. 

 Tata Teas consolidated worldwide turnover for the year was Rs 3,150.86 crore. 

 , up 2 per cent from that of the preceding year. The consolidated profit before tax prior to non-recurring items rose 15 per cent to Rs 411.14 crore. It also posted a 39 per cent higher net profit at Rs 299.15 crore. 

 The turnover reflected a strong branded volume growth in India and a stable performance in other markets partly offset by an exit from South Indian plantations, the company said. As much as 88 per cent of the companys consolidated worldwide turnover was contributed by its branded tea operations.

 Regarding its standalone performance, Tata Tea said it was driven by a strong performance in brand sales, which grew by 12 per cent and an amalgamation of Tata Tetley (an erstwhile subsidiary). It was partly offset by a reduction in sales due to exit from 23 estates in South India.

 Exceptional items included profit on sale of undertaking in South India at Rs 40.88 crore partly offset by amortisation of employee separation scheme and commercial tax for a discontinued business. Consequently, the net profit for the year was 45 per cent higher than the preceding year and a record for the company.

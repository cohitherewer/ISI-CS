 Heat and dust over ore export future

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 Ramesh and Paswan: For the motion

 New Delhi, Aug. 4: To export or not to export a battle is on in the government over the shape of the policy on iron ore, given the voracious appetite for this scarce resource among domestic steel units.

 Plenty of table thumping is expected at an impending meeting of the Union cabinet, which will discuss the pros and cons of the export, including a proposal to barter iron ore for high-quality coal. 

 The ban lobby is spearheaded by steel minister Ram Vilas Paswan and minister of state for commerce Jairam Ramesh. While Paswan favours a gradual phasing out of exports, Ramesh wants to end exports by 2010.

 The ministers feel the country should focus on exporting steel products using scarce ore rather than export the mineral.

 However, sections within the mines and commerce ministry believe the policy of exporting ore should continue as it brings in some $4 billion annually in foreign exchange earnings.

 Though agreements have been signed recently with Korea and Japan to sell an increased volume of 8.35 million tonnes (mt) in the next five years, there are many within and outside the government, including the Left, who argue for keeping the resource for domestic consumption. The total ore reserves are 22.1 billion tonnes, comprising 11.42 billion tonnes of hematite and 10.68 tonnes of magnetite, of which only 45 per cent is viable. 

 The case for ban by the steel lobby is based on a doomsday scenario of total depletion of reserves in 50 years if exports are allowed to continue. The projection is based on a more than five-fold increase in steel output to 210 million tonnes from 40 million tonnes now, necessitating massive use of the ore. 

 The steel industry is aghast at cheap export of high-grade ore to Japan. Such exports should be kept in check as the domestic industry is expanding and needs the ore. 

 The clamour for ban is getting the zest from China and Australia cutting down on the export of coal, another critical input for steel, from about 10-12 mt a year to 2 mt to benefit their steel units. China and Australia are the two largest producers of coal in the world.

 Noting the development, Planning Commission officials believe this creates an ideal opportunity for India to do a deal on bartering high-quality coal for ore. 

 A contest over scarce raw materials is emerging. We cant just go ahead and give away our strategic reserves of high-class ore even as others are doing the opposite, point out top officials in the Planning Commission.

 The Left, too, feels that local companies should get priority over resources. 

 They believe a scarce resource such as iron ore should be reserved for the local steel industry which, like the Tatas and SAIL, has drawn up huge expansion plans. 

 They said in Orissa alone five mega steel plants are in the offing, with plans to produce 21.1 mt at an investment of Rs 47,000 crore.

 The state has also signed MoUs with 23 smaller players who aim to have a combined capacity of 13.81 mt for Rs 16,175 crore.

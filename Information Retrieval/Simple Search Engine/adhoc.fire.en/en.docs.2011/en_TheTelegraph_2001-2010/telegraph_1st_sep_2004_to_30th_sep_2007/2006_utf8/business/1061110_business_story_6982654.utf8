 Chidambaram: Showing the way

 New Delhi, Nov. 9: The cabinet today allowed Central Bank of India to restructure its equity capital base, paving the way for its planned public offer.

 The bank has been allowed to convert Rs 800 crore of its total Rs 1,124.14 crore equity capital into perpetual non-cumulative preference shares, finance minister P. Chidambaram said.

 The preference shares will carry an annual floating coupon rate of 8 per cent, which is benchmarked to 100 basis points above the repo rate. As the repo rate changes, the coupon rate will also automatically change, he said.

 The cabinet decision will shore up the balance sheet of the bank and enable it to raise capital at competitive rates, the minister said.

 Chidambaram said Indian Bank and Union Bank of India have already been allowed to restructure their equity base and the Central Bank of India proposal has been approved on similar lines.

 The capital restructuring will help the bank strengthen its capital adequacy ratio to the levels of internationally accepted Basel II norms. It would also provide more flexibility to the bank to raise capital from the market through a public offer by reducing its paid-up capital. 

 Petrochem region

 The cabinet committee on economic affairs (CCEA) today decided to refer the proposal to create petrochemicals and petroleum investment regions in the country to a group of ministers.

 One or two issues related to the proposal still needs to be sorted out, finance minister P. Chidambaram said.

 The group of ministers would be set up soon to formulate the final proposal, which will then be taken up by the CCEA again, he added.

 Sources said the government does not want to rush through with the proposal as each region would require 200 to 250 sq km land. Moreover, the government is yet to decide whether any fiscal concessions can be given for these regions.

 The Prime Ministers office had drawn up the proposal placed before the CCEA today.

 Cellular terms for spectrum fee

 New Delhi, Aug. 18: Cellular operators today agreed to pay for the use of spectrum for their 3G services but fixed a ceiling of Rs 2,000 crore on the fee to be paid in aggregate by all the operators for this scarce resource.

 In its meeting with telecom regulator Trai today, the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), which represents the GSM operators, said they were willing to pay for spectrum farming or the spectrum space which would be vacated by different government agencies. 

 COAI said Rs 1,000 crore would be a fair price in case one or two companies obtained spectrum; if five to six companies received spectrum, the amount could double to Rs 2,000 crore. 

 Trai, which advises the government on spectrum pricing, had convened a meeting with COAI and the Association of Unified Service Providers of India (Auspi), which represents CDMA operators to discuss spectrum allotments. 

 The discussions, however, turned out to be one-sided in the absence of Auspi. The meeting was important as both the parties were not only demanding spectrum in separate bands but also higher allocations for themselves.

 Trai had floated a consultation paper on spectrum allocation and pricing for 3G services and broadband in June. The regulator has obtained views from all the stakeholders and is expected to submit its recommendations by the end of September.

 Officials said the government planned to release spectrum over a three-year period, giving operators sufficient time to roll out 3G services such as instant downloads of live events like television shows, news tickers and stock market quotes that are expected to fetch huge revenues to the operators.

 Private telecom operators, including Reliance and the Tatas, have long been lobbying for the use of spectrum that is allegedly lying unutilised with government agencies.

 North Block prefers the spectrum to be auctioned like FM radio licences. Ratan Tata had even offered to pay Rs 1,500 crore for its use. However, the communication ministry is opposed to auctions. A compromise on this issue is likely soon.

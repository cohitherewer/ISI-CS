 United Phosphorus snaps up Dutch firm

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Feb. 14: United Phosphorus Ltd today said its subsidiary, Biowin Corporation Ltd, has acquired Advanta Netherlands Holdings BV in an all-cash deal from private equity firm Fox Paine amp; Co LLC. 

 The deal size is estimated to be around 100 million euros. Fox Paine held a 100 per cent stake in Advanta.

 United Phosphorus (UPL) will finance the deal from proceeds raised through the recent foreign currency convertible bonds and bank loans. Yes Bank was the financial and strategic adviser to UPL for the deal.

 If you look at some of the top life-science companies today, they have all evolved from crop or seed technology firms. So, with this acquisition, UPL has embarked upon a path towards a global life-science company, Aditya Sanghi, country head (investment banking), Yes Bank, told The Telegraph.

 Advanta, with a total sales of 61 million euros in 2005, is a leading supplier of seeds and seed technologies to major global and regional markets.

 Advanta has a strong presence in Australia, which is also an important market for UPL. Besides, it is also present in India, Thailand and Argentina, which are strongholds of UPL. So the acquisition makes sense, Sanghi added.

 United Phosphorus, with Rs 1,661-crore revenues for the year ended December 2005, is the largest Indian agrochemical company and among the top five generic firms globally. It is engaged in research, manufacture and distribution of agrochemicals and speciality chemicals across the globe.

 It exports to over 100 countries, with a focus on Europe and North America.

 In October 2005, UPL acquired a 100 per cent stake in Reposo for $11 million (Rs 49.6 crore). Reposo is a manufacturer and distributor of crop protection products located in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The sale includes all stocks and assets of the company, product registrations, manufacturing site and other property rights associated with the business of Reposo.

 The acquisition gave UPL a strong platform to expand globally and strengthen its presence in Latin America, which is one of the fastest growing agrochemical markets.

 It was UPLs third acquisition in the year following its takeover of Cequisa, a Spanish agrochemical company with 400 registrations worldwide and sales of 19.3 million euros. 

 In June 2005, UPL had acquired SWAL Corporation Ltd, formerly known as Shaw Wallace Agrochemicals Ltd, for Rs 23.4 crore.

 Greenply plans Uttaranchal facility

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 17: Greenply Industries Limited is set to close this fiscal with a turnover of Rs 300 crore. 

 The plywood manufacturer, which wants to position itself as an interior infrastructure company, plans to concentrate on value-added products to enter the mid-market segment. For this, a new manufacturing unit will be set up in Uttaranchal. 

 The mid-market segment in the plywood industry is growing at the fastest rate and accounts for 40-45 per cent of the total plywood business in the country, said Saurabh Mittal, joint managing director, Greenply Industries. 

 The new unit will be Greenplys fourth manufacturing facility, the existing units are located in Bengal, Nagaland and Rajasthan (for particle board lamination). 

 The manufacturing unit in Uttaranchal will be set up at an estimated cost of Rs 80 crore, which will be funded by a debt and equity mix, Mittal elaborated. 

 The plywood business of the company currently comprises 35 to 40 per cent of its Rs 300-crore turnover, while laminates constitute another 45 per cent, Mittal stated.

 The company is also expanding the capacity of its factory at Joka in Calcutta by 20 per cent at a cost of Rs 5 crore and that of the Nagaland unit at a cost of Rs 4 crore. 

 Last fiscal, the company had increased the capacity of its Alwar unit in Rajasthan, which makes laminated particle boards, by 50 per cent at an investment of Rs 12 crore. 

 The industry comprising plywood, decorative veneers, laminates, particle boards and medium density fibre (MDF) boards is estimated to be worth Rs 9000 crore. Out of this, the plywood and decorative veneers market accounts for Rs 6000 crore, while the laminates market range between Rs 1500 and Rs 2000 crore. The particle board market is also estimated at Rs 1500-2000 crore. 

 So far, we have been importing mother boards from Europe for making particle boards. But now we will manufacture the same in our new factory and this will enable us to take part in government projects and trade in particle boards, Mittal said.

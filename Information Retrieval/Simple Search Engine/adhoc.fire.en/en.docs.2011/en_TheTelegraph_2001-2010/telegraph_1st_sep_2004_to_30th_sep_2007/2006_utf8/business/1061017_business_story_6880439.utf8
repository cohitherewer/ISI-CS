 GAIL blueprint for methane cash drill

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Oct. 16: The GAIL-Arrow consortium plans to invest up to Rs 2,700 crore in the three coal bed methane (CBM) blocks in Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh that have been awarded to them by the government under the latest round of bidding for the blocks.

 GAIL director (business development) BS Negi said work on the methane blocks would start early next year and commercial operations from 2011-12.

 The total capital expenditure on the blocks is estimated at Rs 2,250 crore to 2,700 crore, with GAIL contributing in the range of Rs 900 crore to Rs 1,125 crore.

 The investments will be made over the entire duration of the project, which is 20 years, with the first five years for exploration and the remaining 15 for production of the gas. 

 The Rajmahal block in Jharkhand is the richest of the blocks having an estimated reserve of 5.5 trillion cubic feet (tcf) followed by the two blocks in Chhattisgarh, Mand Raigarh with 4.2 tcf and Tatapani-Ramkola with 1.9 tcf of reserves.

 Arrow Energy of Australia will provide the technology, while Tata Power which is a consortium partner in two of the three blocks will help to monetise the gas. 

 Sweden-based Energy Infrastructure Group, strategic long-term investor in the energy sector, has a 15 per cent stake in each of the three blocks.

 Arrow Energy, a leader in the CBM exploration and production, will operate the blocks. 

 quot;We feel GAIL executives are best suited for handling the operations in the Indian CBM blocks and will, therefore, be gradually handing over operations to them, quot; Davies said. CBM is currently being produced only in the US and Australia. 

 Arrow CEO Nick Davies said as much as 40 per cent of the gas of the Queensland state of Australia was being met through CBM and by next year Arrow will be supplying as much as 25 per cent of the total gas requirement to the state.

 CBM is used mainly in the power sector, and the high cost of LNG has made it attractive for commercial production. 

 Davies said that the cost of producing CBM was lower than natural gas, and Arrow would bring to India cutting-edge technology that would help to produce the gas at low cost.

 Meanwhile, GAIL is keen to partner Arrow in Australia, China and Indonesia. 

 Davies said GAIL and its Indian consortium partners have been offered a 50 per cent stake in four of the companys CBM blocks in Australia. The blocks are spread over 25,000 square km and the total stake has been roughly valued at $ 300 million. 

 The four blocks are located in and around Brisbane. One of the blocks Daandine has already started producing CBM while the other three - Coastal Queensland, Dindee and Clarence Miratan are still at various stages of exploration, he said.

 Negi said the company was doing a due diligence of the CBM venture.

 Arrow and GAIL are in the advanced stage of negotiations with with Chinese and Indonesian companies for CBM opportunities in the two countries. 

 Davies said both GAIL and Arrow have a presence in China, and the two were building on the existing relationships to expand into CBM exploration and production. 

 Davies disclosed that the Indonesian authorities were putting new laws into place so that foreign investment could come into the country.

 GAIL today said it would announce its second-quarter and half-yearly unaudited results for the year 2006-07 on October 30. The board of directors would consider the unaudited financial results for the period ended September 30, the company informed the Bombay Stock Exchange. Shares of the company were trading at Rs 260.85, up 0.46 per cent on the BSE.

 Sahara plans big in PCs

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 21: As part of its plans to extend the reach of its product range and strengthen its presence, Sahara Computers and Electronics Ltd has signed agreements with some of the top retailers expected to enter the Indian market. 

 We have signed the agreement with a top Australian retail chain, which is coming to Mumbai, and also IT Junction for offering our products through retail chain, said George Van Der Merwe, chief operating officer of Sahara Computers and Electronics. 

 We pioneered the concept of selling the computers at the retail chains and we would continue doing that, he said.

 Retail, corporate and channel partners are the three mediums from which the company obtains maximum business. 

 The company, a joint venture between Sahara India Pariwar and Sahara Computers Ltd, South Africa, launched its products in July 2005. Sahara Computers has already invested about Rs 400 crore for the first phase of growth, in which they plan to enter the C, D, and E category cities. 

 With increasing PC penetration, thats where we think a lot of growth will come from, said Van Der Merwe. 

 The company also has plans to set up a personal manufacturing facility in India by the middle of next year.

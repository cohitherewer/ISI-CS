 Mumbai, April 21: The Industrial Development Bank of India Ltd (IDBI) has posted a 6 per cent rise in net profit at Rs 201 crore for the fourth quarter ended March 31 compared with Rs 189 crore in the year-ago period.

 In 2005-06, IDBI has recorded a net profit of Rs 561 crore. However, the results cannot be compared with those of the previous year as the firm?s accounting period spanned only six months from October 1, 2004 to March 31, 2005. IDBI became a commercial bank with effect from October 1, 2004, when the erstwhile IDBI Bank Ltd was merged with IDBI.

 After its conversion to a bank, IDBI?s retail portfolio has increased and sanctions to infrastructure projects with long gestation periods have also risen. Chairman and managing director V.P. Shetty said retail assets rose by Rs 2,820 crore during 2005-06 to Rs 8,520 crore. They now constitute over 16 per cent of the total advances against 12.5 per cent on March 31, 2005. There was a two-fold increase in sanctions to long-gestation infrastructure projects and over three-fold rise in disbursements to this sector. Sanctions amounted to Rs 10,181 crore and disbursements stood at Rs 4,855 crore.

 Shetty said the bank has significantly reduced its non-performing assets (NPAs). This was largely because of aggressive recovery efforts. The total recovery was Rs 1,738 crore in 2005-06, of which over 61 per cent (Rs 1,066 crore) comprised cash recovery from fully written-off cases. As a result, the gross NPA to advance ratio came down to 2 per cent from 2.5 per cent on March 31, 2005. The net NPA ratio declined to 1.01 per cent from 1.74 per cent.

 On the impact of the recent RBI decision to increase the general provisioning requirement on standard advances to various sectors, including commercial real estate, Shetty said the total exposure of IDBI to commercial real estate was Rs 1,200 crore. G.V. Nageswara Rao, CEO (commercial banking), said increased provisioning on other retail assets would not hurt the bank as it has been making provisions in excess of RBI requirements.

 During 2005-06, the total income of IDBI was Rs 6,661 crore with interest income at Rs 5,381 crore.

 Loan repayment

 IDBI plans to continue repaying high-cost borrowings and refinance it with low-cost deposits to improve its net interest margins. Last fiscal, the bank reduced its cost of funds to 6.83 per cent from 7.35 per cent by repaying high-cost borrowings worth Rs 12,380 crore and refinancing it with low-cost deposits.

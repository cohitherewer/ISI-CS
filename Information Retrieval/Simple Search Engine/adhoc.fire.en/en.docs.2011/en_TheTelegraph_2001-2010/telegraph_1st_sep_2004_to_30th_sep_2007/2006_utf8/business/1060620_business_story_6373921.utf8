 Calcutta, June 19: Samsung India Electronics Pvt Ltd aims to become the largest electronics company in India with a $2-billion turnover by 2008. This calendar year, it is set to invest $20 million in capacity expansion.

 Samsung has already invested part of the money towards setting up the first liquid crystal display television facility in Noida.

 The flat panel, which includes LCD and plasma screen televisions, will touch 200,000 units this fiscal from 50,000 last year. Samsung with its recently-launched Bordeaux LCD range expects to sell 100,000 units and take its market share from 46.5 per cent to 50 per cent, said Ravinder Zutshi, deputy managing director, Samsung Electronics India Pvt Ltd.

 The company had a combined turnover of Rs 6,300 crore last calendar year and expects a 20 per cent growth this year. The growth drivers will be air conditioners and refrigerators in the home appliances segment and flat panel, home theatre and digital business in the audio visual segment.

 Audio visual and home appliances have contributed 54 per cent and information technology 27 per cent to the total turnover. The balance has come from telecommunications. 

 LCD television is expected to contribute 5 per cent by value to Samsungs television turnover next year and 15 per cent the following year.

 The total television market is estimated to be at 8.9 million units this year. Out of this, flat television will comprise 64 per cent, which is growing at more than 40 per cent. The company has started selling flat panel TVs from last year.

 Last year, Samsung Electronics earned a revenue of Rs 100 crore from exports to Saarc countries and expects Rs 150 crore this year.

 It is aiming at increasing the AC market share from 18 to 28 per cent, refrigerators from 16 to 19 per cent and home theatres from 22 to between 23 and 25 per cent.

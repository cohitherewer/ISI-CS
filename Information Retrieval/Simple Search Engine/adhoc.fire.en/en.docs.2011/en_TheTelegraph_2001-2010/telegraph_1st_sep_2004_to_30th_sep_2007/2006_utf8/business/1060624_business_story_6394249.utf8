 Tata Motors in cash overdrive

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, June 23: Tata Motors is going into a fund raising spree to part-finance a Rs 10,000-crore capital expenditure plan for product development, capacity enhancement and modernisation that will be spread over the next three to four years.

 The company is planning to raise up to Rs 3,000 crore from domestic or international markets even as it is seeking shareholders? permission at its AGM on July 11 to raise its borrowing limit to Rs 7,000 crore from Rs 5,000 crore.

 Tata Motors informed shareholders that the proposed Rs 3,000 crore will be raised through issue of equity or equity-linked instruments to domestic/foreign institutions, NRIs, mutual funds, banks, insurance companies, individuals or others either through a public issue or on a private placement basis. 

 As the paid-up share capital of the company will increase after the issue or conversion of these securities, Tata Motors is proposing to raise its authorised share capital to Rs 450 crore from Rs 410 crore.

 While giving a broad overview of the proposed Rs 1-lakh car in the annual report, Tata Motors chairman Ratan Tata said the company had completed its styling and designing and tested the prototypes within the plant.

 The launch of the car would create a new paradigm in low-cost personal transport, carve out a new market segment and reach a broader base of the pyramid, Tata said.

 ?The styling and designing has been completed and protoypes are being tested in the plant. It will be a rear engine, 4-5 seat, four-door car with about a 30 horsepower engine,? Tata added.

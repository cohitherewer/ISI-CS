 HDFC sees brisk trade on back of block deal

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, June 26: The Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) emerged the top-traded share on the BSE today on the back of a huge block deal between two Citigroup entities. The deal saw around 75 lakh HDFC shares changing hands in a transaction worth Rs 811.32 crore on a day when the sensex tumbled 371 points due to concerns over rising interest rates.

 Despite the block deal, HDFC shares declined by Rs 57.15 to close at Rs 1046.25 on the BSE.

 Citigroup Holdings Mauritius Ltd bought 74.44 lakh shares from Citigroup Global Markets Mauritius Pvt Ltd at a price of Rs 1,085 apiece. Close to 75.51 lakh HDFC shares were transacted on the exchange, resulting in a turnover of Rs 819.25 crore.

 In May, European financial services company Standard Life sold its 9.27 per cent stake in HDFC to Citigroup for Rs 3,000 crore. This made Citigroup the largest foreign investor in HDFC. 

 As on March 31, 2006, Citigroup Global Mauritius held 3.59 per cent in HDFC. 

 Todays deal would put Citigroups total shareholding in the company at 12.86 per cent. Citigroup will now get a representation on the HDFC board.

 The deal also gave Citigroup an indirect stake in HDFC Bank, which is controlled by HDFC. Citigroup, however, cannot expand its stake in the private sector bank beyond 5 per cent because of the existing RBI guidelines. 

 According to analysts, Citigroups picking up a stake in HDFC is an indication of its intention to grow through the inorganic route in India when the sector opens up.

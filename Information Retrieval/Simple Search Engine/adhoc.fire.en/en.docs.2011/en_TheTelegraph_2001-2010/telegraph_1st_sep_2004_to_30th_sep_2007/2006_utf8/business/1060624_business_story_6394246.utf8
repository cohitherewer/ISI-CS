 Prop for Mangalore Refinery

 S.P.S. PANNU 

 Mangalore, June 23: ONGC plans to invest Rs 8,000 crore to expand the capacity of Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Limited to 15 million tonnes (mt) from 9.69 mt.

 ONGC chairman R.S. Sharma said naphtha from the refinery will be the feedstock for paraxylene and benzene to be produced at the aromatics facility here. 

 The aromatics facility is part of the Rs 4,900-crore petrochemical complex of ONGC in the region.

 The foundation-stone laying ceremony for the complex, scheduled for today, had to be postponed as the plane carrying Prime Minister Manmohan Singh could not land at the airport due to poor visibility. 

 The aromatics project would be completed in three years after finalisation of the process licensor and engineering, which is expected in a years time. 

 ONGC will invest Rs 35,000 crore in the Mangalore Special Economic Zone (M-SEZ) that will house the refinery, petrochemical complex, a power plant and an LNG terminal. 

 Support services, including banking and insurance, are likely to be undertaken at the M-SEZ to make it self sustainable, ONGC officials said. The M-SEZ is likely to be the first petroleum, chemicals, and petrochemicals investment region (PCPIR) in the country.

 SPLIT ON OWNERSHIP, UNITED ON GOALS

 Few years will go down as far in the memory lane as 2005, a year that saw corporate landscape shake in a way that left markets and investors rattled.

 And, if there was one defining change in India Inc, it must have to do with Reliance, one of the biggest companies that moves the bourses like no other private entity.

 The Rs 1,00,000-crore conglomerate was revamped in a momentous settlement hammered out on June 18, when months of simmering differences between Mukesh and Anil Ambani burst into a confrontation that left little doubt Dhirubhai?s successors would stay together.

 Reliance Infocomm, Mukesh?s pet venture, went to Anil, who already presided over Reliance Energy and Reliance Capital. The elder sibling retained flagship Reliance and Indian Petrochemicals Corporation Ltd (IPCL).

 The first signs the two brothers were going different ways came on November 18, 2004, when Mukesh told a television channel there were ?ownership issues in the group?. What followed was seven months of intense drama and by 2005, Anil quit the board of IPCL. He blamed director Anand Jain for conspiring to drive a wedge between the two brothers. The differences did not end there. The younger brother even sent the government a complaint that his phones were being bugged. 

 Though a solution began to take shape as early as February, it was one Saturday morning in June that mother Kokilaben Ambani issued a statement saying she had ?amicably resolved all issues between her two sons?. Under the settlement, Anil resigned as vice-chairman and MD of RIL, a firm he oversaw for 21 years.

 On December 9, Reliance won the approval of Mumbai High Court for the demerger scheme, which became effective when the company filed the certified copy of the ruling with the registrar of companies (RoC).

 As Anil took the inorganic route, many in India Inc went the same way in their quest for quick growth, and they did so by clinching companies overseas. Corporate India was abuzz with a large number of cross-border deals. The buyouts were made across sectors and, for the first time, a public sector bank (SBI) snapped up two foreign banks.

 Tata Steel forged a deal to purchase Millennium Steel, Videocon tuned into Thomson, Tata Chemicals had a special chemistry with Brunner Mond, Apeejay swallowed Premier Foods (Tea). There were several more. 

 Other big buys of the year were that of Holcim, which picked up a stake in ACC, Vodafone bought a slice of Bharti?s equity and Rajeev Chandrasekhar sold his holding in BPL Mobile and BPL Communications to Essar for over $1 billion. Merrill Lynch paid $500 million to almost buy out its partner, DSP, in DSP Merrill Lynch. 

 There was a reverse swing, too, when it came to acquisitions. Weeks back Dubai Financial bought Thomas Cook?s stake in its Indian unit and, on December 30, Malaysia?s Maxis teamed up with the Reddy?s of the Apollo group to snap up Aircel for $1.08 billion.

 A KPMG report on acquisitions vouched for it: India was the fifth-most targeted nation in cross-border deals and the seventh-most active acquirer in Asia last year.

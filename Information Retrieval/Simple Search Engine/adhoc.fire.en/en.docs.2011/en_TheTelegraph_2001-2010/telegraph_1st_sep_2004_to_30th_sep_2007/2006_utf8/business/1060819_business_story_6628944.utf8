 Pantaloon to go shopping for funds

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Aug. 18: Pantaloon Retail India Ltd is planning to raise funds for its expansion plans a move that is generating interest at a time when retailing major Reliance Industries is preparing to create a storm.

 In a notice sent to the Bombay Stock Exchange today, Kishore-Biyani-owned Pantaloon Retail said the board of directors would meet on August 24 to consider funding options.

 The company spokesperson said it was a routine meeting and refused to spell out any details, but the market was agog with Biyanis plans.

 It is believed that Pantaloon Retail could be looking at an expansion of close to 30 million square feet by 2010. According to industry sources, the company has close to 3.2 million square feet at the end of June 2006. It is believed that more than 50 per cent of the 30 million square feet space is already booked.

 The company is looking at a capital expenditure of close to Rs 1,800 crore by 2010. Its working capital requirement will also be close to Rs 1,800 crore so the total money it is looking at spending by 2010 will be close to Rs 3,600 crore, said a retail analyst. 

 The company plans to expand all its store brands. They are looking at expanding on a pan-India basis, said an analyst. 

 The company could be looking at close to 80 Pantaloon stores by 2010 from the present 20. The total area will go up from 0.5 million sq feet to 2 million square feet. The company is looking at close to 22 Central Malls by 2010 from three at present. The number of Big Bazaar outlets will go up from 30 to 225 by 2010, increasing the area from 1.25 million to 9 million square feet. 

 The number of Food Bazar outlets is expected to go up from 43 now to 250 by 2010. The area is expected to go up from 0.04 million square feet to 2.5 million square feet. 

 The company has set itself a giant task, believes the industry. 

 This is a mammoth task and there is a great execution risk. There is a severe shortage of manpower in the industry. Pantaloon is a poaching ground for the new players. But we have to wait and watch, said Sageraj Bariya, research analyst at Religare Securities.

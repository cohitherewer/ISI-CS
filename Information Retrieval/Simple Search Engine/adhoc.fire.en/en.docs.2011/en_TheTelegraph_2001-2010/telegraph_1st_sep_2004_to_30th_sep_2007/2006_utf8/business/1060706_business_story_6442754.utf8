 LNM touchdown plan raises Orissa hopes

 Mittal: Let?s talk

 Bhubaneswar, July 5: A week after outlining his expansion plan in India and China, steel tycoon Lakshmi Niwas Mittal is flying down to Bhubaneswar on Friday in his Gulfstream jet to discuss a greenfield project in Orissa with chief minister Naveen Patnaik.

 Patnaik, whom a Mittal Steel senior executive described as a good friend of Mittal, is scheduled to receive the steel tycoon at 10 am at his office. However, Orissa government officials or Mittal Steel executives refused to let out the details of Mittal?s visit to Orissa. 

 ?I don?t know about the agenda. They are two tall men. They know each other quite well. We have to wait to see what they discuss,? Mittal Steel CEO Sanak Mishra told The Telegraph. Mishra will reach Bhubaneswar tomorrow to oversee the arrangements for the meeting.

 Mishra said the proposed Orissa project would not affect the 12-million-tonne steel project in Jharkhand. ?We can have two separate projects at the same time. They would not affect each other,? he said.

 The 56-year-old Mittal, who today got the regulatory approvals from Spain, Luxembourg, France and Belgium for completing the $33.7-billion deal to create Arcelor-Mittal, will arrive at the Biju Patnaik airport at 8 am. He will be driven down to a hotel before meeting Patnaik. 

 During his visit, Mittal is likely to meet Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and petroleum minister Murli Deora in New Delhi. Besides steel and mines, Mittal has also expressed interest in the country?s hydrocarbon sector. Mittal Steel already has a tie-up with state-run ONGC for exploration. He would probably take up the issue when he meets Singh and Deora during the visit. 

 Orissa steel and mines secretary L.N. Gupta indicated that Mittal will discuss a possible investment in a greenfield project in Orissa. The steel baron would also review the progress of the 12-million- tonne steel plant at an estimated investment of Rs 40,000 crore in Jharkhand, for which he had signed an MoU with the Jharkhand government last year.

 At the state secretariat, IAS officers led by chief secretary Subas Pani held several meetings to discuss the agenda of Friday?s meet. Pani, who had scripted the 12-million- tonne Posco deal, met a few senior officers, including steel secretary Gupta and industries secretary GC Pati. 

 Orissa has so far signed 43 MoUs for steel plants, including South Korean steel major Posco which is building a greenfield steel plant near Paradip port. If all the plants are built, the projected steel output would touch 58.04 million tonnes. 

 Of the 43 companies that have signed the MoU, more than 12 have completed their financial closure and invested more than 25 per cent project cost, thereby becoming eligible for recommendation of mines lease, officials in the steel amp; mines department said.

 The state now has a reserve of 5,428 million tonnes of iron ore, of which 3,133 million tonnes have been leased out to different companies. 

 A reserve of 1,529 million tonnes of iron ore is now left with the State Government.

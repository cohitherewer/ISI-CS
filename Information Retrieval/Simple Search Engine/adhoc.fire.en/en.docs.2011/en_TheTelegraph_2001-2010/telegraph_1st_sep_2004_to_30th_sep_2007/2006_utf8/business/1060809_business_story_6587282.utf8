 BNKe plans expansion

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Aug. 8: Riding the business process outsourcing (BPO) boom, BNKe Solutions is drawing up expansion plans, both in Calcutta and in the districts. 

 The company will set up an integrated campus, with a built-up space of almost 4,50,000 sq ft, on a 1.12-acre plot at Sector V in Salt Lake. It is to be completed in the next 18 to 20 months. One of the oldest call centre companies in Calcutta, BNKe is also scouting for space in Durgapur and Siliguri. The company has been operational since 2000.

 A chunk of our business is inbound, so it makes sense for us to be in multiple locations. With the state government augmenting infrastructure in district towns and leased lines and tri-band connectivity available at these centres, moving to Durgapur and Siliguri is natural, said Suresh Menon, COO of BNKe Solutions.

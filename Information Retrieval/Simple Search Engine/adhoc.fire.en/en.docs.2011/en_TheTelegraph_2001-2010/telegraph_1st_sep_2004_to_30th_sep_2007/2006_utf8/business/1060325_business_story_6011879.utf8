 HCL wins Rs 804-crore tax case 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Nadar: Glad tidings

 Mumbai, March 24: Shiv Nadar, the principal promoter of the HCL group, has reasons to smile. 

 HCL Corporation today won a major battle when the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT) set aside a claim of Rs 804 crore made on HCL Corporation, a group holding company, by the tax department.

 HCL Corporation has an equity stake of 50 per cent in HCL Technologies Ltd and 44.3 per cent in HCL Infosystems Ltd. The victory at the tax tribunal will, however, have no impact on both these listed companies.

 Sources said the case that dates back to 2003 involved capital gains dues of over Rs 800 crore. It happened when HCL Corporation and other group companies sold over 70 lakh shares of HCL Technologies to Mauritius-based Wintech Investments, an overseas corporate body, at a price of Rs 50 per share in 1999. 

 The tax department, which had conducted searches at the group in January 2002, maintained that documents seized during these searches showed documentary evidence of capital gains evasion. 

 According to the department, the fair valuation of these shares, which were sold, worked out to Rs 1800 per share. Raising a demand of over Rs 800 crore, the department contended that the promoter companies not only made a capital gain but also concealed income from these gains.

 However, in a huge setback to the income tax authorities, the tribunal today absolved HCL Corporation of the Rs 804-crore demand. 

 Officials from HCL Corporation, who did not want to comment on todays order, only said they would be able to provide more details only upon obtaining the order from the tribunal. 

 We as a group would not like to comment on income tax related matters. However, we can say that the case has been decided in our favour, an official pointed out.

 A statement issued by the company later said, HCL Corporation has been in appeal before the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal against the order of the assessing officer who had raised a demand of Rs 804 crore against it. The appeal has now been decided in favour of HCL Corporation. HCL Corporation is pleased with the order passed by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal which vindicates our stand.

 HCL Corporation wants to reiterate the fact that it has meticulously followed the regulatory procedures and laws of the land, the company added.

 Crude surge whets oil bond appetite

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Shadow of loss

 New Delhi, July 27: The petroleum ministry is likely to seek Rs 6,000 crore more of bonds from the finance ministry to fortify the oil companies from rising under-recoveries due to the flare-up in crude prices.

 The ministry has estimated the demand for oil bonds at Rs 34,153 crore as it anticipates the revenue loss of the oil companies from the sale of petrol, diesel, LPG and kerosene to cross Rs 91,000 crore.

 The loss, from under-recoveries on the sale of four petroleum products, was pegged at Rs 73,512 crore on June 5, the day the ministry increased the price of petrol by Rs 4 per litre and diesel by Rs 2. It was then decided to issue oil bonds worth Rs 28,000 crore to meet more than one-third of the loss.

 However, with crude prices shooting up by $5 per barrel to around $73, the losses mounted. The subsidy burden on ONGC ? the PSU provides discounts on the sale of crude to the companies to partially bridge the under-recovery ? will also be more than the initial amount of Rs 24,000 crore after the latest round of increase in crude prices.

 Under-recoveries in the first quarter, between April and June, was Rs 17,398 crore; this is expected to rise by another Rs 73,655 crore by the end of the fiscal on the basis of current prices.

 The finance ministry is yet to issue the first tranche of quarterly bonds, putting the oil companies under great pressure. The bonds are interest-bearing IOU slips of the government that oil companies can include in their balance sheets. The companies can also sell these bonds at a discount if they fall short of liquidity.

 The finance ministry issues the bonds in tranches, to minimise the burden on the exchequer. It tends to delay the issue as it sees this relief within the broader strategy of managing the fiscal deficit.

 GE Ship charts growth plans

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Oct. 9: The Sheths of The Great Eastern Shipping Company Ltd (GE Shipping) are demerging the firms offshore services division into a separate company. At the same time, they have drawn up a capex plan of more than $800 million to expand the shipping and offshore fleet.

 GE Shipping now has 39 ships in its fleet, comprising 30 tankers and nine dry bulk carriers with an average age of over 12 years. However, with fundamentals on the tanker and dry bulk trade looking positive, the company has charted an expansion plan. 

 In a recent presentation, the company said a capex of over $500 million has been committed wherein nine tankers and five medium-range product carriers, apart from two other second-hand tankers, will be inducted into its fleet.

 In the offshore front, a capex of more than $300 million has been committed to add four platform supply vessels (PSVs) and at least six anchor handling tug supply (AHTS) vessels. While PSVs are ships designed to supply offshore oil platforms, AHTS can supply oil platforms, tow them to a location and anchor them. The company now has 35 offshore vessels that service oil fields.

 GE Shipping feels fundamentals in the offshore business also look good as fresh investments are being planned towards exploration and production (E amp;P). Moreover, a vast portion of the acreage remain unexplored. This is expected to result in strong earnings from offshore support vessels.

 In August, GE Shipping decided to stick with the plan to spin off its offshore services division into a separate company called Great Offshore Ltd. The directors then decided to extend the deadline for demerger of this division.

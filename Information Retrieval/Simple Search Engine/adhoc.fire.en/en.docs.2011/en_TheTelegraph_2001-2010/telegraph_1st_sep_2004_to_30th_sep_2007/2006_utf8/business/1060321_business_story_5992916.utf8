 Finance bill cleared with minor duty rejig

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, March 20: The government today restored excise duty exemption on hand-made candles and bricks and waived customs duty on stents used in heart ailments. Scented supari packets with a 50 paise price tag have also been exempted from excise duty. 

 Customs duties on polyester chips and carbon black feedstock were reduced by 2.5 percentage points, while excise duty exemption on 50 paise scented supari packets has also been restored. 

 The changes were made through amendments in the finance bill that was cleared by the Lok Sabha today. Finance minister P. Chidambaram also announced that manually operated rubber roller machines and copra driers will not attract excise duty.

 Chidambaram also corrected some inverted duty structures by reducing customs duty on polyester chips and carbon black feedstock from 12.5 percent to 10 percent.

 The minister exempted stents to be used in coronary ailments from five per cent customs duty and four per cent countervailing duty as it is a life saving item. 

 Winding up the discussions on the Finance Bill, he said there was a misconception and misgiving that all soaps would now attract 16 per cent duty and clarified that toilet and laundry soaps manufactured by small-scale units with a turnover of up to Rs 1 crore, cooperative, khadi and village industries and by self-help groups would continue to get tax exemption.

 Only those soaps manufactured by large industries would attract excise duty, he said.

 However, the minister declined to restore the excise duty exemption on umbrellas, cutting and polishing of marbles.

 Chidambaram also ruled out extending the 8 per cent cut in excise on man-made fibres to raw material like PTA and DMT for manufacturing polyester yarn saying they had huge tax implications.

 Regarding the demand for withdrawing eight per cent excise duty on packaged software, Chidambaram said customised software continued to get tax exemption and, hence, it would not affect the growing software industry.

 He also clarified that no excise duty on coir and coir products has been levelled as alleged by some members.

 Chidambaram justified the decision to remove tax exemption to infrastructure firms under section 23 (g) of the Income Tax Act which provides for no taxes on capital gains, dividends and interest cost.

 As most of the capital gains and dividends on infrastructure firms are exempt from tax, it would apply only on interest costs and the tax incidence would only be 0.2 per cent to 0.3 per cent, he said.

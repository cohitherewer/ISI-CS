 NYSE bets on strategic pact, buyout

 Looking ahead

 Singapore, April 15 (Reuters): The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) said it was in talks regarding an acquisition or strategic alliance, in a further sign major world exchanges are getting ready to consolidate the sector.

 Recently listed NYSE Group said in a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission, a US regulator, that merger activity by other exchanges threatened the position of the worlds largest stock market in an intensely competitive industry. 

 The move this week by rival Nasdaq Stock Market to become London Stock Exchanges largest shareholder has heightened speculation of imminent mergers, pushing up bourse share prices even further.

 The market for acquisition targets and strategic alliances is highly competitive, particularly in light of increasing consolidation in the securities industry, which may adversely affect our ability to find acquisition targets or strategic partners, NYSE said in the filing posted on Friday to the SECs website.

 We are currently engaged in discussions with certain participants, although no definitive terms have been discussed or agreements reached.

 NYSE said it would need to respond to potential opportunities quickly and decisively and a strategic transaction may occur at any time. The NYSE gave no other details, but some analysts have said it may bid for the LSE while others say it might target either Amsterdam-based Euronext NV or Frankfurts Deutsche Boerse, the two other big European markets. LSE shares have doubled this year, Euronext shares have leapt by half and Deutsche Boerse and Nasdaq stocks are up more than 20 per cent.

 NYSE shares have jumped nearly 17 per cent since it bought and then listed through electronic rival Archipelago in March, while shares in Singapore Exchange, which has said it is open to partnerships, have jumped 44 per cent in 2006.

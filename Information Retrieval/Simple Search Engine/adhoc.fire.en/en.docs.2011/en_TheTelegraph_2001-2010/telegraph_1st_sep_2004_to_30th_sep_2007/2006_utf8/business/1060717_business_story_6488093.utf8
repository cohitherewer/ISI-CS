 SAIL holds ground on Chiria

 Calcutta, July 16: The Steel Authority of India has refuted Jharkhand?s claim over the Chiria mines. The PSU insisted it was the ?successor? of the lease held by Indian Iron amp; Steel Company (IISCO).

 The Jharkhand government recently pulled up SAIL over violations in ?transferring? the lease after the merger of IISCO in February.

 The state issued a show-cause notice on July 6, threatening criminal proceedings and ordering the company to stop work in Gua and Chiria. It also demanded a reply within seven days.

 SAIL in its reply said IISCO?s agreement with the Bihar government had mentioned that the ?successor? would get the lease. (When the agreement was signed, Jharkhand was part of Bihar.)

 Even though SAIL was not mentioned as the ?successor?, the company claimed that status.

 IISCO was nationalised in 1972 and became a wholly owned subsidiary of SAIL in 1979. Holding 100 per cent of the company, SAIL claims to be the new lease holder of Chiria.

 Chiria has one of the largest deposits of high-grade iron ore in Asia. SAIL, after the merger of IISCO, has access to 1.4 billion tonnes of ore.

 Faced with diminishing stocks at its other reserves, the company is dependent on the deposits at Chiria to implement its ambitious expansion programmes.

 The Jharkhand government, however, is in a fix over offering reserves to the steel companies that have promised big-buck investments in the state.

 SAIL also argued that the IISCO merger was approved by the department of company affairs, and every detail was taken into account.

 The firm also countered the Jharkhand government?s claim that it was necessary to get a written permission from the state. It had informed the state government twice about the merger and sought directions from the state.

 The government is believed to have been sitting on those correspondences. It has woken up only recently to shoot off a show-cause notice five months after the merger.

 It also argued that no ?transfer? of lease took place from IISCO to SAIL as the merger meant that all estate, title, rights and liabilities of IISCO would now be vested with SAIL.

 Observers say the politics of Chiria has taken a new dimension after L.N. Mittal publicly expressed his unhappiness over the progress of his proposal to set up a 12-million-tonne steel plant, at an investment of Rs 40,000 crore, in the state.

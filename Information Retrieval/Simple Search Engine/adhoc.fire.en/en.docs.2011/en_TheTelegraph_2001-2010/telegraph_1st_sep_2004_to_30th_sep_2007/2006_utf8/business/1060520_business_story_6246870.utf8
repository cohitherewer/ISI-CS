 Left warns against PF rate cut

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 19: The government today came under attack in the Lok Sabha over its reported move to reduce the interest on employees provident fund to 8 per cent from 8.5 per cent.

 In a letter written to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, CPI leader Gurudas Dasgupta warned the government against such a move and dubbed it as an ominous step.

 This, in my opinion, is intended to force subscribers to look for private provident fund scheme or to make the trade unions agree to invest a substantial part of the accumulation in the stock market, Dasgupta said. 

 CPM too joined in the chorus protesting the rate cut. Basudeb Acharia, a sitting MP of CPM, said his party would oppose any further reduction in the EPF rate from the current 8.5 per cent. Raising the issue during zero hour, Dasgupta charged the government with ignoring Parliament and planning to announce the reduction in EPF rates at the back of Parliament.

 It is an anti-people and anti-worker move, he said and condemned finance minister P. Chidambaram for his reported refusal to give interests under the accumulated income scheme and for dismissing the parliamentary standing committees recommendation to hike the interest rate to 9.5 per cent.

 The Left, which has long been demanding an increase in EPF payout, considers Chidambarams refusal to increase the interest on the special deposit scheme to be the main cause of EPF Organisations woes.

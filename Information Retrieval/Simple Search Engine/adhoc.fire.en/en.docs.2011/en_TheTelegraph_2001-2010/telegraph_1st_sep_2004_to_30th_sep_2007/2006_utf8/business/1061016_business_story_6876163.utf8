 Neotia: New plans

 Calcutta, Oct. 15: The leisure division of city-based Bengal Ambuja group is diversifying into tea tourism a nouveau business opportunity that several tea companies themselves are exploring. 

 The group plans to build a resort in north Bengal and is looking for land in the Darjeeling district.

 We are looking for a suitable site in the Darjeeling district including tea gardens for this new resort. We do not have any experience in the tea business and, therefore, would be open to partnership with tea companies for tea tourism activities, said Harsh Neotia, managing director of Bengal Ambuja Group.

 The resort could be part of an existing tea garden as often only 60 per cent of a tea estates land is used for tea cultivation. 

 The group is also mulling the option of buying out a garden and turning it into a resort.

 Tea estates usually have one or two bungalows with not more than five to six rooms to spare for tourists. The scale of the resort will have to be much larger. However, we will work out the modalities including the investment amount and the actual size of the project once we have chosen the location, Neotia said.

 Bengal Ambuja already has a housing project on the erstwhile Chandmoni Tea Estate spread across 400 acres on the northern fringes of Siliguri along NH31.

 It is a joint venture between the Bengal Ambuja Housing Development Ltd and Luxmi Township Ltd in association with the West Bengal government.

 Asked whether the resort will sport the Radisson tag (like Ffort Radisson), Neotia said this would depend on the resorts location.

 Neotias company is looking for tieups with tea companies to provide tea tourism aspects that could range from tea factory visits, tea facial and spa activities, tea cuisine, tea tasting and plucking.

 Of the 86 operating gardens in the district of Darjeeling spread over 19,000 hectares, quite a few such as Glenbury, Gleburn and Makaibari have opted for tea tourism.

 Neotia said if not Darjeeling, the company would also be open to looking at gardens in Jalpaiguri.

 The West Bengal Tourism Department will also undertake tourism development of two tea estates belonging to the West Bengal Tea Development Corporation Limited the 709-hectare Hilla estate that has Nagarkata as the closest railway station and the 683-hectare Mahua estate with Hashimara being the closest railway station in the Dooars region.

 The state government had sought a grant of Rs 7.64 crore from the Centre for the project.

 Tea biggies like McLeod Russel India Ltd (MRIL) have also developed a sprawling tea heritage property at its Adabari tea estate in the Balipara division of Assam. 

 The Goodricke group also does it on a smaller scale at some of its tea estates.

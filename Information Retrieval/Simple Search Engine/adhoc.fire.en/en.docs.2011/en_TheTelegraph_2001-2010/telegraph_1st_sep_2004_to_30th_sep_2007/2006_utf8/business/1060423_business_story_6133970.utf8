The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Vesuvius first-quarter net profit up marginally

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Gupta: Upbeat

 Calcutta, April 22: Refractory maker Vesuvius India has posted a 24 per cent growth in revenue and 7 per cent growth in net profit during the first quarter ended March 31, 2006.

 During the January-March quarter, revenue grew to Rs 52.2 crore from Rs 42.5 crore in the same period last year.

 At the same time net profit grew marginally from Rs 5.9 crore to Rs 6.3 crore.

 The company says outlook for India is good. Francois Wanecq, president and CEO of Vesuvius Group, the global corporation that owns 54 per cent of the local outfit, said India and China would be two growth markets for the group.

 ?Steel industry demand would dictate the growth of refractory business here,? Wanecq said after the 15th annual general meeting of the company held here recently.

 Anticipating the demand, the company has expanded the Mahesana and Vishakhapatnam factories substantially and the expanded capacity will come into operation soon.

 However, Vesuvius has decided to stagger the expansion of the Calcutta unit, which mainly supplies to steel plants, to some extent.

 Instead of putting Rs 80-100 crore investment at a go, it has started a debottlenecking exercise.

 ?It seems that greenfield projects will take some time to materialise. The brownfield expansions will come up much faster. As a result, we have delayed investments for the time being,? Biswadip Gupta, managing director of Vesuvius added.

 Once debottlenecking is completed by the end of May, the capacity will go up from 800 pieces a day to 900 pieces a day. 

 The company is expecting to complete the full expansion programme by end of 2007. By that time, the capacity will go up to 1,600 pieces a day.

 Vesuvius has acquired land for this project. It has also sought for environment clearance for the same.

 Mumbai, Sept. 7: Jet Airways has flown into an air pocket and the turbulence has been caused by the decision of two of its top executives to quit the airline.

 The two executives include Dale Moss, the former worldwide director of British Airways, who had joined Jet Airways in May as the chief operating officer (COO). The other person is the airlines vice-president (human resources), Sarat Chandran. 

 Jet Airways chief executive Wolfgang Prock-Shauer could not be contacted for his comments. However, official sources confirmed the resignations, but could not say why they had left.

 It is learnt that both the executives had put in their papers last month.

 According to the grapevine, Moss had been appointed by the airlines promoter Naresh Goyal. The appointment had ruffled feathers in Jets senior management.

 Moss was overseeing areas relating to passenger sales, cargo and operations, information technology, network and communications. 

 Garry Kingshott, an Australian national, was appointed as chief commercial officer two months prior to the appointment of Moss. He replaced Peter Luethi and was slated to look after most of the functions of the chief operating officer. 

 Kingshott currently handles marketing and sales, commercial, airport services, and all aspects of customer service. 

 Chandran had joined Jet Airways in October 2003. He came from the Oberoi group of hotels where he worked for 10 years.

 Rajesh Verma, who was vice-president (customer and inflight services), had quit three months back to join rival Kingfisher Airlines. Four other marketing managers have also quit the airline in the recent past.

 Recently, Jet Airways appointed Shahrukh Khan as an additional director on its board of directors. The company has also appointed Pierre J. Jeanniot, former director-general and the present director-general emeritus of the International Air Transport Authority (IATA), as another additional director.

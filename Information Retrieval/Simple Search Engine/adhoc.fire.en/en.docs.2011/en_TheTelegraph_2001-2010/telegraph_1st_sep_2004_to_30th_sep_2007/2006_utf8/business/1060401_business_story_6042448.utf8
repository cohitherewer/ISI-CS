 Airport pact on course

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 31: The Airports Authority of India (AAI) will sign the operations, management and development agreement with GMR and GVK, the successful bidders for the modernisation of Delhi and Mumbai airports, next week.

 The government is determined to go ahead with the signing ceremony, which had been announced earlier, in spite of signs of discontent from airport employees, who went on a strike in February.

 The Anil Ambani-run Reliance Airports Developers has also moved court against what it called the ?arbitrary? evaluation of bids for airport modernisation.

 The Ambanis had quoted the highest bids for both the airports. Reliance had offered the highest revenue sharing percentage to the Airports Authority of India for Delhi. But GMR-Fraport, the second highest bidder, won the contract after it was allowed to match the highest bid on the ground that it was the lone technically qualified bidder. GMR matched Reliances offer of 45.99 per cent share.

 According to Reliance, GVK-South Africa Airport, the highest bidder for Mumbai, was given the contract although it was among the lowest ranked technically.

 The pact will be the ?mother document?, which will give GMR and GVK the right to undertake operations, maintenance, development, design, construction and management of the two airports and is likely to be signed on April 4.

 On January 31, a group of ministers on airports had decided to award the Delhi airport to the GMR-Fraport consortium and the Mumbai airport to GVK-South African Airport. 

 The AAI would form subsidiaries with some banks and financial institutions, mostly from the public sector, which would set up two joint venture companies with GMR and GVK to modernise and run the airports. The two operators will have the right to run the airports for 30 years.

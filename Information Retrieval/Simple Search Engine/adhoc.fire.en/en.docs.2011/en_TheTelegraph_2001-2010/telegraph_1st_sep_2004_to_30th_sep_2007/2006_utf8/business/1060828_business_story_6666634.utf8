 Tea firms likely to miss audit deadline

 SOHINI MOOKHERJEA

 BITTER BREW

 Calcutta, Aug. 27: As many as 15 of the 28 tea companies from the east that have been mandated to do a cost audit are yet to file the form 23(c) with the department of company affairs (DCA) for approval on the choice of auditor. 

 The last date to submit all cost audit reports is September 30. 

 The DCA has issued the directive to 38 companies in consultation with the Tea Board and the Institute of Cost and Works Accountants of India (ICWAI).

 It is very unlikely that even the ones who have filed form 23(c) along with the board of directors resolution for the cost auditor appointment, demand draft and an NOC from the cost auditor would be able to meet the September deadline, said Sanjiban Bandyopadhyaya, chairman, continuing education programme committee of ICWAI.

 The government order arrived in July giving limited time to the companies to do the audit for this fiscal as well as for the previous two years, he added.

 The cost audit order came at a time when the industry was being scanned by banks and financial institutions to ascertain the appropriate interest rate on the special purpose tea fund (SPTF). 

 Certain sections of the commercial banking sector feel tea is not an economically viable activity without subsidy.

 We received the order dated July 7 on July 31. It states a period of 45 days for the filing of form 23(c), almost half of which was already wasted. It is indeed a tall order to complete the audit by September 30. We have, therefore, decided to apply for extension, said Abhay Chawdhry, chief financial officer of Assam Company. 

 Others on the list include Eveready Industries, Duncan Industries, Gillanders Arbuthnot, Goodricke Group, Jay Shree Tea amp; Industries, Rossel Tea, Amgoorie India and Warren Tea.

 As far as Eveready is concerned, the plantations division was under the cost audit list for the last two years. However, we have written to the DCA informing them that the gardens are no longer under Eveready Industries India Ltd. They are under McLeod Russel India Ltd and we have asked for the extension. We have also sought permission for the appointment of more than one cost auditor considering the sheer number 50 gardens, said Kamal Baheti, director of McLeod Russel India.

 Bandyopadhyaya said the cost audit of the gardens is significant as it brings out the actual cost of operations and therefore the justification behind the cost of production and the ultimate price to consumers.

 Hero Honda softens stand

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 12: Hero Honda Motors will actively consider regularisation of services of contract employees at its factory.

 Negotiations are going on peacefully. We are hoping for an early resolution as the management is considering the demands of contract workers quite favourably. There will be a proper recruitment procedure to regularise services, Vikram Kasdekar, vice-president and plant head ? Gurgaon, told The Telegraph.

 He, however, refused to reveal the number of workers likely to be regularised. All I can assure is that we will follow an open and a transparent process, he said.

 At present, the manufacturing facility at Gurgaon has 2,000 contract workers and 1,650 employees working in two shifts, said Hero Honda officials. The plant has three production lines churning out both motorcycles and scooters.

 Company sources said the management is considering regularising workers who have been on contract for at least five years. The plant has been operational since 1997 and has no casual workers.

 While the salary of a contract employee is Rs 6,700, workers said permanent members earn up to Rs 30,000.

 Workers have also demanded inclusion of compensatory off-days, medical facilities, salary accounts in banks and ATM facilities.

 The company also said the three-day strike, which led to a loss of production, will not affect its long-term sales.

 Talks are going on with contractors and workers, with the full support of the administration, a statement said.

 The strike will not affect product availability at dealer showrooms, the company said. 

 There are sufficient stocks in the pipeline and at dealerships. Hero Honda hopes to make up for the loss, resolve the issue and start production at its Gurgaon plant. 

 According to Kasdekar, the Gurgaon plant has an estimated daily production capacity of 6,500 units. However, before the strike, the plant was rolling out 5,800 vehicles a day.

 HDFC gears up to paper Chubb cracks

 Mumbai, June 25: HDFC has started discussions on new business models with US-based Chubb Corporation to stop their alliance in the general insurance business from breaking down.

 Over the last few months, the two firms had serious differences over the way HDFC Chubb was operating. The Indian partner is trying to accommodate Chubb?s ?ultra-conservative? risk perceptions.

 ?There is a status quo right now. A final picture should emerge by the third week of July,? said Renu Sud Karnad, executive director of HDFC Ltd. ?The joint venture is trying to work on new business models that are agreeable to both sides. We are taking a re-look at the whole situation. We don?t want to be reckless, but can?t afford to be ultra-conservative either.?

 Sources said HDFC has been trying to convince Chubb to increase its exposure to commercial lines of business.

 Globally, Chubb has a robust portfolio in the commercial segment, but in India, the joint venture is heavily tilted towards retail. 

 At present, 85 per cent of HDFC Chubb?s business is in retail and 15 per cent in the commercial segment. The retail-commercial balance in the general insurance industry is 55 per cent and 45 per cent.

 The private non-life insurance company has seen a steady exodus of senior management since matters between the two partners came to a head. Analysts said HDFC was in a stronger negotiating position, although it might not want to ruffle Chubb?s feathers. But if it gets to the point where the two partners are unable to continue, HDFC might buy out Chubb?s 26 per cent stake and run the company on its own as in the case of Reliance General Insurance.

 A break-up will leave Chubb out in the cold since it will face trouble finding another partner. According to the current insurance regulations, a foreign player cannot hold more than 26 per cent in a joint venture.

 ?HDFC is a cash-rich company with a good brandname. Differences have been brewing between the two partners for over a year now and HDFC has started to feel that it is unable to crank up its market share,? said a market analyst.

 Calcutta, Aug. 1: Britannia is planning to beef up its product range and is planning to acquire companies in the ready-to-eat food and snacks business. 

 The company, which has picked up Caf Coffee Days 50 per cent stake in Bangalore-based Daily Breads for Rs 10 crore, is looking for the right acquisition opportunities, said Vinita Bali, the managing director and chief executive of Britannia.

 Earlier, speaking on the 87th annual general meeting of the company, chairman Nusli Wadia said, We will aggressively grow our topline so that we can maintain our profit figures in the highly competitive Rs 5,000-crore domestic biscuit market, where biscuit prices are falling while input costs are rising. 

 According to Wadia, Britannia plans to achieve a higher growth trajectory by increasing production capacity, introducing products and repackaging and getting into new areas of business, such as foods and snacks, either organically or through acquisitions in India. 

 The investment in Daily Breads will gradually be increased to 100 per cent from a little less than 50 per cent now, Bali said.

 While Daily Breads acquisition marks Britannias entry into speciality breads and freshly baked gourmet food business, the company has recently launched cup cakes and rusks to broadbase its own product portfolio. Daily Bread has eight outlets in Bangalore through which its sells 50 varieties of breads and its Deluka brand of icecreams. We will take these outlets to other cities across the country, Bali said.

 Meanwhile, the company has decided to spend between Rs 175 crore and Rs 200 crore on increasing production capacity by 40-45 per cent. Britannia has four manufacturing units in Delhi, Calcutta, Chennai and Uttaranchal. 

 The Uttaranchal plant has been set up at an investment of Rs 40 crore. This year we are expanding the production capacities of our manufacturing units in Asom and Calcutta, Bali said. 

 Britannia outsources 55-60 per cent of its biscuit manufacturing to vendors. We will also increase the number of our contract manufacturers in Asansol, Baddi, Kanpur, Nagpur and Pondicherry, Bali added.

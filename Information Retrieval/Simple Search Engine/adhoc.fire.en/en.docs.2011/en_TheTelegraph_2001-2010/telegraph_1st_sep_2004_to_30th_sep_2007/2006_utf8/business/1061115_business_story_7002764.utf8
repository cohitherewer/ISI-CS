 Tata Tea faces union heat

 SOHINI MOOKHERJEA

 Hard at work

 Calcutta, Nov. 14: Workers unions in Bengal have misgivings over Tata Teas plans to set up a new company for its North Indian Plantation Operations (Nipo).

 Four unions claimed that they have not been adequately informed on the new structure. Moreover, they fear loss of jobs and feel overvaluation of estates will result in higher share prices for workers.

 The 20 Tata gardens in Assam have two major unions the Asom Cha Karmachari Sangha and the Asom Cha Mazdoor Sangha and the four in Bengal have four unions. These are National Union of Plantation Workers, Cha Bagan Mazdoor Union, West Bengal Cha and Mazdoor Sabha and West Bengal Tea Gardens Employees Association.

 Our representative had gone to visit the south Indian operations but is yet to brief us. We are concerned about the workers job security and would, therefore, definitely ask for a written guarantee. We will discuss the course of action and meet the Tata Tea officials, said Gopal Pradhan, secretary of Dooars Cha Bagan Workers Union.

 The estates, which comprise four gardens in Dooars with an area of 2,094 hectares, produced 4.4 million kg and yielded a turnover of Rs 26 crore last fiscal.

 The total turnover from the north Indian operations last fiscal was Rs 224 crore, including the Assam gardens.

 The garden land in Bengal does not belong to any particular company but to the state government and is on a long-term lease. Therefore, a plan that works in the south might not be apt for Dooars. We need more information and details to judge for ourselves, said Ashu Sarkar, vice-president of Cha Bagan Mazdoor Union, which has around 70,000 garden workers from north Bengal as its members.

 The union also feels that the current estimate of all the gardens in Dooars would not be more than Rs 40 crore. Certain sections feel that the gardens have been overvalued. As a result, the workers would have to pay much more to get the shares of the company, which might prohibit mass participation.

 The company is yet to directly approach by us. We do not have the details of the proposal. However, if it is suitable and for the good of the workers, we have no problems in accepting it, said Kalyan Ray of West Bengal Cha Shramik Union. Tata Tea has already assured that none of the 31,800 workers would lose their livelihood.

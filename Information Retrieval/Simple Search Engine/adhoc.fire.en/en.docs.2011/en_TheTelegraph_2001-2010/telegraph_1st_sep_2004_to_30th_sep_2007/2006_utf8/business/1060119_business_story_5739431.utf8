The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Backroom boys put Wipro in front

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bangalore, Jan. 18: Buoyed by a robust growth in backoffice jobs (outsourcing business), Wipro beat analysts? forecasts during the third quarter of this fiscal to record a 27 per cent jump in net profit.

 The country?s third-largest software exporter has notched up a net profit of Rs 543.5 crore for the quarter ended December despite pay rises and fewer billing hours. Its earnings stood at Rs 426.8 crore in the year-ago period.

 The firm?s revenues increased 30 per cent to Rs 2,744 crore against Rs 2,110 crore last year.

 A strong European economy and a turnaround in its back-office unit helped Wipro, which expects its IT arm that earns three quarters of sales to grow 8 per cent from last year to $510 million in the March quarter. Profit margins are expected to hold steady.

 ?The global IT business has generated a revenue of $473 million, ahead of our guidance of $463 million. It includes $1.3 million attributable to acquisition completed during the quarter,?? said chairman Azim Premji.

 The Wipro scrip gained Rs 11.90 on the BSE today, closing at Rs 461.15 against yesterday?s Rs 449.25. 

 Giving a profit-guidance for the fourth quarter, Premji said, ?The results are indicative of the next phase in Wipro?s growth.? 

 ?The results are better than expected and the guidance is strong,? said Mahesh Vaze, analyst with brokerage BRICS. ?They have done better than Infosys and TCS.?

 New York-listed Wipro has reported Rs 530 crore ($120 million) in net profit under US accounting rules in the December quarter, up from Rs 427 crore a year ago. Consolidated revenue grew 33 per cent to Rs 277 crore.

 Volume growth, an increase in the work done at low-cost locations in the country, lower visa costs and a higher share of experienced workers helped offset the effects of fewer working days in the US holiday season and a 12 per cent average rise in Indian salaries from November, said Suresh Senapaty, chief financial officer.

 Premji said he looked for acquisitions to build new skills and enter new markets, seeking bargains among smaller firms forced into consolidation.

 Wipro is scouting for sub-$100 million companies to expand its footprint and add to its domain knowledge and skill-sets.

 ?We would make larger acquisitions, but not significantly larger ones. We are looking at increasing our footprint in Europe,? said Premji, the country?s wealthiest man with his 83 per cent stake in the $15-billion company.

 Wipro is eyeing big deals in 2006, including a big chunk from General Motors.

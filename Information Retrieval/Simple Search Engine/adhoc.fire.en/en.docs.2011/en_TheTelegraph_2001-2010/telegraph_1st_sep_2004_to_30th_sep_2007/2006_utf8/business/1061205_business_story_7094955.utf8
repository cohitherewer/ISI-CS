The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 USO fund for mobile players

 New Delhi, Dec. 4 (PTI): The government has promulgated an ordinance to provide funds from Universal Service Obligations (USO) fund to mobile companies for entering rural areas, pending the Parliaments nod to Indian Telegraph (amendment) bill, 2006.

 The Indian Telegraph (amendment) Ordinance, 2006 has been promulgated on October 30. The ordinance is likely to be replaced by an act by moving an amendment to Indian Telegraph Amendment bill, which is pending in Lok Sabha, according to an internal note from the department of telecom (DoT).

 The ordinance comes after DoT rejected the suggestions of the standing committee of IT and regulator Trai that such assistance to mobile operators could be provided without amending the act.

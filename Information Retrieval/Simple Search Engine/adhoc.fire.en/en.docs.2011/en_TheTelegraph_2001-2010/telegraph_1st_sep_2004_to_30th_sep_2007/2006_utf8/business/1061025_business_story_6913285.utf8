 ICICI Bank puts up stellar show

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Oct. 24: Boosted by a strong showing both in its core operations and other income, ICICI Bank the countrys second largest bank today reported a second-quarter net profit of Rs 755 crore, which was way ahead of analyst estimates.

 While the 30 per cent growth in net profit beat expectations of Rs 695 crore projected by the street, ICICI Banks performance was packed with other surprises as well. In a quarter that saw banks rising lending rates, the private sector bank continued to see robust demand for credit, particularly from retail customers.

 The retail assets of ICICI Bank jumped a whopping 57 per cent to Rs 107,679 crore at September 30 from Rs 68,537 crore at September 30, 2005. On the other hand, the share of low cost current and savings account deposits also grew. 

 Deposits for ICICI Bank also increased 57 per cent to Rs 189,499 crore from Rs 120,452 crore last year.

 This was reflected in the banks net interest income (NII) or its core revenue that jumped 47 per cent to Rs 1,577 crore during the quarter from Rs 1,070 crore in the same period last year. This figure was also ahead of analyst estimate of Rs 1,440 crore by a huge margin. 

 ICICI Bank was then aided by the other income or non-interest income which also grew at a healthy rate.

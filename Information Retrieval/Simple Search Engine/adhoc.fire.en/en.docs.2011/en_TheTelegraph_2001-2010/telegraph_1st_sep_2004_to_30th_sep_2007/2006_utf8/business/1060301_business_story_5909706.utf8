 Budget boost for varsity research

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Feb. 28: A bonanza that rolled out in Parliament for Calcutta University this afternoon sent ripples of excitement through College Street here, where several campuses and offices of the university are located. 

 The grant of Rs 100 crore could not have been better timed for the cash-strapped Calcutta University in its 150th anniversary year.

 As an add-on effect of the grant, the university has decided to throw open its faculty door to deserving candidates from across the country.

 The allocation is for research. The money will be used for subjects that were not getting the attention they deserve because of a funds crunch, said university pro vice-chancellor Suranjan Das. 

 The funds will boost research in emerging areas and social and pure sciences, he added.

 The subjects that will benefit are biotechnology, nanotechnology, genetic engineering, environmental science, history, international relations, sociology, economics, pure mathematics, physics, chemistry and biology.

 Moments after Union finance minister P. Chidambaram wound up his budget speech, senior officials of the university went into a huddle to prepare a blueprint.

 As a first step, the university decided to depart from the policy of recruiting teachers only from Bengal. 

 We must have the best brains from across the country if we want to pursue advanced research, Das asserted. 

 The existing recruitment policy makes it mandatory for the authorities to seek the governments consent if they want to recruit a teacher from outside the state. 

 The new policy, to be finalised soon, will enable the university to hire teachers on short term from top-notch institutions like Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR).

 A considerable portion of the funds will be kept aside for running the teaching posts independently, Das added. 

 To attract scholars from other states and abroad, the university will set up modern laboratories and hostels.

 According to registrar Samir Bandyopadhyay, never before had Calcutta University figured in such a prominent way in the Union budget.

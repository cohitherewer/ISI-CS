 Survival: At Rs 9 a day

 Still in the dark

 New Delhi, Dec. 27: A poor villager spent Rs 9 a day on consumption needs in 2004-05 despite the country clocking a growth rate of 7.5 per cent. The urban poor were slightly better off with the ability to spend Rs 13 a day.

 According to the figures released today by the National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO), a villager on an average spent up to Rs 559 on items of consumption in a month in 2004-05 and the urban counterpart spent up to Rs 1,052 (at 2004-05 prices).

 Both in rural and urban India, per capita consumption of cereals fell over a decade.

 The survey also revealed that rural areas of Bengal and Assam were worse off in terms of increased levels of income over the years compared with Haryana and Punjab.

 So, in rural areas of Haryana and Punjab, cereals formed only 9 per cent of the total household consumption budget, while Bengal and Assam contributed 23 per cent or more.

 In urban areas of Punjab and Haryana, cereals comprised 7 per cent of the household consumption budget. This was 17 per cent for urban areas of Bihar and Orissa.

 Quantity of cereals consumed per person per month has declined between 1993-94 and 2004-05, that is, in the decade preceding the survey, from 13.4 kg to 12.1 kg in rural India and from 10.6 kg to 9.9 kg in urban areas.

 In both rural and urban India, fuel and light comprised 10 per cent of total consumer expenditure while clothing, bedding and footwear accounted for 5 per cent.

 Medical expenses formed 7 per cent of total consumer expenditure in rural India and 5 per cent in urban areas.

 Educational expenses formed 3 per cent of total consumer expenditure in villages and 5 per cent in urban India.

 The NSSO survey said 5 per cent of rural population belonged to households with monthly per capita consumer expenditure (MPCE) in the range of Rs 0-235 in 2004-05. This means they spent less than Rs 8 per day per person.

 Another 5 per cent of the rural population belonged to households with monthly per capita expenditure in the range of Rs 235-270, spending about Rs 8-9 per person per day. About 5 per cent of rural population had MPCE of Rs 1,115 or more, while 5 per cent had between Rs 890 and Rs 1,155.

 The poorest 5 per cent of urban population belonged to households with monthly consumer expenditure per person in the range of Rs 0-335, spending less than Rs 11 per day.

 Another 5 per cent of the urban population belonged to households with monthly per capita expenditure in the range Rs 335-395, that is, spending about Rs 11-13 per person per day on consumption.

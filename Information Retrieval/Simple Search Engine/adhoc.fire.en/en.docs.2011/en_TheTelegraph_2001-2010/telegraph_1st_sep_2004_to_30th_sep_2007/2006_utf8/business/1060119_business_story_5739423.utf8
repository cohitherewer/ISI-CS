 Growth-hungry Singh pledges policy push

 New Delhi, Jan. 18: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today said the country must now move on to an 8 per cent growth era and for this it needs policy reforms on a number of fronts.

 ?I sincerely believe this is possible,? he added. 

 ?Each time the economy moved to a new trajectory of growth, it was because of a number of creative policy initiatives,? Singh said at the golden jubilee function of the Delhi School of Economics.

 He emphasised the need for new investments to increase productivity and output in agriculture and industry. 

 ?We need to create a pattern of growth, which creates large enough job opportunities to absorb all the new entrants to our labour force,? he said.

 Singh said we need more focused attention on social equity, education, health environmental issues and regional imbalances in the level of development. ?In all these areas we cannot be satisfied with the status quo or with the tenets of traditional wisdom,? he added.

 Expressing satisfaction over the fact that the economy had responded ?handsomely? to the difficult decision he had taken in 1990s, Singh said, ?Today we can say with pride that there is no external constraint on India?s economic growth.? He said the country had come a long way since 15 years ago when ?an external payments crisis had pulled the economy into a serious crisis?.

 ?Prudent economic management mixed with some well-advised risk taking helped. We maintained the growth momentum of the 1980s, but with a healthier macro-economic situation,? he added.

 Singh said, ?I am convinced we are at the threshold of a new era of higher growth. However, to realise this potential we must take determined measures in several areas.?

 Singh said the government was committed to paying attention to issues of social equity for promoting ?development with a human face.?

 Recalling his days as finance minister in the early 1990s, Singh said there was criticism of the ?difficult, if momentous, decisions? he took and admitted that problems of social equity, particularly in education and health, should have been given more focused attention.

 ?However, given the magnitude of macro-economic imbalances we had to contend with, our options in the short term were limited,? he added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Higher tea auction price costs Kenya dear

 SOHINI MOOKHERJEA

 Bitter brew

 Calcutta, Oct. 6: Kenya is feeling the heat in the international tea market as rivals India, China and Sri Lanka ramp up exports, while higher prices at the auctions in capital Mombasa ward off buyers.

 An instance of this trend, prevalent over the last two months, is of Pakistan preferring varieties from India to Kenya, which has been displaced by Egypt to second rank among exporting countries to Pakistan.

 Concern over the falling market share in Pakistan was even voiced by the managing director of the Tea Board of Kenya, Sicily Kariuki.

 An exporter from Pakistan said demand for north Indian varieties would rise significantly this year, adding that the dip in imports from Kenya in the past two months might be temporary. Kenyas intrinsic advantage in packaging and availability of tea will help it bounce back as the crops improve, Fahim Khan, manager (tea division), Tapal Tea, said. Tapal is one of the largest organised tea buyers in Pakistan. Khan said he had information on attempts by the Kenyan tea board to redress the situation.

 Kenya is also facing stiff competition from Vietnam, Argentina and Malawi who are new to the international market.

 Prices are expected to increase across global auction centres, as buyers stock up for the winter. With a production of 3.2 billion kg last year, Kenya is the fourth largest producer in the world after India, China and Sri Lanka. Earlier, the commerce ministry had said Kenya was one of the countries which was eating into Indias market share through competitive pricing and other innovations. The ministry had named Pakistan, Iran and Egypt as the focus markets for the year.

 In August, exports from Kenya fell by 13 per cent to 3 million kg, while production increased by 6.5 per cent to 23.2 million kg on a year-on-year basis, according to the Tea Board of Kenya.

 Volume exports from India in July rose 26.89 per cent on a year-on-year basis to 19.11 million kg, while in terms of value it was up 10.02 per cent to Rs 165.62 crore.

 New land policy in Jharkhand 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 12: The Jharkhand government is trying to evolve a rehabilitation and resettlement policy to tackle tribal unrest and problems on land allotment.

 Chief minister Arjun Munda said his government would improve upon the national policy, which according to him, entailed acquisition through a coercive law. The national policy in this regard is not an acceptable proposition to the people of Jharkhand, Munda said on the sidelines of a CII meet here.

 With investors giving proposals and MoUs being signed every other day, reclaiming forest land, which comprises one third of Jharkhand, for industry is another sensitive issue facing the state. Clearances for using forest land, which comes from the central government, is time consuming and delay the process. Therefore, changes were required to make land available to investors at the earliest.

 Moodys revises SBI, ICICI Bank ratings

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, May 29: Moodys Investors Service has revised the ratings on ICICI Bank and State Bank of India following a change in its rating methodology for assigning foreign currency bond ceilings. 

 Ratings on both these banks have been revised to Baa2 from Baa3, though the outlook on ICICI Bank was revised to stable from positive.

 In November last year, the international rating agency had sought market responses on Revised Policy With Respect to Country Ceilings. Moodys said based on the responses, it decided to revise its methodology for assigning foreign currency bond ceilings.

 The revised methodology resulted in upgrades to the foreign currency bond ceilings of a number of countries, Moodys said.

 Most of the foreign currency debt and foreign currency issuer ratings that are now being upgraded were previously constrained at the old foreign currency debt ceilings, it added. 

 The stable to positive rating outlook for Indias banking system reflects the countrys robust credit growth against a favourable economic environment, as well as improvement in the banks overall financial metrics, Moodys Investors Service said in its new Banking System Outlook on India. 

 The report also takes into consideration the constant need for upgradation in technology and human resources. 

 In a separate report, Moodys said a robust macroeconomic environment in India continued to underpin the financial performance of the banks, which are faced with a broad-based credit demand, with the industrial sector having picked up and the corporate sector showing increased credit appetite, together with a robust growth in retail loans and mortgages.

 The rating agency emphasised the need for constant technological transformation, which is a challenge for public sector banks. They also face the challenges of inflexible and inefficient labour force that hampers their competitiveness, it added.

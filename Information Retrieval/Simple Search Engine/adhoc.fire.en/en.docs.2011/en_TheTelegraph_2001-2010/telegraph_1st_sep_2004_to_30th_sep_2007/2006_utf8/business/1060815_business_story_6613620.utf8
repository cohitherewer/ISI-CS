 Net banking takes backseat, branches back in favour

 London, 

 Aug. 14 (Reuters): The face of banking will undergo 

 cosmetic surgery in the next year as HSBC rolls out megastores, 

 HBOS and Abbey plan their biggest expansions for decades 

 and Woolwich branches disappear. 

 Branches are back in vogue as banks recognise that online services cannot replace face-to-face transactions and more space in the premises can be devoted to selling new products as back offices have moved to other locations. 

 Not all branches are in the right places or the right size or have the right things, but the banks are definitely in love with branches because the public are still in love with branches, said Nick Sandall, head of retail banking at advisory firm Deloitte. 

 It is a stark change from five years ago, when branches were out of favour and Internet and telephone banking were tipped to displace them. 

 Theres been a mindset change, said Mark Weill at Mercer Oliver Wyman, the financial services consultancy. If you go back to the height of the dot-com frenzy then its a big change. At that point banks saw their branch as a dead weight that was a costly legacy and they were really running their branches down.

 Now, he said branches are back at the heart of the customer offer, supplemented by Internet and telephone services, and banks are investing in them again. 

 Plans to expand the branch footprint mirror a trend seen in the United States in the last three years following years of shrinkage. 

 At the same time, banks are trying to gain an edge with new, concept branches with a sharper image. 

 Perhaps most dramatic will be HSBCs plan to open five megastores, which likens to computer and music firm Apples flagship stores. 

 HSBCs megastores will be about 35,000 square feet and include a coffee area, Internet access and meeting rooms.

 A more typical branch of the future is also likely to be open-plan and brighter, with music, Internet terminals, designated areas for small-business banking and more room to discuss personal products in private. Banks are also distancing themselves from a stuffy past such as Barclays move to rename its cash machines as a Hole in the Wall. 

 They are already following retailers to out-of-town retail parks, and that trend could accelerate, while opening hours are getting local flexibility, with branches near busy train stations opening early to suit commuters, for example. 

 The look, the location and opening hours will change in time, it wont happen instantaneously. Its expensive and banks have to decide what sort of investment they make, Sandall said. 

 Theres not much growth in products or the overall market size, so theyve got to eat each others cake. So theyve got to prove that theyre better than their peers to their customers, so do what the customer wants, he added.

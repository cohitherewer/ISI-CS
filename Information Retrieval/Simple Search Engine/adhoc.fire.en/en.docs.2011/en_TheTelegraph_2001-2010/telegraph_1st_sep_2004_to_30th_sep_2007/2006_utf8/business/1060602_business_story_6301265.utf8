 Power play

 Mumbai, June 1: Tata Power has teamed up with Germany?s Siemens Power Generation and Korea?s Doosan Heavy Industries amp; Construction Company to bid for ultra mega projects in the country.

 The Tata group firm had submitted expressions of interest for four such projects, one each in Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Karnataka. It has been asked to submit the plan for two projects ? Sasan in Madhya Pradesh and Mundra in Gujarat. 

 According to the Union government?s policy announcement, several ultra mega power projects will be set up through an international competitive bidding process.

 Siemens and Doosan are engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) partners to Tata Power for these projects. The duo will provide the design and knowhow for construction of power plants based on critical technology, which will form the basis of Tata Power?s bids for the projects.

 Tata Power director Adi Engineer said the agreement was a significant step towards the company?s plans to bid for ultra mega projects by drawing on the expertise of strong international partners like Siemens and Doosan. ?The formation of this EPC consortium will help in facilitating an excellent technical solution which is also cost competitive,? he added.

 Siemens managing director J. Schubert said as a major player in power generation, with a long-standing presence in India, the company has an advantage of combining its global expertise with local strength. 

 For Doosan Heavy Industries, it is another challenging exposure. The company would bring the benefits of its global experience to the country?s power projects, said S.E. Hong, head of power plant business group, Doosan Heavy Industries.

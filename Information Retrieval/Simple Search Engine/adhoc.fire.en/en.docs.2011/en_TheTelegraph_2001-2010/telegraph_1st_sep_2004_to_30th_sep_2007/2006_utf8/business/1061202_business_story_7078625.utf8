 Kerkorian cuts GM stake 

 Detroit, Dec. 1 (Reuters): Billionaire investor Kirk Kerkorians investment firm said on Thursday it had cut its stake in General Motors Corp by half with a second large sale, prompting speculation about whether the activist investor had moved to sell his entire stake in the automaker. 

 In a regulatory filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Tracinda Corp said it had agreed to sell 14 million shares in a private transaction for $28.75 a share, cutting Kerkorians stake in the automaker to 4.95 per cent half of what he had owned earlier this year. 

 The Wall Street Journal, quoting an unnamed source, reported in its online edition that Tracinda subsequently sold its remaining 28 million GM shares on Thursday. 

 That development, which could not be immediately confirmed, would have ended Kerkorians largely contentious 19-month involvement with the worlds largest automaker. 

 A spokeswoman for Tracinda Corp declined to comment. 

 Kerkorian had agitated for an accelerated turnaround at GM and some analysts had expected him to mount a proxy fight for control of GM rather than cash out of his stake with the modest profit implied by his disclosed and reported stock sales. 

 Clearly, he wasnt happy with the outcome of the Nissan-Renault talks and has expressed frustration with the trajectory of the turnaround, Morningstar analyst John Novak said. 

 Kerkorians disclosed sale on Thursday came just a week after he sold a block of 14 million GM shares for $33 a share, cutting his stake from 9.9 per cent to 7.4 per cent of GM. 

 Kerkorians associate Jerry York resigned from GMs board in October in a dispute over board oversight and strategy triggered by the automakers decision not to pursue an alliance with Renault-Nissan he had attempted to broker on Kerkorians behalf. 

 Yorks resignation from GMs board and his public criticism of the oversight it provided led many analysts to believe that Kerkorian could be gearing up for a proxy fight.

 Market tanks on selloff flip-flop

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, July 6: The divestment policy of the government is in tatters ? and theres a palpable sense of d?j? vu in the stock markets.

 Market watchers say until there is some concrete implementation of the policy, the market wont be swayed by the confusing political talk over what is clearly a hugely contentious issue.

 The market did not react to the divestment policy announced last week. Similarly, the roll back of the policy failed to spark any reaction in the markets today, said Manish Sonthalia, vice-president (equity strategy), Motilal Oswal Securities.

 The 30-share BSE sensex today lost 151.67 points, or 1.3 per cent, to settle at 10,767.97.

 Its facile to attribute the 152-point fall in the sensex to the sudden turnabout by the Manmohan Singh government on the decision to sell its stake in Neyveli Lignite and National Aluminium Company (Nalco) after the DMKs threat to withdraw from the UPA government.

 In a yo-yoing market, analysts reach for the most plausible explanation for the sudden rise or fall in stock values.

 The markets were languishing at the lower level throughout the day due to lack of buying interest in scrips, analysts said. The rebound from the lower level came in the later part of trading just when the government decided to put on hold divestment in state-run firms.

 Though the market reacted positively to the news at first and recovered from a lower level after having tanked as much as 200 points, it stemmed from the macro perspective of being reassured of a stable political situation. Both Neyveli Lignite and Nalco remained mostly unaffected when the policy was announced and remained almost neutral even today, said Sonthalia.

 Neyveli Lignite, in which the government had decided to divest 10 per cent, ended flat today at Rs 61.10 amidst a volume of 10.06 lakh on the BSE.

 Nalco, in which the government had recently decided to divest its 10 per cent stake, shed 0.43 per cent and ended the day at Rs 220.90.

 However, the pullback in the later period signifies that it will have a negative impact on the market in the longer run, said V.K. Sharma of Anagram Stockbroking. 

 The markets will now take cues from the corporate results and the first quarter of fiscal 2007 is expected to be another quarter of strong growth, said Sharma.

 The sensex had surged 1990.20 points, or 22 per cent, in a short while, to 10,919.64 on July 5 from a low of 8,929.44 on June 14.

 Although the market breadth today was weak, select side-counters edged higher. BSE clocked a turnover of Rs 2,691 crore compared with Wednesdays Rs 2,775 crore.

 The FIIs have been buyers since the past four days. Their net buy was Rs 556 crore on July 5, the day when the sensex jumped 257 points. The net inflow of FIIs in four trading sessions between June 30 and July 5 aggregated Rs 1,131.80 crore.

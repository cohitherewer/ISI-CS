 Ethic rule for tea stirs 

debate

 Moral issues

 Calcutta, April 16: The industry is divided on the issue of Ethical Tea Partnership (ETP) membership, which is required to make inroads into the United Kingdom.

 A group of packaging companies started the ETP in 1997 in the UK to ensure that the tea that comes to the country is from plantations that fulfill certain social responsibilities towards their employees.

 These include education, health and safety, housing and maternity benefits for employees and child labour monitoring. The freedom to form associations and bargain collectively is also acknowledged.

 The ETP membership entails complex monitoring of gardens, which is done by PricewaterhouseCoopers.

 The exercise involves a questionnaire as well as personal visits from the agents followed by a grading process, which is often too complex for smaller estates. Moreover, many industry experts feel that gardens may not be comfortable revealing their details to a foreign organisation.

 According to estate owners, information regarding the retail chain revenue distribution abroad should also be made available in exchange of garden details. A section sees ETP membership, which is a market access issue in developed countries like the UK, as a barrier to trade.

 Though the UK is an important market and a huge hub for re-exports, but increasingly, a lot of the best Darjeeling is also going to Germany, said Basudeb Banerjee, chairman of Tea Board.

 The production cost of Indian tea at around $1.60 to $1.70 per kg is one of the highest in the world. This is mainly because of social expenses. In contrast, Kenya spends $1 and Bangladesh 80 to 90 cents to produce a kg of tea. This aspect of Indian tea has been highlighted of late to promote the commodity globally, said William Gorman, executive chairman of the UK Tea Council.The ETP has 18 member companies that includes Tetley and Williamson Magor.

 India still needs time to become a part of this process and it has to be a gradual shift, said Percy Siganporia, managing director of Tata Tea Ltd.

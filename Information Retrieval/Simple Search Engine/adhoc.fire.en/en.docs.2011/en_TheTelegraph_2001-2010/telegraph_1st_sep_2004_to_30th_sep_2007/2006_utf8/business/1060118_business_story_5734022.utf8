 China plans new bourse in Shanghai

 Beijing, Jan. 17 (PTI): China plans to set up a new exchange in Shanghai, the communist giants commercial hub, to resume trade financial futures as part of a bold finance reforms effort.

 A senior securities regulator has disclosed that state council (Chinas cabinet) has given the nod to establish a financial exchange in Shanghai, industry insiders quoted the vice-chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, Fan Fuchun, as saying at a national conference on securities and futures regulation held last week.

 Fan did not elaborate on the details such as the time when the exchange would be opened, the China Daily reported. Analysts say the new exchange will not be established until the end of this year or early next year.

 The governments approval to set up such an exchange indicates it has recognised the burning need from the market, director of China Centre for Finance Research at Peking university Hu Jian said. As the financial market develops, market players demand for risk-hedging tools also grows. Thats exactly what the new bourse could offer, Hu said. Its a milestone in Chinas finance reform and a boost to Shanghais ambition to become a world financial hub. 

 But analysts also warn that the trading of derivatives could turn out to be a problem.

 Trading of financial derivatives is also associated with high risks, so how it will function well largely depends on how it is regulated and how market players internal risk control system are, Xue Jirui, a financial derivatives analyst with Citic Securities, said.

 Financial derivatives were once traded in China in early 1990s but were then plagued by wild market speculation. A scandal involving state treasury bond futures in 1995 prompted the government to ban derivatives trading.

 The decision to set up a separate exchange to trade financial futures is seen by some as a move that will hold back the development of the current three commodity exchanges in the country.

 Setting up a new exchange to trade the financial futures, rather than allowing the existing exchanges to trade the financial futures, is a waste of resources, said a senior manager at the research and development section of the Zhenzhou commodity exchange.

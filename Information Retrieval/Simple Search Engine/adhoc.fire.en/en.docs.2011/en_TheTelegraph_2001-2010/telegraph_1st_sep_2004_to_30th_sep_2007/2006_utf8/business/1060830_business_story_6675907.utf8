 Bengal seventh on FDI totem pole

 S.P.S. PANNU 

 New Delhi, Aug. 29: Bengal has attracted an FDI of Rs 1,095 crore in the last three years, placing it seventh in the pecking order among all states.

 Delhi and the satellite townships of Gurgaon and Noida received the highest foreign direct investment (FDI) of Rs 12,470 crore in the country between 2003-04 and 2005-06. Ahead of Bengal are Maharashtra, three states from the south and Gujarat, which slipped to the sixth place.

 At the bottom of the heap are Bihar, Manipur and Meghalaya in the east and the Northeast which have drawn a blank.

 Assam also attracted no FDI investment in 2005-06 compared with Rs 19.94 crore in 2003-04 and Rs 13.39 crore in 2004-05.

 While some marquee FDI is expected in the mineral-rich Jharkhand and Orissa in the coming years, during the period under review, Jharkhand turned in a dismal show though the tempo was upbeat in Orissa. 

 Orissa, which is awaiting big-ticket investments by Posco of South Korea and Lakshmi Mittal, failed to attract funds in the first two years under review but accumulated a neat pile of Rs 351 crore in 2005-06.

 Jharkhand has yet to open its account, but expects to attract big investments soon with the Mittals planning to set up another steel plant.

 The national capital region is flush with FDI, having raked in Rs 2,064 crore in the first two months of this fiscal, which is nearly half of the inflows of Rs 4,565 crore last year.

 Maharashtra is second at Rs 9,130 crore and Karnataka third. Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh have shoved Gujarat to take fourth and fifth spots, respectively.

 Since the RBI data, made available to the commerce ministry, is based on equity inflows, it is an apt indicator of the productive investment.

 All-India FDI is Rs 59,283 crore for the period under review and Rs 5,416 crore in the first two months of the current fiscal. 

 Telecom was the sector that attracted the biggest investment valued at Rs 5,528 crore. It was followed by transportation at Rs 3,533 crore; chemicals (other than fertiliser) at Rs 3,063 crore; drugs and pharmaceuticals (Rs 2,614 crore); and cement and gypsum (Rs 2,016 crore).

 FDI in services amounted to more than Rs 6,995 crore with as much as Rs 1,089 crore in the first two months of the current fiscal. Consultancy accounted for Rs 1,644 crore.

 Catch in free credit cards

 GOT a call from a credit card issuer recently offering you a card with ?no annual fee?? It is most likely that you won?t get a free personal accident cover with the card. To attract more customers, most credit card issuers have now waived the annual and joining fees on their credit card programme. However, at the same time, they have also silently withdrawn the personal accident cover that they have been offering free with their credit cards. 

 Credit card issuers were, till recently, offering free personal accident cover in association with one or the other general insurance companies in the country. They used to buy group insurance products from non-life insurers at a cheap rate and provide a personal accident cover between Rs 1 lakh and Rs 3 lakh depending on the category of the card ? general or premium. The level of insurance cover would also vary from one card issuer to another.

 Some of them have already stopped and some are planning to stop offering this free personal accident cover on the cards that come with ?no annual fee?.

 Except for incidents such as an act of terrorism or a natural calamity, this insurance cover would have come handy for cardholders. But so far there had been few claims on the insurance companies, which reveals that not many cardholders used this benefit. 

 Some card issuers are now packaging insurance benefits in their credit card programmes, but to avail of these benefits the cardholders will have to pay a premium. However, the premium cost comes at a 25-30 per cent discount than the insurer would have otherwise charged. 

 These insurance benefits include many things, from medical to household. However, there are joining fees to these card programmes and there are small premium charges for these insurance benefits.

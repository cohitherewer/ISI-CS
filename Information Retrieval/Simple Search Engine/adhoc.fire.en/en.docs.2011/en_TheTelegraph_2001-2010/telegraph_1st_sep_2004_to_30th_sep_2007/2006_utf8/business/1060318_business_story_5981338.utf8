The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 LOreal buys The Body Shop 

 AMIT ROY

 New beginning

 London, March 17: LOreal of France, the cosmetics firm whose present and past faces include Aishwarya Rai and Diana Hayden, will take over The Body Shop, the ethical British business set up 30 years ago by Anita Roddick.

 The cost of the deal will be ?652 million in cash, from which Dame Anita, as she is now called, and her husband, Gordon, who own 18 per cent of The Body Shop, stand to make ?117.4 million.

 Back in 1976, the Roddicks borrowed ?3,000 from their friend Iain McGlinn to set up a small shop in Brighton to support their daughters, Justine and Samantha. There are now 2,085 branches in 54 countries, including 304 in the UK.

 McGlinn, who now owns over a fifth of the business, will make about ?140 million from the sale, which was today recommended by the board of The Body Shop.

 Despite comforting words from LOreal that The Body Shops ethical principles would be respected and it would be maintained worldwide as a standalone business, many of Roddicks former supporters will see her decision as a sell out. 

 She became possibly the most high profile businesswoman in Britain by opposing animal testing and acquiring her natural ingredients from sources in Africa and other Third World countries. 

 However, in recent years, The Body Shop has not been the force it once was, faced with competition from rivals, which successfully copied its formula.

 Now that this is an instance of a French company swallowing up a British one, no objections have been voiced by President Jacques Chirac or other politicians in France.

 Some commentators would say this exposes the hypocrisy of the French who are opposing Mittal Steels bid for Arcelor, allegedly on nationalistic grounds. The view of the British government is takeovers should be left to market forces where European companies are concerned. 

 In Britain, there is the sense that Roddicks agreement to give the takeover her blessings marks the end of an era. Although she is no longer involved in the day-to-day management of The Body Shop, she remained a consultant and will continue to serve in this position under LOreal. 

 I dont see it as selling out, Roddick said. For both Gordon and I, this is without doubt the best 30th anniversary gift The Body Shop could have received.

 She went on: LOreal has displayed visionary leadership in wanting to be an authentic advocate and supporter of our values. It understands what a maverick The Body Shop was in the business world and how we helped change the language of business, incorporating the action of social change, especially in human rights, animal welfare, the environment and community trade. 

 LOreal chief executive Lindsay Owen-Jones said: We have always had great respect for The Body Shops success and for its strong identity and values created by its outstanding founder, Dame Anita Roddick. A partnership between our companies makes perfect sense.

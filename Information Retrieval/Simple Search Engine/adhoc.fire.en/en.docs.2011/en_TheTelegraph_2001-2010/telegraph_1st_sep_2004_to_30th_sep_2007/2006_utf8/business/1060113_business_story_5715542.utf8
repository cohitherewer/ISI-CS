 New Delhi, Jan. 12: Audi, a Volkswagen group company, today rolled out two sedans in the A4 series and said it would launch the Q7, its sports utility vehicle, in India later this year.

 ?The A4 will be first available in Delhi and Bangalore and then in other metros. The Q7 will hit Indian roads in the last quarter this year,? said general manager Stefan Hamberger.

 In the A4 series, the 1.8 T four cylinder petrol turbo engine is priced at Rs 24,74,000 while the 2.0 TDI diesel engine will be available for Rs 26,59,000.

 The company plans to sell a total of 150 units of the A4 series in India this year. 

 At present, the German auto giant sells the A8 and the A6 series and the TT Coupe in the Indian market.

 In India, Audi sells three variants of the A8 luxury sedans. This includes the 4.2I LWB priced approximately at Rs 65,32,841, the W12L for Rs 90,94,751 and the 3.01 TDI for Rs 59,32,973. 

 Hamberger said the Q7, the seven-seater SUV, will be ready for global launch next month.

 ?The pricing will be in the range of BMW and Mercedes,? said Hamberger. The Q7 is priced at about 50,000 Euros in Germany.

 The Q7 is available in two engine variants ? a 4.2 litre direct injection petrol (FSI) V8 and a 3.0-litre common rail diesel that uses the latest-generation peizo injectors. 

 Built on a long wheel base, the Q7 is billed as one of the most spacious SUVs.

 New Delhi, Oct. 16: Foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows have risen by more than 20 per cent to $6.59 billion in 2005. However, this formed only a small fraction of the total global foreign investments of $916 billion, according to a UN report released today. 

 World Investment Report 2006 of the United Nations Centre for Trade and Development (Unctad) also shows that these FDI inflows formed a mere 3.5 per cent of the total gross fixed capital formation in the country during 2005, which is more or less the same as 3.4 per cent in 2003 but a little higher than the 3.1 per cent during 2004. 

 The report said FDI inflows to India during 2005 was $6.598 billion compared with $5.474 billion in 2004. Outward flows by Indian firms declined 32 per cent to $1.364 billion from $2.024 billion in 2004.

 Although FDI inflows have risen, they lag way behind China, which received $72.406 billion in 2005. China was the largest recipient of FDI among all developing countries worldwide. At a global level, FDI inflows have increased for the second consecutive year. Investments went up by 29 per cent to $916 billion in 2005, the report said.

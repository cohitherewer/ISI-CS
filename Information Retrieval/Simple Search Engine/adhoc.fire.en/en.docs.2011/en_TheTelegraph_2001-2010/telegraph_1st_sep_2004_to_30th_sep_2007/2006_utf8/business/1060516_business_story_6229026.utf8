 Chidambaram, Singh amp; Deora: Looking for a solution

 New Delhi, May 15: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, petroleum minister Murli Deora and finance minister P. Chidambaram did some number crunching today to moderate the increase in petrol and diesel prices and spare cooking fuels from the hike.

 A matrix of duty cuts, budgetary support and oil bonds is under study to protect the oil companies from going bankrupt while minimising the burden on the consumer. 

 In 2005-06, the government had passed on 12 per cent of the increase in international prices to consumers. One of the options this time is to raise prices such that the percentage increase is the same as last year.

 Sources said the government may settle for a modest rise in the price of petrol and diesel in the range of Rs 2.50 to Rs 3 and avoid the axe on LPG and kerosene prices.

 Chidambaram reportedly is adamant on his revenue-centric stand of not scaling down duties beyond a point. 

 Upstream oil major ONGC, OIL and GAIL, which contributed Rs 14,000 crore during the last financial year towards subsidy on LPG and kerosene, are expected to cough up as much as Rs 24,000 crore in this year. 

 Deora made out a case for a larger budgetary allocation for the subsidy with contributions from the oil cess pool. The collections from cess on domestic crude with the Oil Industry Development Board is Rs 49,300 crore. 

 The cess was Rs 5,000 crore in 2005-06 and is expected to be around Rs 7,500 crore in 2006-07. Deora wants the cess proceeds to finance the subsidy on LPG and kerosene. 

 Sources said at the meeting with the Prime Minister and finance minister, Deora said Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum stand to lose Rs 73,512 crore this fiscal if there was no revision of prices. 

 Since the last revision in September, global crude prices have increased $20 per barrel, and public sector oil companies say their under-recoveries on petrol and diesel have been Rs 9.33 a litre and Rs 10.43 per litre respectively. 

 The losses on kerosene and LPG are Rs 17.16 a litre and Rs 114.45 per cylinder respectively. 

 In addition Indian Oil, HPCL and BPCL would be asked to rework refinery gate prices and contribute Rs 6,500 crore. 

 The government steered clear of raising petroleum product prices fearing adverse voter impact at the Assembly elections in the states. Now that the elections are over the price fixing exercise has resumed and consultations have also been held with the Left Parties which are opposed to a hike.

 However, the government expects them to come to terms with the realities of the oil sector and veer around to a more conciliatory stand.

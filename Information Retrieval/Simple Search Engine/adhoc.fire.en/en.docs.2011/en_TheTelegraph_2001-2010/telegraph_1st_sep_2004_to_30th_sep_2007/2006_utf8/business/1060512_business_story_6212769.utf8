 Kilburn Engineering beats BIFR deadline

 Khaitan: Looking at the road ahead

 Calcutta, May 11: Kilburn Engineering Ltd today reported a positive networth two years prior to the 2008 deadline set by the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR). The company is planning to relocate its existing plant in Bhandup in Maharashtra.

 The company has registered a net profit of Rs 19.27 crore on a total income of Rs 67.23 crore for the 18 months ended March 31, 2006. Kilburn Engineering plans to become a Rs 200-crore company by 2009-10.

 Since we have made our net worth positive before time, we plan to apply for immediate de-registration from the BIFR, which takes about three months. This company has a lot of potential, which would be driven by rising exports, said chairman Deepak Khaitan.

 Regarding the roadmap for the next six months, Khaitan said the company would look at joint ventures and acquisition of overseas technology. 

 It is looking at acquiring technology by buying mid-sized companies based in Germany, the US or other parts of Europe or through a joint venture, Khaitan said.

 Kilburn is also planning to relocate its Bhandup facility, as it wants to expand the capacity to raise output.

 It will invest Rs 25 crore in this new plant and plans to complete the relocation by the end of next year. The relocation process will be initiated in the next four to five months.

 Kilburn is looking at a 7-9 acre plot around the Thane/ Belapur belt in Mumbai, 15 to 20 km away from the 8.5-acre Bhandup facility. 

 Meanwhile, we will take a 25,000-sq-ft space on lease to accommodate the augmented production by the end of June, Khaitan said.

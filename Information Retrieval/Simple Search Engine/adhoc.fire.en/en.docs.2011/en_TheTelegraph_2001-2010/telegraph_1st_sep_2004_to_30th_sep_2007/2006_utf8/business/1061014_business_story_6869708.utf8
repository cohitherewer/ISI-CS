 Low-cost airports on Air Deccan radar

 Oct. 13: Saddled with a loss of Rs 340 crore last year, Air Deccan has finally seen the wisdom of paring its overheads by pushing the concept of low-cost airports.

 The carrier has now opened talks with the GMR group which has won the mandate to refurbish the Mumbai airport and several state governments, including Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, to build low-cost airports.

 We are in preliminary discussions with the GMR group to set up such airports, said Air Deccan managing director G.R. Gopinath.

 We wish to fly passengers to places like Agra to witness the Taj Mahal and such airports will provide us the scope to do so. Such terminals will reduce the airport costs by over 20 per cent, said Warwick Brady, chief operating officer, Air Deccan.

 Gopinath said the airline would not invest in the development of these airports. But we will assure direct daily connections to these places, he added.

 Brady said they have yet to develop the outline for low-cost airports but added that they could be constructed as adjuncts of existing large airports or also at regional airports, Brady said.

 We have approached the Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka governments and expressed the need for such airports. We have also met the Airports Authority of India officials and are hopeful that such infrastructure can be developed over the next three to five years, said Brady. 

 It is still too early to give details about such airports. Such terminals will depend on various factors, including the master plans for airports and other regional factors, said a GMR spokesperson. 

 Air Deccan is also in talks with various state governments like Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand to underwrite fees and offer subsidies to fly smaller routes in these states.

 We will be selective in flying to routes, which are unprofitable. While we will not stop catering to destinations we are already flying to, we will redeploy excess capacities on such routes, said Brady.

 The airline is hoping to come back into the black by 2008.

 According to the Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation, Indian private carriers will probably make a combined loss of $250 million this year and the next as they cut fares to maximise capacity utilisation.

 Meanwhile, the airline announced in Bangalore that it had raised $100 million (approximately Rs 450 crore) with two European banks to insulate it from the turbulence in the domestic aviation industry. It has already received the first tranche under the deal with Investec Bank, UK, and HSH Nord Bank AG of Germany, Gopinath said.

 Under the deal, the money will be available in four tranches over 15 months to Air Deccan subject to compliance of certain financial covenants. This includes an upfront payment immediately, Gopinath said.

 This deal would go a long way in ensuring Air Deccans financial stability and insulating us from the turbulence in the domestic aviation industry, Gopinath said. As part of the deal, Air Deccan has assigned its future aircraft supply contract in favour of a special purpose company, funded by these two international banks, the companys finance director Mohan Kumar said.

 Gopinath said the first two larger tranches would be received in the first-half of this fiscal and the remaining in the next financial year.

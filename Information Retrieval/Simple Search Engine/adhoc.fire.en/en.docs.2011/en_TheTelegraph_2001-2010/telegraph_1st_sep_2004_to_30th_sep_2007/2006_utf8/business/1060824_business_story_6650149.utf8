 Telecom titans at loggerheads over spectrum

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Aug. 23: The Tatas and Anil Ambanis Reliance Communications are on a collision course once again. This time it is over the allocation of spectrum for the launch of 3G services in India.

 The war of words between the two telecom players has riven the CDMA ranks just when the debate on the pricing of 3G spectrum turns somewhat raucous.

 The biggest bone of contention is over the pricing of the release of additional radio frequencies that will allow the telecom operators to offer more value-added services that will require faster download speeds.

 Tata Teleservices Ltd (TTSL) has really set the cat among the pigeons by reiterating group chairman Ratan Tatas view that spectrum should be assigned to the operator who is ready to fork out the highest revenue share in addition to an entry fee of Rs 1,500 crore.

 The Anil Ambani group has recoiled with horror at Tatas submission, choosing instead to make a lowball offer comprising an entry fee of Rs 150 crore for metro circles, Rs 100 crore for category B circles and Rs 50 crore for category C circles. It tacked on a graded fee structure which included a 6 per cent revenue share.

 Bicker, bicker 

 The two corporate giants are already battling each other over the right of access to the landing station in Mumbai that is controlled by Videsh Sanchar Nigam Ltd (VSNL), the erstwhile state-owned monopoly that the Tatas acquired in 2002. 

 The latest disagreement over the pricing of 3G spectrum emerged after the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) sought views from industry players on allocation and pricing of spectrum. 

 Reliance Communications Ltd (RCL) said it had suggested a graded fee structure which proposes a reasonable entry fee in addition to revenue share so as to enable speedier penetration and availability of 3G services.

 Under the hybrid offer, RCL has claimed that a national-level player would only have to fork out Rs 300 crore if it wanted to offer 3G services throughout the country. 

 According to Reliance Communications, if six key players start offering 3G services across the 23 circles, the government would raise Rs 1,800 crore and this should be enough for the government to bump the defence services off some of the spectrum bands especially 1900 MHz to either other alternative bands or an insular fibre optic network.

 Scarce resource

 The Tatas believe that spectrum is a scarce national resource and should not be allocated free to any telecom operator. 

 Buttressing the argument for a Rs 1,500-crore upfront payment, the Tatas said, This proposed fee has a logical basis, being approximately equal to the value paid for spectrum by the fourth cellular service providers in 20 circles across India. Fees thus collected can be used for the migration of existing non-commercial users of such spectrum, including the defence establishment. We feel that other mechanisms may not serve the purpose of discouraging spectrum hoarding.

 Reports now say that RCL is readying a communique to Tata TeleServices Ltd suggesting them to interconnect with the industry in order to participate in the harmonious growth of the Indian telecom sector and tune to the national teledensity targets of 500 million subscribers by 2010. 

 While it is apparent that Reliance wants the Tatas to back off from its suggestion of a Rs 1,500-crore entry fee, sources close to the Tatas say that the group has yet to receive such a communication.

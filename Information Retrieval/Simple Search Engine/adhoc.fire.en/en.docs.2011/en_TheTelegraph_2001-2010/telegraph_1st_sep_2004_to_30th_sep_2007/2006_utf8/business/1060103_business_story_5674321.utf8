 Mobile buzz gets louder as fixed users hang up

 M. RAJENDRAN

 Call for all

 New Delhi, Jan. 2: Mobile phone subscribers raced ahead of fixed-line customers in early 2005, underscoring the predominance of wireless technology over the wireline. 

 The issue was taken up by peoples representatives in Parliament and the government acknowledged that the trend was true and that the country was moving towards a wireless regime.

 The net growth in landline telephony has been affected due to preference towards wireless services. As a result, landline phones have been surrendered over the last few years, minister of state in communications and IT Shakeel Ahmad told Parliament early this month.

 The subscribers of fixed service (fixed line and WiLL-F) increased from 46.85 million to 48 million, the additions being predominantly WiLL-F. Mobile services grew from 57.37 million to 65.07 million during the quarter ended September 2005. The growth for the year (September 2004 to September 2005) for fixed-line services was from 43.87 million to 48 million and that for mobile services from 42.99 million to 65.07 million. 

 Industry observers feel India will move towards wireless faster and fixed-line phones will be seen only with enterprises and a few homes that use high bandwidth. They say the operators themselves are encouraging people to buy a mobile phone because of the cost factor.

 T.V. Ramachandran, director general of Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), says, The use of fixed wireless phones will shrink. Mobile phones will also be used for light and medium application like data download and streaming video. The fixed line will be used only where the high bandwidth is to be used.

 India is at an advantage since mobile phones overtook fixed-line phones when the investment of landlines was about to peak. This saved us from a major loss, he adds. 

 Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL), which is the hardest hit by the return of fixed-line phones, has already started to invest in its mobile phone service in a big way.

 In a note sent to the communications ministry early this month, BSNL said the installation cost of a wireline connection is about Rs 26,000 per line, while that of a wireless in local loop phone is about Rs 9,000 per line and for a mobile phone (excluding the handset) it is about Rs 5,500 per line. It further states that the operational expenditure per line per month for basic services is Rs 621.25 while the corresponding figure for cellular service is Rs 205. The average revenue for fixed-line phones provided by BSNL is Rs 704 per line per month while the average revenue for a post-paid mobile subscriber is Rs 668.89. It is Rs 360.71 for a pre-paid subscriber.

 Senior BSNL officials refused to comment on the changed scenario. 

 However, sources in the company say, It is true that mobile phones will be much sought after and that is precisely the reason that even the communications minister wants to use the wireless medium to reach rural areas.

 BSNL will follow the trend. We have an independent board and we are capable of restructuring ourselves quickly to the changes, says a senior BSNL board member.

 Manoj Kohli, president (mobility) at Bharti Tele-Ventures Ltd, says, The cost of maintenance of mobile phones is much less than the fixed-line ones.

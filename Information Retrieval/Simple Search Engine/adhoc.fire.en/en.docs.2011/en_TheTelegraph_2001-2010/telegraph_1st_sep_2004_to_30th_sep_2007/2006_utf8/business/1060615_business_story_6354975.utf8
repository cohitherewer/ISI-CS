 Arcelor, Mittal in talks

 June 14 (Agencies): Arcelor and Mittal Steel have begun talks about a possible takeover, Arcelor said, more than four months after rejecting Mittals overtures. The two rivals are likely to have another meeting today.

 Members of Arcelors management met Mittal Steel yesterday and another meeting is scheduled for today, said a source close to Arcelor. 

 Arcelor chief Guy Dolle was not present at the meeting, the source said but declined to give further details, including which people met, where and how successful the talks were.

 To ward Mittal off, the Luxembourg-based company penned a merger deal with Russian peer Severstal, but in the past week a shareholder rebellion has been brewing over fears of who would ultimately control Arcelor. 

 Mittal Steel declined to comment.

 An Arcelor source said the meetings might produce an increased offer from Mittal. Mittal Steel rejected this, saying it could make further improvements to the corporate governance component of the bid, but not the price. 

 It had already raised its bid once. The offer is currently worth 21.3 billion euros ($26.8 billion). Arcelor has urged shareholders to accept the 13 billion-euro Severstal deal, but many have reservations about it. Some say it was drawn up hastily and was not transparent.

 Others say steel tycoon Alexei Mordashov, Severstals owner, will gain full control of the combined company. Mordashov said this was not true. We created a very balanced corporate governance, representing minority shareholders interests, he said. 

 Scrip off Euronext

 Arcelor will be temporarily removed from the CAC 40 and SBF-120 exchanges in Paris at the end of trade on Friday for technical reasons related to Mittal Steels offer for the group, bourse operator Euronext said today. 

 It said its expert commission took the decision for strictly technical reasons.

 It is intended to prevent any threat to the normal completion of arbitrage operations, notably on the CAC 40 index, during the offer, and does not in any way assume any particular outcome for the operation under way, it said.

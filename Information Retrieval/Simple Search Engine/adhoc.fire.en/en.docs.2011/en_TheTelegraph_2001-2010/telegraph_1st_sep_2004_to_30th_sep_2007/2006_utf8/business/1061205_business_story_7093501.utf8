 Air Sahara, Indus Air to ink deal

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Dec. 4: Air Sahara may forge a strategic alliance with Mohan Meakins-promoted Indus Air to provide pilots, engineers and maintenance support to the fledgling low-cost airline.

 We have been approached by Indus Air for certain supports. They need some help, Air Sahara president Alok Sharma said here.

 We can provide pilots, engineers and maintenance facility to Indus Air. They need support for their Bomardier CRJ aircraft, Sharma said. Indus Air, which is expected to start its service soon, has already acquired the aircraft.

 Sharma said Air Sahara is open to such strategic alliances, which could be operational and even extend to marketing support. The move is expected to help both the airlines cut costs in a fiercely competitive market. 

 He said Air Sahara and Indus Air have approached the director-general civil aviation (DGCA) to get approval for the proposed arrangement. 

 The approval would not be a problem, he added.

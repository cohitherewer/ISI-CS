 GAIL set to gain from piped gas exclusivity rights

 S.P.S.PANNU

 New Delhi June 21: The government is exploring the possibility of granting exclusive marketing rights in piped natural gas to those companies that are the first to offer the service in a city. The period of exclusivity would be in the region of five to seven years.

 The move will help companies such as GAIL that have ambitious plans to set up city gas distribution networks. Sources said although the planning commission was opposed to the move, the petroleum ministry feels these projects will be unviable unless a protection is offered in the initial years.

 Since such a pipeline network involves huge investments, the first entrant should be allowed to recover costs before the market is thrown open to other players.

 The government is setting up the downstream petroleum and natural gas regulatory board, which will prepare the code of conduct for players involved in transporting and marketing of natural gas. 

 The board will probably propose separation of the gas transmission and marketing activities of companies. 

 As a proactive step, GAIL has already separated the accounts of its gas transmission and marketing business. 

 Sources said that GAIL has informed the petroleum ministry that it acknowledged the need to separate marketing and transmission activities for better regulation but considered the necessity to frame the rules of the game to ensure commercial viability in an unbundled environment equally important. For sustainable operations, it was necessary for both the transmission and trading businesses to have assured returns.

 Currently, GAIL is allowed to earn trading margins only on 17 per cent of the total gas it sells. The remaining 84 per cent is uncovered. This needs to be addressed, the company has told the petroleum ministry. 

 Compared to the long distance transportation of gas using a trunk pipeline, the city gas distribution system is a smaller but more intricate network. In Delhi, Indraprastha Gas, a subsidiary of GAIL, supplies piped gas for cooking and compressed natural gas to vehicles. GAIL has joined hands with PSU oil majors to supply gas in other cities: in Pune with Bharat Petroleum and with Hindustan Petroleum in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Gujarat.

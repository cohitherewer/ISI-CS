 CRR heat on home loans

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Dec. 10: Blue-chip companies, home loan seekers and real estate developers may soon have to pay more for their borrowings.

 This is the expected fallout of the Reserve Bank of Indias surprise decision last Friday to raise the cash reserve ratio (CRR) by 50 basis points in two stages starting December 23.

 Most bankers reckon that the most creditworthy corporate customers who generally pay less than the prime lending rate (PLR) on their advances will be the first to be hit by a rate rise.

 The CRR hike will soak up Rs 13,500 crore from the financial system. The resultant tightness in the market means that the banks cost of funds will go up, forcing them to tweak upward the sub-PLR loan rates.

 Loans to sensitive sectors such as commercial real estate are also expected to become costlier as the rates rise by at least 50 basis points. 

 There could be some cause of worry for home loan borrowers as well though a rise in interest rates is not forecast immediately.

 It is felt that HDFC and other private sector entities like ICICI Bank are likely to raise home loan rates as early as next month. Reports say that ICICI Bank may take a call on lending rates on Monday. Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) has already raised home loan rates thrice this year.

 Banks are now likely to re-work their credit structure, particularly for sub-PLR loans and advances to sensitive sectors. Interest rates will be on their way up in these segments, said Rupa Rege Nitsure, chief economist, Bank of Baroda.

 An official with another nationalised bank said though sub-PLR loans were not as prevalent as they were more than a year ago, the RBIs action will not only make interest rates expensive here but, in some cases, the banks may stop giving such loans altogether. there have been cases where a highly rated borrower got loans at 300 basis points below the PLR and an AA rated borrower by around 150 basis points. These differences will narrow, the official said. 

 For the retail individual, bankers said while most of the nationalised banks are likely to adopt a wait and watch attitude when it comes to home loans, there is likely to be 25 to 50 basis point hike in rates by players like HDFC and ICICI Bank.

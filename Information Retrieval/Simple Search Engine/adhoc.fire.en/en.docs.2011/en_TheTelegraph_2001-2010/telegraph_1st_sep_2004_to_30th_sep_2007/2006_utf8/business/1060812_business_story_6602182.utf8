 Aviva Europe head

 London, Aug. 11 (Reuters): Insurer Aviva named a new head of its European operations on Friday and said its international chief will focus on North America and Asia following the acquisition of AmerUs, the US life insurer bought last month.

 Britains biggest insurer said the increase in its international footprint means international chief Philip Scott will hand over responsibility for continental European operations to Tidjane Thiam, currently managing director of Aviva International.

 Thiam, 44, joined Aviva four years ago from consultancy McKinsey amp; Co. He will join Avivas executive committee.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Accused in innocence plea

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, April 28: Indiabulls won a reprieve today when the regulator stayed a ban on the brokerage ? and the others in the dock were immediately hoping for similar treatment.

 After a day of hectic lobbying by Indiabulls chairman Sameer Gehlaut and executive director Gagan Banga, who presented their case in front of the regulators today morning, Sebi deferred its order banning Indiabulls Securities from participating in the capital market.

 Pursuant to the same and on the basis of oral and written submissions made by Sameer Gehlaut, chairman, Indiabulls Securities, and having regard to the balance of convenience in the materiality of circumstances of the case, the order would be kept in abeyance subject to verification of clients and until further directions, Sebi clarified in a statement. 

 Earlier in the day, Indiabulls put forth its case before Sebi. In a notice to the stock exchange, Indiabulls Financial Services said, the order is based on factually incorrect data which the company is contesting. 

 The others who have been embroiled in the scam are looking to take the same tack.

 Today the regulator had just about enough time for one player and Indiabulls was able to present their case. We are still studying the fine print of the order and will be presenting our case to them (Sebi) on Tuesday, said a very optimistic Piyush Kulsheshtra, head (brand management) at Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd.

 Sebi had found that Motilal Oswal had 697 demat clients sharing common addresses. As a result it was directed not to open fresh demat accounts till further directions. 

 Others have also started preparing their case. We are still going through the fine print of the order and will present our case to Sebi on Tuesday or Wednesday, said C. Parthasarathy, chairman of Karvy Group. He, however, refused to give any further details. 

 The legal fraternity says the ex-parte order opens itself to challenge. The order is an ex parte order, which means that the order has been passed without giving the affected side a hearing. So sooner the affected parties file their case with SAT, the better, said Bombay High Court advocate Amit Karkhanis.

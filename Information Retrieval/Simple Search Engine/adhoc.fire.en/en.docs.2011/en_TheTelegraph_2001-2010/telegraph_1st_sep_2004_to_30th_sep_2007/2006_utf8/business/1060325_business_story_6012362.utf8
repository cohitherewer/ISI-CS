 Breather for Western Union

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 24: The Income Tax Appellate Tribunal has exempted US-based Western Union Money Transfer from paying income tax in India.

 Western Union is engaged in the business of remitting and transfer of money across continents by tying up with the postal department and some banks, financial institutions and travel firms as agents in India.

 The companys counsel told the tribunal that Western Union was not engaged in commercial activity in the country and only has a liaison office in Mumbai. 

 The agents were assisting in remittance of money. The counsel also said the company was not liable to pay any taxes in India, as it was exempt under the Indo-US double taxation avoidance treaty.

 To carry out its activities, Western Union has installed software at its outlets from where the money transferred from abroad was delivered to Indian residents. 

 The software generated a unique number ? MTCN (money transfer control) ? to the person sending money to India. 

 Later, the number was accessed by the agent and the money was delivered to the senders family. Agents get a 25-30 per cent commission for this.

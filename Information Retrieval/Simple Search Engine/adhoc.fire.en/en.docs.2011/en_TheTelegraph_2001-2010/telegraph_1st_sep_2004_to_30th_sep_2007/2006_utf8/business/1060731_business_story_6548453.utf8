 Manwani: Big plans

 Mumbai, July 30: Hindustan Lever Ltd has posted a 35.1 per cent rise in net profit at Rs 381 crore for the second quarter ended June 30, 2006, against Rs 282 crore in the same period last year. It will also pay an interim dividend of Rs 3 per share of Re 1 each for 2006.

 Though total sales grew by 8.7 per cent, the earnings from the continuing business of the FMCG major has increased by 10 per cent during the reporting quarter.

 Sales from the continuing business stood at Rs 3,083 crore against Rs 2,804 crore in the year-ago period. 

 Our focus has been on our core businesses and this strategy has enabled us to achieve another double-digit growth in the second quarter, said Harish Manwani, chairman of HLL. 

 The growth pace has been maintained through continuous innovation, not only in brand but also in process and we will continue to do so, said Manwani.

 Despite cost pressures, higher advertising and promotion spending, we have been able to increase our profit before interest and taxes margin by 140 basis points through cost-saving initiatives and selective price increases, said Manwani.

 All the segments of the company have achieved a higher growth than the market, except beverages, which has registered a negative growth of 3.7 per cent.

 The FMCG business grew 12.1 per cent to Rs 2,731 crore from Rs 2,435 crore, while the home and personal care (HPC) segment grew 13.9 per cent to Rs 2,286 crore from Rs 2,007 crore.

 The soaps and detergents business grew by 13.1 per cent and personal products category by 15.1 per cent. The processed foods and ice cream categories grew by 24.2 per cent and 34.3 per cent respectively.

 The FMCG growth continued in both the rural and urban markets and two-thirds of FMCG sales growth was volume led, said D. Sundaram, finance director of HLL. 

 We will take initiatives to grow the beverages segment on the back of two brands ? Brooke Bond and Lipton. A significant step towards that has been the relaunch of Taj Mahal. A brand building exercise will be undertaken in the third quarter, said Manwani.

 On the foods business, Manwani said, The processed foods market in India is still at a nascent stage with only about 5 per cent of total foods consumed being processed, which is significantly lower than even other developing countries.

 Worldwide, Unilever has a strong presence in foods and we have a strong expertise in building that business anywhere across the globe. We believe that we have the local insight and global capabilities to build the segment in India too and will definitely explore and build the market here, said Manwani. 

 However, during the second quarter of last fiscal, the company had registered sales of Rs 33 crore from this business, which has since been discontinued. Its profit after tax grew 26.2 per cent to Rs 379 crore for the quarter against Rs 300 crore last fiscal.

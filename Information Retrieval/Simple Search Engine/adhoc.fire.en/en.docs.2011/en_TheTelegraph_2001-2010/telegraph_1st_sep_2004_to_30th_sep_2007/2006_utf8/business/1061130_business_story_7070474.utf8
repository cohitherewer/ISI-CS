 Mumbai, Nov. 29: Idea Cellular, the Aditya Birla groups telecom initiative, is all set to enter the Mumbai and Bihar circles by August next year.

 The company is also looking at securing licences for nine new circles soon.

 We have already got the LoI (letter of intent) for Mumbai and Bihar and are looking at entering nine new circles soon. But there is still the issue of spectrum allocation, Idea Cellular CEO Sanjeev Aga said here today on the sidelines of a seminar.

 Traditionally, Mumbai is considered one of the most lucrative circles and it will be the first major step for Idea to establish a pan India footprint.

 The company is looking at sharing infrastructure in the Mumbai and Bihar circles. We will look at sharing infrastructure in Mumbai wherever possible, Aga added.

 Idea is also looking at a capital expenditure of close to $2 billion over the next two years. We are looking at a capex of between $1.5-2 billion for the next two years, that is till March 2008, for our existing 11 circles. But this does not include the circles of Bihar and Mumbai, he added.

 The capex will be a combination of internal accruals and equity.

 Ideas entry into the Mumbai circle has been delayed because its erstwhile joint venture partner, Tata Teleservices, was already present in Mumbai.

 A few weeks back, the company entered three new circles Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan and eastern Uttar Pradesh which will take the total number of Idea Cellular subscribers in 11 circles to 12 million from 11.5 million now.

 Rural India is rapidly becoming an important part of the telecom growth story. Growth in the rural sector and smaller towns is something to watch out for, Aga added. The company has a market capitalisation of $15 billion.

 Import duty faces axe in price fight

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 New Delhi, Dec. 5: The government is considering cutting import duties to cool down prices within the country. This comes in the wake of the inflation rate touching 5.45 per cent.

 A committee of secretaries has been asked to look into the issue and work out possible duty changes, North Block officials said. Its recommendations are expected to be placed before the cabinet soon.

 The government reduced duty on edible oil to 70 per cent in June for a six-month period. This duty cut might either be continued or deepened, officials said. 

 Food prices have been rising mainly on account of wheat, pulses and edible oil, all of which seem to be in scarce supply. Though the kharif crop is expected to ease wheat supplies, edible oil and pulses will continue to be imported to meet the demand-supply mismatch.

 The problem is that prices of palm oil, which is a major edible oil imported by us, has been hardening. Therefore, to keep prices here low, we may need to cut duties further, said officials. However, the Solvent Extractors Association of India has been urging the government to desist from cutting duties and instead, increase the thumb-rule price customs accepts while levying duty on edible oil imports.

 The country is expected to import some 6 million tonnes (mt) of vegetable oil, mostly palm and soya, to meet the demand-supply gap. This is about 10-12 per cent more than last years imports. Indias oilseeds production during 2006-07 is expected to be 2.5 mt, down from last years 3 mt.

 Imports of pulses are also proving to be a problem as the kind of pulses India buys are grown only in Myanmar and a few other countries. Therefore, the only feasible option with the government is to encourage an increase in acreage. Besides a pre-budget juggling with tariffs, the government may also consult with the RBI to try hike inter-bank interest rates marginally to cut down money supply in the economy.

 Duty-free wheat imports too have not helped India much as global prices remain high but the local winter crop promises to be better and could bail us out, officials said.

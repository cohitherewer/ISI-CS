 Calcutta, May 17: Berger Paints India Ltd will raise its solvent-based paints prices by 3-4 per cent by the end of this month, managing director Subir Bose said here today. 

 Solvent-based paints contribute nearly 55 per cent of Berger Paints turnover of Rs 1,100 crore as in 2005-06. 

 Thats the impact of increased crude oil and petroleum product prices on our bottomline. We have decided to pass it on to the customers, Bose said.

 Berger Paints has entered into the do-it-yourself paints segment by launching the Galaxy paint kit, priced at Rs 800 a pack. With this kit, customers can paint on their ceiling and walls the galaxy and stars which glow in the dark. This kit is targeted at children who now have a big say in the family when it comes to brand selection, said Abhijit Roy, senior general manager (marketing) of Berger Paints. 

 Using a pack, one can paint a surface area of 250 sq ft, he said. Berger Paints is planning to tie-up with schools, gift and toy stores to sell Galaxy paint kits.

 This is our first step in the do-it-yourself paints segment in the country, Bose said. 

 In developed countries, do-it-yourself is a fast-growing segment and we expect the concept to catch up with the people in India too. With the increase in disposable income, people are not only using more decorative paints (which is a premium product), they are repainting their houses more often.

 Berger Paints is planning to introduce a number of do-it-yourself and other innovative products like spatter-free paints in the next 3-4 months.

 TCS to ramp up Calcutta operations

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Ramadorai: Eastward ho

 Mumbai, Feb. 9: Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), one of the first software companies to set up shop in Calcutta, is planning to enhance its presence there. 

 ?We are growing in Calcutta and are looking at adding capacity there,? S. Ramadorai, CEO and managing director of TCS, told The Telegraph. 

 Although the east is becoming important for IT companies, it is not possible, at this point, to quantify the growth expected from this region, he added.

 The TCS centre, spread over close to 5.8 lakh square feet in the city, is planning to add another plot close to 30 acres.

 The company is negotiating with the state government for the suitable plot. It is also planning to hire about 1,000 freshers from campuses in the eastern region.

 ?Regarding availability of the talent pool, eastern region offers us the best potential, quot; Ramadorai said on the sidelines of an IT conference here.

 ?We are planning to set up a development centre at the new plot. It will be larger than the existing centre in the city,?? added a TCS official.

 Regarding recruitment plans for the year, Ramadorai said TCS will hire close to 15,000 by March. This is almost 5,000 more than the 10,000 people recruited last year. Mostly software engineers will be picked up from the regional engineering colleges.

 TCS?s Calcutta centre has close to 5,000 employees. Most of the company?s east Asian clients are serviced out of this centre.

 Having started its operations in Bengal in 1976, TCS was more focused on the domestic sector in the initial stages. From mid-80s, the focus shifted to include overseas clients too.

 The company is also expecting a sizeable growth from other centres in Bhubaneswar, Chennai, Bangalore and Pune.

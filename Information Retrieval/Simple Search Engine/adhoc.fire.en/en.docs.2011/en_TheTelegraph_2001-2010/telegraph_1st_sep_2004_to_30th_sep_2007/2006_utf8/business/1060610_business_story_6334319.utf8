 Inflation at 4.68%

 New Delhi, June 9 (PTI): The wholesale price-based inflation rate has declined to 4.68 per cent for the week ended May 27 from 4.74 per cent for the week ended May 20. 

 However, the threat of higher prices has arrived to haunt the common man, following an increase in domestic fuel prices.

 The fall in inflation was mainly 

 due to a decline in prices of some edible oils, sugar, textiles, 

 moong, bajra and raw cotton. The rate was still lower than 

 5.25 per cent in the corresponding period a year ago. The 

 WPI for all commodities was up 0.1 per cent to 201.3 points 

 owing to costlier food, non-food and industrial fuel prices.

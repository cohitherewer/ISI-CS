 PSUs promise special payout

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 9: Blue-chip public sector units that do not have expansion plans have agreed to pay special dividends to the government. 

 At the end of a two-day series of meetings between finance ministry officials and PSU chiefs, the former were promised special dividends by three to four PSUs. 

 Discussions were held with chief executives of Hindustan Aeronautics, NTPC, Power Finance Corporation, Rural Electrification Corporation, Shipping Corporation of India and Nuclear Power Corporation of India. The officials approached 16 blue-chip PSUs. 

 The government feels that if a PSU is sitting pretty on a pile of cash with no specific plans to use it in the near future for expansion or modernisation, it makes sense for it to give out a special dividend to shareholders or to issue bonus shares in lieu of the reserves. 

 The government being the majority owner can give advice to these PSUs on dividend pay-outs but attempts to coerce them to pay higher dividends can be countered by other shareholders.

 The government also wants all profitable state-owned firms to pay 20-30 per cent dividend and has written a letter to the companies on this issue. 

 The government is expected to garner some Rs 18,000-20,000 crore as dividend pay-outs from public sector units against the budget target of Rs 16,000 crore. 

 ONGC has already paid a record dividend of 250 per cent, or Rs 3,568 crore, to the government this year. 

 Bhel, too, has declared an all-time high interim equity dividend of 40 per cent for 2005-06 against an interim dividend of 35 per cent a year ago.

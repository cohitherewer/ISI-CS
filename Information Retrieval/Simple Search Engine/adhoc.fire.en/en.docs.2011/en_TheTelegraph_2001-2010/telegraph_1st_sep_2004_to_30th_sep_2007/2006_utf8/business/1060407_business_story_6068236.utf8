 Recipe for ITI makeover

 Demand buzz

 New Delhi, April 6: Global telecom equipment companies have asked the government to make ITI, the public sector unit, a large contract manufacturing hub to cater to the needs of multinational players.

 According to a position paper prepared by the convergence committee of Assocham, the government should take the initiative to transform ITI into a larger contract manufacturer.

 The committee, which prepared the report, has representatives from Lucent Technologies, Alcatel India, Siemens Communications and Qualcomm India.

 Telecom hardware suppliers like Ericsson, Siemens, Alcatel and Cisco could use such an oragnisation to source their equipment demands.

 Such an initiative in India would help build a national asset in telecom manufacturing, said the report.

 It said such a hub could generate an annual turnover of $ 2-$4 billion.

 Alternatively, a public- private partnership model based on a national large contract manufacturing facility could be set up to act as a common global quality resource of manufacturing to support multi-dimensional technologies like telecom, IT and broadcasting, said the paper.

 The committee feels that integrating the telecom hardware sector with global businesses and providing appropriate fiscal incentives will help develop the domestic market.

 The percentage of sales tax charged on locally produced goods in India is much higher and the tax equivalent charged on imported material. Also entry tax is payable in the states where goods are finally sold. In case of imported goods, only one incidence of tax or its equivalent is payable in the state. These fiscal dis-incentives have to be sorted out to encourage manufacturing in India, it said.

 Growth of the telecom manufacturing industry in India has not been consistent with the rise in subscriber base and the potential of the services market.

 The focus should be positioning India in the global value-added chain with a marketing brand, it added. 

 The paper also asked the government to work out a mechanism where some portion of all procurements of telecom hardware by government institutions are necessarily manufactured locally.

 The paper has projected handset manufacturing potential in the next decade at $ 13-$15 billion.

 Mishra: New role

 New Delhi, March 21: Former telecom secretary Nripendra Mishra has been appointed chairman of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai).

 Mishra, who succeeds Pradip Baijal, will take charge from tomorrow. 

 Baijal demitted office today after an eventful three-year term, which saw phenomenal rise in the telecom subscriber base and reduction of tariffs.

 Baijal, who took charge immediately after retiring as secretary in the department of disinvestment, had his share of controversies as Trai chief.

 While some took potshots at him for being close to certain industry houses, there were also reports of his differences with communications minister Dayanidhi Maran.

 The differences between Maran and Baijal were reportedly on basic policy issues relating to spectrum, broadband services and access deficit charges (ADC).

 The fact that the department of telecom had rejected a major portion of Trais recommendations on broadband services, including unbundling of the local loop and reduction in spectrum fee for broadband service providers, is seen by many as a reflection of the difference between the minister and Baijal.

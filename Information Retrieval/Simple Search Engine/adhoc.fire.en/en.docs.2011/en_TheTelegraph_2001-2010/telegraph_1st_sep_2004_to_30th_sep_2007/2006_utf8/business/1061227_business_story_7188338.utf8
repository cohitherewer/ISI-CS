 PM seeks note on retail FDI

 New Delhi, Dec. 26 (PTI): The Prime Minister is understood to have asked commerce minister Kamal Nath to prepare a note for the cabinet on allowing FDI in retail areas such as stationery, electronics and sports goods that do not affect small and neighbourhood shop owners. 

 The direction, according to sources, came after Nath broached the subject with the Prime Minister recently. 

 When asked, Nath confirmed to reporters that the government was looking at allowing FDI in retail areas such as sports goods, stationery, construction material and electronics.

 Sources said the commerce ministry has already taken up the matter with consumer affairs ministry.

 as part of efforts to unleash FDI potential in the retail sector without affecting farmers and traditional shop owners.

 They said the commerce ministry is expected to pursue the matter next month, adding that up to six potential areas could be opened up for retail FDI.

 The sources said a draft of the cabinet note has already been prepared.

 At present, FDI of up to 51 per cent is allowed only in single brand retail with prior government approval. In wholesale cash-and-carry, up to 100 per cent FDI is allowed.

 The government wants to encourage foreign investment in back-end of retail activity like logistics, cold chain and technology so that it even helps the traditional retailers. 

 All investments in retail sector have to be routed through the foreign investment promotion board. So far, 11 proposals have been received and four cleared.

 For back-end operations, worlds biggest retailer Wal-Mart has already tied up with the Bharti group. Similarly, French retailer Carrefour is reported to be exploring a tieup with the Wadias.

 Nath said FDI inflows in the first nine months of the current fiscal have grown 134 per cent to $6.1 billion and would cross $11 billion by March next.

 He said most of this was first mile investment and much more would follow.

 More than $3 billion of FDI was in pipeline in sectors like automobiles, telecom and financial services.

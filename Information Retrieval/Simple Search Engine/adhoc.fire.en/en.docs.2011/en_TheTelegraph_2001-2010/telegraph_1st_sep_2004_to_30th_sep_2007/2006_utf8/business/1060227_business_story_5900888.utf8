 New Delhi, Feb. 26: India 

 Inc is brimming with confidence ahead of the budget.

 The third-quarter business confidence survey conducted by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci) reveals that the overall business confidence index is riding at a 45-month high of 76.6 ? almost a notch and a half above the previous surveys 75.2.

 Industry is looking forward to the budget with loads of expectations and hoping it will winch up demand and help sustain the strong investment activity in the economy.

 There is an all-round expectation that the finance minister will address the twin tasks of rationalising taxes and increasing infrastructure investments. 

 The survey released on Sunday says with the strong demand conditions in the economy showing signs of flattening out, new and innovative steps would be needed to stoke them again. The current conditions index stands at 74.5, up from 73.1 in the last survey. The expectations index has increased from 76.2 in the previous survey to 77.7. 

 The survey notes that budgetary decisions aimed at improving the consumer confidence would translate into higher demand and help sustain the strong investment activity that the economy is witnessing now. 

 Around 84 per cent of the respondents feel that current overall economic conditions are moderately to substantially better than the last six months. The same proportion of the participating companies expects overall economic conditions to be moderately to substantially better in the coming six months. The survey reveals 72 per cent felt the current performance of their industry sectors had been moderately to substantially better vis-?-vis the last six months. 

 India Incs outlook for the industry performance in the near future is very positive with 78 per cent of the respondents looking forward to a much better performance of their industry sectors in the next six months. 

 At the firm level, 76 per cent of the respondents reported a moderately to substantially better current performance vis-?-vis the last six months, while 19 per cent reported to have sustained their level of performance. 

 On expected performance, 83 per cent of the participating companies said they expected to turn out a moderately to substantially better performance in the coming six months.

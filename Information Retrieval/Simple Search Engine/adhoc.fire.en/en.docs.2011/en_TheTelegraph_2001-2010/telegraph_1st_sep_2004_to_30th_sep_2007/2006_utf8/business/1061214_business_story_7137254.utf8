 Talks on for 

 mega US airline merger

 ANDREW ROSS SORKIN AMP; JEFF BAILEY

 New 

 York, Dec. 13: United Airlines and Continental Airlines 

 have been holding talks on a potential merger, a combination 

 that would create the biggest domestic airline, with a combined 

 value of $9 billion, people involved in the negotiations 

 said last night.

 The discussions, though far from 

 complete, could spur a wholesale realignment of the airline 

 industry.

 The talks, apparently initiated 

 by United, recently picked up pace after US Airways 

 bid last month to buy Delta Air Lines for about $8 billion, 

 they said.

 US Airways proposal, promising 

 $1.65 billion a year in savings by joining with Delta, has 

 helped add urgency to carriers interests in merging.

 Large airlines like United, the 

 second-largest domestic carrier, and Continental, the fifth 

 largest, have spent recent years lowering their costs to 

 become more competitive with low-cost carriers and with 

 each other. None of them want to be at a cost disadvantage 

 to rivals.

 A United spokesperson, Jean Medina, 

 and a Continental spokesman, David Messing, declined to 

 comment.

 Meanwhile, AirTran Holdings, a 

 low-cost carrier that competes against Delta, is expected 

 today to make an offer for Midwest Air, a smaller airline 

 in Milwaukee, for about $200 million, or $11.25 a share, 

 in cash and AirTran stock, a person close to the deal said 

 last night. 

 AirTrans chief executive, 

 Joseph B. Leonard, could not be reached.

 Uniteds chief executive, 

 Glenn F. Tilton, and Continentals chief executive, 

 Larry Kellner, have met in person to discuss a combination, 

 a person with knowledge of the talks said. 

 But two executives with knowledge 

 of Uniteds efforts expressed scepticism over the likelihood 

 of a United-Continental deal. The executives, who requested 

 anonymity because of their role, said Tilton had initially 

 approached Delta, which said it was not interested, before 

 contacting Continental.

 Tilton told analysts this week 

 that, We are not waiting for opportunities to come 

 to us simply because we havent identified to you which 

 one works best.

 Kellner was in Tel Aviv on business 

 yesterday.

 Any deal between the two airlines 

 is far from imminent. A person with knowledge of the talks 

 said United and Continental wanted to see how antitrust 

 regulators react to a possible merger of US Airways and 

 Delta. Deltas management opposes the proposal and 

 intends to file its plan to exit bankruptcy next week. 

 A flurry of meetings later this 

 week among Delta creditors and others on the US Airways 

 proposal could help decide whether Delta management will 

 be forced to consider the US Airways offer.

 Many investors and analysts have 

 maintained there are too many airlines operating in the 

 United States, and that consolidation would help improve 

 profit margins or reduce losses. 

 Analysts have long favoured a 

 combination of Uniteds Asian routes and heavy coverage 

 of the Western United States with Continentals Latin 

 American and European routes and its large and profitable 

 hub in Newark.

 At the stock markets close 

 yesterday, Continentals market capitalisation was 

 about $4 billion and Uniteds was about $5 billion.

 Any effort by the two to merge 

 would be complicated by an agreement Continental has with 

 Northwest Airlines. That agreement could allow Northwest 

 to block certain merger transactions involving Continental, 

 but could allow Continental more freedom to enter into a 

 combination if it were the acquiring party and if approval 

 of its shareholders were not required.

 Also, if Northwest entered into 

 a merger, it would lose its blocking power over Continental.

 The financial terms and other 

 details of a combination are far from being worked out, 

 people involved in the discussions said.

 The domestic airline industry 

 is expected to be modestly profitable for 2006 and more 

 solidly in the black for 2007, after more than $30 billion 

 of losses in recent years. 

 The continuing spread of Southwest 

 Airlines and other low-cost carriers, along with consumers 

 increasing willingness to shop for air fares via the Internet, 

 promises continuing pressure on profits.

 US Airways merger with America 

 West last year, reducing the combined carriers costs 

 and eliminating unprofitable routes, spurred interest in 

 other combinations.

 Still, mergers are difficult. 

 Seniority-based labour agreements make merging groups of 

 pilots, mechanics and flight attendants contentious. The 

 US Airways and America West labour groups have yet to complete 

 their integration. And antitrust concerns have damped interest 

 in potential combinations in the past.

 Tilton has been giving speeches 

 in recent months, as he did on Monday, endorsing industry 

 consolidation and saying United wants to play a part. But 

 he has refused to comment on specific combinations. Kellner 

 has mostly said that Continental prefers to remain independent, 

 but he conceded recently that changes in the industry could 

 force him to reconsider that position.

 Analysts generally hold Continental 

 management in higher regard, and hope it would run any potential 

 United-Continental carrier, rather than Tilton, a former 

 oil executive. The 

 key is the probability that Tilton takes his pile of non-cash 

 compensation and gives up United to Continentals management 

 team, Roger King, an analyst at CreditSights, said 

 in a report last month.

 Calcutta, April 5: The Centre is likely to approve the state?s much awaited Rs 7.64-crore tea tourism project by tomorrow.

 As part of the project, the Bengal tourism department will develop two estates of the West Bengal Tea Development Corporation Limited ? Hilla near Nagarkata and Mahua near Hashimara in the Dooars region. Hilla is spread across 709 hectares and Mahua across 683 hectares.

 ?We are awaiting the Centre?s approval, which is due any moment now. We will decide on the funds to be raised by the state after the Centre pledges its amount,? said M. Sengupta, director, department of tourism, government of Bengal.

 The project will be partly funded by the Centre, which will set up a tea interpretation centre to help tourists understand the harvesting process.

 The state government would develop the infrastructure, including roads, premises and other amenities for tourists.

 Sengupta said the state is urging private entrepreneurs to extend such projects to the Darjeeling and Terai regions.

 There are around 6,000 small growers in Bengal, who produce 21 to 22 million kg of tea each year. 

 Of the 86 operating gardens in Darjeeling spread over 19,000 hectares, very few have promoted tourism. Among these, the estate of Glenburn has world-class tourism facilities. 

 West Bengal Tea Development Corporation was set up in 1976 as a wholly-owned government company to take over economically viable tea estates to develop plantation, manufacture and sales.

 The company produces the orthodox and CTC varieties at the Darjeeling and Dooars estates respectively. 

 The corporation had taken over four sick estates ? Rungmook-Cedars (719 hectares), Pandam (382 hectares), Rangaroon (120 hectares) in Darjeeling district and Hilla in the Dooars region of Jalpaiguri district.

 Go some place ELSS

 Equity-linked savings schemes provide the tax break but not the returns. Srikumar Bondyopadhyay explains why

Its that time of the year again. Those of you who were sleeping over your tax planning must be spending sleepless nights now. Mutual fund houses seem to have read your minds too.

 Just when you were looking around for good tax saving instruments, at least three mutual fund houses Lotus India Mutual Fund, DSP Merrill Lynch and HSBC Mutual Fund have launched their equity-linked savings schemes (ELSS) recently.

 Another fund house, JM Financial Mutual Fund, has filed the prospectus for its tax saving scheme a few days ago with the market regulator and is likely to offer the scheme soon to the public.

 Around this time last year, Kotak Mutual Fund, Tata Mutual Fund, Fidelity and ABN Amro had launched their tax saving schemes.

 Biting your nails?

 But are new fund offers all that attractive? 

 Those who had invested last year in any of the NFOs must be biting their nails now because none of these schemes have matched the returns of the sensex or the S amp;P CNX nifty. Instead, they grossly underperformed the indices. 

 The one-year average returns of tax saving mutual fund schemes as on November 27 was only 34.87 per cent compared with a 52.46 per cent return by the sensex and a 57.92 per cent return by the nifty. 

 This, nonetheless, is much higher than the 8 to 9 per cent returns on fixed income instruments such as the Public Provident Fund, National Savings Certificate or bank fixed deposits (tax saving).

 Diversified equity schemes of mutual funds, with an average return of 39.47 per cent, performed better than ELSS, though these too underperformed the share price indices during the one-year period ended November 27, 2006. 

 Wheres the malady?

 Most of the schemes were launched when the stocks were riding a crest and they also diversified their investments too much the portfolio spread swelled from 260 stocks in March to 430 in November this year. 

 Most of these schemes allocated a lower percentage of their investible funds to large-cap stocks and the rally in stock prices over the last one year or so was mainly in large caps. 

 Existing ELSS, which have a larger proportion of their assets in large-cap stocks, outperformed the sensex or nifty returns during the period.

 More woes

 A government notification in November last year, with a subsequent clarification note, made ELSS investment less attractive. Two amendments were made to the ELSS notification dated November 3, 2005, which attempted to make all tax saving schemes closed-end for 10 years with a three-year lock-in. 

 The notification also said the lock-in should be counted from April 1 following the date of allotment or purchase of units of an ELSS. 

 However, a clarification note on December 20, 2005, changed the definition of year for determining the lock-in period. A year will now refer to a year commencing from the date of allotment of units (as against the earlier definition meaning a year commencing from April 1), it said. This means you cannot sell ELSS within three years from the date of purchase.

 The clarification note also inserted a new clause which included open-ended schemes as well for tax benefit. However, it clarified: The Unit Trust or other mutual funds can operate one open-ended equity-linked savings plan, subject to the prior approval of Sebi.

 This means each mutual fund can have only one open-ended ELSS, others must be closed-end ones.

 Gloomy picture 

 If we look at the performances of closed-end funds, including ELSS, the picture is not any brighter. While the one-year return (as of November 30, 2006) on the sensex is 55.84 per cent, the closed-end ELSS category gave an average returns of 43.36 per cent against the 44.71 per cent average return by the diversified equity schemes (closed-end). 

 No three-year magic

 Again, on a three-year investment horizon the lock-in period for ELSS advocated primarily to pre-empt quick churn as visible in diversified equity schemes the equity-linked savings plans didnt perform significantly better than diversified equity schemes. 

 While the three-year average return by the ELSS category was 42.62 per cent (as of November 27, 2006), diversified equity schemes generated an average return of 42.37 per cent. 

 Of course, both the categories beat the sensex and nifty returns over a three-year period by a wide margin.

 If the investment period is five years, diversified schemes outperform the ELSS category.

 Old is gold

 Unless you need to use up the Rs 100,000-deduction limit, you should not look at ELSS. Diversified equity schemes are far better options since they not only provide higher returns but also more flexibility in purchase and sale. If you want to invest in an ELSS to save outgo, choose one from the existing plans rather than go in for a new fund offer. Again while choosing from the existing plans, compare the returns for a fairly long period of time, say, five or three years. Choose those schemes that have consistently given a higher-than-average return over a period of time.

 New Delhi, Nov. 21: General Motors Corporation plans to set up an engine and power-train manufacturing plant in India.

 The power-train facility is an objective. We will take a call on the matter in the next six months, said Nick Reilly, president - Asia-Pacific, GM, in Talegaon, 130 km from Mumbai.

 Asked whether the plant would come up near the Talegaon plant, foundation stone of which was laid today, he said, Not necessarily in Talegaon. He however, declined to reveal the location where it intends to put up the plant.

 The Talegaon facility, set up at an investment of $300 million, would manufacture a Chevrolet mini-car, primarily for the domestic market, from the last quarter of 2008, he said.

 This will be GM Indias second car plant in the region. The company wanted to set up a second facility after it gave up its bid for Daewoos India car unit last year.

 Reilly declined to divulge the amount that GM will invest in the power-train facility. He, however, said such projects entail an investment of around $300-400 million.

 The Talegaon facility will begin production in the third quarter of 2008 and initially have an annual production capacity of 1.4 lakh Chevrolet Sparks. The company may produce other models at a later stage and will expand capacity accordingly. GM India has set a target of cornering a 10 per cent market share. At present, the companys market share is between 2.5-3 per cent.

 The companys second production facility comes at a time when GM plans to make India its export hub for the mini car.

 The mini segment is the largest in the country and we dont expect this to change with more and more first-time buyers entering the market, said Rajeev Chaba, president and managing director, GM India.

 However, Chaba said the company initially does not plan any exports from Talegaon, the production will be restricted for domestic use.

 GM India will increase its Halol plant capacity to 85,000 units from 60,000 units by the year-end. This will take GM Indias investments to Rs 1,400 crore.

 The company manufactures the Chevrolet Aveo, the Chevrolet Tavera, the Optra, Corsa and Corsa Sail at Halol. It hopes to sell 45,000 to 50,000 units this year.

 Reilly has earlier said GM will launch diesel engine variants of the Optra and the Aveo, and may consider the same for the Spark in a few years. According to estimates by J.D. Power, diesels share of the Indian passenger vehicle market is forecast to rise to 35 per cent by 2010 from 30 per cent now.

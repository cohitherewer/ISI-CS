 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Oct 3: Kishore Biyani-promoted Pantaloon Retail Limited has entered into an agreement with UK-based Alpha Airports Group to form a 50:50 joint venture company to develop travel retail and food amp; beverage catering business at leading airports in the country. Pantaloon also announced its stock split today.

 In a statement released in London, the Alpha group has reportedly said the two companies were in talks about opportunities that exist at Bangalore, Hyderabad and Delhi airports. Mumbai airport is expected to issue its requests for proposals shortly. The government is considering plans for the privatisation of Chennai and Calcutta airports. 

 Alpha operates over 150 shops in 15 countries with an annual turnover of over $880 million and is rated among the top 10 global players. Alpha currently operates duty-free shops at Cochin International Airport since 2002. 

 A large number of multinationals like the Nuance Group, the DFS Group, Alpha Airports Group, Dufry Group and Gebr Heinemann have lined up to set up retail services, including duty-free shops, at the new international airports being built across the country.

 Jet, Sahara keep all guessing

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Aug. 12: Jet Airways and Air Sahara maintain they have not initiated any move to arrive at an out-of-court settlement, while the market is abuzz with news about a meeting between the top brass of both the airlines. 

 Air Sahara sources confirmed that chief Subrata Roy was in the city for the last couple of days, but not to hold any meeting with Jet officials. 

 Senior Jet officials also denied 

 any settlement meeting took place. However, reports suggest 

 there have been secret meetings between the officials of 

 both airlines to reach an out-of-court settlement on the 

 merger row. The exit fee for Jet is being pegged at Rs 175-250 

 crore. Jet had paid Rs 180 crore for the revival of Air 

 Sahara and Rs 500 crore in lieu of Air Sahara shares pledged 

 with it, besides depositing Rs 1,500 crore in an escrow 

 account.

 Fund twist in May market crash tale

 In demand

 The IMFs Global Financial Stability Report for September has an interesting insight on the crash in the market in May. The report says that there were two phases to the sell-off. The first occurred in mid-May, which was a broad-based sell-off ..reflecting the general retraction from risk rather than a reassessment of fundamentals. Equity markets that had seen the largest run-up in prices since 2005, generally the biggest and most liquid markets, experienced some of the deepest declines, including in Argentina, Colombia, Hungary, India, Peru, Poland, Russia, and Turkey.

 Thats nothing new. But the report goes on to say that there was a second phase to the correction that happened in June, when investors began to discriminate among emerging markets. Is this the famous de-coupling, finally separating the men from the boys of the emerging market pack? The report says, Countries where markets continued to weaken and that would likely be most vulnerable to a continued retrenchment from risk displayed one or both of the following characteristics: large balance of payments financing needs as signalled by current account deficits combined with an excessive reliance on portfolio inflows and . questions of policy credibility. The first characteristic sounds very familiar Indias balance of payments has been worsening and portfolio inflows are very important as a means of financing the deficit. The report doesnt mention India, however, but points to South Africa, Hungary and Turkey as being the most vulnerable. Brazil and Indonesia, on the other hand, are supposed to have done better.

 Its true that Turkey, for instance, has had to raise interest rates dramatically to prevent a run on its currency. But consider the markets this quarter. As of September 14, 2006, the MSCI index for Turkey is up 6.1 per cent, that for Hungary is up 5.6 per cent while the South African MSCI index is down 3.2 per cent. No clear trend here at all the South African market may be down because commodities and gold are down. But even MSCI Brazil is down 2.3 per cent this quarter, while Indonesia is up 11.4 per cent. Whats more, year to date Hungary is up 5.9 per cent and Brazil 5.0 per cent. MSCI India is up 13 per cent this quarter and 26.2 per cent year to date. The data doesnt seem to support the IMFs hypothesis that its the size of the current account deficit thats making a difference among emerging markets. Nor should it. While too high a level of current account deficit is a worry, other factors like growth too need to be kept in mind. India may have a current account deficit, but it grows much faster than Brazil and thats reflected in the market returns.

 Retail credit

 The IMF report also talks about household credit growth in emerging market countries. Weve had a boom in retail credit in the last few years, so are Indian households now relatively over-leveraged? According to the IMF data, the ratio of household credit to personal disposable income was a mere 9.7 per cent in 2004 compared with 36.4 per cent for Thailand, 64.5 per cent for Korea and 95.5 per cent for Taiwan. By end-2005, household credit as a percentage of GDP was below 10 per cent compared with an average of 29.2 per cent of GDP for emerging Asian countries. (The average is 58 per cent of GDP for mature markets.) Retail loan penetration in India is well below Chinas.

 Nevertheless there are notes of concern. The average growth of real household credit in 2004-05 in India was the highest in emerging Asia. Moreover, household leverage or the ratio of household liabilities to household assets is high in India, at almost 60 per cent, compared with around 30 per cent for the US.

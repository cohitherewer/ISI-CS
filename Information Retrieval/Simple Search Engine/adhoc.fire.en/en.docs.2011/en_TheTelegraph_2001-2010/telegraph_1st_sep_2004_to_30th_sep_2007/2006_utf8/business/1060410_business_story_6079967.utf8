 New Delhi, April 8: With India Inc allocating large sums for Internet advertising, the race to buy space on popular websites is getting intense.

 ?While the mainstay continues to be financial services products, more and more categories will enter the Internet advertising market,? said Sam Balsara, chairman and managing director of Madison Communications. 

 Sharat Jain, chief executive officer of Dentsu Media Palette, said, ?Many big companies are evaluating this media as Internet advertising can be used to reach a focused audience unlike other avenues.? 

 Besides, on the Internet, companies also have the capability to monitor the impact of advertising, he said.

 According to the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI), total online spends on advertising increased by 155 per cent to Rs 107 crore in 2004-05 from Rs 42 crore in 2003-04. The IAMAI predicts the market will double to Rs 218 crore by 2006-07.

 Jobsite Naukri.com, one of the biggest advertisers on the Internet, pegs the online advertising market at Rs 400 crore, with classifieds carving up Rs 250 crore and jobs and matrimonials Rs 150 crore. ?According to our estimates, the market is likely to grow by over 70 per cent this year,? said Sanjeev Bikchandani, CEO of Naukri.com. Online advertising comprises a substantial part of the job portal?s budget at Rs 15-20 crore.

 IAMAI?s Subho Ray said: ?Last year was the first time that large traditional advertisers began to spend more online. While the online medium is still relatively young, the growth of wireless Internet access and broadband paints a promising picture for online ads.?

 A Coca-Cola spokesman said, ?We have our own website on which we advertise our product range. But we also advertise our website on various other popular sites.? He said advertising on the Internet helps the company target the youth which makes up the bulk of online users. The spokesman added that the market was evolving and Coca-Cola has stepped up its presence in the online advertising space. 

 A Bharti official said, ? Online advertising constitutes a significant part of our Internet marketing strategy. While we have our own website, which offers billing and other important information for Airtel subscribers, we are also advertising on a lot of other popular websites.? 

 The cricket season is the peak time for online advertising, the official added. 

 The industry estimates 38.5 million users of Internet in India, which is expected to touch 100 million by 2006-07. 

 Analysts said although the online medium bags 3 per cent of the total advertising market, its share is expected to jump over the next five years.

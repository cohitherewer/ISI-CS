 Calcutta, May 19: Airtel will focus on network upgradation this fiscal with a combined investment of Rs 400 crore in Calcutta and Bengal circles.

 The mobile service provider of Bharti Tele-Ventures Ltd will add 500 cell sites, or base station towers, to the existing 600 sites in the city, while the number of cell sites in the state will be increased to 700 by the end of this fiscal.

 This is part of our two-pronged strategy. The first is network upgradation where, besides adding sites and switches, Airtel will also introduce various state-of-the-art innovations like mobile base stations and in-building solutions. The Calcutta mobile market has been growing between 65 and 70 per cent year-on-year and we hope to play an active role as we expect the market to post a higher growth, said Ajai Puri, chief operating officer ? Calcutta, Bharti Tele-Ventures Ltd.

 The company is currently adding 30,000 to 50,000 new connections on a monthly basis.

 Airtel covers over 350 towns in the state and plans to extend the coverage to another 600 towns by the end of this fiscal.

 The company has 15 Airtel relationship centres in the city. With a focus on customer service, it plans to set up 100 such centres in the city.

 The company also introduced mobile base station towers, a state-of-the-art equipment that involves temporary setting up of such towers near areas of high octane public events like book fair or cricket matches to improve or extend the coverage in the given area which does not have such towers.

 There are two such mobile base stations for Calcutta with each costing over Rs 1 crore. The company will set up 15-16 such towers on a temporary basis in the eastern region before permanent ones could be constructed, which take time and require municipal approvals, Puri said.

 Airtel also introduced in-building solutions, which uses the wired distributed signal mechanism. Here, the base station is constructed internally and the whole building is wired accordingly.

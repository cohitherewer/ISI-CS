 ICI quarterly earnings jump

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, July 25: ICI India Ltd has posted a net profit of Rs 18.16 crore during the April-June quarter of this fiscal compared with Rs 10.61 crore in the January-March period.

 Net sales increased to Rs 230.17 crore from Rs 190.98 crore in the January-March quarter. Other income grew three-fold to Rs 6.55 crore from Rs 2.05 crore in the fourth quarter of last fiscal.

 The paint manufacturers first quarter fiscal performance cannot be compared year-on-year as the company sold its rubber chemicals division in December. 

 Earlier, ICI decided to sell its stake in Uniqema for Rs 280 crore and buy out Hindustan Levers shareholding in joint venture Quest India and merge it with itself.

 The board of ICI has approved a proposal to buy back 8-10 per cent shares from the market by utilising not more than 25 per cent of its paid-up capital and free reserves at a price not over Rs 350 a share. Despite a rise in crude prices in the global market, ICI has been able to increase its operating profit in the first quarter of the current financial year on the back of a higher sales turnover. 

 Harrisons net dips

 Harrisons Malayalam Ltd has posted a sharp drop in net profit at Rs 34 lakh in the first quarter of this fiscal compared with Rs 9.79 crore in the same period last year. 

 The rubber estates of the company make a significant contribution to its fiscal performance and a 30-day industry-wide strike in these estates affected Harrisons quarterly performance.

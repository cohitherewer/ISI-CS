 Orissa clears Vedanta smelter

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, May 30: The Orissa government today approved the first phase of Vedanta Resources 5-lakh-tonne aluminium smelter in Jharsuguda district.

 The construction work for the Rs 7,000-crore project in Bhokamunda area of Jharsuguda, which will be implemented in two phases of 250,000 tonnes per annum each, is expected to start in June. 

 In the first phase, the company would invest Rs 3000 crore. The construction of the first phase is expected to be completed in the second half of 2009 and the second phase is expected to get over by 2010.

 The proposal for the establishment of smelter in Jharsuguda district was placed before the high-powered project clearance authority, chaired by chief minister Naveen Patnaik, this afternoon. The aluminium smelter project will largely cater to the export market. According to company officials, around 40 per cent of the funds for the project will be generated through internal accruals, while 60 per cent would be debt funded.

 Setting up the smelter is a major step in Vedantas corporate plan to create one million tonnes of aluminium capacity in India. The smelter will use alumina from the nearby Lanjigarh refinery, which is being set up at an estimated cost of Rs 4,500 crore and is nearing completion.

 The alumina refinery project at Lanjigarh is caught in a controversy as the centrally- empowered committee of the Supreme Court has recommended that the Union government should not allow the the contentious project to come up. However, the construction of the alumina refinery is going on at full steam.

 Besides Vedantas alumina smelter, the project clearance authority asked its officials to speed up the process of setting up three mega thermal plants of 3000 megawatt each by Navbharat Power, Mahanadi Aban Power Company, and GMR Energy. The state will get an estimated Rs 150 crore revenue per year from each of these power plants.

 The environmental impact of the thermal plants also figured at the meeting. The chief minister asked the officials to take up plantation work around the projects on a priority basis.

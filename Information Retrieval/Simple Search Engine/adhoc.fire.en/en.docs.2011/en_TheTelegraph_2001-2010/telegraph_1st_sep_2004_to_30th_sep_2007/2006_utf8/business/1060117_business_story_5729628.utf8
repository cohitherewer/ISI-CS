 BEML in three-way venture

 Kolkata, Jan. 16 (PTI): Mining equipment manufacturer Bharat Earth Movers Limited (BEML) has entered into a three-way joint venture to diversify into contract mining, its chairman and managing director V.R.S. Natarajan said on the sidelines of an international mining exhibition here today. 

 Natarajan said the proposal for the joint venture, which would have an Indian and an Indonesian promoter company, besides BEML, was awaiting the approval of the government. 

 Currently, the government holds 61 per cent in Bharat Earth Movers.

 BEML will hold 45 per cent in the joint venture, while the other two partners would control the remaining 55 per cent between themselves, Natarajan said.

 The BEML chief said since the government was allotting coal blocks to private parties to enhance production to meet future energy demands, the company was eyeing a huge business opportunity in this sector. 

 The firm is also seeking the governments approval to raise Rs 400 crore capital from the market to fund its expansions.

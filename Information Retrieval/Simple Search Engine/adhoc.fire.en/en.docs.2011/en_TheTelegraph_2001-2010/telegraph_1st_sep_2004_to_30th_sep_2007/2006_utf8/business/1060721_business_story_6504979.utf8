 Revamped Zen to roll out by year-end

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 20: Maruti Udyog Limited is set to launch a revamped version of the Zen by the year-end.

 The launch details, including prototype testing and R amp;D activities, are being worked out.

 We plan to launch the small car by the year-end, which would be in the same category as the Zen. We are focusing exclusively on the Indian market now. We will decide on exports depending on the response here, said S. Oishi, director, marketing and sales, Maruti Udyog.

 Company officials did not deny the plans to phase out the current Zen, but said they were working out the details.

 They, however, added that the brand Zen would continue even if the current models were phased out.

 This would be one of the few instances in automobile history wherein the brand is retained while the model undergoes a makeover. The Toyota Corolla is another such vehicle. Maruti plans to launch five models in the next five years, which might include a sedan to fill the gap between the Esteem and the Baleno.

 Q amp;A

 Bank bonus

 Being a retired bank employee, I am eligible to get 1 percentage point higher interest on term deposits with the bank I was working with. Ill get another 1 percentage point higher rate for being a senior citizen. Shall I get that 2 percentage point higher rate in term deposits if made in joint account with my wife or son on either or survivor basis?

 Gautam Majumdar, Srirampore

 You are eligible to get the 2 percentage point higher interest rate on term deposits even under a joint account. However, on your death within the tenure of the deposit, the co-holders of the deposit will not get the higher interest rate. It will be better if you make your wife or son nominee of your deposits instead of making them co-holders.

 Undivided rules

 I, as the karta of an HUF, sold my late fathers agricultural land, which he had acquired many years ago. I want to gift the amount to my daughter. Can I do that?

 Virendra Kumar Dutta, Uttar Dinajpur

 If you have siblings, you cannot gift the proceeds from the sale of your fathers asset. The ancestral assets are collectively held by the members of an HUF and hence the proceeds must be divided among the members. 

 PPF account

 My PPF account completed 15 financial years on March 31, 2004. I extended the deposit for another five years. How much shall I be allowed to withdraw from the extended account?

 Haripada Bhattacharya, Calcutta

 A public provident fund subscriber, continuing his or her subscription beyond the initial 15 years, can withdraw up to 60 per cent of the balance to his or her credit at the commencement of each extended period (in blocks of five years). The amount can be withdrawn in one or more installments, but one can withdraw money only once in a year.

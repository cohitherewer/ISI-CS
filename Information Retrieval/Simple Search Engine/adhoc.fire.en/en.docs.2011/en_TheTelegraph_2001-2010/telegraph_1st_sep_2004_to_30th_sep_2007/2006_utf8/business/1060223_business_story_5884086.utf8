 RINL awaits price spike

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Feb. 22: Public sector steelworks Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Ltd (RINL) is hoping steel prices will firm up in the medium term. 

 Y. Siva Sagar Rao, chairman and managing director of RINL, said the company expects long products prices to go up by Rs 500-1000 per tonne in the next two to three months.

 Long product prices are now ruling at an average of Rs 22,000 per tonne. Prices have started sliding after reaching a high of Rs 30,000 per tonne. Last time Indian steel companies could raise prices marginally was in September.

 Rao said there are indications that prices would firm up. For instance, scrap prices have shot up from $230 to $260 per tonne. 

 He pointed out that domestic prices are now matching with import prices of steel.

 It can be mentioned that surge of imports have increased the availability of products in the domestic market. 

 As a result, prices have remained soft despite a rise in demand. Stupendous rise in Chinese production has also depressed international prices. 

 The softening of prices have also been telling on RINL, popularly known as Vizag Steel Plant.

 Soaring input costs and the soft price trend may reduce the companys net profit by Rs 1,000 crore.

 Speaking on the sidelines of an international steel seminar here today, Rao said profits were likely to drop to around Rs 1,000 crore.

 In 2004-05, the company had posted a robust result and earned a net profit of Rs 2,008 crore over a turnover of Rs 8,181 crore.

 Adding to its woes, an income tax burden of around Rs 400 crore would contribute to the low profit figures.

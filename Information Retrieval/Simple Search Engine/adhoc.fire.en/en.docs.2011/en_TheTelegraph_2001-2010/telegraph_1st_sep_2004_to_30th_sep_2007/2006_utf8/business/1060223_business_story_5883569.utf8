 More transparency in trade data sought

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Rangarajan: Clarity call

 New Delhi, Feb. 22: Expressing concern over the divergence in trade data compiled by the Reserve Bank and government, the Prime Minister?s economic advisory council today sought more transparency in the published data to inspire investors? confidence and said the current account deficit at less than 3 per cent for 2005-06 was still in the comfort zone.

 The economic advisory council (EAC), chaired by C. Rangarajan, has pegged the current account deficit for this fiscal at 2.9 per cent of the GDP and said the deficit would be in ?comfort zone? provided it goes to finance productive investment.

 ?While it is appropriate for an economy of our size with vast investment needs to be running a current account deficit (CAD), its size and composition warrant continuous monitoring. At almost 3 per cent of the GDP, the CAD may still be in the comfort zone provided it goes to finance productive investment,? said the council?s report on the country?s balance of payments.

 The report, however, said capital flows are slated to decline marginally from 4.5 per cent to 4.1 per cent of the GDP. ?Nevertheless, they are likely to be large enough in 2005-06 to fully bridge the CAD and leave a margin of $10.7 billion on top of that as net accretion to reserves,? it said.

 The council, in its report on balance of payments to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, attributed the divergence in trade data of the Directorate-General of Commercial Intelligence and Statistics (DGCIS), which functions under the commerce ministry, and balance of payments by the Reserve Bank largely to one-off payments for defence and civilian aircraft imports.

 EAC, however, said, ?It may be useful to be as transparent as possible in the published data in the public domain so as to manage expectations on the bop outlook which is important to inspire the trust and confidence of potential investors, both domestic and foreign.?

 During the current year, trade deficit under the DGCIS data is projected at 5.2 per cent of the GDP vis-?-vis 7.7 per cent under the balance of payments data of the RBI.

 If the CAD is calculated using the DGCIS trade data, it amounts to only 0.3 per cent of the GDP, while it goes up to 2.9 per cent of the GDP under the RBI data.

 Trade of invisibles continues to remain buoyant. The report also said the larger estimated outflow under investment income this year compared with last year, partly owing to the payout of accumulated interest on India Millennium Deposits in December 2005, will be more than offset by increases in software exports and remittances.

 Arcelor to discuss Mittal offer today

 London, June 10 (PTI): The Arcelor board will meet in Luxembourg tomorrow to respond formally to Lakshmi Mittals improved offer. 

 The board is expected to urge Mittal Steel to come up with a bid matching the 44-euro-a-share valuation it claims the Severstal deal is worth, the Guardian reported from Brussels. 

 Mittal has offered 34.50 euros per share and said it had no plans of raising it. 

 Arcelors advisers have, meanwhile, denied reports that the board would scrap its plans to hold a shareholders meeting on June 28 requiring a 50 per cent majority to vote out the Russian deal.

 They rebutted suggestions that Arcelor would instead go ahead with an alternative meeting, which would approve proposals to give Alexei Mordashov, Severstals owner, between 32 per cent and 38 per cent of the group. That would take place days after Mittals offer expires on July 5. 

 The report said directors would be forced to give a proper response to a letter from shareholders representing about 30 per cent of the capital ? drafted by Mittals bankers, Goldman Sachs ? demanding an extraordinary meeting on the Russian deal. 

 The report said hedge funds owning nearly 15 per cent of Arcelor have readily signed the Goldman letter, while other investors have threatened legal action to block the Severstal merger. They want Mordashov to make a formal takeover offer, saying it is needed under Luxembourgs takeover law, and he has spoken of taking his stake to 45 per ? a claim he rejects. 

 As talks between Mittal and Arcelor bankers on Mittals confidential business plan concluded without a breakthrough, Mordashov and his backers sowed further confusion about the ultimate control of Arcelor.

 On May 26, Arcelor and Severstal 

 announced they have agreed to merge, creating the worlds 

 steel champion and most profitable steel company. .

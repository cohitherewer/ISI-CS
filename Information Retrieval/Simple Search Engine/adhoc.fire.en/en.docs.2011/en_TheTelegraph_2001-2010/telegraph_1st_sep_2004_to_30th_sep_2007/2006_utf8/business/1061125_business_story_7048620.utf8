 New Delhi, Nov. 24: The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) today initiated a consultation process as part of its plan to bring down roaming charges on national and international networks for mobile phone subscribers. 

 Trais consultation process on review of ceiling tariffs for roaming services aims to seek stakeholders opinion in bringing down the roaming charges by various measures, including fixing a ceiling tariff for services based on usage.

 According to the Trai consultation paper, The authority proposes to revise the existing roaming tariff by fixing a ceiling tariff for roaming services based on usage. It means there shall be no rental component for availing roaming services and there shall only be a composite roaming tariff on per minute basis, the regulator said.

 Roaming is defined as the provision for a cellular subscriber to make and receive voice calls and data services when travelling outside the geographical coverage area of the home network by using the visiting network.

 A final decision would be taken only after receiving and subsequently analysing views of the industry on Trais suggestion, the regulator added. 

 When asked how this would affect revenues, most telecom operators said internal discussions on the consultation paper were on and a statement would be issued soon. 

 At present, there is a monthly rental of Rs 50 for roaming services, with local outgoing calls charged at a maximum of Rs 3 per minute. Incoming calls on roaming are charged at a maximum of Rs 3.99 per minute by most operators, while an SMS sent when the customer is on roaming costs Rs 4. For international roaming the charges are higher. 

 Trais analysis says the roaming charges levied by operators are on the higher side compared with the underlying cost of providing the service. 

 There is a growing impression among subscribers and stakeholders that there is a strong case to revisit the roaming tariffs. The Authority studied the prevalent roaming tariffs in the market and has flagged the issue of inadequate competition for roaming services, the regulator said.

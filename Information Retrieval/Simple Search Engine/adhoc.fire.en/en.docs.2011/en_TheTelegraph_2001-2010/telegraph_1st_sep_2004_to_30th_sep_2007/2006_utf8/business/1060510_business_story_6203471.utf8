 Summer brings bad spell for tea

 Waiting for the rains

 Calcutta, May 9: Tea production in Darjeeling is likely to be down 25 per cent and even 50 per cent in certain gardens in March-April 2006. 

 Despite sporadic showers, gardens in the Dooars and Terai region have experienced a drop of 35 to 50 per cent in the same period. The first flush season took a hit due to the dry spell since February.

 Ronbung, one of the four to five sub-districts that suffered due to the dry spell, experienced a drop of 33 per cent in crop production during April. The Teesta valley as well as the higher elevation gardens (around 7000 metres) were particularly affected.

 There are 87 gardens in Darjeeling, out of which 75 are members of the Darjeeling Tea Association (DTA).

 According to the DTA figures of 43 gardens, production for the month of March last year was 3.22 lakh kg.

 The figures for April and May 2005 stood at 8.6 lakh kg and 3.94 lakh kg, respectively.

 The figures were later revised. The revised figure for March-May 2005 was 17 lakh kg.

 This year 45 gardens have sent in their production details. 

 In April 2006, the produce was 3.45 lakh kg compared with 8.6 lakh kg in April 2005 from 43 gardens. 

 The majority of this first flush (around 80 per cent) is exported.

 Local industry experts said May would be a very crucial month as most of the shortfall would be made up during this month.

 The annual orthodox Darjeeling production is around 9.5 million kg, of which 65 per cent is exported.

 Exports, which are generally sent directly from the gardens, would have been initially affected.

 However, the good quality of tea and the excellent rapport with importers, most of the produce is exported on the basis of forward contract, local sources said.

 Many of the gardens are already making up for the shortfall with the sporadic showers that the region has been experiencing.

 The condition was particularly bad in March and early April when the gardens were forced to run their factories every alternate day or twice a week in order to cover high overhead costs due to the shortfall.

 Around 33 to 35 per cent of the Darjeeling tea is organically produced. This is expected to go up to 50 per cent in the next four years.

 Guwahati auctions

 After a weak opening last week where 5 per cent of the offerings were sold, the auctions bounced back with a good general demand. The offerings constituted 52,461 packages.

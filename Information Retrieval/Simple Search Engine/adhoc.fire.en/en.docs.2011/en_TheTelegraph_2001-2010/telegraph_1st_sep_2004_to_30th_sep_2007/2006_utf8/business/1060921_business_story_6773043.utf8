 Calcutta, Sept. 20: Maruti is planning to tap first-car buyers to achieve its goal of selling one million cars a year by 2010. 

 There are 50 million two-wheelers on Indian roads and we want to make each one of them buy a car, said Maruti Udyog managing director Jagdish Khattar today. He was in the city to sign a car finance pact with Magma Leasing. 

 The countrys largest car manufacturer is also planning to widen its reach in rural and semi-urban markets. 

 In rural areas, people want to pay a lump sum when they have money after harvest time. They want the remaining cost to be financed with borrowed funds. Hence, we can increase our market penetration by making good cars available at affordable prices with easy finance options, Khattar added.

 Maruti already has tie-ups with eight financial institutions, including Citibank, ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank and others, which offer finance schemes under the Maruti Car Finance umbrella. The Magma car finance facility for Maruti cars will also come under this banner and be available for pre-owned Maruti cars as well. It also has a standalone arrangement with the State Bank of India, which is doing exceedingly well, Khattar said. 

 Maruti has 230 sales points across the country. The merged entity of Magma Leasing and Shrachi Infrastructure has over 116 branches, primarily in the rural and semi-urban areas, from where Maruti car finance will be available. This will give us a huge reach in our target market, Arun Malhotra, chief general manager, (marketing strategy and development), Maruti Udyog, said.

 Among buyers in the country, 37 per cent are first-car buyers and we want to tap this segment with our small car offerings, Malhotra said. 

 Maruti is focusing more on the compact car segment to drive its business growth. While Maruti 800 will remain as the volume driver, we are concentrating more on the Zen and Swift, Maruti corporate communication manager Puneet Dhawan said.

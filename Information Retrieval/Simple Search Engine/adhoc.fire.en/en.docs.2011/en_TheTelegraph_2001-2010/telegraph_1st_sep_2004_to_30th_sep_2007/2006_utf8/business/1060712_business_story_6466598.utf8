 Federal Bank takes insurance plunge

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 11: Kerala-based The Federal Bank Ltd today forayed into the risk-cover business by picking up a 26 per cent stake in the IDBI-Fortis joint venture on life insurance.

 The private sector bank has signed a memorandum of understanding with IDBI and Fortis of Belgium to set up the venture. IDBI will hold a 48 per cent stake and the remaining 26 per cent will lie with Fortis.

 IDBI and Fortis had earlier tied up to start a life insurance venture. But being a bank, IDBI could not pick up more than 50 per cent stake in the joint venture under the Reserve Bank guidelines, while Fortis could not have more than 26 per cent according to the present FDI rules for the insurance sector.

 So, IDBI was scouting for a third partner and finally roped in The Federal Bank. 

 We have signed the MoU for the insurance venture today. The requisite regulatory approvals are yet to be obtained, said The Federal Bank chairman-cum-managing director M. Venugopalan.

 The partners will jointly approach the regulators for obtaining the necessary statutory and regulatory approvals and develop an effective business model, said V.P. Shetty, chairman and managing director of IDBI.

 The insurance company will start with an initial share capital of Rs 100 crore, which will be increased to Rs 700 crore in three years time. This means that The Federal Bank will shell out Rs 26 crore for the venture in the first year, he added.

 Both the banks are eyeing more business by offering other financial products in addition to the regular ones.

 With increasing competition, rising interest rates and shrinking margins in core banking business, banks are looking for fee-based income and expansion into allied financial services, such as insurance. Almost all public and private sector banks have taken up the bancassurance business and the commission income from the distribution of insurance products are significantly contributing to their profitability.

 Buoyed by this, banks are now pursuing to become insurers themselves and tap the large uninsured market in the country.

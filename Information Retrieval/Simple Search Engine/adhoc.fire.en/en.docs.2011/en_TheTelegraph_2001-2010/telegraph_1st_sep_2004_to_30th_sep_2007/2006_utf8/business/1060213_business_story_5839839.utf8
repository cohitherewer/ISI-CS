 Bill to thwart Mittal on fast track

 EDWARD SIMPKINS

 IRON GRIP

 London, Feb. 12: The government of Luxembourg will rush through a bill on takeovers which could protect Arcelor, the steel company that is the Grand Duchys largest employer, from the hostile 18.6-billion-euro (?12.7 billion) bid made at the end of January by Mittal Steel. 

 Last week Luc Frieden, Luxembourgs finance minister, said the bill adopted an amended version of a European Union takeover directive that will allow a besieged companys board to take drastic action to repel a hostile takeover without seeking prior consent from shareholders. 

 According to our draft law, the board can go ahead with actions to make an offer fail without asking prior consent from a general assembly, quot; Frieden said. 

 The new law raises the spectre of Arcelor creating a poison pill to deter Mittal Steel by issuing new shares or making a bid of its own for another company. 

 This means they could take drastic measures without consulting their shareholders, an executive close to Mittal said. Mittal Steel is majority-owned by Lakshmi Mittal, the London-based entrepreneur estimated to be the worlds third-richest man. 

 The EU directive is being adopted by countries across Europe and was due to be implemented in May. However, Luxembourg has decided to bring the bill forward and has chosen to opt out of key provisions designed to prevent the boards of companies from erecting bid defences that are not in the interests of shareholders. 

 The terms of the bill have yet to be finalised but it is thought that the new rules could also include a 95 per cent acceptance threshold before a bidder is allowed to compulsorily squeeze out minority shareholders. In the UK, the level is 90 per cent. 

 The Luxembourg government holds 5.6 per cent of Arcelor, meaning that it could potentially prevent Mittal from completing a takeover. 

 Frieden claimed the new law would apply to the Mittal bid for Arcelor, but said: This is neither an anti-Mittal nor pro-Arcelor rule. However, the Prime Minister of Luxembourg has said that he totally opposes the Mittal bid. 

 The French government, which is also opposed to Mittal, is believed to be working on an alternative proposal for Arcelor to buy Eramet, the French mining and metals group.

Arcelor is also thought to be considering buying US Steel as a means of putting itself beyond Mittals reach. 

However, the head of an influential French shareholder rights group warned Arcelor on Friday that it could face a shareholder revolt if it destroyed value in fending off the Mittal bid. 

 quot;I have been contacted by shareholders - French and foreign - who are worried that decisions could be taken which will not value their shares, quot; said Colette Neuville, the head of the Association de defence des actionnaires minoritaires. She told Reuters that Arcelor risked sanctions from shareholders. 

An Arcelor spokesman said: quot;Arcelor has said very clearly that it will run its defence in terms of value for shareholders, it will not make a defence that is not in the interests of shareholders. quot; ')+]

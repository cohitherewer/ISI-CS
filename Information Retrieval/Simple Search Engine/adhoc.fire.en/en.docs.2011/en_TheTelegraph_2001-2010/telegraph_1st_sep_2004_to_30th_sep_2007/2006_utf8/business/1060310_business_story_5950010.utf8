 Sterling Info buys 8% of Tata Tele

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 9: A day after it sold a 9.9 per cent stake to Singapores Temasek, Tata Teleservices Limited today offloaded another 8 per cent equity to Sterling Infotech promoted by C. Sivasankaran. 

 Though it could not be officially confirmed, Sterling Infotech is believed to have picked up the stake for an estimated sum of Rs 1,200 crore. 

 Temasek had picked up the 9.9 per cent stake in the closely held Tata Teleservices for about Rs 1,500 crore.

 With these two deals, Tata Teleservices has raised close to Rs 2,600 crore, which will be used to expand the network of the company.

 Tata Teleservices, which offers both fixed-line and mobile services, based on the code division multiple access (CDMA) technology, is planning to invest in 3G networks in the 20 telecom circles where it operates.

 According to sources, the company has no plans of offloading more equity in the near future.

 The market is rife with rumours that Tata Teleservices is planning to come out with an initial public offering (IPO), but the company spokesperson refused to comment on it.

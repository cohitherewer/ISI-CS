 Pressure on rupee mounts

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, May 30: The rupee today collapsed to a six-month low against the dollar, with rising crude prices and net outflows from foreign institutional investors (FIIs) acting as triggers. It lost 17 paise to end at 46.28 per dollar. The currency is likely to remain under pressure over the next few days, according to analysts.

 The Indian currency yesterday declined by over 20 paise to close at Rs 46.10 per dollar.

 The net outflow in FII investments has resulted in lower dollar supplies, pushing up the value of the greenback. Since the middle of this month, FIIs have been net sellers in equity markets. Since May 12, they have largely sold shares in the cash market. On Monday, their net outflow was $18.20 million.

 Moreover, banks have stepped up their dollar purchases for customary month-end considerations and custodian requirements. Lack of exporter dollar sales and an absence of intervention from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to arrest the slide added to rupee woes.

 After opening firm at 46.07 on the back of a dollar rebound, the rupee tumbled to multi-month lows of 46.30 on persistent hectic dollar buying by state-run banks for vital oil and defence-related imports. A broader strong global dollar also fuelled demand from foreign banks.

 The rupee came under a lot of pressure due to outflow from foreign investors. Further, as banks bought dollars to meet the month-end demand from companies, it lost ground, said Mehul Sanganee, senior analyst at Mecklai. 

 It is felt that the Indian currency will remain under pressure as long as investors are worried over the state of the stock market.

 According to JP Morgan, foreign funds have sold nearly $2.4 billion of equities since May 11, but cumulative calendar year-to-date net inflows are still up around $2.6 billion. JP Morgan expects the rupee to weaken to 47.5 per dollar by December.

 Even as importers fret over this sudden depreciation of the rupee, exporters should welcome the development. 

 In software services, more than 90 per cent of the revenues come from exports. IT analysts say any depreciation in the rupee value has a positive impact on the margins of software services companies. It is felt that if the current trend continues, biggies like Infosys may better the earnings forecast made for the current quarter.

 Sensex down

 After a firm start, the sensex failed to maintain the days higher levels and ended 67 points down at 10,786.63, snapping the three-day winning streak.

 The BSE 30-share index attempted short rallies, touching an intra-day high of 10,988.23, but heavy selling in some sectors pulled it sharply down at the fag end. It hit an intra-day low of 10722.92.

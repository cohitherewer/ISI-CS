The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Takeoff signal for Tata Bangla project

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 22: The Tata groups $2.5-billion investment proposals for Bangladesh is likely to kickstart this calendar year. 

 Indronil Sengupta, chief of Tatas Bangladesh project, told The Telegraph, We are making a revised offer on gas prices ... and the Bangla side has indicated they will take a holistic view.

 Our investment plans are on ... I expect the gas price issue to be resolved soon, said B. Muthuraman, managing director of Tata Steel Ltd.

 The Tata boss discussed the investment proposals with Begum Khaleda Zia, Prime Minister of Bangladesh, during a business conference here and is believed to have pushed forward the plan. 

 Sources said Zia may leverage the probable project benefits in Bangladesh which is going to the polls this year. The project is likely to create thousands of jobs, add almost 2 per cent to Bangladeshs gross national product (GNP) and turn the nations deficit in its balance of trade account into a positive one.

 The Tatas are investing in three projects ? a steel plant in Chittagong, a power project in Ishurdi or Beramara and a fertiliser plant at Bara Pukhuria. The Tatas exposure in these three projects is the single largest foreign investment in Bangladesh. 

 Bangladesh initially wanted to offer natural gas to the Tatas at international prices to operate the companys steel and fertiliser plants with the right to raise rates for every upward movement of the world price. The Tatas, however, bargained for a long-term contract at fixed prices.

 Sengupta said they too realise that a holistic view has to be taken, indicating that Bangladesh was willing to accept a long-term contract.

 However, Bangladesh finance minister M. Saifur Rahman said the negotiations could take months.

 The Bangladesh government is also studying a report prepared by the countrys Board of Investment (BoI) ? patterned on the lines of Indias FIPB ? that says the price of gas will determine whether Bangladesh will gain from the project and that there are no reasons to offer any tax-breaks or other incentives to the Tata group beyond what is given to other investors. 

 The Tata groups Bangladesh investment package has been hanging fire for more than a year, though an expression of intent has been signed with the government for a 2.4-million-tonne (mt) steel plant, a 1-mt urea plant and a 1,000-megawatt (mw) coal-fired power plant. 

 Tata sources said it would take another six to eight months to complete the negotiations.

 Several Indian industrial groups are keeping track of the negotiations as they may use the modalities of the agreement as a benchmark to gain access to the Bangladesh market. The Jindals want to set up a $800-million stainless steel plant in Bangladesh. Both investment proposals seem lucrative given cheaper energy prices in Bangladesh.

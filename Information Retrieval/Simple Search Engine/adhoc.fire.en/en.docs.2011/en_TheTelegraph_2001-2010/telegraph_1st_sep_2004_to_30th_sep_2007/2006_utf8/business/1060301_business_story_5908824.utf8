 FII limit in corporate bonds hiked

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Feb. 28: Companies planning to tap the market with bond issues will have one more class of buyers ? foreign institutional investors (FIIs). Finance minister P. Chidambaram has increased the limit on FII investment in corporate debt to $1.5 billion from $0.5 billion.

 With the FIIs investing heavily in the countrys equity markets over the past couple of years, companies can cash in on foreign funds as their investment limit in corporate debt has been raised. The measure comes at a time when banks ? a major source of funds for companies ? are facing tight liquidity conditions. 

 It will certainly widen the sources of funding for domestic firms. FIIs will like to invest in good corporate bonds, said S.P. Prabhu, head of fixed income and currency research at IDBI Capital.

 For companies, raising funds through bonds has become more expensive in recent times as interest rates are looking up. 

 Market circles said top-rated corporate debt papers are now offering higher interest rates than a year ago. The spread between a corporate bond and the government security of a similar maturity have gone up by 75-100 basis points from around a quarter percentage point a year back, thus reflecting the rising interest rates.

 For foreign investors, corporate bonds is not the only instrument where their investment limit has been hiked. In the Budget proposals, Chidambaram also raised the limit on FII investment in government securities from $1.75 billion to $2 billion.

 Bankers reacted positively to this proposal, saying that liquidity in the system would stand to increase by Rs 1,100 crore as a consequence of this move.

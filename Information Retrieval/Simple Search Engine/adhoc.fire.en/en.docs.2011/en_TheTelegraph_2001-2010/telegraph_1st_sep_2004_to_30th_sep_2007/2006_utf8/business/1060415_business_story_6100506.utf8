 Ford plans to down shutters at two units

 Detroit, April 14 (Reuters): Ford Motor Co said on Thursday it plans to shutter its St. Paul, Minnesota, and Norfolk, Virginia, assembly plants by 2008 as part of the automakers broader restructuring plan.

 The announcement affects over 4,300 people employed at both the plants.

 Fords restructuring plan, dubbed Way Forward, calls for closing 14 plants, including seven assembly plants, and slashing up to 30,000 blue-collar jobs. It is designed to reverse a $1.6-billion (?913 million) loss last year in the companys North American operations.

 Local United Auto Workers union officials had earlier said the plants were going to be closed.

 The Minnesota assembly plant, which employs 1,750 hourly and 135 salaried workers, builds Ranger compact pickup trucks, which have seen demand decline sharply in recent years.

 The Norfolk assembly plant, which has 2,433 employees, builds Fords best-selling F-150 pickup lorry, which is also assembled in Fords Dearborn, Michigan, and Kansas City, Missouri, facilities.

 Mark Fields, president of Fords Americas region, said the plants were chosen to be idled based on location, material logistics and operating costs.

 He told reporters and analysts on a conference call that despite the decision to idle the Virginia plant, the automaker would maintain its production capacity for the full-size pickup lorry.

 F-series capacity 

 We are reducing the number of plants, but we are not reducing the F-Series capacity, Fields said, adding that flexible manufacturing will help maintain capacity. Ford said it aims to sell more than 900,000 F-Series trucks this year for the third year in a row.

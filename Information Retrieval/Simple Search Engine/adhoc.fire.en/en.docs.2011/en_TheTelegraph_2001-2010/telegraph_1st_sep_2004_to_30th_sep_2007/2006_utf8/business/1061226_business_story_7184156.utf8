 Repo hikes fail to check inflation

 SRIKUMAR BONDYOPADHYAY

 Calcutta, Dec. 25: The broad money supply has grown by 20.2 per cent to Rs 30,29,376 crore as on December 8 on a year-on-year basis. This expansion and a 29.1 per cent growth in bank credit have propelled the rate of inflation to 5.4 per cent, forcing the Reserve Bank to change its stance on price control. 

 The RBI increased its key policy rates repo and reverse repo four times during the last 12 months, aggregating 100 basis points, to contain credit growth by making loans costlier. However, the rate hikes had little impact on credit growth as there was ample liquidity in the system. Bank credit grew by 31 per cent last year and by another 29.1 per cent so far this year. The RBIs target credit growth rate was 20 per cent for this year. 

 The hikes in repo and reverse repo rates backfired by increasing the real rate of interest for deposits in the banking system, which saw a massive increase in NRI deposits that ultimately led to an expansion of money supply in the country, said a banking sector analyst with a leading brokerage firm. 

 The total NRI deposits outstanding for 2005-06 was $2.789 billion. The figure shot up to $2.076 billion for the first six months (April to September) of this fiscal. 

 Aggregate deposits with banks in the country have also increased 22.4 per cent year-on-year so far. Interestingly, the growth in fixed deposits outpaced the growth in demand deposits (current and savings accounts). While the growth rate in demand deposits with banks slowed down to 23.6 per cent from 24.9 per cent, the growth rate in term deposits went up to 20.3 per cent from 16.6 per cent.

 A part of the higher growth rate in term deposits can be explained by some commercial banks, such as ICICI, Kotak Mahindra, ING Vysya and IDBI, hiking their short-term fixed deposit rates above 8 per cent, which is the interest rates on small savings schemes. 

 Besides, the RBI had to periodically intervene in the forex market to purchase dollars with rupees whenever there was an excessive inflow of the greenback as foreign direct or portfolio investments in the country, leading to an appreciation in the exchange value of rupee against the dollar, the analyst elaborated. 

 The money finally came into circulation resulting in further expansion of money supply, he added. All these led the RBI to increase the cash reserve ratio by 50 basis points to suck up Rs 13,500 crore straightway from the system.

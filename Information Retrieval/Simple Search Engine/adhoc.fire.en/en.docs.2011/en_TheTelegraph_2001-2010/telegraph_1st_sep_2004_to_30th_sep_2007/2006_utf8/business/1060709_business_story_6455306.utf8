 Calcutta, July 8: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) will soon come out with its guidelines on the proposed capital protected mutual funds.

 Speaking at an interactive session organised by the Merchants Chamber of Commerce here today, A.P. Kurian, chairman of the Association of Mutual Funds of India (Amfi), said, Sebi will bring out the guidelines within a month. Preparations are in the final stages.

 Amfi had discussed capital guaranteed mutual funds some time ago, but subsequently the name was modified to become capital protected fund.

 The protection of the capital invested in such a fund will not be supported by another capital. The product will rather be structured to ensure safety, Kurian said. 

 Suppose you gave me Rs 100. If I find a three-year or a five-year bond, which will give me Rs 100 on maturity, is selling at Rs 85 now, I will buy the bond at Rs 85 and thereby ensure that your capital investment is protected. I will get Rs 100 on its maturity. With the remaining Rs 15, I can buy other stocks, including equities. The equity component will deliver capital appreciation, he explained.

 Such a capital protected fund is bound to be a close-ended one, more like the fixed maturity plans the mutual funds are selling now, he said. 

 According to Kurian, certified property valuers will be appointed for the proposed real estate mutual funds and on the basis of the valuations by at least two such independent valuers, investment managers of real estate schemes will invest in properties. 

 We are working on the feasibility of making a panel of such independent and certified valuers for real estate mutual funds, he added.

 Welcoming the Sebi directive restraining the launch of similar schemes by mutual funds, Kurian said 54 equity schemes were launched between April 2005 and March 2006 mobilising over Rs 38,000 crore. This means a new fund was introduced every week, he said. 

 However, following the meltdown in the stock market, the total assets under management of the mutual funds have eroded by Rs 10,000 crore in June alone. According to the latest Amfi figure, the total AUM as on June 30 stood at Rs 2,65,534 crore. 

 Net outflow (read net redemption) from mutual fund schemes during the month was Rs 4,600 crore.

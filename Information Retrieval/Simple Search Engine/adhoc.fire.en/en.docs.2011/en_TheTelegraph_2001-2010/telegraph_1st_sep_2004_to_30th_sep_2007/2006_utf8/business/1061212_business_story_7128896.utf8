The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Curiosity intact in Corus battle

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Calcutta, Dec. 11: The competing offers on the Corus table has left everyone wondering about which side the board of the Anglo-Dutch steelmaker is really backing.

 Tata Steel claims that it still has the backing of the Corus board for its revised offer of 500p a share that was announced last night.

 CSN came up with a higher bid this morning and claimed it had won the recommendation of the Corus board.

 Tata Steel said the CSN offer was conditional in nature and would be effective only if the Indian company failed to get majority approval from Corus shareholders.

 According to the UK law, a company board can recommend only one offer to its shareholders.

 When contacted, a CSN spokesperson claimed that it had the backing of the Corus board and there was no recommendation for the Tata bid.

 A Corus spokesperson also pointed out that its board had recommended the Brazilian company in the interest of shareholders. 

 The development assumes significance because the Tatas have tended to avoid bidding wars or hostile acquistions. Instead, they have always strived to take the management of the target company into confidence.

 Tata Steel has kept the option open of going ahead with the bid without the support of the Corus board as reported in these columns yesterday.

 However, a legal expert in the UK pointed out that it may not be the end of road for Tata Steel as far as backing from Corus management was concerned. They can switch if the Tatas come back with a higher offer, said John Bennett, head of corporate law at London-based Berwin Leighton Paisner (BLP).

 The Tatas, however, would not only have to improve upon the 515-pence bid of CSN, but would also have to improve its funding of the Corus Engineering Steel Pension Scheme.

 CSN has offered to pay 138 million to meet the deficit of the scheme compared with the Tatas offer of 126 million.

 This is significant as a number of Corus pensioners are also its shareholders. The CSN offer portrays it as a bidder that cares for Corus pensioners even as it holds out the promise of a fairly good deal for the Corus top management.

 Corus chairman Jim Leng was offered vice-chairmanship of both Corus and Tata Steel; CSN has only invited him to join its board. CSN has promised Corus chief executive officer Philippe Varin that it will keep him for at least six months. The Tatas had offered him a two-year tenure.

 Moreover, while the Tatas only said the merger would provide significant value, CSN has put a number to the amalgamation. The Brazilian steelmaker said Corus would have incremental cash flow of $450 million up to 2009 due to low-cost iron ore supply. On top of that, the synergy benefits of CSN-Corus could be $300 million (on pre-tax basis) up to 2009.

 The Corus board has convened an extra-ordinary general meeting (EGM) on December 20. This meeting might provide some indication which side has the backing of shareholders.

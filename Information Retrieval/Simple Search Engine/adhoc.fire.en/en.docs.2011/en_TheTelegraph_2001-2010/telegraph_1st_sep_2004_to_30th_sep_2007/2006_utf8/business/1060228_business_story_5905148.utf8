 Trai for uniform cell tariffs

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 27: The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) today directed mobile service providers in Bengal, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh not to charge differential tariffs on calls terminating in the networks of BSNL and MTNL.

 It was noted that some of the private mobile operators in the four states had specified a higher tariff for calls terminating in the mobile networks of BSNL and MTNL from one service area to another falling within the geographical boundary of the same state, Trai said in a statement.

 Trai has given private operators 15 days to discontinue charging of differential tariffs in these states.

 All calls within the geographical boundaries of Bengal, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu are now treated as intra-circle calls even though they fall under different telecom circles.

 Calcutta, Chennai and Mumbai fall under metro circles, while the remaining states fall under different circles. Uttar Pradesh is divided into Uttar Pradesh (east) and Uttar Pradesh (west) telecom circles.

 Trai said it had received complaints from subscribers regarding the differential higher tariffs being levied by private mobile operators for calls terminating in BSNL or MTNL networks.

 We have examined this differential tariff in the light of the comments of the mobile operators and their representative association, it said.

 Q amp;A

 Pension poser

 I would like to subscribe to the new pension scheme. What are the conditions for contributions and benefits available? 

 Swapan Kumar Mandal, Howrah

 The new pension scheme is for central government employees who have joined the public services on or after January 1, 2004. Under the scheme, the monthly contribution of employees is fixed at 10 per cent of their basic salary and dearness allowance. The Centre makes a matching 10 per cent contribution. State government employees can also join the scheme provided the state concerned extends it to its employees through a notification. 

 However, members of the Employees Provident Fund, who are not government employees, can also opt for scheme, but the government wont contribute anything. 

 This is a defined contribution scheme vis--vis the defined benefits scheme earlier. There are no defined benefits. Money from the fund cannot be withdrawn before the member turns 60 or quits government service before that. Members will have to invest 40 per cent of the pension fund to buy annuity from a life insurance company. One can withdraw the remaining 60 per cent on maturity. 

 In principle

 Is the principal amount of an NSC or special tax-saving deposits of banks taxable on maturity?

 S. Datta, Calcutta

 As of now, only the accrued interest amount on these investments is taxable, the principal is not.

 By mistake

 By mistake, I have not shown one of my KVP for Rs 20,000 in my tax returns. It will mature in 2007. Now, how shall I legally explain when the matured amount (Rs 40,000) will be credited to my bank account? Shall I have to pay a fine? 

 Shikha Basu, Calcutta

 There is no problem if you had made the investment out of your total income in the year in which the investment was made. If it is not, there would be a problem and you will have to pay a tax and fine for not showing the income. So far as the investment and interest income from Kisan Vikas Patra are concerned, there is no tax relief available. You will have to pay a tax on the accrued interest when the investment matures next year.

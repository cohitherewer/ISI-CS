 Mukesh for faster legal reforms

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug 21: Mukesh Ambani, chairman of Reliance Industries Limited, today used the platform of industry chamber Assocham to call upon the government to hasten second generation reforms. 

 We must now move on to second generation reforms with legal reforms topping the list, Ambani said during the keynote address on the theme of Partnership between Business and Law. Ambani had last week credited late Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi with initiating liberalisation.

 Industry chambers have been demanding a fresh round of reforms focussing on easier labour laws, less red tape and opening up of sectors such as pension.

 Ambani said the legal system needs to be upgraded to make economy more competitive on the global platform. It is time for judicial reforms that would create an internationally competitive legal workforce which can work hand-in-hand with business houses to sustain and compete on an international platform, he said.

 Ambani feels the strengthening of the legal framework will enable lawyers to participate more effectively in the outsourcing business. This market for India is worth about $20 billion in the coming decade compared with just $61 million now.

 He said for businesses to flourish more attention should be given to quick delivery of justice and settlement of dispute. 

 Ambani also stressed the importance of cyberlaws given the emergence of virtual corporations, KPOs and BPOs. He suggested the limit of 20 partners in a law firm needs to be removed as with the growing complexities in business legal activities are diversifying and now include such work as legal research, contract drafting, litigation research and risk management, all of which require a battery of specialists. 

 The essence of legal and business partnership lies in using law as a creative tool to charter business solutions, Ambani said, making a strong point for a positive alliance between business and law.

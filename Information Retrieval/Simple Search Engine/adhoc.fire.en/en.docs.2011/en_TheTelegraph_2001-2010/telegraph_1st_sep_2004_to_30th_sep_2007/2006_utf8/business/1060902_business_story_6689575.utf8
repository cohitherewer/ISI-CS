 Asahi Tec to acquire Metaldyne

 Expansion mode

 Tokyo, Sept. 1 (Reuters): Japanese auto parts maker Asahi Tec Corp said on Friday it would buy unlisted US rival Metaldyne Corp in a deal worth $1.2 billion including its debt as it aims to expand overseas alongside Japanese car makers. 

 Shares in Asahi Tec, a producer of malleable iron casting products, shot up 22 per cent to end at 313 yen, adding 3.38 billion yen ($28.85 million) to its market capitalisation. 

 Asahi Tec, now valued at 18.87 billion yen, will pay Metaldynes shareholders $215 million in cash, most of which will be reinvested in the company. Asahi will also take over Metaldynes debt, bringing the value of the deal to $1.2 billion. 

 Financing will be arranged by Citigroup, JP Morgan and Deutsche, a source close to the deal said. 

 The deal marks the auto parts industrys latest attempt to consolidate as competition intensifies globally amid a rise in raw material costs and stepped-up demand for price reductions from auto makers. 

 Dozens of US parts makers have gone bust in recent years, including the countrys biggest, Delphi Corp also hit by legacy costs and output cuts at their main customers. The list of potential US assets on the market has grown lengthy with Delphi, Visteon Corp and ArvinMeritor Inc all aiming to shed part of their businesses. 

 Asahi Tec, owned 63 per cent by RHJ International, the holding company of US buyout firm Ripplewood Holdings, said the deal would strengthen its product portfolio and help beef up its global footprint given Metaldynes big presence in North America, Europe, China and Korea. 

 Most of Metaldynes business comes from the US Big Three General Motors Corp, Ford Motor Co and DaimlerChryslers Chrysler arm whose domestic sales have been sliding. In contrast, Japanese brands such as Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor Co are boosting their US market shares in a boon for many Japanese parts suppliers, which are scrambling to keep up with their clients expansion overseas. 

 Metaldyne, held 46 per cent by Connecticut-based private equity firm Heartland Industrial Partners, has annual sales of about $2 billion four times Asahi Tecs revenue in the year ended March 31 and a work force of more than 7,500. 

 Asahi Tec and Metaldyne will be better positioned in a market that continues to globalise, through expanded presence and higher value-added solutions for its customers, Metaldyne CEO Timothy Leuliette said in a statement.

 Lafarge plans to snap up US arm for $3 bn

 Lafont: Adding value

 Paris, Feb. 6 (Reuters): Frances Lafarge said on Monday that it planned a $3-billion cash offer to buy the 46.8 per cent it does not own in Lafarge North America Inc, in a move to streamline its operations and enhance its earnings.

 The worlds biggest cement maker intends to offer minority shareholders $75 in cash per Lafarge North America share, representing a 16.7 per cent premium over the stocks closing price on Friday, Lafarge said in a statement.

 The announcement pushed Lafarge shares 3.1 per cent higher to 89.20 euros, their highest intraday level in nearly 3-1/2 years. Analysts welcomed the move, saying it would simplify Lafarges structure and allow it to increase profits without the risks linked to a large acquisition.

 This deal uses up Lafarges immediate firepower in a way which is value-adding and very low risk, as it isnt buying anything not already consolidated, merely the minority, said Merrill Lynch analyst Ken Rumph.

 Rumph expects the deal to increase Lafarges 2006 and 2007 earnings by 7 per cent and 6 per cent respectively.

 The purchase, which will allow Lafarge to benefit fully from a pick-up in cement demand in North America, will be financed entirely through debt and is expected to boost earnings per share immediately, Lafarge said.

 This transaction makes strategic sense for Lafarge because it will enable us to pursue business and growth opportunities in North America even more effectively, newly appointed CEO Bruno Lafont said in the statement.

 It makes operational sense because it will streamline and accelerate decision-making, free of the complexity of operating through a partially owned, publicly traded subsidiary. And it makes financial sense, because it will enable us to improve the use of free cash flow at group level, he said.

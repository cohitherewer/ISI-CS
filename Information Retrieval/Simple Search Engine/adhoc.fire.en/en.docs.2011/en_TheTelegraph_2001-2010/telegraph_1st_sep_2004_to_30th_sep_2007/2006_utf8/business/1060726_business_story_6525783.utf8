 Split verdict on repo rate hike

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Makeover Move

 New Delhi, July 25: India Inc was today divided over the Reserve Banks decision to hike short-term lending rates, with many complaining it could impact the growth momentum.

 While Ficci and Assocham felt that increasing repo and reverse repo rates by 0.25 per cent could impede capital formation and economic growth, the Confederation of Indian Industry described the quarterly review as the most appropriate response to the current economic situation.

 The central bank has raised the short-term lending and borrowing rates by 25 basis points. As a result, the repo and reverse repo rates will go up to 7 and 6 per cents respectively.

 A hike in the short-term interest rates is inappropriate, said Saroj Kumar Poddar, president of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci).

 The chamber said the apex bank should have waited for at least a year before taking any decision on hiking the short-term interest rates.

 The economy is not overheated to the point. It is moving forward at a desirable pace. Perhaps this was not the correct time to hike the rates, Poddar said.

 CII president R. Seshasayee said though short-term floating rates of consumer credit are likely to go up and lead to temporary weakening of credit offtake, the hike in interest rates was unlikely to affect corporate borrowings and demand for long-term credit.

 Poddar was worried about small and medium enterprises (SMEs), which are dependent on the debt market.

 Large enterprises can tap the domestic market and even raise money from international markets. But where will the SMEs go, he said, adding that the move would make debt funds more expensive.

 Assocham also said the revision of short-term lending and borrowing rates would take a toll on the overall growth of the GDP of the country.

 Though the present GDP growth is led by a robust rise in investments, the cost of money would have its impact and pose a possible risk to the vibrant economic growth, the chamber said.

 The growth in industrial production continues to be at 10 per cent this fiscal.

 Both the CII and Assocham, however, agreed with the RBI estimate of a lower growth this fiscal compared with 8.4 per cent in 2005-06.

 The central bank has said it would also endeavour to ensure appropriate liquidity in the system to meet the legitimate credit requirements consistent with price and financial stability.

 Even though the hike in short-term lending rates was expected, bankers said it would have a direct impact on housing and auto loan rates.

 The hike is on expected lines. It will definitely bring some pressure on interest rates on deposits, said S.C. Gupta, chairman of Punjab National Bank.

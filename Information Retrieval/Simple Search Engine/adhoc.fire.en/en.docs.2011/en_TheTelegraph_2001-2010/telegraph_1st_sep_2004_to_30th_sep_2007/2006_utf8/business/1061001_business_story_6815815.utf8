 Shift in Nalco product mix

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, Sept. 30: Nalco may increase production of special grade alumina and zeolite A in the coming months while cutting down on calcined alumina, chairman C.R. Pradhan said after the companys 25th annual general meeting. 

 Fluctuations in global prices have made production of all types of alumina costly, he said. However, the actual production of different types will depend on the market conditions. 

 He said the company has already stopped selling its spot cargo of calcined alumina. Prices of calcined alumina have fallen to $282 per tonne this year from $633 last year. Nalco had produced 15,78,000 tonnes of calcined alumina last year, which was second only to alumina hydrate at 15,90,000 tonnes.

 The company is looking at offshore locations where cheap power will be available to set up smelter plants, Pradhan said. 

 According to the chairman, after the second phase of expansion, which is likely to be over in 2008, its refinery will produce more alumina than the country needs. Therefore, we are looking at locations where cheap power is available to turn alumina into metal. Setting up the smelter will depend on the cost advantage, Pradhan said. 

 The company is looking at Oman, Abu Dhabi and Qatar as possible destinations. We have also sent a team to Indonesia to look at the possibility of setting up a coal-based smelter there.

 The shareholders have approved the companys annual accounts for 2005-06, with a record net profit of Rs 1,562.60 crore.

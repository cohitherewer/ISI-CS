 Calcutta, July 14: The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India will soon redesign its courses by including international accounting standards such as IAS, IFRS and US GAAP.

 Increased globalisation, changing needs of industry and higher demand for chartered accountants from the industrial sector have necessitated a relook at our course structure, said ICAI central council member and project director Harinderjit Singh.

 More and more students are getting employment contracts from industrial houses during campus recruitment. Now, nine out of 10 students get employed in the industrial sector in stark contrast to the situation 2-3 years ago, Singh added.

 ICAI had started a campus recruitment initiative six years ago in line with premier management and engineering institutions of the country. This is yielding laurels too. The average salary during the last round of campus recruitment was Rs 6 lakh per annum. Starting salary went up to as high as Rs 16 lakh a year, Singh said.

 Most of the jobs secured during the campus recruitment are in BPO and KPO companies. This is proof enough that the outsourcing of accountancy and auditing services by developed countries to India in on the rise. This necessitates upgradation of ICAI courses to include international accounting standards, Singh said. 

 Singh, who is also the chairman of the Council for Members in Industry (CMII), said more and more students are joining the industrial sector and few are becoming practitioners. 

 The institute will come out with a white paper by the year-end to understand the requirements of industries regarding the skill set of chartered accountants in the changed environment of globalisation. With this we will be able to have an idea as to what needs to be done and can take action accordingly, Singh said.

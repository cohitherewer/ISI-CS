 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, June 27: Reliance Industries is on the prowl: it is looking for acquisitions at home and abroad.

 We will develop options for cross-border acquisitions in existing and new businesses, Mukesh Ambani told shareholders today, indicating that an acquisition even in the retail arena overseas could well be on the cards.

 Ever since RIL announced its foray into organised retailing, there has been growing speculation that the company will acquire a leading retail chain that also has sourcing operations in India.

 RIL had earlier acquired the German speciality polyester manufacturer Trevira. At the time of its acquisition, Trevira had a capacity of 130,000 tonnes per annum of polyester fibre and yarn, spread over four locations in Europe that included Bobingen and Guben (Germany), Silkeborg (Denmark) and Quevaucamps (Belgium). It also had a research and development facility at Bobingen.

 Within the country, some of RILs notable acquisitions include Indian Petrochemicals Corporation Ltd (IPCL), Nocil and SM Dyechem.

 Ambani said the Trevira acquisition has already brought significant benefits to Reliance. It gave the company an access to a huge intellectual property portfolio to build upon and its strength in technical fibres has also grown.

 The integration of the petrochemical operations of IPCL, Nocil and SM Dyechem with Reliance has enabled the company to successfully face competition from West Asian producers who enjoy highly subsidised feedstocks and other financial concessions.

 Cross-border acquisition forms only part of the three broad fronts that has opened before Reliance. Ambani said the company would forge new growth avenues in urban infrastructure and special economic zones and also set up new economy businesses in life sciences and healthcare.

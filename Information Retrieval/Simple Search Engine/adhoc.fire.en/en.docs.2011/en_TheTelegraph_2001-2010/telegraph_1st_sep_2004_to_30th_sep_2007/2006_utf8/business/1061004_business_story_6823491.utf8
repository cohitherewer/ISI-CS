 Gilead to acquire Myogen for $2.5 bn

 Boston, Oct. 3 (Reuters): Gilead Sciences Inc, the worlds third-biggest biotechnology company, has agreed to acquire Myogen Inc for $2.5 billion in a surprise transaction that gives Gilead access to Myogens experimental hypertension drugs. 

 The deal the latest in a flurry of acquisitions in the drug sector represents a big bet for Foster City, California-based Gilead, which mainly makes HIV drugs. The company has little experience in other diseases, and some analysts are surprised the company is straying so far from its core competence. 

 It is surprising in that there are no major synergies with Gileads current franchises, said Philip Nadeau, an analyst at Cowen amp; Co. Its a new area for them.

 Myogens shares rose 47 per cent, while Gileads shares fell more than 6 per cent. 

 Gilead agreed to pay $52.50 a share for Myogen, a 50 per cent premium over its closing stock price on Friday, to acquire the companys experimental drug ambrisentan for pulmonary arterial hypertension, a condition in which high blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs leads to shortness of breath, chest pain and, ultimately, heart failure. 

 You have to worry that this is a signal that Gilead thinks they didnt have enough runway in the HIV area in particular or in infectious diseases generally, said Geoffrey Porges, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein. 

 Gilead executives, on a conference call with analysts, said the hefty premium was justified by the scarcity of promising experimental drugs in late stages of development. 

 Myogen expects to file for marketing approval of ambrisentan with the US Food and Drug Administration before the end of the year. If approved, the drug could generate annual sales of more than $1 billion, analysts estimate. 

 Ambrisentan is one of a class of drugs known as endothelin receptor antagonists. Elevated levels of the peptide hormone endothelin are associated with several cardiovascular conditions including PAH, the firms said. 

 Myogen is racing against Encysive Pharmaceuticals Inc to produce a drug that would compete with Tracleer, an endothelin receptor antagonist made by Actelion.

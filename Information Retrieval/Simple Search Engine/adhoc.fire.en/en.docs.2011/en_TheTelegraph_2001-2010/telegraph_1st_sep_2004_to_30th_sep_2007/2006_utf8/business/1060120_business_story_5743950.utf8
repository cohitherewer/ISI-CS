The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Left voices concern

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan 19: Hours within the announcement of the takeover, the Jet-Air Sahara deal flew into an air pocket with the Left parties raising questions on the possible monopoly that the alliance will spawn and the source of funds for the acquisition.

 Jet is an airline reportedly worth Rs 2,500 crore. Its difficult to understand how it can raise Rs 2,300 through internal accruals or otherwise to buy out another airline. So questions arise on the source of funds, said CPM leader Nilotpal Basu. Questions arise whether the money will come from the initial public offering, which Jet had floated earlier, and whether that was mandated in the terms of the IPO. 

 The Left parties will seek a serious scrutiny of the deal and intend to take it up with the Congress-led government at the Centre.

 Basus colleague and RSP leader Abani Roy, who has already written to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh protesting the creation of such a monopoly in the aviation sector, said he would be writing to finance minister P. Chidambaram, seeking tax probes into the deal. 

 Basu said since the government had been unable to set up a monopoly commission as yet, the powers to challenge and check monopolies vested with it. The deal also highlighted the poor preparation of the government, he added. There is no regulator in place and we are witnessing a shakeout in the market, he said.

 Left MPs fear the new entity would be able to dictate price and corner most of the lucrative foreign routes that would be opened up. They consider the merger to be a threat to Air-India and Indian Airlines as the state-run duo will end up losers on all new routes when pitted against the power of the merged entity. 

 The real game is for foreign routes ... Air Saharas current routes to Singapore, Colombo, Chicago and London are just the tip of the iceberg. The award of new routes to the US, Europe and East Asia will depend on the market share here. We fear the new entity will corner the biggest slice and the most profitable ones, Roy said. Civil aviation ministry officials, however, said rules for the award of new routes were yet to be drawn up.

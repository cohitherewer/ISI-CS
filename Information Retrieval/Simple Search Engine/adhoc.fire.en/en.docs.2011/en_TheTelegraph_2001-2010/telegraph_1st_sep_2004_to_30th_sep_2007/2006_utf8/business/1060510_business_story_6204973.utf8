 Bharti to offer services in Jersey

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 9: Jersey Telenet Ltd, a subsidiary of Bharti Global, has been granted the licence to run telecom services, including 3G mobile and international long-distance services, in Jersey, the southern most island of the British Isles.

 The company will invest over ?20 million in setting up a state-of-the-art network that is expected to be operational from October. 

 The network and IT systems will be set up in partnership with Nokia and IBM. While Nokia will set up the telecom infrastructure, IBM will be the IT solutions provider. Expertise will be drawn from group firm Bharti Airtel, which is the largest mobile service provider in India.

 We are delighted at this opportunity to provide telecom services in Jersey. Having spearheaded the growth of the telecom sector in India, Bharti is committed to providing world-class telecom services in Jersey as well. The acquisition of the telecom licence in Jersey will be a springboard for other opportunities that may be present globally, said Sunil Bharti Mittal, chairman and group managing director of the Bharti group.

 This is the second international telecom venture of Bharti Global, an offshore investment firm of the Bharti group.

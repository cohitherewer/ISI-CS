 Left sniffs scam in airport update plan

 New Delhi, March 17: The CPI(M) today alleged a scam in the privatisation of Mumbai and Delhi airports and questioned the authority of the group of ministers to change the bidding criteria mid-way through the process.

 I smell a scam here, CPI(M) member Dipankar Mukherjee said initiating a short discussion in the Rajya Sabha on the procedure adopted by the government to restructure Mumbai and Delhi airports.

 Mukerjee said the empowered group of ministers (eGoM) was not authorised to alter the eligibility criteria for bidders after the bids were accepted. The eGoMs mandate was to finalise successful bidders.

 It would open a Pandoras box and we could see it happening in other contracts at all levels, he said.

 In the face of sharp attack from the Left, the government has asserted that no land will be allowed to be sold and interests of the workers of the Airports Authority of India (AAI) will be fully protected in the process.

 There is no land scam. The land will not be sold to anybody, civil aviation minister Praful Patel told members while replying to the discussion on modernisation of Delhi and Mumbai airports.

 He said the reason for initiating a private-public partnership in the modernisation of the two airports was to enable AAI to concentrate on modernisation of 126 other airports.

 Expressing dissatisfaction with Patels reply, the Left parties staged a walkout alleging that efforts were on to privatise the AAI.

 The members said bulk of the revenue of the AAI came from the two airports

 The AAI has cash reserves of Rs 3,000 crore. The privatisation of Mumbai and Delhi airports will adversely affect the revenues of AAI, which runs the smaller airports in the country.

 Mukherjee said by privatising Mumbai and Delhi airports and closing down airports in Hyderabad and Bangalore to make greenfield airports by private players viable, the government would be killing the source of revenue of AAI.

 While the winners of the contract have reserves of around Rs 65 crore, the AAI has total reserves of Rs 3,000 crore. This would have enabled AAI to raise loans of more than Rs 9,000 crore for the task, Mukherjee said.

 He argued that the task of modernising Delhi and Mumbai airports should have been given to AAI, as it was better equipped for the job.

 Taking exception to the head of the eGoM refusing to face Parliament, he said if the government was taking a stand that the minister dealing with the issue should answer the House, why did finance minister P. Chidambaram comment on the issue when he was abroad.

 Mukherjee pointed out that while successive governments have turned down the request of the AAI to modernise Delhi and Mumbai airports, it was surprising that the same task was being given to private players who would rely on government-owned financial institutions for loans.

 He was supported by JD(U) leader and former civil aviation minister Sharad Yadav who said corporate land sharks were eyeing huge plots at Delhi and Mumbai airports.

 Yadav said privatisation of important airports would make AAI, which has built 126 airports across the country in the last 50 years, unviable and it would become a burden on the country.

 A new airport should have come up in New Mumbai, Yadav said. He also questioned the modernisation of the Mumbai airport, when there was no space for building a new runway there to handle the increasing traffic.

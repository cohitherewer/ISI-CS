 Nath counters IMF remark

 Nath: Strong stand

 Singapore, Sept. 16 (PTI): Hitting back at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for suggesting that its special economic zone policy was a formula for revenue rip-offs, India today said there would be no loss due to such zones and asked the funding agency to first get its facts right.

 There was no justification in saying that there would be revenue loss, as it was notional. When there is no levy how can you say it could lead to revenue loss, commerce minister Kamal Nath said, reacting to IMF chief economist Raghuram Rajans remarks on Thursday at the ongoing annual World Bank-IMF meeting here.

 IMF should get its facts right. They should go to the field and not sit in Washington and criticise, he said.

 Special economic zones are a success, said Nath, a strong advocate of SEZs for boosting exports and manufacturing in the booming Indian economy that has been clocking over 8 per cent GDP growth making its success story a focus of discussion at the annual meeting.

 Opponents of SEZs, a policy initiative taken last year, have maintained that they would lead to revenue rip-offs and feared that ultimately industrial units elsewhere in the country would shift to sezs to avail of tax holidays.

 India has already approved over 160 SEZs and the empowered board is scheduled to meet in the third week of this month to clear 225 applications for more such zones.

 Rajan on Thursday asked India to very carefully look at the much-touted SEZs, saying the give-aways and tax sops to the zones could divert industrial activity from the rest of the country.

 Overall, it (tax sops for SEZs) becomes yet another give-away which the government cannot afford, the IMF chief economist had said. 

 Trade pacts

 India today set at rest the speculation that it preferred regional and bilateral trade agreements in the face of the stalled WTO talks, saying there can never be trade-offs between regional and multilateral pacts agreements, which would exist side-by-side. It cannot be either, or. There are no contradictions, Nath told a seminar at the annual World Bank-IMF meeting here.

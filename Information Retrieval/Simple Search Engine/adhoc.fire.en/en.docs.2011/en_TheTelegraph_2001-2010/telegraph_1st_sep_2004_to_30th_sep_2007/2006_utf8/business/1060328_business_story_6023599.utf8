 Sanofi in buy mode

 Paris, March 27 (Reuters): Sanofi-Aventis has bought a 24.9 per cent stake in Czech generic drugmaker Zentiva for 430 million euros ($514.7 million) to expand in eastern and central Europe, the French drugmaker said on Monday.

 The acquisition comes after Sanofi said last year it aimed to expand its Winthrop generic business, though it did not aspire to rank among top players like Israels Teva Pharmaceuticals or Novartis-owned Sandoz of Switzerland.

 Sanofi bought the stake from private-equity firm Warburg Pincus and managers and staff of Zentiva and will be the companys main shareholder, it said in a statement.

 Zentiva focuses on cardiovascular diseases, diseases in the central nervous system and gastrointestinal disorders. It is present in Romania, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, and is rapidly developing in Poland, Russia and the Baltic states.

 Sanofi shares had lost 0.7 per cent to 76.90 euros by 2.40 a.m. EST, while Zentiva shares were up 1.7 per cent at 1,329 crowns. The DJ European healthcare index was little changed, up 0.1 percent.

 The geographical reach is interesting, because it is still a developing market in which Zentiva has a very good position, Bank Sal Oppenheim analyst Peter Duellmann said.

 At some point in time it makes sense to be able to offer a bundling of products (combining branded and generic drugs) and to have a foot in the door to sell generic drugs, he said.

 Branded drugmakers are feeling the heat from generic rivals striving to sell cheaper copies of branded blockbuster drugs, even before their patents expire.

 Zentiva, which had its initial public offering in 2004, had a net profit last year of 65 million euros on sales of 410 million and has about 4200 staff. Its management will own about 5.9 per cent of the company following the transaction.

 The company makes and sells generic drugs, and its strategy is to grow its business internally as well as through acquisitions, Zentiva said in a statement on its Website.

 Competition panel sulks

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 21: The Competition Commission, set up in October 2003 after the promulgation of the Competition Act in January 2003, remains a watchdog that can neither bark nor bite. As a result, even after 15 years of economic liberalisation, companies indulge in anti-competitive practices, such as abuse of dominance, predatory pricing and formation of cartels. 

 As of now, the commission is not in a position to take cognisance of any complaint, said Competition Commission chairman (acting) Vinod Dhall while addressing a seminar on Competition Act: Related Issues organised by the Bengal National Chamber of Commerce amp; Industry.

 For instance, Coal India alleged that its explosive suppliers have formed a cartel to bid for its tenders and therefore, it was not getting fair prices. We have also noticed that teak wood merchants in Nagpur are doing the same thing. But we cant do anything, Dhall said.

 The commission could not do anything while the department of posts proposed to have the exclusive right to deliver mails weighing less than 300 gm and those weighing more could be handled by private couriers. 

 We advised the government that this was against competition, but it was not mandatory for them to listen to us. Rather, the government decided to amend the Indian postal act to accommodate this proposal, Dhall said.

 Till the commission is given enough power by amending the Companies Act 2002, the single-member panel has decided to create awareness about competition.

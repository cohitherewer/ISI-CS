 Sona Koyo project in North America

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 6: Sona Okegawa, a group company of Sona Koyo, plans to set up its first greenfield project in North America.

 This is Sona Okegawas first overseas project. A decision on it will be taken by March next year. We are conducting a feasibility study and are looking at a couple of locations at the moment, Surinder Kapur, group chairman and managing director of Sona Koyo, told The Telegraph.

 He said the company would make a one-time investment of $10 million by next year to set up the gear manufacturing facility. We expect the returns to be in the range of $25-30 million from the second or third year of the investment, said Kapur.

 Initially, the North American plant will have an annual capacity to manufacture five million pieces of precision forge gearings. This may undergo expansion, said Kapur.

 The North American automotive market is growing and we want to be a significant player in that space, he added.

 He said the company had been looking out for acquisitions in the region, but chose to set up its own unit when it couldnt find a right target.

 Regarding the funding of the project, Kapur said the group would be using a lot of its own resources and private equity investors were also willing to provide funds.

 Sona Okegawa, the company that clocked a Rs 150-crore turnover last fiscal, is eyeing Rs 450 crore over the next three years.

 The company is a 60:40 joint venture between Sona Group and Mitsubishi Materials Corporation of Japan.

 Meanwhile, Sona Koyo Steering, Indias largest steering gear manufacturer, will invest Rs 400 crore to ramp up its capacity across its four plants. The company enjoys a 45 per cent market share. 

 The company has two plants in Haryana and the remaining two are in Chennai.

 The investment will be made over the next two years. With this, by the end of the year, we will manufacture two million manual steering systems, half-a-million hydraulic power systems and a quarter million of electronic gears, he said. 

 Sona Koyo had acquired a 20 per cent stake in a French company called Fuji Autotec last year for approximately $6 million.

 OVL tight-lipped on Rosneft bid

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 12: ONGC-Videsh (OVL) was ambivalent about whether it was going to bid for a 5 per cent stake in Rosneft even as the IPO draws to a close in London this evening.

 Regarding the bid, a petroleum ministry official told The Telegraph, There is nothing, nothing at all.

 Petroleum secretary M.S. Srinivasan, however, said, It is in our zone of active consideration. Chances are pretty good that we will put in a bid. Srinivasan added that OVL still had two weeks to place the bid.

 To expand its overseas acquisitions, OVL is eyeing a 5 per cent stake in Rosneft, Russias third biggest oil firm, through its initial public offering.

 Earlier, Srinivasan said, We are in discussions to invest $3 billion through OVL in Rosneft. It would be for about a 4.5-5 per cent stake in the company.

 Other companies in the fray include British firm BP Plc and China National Petroleum Company (CNPC).

 However, OVL has also lined up investments to acquire new oil and gas assets in Africa and central Asian countries and these would turn out to be cheaper.

 It has to, therefore, be careful about the cost-benefit analysis as it does not have unlimited resources.

 With crude rates skyrocketing, the Rosneft stake comes at a high price. OVL also cannot muster the kind of resources that BP and CNPC have at their command.

 Rosneft plans to raise $11.6 billion from the IPO by selling 13-19 per cent of its stock.

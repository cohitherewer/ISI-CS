 Philips colour TV bounce-back in two years

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Provost: Big screen vision

 Berlin, Sept. 11: Philips has set a target of two years to make its presence felt in the consumer electronics business, especially colour television (CTV), in India.

 The brand and the company, well known to Indian consumers for years, is now in the sixth position in terms of CTV market share.

 Philips hopes that its newly launched Ambilight range of CTVs that comes with full back lighting will turn corners for the company in India.

 Rudy Provost, chief executive officer of Philips Consumer Electronics and member, board of management of Royal Philips Electronics, said it must do well in CTVs to become a successful consumer electronics company in India.

 It is absolutely necessary that we get it right in CTV in India. I have given (the India management) two years to do it, Provost told The Telegraph.

 Philips, with its new tagline sense and simplicity wants to play it simple in India. It wants to promote key brands to simplify the distribution channel.

 Provost said the company did not do well in India for various reasons but added that it was time to improve.

 To get a first-hand feel about the local market, Provost has recently made a two-day visit to Bangalore.

 The complexities of the Indian market needs to be assessed by the people there. But the key is in customisation and tailor-made offering for emerging markets like India, Provost said.

 Affordability was the key challenge in India, he said on the sidelines of the IFA, Berlin, one of the worlds largest consumer electronics fairs where Philips showcased a number of concept products.

 The company displayed a 100-inch LCD flat television with full surround backlighting at the fair.

 Even though it may take a while before the LCD television is retailed in India, the company will soon launch the full surround backlight technology in the country.

 Provost said emerging markets like India were throwing up opportunities in distant healthcare. Philips is leading a pilot project in healthcare called Disha.

 The company is carrying out two more pilot projects in India on innovative lighting technology Uday and Kiran.

 The lighting division contributes the most to the Philips bottomline in India even as consumer electronics goods records the highest sales.

 Of the Rs 2,800-crore turnover in 2005, consumer electronics contributed Rs 1,090 crore but ended up in losses.

 To get operational efficiency, the company has recently changed the contract manufacturer for CTV to cut cost.

Mobile handsets

 Philips will re-launch mobile handsets in India during this festive season. 

 The company has taken a complete outsourcing model for this business and will focus on low-end handsets.

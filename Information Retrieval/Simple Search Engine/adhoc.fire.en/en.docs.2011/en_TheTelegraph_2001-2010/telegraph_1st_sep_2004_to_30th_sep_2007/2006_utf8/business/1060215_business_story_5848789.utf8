 Firms look overseas to raise funds

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Feb. 14: Corporate India is not only shopping abroad for buyouts, but also going overseas to raise resources at a time when interest rates back home are hardening. 

 In most cases, these borrowing programmes are aimed at funding the ambitious growth plans that these companies have both in the domestic and overseas markets.

 Three companies ? Mahindra amp; Mahindra (M amp;M), Wockhardt and Matrix Laboratories ? today announced their overseas fund mobilisation plans. Late last week, pharmaceutical major Cipla indicated it is planning to raise around $200 million through global depository receipts (GDR) or a foreign currency convertible bond (FCCB) issue to fund its expansion plans, which may involve an international acquisition as well. 

 NTPC has also signed an agreement to raise up to $1 billion from overseas debt markets through a medium term note (MTN) programme. This follows its huge investment programme to become a 40,000-mw power generation company by 2012. 

 UTI Bank is also in the process of raising up to $1 billion through MTNs to fund its overseas expansion plan, including the establishment of a branch in Singapore. Pharmaceuticals company Dr Reddys is also seeking shareholder permission to increase its borrowing powers.

 M amp;M today told bourses that the directors approved a proposal to raise additional long-term resources up to $200 million (with a right to retain additional 15 per cent subscription) by the issue of FCCBs and/or other appropriate securities or other debt instruments in the international/domestic market in one or more tranches.

 The tractor and utility vehicle company added that these funds are being raised to finance its export initiatives and globalisation plans, potential acquisitions in the domestic and overseas markets, development and absorption of new technology, capital expenditure, new product development.

 M amp;M, is presently the fourth largest tractor manufacturer and it has laid out a gameplan of being the global leader over a period of five years. The company is also in the lookout for acquisitions in Europe, where it has bid for Romanias Tractorul Brasov.

 Its not M amp;M alone that is looking at a potential acquisition candidate in Europe. Wockhardt, which has already raised around $ 500 million through FCCBs, today revealed that it too plans to mobilise upto $ 500 million through issue of ``equity/equity linked securities . Wockhardt, it may be recalled, has been in seriously looking to acquire overseas pharmaceutical companies, particularly in Europe in its bid to be a global player.

 Interestingly, it is the pharmaceutical 

 sector that is among the forefront to raise funds. Reports 

 say that their mobilisation through depository receipts 

 and FCCBs have crossed the $ 1 billion mark during this 

 fiscal.

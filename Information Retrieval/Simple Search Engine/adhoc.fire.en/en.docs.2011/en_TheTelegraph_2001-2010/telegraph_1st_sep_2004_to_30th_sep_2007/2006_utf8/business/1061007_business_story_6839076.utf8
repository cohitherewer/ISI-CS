 FM roots for small investor

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Oct. 6: Union finance minister P. Chidambaram today asked the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) to devise a mechanism that would not only bring retail investors back to equity markets but also ensure the safety of their investments.

 Chidambaram said volatility in the capital markets and periodic scams should not scare away retail investors. The finance minister was speaking at the inaugural function of Sebi Bhavan here today.

 Without a capital market, there will only be savers. The capital market intermediates should turn savers into investors. Unless every saver is turned into an investor, we cannot reach the kind of growth that we need, and which is imperative for India, he said.

 In 2005-06, total household savings invested in shares and debentures rose to 4.9 per cent (3.6 per cent routed through mutual funds), up from the previous years 1.1 per cent.

 According to the finance minister, the task before Sebi is to enlarge the middle ground consisting of ordinary people and allay their fears about the stock markets. It should also take steps to dispel the irrational fears of a section of investors. Chidambaram expressed the need to groom a cadre of professionals for financial markets.

 However, the finance minister criticised some market intermediaries, who had not initiated moves to become self-regulatory organisations (SROs) despite Sebi regulations permitting such bodies. Calling for stricter disclosures by market intermediaries to SROs, Chidambaram said all market participants should be members of SROs.

 I think it will be desirable to mandate SROs for all kinds of market participants. A market participant should be registered by Sebi only if it is a member of an SRO, just as a broker is registered only if he is a member of a stock exchange. I think it is therefore important that Sebi addresses the issue of intermediaries and SROs, he added. He also criticised the reluctance of some bodies like the Association of Mutual Funds of India, which were hesitating to regulate themselves.

 Fuel retailers pricing freedom on slippery track

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Oil on the boil

 New Delhi, Aug. 8: The government appears to be caught between the devil and the deep sea on petroleum pricing.

 Oil minister Murli Deora said in Parliament today that public sector oil companies have the freedom to revise petrol and diesel prices on a monthly basis.

 However, oil companies are running from pillar to post to get the green signal to raise prices. 

 Weighed down by political considerations, the government is yet to give its approval to the proposal.

 Deora, however, said in his written reply today that the PSUs have not revised prices since the last hike on June 5. 

 The government has permitted autonomous adjustments in fuel prices by public sector oil marketing companies every month. The oil marketing companies have so far not effected any adjustments in prices since the last price increase, he said.

 The Cabinet on June 5 raised prices of petrol by Rs 4 a litre and diesel by Rs 2 and allowed public sector retailers to increase rates if the Indian basket of crude stays above $70 a barrel for a month.

 Officials said though the average price of crude in July was over $71, oil companies could not pass on the hike.

 In this month, the Indian basket averaged over $73 per barrel, officials said.

 Deora told the Rajya Sabha that international oil prices continue to be at a very high level. The current situation is unprecedented, he said adding that the burden was shared between the government, oil companies and the consumers.

 The government, however, did not increase the prices of PDS kerosene and domestic LPG for the benefit of the common man, the minister said.

 Deora said the government and the oil companies would absorb around 87.5 per cent of the additional burden of Rs 73,500 crore this year due to higher prices of crude, leaving consumers to bear just the balance 12.5 per cent of the burden.

 The government will issue oil bonds worth Rs 28,300 crore this fiscal to partially compensate the oil companies for the revenue loss in the sale of petrol, diesel, LPG and kerosene.

 To this end, the finance minister P. Chidambaram yesterday tabled supplementary grants for issue of Rs 14,150 crore of oil bonds.

 Global price rule firm

 World oil prices eased today, but held close to a recent record in London as a pipeline leak forced British major BP to shut the biggest oil field in the US and US authorities considered releasing strategic stockpiles.

 Brent North Sea crude for September delivery eased 43 cents to $77.86 per barrel in electronic trading, off its new all-time peak of $78.64 set yesterday.

 New Yorks main contract, light sweet crude for delivery in September, dropped 38 cents to $76.60 per barrel in electronic deals today before the official opening of the US market.

 The contract remained below its historic record of $78.40 per barrel reached in mid-July as violence escalated between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon.

 Crude futures, which are winning support from disruption to supplies in Nigeria, the ongoing Iranian nuclear energy crisis and strong demand, surged yesterday after BP announced the shutdown of its Prudhoe Bay oil field.

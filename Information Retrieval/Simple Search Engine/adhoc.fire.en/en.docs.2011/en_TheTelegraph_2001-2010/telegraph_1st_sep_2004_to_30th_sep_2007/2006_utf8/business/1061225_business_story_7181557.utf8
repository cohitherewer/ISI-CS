 The money makers

 Srikumar Bondyopadhyay takes stock of the assets that brought home the moolah, and did not, in 2006

 Each passing year makes the game of investment more complex and interesting. Some asset classes that are winners in one year turn into laggards the next. Year 2006 has been exceptional in this intriguing game all asset classes have yielded positive and handsome returns.

 Stock markets

 At the top of the heap is the stock market where quite a few counters created huge wealth for investors. Atlanta Ltd, a company engaged in construction, infrastructure and real estate development, made a public issue in September at a price of Rs 150 a share. The scrip is now trading at Rs 1,192.20, giving a return of 695 per cent in three months! 

 There are quite a few others that more than doubled investors money in six months. Tech Mahindras share has grown over 236 per cent since its public issue in August. Lesser-known companies like Sadbhav Engineering, Action Construction Equipment, BL Kashyap amp; Sons also more than doubled investors money.

 The 30-share BSE sensex itself gave a 43.3 per cent return. There are a couple of sensex stocks that yielded more than 100 per cent return from January till date. ACC and Grasim gave a return of 122.48 per cent and 101.95 per cent, respectively. Twelve other stocks on the sensex yielded a return between 50 and 95 per cent during the period.

 Old economy companies, particularly those in capital goods, engineering, real estate and infrastructure development, were the favourites in 2006.

 Mutual funds

 The equity schemes of mutual funds could not outperform the sensex return this year. Category-wise, the technology sector schemes of mutual funds gave the highest one-year return of 37.58 per cent, followed by index schemes with an average annual return of 35.26 per cent. 

 Equity-linked savings schemes performed rather poorly, managing a return of only 26.56 per cent, while diversified equity schemes gave a one-year return of 30.75 per cent.

 The current calendar year saw the launch of more than 20 mutual fund schemes. But only a handful gave a return of more than 20 per cent. Among the new schemes, HSBC Advantage India gave the highest return of 29.73 per cent. 

 Fixed income scheme

 Mutual funds seem to have performed well when compared with the one-year bank fixed deposits, which paid an interest rate of 6.5 per cent. Even the monthly income plans of mutual funds gave an 8.58 per cent return over the past 12 months. 

 However, following the Reserve Banks decision to hike commercial banks cash reserve ratio by 0.50 per cent to 5.5 per cent, banks have started increasing their fixed deposit rates. As of now, an 8 per cent rate of interest is available only on tax-saving fixed deposits that are for five years or more. 

 Bullion market

 Gold and silver followed close on the heels of stock markets in terms of returns this year. Beginning the year on a firm note, gold price zoomed to $730 an ounce (28.35 grams) in May from $512 in January. The price of the yellow metal, however, dropped to $621 an ounce on December 19 with the easing of crude prices, giving a return of slightly more than 20 per cent. 

 Silver prices during the same period went up by more than 45 per cent. Between January and May, the price of the precious metal rose from $9 per ounce to $15. Price of silver is now hovering above $13 an ounce, reflecting a return of 44.4 per cent. Investors in precious metals should note that silver has yielded a better return than gold for 13 straight years since 1993!

 Another precious metal, platinum, also recorded a 29.5 per cent return between January ($1,074 an ounce) and December ($1,390 an ounce) this year, reflecting a better return than gold. 

 In the commodity market, the prices of all base metals saw a spectacular return this year. 

 Real estate

 Outside the stock markets, it was in real estate that the high rollers were raking in the moolah. While investors in real estate stocks made money hand over fist, investors in properties saw their investment value go up between 20 and 50 per cent depending on location. 

 The estimates of property consultants and fund houses that have launched real estate funds suggest that property investments over the last 12 months have given an average return of between 30 and 35 per cent.

 Although banks raised home loan rates a number of times this year at the instance of the RBI, the home loan offtake has not come down, indicating that the demand is much more than supply of properties, both in residential and commercial segments. 

 However, the RBI has warned that the excess demand could include a speculative element that could create a bubble in the real estate market. 

 Easel money

 If you have an eye for art and paintings, the return from such investments can be favourably compared with those from any other fixed-income investment. According to auction house Osians Art Index, which is based on the average square inch price for 51 top artists in the country, art investment this year has yielded a 65.17 per cent return. Though there are many in the art fraternity who dont subscribe to the idea of average square inch rate as a yardstick to judge the price of art, Indian contemporary paintings are definitely attracting overseas buyers in droves. 

 The domestic art market has been growing by 35 per cent every year over the last three years to Rs 1,000 crore at present.

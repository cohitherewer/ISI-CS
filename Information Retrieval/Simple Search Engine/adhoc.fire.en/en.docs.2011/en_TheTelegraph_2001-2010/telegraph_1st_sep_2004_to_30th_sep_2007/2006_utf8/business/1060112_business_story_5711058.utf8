 Infosys profit vaults 30%

 OUR BUREAU

 Jan. 11: Riding on the outsourcing boom, Nasdaq-listed Infosys Technologies today reported a 30.58 per cent jump in third-quarter consolidated net profit at Rs 649 crore.

 On a stand-alone basis, the net profit stood at Rs 642 crore (Rs 496 crore)

 The Bangalore-based firm clocked revenues of Rs 2,532 crore, a year-on-year growth of 34.97 per cent, and lived up to analysts forecasts.

 Earnings per share before exceptional items increased to Rs 23.68 from Rs 18.50 in the corresponding previous quarter, an increase of 28 per cent.

 The software major and subsidiaries added 36 new clients during the quarter, managing director Nandan M. Nilekani told a news conference here.

 We have seen another quarter of steady growth, he said. Our initiatives in strategic alignment, capability building and operational excellence are all on track.

 The company and its subsidiaries employee strength, which stood at 49,422, including 46,484 software professionals, as on December 31, is all set to top 50,000 in the current quarter.

 Indias second-largest software exporter added 5,135 employees on a gross basis in the December quarter. We will add 3,400 people on a gross basis in the current quarter, said chief operating officer S. Gopalakrishnan.

 The company also marginally revised its guidance following continued volatility of the rupee, chief financial officer T.V. Mohandas Pai said. 

 The benefit of rupee depreciation on the operating margin was offset by the hedges at the non-operating level. Liquidity continues to be strong, Pai said.

 On the whole, if we were to leave out the impact caused by the volatility in the rupees value on the company, the results are good as there are no negative surprises, said an analyst with a foreign brokerage.

Progeon chief

 Amitabh Chaudhry is set to take over as Progeon managing director and chief executive officer from March 2.

 Chaudhry is now chief operating officer of the Infosys BPO and is expected to take over from managing director and CEO Akshaya Bhargava.

 Infosys chairman and chief mentor N.R. Narayana Murthy said: Amitabhs role has been seminal in building the operations and solutions team at Progeon and in managing its high growth.

 Chaudhry has been associated with the BPO since early 2003 and has been responsible for building industry-leading execution capabilities within Progeon.

 Hint of tighter monetary policy

 Mumbai, Jan. 23: Spooked by inflation, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has hinted at the possibility of a tighter monetary policy ahead of its third-quarter review meeting tomorrow.

 The central bank said the outlook for inflation remains uncertain in view of the possible second-round effects of the rise in international crude prices.

 In a document titled ?Macroeconomic and Monetary Developments: Third quarter review 2005-06?, the RBI said a number of central banks have tightened ?monetary policy during the recent months in order to contain inflation and inflationary expectations.?

 Such an observation has thrown up the possibility of the central bank raising interest rates in a pro-active manner to curb inflationary pressures.

 After recording continuous upward movements to record highs in August 2005, international crude oil prices moderated during November and December last year. But crude prices have again increased this month.

 According to RBI, there is limited spare global crude production capacity and the US oil production and refining industries are still to recover fully. Therefore, oil prices are likely to react sharply to any additional disruption of or damage to petroleum infrastructure. Accordingly, they are expected to remain firm in the near future.

 The RBI document, released a day before the third quarter review of the monetary policy, is keenly watched by bankers and bond market circles as it throws vital indications as to the policy measures that could be taken.

 However, there are many in the banking industry who continue to believe that the central bank is likely to maintain a status quo on key rates, including the bank rate, reverse repo and repo rates.

 Their conviction was strengthened by the RBI?s comment in the document where it had expressed satisfaction over the way in which inflation had been controlled in India.

 Hotels, SEZs on DLF menu

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, June 22: DLF Universal Ltd is now leveraging its expertise in developing residential, commercial and retail properties to a much broader scale. It has lined up ambitious plans to enter new verticals that include special economic zones (SEZ), hotels and urban infrastructure.

 While each of these ventures may go public over a period of time, the plan is to rope in different partners who have domain expertise even within a particular vertical.

 The plans, though in their embryonic stage, are aggressive. For instance, in hotels, sources close to DLF said the company has set sights on being the biggest hotelier in the country over the next decade.

 However, its role will be limited to that of a developer while operations will be looked after by the partner. The idea is to initially hold 74 per cent in the venture. This will later be scaled down to 51 per cent once the venture attains an inflexion point.

 Here a blitzkrieg of having 25,000 rooms cutting across various categories such as business hotels, resorts, service apartments and even budget hotels are on the cards. While a different partner may join hands with DLF in each of these segments, it is speculated that Hilton may be DLFs mate in setting up business hotels in the country.

 However, senior officials of the company refrained from making any comments on its future plans since they are now in a quiet period on account of its forthcoming initial public offering (IPO).

 In SEZ, DLF is pursuing three projects in Amritsar, Ambala and Gurgaon. Spread over 36,000 acres, the proposal for these three multi-product SEZs are now awaiting clearances from the state government even as a green signal has come from the Centre.

 DLF has also joined hands with $5-billion Laing Rourke, a construction handling company in a 50:50 joint venture to pursue various urban infrastructure projects in the country. Here too, the plan is to emerge among the top three construction companies in the country over the next five years.

 The trigger for this foray into urban infrastructure emerged from its failed attempt to participate in the modernisation of the Delhi airport as Changi Airport of Singapore pulled out from the consortium that also had the Bharti group as a partner.

 DLF and Laing Rourke have now set their sights on bagging a slice of the Delhi airport modernisation project which is being implemented by the GMR group. 

 While the Phase I of this project will be completed by March 2010, well before the Commonwealth Games, the joint venture is hopeful of bagging the civil work, which is likely to be sub-contracted by the GMR group.

 Sebi cracks whip on Kotak, Gammon

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Dec. 21: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has come down heavily on Kotak Securities and Gammon India in two separate orders passed today. 

 The regulator has imposed a penalty of Rs 10 lakh on Kotak Securities as it failed to collect proper upfront margins from its clients. 

 On the other hand, Sebi has barred Gammon India from divesting its holding in Gammon Infrastructure Projects for three years from the date of allotment of shares in the public issue of Gammon Infrastructure. 

 A statement by Kotak Securities said, We have received the order from Sebi. The observations in the order are based upon routine inspections for the time period of 2001-2003. We will examine the matter and take appropriate steps.

 According to the order passed by adjudicating officer D. Sura Reddy, Sebi had inspected the books of Kotak Securities for the period between April 2001 and March 2003. 

 Kotak had admitted the violation but said that the violation was in only 112 of the 1.89 lakh contracts executed during the period. 

 Kotak had repeatedly defaulted on maintaining proper margin requirements. Also, there are repetitive instances of incomplete client registration forms. 

 In view of this, I hold that the noticee is guilty of committing defaults repetitively, Reddy said in the order. 

 Other documentation errors observed by Sebi in the order were the absence of witness signature in the client account opening form and the requirement of bankers certificate. 

 However, this applied to the period of 2001-03 and the regulator has since dispensed the requirement. 

 In the order passed by Sebi wholetime member G. Anantharaman on Gammon, the market regulator has also barred Gammon chairman Abhijit Rajan and his other companies Nikhita Estate Developers and Devyani Estate amp; Properties from divesting their stake in Gammon Infrastructure for three years. 

 Gammon India, along with Reliance Silicones India and the above mentioned entities have further been prohibited from accessing the capital market directly or indirectly for a year. 

 The regulator had received a complaint from Reliance Silicones alleging irregularities in the rights issue of Gammon India in 2001. 

 It also alleged that funds of Gammon were used for subscription to the rights issue, including non disclosure of a financial agreement between Reliance Silicones and Gammon in the annual accounts of Gammon, which resulted in understatement of loss, unauthorised use of banking account, overstatement of assets with respect to its wholly owned subsidiary Nouveau Exports.

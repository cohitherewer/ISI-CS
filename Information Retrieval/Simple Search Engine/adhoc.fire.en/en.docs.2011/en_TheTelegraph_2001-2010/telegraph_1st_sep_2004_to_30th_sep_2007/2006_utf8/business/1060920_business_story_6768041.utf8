 New Delhi, Sept. 19: The Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) is the frontrunner in around 25 of the 45 oil and gas exploration blocks it had bid for under the sixth round of the new exploration licensing policy (Nelp VI).

 ONGC chairman R.S. Sharma today said, Although the final outcome will be declared later, according to current indications, ONGC expects to get over 50 per cent of the blocks it has bid for under Nelp VI.

 Sharma also said ONGC would issue bonus shares in November in the ratio of 1:2. This was approved at the companys annual general meeting here today.

 After the bonus issue, ONGCs equity capital would increase to Rs 2,139 crore from Rs 1,426 crore at present. This is the first time ever that ONGC has issued bonus shares.

 Sharma said ONGC would maintain its position as the countrys leading exploration and production (E amp;P) company. It had bagged 89 of the 109 blocks offered in the five earlier Nelp rounds, he added.

 The government received 165 bids under the Nelp VI round. As many as 39 blocks received multiple bids while there were single bids for only 13. Four blocks, including one in the Andamans, did not have any takers. So, in effect, ONGC is poised to get half of the total number of blocks in the current round.

 Sharma said ONGC-Videsh (OVL) was also in talks for oil and gas assets in Kazakhstan and South America. He hinted that OVL was close to striking a deal in these two regions, but could not disclose details because of confidentiality clauses attached to the negotiations.

 He said ONGC would pursue overseas acquisitions both through ONGC-Videsh and in partnership with the LN Mittal group through ONGC-Mittal Energy Ltd. The two deals struck with Nigeria by ONGC-Mittal Energy held a lot of potential, he added.

 Similarly, the Cuban and Brazilian assets in which OVL would participate were also big deals that would increase the overseas presence of the Indian company.

 He said ONGC would import the first cargo of crude from the Sakhalin field in Russia in the second week of November. The first parcel of 90,000 tonnes will be processed at our subsidiary MRPL, Sharma said.

 OVL, the overseas arm of ONGC, has a 20 per cent stake in the offshore Sakhalin-1 field in Russia.

 Sharma said the low prices that ONGC gets for its natural gas and the huge compensation that it has to pay to Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum for losses on LPG and kerosene were areas of concern.

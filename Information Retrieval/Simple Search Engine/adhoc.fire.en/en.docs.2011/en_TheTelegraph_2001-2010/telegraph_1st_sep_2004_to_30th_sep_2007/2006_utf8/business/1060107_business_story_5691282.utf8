 Airport update to be hastened

 New Delhi, Jan. 6 (PTI): The members of a parliamentary committee today asked the government to speed up the modernisation of Delhi and Mumbai airports without further delay, even as the civil aviation ministry announced the appointment of a task force, lead arrangers and consultants for the development of 35 non-metro airports in a phased manner at a cost of Rs 5,500 crore.

 Participating in a meeting of the consultative committee on civil aviation, chaired by minister Praful Patel, the MPs pointed out that the process had been given a go-ahead by Parliament and should thus be given utmost priority, an official spokesperson said.

 Regarding the 35 non-metro airports identified by the Airports Authority of India (AAI), the members were informed that a task force has been constituted under the chairmanship of a Planning Commission member for finalisation of the financial model. The report of the task force is expected this month, the spokesperson said.

 The MPs expressed concern over issues relating to the safety and security, including the use of the instrument landing system during foggy conditions, besides slow pace of infrastructure development and shortage of trained personnel, especially the air traffic controllers.

 In a presentation by the AAI, the MPs were informed about the thrust areas of development, including friendly airport terminals, passenger comforts, enhancement of air space and capacity and upgradation of navigation and air traffic management systems. 

 The presentation also showed that the increase in air traffic was reflected in the 12 per cent surge in aircraft movements, 21.5 per cent increase in passenger traffic and 20 per cent in cargo.

 In order to encourage airlines to use airports other than the six busy metro airports, the ministry has slashed the existing parking charges for all operators at AAI airports by 50 per cent from January 1, the spokesperson said.

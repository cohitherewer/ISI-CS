The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Small growth shift, big share gain 

 New records were set by both the BSE sensex and the Dow Jones Industrial Average last week, as investors took heart from falling oil prices, good corporate results and the topping out of interest rates. Markets across the world have rallied, with Singapore and Mexico keeping us company in setting new highs.

 Have emerging markets always rallied when the US Fed stops raising interest rates? Not really. In 2000, for instance, the Fed started to reduce the Fed Funds rate, which went down from an effective rate of 6.54 per cent in July 2000 to a low of 1.01 per cent in July 2003. That couldnt stop the Dow Jones Industrial Average from falling from a high of 11600 in February 2000 to a low of 7181 in October 2002. In India, in spite of the continuous fall in interest rates during the period, the sensex fell from a high of 6150 in February 2000 to a low of 2828 in October 2002. Emerging markets all over the globe fell in tandem.

 The experience was very different in the mid-nineties. At that time, the Fed Funds rate had fallen from an effective rate of 6.05 per cent in April 1995 to 5.22 per cent by April 1996. That led not only to a sharp rally in the Dow, but the IFCI index of emerging markets also rose in 1996 on the back of low international interest rates. Portfolio flows to emerging markets picked up after two years of no growth.

 The reason for the difference between 2000 and 1995 was simple: US GDP growth fell precipitously after 2000, while the fall was much less steep in 1995 and it bounced back smartly in 1996. What the market is expecting now is a 1995 rather than a 2000 scenario. In other words, the markets are expecting that growth in the world economy will slow, but not too much; and growth should not pick up so much that inflation pressures and interest rates start rising. The economy should be not-too-hot, not-too-cold, as in the Goldilocks story.

 The Indian market, however, had a pretty dismal 1995, falling by around 20 per cent that year. Domestic interest rates had already started moving up and the numerous scams during the period had affected the market. Other emerging markets like Korea, Thailand, and South Africa also suffered heavy losses in 1995, with their IFCI indexes falling 39 per cent, 38 per cent, and 19 per cent respectively for the year in reaction to domestic economic problems. In other words, not all emerging markets reacted in the same way to the easing by the US Fed in 1995.

 For India, however, 2006 is very different from the mid-nineties. The economy is vastly stronger, interest rates are not so high, theres a huge war chest of forex reserves, corporate balance sheets are much better and the world has bought the India story. No wonder it is outperforming other emerging markets this year.

 More importantly for all emerging markets, the US is no longer the primary driver of global growth. A study by CIBC World Markets points out that while the US accounted for 15 per cent of global growth in 2004-06, China accounted for 30 per cent. It predicts that despite a marked deceleration in US global GDP growth to a little over 2 per cent next year, global economic growth will continue at a robust 4.5 per cent pace. Thats just right for Goldilocks.

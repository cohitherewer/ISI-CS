 Videocon to close Daewoo deal by Dec

 Seoul, Sept. 12 (Reuters): South Korean appliance maker Daewoo Electronics expects to finalise its sale to a consortium led by Indias Videocon Industries by the end of December, the company said on Tuesday.

 More details of the deal will be released once a memorandum of understanding is signed by the end of September, Daewoo said in a statement. Videocon and RHJ International, the holding company of US buyout fund Ripplewood, were picked on Friday as the preferred bidder to buy Daewoo Electronics.

 According to reports from Seoul, the consortium is 50.1 per cent owned by Videocon and the rest is with Ripplewood.

 Officials from Daewoos creditor banks have declined to reveal the bid price, but a South Korean newspaper said the Videocon consortium offered 670 billion to 680 billion won ($699.7 million-$710.2 million).

Videocon chairman Venugopal Dhoot declined to comment, 

citing a non-disclosure agreement.

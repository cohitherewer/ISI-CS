 Mysore, July 31: At 7 pm (9.30 am Eastern Standard time in New York), Nasdaqs opening bell was rung by Infosys board members from a specially erected podium at its Mysore facility. This is the third time that the opening bell was sounded outside the US.

 Normally, it is done from a television studio on Times Square, New York. 

 Nasdaq president and CEO Robert Greifeld said he was honoured to share the occasion with Infosys, the first Indian company to be listed on Nasdaq, on its silver jubilee. 

 Meanwhile, Infosys is keen to increase the headcount of its non-Indian employees to become a more multi-cultural, multi-ethnic entity and a truly global company.

 The Nasdaq-listed firm today announced the arrival of 126 new recruits from universities in the US as the first batch of the Infosys Global Talent Programme (GTP).

 These new hires, the largest group of foreign nationals recruited to work in India to date, begin their six-month, customised education programme at the Infosys Global Education Centre ? a place where all Infosys recruits undergo a 16-week GTP before their induction into the company.

 Infosys plans to invest Rs 809 crore ($176 million) on expanding the centre in the next one year, officials said. 

 Over the next one year, the firm planned to set up a new 9,000-seat training facility here, which would enable training of 13,500 individuals in a single sitting, they said.

 These new hires are the largest group of foreign nationals recruited to work in Infosys. Through this training programme, we will be able to leverage talent, chief mentor N.R. Narayana Murthy said.

 Policy advice

 Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia has asked Infosys to provide feedback to the central and state governments on policy matters to promote the industry.

 Speaking to reporters after inaugurating a software development block of the Nasdaq-listed firm here, Ahluwalia said he would look to Infosys to provide enough feedback to the planning mechanism not just in the central government but also state governments.

 Bitter pill for the dragon

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Heavy dose

 Mumbai, Sept. 14: China has been slugging India in every field but information technology; but theres another sector where India is scoring over the dragon nation: pharmaceuticals.

 One measure of this is the number of filings in the US, the worlds largest market for drugs. India accounts for 43 per cent of all drug master files (DMFs) and one of every four abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs) with the US Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) with China trailing far behind.

 Its not just in DMFs that India is shining. There are other frontiers where it has scored over China. While there are well over 100 USA FDA plants in India, the past couple of years has seen drug companies like Dr Reddys Laboratories, Ranbaxy Laboratories and others making big-ticket acquisitions and having footprints in the US and Europe. The same cannot be said of the counterparts from China. The countrys share of DMFs filed with US FDA is less than half of India.

 According to Brian Tempest, chief mentor and executive vice-chairman, Ranbaxy Laboratories, it could take China around five years to close this gap. But by this time, India would have further consolidated its position. Tempest was speaking at the CII Pharma Summit 2006: India Pharma Inc Competing Globally here today.

 A DMF is a submission to the FDA that may be used to provide confidential detailed information about facilities, processes, or articles (active pharmaceutical ingredients) used in the manufacturing, processing, packaging, and storing of drugs. On the other hand, ANDA contains data which when submitted to FDA, provides for the review and ultimate approval of a generic drug product. Once approved, an applicant may manufacture and market the generic drug product.

 Drugs worth $40 billion are expected to lose their patent protection in the next three years and it is expected that such a scenario will work in favour of Indian companies as there will be more outsourcing by innovators and generic players to arrest falling profitability. 

 Revealing the DMF filings from India so far during this year, Tempest said it was not only in bulk drugs that India is far ahead of China. Even in formulations or finished products, it was much bigger than the dragon. This has been due to a variety of significant advantages that the country has in productivity and its superiority in chemistry.

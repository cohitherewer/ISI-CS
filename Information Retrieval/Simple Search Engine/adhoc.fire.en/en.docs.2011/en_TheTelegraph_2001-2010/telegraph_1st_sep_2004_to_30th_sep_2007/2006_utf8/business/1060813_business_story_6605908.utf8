 Participatory notes in for overhaul

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Damodaran: Looking back

 Hyderabad, Aug. 12: The Securities and Exchange Board of India is planning to revisit the guidelines on investments through participatory notes (PN) to ensure an orderly flow of foreign portfolio funds into the stock markets.

 Sebi is in the process of working out a new set of norms for participatory notes, chairman M. Damodaran said here today. He, however, did not give any time schedule by when the revised guidelines would be put out by the market regulator. 

 We are looking at the different stages of reporting that are needed for investments through this route, Damodaran said while responding to concerns that PNs could be utilised for insider trading and routing unaccounted money into the market by overseas investors. 

 The Sebi chief was in the city to participate in a conference on corporate governance in emerging markets organised by the Indian School of Business.

 Participatory notes are derivative instruments similar to contract notes issued by registered FIIs in India to their overseas clients who are not eligible to invest directly in the Indian capital market.

 Foreign institutional investors issue participatory notes to investors abroad with the details of scrips that can be bought and expected returns over specific periods of time. If the client agrees, they deposit the funds with the overseas branch of the FII. 

 Then, the Indian arm of the FII proceeds with the transaction, buying the scrips in the Indian market and settling it on its own account. 

 At present, FIIs have to declare the details as and when called up by Sebi. This means the identity of these investors is by and large unknown to the general public most of the time.

 We are considering a system under which FIIs will be asked to periodically declare their PN route investments in the Indian market, Damodaran said.

 We are revisiting the guidelines and there will be a process of consultation before finalising the norms that will be consistent with the markets, shareholders and the regulatory system, the Sebi chief said.

 PNs, according to market observers, have emerged as the most favourite route for overseas investments through FIIs who have pumped in billions of dollars into the Indian markets.

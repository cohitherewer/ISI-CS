 Small towns to fuel retail growth

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, May 26: The growth of retail business in eastern India hinges on the development of small towns. A recent report indicates that by 2010, retail business in the region will touch Rs 10,000 crore.

 The region is expected to have 100 shopping and leisure centres by 2010 with over 20 million sq ft of developed space, according to the report compiled by Images Retail and the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII).

 The investment needed to develop the retail industry is estimated at Rs 4,500 crore.

 The survey has pointed out the scope for the development of another 10 hypermarkets, 75 department stores and 150 supermarkets and over 1,000 new outlets in the next three years. But the number might increase depending on the thrust provided by the Tier II towns, said an official of Images Retail.

 Over 5 million sq ft is under development and another 10 million sq ft is in planning stage.

 The most potent sector for retail development, according to the study, is apparel.

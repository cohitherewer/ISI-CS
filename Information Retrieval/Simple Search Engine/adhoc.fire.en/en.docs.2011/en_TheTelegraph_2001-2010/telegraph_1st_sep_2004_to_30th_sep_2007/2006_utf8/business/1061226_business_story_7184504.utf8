 Alcatel focus on India

 New Delhi, Dec. 25 (PTI): French telecom firm Alcatel, which has recently acquired Lucent, will invest $200 million (about Rs 1,000 crore) in India every year over the next few years.

 Till now, we have invested more than 1 billion euros (close to Rs 6,000 crore) and are still continuing. Our further investments are to the tune of $200 million every year in various activities, including R amp;D, Alcatel-Lucent country-head Ravi Sharma said.

 Alcatel, which has a manufacturing tie-up with state-run ITI, has already made two plants at Mankapur and Rai Bareily operational, he said. More plants would be functional for manufacturing ADSL, an equipment used to offer broadband services, he added. With the acquisition of Lucent, the French telecom giant now has a reach in the emerging CDMA technology.

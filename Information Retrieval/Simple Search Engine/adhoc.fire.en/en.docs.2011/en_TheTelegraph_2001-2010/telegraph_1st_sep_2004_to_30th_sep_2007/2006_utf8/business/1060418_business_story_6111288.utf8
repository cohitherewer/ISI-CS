 Buzz on telecom shakeup 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 17: Falling prices and lower margins will endanger the survival of some of the weaker players in the Indian telecom market, forcing them to enter into strategic tieups with stronger service providers, a study carried out by Icra says.

 Greater competition would lead to lower prices for consumers, which, in turn, will stimulate market demand, thus exerting a downward pressure on costs because of the economies of scale. However, weaker players would then be forced to enter into strategic alliances or divest equity in favour of stronger players, said the study.

 The study said despite continued high subscriber growth, the possibility of lower revenue growth, lower profitability and continuing accumulated losses could inhibit the flow of large long-term financial investments into the industry.

 A slower growth in revenues and increased network investments to meet higher demand would mean that most of the operators would not be able to wipe out their accumulated losses soon, it pointed out.

 Trai figures have shown that the pace of mobile penetration in India has caught up with China, and India is adding about 4 to 5 million mobile subscribers per month in the last few months.

 Indias tele-density in December 2005 reached 11.43 per cent with the subscriber base touching the 124-million-mark. During December 2005, record 4.92 million subscribers were added against 3.8 million subscribers in November 2005.

 The national average revenue per user (ARPU) for GSM operators has declined by 2.6 per cent between June and September 2005. All India Arpu for the quarter ended September 2005 was Rs 374, a decline of 2.6 per cent from Rs 381 for June 2005. In fact, the Trai analysis shows that Arpu has actually declined by 4 per cent since September 2004.

 For CDMA services, Arpu per month for the quarter ended September 2005 was Rs 244. All India monthly Arpu for post-paid at Rs 444 was around 2.29 times that of prepaid Arpu of Rs 194.

 Icra said lower Arpus will endanger the survival of weaker players.

 Cellular networks account for more than 87 per cent of all incremental telephone connections. The cellular subscription growth during the next few years is expected to be driven by low penetration of cellular telephones, reduced equipment costs, wider network rollout, increased utility, increased competition and reduced prices, the Icra study said.

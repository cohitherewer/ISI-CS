 China growth seen at 9.5% in 2007

 Power play

 Shanghai/Beijing, Dec. 26 (Reuters): Chinas economy is expected to maintain robust, relatively inflation-free growth next year, a state think-tank and central bank officials said.

 The economy would probably grow by around 9.5 per cent in 2007 as anticipated rises in domestic consumption offset slowing fixed-asset investment and foreign trade, the State Information Centre said in a report.

 The body, which is part of the National Development and Reform Commission, the top economic planning agency, said it expected gross domestic product to grow within a range of 8.5 per cent to 10.5 per cent next year.

 If the economy maintains a steady but fast growth, GDP growth should be at about 9.5 per cent, said the report published in the Shanghai Securities News.

 The economy is on track to record its fourth straight year of double-digit growth in 2006, but many economists expect it to slow modestly in 2007.

 Separately, assistant central bank governor Yi Gang told a forum that he expected consumer inflation to remain steady at within 3 per cent next year, as a good grain harvest this year meant pressure on food prices would be limited.

 Annual consumer price inflation has remained at below 2 per cent all of this year, but it jumped to 1.9 per cent in November from 1.4 per cent in October largely because of rapid growth in food prices.

 Tang Xu, head of the Peoples Bank of Chinas research department, told the same forum that recent price rises for agricultural products were of no large concern and could actually be beneficial to farmers. It will probably be a short-lived phenomenon. We will keep an eye on that. But its unlikely the central bank will take any measures, he said, adding that he expected CPI inflation to stay at around 2 per cent next year.

 Jindal Vijay to join TN mining

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, Aug. 23: Jindal Vijayanagar Steel may join the Tamil Nadu Industrial Development Corporation (TIDCO) in its Rs 400-crore project for iron ore mining in Tamil Nadu. 

 Certain parts of Salem and Tirunvannamalai district in the state have low-grade iron ore deposits of 110 million tonnes. Jindal Steel Limited has signed a promoters agreement with TIDCO for this project, chief minister M. Karunanidhi announced in the state Assembly today. 

 The beneficiated and palletised iron ore from this project will be used as raw material for another steel making project in the vicinity, Karunanidhi said. 

 A new escort sector company called Tamil Nadu Iron Ore Mining Corporation Limited has been formed for the mining project, he said. TIDCO will hold less than 10 per cent in the company. 

 Automobile companies such as Ford, Hyundai, Mitsubishi and BMW have set up their manufacturing facilities in Chennai, which has boosted the auto-components industry in the Sriperumbudur-Oragadam belt near Chennai in a big way. 

 To meet the growing infrastructure needs in the area, the SIPCOT industrial park at Oragadam will be upgraded as an automotive special economic zone, Karunanidhi said, replying to the debate on the demands for grants for the industries department in the Assembly today. 

 To expand the existing industrial park in the Sriperumbudur-Oragadam belt in neighbouring Kancheepuram district, the government plans to acquire another 2000 acres, he added. 

 A Rs-650-crore expansion project for Tamil Nadu News Prints Limited (TNPL), the first plant in the world to make paper from bagasse, and a special leather economic zone near Chennai were among the projects on the cards, Karunanidhi said.

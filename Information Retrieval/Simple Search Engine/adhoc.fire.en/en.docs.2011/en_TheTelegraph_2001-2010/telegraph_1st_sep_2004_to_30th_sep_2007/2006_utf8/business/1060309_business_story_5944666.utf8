 Vodafone axes veteran

 Bamford: Shown the door

 London, March 8 (Reuters): Britains Vodafone Group Plc, dogged by rumours of serious boardroom rifts, axed its marketing chief on Wednesday, fuelling talk chief executive Arun Sarin was asserting his authority by clearing out the old guard.

 The worlds biggest mobile operator by revenues said chief marketing officer Peter Bamford would leave on April 1. A spokesman said Bamford was leaving as part of a fundamental review of the groups marketing operations.

 He has been given notice to leave in accordance with his contract, the spokesman said. Vodafone did not name a successor but said global consumer marketing director Frank Rovekamp would take over Bamfords duties.

 Analysts said Bamfords exit was another case of a director who was closely identified with the former regime of former CEO Christopher Gent leaving the company.

 It has been a bit of out-with-the-old and in-with-the-new recently (at Vodafone) in terms of directors. Hes is another old crew guy going, said Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein analyst Robert Grindle. Other notable exits include former finance director Ken Hydon and deputy CEO Julian Horn-Smith. Chairman Ian MacLaurin is due to step down in July and will be replaced by HSBC chairman John Bond.

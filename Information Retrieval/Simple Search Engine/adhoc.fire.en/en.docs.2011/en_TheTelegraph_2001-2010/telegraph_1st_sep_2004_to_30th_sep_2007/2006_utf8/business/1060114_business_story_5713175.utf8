 Ford Fiesta steals show

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Crowd-puller

 New Delhi, Jan. 13: Ford India is on a roll with its Fiesta ? the premium mid-sized sedan it launched with fanfare last November.

 We are getting walkdowns from would-be Toyota Corolla and Skoda customers, said a somewhat chuffed V. Sivaramakrishnan, vice-president (sales and marketing) at Ford India.

 Ford India is struggling to keep up with the orders it has received and is working a double shift and seven days a week to clear the orders.

 Weve got 6500 orders and theres a waiting period of about four weeks now depending on the customers preferences and we hope to clear the orders by February, he said.

 Sivaramakrishnan said Ford wasnt looking to introduce a new model this year. Recalling former Ford India MD David Friedmans comment that the carmaker would launch a vehicle and plan a freshening of an existing product every year, Sivaramakrishnan said Ford India would deliver on the promise in 2006 as well.

 With the Fiesta, Ford India already has a new launch; so the focus would be on a makeover or upgrade of an existing model. Sivaramakrishnan refused to say which model would be singled out for such an upgrade.

 We are looking to consolidate our operations this year in the domestic market. Exports will come only after that, he added.

 Ford India has a plant that can produce 50,000 units a year, but it isnt planning to ramp up capacity just yet.

 Sivaramakrishnan claimed that the 1.3-litre Ford Ikon Flair had become a big hit with first-time owners of cars. 

 We are seeing entry-level car owners go straight for the Flair. Almost 28 per cent of our Flair buyers are first-time buyers of cars and they are usually from the IT and financial services segments. Cheap loans have made it possible for first-time buyers to go straight for mid-size sedans, Sivaramakrishnan said.

 The Ford Fusion was also doing well after its repositioning last July with sales of about 120 units a month, he said.

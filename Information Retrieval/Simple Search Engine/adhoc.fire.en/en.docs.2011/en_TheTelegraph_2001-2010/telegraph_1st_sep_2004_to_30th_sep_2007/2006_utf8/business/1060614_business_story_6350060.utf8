 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, June 13: The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) today released consultation papers on the need for regulatory intervention in interconnect usage charges for short message service (SMS).

 The transmission of SMS across different networks is based on mutual agreement among operators with most operators adopting the bill and keep approach for charging SMS. 

 Under this formula, there is no settlement of access charges between two operators at the month end. Such a mechanism assumes that the two networks generate the same traffic volumes ensuring uniform utilisation, dispensing with the need for any access charges settlement.

 With operators offering different bundled tariff plans for SMS, and with messages being increasingly used as an advertising medium, the SMS traffic imbalance across operators is increasing. With this imbalance in traffic, there is a possibility that some networks are burdened with a large proportion of incoming SMS traffic, the Trai statement said.

 Thus, there seems to be a need for regulatory intervention to ensure that no operator assumes an unnecessary burden, the statement added.

 The consultation paper also covers the tremendous increase in activities like tele-voting, lottery and online bidding by the electronic and print media with the help of SMS.

 These messages are priced higher than the normal rate, and this consultation paper discusses the pricing issues linked with these types of activities. Trai has invited written comments on the issues on or before June 30.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 9: Taiwanese two-wheeler firm Sanyang, which has acquired an 11.1 per cent stake in Kinetic Motor Co, today said it would launch its vehicles in India this year. 

 Vice-chairman Taka Huang said, Sanyang (SYM) plans to introduce the advanced technology platforms in India through its association with Kinetic. The first launch from the SYM-Kinetic alliance is expected within the next nine months.

 Our team is impressed with Kinetics facilities, distribution network and management and we are looking forward to working together, he added. 

 Last month, SYM said Kinetic had issued 20.65 lakh preferential shares, equivalent to an 11.1 per cent stake, to it. Even after selling the stake, valued at about Rs 13.63 crore, the Firodia family holds 56 per cent in Kinetic Motors through group companies. 

 Chairman Arun Firodia said, This alliance will enable us to expand our business in India as well as other countries. We look forward to bringing out the best products with new generation engine technology through this tie-up.

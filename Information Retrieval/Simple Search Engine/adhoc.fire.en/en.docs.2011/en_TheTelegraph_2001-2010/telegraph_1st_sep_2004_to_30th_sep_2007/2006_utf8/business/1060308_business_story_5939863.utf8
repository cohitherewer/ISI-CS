 Calcutta, March 7: Vietnam could become the next hub for ?split integration? for Indian steel companies. Domestic steel firms can invest in setting up modern finishing mills in Vietnam and cost effective input steel slabs /bloom/billets from India could be finished there and exported to other ASEAN countries.

 There is a potential for joint ventures in steel and engineering sectors as more Indian companies are acquiring steel plants in the region and split integration becoming the order of the day maximising values for both countries, said Biswadip Gupta, managing director, Vesuvius India Ltd.

 Gupta and other chieftains of the Bengal industry were a part of the business delegation that accompanied state chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to Vietnam during March 2 to 5.

 Several leading Indian companies, particularly two, were exploring such opportunities after Essar.

 ?Bengal?s locational advantage could be used by the Vietnamese to set up base in the state for engineering industries like auto forgings and aluminium dye casting, which could feed the growing auto market in the country,? Gupta said.

 At the Nicco Institute of Biotechnology in the state, which will start early 2007, five seats have been reserved for Vietnamese students. The best Vietnamese student is offered a full scholarship, said Rajive Kaul, chairman, Nicco Corporation. He was also a member of the delegation.

 Kaul said the delegation visited an amusement park and a water park in Ho Chi Minh City and would explore possibilities of setting up the same here. Subrata Mukerji of ICICI Securities, who accompanied Kaul, assured him of full support.

 According to Roopen Roy, managing director, PricewaterhouseCoopers, tremendous opportunities existed in the ITeS sector where Indian companies could help Vietnamese counterparts move up the value chain.

 ?A delegation from Vietnam is supposed to visit Sector V in Salt Lake sometime in July 2006, but the details are yet to be finalised. Such study tours would help understand markets and establish possible joint ventures,? Roy added.

 He also pledged the support of PwC?s Vietnam office to facilitate commercial exchanges between Bengal and Vietnam.

 Vietnam has great expertise in rubber and a rubber plantation delegation is set to visit the city next month, said Samir Ghosh, managing director of India Potteries Ltd.

 Vietnam is traditionally known for its expertise in seafood and marine products. Technology transfer regarding catfish breeding exports, which generate Rs 900-1000 crore revenue for Vietnam, could provide employment to about two lakh people here.

 Vedanta debt rating takes S amp;P rap 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Jan. 20: Standard amp; Poors Ratings Services has lowered the long-term foreign currency and senior unsecured debt ratings of Vedanta Resources Plc, the Anil Agarwal-promoted metals and mining company. 

 The agency has lowered its ratings due to the increased business and financial risks involved in the London-listed firms plans to set up a $1.2-billion aluminium smelter and power plant in Orissa. 

 While the ratings have been lowered to BB from BB+, the outlook remains negative. 

 The downward shift in Vedantas credit profile is due to the increased business and financial risks following the companys announcement in December of a new $2.1-billion aluminium smelter and power plant project in Orissa, said Standard amp; Poors credit analyst Anshukant Taneja. 

 This investment, which is in addition to the $825 million outlay announced in the past six months, will be partly funded by additional long-term borrowings. 

 As a result, Vedantas total debt is exposure is expected to increase by about $700 million, after incorporating the refinancing proposed by the company. 

 Given the size of these outlays, and the uncertainties associated with greenfield projects, the latest expansion plan is likely to have an adverse impact on the overall business profile of Vedanta. 

 The companys revised plan deviates from earlier expectations of a steady improvement in its overall risk profile, even after factoring in the positive impact of timely completion of earlier projects and the present favourable price environment, Taneja said. The risk profile had been expected to improve upon completion of the original $2.2-billion investment plan, which was announced during the firms initial public offering in December 2003. 

 The large scale of the smelter project and its long construction period pose new challenges for the company.

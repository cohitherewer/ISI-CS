 Calcutta, March 28: RailTel Corporation of India Limited is expecting a turnover of more than Rs 60 crore this fiscal against Rs 34 crore in 2004-05. It hopes to grow by 50 per cent in the next two to three years. 

 RailTel is a government undertaking that provides broadband telecommunication and multimedia network and develops modern train control operation and safety systems.

 RailTel, which has already applied for a national long distance (NLD) licence, did not rule out the possibility of applying for an international long distance (ILD) licence in future, said K.K. Bajpayee, managing director of RailTel.

 RailTel has appointed Descon, the city-based Internet service provider and software application developer, as its franchisee to provide broadband Internet and virtual private network services in the east and the Northeast.

 Descon plans to target Calcutta and other major cities in Bengal in the first phase and garner a 20 per cent market share in the next one year, said S. Radhakrishnan, managing director of Descon.

 The second phase would cover the whole of eastern region, including Bhubaneswar and Ranchi. Descon plans to set up sub franchisees in such locations.

 RailTel is also planning cyber cafes in 82 railway stations by 2006-07 and also extend the existing call centres in Bangalore and Patna, Bajpayee said. To reach out to customers from the RailTel point of presence (POPs), Descon will use either RailTels network as the last mile or provide the last mile connectivity through its own network optical fibre or radio modems.

 We have already tied up with Motorola for distributing radio equipment in eastern and north eastern India for last mile connectivity, Radhakrishnan added.

 Besides increased Internet bandwidth and virtual private networks, services would include voice-over-Internet-protocol (VoIP), video conferencing, web hosting facility, application management, mailing facility and system integration services.

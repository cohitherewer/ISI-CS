 Day of reckoning for Arcelor honchos

 Luxembourg, June 24 (AFP): Decision time was looming for Arcelor as marathon talks intensified today ahead of a board meeting that will decide which other steelmaker to take down the aisle, sources following the discussions said. 

 In one corner is a takeover bid from Mittal Steel, the worlds largest steelmaker, owned by Indian billionaire Lakshmi Mittal, that is of questionable industrial logic but is tempting from a financial perspective, they said. 

 The alternative is a merger proposal with Russias Severstal that is popular with the management but opposed by many shareholders. 

 The Arcelor board will meet tomorrow to make a final decision. Having already lasted several days and all of last night, the talks have intensified in recent hours, the sources said, with Arcelors chairman Joseph Kinsch conducting separate discussions with the chiefs of both suitor companies today. 

 Arcelor has spurned Mittals advances for the past five months, and earlier this month rejected its 25.8 billion euro ($32.3 billion) hostile bid. But Mittal is now said to be tabling a higher offer, which may prompt Arcelor to succumb to its advances.

 Mittal Steel is the worlds biggest steelmaker and the deal with Arcelor would create a group with an output three times larger than its nearest rival. A spokesman for Mittal Steel yesterday said the talks were advanced and constructive, with Arcelor sources saying Mittal was making important concessions.

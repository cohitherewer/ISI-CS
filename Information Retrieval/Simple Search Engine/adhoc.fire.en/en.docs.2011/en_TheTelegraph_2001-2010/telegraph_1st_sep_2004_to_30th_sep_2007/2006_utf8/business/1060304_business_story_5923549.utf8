 Calcutta, March 3: State governments have an unhealthy competition among themselves when it comes to implementing e-governance projects, reinventing the wheel every time and leading to a wastage of tax payers money.

 Although Bengal has emerged a champion in the eastern region states, it does not figure among the leading states in the country in the Dataquest?International Data Corporation (IDC India Ltd) survey on e-governance.

 There are currently 25 e-governance projects operating in the country, of which 10 are central government initiatives with participation from the states, said Parijat Chakraborty, general manager, IDC (India) Ltd.

 The other 15 are on various themes like land reforms or bhumi, inter-department transactions within states, taxation, irrigation and many other such categories, which have been implemented in various states.

 Typically a state advanced in e-governance initiatives would be implementing projects in 12 to 13 of the 15 themes, Chakraborty said.

 IDC is planning to submit a 10-point agenda on various issues regarding e-governance projects to the department of information technology by the month end.

 The suggestions include standardisation guidelines, which should be made available, and accountability for starting a new project afresh without turning to existing reference points, Chakraborty mentioned. 

 The leading states mentioned in the survey are New Delhi, Gujarat, Kerala, Maharashtra and Goa. The survey should be completed by the end of the month. 

 The competition among states leads to lack of co-operation and knowledge sharing. As a result, every time a project on a new theme is undertaken, instead of referring to the existing ones in the same area which other states have undertaken, the wheel is reinvented time and again. 

 This is one of the key observations of the survey and is done in a bid to outdo the other states resulting in a waste of resources, time and the tax payers money, Chakraborty said.

 The survey has also revealed that the e-governance spends are not proportionately related to the efficiency of the projects.

 Court shatters Anils hopes

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 3: Delhi High Court today rejected a plea made by Anil Ambani-promoted Reliance Airport Developers to grant an interim stay on the transfer of control of Delhi and Mumbai airports to GMR-Fraport and GVK Industries respectively. 

 A division bench headed by Justice Thirath Thakur refused to entertain the plea made by Reliance Airport, which alleged that the Airports Authority of India (AAI) had arbitrarily amended the specifications in the tender to favour GMR-Fraport and GVK. 

 The Anil firm had complained that these deliberate changes were made to thwart Reliance Airport from securing the modernisation rights. 

 The company said either the tenders be terminated as illegal or fresh contracts be issued for the modernisation of the airports.

 However, the governments counsel argued that the bidding process was transparent.

 The bench, while declining to stay the reported agreement in the interim order, today recalled its own order that any action taken in this regard would be subject to the courts final decision on the tender controversy.

 Reliance Airports counsel wanted the contract to be quashed, but additional solicitor general Gopal Subramaniam said the technical parameters in the tender were specified by experts.

 The bench of Justice Thakur and Justice BN Chaturvedi heard for 40 days the arguments by senior lawyers such as K.K. Venugopal, K. Parasaran, Dushyant Dave and Rajiv Nayar.

 Reliance Airport moved court when GVK bagged the contract to upgrade the Mumbai airport and GMR-Fraport won the modernisation rights for Delhi. 

 The Anil firm had questioned the findings of a group of experts headed by Delhi Metro chief E. Sreedharan. Reliance Airport alleged that the group was constituted as a ruse to solely disqualify its bid. 

 During the hearings, GMRs counsel said the bidding was fair, with as many as 42 people, including Cabinet ministers, involved in the decision-making process.

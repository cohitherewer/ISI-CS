 New horizons

 Mumbai, Oct. 29: House of Pearl, the ready-to-wear apparel company, has firmed up its retail entry strategy in India after having filed the detailed red herring prospectus with capital market regulator Sebi some time back.

 We plan to start our first retail venture in the second quarter of next year. The first five to seven shops will come up in North India, most in Delhi and the NCR region by the middle of next year, Deepak Seth, group chairman of House of Pearl told The Telegraph here. 

 The company plans to sink in close to Rs 73 crore from the IPO proceeds into the retail venture. After the IPO, the managements shareholding in the company will come down to 68 per cent from the present 98 per cent. 

 According to market estimates, the company plans to raise more than Rs 400 crore from the IPO.

 Pearl Global Ltd, a group company, is already listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange. House of Pearl is the holding company of the group. 

 We are looking at a three-year timeframe for the first phase of our retail rollout. We are looking at a mix of debt, equity and internal accruals to fund our rollout, Seth added. 

 The company will look at the franchisee option also.

 After the completion of first phase and once we have reached a minimum of 40 to 50 stores, we will look at franchisee option too, he added.

 It is also hunting for smaller acquisitions abroad.We are looking at 100 to 150 store retail chains in the US and the UK for acquisition and we are looking at investing close to Rs 40 crore from the IPO proceeds for the same. 

 The rest will be through debt and internal accruals, said Rishi Vig, CFO of House of Pearl. 

 The companys first international design centre is also expected to start in Gurgaon soon. 

 We have taken up land already for the same. The centre is expected to cost close to Rs 15 to 20 crore. It is expected to be the hub of our sourcing for international market, Vig added. 

 The apparel company is looking at doubling its production capacity to 40 million from 20 million pieces annually in the next three years. 

 It is expected to invest close to Rs 110 crore for the same.

 At an annual growth rate of 25 per cent per annum, House of Pearl clocked a consolidated turnover of more than Rs 800 crore in the previous fiscal. 

 It is now eyeing a nearly 30 to 40 per cent year-on-year growth to take the turnover to about Rs 1,000 crore on the back of major expansion plans.

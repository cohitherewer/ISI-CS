 Serono lines up capital hike plans

 Zurich, March 31 (Reuters): Swiss drugs firm Serono unveiled surprise plans to raise about $5.6 billion in capital on Friday, giving it firepower for takeovers after efforts to find a buyer for the firm stalled.

 Serono shares sagged 4.6 per cent to 918.50 Swiss francs at 4:42 am EST on concerns any issue could dilute the value of existing shares, adding to an 8 per cent slide so far in 2006 as hopes that Serono itself would be taken over have faded.

 Serono said it would seek approval to issue up to 7.6 million new shares and would now consider one or more targets. At the same time, it would continue a strategic review that could result in a full sale or merger of the family-controlled firm.

 Seronos plans, launched in November, to find a buyer ran aground for lack of interest. The surprise capital hike could break the companys strategic deadlock by giving it the means to expand in a sector dominated by giants such as Switzerlands Novartis or the UKs GlaxoSmithKline.

 Seronos most important product is Rebif, an injectable drug for multiple sclerosis. The medicines long-term future is in doubt, however, as scientists work to develop more convenient oral treatments. Seronos pipeline of experimental drugs is generally seen as being weak, analysts have said.

 Any new capital issued would add to the $1.5 billion war chest that Serono revealed in February. 

 But the move raised as many questions as it answered, as it is still unclear whether Serono will buy, merge or be bought.

 Todays move may represent a way of demonstrating to potential buyers that it has strategic alternatives, so as to hurry potential bidders into making hard offers, Lehman Brothers said in an analyst note. Serono may not have a specific acquisition lined up.

 Either way, it suggests to us that Serono is finding it hard to secure a buyer at a desirable price, Lehman said.

 Before Fridays fall, Serono shares were trading at 17.4 times forecast 2006 earnings, making it more expensive by that measure than GlaxoSmithKline, at 16.4, and slightly lower than Novartis, at 17.7.

 If fully exercised, the capital increase would be worth around 7.3 billion Swiss francs ($5.58 billion), based on Seronos closing share price on Thursday, adding to the companys market value of around $10 billion.

 This would be a huge possible dilution, and a takeover of Serono might be less likely said analysts at bank Julius Baer.

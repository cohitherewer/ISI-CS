 Buffett kitty ready for Europe, Japan

 Warren Buffett: Looking ahead

 Omaha, Nebraska, May 8 (Reuters): Billionaire US investor Warren Buffett said he wants to use some of his firms $40 billion (?21.5 billion) cash to invest in overseas companies, and pinpointed Europe and Japan.

 The worlds second-richest person wants to put his insurance and investment conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway Incs cash pile to better use and ideally shrink it to $10 billion.

 Buffett, Berkshires chairman and chief executive, said he has concerns about the dollar, which he sees weakening further, and he also said he doesnt find screaming bargains in the United States in big companies at present.

 Berkshire made its first acquisition of a non-US based company on Friday, with a deal to buy 80 per cent of Israels Iscar Metalworking Cos in a transaction valuing the closely held tool firm at $5 billion.

 Buffett said while Berkshire had always been willing to do things outside the US, it wasnt offered many opportunities in the past, though more might now come after the Iscar buy.

 He told Berkshires annual meeting on Saturday he was eyeing a possible $15-billion acquisition, but said there was only a small chance of that happening, and gave no further details.

 Some 24,000 shareholders packed Omahas Qwest Centre to hear Buffet speak. Many have made healthy gains from Berkshire stock, which has far outperformed benchmark indices since Buffett took over the company in 1965.

 Buffet said he sees opportunity for investments in Europe and Britain, which looked a fertile field, and sees potential for buying whole companies in Japan, partly because of a rise in shareholder activism that could encourage firms to find a home at Berkshire.

 Succession issue

 One question that causes much speculation is who will eventually succeed Buffett, 75. Although he hasnt named a chief executive, he said he hoped his son, Howard Buffett, would become non-executive chairman, and be a double protector of Berkshires culture.

 He also said Joe Brandon, who runs Berkshires General Re insurance unit, was doing fine and has done a great job. Last year, Berkshire said securities regulators may sue Brandon and former and current subordinates of General Re, over their roles in a 2000 transaction that helped American International Group Inc inflate its reserves.

 The SEC filed a civil charge earlier this year but did not cite Brandon, according to a newspaper report.

 ICICI Prudential charts growth plan

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 7: Encouraged by a 64 per cent growth in new business premium at Rs 2,412 crore in 2005-06, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company has chalked out aggressive expansion plans for the current financial year.

 We are planning to double our branch network in 2006-07 from 177 at present, said Sujit Ganguli, marketing head of ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company Ltd. As of now, we are present in 132 cities across the country. We want to go to as many cities during this financial year, but these will be smaller cities and towns, he added.

 Ganguli, however, declined to give details of the capital the company would require to foot the expansion bill. Going by the business growth last year ? we expect the same growth rate for this year too ? we will definitely require fresh capital infusion by the shareholders of ICICI Bank and Prudential during this financial year only, he said.

 The life insurers capital base now stands at Rs 1,175 crore. The company is likely to take it to Rs 1,500 crore by March 2007.

 Bengal and the eastern region figure prominently in ICICI Pru Lifes expansion map. We are present at four locations in Bengal and want to increase our branch network in the state by four times to 40-50 branches. In the eastern region, we want to grow our branches from 19 locations to 57, Ganguli said.

 Northeastern states, such as Tripura, Mizoram and Asom and Orissa in the eastern region have got special interest in ICICI Prudential Lifes scheme of things. 

 The insurer will modify 10 of its existing unit-linked schemes by July 1 to comply with the insurance regulators new guidelines. We dont have to change much in our existing policies as all of them already have a three-year lock-in period, mentioned Prasun Sikdar, head of sales (north zone), ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company Ltd. 

 However, the IRDA guidelines also require a minimum sum assured for regular premium unit-linked scheme. Here we will have our existing policies modified a bit, agreed Sikdar. But the existing policyholders will not be able to avail the benefit of increased sum assured, as the modified policies will be offered only to new customers. The cost structure of the modified policies will also be different, as it will now have to take into account the increased sum assured, Ganguli said.

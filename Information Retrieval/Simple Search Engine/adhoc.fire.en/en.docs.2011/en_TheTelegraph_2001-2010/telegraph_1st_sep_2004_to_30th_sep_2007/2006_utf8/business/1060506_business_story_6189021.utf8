 Tea buyers to skip auction

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, May 5: Tea buyers are divided on the decision to stay away from auctions.

 The Tea Auction Buyers Association of Calcutta (Tabac) today met to decide on a course of action for the almost 400 per cent increase in service charge or brokerage fee in north Indian auctions.

 Tabac said it would make a representation to brokers and would not participate in the Calcutta auctions to be held on Monday. The association, however, would not opt for legal measures.

 But some members are dissatisfied at the lack of consensus among buyers regarding boycotting auctions. A few are sourcing tea from non-auction channels and some still participated in the auctions.

 In the liberalised Tea Marketing Control Order 2003, there is no restriction on business outside the auction system.

 We will not prevent buyers from participating in auctions but can only request them to refrain from doing so. A majority would stay away from auctions on their own volition. After the representation to brokers, we expect to work out a settlement, said Gopal Poddar, president of Tabac.

 The hike in Calcutta is 0.3 per cent of the prevailing tea prices, 0.22 per cent of that in Guwahati and 0.2 per cent of that in Siliguri.

 The fee in Calcutta and Siliguri was 5 paise per kg and 3.3 paise per kg respectively since 1982. No guidance regarding service levels of brokers has been provided.

 Poddar said a large quantity was sold privately wherein the brokerage would be lost. If the deadlock continues, it would have an adverse impact on the productivity of the auction system.

 Around 425 buyers operate in Calcutta, of which around 80 to 85 per cent are Tabac members. Three hundred buyers operate in Siliguri and Guwahati. 

 Tabac feels that a switch to a value-based buying brokerage instead of a flat rate would increase the transaction cost and impact the cost competitiveness of the auction system. 

 The ministry of commerce is ready to discuss the hike provided normalcy prevails at the auctions.

 Minimal participation is expected at the auction in the city on Monday.

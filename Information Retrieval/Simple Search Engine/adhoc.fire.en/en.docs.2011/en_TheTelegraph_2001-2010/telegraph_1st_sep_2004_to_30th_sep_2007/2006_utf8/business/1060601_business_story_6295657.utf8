 Pentair to cash in on local need

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 31: Pentair Water India, a 100 per cent subsidiary of US headquartered Pentair Group, is aiming at a revenue of Rs 171 crore this calendar year against Rs 126 crore clocked in 2005.

 The need for water treatment at homes is growing by leaps and bounds and growth in the residential water treatment segment is higher than industrial units, said Gautam Khanna, chief executive officer, Pentair Water (PWI).

 PWI is the manufacturer and exporter of water treatment components and solutions. At present, the Indian market size for water treatment equipment and solutions stands at around Rs 850 crore. Analysts say it is growing at the rate of 30 per cent each year.

 We have about 6 per cent market share in the reverse osmosis segment and less than a per cent share in the UV segment. We have charted out an aggressive growth plan for ourselves, Khanna said.

 The company today said the Bangalore district court has vacated a stay order, following which Pentair will be able to air its advertisements.

 In February, Eureka Forbes had filed a case stating PWIs advertisement was maligning its image. While passing a judgement in favour of Pentair and vacating the ex-parte injunction on the advertisement, the court observed that UV technology was being used in water purification systems not only by Eureka Forbes but also by other companies, the company said.

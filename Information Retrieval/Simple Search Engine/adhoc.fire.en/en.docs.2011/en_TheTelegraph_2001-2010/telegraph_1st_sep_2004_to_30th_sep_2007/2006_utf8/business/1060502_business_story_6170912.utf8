 Calcutta, May 1: Bangalore-based Canara Bank, in which the government holds a 73 per cent stake, will raise Rs 3,000 crore capital ? both tier I and tier II ? this fiscal, according to chairman and managing director M.B.N. Rao.

 The tier I capital will be raised through issuance of equity in the domestic market and hybrid preference shares in which foreign entities are allowed to invest up to 49 per cent, Rao said.

 Canara Bank is scouting for a foreign partner to enter the life insurance business. The public sector bank is also talking to a couple of other state-owned banks for partnering in the joint venture. 

 Till now, we have been selling life insurance products of Aviva through a bancassurance tie-up. However, we want to start our own life insurance business this year. We are talking to two to three foreign life insurers for a joint venture, which may have participation from one or two other public sector banks, Rao said. 

 Once the foreign partner is selected, we will approach the Reserve Bank of India and the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority for their approval for the proposed venture. We expect it to be finalised in three months, he added.

 According to him, the joint venture will start operations with the minimum statutory capital of Rs 100 crore. 

 Canara Bank is planning a major organisational restructuring. It will enter into a strategic tie-up with a multinational asset management company to rev up its mutual fund outfit, Canbank Mutual Fund. The mutual fund is managed by Canbank Investment Management Services Ltd, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Canara Bank.

 We are looking for a foreign partner for our mutual fund subsidiary because the foreign asset management company will not only bring expertise but also business for us. The foreign company will be given a minority stake. Canara Bank will continue to hold the majority control in the subsidiary, Rao said. 

 The bank has initiated talks with a few foreign asset management companies and a deal is expected in a month. Canara Bank will also enter the stock broking business through its primary dealer arm, Gilt Securities Trading Corporation Ltd. 

 Now that the Reserve Bank has decided to allow primary dealers to diversify into different activities, including stock broking, we will definitely get into it. Actually, we have been telling the apex bank to grant us permission to start stock broking. If the regulatory guidelines are in place, we may start stock broking in three months, Rao said.

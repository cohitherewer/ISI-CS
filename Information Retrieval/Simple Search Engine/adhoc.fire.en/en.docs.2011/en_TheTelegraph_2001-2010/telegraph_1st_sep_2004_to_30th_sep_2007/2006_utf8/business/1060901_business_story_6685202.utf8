 Calcutta, Aug. 31: The government will float a tender by the year-end to invite bids for two of the five ultra-mega power projects in Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh. Bids for another two will be invited in March next year.

 This was revealed by finance ministry secretary (economic affairs) Ashok Jha at an interactive session organised by the BNCCI here today. 

 Each of these projects will have a capacity of 4,000 megawatt and will cater to more than one state. An average investment in each of these projects is estimated at Rs 16,000 crore. 

 According to the governments latest policy on equity holding of these projects, a private promoter will not be allowed to reduce ones stake below 51 per cent at least for the first two years after the project starts commercial production.

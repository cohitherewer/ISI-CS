 Airline trio hikes fare

 New Delhi, July 4: Jet Airways, Indian Airlines and Air Sahara today decided to raise their fuel surcharge by Rs 200 to Rs 500 per passenger.

 The move, which Jet initiated and was followed by Sahara and Indian Airlines within hours, comes on the back of an increase in jet fuel prices on July 1. 

 State-run oil companies had increased prices of aviation turbine fuel by about 2 per cent or Rs 900 a kilolitre on the first of this month.

 However, most airlines had dismissed speculations of a possible fare hike at that time as the monsoon months are generally lean periods for airlines, who slash rates during this time. 

 A Sahara official said, ?We have dropped fares on many routes, including Singapore, besides trying to promote corporate travel through cheaper bulk bookings. But we felt we needed to rake in the small change which the fuel surcharge will give us as the bigger players were going ahead with a hike.? 

 The fare increase will be on most domestic routes and in both the business and economy classes. The fuel surcharge increase will be effective from July 7.

 This month?s aviation fuel price hike comes on the back of another hike, which was effected in May this year. Aviation turbine fuel prices had then been raised by Rs 3,100 to Rs 3,700 per kilolitre (kl).

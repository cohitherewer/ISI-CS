 Fed fuels sensex rally

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, July 20: Stocks snapped a five-day losing streak with the sensex rebounding 346 points, or 3.45 per cent, to close the day at 10352.94 against yesterdays close of 10007.34.

 The Indian bourses turned buoyant along with other world markets after US Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke told the Senate Banking Committee during a testimony that inflation pressures were likely to subside in the coming quarters as the economy slowed, giving the clearest signal yet that the Feds two-year rate tightening cycle was nearing an end.

 Market watchers said the bourses reacted positively to three clear signals: easing concerns over further interest rate hikes, decline in crude oil prices and a smart recovery in the rupee.

 The sensex had lost 923 points or 8.44 per cent in the last five sessions. Taking cues from firm international markets, the sensex opened strong at 10247.87 and hit a fresh high of 10409.58 during late afternoon session of trades as buying momentum intensified. Its low was at 10189.67. 

 Nifty surged 90 points, or 3.08 per cent, to 3,023.05, though Nifty July 2006 futures settled at 3022, a slight discount of 1.05 points over the spot closing. 

 The market breadth was strong on the Bombay Stock Exchange with 1,394 shares advancing compared with 980 that declined, while 76 remained unchanged. 

 Buying interest resumed in the recently battered small and midcap stocks, which participated in todays rally, said a dealer. 

 The BSE Smallcap Index advanced 61.79 points, or 1.27 per cent, to 4943.81, while the Midcap Index rose 52.85 points, or 1.30 per cent, to 4,127.59. Metal and bank shares were in the limelight with their indices gaining by 386.92 points or 5.21 per cent and by 195.84 points or 4.83 per cent, respectively. 

 Rupee hardens

 The rupee also pulled back today, notching up gains of over 20 paise to end at 46.79 per dollar, propelled by the dollars weakness overseas and easing oil prices.

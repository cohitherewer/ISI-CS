 New Delhi, Jan. 11: Skoda Auto India is planning to enter the small car market in India.

 ?We want a presence in the small car market. We will do it at an appropriate time,? said Lucas Folc, the new managing director of Skoda Auto India.

 ?Our small cars will incorporate some of the features that we have in our top-of-the-line sedans,? Folc said.

 Skoda Auto India, which makes sedans that compete with the likes of Toyota Corolla, has reported a 25 per cent growth in 2005 sales at 8,953 units. It is targeting a figure of 13,500 units in 2006.

 ?This is an ambitious, but realistic, target,? Folc added. The Indian subsidiary of the Czech automaker will launch six new models this year. He refused to name them.

 The company will showcase 12 of its top models at the Auto Expo 2006, which begins here tomorrow. These include Fabia, internationally acclaimed concept car Yeti, and a limited edition of its flagship model SkodaSuperb 100.

 Fred Kappler, a member of Skoda Autos board, confirmed that Imran Hassen, the former MD of Skoda Auto India, would be leaving the Volkswagen group.

 ?Hassen reports to Skoda Auto Europe, but in due course of time, he will be quitting the Volkswagen Group,? Kappler said, when asked to comment on Hassen?s sudden and controversial exit. Hassen started Skoda Auto?s Indian operations about five years ago. He was forced to leave last December and was replaced by Folc, the chief finance officer of the Indian subsidiary.

 Earlier this week, Dirk Grosse-Leege, Volkswagen Groups communications chief, had said Hassen had been fired ?because of differences on management issues?.

 Volkswagen, Skoda?s parent, is planning to set up a car-making plant in India. It is not known whether the differences arose over VWs plans. 

 VWs plans to set up a plant in Visakhapatnam (Andhra Pradesh) became controversial after its pointsman, Helmut Schuster, was accused of forming a shell company, Vashishta Wahan Private Limited, which received a payment of Rs 27 crore from the Andhra Pradesh government. The payment was seen as a bribe to persuade the Wolfsburg, Germany-based carmaker to build its plant in the state.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Feb. 2: Dr Reddys Laboratories Ltd has joined forces with Argenta Discovery Ltd, a UK-based privately held firm, to develop and commercialise a novel approach to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 

 Under the pact, DRL and Argenta will collaborate to identify clinical candidates from a certain class of the Hyderabad-based companys compounds for use as potential treatments for COPD. 

 An official communiqu? stated that both parties will jointly develop the selected candidates from the pre-clinical stage up to phase II trials, which is proof of concept stage that essentially shows the idea is feasible.

 On successful completion of these trials, the companies may either license-out the candidate for further development and commercialisation to a larger pharmaceutical company or continue co-developing and commercialising themselves.

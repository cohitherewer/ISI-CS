 Calcutta, June 6: Berger Paints India today announced a 50 per cent final dividend and three bonus shares for five equity shares held by shareholders. Along with the interim dividend of 50 per cent in November, Bergers total payout in this fiscal is 100 per cent.

 Reviewing the performance of 2005-06, Berger Paints managing director Subir Bose said the city-based company has overtaken Goodlass Nerolac in total sales. We have become the second largest paint manufacturer after Asian Paints.

 Bose said Berger was number two in terms of volume and, after earning Rs 10 crore more than Goodlass, it was second in value as well.

 The company reported a gross sales of Rs 1,117.49 crore for 2005-06 against Rs 947.57 crore in 2004-05. If earnings of its subsidiaries are included, total sales stood at Rs 1,165.29 crore, up from Rs 982.73 crore in the previous fiscal.

 For the first time, we have clocked sales of over Rs 1,000 crore, Bose said.

 The thrust on home and decorative paints as well as brand engineering, including packaging and products, have helped the company.

 Bergers post-tax profit in 2005-06 increased 35 per cent on a stand-alone basis to Rs 70.29 crore from Rs 52.12 crore. Consolidated net, too, grew 35 per cent to Rs 74.38 crore.

 Following the bonus, paid-up equity capital will go up to Rs 66.4 crore from Rs 39.85 crore. Bose said the company would raise prices of solvent-based paints this month. On May 17, Berger said it would raise the prices by 3-4 per cent in June.

 Global crude price has gone up to $75 a barrel and a large part of our raw materials are crude derivatives. We cant absorb the high input cost. We will have to raise the prices of our solvent-based products, he added. Solvent-based paints contribute 55 per cent of Bergers total sales.

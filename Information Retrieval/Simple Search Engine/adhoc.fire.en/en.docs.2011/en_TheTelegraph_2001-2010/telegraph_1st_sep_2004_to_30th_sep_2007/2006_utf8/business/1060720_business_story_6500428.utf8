 Airport case comes up for hearing

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 19: Anil Ambani group firm Reliance Airport Developers today alleged before the Supreme Court that the government did not follow a fair and transparent process in allotting modernisation works of Delhi and Mumbai airports.

 Mukul Rohatgi, senior counsel for Reliance Airport, said before a bench headed by Justice Arijit Pasayat that his client was not questioning the privatisation, but the allotment procedure.

 The court was hearing the appeal filed by Reliance challenging the Delhi High Court verdict upholding the governments decision to allot the airport modernisation works to rival bidders GMR and GVK-led consortia. Reliance has challenged the award of contracts to GMR and GVK-led consortia on the ground that the government and the AAI had deliberately amended tender norms to favour the rival bidders.

 Reliance said there was a need to set parameters for privatisation to ensure that the government got the best returns.

 This was just the beginning and many more would come. Railway stations could follow airports, Rohatgi said, stressing on the need for parameters of privatisation .

 The court, however, made it clear that it would not go into the issue of privatisation and asked Rohatgi to concentrate on his allegation that the government had given a go by to the rules set out in the tender document.

 The company contended that as the highest financial bidder for the Delhi airport and as the highest technical bidder for the Mumbai airport, it should have been awarded at least one of the projects.

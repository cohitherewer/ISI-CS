 Pay less for STD call

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 12: Long-distance phone rates are in for a tumble. Within hours of Bharat Sanchar Nigam cutting fixed-line long-distance rates to Re 1 a minute, Reliance Communications slashed STD rates to Re 1 a minute for all post-paid and pre-paid customers of mobile and fixed wireless phones of the company.

 BSNL will cut rates by over 40 per cent from November 1. Landline customers will be able to make STD calls anywhere in the country at Re 1 per minute and local calls at the rate of Re 1 per 3 minutes on its One India landline plan. 

 Bharti, the other major telecom player, said it would study the situation and take a pricing decision on new offers. However, a company spokesperson was quick to add that Bharti takes autonomous decisions on pricing issues and does not act in reaction.

 The new tariff will come into effect from November 1. It is a Diwali bonanza for our customers, said BSNL chief A.K. Sinha.

 BSNL also reduced monthly rental on One India plan from Rs 225 to Rs 180, besides doubling free calls to 50 a month from 25. 

 The existing 1.16 crore One India subscribers would automatically get upgraded to the new tariff plan from November, said Sinha. 

 According to the new plan, users will need to pay Re 1 per minute for inter-circle and intra-circle STD calls, as opposed to Rs 2.40 per minute and Rs 1.20 per minute, respectively. 

 The Reliance offer is applicable to Rs 675 denomination calling card. 

 With a flat call rate of Rs 1 per minute, the new card will offer 601 minutes that can be exhausted over a period of 30 days, and an additional 15-day roll over period. The 601 minutes can be used anytime anywhere to any phone in India by any subscriber of Reliance Communications pre-paid or post-paid, mobile or fixed.

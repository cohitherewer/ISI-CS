 Calcutta, July 26: Canara Bank is scouting for a small bank in Southeast Asia.

 ?We have a representative office in Shanghai and a subsidiary in Hong Kong. We also have a licence to open a branch in Hong Kong. It would be advantageous for us to look for a bank (for acquisition) in that part of the world,? Canara Bank chairman and managing director M.B.N. Rao said on the sidelines of the third banking conclave organised by the eastern regional council of Ficci.

 The bank is eyeing aggressive expansion overseas. ?We will soon open a representative office in Sharjah,? Rao said, adding that it would open more such overseas offices this year. ?We are also exploring other arrangements, such as overseas joint ventures with foreign or domestic banks and financial institutions, to increase our global presence,? he said.

 The Bangalore-based bank is also open to acquisitions at home. ?Consolidation is inevitable if Indian banks have to compete with their foreign counterparts. Being the second largest public sector bank in the country, we are eager to get any such proposals,? Rao said.

 The bank is also planning to merge its primary dealership business with itself. ?The RBI has recently allowed banks to do primary dealership. We are, therefore, contemplating a merger of our primary dealer subsidiary with the main bank,? Rao said.

 Housing finance

 Canara Bank may divest its 29.3 per cent stake in its housing finance subsidiary, Canfin Homes Ltd. 

 ?It is high time that we should review the status of Canfin Homes. We will soon decide on whether we would retain Canfin Homes as a subsidiary or divest our stake in it,? Rao said.

 The bank is also in the final stages of negotiations with a foreign asset management company to sell a minority stake in its wholly-owned subsidiary, Canbank Investment Management Services Ltd ? the asset management company of Canbank Mutual Fund. 

 However, Rao declined to disclose the name of the foreign collaborator.

 Life insurance

 Canara Bank may partner Oriental Bank of Commerce in its proposed life insurance joint venture. The boards of both the banks have approved the plans for a life insurance foray.

 ?We are now in the penultimate stage of discussion,? said Rao. Canara Bank will hold a majority stake in the life insurance company. ?Besides us, there will be one more Indian bank and a foreign life insurance company in the venture,? Rao said, but he refused to divulge the names of partners. 

 OBC is also scouting for a minority stake in a life insurance venture. OBC chief K.N. Prithviraj said, ?We are talking to a few banks, including the Canara Bank. But nothing has been finalised yet.?

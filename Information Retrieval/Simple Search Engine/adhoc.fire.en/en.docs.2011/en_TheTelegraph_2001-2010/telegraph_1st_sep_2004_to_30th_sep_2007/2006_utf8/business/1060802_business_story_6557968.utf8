 Nasdaq knocks on BSE doors

 Mumbai, Aug. 1 (PTI): Robert Greifeld, CEO of the New York-based Nasdaq, today met officials from the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) in a closed-door meeting to discuss a possible strategic partnership between the two bourses.

 While nothing has yet been made public, market sources said the discussions centred around Nasdaq picking up a stake in the BSE.

 Last month, the BSE had announced that it would divest a 51 per cent stake by May next year. The bourse had also said a 26 per cent stake would be divested in favour of a bank or a stock exchange.

 We are interested in participating in global consolidation, Greifeld said, adding, We are interested in forming strategic partnerships in regions where there are synergies in the business model.

 BSE officials did not deny meeting Nasdaq officials but both sides were tight-lipped about the nature of the discussions.

 Greifeld was accompanied by Charlotte Crosswell, head of Nasdaq International, and Ghanshyam Dass, Nasdaq managing director for the Asia Pacific region. 

 BSE has appointed Kotak Mahindra Capital Company as its financial adviser for the demutualisation process.

 Greifeld also announced that Nasdaq has received a listing application from EXL Service, an Indian company, on July 28. The application is being processed and a decision on its listing will be taken within the next six to eight weeks, which is the general norm, he said.

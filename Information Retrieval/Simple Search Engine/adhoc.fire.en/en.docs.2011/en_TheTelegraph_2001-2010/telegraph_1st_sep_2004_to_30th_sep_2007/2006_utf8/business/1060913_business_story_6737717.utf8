 RIL appeal on PTA dumping allowed

 New Delhi, Sept. 12 (PTI): The Supreme Court has allowed an appeal by Reliance Industries (RIL) against a tribunals order doing away with the imposition of anti-dumping duty on import of pure terephatallic acid (PTA), used in the manufacture of polyester yarn.

 RIL, a diversified company involved in textiles production, had moved the apex court contending that imports from Japan, Malaysia, Spain and Taiwan hurt its operations, which included manufacture of PTA. The Customs Excise and Gold (control) Appeallate Tribunal (CEGAT) had earlier upheld the findings of the designated authority (DA) of the ministry of commerce that a duty cannot be imposed on PTA imported from Japan and Malaysia.

 The tribunal had agreed with the DAs findings that there was no causal link between dumping and injury concerning Japan and Malaysia, while imposing a duty of Rs 521 per metric tonne of PTA on Spain.

 However, the court said the DA had clearly made a mistake, since the authority was required to determine injury and computation of non-injury prices (NIP) taking the domestic industry as a whole and not with respect to any particular firm or enterprise.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, April 13: The National Hydroelectric Power Corporation (NHPC) is likely to come out with an initial public offering (IPO) soon. NHPC is also raising a $100-million loan to finance the Subansiri lower hydel project in Arunachal Pradesh.

 The power ministry has told us to expedite the process for an IPO, NHPC chairman and managing director S.K. Garg told reporters here today. However, he refused to commit himself to any specific date for the public offering.

 Garg said NHPC had clocked a net profit Rs 701 crore in 2005-06 compared with Rs 685 crore in 2004-05, an increase of 2.3 per cent. 

 The company recorded a turnover of Rs 1,834 crore in 2005-06 compared with Rs 1,668 crore in the previous fiscal.

 Garg said NHPC is in the process of raising funds for part financing the Subansiri lower hydel power project in Arunachal Pradesh through the external commercial assistance route.

 He said excavation for all the five diversion tunnels of the 2,000-mw project had been taken up simultaneously and the work was progressing well.

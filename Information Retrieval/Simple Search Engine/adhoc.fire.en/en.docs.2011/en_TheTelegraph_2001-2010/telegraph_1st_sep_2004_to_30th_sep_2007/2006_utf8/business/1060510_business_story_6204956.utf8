 Regulator lends ear to Karvy

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, May 9: The Karvy Group today finally presented their case before Sebi on the charges of manipulating IPOs levelled against them by the regulator. 

 Representatives from both the sides were in a huddle for more than three hours. 

 The personal hearing before the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) was fixed for May 5. However the meeting got postponed: apparently an e-mail on the night of May 4 to Karvy said the meeting had been put off. 

 Karvy is the second entity after Indiabulls to get a personal hearing from Sebi. 

 Sources said eight representatives of Karvy, including chairman C Parthasarthy and officials from the accounts and the law departments, were present at the hearing. 

 Sebi was represented by G Anantharaman, a wholetime director, and members of their legal department. 

 We presented our case point by point and explained whatever we were asked to. We had a whole bunch of documents and thousands of copies of explanations that supported our case, said sources from Karvy. 

 However, Sebi has not given any indication on what action it intends to take against Karvy. 

 Charges against Karvy are much more serious compared to Indiabulls. However, optimism dies hard. 

 No, we do not know what is Sebis decision. We have not been given any indication at the end of the meeting. But, we are hopeful that it will be a favourable decision, said Karvy sources. 

 Meanwhile, Motilal Oswal, one of the 12 depository participants to be barred from opening fresh demat accounts are yet to get a call from Sebi.

 No, we havent yet heard from Sebi about the date of our personal hearing. In any case, the charges against us are not that serious, said a Motilal Oswal spokesperson.

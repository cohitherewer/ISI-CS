 Calcutta, Dec. 17: Global power company AES Corporation is set to make its foray into the alternative energy sector in Bengal.

 AES and the city-based Amrit group have proposed to form a joint venture company, AES Amrit Energy Private Ltd, to set up three bio-mass power plants in the Sundarbans to generate 10 mw. These plants are at Gosaba, Sagar Island and Patharpratima. 

 AES will contribute 45 per cent equity in the company and the rest will be borne by the Amrit group. The group plans to set up similar power plants in Assam, Orissa, Madhya Pradesh and Chattisgarh to generate a total 100 mw of renewable energy.

 A power purchase agreement (PPA) has already been signed between the Amrit group and West Bengal Renewable Energy Development Authority (WBREDA), according to K.C. Dujari, chairman and managing director of the Amrit group. 

 For AES, which generates 44,000 mw in 27 countries across the world, the investment in three tiny bio-mass power plant is designed to provide social mileage, Prabaljit Sarkar, country head of AES Corporation told The Telegraph over phone.

 But for the Amrit group, the association is significant as AES has declared plans to invest $50 million in alternative energy business in the coming years, said K.K. Bagchi, executive director of the group.

 WBREDA, apart from its promotional role for harnessing alternative energy, also distributes power in the Sundarbans. The agency has offered a higher rate of Rs 5.50 per unit for power to be generated by AES Amrit Energy against Rs 3.35 per unit being given by the West Bengal State Electricity Board (WBSEB) for the 10 mw rice husk-based power plant being set up by Amrit Bio Energy in Bankura.

 Top power department officials, including Bengal power minister Mrinal Banerjee and WBREDA chairman S.P. Gon Chowdhury, gathered at the preview session for Amrit Bio Energys 10-mw plant at Bankati, Bankura, on Saturday.

 Gon Chowdhury noted that the state power department and the agency have decided to mobilise all the municipalities to promote charcoal manufacturing units using municipal waste and feed alternative power generation facilities.

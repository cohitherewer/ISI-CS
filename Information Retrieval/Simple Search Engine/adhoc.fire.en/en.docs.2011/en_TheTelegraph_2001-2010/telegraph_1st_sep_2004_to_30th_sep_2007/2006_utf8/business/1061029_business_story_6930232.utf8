 Chevron beats forecast

 Standing tall

 New York, Oct. 28 (Reuters): Chevron Corp, the No 2 US oil company, on Friday posted better-than-expected third-quarter earnings on improved margins at refineries and gas stations and high oil prices. 

 Earnings at the downstream unit which includes its refining, gasoline sales at the pump and transportation businesses rose sharply from last year when the company was forced to shut its largest US refinery after Hurricane Katrina. 

 Weve seen some excellent performance and high utilisation at our refineries, and that contributed greatly to our financial results, chief financial officer Steve Crowe said on a conference call with analysts. 

 Net income in the quarter rose to $5.02 billion, or $2.29 a share, from $3.59 billion, or $1.64 a share, last year. The company said this years results include net charges of about $95 million. 

 The average earnings forecast of analysts polled by Reuters Estimates was $2.04 a share. 

 Total revenue dipped to $54.21 billion from $54.46 billion last year. 

 Earnings at the downstream unit rose to $1.44 billion from $573 million last year. 

 The US portion of that business performed especially well posting its best quarter in at least 6 years as its fuels refinery network operated at close to full capacity during the quarter, Chevron said.

 The downstream profit was well ahead of forecasts, according to James Halloran, an analyst with National City Private Client Group, which owns about 3 million Chevron shares. 

 Theyve shown flashes of excellent performance in downstream, and this is one of them, he said. 

 He said the company had disclosed decent refining margins through August, but that most companies refining margins had narrowed in September. 

 Chevrons margins must have held out pretty well, he said. 

 Profits from the San Ramon, California-based companys exploration and production operation rose to $3.5 billion from $3.32 billion last year. 

 Chevron said worldwide production rose 6 per cent to 2.7 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, with much of that growth due to the companys recent acquisition of Unocal.

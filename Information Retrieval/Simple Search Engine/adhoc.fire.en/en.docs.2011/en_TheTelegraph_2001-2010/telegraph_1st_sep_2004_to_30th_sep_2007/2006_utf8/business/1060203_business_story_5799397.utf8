 Govt rules out LPG price hike

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Feb. 2: Petroleum minister Murli Deora has ruled out an immediate increase in LPG and kerosene prices.

 Though the national oil companies are facing a financial crisis, the government has decided not to increase the prices of petroleum products till the Union budget. 

 The Left parties are strongly opposed to any hike in fuel prices, especially kerosene and LPG, and the government will have to take their view into consideration before taking any decision on price hike.

 Deora today met CPM politbureau member Sitaram Yechury and apprised him of the plight of national oil companies. The meeting is being viewed as the political groundwork to ensure Left support for a fuel price hike as and when it comes.

 Q amp;A

 What lies ahead

 I have a house rent income besides my pension and interest income. I want to confirm whether the income tax deduction of 30 per cent of the net annual value of the property is still available in the assessment year 2006-07 under the Income Tax Act.

 Pradip Dutta, Silchar.

 While computing the income from a let out property for income tax purposes, a deduction of 30 per cent of the net annual value of the property is allowed for repair, maintenance and rent collection expenses. This deduction is available for 2005-06 assessment year. However, the Union Budget 2006-07 will determine if it will still be available. 

 Study loan

 My son has taken an educational loan to pursue his MBA and he is selected for service in ICICI Bank. Will he get income tax rebate on educational loan installment as well as interest accrued and paid thereon?

 Ayodhya Prasad, Ranchi.

 income tax deduction of up to Rs 25,000 is available per annum under section 80E of the Income Tax Act for the repayment of an educational loan. Your son can start repaying the loan after completing the course and can claim the tax deduction of up to Rs 25,000 (on the loan EMIs) from his total income.

 Exemption odds

 Is the principal amount invested under the senior citizens savings scheme (9 per cent interest) of the post office after April 2005 entitled for exemption from income tax for this year under section 80C up to the maximum limit of Rs 1 lakh? Is the interest earned on this investment taxable?

 Subrata Sengupta, Calcutta. 

 come tax exemption is not given for the senior citizens savings scheme of the post office. So, whatever amount you deposit in the scheme, you wont get any tax relief. Moreover, interest earned on this savings scheme has been made taxable from April 2005. In the last budget, the income tax deduction allowed under section 80L was withdrawn for interest earned on bank deposits, post office deposits and other such small savings instruments.

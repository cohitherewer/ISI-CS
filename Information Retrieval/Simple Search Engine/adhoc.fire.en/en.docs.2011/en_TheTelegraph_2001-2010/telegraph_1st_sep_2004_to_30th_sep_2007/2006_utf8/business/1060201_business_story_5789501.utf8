 Aditya Birla Nuvo profit at Rs 25 crore

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Jan. 31: Aditya Birla Nuvo, the newly formed diversified company in the AV Birla group, has reported net profit of Rs 25.45 crore for the quarter ended December 2005. 

 Last September, the group restructured its businesses through a three-way merger of Indo Gulf Fertiliser, Birla Global Finance with group flagship Indian Rayon into a new diversified company, Aditya Birla Nuvo. 

 Before the reorganisation, Indian Rayon had posted a net profit of Rs 28.65 crore for the October-December quarter in 2004-05. 

 This, in other words, means that the year-on-year earnings under the new entity have got a beating.

 Aditya Birla Nuvo officials, however, explained that the decline in earnings was primarily due to a steep rise in interest cost of the fund the company borrowed to fund increase its stake to 20.73 per cent in Idea Cellular.

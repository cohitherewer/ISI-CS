 Calcutta, March 20: Capgemini Consulting India Pvt Ltd is talking to a few companies in the country for possible acquisitions. It is eyeing firms in the non-voice (without call centres) business process outsourcing as well as financial services sectors.

 Although the company is focusing on the organic route for growth, to supplement the same, Capgemini may acquire firms sooner than later, said Baru Rao, chief executive officer, Capgemini Consulting India Pvt Ltd.

 Capgeminis operations in France employs the highest number of people, which is 21,000, for the company. However, the growth there would be much lower than in India where plans are afoot to ramp up the workforce from 4,128 to 10,000 by the end of 2007. This shows how important India is in our scope of business. It is the fastest growing centre with a growth rate of well over 80 per cent, said Paul Spence, global head of Capgemini Outsourcing Services.

 India seems to be the hotspot destination for global firms planning to acquire companies in the information technology services sector. As Capgemini is on the prowl for such firms, another global company, Atos Origin, is also looking at acquisitions in the country.

 Atos plans to ramp up its employee strength from 1,500 to 2,500 by the end of 2006. Although it is primarily looking at IT companies, it did not rule out BPOs. According to reports, Atos would prefer captive companies like the IT division of existing conglomerates.

 Capgemini, after setting up centres in Mumbai and Bangalore, has come to Calcutta and would increase the headcount here to 500 by the year-end. The Calcutta centre will start with 50 to 60 people, Rao said.

 Meanwhile, the company has recruited 500 people for the entry level from 15-20 institutes, who would be joining at its three locations, he added.

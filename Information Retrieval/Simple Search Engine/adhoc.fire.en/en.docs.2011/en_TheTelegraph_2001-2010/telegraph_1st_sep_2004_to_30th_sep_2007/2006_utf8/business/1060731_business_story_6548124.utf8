 Q amp;A

 Either/survivor

 I have some fixed deposits in a public sector bank in joint holding with my uncle, who died four years ago. These deposits are all held in the either or survivor mode. Im the second holder of those certificates. The bank has renewed the deposits several times in the absence of any intimation. Can I withdraw the money on maturity of those fixed deposits? Do I require to produce any document or proof of death of the first account holder?

 A.K. Mukherjee, Calcutta

Once the fixed deposits are under the either or survivor mode, 

you can receive the amount on maturity of the deposits. However, the bank may 

ask for your uncles death certificate. 

 Interest on NSC

 I purchased NSC for Rs 30,000 in March 2001. It will mature in March 2007. So far, I had shown the accrued interest in my annual income statement for I-T and claimed tax rebate. Do I have to include the accrued interest in my total annual income at the time of maturity also? 

 P.K. Bandyopadhyay, Calcutta

 You are mistaken when you say you have included the interest earned on NSC every year in your annual income. Accrued interest in NSC every year is considered as reinvestment and hence you get a tax benefit on this reinvestment. But you didnt pay income tax on the interest earned. So, you will have to pay the tax on the total interest amount on maturity of the NSC. Since there is no tax deduction at source in case of NSC, you will have to include the interest amount in your total annual income in the year of maturity.

 Bank deposit

 I am a pensioner and also a taxpayer. This month, I have renewed the matured sum of my bank fixed deposit for a period of three years. Do I have to include the accrued interest under income from other sources while filing return for income tax for the assessment year 2007-08. I have submitted a declaration in Form No. 15H to the bank.

 M. Dasgupta, Dankuni

 Yes, you will have to show it in your income tax return for the assessment year 2007-08. Had you renewed the deposit for five years instead of three, you could have claimed a tax deduction up to Rs 1 lakh.

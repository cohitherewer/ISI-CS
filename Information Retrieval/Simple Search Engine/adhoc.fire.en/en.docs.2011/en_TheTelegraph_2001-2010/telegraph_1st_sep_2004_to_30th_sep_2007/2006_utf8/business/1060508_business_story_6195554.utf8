 Warehouse receipt gets a fix

GAURAV CHOUDHURY

Better storage

 New Delhi, May 7: The government has asked the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) to update the standards on warehousing agricultural products, enabling use of warehouse receipts as a bankable instrument in commodities futures.

 Sources said BIS was working on about 31 standards related to storage of agricultural and food products. The BIS is also researching other standards.

 The government has recently tabled the Warehouse (Development and Regulation) Bill that seeks to create a standard system of accrediting warehouses, proper grading and standardisation of the produce and make warehouse receipts a bankable and negotiable instrument.

 Though banks have been accepting warehouse receipts as collateral, they are not in vogue due to their non-negotiability and lack of trust in the receipts issued by private warehouses. 

 Managing director of National Multi-Commodity Exchange (NMCE) Kailash Gupta said the issue of warehouse receipts as negotiable paper would provide an instrument for credit expansion of commercial banks. 

 With this Act all the accredited warehouses by the Warehouse Development and Regulation Authority will be eligible for the storage of the underlying commodities for futures trading. Unlike private godowns, a warehousing company has number of activities and obligations on the goods stored with it. That will bring more confidence in the futures markets participants mind because the Act will enable them to redress any complaint, said Gupta. 

 In India there are 497 central warehouses under Central Warehousing Corporations (CWCs), while the 17 state warehousing corporations have 1,599 storages in its fold. The storage capacities of central warehousing corporations is 10.09 million tonnes and state warehousing corporations 19.52 million tonnes. These warehouses have unutilised capacity in them.

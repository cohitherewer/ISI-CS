 US wary of trade shields

 London, Nov. 28 (Reuters): US Treasury secretary Henry Paulson said on Tuesday trade protectionism was on the rise despite strong global prosperity and warned it was a potentially dangerous trend.

 We cannot allow protectionist elements to stifle our growth, limit our opportunities, and dictate the terms of our engagement with the world, Paulson said in prepared remarks for delivery to the Confederation of British Industrys annual conference.

 Giving in to protectionist sentiment would to send a terrible signal, Paulson said during a joint appearance with British chancellor of the exchequer Gordon Brown.

 The US Treasury chief, who was in London on a quick one-day stop, said that developed nations must beware of sending a signal that they were unwilling to help poorer countries develop their economies. Paulson, who recently authored a joint appeal with Brown to restart the Doha round of free-trade talks, said achieving a successful outcome remained the United States top trade priority.

 He said US elections earlier this month, which resulted in Democrat-controlled US House of Representatives and Senate, made no difference to the US commitment toward reopening the Doha trade talks.

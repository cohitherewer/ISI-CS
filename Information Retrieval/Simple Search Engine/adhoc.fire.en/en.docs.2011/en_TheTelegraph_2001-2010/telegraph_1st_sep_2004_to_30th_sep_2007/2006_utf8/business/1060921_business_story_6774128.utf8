 Basel scare drives banks to market

 New Delhi, Sept. 20: Public sector banks are now in a hurry to tap the capital market as the deadline to implement the stringent capital adequacy norms under the Basel II convention nears. 

 According to the Basel II requirements, banks will have to raise their capital adequacy ratio (CAR) by March 2007 through IPOs, fresh share issue and bonds.

 The Basel II accord, of which India is a signatory, offers new standards for minimum capital requirements for banking operations.

 Some five banks are planning to raise around Rs 4,500-5,000 crore from the markets through a mix of debt and equity.

 The unlisted Indian Bank has set a target to raise about Rs 800-1,200 crore through its IPO early next year. 

 The IPO will be 25 per cent of the restructured capital and 20 per cent post issue, said K.C. Chakrabarty, chairman, Indian Bank. The bank is raising resources to maintain a capital adequacy ratio (CAR) of 12 per cent and meet future expansion in business, he added. 

 Apart from Indian Bank, two more unlisted public sector banks Central Bank of India and United Bank of India are also considering IPOs in early 2007. 

 Sources said some listed banks too were planning a fresh dose of share issue to keep their CAR at 12 per cent levels.

 Canara Bank has plans for a follow-on issue before the end of this calendar year. The bank will ascertain the market sentiment before taking a plunge.

 The bank also has plans to raise Rs 1,380 crore through hybrid capital and overseas bonds to expand its capital base and fund overseas activities. 

 Bank officials said there was considerable scope for divestment since the government holding in the bank is at 73 per cent.

 The bank expects its capital adequacy ratio to be more than 12 per cent after the issues. 

 Karnataka-based Vijaya Bank also plans to increase its upper tier-II capital through a bond issue of Rs 500 crore either next month or in November. 

 The capital will be used to meet the capital adequacy norms as per Basel-II, said Prakash P. Mallya, chairman and managing director of the bank. 

 The banks capital adequacy ratio on June 30 was 11.55 per cent. It had earlier raised Rs 250 crore worth upper tier-II capital. 

 Small banks and the weaker ones, however, have not been able to make use of hybrid instruments because of their low ratings.

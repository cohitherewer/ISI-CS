 New gas pricing formula in pipeline

 New Delhi, Aug. 25 (PTI): Fresh from the controversy over the sale of gas by Mukesh Ambani-run Reliance Industries to Reliance Natural Resources, a company run by his estranged brother Anil, at a very low price, the director general of hydrocarbon (DGH) has suggested price discovery of gas through competitive bidding by consumers rather than sellers fixing a price.

 The DGH, who is part of the committee formed by the oil ministry to formulate transparent guidelines for arriving at the price of gas from all fields, has recommended that bidding should be for single component price applicable at delivery point, official sources said.

 The five-member committee has called for presentations by companies, including RIL, for the finalisation of guidelines. The government had on the recommendation of the DGH rejected the proposal of Reliance Industries ltd to sell gas from its KG Basin field to RNRL at $2.34 per million British thermal unit (mbtu). 

 The DGH had felt that the price was not arrived at on arms-length basis and would lead to heavy revenue loss to the government.

 Sources said the upstream watchdog has suggested that the guidelines should provide a floor price that is indexed to Henry Hub price or price of naphtha or LNG and the government should be represented in the bidding process.

 Where competitive bidding is not followed, deterrent higher floor price should be set, the DGH said. The government intervention should be limited to non-arms length transactions and single bid in competitive bidding.

 The committee is to submit its the report within two months, sources said. After rejecting RIL gas sale to RNRL, the petroleum ministry constituted a committee to formulate transparent guidelines to approve gas price formula/ basis for computing cost petroleum, profit petroleum and royalty.

 Sharp rise in Burren Energy profit

 London, Sept. 18 (Reuters): Burren Energy posted a sharp rise in first-half profits on Monday and named a new chief executive as the countrys third-largest independent oil and gas producer seeks new opportunities to revive slowing growth. 

 The firm, which is moving from a period of rolling appraisal drilling into exploration drilling, said working interest output rose 14 per cent to 33,300 barrels of oil per day (bopd) in the six months to June 30 from a year ago. 

 But its entitlement production fell by 14 per cent to 19,200 bopd, due to the impact of production sharing agreements it has with Congo and Turkmenistan authorities deals which have become increasingly common in recent years. Burren gets less oil as the oil price rises. 

 Net profit rose 69 per cent to $140.2 million (74.7 million) from a year ago and revenue climbed by 42 per cent to $239 million (127.3 million), buoyed by a 38 per cent increase in the average realised price of oil to $60.48 per barrel, it said in a statement. 

 The outlook for Burren remains very exciting. We are part way through an extensive exploration programme in Congo and Turkmenistan which has already yielded some positive results, quot; it said in a statement. 

 We are making sound progress with our water-injection programmes, which have the potential to add significant incremental value in our two core fields. 

 In Congo Burrens principal producing asset is the MBoundi field West Africas second-largest onshore field operated by Maurel et Prom. It lies within the Kouilou exploration permit in which it has a 35 per cent stake. It also owns a 37 per cent share in Congos Noumbi licence. In Turkmenistan Burren has production rights to the producing onshore Burun field. 

 Management change

 Burren said its chief operating officer, Atul Gupta, has been appointed chief executive officer to replace Finian Sullivan, who has been appointed president, an executive position focussed on the acquisition of new core assets for Burren. 

 In our opinion, this indicates that management is having to work (too) hard to find new opportunities and uses for its cash resources, quot; Bridgewell Securities said in a note. 

 The market will be confused and concerned by the management reshuffle and at first glance todays exploration results look insufficiently positive to generate new interest in the stock.

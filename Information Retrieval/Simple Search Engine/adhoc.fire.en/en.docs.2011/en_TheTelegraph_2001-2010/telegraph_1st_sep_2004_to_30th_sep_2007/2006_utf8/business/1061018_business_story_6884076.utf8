 Torrent Power weighs Orissa plant

 SUBRAT DAS 

 Bhubaneswar, Oct. 17: Torrent Power (TPL) of the Rs 3,800-crore Torrent group, a leading player in the pharmaceutical industries, is interested in setting up a 1,000-mw thermal power plant in Orissa at an estimated cost of Rs 4,000 crore. 

 Torrent Power chairman Sudhir Mehta submitted a proposal to chief minister Naveen Patnaik at the state secretariat here today.

 Torrent Power generates around 1,600 mw, which is expected to go up to 3,600 mw if the proposed thermal projects in Gujarat and Orissa come up. 

 The chief minister said appropriate decision would be taken after a thorough examination by the single window system. 

 Already, 13 power companies have signed MoU with the state government to establish thermal plants across the state. 

 The firms include Anil Agarwal-owned Sterlite Energy, Tata Power, Bhushan Energy, CESC, Essar Power, Jindal Photofilms and Visa Power. 

 Having merged Ahmedabad Electricity Company and Surat Electricity Company with itself, Torrent Power is expanding its power generation capacity by setting up a 1,000-mw coal-based power plant in Gujarat. 

 The power plant will be set up at an estimated cost of Rs 4,000 crore.

 Balco heads for arbitration

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 New Delhi, June 30: The core group on disinvestment has decided against selling the government?s residual 49 per cent stake in Balco to Sterlite and will advise the government to settle for arbitration with the metal major. The group is also opposed to a public issue of the residual stake as it would be difficult to come out with an IPO for an unlisted company.

 Sterlite, which has already bought 51 per cent of Balco and is now staking claim on the residual stake, is unlikely to aid the process either by listing the company or otherwise facilitating the sell-off.

 At the meeting, chaired by cabinet secretary B.K.Chaturvedi, law secretary T.K.Vishwanathan proposed acceptance of attorney-general Milon Banerjee?s recommendations against the sale. A consensus then developed and it was decided to go for arbitration if Sterlite fights back. 

 The attorney-general in his written opinion to the group proposed three options: freely negotiate sale of the rump shares with Sterlite or any other third party ?based on market rate? or make an IPO or refrain from any sell-off in public interest and on assessing the profitability of Balco.

 The group has decided to write to Sterlite ? the company had acquired the Balco stake when the NDA government was in power ? saying there is no breach of trust on the part of the government and there is no question of remedy or rectification. 

 The letter will also state that the attorney-general has ruled that the shareholders? agreement on valuation date and call option do not survive besides being in contravention of the law. Sterlite had made the call option on March 19, 2004. 

 Since there was a dispute between the two sides on how they viewed the issue, the group will suggest an amicable negotiation or conciliation or else settle for formal arbitration proceedings. 

 Officials say the AG?s opinion is ?quite clear.? It says in view of sections within the Companies Act, 1956 and Indian Contract Act, 1872, the ?provision of valuation date and call option do not survive and consequently M/s Sterlite cannot exercise option or bind the government of India to accept the same.? 

 To top it up, Banerjee had stated ?it would not be in public interest to sell the shares held by government of India at a price as valued by SBI Caps, divestment at a lesser price would mean loss to the exchequer. To reiterate, it is imperative and advisable for the government to obtain a fair valuation on a current date to ensure that the best price is secured for the shares, if at all the government decides to divest.? 

 The Balco sell-off process has been shrouded in controversy from the onset. When the BJP government sold the 51 per cent stake for a mere Rs 550 crore four years back, the Opposition cried foul. 

 The price was on the basis of a valuation by the income tax authorities that pegged Balco at Rs 1,100 crore. Kapil Sibal, then a Congress member in the Upper House, had protested the sell-off saying that the value of the company was anything in the region of Rs 2,300 crore to Rs 4,500 crore.

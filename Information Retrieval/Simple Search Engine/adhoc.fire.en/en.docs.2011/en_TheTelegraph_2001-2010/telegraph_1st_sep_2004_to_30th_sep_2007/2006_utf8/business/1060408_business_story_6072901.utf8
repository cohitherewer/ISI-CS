 Two-in-one duty treat in export

 New Delhi, April 7: The government has introduced a streamlined duty-free import authorisation scheme for easy access to inputs required for exports. It has merged two earlier schemes and made the export promotion capital goods (EPCG) scheme more flexible in the new policy.

 The duty-free import authorisation scheme facilitates importing of inputs before exporting a product. It also allows transferability of scrip once the export obligation is completed. Imports made under this authorisation will be exempt from payment of basic and additional customs duties, education cess, anti-dumping and safeguard levy. The scheme will come into effect from May 1.

 Commerce minister Kamal Nath said even though some crucial inputs for exports are allowed to import without payment of customs duty under the advance licensing scheme, exporters generally do not import them because of lack of economies of scale and are forced to source them locally at higher prices. The existing duty exemption schemes have been of little help in such cases because of design limitations.

 To address the issue, the salient features of the advanced licensing scheme and duty-free replenishment certificate (which allows transferability of import entitlements) have been clubbed to evolve the new duty-free import authorisation scheme.

 The EPCG scheme has been made more flexible in the conditions relating to maintenance of average export performance. Exporters had complained that they were finding it difficult to maintain average export performance and undertake additional export obligations either because of sickness or international market dynamics or technology changes. 

 As an export facilitation measure, it has been decided to extend the export obligation fulfilment by a period of two years based on certain conditions.

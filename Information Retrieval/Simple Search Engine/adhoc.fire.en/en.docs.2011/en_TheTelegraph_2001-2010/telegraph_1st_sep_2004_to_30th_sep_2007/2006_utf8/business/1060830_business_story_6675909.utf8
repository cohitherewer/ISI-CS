 Breathing space for oil retailers

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Aug. 29: There has been some let-up in the relentless surge in international crude prices. The Indian basket of imports has come down to $67.57 per barrel from the peak of $73.96 in mid-August.

 However, the public sector oil companies, which are losing money on the sale of petroleum products, are keeping their fingers crossed and watching whether the declining trend continues. 

 A senior Indian Oil official said, It is a welcome development, but only if the declining trend continues can we expect any respite.

 The oil companies have demanded an increase in the prices of petrol, diesel, LPG and kerosene, but the government has to take political considerations into account before going in for any price hike. 

 The oil companies claim they are losing Rs 5 per litre on petrol and Rs 6 per litre on diesel apart from the huge drain caused by the subsidy on LPG and kerosene. They expect their under-recoveries to shoot up to Rs 81,000 crore from the Rs 73,500-crore projected when prices were increased in June. The government is expected to review prices on September 1.

 Petroleum minister Murli Deora has already written to finance minister P. Chidambaram to reduce excise duty by Re 1 per litre on petrol and diesel to provide some relief to oil companies. The government, which plans to issue oil bonds worth Rs 28,000 crore, could go in for raising the amount to bail out the oil companies which have plunged into a loss.

 Similarly, ONGC, which has been asked to shell out Rs 24,000 crore to Indian Oil, BPCL and HPCL, may be told to raise its contribution.

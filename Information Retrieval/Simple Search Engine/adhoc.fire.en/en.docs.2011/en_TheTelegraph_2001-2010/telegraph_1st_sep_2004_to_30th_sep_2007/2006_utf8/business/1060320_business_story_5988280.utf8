 RPL to serve global markets

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Calcutta, March 19: When the Reliance refinery was set up in Jamnagar in 1999, it turned the country into a net exporter of petroleum products from an importer.

 Nine years down the line, the responsibility to serve international markets by making India a refining hub will be passed on to the newly established Reliance Petroleum Ltd (RPL).

 The parent ? Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) ? will now focus on the domestic market, which will be dotted with Reliance petrol pumps soon.

 RIL has already set up 1200 pumps and is opening two to three new ones every day. By 2008, it will have 5000 pumps across the country.

 In the same year, RPLs new 27-million-tonne export-oriented refinery at Jamnagar would be up and ready.

 Last year, RIL exported 10.5 million tonnes of refined products. With an 8 per cent growth in economy expected to whet the appetite for petro products in India, RIL will have its hands full in the domestic market.

 The company will also have to serve its own retail outlets. As a result, its share of revenue from exports is also expected to come down.

 Moreover, its supplies to the PSUs will also come down in the future as it will focus more on its own retail business.

 The new refinery would export 75 per cent of its products as it is located within a special economic zone.

 Based on the configuration of the proposed refinery, RPL plans to maximise the output of value-added petroleum products and take advantage of the available opportunities in global markets.

 It intends to leverage on the expected high product specifications that meet the quality requirements in developed markets.

 RPL proposes to target the export markets of the US for gasoline and alkylates and those of the Europe and the Americas for diesel and jet fuel.

 The company intends to sell petroleum coke and sulphur in the domestic market from the new refinery.

 RPL is being designed to handle various types of crude, especially low-priced heavy crude. With a complex engineering process, it also plans to produce value-added products.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Hands full

 Mumbai, Jan. 6: Chennai-based Shasun Chemicals amp; Drugs Ltd, which is focussing on contract research for growth, today announced that it has issued a letter of intent to the Rhodia Group of France for acquiring the pharmaceutical customs synthesis business of Rhodia Pharma Solutions (RPS) for an undisclosed sum. 

 Shasun said the transaction includes Rhodia Pharmas development and custom manufacturing services catering to clients in the US, Europe and Asia. It also includes manufacturing sites at Dudley and Annan in the UK. 

 Rhodia SA will sell part of its loss-making Rhodia Pharma Solutions division to Shasun, shedding a business it bought in 2000 for over $540 million when it embarked on a debt-piling takeover spree.

 According to Shasun, the RPS buyout will give it access to superior technologies with patents. While these technologies are part of the transaction, all products and building blocks related to these technologies are also part of the transaction, it added.

 A company statement said both the parties have entered into an exclusive agreement to progress towards the final sale and purchase deal, which is expected to be completed before March 31, subject to satisfactory due diligence and regulatory approvals.

 Talking about the buyout, Shasun CEO N. Govindarajan said, The proposed acquisition is in line with Shasuns strategy to enhance its global presence in the APIs, custom synthesis and contract manufacturing. Shasun will be in a better position to serve pharmaceutical industry clients throughout the drug life-cycle by offering services for pre-launch, launch and post-launch supply and also services later in the life-cycle. It will help Shasun expand its customer base across innovator and emerging pharmaceutical companies.

 While custom synthesis business involves producing drug compounds according to customers specification, Shasun has recently announced its intention to focus on contract research and manufacturing services.

 Rhodia had been looking to sell Pharma Solutions, which provides drugmakers with chemical products to develop treatments, as part of its restructuring.

 The French chemicals company has been selling assets, issuing shares and renegotiating credit lines as it seeks to cut debt and return to profit this year.

 Rhodia will keep the units paracetamol, aspirin and phosphate calcium activities, which have reached break-even, a Rhodia spokeswoman said. It is the end of a tough period, she said.

 Rhodia Pharma Solutions has been struggling with over-capacity. In the second quarter of last year, Rhodia took a 101 million euro ($122 million) write-off on the unit.

 Bonds lure players from shares

 A way out

 There are some very curious things about the recent market meltdown. 

 The consensus is that the trigger for the crash was the fear of higher inflation in the US, which raised the probability that the US Federal Reserve still has some way to go before it calls a halt to raising interest rates. That?s rather plausible, except for one thing. If higher inflation and higher interest rates are the problem, why would investors buy long-term bonds? In fact, long-term bonds are avoided like the plague when interest rates are on an upward journey, because they fall the most. Any investor in Indian debt funds would know all about that as the net asset values of bond funds have dived in the last couple of years.

 So it?s strange that investors scared by higher inflation have invested so much in US long-term bonds that its yield has fallen from a high of 5.18 per cent to 5.05 per cent. (Yields move inversely to the price of bonds, which means the price of bonds has increased because of new demand.).

 The received wisdom has so far been that globalisation will keep a lid on inflation in the developed world, as cheap manufactures made in China and cheap services supplied from India flood the markets. Sure, crude oil prices have moved beyond $70 a barrel, but then the world economy managed to absorb the hike in prices from $30 to $70 a barrel quite well. As a matter of fact, since oil prices had already gone up so much, the percentage rise this year may not be that high. Again, while commodity prices have gone up and that pushes up the price of raw materials, finished goods prices would continue to remain low because of the increased competition from low-wage countries.

 Should a small uptick in inflation change that theory? Perhaps not. 

 One explanation has been that the US Fed is actually trying to engineer a soft landing for asset prices and the talk about inflation is merely a ruse to raise rates. But that theory too does not clarify why investors are lapping up long-term US bonds, the price of which would fall if interest rates are raised.

 That is why some commentators have said investors are actually more worried about slowing growth than about inflation. The logic is that higher oil prices, higher commodity prices and higher interest rates would all slow growth, thus making bonds more attractive than stocks and commodities. This explanation is all the more plausible because the US housing market is weakening. So far, the housing market has been a big driver of consumption in the US as investors wring out home equity, which essentially means that they borrow against the higher value of their homes. Lower mortgage payments as interest rates have gone down have also put more cash in home-owners? hands. With that benign scenario unwinding, consumers could spend less and growth could slow.

 But the latest OECD forecast says both the US and Japan will enjoy solid growth this year and fall only slightly in 2007. That leaves the argument that liquidity is going down as the Japanese central bank stops its policy of supplying huge amounts of money to the market. But even then Japanese interest rates will continue to remain very low, which means that although the huge profits from the ?carry trade? ? borrowing in Japan to fund asset buys elsewhere ? may come down, borrowing in yen will continue to remain cheap.

 So what?s the explanation? It?s probably the simple one that investors decided to take some profits off the table, rotating their money into less risky bonds and developed country stocks. That?s why the crash is probably due to overbought markets and not any fundamental change.

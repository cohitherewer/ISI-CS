 Candover Investments buys 60% of Ferretti

 Smooth sale

 Milan/London, Oct. 28 (Reuters): Private equity fund Candover Investments Plc said on Friday it had bought 60 per cent of Italian luxury motor yachts group Ferretti SpA, in a deal, which will leave founder Norberto Ferretti at the helm. 

 The deal is worth around 1.7 billion euros (1.14 billion), a source close to the operation told Reuters earlier. 

 Ferretti, who is chairman of the group, along with the companys current management and former owners Permira Funds will hold the remaining 40 per cent of the prestigious yacht-building house founded in 1968. 

 We are delighted to be taking a majority stake with Permira and Ferrettis founder retaining a significant stake in the new equity structure, Aldo Maccari, director and head of Italy for Candover Partners Ltd, said in a statement. Candover did not give a value for the deal. 

 Ferrettis sleek motor-yacht brands include Pershing and Riva. 

 There is still so much room to grow, in a strongly expanding sector, Maccari told Reuters. 

 The acquisition is expected to be completed by the end of 2006, with debt and mezzanine financing underwritten by the Royal Bank of Scotland, Candover said. 

 US investment bank Merrill Lynch advised Permira on the sale. 

 Unusually for a private equity deal the new majority owners are not expected to change the management or the direction of the company after completing the deal. 

 Its like a relay race, they (Candover) take the baton and they move it forward without really changing the management strategy or anything else, said a source familiar with the deal. 

 Its an orderly transition with the previous fund remaining invested in the company, the source said. 

 This sale does conclude the build-up phase for Ferretti and now we are going into a harvesting phase on the investment made, the source said.

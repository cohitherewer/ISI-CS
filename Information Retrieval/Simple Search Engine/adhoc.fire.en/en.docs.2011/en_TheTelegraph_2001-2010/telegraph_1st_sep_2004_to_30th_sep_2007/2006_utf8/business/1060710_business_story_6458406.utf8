 Tatas hold parleys in Bangla

 Dhaka, July 9 (PTI): The Tatas, apparently frustrated over Bangladesh delaying a decision on its $3-billion investment plan, held talks with senior ministers today to review the state of its proposal.

 Tatas had set a May 31 deadline for Dhaka to decide on its proposed investments. 

 Tata Sons ED Alan Rosling, along with Manzer Husain, the Dhaka resident director, have discussed the issue with Bangladesh minister Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan. 

 Sources said Tata officials wanted to know the governments mind after a lengthy study and revised submission of plans over gas pricing and other issues. 

 According to reports, Bhuiyan said the project requires a consensus among political parties. Tata officials will meet other leaders over the next few days, sources said. 

 If it comes through, the project will be the largest foreign direct investment in Bangladesh so far.

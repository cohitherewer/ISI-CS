 Finance ministry to judge stake in cell duo

 Put on hold

 Mumbai, July 9: The foreign investment proposals of Anil Ambanis Reliance Communications Ltd and Sunil Mittals Bharti Airtel have been lobbed to the finance ministry for approval.

 The Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) has forwarded them to the finance ministry.

 Reliance Communications is seeking permission to raise the foreign stake to 74 per cent ? a level the government had permitted for the telecom sector last November. Bharti is seeking to reorder the direct and indirect shareholding of its overseas investors.

 Bharti had applied to the FIPB a couple of months back as the foreign shareholding in the company, directly and indirectly, exceeded 49 per cent of its paid-up equity capital. It had urged the FIPB to make amendments to allow the foreign/foreign institutional investor/OCB/non-resident Indians to hold up to 74 per cent, amounting to Rs 1,850 crore, of its equity capital of up to Rs 2,500 crore.

 While the FIPB has okayed the proposal, it has forwarded it to the finance minister for his approval. The board has agreed to foreign investment being routed through 10 entities, nine of which are based in Mauritius. These include Pastel Ltd, Brentwood Investment Holdings Ltd, Palmobile Corporation Ltd, Coment (Mauritius) Ltd, New York Life International India Fund Mauritius Ltd, International Finance Corporation, Washington, Indian Continent Investment Ltd, Russell AIF India Telecom Ltd, AIF (Mauritius) India Telecom Ltd and Seejay Cellular Ltd.

 Current regulations of the government have capped the foreign investment in telecom companies at 74 per cent. 

 These include foreign direct investments, foreign institutional investors and others. Up to 49 per cent of the FDI comes under the automatic route.

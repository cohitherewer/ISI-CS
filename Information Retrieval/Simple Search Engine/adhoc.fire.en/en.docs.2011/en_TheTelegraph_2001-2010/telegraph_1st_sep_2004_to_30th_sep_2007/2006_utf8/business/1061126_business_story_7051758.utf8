 Calcutta, Nov. 25: The Export-Import Bank of India has raised yen loan equivalent to $230 million through its second Samurai Bond issue, according to the banks executive director S. R. Rao. 

 The countrys premiere export finance institution entered the Tokyo market with its second Samurai Bond offering on October 27. The 5-year Yen 26-billion issue was priced at 70 basis points above the London Inter-bank Offered Rate (Libor).

 Exim Bank has also entered into a $100-million loan agreement with the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC). 

 The loan tie-up is part of the ongoing Asian Exim Banks Forum (AEBF) in Tokyo. The AEBF is a regional body of export credit agencies from five countries India, China, Japan, Malaysia and Australia created in 1996. 

 Under the agreement, JBIC will provide yen equivalent of $100 million to Exim Bank at a competitive price on a long-term basis. The fund will be used to lend to Indian borrowers who have business relations with Japan, such as Indo-Japanese joint ventures and subsidiaries both in India as well as overseas, Rao, who was here to attend a seminar on Globalisation through overseas investment, said . 

 Bilateral trade between India and Japan has been growing steadily. Indian exports to Japan (mainly gems and jewellery, iron ore, marine products and textile products) amounted to $2.5 billion in 2005-06, while Indian imports from Japan in the same period (mainly machinery, electronic goods, instruments and equipment) amounted to $3.6 billion.

 Tips to banks on service charge

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Signs of change

 Mumbai, Sept. 15: The ripoff has got to stop.

 That is the short and sharp message that a working group set up by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has sent out to banks which stand accused of resorting to some sharp practices while slapping an array of charges on their customers for banking services.

 The report submitted by the committee contains suggestions to banks that they should levy reasonable charges on 27 basic services relating to deposit and loan accounts, remittance facilities and cheque collection.

 The group suggested that lower charges should be fixed for individuals over non-individual entities and that there should be lower rates for special categories of individuals such as senior citizens, rural customers and pensioners.

 The working group also asked banks to provide individual customers complete information on all charges applicable to basic services and urged them to notify any proposed change in charges in a timely manner. It also said that some charges should not be levied by the banks in certain cases.

 The recommendation of the five-member group, headed by N. Sadasivan, banking ombudsman, Maharashtra and Goa, comes in a deregulated banking atmosphere, where banks have the autonomy to levy various charges.

 The group recommended two factors that should be considered as the parameters for identifying basic banking services the nature of transactions and value of transactions. It defined low value transactions for cheque collection and remittance up to Rs 10,000 in each case and up to $500 for forex transactions. Based on this methodology, it enlisted 27 services as basic. These include cheque book facility, issuing of pass book, duplicate pass book, ATM cards, debit cards, balance enquiry, account closure, demand drafts, pay orders, telegraphic transfers, payment by electronic clearing services among others.

 It said that in some cases, banks adopt deficient/capricious methods for recovering service charges. According to the group, there are instances where the balances in accounts are fully wiped out by successive recoveries of penalties for non-maintenance of minimum balance. In some cases, the shortfall in the account balance is caused by a transaction, including a debit for a charge, that the bank itself has originated. 

 To avoid this, banks may ensure that each such transaction and the resultant balance is intimated to the customer so that the customer may remedy the shortfall. Only thereafter, banks may consider recovering the penalty for the shortfall.

 The group also recommended that certain charges should be discontinued. These include charge for absence of any transaction in any quarter, charges of erroneous transactions wherein banks impose cheque bouncing charges even if the inward cheques are wrongly returned or returned only for technical reasons such as signature mismatch. 

The committee also felt that charges for balance enquiry 

and closure of accounts were also not justified.

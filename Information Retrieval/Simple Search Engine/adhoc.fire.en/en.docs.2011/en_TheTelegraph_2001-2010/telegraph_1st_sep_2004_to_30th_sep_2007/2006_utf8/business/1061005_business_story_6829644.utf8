 Difficult times for LG.Philips

 Seoul, Oct. 4 (Reuters): Flat-screen maker LG.Philips LCD is expected to report a loss for the second quarter in a row, as it struggles with weak prices and high costs for its mainstay TV panels. LG.Philips, the worlds biggest maker of large-sized liquid crystal display (LCD) panels in 2005, is likely to continue to bleed red ink until early 2007, despite its efforts to cut spending and boost output of higher-margin monitor panels. 

 The South Korea-based company has been feeling the brunt of heavy depreciation costs and inventories, while home rival Samsung Electronics and Taiwans AU Optronics enjoy growing demand for LCD panels for televisions and monitors. 

 LG.Philips has a structural problem and it will take some time to fix it, said Michael Min, an analyst at Korea Investment amp; Securities. The company is failing to control costs and has a relatively weak client base. 

 Analysts estimate about a 10 per cent fall in LG.Philips average panel prices in the third quarter, after an 18 per cent slide in the second quarter. 

 LG.Philips, a joint venture between South Koreas LG Electronics and Dutch company Philips, is expected to report on Tuesday a net loss of 318.2 billion won ($335.8 million) for the quarter ended in September, according to a survey of analysts. 

 This compares with a 47.5 billion won profit a year earlier and a record 321.5 billion loss posted in the second quarter. 

 Inventory write-down as well as hefty depreciation costs likely further bruised the companys earnings last quarter, analysts said. 

 Sales are expected at 2.46 trillion won, compared with 2.42 trillion won a year ago and 2.09 trillion in the second quarter. Investors will also tune in to find out any details on an expected sale of Philipss 32.9 per cent stake in the LCD joint venture.

 Calcutta, May 12: Small-scale firms promise big business for credit rating agencies.

 There are 3.3 million registered small and tiny units in the country and if we consider the number of unregistered firms, the total number will be more than a crore. This translates into a potential market of Rs 10,000 crore for rating registered SSIs only.

 As a result, credit rating agencies are going all the way to grab a chunk of this pie.

 In Bengal, there are 73,000 registered units and 1,30,000 non-registered ones. In 2005, however, only 62 SSIs have got themselves rated.

 Crisil Ltd, in which Standard amp; Poors has picked up a stake, said it would offer a discount up to 62 per cent in fees to the members of the Federation of Small and Medium Industries (Fosmi) and National Small Industries Corporation Ltd (NSIC) if they get themselves rated by the agency.

 This discount is over and above the 75 per cent subsidy that the Union ministry of small-scale industry (SSI) gives to individual units via NSIC to get their performance and creditworthiness rated, said a Crisil representative at an MoU signing ceremony between Fosmi and NSIC in the city today. Under the arrangement, NSIC will create awareness about its schemes and the need for performance and credit rating.

 To rev up the small-scale industry, which contributes 35 per cent of the gross domestic product, more than 10 per cent of the countrys total exports and generates employment only next to the agriculture sector, the government has announced a special package for it in Union budget for 2004-05 and introduced the Small and Medium Enterprises Development Bill, which is still under consideration in Parliament.

 Under the package, commercial banks were asked to double their advances to the SSI units to Rs 1,35,200 crore by 2009-10 from Rs 67,600 crore in 2004-05. Banks were asked to do so by giving a preferential rate of interest on the basis of the units credit rating.

 NSIC was appointed as the nodal agency for the performance and credit rating of small and medium enterprises. The corporation tied up with almost every credit rating agency in the country, including Dun amp; Bradstreet, Crisil, Icra, Omicra, Smera, Fitch and Care. Among these, Sidbi-promoted Smera has a tie-up with 15 public sector banks and charges lower fees than the others.

 Banks and financial institutions are also insisting on credit rating of SSI borrowers to ensure that the loan doesnt turn bad in future. Earlier, banks would have to do a due diligence on the borrowers credit worthiness and it involved a cost. Now, if a reputed rating agency does this job, it saves cost and time for the bank. And the bank can also lend a rated borrower at a preferential rate, say 1 per cent below its prime lending rate, said an Allahabad Bank official.

 Besides, with the implementation of the Basel II norms, banks will emphasise more on third-party credit rating to assess and provide for the capital charge against the associated risks, he added. 

 A third-party credit rating also improves the ability of an SSI to bargain for a better rate of interest from banks and other lending institutions and increases its credibility to importers, said an official from Dun amp; Bradstreet. Many potential buyers in foreign countries seek information about exporters from India and often we cant give them the feedback as we dont have a comprehensive database of SSIs here, she added.

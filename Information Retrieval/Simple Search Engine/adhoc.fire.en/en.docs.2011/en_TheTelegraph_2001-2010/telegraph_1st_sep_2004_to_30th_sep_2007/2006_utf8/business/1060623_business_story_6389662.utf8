 Tata Steel ready for equity churn

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, June 22: Tata Sons is likely to raise its stake in Tata Steel to over 27 per cent by subscribing to a preferential issue that the steelmaker aims to float to fund its growth plans. The holding company of the Tata group now owns 20.04 per cent in Tata Steel.

 Tata Steel is planning to raise Rs 6,500 crore of long-term finance to fund its growth plans.

 In a notice sent to its shareholders, the company said this amount may be raised through a combination of instruments that include public or private offering in domestic or international markets.

 The speculation is that the company may also come up with a rights issue. Tata Steel has informed the shareholders that in the event of a preferential allotment of securities to Tata Sons, it would comprise an issue of shares in one financial year not exceeding 5 per cent of the then prevailing paid-up share capital of the company and an issue of warrants in the year. The warrant holder will have the option to exercise them to subscribe to ordinary shares only after April 1, 2007.

 The preferential issue is one of several fund-raising options that Tata Steel is considering. It plans to move a resolution in this regard at the annual general meeting scheduled for July 5.

 Tata Steel is planning to establish three greenfield facilities in Orissa, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand with an aggregate capacity of 23 million tonnes. These projects and other strategic acquisition opportunities could see the company making an estimated investment of Rs 70,000 crore in the next decade, chairman Ratan Tata said in his letter to shareholders.

 The company is also planning to set up a steel plant in Bangladesh with a capacity of 2.4 million tonnes even as it is looking to acquire other international steelmakers. It had earlier acquired Singapore-based NatSteel in 2005 and invested in Millenium Steel, Thailand.

 With such investments lined up, Tata Steel is planning to raise its authorised capital from Rs 850 crore to Rs 2,000 crore as these plans will necessitate the infusion of internal and external funds at different points of time.

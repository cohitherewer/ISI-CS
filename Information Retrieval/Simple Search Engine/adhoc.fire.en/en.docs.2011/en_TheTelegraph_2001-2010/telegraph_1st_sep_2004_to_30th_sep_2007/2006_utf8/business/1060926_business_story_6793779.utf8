 NRL draws energy from outlets 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 25: Numaligarh Refinery Ltd, the subsidiary of Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL), has received encouraging response to its retail outlets.

 The company has set up 59 outlets so far. 

 Thirty six of them are located in the northeastern region.

 Numaligarh Refinery has branded its outlets as energy stations. 

 Its outlet at Jorabat in Meghalaya was the highest selling one in the entire eastern region.

 Numaligarh Refinerys retail foray comes at a time when the company posted its best ever financial result in 2005-06 since commencement of its commercial operations in 2000. 

 This was revealed by company chairman Ashok Sinha, who is also the chairman and managing director of BPCL, at the annual general meeting held recently.

 The company has posted a profit after tax of Rs 449 crore its highest ever despite underrecoveries in the sale of petrol and diesel.

 The companys gross turnover was Rs 5,820 crore last fiscal, up by 35 per cent from the previous year. Its profit after tax in 2004-05 was Rs 409 crore.

 The higher level of profit is attributable to combination of factors like growth in turnover due to higher realisation of prices, improved product mix, optimisation of operations, stringent cost control measures and savings in interest cost.

 The refinery processed 2.13 metric tonnes of crude and evacuated 1.95 million metric tonnes of products during the year 2005-06, Sinha added.

 It has declared a 31 per cent post tax dividend, contributing Rs 17.25 crore to the state exchequer in 2005-06.

 Last fiscal, it also completed a Rs 297-crore motor spirit project. This will enable Numaligarh Refinery to produce 185,000 tonnes motor spirit annually and enhance cooking gas production by 21 tonnes.

 Delist rule tweak to help investors

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 For a fair price

 Mumbai, Nov. 23: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) today mooted certain key changes in the existing guidelines on delisting of shares. The latest Sebi move is aimed at providing a fair price to retail investors of delisting companies. 

 In its revised draft regulations, Sebi suggested doing away with the current book-building route for determining the price at which shareholders of delisting companies tender their shares. 

 The regulator said such a practice leads to cartelisation and gives disproportionate power to those holding major chunk of shares.

 According to the proposed norms, the offer price would not be less than floor price plus 25 per cent premium or fair price plus 25 per cent premium, whichever is higher.

 Floor price would be determined by high and low of closing prices of securities and other parameters like return on net worth, while fair price would be ascertained by an accredited credit rating agency.

 At present, when companies want to delist, the price is arrived at by a method of book building. 

 The book-building process determines the rate at which maximum number of shares are tendered. While eligibility to participate in the book-building process extended only to demat shareholders, there is an option available to the promoters to accept or reject the price determined by the book-building process.

 Sebi, however, said in the current process of price discovery through book building, disproportionate powers were enjoyed by public share holders owning a major chunk. Moreover, there is the possibility of frivolous bids which could destabilise the delisting offer.

 Sebi also suggests that promoters would not be allowed to delist companies from bourses if promoters stake is not likely to increase above 90 per cent even after the tendering of shares.

 In case a company has a minimum public shareholding of 10 per cent under the listing agreement, promoters stake has to go up above 96 per cent after tendering of shares.

 HDFC relief

 In a major relief for HDFC Bank, Sebi today said it could open fresh demat accounts. 

 In April this year, through an ad interim ex-parte order, the market regulator had directed HDFC Bank not to open fresh demat accounts as it failed to adhere to the know your client (KYC) norms laid down by Sebi, thereby facilitating opening of demat accounts in fictitious/benami names.

 This came as part of its investigations into the demat scam where investors opened several demat accounts to corner shares from initial public offerings.

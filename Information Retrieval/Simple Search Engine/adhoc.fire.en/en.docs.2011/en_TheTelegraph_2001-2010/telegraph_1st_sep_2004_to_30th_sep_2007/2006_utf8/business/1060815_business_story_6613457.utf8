 JSW Steel coal deal in six months

 Mumbai, Aug. 14 (PTI): Sajjan Jindal-promoted JSW Steel, which is looking for coal mines overseas, today said it will take another six months to finalise the deal.

 The company, the second largest speciality and carbon steel maker in the country, had earlier said it was on the lookout for coal mines in Canada, Australia and Mozambique.

 We have identified some coal mines and the talks are going on. However, it will take another six months to make a final announcement, JSW Steel director (finance) M.V.S. Seshagiri Rao said.

 The company, which produces 2.5 million tonnes of steel per annum, intends to jack up its yearly capacity to seven million tonnes in the next three years, which will require an investment of Rs 5,000 crore.

 The first phase of the expansion programme is scheduled to be over by September this year, which will raise its capacity to 3.8 million tonnes per annum. Acquiring coal mines would help the company ensure a steady supply of coal and to isolate itself from the vagary of price hikes. It would also help the company to stay a few steps ahead among its peers and reduce production cost, Rao said.

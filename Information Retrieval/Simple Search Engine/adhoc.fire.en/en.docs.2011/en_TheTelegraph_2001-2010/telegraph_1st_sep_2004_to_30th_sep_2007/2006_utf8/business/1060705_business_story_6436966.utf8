 Huawei lists R amp;D plans

 Bangalore, July 4 (PTI): Huawei Technologies will scale up the overseas R amp;D centre located here ? its largest outside China ? at an investment of $100 million. The company will ramp up the number of software engineers from 1,200 to 2,000 within three years.

 Half of the kitty will be spent towards building a one-million square feet software campus at Whitefield here, where Huawei has bought a 20-acre plot, said George Huang, chief operating officer of Huawei Technologies India Pvt Ltd, Huaweis R amp;D wing.

 However, the company is concerned over the delay in its planned foray into the Indian telecom equipment market as the Centre is yet to approve the proposal.

 Huang said the government has not yet approved the proposal seeking to establish a telecom manufacturing facility and a trading licence, which have impacted the companys plans of foraying into the fast-growing Indian telecom market.

 May be not so quickly what we had imagined before, he said on the delay in getting the green signal.

 According to Huawei Technologiess officials, Huawei Telecommunications India submitted its proposal to the government seeking permission to set up the manufacturing facility at an investment of $64 million in March last year.

 From our side, there is no issue. We have provided the required information. We are hopeful it is approved as soon as possible, Huang said.

 There are some impacts on our expansion plan. I hope the government can resolve the issue as far as possible, he added.

 Although, the government has not given any reason for the delay in clearing Huaweis proposal, it could be due to security concerns and lack of clarity on policy towards FDI by Chinese firms. He said the government has not sought any additional action or raised special concerns vis-?-vis its proposal.

 Huang also said the R amp;D centre here, working on customised products and solutions, has recently started engaging in optical transmission area as well. While the company says wages are increasing in India, the inflation is reasonable given the contribution of employees.

 Fuel prices stay put, Indian Oil suffers

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Kannan: Being practical 

 Mumbai, April 5: Indian Oil Corporation is likely to take a hit of Rs 2,224 crore this month, as retail prices of various petroleum products, including liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), kerosene, motor spirits (MS) and high speed diesel (HSD), have not been revised. 

 Last fiscal, IOC and its subsidiary, IBP, had reported a combined shortfall of Rs 7,996 crore.

 With crude oil remaining firm and the government not raising the prices of petroleum products, IOC is suffering a loss of Rs 14.17 per litre in kerosene and Rs 199.63 per LPG cylinder. 

 Though LPG prices have softened and the loss has come down from Rs 247 per cylinder last year, IOC fears that if the current trend in under recovery and under realisation continues, it will have to take a hit of Rs 24,000 crore this year. 

 Last fiscal, the corporation lost over Rs 7,100 crore with under recovery in LPG and kerosene put at Rs 2,829 crore and under realisation in MS and HSD put at Rs 4,303 crore.

 IOC is facing this shortfall at a time when the retail business is becoming more competitive with the presence of aggressive private players like Reliance Industries Ltd.

 The picture at IBP Ltd, the stand-alone marketing company, is also no different. It took a hit of Rs 864 crore last year.

 Briefing newspersons here today, N.G. Kannan, director (marketing), IOC, said last fiscal was full of challenges and turbulence for the company as the retail sale of petroleum products was down by about 4 per cent. 

 A major factor which contributed to this was lower diesel sales, which was down by 8 lakh tonnes.

 Also, IOCs retail outlets had reported a drop in sales. Hence, the company is not aggressive about opening retail outlets for petrol and diesel.

 Though it plans to invest Rs 1,100 crore this year in retail operations, Kannan said new outlets will be opened depending on the competitive environment.

 For 2006-07, IOC has planned a capital expenditure of Rs 2,350 crore. Of this, Rs 750 crore is for LPG, Rs 350 crore for operations and others will account for Rs 150 crore. In retail, Rs 500 crore will be spent on new outlets and 1,000 Kisan Seva Kendras and Rs 75 crore on automation at 500 retail outlets.

 The company will spend Rs 525 crore for third party certification, expansion of Xtracare and Swagat outlet network and upgradation programmes.

 IOC will spend another Rs 750 crore for the LPG business, which includes Rs 47 crore on the procurement of LPG equipment and Rs 40 crore on two new Indane bottling plants.

 It will also spend Rs 150 crore on capacity augmentation and LPG distributorship, Kannan said.

 The company has set a capital outlay of Rs 350 crore for operations, including Rs 170 crore on four tap of points at Ratlam, Trichy, Chittorgarh and Jasidih along with two new terminals at Ennure, Tikri and Dahej, he added. IOC will spend Rs 100 crore on new depots at Mandir Hasaud, Lal Kaun and Rourkela.

 The company has planned a 310-km long Chennai-Bangalore pipeline. 

 This pipeline would cost around Rs 290 crore, Kannan said.

 Moran Tea now in McLeod cup

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta Dec 1: McLeod Russel India will acquire 72.38 per cent of Moran Tea Company India from Moran Holding Plc for Rs 41.49 crore, consolidating its position as the worlds largest tea plantation company.

 UK-based Moran Holding is a 130-year old company, which is into freight forwarding and tea. Trans Global Group, the logistics company, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Moran Holding and has a turnover of more than 32 million. With this transaction, Moran Holding is exiting the tea business.

 McLeod managing director Aditya Khaitan said the acquisition was part of a strategy to become a 100-million-kg company by 2008. He said Moran Teas four gardens in Assam produced 4.3 million kg of good quality tea every year, taking McLeods output to 75 million kg a year.

 McLeod is keen on more acquisitions in India and is expected to announce its next catch shortly. The company will pay a non-compete fee of Rs 6.5 crore to Moran Holding and seek the approval of its shareholders for the acquisition.

 McLeod and its associates also plan to make an open offer to take 20 per cent more of Moran Tea for around Rs 11.5 crore.

 The company paid Rs 273 for each of the 1,520,000 shares of Moran Tea it acquired from Moran Holding. The shares have a face value of Rs 10.

 McLeod intends to use part of the Rs 118.88 crore raised through qualified institutional placements for acquiring gardens.

 The company is interested in an acquisition in Kenya, the first by an Indian company, to cater better to its clients which are also buyers in the African country. 

 The company expects prices to go up by Rs 9-10 per kg this fiscal. Khaitan said lower carry forward tea, stagnant production, a 3 per cent rise in consumption plus higher exports were likely to push up prices after October.

 The Assam gardens of Doom Dooma Tea, which was acquired by McLeod from Hindustan Lever in January 2006 and became wholly-owned subsidiary of McLeod from April, fetched a high price of Rs 80 per kg in the first half. The realisations are expected to hover at around Rs 78 for the rest of the year.

 Jet fuel turns costlier

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 1: State-run oil firms today increased prices of aviation turbine fuel by about 2 per cent or Rs 900 a kilolitre.

 The price rise, in line with global hikes, comes even as airlines have started announcing traditional monsoon discounts on fares. Most airlines are unlikely to react to the aviation fuel price, said an Indian Airlines official. Its unlikely anyone will react at this stage but if there are more hikes then we will be forced to raise fares. 

 Aviation fuel prices for domestic airlines in Delhi were raised by Rs 895.56 per kl to Rs 41,303.58, while in Calcutta the hike was Rs 948.18 per kl to Rs 46,564.46.

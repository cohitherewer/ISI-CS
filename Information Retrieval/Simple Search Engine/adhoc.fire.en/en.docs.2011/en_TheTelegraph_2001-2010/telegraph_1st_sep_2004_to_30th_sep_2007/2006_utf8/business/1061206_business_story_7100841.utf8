 Set to rise

 Calcutta, Dec. 5: Sun Microsystems India is gaining ground with developers in the east.

 Many mid-sized companies from the region, besides large companies and media houses, are opting for a range of Suns products. The medium and small businesses comprise around 40 per cent of the companys revenues in the country. The pricing portfolio has also been restructured to include options starting from Rs 45,000.

 Sun has witnessed an increase in awareness in this region. We have about 10 to 15 mid-market clients, which is a reflection of Suns efforts to reach out beyond the large companies and bring about a change in perceptions. People now see Sun as a niche brand, said K.P. Unnikrishnan, director, strategic alliances and teleweb sales, Sun Microsystems India.

 A large number of developers in the region use Java, which is one of the core development platforms for Sun.

 The company has also started operations in Guwahati and expects to reach out to more customers in education and research, government and manufacturing, besides small and medium businesses in and around the region.

 Global experts on Sun technology address developers, who meet twice a year in Calcutta.

 Sun India no longer reports to Singapore but has become Sun Incs 16th GEM (geographically established market).

 This is significant as now Sun India will be able to access more international resources and the investment amounts will also rise substantially along with targets. Sun has invested over $150 million in India, Unnikrishnan added.

 Sun China ranks between 10th and 12th in the global GEM ranking.

 The company is the fourth largest player in the overall server market in India.

 Oracle profit jumps 22%

 San Francisco, March 21 (Reuters): Business software maker Oracle Corp on Monday posted a 22 per cent rise in quarterly profit but its shares fell nearly 4 per cent as its database software sales lagged forecasts.

 The company also affirmed its current-quarter profit and revenue forecast given in February, and said demand for new software licences along with strong growth helped boost third-quarter results.

 Oracle, the worlds No. 1 database software maker, is pushing hard to unseat SAP AG of Germany as the leading provider of business applications that help automate everything from human resources to sales to inventory management.

 Oracle shares fell 3.9 per cent to $13.19 in after-hours trading, after closing up 12 cents, or less than 1 per cent, at $13.72 on Nasdaq.

 Brendan Barnacle, an analyst at Pacific Crest Equities, said Oracle shares likely fell because database revenue came in a bit weaker than Wall Street had expected. 

 The increased demand for new licences for application software looked good but it was hard to tell what growth came from Oracles products and what was due to acquisitions, he added.

 It looks pretty good but the database numbers were a little bit weak, Barnacle said.

 Oracle co-president and chief financial officer Safra Catz said foreign exchange rates hurt database revenue growth, which came at 9 per cent on a constant currency basis.

 She forecast future database revenue rising at a double-digit percentage rate on a constant currency basis, as Oracle faces competition from International Business Machines, Microsoft and upstart rivals such as MySQL AB.

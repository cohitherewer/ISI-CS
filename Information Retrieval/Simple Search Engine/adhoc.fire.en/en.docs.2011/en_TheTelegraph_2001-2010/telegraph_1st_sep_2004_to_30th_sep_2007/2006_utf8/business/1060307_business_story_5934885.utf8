 Calcutta, March 6: Bhutan is looking at exporting 2000 mw of power to India by October 2006 after the 1020-mw Tala Hydroelectric Project is completed. The country expects the export figures to go up to 5000 mw by 2012 with the commissioning of three new power projects.

 At present, Bhutan exports 400 mw to India and power alone contributes to 43 per cent of the countrys GDP.

 The first turbine of the Tala project is set to be operational by May followed by two more generating units each in June and July, which would help us boost our exports considerably, said Lyonpo Dago Tshering, ambassador of the Kingdom of Bhutan in India, Nepal and Japan.

 Tshering was speaking on Indo-Bhutanese trade relations at a meeting organised by Bengal National Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

 The three other power projects would be implemented by the Bhutanese government with the help of the Water and Power Consultancy Services (India) Ltd (WAPCOS).

 The first two would be set up at Punatsangchhu I and II. The detailed project report (DPR) of the first phase would be ready by the end of 2006.

 The DPR of Punatsangchhu II and Mangdechhu would be completed in the subsequent years, Tshering said.

 We hope with the expansion in power generation capacity, our country would be able to contribute our bit to Indias growing energy needs, Tshering said.

 North Bengal, especially the border areas, will benefit from the increased power exports.

 The DPR for the Indo-Bhutan rail linkage programme, which is being done by RITES, would involve five strategic entry points.

 The rail linkages would be broad gauge extending to 12 km at certain places.

 RITES would complete the feasibility study for the railway project by the end of 2006 and will submit the report to the Indian and Bhutanese governments and the construction work should begin by the first half of 2007, said Tshering. The five strategic entry points include Hansimara ?Phuntseling, Banarhat?Samchi, Kokrajhar-Gellippur, Pathsala?Nangalam and Darang-Samdrupjong.

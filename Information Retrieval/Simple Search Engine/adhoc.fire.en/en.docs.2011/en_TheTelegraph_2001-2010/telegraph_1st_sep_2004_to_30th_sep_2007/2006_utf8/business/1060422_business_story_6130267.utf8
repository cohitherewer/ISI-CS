 Adlabs to demerge FM radio business

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, April 21: Adlabs Films Ltd, an Anil Ambani group company, is planning to demerge its FM radio business into a separate company. Adlabs investors are likely to be issued shares of the demerged unit.

 The board will meet tomorrow to consider this proposal. 

 A meeting will be held to consider the proposal for a reorganisation of the company and demerger of the FM radio business pro-rata to all shareholders, pursuant to a scheme of arrangement under sections 391-394 of the Companies Act, 1956, the company has informed the bourses.

 In January, Adlabs joined the big league by bagging 45 FM radio licences. The move to demerge the FM radio business is being seen as a measure to add shareholder value.

 Last year, the Reliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group (ADAG) acquired a 50.16 per cent stake in the company for Rs 360 crore. Ambani plans to be present not only in exhibition, production, processing and distribution of films but also across the entertainment value chain ranging from television to radio and direct-to-home (DTH).

 The ADAG had recently increased its stake in the company to 54.91 per cent by acquiring 38 lakh shares more. Reliance Land and Reliance Capital acquired these shares on April 12 through preferential allotments.

 This came after the company announced that international equity placement firm BSMA, a Bear Stearns Asia Ltd affiliate, has confirmed an investment of $6 million in the multiplex business of Adlabs.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Price sole factor in Corus bid battle

 AMIT ROY 

 Paul: Offering views

 London, Dec. 13: Swaraj Paul today told The Telegraph that the bidding war for Corus could prove to be protracted. 

 It could go on for three months, said Paul, who is the founder of Caparo steel company. 

 Asked if there was any advice he could offer Tata Steel to help it win the battle against Brazils CSN, Paul said: Now its purely a price issue. 

 On Monday, CSN trumped Tatas increased offer of 500 pence per Corus share with a higher bid of 515 pence. 

 Management has no say in such matters, said Paul. If, as was the case with (Lakshmi) Mittal, they were offering part shares and cash, the management could say which was the better offer. In this case, the shareholder, who is selling, just wants more money. 

 As to how long the battle might last, he said: There is no urgency, it could go on for months or until one side has bought 51 per cent of the shares. Tata might come back with a higher offer, and then CSN with another offer after that. 

 As to how much Corus was worth, he reminded The Telegraph that at one point Corus shares were valued at as little as 6 pence. Now, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. 

 The battle would end once the lending banks were not willing to put any more money or one or the other side thought Corus was no longer worth it. 

 One of the most insightful pieces of analysis of the intensifying battle for Corus has come from veteran commentator Jeremy Warner who has suggested that victory could prove to be damaging for the winner. 

 In the battle between CSN and Tata for Corus, the biggest loser may end up being the victor, was Warners intriguing conclusion. 

 Tata Steel seemed genuinely to believe it had blown the Brazilians, Companhia Siderurgica Nacional (CSN), out of the water when it came back with a 500p-a-share offer late on Sunday night, Warner commented yesterday in a column. There was delight in the Indian camp at the shock this must have caused to CSN, just as it was putting the finishing touches to a bid worth just 475p. Yet unfazed, the Brazilians immediately came back with 515p. To judge by the finance put in place, CSNs chief executive, Benjamin Steinbruch, has the firepower to go higher still if he needs to. 

 Warner said: It seems scarcely possible even today, with so much hype around the supposed super cycle in commodity prices generated by Asian and Latin American economic development that the remnants of dear old British Steel (Corus as now is) could find itself the subject of a rapid-fire bidding war. Yet here we have a couple of the emerging titans of the developing world in an apparently to-the-death battle for this once gloriously loss-making business.

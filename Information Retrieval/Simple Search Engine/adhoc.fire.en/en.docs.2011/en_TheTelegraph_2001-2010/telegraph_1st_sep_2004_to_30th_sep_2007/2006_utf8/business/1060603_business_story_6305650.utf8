 Jindal: Glad tidings

 New Delhi, June 2: Jindal Steel and Power Ltd has bagged the rights to develop the el Mutun iron ore mine in Bolivia that has reserves of 20 billion tonnes.

 The Jindals will invest $2.3 billion in the next 10 years to develop the mine and set up a steel plant. 

 We have been awarded the rights for the el Mutun iron ore mine... We would invest $1.5 billion in the next five years and $2.3 billion in the next 10 years, JSPL executive vice-chairman and managing director Naveen Jindal said in London.

 The company won a global tender floated by the Left wing government in Bolivia. Located near the countrys border with Brazil, el Mutun is said to be the worlds single largest iron ore mine, possessing quality ore with an iron content of over 64 per cent. The 60-square km site is in the Santa Cruz province and is owned by the state run mining company Comibol.

 The Jindals fought off bids by Mittal Steel, Chinas Shandung Lunang Trading Company and Brazils EBX group. 

 The proposed $1.8-billion steel facility, to be powered by natural gas, will have a steel plant, a pellet plant and a sponge iron plant. The company would invest $0.5 billion in developing the mines.

 The Jindals will raise 60 per cent of the funds through debt and the rest as equity. The company is expected to make an overseas bond offering to partially fund the venture. 

 The company plans to dig 5 mt of ore a year over the lease period of 40 years. 

 The Bolivian government expects the project to generate $200 million of revenues a year, provide direct employment to 2,000 and indirect employment to 10,000 and fetch $30 million as taxes.

 The Jindals will pay royalty to the government at the rate of 8-9 per cent on the ores and concentrates; 10 per cent on the iron pellet; and 5 per cent on steel exports. 

 The integrated steel plant would produce 1.7 million tonnes of long products of steel, six million tonnes per year of direct reduced iron (DRI) and a pellet plant of 10 million tonnes capacity.

 The company would also set up a 400 mw power plant. The government has assured all support and supply of natural gas for the project, which is likely to be implemented through a subsidiary.

 The announcement comes a month after the nationalisation of Bolivias natural gas sector the second largest after Venezuela by president Evo Morales The bid was a test case as to how the government would proceed with investments in mining. The government wanted bidders to not only extract iron but also set up steel plant using the countrys huge gas resources.

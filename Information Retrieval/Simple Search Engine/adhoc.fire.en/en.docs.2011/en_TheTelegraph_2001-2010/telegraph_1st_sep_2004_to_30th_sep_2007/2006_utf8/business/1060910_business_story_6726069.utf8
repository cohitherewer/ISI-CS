 Hallmark tag for gold must from Jan

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, Sept. 9: Hallmarking of gold jewellery will be made mandatory from January 2008, according to an official of the Bureau of Indian Standards.

 Response for hallmarking, which is optional now, had increased as evident from the doubling of number of applications for the process after the fee in the four metros was reduced from Rs 25,800 each year to Rs 25,000 for three years.

 The licence fee in other towns and rural areas will be Rs 20,000 and Rs 10,000 for three years, respectively, Y. P. Singh, additional director of Bureau of Indian Standards, said.

 Singh, who was here to inaugurate an awareness programme on hallmarking, told reporters that the purpose of hallmarking was to regulate the purity of gold and silver.

 There are 34 centres in India for hallmarking and eight of them are in Tamil Nadu, Singh said, adding 230 new applications for hallmarking gold jewels and four for silver jewels had been received from the state this year.

 Under the hallmarking scheme, the Bureau of Indian Standards granted licences to jewellers who get their jewels assayed and hallmarked through the recognised hallmarking centres.

 The hallmark consists of BIS mark, fineness, centres logo, jewellers identification mark and code letter for the year of hallmarking. 

 While Indias indigenous gold production is about 3.4 tonnes per annum, the consumption is around 800 tonnes per year, Singh said.

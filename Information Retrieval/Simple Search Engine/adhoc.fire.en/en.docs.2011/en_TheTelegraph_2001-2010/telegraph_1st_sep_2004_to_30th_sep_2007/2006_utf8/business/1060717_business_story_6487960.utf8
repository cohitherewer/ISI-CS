 Recipe to bridge IT gap

 URVASHI KAUL

 Tech tonic

 New Delhi, July 16: With the campaign to take information technology to the masses gaining momentum, the private sector is keen to step up efforts to address issues that hinder the growth.

 Pointing out loopholes in spectrum allocation, industry sources have said the spectrum policy needs to be revisited. At the same time, data services also need to be immediately addressed for e-governance initiatives to be successful. 

 Although it sounds good to say so many millions have been connected, the actual benefits will reach only through e-governance, which can flow only on the broadband, said an industry official. 

 According to the Vision 2010 document on broadband penetration, the target for December 2005 was 3 million. Six months have passed since then, and India has barely touched 50 per cent of the target.

 Officials said three aspects need to be addressed for broadband penetration ? creating infrastructure at state-level data centres (servers), state-wide area network, and creating common service centres. 

 The government is expected to sign 22 agreements with private players such as Tata, Reliance and Microsoft to set up rural business hubs in the country. These will help farmers sell their produce at the best possible prices.

 Union minister for communications Dayanidhi Maran had unveiled the national e-governance plan last month, which covered 26 projects and eight components with an estimated investment of around Rs 23,000 crore over the next five years. 

 Maran had said the plan would help to co-ordinate the efforts in the right direction by setting common standards, and broad outlines of the programme.

 The central and state governments are spending Rs 3,000 crore every year on various e-governance initiatives. 

 Some of the major components under this programme include the common service centres, computerisation of land records, getting farmers a better deal for their crops, commercial taxes and income tax filing.

 The government aims to set up around 100,000 common service centres under public-private partnerships to be run by individuals on a profit basis model by the end of 2007.

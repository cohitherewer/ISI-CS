 Calcutta, June 29: Indian Oil Corporation has threatened to pull out of Haldia Petrochemicals Ltd (HPL), if Reliance Industries enters the stage.

 Without mincing words, IOC chairman Sarthak Behuria said it would be either Indian Oil or Reliance in HPL.

 There is no room for two in that company, he said on the sidelines of the extra-ordinary general meeting of IBP here today.

 Reliance chairman Mukesh Ambani was here last week and discussed some major investment proposals with the Bengal government.

 Though both Reliance and the state government denied any discussions on HPL, sources said RIL was keen on a stake in the company.

 We are interested in the management control of HPL. I am sure that Reliance will be interested in that as well. But there is no place for two, he added.

 IOC was roped in by the company as a strategic investor with a 7.5 per cent stake.

 However, this has been challenged by The Chatterjee Group, the co-promoter of HPL along with the Bengal government. The case is before the Company Law Board, which will give its verdict on July 4.

 Behuria, however, said there was room for both IOC and Reliance in the proposed chemical hub in Haldia. 

 Incidentally, both companies were looking at HPL control in return of their bigger and stronger commitment to invest in the chemical hub.

 But it is unclear how any one of them could take control without the approval of TCG.

 When asked how the state would proceed in this stand-off, Sabyasachi Sen, principal secretary, commerce and industry, Bengal said the government was awaiting the verdict of CLB. TCG has the first right of refusal, he added.

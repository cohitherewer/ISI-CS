 Calcutta, Dec. 19: Anshin Software, a capital market IT solutions provider with operations in Calcutta, is looking at opening a knowledge process outsourcing (KPO) centre in the city.

 The company has been allotted half an acre land in Rajerhat for its new facility, as part of the state IT departments initiative to promote entrepreneurs and SME companies in the state.

 We have a growth rate of 25 to 30 per cent. This could rise significantly as we plan to target the domestic market for capital market solutions and enter a new vertical like telecom to offer web-enabled, flexible and scalable solutions. The KPO centre should start by June 2007. It would develop products and also service them, said Arnab Debnath, president and CEO of Anshinsoft Corp.

 The company, which has more than 200 people on its rolls, would also hire more to cater to new verticals and the KPO centre.

 The centre would deal with the credit management system of smaller US- based banks.

 According to a Nasscom report, 8 per cent of American bank transactions are currently done in India. This is expected to go up to 30 per cent by 2010.

 Anshin Software is also implementing a major project of comprehensive securities trading, back-office system for Nomura Securities International, New York.

 The system will go live by mid-2007.

 Goldman Sachs has also been using the companys product for the last three years along with Hitachi and Toshiba.

 We want entrepreneurial companies like Anshin Software to set up base and work for Fortune 500 companies from Calcutta. The land has already been allotted. We had a meeting with around 250-300 Bengalis at the Bangalore IT event who had moved away from the city and are now exploring opportunities to come back, said Siddhartha, IT secretary, government of Bengal.

 Hind Petro woos Total for Bhatinda

 S.P.S. PANNU

 Big plans

 New Delhi, April 30: Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd is trying to rope in Total of France as an equity partner for its greenfield refinery project in Punjab after British Petroleum pulled out of the venture. 

 Sources said HPCL chairman M.B. Lal is in Paris to discuss the proposal with the management of Total.

 Total is already a joint venture partner of HPCL for the LPG underground storage facility that the two are setting up in Vizag. It is a 50:50 joint venture, which is scheduled to go on stream early 2007. 

 HPCL wants to strengthen this relationship further and take the French oil major on board its greenfield refinery project at Bhatinda in Punjab. 

 Total is also participating in the Hazira LNG terminal and a port project. It is marketing its brand of lubricants in India as well. TotalFinaElf India Ltd, a subsidiary of Total, has a 10 per cent share in the domestic lubricants market and is aiming to double it to 20 per cent by 2010. 

 HPCL, with its vast network of retail outlets, can help Total in expanding its interest in India.

 HPCL has already said it would continue with the Rs 12,000-crore Bhatinda project on its own. However, the company is also interested in a tie-up with a global oil major, as it would give access to more capital and world-class technology. 

 The 9-million-tonne refinery is scheduled to be completed in 2010. However, the date can be advanced by a year to 2009 if Total joins the venture.

 BP had signed an MoU with HPCL in October last year for a 50:50 joint venture in the Punjab refinery project and for branching out into marketing at a later date.

 The project had caught BPs attention due to the high refining margins, which were around $6 per barrel at that time. The British company had also hoped to cash in on the strong retail network of HPCL to expand its operations in India.

 However, with crude prices skyrocketing and refining margins coming down, BP has decided to pull out of the investment.

 BP was also expected to assist in arranging crude supplies for both HPCLs new refinery as well as the existing ones in Vizag and Mumbai from its vast reserves. A similar arrangement could be hammered out with Total. 

 The partners were supposed to develop a joint marketing strategy, which would include establishing a retail service station network in preparation for the refinery coming on stream in 2009.

 Since Total already has some exposure in the Indian lubricants market, it could further expand its presence in partnership with HPCL.

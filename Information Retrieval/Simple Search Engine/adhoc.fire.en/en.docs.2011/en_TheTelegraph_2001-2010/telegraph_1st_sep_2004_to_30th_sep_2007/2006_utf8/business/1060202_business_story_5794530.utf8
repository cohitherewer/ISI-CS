 Pak base for media agencies

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Feb. 1: Media agencies are looking to set up base in Pakistan.

 The Starcom MediaVest Group, a 100 per cent subsidiary of the Paris-based Publicis Group, will soon be entering Pakistan in collaboration with local partners in the country.

 We have been talking to some local agencies in Pakistan and will enter the country in a month through tie-ups with local agencies and some Publicis-aligned agencies, said Ravi Kiran, CEO (South Asia), Starcom Worldwide. Kiran, however, did not reveal the names of the clients that they will be servicing in Pakistan. Pakistan will be the 69 th country for Starcom.

 Someone from Pakistan will be heading our operations there; someone with sound local knowledge, he added. 

 Before entering any country, it is important that we know and understand the legal framework of the country, this is what takes time, he added, explaining the reason for the delay. Kiran claimed that they already have quite a good number of clients there. Starcom does not expect a big market share in the beginning. We expect to be a significant player in the time to come, he added.

 The move comes close on the heels of Starcoms opening its 111th office in Sri Lanka. Starcom Sri Lanka has been established as an independent company but will be supported by the quality and reputation of Leo Burnett Solutions, a marketing communications company in Sri Lanka. Starcom has close to 110 offices in 68 countries worldwide.

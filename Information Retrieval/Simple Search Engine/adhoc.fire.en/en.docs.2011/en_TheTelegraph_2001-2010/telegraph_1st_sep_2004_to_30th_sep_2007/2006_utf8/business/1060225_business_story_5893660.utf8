 Calcutta, Feb. 24: Godrej amp; Boyce Manufacturing Co Ltd, a leading player in the furniture and interior industry, is foraying into the consultancy business. It is also planning to introduce products for hospital and school segments.

 Instead of providing only furniture for offices, the company is planning to offer consultancy to decorate the office space. We have began in a small way. But going forward, this will be a growth area for the company, said Manoj Ganjawala, vice-president (marketing and sales).

 Moreover, the company is firming up new product lines for hospital and school segments, as these two sectors are witnessing a boom.

 At the same time, it is also focussing on the IT and ITeS sector. This sector is growing at 30 per cent and accounts for 37 per cent of the total office furniture market, Ganjawala said.

 The furniture and interior division of Godrej amp; Boyce is hoping to clock a turnover Rs 600 crore this year, contributing 30 per cent to the companys turnover.

 It has a national market share of 20 per cent within the organised sector. In the unorganised sector, too, it is a significant contributor.

 The office segment is valued at Rs 3,000 crore and the home segment at Rs 6,000 crore.

 The factory-finished products of the home segment is growing at 20 per cent, while the entire segment is registering only a 5 per cent growth.

 The company is also planning to consolidate its international presence.

 It has four manufacturing facilities located in Oman, Malaysia, Vietnam and Singapore catering to local markets.

 In India, too, the company has four manufacturing facilities ? three in Mumbai and one in Guwahati.

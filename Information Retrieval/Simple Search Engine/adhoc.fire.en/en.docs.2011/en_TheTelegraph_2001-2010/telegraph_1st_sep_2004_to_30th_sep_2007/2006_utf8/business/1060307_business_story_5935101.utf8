 Suzuki stake sale nets GM $2 bn

 Tokyo, March 6 (Reuters): Embattled US auto giant General Motors Corp said on Monday it would sell 17.4 per cent of its stake in Suzuki Motor Corp back to the Japanese car maker, raising around $2 billion in much-needed cash to restore its tattered balance sheet. 

 The sale would leave GM with a pre-1998 level of 3 per cent in Suzuki.

 It ends months of speculation about a possible unravelling of their equity relationship after the worlds biggest auto maker unloaded its entire 20 per cent stake in Japans Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd last year, also to raise money.

 The Detroit-based auto maker lost $8.6 billion in 2005 and is undergoing sweeping restructuring driven in part by new board member Jerry York, an aide to GMs largest individual shareholder, Kirk Kerkorian. York has called for aggressive turnaround efforts, including the sale of various assets around the world.

 GM and Suzuki, which first formed a capital tie-up in 1981, said they would continue to work together at the operational level, including through joint product distribution, development of advanced powertrain technology, ownership of a Canadian assembly plant and Suzukis 11 per cent equity participation in GMs South Korean unit, GM Daewoo Automotive amp; Technology Co.

 Our relationship is strong, and we look forward to our continued partnership, GM chief executive Rick Wagoner said in a statement.

 This transaction will allow us to preserve our business relationship, while further building up GMs significant liquidity position during this critical phase of our turnaround. 

 GM said it expected a pre-tax gain of $550 million to $750 million from the sale.

 I think 3 per cent is an appropriate (ownership) level, Suzuki CEO Osamu Suzuki told a news conference in Tokyo.

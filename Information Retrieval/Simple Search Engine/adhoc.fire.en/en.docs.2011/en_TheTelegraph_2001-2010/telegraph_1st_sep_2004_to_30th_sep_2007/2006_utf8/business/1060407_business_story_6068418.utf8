 Orissa awaits bang for BPO buck

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Gaining ground

 Bhubaneswar, April 6: A group of US-based NRI venture capitalists is interested in setting up a 5,000-seater BPO centre and beach resorts in the state. 

 Tourism and IT minister SN Patro today held a meeting with the four venture capitalists led by US-based NRI Prabhu Goyal. 

 The group has sought about 10-12 acres in Infocity, the IT hub on the outskirts of Bhubanesar, or 20-30 acres for setting up a special economic zone at which the proposed BPO centre will come up.

 We have shown them the land available at Infocity and have quoted our prices, they are yet to make an offer, said IT commissioner-cum-secretary S.N. Tripathy, pointing out that the talks are only at a preliminary level.

 Tripathy said the group, which was on a demand-discovery visit, also visited Cuttack, Puri and Correa. 

 They also expressed their interest in setting up spa-cum-beach resorts at multiple locations. These resorts would have around 150 rooms each, he said, adding no location has been finalised for the resorts.

 US-based ore entrepreneur Scant Pontiac also accompanied the group.

 Calcutta, Dec. 10: It was a weekend of triumphs and turn downs for aspirants registering at The Telegraph Jobs Mart as Infocom 2006 came to an end.

 More than 70 people received placement offers over two days until three hours before registration closed at The Telegraph Jobs Mart on Sunday. Several more will come to know what fate holds in store for them by the end of the week.

 This is the first time I have visited Infocom and the names that were recruiting drew me to Jobs Mart. I am glad I came, said Vivek Gupta, an employee of an inbound call centre, who was hired by Hero Mindmine for IBM Daksh, Gurgaon.

 The Jobs Mart has drawn around 5,000 people over the two days. Although the number of people coming in has remained almost the same as last year, the quality of the crowd has improved, said an organiser.

 Hero Mindmine hired about 20 people as operations executives for IBM on the second day. The company has also given 15-day conditional offer letters to candidates who will have to go through a 15-day training process, which will decide their eligibility for the final offer letter.

 Companies like Genpact, a BPO that had hired four people yesterday, have postponed giving final offer letters to short-listed candidates until tomorrow. The final round will be conducted tomorrow as the management is not available on Sundays, said Supratim Bose, assistant manager hiring, of Genpact.

 Another BPO, First Source, short-listed 125 people yesterday and around 70 on the second day. It will conduct final interviews at their city office later in the week.

 Hutch stake sale on Orascom agenda

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Nov. 14: Orascom Telecom of Egypt dropped a bombshell today when it said it was mulling a partial sale of its 19.3 per cent strategic stake in Cayman Island-based Hutchison Telecom International to optimise the value from its stake.

 In (the) light of current relative market valuations, Orascom Telecom continues to review all financial options, including a partial sale, for optimising value from its stake, Orascom Telecom said in its 22-page filing of its third quarter results available on its website.

 The announcement added an element of intrigue to one of the most gripping corporate slugfests that has engulfed Indias telecom sector and has been raging for close to a year.

 In December 2005, Orascom picked up the strategic stake in HTIL for $1.3 billion (or HK $10.1 billion). Since HTIL controls 66.99 per cent of Hutchison Essar, Orascoms investment gave the Egyptian company an indirect stake of 10 per cent in the Indian telecom firm and the right to a board position that hasnt been filled till date. The Ruias, who hold the remaining 33 per cent in Hutchison Essar, were upset as they were not consulted prior to the deal.

 The Ruias have been erecting their own defences to ward off Orascom. They have transferred a bulk of their holding 22.04 per cent to Mauritius-based entities in order to take the overall foreign holding in Hutchison Essar to 74 per cent, which is the ceiling set by the government. 

 Hutchison Essar is the jewel in HTILs crown and accounts for 45.2 per cent of the latters turnover of HK $15.6 billion. Hutchison Essar has a subscriber base of 20.3 million.

 Last month, Orascom chairman Naguib Sawiris articulated a desire to raise its stake in HTIL sparking even greater consternation within the Ruia camp as well as the Hutchison Whampoa group which has a 49.8 per cent stake in HTIL.

 The HTIL share has been rising on the Hong Kong bourse over the past three months and that would explain why Orascom might now want to pick some of the gains off the table. The stock, which was quoting at HK $12.44 on August 4, had surged to $16.8 on Monday. Today, the stock fell by a dollar to HK $15.8 with 5.6 million shares traded. 

 Orascom had paid HK $11 per share when it bought 917.76 million shares in HTIL. Under the December 2005 deal, Orascom has a conditional right to purchase another 3.7 per cent in HTIL within a period of 12 months at a price of no less than HK $11.

 Even as it announced that it was mulling a partial stake sale in HTIL, Orascom emphasised that it remained committed to its strategic relationship with HTIL.

 So, is this a strategic withdrawal only to mount a renewed bid to acquire a controlling interest in HTIL? Orascom has to maintain a minimum stake of 12 per cent in HTIL at all times if it wants to take advantage of the future stake purchase rights that the deal with HTIL affords. Under the terms of the deal, Orascom and HTIL have the right of first refusal if either chooses to sell HTIL shares.

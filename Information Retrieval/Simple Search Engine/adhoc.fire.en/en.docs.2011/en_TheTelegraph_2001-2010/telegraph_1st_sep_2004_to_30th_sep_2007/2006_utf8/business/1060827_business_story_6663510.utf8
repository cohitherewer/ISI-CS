 Japanese tech for new Ruchi Soya plant

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Aug. 26: Madhya Pradesh-based Ruchi Soya Industries has started a new food processing complex in Haldia at an investment of Rs 80 crore. The company, which owns the Nutrela brand of soya beans, already has a facility here, which extracts oil from mustard and sunflower. The new plant will use Japanese technology to produce rice bran oil. 

 Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, who unveiled the foundation stone, said the state would provide special incentives if the company improves the rice bran oil facility. 

 We are already self sufficient in rice production in the state and have produced 14 million tonnes of rice in the last fiscal. Similarly, we have to become self sufficient in edible oils and the government will provide incentives to fulfil this target, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said. 

 The company has already invested Rs 77 crore in the existing processing facility or edible oil refinery set up in 2002. 

 India imports Rs 15,000 crore worth edible oil in the country. 

 The chief minister also urged the Haldia Development Authority to allot the adjacent vacant plot of land to the company for its expansion plan.

 Our company is planning to set up a bio diesel plant and a palm oil facility in the state. We have real estate operations in Bengal too, said Dinesh Shahara, managing director of Ruchi Soya Industries. 

 The new plant will employ around 500 people and also benefit another 1000 indirectly.

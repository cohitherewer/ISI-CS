 Voltas buys German firm, more in offing

 SRIKUMAR BONDYOPADHYAY

 Calcutta, July 31: Tata group company Voltas has acquired a minority stake in a German company. The company is also looking for more buyouts both at home and abroad.

 Voltas, however, declined to name the German company. Vice-president (finance) M.M. Miyajiwala said, We will soon announce the details. 

 The company is evaluating some buyout proposals which will be finalised in another 3-4 months, he added. 

 So far, we have been able to recover our lost market share by growing within. Now, we are looking at inorganic growth, Miyajiwala said. 

 Voltass share of the air-conditioner market fell from 40 per cent in 1992 to 7 per cent in 2001. However, with re-engineering and revamping of the distribution channel, the company managed to wrest a 16 per cent market share. There are 18 players in the domestic air-conditioner market, of whom only two are Indian ? Voltas and Videocon. Voltas has clocked a more than 40 per cent increase in sales volume and a 33 per cent increase in value during the first quarter of the current financial year. 

 Gross sales increased to Rs 599.29 crore during the April-June quarter of this financial year from Rs 450.54 crore in the previous corresponding quarter. Net sales went up to Rs 580.40 crore from Rs 436.71 crore. The operating profit has also increased to Rs 32.80 crore from Rs 25.65 crore, despite a 32.5 per cent rise in total expenditure. The company provided Rs 1.17 crore for one-time staff cost during the April-June quarter as it adopted the accounting standard AS 15 from the current financial year. 

 Besides, we were a minimum alternate tax company in the last fiscal, but from 2006-07 we came under full taxation that saw our tax outgo increase to Rs 10.45 crore for the first quarter this fiscal compared with Rs 2.75 crore a year ago, Miyajiwala said.

 Voltas has posted a 31.42 per cent jump in profit after tax at Rs 21.75 crore compared with Rs 16.55 crore. 

 The company and its rivals are worried over the rise in raw material prices, particularly metals. While we have passed on the cost inflation to the customers in the commercial segment. But it is difficult to increase airconditioner prices in the domestic segment because of stiff competition, Miyajiwala said.

 However, owing to a 10 per cent reduction in excise duty we have so far been able to manage the profitability in the room airconditioner segment, he added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Hunt begins for extra cash

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 6: Finance ministry officials today began discussions with state-run blue-chip firms so that they cough up higher dividends.

 Officials were tight-lipped, but sources said the government hoped to garner about Rs 2,000 crore more as dividend from PSUs than the budget target of Rs 16,090 crore.

 Finance ministry officials held discussions with chief executives of Bhel, Steel Authority of India Ltd, GAIL (India) Ltd, Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd, Nalco and Oil India Ltd as part of their effort to raise more resources.

 Sources said the government wanted profitable PSUs to pay between 20 per cent and 30 per cent dividend. 

 It also wants the PSUs that have huge reserves but few plans to utilise them to pay a special dividend out of the reserves. PSUs with huge surpluses and sustained profit flows have also been asked to consider issuing bonus shares.

 The government will hold talks with some 16 PSUs. As a majority owner, the government can advise these PSUs on dividend payouts, but any attempts to coerce them to pay higher dividends can be challenged by other shareholders.

 Meetings will be held with the officials of Hindustan Aeronautics, NTPC, Power Finance Corporation, Rural Electrification Corporation, Shipping Corporation of India and Nuclear Power Corporation of India on Monday.

 The objective of the meetings is to convey to the companies that they should not sit on idle cash. Whatever surplus they have should be put to use. The intention of the government, however, is not to squeeze them, officials said.

 This year, ONGC has already paid a record dividend of 250 per cent or Rs 3,568 crore to the government. Bhel has also declared an all-time high interim equity dividend of 40 per cent for 2005-06 against an interim dividend of 35 per cent in the previous year.

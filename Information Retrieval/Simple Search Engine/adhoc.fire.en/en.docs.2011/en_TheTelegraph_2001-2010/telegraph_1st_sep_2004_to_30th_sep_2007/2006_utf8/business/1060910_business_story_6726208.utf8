 New Delhi, Sept. 9: The government has removed the 5 per 

cent import duty on wheat for private traders a decision that is expected to 

augment supply of wheat in the wake of its spiralling prices. The decision has 

brought the private traders on a par with the State Trading Corporation, which 

is already importing wheat at zero duty. The zero duty on import of wheat will 

remain in force until December 31. The Cabinet Committee of Prices (CCP) had decided 

last month to bring down the import duty to zero level for import by private traders.

 Mumbai, Sept. 9: Barclays, the third largest bank in Britain, 

is planning a big leap in investments and nearly four-fold jump in employee strength 

for its retail and corporate banking business in India. The bank plans to offer 

full service commercial banking operations in the country.

 Bhubaneswar, Sept. 9: The Orissa government has refused 

to give the no objection certificate sought by AESs proposed 1000-mw coal-fired

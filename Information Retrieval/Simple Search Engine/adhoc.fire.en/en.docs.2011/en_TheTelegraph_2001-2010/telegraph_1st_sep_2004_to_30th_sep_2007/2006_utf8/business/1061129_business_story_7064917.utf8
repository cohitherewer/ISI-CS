 Calcutta, Nov 28: Bengal is planning a big push in coal mining through joint ventures, to provide assured supply to local industries of the scarce resource.

 The state government expects to get 12 coal blocks from the Centre for exploration and production activities. The state had recently received three such blocks.

 West Bengal Mineral Development Corporation (WBMDC) will be the nodal agency for the state government for the work.

 It (WBMDC) will tie up with private companies having good technology. The majority share remains with the government agency, Sabyasachi Sen, principal secretary of commerce and industry of the state government, said here today.

 This is the first time that the state is taking such an initiative for the benefit of local industry, which is starved of coal.

 The state power department has some captive blocks, and Eastern Coalfield is the biggest operator in the state.

 Speaking on the sidelines of the Metals 2006 seminar, organised by the Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry (BCCI), Sen said the captive blocks were in Burdwan, Birbhum and Bankura.

 There are good interest among private parties to join hands with us. We already have five to six applications, Sen said.

 The state has already finalised a joint venture partner for one of the three coal blocks.

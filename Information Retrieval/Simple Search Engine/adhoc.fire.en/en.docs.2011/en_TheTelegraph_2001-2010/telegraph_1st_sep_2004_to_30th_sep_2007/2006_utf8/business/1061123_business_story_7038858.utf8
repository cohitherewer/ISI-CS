 India, EU sign pact on aviation

 New Delhi, Nov. 22 (PTI): India and the European Union (EU) today signed a framework on cooperation in varied fields of the civil aviation sector, ranging from infrastructure needs to safety and security policies and technical assistance.

 The framework, signed by visiting EU vice-president Jacques Barrot and civil aviation minister Praful Patel, identifies several areas in which the two sides could enhance cooperation and mutually assist each other.

 Patel said the framework also aimed at synergising the regulatory frameworks in India and EU, negotiating air traffic rights and certifying products and services, while Barrot hoped that several agreements would be signed on many issues in the near future. The EU vice-president said close relations would be established between Indian civil aviation authorities and the EU aviation safety agency, the equivalent of US federal aviation authority.

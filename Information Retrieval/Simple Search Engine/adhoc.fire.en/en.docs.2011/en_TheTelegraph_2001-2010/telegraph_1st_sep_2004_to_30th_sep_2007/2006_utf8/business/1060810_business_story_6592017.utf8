 PwC to help Bengal in IT land search

 SOHINI MOOKHERJEA

 Calcutta, Aug. 9: The Bengal IT department has commissioned a feasibility study to rank places other than those in and around Calcutta to set up infotech parks.

 This will help resolve the problem of chronic shortage of land and the high prices involved.

 PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) will carry out the feasibility study and rank Siliguri, Haldia, Kharagpur and Durgapur in terms of their suitability to house IT parks. It will take into consideration the availability of land, infrastructure and connectivity.

 PwC would present a detailed project framework to us in a fortnight. We expect the study to be completed within three to four months, said Siddharth, principal secretary, department of information technology.

 PwC is also the state governments partner for its e-governance project.

 If there is a ready document by PwC advocating the case of Siliguri, Durgapur, Kharagpur or Haldia as an alternative location, it would be easier for us to get clearances from our headquarters to set up establishments in these places, Calcutta-based IT industry bigwigs said.

 The state IT department has also got assurances from the Haldia Development Authority and the Siliguri Jalpaiguri Development Authority for co-operation regarding land allocation and availability.

 Plans are also afoot to hold talks with the Airports Authority of India to acquire unused tea gardens around the Bagdogra airport to extend the runway.

 If required, unused gardens along the road to the Bagdogra airport could also be acquired.

 The West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation (WBIDC) is also acquiring 1,200 acres in Kharagpur, of which around 100 acres would be used for an IT park and 170 acres for a biotechnology park.

 This study comes at a time when projects like that of Ascendas might get stuck because of high land prices.

 IT department sources said Tata Consultancy Services had asked for a 50-acre plot 9-10 months ago and Satyam for 25 acres. However, discussions had not progressed with the projects getting shelved or transferred to other cities.

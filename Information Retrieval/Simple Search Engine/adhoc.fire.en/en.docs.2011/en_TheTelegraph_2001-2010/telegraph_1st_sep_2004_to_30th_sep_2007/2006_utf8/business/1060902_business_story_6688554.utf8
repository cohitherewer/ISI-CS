 Mumbai, Sept. 1: The board of Hinduja TMT has approved the demerger of its IT/ITeS undertaking into a new entity, which would be called HTMT Technologies.

 The new entity is expected to be listed in the fourth quarter of the current fiscal, while the appointed date of the demerger will be October 1. The demerger and restructuring is subject to necessary approvals.

 Investors holding two shares in Hinduja TMT will receive one share of the company and one of HTMT Technologies after the demerger.

 The board has also approved the merger of the companys broadband subsidiary In2Cable and its content arm InNetwork Entertainment into Indusind Media and Communications Limited. 

 After the merger, Hinduja TMT will hold 60.5 per cent in the merged media and entertainment entity.

 According to a statement issued by the company, the media and entertainment business is being consolidated to converge the video, voice and data services under one entity as a triple-play provider. 

 The merger will bring in operational efficiencies, provide sharper focus on the core business of media and entertainment, telecom and content distribution and ensure smooth implementation of the conditional access system (CAS) across Indian cities, packaged with value-added services.

 The process will allow HTMT Technologies to focus on IT/ITeS businesses, while Hinduja TMT will look after new business initiatives, acquisitions and hold the combined and unified media and entertainment entity IndusInd Media Communications Limited. 

 The company is evaluating some acquisition opportunities for HTMT Technologies in the ITeS space in the US, the UK and Latin America to consolidate its position and expand inorganically.

 The IT/ITeS business is present in healthcare, telecom, consumer electronics and BFSI segment. The company is present in five countries and has acquired and integrated overseas ITeS-BPO companies in the past two years.

 The proceeds from the Hutch stake sale will be used to fund these acquisitions before the end of the current financial year.

 The board has also decided to evaluate the business opportunities for Hinduja TMT. 

 The company has announced a special dividend of 200 per cent or Rs 20 per share to shareholders from the proceeds of the Hutchison Essar stake sale. This is in addition to the final dividend of 75 per cent or Rs 7.50 per share for the last fiscal.

 The Hinduja TMT scrip, however, lost Rs 24.05 or 4.04 per cent in todays trading session and ended the day at Rs 571.40 against yesterdays close of Rs 595.45 amidst volumes of over 4 lakh shares.

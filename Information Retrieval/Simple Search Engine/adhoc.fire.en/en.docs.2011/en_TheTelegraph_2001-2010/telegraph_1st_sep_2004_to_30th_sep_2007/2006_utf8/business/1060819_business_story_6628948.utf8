 Roongta: Top job

 New Delhi, Aug. 18: The Congress-led government finally appointed S.K. Roongta to the top job at the Steel Authority of India Ltd after months of dilly dallying which saw several rounds of lobbying by various quarters. 

 The appointment came through late last night. Roongta, who had earlier been given temporary charge of the company, will be chairman-cum-managing director for three years. 

 An engineer with a degree in global trade, Roongta has been marketing SAIL steel for most of his career. Roongta and P.K. Bishnoi, director of Rashtriya Ispat Nigam, were the two contenders for the job. Their names were forwarded to the Prime Ministers office for selection. 

 The Public Sector Enterprise Recruitment Board had chosen Roongta, taking into account his track record, sources said. However, the steel ministry, which runs SAIL, was not exactly happy with the choice and insisted on a second name being added to the list.

 Roongta was finally appointed to the top job with the concurrence of the steel ministry though, at one stage, he had reportedly fallen foul of steel minister Ram Vilas Paswan after several MPs wrote letters to the minister questioning the spot coal purchases by SAIL two years back.

 But Paswan and Roongta have obviously kissed and made up and the two have had a quarterly review meeting of SAILs performance yesterday. 

 Paswan has made it clear to the SAIL top brass that the government wants it to complete its major expansion programmes within 2009. 

 Paswan, in an oblique reference to L.N. Mittal and his plans to get a slice of Chiria mines, has told SAIL officials that the state-run firm would have to finetune its strategy as steel makers were now competing globally and it would be facing hotter competition even on domestic turf.

 SAIL plans to expand its production capacity from the annual level of 14.5 million tonnes to around 22.5 million tonnes at a cost of Rs 37,000 crore. Most of it will come from internal accruals.

Chiria mines

The government today warned that production and expansion 

of SAILs steel mills at Bokaro and Burnpur would be affected if the Jharkhand 

government terminates the companys mining lease in Chiria. It would 

be difficult for SAIL to continue optimum production and it will fail to achieve 

its growth plan as envisaged in its corporate plan 2011-23, minister of 

state for steel Akhilesh Das said.

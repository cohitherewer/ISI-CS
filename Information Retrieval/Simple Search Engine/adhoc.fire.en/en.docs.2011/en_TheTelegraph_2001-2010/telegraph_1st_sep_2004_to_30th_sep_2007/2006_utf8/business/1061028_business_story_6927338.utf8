 Shipping ties with Pak set to be revived

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi, Oct. 27: The cabinet today approved the signing of a revised shipping protocol between India and Pakistan to allow ships from both countries to call at each others ports to lift cargo.

 The protocol, which is designed to boost two-way sea trade between the two countries, will also allow the lifting of third country cargo from each others ports. 

 The protocol will restore shipping services between the two countries after a gap of nearly 35 years.

 It is expected to enhance tonnage under both the flags and also result in competitive shipping rates, P.R. Das Munshi, minister for information and broadcasting, told reporters after the cabinet meeting.

 The signing of the proposal comes ahead of crucial foreign secretary-level talks. Foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon and his Pakistani counterpart Riaz Mohammad Khan are scheduled to meet in the capital later this month to discuss a host of issues.

 The shipping protocol with Pakistan, a confidence building measure after the 1971 IndoPak War, was restrictive in nature as it barred lifting of cargo from ports of both the countries destined for other contracting states by third country flag vessels.

 According to industry data available, official bilateral trade flows between India and Pakistan has doubled from $250 million to $500 million over the last three years, but Pakistan is not keen to increase imports from India.

 During 2004-05, exports from India were around $440 million, while imports from Pakistan were about $60 million. This adverse balance of trade has been worrying Pakistan as they fear that cheap Indian goods will flood its market.

 The current estimated unofficial trade of $1 billion between the two countries is mostly routed through Dubai. Officials in the ministry say it remains to be seen whether trade barriers can be lifted so that it comes through the official route.

 The cabinet today gave its approval for procurement, through a global tender, of 4 fixed X ray and 3 mobile Gamma ray container scanners at a cost of Rs. 172.94 crore for installation at Mumbai, Chennai, Tuticorin and Kandla Ports.

The CCEA also cleared an additional investment of 

Rs 287.17 crore in the Jhanjra Phase-II longwall underground mine to create a 

coal production capacity of 1.70 million tonnes a year.

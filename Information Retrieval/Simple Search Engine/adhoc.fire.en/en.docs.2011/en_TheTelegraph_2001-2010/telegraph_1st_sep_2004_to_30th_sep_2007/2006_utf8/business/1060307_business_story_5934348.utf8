 Birlas launch new offensive in Idea war

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 6: The Aditya Vikram Birla Group stepped up its attack on the Tatas by shooting off another letter to the government today charging the Tatas of creating a smoke screen and refusing to reduce their stake in the joint venture, Idea Cellular Ltd, as mandated by the telecom licence conditions.

 The consequences to the business of Idea, and to the telecom policy objective that competition wont be compromised are serious and pressing. The department of telecom (DoT) may please make its determination at the earliest, said the letter.

 Even if Tata Sons, the holding company of the Tatas, alone is named the promoter of Tata Teleservices, it cannot itself have any (direct or indirect) stake in Idea. Tata Sons has a stake in Idea through Tata Industries, which is clearly impermissible, the letter noted. 

 The DoT is entitled to reject any representations made to it regarding the characterisation of a promoter. It is nearing a month since we drew your attention as we believed we were obliged to, it added, asking DoT to investigate the reality.

 In fact, the DoT is not only entitled and empowered to investigate (the) reality, but also is under an obligation to do so when an evidence (of reality) is placed before it, the letter mentioned. 

 Idea Cellular was created after a merger between Tata groups GSM business and Birla AT amp;T. The telecom company currently operates in seven telecom circles, including Maharashtra, Gujarat and Delhi.

 The Birlas, through Aditya Birla Nuvo Limited, hold a 50.14 per cent stake in Idea Cellular, while the Tatas have 48.14 per cent. 

 The Birlas want the Tata group to reduce its equity to below 10 per cent to comply with the licence conditions as it is also providing a CDMA service under the brand name, Tata Indicom.

 The existing licence conditions stipulate that a company cannot hold more than 10 per cent in more than one licensee company in the same service area for basic, cellular and unified access service. 

 Stating that non-compliance by the Tatas were grave, wide ranging and comprehensive, Aditya Birla Nuvo Ltd today accused the Tata group of trying to create a smoke-screen to cover up the fact that none of the Tata group companies were permitted to have any stake in Idea.

 The Birlas backed the arguments with excerpts of the article of association of Idea and also the draft prospectus of the rights issue of Tata Teleservices Ltd.

 The latest missive from the Birlas comes in response to the termination notice which the Tatas had sent to them for flouting shareholders agreement by making confidential information public.

 It put the the Birla group on a 90-day notice period, following which the Tatas would proceed to buy out their partners stake in the joint venture at a default price.

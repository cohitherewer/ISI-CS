 Telecom needs to answer reality call

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 27: Even as it complimented the telecom service providers for improving tele-density in the country, the Economic Survey today warned that Internet and convergence would throw open new challenges that would have to be harnessed.

 The telecom sector would need to address and harness the challenges being posed to it by the Internet and the convergence architecture, said the Survey.

 A rapidly expanding telecom sector and intense competition amongst the various service providers have resulted in improvement in quality of the services and their affordability, it said.

 The survey also termed broadband services where voice, video and data are offered on a single platform as the next frontier.

 The number of broadband subscribers has increased from 49,000 in December 2004 to 7.5 lakh in November 2005.

 These numbers would, however, need to increase substantially to be comparable with other Asian countries, it stated.

 Increasingly, the mobile phone is being viewed as the instrument that will help bridge the digital divide. Competition and a growing economy will continue to raise the performance bar for the telecom sector in the medium term, said the survey.

 Listing out development in the sector, including a teledensity of 11.32 per cent, up from 2.32 per cent in 1999, the survey said that though the government has adopted a technology neutral policy, the scarce spectrum needed to be allocated efficiently to maximise its economic value. Although Indias 125 million strong telephone network including mobile phones is one of the largest in the world, the telephone penetration rate continues to be low at about 11.32 per cent per hundred population. The country offers vast avenues for growth, said the survey.

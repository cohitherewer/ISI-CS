 Public sector officers threaten strike

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 11: The officers associations of Coal India, National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC), Steel Authority of India, Power Finance Corporation and National Hydel Power Corporation today threatened to stage protests if their salaries were not revised on the same lines as those of central government staff. 

 The joint forum, representing 46,000 officers of these public sector enterprises, said the stir, which would start on August 1 with gate meetings, dharnas and hunger strikes, would take the form of an indefinite strike from September 12.

 The forum has accused senior IAS officers of having stalled the pay revision package of public sector staff while getting their own salaries hiked.

 This is a clear case of discrimination against officers of public sector companies who are also entitled to a merger of 50 per cent of their dearness allowance with basic pay with effect from January 1, 2005, said Rakesh Pandey, secretary-general of NTPC Executives Federation.

 The joint forum said while this merger has been implemented in the case of central government staff, it has been denied to public sector officials. 

 The Justice Mohan committee had put public sector officials on an equal footing with the central government staff on the issue of dearness allowance neutralisation and yet the step has not been implemented. 

 The forum has also demanded financial autonomy for public sector units to decide the pay and perks of their employees.

 The officers association of oil PSUs had also threatened to go on strike, but have held their move in abeyance following a court directive on the issue.

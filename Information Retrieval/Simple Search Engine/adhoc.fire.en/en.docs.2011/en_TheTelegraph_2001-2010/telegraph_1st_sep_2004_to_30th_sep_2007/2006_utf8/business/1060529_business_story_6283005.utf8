 India, Kenya brace for CTC cup of woe

 A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta, May 28: India and Kenya, the leading producers of CTC tea, are expected to show a decline in crop output by 45 million kg in the first six months of 2006.

 According to the Tea Board and industry estimates, the north Indian crop for April would be substantially lower at 8-10 million kg.

 In Kenya, the April production has increased to 30.4 million kg, up 4.5 per cent from last year. 

 However, cumulative production till date lagged behind that in the same period last year by 34 million kg.

 Of the 1,100-1,150 million kg produced globally, 21 per cent is green tea (mostly China), 41-42 per cent is orthodox from Sri Lanka, Indonesia and Vietnam, and 37 per cent is CTC produced in India and the African nations.

 ?The May crop is likely to be down due to the high temperature of 37-39 degrees in north Bengal. Kenya had a record crop in May last year, which would not be replicated this year due to the existing shortfall, coupled with weather conditions,? said Gautam Bhalla, executive director of Warren Tea.

 While the orthodox is consumed in 50 countries, the bulk of CTC is consumed in Pakistan (170 million kg consumption with 98 per cent opting for CTC), India (770-790 million kg consumption with 96 per cent going for CTC), the UK (120-130 million kg with 85 per cent CTC), Egypt (85 to 90 million kg with 95 per cent CTC) and partly in Russia.

 ?This shortfall, which is manifested in buoyant markets in the CTC consuming countries, will not immediately lead to a significant global spot shortage. In due course, if the shortfall increases, the projected rate of 2 per cent oversupply of tea in the world markets in the coming years might be cut down to 1 per cent,? said Basudeb Banerjee, chairman of the Tea Board.

 Markets around the world have become dearer. In India, the markets are up by Rs 10 to Rs 12 compared with the same period last year.

 ?This is just the tip of the iceberg. The rate at which Kenya is going, the country will still experience a 10 to 16 per cent annual drop in crop output. However, now that the Indian crop is also down, all the CTC centres of the world will have buoyant markets,? said Deepak Khaitan, vice-chairman, McLeod Russel.

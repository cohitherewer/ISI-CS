 Hindalco arm set for listing Down Under

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, April 10: Aditya Birla Minerals Ltd, a wholly- owned subsidiary of Hindalco Industries Ltd, is set to be listed on the Australian Stock Exchange. The subsidiary is planning to raise about Australian $299 million through an initial public offering (IPO), which will open on April 20 and close on May 10.

 Aditya Birla Minerals (ABML) had earlier planned to raise Australian $250 million. The company today filed its prospectus with the Australian Securities amp; Investments Commission, Hindalco informed stock exchanges.

 ABML is planning to float over 15.35 crore shares at an offer price of Australian $1.95 per share. Based on this price, Birla Minerals will have a market capitalisation of around Australian $611 million. Following the offer, Hindalcos ownership in the company will come down to 51 per cent. 

 Funds raised from the offer will be used to repay existing loans of Hindalco apart from financing the enhanced exploration activities. According to the company, after repaying the debts, the remaining funds will be utilised to pursue development activities as well as look at acquisition opportunities.

 The recent commissioning of an operation in western Australia will make ABML the fourth largest producer of copper products in Down Under.

 ABML was established in 2003 by Hindalco to acquire and develop copper in Australia. Apart from the Nifty Copper Mine, its other major asset is Mount Gordon Copper Mine. 

 Hindalco had acquired the Nifty Mine in 2003 along with rights to explore seven other mines for Rs 255 crore. Later, it acquired the Mount Gordon Mine for over Rs 60 crore. These two mines now meet one-fourth of the companys raw material requirement.

 The Hindalco subsidiary is optimistic over the current trends in copper consumption, as there is an increasing demand from construction, industrial and electrical sectors in Asia and other markets.

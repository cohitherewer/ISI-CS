 Reliance Comm gets DoT call on GSM phone

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 14: The department of telecommunications has asked Anil Ambanis Reliance Communications to furnish more details on its plan to roll out GSM services in the country. 

 Sources said Reliance may be asked to vacate some of its CDMA spectrum in order to roll out GSM services. We have sought more details from Reliance on its plans to offer services on GSM technology, they said. 

 The department feels Reliance plans to completely migrate to GSM-based technology for mobile services and exit CDMA as, in its application, it has sought spectrum for GSM wherever it is available. 

 Reliance offers GSM services in the east and Northeast circles, including Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa and Bihar. Under the unified access service licence for telecom, companies can use either GSM or CDMA or a mix of these and other technologies to offer services. 

 Reliance is undertaking a major expansion of its GSM-based services in its eight operations spread across the country. This is apart from its plans to start new operations in Delhi and Mumbai. 

 The company plans to add around 10-12 million GSM lines. Sources said the investment is expected to be close to Rs 1,600 crore, of which a significant portion will be spent on purchasing equipment. The defence authorities have agreed to vacate 45 MHz of spectrum for telecom. 

 Reliance had approached the government seeking spectrum in 1800 Mhz frequency to start GSM services in Mumbai and Delhi circles. Sources said Reliance would be applying for more circles across the country. 

 The company has a two- crore subscriber base in the CDMA space in the country. Offering GSM services is expected to boost its subscriber base immensely by adding users in Delhi and Mumbai. 

 In India, of the total 100 million mobile connections, over 75.3 million are based on GSM technology.

 Calcutta, Aug. 9: Tata Ryerson Ltd, a 50:50 joint venture between Tata Steel and Ryerson Tull of the US, is planning to set up a steel servicing plant in Bengal.

 The company, which provides customised steel products to end-consumers in various industries like automobile, will take up a plot close to the proposed small car plant of Tata Motors.

 The small car unit will come up at Singur in Hooghly. The state government is in the process of acquiring 1,000 acres. While Tata Motors will use 700 acres, the remaining land, earmarked for vendors, would be the location for Tata Ryersons new plant.

 Tata Ryerson managing director Sandipan Chakravorty declined to comment on the proposed unit.

 Tata Ryerson, which has been growing at an exponential rate of 60 per cent CAGR, is also tagging along with Tata Motors in Uttaranchal.

 The auto company is setting up a light commercial vehicle (LCV) manufacturing unit at Pantanagar.

 Tata Steel will supply the steel required while a full-fledged service centre will be built by Tata Ryerson. 

 The company has acquired 6.3 acres there and plans to invest Rs 45 crore.

 Industry observers expect the Bengal plant to be on similar lines.

 Since the Rs 1-lakh car will roll out in 2008, Tata Ryersons Bengal unit has to come up simultaneously.

 As soon as Tata Motors gets the land, Tata Ryerson will also move in there, they said.

 Tata Ryerson will provide steel products for the cars made by Tata Motors.

 Turnover target

 While Singur will be the first manufacturing unit of the Calcutta headquartered company in Bengal, it is lining up a few more units across the country. Chakravorty said the company aimed to double turnover in two years. It has posted a turnover of Rs 754 crore in 2005-06 after handling 1 million tonnes of steel.

 We will cross Rs 1,000 crore in turnover this year and Rs 1,500 crore by 2007-08, he said.

 The company wants to handle 2 mt steel by 2008 instead of its earlier deadline of 2010. It is setting up cold-rolled and rebar processing units at Faridabad to tap the booming automobile and infrastructure markets, respectively.

 Tata Ryerson has also forayed into stainless steel business with its Trynox brand. Chakravorty said it is hoping to get a 10 per cent market share in this segment by 2010.

 Pune, Mumbai, Hyderabad and Bangalore would be important markets for stainless steel, which will be used in consumer durables, appliances, automotive, railway and transport sectors.

 Cigarettes, hotels boost ITC earnings

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Oct. 30: ITC has recorded an 18.7 per cent jump in its earnings for the second quarter, backed by strong revenues from cigarettes and hotels. The companys net profit stood at Rs 679.6 crore compared with Rs 572.33 crore in the same period last year.

 Its net income grew 31.2 per cent to Rs 2,967.12 crore from Rs 2,261.21 crore. The earning per share in this quarter was Rs 1.81.

 The non-cigarette business now contributes 51.2 per cent of companys revenue, even though it continues to be the main driver of profitability.

 On pre-tax and interest basis, cigarette accounted for 82.1 per cent of ITCs profit in the second quarter.

 Sequentially, the net income in the second quarter went up by 1.1 per cent over the first quarter of this year.

 On profit after tax basis, the sequential growth was 4.1 per cent over the first quarter of this year. 

 The non-cigarette businesses during the second quarter grew by 53 per cent.

 The key growth drivers were the foods business, higher agri-business revenues and a strong performance by hotels and cigarette.

 The non-cigarette FMCG, which include branded garments like Wills Lifestyle and John Players, greetings, gifting, stationery, packaged foods like Sunfeast, agarbatti and matchbox, grew from Rs 246.90 crore in the second quarter last year to Rs 409.6 crore this year.

 However, profitability of this section continued to be a drag, suffering a loss of Rs 48.98 crore compared with Rs 35.34 crore in the year-ago period.

 The hotels business posted a strong performance during the quarter with segment revenues growing by 31 per cent to touch Rs 201 crore on the back of a 37 per cent growth in room rent. Segment results (PBIT) during the quarter touched Rs 58 crore, representing a growth of 110 per cent over the same period last year.

 Agribusiness revenues recorded a growth of 87 per cent during the quarter driven primarily by exports of leaf tobacco and increased levels of trade in soya, non-basmati rice, chana and coffee. Segment results (PBIT) touched Rs 46 crore, representing a growth of 9 per cent over last year.

 The ITC board, which met in Calcutta today to approve the quarterly result, also recommended a new employee stock option scheme whereby approval from shareholders will be sought by way of postal ballots. The board also appointed S.H. Khan, former chairman and managing director of IDBI, as an additional non-executive independent director of the company.

 The stock ended flat today, down by 30 paise to close at Rs 187.50.

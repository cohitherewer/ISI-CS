 LOOSE CHANGE

 Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund has suspended fresh sales in its open-end diversified equity fund ? Franklin India Prima Fund ? from February 4 for six months. The scheme, which invests in the mid and small-cap stocks, has grown from Rs 633 crore in December 2003 to Rs 2,226 crore in December 2005. The fund house feels it is prudent to cap fresh inflows until they are certain about the stability in the mid and small-cap segments. Investors, however, can redeem their investments, at any time. 

 Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance Company has launched four unit-linked insurance products ? Unitgain Premier, Unitgain Super, Familygain and Healthcare. Premier is a death cover that offers an upfront allocation of 105 per cent, while Super has an allocation of 93 per cent. Familygain has options of accidental death benefit and disability benefit. Healthcare policy has a flat premium for three years. 

 Chola Mutual Fund has launched Chola Contra Fund, an open-ended fund that will invest 65 per cent in equity and equity-related instruments. The fund will buy into fundamentally sound companies that have underperformed in the recent past. It will close for subscription on February 14.

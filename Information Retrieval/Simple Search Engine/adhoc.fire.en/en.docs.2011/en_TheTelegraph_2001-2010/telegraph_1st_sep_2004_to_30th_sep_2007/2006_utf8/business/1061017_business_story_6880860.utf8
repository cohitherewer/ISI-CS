 Samsung profit rises 16%

 Seoul, Oct. 16 (AP): Samsung Electronics today said its net profit rose 16 per cent in the third quarter on strong sales of its mainstay memory chips.

 Samsung earned 2.19 trillion won ($2.3 billion) in the three months ended September 30, the company said in a statement. Samsung posted net profit of 1.88 trillion won a year earlier. Sales during the quarter rose 4.7 per cent to 15.22 trillion won ($15.9 billion).

 Samsung is the worlds largest memory chip maker and a top producer of consumer electronics, including flat-screen televisions, mobile phone handsets, mp3 players and laptop computers. The result, better than expected, was Samsungs third profit gain in the past four quarters. 

 The average estimate of nine analysts surveyed by Dow Jones newswires forecast that the company would post a net profit of 1.9 trillion won ($2 billion) on sales of 15.32 trillion won ($16 billion).

 Samsung said profit margins were boosted by its memory chip business as it took advantage of a global surge in prices of dynamic random access memory, or dram chips.

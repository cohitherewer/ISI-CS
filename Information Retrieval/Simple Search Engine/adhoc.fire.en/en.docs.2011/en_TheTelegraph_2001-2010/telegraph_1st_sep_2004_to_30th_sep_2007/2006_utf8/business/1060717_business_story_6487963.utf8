 Toyota eyes GM tie-up

 Chicago, July 16 (AFP): Japanese auto giant Toyota Motor is considering proposing an alliance with General Motors to prevent its US rival from forming a three-way tie-up with Renault and Nissan, Businessweek has reported.

 Citing people with knowledge of the Japanese auto makers plans, the magazine said yesterday Toyota had war-gamed a proposal to assist the struggling GM, the worlds largest auto maker, and head off a deal that would create a monolithic automotive group.

 Toyota has no interest in seeing an alliance like this (linking Renault, Nissan and GM) taking place, an executive was quoted as saying.

 Businessweek said Whether Toyota actually makes a bid remains to be seen.

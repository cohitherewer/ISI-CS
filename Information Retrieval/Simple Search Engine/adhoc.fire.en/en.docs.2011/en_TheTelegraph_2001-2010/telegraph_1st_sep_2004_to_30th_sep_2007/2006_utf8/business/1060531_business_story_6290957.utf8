 New Delhi, May 30: Hero Honda Motors (HHM) today announced a 1,000 per cent dividend and an investment of Rs 550 crore to set up its third plant in Jaipur.

 The company has also lined up eight launches this fiscal, including a fuel injection model in the 125-cc segment.

 This is the third year in a row that the company has announced a high dividend. The total amount of outflow on account of dividend of Rs 20 per share, including withholding tax, would be Rs 455.39 crore.

 Hero Honda has posted a 20 per cent jump in bottomlines for 2005-06 at Rs 971.3 crore against Rs 810.4 crore in the previous year.

 Managing director Pawan Munjal, however, said, Operating margins in the current fiscal would be under tremendous pressure because of a steep rise in input costs.

 Operating margins for 2005-06 was 15.70 per cent, marginally lower than 15.75 per cent in the previous year.

 The companys total turnover was up 17 per cent at Rs 8,866.7 crore against Rs 7,558.5 crore in 2004-05.

 However, Hero Hondas shares slipped 4.83 per cent on the BSE to Rs 803.7 from the previous close of Rs 844.4.

 For the quarter ended March 31, 2006, its net profit was up 29 per cent at Rs 267.1 crore from Rs 207.1 crore. Total turnover was up 16 per cent at Rs 2,298.9 crore against Rs 1,976 crore.

 Unveiling plans for the third plant, Munjal said, It will be commissioned within a year and will have an initial capacity of 5 lakh units, which is expandable to 10 lakh. Total investments to reach full capacity will be around Rs 550 crore, he added.

 The company is also planning to set up a fourth plant. We are looking at various options for one more plant after the third, said Munjal, refusing to divulge details.

 The company is gradually scaling up capacity at both its existing plants at Dharuhera and Gurgaon, Haryana.

 A capacity addition of 4.5 lakh units at the Gurgaon plant has been completed at an investment of Rs 47 crore. The addition of 4.5 lakh units at the Dharuhera plant at an investment of Rs 96 crore is underway. It will be operational by August 2006, he said. The annual capacity is expected to be 39 lakh units by September.

 The investments for the new plant would be through internal accruals, he said.

 On a possible bike price hike due to pressure on margins, he said, Current market dynamics make it extremely difficult to pass on costs to customers.

 We will introduce eight new bikes this fiscal. This includes four new models and an equal number of variants, Munjal said.

 The launches will be across all three segments ? entry, executive and top-end.

 In the motorcycle market, Hero Honda Motors is facing stiff competition from its rival Bajaj Auto.

 Hero Honda Motors will launch a fuel-injection model next month with the Glamour F1. Honda debuts this technology globally in 125-cc with Hero Honda, he said.

 Bajaj Auto also announced similar plans on its flagship model Pulsar. The Pune-based company said it would launch three motorcycles and two scooters in 2006 as it hopes to touch 2.3 million units in bike sales this fiscal. Munjal, however, said there were no plans to introduce any new scooter models where it just has one model ? Pleasure.

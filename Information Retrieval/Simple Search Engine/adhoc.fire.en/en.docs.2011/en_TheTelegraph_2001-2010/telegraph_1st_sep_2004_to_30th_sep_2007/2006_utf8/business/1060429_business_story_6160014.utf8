 BoB jacks up interest rates 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Khandelwal: Timely step

 Mumbai, April 28: The Bank of Baroda (BoB) has raised its benchmark prime lending rate (BPLR) by half a per cent to 11 per cent. This will make its floating home loan rates dearer by 50 basis points. The bank has also raised its deposit rates by the same margin.

 These decisions were taken at a meeting of the banks asset liability committee (ALCO) today. BoB is the first nationalised bank to raise the benchmark lending rate. There is a possibility that other public sector banks may also raise their lending rates next month. A rate hike in housing loans is likely after the Reserve Bank of Indias annual policy statement this month, in which it raised the provisioning on residential housing loans beyond Rs 20 lakh to 1.0 per cent from 0.40 per cent.

 According to A.K. Khandelwal, chairman amp; managing director of BoB, lending rates will be hiked to re-price loans that have been given at low rates. Senior bank officials said an increase in the benchmark lending rate was needed as it was lower than that charged by its counterparts, particularly in the private sector space. While all floating loan rates of BoB will become dearer with effect from May 1, the fixed rates will remain unchanged.

 Meanwhile BoB has reported a strong set of numbers for the fourth quarter ended March 31. Khandelwal said his next priority is to put BoBs subsidiaries ? BoB Cards Ltd, BoB Asset Management Company and BoB Capital Markets ? on a strong footing.

 The recast of these subsidiaries may also see the bank roping in a foreign company as a strategic partner, he added. We are looking for a partner in BoB Capital, BoB Asset Management and BoB Cards, he said. This partner could bring better skills, technology and knowhow, he added. The bank has posted a 107 per cent rise in net profit for the fourth quarter ended March 31. Net profit rose to Rs 208.80 crore, up from Rs 101.04 crore in the corresponding period last year.

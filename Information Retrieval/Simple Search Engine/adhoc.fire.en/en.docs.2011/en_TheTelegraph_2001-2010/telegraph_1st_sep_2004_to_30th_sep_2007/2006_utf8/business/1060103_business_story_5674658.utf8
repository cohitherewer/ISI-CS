 Trai unveils convergence blueprint

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 One for all

 New Delhi, Jan. 2: The telecom regulator today sowed the seeds of a convergence regime once again. 

 The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) has released a consultation paper on convergence and competition, which is based on the individual recommendations given by it earlier on various issues.

 Under the convergence plan, telecommunications, information technology and broadcasting may be bundled under one regulatory authority or possibly a single ministry.

 The NDA government?s attempts to bring in telecom convergence in 2003 had failed. The bill that was introduced in Parliament was sent to the parliamentary select committee on convergence whose recommendations are still pending before the government.

 The consultation paper on convergence and competition in broadcasting and telecommunications is based on the report of a committee that was set up by Trai to examine issues related to broadband and telephony over cable TV networks.

 The paper focuses on the need to converge all aspects of regulating the telecom and broadcasting industries.

 It states that convergence is already a reality. The technological developments, which are bringing down the boundaries created by service-specific licenses, are also preparing consumers for new services.

 Convergence is a powerful force in bringing about greater competition. A well-designed scheme of regulation that helps convergence can vastly increase the competitiveness and hence the efficiency of the country?s economy. This is all the more important in an era of growing importance of information and communications, the paper said.

 Trai has introduced the idea of convergence and alternative definitions of convergence as well as the various approaches to it.

 The paper also examines the impact of convergence on markets, regulations and consumers. It speaks about the developments taking place world-wide on bringing about convergence in regulation.

 It also mentions the problems faced by the Indian telecom sector due to a lack of converged regulation. The paper mentions the recommendations of the committee on broadband and telephony over cable TV networks.

 It also dwells on the need for a comprehensive legal framework for promoting convergence, approach to unified licensing, technology and service neutral spectrum licensing.

 Lifetime offers

 Trai has initiated an exercise to review the lifetime validity cards offered by cellular operators, adds PTI. It has undertaken a suo motu exercise to see whether the concept of lifetime validity was viable and is likely to give its verdict in a day or so.

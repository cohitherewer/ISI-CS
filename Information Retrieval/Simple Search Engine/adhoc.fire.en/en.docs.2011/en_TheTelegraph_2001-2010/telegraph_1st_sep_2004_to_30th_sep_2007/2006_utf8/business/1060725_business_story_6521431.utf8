 BG profit jumps 46% in second quarter

 London, July 24 (Reuters): Gas producer BG Group has reported a 46 per cent jump in second-quarter net profit excluding one-off items, due to higher prices and production, but still undershot analysts forecasts. 

 BG said its underlying profit was ?401 million, but including a tax charge related to the first quarter, the result was ?325 million, below an average forecast of ?366 million from a Reuters poll of nine analysts. 

 BG shares fell 2.1 per cent to 695-1/2 pence at 9:43 am, compared with a 0.04 per cent rise in the DJ Stoxx European oil and gas sector index.

 A spokeswoman said BG missed the earnings forecast mainly because of lower-than-expected profits at its liquefied natural gas business. 

 The operating gain was powered by high oil and gas prices and a forecast-beating 25 per cent rise in production. 

 Oil prices were 35 per cent higher in the quarter compared with the same period of 2005, while UK gas prices were around 30 per cent stronger. 

 BG group chief executive Frank Chapman said the company remained on track to meet its production target and that its portfolio of projects remained on schedule. 

 We continued to add to our exploration portfolio, and made good progress on key projects keeping our growth programme on track, he said. 

 Including all one-off items, net profit was ?418 million, down 14 per cent from the same period of 2005, when profits were boosted by the sale of a stake in a Kazakh oil field. BG said oil and gas production rose to 611,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd), ahead of a forecast 600,000 boepd, due to an increase in production at fields in Egypt and Kazakhstan.

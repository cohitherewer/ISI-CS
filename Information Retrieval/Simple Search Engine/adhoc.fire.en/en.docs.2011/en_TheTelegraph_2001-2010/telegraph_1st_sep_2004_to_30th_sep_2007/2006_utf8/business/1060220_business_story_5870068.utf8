 Shristi hotels to embrace Vedic age

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Feb. 19: Shristi Urban Infrastructure Development Limited, a 60:40 joint venture between Shristi Infrastructure Development Corporation and the Housing amp; Urban Development Corporation (Hudco), is mulling over a pan-India hotel chain under the brand name Vedic Hotels. 

 During the next 15 years, the company plans to come up with 75 properties that will have a strong focus on traditional Indian lifestyle. 

 The construction of the first property will commence in 2008, said Sujit Kanoria, managing director, Shristi Urban Infrastructure Development Ltd. He pointed out that this would be the first time that Shristi would build up a management team to take charge of the Vedic Hotels project without roping in an operating partner. 

 The chain would be a combination of two, three, four and five star properties depending upon the location and requirement and would be named as Vedic Motels, Inns or Hotels. 

 The properties will be built in metros, cities and towns. 

 We are right now in the stage of finalising the locations for the first phase development, Kanoria mentioned. 

 The project cost will be met through internal accruals depending on phase-wise investment. The company may also consider raising money from the capital market. 

 For Shristi Infrastructure, this is the first step in developing a hospitality division in joint venture with Hudco. 

 Hudco is open to joint ventures in real estate and infrastructure but the shape of the subsequent projects would depend on the market demand. Hudco officials on the board will monitor the progress of these projects on a regular basis, said P.S. Rana, chairman and managing director, Hudco.

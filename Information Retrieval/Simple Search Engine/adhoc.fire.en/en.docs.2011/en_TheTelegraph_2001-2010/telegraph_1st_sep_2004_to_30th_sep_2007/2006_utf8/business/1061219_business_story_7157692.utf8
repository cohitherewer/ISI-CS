 Auction option before panel to pick Corus winner

 AMIT ROY 

 London, Dec. 18: The battle between Tata Steel and CSN of Brazil for Corus may be settled through auction to avoid a protracted battle. 

 Financial News, a securities and investment banking weekly, today reported that the UKs Panel on Takeover and Mergers was talking to all three parties to discuss a possible auction. 

 The takeover panel is an independent body established in 1968 to supervise and regulate takeovers and to ensure fair treatment for all shareholders in takeover bids.

 Questioned about the possibility, a Corus spokesman was non-committal when approached by The Telegraph but did not rule out the possibility of an auction All parties are continuing their dialogue with the takeover panel as they have done throughout the process. 

 Tatas last offer of 500pence per Corus share was trumped by CSNs 515pence. 

 If the takeover panel intervenes, it will be a rare event which has occurred only thrice before in its history. 

 According to the weekly, the panel may opt either for sealed bids where offers are final or a standard auction held over a period of days. 

 We have a situation where there are two buyers and you need some mechanism to decide the winner, the panels deputy director-general, Anthony Pullinger, told Financial News. 

 He said the panel would take representations from the three parties. He declined to comment on current discussions. 

 According to the financial weekly, The panel is set to intervene because both bids are being made under a scheme of arrangement that requires court approval and is not tied to the 60-day deadline stipulated by the panel for traditional UK public company takeovers. The terms of CSNs pre-conditional offer remain valid till July 20, 2007, resulting in a long period of uncertainty for Corus and its shareholders. 

 One lawyer told the paper: The code was written at a time when schemes of arrangement were not fashionable. Sooner or later the panel will have to intervene. 

 Share buying binge

 There are unconfirmed reports that both Tata and CSN have been buying Corus shares in an effort to position themselves for the end game. Driven by the interest from the two bidders, Corus shares have reached the stratospheric levels of 529 pence. Shareholders must wonder whether their value will hold at this level or slip dramatically, in which case now might be a good time to sell.

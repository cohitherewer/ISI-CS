 Gold tumbles

 Mumbai, May 18 (PTI): Gold prices tumbled across the board today, shedding between Rs 300 and Rs 320 per 10 gram, as stockists off-loaded part of their holdings, influenced by weak overseas trend.

 Gold suffered the most in Mumbai, losing Rs 320 at Rs 10,180 followed by a loss of Rs 315 in Chennai at Rs 10,310 per 10 gram, respectively. In Calcutta, it lost Rs 305 at Rs 10,355 and in Delhi it quoted Rs 300 lower at Rs 10,300.

 Silver prices, too, suffered. It lost Rs 1,200 at Rs 20,000 per kilo in Delhi and Rs 935 at Rs 20,255 in Chennai. In Calcutta, it fell by Rs 800 at Rs 19,600 and in Mumbai by Rs 725 at Rs 20,310.

 The selling pressure triggered on reports of a weak trend in international markets as some investors, who benefited from the metals surge to a 26-year high this year, sold judging the rally to be overdone.

 Approaching the end of current marriage season also reduced the demand and impact the trading sentiment to some extent.

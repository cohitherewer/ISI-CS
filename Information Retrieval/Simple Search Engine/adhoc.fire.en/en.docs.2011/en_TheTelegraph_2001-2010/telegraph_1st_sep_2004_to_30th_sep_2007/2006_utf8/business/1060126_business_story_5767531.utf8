 RBI move to shield bank fraud busters

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Jan. 25: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has made the first stab at framing a policy aimed at protecting whistleblowers who squeal about shenanigans and sharp practices in private and foreign banks.

 The RBI today floated a discussion paper on a proposed scheme titled Protected Disclosure Scheme for Private and Foreign Banks that seeks to create a conducive environment in which employees, customers, stakeholders and NGOs can lodge complaints against errant banks and dodgy officials.

 The scheme will cover all private sector and foreign banks operating in the country. It will also extend to other RBI-regulated entities such as co-operative banks, local area banks and non-banking financial companies in due course. 

 Complaints under the plan will cover corruption, misuse of office, criminal offences, suspected or actual fraud, failure to comply with existing rules and regulations and acts resulting in financial or operational loss and even those detrimental to public interest.

 The RBI will be the nodal agency to receive complaints under the scheme. However, the central bank will not cover any anonymous or pseudonymous complaints. 

 The name and address of an individual has to be mentioned in the beginning or end of the letter or in an attached letter. However, the RBI said the text of the complaint should be drafted in a manner so as not to reveal the complainants identity. 

 The RBI will keep the identity of the complainant secret, except in cases of misleading or false complaints. In such cases, the institutions against whom such complaints have been made would also be allowed to take action against the complainant. If the identity of the complainant is disclosed inspite of contrary directions of the RBI, the central bank will be authorised to take appropriate action against the person or agency making such disclosure and also to suitably compensate the complainant. 

 This is definitely a right step towards protecting the rights of an individual who takes such steps to protect public interest. As such enactments has no precedence, it would be purely speculative to guess at the actual effectiveness of such a scheme, said Neel Chatterjee, senior vice-president, head (corporate affairs), South East and South Asia, Standard Chartered Bank.

 India Inc for security check

 GARIMA SINGH

 New Delhi, Sept 6: India Inc will support the government in its bid to block FDI that may pose a security threat to the country.

 Assocham president Anil K. Agarwal said the chamber supported the move for a policy to bar FDI in sensitive sectors. 

 Security is paramount and cannot be compromised in any way. If the government is objecting investment in some areas, we are certain it has valid reasons to do so, he said.

 The government is planning legislation to keep out foreign investment on security grounds as well as ban participation of foreign players in tenders of public sector companies. 

 On the other hand, investments in any other sectors is welcome. We want the world to realise that we are a very investor-friendly destination, Agarwal added.

 Indian industry believes the proposed legislation will not hinder the flow of foreign direct investment (FDI) into the country.

 The legislation itself should not hurt foreign investment; whats critical is the way the government uses its power to deal with foreign direct investment proposals. The government must ensure transparency in the process, R. Seshasayee, chief of the Confederation of Indian Industry, said.

 Echoing similar views, a senior official from the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci) said, Investment in ports and telecom sector have strategic implications. The government cannot afford to give a free hand to countries like China, a superpower in our neighbourhood.

 The chambers want the government to place all foreign direct investment proposals up to $500 million under the Reserve Bank of Indias automatic route. 

 An industry analyst said there was a need for a time bound clearance not exceeding more than three months, subject to necessary approvals.

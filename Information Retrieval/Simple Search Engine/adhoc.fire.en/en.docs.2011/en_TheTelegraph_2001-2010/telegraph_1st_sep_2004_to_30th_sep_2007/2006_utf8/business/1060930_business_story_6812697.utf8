 Brand appeal

 Mumbai, Sept. 29: Indus League Clothing Ltd, a Future Group company, has entered into a 50:50 joint venture with the Lee Cooper group to market the latters products in India. This alliance comes only days after Arvind Brands entered into a similar agreement with VF Corporation. 

 The Future Group, headed by the Biyanis of Pantaloon, and Lee Cooper, will develop lifestyle and fashion products under the Lee Cooper brand and they will also engage in wholesale and retail franchising activities for the purpose of marketing and distributing various products. The joint venture shall also undertake retailing of Lee Cooper brand products subject to necessary approvals. 

 The Lee Cooper group is a designer, distributor and marketer of branded jeans, clothing, accessories, and footwear. With global retail sales of over $500 million, it is among the top-three brand of jeans in most countries in Europe. 

 Commenting on the alliance, Michael Capper, CEO (Asia Pacific) for Lee Cooper Group Ltd, said: The Pantaloon group is the largest in retail in India and its group company, Indus League, has a superlative reputation for apparel brand management. We are delighted to partner with them and look forward to growing and developing the Lee Cooper brand in India. 

 It was early this month that Arvind Brands, the wholly owned subsidiary of Ahmedabad-based Arvind Mills, entered into a joint venture with VF Corporation, US, to market various brands owned by VF Corporation in India. VF Corporation will hold a 60 per cent equity in the joint venture for which it will pay $33 million, while Arvind will own the rest. 

 The new company will be called VF Arvind Brands Pvt Ltd and its existing business, including intellectual assets and licences from VF for Lee, Wrangler, Nautica, Jansport and Kipling brands, currently held by Arvind Fashions (also a subsidiary of Arvind Mills) will be transferred to the joint venture. 

 With the Indian economy growing at a robust pace and consumers becoming increasingly brand and fashion conscious, it is expected that many other well-known brands are set to enter the country. Madura Garments, the A.V. Birla group company for instance is the licensee for the Esprit brand in India. Reliance Retail may also bring the Armani brand into the country. 

 The Future Group operates through six verticals that includes Future Retail, Future Capital, Future Brands, Future Space, Future Logistics and Future Media. The groups flagship company is Pantaloon Retail.

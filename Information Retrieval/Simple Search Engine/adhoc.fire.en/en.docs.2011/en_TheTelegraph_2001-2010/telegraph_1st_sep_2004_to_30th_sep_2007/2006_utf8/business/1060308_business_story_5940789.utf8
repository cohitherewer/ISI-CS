 Sprint sticks to forecast

 New York, March 7 (Reuters): Sprint Nextel on Tuesday affirmed its 2006 revenue and earnings outlook and said its revenue growth would outpace the industry over the next three years.

 Sprint also expected annual adjusted operating income before depreciation and amortisation, or OIBDA, to grow at a double-digit percentage rate in the next three years.

 Sprint said it still expected 2006 revenue of $41 billion, assuming a percentage growth rate in high single digits to low-double-digits for wireless and a mid-to-high single-digit decline for its long-distance telephone business. The company also backed its forecast for 2006 OIBDA of $13 billion.

 The 2006 outlook, first issued last month in its quarterly earnings report, included Sprints wireless and long-distance business, but excluded some acquisitions and a local phone unit.

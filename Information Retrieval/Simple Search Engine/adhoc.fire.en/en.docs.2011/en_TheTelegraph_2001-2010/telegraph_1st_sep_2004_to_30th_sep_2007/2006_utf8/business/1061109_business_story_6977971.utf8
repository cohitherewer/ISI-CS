 Bank trios agenda ready

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Nov. 8: The new banking triad - Bank of India (BoI), Union Bank of India and the Infrastructure Development Finance Company (IDFC) has set a target of sanctioning close to Rs 11,500 crore spread over 16 projects over the next five months and Rs 45,000 crore in the first year of their association.

 Both the public sector banks today formally announced the broad contours of their alliance with IDFC. Apart from focussing on joint lending and loan syndication largely for infrastructure projects, both BoI and Union Bank will come together to offer other facilities to their customers. These include cash management services and in international operations.

 In cash management services, speedier and much efficient cheque collection facilities will result in out-station cheques getting credited to the account of one banks customer in a period of six working days as against the current time of 14 days. 

 The cash management services leverage on the technology and branch networks of each other. While both the banks use the same IT platform (Finacle of Infosys), BoI has implemented core banking solution (CBS) in 1008 branches covering more than 300 cities in 17 states and Union Bank has implemented CBS in 850 branches covering 241 cities in 22 states.

 Union Bank chairman M.V. Nair said apart from a very strong presence in western India, the inter-connected branch network of both the banks in other parts of the country will supplement the geographical spread and pass on the benefits to the customers. Until now, these services were available to corporate customers. From now on, they will be made available to individual customers.

 The banks will also join hands in the arena of international operations. Union Bank does not have any international operations at present. BoIs network will be made available to Union Bank for all their overseas operations, including raising of resources.

 BoI chairman M. Balachandran said the principal purpose to form such an alliance was to provide total solution to corporate houses. The arrangement will facilitate joint identification, marketing, appraisal and underwriting of project finance.

 Trio offers to help out United Western Bank

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Distress call

 Mumbai, Sept. 6: The Maharashtra government, Sicom and a financial institution have together indicated their willingness to infuse Rs 350 crore into beleaguered United Western Bank (UWB).

 Sicom or the State Industrial Investment Corporation of Maharashtra holds little more than a 10 per cent stake in UWB. The third partner, the financial institution, is a non-government body. 

 The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had asked UWB to submit a detailed capital infusion plan by Thursday. 

 In a late evening development, the board of the bank today unanimously approved the revival proposal sent by Sicom. 

 The board, which met here this evening, has unanimously approved the proposal and we will submit the proposal to the RBI before the deadline of 10 am tomorrow, UWB board sources said here. 

 The proposal complies with all required stipulations and expectations of the RBI, the sources said.

 UWB did not want to be acquired by another bank and indications were available since early this week that Sicom would take the lead role in its reconstruction. 

 At a meeting of the UWB board on Monday, the directors decided to prepare and forward a scheme of reconstruction of the bank to the RBI with a commitment to bring in funds immediately to meet all liabilities and achieve a good capital adequacy ratio (CRAR) and net worth. 

 On Tuesday, the board of Sicom gave its approval for the formulation of a reconstruction package for UWB. Sicom added that the management of the bank would also be revamped and a long-term business plan formulated. 

 However, bankers said even if UWB places a bid before the central bank, the RBI would have the last word on the matter. It is, however, felt that the chances of Sicoms proposal finding favour with the central bank are slim. 

 Questions are being asked as to why the state government arm did not bring the capital much earlier. 

 Moreover, the RBI would prefer UWB to be handed over to an entity which has successful banking operations, sources added. 

 Close to seven banks, including ICICI Bank, Federal Bank, Andhra Bank, Allahabad Bank, Standard Chartered, IDBI and Canara Bank, jumped into the fray to acquire UWB after it was placed under moratorium by the RBI late last week. Corporation Bank and Bank of Maharashtra today joined the fray. 

 The RBI had asked all banks to submit their proposals, though rumours abound that ICICI Bank and Canara Bank are the front-runners. 

 UWB suffered a net loss of Rs 98.64 crore and Rs 106.48 crore during 2004-05 and 2005-06, respectively.

 Vodafone hikes dividend, charts growth route 

 Desperate measures

 London, May 30 (Reuters): Mobile phone giant Vodafone unveiled plans to return an extra ?3 billion ($5.6 billion) to investors and hiked its dividends on Tuesday, spicing a well-flagged new strategy to cut costs and embrace new technology.

 The Britain-based firm, under pressure from slowing growth in Europe and rivals with new technologies that link mobile and fixed-line devices, said it was paying out 60 per cent of earnings in dividends and would keep future payouts high.

 The extra cash for investors helped to overshadow Vodafone announcing the biggest loss in UK corporate history as a result of accounting writedowns, as well as details of a new strategy that will see it axe 400 head-office jobs and enter the fixed-line broadband Internet market.

 Were very happy with the approach they have taken with the dividend, said Richard Marwood, a fund manager at AXA Investments. You are getting a sixth of the companys market capitalisation being returned to you within the next year.

 Shares in the worlds biggest mobile phone operator by revenues rallied as much as 3.5 per cent in early trade.

 Vodafone said its adjusted basic earnings rose 13 per cent to 10.11p per share in the year ended March, topping the average forecast of 9.95p in a Reuters poll of 18 analysts.

 But including impairment charges of ?23.5 billion, the loss before tax was a colossal ?14.9 billion. Its net loss for the year was ?21.8 billion, or 35.01p-a-share.

 The firm boosted its annual dividend payout to 6.07p, up 49 per cent and smashing analysts top forecast of 5.5p.

 Its a 5 per cent yield stock now, said Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein analyst Robert Grindle, adding Vodafone was taking a sensible approach to cost control and introducing new services.

 Vodafone, which had already announced plans to return ?6 billion to shareholders following the sale of its Japanese unit, said it would raise this total to ?9 billion.

 Vodafone Chief Executive Arun Sarin has come under pressure from investors and within his own board to spell out a strategy to cope with slower growth in markets such as Germany and Italy where mobile phone ownership is rife and competition is intense. 

 New businesses 

 The firm said it continued to expect modest revenue growth in Europe, but unveiled a plan to cut costs including 400 job cuts at its corporate centre and outsourcing some IT activities.

 Vodafones pure-play mobile operation has come under fire at a time when fixed-line and mobile businesses are converging into a cheaper, single service that works across both networks.

 The firm said on Tuesday it had responded with its recently created New Businesses unit, and announced plans to launch a series of products including high-speed internet access in Germany in the third quarter of this financial year. Vodafone said it would sell businesses where it could not make a strong enough return, but added it remained a happy shareholder in US group Verizon Wireless.

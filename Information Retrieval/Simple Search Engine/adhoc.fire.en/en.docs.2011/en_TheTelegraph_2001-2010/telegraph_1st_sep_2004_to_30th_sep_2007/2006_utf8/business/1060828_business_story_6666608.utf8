 Q amp;A

 Age factor

 I shall complete 64 years on December 31. Will I be eligible for benefits senior citizens enjoy while computing total annual income for the assessment year 2007-08? My income is unlikely to exceed Rs 1,85,000 in the financial year 2006-07. Do I have to submit income tax return?

 Kshitish Chandra Debnath, Calcutta

 The income tax act of the country defines senior citizens as persons who have attained the age of 65 or more during the previous year. You will be eligible for the tax benefits for senior citizen in the assessment year 2007-08. You dont have to file income tax returns if your total annual income doesnt exceed Rs 1,85,000.

 One-by-six

 I am more than 65 years old and my income is less than the taxable limit. However, Im regularly filing income tax returns following the one-by-six criteria. This criteria is being withdrawn from the assessment year 2007-08. If I stop filing returns, how am I going to claim refund on tax that might be deducted at source against my investments?

 Nirmal Kumar Sircar, Calcutta

 If your total income is less than the taxable limit, submit Form 15H for non-deduction of tax at source whenever you make an investment. This way you can assure that there is no TDS. But in case tax is deducted at source on investments, you can always file an income return to claim that tax deduction. Filing of income tax return is voluntary and you can continue to file returns for tax purposes. 

 Reading the fineprint

 Is the tax-saving bank fixed deposit any special scheme? Will fixed deposits of five years or more in any scheduled bank qualify for income tax exemption under section 80C?

 H.N. Basu, Calcutta

 Tax-saving fixed deposits (FDs) are different from regular bank FDs of five years or more. One can invest up to a maximum of Rs 1 lakh per annum in a tax-saving fixed deposit, which cannot be withdrawn before five years. There will be no overdraft facility in tax-saving deposits nor can these be pledged for a loan. Even the application form for tax-saving fixed deposits is slightly different from the regular FDs.

 HCL Tech net at Rs 181 cr

 Shiv Nadar: Bullish

 New Delhi, Jan. 21 (PTI): Indias fifth largest software exporter HCL Technologies has posted a 40 per cent year-on-year increase in its net profit at Rs 181.1 crore for the second quarter ended December 2005 on the back of multi-million dollar deals.

 The companys revenues shot up 32 per cent year-on-year at Rs 1,054.2 crore during the quarter. HCLs earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation was up 29 per cent to Rs 237.7 crore.

 Maintaining its quarterly dividend trend, the company announced interim dividend of 200 per cent.

 HCL expects to sign two mega-deals in the next few days. We are in the process of signing two multi-million dollar deals spread over many years, chairman of HCL Technologies Shiv Nadar said.

 Nadar said he expected profit for the financial year 2005-06 to rise by 30 to 40 per cent, boosted by increased outsourcing. He expected each of the two deals would be worth hundreds of millions of dollars.

 Key financial metrics have started accelerating, which augurs well for the rest of the year, corporate vice-president S.L. Narayanan said. 

 We are witnessing increased demand for emerging services and emerging verticals, and are seeing the overall industry size to grow at a good pace. We also see technology spending among enterprises picking up, particularly as rapid globalisation pushes enterprises to increase efficiencies and productivity, thereby remaining globally competitive, Nadar said.

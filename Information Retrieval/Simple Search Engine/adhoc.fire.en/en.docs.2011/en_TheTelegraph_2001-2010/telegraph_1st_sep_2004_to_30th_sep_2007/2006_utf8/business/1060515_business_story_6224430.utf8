 Insurance to harvest rural gain

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 14: Rural and semi-urban life insurance industry is expected to grow to $20 billion by 2010, while the non-life business will rise to $15 billion.

 In its study on the insurance sector, Assocham said, Rural and semi-urban India will together contribute $35 billion to the Indian insurance industry by 2010.

 It also suggested that the Indian insurance business, now at $10 billion, would grow to $60 billion by 2010, a 500 per cent increase in size.

 Indias life insurance premium as a percentage of the GDP is 1.8 per cent against 5.2 per cent in the US, 6.5 per cent in the UK and 8 per cent in South Korea.

 The study has said in the coming years, the corporate segment will not be a big area of growth for insurance firms.

 Potato, onion to join futures trading club

 RICH CROP

 New Delhi, March 26: Futures trading is likely to be extended to more commodities, including onions and potatoes, in line with the proposed changes in the Forward Contracts Regulation Act.

 A committee headed by additional secretary (consumer affairs) Alka Sirohi is studying the scope of futures trading in essential commodities. It is expected to come out with its recommendations soon.

 Futures trading has increased manifold, especially after the three national multi-commodity exchanges were set up. The value of such trading has jumped from Rs 34,495 crore in 2001-02 to about Rs 8,00,000 crore now.

 Though the government has notified about 100 commodities for futures trading, around 81 are actively traded through 24 associations.

 The government has already introduced the Forward Contracts (Regulation) Amendment Bill, which proposes to set up a Forward Markets Appellate Tribunal on the lines of the Security Appellate Tribunal formed under the Sebi Act. 

 The amendments envisage creating the options market for commodities and other derivatives comprising weather, rainfall and temperature variations to provide farmers with additional scope for hedging. Currently, options trading in goods is prohibited.

 Futures contracts perform two important functions: price discovery and hedging of price risk in a commodity. In international bourses, traders can also use financial instruments such as call and put options, but these are not allowed in India. Futures contracts are helpful because one can get an idea of the price that is likely to prevail in the near future. Through a futures contract, one agrees to sell the underlying commodity at a future date, but at a price agreed upon at present and thus hedge the price risk in the future. 

 The amendments will strengthen the Forward Markets Commission and make it an autonomous regulator for commodities futures trading.

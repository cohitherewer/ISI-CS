 AirTel rings in big investment plan

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Reaching out

 Calcutta, Jan. 16: AirTel is set to invest Rs 1,200 crore as part of its aggressive expansion policy in the east.

 The company has invested Rs 500 crore till date under its year-long expansion plans in the east, said Rajan Swaroop, director-east regional hub, Bharti Tele-Ventures.

 AirTel recently reached the 2-million-customer mark in the eastern region with the highest number of customers at 49,000 added in December 2005.

 Swaroop attributed the rise in user base to the lifetime prepaid validity offer.

 AirTel has the highest customer base in the Bihar circle at 7 lakh followed by 6 lakh in Calcutta and 3 lakh each in Bengal and Orissa.

 According to Trai figures, Hutch added 47,159 customers, Reliance 31,448, Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd 39,076 and Tata Teleservices 32,849 in December.

 Airtel currently covers 1500 towns in the eastern region and will expand to another 1000 in the near future.

 Bharti is also waiting for a restructuring of the access deficit charge (ADC). 

 The changes in the ADC structure will also involve implementing the carrier access code (CAC), Swaroop said.

 The implementation of the code will help telecom users choose the long-distance carrier in national and international calls.

 Swaroop also did not rule out the options of making AirTels India One plan available at smaller commitment charges or rental than the existing ones.

 We have decided to wait for the enforcement of the restructured ADC to introduce the India One plan though competitors are already afoot with the same. We might give a new dimension to the market with our plan just as AirTels lifetime prepaid did when it was introduced eight weeks after the two-year free incoming plans, Swaroop added.

 The development of mobile telephony in the east is plagued with problems of interconnectivity, coupled with terrain difficulties and infrastructure sharing for companies like AirTel.

 The problems in the east, especially those related to the points of interconnectivity (PoI), were because of the limited availability of equipment and older exchanges of BSNL, Swaroop said.

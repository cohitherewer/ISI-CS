 Bata plans financial rejig

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Calcutta, June 28: Bata India will undertake financial restructuring to clean up its balance sheet.

 The company has decided to use the securities premium account (SPA) to set off accumulated losses, unamortised expenditure on VRS, certain specified debtors and inventories worth Rs 86.09 crore.

 On December 31, 2005, Bata had Rs 1,36.02 crore in the SPA.

 The company will move a special resolution in this regard in its 73rd annual general meeting tomorrow. It will also seek approval from Calcutta High Court to use the SPA to clean up its balance sheet.

 Bata chairman P.M. Sinha said the exercise would improve the financial health of the company and bring it back on the dividend payee list.

 We hope to complete the procedure within three months. Our credit ratings will go up, allowing us to borrow money at cheap rates, Sinha told The Telegraph.

 Bata, which turned around last year, has Rs 50.2 crore worth accumulated losses.

 Under the exercise, miscellaneous expenditure of Rs 29.14 crore on account of unamortised VRS would also be set off against the SPA.

 Stricter norms of provisioning of bad debts and inventory at Rs 6.7 crore would also be set off against the SPA.

 Bata has posted a net profit of Rs 12.49 crore in 2005 against Rs 62.7 crore loss in 2004. Moreover, it also paid back term loans worth Rs 30 crore to banks and financial institutions.

 The comprehensive restructuring is coming at a time when the government has allowed single-brand retail by foreign firms in the country. 

 International shoe companies like Nike, Adidas and Reebok have lined up expansion plans, challenging the age-old domination of Bata in the domestic footwear market.

 Pat for Shaibal Sinha

 The management has praised Shaibal Sinha, finance director of Bata India and former supply controller of Reckitt Benckiser India, for his contribution in turning around the loss-making shoe firm. 

 His compensation package is being raised significantly. He will now earn more than the managing director of Bata India.

 New Delhi, March 18: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today said the government would bring in a comprehensive new company law in the current session of Parliament.

 Our government is committed to formulating a comprehensive, new company law and work on the report of the Irani committee has been completed. We will bring a new bill to Parliament in the next few weeks, said Singh after launching the e-governance project MCA 21 that would enable e-filing of statutory papers by companies.

 The new company law will focus on promoting greater transparency and good governance in firms while at the same time giving them greater independence in operations, he said.

 Such a law will be a comprehensive revision of the 50-year-old company law and bring us in alignment with the current needs, Singh said.

 We will also expedite the adoption of accounting standards in alignment with the international accounting standards so that we have better disclosure norms on a par with global best practices, he added.

 The Prime Minister also asked the company affairs ministry to look into issues like limited liability partnerships, which are essential business structures in the emerging knowledge economy.

 The ministry also needs to get the competition commission fully functional because an active competition body is an essential element in the architecture of modern market economy, he said. The Prime Minister said the MCA21 programme should benefit the corporate sector by providing a hassle-free and efficient interface with the government. The project provides for cross-referencing of financial statements of companies filed with the registrar of companies and other regulatory institutions. This will be a one-stop filing window... (and) make business easier for businesses, and governance easier for the government, he said.

 He said banks and financial institutions should benefit from online availability of information relating to companies and could use it for improving their credit evaluation procedures and the overall quality of credit extended.

 Calcutta, Jan. 31: Hindustan Motor (HM) may soon see its newborn auto component enterprise overtaking the age-old car business.

 Hindustan Motor, which makes the Ambassador and passenger cars for Japanese conglomerate Mitsubishi, expects a rapid growth in the auto component business in the next couple of years, raking in profits for the company.

 Hindustan Motor has forayed into forging, casting, stamping and machine equipment at its Uttarpara plant in Bengal.

 These items are in different stages of development. We want to become a supplier of these components to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), Hindustan Motor managing director Ravi Santhanam said here today.

 The company has already started supplying to Tata Motors and Mahindra amp; Mahindra (M amp;M).

 It generally takes 18 months to get the business going. Once it is established, there could be a rapid growth in volume, he added.

 He added that revenue from the new venture could well overshadow the illustrious car business.

 Experts have predicted that the domestic auto component sector could be bigger than its automobile counterpart in future. This can happen to Hindustan Motor too, Santhanam said.

 The flagship company of the Chandra Kant Birla group is pinning its hope on this business to turn corners apart from rolling out new models and variants of cars.

 Last year, Hindustan Motor spun off its component business ? power unit plant of Indore and the power products division of Hosur ? into a separate subsidiary. It subsequently sold 51 per cent of that to private equity partner Actis and the existing promoter group.

 Santhanam did not want to speculate whether the Uttarpara venture would go the same way in future.

 The managing director was in the city to launch the Lancer Cedia models. The company hopes to step up production in its Chennai plant following the rollout of the new model.

 It hopes Pajero sales to double and Cedia sales to cross that of the Lancer. At the same time, the number of dealers would increase substantially.

 Going forward, Hindustan Motor would launch another model ? the Montero ? taking the total offering from Mitsubishi to four. On top of that, the company will also launch two variants of the Ambassador. It also hopes to reduce the debt burden and interest cost in future.

 Voltas lines up stock split

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, May 11: Voltas Limited will split its shares with a face value of Rs 10 into 10 shares of Re 1 each. Our share prices had become too expensive for interested investors. To get more liquidity in the system, we have decided to go in for a stock split, M.M. Miyajiwala, executive vice-president (finance), said. The companys board has also recommended a dividend of 60 per cent for financial year 2006.

 The company has recorded a 32 per cent year-on-year increase in net sales at Rs 1,904.18 crore. Operating profit stood at Rs 117.88 crore, up almost 124 per cent. 

 The company has recorded a 40 per cent year-on-year growth in profit after tax (PAT) at Rs 70.49 crore. Consolidated revenues during the year stood at Rs 2,022.71 crore, up almost 30 per cent. 

 Net sales for the quarter ended March 31 was Rs 530.45 crore compared with Rs 499.70 crore in the year-ago period, a rise of 6 per cent. 

 The fourth quarter profit after tax was Rs 23.73 crore compared with Rs 22.83 crore in the same quarter a year back, a rise of 3.9 per cent. 

 Our PAT was hit by the amount we had to give out under the voluntary retirement scheme (VRS) on account of the closure of our Hyderabad plant. The VRS cost us Rs 65 crore, Miyajiwala said. 

 The company is also planning three plants in Uttaranchal. 

 As a result of our growing profits, the tax advantages that we enjoyed are getting exhausted. Closing down the Hyderabad plant gives us the opportunity to move to cheaper places like Uttaranchal. The plants will not be located in urban areas and therefore, we will get the tax benefits and also save on duties, he added.

 The company has seen a 50 per cent growth in orders from the international market. 

 The domestic air conditioning segment has seen good growth. We are getting a lot of airport projects. Most of the cooling systems are done by us, he added.

 The company wants to expand to Bahrain and is also looking at a tie-up with a Chinese equipment maker. 

 Voltas is also bidding for large projects in Abu Dhabi and Dubai.

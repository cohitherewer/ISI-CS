 AstraZeneca bells the CAT

 Booster dose

 London, May 15 (Reuters): AstraZeneca is to buy Cambridge Antibody Technology (CAT) in a deal valuing it at ?702 million ($1.3 billion), extending a drive into biological medicines as it looks to restock its depleted drugs pipeline.

 AstraZeneca said on Monday it had agreed to pay 1,320-pence-a-share in cash for Britains biggest biotech company, 67 per cent above Cambridge Antibody Technologys closing price on Friday.

 Europes third-biggest drug maker, which already owns 19.2 per cent of CAT from a research deal in 2004, said buying the rest of the shares would cost it ?567 million, and would not affect its earnings guidance or share buyback program.

 CAT, which has yet to make a profit, is a world leader in making drugs from antibodies, the bodys natural immune defences. These generally have fewer side-effects than conventional, chemistry-based medicines.

 Major pharmaceutical firms are battling to strengthen their position in the fast-growing market for biological drugs such as antibodies, with analysts forecasting sales of antibody-based drugs will more than double by 2010 from $14 billion in 2005.

 This is part of transforming our long-term capabilities, AstraZenecas executive director of development John Patterson told Reuters. From this, up to one in four of our later-stage molecules by 2010 will be from a biologicals background, whereas previously weve had little or no capability.

 Analysts welcomed AstraZenecas drive into biological medicines and said the hefty premium paid to buy CAT was in line with US group Amgen Incs recent purchase of US antibody specialist Abgenix. But some said the deal would do little to address the Anglo-Swedish groups short-term dearth of new drugs.

 AstraZeneca is buying up all these companies, but Im not sure theyre going to produce much over the next three years, he said, retaining a sell rating on AstraZeneca shares. 

 What also concerns me is, if these companies are that good, why arent others trying to buy them? Theres no auction.

 Shares in CAT, which provided technology used in Abbott Laboratories blockbuster arthritis drug Humira, rocketed over 60 per cent to as high as 1,295p, near AstraZenecas bid price. 

 AstraZeneca shares were down 1.4 per cent at 2,815p, within a benchmark FTSE-100 index down 2.3 percent.

 AstraZeneca has already signed deals worth over $2 billion as it seeks to rebuild a drugs pipeline holed by the failure of a series of medicines in late-stage clinical trials.

 New Delhi, June 28: Qualcomm chief executive officer Paul Jacobs today said Reliance Infocomm ?should not move back to 2G technology? by offering GSM services.

 Jacobs, who will meet Anil Ambani tomorrow, said CDMA is a third-generation (3G) technology. 

 ?CDMA provides data capability in proven economic conditions, even at the bottom of the pyramid. Therefore, it seems strange to move from a 3G technology back to a 2G one,? said Jacobs.

 Reliance Infocomm, which is the largest CDMA player in India with 2 crore subscribers, applied for spectrum from the government to start GSM-based mobile services in some more circles.

 On spectrum, Jacobs was unhappy over the government?s policy of allocating this scarce resource on the basis of voice-based subscribers.

 ?He (Dayanidhi Maran) has a specific goal where he is going to get a certain number of voice subscribers in India. I would like to see more capabilities for data services because I believe that these services also improve the economic situation,? he said.

 To bring down the cost of handsets, the US-based CDMA chipmaker wants more manufacturers in the market to increase competition. 

 Jacobs said, ?We are willing to be flexible about the way we are going to achieve the goal of enabling lowest handset prices.?

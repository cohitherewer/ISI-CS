 Q amp;A

 A sons gift

 I am a retired person. My son, who is studying in the US, sends me money from time to time. Is this amount taxable? I have paid a lumpsum amount to B.D. Bangur Endowment from where my son was awarded a loan scholarship at the time of his departure to the US. Is this amount deductible from my income if the money sent by my son is taxable? 

 T.K. Sarkar, by e-mail 

 The amount sent by your son will be treated as gift and since he is your lineal descendant, it will not be taxed. However, the amount you paid to the endowment shall not be eligible for exemption. Repayment of education loans are eligible for tax exemption only for the student. Parents repaying such loans are not eligible for deduction.

 Tax token

 Will short-term capital gains on sale of shares or mutual fund units (on which tax at the rate of 10 per cent is to be paid) be added to my salary income and thereby taxed again? In which column of the returns should I include the short-term capital gains? 

 Animesh Chakravorty, Calcutta 

 No, the short-term capital gains would not be added to your salary income. It is added to the taxable income under the head income from capital gains. 

 Closing account 

 We had opened a savings account with three applicants to be operated by any two. Can any of us close the account? 

 Sanjib Banerjee, Calcutta 

 If the operating instruction for the account was on an either or survivor basis, then the request of the second applicant would be honoured by the bank. However, if the instruction was joint operations, you will have to provide suitable application alongwith necessary documents such as the death certificate to close the account. 

 House rent allowance

 I receive gross salary of Rs 12,000 per month, which does not include any house rent allowance. However, I pay house rent of Rs 2000 per month. Will I get any tax exemption? 

 Amitava Chowdhury, Ranchi 

 ce rent paid is allowed as exemption only against house rent allowance, you will not be eligible to claim the same.

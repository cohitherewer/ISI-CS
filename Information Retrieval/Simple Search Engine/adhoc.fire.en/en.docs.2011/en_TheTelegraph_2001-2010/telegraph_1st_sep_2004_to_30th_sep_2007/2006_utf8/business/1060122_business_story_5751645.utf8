 Ford set to unveil turnaround plan 

 Waiting for the signal

 Detroit, Jan. 21 (Reuters): Ford Motor Co., set to unveil its turnaround plan on Monday, is likely to announce a new direction for its sluggish minivan line-up, a source familiar with the automakers product plan said.

 The number two U.S. automaker will move away from the traditional minivan look, characterised by sliding doors and a truck platform, and pursue a design similar to the Fairlane concept wagon that it showed at the Detroit auto show in January 2005, the source said.

 The vehicle had three rows of seats, was based on a car platform, and looked like a larger station wagon. The automaker called the Fairlane a people mover.

 Ford, facing a deepening financial crisis, will announce a comprehensive restructuring plan on Monday that will include plant closings and layoffs, as well as present its fourth-quarter earnings.

 Ford spokesman Jon Harmon declined to comment on changes to the minivan line-up, but said the restructuring plan was more than just a cost-cutting strategy.

 Fords minivans compete in a crowded segment led by DaimlerChrysler AGs Chrysler Group. Sales of the Ford Freestar and Mercury Monterey were down 23 per cent and 53 per cent respectively in 2005. Two new vehicles ? the Ford Edge and the Lincoln MKX crossover ? will be built in the Ontario plant, which makes the Freestar and Monterey minivans.

 Plant closures 

 Ford is under pressure to present a turnaround plan for its North American operations. 

 Deutsche Bank analyst Rod Lache expects investors on Monday to focus on the plan rather than the results.

 Investors will want to determine whether the plan is aggressive, and whether Ford has made realistic assumptions for auto demand, market share, mix, and pricing, he said in a note to clients.

 The details of the plan ? dubbed Way Forward ? have been subject of speculation, but various reports suggest Ford is likely to cut about 25,000 jobs in North America and close 10 factories, including about five assembly plants.

 Mark Fields, president of Fords operations in the Americas who has been charged with drafting the strategy, said earlier this month that the automaker was eyeing all aspects of its business on both cost and revenue sides.

 We are scrutinising every cost, looking at our competitiveness on a material cost basis, looking at our competitiveness on a fixed cost basis and aligning that with the demand, Fields said.

 He added that reining in excess capacity was very important for the company.

 Ford used 79 per cent of its total North American production capacity in 2005, the lowest utilisation figure by any automaker, according to Harbour Consulting, a manufacturing and management consulting firm that specialises in the auto industry.

 Catherine Madden, an auto analyst at the consulting firm Global Insight Inc., said earlier this week the plants most at risk for closure because of the vehicle they make were those in St. Louis, Missouri, St. Paul, Minnesota, Atlanta, Wixom, Michigan, St. Thomas, Ontario, and Cuatitlan, Mexico.

 New EMC offices to widen reach

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, May 22: In a move to expand its market reach in India, information and storage management vendor EMC Corporation announced the opening of two new offices in Calcutta and Chennai. 

 We now have five offices and have also increased the number of our spares and logistics centres to five by adding two additional facilities, said Manoj Chugh, president of EMC, India.

 According to an Access Markets International (AMI) Partners study there are an estimated 7.6 million small and medium businesses in the country. 

 These small and medium businesses are set to spend a staggering $7.7 billion this financial year to beef up their infotech infrastructure and solutions, up 26 per cent over the last year. 

 US-based EMC estimates their information solution needs are growing at more than 150 per cent annually. EMC has posted a turnover of $9.66 billion for the last financial year.

 The company also unveiled 12 new hardware and software products with an aim to target the mid-tier market here.

 India is the fastest growing mid-tier information management and storage market in the Asia-Pacific region. Launching the products reflects that EMC is leveraging its global leadership in mid-range storage solutions to make storage less complex, more affordable and easy to use for growing companies in India, said Joel Schwartz, senior vice-president of Midrange Systems Division, EMC.

 The company intends to reach out to the mid-tier market in India through its distributor Redington, which has more than 50 partners in 30 cities across the country.

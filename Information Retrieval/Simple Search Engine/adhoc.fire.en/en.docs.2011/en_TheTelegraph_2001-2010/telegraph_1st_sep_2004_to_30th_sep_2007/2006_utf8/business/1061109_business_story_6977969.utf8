 Ambanis in court for fresh duel

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Anil: Fight mode

 Mumbai, Nov. 8: The sparring gloves have been donned again: after a four-month lull, the Ambani brothers are squaring off for another scrappy fight.

 Reliance Natural Resources (RNRL), the Anil D. Ambani group company, today moved Bombay High Court against Reliance Industries (RIL) for failing to execute the gas supply and purchase deal between the two companies.

 RNRL prayed for implementation of the demerger agreement, under which the Rs 100,000-crore Dhirubhai Ambani empire was carved up and distributed between the two brothers.

 The gas supply agreement, which is an integral part of the demerger and envisages supply of 20 million metric standard cubic metres per day (mmscmd) of gas by RIL to RNRL, is crucial for Anil Ambanis 7480-mw Dadri power project in Uttar Pradesh.

 The gas will originate from the Krishna Godavari basin, where RIL had made a significant discovery.

 An RNRL official confirmed that an application has been filed, requesting the court to direct RIL to implement its December 2005 order. 

 In September 2005, RIL had sought the high courts approval for the demerger scheme, which provided for gas supply. The court gave its go-ahead in December that year.

 However, RIL officials declined to comment, saying they were studying the court notice. Corporate observers state that the RNRL move comes only days after RIL revealed that it would double production to 80 mmscmd at the KG block for which a capital expenditure of $5.2 billion will be incurred. The company had also filed an amendment to the initial development plan for the Deepwater Block KG-DWN-98/3 (KG-D6), with the Director-General of Hydrocarbon (DGH) for approval.

 In July this year, the agreement between RIL and RNRL courted controversy when the government rejected the $2.34-per-mmbtu price at which RIL was supposed to sell the gas to RNRL. The Centre had cited lack of price discovery and non-adherence to the arms length sales criterion required under the production-sharing contract, as the reasons for this ruling.

 The government also pointed out that gas from Panna Mukta fields, where RIL is a stakeholder, was offered to Gas Authority of India Ltd (GAIL) at $4.8 per mmbtu. The ministry feared that gas sale at $2.3 per MMBTU would lead to revenue loss of over Rs 20,000 crore over a period of 15 years. This is because the government earns royalty on gas produced from domestic fields.

 Huge Sahara claim on Jet

 Bumpy ride ahead

 New Delhi, Nov. 24: Air Sahara has filed a claim of Rs 3,020 crore against Jet Airways with an arbitration tribunal in London, for Jets failure to honour their share purchase agreement (SPA) of January 2006.

 The company in its plea before the tribunal, headed by Judge Lord Stein, on November 20, said that the claim was also to recover the inter-line business revenue that Jet earned for close to three months.

 Sahara sought direction from the tribunal to make Jet execute the SPA and close the transaction.

 Alternatively, Sahara has claimed that if Jet Airways is unwilling to buy Air Sahara, then Jet is liable to pay over Rs 1,931 crore as damage, compensation and inter-line revenue etc.

 Justice S.P. Bharucha and Justice B.P. Jeevan Reddy, both retired judges of the Supreme Court, are on the panel as nominees of Jet and Sahara respectively.

 Jet, on its part, filed its claim a day after the deadline set by the tribunal, seeking refund of the Rs 500 crore it paid as advance to Air Sahara along with interest.

 Officials of the Mumbai-based Jet Airways and Lucknow-headquartered Air Sahara refused to comment on the issue. 

 The arbitration tribunal had directed both the parties, on October 11 this year, to file claims by November 20. 

 In its prayer, Sahara group contended that the SPA was still valid a position it had taken before a Lucknow court after Jet let the June 21 deadline to complete the deal pass.

 Bombay High Court is reported to have accepted Jets plea to replace ICICI Bank as the Rs 1,500-crore escrow account agent. With the consent of Air Sahara, the court allowed Jet to replace ICICI Bank with State Bank of India for the guarantee given to Sahara group.

 Jet announced in January it would buy Sahara for $500 million. In March, Jet extended the deadline for the transaction by three months as it did not have the regulatory clearances.

 The agreement entitled Sahara to claim Rs 1,500 crore from the escrow account only after the takeover is completed on June 21; Jet, in turn, was eligible for full repayment within seven days of termination of the pact without any dispute.

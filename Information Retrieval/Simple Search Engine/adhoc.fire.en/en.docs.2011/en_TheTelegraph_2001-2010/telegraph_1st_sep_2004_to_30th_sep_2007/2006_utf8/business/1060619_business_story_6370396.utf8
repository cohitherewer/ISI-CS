 Credit squeeze hints at slowdown

 Most numbers point to a very strong economy ? GDP growth during the January to March quarter was 9.3 per cent, industrial growth in April was as high as 9.5 per cent. But there is one set of figures that seems to suggest that the economy is slowing down. Consider the data for bank credit. In 2005, bank credit growth during the period April 1 to May 26 was Rs 40,644 crore. This year, over the same period, credit has contracted by Rs 13,962 crore. True, a part of last year?s huge increase was because of higher food credit. But even the growth in non-food credit, which is an indicator of economic growth, has been negative so far this fiscal, and it has lagged behind last year?s growth by a massive Rs 48,372 crore.

 It?s too early, however, to conclude that growth is slowing. Rather, what seems to have happened is that the traditional year-end window-dressing by banks has been better than usual this year. (At end-March every year, banks window-dress their balance sheets by increasing their deposits and advances.) If, instead of taking credit growth between April 1 and May 26 we were to take the growth between March 17 and May 26 (which would eliminate the window-dressing effect), non-food credit growth this year would be Rs 53,286 crore, well above the growth of Rs 36,038 crore over the same period of 2005. In other words, there was a huge spurt in advances during the last fortnight of March 2006 as a result of which growth since then has been negative. Adjusted for that factor, there has been no slowdown in credit growth. Nevertheless, the bank credit figures would bear watching, to check whether the March effect is erased as the year progresses.

 ABN Amro indices

 Another reason for believing that the credit growth numbers are a statistical aberration is the ABN Amro India Purchasing Managers Index, which, at 57.7 in May, ?points to the sharpest improvement of operating conditions in the Indian manufacturing sector for even months?.

 Whats more, the New Orders Index, which can be taken to be a signal of growth in the future, also showed the most marked improvement since last October. Interestingly, there are clear indications that the spurt in growth is also leading to a resurgence in inflation. At 60.0 in May, up from 57.2 in April, the seasonally adjusted Input Prices Index climbed to a thirteen-month high. Anecdotal evidence suggested that Mays sharp increase in input cost inflation was primarily driven by higher raw material costs (particularly copper, aluminium and steel prices). This rise in input costs has also led to a hike in output prices, with factory gate prices rising by the sharpest since April 2005.

 Market pull-back

 The pull-back in the markets has been on account of two factors ? a more moderate stance on inflation by US Fed chief Ben Bernanke and the decision of the Bank of Japan (BoJ) to keep its key interest rate near zero per cent. Also, the BoJ governor said the bank will monitor the effect of falling stocks on the Japanese economy. The bulls have always said US and Japanese central banks will be unable to stomach the impact that higher interest rates will have on their markets and consequently on their housing markets, on consumption and their economies and they will soon stop raising rates when they begin to hurt the markets. The problem is that they also have to keep their credibility as inflation fighters. Perhaps the way forward would be to continue to tighten now so that there is scope for cutting interest rates next year, as growth and inflation come down.

 Focus on farm credit offtake

 Chidambaram: Rate rattle

 New Delhi, March 22: Union finance minister P. Chidambaram will meet the chairmen of public sector banks tomorrow to discuss the budget proposal for providing short-term credit to farmers at 7 per cent with an upper limit of Rs 3,00,000. A discussion on home loan rates is also on the cards.

 The meeting will discuss the issue of granting a certain level of subvention to Nabard for enabling banks to lend at 7 per cent to farmers.

 Due to liquidity crunch and high credit offtake, banks are considering an upward revision in home loan rates as they are finding it difficult to manage the spread between low deposit volumes and low interest income.

 HDFC, the countrys biggest housing loan provider, has already said it would raise home loan rates, both fixed and floating, by around 0.5 percentage points. 

 This is the banks second revision in less than two months, triggering a speculation about hardening of housing finance rates across the industry.

 In February, most banks, including ICICI, SBI and HDFC, had raised housing finance rates by about 0.25 percentage points.

 The current home loan floating rates are between 7.75 per cent and 8.25 per cent.

 To help banks mobilise more deposits, the budget had announced tax exemption on interest on fixed deposits under section 80C for term deposits of five years or above.

 The growth rates of deposits have not kept pace with the rate of credit offtake leading to tightening of liquidity and pressure on lending rates. 

 The rally in equity markets in recent months appears to have affected the deposit growth rates as investors prefer to park their investible surplus in bourses to book short-term gains.

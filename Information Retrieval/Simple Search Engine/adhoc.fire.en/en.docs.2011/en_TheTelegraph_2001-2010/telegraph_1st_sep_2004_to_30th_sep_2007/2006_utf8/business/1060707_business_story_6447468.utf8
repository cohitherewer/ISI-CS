 Tata Coffee set to revise rights issue

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 6: Tata Coffee Limited has decided to revise its proposed rights issue following the acquisition of Eight O?Clock Coffee of the US last month.

 Sources said the company could consider raising more money through this issue. Company officials, however, declined to comment on the details of the revision before the forthcoming board meeting.

 On March 13, the Tata Coffee board had approved a rights issue of 2 shares of a face value of Rs 10 each for every five held within a price band of Rs 220 to Rs 260 apiece.

 ?The company could offer more shares to raise resources to part-finance the new acquisition, which was not on the agenda when the board met in March,? said sources.

 On June 1, the share price of Tata Coffee on BSE was Rs 296.25 and on June 29, it was Rs 347.55.

 The last trading price on BSE was Rs 376.55, a 15.84 per cent increase over the previous close of Rs 325.05.

 The company acquired Eight O?Clock Coffee from Gryphon Investors for a consideration of Rs 1,015 crore, which would be financed through a combination of equity and non-recourse debt.

 Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) are the biggest export markets for Tata Coffee and the company would use the Eight O?Clock name to strengthen its brand in these markets. Tata Coffee exports around 5,000 tonnes of instant coffee.

 ?We are always on the lookout for good brands across the globe. But brand acquisition does not imply moving away from the plantation business. We have acquired five tea gardens and one coffee estate from Tata Tea, taking the total number to 24,? said M.H. Ashraff, managing director of Tata Coffee. 

 Tata Coffee expects Rs 80 to Rs 90 crore revenue from the joint venture company formed with Beeyu Overseas to market instant coffee globally.

 Tata Coffee has recorded a net turnover of Rs 190 crore and a net profit of Rs 22.6 crore for the year ended March 31, 2006.

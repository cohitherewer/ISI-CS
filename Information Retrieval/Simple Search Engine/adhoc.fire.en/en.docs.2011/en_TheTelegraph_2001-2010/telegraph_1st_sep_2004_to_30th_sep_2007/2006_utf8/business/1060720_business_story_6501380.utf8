 New Delhi, July 19: Maruti Udyog plans to raise the prices of all its cars by the month-end. 

 Officials hinted at the rate hike today at the launch of the WagonR Duo ? a car that runs both on petrol and LPG.

 On price hike, managing director Jagdish Khattar said, ?We are working on the price revision and new rates would be announced by the end of this month.?

 The company said higher cost of input and freight charges were making the price increase inevitable. The margins of automobile firms have come under severe pressure. 

 Maruti had increased the prices of Euro-III compliant versions of the Zen, WagonR and Baleno in January. 

 Earlier this month, Hyundai increased prices across various models, including the Santro. Bike majors like Hero Honda and Bajaj also feel the rise in input cost is affecting their margins.

 On the new WagonR, Khattar said, ?This is the introductory offer. We will review prices later.? It took Maruti nearly 18 months to upgrade the old WagonR. 

 However, another senior official of Maruti said like the Swift introductory offer that lasted for two months, the WagonR?s introductory rates should be here for sometime. 

 The prices of the three petrol variants of the WagonR range between Rs 3.23 lakh and Rs 3.72 lakh. The two models of the LPG variant are available for a price tag of Rs 3.4 lakh and Rs 3.6 lakh.

 The company said the new-look WagonR consumes 10 per cent less fuel than the earlier version. As for the WagonR Duo, ?The running cost is about 33 per cent less than of a petrol vehicle in the same category,? Maruti said. The WagonR now comes with larger headlamps, designed bumpers, refreshed speedometer, new seat upholstery and remote opening mechanism for back door.

 Meanwhile, Ford India launched the Fiesta diesel EXi priced at Rs 6.85 lakh (ex showroom New Delhi).

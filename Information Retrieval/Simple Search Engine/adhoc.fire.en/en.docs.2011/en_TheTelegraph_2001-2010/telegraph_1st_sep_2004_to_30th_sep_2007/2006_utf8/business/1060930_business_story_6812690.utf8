 Sebi order on demat charges upheld

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Sept. 29: The Securities and Appellate Tribunal (SAT) today upheld an order by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), which asked depositories and their participants not to levy charges on investors seeking to close demat accounts while switching over to another service provider.

 The SAT order came on an appeal filed by the National Securities Depository Ltd (NSDL), challenging the market regulators directive on such charges.

 The argument that the depositories and their participants render service and should be allowed to levy charge, as argued by NSDL, cannot be accepted because the investor is unhappy, said a three-member bench presided by Justice N.K. Sodhi.

 The depositories and their participants levy charges on the opening of a new demat account. They also impose custody charges and transfer charges towards the credit of service.

 We have ... no hesitation in holding that the impugned (Sebi) circular is for the benefit of investors and in their interest, the SAT order said.

 It added that no fault can be found with the decision of the board directing the depositories and their participants not to levy the transaction charges while switching over to another participant or depository.

 Sebi had found depositories and their participants levying transaction charges on demat account holders when they wanted to transfer their securities while switching over to any other participant and even depositories. 

 NSDL has argued that the board has, without any justification, interfered with its functioning. SAT, however, said, We do not find any merit in the arguments advanced on behalf of the appellant.

 The object underlying the impugned circular is rather laudable and protects the interests of the investors. It will lead to competition among the depositories and their participants, which will compete with each other to render better service to their clients (investors) so that they continue to retain their accounts with them. The situation prevailing prior to the issuance of the impugned circular was working to the detriment of the investors, SAT said.

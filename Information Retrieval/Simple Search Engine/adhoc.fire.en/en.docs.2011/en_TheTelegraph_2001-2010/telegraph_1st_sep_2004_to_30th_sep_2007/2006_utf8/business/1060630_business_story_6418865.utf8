 New Delhi, June 29: General Motors is all set to roll out a mini car in India by the first half of 2007.

 However, the company said it was yet to take a final decision on its second plant.

 ?The mini car will be manufactured at our Halol facility and it would enjoy the benefit of an excise duty cut on small cars announced in this year?s budget,? GM India president and managing director Rajeev Chaba told reporters at the launch of its first sportsback.

 GM today launched the Chevrolet SRV, priced Rs 6.97 lakh onwards (ex-showroom Delhi). 

 He said the increased capacity of the Halol plant would be used for the initial rollout of the small car, which is widely speculated to be the Chevrolet Spark.

 ?By the end of this year, we will touch an overall production capacity of 85,000 units per annum. Our sales target for the year is 45,000-50,000 units and we will utilise the additional capacity for the small car,? Chaba said.

 The company intends to meet the additional capacity requirement once the mini car is launched. Chaba said, ?We are still deciding on alternative capacity. But, at the moment, we don?t have a definitive answer.?

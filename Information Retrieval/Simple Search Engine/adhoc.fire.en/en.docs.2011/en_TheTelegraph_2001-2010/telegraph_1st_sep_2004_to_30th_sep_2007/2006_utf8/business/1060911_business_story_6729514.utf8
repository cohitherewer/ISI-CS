 Q amp;A

 Joint property

 My late father purchased a plot of land in 1954. We are three brothers and three sisters. My two elder brothers died without an heir or a will and two of my elder sisters are survived by their children. Can my sister, who is alive, and the children of my late sisters claim the portion of property that belonged to my late brothers?

 Sundar Sen, Ichapur

 Yours is a Hindu undivided family, we presume. As your father died without making any will of his property, the children of your late sisters and the one who is alive can make a claim on the joint property of the family. 

 Its a gift

 I want to gift some money every year to my wife, who doesnt have any other income. If she invests that money in post office monthly income scheme in her name, will her interest income be clubbed with my gross total income? What will be the tax implication if I gift it to my unmarried daughter?

 Basudeb Das

 Gifting the money to your daughter or wife will not attract any tax.

 Short-term gains

 Income tax at the rate of 10 per cent is payable on the gains from selling shares within 12 months of their purchase. How is the tax calculated if the short-term gains are added to the total income of a person whose income in taxable?

 Jahar Lal Boliar, Baruipur

 If your total annual income, after availing of the deduction of Rs 1 lakh on tax-saving investment under section 80C, is taxable, you will have to calculate the short-term capital gains tax at the rate of 10 per cent separately and the tax payable should be added to your total tax liability.

 Education cost

 What is the maximum deduction one can avail of for educational expenses for children? Is there any restriction in respect of the number of children or their age? 

 Biman Saha, Calcutta

 You can claim deduction up to Rs 1 lakh on educational expenses for children in one year. However, there are a few restrictions. First, the deduction is available only on tuition fees and you can claim the deduction for two children at the maximum.

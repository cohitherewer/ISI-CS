 Ministries brace for fresh oil bond bout

 S.P.S. PANNU

 Heavy burden

 New Delhi, Sept. 12: The stage is set for a fresh showdown between the petroleum ministry and its finance counterpart with public sector oil companies making a renewed case for a statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) status for the government bonds issued to them.

 Finance minister P. Chidambaram today ruled out granting SLR status to these bonds as it will make them less attractive to banks, which are the main buyers of these instruments.

 If the bonds have SLR status, banks can offset the investment in them against the mandatory cash reserve that they have to hold as a proportion of their loans. This gives them greater leverage for extending loans.

 The oil companies feel that without the SLR status they have to offer heavy discounts to sell these bonds as banks are reluctant to buy them.

 The finance ministry is against the idea as giving SLR status to the bonds will increase the money supply in the economy. Since fears of inflation are stalking the economy, the finance ministry has used this as a strong ground to justify its decision.

 The oil companies have been losing heavily on the sale of petroleum products as they have not been allowed to increase prices even as the cost of crude oil has skyrocketed.

 Chidambaram said Rs 14,150 crore worth of oil bonds meant for oil marketing companies would be issued within this month. 

 The oil bonds will be issued within this month and they will not get SLR status, Chidambaram said. 

 The government has decided to issue interest-bearing bonds worth Rs 28,000 crore to Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum.

 While the petroleum ministry expects the government to issue Rs 7,000 crore worth of bonds to the oil companies in each quarter to meet their liquidity requirements, the finance ministry has been blamed for unnecessarily delaying the issue of the bonds and increasing the hardship of the firms. A little over half of these bonds will go to Indian Oil while Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum share the remaining in more or less similar proportions.

 The oil companies are keen to liquidate the bonds as they have incurred heavy debts to run their operations because of the acute shortage of liquidity resulting from huge under-recoveries.

 The oil bonds are interest-bearing IOU slips issued by the government, which the oil companies can include in their balance sheet. They can also sell these bonds at a discount if they fall short of liquidity to meet their requirements.

 The finance ministry issues the bonds in tranches to minimise the burden on the exchequer. However, with the control of the revenue deficit uppermost on the mind of the finance ministry, it tends to delay the issue of the bonds.

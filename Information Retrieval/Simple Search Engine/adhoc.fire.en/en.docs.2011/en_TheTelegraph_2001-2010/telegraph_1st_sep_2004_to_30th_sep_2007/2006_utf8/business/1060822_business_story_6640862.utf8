 Diageo, Radico raise toast to joint venture

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Aug. 21: Diageo has entered into a joint venture with Radico Khaitan to mark its re-entry into the Indian-made-foreign-liquor segment. 

 Diageo India, the domestic arm of global liquor giant Diageo Plc, had exited this segment in late 2002. Led by premium brands like Johnie Walker and Smirnoff, the company has been consolidating its global brands in the country. 

 According to reports, the company has been eyeing tie-ups with leading local companies for bottling and distribution. 

 The 50:50 joint venture with Radico will explore the large and developing Indian-made-foreign-liquor segment, subject to regulatory approvals. 

 The segment has grown at 9 per cent over the last 10 years and at 10-12 per cent over the last two financial years. Also, the number of Indians who drink increased from one in 300 two decades back to one in 20 today. 

 The proposed venture will bring together the strengths of the two companies in brand marketing and distribution to create innovative international-quality products for the Indian consumer. Both the companies will continue to operate their own independent businesses outside the venture and will maintain their respective brand portfolios. 

 The details of the venture will be disclosed once the necessary approvals are in place, a Radico Khaitan spokesperson said. However, it ruled out the possibility of the company manufacturing the international products of Diageo, even at a later stage. 

 With this alliance, we hope to bring innovative products to the Indian consumers in this segment, said Asif Adil, managing director of Diageo India. 

 Diageo enjoys about 90 per cent of the countrys 2-million-cases premium vodka market and about 80 per cent of the scotch whisky market in India. 

 Radico Khaitan has also been on the lookout for possible acquisitions and joint venture partners in both the domestic and international markets and had appointed Rabo India Securities to identify possible targets. 

 The company had approved the proposal to raise funds of up to $100 million through overseas instruments for funding their expansion plans. 

 It had also set up a subsidiary, Radico Global, in Dubai, to serve as a vehicle for international expansion and possible foreign acquisitions. 

 Radico Khaitan had sold 12 million cases during 2005-06, a growth of 20 per cent against 10.02 million cases last fiscal. 

 The company achieved a 17 per cent increased in sales turnover for the fiscal 2005-06 to Rs 1,135.39 crore against Rs 973.59 crore last fiscal. The profit after tax for the company stood at Rs 45.16 crore, up 26 per cent from Rs 35.85 crore for the previous year.

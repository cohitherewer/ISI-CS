 AOL puts local lingo in mobiles

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 7: Tegic, a unit of AOLs wireless division, will launch a new version of text output software to render the nuances of local languages on mobile phone screens by the end of 2006. It will also launch ET9, a text messaging software for high-end and PDA phones in the third quarter of the current fiscal.

 The company is working on vernacular versions of T9 software for SMSs to build up an Indian-language database.

 We have recently launched the Bengali version of T9 and expect to launch Gujarati this month and Kannada between July and September. The Hindi, Punjabi, Marathi, Tamil and Urdu versions already exist, said Mridul Srivastava, senior country manager of AOL Mobile.

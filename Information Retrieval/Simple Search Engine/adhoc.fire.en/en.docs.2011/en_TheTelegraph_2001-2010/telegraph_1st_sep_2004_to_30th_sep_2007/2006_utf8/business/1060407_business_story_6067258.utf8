 LG.Philips sees lower profit

 Seoul, April 6 (Reuters): Flat-screen maker LG.Philips LCD Co Ltd is expected to post a lacklustre first-quarter profit next week as prices for flat panels slide despite booming sales of TVs, but analysts see some improvement in the second half.

 LG.Philips, the worlds biggest maker of large-sized liquid crystal display (LCD) panels, could see an even steeper drop in panel prices in the second quarter before recovering later in the year, analysts said.

 The panel glut is bound to persist throughout the year as manufacturers such as LG.Philips, Samsung Electronics and AU Optronics Corp are aggressively boosting capacity, betting on a surge in the worlds appetite for large, sleek LCD televisions.

 But analysts expect a recovery in the second half as more affordable prices are likely to boost flat-screen TV sales. A ramp-up in a new TV panel line also could help drive LG.Philips sales growth, although depreciation costs could linger.

 Analysts estimate LG.Philips saw a decline of about 8 per cent in average panel prices in the first quarter, with seasonally weaker demand hurting monitor and notebook panel prices the most.

 LG.Philips managed to make money thanks to TV panels, said Jae H. Lee, an analyst at Daiwa Securities.

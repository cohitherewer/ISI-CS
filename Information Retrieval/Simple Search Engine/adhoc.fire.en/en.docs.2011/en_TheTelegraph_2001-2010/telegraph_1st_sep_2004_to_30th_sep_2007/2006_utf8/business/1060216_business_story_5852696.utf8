 Dr Reddy?s buys Betapharm 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Feb. 15: Dr Reddy?s Laboratories (DRL) has beaten Ranbaxy Laboratories to acquire Betapharm. DRL is understood to have paid little less than 500 million euros to buy Germany?s fourth largest generic company.

 Till late tonight DRL and Ranbaxy were locked in a pitched battle to scoop up an 80 per cent stake in Betapharm, which has sales of 186 million euros. Both the firms had outbid France?s Sanofi-Aventis and Isreal?s Teva. Betapharm, founded in 1993 at Augsburg in Bavaria, is promoted by 3i, an UK-based venture capitalist.

 In a notice sent to stock exchanges today, Ranbaxy confirmed the bid for Betapharm without naming the company and said there have been speculating reports recently about potential acquisitions that could be made by it.

 ?In line with the company?s European growth strategy, it submitted a bid in a competitive tender for a German generic pharmaceuticals company. The target company, if acquired, would constitute a significant proportion of the group?s net assets, revenues and earnings,? Ranbaxy said.

 However, it is one among a number of bidders, Ranbaxy added. ?It is unclear when the result of the bid will be announced or what the outcome will be. At this stage, it is not possible for the company to predict the outcome of the bidding process and the company may or may not be successful.?

 During 2005, the German market contributed close to $30 million to Ranbaxy?s topline. The Betapharm acquisition would, therefore, strengthen its presence there. For Dr Reddy?s, the buyout will give it an entry into the German market.

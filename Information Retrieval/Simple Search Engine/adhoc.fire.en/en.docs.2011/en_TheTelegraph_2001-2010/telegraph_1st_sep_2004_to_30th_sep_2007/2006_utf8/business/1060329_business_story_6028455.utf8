 Bengal savers blanch at MIS bonus bomb

 CHANDRALEKHA TULAL

 The golden days

 Mumbai, March 28: Small savers in Bengal are no longer queueing up outside post offices to open monthly income scheme (MIS) accounts.

 The evidence is anecdotal at the moment: but the government?s decision to scrap the 10 per cent maturity bonus with effect from February 13 appears to have squelched savers? interest in the scheme, which is one of the biggest grossers of small savings.

 ?The exact degree of impact will be known only after the March figures are available, but there?s been a definite fall in the number of accounts opened on a day-to-day basis,? said post office officials.

 Officials say the sharp decline in the number of new MIS accounts varies between 10 per cent and almost 70 per cent, depending on the post office and the area, said officials. 

 For instance, a post office in the West Bengal circle opened an average of 15 MIS accounts daily in January. This peaked to 26 between February 1 and February 11. However, the new accounts were down to a trickle since February 13 and the same number is being maintained in March. 

 According to the data available with the West Bengal circle, the number of post office MIS accounts saw an increase of 59,552 in January and 2,43,585 in February. 

 ?The February figures in comparison with the January figures might be misleading since a huge number of accounts were opened till February 11. A sharp decline in the numbers has been witnessed since February 13,? the officials said.

 The post office MIS is a six-year savings scheme. Till February 13, it offered an 8 per cent annual interest and a 10 per cent bonus on the amount of investment made by the depositor at the time of its maturity, which meant an effective annual pre-tax yield of 9.3 per cent.

 ?However, since 80 per cent of the investors in the scheme use the monthly interest to run their expenses, we do not see the scheme totally falling out of favour. Moreover, small investors of the state still prefer security of investment over anything else, including high returns,? the officials said. 

 To ensure the popularity of the scheme, the department of post is undertaking various marketing initiatives. ?We are aggressively asking the investors to transfer the monthly interest received from the scheme to the six-year post office recurring deposit scheme, which also gives a return of 8 per cent, thereby ensuring an effective return on investment of 10 per cent,? said the officials. 

 The department has also tied up with Oriental Insurance to give a personal accident insurance cover of Rs 1 lakh at the time of opening a post office account by paying an annual premium of just Rs 15.

 According to the recent amendment, the rate of penalty on premature closure of the MIS schemes has been reduced from a uniform 3.5 per cent to 2 per cent if it is closed between one and three years, and to 1 per cent if it is terminated after three years. Earlier, there was no deduction if the amount was withdrawn between three and six years.

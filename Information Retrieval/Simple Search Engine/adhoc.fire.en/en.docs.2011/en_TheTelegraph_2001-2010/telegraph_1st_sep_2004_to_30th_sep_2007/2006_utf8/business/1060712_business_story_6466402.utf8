 Bid to hasten exit of bankrupt firms 

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 New Delhi, July 11: The government is considering a bankruptcy law to facilitate closure of sick units.

 The law is one of a series of proposed reforms for the economy. Its provisions will allow a failed concern to quickly depart from a line of business.

 According to government officials, a separate bankruptcy law could be enacted or it could be done through amendments to the existing companies act. 

 There are no specific rules on bankruptcy yet, though banks and financial institutions have the right to take over assets of defaulters.

 At present, a company is deemed potentially sick when half of its net worth gets eroded and is not considered for shut down till its net worth is fully eroded.

 The current rules allow sick firms to remain in limbo for long, frustrating stakeholders such as creditors, suppliers, bond holders and workers.

 Often firms fudge accounts to take shelter under provisions of the sick companies act to wriggle out of paying dues to creditors, the officials said. 

 Under the new rules, defaulters will have to clear their dues within a specified time, otherwise their assets will be sold off. The defaulter can partially meet its obligations to evade penal action and commit to negotiated rescheduling of the rest of the obligations. A defaulter could owe money to creditors, workers or to suppliers.

 This could mean a comprehensive legislation which makes life tougher for firms who try to fleece workers, depositors and creditors and at the same time one which gives a quicker exit option for firms that are genuinely sick because of factors beyond their control like technological obsolescence, officials said. 

 The Left too has been pressing for changes to enable banks and financial institutions to repossess assets of failed debtors. They, however, prefer an amendment to the enforcement of security, interest and recovery of debts law. 

 This law, which allows banks and FIs to take over non-performing assets of debtors, got jeopardised when the Supreme Court struck down a provision in the existing act mandating defaulters to deposit 75 per cent of outstanding dues before seeking legal redress.

 Left leaders said the over Rs 96,000-crore bad loans of the state-run banks could be wiped out easily if the government were to crack down on defaulters by amending the recovery of debts act. 

 They contend that instead of bringing changes in the law, the government has till now been helping out defaulters to write off bad loans, scaling down the profitability of PSU banks. In 2003-04 alone, some Rs 14,353 crore had been written off reducing profit margins by 36 per cent.

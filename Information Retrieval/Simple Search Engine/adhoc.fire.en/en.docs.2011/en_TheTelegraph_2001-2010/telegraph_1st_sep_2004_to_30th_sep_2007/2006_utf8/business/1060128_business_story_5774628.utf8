 FM adds new twist to airport tangle

 Chidambaram: Small talk

 New Delhi, Jan. 27: Finance minister P. Chidambaram appears to have set another cat among the pigeons by saying in ?about ten days? private companies would be asked to bid to take over India?s other two big airports, Calcutta and Chennai. 

 The statement in London?s Financial Times was attributed to him and Montek Singh Ahluwalia, deputy chairman of the Planning Commission. It comes on a day when the government was forced to put off the opening of the financial bids of pre-qualified bidders for the modernisation of Delhi and Mumbai airports till Sunday. Employees of the Airports Authority of India (AAI) today went on a flash strike against the privatisation move.

 The civil aviation ministry has assured the union leaders it would hold discussions with the employees on the ?alternative plan? they have submitted on the matter. 

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had recently said the Calcutta and Chennai airports would be modernised, but there was no mention of privatisation. Chidambaram?s statement on the issue took government officials by surprise and they refused to comment. 

 The Left parties today demanded that modernisation work at the Delhi and Mumbai airports be given to AAI as it was ?fully competent? to do so. They also objected to the ?bypassing of procedures? in the bidding process.

 In this situation, it is highly improbable that the government would be able to push through the privatisation of the other two airports as well.

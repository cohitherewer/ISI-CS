 MBL bid to give roads in Bengal a facelift

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 6: MBL Infrastructures, the Calcutta-based company engaged primarily in road construction and maintenance, wants to form a joint venture in public-private partnership to develop state highways. The company will soon approach the Bengal government with its proposal.

 The company is currently studying the condition of the roads, which have high traffic density, that connect the national highways in the sate.

 Under study are Panagarh-Dubrajpur road and Durgapur-Bankura road that connect to G.T. Road and are of immense importance to the development of Bengal.

 We hope to make a presentation before the chief minister after the Pujas, outlining how these roads can be developed to withstand and accommodate more traffic, said Maruti Maheswari, executive director of MBL Infrastructures.

 The family-owned company was formed in 1995 to take over Maheswari Brothers, the existing partnership firm, which had been into waste management and steel trading as also construction business. 

 When the golden quadrilateral project of the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI), and with it the road development projects in many states took off in 1998, it was but natural for us to focus on road construction and maintenance, said Maheswari, whose company recorded a turnover of Rs 160 crore and a net profit of Rs 8.5 crore for the year ended March this year.

 As of now, the company has orders worth Rs 370 crore on hand, which include developing a national highway in Assam into a four-lane road from a two-lane one at present.

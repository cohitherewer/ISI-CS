 Lodha: Reverse order

 Calcutta, June 28: The Company Law Board today ruled that the transfer of 33,715 shares of Priyamvada Birla in East India Investment Company to Rajendra Lodha was wrongful and should be immediately restored in the name of the original owner.

 East India Investment, Gwalior Webbing Company Pvt Ltd and Baroda Agents amp; Trading Company are the three holding investment companies that control nine manufacturing firms of the MP Birla group.

 Passing the order on an appeal by the Birla family, CLB judge S. Balasubramaniam ruled that the register of the members of the company should be rectified with immediate effect by omitting the name of Lodha and the name of Priyamvada Birla should be restored in more than 33,000 impugned shares.

 Lodha has also transferred in his name the shares held by Priyamvada in the two other holding companies. We have got the CLB order in case of East India Investment Company. Our petition pertaining to the other two companies are pending before the board, Birla camp counsel N.G. Khaitan said.

 The CLB order said: ? it (transfer of shares in Lodhas name) is a case of not only wrongful omission of the name of Priyamvada Devi but also resultant wrongful entry of the name of R.S. Lodha as the executor of the estate of Late Priyamvada Birla.

 The shares would not be in limbo as the same would continue to be a part of the estate of Priyamvada Birla administered by the executor and the estate would derive all the benefits accruing to the shares, the CLB order added.

 The board only held that the register of the members of the company be rectified by restoring the name of Priyamvada Birla for the said shares. However, Lodha will continue to administer the estate of Priyamvada, including the shares in question, as the executor according to the CLB order, the Lodha camp said.

 Meanwhile, the hearing for appointing an administrator will come up at the court of Justice Pinaki Chandra Ghose on June 29. Earlier, through an order dated June 13, the division bench of Calcutta High Court had directed that no effect be given to the order passed by Justice Kalyan Jyoti Sengupta on May 19. Justice Sengupta passed an order directing appointment of joint administrators for the estate of Priyamvada till the disposal of the probate proceedings.

 The criminal case filed by the Birla camp against Lodha will come up for hearing on July 15.

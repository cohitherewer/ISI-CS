 Calcutta, April 12: The recent surge in metal prices such as steel, aluminium and copper has added to the woes of home appliance makers, who were already hit by a rise in the cost of downstream petroleum products like plastics.

 Input costs have increased significantly across the industry over the last few months, said senior officials of Godrej amp; Boyce and Whirlpool India ? two leading white goods makers in the country. The operating margins have become wafer thin and manufacturers are no longer in a position to take a hit on their bottomline and resort to price cuts to circumvent competition, they added. 

 Does this mean that the declining prices of home appliances will hit the reverse gear? The manufacturers do not say yes, but they admit that the fall in home appliance prices this year will be less.

 Regarding hike in product prices, we have adopted a wait and watch policy to gauge the industry reaction to higher input costs, said Himanshu Jain, head (appliance division) of Godrej amp; Boyce.

 Whirlpool India may not go in for a price hike though it is hard hit by the rising input costs. 

 Our input costs have risen significantly, but we will not increase product prices, said Arvind Uppal, managing director, Whirlpool India Ltd. 

 However, home appliance prices are unlikely to come down further this year, he added.

 For the first time, Whirlpool India has reported an operating profit of Rs 1.52 crore for the nine months ended December 31, 2005, during which its sales turnover was Rs 969.3 crore.

 Godrej amp; Boyce has sold goods worth Rs 600 crore in 2005-06, but officials didnt disclose the operating margin saying it is a closely-held company. However, the companys east zone head, Shivaji Sengupta, said, Life is really difficult now.

 Both the home appliance manufacturers will step into new segments.

 Godrej amp; Boyce will launch colour televisions, which it has been planning for quite some time now, while Whirlpool mulls selling chimneys and hobs later this year.

 We dont want to enter the consumer electronics business. Whirlpool worldwide is known for its kitchen solutions, said Shantanu Das Gupta, vice-president (marketing) of Whirlpool India. 

 But we are evaluating opportunities in the consumer electronics segment. This is a logical extension after we have launched DVDs last year, said Jain.

 However, at present, each is focusing on microwave ovens, the market for which is growing at over 45 per cent annually. 

 By 2009-10, the demand for microwave ovens is expected to touch 20 lakh units against 4.5 lakh pieces now.

 Godrej has recently launched four models priced between Rs 4,990 and Rs 12,990. Last year, Whirlpool launched two models and one this year and these are priced between Rs 15,000 and Rs 18,000.

 Neither company makes microwave ovens here, nor do they have any plans of doing so. While Godrej amp; Boyce outsources it to a vendor in Delhi and a manufacturer in an East Asian country, Whirlpool gets its products from its China plant.

 Metro witnesses brisk sales

 Moving fast

 Frankfurt, Jan. 11 (Reuters): Sales at Metro, Germanys biggest retailer, rose 3.9 per cent in the final quarter of 2006, a touch below its lowered forecast after a weak performance at home, knocking almost 3 per cent off its shares. 

 Metro, a barometer of Germanys retail health, said fourth-quarter sales were 16.7 billion euros, excluding its Praktiker do-it-yourself unit, which was floated late in the quarter. 

 While foreign sales, which account for more than half of total sales, rose 11.5 per cent, sales at home fell 3.9 per cent. 

 quot;The disappointment for sure is the German business, quot; said one analyst. quot;This shows that the Christmas business was weak. quot; 

 Metro shares were down 1.2 per cent at 41.62 euros, having earlier slipped as low as 40.93 euros, making it the second-biggest loser on the blue-chip DAX index, which was up 0.6 per cent. 

 In a preliminary earnings statement, Metro said 2005 sales rose 4.2 per cent, in line with forecasts, to 55.7 billion euros. 

 Metros Real and Extra food stores continued their lacklustre performance, and their fourth-quarter sales quot;were significantly below quot; year-ago levels. 

 The Cash amp; Carry unit posted solid sales growth in the fourth quarter, Metro said, helped by international growth. Metro opened 25 new Cash amp; Carry stores outside Germany in the fourth quarter. The Media Market and Saturn consumer electronics divisions also performed well, with 32 new stores opened during the quarter, five of them in Germany. 

 Metro said its Kaufhof department stores could not compensate for the weather-related weak start into the fourth quarter. Some analysts said the decline in the fourth quarter and the Christmas period was disappointing after German retail group HDE had said retail sales over Christmas had been in line with the previous years level. 

 Metro rival KarstadtQuelle, which operates department stores and a mail-order business, managed 1.2 per cent sales growth at its department stores in the fourth quarter.

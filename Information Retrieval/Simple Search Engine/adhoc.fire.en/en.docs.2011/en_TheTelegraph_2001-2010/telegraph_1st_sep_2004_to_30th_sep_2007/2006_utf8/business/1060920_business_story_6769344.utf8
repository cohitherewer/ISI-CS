The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Dichotomy in Birla word amp; action

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Calcutta, Sept. 19: The Birlas have never pulled their punches in their battle with Rajendra S. Lodha: they have charged the chartered accountant with a diabolical will fraud to grab the Rs 5,000-crore MP Birla empire and accused him of mismanaging the companies within the group.

 So, it does come as a bit of a surprise to learn that various Birla mutual funds six to be precise hold over 8 lakh shares in Birla Corporation, the flagship company in the MP Birla empire. A large chunk of the shares were bought just a year ago.

 As of August 31, the combined holding of Birla funds was put at 1.05 per cent of Birla Corporations overall equity.

 This raises a question: is this a ringing endorsement of Lodhas management, a pure investment decision or just a tactic to pick up some heft in what promises to be a long drawn battle against Lodha that began in 2004?

 The annual general meeting today threw up the answer: the Birla funds voted against the management-sponsored resolutions. The result, however, went overwhelmingly in favour of Lodha with only 3.21 per cent shareholders opposing the resolutions.

 But if the Birla funds are putting their bets on Birla Corp and treating it as just another investment decision, they are in good company. Azim Premji of Wipro, touted as the richest Indian, has also bought some 2 lakh shares in the company in his personal capacity a fact that Lodha disclosed to shareholders today.

 Birla Corporations stock has risen 29 per cent in the past year during which the company posted its best-ever results in terms of both turnover and after-tax profits.

 Several shareholders sang paeans to the leadership of Lodha who became chairman after the death of Priyamvada Birla in 2004. However, there were dissenting voices too. A shareholder, Anil Poddar, quoted from the judgment of Justice Kalyanjyoti Sengupta on the appointment of administrator case and asked whether a tainted person like Lodha could continue. His comments echoed what the Birla family has been saying all along that M P Birla companies are being mismanaged under Lodhas control.

 Sources close to the Lodhas claimed the conduct of Birla managed funds only highlighted their double standards.

 Mutual funds should be run independently having no allegiance to the promoter. If they think Birla Corporation is a good bet and keep faith in the management, they should have voted in favour of the resolutions, sources added. Apart from Birla funds, Birla Education Trust, managed by the family, also owns some 5 lakh shares in the company. 

 Experts say all shareholders of Birla Corp have benefited as its main business cement is going through a good phase. It is difficult to find a loser in the cement industry now, an analyst said.

 No wonder then that Lodha announced a 1.25-million-tonne brownfield expansion with an investment of Rs 250 crore at the meeting.

 He also hinted that the company could look at unlocking value from real estate going forward.

 Property is the flavour of the month and will continue to be for some time, Lodha said and this will add further sheen to the Birla Corp stock.

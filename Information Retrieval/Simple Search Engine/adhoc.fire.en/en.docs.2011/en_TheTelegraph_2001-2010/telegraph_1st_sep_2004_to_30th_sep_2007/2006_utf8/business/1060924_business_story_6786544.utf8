 Hyundai pledges Rs 4191 cr

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 23: Hyundai Motors India Ltd (HMIL) will invest Rs 4,191 crore in India for setting up a car and engine plant and a research and development centre.

 Chung Mong Koo, CEO and chairman of HMIL, had recently met President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to discuss the companys investment plans.

 HMIL manufactures 3 lakh units per annum at its production facility near Chennai, in which it has already invested Rs 3,372 crore. The production is slated to double after the companys second plant begins operating by the end of 2007. The plant will involve an investment of Rs 2,429 crore. HMIL said its vendors will separately invest Rs 2,585 crore in the second plant. 

 The company has plans to make India its hub for manufacturing small cars for the export markets. 

 The new plant will primarily cater to the export market. The company will also roll out its compact car, and the existing Santro, from this second plant.

 HMIL is aiming to export 50 per cent of its production by 2008. Earlier, at the recently held Siam conference, Arvind Saxena, HMILs vice-president, marketing and sales, said, We are exporting 33 per cent of our production at present, which will increase to 50 per cent by 2008.

 The company exports to around 70 countries. It has identified another 12 to 13 locations for the purpose.

 The company is targeting an export figure of more than one lakh units for the current fiscal. It had exported around 92,000 units last year.

 Hyundai will invest Rs 1,210 crore in its second engine and transmission plant. The research and development centre, in which the company will invest Rs 184 crore, will hire around 1,000 people by 2010.

 The company has not decided upon the location for the research and development centre yet.

 Senior officials said investments would be funded through internal accruals of Hyundais wholly owned Indian subsidiary.

 Meanwhile, the company is set to launch its much-awaited high-end sedan Verna early next week. It is likely to be launched in both petrol and diesel variants.

 HMIL sold 2,52,851 units in 2005, representing a growth of 17.26 per cent. While growth in the domestic market was 11.83 per cent on sale of 1,56,291 units, exports shot up by 27.2 per cent on 96,560 units.

 Tata Tea hikes prices

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Nov. 22: Tata Tea Limited is increasing the prices of packet tea across all brands except Agni to factor in rising input costs.

 The process, which was initiated a month ago, entails prices going up between Rs 4 and Rs 6 per kg across brands.

 The company is also planning to launch a brand in the next two months, said Sangeeta Talwar, executive director - sales and marketing, Tata Tea.

 Tata Tea will also launch the countrys first branded green tea in bags.

 Less than 1 per cent of the 800 to 900-million-kg market comprises green tea.

 The company hopes to maintain the growth of 9 to 10 per cent achieved in the first half of the year for its branded tea business.

 Tata Tea has also launched single origin orthodox long-leafed tea from Assam, Darjeeling, Nilgiri and Sri Lanka to give consumers a taste of champagne tea at reasonable price points.

 Europe pledges farm support

 New Delhi, Nov. 17: The European Union today supported Indias demand to safeguard the interests of its subsistence farmers in the WTO talks. Both countries will approach the US for an early resumption of the stalled talks.

 We are seeking clarification from partner countries, particularly from the US, as to how the Doha negotiations will interact with next years farm bill relating to subsidies, EU Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson said after his extensive discussions with commerce minister Kamal Nath.

 India has taken a firm stand, particularly against the US, on protecting its vulnerable agriculture through the window of special products.

 Mandelson agreed with Indias stand. The window of special products was designated to protect the livelihood for subsistence farmers, he said.

 He said while US President George Bush was right in seeking market access, he could not expect developing countries to allow imports of highly-subsidised farm products. Mandelson feels the modalities of the Doha agreement cannot be completed by the year-end because of the setback in talks.

 Nath brought up the issues of services and rules and said, There must be parallel movement in all the areas.

 Mandelson agreed that the implications of the US farm bill relating to subsidies were also pivotal for the Doha round.

 Trade negotiations are stuck on the two issues of farm subsidies and industrial tariffs. The negotiations have centered around urging the US to cut its subsidies and the European Union to scale down subsidies and barriers to farm imports.

 The WTO talks in Geneva collapsed in July with the US refusing to budge on the issue of slashing farm subsidies and the developing countries, represented by India and Brazil, standing firm on not throwing open their markets to the influx of cheap western goods.

 Mandelson said the EU is already considering the possibility of cutting farm tariffs by 50 per cent, which comes close to the expectations of the developing countries. He has asked Nath to use Indias goodwill with the developing nations to help return to the negotiating table in the Doha round as the expiry of the US trade promotion authority looms in 2007.

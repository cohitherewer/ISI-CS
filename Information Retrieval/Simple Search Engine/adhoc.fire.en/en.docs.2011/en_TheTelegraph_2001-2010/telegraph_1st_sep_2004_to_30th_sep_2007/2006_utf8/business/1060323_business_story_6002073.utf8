The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Bangla terms for rail route

 S.P.S. PANNU 

 New Delhi, March 22: Bangladesh finance minister Saifur Rehman appears to have set the cat among pigeons by linking the revival of the Calcutta-Dhaka rail route to Bangladesh getting a corridor to Nepal and Bhutan through the Indian territory.

 If India wants greater connectivity through Bangladesh to reach its north-eastern states, it should be ready to give us access to Nepal and Bhutan through its own territory, Rehman said on the sidelines of an apex business chambers meet here today.

 However, this is at variance with the impression conveyed by senior Indian officials about the new agreement signed yesterday with Bangladesh Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia.

 According to them, the agreement provides that both the countries would make mutually beneficial arrangements for the use of their waterways, roadways and railways for commerce between the two countries and passage of goods from places in one country through the territory of the other.

 This does not cover any rights of passage to third countries in the neighbourhood such as Nepal and Bhutan or Myanmar for that matter. 

 The official website of the ministry of external affairs also states that they (Bangladesh) are agreeable to the operationalisation of the Sealdah-Jaidevpur train link.

 However, Rehmans statement clearly attaches a rider. The quid pro quo that he expects goes beyond the two countries and includes Nepal and Bhutan in its ambit. 

 While Union commerce minister Kamal Nath told the business conference that increased connectivity was essential for boosting trade between the two countries.

 Bangladesh seems to be looking at it as a strategic quid pro quo to gain access to Nepal and Bhutan through the Indian territory to enable it to carry out trade.

 Nath said, Greater connectivity is vital, as it will enable movement of goods across our land borders through sealed containers. Containerised movement of goods through the riverine route, land route and railways between India and Bangladesh will considerably reduce the existing heavy congestion at the Petropole-Benapole station.

 At present, the cost of shipping a container between Calcutta and Dhaka via Singapore costs $2,500 and the journey takes 15 days. This would be reduced to a mere $500 and the travel time to just five days if it was sent directly through the India-Bangladesh border, he added. 

 A clear priority to increase the India-Bangladesh trade would be operationalisation of fresh land customs stations and improvement of infrastructure at various land customs stations, he said. 

 Addressing the conference, Zia said India should allow duty-free import of goods from Bangladesh so that the rising trade deficit could be reduced. She also urged India to remove non-tariff barriers that were coming in the way of imports from Bangladesh.

 Zia invited Indian businessmen to invest there, as it provided an investment friendly regime. It could also serve as the gateway to the Southeast Asian markets and markets offering preferential access to goods produced in Bangladesh.

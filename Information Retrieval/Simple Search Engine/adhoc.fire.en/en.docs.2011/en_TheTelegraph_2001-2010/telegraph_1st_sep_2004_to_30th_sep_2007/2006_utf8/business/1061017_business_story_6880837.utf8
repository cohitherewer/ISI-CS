 Airline lobbying forum takes off

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Thulasidas: Coming together

 Mumbai, Oct. 16: The top honchos of domestic airlines met here today to form a federation that will provide a common platform to debate industry issues and lobby the government and hammer out solutions.

 All scheduled passenger airlines will be members of the federation. The airlines include Indian Airlines, Air-India, Jet Airways, Kingfisher, Air Sahara, Air Deccan, GoAir, Indigo, SpiceJet and Paramount Airways. It will be open to take on more members as new airlines start operations in the country.

 The new forum will be called Federation of Indian Airlines (FIA) and will be based in Delhi. It will be registered under the Registration of Societies Act within the next few weeks.

 It will have a separate office, secretariat and an independent secretary general. The forum will appoint a headhunter soon to find a secretary general.

 The federation will be established with an initial corpus of Rs 5 crore with the 10 airlines contributing Rs 50 lakh each. In the second year, the corpus will be replenished based on the budget. The minimum subscription from the second year onwards will be Rs 10 lakh.

 Each airline will have two seats on the governing council of the FIA. The airline chiefs have decided to hold monthly meeting over the next six months. After that, meetings will be held quarterly. They will set up sub-committees on topics of interest later.

 The federation has immediately decided to seek meetings with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the ministers of finance, civil aviation petroleum, defence and home to take up a variety of issues that affect their operations. The federation will also raise fiscal and financial issues with the government. The airline bosses have also identified issues that they intend to take up with the Airports Authority of India. The meeting was convened by Air-India chairman V. Thulasidas. 

 Todays meeting was attended by Indian Airlines chairman and managing director Vishwapati Trivedi, Kingfisher chairman Vijay Mallya, Jet Airways chairman Naresh Goyal, executive director Saroj Datta and CEO Wolfgang ProckShauer, Air Sahara president Alok Sharma, Air Deccan managing director G.R. Gopinath and COO Warwick Brady, SpiceJet chairman Siddhant Sharma and director Ajay Singh, Paramount Airways chairman M Thiagarajan, Indigo CEO Bruce Ashby, and GoAir MD Jeh Wadia. The airline chiefs said they had discussed on pricing issues but no decision was taken as yet. 

 We realise that the financials of the industry are not good. But pricing is not the only factor that determines profitability, Thulasidas told reporters after the late evening meeting.

 Thulasidas said the pressure on airlines from rising jet fuel costs had started to ease after the recent dip in world crude prices. However, they plan to discuss this at length with petroleum minister Murli Deora.

 Warwick Brady said, The fuel costs in India are about 30 per cent higher than in other countries. We need regulations to bring them in line with costs worldwide. 

 The other topics discussed related to the creation of private monopolies, recruitment policies, and outsourcing.

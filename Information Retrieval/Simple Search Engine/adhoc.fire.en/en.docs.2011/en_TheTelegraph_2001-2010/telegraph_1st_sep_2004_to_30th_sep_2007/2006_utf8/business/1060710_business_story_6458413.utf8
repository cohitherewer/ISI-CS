 Infotech stands strong in storm

 Which has been the best performing sector since the market highs reached in May? A look at the BSE sectoral indices shows that the IT sector has been the most defensive, with the BSE IT index falling by a mere 7 per cent ? the computation has been done by comparing the highs reached in early May with the recent highs reached a few days ago.

 The next defensive play was the sensex, which fell around 13 per cent, proving once again that in downturns it?s best to stay invested in frontline stocks. The BSE small-cap index has been the worst affected, down 28 per cent, with the mid-cap index following closely. There?s really not much to choose between the other sectoral indices, all of which have seen drops of between 20 and 23 per cent. The exceptions are the FMCG index, which is down only about 16 per cent, while the auto index is down 17 per cent.

UK market tops charts

 If global markets are considered, however, there are quite a few of them that have not really fallen by much since the highs reached in early May. Comparing the market?s high on July 7 with the high reached on May 10, the Footsie is down only 3.3 per cent. Similarly, the S amp;P 500 is down by 3.7 per cent. Among Asia-Pacific markets, Hong Kong?s Hang Seng is down 4.3 per cent while the Australian All-Ordinaries index is lower by 4.6 per cent. No wonder that there?s still a debate on in developed markets whether this can be termed a bear market. The downturn seems to be not so much a retrenchment from equities as a re-appraisal of risks, which has hit emerging markets the hardest.

Energy prices

 Why did the price of Brent crude move up by an average of 40 per cent in 2005 over 2004? Data provided by BP on its Statistical Review of World Energy 2006 helps arrive at some answers. Oil production was 3,895 million tonnes in 2005, 0.7 per cent higher than a year ago. Oil consumption was 3,836.8 million tonnes, up 1 per cent compared with the previous year. In 2004, world consumption was up 3.9 per cent, but production was higher by 4.3 per cent.

 Even though the rise in oil consumption rose at a faster rate than that in oil production, was the difference large enough for a 40 per cent increase in oil prices? Global refinery throughput rose by 0.8 per cent, giving a boost to the view that it?s the shortage in refinery capacity that?s the crux of the problem. A look at refinery capacity utilisation shows that utilisation has been rising in the Asia-Pacific and Eurasian refineries, but has actually fallen for West Asian refiners. Nor were prices higher because of lower stocks. In fact, for most of 2005, OECD commercial stocks were higher than for 2004. 

 The data show that while the supply-demand balance for crude oil is tight, speculative funds, the hurricanes and geopolitical uncertainties have been driving up oil prices. As far as India is concerned, the surprise is that India was the country with the biggest addition to proven oil reserves, in percentage terms of course. India?s proven reserves went up from 5.6 thousand million barrels in 2004 to 5.9. Of course, it?s a miniscule 0.5 per cent of the world?s reserves. We have had better luck in natural gas, where India?s proved reserves have gone up from 0.92 trillion cubic metres in 2004 to 1.10 trillion cubic metres, thanks to all those finds in the Godavari basin. It?s a shame, however, that although we have 10 per cent of the world?s coal reserves, almost as much as China?s, our utilisation is only a fraction of that country?s.

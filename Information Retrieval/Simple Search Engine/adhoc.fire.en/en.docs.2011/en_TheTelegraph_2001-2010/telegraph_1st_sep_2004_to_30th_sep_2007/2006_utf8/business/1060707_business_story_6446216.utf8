 Siemens bags Bhushan order

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, July 6: Siemens Industrial Solutions and Services Group has bagged an order from New Delhi-based-Bhushan Steel and Strips Ltd to supply electrical and automation systems for a new wide hot strip rolling mill which it will built.

 Bhushan Steel (BSSL) is constructing an integrated steel plant in Meramandali in Orissa, which will produce up to three million tonnes of steel per year.

 The company has, however, not clarified the value of the deal but the time frame is over two years.

 With the new wide hot strip rolling mill, BSSL, which already produces cold-rolled and coated strip, will be able to round off its value chain. The new mill will roll hot strip in thickness of between 1.4 and 25 millimetres and a maximum width of 1.680 millimetres. The plant will be designed for an annual production of three million tonnes in the first construction stage. The second construction stage will consist of an upgrade to 4.5 million tonnes per annum, said a company statement.

 The order includes the drives, the entire basic and process automation as well as the visualisation system. Production is scheduled to start in 2008.

 Siemens is supplying the electrical equipment, drives, basic and process automation from furnace to coil conveyor, including the technological control systems and process models for strip dimensions and temperatures.

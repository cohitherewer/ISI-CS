 Stocks tide over lows

 OUR BUREAU

 Mumbai, Aug. 1: Fitchs upgrade of Indias sovereign debt rating worked on the markets too. The sensex won over initial lows and even ended in the green, although a mere 7-point gain at 10751.66 over Mondays close of 10743.88, a net gain of 0.07 per cent.

 The good news helped the index stay positive on a day when stocks were pulled down by limited activity, low volumes and pushed up by FII inflows and shortcovering by operators. 

 The Bombay Stock Exchange 30-share index traded in the negative for a major part of the session, moving in a range of 10777.47 and 10645.99, but recovered in the last one hour on shortcovering by operators as well as foreign institutional investors (FIIs). 

 The National Stock Exchanges Nifty also edged up by 4.60 points, or 0.15 per cent, to 3147.80 from the last close of 3143.20. 

 FIIs have slowed down inflows after heavy purchases in the futures and cash segment during last week, brokers said. FIIs reported net inflows of Rs 128 crore in derivatives and Rs 185 crore in the cash segment on Monday, according to the provisional figures.

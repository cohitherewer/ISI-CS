 Calcutta, Aug. 2: Bank of Baroda has set a December deadline to restructure its card business and mutual fund subsidiaries. The public sector bank plans to rope in foreign partners for each of these subsidiaries.

 Well tie up with a foreign company for our card business, BoBCards Ltd, and also partner with a foreign asset management company for BoB Asset Management Company Ltd (which manages BoB Mutual Fund), said bank chairman A.K. Khandelwal.

 The foreign firms will pick up equity stakes in the subsidiaries. However, the bank has not yet decided on the number of shares to be sold. We will complete the deals by December. We are at an advanced stage of discussions with foreign partners for BoBCards Ltd and BoB Asset Management Company Ltd, Khandelwal said.

 The bank will also introduce wealth management and stock broking services before the end of this calendar year, according to Khandelwal. We want to be a one-stop-shop for all financial needs, he said, adding that the banks Mumbai branch would be converted into a financial shop. Later on, we will replicate this model in our other metro offices, Khandelwal said.

 The public sector bank is merging housing finance subsidiary BoB Housing Finance Ltd, associate bank Nainital Bank Ltd and primary dealership business of BoB Capital Markets Ltd with itself. The mergers are nearly over, only some regulatory nitty-gritty is being finalised, Khandelwal said.

 The bank is also scouting for foreign partners for its proposed life insurance venture. We are negotiating with some foreign insurers. However, we will have to rope in some other bank or financial institutions in the joint venture, BoB chairman said, adding that the bank was yet to select a domestic partner. It has a bancassurance tie-up with HDFC Standard Life Insurance Company.

 Bank of Baroda is planning to increase its overseas presence aggressively. We now have 59 branches and offices in 20 countries across the world. By mid-September, we will open a branch in Singapore and expect to get the host country approval before December for opening a branch in Port of Spain in West Indies, Khandelwal said. He added that BoB would soon file an application before the Reserve Bank of India for a branch in Canada.

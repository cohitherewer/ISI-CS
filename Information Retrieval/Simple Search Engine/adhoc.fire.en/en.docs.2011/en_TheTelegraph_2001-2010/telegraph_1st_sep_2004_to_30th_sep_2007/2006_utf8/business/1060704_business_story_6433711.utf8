 G. S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, July 3: EBC Bearings (India), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the European Bearing Corporation, Moscow, has set up base here to make large-sized bearings that have diameters from 400 mm to 700 mm. 

 This is the first investment by a Russian company in Andhra Pradesh.

 Martin Kanzmann, managing director of EBC Bearings(India) Ltd, said the company would invest $30 million in over three years in the Hyderabad facility.

 We aim to cater to the Indian market which imported bearings from Russia for its railways, steel, cement, power transmission and mining operations, Kanzmann said. 

 He said commercial production would begin from the second quarter of 2007. EBC sells $3 million of bearings in India. We already have a footing in the Rs 3,600-crore Indian bearings market and aim to capture 13 per cent of the market due to our price and delivery advantages, Kanzmann said.

 EBCs client base includes Severstal, MIG, Sukhoi, Kamov helicopters and Mittal Steel. V. Anonyuk the consul-general of the Russian Federation said the federation hoped to increase its trade with India from $2 billion to $10 billion by 2010.

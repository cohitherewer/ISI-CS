 Q amp;A

 On the threshold

 I am a retired person and will attain 64 years 352 days on March 31, 2007. Will I be able to avail of the threshold income limit of Rs 1,85,000 for the financial year 2007-08? I also have sold some shares in October 2003 and invested the sale proceeds in capital gains bonds for three years. Should I continue with those investments or switch to other investment avenues?

 A. Seal, Calcutta

 According to the income tax act, a senior citizen is a person who at any time during the previous year has attained the age of 65 years or more. Going by this definition, you will not be considered a senior citizen for the financial year 2007-08 and, therefore, the threshold income slab for you will be Rs 1,00,000. For your second query, there is no long-term capital gains tax on investment in listed stocks. Since, equities historically have given a higher return than any other asset class over a long period of time, you can look at investments in diversified equity schemes of mutual funds or directly in stocks.

 Tax or no tax?

 Is the pension received under LICs Varishtha Pension Bima Yojana taxable? If so, to whom should I submit Form 15H to avoid TDS? My monthly pension is credited to my bank through ECS. My total income is below Rs 1,85,000 per year. I have filed my tax return till financial year 2005-06.

 S.N. Sarkar, Salt Lake

 the government announced this scheme in 2003 budget, there was no mention that the monthly pension income from this scheme would be subject to TDS there was no mention that it would be tax-free either. Even LIC has not yet deducted any tax at source, though its all other pension plans are subject to TDS. So, we can assume that the pension income from Varishtha Pension Bima is taxable but with no TDS.

 Keep it Saral

 I am a teacher and so far I had submitted my tax returns through an income tax practitioner arranged by my school. Can I efile my returns myself?

 Swapan Kumar Mandal, Howrah

 You can do it yourself, but it is a cumbersome process. Even if you file the return in soft copy, you will have to file a duplicate in hard copy. So, it will be better if you file your return in a Saral Form which is easy to fill up.

 PDS wheat may face cut

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 4: The government is considering allocating less wheat for the public distribution system to lower the soaring food subsidy bill.

 Sources said the allocations were raised to 35 kg per family from 20 kg as there was a glut in the godowns of the Food Corporation of India (FCI).

 The increases were made in phases to reduce the carrying costs of storing wheat and create storage space for fresh FCI procurement.

 The excess stocks had posed a major problem and the Vajpayee government had taken recourse to cheap exports.

 The decision to export wheat at prices that were even lower than the price for below-poverty-line families had come in for sharp criticism from the Comptroller and Auditor General of India as well.

 However, the situation has changed. The government has not been able to procure enough wheat as private traders made huge purchases at prices that were higher than those offered by the FCI.

 Although the government offered a bonus of Rs 50 per quintal to farmers, the announcement came too late as bulk of the wheat had been sold to private traders .

 Government officials admit that this years wheat procurement at 9.5 million tonnes is the lowest in recent years. 

 Although the government was expecting to procure around 16.2 million tonnes, officials said no formal target had been set for the procurement.

 The government has, after a gap of several years, resorted to import of wheat to maintain the buffer stock and prevent prices from spinning out of control.

 The imports have triggered off a major controversy with the Opposition criticising the decision as anti-farmer in both houses of Parliament.

 Premier taste for soup 

 London, July 12 (Reuters): Premier Foods said on Wednesday it had agreed to buy the UK and Irish businesses of Campbell Soup for ?460 million and would finance the deal mainly through a rights issue.

 The purchase of the British and Irish dry soup, sauces and stock cubes business will bring projected cost synergies of ?28 million within three years and is expected to enhance margins in the first full year, the company said in a statement.

 The Campbells UK business fits Premier like a glove. The acquisition will bring an excellent portfolio of powerful and iconic brands which we intend to drive forward with increased resource and innovation, Robert Schofield, Premier chief executive, said in a statement.

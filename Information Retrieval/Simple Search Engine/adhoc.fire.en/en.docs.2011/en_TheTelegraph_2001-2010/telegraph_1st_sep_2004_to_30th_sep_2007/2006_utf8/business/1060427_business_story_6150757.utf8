 Khattar: Big plans

 New Delhi, April 26: Maruti will launch a compact car for the export market by 2008-09.

 ?This model will be exported mainly to Europe,? said managing director Jagdish Khattar. The company plans to export 1 lakh units per annum, he added.

 However, he declined to name the model, only to say ?it will be a compact car and a petrol variant?.

 As sales grow, Maruti will also rationalise product platforms and narrow down its models to only four or five.

 ?All model platforms that come below the Alto and WagonR will not be used again. New models will fall under four or five platforms,? he said. However, he made it clear that the Maruti 800 would not be discontinued. 

 ?At present, the compact car segment has 21 per cent diesel cars and we expect to have a presence there and take it further,? he said.

 Khattar said the company was planning a 1.3-litre diesel engine so that the 8 per cent excise duty on small cars could be availed of.

 He said the diesel engine plant, in which Maruti holds a 49 per cent stake and Suzuki 51 per cent, would be operational by this year-end and the first engine would be for a compact car.

 Maruti today also announced a 70 per cent dividend for 2005-06 (against 40 per cent last year), despite a single-digit growth in sales and higher raw material costs.

 Foreign shipments have gone down this fiscal by around 29 per cent and to arrest this the company was looking at new markets like Africa, West Asia and South America. Maruti?s total income (net of excise) moved up 8.04 per cent to Rs 3,392.2 crore during the fourth quarter from Rs 3,139.7 crore in the year-ago period.

 Net profit for 2005-06 rose 39.2 per cent to Rs 1,189 crore against Rs 853.6 crore a year ago. Total income (net of excise) for 2005-06 was up 10 per cent at Rs 12,481.4 crore against Rs 11,346.5 crore in the previous year.

 Maruti also formally announced that it had purchased parent Suzuki Motor?s 30 per cent stake in Maruti Suzuki Automobile India Limited (Msail), the new car manufacturing subsidiary, for Rs 12 crore. ?The board also approved the scheme of amalgamation of Maruti and Msail,? the company said.

 Car sales in India witnessed a slowdown last fiscal. Maruti managed a 7.6 per cent growth in the domestic market at 1,46,275 units in the fourth quarter. 

 Overall, fourth quarter sales (including exports) rose 5.2 per cent to 1,54,400 units from 1,46,760 units in the same period in 2004-05.

 Raw material and component prices for the company in the January-March quarter saw a 15.6 per cent rise at Rs 2,672 crore against Rs 2,310 crore a year ago.

 MUL also said it expected a double digit growth in sales this fiscal and will invest around Rs 1,400 crore towards capital expenditure including for its new car plant.

 ?We are aiming a double digit growth in sales for 2006-07,? said Khattar.

 On the capital expenditure, he said Rs 325 crore will be for MUL. ?The new car plant will involve an investment of Rs 1,524 crore of which we expect to invest 70 per cent this fiscal,? he added.

 This takes Marutis overall investment in 2006-07 to Rs 1,391 crore.

 The companys new car plant at Manesar will begin production by this year-end and will start with an initial capacity of 1 lakh units which will be scaled up to 2.5 lakh units.

 Toyota, Ford steer clear of alliances

 Fujio Cho: Friendly ties

 Detroit, Dec. 27 (Reuters): The chairman of Toyota Motor Corp met the chief executive of Ford Motor but they did not discuss the possibility of forming any alliance, Japans top auto maker said.

 It was just a get-acquainted meeting, Toyota spokesman Tomomi Imai said, adding Toyotas top executives constantly meet with counterparts at other auto makers.

 Japanese business daily Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported on Wednesday that Ford CEO Alan Mulally and Toyota chairman Fujio Cho met last week in Tokyo as the first step in potential partnership negotiations. 

 The meeting was also attended by Ford executive vice- president Mark Fields, who is in charge of restructuring the auto makers loss-making North American operations, the paper said. 

 Mulally may visit Japan again in January to meet Toyota executives, the report also said. 

 The newspaper cited unnamed sources familiar with the talks as saying Ford was interested in Toyotas hybrid and fuel-cell technologies as well as its work in reducing manufacturing and parts procurement costs.

 I cant confirm or deny the report other than to say that we have discussions with participants in our industry all the time, Ford spokesman Oscar Suris said.

 Ford shares closed up 7 cents, or nearly 1 per cent, at $7.49 on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday. 

 Toyota shares rose more than 2.5 per cent to a record 7,980 yen, in line with gains in other top Japanese auto makers shares as the dollar held near a two-month high against the yen.

 Growth, liquidity spur stock surge

 When good fundamentals are combined with a liquidity surge, theres no stopping the markets. Second-quarter GDP growth of 9.2 per cent is enough to convince anybody about the momentum in the Indian economy, which, of course, is why the money is pouring in.

 Also important is the fact that global liquidity has been surging once again. Recall the sharp plunge in Japans monetary base earlier in the year, which took some of the blame for the meltdown in the stock markets in May? Well, the seasonally adjusted Japanese monetary base showed positive growth in October, the first time in eight months. Other data confirm the gush of global liquidity in the last few months.

 The table shows that apart from the US, where the money supply has been flat, the other major economies have all seen a more rapid growth in the supply of broad money. Interestingly, the M3 numbers, which the US Federal Reserve discontinued publishing since early this year, show higher growth. The M3 data has recently been estimated by a site called Shadow Government Statistics (www.shadowstats.com). The charts show that while the narrow measures of money supply such as M1 and M2 are declining and flat respectively, M3 has been going through the roof. Its annual rate of change is now around 10 per cent compared with the 8-9 per cent rate when the Fed stopped releasing the data. So, if the M3 data are taken, liquidity has improved in the US as well.

 Last week, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said in its economic outlook, Although monetary policies have been tightened across the globe, liquidity is still abundant and financial market conditions have remained supportive to date. Well, the fact is that if broad money supply is taken as an indicator of monetary tightness, conditions havent really tightened in the last three months. That is why the yield on the US Treasury Note has fallen from more than 5 per cent to 4.5 per cent.

 Back home in India, too, the 10-year government bond yield has fallen more than 100 basis points from the heights it reached in mid-July to 7.4 per cent today. The reason has, once again, been a rise in broad money in this case M3 growth. Around the end of June, year-on-year growth in M3 was 18.1 per cent. This rate rose to a high of 19.9 per cent by the middle of August before slowly decelerating to 18.7 per cent by November 10. That rate of growth is still higher than what it was in June.

 The rise in global liquidity has also been noted by BCA Research, the global independent research outfit. It has recently said, Our measure of global excess liquidity, which typically leads trends in emerging market stocks, points to their outperformance over the next 18 months. Whats more, its not just India which has a sizzling economy at the moment. BCA Research points out, Emerging equity prices have yawned lately at weakening growth numbers out of the US, China and emerging Asia, even amid technically overbought market conditions. This is an indication that the structural forces of multiple expansion are at work, which will diminish the ability of decelerating growth to inflict substantial damage Bottom line: investors should start boosting their exposure to emerging market equities on any softness.

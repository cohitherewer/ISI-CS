 Homoeo biggies flock to India

 New Delhi, June 11: Indias Rs 630-crore homoeopathic medicine market is about to take a big leap as global top guns are planning to set up shops here. 

 India is one of the largest consumers of homoeopathic medicines in the world, said Bodo Rasler, managing director of Dr. Willmar Schwabe India Pvt Ltd. The market is growing at 20-25 per cent year-on-year and India is estimated to be an over Rs 1,000-crore market for homoeopathic medicine by 2010, he added. 

 Thats crucial to attract big players in the international market who have hitherto been exporting to India, according to Rasler.

 Germanys 500-million-euro Schwabe, the world leader in homoeopathic medicine and phytopharmaceutical products, had spotted the opportunity early and set up a subsidiary here in 1997 as a joint venture with an Indian importer as a minority partner. The company has been manufacturing medicines from its 5-acre Noida plant.

 A few smaller companies from Germany, such as Dr. Reckeweg, Heer and Madaos, are also planning to set up shops in the country. 

 Schwabes French competitor Boiron is also mulling an entry. Boiron is of the same size as us on the global scale, Rasler said

 Indian homoeopathic medicine manufacturers do not need to implement good manufacturing practices as of now, and most of them are in the unorganised sector. This puts overseas firms at a disadvantage. 

 While we are spending more on quality checks, cleanliness and hygiene, our final product prices become at least 10-15 per cent higher than those of domestic competitors, he added.

 With a turnover of Rs 20 crore, Schwabe India comes second to SBL, the domestic market leader. SBL has a market share of between Rs 35 crore and Rs 40 crore. 

 Besides making 1,600 products at its Noida plant, Schwabe India also imports nearly 250 medicines from its German parent. 

 Earlier we used to export Schwabe medicines to India through importers here. But since last year, we have taken up the import business and it adds another Rs 20 crore to our revenue, Rasler said. 

 To expand its business, Schwabe is catching doctors just passed out of college and about to start their practices. Besides, the company has also recruited 100 medical representatives across the country. If 100 per cent FDI in retail is permitted, Schwabe plans to set up its branded clinics in different cities. 

 There is big money in healthcare services business, which is expected to touch $47 billion, or 7.5 per cent of the countrys GDP, by 2012. The market was valued at $4.8 billion in 1991 when the Indian economy was opened up and within a decade it stood at $22.8 billion, growing at a compounded annual rate of 16 per cent. 

 Among alternative medicines, ayurveda tops the list with a Rs 7,500-crore market growing at the rate of 12-15 per cent in the domestic front. The allopathic medicine market is estimated to be at Rs 26,000 crore.

 PM vows more spectrum

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 20: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today said the government was working on releasing additional spectrum for commercial use by telecom operators.

 We are working towards the issue of releasing spectrum for the use of telecom operators so that the growth of this dynamic sector is not constrained by the shortage of this vital resource, he said, addressing the inaugural function of the Bharti School of Telecommunication Technology and Management at IIT Delhi.

 He also stressed on the need for a forward-looking approach for convergence (offering telecom and broadcast services on a single platform).

 Convergence has its own logic and government policy must be mindful of ground realities. No policy can be effective if it is not in step with market and technological realities of our times, Singh said.

 Titans in talks for city gas distribution

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Behuria: In the pipeline

 Mumbai, Sept. 22: Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) is in talks with Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) to form a joint venture for city gas distribution.

 We are looking at city gas distribution and, since they have the Krishna Godavari basin gas, we are talking to them, Sarthak Behuria, chairman and managing director of IOC, told reporters on the sidelines of the companys annual general meeting.

 Behuria said the corporation was in talks with other companies to form similar joint ventures.

 Even if Indian Oil is successful in forging a deal with Reliance, the joint venture will not be able to distribute gas in both Delhi and Mumbai. The non-compete agreement between the Ambani brothers Mukesh and Anil has reserved the gas distribution in the two metros for the younger scion.

 Sources said they could not comment on the target centres for gas distribution venture as the talks were at a preliminary stage. Last year, Indian Oil had formed a joint venture with GAIL to jointly implement city gas projects in Agra and Lucknow. 

 Initially, the joint venture company will supply natural gas to 1,000 domestic, 20 commercial and close to 17,000 automobile consumers in Agra and to 1,000 domestic, 62 commercial and 200 automobile consumers in Lucknow. 

 You have to approach owners of the gas and thats what we have done, Behuria said.

 Addressing shareholders, Behuria said the corporation had laid out a vision of being a $60-billion company by 2011-12 from the present level of $41 billion. Over the next five years, the company will spend close to Rs 55,000 crore in its core activities of refining and marketing and also in other areas like petrochemicals. 

 IOC is spending Rs 8,000 crore this year as capital expenditure in refinery upgradation and new petrochemical projects. 

 Beyond its traditional business, Indian Oil is working to entrench itself firmly in the petrochemicals business by 2011-12 through large-scale investments. 

 Besides the two petrochemical hubs shaping up at Panipat and Paradip and equity investment in Haldia Petrochemicals, the corporation is planning to develop a chemical park in Haldia, the IOC chairman told shareholders.

 As part of its Rs 30,000-crore investment plan in petrochemicals by 2011-12, IOC is developing petrochemical hubs with world scale plants at Panipat in Haryana and Paradip in Orissa. It has commissioned an integrated plant for paraxylene/purified terephthalic acid (PX/PTA) at Panipat recently to serve as building blocks for the polyester industry. 

 According to Behuria, Indian Oil will set up a naphtha cracker at Panipat by 2009 to serve as a mother plant for downstream polymer units.

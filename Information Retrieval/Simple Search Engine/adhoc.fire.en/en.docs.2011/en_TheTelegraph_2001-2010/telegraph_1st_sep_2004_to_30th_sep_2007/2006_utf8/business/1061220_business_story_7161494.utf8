 Sebi mulls new delisting guidelines

 SRIKUMAR BONDYOPADHYAY

 Calcutta, Dec. 19: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) is planning to scrap the existing reverse book-building process for voluntary delisting of shares by companies from stock exchanges. Instead, the market regulator has proposed to put in place an alternative mechanism under which the price at which shareholders of a company that wishes to delist can exit would be the floor price plus 25 per cent premium.

 At present, delisting is governed by the Sebi (Delisting of Securities) Guidelines, 2003.

 According to the existing guidelines, which came into effect from February 2003, an exit option to public shareholders is mandatory if a company or its promoters wish to delist its shares. To ensure a fair exit price for investors, the guidelines prescribed the reverse book-building method for price discovery in a transparent manner. 

 Under the reverse book-building method, the company or the acquirer of the shares announces a floor price based on the average highs and lows of closing prices of the shares during the 26 weeks preceding the buy-back offer and public shareholders bid for the number of shares they want to sell and state the price on the basis of the floor price. The final or the exit price is the rate at which the maximum number of shares is offered for sale. 

 However, Sebi noted in the scrutiny of the reverse book-building process that a group can influence the price discovery with the disproportionate powers it enjoys by holding a large portion of shares. There could also be a possibility of frivolous bids to destabilise the delisting offer. Moreover, the provision to revise bids is also leading to cartelisation in price discovery. Besides, promoters of the company are also free to reject the price discovered through the book-building process.

 It was increasingly felt that the book-building process, which was to aid in the determination of a fair exit value for the shareholders, was not fully achieving the objective and the perceived investor friendliness of the price discovery mechanism was not necessarily translating into genuine discovery of price, the market regulator said in the concept paper on the proposed Sebi (Delisting of Security) Regulations, 2006.

 So, Sebi has proposed a new mechanism. The share price for an exit offer will be the higher of (a) the floor price plus a premium of 25 per cent or (b) the fair value determined by an accredited rating agency plus a premium of 25 per cent, the paper noted.

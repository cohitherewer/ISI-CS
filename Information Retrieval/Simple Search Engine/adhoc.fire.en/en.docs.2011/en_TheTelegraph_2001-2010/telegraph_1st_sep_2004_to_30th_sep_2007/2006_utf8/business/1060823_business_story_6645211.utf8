 Calcutta, Aug. 22: Tata Motors will source more than 80 per cent of the components of its Rs 1-lakh car from vendors.

 The outsourcing component would be greater than the Tata ACE, which is at 82 per cent.

 We are looking at about 100 tier-I suppliers for our small car project. The total number of suppliers would range from 300 to 400 and some of them would be from Bengal and the neighbouring states. We would want them to be located in close proximity to the plant and therefore, the 1,000-acre plot also includes a provision for a 300-acre vendor park, said B.B. Parekh, deputy chief - strategic sourcing, strategic sourcing group, Tata Motors.

 Parekh also did not rule out the possibility of sourcing from the Jamshedpur plant.

 Tata Motors has decided to streamline its vendor base and provide economies of scale, besides ensuring quality.

 The company had around 400 suppliers (tier I) six years ago and currently has half the number, said Parekh.

 We are looking at vendors who can match the high scales of the small car, invest in automation, ramp up volumes according to requirement and put up multiple facilities next to the vehicle plant. The tier I supplier should have the capability to design, develop and validate products, Parekh added.

 The company would focus on body in white (BIW), painting, trims and fitment and vehicle assembly.

 Tata Motors is in talks with tyre companies as the radial tyres would have a special size.

 We are deciding on the level of plastic components in the small car as it involves cost increase. The cost margin for this project is already tight, Parekh said.

 Globally, the smart car from the Mercedes stable has one of the highest plastic components at around 40 per cent. Currently, plastic is more expensive than steel and helps lower the cars weight and improves fuel efficiency.

 A Tata Motors car usually has around 15 to 20 per cent of plastic components.

 We are not looking at any alternative location and even Uttaranchal, where we are setting up an ACE plant, is speculative. But since the plant takes an average of five months to start operations, the sooner we get the land the better, said Parekh.

 The company would roll out more than 2 lakh units of the small car.

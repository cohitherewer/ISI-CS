The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Board berth guesswork in steel deal

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Calcutta, June 27: With the merger of Mittal Steel and Arcelor likely to go through shortly, all eyes are now on the constitution of the board of directors and the management board of the combined entity.

 The Luxembourg-based company has said all the 12 members on the Arcelor board will be retained, but Mittal Steel is still keeping its options under wraps.

 The new 18-member Arcelor-Mittal board will be loaded with Arcelor men, leaving only six positions for Mittal Steel though the Mittal family will have an overwhelming 43 per cent stake in the merged company.

 A Mittal Steel spokesperson told The Telegraph from London that the names would be announced once the merger goes through by July-end.

 As of now, it is certain that L.N. Mittal will be the president of the board of directors, which leaves two non-independent and three independent directors to be nominated by Mittal Steel, the spokesperson added.

 At present, Mittal Steel has nine members on its board of directors of which five are independent. 

 The spokesperson said all the five independent directors on its board would qualify to join the Arcelor-Mittal board. However, only three of the five ? Narayanan Vaghul, Ambassador Andre Rozental, Rene? Lopez, Muni Krishna T. Reddy and Lewis B. Kaden ? can be nominated by Mittal Steel on the merged companys board.

 This leaves two non-independent members from the Mittal Steel side. There are four of them now ?L.N. Mittal as the chairman and CEO, Aditya Mittal as the CFO, Vanisha Mittal Bhatia and former ISG head Wilbur L. Ross.

 As with the board of directors, the management board of Arcelor-Mittal will also have a larger representation from Arcelor. Mittal will have three members against Arcelors four.

 Mittal Steel has already nominated Aditya on the management board, while two more executives remain to be chosen.

 It would be interesting to see whether Aditya figures both in the management board as well as the board of directors. To accommodate him, the present management structure of Arcelor will have to undergo a change since, at present, separate sets of people sit on the management board and the board of directors of Arcelor. For instance, CEO Guy Dolle, who spearheaded initial resistance to the Mittal offer, sits on the management board and not on the board of directors.

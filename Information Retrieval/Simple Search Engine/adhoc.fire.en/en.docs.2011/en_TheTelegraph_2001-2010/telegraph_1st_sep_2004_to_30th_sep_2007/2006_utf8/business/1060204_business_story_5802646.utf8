 Sun Pharma to spin off R amp;D unit

 Stock taking

 Mumbai, Feb. 3: In an interesting move, which has not yet been undertaken by its peers in the industry, Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd is planning to demerge its research and development (R amp;D) undertaking into a new company. 

 The R amp;D programme of Sun Pharma, headed by Dilip Shanghvi, currently includes a new chemical entity (NCE) and two novel drug delivery systems (NDDS). 

 Among them, while the NCE has just completed phase I clinical studies, the company is hopeful of filing an application for the two NDDS products over the next few months.

 Sun Pharma today informed stock exchanges that its board will meet on February 9 to consider a proposal to demerge the R amp;D undertaking, including the new drug delivery systems, into a new company. It did not provide further details.

 Although officials from Sun Pharma refrained from making any comments on the proposed board meeting, market circles expect the company to list this undertaking at the stock exchanges and issue shares to existing shareholders.

 It is an interesting move. The company wants to separate the innovative work. With this, it will be able to lend further focus to both entities, said an analyst from a brokerage.

 The company decided to demerge the R amp;D activities at a time when it has been focussing on research.

 Shanghvi recently told analysts in a conference call that the R amp;D spend by the company during the first nine months of this fiscal was 10 per cent. Its target was 10-11 per cent. 

 The company has not only increased the R amp;D investment, but also maintained margins, he added.

 Sun Pharma has two R amp;D facilities, one in Vadodara and the other in Mumbai, with a total headcount of over 500. Though it has completed phase I studies of the NCE, the company will reveal the details of the product only after completing the phase II of clinical trials.

 During the first nine months of this financial year, Sun Pharmas international business grew 41 per cent, which comprised 38 per cent of its sales. It is expected to touch 50 per cent over a period.

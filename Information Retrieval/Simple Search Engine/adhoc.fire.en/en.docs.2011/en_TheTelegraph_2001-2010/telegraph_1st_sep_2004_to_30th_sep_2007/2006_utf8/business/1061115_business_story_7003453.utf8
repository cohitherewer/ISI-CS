 MakeMyTrip mulls stake sale

 GARIMA SINGH

 New Delhi, Nov. 14: Online travel portal MakeMyTrip India is considering a stake sale to raise funds for its retail expansion plans. The company is also weighing the option of making an initial public offering (IPO) in 2008.

 We are looking at raising approximately $10 million by the end of this calendar year ... about the same as we raised last year. Also, depending on market dynamics, we are likely to go in for an IPO in 2008, Deep Kalra, founder and CEO of MakeMyTrip told The Telegraph.

 He declined to comment either on the percentage of equity dilution or the amount the firm plans to raise through the IPO.

 He said, It is too early to say. Depending on the necessity, we will decide how much money we need to raise.

 The company has an enterprise valuation of $50 million.

 On expansion plans, Kalra said the company is looking at making offline acquisitions as part of its retail strategy to be present in different cities across the country.

 Kalra said the firm is eyeing a turnover of Rs 550 crore in the current fiscal against Rs 200 crore in the last financial year.

 It has about 400 employees, including 200 in a 24-hour call centre. Continuing its focus on leisure and small business, Kalra said the firm has been operating on a margin of 10 per cent.

 The one-stop travel website, which is eyeing a registered user base of five lakh by March 2007, offers online booking of air tickets, hotels, car rentals, weekend packages and road trips within and from India.

 The company was set up in 2000 to initially cater to the booming US-to-India travel market.

 Headquartered in New Delhi, the company also has offices in New York and Australia.

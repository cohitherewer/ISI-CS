 Cellebrum off to Singapore

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 23: Cellebrum, a telecom value added services (VAS) firm of the M-Corp group, has set up a 3G competence centre in Singapore to research and develop 3G services for India.

 The company has invested $3.5 million for the centre and is expected to foot the same amount in the next three months.

 The centre will garner overseas clients besides building the companys competence and engaging in research for the imminent 3G roll-out, said Saket Agarwal, chief operating officer of Cellebrum.

 The companys turnover in the value added services has been Rs 50 crore in the previous fiscal and is expected to reach between Rs 100 and Rs 120 crore this year.

 The Indian value added services market is estimated to be at Rs 500 crore now and become Rs 4,000 crore by 2010, of which the SMS segment will comprise 40-45 per cent.

 While the SMS segment has reached a plateau in terms of growth, the VAS, including other services such as hello tunes, has grown by 70 to 80 per cent in the last 18 months.

 The GPRS value-added services are estimated to be at 7-8 per cent of the VAS market, which is expected to go up to 12 to 13 per cent by the end of the year.

 Cellebrum has developed VAS such as background music for around 20 operators, which enables users to hear background music during a mobile call. There is also the Pay for Me service, a collect call service which enables mobile users to make calls even after running out of balance. 

 Services such as the select caller list allows mobile subscribers to maintain a white list of numbers to call and a black list of the numbers disabling their call.

 The Singapore centre has enabled the company to serve eight to nine overseas clients, which includes MTML and Hutch Indonesia. The company is making representations in the UK and is expecting to crack the UK market soon.

 One of our key services is the international roaming package, which involves 440 operators across 250 countries.

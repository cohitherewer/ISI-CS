 Selloff panel to unravel Balco knot

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY 

 New Delhi, May 15: The core group on disinvestment is likely to meet later this month to take a final decision on the sale of governments 49 per cent stake in Bharat Aluminium Company (Balco). 

 Because of the strong opposition voiced by both attorney-general Milon Banerjee and the Left parties, top officials said it was unlikely that the government would sell its residual holding in Balco to Sterlite at the pre-determined sum of Rs 1,098 crore. 

 The attorney-general has told the core group, in writing, that the government has three options: negotiate the sale of the rump shares with Sterlite or any other party based on market rate make a public issue; or decide against any sale if it is in the public interest and looking at the profitability of Balco. 

 Sources said after assessing the legal consequences of adapting the attorney-generals opinion, the government may opt for a public sale. Sterlite had earlier served a notice to the government that said its legal right to buy the shares could not be ignored. 

 Officials said the attorney-generals opinion is quite clear. It says in view of the sections within the Companies Act 1956 and Indian Contract Act 1872, the provision of valuation date and call option do not survive and consequently Sterlite cannot exercise the option or bind the government to accept the same. 

 The attorney-general also said it would not be in public interest to sell the shares held by the Government of India at a price as valued by SBI Caps; divestment at a lesser price would mean loss to the exchequer. To reiterate, it is imperative and advisable for the government to obtain a fair valuation on a current date to ensure that the best price is secured for the shares, if at all the government decides to divest. 

 CPI leader Brinda Karat also made a pointed query on the valuation by SBI Caps in the Rajya Sabha. She wanted to know whether there was any business interest between the Sterlite Group and Dalal Mott MacDonald which was engaged by SBI Caps to value the residual stake in Balco. 

 Mines minister Sis Ram Ola said in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha today that Dalal Mott MacDonald was engaged as lenders engineer on behalf of ABN Amro Bank for Balcos expansion project at Korba in Chhattisgarh and had no legal contract with Sterlite. 

 Earlier too, the government had been divided on the issue after officials pointed out that Sterlites management structure itself got changed since it bought Balco from the NDA government four years back. 

 Sterlite sold its majority holding to London-based Vedanta two years ago. However, the government had accepted Sterlites contention that there was no real change in ownership as Vedanta too is owned by the Aggarwal family, which had promoted Sterlite. 

 The Balco sell-off has proved to be a jinxed deal for the government. When the NDA government sold it off for a mere Rs 550 crore four years back, most Opposition leaders, including many in todays cabinet, cried foul. 

 The selloff was on the basis of an assessment done by an income tax valuer, who pegged Balcos assets at Rs 1,100 crore. Kapil Sibal, then a Congress MP in the Upper House, had estimated the value to be anything between Rs 2,300 crore and Rs 4,500 crore, depending on the method of valuation adopted.

 EPFO seeks govt help to sustain rates

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 20: The Employees Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) has expressed its inability to sustain the current interest rate of 8.5 per cent for its four crore subscribers without government support.

 We have almost exhausted our reserves and continuing with the existing interest rate will lead to a deficit, said Central Provident Fund Commissioner A. Vishwanathan.

 At present, there is a reserve of Rs 55 crore and that too is meant for special purposes, he added.

 According to EPFOs calculation, given the present earnings and anticipated expenditure, the break-even point, where the fund does not have to dip into its reserves, would be less that 8 per cent.

 Given the current earnings and anticipated expenditure, it is not affordable to pay an interest rate above 8 per cent, said Vishwanathan.

 He, however, said if the Central Board of Trustees (CBT), which fixes the interest rate, decides in favour of 8.5 per cent and the government gives compensation, there is no harm in continuing with the existing rate.

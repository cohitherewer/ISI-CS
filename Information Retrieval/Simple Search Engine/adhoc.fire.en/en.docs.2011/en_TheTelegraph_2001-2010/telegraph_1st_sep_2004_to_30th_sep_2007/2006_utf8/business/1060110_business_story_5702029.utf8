The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Assam Company demerger on hold

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Looking ahead

 Calcutta, Jan. 9: Assam Company Ltd (ACL) is likely to delay the demerger of oil and tea businesses.

 The company had appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) in July 2005 to evaluate the tea and oil divisions. ACL wanted to list the oil division on the bourses.

 However, it has decided to wait till the oil business becomes more robust.

 The company board will meet at the end of this month to take a final call on the issue.

 We are yet to take a final call on this subject. The board will decide, Abhay Chawdhry, chief financial officer (CFO) of the company, told The Telegraph.

 PwC has valued the oil business between $157million and $187 million (Rs 700-800 crore) and tea between Rs 330 crore and Rs 360 crore.

 ACL feels that its oil division will be valued much higher after one-and-a-half years later when there is a steady cash flow from it.

 The company hopes to produce 250,000 barrels of oil in 2006 from the Amguri field in Assam-Arakan valley, where it has a 40 per cent interest. Canadian explorer Canaro Resources Ltd ? the operator in the block ? holds the remaining stake.

 If the company is able to meet the oil production target, it would double its profits to Rs 40 crore from the present level since the crude oil price is ruling firm in the international market.

 Moreover, ACL plans to raise funds from the overseas markets in future. The demerger will prove a hindrance in that too as the investing community may not like to bet on the oil business at a juncture when the production is yet to be ready.

 It plans to raise $40 million through an overseas float to fund its oil exploration and production (E amp;P) business to cash on the boom in the international crude oil market.

 The company is in talks with various market participants to raise the fund. 

 The issue is likely to hit the market in the next six months.

 Even as the modalities of the issue is being worked out, it is likely to be foreign currency convertible bonds (FCCB).

 This offer will be in addition to the private placement with three Mauritius-based foreign financial institutions (FIIs).

 ACL will raise Rs 188 crore by issuing warrants by placing Re 1 share at a premium of Rs 22.25 with the FIIs.

 It bought a 33 per cent stake in an Australian prospect for $1 million, for which it has tied up with DMS Exploration, USA.

 The company has also signed a memorandum of agreement with the Texas-based company for jointly exploring opportunities in Nigeria, Kazakhstan, Australia, Indonesia.

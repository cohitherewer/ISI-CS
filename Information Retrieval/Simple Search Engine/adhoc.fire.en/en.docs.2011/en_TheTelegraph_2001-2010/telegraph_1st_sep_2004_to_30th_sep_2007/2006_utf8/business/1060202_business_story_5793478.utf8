 Nath throws weight behind Mittal bid

 London, Feb. 1: Commerce minister Kamal Nath, who is in London for trade talks with his British counterpart, has given tacit support to the $23-billion bid by Lakshmi Mittal to take over Arcelor ? his Luxembourg-based but French-dominated rival.

 Emphasising that Mittal Steel was technically a Rotterdam-registered company, Nath said: ?India and the European Union have a strategic partnership, which includes an economic engagement. And we would hope that this bid by a Dutch company, which has a shareholding by a person of Indian origin, will be looked at in the light that it brings gains to France.?

 Perhaps keeping in mind that French President Jacques Chirac is due to visit India on February 20 and 21, he commented: ?It must be carefully studied before it?s summarily dealt with because, of course, India will be watching this very carefully.?

 Arcelor has 30,000 employees in France, where Mittal did not have a favourable response. His Luxembourg visit was also unsuccessful.

 The European Union?s internal market commissioner, Charlie McCreevy, has said he sees no difficulty for the deal on internal market grounds.

 But others argue that the proposed deal is likely to fall within the jurisdiction of the European Commission for review on competition grounds.

 Mittal will be grateful for the strong support expressed for him by Bajaj Auto chief Rahul Bajaj, who has travelled to London as part of the Indian delegation that went to the World Economic Forum in Davos with Nath.

 ?If it (Mittal?s bid) does not infringe anti-trust legislation in the EU, I don?t see any reason why this offer should not go through if the shareholders at Arcelor accept it. If the shareholders don?t accept it, nobody comes into the picture. But the government of France or the EU should not come in the way if there is no anti-competition (involved),? Bajaj told The Telegraph after Nath had spoken in glowing terms about the Indian economy at a well attended meeting of the Commonwealth Business Council.

 The consumer might benefit from such a deal, said Bajaj. ?I could get cheaper steel. I buy a huge amount of steel ? I make 2.2 million two-wheelers and three-wheelers every year. I want a consolidation of the steel industry. If it is rejected for parochial and narrow nationalistic reasons and not approved under some guise of anti-trust, it will be a shame for those who do that.?

 ?I am the only Indian on the international advisory committee of the New York Stock Exchange. I am on the World Economic Forum?s international advisory council ? I was its co-chairman. I am the only Indian on the Prince of Wales?s International Business Leaders? Forum. I am all for globalisation,? he added.

 He did not want India to retaliate if the French blocked Mittal.

 Bajaj added: ?Though I am not a steel man, I am chairman of a (relatively) small steel company in India, Mukund Steel, and I use a lot of steel. I also make a lot of steel, but I don?t make flat products. I make special alloy steel for the automotive industry.?

 Explaining why he supported Mittal, Bajaj said: ?Apart from my sentimental and emotional reasons I fully support this deal because I believe in totality. With any such huge deals, there are downsides. I hope this deal goes through and I believe in totality it will be good for the world. There will be other steel companies that will (also) consolidate.?

 He drew attention to the deals in the cement sector in India. ?Holcim (of Switzerland) has taken over ACC in India. It is now taking over Gujarat Ambuja. So one huge group will be (headed by) Kumarmangalam Birla and another by Holcim. In all these deals, there is a positive side and a negative side.?

 European stand

 France and Luxembourg pledged to defend steelmaker Arcelor on Wednesday against a $23-billion bid by Mittal Steel, which European politicians fear could threaten tens of thousands of jobs.

 ?This hostile bid by Mittal Steel calls for a reaction that is at least as hostile,? Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker said after meeting French President Jacques Chirac.

 The comments pushed the rhetoric in Europes five-day-old steel war to a new pitch as the European nations that gave birth to Arcelor four years ago ? France, Luxembourg and Spain ? struggled to find concrete ways of blocking the bid.

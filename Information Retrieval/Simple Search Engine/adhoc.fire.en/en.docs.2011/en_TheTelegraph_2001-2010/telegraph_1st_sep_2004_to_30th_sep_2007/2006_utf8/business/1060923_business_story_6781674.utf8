 Oil duo fails to meet output targets

 Crude shock

 New Delhi, Sept. 22: The Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd (OIL) have failed to meet their respective targets for crude oil production during August.

 According to official figures, while ONGCs output in Assam has fallen short of its target by 17.5 per cent, it has also slipped in its prime fields in Gujarat and Mumbai High.

 If lower output in domestic fields is not made up for in subsequent months, it will result in larger imports. This can spell trouble for the state-run oil companies already caught in a crunch because of the difference between global and domestic prices, which they have to partly bear.

 Turbulent weather in the Arabian Sea and the floods in Gujarat have hit the companys operations in the western region.

 The Mumbai region, which includes the offshore Mumbai High fields, accounts for two-thirds of ONGCs total output. The company produced only 1.399 million tonnes from these fields during August, which was 12 per cent short of the targeted 1.592 million tonnes.

 Restoring the Mumbai High field to its normal output after the devastating fire that destroyed the BHN platform last year is proving to be more difficult than initially envisaged. The company has already missed its July deadline to achieve the goal.

 A senior ONGC official told The Telegraph that installation of the floating production system was delayed by the turbulence in the high seas because of strong monsoon winds and heavy rains.

 The company hired the floating production system to serve as a substitute for the BHN platform till another one is built again. However, all the wells could not be connected to it because it was impossible to work in the rough weather.

 ONGC has produced 0.493 million tonnes of crude from its Gujarat fields, falling 7.2 per cent short of the 0.531-million-tonne target for the month.

 A senior official said, Heavy rains and power shutdowns posed a major problem in the state as a result of which crude oil production was adversely affected.

 The poor law and order situation in Assam has been cited as the main reason for the shortfall in production. Frequent strikes and bandhs have prevented the oil companies from realising the full potential.

 OIL told the petroleum ministry that repeated blockades by local people at Barekuri, Khagorijan, Baghjan and Chanbua areas in upper Assam prevented it from achieving the target for the month.

 The company produced 0.267 tonnes of crude from its oilfields in Assam and Arunachal Pradesh, which was 10.4 per cent less than the target of 0.298 tonnes for the month. In relative terms, OILs performance in Assam was better than that of ONGC as the latter produced only 0.113 million tonnes of crude, while the target was 0.137 million tonnes.

 ONGCs crude oil production target for the current financial year has been fixed at 27.35 million tonnes, which is 2.76 per cent higher than last years target of 26.61 million tonnes. The company had fallen short of its annual target last year.

 The target for gas production for 2006-07 has been raised by 2.65 per cent to 21.97 billion cubic metres from the previous years 21.41 billion cubic metres.

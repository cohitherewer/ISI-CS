 Nokia five in four months

 Kuala Lumpur, Feb. 15 (PTI): Calling India a key player in its growth, telecom major Nokia today said it would launch five GSM handsets in the country within the next four months.

 The upwardly mobile and high-tech middle class was the fastest growing social segment in India and the handsets ? 6131, 6070, 6233, 6103 and 6125 ? would be introduced in the country focussing on this segment, Nokia vice-president Mauro Montanaro said.

 Showcasing the products here, he said they were likely to be priced at $100 upwards, exclusive of local taxes. 

 Convergence and 3G products would increase exponentially from 2005-07 in Asia with key drivers being India, along with Brazil and China. All the five products belong to that category, he added.

 The models are designed keeping in view the middle class behavioural pattern, who change handsets but reluctantly. 

 However, the rural market and smaller towns in India will trigger the growth of mobile handsets, Montanaro said, adding that the company would chalk out a strategy to enter these markets in a big way. But first, operators should roll out their services in these markets in a much larger way than their current presence. Only then, we can devise the growth strategy for these markets, he said.

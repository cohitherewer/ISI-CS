 Mittals officially launch Arcelor bid

 Brussels, May 18 (AP): Mittal Steel Co officially launched its 21-billion euros ($27 billion) offer for rival Arcelor SA on Thursday, seeking a tie-up that would join the worlds two largest steelmakers into a global titan.

 The cash and stock offer, launched in Luxembourg, France and Belgium, is open until June 29. Mittal said it would also launch a bid in Spain and the United States when market regulators clear the offer.

 Arcelor, based in Luxembourg, has so far rejected the offer as hostile, saying the best thing for the companys shareholders is Arcelors current management and plans. Most of the companys equity is held by a wide variety of small and institutional investors, as well the governments of Luxembourg and Belgiums Walloon region.

 In a move that could help Arcelor defend itself, the company has said it plans to spend up to 7.5 billion euros ($9.5 billion) to buy back almost a quarter of its shares.

 Arcelor had no immediate comment Thursday but shareholders meet Friday to discuss the share buyback.

 Mittal chairman and CEO Lakshmi Mittal said in a statement that his companys offer has been well received by markets through the considerable value created.

 We continue to believe that our offer is a very attractive one, structured to enable Arcelor shareholders to participate in the exciting growth potential of the combined company, whilst also receiving a generous cash element, he said.

 Markets did not react warmly. Arcelor shares fell by 4.39 per cent in Brussels and by 2.59 per cent in Paris after the bid was launched. It also headed the losers on the Madrid exchange, falling 2.3 per cent, although Mittal has not yet opened the offer in Spain. Mittal fell 2.54 per cent on the Amsterdam exchange.

 Merging the worlds top steelmakers would create a firm with a 10 per cent share of global steel production and a market capitalisation close to $40 billion (33 billion euros).

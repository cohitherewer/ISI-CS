 Corporate India basks in reflected glory

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 20: Tata Steels takeover of Corus, one of the leading steelmakers in the world, saw Indian industry basking in reflected glory.

 S.K. Rungta, chairman of the Steel Authority of India Ltd, told The Telegraph: Its good for global steel industry ... and speaks volumes about the intrinsic strength and maturity of the Indian steel industry. 

 SAIL, which is Indias largest steel-maker and Tata Steels rival in the domestic market, has been looking for acquisitions of coal mines abroad and has zeroed in on mines in Poland and Russia. 

 Jindal Stainless, which is trying to buy out a large Thai steel-maker to increase its footprint and output, feels the move is part of a global phenomenon to beat possible future slumps an cost rises.

 Jindal Stainless managing director V.S. Jain said, Mergers are the way forward for the steel industry. Otherwise if the industry remains fragmented then the next slump will simply see it crashing as it did some years back. Mergers and acquisitions are inevitable and it is better that we create stronger steel brands. 

 Steel analysts feel Tatas takeover of Corus spells the way forward for Indian steel makers here, but it will have little impact on the domestic market. 

 Except in terms of technology availability. The Tatas can now access at far cheaper rates new steel making technology which Corus has or is developing, S.K. Sengupta, a market analyst said. 

 CII, the apex industry chamber that has been working hard to promote Indian takeovers abroad, also welcomed the buyout. R Seshasayee, president of the Confederation of Indian Industry, said, We are delighted of course. The Tata Steel-Corus agreement is a sign of a confident India Inc being recognised as a very significant global economic player. 

 The internationalisation of the Indian corporate sector has reached a new high with this landmark deal.

 India Inc feels the Indian steel industry has come of age through a phase consolidation. 

 This is a precursor to what we can expect over the next 3-4 years, said Sunil Kant Munjal, managing director of Hero Corporate Services.

 NRI industrialist Swaraj Paul said an alliance between Tata Steel and Corus would be a win-win situation for both of the sides.

 There is consolidation taking place in the steel industry ... It certainly is (moving) in that direction and I am sure it will be a very good idea, quot; he added.

 Paul said both Tata Steel and Corus were very good companies, So the match may be a win-win situation.

 Bangalore, Oct. 15: Goodbye Google, Yahoo and other search engines that throw up bizarre non-Indian results. 

 Your search on the world wide web got more narrowed down to as much as your neighbourhood with Guruji.com.

 The new search engine, targeting Indian browsers, focuses on providing better search results for Indians by fetching locally relevant results. For example, when you search for The Telegraph, Guruji will throw up the Indian newspaper at www.telegraphindia.com. 

 Guruji co-founder Anurag Dod said at present there were no search engines that cater to the Indian searcher.

 What sets us apart is our focus on the Indian market and the Indian browser. When Indians type in keywords, the results will be essentially Indian. 

 Guruji.com uses crawl technology which is a complex computing system that crawls the web identifying Indian content using sophisticated algorithms. 

 It trawls the web, indexes the data that it gathers and provides the user with a simple keyword based interface to get the data quickly and efficiently, he said. 

 At present, Guruji accesses 30 million pages and will soon access twice that number.

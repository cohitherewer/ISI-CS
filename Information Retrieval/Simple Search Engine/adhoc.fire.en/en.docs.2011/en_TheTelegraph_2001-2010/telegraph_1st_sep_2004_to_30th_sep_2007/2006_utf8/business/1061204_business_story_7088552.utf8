 Textile mills fail to get tech support cash

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Dec. 3: After a lull, the issue of reimbursement under Technology Upgradation Fund Scheme (TUFS) has returned to trouble the textile industry. Funds of around Rs 500 crore has not yet been released by the ministry of textiles, despite North Block allocating the required amount. 

 If industry circles are to be believed, the backlog lasts till December 2005 and the amount is not being cleared despite repeated assurances given by ministry officials.

 The TUFS, which was launched in 1999, provides 5 per cent reimbursement on the interest charged by the identified financial institutions on the project for which loans have been disbursed. If a textile unit obtains a loan from a financial institution or a bank at an 11 per cent interest rate, it pays the necessary amount that includes interest. 

 But from the total interest charged the government reimburses 5 per cent. This is first cleared by the ministry of finance, and later by the ministry of textiles. The funds are placed with nodal agencies such as IDBI Ltd, and other banks that reimburse the borrowers. Sources added that these funds are usually released every quarter. 

 The total pending amount is over Rs 500 crore. What is surprising, however, is the fact that some funds that were supposed to have released in December last year have not reached us yet. Moreover, not a penny have been freed for the March, June or September quarters for reasons best known to the ministry of textiles. They have been assuring that the funds will be released, but it has not been done so far, added the industry source. 

 The development comes at a time when the domestic textile industry is expanding and setting up fresh capacities after quotas were dismantled last year. Even some of the leading textile companies such as Raymond Ltd have opted for TUFS, as it has embarked on an aggressive expansion programme since the past couple of years. In the past, there have been representations from industry associations that as investments in the textile industry have been on the rise, allocation under TUFS should be increased. 

 Sources claim that as disbursement of interest compensation under TUFS did not take place over the past one year, many units, especially the smaller ones, are finding their finances coming under strain. 

 The TUFS, which has been popular with the industry, was in the news a few months ago when reports said it would be suspended. However, the Centre ruled out such a possibility. While it is expected to remain in operation until March 31, 2007, minister of state for textiles, E.V.K.S. Elangovan, told the Rajya Sabha in a written reply that the government has evaluated TUFS through KSA Technopak (India) Pvt Ltd. 

 Quoting the report, he said there has been an increase in productivity, reduction in cost, improvement in unit value realisation in domestic and export market apart from a rise in domestic/export turnover. 

 Elangovan also said that as on September 30, 5,649 applications have been sanctioned with a project cost of Rs 47,217 crore and amount sanctioned was Rs 20,273 crore and Rs 12,673 crore were disbursed in respect of 4,892 applications.

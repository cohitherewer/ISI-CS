 Calcutta, July 7: New Delhi-based Mankind Pharma Ltd is talking to an Italian firm and a Danish drug manufacturer for a possible joint venture.

 ?We are exploring both the options ? either to get exclusive licences to sell their products here or to set up a 50:50 joint venture for a manufacturing facility with any one of them,? said Mankind Pharma managing director R.C. Juneja.

 ?However, our emphasis is on setting up a separate joint venture company with a technical tie-up with the foreign partner for manufacturing lifestyle and neurological drugs,? he added.

 Though Juneja declined to divulge the name of the foreign companies, he said the deal would be finalised in the next 3-4 months.

 Eleven-year old Mankind Pharma has only one manufacturing facility in Gurgaon. It is setting up a Rs 30-crore greenfield manufacturing unit in Ponta Sahib in Himachal Pradesh.

 ?The facility will be ready to start operations from August,? Juneja said. As part of the tax incentives offered by the state government in the special industrial zone, sales tax, income tax and excise duty on drugs manufactured in the plant has been waived for 10 years, he added.

 Once the unit becomes operational, Mankind plans to shift its manufacturing activities from Gurgaon to the Poanta Sahib plant. ?The Gurgaon unit will be converted into a state-of-the-art research and development centre at an investment of Rs 35 crore,? Juneja said.

 The company also plans to enter the formulations export market and take up contact research and clinical trial assignments from next year.

 ?We will start a separate division by the end of this calendar year for marketing our asthma, opthalmic, dermatological and anti-malarial medicines,? Juneja said.

 Crucial SAIL role in Chiria compromise

 Give peace a chance

 New Delhi, Aug. 22: The Centre and the Jharkhand government are set to bury the hatchet over the lease right of SAIL on the Chiria mines in the state. The compromise formula will be contingent upon SAIL speeding up the development of Chiria and investing more in Jharkhand.

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is likely to reveal the contours of the deal later this month at Burnpur where he will kick off the expansion plans of IISCO, the SAIL subsidiary which held the Chiria lease that was transferred to the PSU after its takeover of IISCO. The final shape will emerge only in the first week of September after discussions among Jharkhand chief secretary Manoj Mondol, Union steel secretary R. S. Pandey and SAIL chairman S.K. Roongta. 

 Meanwhile, the Jharkhand government, which has challenged SAILs lease of Chiria at Ranchi High Court, today pleaded adjournment of the case till the middle of next month.

 Sources said SAIL has agreed to complete the development of Chiria within a shorter span and was likely to increase its investment at Bokaro Steel by 20 per cent to 30 per cent. The PSU had prepared a plan for Chiria, of five years, involving an investment at Bokaro Steel of Rs 6,000 plus Rs 2,000 crore in Chiria. If SAIL ups its investment spread, its investment in Jharkhand over the next three to four years could cross Rs 10,000 crore, the sources added.

 For the first time in India, SAIL will undertake beneficiation work at a mine site when it develops Chiria. Till now its washeries at various mines did some minor beneficiation work. The PSU plans to raise its ore output from 22 million tonnes (mt) a year to 29 mt and finally to 32 mt by 2012.

 It has submitted an environment assessment report to the Jharkhand State Pollution Board for a no objection certificate. Organisations like Mecon, NEERI and the Indian Bureau of Mines have prepared reports for the project.

 Chiria is a bone of contention between SAIL and the Jharkhand government which is keen to farm out part of the ore reserves to private sector majors such as the Tatas, Mittals and Ruias. 

 However, the state has been thwarted in its attempts by an appellate tribunal. 

 In the meantime, the PSU is pursuing a long-term plan of sufficiency in iron ore. Not only does it want to renew the lease on Chiria, but it is looking for reserves in other parts of the country.

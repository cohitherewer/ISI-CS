 i-flex to expand market reach 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, July 14: i-flex solutions will focus on Japan, Russia and the east European markets, as it seeks to expand the geographical footprint.

 We are expecting a lot of activity in Japan . The country has emerged from a lagging economy and is looking forward. There are lots of big financial institutions and banks that can still be our clients, Makarand Padalkar, chief of staff and investor relations told The Telegraph here today. The company has a presence in Japan already.

 Our prime focus will also be on Taiwan, Korea, The Philippines and Malaysia, he added.

 The company is keenly looking at the east European market. Bulgaria is an important country in this region and will be one of our focus areas. 

 A bulk of the licence fee for the company has come from western Europe. i-flex has offices in Germany, the UK and the Netherlands and plans to take care of the market through these offices.

 In most of these geographies the company will take a stepped approach. 

 First open a branch office and later scale it to a subsidiary depending on the business potential.

 In August last year, Oracle had announced an agreement to buy Citigroups 41 per cent equity in i-flex and on December 14 the transaction was completed. 

 i-flex continues to operate under the same management.

 easyJet flies high, profit jumps 56%

 Skys the limit

 London, Nov. 14 (Reuters): Low-cost airline easyJet posted a 56 per cent jump in annual profits as expected on Tuesday and said it would expand its fleet with more Airbus planes as strong demand offsets high fuel costs. 

 Shares in easyJet, Europes second-largest budget carrier after Ryanair, eased from Mondays record high to fall 0.2 per cent by 9:40 a.m. as the result received a mixed welcome from analysts.

 In the absence of any specific guidance for the current year the share price may succumb to some profit taking after the strong rise in recent weeks, but we believe that the long-term growth profile remains attractive, Cazenove analysts said in a client note. 

 Merrill Lynch analysts lowered their recommendation on the stock to neutral from buy. 

 EasyJet said pre-tax profit for the year to end-September 2006 was 129 million, up from 83 million a year ago. 

 The result was in line with analysts expectations of 130 million, according to the median of 15 forecasts from Reuters Estimates. 

 The result looked in line. It is encouraging that winter yields (average fares) look broadly in line with last year, which maintains our view that the yield environment remains very strong, Exane BNP Paribas analyst Geoff Van Klaveren said. 

 EasyJet converted options on 52 A319 aircraft into orders and took options over a further 75 A320 aircraft, bringing the value of planes it has on firm order to more than $4 billion (2.1 billion). 

 Chief executive Andy Harrison said the orders would underpin plans to expand capacity by 15 per cent this year. He said current trading was broadly in line with expectations and winter yields would be broadly in line with last year. 

 Our profit growth was driven by a 34 per cent increase in ancillary revenues per seat, significant improvements in passenger yields and a continuing reduction in our non-fuel unit costs, Harrison said in a statement. 

 Todays Airbus order underpins our future growth and we expect to increase capacity in 2007 by 15 per cent. 

 EasyJet said on October 6 it expected pre-tax profit for the year ending September to be slightly ahead of earlier guidance for a 40-50 per cent rise.

 Dell founder has full faith in CEO

 Sydney, Aug. 14 (Reuters): Dell Inc. founder Michael Dell said he had no plans to replace chief executive Kevin Rollins despite a sharp decline in the companys financial performance as rivals attack Dells hold on the low-priced computer market. 

 Dell has lowered results forecasts in three of the past four quarters as revenue growth slowed. 

 The latest announcement, on July 21, sent its shares down as much as 14 per cent, their biggest one-day loss in nearly six years and raised questions over Rollins future with the company. The stock closed at $21.07 on Friday. 

 If you look at the growth of the company during the last 10 years, he, along with myself and others, was largely responsible for that growth in success, said Dell, who started selling made-to-order computers from his University of Texas dormitory in 1984 after dismantling an Apple machine and rebuilding it. 

 Any suggestion (of Rollins leaving) is to fail to understand how our company works in terms of the shared leadership responsibilities that Kevin and I have, but also to fail to understand Kevins capabilities.

 Dell was speaking at a media briefing during a visit to Australia. 

 Rollins was named chief executive two years ago, succeeding Michael Dell in the job. He was previously the companys chief operating officer. 

 The Round Rock, Texas-based company, whose early success relied on selling inexpensive personal computers, is no longer counting on price alone to attract customers, Dell said. 

 The bulk of our business, 85 to 90 per cent, is to businesses and government institutions and those customers are really not buying on price, said Dell.

 Rival computer firms, including world No.2 manufacturer Hewlett-Packard Co., Asias Acer Computer International and Lenovo Group, have cut Dells price advantage with cheaper-priced units of their own. 

 We are going to stay competitive economically, yes. Our competitors may have done a little better, but would we trade our models for theirs no, Dell said.

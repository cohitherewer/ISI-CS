 Talks raise oil deal hope

 Raha: Upbeat

 New Delhi, March 10: ONGC-Videsh (OVL) is in the race for overseas oil and gasfields and exploration blocks worth over $15 billion.

 This was revealed by ONGC chairman Subir Raha on the sidelines of a roadshow for oil exploration blocks that are being offered under the sixth round of the new licensing policy.

 Raha refused to divulge further details as the negotiations are covered by a confidentiality clause.

 In yet another development, the Oil India-Indian Oil Corporation combine has acquired an oil exploration block in Gabon.

 Oil India director (finance) M.R. Pasricha said $12.5 million will be initially invested in the block. Oil India and Indian Oil would each have a 45 per cent participation interest and the remaining 10 per cent will be held by the government of Gabon.

 Pasricha said $50 million would be invested in the second phase to develop the block.

 The quest for foreign acquisitions in countries with proven reserves is part of a two-pronged strategy to increase energy security. At the same time, the latest technology needs to be adopted to strike oil and gas within the countries.

 Since oil exploration involves high cost and high risk, the petroleum ministry is keen on foreign companies undertaking projects in the country. Deep-sea exploration, where ONGC and Oil India do not have the latest technology, is one such area where foreign companies are being wooed.

 OVL has committed over $4.5 billion in 14 countries, including Australia, Cuba, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Ivory Coast, Libya, Myanmar, Nigeria, Qatar, Russia, Sudan, Syria and Vietnam. OVL is also eyeing Kazakhstan, Cuba, Venezuela, Brazil, Bangladesh, Kuwait, Sierra Leone, Uzbekistan and Yemen.

 Raha said ONGC-Mittal Energy Ltd, a joint venture with steel baron Lakshmi Mittal, was in talks for several acquisitions across the globe.

 ONGC had adequate finances, but would go in for market borrowing if the size of the acquisition was very large, he added.

 According to Raha, OVL had joined hands with Russian oil company Itera to acquire OAO Udmurtneft, a subsidiary of TNK-British Petroleum, which has licences to develop 26 fields in Russia.

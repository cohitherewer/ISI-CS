 India at stress mid-level amp; rising 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Feb. 19: More than half of Indias executives believe that stress at workplaces has grown over the past year ? and they have started to fret over the prospect of losing their jobs.

 As India grows at a robust 8 per cent and starts generating more jobs, theres a flip side to the story: 16 per cent of the executives polled in a Grant Thornton global study believe that stress levels have shot up significantly in India, while another 41 per cent believe that stress has risen in the past year.

 India isnt at the top of the stress stakes: that honour goes to Taiwan where 89 per cent of executives believe that stress has risen at the workplace. Its followed by mainland China where the number is 87 per cent.

 India seems to be a bit of middle-roader ? 15th on the stress chart ? and shuffling along pretty nicely with countries like Mexico (58 per cent), Russia (60 per cent) and Japan (60 per cent). But unheralded Botswana is experiencing a blow-out in stress levels with 74 per cent of executives reporting that the grind is getting a bit nerve-wracking.

 However, India is among the top three countries in the world ? after Japan and Thailand ? with most number of executives attributing that job insecurity is ratcheting up stress levels.

 According to the study, in Japan, Thailand and India, job insecurity contributes almost 50 per cent to the stress levels.

 Businessmen in countries like China, Greece, and Turkey are also highly stressed over job security. Worries about job security are greatest in dynamic, strong and expanding economies, says the report. The pace of change in the business community is more rapid than in more stable and matured economies like Australia, New Zealand, and European countries.

 Having a relatively stable business environment makes Singapore one of the less stressful countries.

 In case you are wondering how some nations keep their stress levels low, heres a clue ? take a holiday. Countries like Sweden, where just about 24 per cent of the businessmen felt stressed out, a combination of good holiday allowances and few worries over job security appear to add to the continued positive outlook, the study says.

 There appears to be a direct correlation between stress and the amount of holidays taken by the executives. According to the study, some of the most stressed executives are in Thailand which is at the bottom of the holiday table with just four days a year, followed by Taiwan with eight days, and Malaysia with 10. The Europeans holiday a lot and thus suffer from less stress.

 However, there is another side to the story. Travel can turn into trouble and double the stress when its business related.

 In India, 41 per cent of the high-flying executives are the most stressed out and feel that travel is one of the biggest contributors to stress levels. The Philippines with 22 per cent, Botswana with 21 per cent and Mainland China with 20 per cent are close behind. But most executives believe that travel is vital to the success of the business.

 But there are some who enjoy their travel. For example, 60 per cent of the Australian businessmen feel that travel causes negligible stress. The Netherlands (97 per cent), Poland, New Zealand and France (96 per cent each) feel less stressful due to business trips.

 Feeling totally stressed? Well, there is hope. If you want to work in a country with economic growth, high holidays and low stress, the options are New Zealand, the UK, Sweden, Argentina, Luxembourg or Canada.

 Calcutta, Dec. 7: If tech talk ruled the mind space at the conference venue of Infocom 2006, the latest tech tools were up for grabs at the 100,000-sq-ft-plus exhibition arena at the Helipad ground of Salt Lake stadium.

 People are trooping in huge numbers. We are expecting the footfall to increase over the weekend, said an organiser. The exhibition one of the biggest shows covering the ICT industry will continue till December 10.

 Not just tech tools, the exhibition arena has a number of attractions ranging from the latest innovations to business opportunities and job options to career counselling.

 The Innovation Hub displaying latest innovations from Intel, Brainwave Applications and Moser Baer was a hit. 

 Students flocked at the Edu Fair, where premier educational institutes from across the country displayed the courses on offer.

 My primary objective of coming to the fair was to find about courses in Masters in Business Administration offered by Bangalore-based colleges I got the information I was looking for, said Avijit Das, a B-Tech student.

 Career counselling, offered by experts at the Job Mart, was drawing most of the young people, students and fresh graduates.

 Over 15 companies like Dell, ICICI, Google and BOC will be interviewing and recruiting people from the Job Mart on December 9 and 10. We are offering career counselling by company executives regarding the nature of jobs and the required skill sets, said an organiser.

 Bourses shrug off slowdown fears

 This way or that

 The sharp fall in the market, as well as the equally spectacular rebound, point to the two contradictory factors that are pulling and pushing equity prices in opposite directions. 

 The initial trigger for the correction was the announcement by the central bank of a CRR hike. Its impact on the bottomlines of both banks and companies will be negligible, but the market rightly interpreted it as a signal that the RBI is intent on slowing the economy. But if the economy slows, so too will earnings growth and the markets should then crumble because they are priced for perfection. Yet the rebound indicates that the market isnt buying that logic.

 Could it be that the market doesnt believe therell be a slowdown in earnings growth? An analysis by the CII of the second-quarter results of 9,076 firms shows that profits after tax increased by 46.9 per cent compared with a rise of 24.2 per cent in the same quarter in 2005. Sales growth was 24.2 per cent compared with 22.2 per cent in the same period last year. Can this kind of growth be maintained? So far, higher sales growth has more than compensated for higher input costs. The concern is that with the central bank determined to dampen demand, sales growth could be more tepid in future. Also, as the CII said, The key reasons for an improvement in the performance of manufacturing is step-up in the efficiency of expenses on labour, fuel, other inputs and the non-operating items. In view of continuing upward pressure on inflation, the manufacturing sector is likely to witness moderation in growth rate in the next quarter. And further: Since the upward pressure on the interest rate remains unabated, the growth in PAT of the services sector may moderate further in future.

 The World Bank has said, Slower investment growth in response to tighter financial conditions and weaker consumer and government consumption are expected to contribute to a moderation of GDP growth to about 7.2 per cent over the forecast horizon 2008.

 The macro data for October hasnt been good either. Export growth has slowed and industrial production growth fell off the roof. The Purchasing Managers index for November shows that the rate of growth of both output and new orders has eased, while input price inflation has accelerated.

 But the contrary view is that, with salaries growing so fast, demand is not going to slow so easily. Also, investment demand too has picked up and is unlikely to be impacted unless interest rates climb much higher. Most analysts do not expect to see an earnings slowdown in the October-December quarter.

 Its interesting that the recent correction was the first one during the current bull run that hasnt been part of a global sell-off. The crash in May 2004, ostensibly triggered by the coming to power of a government dependent on the Left, was actually part and parcel of a worldwide sell-off in equities as the US started to raise interest rates. Similarly, the market declines in April 2005, October 2005 and in May this year were all global. The recent fall, however, has been purely local and FII inflows havent been affected.

 The continuation of FII inflows is an indication that liquidity continues to be abundant. The speed of the rebound is another indicator. While concerns about the fundamentals pull investors out, the weight of money pushes them back into the market. As long as the money keeps coming, the market will bounce back regardless of whether the economy is slowing. And liquidity depends on global factors. A purely local sell-off is, therefore, no reason for worry. No wonder there was a complete absence of panic among investors during the correction.

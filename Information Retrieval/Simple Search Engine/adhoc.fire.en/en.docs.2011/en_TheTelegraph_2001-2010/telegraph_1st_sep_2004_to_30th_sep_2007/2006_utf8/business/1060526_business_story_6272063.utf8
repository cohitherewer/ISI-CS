 i-flex bags prized deal

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, May 25: The winning streak continues for Indian software companies: i-flex Solutions has bagged the contract from Bank of America to install its core banking solution in six Asian countries. TCS, Infosys, Satyam were also in the running for the deal.

 We are finalising a multi-million dollar deal with i-flex for its core banking software solution Flexcube to be implemented in six countries in Asia in two phases, Michael KM Leung, senior vice-president and chief information officer, Bank of America (Asia) Ltd said here today. He was attending a MarcusEvans Banknet seminar. 

 Flexcube will first be implemented in China, Hong Kong and Macau, Leung said. In the second phase we will cover the other countries, he said. 

 Leung, however, kept under wraps the size of the deal. He also did not divulge the names of the countries where Flexcube will be implemented in the second phase. 

 The BoA deal will enable i-flex to log into China, where it has a marginal presence. 

 BoA has been working with Fiserve, a core banking solution from an US-based company, in Asia for more than a decade. It was time for us to replace the product with a newer product. We have been looking globally and the Indian companies emerged as the strongest competitors in this space, Leung said. 

 BoA is also searching for an integrated solution provider for its investment products such as mutual funds and equities. 

 We are in talks with quite a few Indian IT companies to provide us an integrated solution for various investment products. Right now, we have different solutions for different products, Leung said. 

 He lauded Indian companies for winning a number of big-ticket contracts from US multinationals. Leung added that Indian vendors are also charging more for their services.

 i-flex was brought over by Oracle last year, which picked up 41 per cent stake in the company. The management of the company has remained unchanged.

 The company warned a net profit of Rs 140 crore for the quarter ended March 31, an increase of 159 per cent from the corresponding period of the previous year. The full year revenue increased 30 per cent to Rs 1483.5 crore. Net income for year was up 8 per cent at Rs 219 crore.

Calcutta, Dec. 6: Amid the debate over acquisition of farmland to set up factories and townships, the apex body of IT and IT-enabled services (ITeS) industry came up with its suggestion for an amicable resolution on the contentious issue.

 Antagonising the farmers will not help. So, efforts should be made to make them stakeholders in these projects and give them their due share, said B. Ramalinga Raju, chairman, Nasscom, while addressing a press conference on the sidelines of Infocom 2006, organised by Nasscom and Businessworld, an ABP Group publication.

 The Nasscom suggestion comes in the wake of allegations from the farming community that projects on their land are sold at a premium, but they are not getting a fair price. So, the crux of the idea is exploring options so that farmers can benefit from the price appreciation of the projects. As an example, Raju said the government could consider issuing shares of the projects built on farmers land to make them stakeholders.

 We are using the existing infrastructure to the hilt. So, we need new townships to come up without any delay. From Nasscom, we are willing to partner with the government to explore other such options and work out a formula that is feasible and also acceptable, added Raju, who is also the chairman of Satyam Computers. 

 While Nasscom tried to diffuse one debate, it took a definite stand on the other big debate on the need for unions in the IT and ITeS sector. Last month, West Bengal IT Services Association with support from CPM labour wing, Citu was formally launched in the states IT hub at the Salt Lake Electronics Complex.

 Unions are not relevant in these industries as the employers themselves are taking care of the employees. Besides meeting all the standards, the companies are even doing a few things extra for the employees, said Kiran Karnik, president, Nasscom. 

 Nasscoms denial for any unions in the IT and ITeS industry is triggered by the fear of disruptive activities like strikes. Karnik complimented the people of the state for ignoring SUCIs bandh call on Tuesday and demanded a similar disruption-free environment on December 14.

 Eight days ahead of the Citu-sponsored general strike, which the Left parties are supporting, Karnik said, The recent growth of the IT industry in the state is primarily because of confidence on Bengal. If the image takes a beating because of some disruptions, the state will suffer. 

 From the Infocom 2006 platform, Bengal IT minister Debesh Das said the state government would try to ensure that there was no enforcement of strike on people willing to work. 

 If the government can ensure that, it will send the right signals to the world, said the Nasscom president, bullish about a brighter future for the sunrise industry in Bengal. To facilitate the fledgling IT and ITeS industry in Bengal, Nasscom is planning to set up a regional office in Calcutta early next year.

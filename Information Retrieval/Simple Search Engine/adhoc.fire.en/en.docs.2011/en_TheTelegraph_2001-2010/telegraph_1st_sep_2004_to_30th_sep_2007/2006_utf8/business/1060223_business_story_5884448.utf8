 Ingolstadt, Germany, Feb. 22 (Reuters): Volkswagens premium unit Audi AG has further lowered its risk resulting from euro-dollar exchange rates, its finance chief said on Wednesday. For this year, there is actually no risk (from currency effects), that matches with our hedging rate, Rupert Stadler said in an interview following the companys annual press conference.

 Stadler said the group had hedged its dollar exposure to 80-90 per cent for 2006 and to roughly 50 per cent for 2007.

 A dollar rate of 1.30 to the euro in 2006 would not worry me at all, he added.

 Over the past three years, Audi said it had successfully compensated for adverse currency effects amounting to around 800 million euros.

 Audis single largest export market is the US, where it delivered 6.6 per cent more cars last year for a total of 83,066 units, or roughly 10 per cent of overall global brand sales. But Audi also does business in dollars in South America and Russia, for example.

 Stadler was also not concerned by the high steel and oil prices, which have increased input costs across the automotive and supplier industry.

 We havent complained about it...As far as steel prices, raw material prices are concerned, we had that under control in 2005 and I expect that we will manage to have a reasonable development in 2006, he continued.

 He expects Audi brand deliveries to grow by some 6 per cent this year, roughly the same level as in 2005. I am confident overall, January was an excellent month. We want to grow further, and well succeed as far as vehicle sales and revenue and we hope that we will also succeed in terms of earnings, he said.

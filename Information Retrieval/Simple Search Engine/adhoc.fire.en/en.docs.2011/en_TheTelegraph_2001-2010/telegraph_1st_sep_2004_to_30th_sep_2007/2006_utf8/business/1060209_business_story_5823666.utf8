 New York, Feb. 8: Pfizer has said it will explore spinning off or selling its consumer health care division, a unit that had $3.9 billion in sales last year and whose brands include Listerine mouthwash and Benadryl allergy medicine.

 Pfizer, the worlds largest drugmaker, has taken several steps recently to bolster its flagging stock, including raising its dividend and trying to streamline its operations. Spinning off the consumer unit would be another step to please Wall Street, because investors view the division as outside Pfizers core business of prescription drugs, analysts said.

 The unit accounted for less than 8 per cent of Pfizers $52 billion in sales last year, and about 4 per cent of the operating profit. Based on the price-sales and price-earnings multiples of other consumer products companies, the division could be worth $8 billion or more as an independent company. Pfizer did not disclose whether it expected to lay off any of the divisions 3500 employees as part of a sale.

 Its at the margin, said Robert Hazlett, an analyst at SunTrust Robertson Humphrey. Its $3 billion and change of a $50 billion company, so its not inconsequential, but is it critical to the growth of the company going forward? No.

 Besides Listerine and Benadryl, the units other well-known brands include Rogaine, Zantac, Rolaids, Bengay and Lubriderm. The unit has nine brands with more than $100 million in annual sales, according to Pfizer.

 Pfizer made the announcement on Tuesday afternoon, after the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange. In after-hours trading, Pfizer shares rose almost 46 cents, or 1.8 per cent, to $25.64.

 In a statement, Pfizer said it wanted to unlock the value of the business for Pfizer shareholders at a time when market valuations are attractive for large, high-quality consumer businesses. Pfizer said it had not yet committed itself to selling the unit and could still decide to retain it. But a sale is probable after Tuesdays announcement.

 The division had $670 million in operating profit last year, Pfizer said. Its sales grew 10 per cent in 2005, to $3.9 billion from $3.5 billion. At a multiple of two times its sales last year, the unit would be worth about $8 billion. At a more aggressive multiple, like 2.5 times sales or 15 times operating profit, it could be worth $10 billion.

 Move to lift voting cap in private banks

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 18: The government is considering removing the current 10 per cent ceiling on voting rights for foreign investors in private banks. However, it will take such a step only after reaching a consensus with the Left parties and other allies.

 We expect to sort out differences with our friends who hold reservations on the bill, said P.K. Bansal, minister of state for finance, on the sidelines of the release of an Assocham study on consolidation of Indian banks restructuring for global expansion.

 Bansal said since foreign direct investment (FDI) of up to 74 per cent was allowed in private banks, it did not make sense to keep the voting rights at a maximum of 10 per cent.

 The Left parties have been opposing the amendment to the Banking Regulation Act of 1949, stating that removal of voting rights in private banks would lead to a takeover of these outfits by foreign players.

 The minister said as the Left parties gave their consent to the Banking Companies and Financial Institutions Law (Amendment) Bill, a common ground would be found in the Banking Regulation Act (Amendment) Bill as well.

 In the wake of the changing scenario in the banking sector, the new bill would pave the way for consolidation in Indian private banks and also lead to setting up subsidiaries of foreign banks, added Bansal.

 The minister said consolidation was necessary to facilitate larger access to institutional credit by masses as currently only 27 per cent people have access to banking finance.

 The bill, which would be re-introduced in the winter session of Parliament, had earlier been placed in the Lok Sabha in May 2005, but was referred to a parliamentary standing committee.

 The move, however, would not alter voting rights in public sector banks since the government-owned banks are governed by the provisions of Banking Companies (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertakings) Act, 1970 and 1980 and the SBI Act, 1955 and SBI (Subsidiary Banks) Act, 1959.

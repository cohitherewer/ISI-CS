 BoE keeps rates steady

 Money matters

 London, July 6 (Reuters): The Bank of England left interest rates at 4.5 per cent on Thursday for the 11th month running, and so far appears to be in no hurry to change policy.

 Although analysts do not expect any other result this month, some have predicted a quarter point rate rise by the end of the year ? perhaps even in August ? as inflation is running above the banks 2 per cent target.

 Minutes of last months monetary policy committee (MPC) meeting, however, showed policymakers fretting that sharp losses on world bourses in May could be the start of a much bigger rout.

 Governor Mervyn King has also said the inflation outlook faced risks on both sides and the MPC had to keep a close eye on the data.

 The mixed news on the economy and the latest signals from the MPC suggest that there is no great urgency to tighten policy, said Jonathan Loynes, chief UK economist at Capital Economics.

 Financial markets showed no reaction to a fully expected decision. Instead, they waited for the European Central Banks rate verdict and the signals that will accompany it.

 Some analysts said upward revisions to economic growth over the last few years could trigger concern that the economy is operating at close to full capacity and that inflationary pressures would pick up without higher borrowing costs.

 Data earlier on Thursday showed manufacturing output rising faster than expected but Britains biggest mortgage lender, the Halifax, said house prices fell 1.2 per cent in June, underlining that a broad-based consumer recovery cannot be taken for granted.

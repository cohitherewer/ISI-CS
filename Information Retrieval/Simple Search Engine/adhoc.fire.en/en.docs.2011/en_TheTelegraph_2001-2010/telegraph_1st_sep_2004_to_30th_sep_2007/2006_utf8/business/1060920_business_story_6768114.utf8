 Bangalore, Sept. 19 (PTI): United Breweries Ltd (UBL), Indias largest spirits company, will invest Rs 400 crore to expand production capacity, foray into the Chinese market and launch Kingfisher Wine, its chairman Vijay Mallya said today.

 He said Rs 400 crore will be invested in a phased manner over the next three years to build and expand capacities in different parts of India, including Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Orissa and Andhra Pradesh. The investment will scale up the capacities of the company by 50 per cent, he added. 

 The plan envisages setting up greenfield breweries and augmenting capacity and technology at existing sites, said Mallya. He said the UB Group is all set to start operations in China. 

 I have given instructions to United Spirits to open an office (for marketing initially) in Shanghai immediately. I have identified the executive who will be transferred there to kickstart the business, he said.

 All we know is there is a market for our products (in China). I have walked around retail shops and bars there. Our range can fit in quite nicely, Mallya said. 

 He said the company would launch Kingfisher Wine in six months. He also said that Kingfisher Ultra, which will be pitched directly against foreign brands, would be launched in the Indian market.

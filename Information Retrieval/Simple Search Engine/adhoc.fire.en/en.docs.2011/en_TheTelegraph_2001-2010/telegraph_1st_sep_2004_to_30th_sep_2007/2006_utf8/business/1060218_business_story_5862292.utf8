 Texas Power draws up $10-bn plan

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Feb. 17: Over a decade after US energy trader Enron Corp first entered India for the Dabhol power plant, another Houston-based company, Texas Power Generation LLC, today announced ambitious plans to invest up to $10 billion in the next 10 years for setting up power plants in the country.

 To start with, Texas Power has signed an MoU with the Chhattisgarh government for a 1600-mw coal-fired plant in the state at an investment of about Rs 5,000 crore. It has also applied for a mining block to the coal ministry which, if allotted, would require an investment of another Rs 2,000 crore.

 It has hired L amp;T to prepare a detailed feasibility project report for the coal-fired power plant.

 The project is being set up with a debt-equity ratio of 70:30. The company will invest $400 million (about Rs 1,800 crore) as equity entirely through internal accruals.

 The debt will be arranged from US, Europe and West Asia, said chairman V.K. Jain. Private investments as well as bank funds will be raised to finance the project.

 Texas Power expects to award the engineering project contract for the 1600-mw project by September so that construction work can start in early 2007, Jain said.

 The capacity of the plant has been raised to 1600 mw from 1320 mw planned initially, as the company will implement the latest super critical boiler technology, he added. It would later be expanded to over 3,000 mw. The project is expected to be completed by the end of 2010.

 Texas Power will float global tenders for sourcing of equipment for the plant. It will look at the latest technology from firms like Alstom, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Bechtel.

 Jain said the cost of generating power would work out to around Rs 1.70 per unit and it would be sold to Power Trading Corporation of India at around Rs 2.15 per unit. The company has signed a memorandum of understanding with PTC for 25 years for the lifting of power, he added.

 Players on toes for scorecards

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Jan. 3: The countdown for the earnings season has begun with Reliance Industries and Infosys Technologies ready to record their third-quarter performance next week.

 While the Reliance board will consider the companys third quarter results on January 10, the board of Infosys will meet on the following day.

 The stock market is on a high and investors are building up positions on hopes of robust quarterly numbers. The numbers will determine fund flows into domestic equities and into the markets as a whole.

 The quarterly numbers will be watched carefully. The expectation is that the companies will not disappoint. However, if the numbers are below estimates, then the equity markets will suffer, an analyst said.

 For Reliance Industries, which is in the middle of a demerger, the expectation is that since the petrochemical cycle is now on an upswing, the company should post a strong topline and bottomline growth. 

 Reliance has posted a turnover of Rs 42,777 crore in the first half of this fiscal, which represented a gain of 27 per cent over Rs 33,610 crore in the corresponding previous period. 

 Similarly, net profit during the period rose 50 per cent to Rs 4,791 crore against Rs 3,189 crore.

 Analysts say during the second half, firm crude oil rates have forced the company to raise its product prices frequently. 

 In the second quarter, the growth in topline came from an increase in product prices of 23 per cent and an increase in sales volume of 4 per cent. 

 On the petrochemical front, Reliance should put in a good performance, though its gross refining margins remains to be seen, an analyst added.

 If Reliance Industries gains from a rise in product prices, the Bangalore-based Infosys is also expected to revise its guidance for the year. 

 Observers are bullish that the company will beat its own estimates as the dollar has appreciated against the Indian currency during the third quarter.

 While announcing the second quarter results, Infosys had said that it expected income to be between Rs 2,443 crore and Rs 2,452 crore for the quarter.

 Fertiliser plan stuck in subsidy muck

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 Wait and watch

 New Delhi, Aug. 2: The subsidy consequences of the draft fertiliser policy have spoiled all government calculations on deficit. It is feared that on adoption of the policy the subsidy bill will balloon upwards to nearly Rs 30,000 crore from the budgeted Rs 17,252 crore for 2006-07.

 The disastrous impact on government finances has dawned on the cabinet committee on economic affairs (CCEA) which decided to put the policy on hold last week, much to the consternation of the industry and farm lobby.

 Though mum before the media, the CCEA has asked the cabinet secretary to form a committee of secretaries to solve this problem.

 Fertiliser production has a substantial subsidy component as costs in the range of Rs 5,000-21,000 a tonne far outweighs the sale price of Rs 4,830 a tonne. The cost is around Rs 20,000 if naphtha is used as fuel, Rs 12,000 in case of fuel oil and around Rs 6,000 for natural gas.

 The subsidy blast last year was strong enough to cross the budget estimate of Rs 17,250 crore by as much as Rs 6,000 crore. The government has promised it will make good the gap this year.

 To slim down on subsidies a possible option is import, though this has a chequered past in the form of scams during the Narasimha Rao regime. The import cost is Rs 12,000-13,000 a tonne, flattening the subsidy bill to around Rs 7,000-8,000 a tonne.

 Another option is a flat rate for all manufacturers. Not only are disbursements reduced, there are less chances of companies goldplating production figures to corner a larger chunk of subsidy.

 This strategy will raise urea prices if input costs go up. A section of government officials believe such costs can fall as well, turning the issue into one of adaptability of Indian farmers to cyclical trends, as has been done by farmers elsewhere. 

 Besides, farmers will reduce their dependence on urea which will improve the soil ecology.

 However, earlier attempts at rationalising prices had generated strong protests from farmers. With the farm sector going through a crisis, there are very few chances of this route being adopted. 

 The most preferred option is to switch over to natural gas, which is the cheapest feedstock available to the industry. However, officials said limited availability of natural gas makes this an unattractive proposition.

 Clearly, the committee of secretaries has a difficult task at hand as it has been given just two weeks to find a solution to an apparently intractable problem that has strong political and social undertones.

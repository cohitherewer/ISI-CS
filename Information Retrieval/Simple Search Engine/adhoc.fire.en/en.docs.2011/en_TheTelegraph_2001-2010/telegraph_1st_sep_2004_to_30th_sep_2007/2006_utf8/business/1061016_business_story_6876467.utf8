 Q amp;A

 The rule book

 I am a retired person. My total annual income is about Rs 1,50,000. I have no investment for tax relief under section 80C. The finance ministry notification says that tax would be deducted at source in Senior Citizen Savings Scheme. May I submit form 15F for non-deduction of tax at source? I attained 65 years of age this month. Do I have to submit income tax returns for the assessment year 2007-08?

 Narayan Bagchi, Calcutta

 You will have to submit Form 15H, and not Form 15F, with the bank or post office with which you have the Senior Citizen Savings Scheme account for claiming non-deduction of tax at source. You will not have to file income tax returns for assessment year 2007-08. However, remember that filing income returns is voluntary even for persons who have an annual income below the threshold limit.

 Deduction details

 Do savings in the post office monthly income scheme, fixed deposits for five years or more in scheduled banks and savings in Senior Citizen Savings Scheme qualify for deduction under section 80C? Is the interest received in the succeeding years taxable on an annual basis or at the time of maturity?

 S.K. Das, Calcutta

 g all those schemes that you have mentioned, only bank fixed deposits for five years or more is entitled to tax benefit under section 80C of the income tax act. However, this benefit is available only on special tax-saving fixed deposits of banks not all fixed deposits for five years or more. You can show your accrued interest income every year as other income in your return for calculating tax liability and simultaneously claim a deduction under section 80C on reinvestment of the interest. This way, you dont have to pay any tax on maturity, except for the interest amount accruing in the maturity year of the investment.

 Capital gains bond

 I had bought a piece of land several years ago for Rs 25,000 and sold it in June this year for Rs 3,50,000. I am not in a position to invest the same in purchasing a house. Where do I invest the sale proceeds to avoid tax payment?

 Anju Sinha, Calcutta

 You can invest the sale proceeds in capital gains bonds of Rural Electrification Corporation or National Highway Authority of India.

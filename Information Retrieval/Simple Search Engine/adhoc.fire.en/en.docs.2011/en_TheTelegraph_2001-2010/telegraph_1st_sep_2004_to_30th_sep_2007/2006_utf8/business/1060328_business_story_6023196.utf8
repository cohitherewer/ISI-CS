 Concern over cyber crime deepens

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 27: Infotech executives perceive cyber crime as a greater threat to their businesses than physical crime. They are becoming increasingly wary of corporate security threats from within their organisations, says a recent IBM survey.

 Sixty-seven per cent of local IT executives who took part in the survey perceived cyber crime as more costly compared with the global benchmark of 58 per cent.

 Cyber crime results in a loss of revenue, market capitalisation, current customers and damage a brand name, the executives said.

 Indian firms (75 per cent versus 72 per cent of global businesses) felt that loss of revenue ranks as the highest key cost associated with cyber crime followed by loss of market capitalisation.

 Other costs for Indian businesses, as identified by the respondents to the survey, include damage to their brand/reputation (65 per cent); loss of current customers (64 per cent); loss of employee productivity (60 per cent); loss of prospective customers (57 per cent); and the cost of restoring service (53 per cent).

 The global survey, conducted among more than 3000 chief information officers, include 150 respondents from India. The respondents were drawn from the healthcare, financial, retail and manufacturing sectors.

 The report also says the threat of cyber crime comes from new areas that companies need to watch out for.

 Ninety-one per cent of Indian IT executives compared with 84 per cent of their global counterparts believe that organised groups with technical sophistication are replacing lone hackers in the world of cyber crime.

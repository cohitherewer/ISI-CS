 Bharat Petro in hunt for outlet sites

 Eyeing for more

 Mumbai, May 29: Petroleum major Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) is hunting for approximately 250 sites in the country to set up petrol pumps, including retail outlets, over the next four to five years. 

 Market sources say the company could be looking at spending close to Rs 2 crore per site and Rs 4 crore on development of the pump and/or retail outlet within the pump per site. 

 There is no embargo on the number of petrol pumps that we can have now, and there are no restrictions on us. We can decide and go ahead with our plans now, but we will always be looking at high volumes and good locations, reliable sources from the company said. 

 BPCL has close to 6,900 petrol pumps all over the country at the moment, up from 4,000 in 2002-03.

 The government recently lifted a freeze it had put on setting up of petrol pumps by public sector oil companies. The oil ministry had earlier put a temporary freeze on expansion of physical network by the oil marketing companies as it found that a mushrooming petrol pumps network was turning many of them sick. 

 The government had asked the public sector oil companies to do an economic analysis of the present retail network. After the lifting of the embargo, the oil companies are free to set up pumps across the country, and they are not letting go of this opportunity. 

 Most petrol pumps today also have a mall or convenience outlet to encourage customers to not just fill up fuel but also buy grocery or pick up a meal or two. It forms part of the oil companys non-fuel business. 

 BPCL has introduced the mall concept at select markets as part of their non-fuel business. Called In amp; Out, these malls offer the customer facilities and brands to choose from. Their convenience store under the brand name Bazaar also operates in select markets.

 In its results announced recently, BPCL has reported a more than three times rise in net profit for the fourth quarter of 2005-06 at Rs 1,788.3 crore against Rs 351.4 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous year. Net sales were up 33.51 per cent at Rs 21,318.8 crore (Rs 15,968.1 crore).

 For the full fiscal, the refining company showed 86.56 per cent decline in net profit at Rs 129.8 crore from Rs 965.8 crore, despite 22.76 per cent increase in net sales to Rs 72,395.6 crore from Rs 58,970 crore.

 BPCL had reported loss in the first three quarters of fiscal 2006. Financial results of the year have been adversely affected on account of high crude oil and product purchase prices, the company said.

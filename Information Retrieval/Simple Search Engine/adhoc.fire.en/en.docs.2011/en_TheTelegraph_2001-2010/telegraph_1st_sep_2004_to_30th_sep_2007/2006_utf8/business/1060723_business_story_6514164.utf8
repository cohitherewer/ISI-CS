 Bhubaneswar, July 22: Bhushan Steel plans to hike its capacity from 3.1 million tonnes to 9 million tonnes at its Meramundli plant in Dhenkanal district.

 We have informed the government about the need for another 3,500 acres of land for expansion, the chairman said. 

 The group will invest Rs 15,000 crore for the project. It has already committed Rs 6,000 crore in an agreement with the state government, which was signed on November 3, 2005.

 Singhal said the companys Meramundali plant will begin its first phase of production in January 2008. 

 We will produce about 0.5 million tonnes of hot-rolled coil in the first phase, he said.

 Singhal was positive about the expansion getting adequate funding.

 Since this is a brownfield project, funding shouldnt be a problem, he added.

 The managing director said the hitches regarding displacement have been sorted out.

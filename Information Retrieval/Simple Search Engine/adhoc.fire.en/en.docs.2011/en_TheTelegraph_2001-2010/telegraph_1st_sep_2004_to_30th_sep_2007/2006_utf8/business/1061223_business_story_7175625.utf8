 Indian actors shield cards

 Mumbai/New Delhi, Dec. 22: The Indian protagonists in the latest telecom buyout drama chose to hold their hand and remain silent as they digested news of Vodafones formal entry into the fray.

 There was a frisson of excitement after Vodafones announcement with strong rumours that Anil Ambanis Reliance Communications (R-com)would also confirm speculation and ruff Arun Sarins bid with a $17-billion bid for the whole caboodle.

 Sources in the Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group (ADAG) rubbished the rumour that the bid would be made today, by 6 pm London time. No one was quite sure about the significance of the place and the time since it would be the witching hour in both Hong Kong and Mumbai.

 Observers expect ADAG to launch a formal bid in association with private equity firm Blackstone within a day. Reports about an ADAG-Blackstone bid first surfaced two weeks ago, but there have been no details.

 However, there has been a lot of behind-the-scenes activity with Amitabh Jhunjhunwala, regarded as the financial whiz within the group, donning the responsibility of tying up funds and interacting with senior Hutchison officials. Unconfirmed reports say he visited Hong Kong last week and informally told senior Hutch officials that R-com was interested.

 In Delhi, Sunil Bharti Mittal was equally reticent about whether or not he would waive the non-compete clause in the agreement under which Vodafone picked up a 10 per cent stake in Bharti Airtel. The agreement prohibits Vodafone from competing in the same market for one year after selling its shares in Bharti. 

 The Bharti spokesperson said: Vodafone, which controls nearly 10 per cent stake, has informed Bharti it may make an offer for a controlling stake in Hutchison Essar. Bharti awaits further developments before taking any decisions on the non-compete clause.

 Technically, Vodafone has the option of retaining its 10 per cent in Airtel and acquiring Hutch Essar. However, telecom industry sources feel Mittal would be averse to a three-cornered relationship. Industry sources say Vodafone has started exploring the possibility of selling its 10 per cent stake in Bharti Airtel. It bought the stake in 2005 for about Rs 6,500 crore.

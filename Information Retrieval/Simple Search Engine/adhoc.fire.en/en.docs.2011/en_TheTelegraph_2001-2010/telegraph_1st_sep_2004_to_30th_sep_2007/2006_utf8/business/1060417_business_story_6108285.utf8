 Maruti to shift export gears

 GARIMA SINGH

 New Delhi, April 16: Maruti Udyog Ltd, the countrys leading carmaker, is looking at new markets to ramp up its exports that declined by nearly 30 per cent in 2005-06.

 Rival Hyundai Motors India has exported 1.02 lakh cars in 2005-06, almost three times Marutis exports of 34,781. The company exported 48,899 cars in 2004-05.

 According to S. Nakanishi, chairman, MUL, the company will focus on countries like Sri Lanka, Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore.

 Stating that Maruti will beef up its overseas business, he said, Demand is growing in Europe and we are looking at exploring new markets.

 By 2008-09, we would like to enhance exports as much as possible, Nakanishi said adding that the fall in exports was mainly due to a decline in demand for its export model, the Alto, in European markets.

 The demand in Europe has gone down and we will make an effort to sell the model in other regions where right-hand drive cars are used, he said. 

 Senior Maruti officials said the company had to manufacture the best-selling Swift at the existing plant to meet the domestic demand. 

 Hence, we had strategically planned low exports for last fiscal, they added.

 Talking about the companys proposed models in the Indian market, Nakanishi said Maruti would bank on the Swift platform for that. We would like to utilise the Swift platform as much as possible.

 He, however, refused to comment on whether the company would introduce a sedan version of its popular hatchback.

 Recently, Maruti had announced that it would buy out Suzuki in its joint venture, Maruti Suzuki Automobile India Limited, which is setting up a second car manufacturing facility in Haryana. 

 Later on, MUL will merge the company with itself to synergise operations and management.

 The company expects production levels to cross 8,00,000 cars by 2008-09, including the capacity from the new facility.

 Orissa in brand push

 PRABUDDHA S. JAGADEB

 Bhubaneswar, April 2: The state government is going ahead with its plan of branding the current industrial resurgence Team Orissa.

 The Team Orissa brand will be used to promote the state during roadshows abroad to attract foreign direct investments.

 Industry secretary Gokul Chandra Pati said the brand would initially be used by the industry department and the Industrial Promotion and Investment Corporation Ltd (Ipicol), the industry promotion arm of the government. This is a symbol, which has been devised to help investors readily recall the state, said Pati.

 The state industry department plans to organise roadshows overseas. But we are yet to decide where to start, Pati said. 

 Chief minister Navin Patnaik is believed to have approved the logo and the design of Team Orissa. The promotion is expected to be launched in a week or two.

 Ipicol general manager B.N. Palai said his agency has started a single-window service at Bhubaneswar and is currently dealing with 31 firms that have signed MoUs with the state government. 

 Under the scheme, there are deadlines between seven and 120 days for obtaining clearances from all the departments concerned so that the projects get off the ground fast, Palai added.

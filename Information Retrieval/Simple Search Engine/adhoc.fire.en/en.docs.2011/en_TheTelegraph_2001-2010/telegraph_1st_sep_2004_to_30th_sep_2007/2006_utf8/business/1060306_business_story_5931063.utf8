 Tax tweak traps hybrid mutuals

 CHANDRALEKHA TULAL 

 Mumbai, March 5: The change in the definition of equity-oriented mutual funds will put the skids on hybrid funds as they will now end up paying the 12.5 per cent dividend distribution tax. Worse, the investors in these hybrid funds will now also have to pay both short-term and long-term capital gains tax.

 Earlier, only closed-ended mutual funds were exempt from paying the dividend distribution tax. But this year, finance minister P. Chidambaram extended the tax waiver to open-ended mutual funds as well but then came up with a rider that has completely changed the lie of the mutual landscape.

 For tax purposes, the equity-oriented mutual funds were governed by the definition given in the income tax act. Under this, all mutual funds that invested more than 50 per cent of their assets in equities were treated as equity mutuals. Chidambaram has now decided to align the taxmans definition with the one spawned by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi). Ergo, only those funds that invest more than 65 per cent in equities will henceforth be treated as equity-oriented mutual funds and, thereby, enjoy the tax break on dividend distribution. The percentage allocation of assets is calculated as the annual average of monthly averages. 

 The effective dividend distribution tax adds up to 14.025 per cent after adding the 10 per cent surcharge and 2 per cent education cess. While for equity-oriented funds, short-term capital gains tax is at 10 per cent, for other schemes, it is at the marginal tax rate of the individual. 

 The long-term capital gains tax is exempted for equity-oriented funds but is taxed at 20 per cent (with indexation benefit) or at 10 per cent, whichever is less for other schemes. 

 According to Value Research, 18 of the 28 hybrid equity-oriented funds are likely to lose their tax status as their 12-month average allocation to equity was less than 65 per cent on January 31. The amended definition will be effective from June 1. The list includes Birla Asset Allocation Moderate, Sundaram Balanced, Principal Child Benefit, HDFC Childrens Gift, UTI Balanced, HDFC Prudence and Magnum Balanced fund. 

 So, what will these fund houses do now? 

 Association of Mutual Funds of India chairman A. P. Kurien dismisses the possibility of any change in the Sebi definition of equity-oriented mutual funds. The fund houses have the option to change their investment mandate and increase the equity allocation to 65 per cent, says Kurien. 

 We will not change the mandate due to a change in tax incidence of such schemes, said Sanjay Sinha of SBI Mutual Fund.

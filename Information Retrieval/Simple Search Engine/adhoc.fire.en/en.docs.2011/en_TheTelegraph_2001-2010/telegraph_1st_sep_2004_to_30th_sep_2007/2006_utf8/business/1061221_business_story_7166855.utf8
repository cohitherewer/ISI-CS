 ITC Info to make room for hotel in campus

 SOHINI MOOKHERJEA

 Calcutta, Dec. 20: ITC Infotech Indias 50-acre campus, which is being planned in the city, could house an ITC brand hotel, besides a development and training centre.

 ITC Infotech India, the 100 per cent subsidiary of the ITC Group and a $64-million company, provides integrated IT and IT-enabled services solutions. The company was set up in 2000 and has a CAGR of 85 per cent over the last five years.

 The company has offices in New Jersey and San Jose in the US, Milton Keynes in the UK, Czech Republic, Malaysia, and in Calcutta and Bangalore in India.

 Our campus is usually designed to make it environment friendly. We currently operate out of the parent groups office in Calcutta and this would be our second campus after Bangalore. The hotel would cater to our global clientele and is likely to be on the lines of a business hotel. The hotel brand would depend on the area allotted, said a company representative.

 This multidimensional park would be the first of its kind in the city with such integrated facilities.

 ITC Infotech had asked for five acres and was shown plots in Rajerhat. It, however, chose to wait for more viable options because of the prevailing high prices in Rajerhat.

 An IT department source said the company has been informed about the plans for Rajerhat Infocity opposite Vedic Village, 10 km from the airport.

 But the land acquisition and handover by West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation (WBIDC) would take a minimum of six months. Out of the 830 acres to be acquired, around 330 acres would be for the IT park where the government plans to give land not only to ITC Infotech but to Wipro and Infosys.

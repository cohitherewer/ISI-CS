 Yahoos new ad campaign

 Fresh look

 San Francisco, Sept. 18 (Reuters): Yahoo Inc plans a new integrated marketing campaign in the US and overseas markets that includes television, radio, cinema and online advertising, the Internet media company said on Monday.

 The multimillion-dollar campaign highlights the makeover Yahoo has given its heavily visited home page and other services from its e-mail program to Yahoo Answers, a new service that taps the wisdom of other Yahoo users.

 The advertising, which will be featured on TV, radio, online and in movie theatres, takes a humourous look at life with and without the benefits of Yahoo services.

 Its the broadest marketing push the Sunnyvale, California-based company has made in two years, said Allen Olivo, Yahoos vice-president of global brand marketing.

 Rather than TV or radio, online ads are the main marketing avenue for Yahoo, the worlds biggest Web advertising company.

 We look at them (TV and radio) as exclamation marks to the online marketing, rather than the main marketing, Olivo said in an interview. The campaign features ads created by Yahoo users from several film schools.

 There is also a Dunkin Donuts iced coffee giveaway for Yahoo visitors on Friday, September 22. Consumers who visit the Yahoo home page and print out a one-day coupon qualify for the free coffee promotion at the US fast-food franchise.

 The US television spots, which were produced with Soho Square and OgilvyOne Worldwide, will begin on prime-time TV on Thursday, September 21. They will air on professional baseball games, MTV and late-night comedy shows.

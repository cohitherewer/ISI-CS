 Tribunal endorses Sebi bar on Jermyn

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Sept. 6: The Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) has dismissed the petition of Jermyn Capital LLC (Jermyn LLC) against Sebi which barred the company from trading in the Indian securities markets.

 A three member SAT bench, presided by Justice N K Sodhi, said Sebi was justified in passing the strictures against Jermyn LLC the regulator had barred the outfit temporarily, pending a final decision as it had a close association with Dharmesh Doshi and Ketan Parekh. This association would be enough to hold Jermyn LLC not a fit and proper person, SAT said, adding, in view of our findings, we uphold the impugned order and dismiss the appeal.

 Sebi had earlier this year restrained Jermyn LLC, a foreign corporate sub-account of Taib Bank, from accessing the domestic securities market and from buying, selling and dealing in securities after it found that Jermyn LLC had links with Jermyn Capital Partners plc (Jermyn plc), Dharmesh Doshi and Ketan Parekh.

 The market regulator has clamped down on Jermyn LLC last November as it traced a link between Jermyn LLC and the Doshi-Parekh duo.

 Jermyn plc, was earlier Triumph Securities UK plc which was a 100 per cent subsidiary of Triumph International Finance (India) Ltd (TIFIL), a Ketan-Parekh related entity. 

 Sebi pointed out that Doshi as the executive director in Jermyn plc looked after vital functions. Doshi was a co-accused with Parekh in the 2001 scam. There is a non-bailable warrant against Doshi who is also wanted by the Interpol. 

 SAT contended that there were linkages between Jermyn Capital LLC, Jermyn plc and Dharmesh Doshi/ Ketan Parekh; there were certain commonalities as well. These included the common name of Jermyn Capital, two common directors, including chairman, two common shareholders that accounted for 49 per cent shares in Jermyn Capital LLC. Sebi was of the view that Jermyn LLC being an associate of Jermyn plc, indicating interlacing and interlocking of operations and control. 

 It also divulged that Jermyn LLC substantially dealt in the shares of HFCL.

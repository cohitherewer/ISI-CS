 News Corp stake in Turkish TV company

 Istanbul, July 24 (Reuters): News Corp has agreed to buy 56.5 per cent of Turkish Huzur Radyo TV (TGRT) from Ihlas Yayin Holding for 127.2 million lira ($82 million), Ihlas Holding said in a statement on Monday.

 The accord was the latest in a series of emerging market deals for Rupert Murdochs News Corp, whose businesses include the 20th Century Fox film studios, Fox News channel and newspapers in the United States and Britain.

 Ihlas said in a statement to the Istanbul Stock Exchange it would no longer hold a stake in the company after the completion of this sale.

 Nationwide television channel TGRT went on the air in 1993 and was one of the first private TV channels in the country.

 Under the deal, the purchasers will only use the TGRT logo temporarily and Ihlas will remain owners of the TGRT brand.

 Ihlas had said in May it was in negotiations with a US-based group over the broadcaster, but had declined to comment since, although sources close to the parties said earlier this month a deal was in the final stages. 

 News Corp is already present in the Turkish outdoor advertising market. 

 Last month, Polish newspapers reported News Corp had bought a roughly 25 per cent stake in small Polish broadcaster TV Puls and in May, Georgias Imedi Holding said it had signed a preliminary agreement for the sale of a stake in its TV company, which a source at the company said was with News Corp.

 Turkey, which started EU entry talks last year, attracted $9.7 billion of FDI in 2005, and the government expects to top that in 2006.

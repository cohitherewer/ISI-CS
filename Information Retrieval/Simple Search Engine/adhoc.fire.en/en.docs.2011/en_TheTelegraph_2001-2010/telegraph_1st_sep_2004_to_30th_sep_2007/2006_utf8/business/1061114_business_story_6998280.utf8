 Jet flight to US delayed

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Patel: Cockpit view

 New Delhi, Nov. 13: Jet Airways is awaiting clearance to start flights to the US as the external affairs ministry is yet to forward the plans to the US authorities.

 Without a formal Indian approach, the US authorities, which have earlier been in a quandary over letting Jet fly to the US, will not be able to decide.

 Procedures have to be followed. Issues are being resolved between the governments, Union civil aviation minister Praful Patel said after signing a memorandum of agreement with US Federal Aviation Authority administrator Marion Blakey and R.K. Singh, joint secretary, civil aviation ministry. Under the agreement, the US will extend support to modernise the Indian civil aviation industry.

 If it is security cleared by the Union home ministry to operate in India, why are we unnecessarily dragging our feet? The matter should be put to rest as soon as possible, one way or the other, he said in response to questions whether the US Federal Aviation Authority was going to grant clearance to the airline. 

 The external affairs ministry has not yet given its go-ahead and agreed to forward the plans to US authorities, officials said.

 Last year, the Naresh Goyal-promoted carrier was granted permission to fly to the US by the Indian government for three-times-a-week service to New York via Brussels. It was, however, grounded after an American namesake Jet Airways Inc alleged that the Indian carrier had links with the underworld. 

 Jet is still awaiting clearance to its recent applications to operate to New York and San Francisco from next summer. It has also sought permission to fly to Toronto, via Hong Kong and via Dusseldorf, from next year, besides China.

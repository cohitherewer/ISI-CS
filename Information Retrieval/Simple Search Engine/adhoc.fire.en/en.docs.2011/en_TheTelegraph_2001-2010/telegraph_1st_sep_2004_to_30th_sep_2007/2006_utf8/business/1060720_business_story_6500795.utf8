The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 New outfit offers data security

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, July 19: Pinkerton Consulting and Investigations Inc ? one of the oldest investigations company in the world ? has come snooping for business in India.

 Pinkerton has formed a joint venture with New Delhi-based Kochhar Group and is seeking to offer corporate houses help to protect valuable data against competition, internal and external data leak, and executive security. 

 We did not need a local partner to enter India, but since we do not have a knowledge of the local market, we chose to enter the country through a joint venture, quot; Barry Wilkins, vice-president, Pinkerton Consulting, told The Telegraph. 

 We have lots of multinational clients who are setting up their business in India now, they wanted us to have a presence in the country, he said.

 But the company, which already has four offices in China, has taken its own time to come to India. Wilkins admits that its entry into India has been a little delayed. But India presents some unique challenges.

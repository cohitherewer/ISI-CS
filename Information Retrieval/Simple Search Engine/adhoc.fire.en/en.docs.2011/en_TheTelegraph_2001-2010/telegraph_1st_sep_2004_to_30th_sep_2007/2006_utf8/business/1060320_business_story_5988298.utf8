 Trade pacts split textile world

 On a shopping binge

 Mumbai, March 19: The government may be optimistic about the outcome of the free trade agreements (FTAs) and the preferential trade agreements (PTAs) entered with different countries, but its move has torn the textile industry apart.

 While one section of the industry views these FTAs and PTAs to be beneficial because vital raw materials will become cheaper, others, such as garment makers, argue that the domestic industry will be badly hit.

 Over the past few years, India has been following a strategy of regional and bilateral FTAs and PTAs. It has already signed a PTA enabling import and export of goods at below stipulated tariff levels with Sri Lanka in December 1998. The preferential trade agreement has become operational since March 2000.

 India had signed a similar trade pact with Chile early last year and another with Singapore in August 2005. The Indo-Singapore Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) covers goods and services, investments and aviation.

 However, it is the comprehensive trade pact with Asean that is being frowned upon with great apprehensions by a segment of the domestic textile industry. The agreement with Asean is considered by the government as the stepping stone in the countrys Look East policy initiated in early 1990s. This trade pact aims at gradual reduction and elimination of tariffs between January 2006 and December 2011 among all Asean countries barring Philippines.

 Though the negotiations are yet to conclude, the domestic textile industry is divided in its opinions. While one segment, primarily the consumers of fibre and yarn, are in favour of such an agreement, the garment industry in particular fears that the agreement may hit the domestic industry hard. 

 Fibre and yarn buyers want the agreement to go through as they feel that the domestic industry, which consists of giants like Reliance Industries Ltd, do not need protection.

 Garment manufacturers argue that the deficiency in patrolling has already resulted in cheap imports from few countries coming into India via other nations and flooding the domestic market.

 We do not need protection in basic raw material, fibres or yarns, but protection is indeed needed in areas such as woven garments and made-ups as these segments could be vulnerable to foreign competition, industry sources said.

 The government is finalising a negative list of items for the India-Asean free trade agreement to protect the sensitive products and sectors, especially in agriculture. 

 Items in the negative list will be exempt from tariff reductions.

 The government has chosen spices, plantation crops, vegetable oils, rice, fish, textiles, chemicals and plastics, electronics, machinery, auto components and footwear as the sectors for consultation.

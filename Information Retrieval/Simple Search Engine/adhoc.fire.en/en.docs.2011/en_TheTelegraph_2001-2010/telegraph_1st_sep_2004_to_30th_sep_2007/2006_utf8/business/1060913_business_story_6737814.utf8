 Guidelines for industrial estates

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 12: The Bengal government will soon frame guidelines for the development of industrial estates by the private sector, Atri Bhattacharya, chief executive officer, West Bengal Industrial Infrastructure Development Corporation (WBIIDC), said today. According to Bhattacharya, a number of private industrial estates ran into trouble, particularly in matters of acquisition of land and conversion of farm land into industrial use, in the absence of such guidelines.

 He was speaking on the sidelines of a seminar on investment potential of Bengal, organised by the Bharat Chamber of Commerce here today.

 Making an implicit reference to the Jalan Industrial Complex at Domjur, Howrah, Bhattacharya said the government is now working on a policy framework to allow private players to develop industrial estates on their own. 

 As of now there is no clear cut guidelines for developing private industrial parks and these real estate infrastructure for industries are being developed by the WBIIDC in collaboration with the private sector. WBIIDC is currently developing three industrial estates a composite industrial estate on the lines of a mini-township at Bolpur in Birbhum district, a stand-alone industrial estate for small and medium enterprises in Malda, and one at Fatapukur in Jalpaiguri, Bhattacharya said. 

 As things stand now, we cant develop industrial estates in isolation. They should be developed with supporting social infrastructure so that there could be a work-life balance. WBIIDC is doing a pilot project at Bolpur, where a composite industrial complex will be developed that will house industrial units as well as residential and educational facilities, Bhattacharya added. 

 In a joint venture with a consortium of private players, WBIIDC has formed a Rs 350-crore special purpose vehicle, called Santiniketan Infrastructure Private Ltd (SIPL), for the Bolpur project. SIPL is very close to signing up three big companies, who have shown keen interest to set up shop in this industrial estate, Bhattacharya said. Declining to disclose the name of the companies, he, however added that this would be announced after the board meeting of the corporation on September 18. It is reported that Tatas have evinced interest to set up a hotel, Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance is willing to open an agri-retail outlet and Amity School is eager to set up an educational institute. The SPV has acquired 200 acres of land on the outskirts of Bolpur.

 Besides, we are also talking to a Swedish company which has evinced interest in development of clusters, he said.

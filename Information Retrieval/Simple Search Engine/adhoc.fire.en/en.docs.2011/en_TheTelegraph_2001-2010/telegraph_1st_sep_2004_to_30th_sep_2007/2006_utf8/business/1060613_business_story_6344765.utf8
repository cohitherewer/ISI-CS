 High-voltage plan to up power capacity

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Shahi: Electricity for all

 Calcutta, June 12: India will add 75,000 megawatt during the Eleventh Five Year Plan period, which will begin from the next financial year.

 R.V. Shahi, Union power secretary, said the ministry and Central Electric Authority (CEA) was working out an approach paper to provide a roadmap for the power sector. 

 Although the approach paper will be finalised by October, Shahi said 62,000 mw would come from conventional sectors, while another 6,000 mw would be generated by non-conventional sources.

 ?Captive power generation could be around 7,000 mw, totalling the entire capacity addition at 75,000 mw, compared with 44,000 mw in the Tenth Plan period,? Shahi said.

 The Planning Commission, he said, has set up seven sub-groups for demand projection, determination of thermal and hydro mix, transmission and distribution aspects, technology and R amp;D, manpower training and energy conservation.

 Shahi, chairman of the working group on the power sector, said the groups would submit their recommendations by October. The strategic inputs that are being considered in the approach paper include lower dependence on power generation from LNG and gas. 

 The target for hydel power generation during the Tenth Plan was 10,000 mw. It has been raised to 17,000 mw in the Eleventh Plan.

 The power secretary said the ministry was also in favour of nuclear power generation and the target set for it was 3000 mw.

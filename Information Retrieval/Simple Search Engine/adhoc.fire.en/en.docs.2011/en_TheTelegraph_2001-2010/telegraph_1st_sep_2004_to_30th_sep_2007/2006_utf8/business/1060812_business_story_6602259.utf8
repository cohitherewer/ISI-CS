 Sebi cracks whip on trio

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Aug. 11: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has suspended the certificate of registration of Credit Suisse First Boston (India) Securities Limited (CSFB) for a month.

 The market regulator has also suspended the certificate of registration of IndusInd Bank and Integrated Enterprises, both depository participants of the National Securities Depository Limited (NSDL), for 15 days each.

 Sebi conducted investigation against CSFB regarding the trading of the scrip of Southeast Asia Marine Engineering and Constructions, formerly known as Peerless Shipping and Oilfields, for the period from June 1, 1999 to May 31, 2000.

 The investigations revealed that the price of the scrip, which was traded on the Bombay Stock Exchange and the Calcutta Stock Exchange, moved from Rs 15 to Rs 389 within eight months. Around 5.25 crore shares were traded on these exchanges during the period.

 It was also revealed that CSFB traded in the scrip on behalf of other members, including C. Mackertich Limited (CML), and in its own trading account.

 CSFB violated rules by allowing CML, which was a member of the same exchange, to conduct trades as its sub-broker without signing any agreement. 

 Based on the investigations, a showcause notice was served to CSFB on January 12, 2005.

 IndusInd Bank was investigated by Sebi for irregularities in the dematerialisation of the scrip of DSQ Software. It was found that of the 13 million unlisted shares DSQ floated in the secondary market, 4 million came through the beneficiary account opened with IndusInd Bank.

 Investigations into Integrated Enterprises (India) Limited (IEIL) revealed that of the 13 million unlisted shares of DSQ Software, 6 million came through the beneficiary account opened with them.

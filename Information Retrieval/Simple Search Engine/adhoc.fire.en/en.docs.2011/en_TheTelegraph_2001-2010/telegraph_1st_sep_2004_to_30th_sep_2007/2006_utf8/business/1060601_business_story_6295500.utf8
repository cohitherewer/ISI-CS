 Adani hunts for more land

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, May 31: The Ahmedabad?based Adani Group is not satisfied, in fact they are hungry for more. 

 After having signed the biggest land deal in the country with Mumbai-based Housing Development and Infrastructure Ltd (HDIL) at Rs 2,250 crore, they are looking at grabbing more land. 

 According to real estate sources, the group has also struck a deal to pick up close to 60 acres of mill land belonging to the Khatau Family at the eastern Mumbai suburb of Byculla and 20 acres in the western suburb of Borivali. 

 According to estimates, the price paid at Borivali will be close to Rs 1,800 per square feet and at Byculla around Rs 7,000 per square feet. 

 Given that, the price paid for the Byculla land will come to Rs 1,827 crore and the price of the Borivli land adds up to Rs 156.6 crore. The combined cost of the deal comes to Rs 1,983.6 crore. 

 It is not clear what they want to do with the land, but they could be looking at developing it into a commercial and retail space, said a real estate analyst. 

 The company has recently struck a Rs 2,250-crore deal to develop a commercial and retail hub at the Bandra Kurla Complex at the western Mumbai suburb of Bandra. The deal involves the sale and development of over 48 acres. 

 BKC is one of the most sought after commercial addresses in Mumbai. HDIL, promoted by Sunny Wadhawan, is a 12-year-old construction firm involved in development activities in the western and the eastern suburb of the city. 

 Unitech Group had recently struck a Rs 1,583-crore deal for 340 acres in Noida, which was considered the largest deal so far. 

 The Adani Group, known primarily for its export-oriented business, in the last 5-6 years has diversified into logistics with the opening of its private port in Mundra in 2000. 

 The company now has a supermarket chain and is also into gas distribution business in Gujarat . 

 The Khatau family is among the old textile families of Mumbai. The mills were once the manufacturers of Khatau Voiles saris. It stopped manufacturing in 1997 and was declared a sick unit in 1989 by BIFR. The sell-off of the land was proposed by a rehab scheme in 1993.

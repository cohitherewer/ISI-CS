 Oil duo in Nigerian race

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 11: Oil India Limited (OIL) and Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) have emerged as the front runners for an oil exploration block in Nigeria.

 A senior OIL official said while the OIL-IOC bid was the second highest in the round, it is expected to get the block by default. A Canadian company, which was the highest bidder, is unwilling to pay the signature amount, which is mandatory for acquiring the block in Nigeria. As a result, the block is now expected to be offered to the Indian firms.

 The two Indian companies have a local company as their bid partner. While OIL and IOC hope to pick up 40-45 per cent each, the Nigerian partner would have a 10-20 per cent stake in the block.

 The government has allowed IOC and OIL to acquire overseas oil and gas assets. The expertise of OIL in the upstream sector, coupled with the financial muscle of IOC, was expected to form a second company after OVL that could enhance the countrys oil security. The government is pursuing a policy of supporting its oil companies such as OIL and IOC to explore global opportunities in exploration and production for fulfiling the countrys energy demand.

 OIL has earmarked a budget of around $150 million for its overseas ventures. 

 On raising of funds for the acquisition, OIL director (exploration and development) S.K. Patra said the amount will be accumulated through internal acquisition and adjustments. The company is also planning to expand its domestic activities and would focus on strengthening its presence in Rajasthan.

 Last fiscal, our production was around 3.2 million metric tonnes. This year we aim to cross 3.5 mmt, Patra said adding that the company is about to begin drilling of four of its wells in the country, two each in Rajasthan and Orissa.

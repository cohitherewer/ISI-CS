 ACC expansion to cost Rs 537 crore

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, July 19: Associated Cement Companies (ACC) has outlined an investment plan of Rs 537 crore to expand capacity and set up a captive power plant. 

 The company is expanding its Bargarh cement works from 0.96 million tonnes to 2.14 million tonnes and will put up a 30 mw captive power plant. 

 According to the company, the projects at Lakheri for expansion of capacity and setting up a 25 mw captive power plant are on schedule. 

 The second largest cement maker of country today reported a growth of 184 per cent in its net profit at Rs 405.58 crore for the quarter ended June 30, 2006 against Rs 142.44 crore achieved during the same period last financial year. 

 The total income of the company increased by 27 per cent at Rs 1,477.63 crore for the second quarter of the fiscal against Rs 1,165.43 crore achieved during the year-ago period. 

 However, the company said as it divested certain non-core businesses while merging cement operations during the same quarter of the previous year, the results for the June quarter of this fiscal are not comparable with the respective previous period. 

 According to ACC, the cement industry recorded a growth rate of about 9.44 per cent in 2005 against 8.27 per cent in the previous period. 

 During the first half of 2006, the demand grew at around 12.2 per cent compared with 10.5 per cent for the corresponding period of the previous year. 

 The company expects that with the continued emphasis on infrastructure and housing sectors, the demand for cement is expected to remain strong. 

 On a consolidated basis, the group has posted a net profit of Rs 411.79 crore for the quarter ended June 30, 2006, a growth of over 176 per cent against Rs 148.95 crore for the same period last fiscal. 

 The total income of the group stood at Rs 1,493.88 crore for the second quarter of the current fiscal, a growth of over 20 per cent from Rs 1,242.61 crore recorded during the same period last year.

 Posco port proposal cleared

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, Aug. 7: The captive port proposal of Posco with an expected cargo handling capacity of 25-28 million tonnes per annum at Jatadhari creek in Jagatsinghpur district was today provisionally cleared by Orissa State Coastal Zone Management Authority.

 Last year, Posco submitted a proposal to set up the captive port at the mouth of Jatadhar creek, about 12 km south of Paradip, and sought coastal regulatory zone and environmental clearance. 

 The company proposes to invest around $900 million for the port that will be built over 114.8 acres. 

 The coastal authority has requested the ministry of environment and forests to give a provisional environmental clearance on the basis of a standard coastal regulation zone (CRZ) notification. 

 Sources said the proposal is almost cleared as the Centres assent to the state bodys proposal was just a formality.

 The coastal authority is set up by the ministry of environment and forests to identify ecologically sensitive and economically important regions.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Valued associates

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, May 19: The State Bank of India is banking on the huge investment value locked in its four unlisted associate banks to add to its fortunes. Of the seven associate banks, State Bank of Mysore, State Bank of Bikaner and Jaipur and State Bank of Travancore are listed on the domestic bourses.

 The associate banks taken together form the second largest bank in the country and they have reported good growth. Consider ICICI Bank, which is the second largest bank now. Its market capitalisation is above Rs 45,000 crore. Our unlisted associate banks can unlock huge value for us (SBI), if not Rs 45,000 crore, when they enter the capital market with their public issues, said chairman A.K. Purwar. 

 SBI holds a 100 per cent stake in three of the four unlisted associate banks ? State Bank of Hyderabad, State Bank of Patiala, State Bank of Saurashtra. It holds a 90 per cent stake in the State Bank of Indore.

 Within two months from the day Parliament approves the amendments to the State Bank of India (Subsidiary Banks) Act, 1959 our associate banks will start tapping the market, Purwar said. However, neither will the four associate banks hit the capital market simultaneously nor will SBI sell off its stakes at one go. 

 These banks are huge resources for us and we will gradually dilute our stakes in them, said SBI managing director Om Prakash Bhatt. State Bank of Patiala will be the first to come out with an IPO. We want to hit the market with the best bank in our fold. 

 However, the per share book value of each of these unlisted associate banks is very high and this may make the pricing of their IPOs a little difficult. For example, the book value of State Bank of Hyderabad (SBH) is Rs 12,255 per share having a face value of Rs 100. Since a companys issue price is unlikely to be below its per share book value, SBHs issue price will be at least Rs 25,000 per share, having a face value of Rs 100 or Rs 2,500 per share with a face value of Rs 10. This is well above the current market price of SBI, the parent banks, shares (Rs 900).

 To circumvent this problem, the associate banks may issue bonus shares to SBI beforehand, which will increase their shares and reduce their per share book value, sources said.

 The associate banks have already appointed 3-4 merchant bankers, including Morgan Stanley, DSP Merrill Lynch, Enam Securities and SBI Capital.

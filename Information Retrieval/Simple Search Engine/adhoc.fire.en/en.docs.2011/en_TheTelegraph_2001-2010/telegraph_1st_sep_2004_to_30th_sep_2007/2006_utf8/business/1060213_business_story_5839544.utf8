 Tractebel to advise GAIL on pipeline

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 PIPE DREAM

 New Delhi, Feb. 12: GAIL (India) Ltd has hired SUZ Tractebel of Belgium as the technical consultant to prepare a detailed feasibility report on the proposed Myanmar?India pipeline via the northeastern states bypassing Bangladesh.

 A senior GAIL official told The Telegraph that the report would be submitted within three months. 

 The move is expected to send a clear message to Myanmar that India is serious about importing the gas and is not prepared to let Bangladesh hold the project to ransom. 

 The proposed Myanmar-India pipeline will be routed through Mizoram, Assam, Bengal and Bihar. It will also have the provision to transport gas from developing gas fields in Tripura and Assam. 

 The Myanmar gas will be injected at Gaya in the proposed Jagdishpur-Haldia pipeline.

 Myanmar has been in favour of a pipeline entirely through the Indian territory, as it will reduce the political uncertainty and delay involved in partnering with Bangladesh in the project. 

 However, since the distance through Bangladesh is much shorter, India wanted to explore that possibility. 

 Myanmar has also signed an MoU with China for the sale of natural gas and India will have to factor in the increased competition.

 India has informed Myanmar that it is ready to buy natural gas from its offshore Shwe fields on a take-or-pay basis in an effort to offer them a better deal than the Chinese.

 A senior petroleum ministry official said although Myanmar had signed an MoU with China, there was no agreement as yet on the quantity of gas that would be supplied or the commercial terms of the deal. 

 SUZ Tractebel are international consultants specialising in pre-feasibility and feasibility studies on transnational pipelines for oil and natural gas. The technical consultants will prepare the environment management plan and rapid risk analysis study report as well. 

 The basic contents of the feasibility study will include route selection, design parameters, system reliability, redundancy, safety, security, hydraulics, cost estimation, risk analysis, project construction schedule and project implementation strategy.

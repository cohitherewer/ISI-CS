 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, May 26: Tobacco-to-FMCG major ITC Ltd has posted a 36 per cent growth in post-tax profit (before exceptional items) and a 27.9 per cent jump in net turnover for the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2006.

 Earnings stood at Rs 567.47 crore against Rs 417.42 crore in the same period previous year. Turnover increased from Rs 2,177.11 crore to Rs 2,784.46 crore.

 ITCs profitability was once again driven by the cigarette segment followed by hotels and paperboard businesses.

 Non-cigarette FMCG business continued to be a drag on the bottomline, although the company managed to pare down loss from Rs 68.5 crore in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004-05 to Rs 42.34 crore last year.

 The board of directors has recommended a dividend of Rs 2.65 per ordinary share of Re 1 each.

 The company has reported a 24.1 per cent growth in post-tax profit (before exceptional items) at Rs 2,280 crore for 2005-06 compared with Rs 1,837.07 crore in 2004-05. Net turnover grew 28 per cent at Rs 10,317.56 crore against Rs 8,057.75 crore.

 Cigarette continues to be the mainstay of the company and it grew 13.3 per cent last fiscal.

 However, its strategy to diversify into other business has started paying rich dividends. The non-cigarette segment grew 46.2 per cent fuelled by a strong performance of hotels, paperboards and agri businesses. 

 Over the last six years, the net turnover of the non-cigarette businesses has grown at 30 per cent to touch Rs 4,707 crore in 2005-06. Consequently, its share in the companys turnover has increased from 25 per cent in 2000 to 48 per cent in 2005. 

 The financials for the year include Rs 45 crore (post-tax), representing exceptional items relating to once-off assistance to contract manufacturers in view of the retrospective withdrawal of central excise exemption on cigarettes manufactured in the Northeastern states. 

 Net of this exceptional item, the companys profit after tax stands at Rs 2,235 crore. Earnings per share (before exceptional items) for the year stood at Rs 6.08.

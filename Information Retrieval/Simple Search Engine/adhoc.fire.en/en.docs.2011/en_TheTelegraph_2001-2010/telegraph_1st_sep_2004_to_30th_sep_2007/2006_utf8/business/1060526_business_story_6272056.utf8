 New Delhi, May 25: Dell Inc is likely to start making PCs in India by the end of this year. 

 Paul Henri, vice-president and general manager for Dell Asia Pacific operations, said: ?We are very close to finalising the location for our manufacuturing base.? However, he declined to reveal the amount the company intends to invest in the project.

 Dell is expected to make an announcement within a couple of weeks, he added. The company, which sells through a direct delivery model, expects to cut the delivery time from 10-15 days to 3-5 days with the setting up of its manufacturing unit. 

 Dell, the world?s largest PC manufacturer, imports the products from either its Malaysia or China units. India will be the seventh location for a Dell plant. Henri said the focus initially will be the desktop as it is a highly cost-sensitive product. Dell?s revenue from India surged 40 per cent to $80 million during February-April, from the same period a year ago.

 In the Indian PC market, Dell has a 5 per cent share, which is estimated at 4.6 million units a year and is growing at 30 per cent annually.

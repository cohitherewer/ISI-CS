 Indian Oil to crank up output from Haldia

 S.P.S. PANNU 

 Supply Push

 New Delhi, April 23: Indian Oil Corporation has drawn up a Rs 240-crore plan to revamp the fluidised catalytic cracking unit at its Haldia refinery, to produce more LPG and increase the refining capacity of crude oil .

 A senior IOC official told The Telegraph that US-based Stone Webster would prepare a feasibility report of the project. The company had supplied the old FCC unit and would now install the new facility.

 While the cost of the project has been estimated at Rs 240 crore, IOC has appointed Engineers India Ltd to assess the actual investment.

 The risk analysis and rapid environment impact assessment study is in progress.

 Indian Oil expects the detailed feasibility report and environmental clearance from the government for the project to be completed by March 2007. 

 The project will enable IOC to increase the profitability of the Haldia refinery as the LPG production from the same barrel of crude will increase. Also, the total quantity of crude processed by the refinery through the unit will go up after the revamp.

 The bigger project of setting up a hydrocracker unit at the Haldia refinery has already got underway. 

 The Rs 1,867-crore project, which will enhance the capacity of the refinery from 5 million tonnes to 7.5 million tonnes, is scheduled to be completed by April 2009. 

 The hydrocracker unit will also increase the profitability of the refinery, as it will raise the yield of petroleum products such as petrol, diesel, LPG and jet fuel from 65.7 per cent at present to 69.48 per cent from the same barrel of crude. 

 This unit will also enable the Haldia refinery to upgrade the quality of diesel from Europe III to Europe IV level, which will have to be introduced in the future. 

 The hydrocracker is a secondary processing unit through which crude oil passes after it has been refined through the primary vacuum distillation unit. 

 This process yields more light and middle distillates such as petrol, diesel and kerosene from the same quantity of crude. 

 All modern refineries have a hydrocracker unit.

 Indian Oil Corporation has informed the petroleum ministry that it would invest Rs 3,500 crore in implementing four major projects, including the modernisation of the Haldia refinery, during 2006-07.

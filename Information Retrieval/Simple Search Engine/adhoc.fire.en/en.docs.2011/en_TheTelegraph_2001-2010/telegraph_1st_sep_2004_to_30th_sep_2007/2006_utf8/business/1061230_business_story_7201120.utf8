 Inflation rate rises to 5.43%

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Dec. 29: Rising prices of essential food items such as wheat and pulses pushed up the inflation rate to 5.43 per cent during the week ended December 16 from 5.32 per cent in the previous week, according to official data released today. 

 The increase in the rate of inflation is even higher when compared with 4.62 per cent during the same week of the previous year.

 The rate of inflation has remained above 5 per cent for the last two-and-a-half months even as finance minister P. Chidambaram has been maintaining that the government is committed to bringing it below this mark. 

 Inflation had touched 5.44 per cent this fiscal on June 17, which prompted the government to relax imports of wheat, pulses and sugar, apart from banning exports of sugar to increase the domestic availability of these essential commodities. However, inflation during the week ended October 21 has been revised to 5.61 per cent, against 5.41 per cent estimated provisionally, making it the worst month so far during the current fiscal. 

 The wholesale price index (base 1993-94), on which the inflation data is based, rose by 0.05 per cent to 207.8 points for the week ended December 16 from 207.7 points in the previous week.

 Ministry bid to protect Paradip port

 PRABUDDHA S. JAGADEB

 Bhubaneswar, April 3: The Union shipping ministry has asked the Orissa government to conduct a study by an independent expert group to ascertain if the Paradip port would be adversely affected in case a minor port came up in its vicinity.

 South Korean steelmaker Posco, which is setting up a 12-million-tonne steel plant in the state, has proposed to invest around $900 million to set up a captive port at the Jatadhari river mouth, about 7 km from Paradip.

 In February, Union shipping secretary A.K. Mohapatra had written to the state chief secretary Subas Pani regarding the study.

 Paradip is already under stress by the construction of a sea wall, Mohapatra said at a meet on maritime policy and its impact on economic development of eastern India. He has also proposed a single-point mooring of Indian Oils petrochemical complex and laying a crude oil pipeline from Paradip to Haldia.

 When you are planning a new investment, you should ensure it does not conflict with that made on an existing port, Mohapatra said. 

 The new port should not have duplication of facility available at the existing one in Paradip, he said.

 He emphasised the need for major and minor ports to complement each other to avoid conflict of interests.

 In November last year, Union transport minister T.R. Baalu had shrugged off the purported threat to Paradip from the captive port of Posco.

 On Friday, Orissa minister for commerce and transport Jayanarayan Mishra told the state Assembly that Poscos port proposal was under consideration.

 Paradip is one of the 12 major ports in the country. It is important for sea-borne trade in the eastern part covering Orissa, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar. With a natural depth of about 13 m, the port is located inside a lagoon, which offers problem-free berthing facility all the year round.

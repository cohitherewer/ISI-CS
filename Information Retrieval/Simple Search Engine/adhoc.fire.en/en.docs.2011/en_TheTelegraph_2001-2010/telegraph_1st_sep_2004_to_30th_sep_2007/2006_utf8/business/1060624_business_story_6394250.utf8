 Sahara laments brand death

 Name game

 New Delhi, June 23: Air Sahara feels its brand value eroded during the period it was engaged to Jet Airways and it now needs to ? rebrand itself?. The airline, whose merger with Jet Airways broke off earlier this week over buyout price differences, will now access US Exim Bank debt to buy 10 Boeing 737-800s. The planes sport a list price of $640 million. 

 ?Our brand value has been allowed to fall ... it?s too early to quantify in monetary terms the brand value lost, but there has been an erosion,? Air Sahara president Alok Sharma said today. Air Sahara sources feel some of its flights were cancelled and merged with Jet flights, eroding customer confidence in the airline. As a result, plane load factors, the key determinant of revenue and profitability, suffered. 

 ?We had an average plane load factor of nearly 80 per cent last December. This has come down,? said Sharma. 

 The airline, however, wants to look ahead and feels it will have to revive or bring in marketing innovations, besides work on brand building, to win over customers.

 ?Operations are normal ... our employee morale has come back, our people feel happier now ... the other two objectives we have are to get operations back in focus and win back customer confidence. We are working towards these goals,? said Sharma. 

 Sharma said Sahara would be taking on board 10 Boeing 737-800s, funded through debt from the US Exim Bank. The fleet acquisition will be with a bias towards international operations. 

 ?These aircraft have a range of 5 and a half hours or so and we intend to use some of them for international operations ... they have been ordered with international configurations.?

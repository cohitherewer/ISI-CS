 Visa Steel profit zooms

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, July 31: Visa Steel Limited, a subsidiary of Calcutta-based Visa Group, has reported a 253 per cent jump in its first-quarter profit at Rs 8.1 crore compared with Rs 2.3 crore in the corresponding period.

 The company has raked in a gross revenue of Rs 113.5 crore.

 The Kalinganagar plant has produced 43,506 tonnes of hot metal in the first quarter, while the pig iron production reached 2 lakh tonnes, Visa Steel chairman Vishambhar Saran said. The pig iron production level is set to reach 3 lakh tonnes in the next three months, he said.

 Growth in revenues and profits had been driven by the pig iron business and the results from the coke oven plant will be visible from 2006-07 onwards, Saran said. We are confident that our company will perform better in the forthcoming quarters of 2006-07 with the phased implementation of the proposed projects.

 Of the proposed Rs 1,146-crore expansion plan, Rs 325 crore has already been invested and the remaining will be pumped in within the next 18 months, he added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Duo to pay for laxity

 S.P.S. PANNU 

 New Delhi, June 28: The government may put up for fresh bidding four blocks of Reliance and seven of ONGC. 

 It is likely that the duo will have to relinquish their rights over these blocks as they have reportedly failed to meet their commitments. 

 Director-general of hydrocarbons V.K. Sibal told The Telegraph that the production sharing contract commits the companies to clear-cut work schedules. Those failing to follow the timeline are given a maximum extension of 18 months. 

 Since the extended deadline has passed for ONGC and RIL without them fulfilling their commitments, the contracts have become null and void, Sibal said. The policy applies to others as well, he added. 

 A clause in the contract says the company must relinquish a block if it fails to meet the timelines. This ensures that exploration proceeds at a decent pace.

 Sibal said, Reliance is a professionally managed company and understands that this is a normal thing to happen given the terms of the contract that it has signed.

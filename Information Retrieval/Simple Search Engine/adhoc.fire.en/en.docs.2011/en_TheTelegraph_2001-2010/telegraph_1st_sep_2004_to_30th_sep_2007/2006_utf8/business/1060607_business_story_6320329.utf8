 Calcutta, June 6: The premium costs for commercial vehicle and motor third party insurance are likely to go up from next year. The medical insurance cost for some age groups will also go up.

 However, it may be cheaper to insure a property or a house against fire and theft. Also, the cost of insuring owner-driven cars will come down from 2007.

 Premium cost for insurance of properties may come down, but some liability insurance premium is likely to go up, said B. Chakrabarti, CMD of New India Assurance Co. 

 These changes are likely to come following the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authoritys proposal to de-tariff the general insurance sector from January 1, 2007. 

 As of now, the tariff advisory committee fixes the premium cost for these insurance products, which contribute over 70 per cent to the total general insurance business in the country. From January, the insurers will be free to price their products according to their individual calculation of the risk to claim ratio vis a vis the products.

 The claim ratio is more than 100 per cent for medical and commercial vehicle insurance, Chakrabarti said.

 Insurers will have to subsidise these products from profits in other products. There shouldnt be any cross-subsidisation, he added. 

 In medical insurance claims, we have noticed that nearly 55-60 per cent of the total expenses are room rents. Earlier, there were sub-limits on different expenses in a medical insurance policy. But later, these sub-limits were gone. We are planning re-impose them, said V. Ramaswamy, CMD, National Insurance Co Ltd. 

 According to Chakrabarti, public sector insurers are trying to standardise medical expenses by proposing a medical regulatory authority. They are also planning to put a check on third party administrators (TPAs) to facilitate faster claim settlements.

 Oriental Insurance CMD M. Ramadoss said, We are planning to appoint outside consultants to settle medical insurance claim disputes faster.

 The public sector insurers have also proposed a pool fund for medical insurance.

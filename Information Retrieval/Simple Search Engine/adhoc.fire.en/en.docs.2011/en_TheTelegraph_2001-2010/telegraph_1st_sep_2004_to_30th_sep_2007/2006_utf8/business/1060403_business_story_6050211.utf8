 Tata Steel clears Maruti test drive

 Calcutta, April 2: Maruti Udyog has approved the skin panel components developed for its cars by Tata Steel. The carmaker will now use them on a commercial scale. This marks an important step in the development of value-added high-grade auto steel in the country.

 The two companies had started developing this sophisticated cold-rolled product in 2004. Tata Steel said Maruti has approved some of the skin panel components and placed orders for those.

 A skin panel is the outer shell consisting of the front, rear and the sides of a car.

 A good skin panel strikes the right balance between thickness and strength.

 While Tata Steel has been supplying other components to Maruti for a long time, the skin panel is the latest and a prized addition.

 We are also working on 22 other skin panel components, which are in various stages of development, a Tata Steel official said. In 2006-07, the company will supply 35,000 tonnes directly to Maruti and sell another 30,000 tonnes to different auto vendors for manufacturing ancillaries.

 The challenge for steel companies is to provide the desired strength in a sheet without making it thick. Thicker the sheet, heavier the car and lower the fuel efficiency, an auto expert said.

 Maruti has been mostly importing skin panel components from Korea and Germany. However, the company has been working closely with domestic steel makers to develop the product indigenously.

 The move will benefit Maruti, other carmakers as well as steel companies. For the auto sector, local vendors will mean a lower cost by way of reduced logistic charges and less inventory.

 For steel firms, it means going up the value chain to protect themselves from the ups and downs of a commodity cycle as skin panels are niche products.

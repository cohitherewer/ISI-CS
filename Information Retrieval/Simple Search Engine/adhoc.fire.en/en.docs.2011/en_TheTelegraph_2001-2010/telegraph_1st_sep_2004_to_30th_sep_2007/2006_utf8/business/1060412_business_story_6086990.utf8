 Tokyo, April 11 (Reuters): General Motors Corp said on Tuesday it will sell its 7.9 per cent stake in Japanese truck maker Isuzu Motors Ltd for $300 million, unravelling a 35-year equity alliance to raise much-needed cash to revive its ailing business.

 In a widely expected move, Japanese trading houses Mitsubishi Corp and Itochu Corp will each take a 3.5 per cent stake from the US auto giant, while Mizuho Corporate Bank, a unit of Mizuho Financial Group Inc, will buy the remaining 0.9 per cent, the companies said.

 The worlds biggest auto maker had been discussing the sale of its stake in its long-time Japanese partner after similar steps with Subaru maker Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd and Suzuki Motor Corp since late last year.

 The sale of diesel-savvy Isuzu, regarded as GMs strongest strategic partner in Japan, demonstrates the urgency of the Detroit car makers task to improve its cash flow, given the relatively modest proceeds from the transaction. The cash amount was based on the agreed price of 397 yen a share for Isuzu, equivalent to the 30-day trading average at the time of the agreement, GM Asia-Pacific president Troy Clarke said. That would represent a 9.8 per cent discount from 440 yen, Isuzus closing share price on Tuesday. GM said its relationship with Isuzu would remain intact at the operational level, and even strengthen in future as the loss-riddled US auto maker seeks to expand in developing countries and demand for diesel cars grows around the world.

 GM accounts for more than one-fifth of Isuzus revenues, purchasing more than 183 billion yen ($1.54 billion) in parts and products from the Japanese truck maker, Clarke said.

 Our relationship is strong today. We expect it to be even stronger in the future, he told a joint news conference with Isuzu in Tokyo, adding that he looked forward to the next 35 years of their partnership.

 GM and Isuzu first formed an equity alliance in 1971 and their cooperation spans a broad range, including mutual supply of trucks as well as joint development and production of commercial vehicles and diesel engines.

 GM has helped us, a domestic truck maker, turn our eyes to the global stage, Isuzu president Yoshinori Ida said. Were now an international truck maker ? that is our biggest asset and we owe that to GM. The transfer of the Isuzu stake to the three companies of the truck makers choice is seen as positive, given their close and long-standing business relationships. Mitsubishi Corp sells Isuzu trucks in Thailand and Itochu sells them in North America. They both also own preferred shares in the company.

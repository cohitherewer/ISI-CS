 Big firms eat into investors? wealth

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Feb. 5: This might come as a bit of a shock: infotech titan Wipro and consumer goods mammoth Hindustan Lever Ltd are among the top 10 investors? wealth destroyers in the last five years.

 A study conducted by Motilal Oswal Securities say 100 wealth destroyers have knocked off Rs 2,58,600 crore with technology, media and telecom stocks accounting for 60 entries and 85 per cent of the total wealth destroyed. 

 The other major industries to destroy investors? wealth are FMCG, consumer goods and finance. 

 The oil and gas sector has been the largest wealth creator for the five-year period with a total wealth of Rs 1,83,900 crore. ONGC remains the single biggest wealth creator with total wealth created at Rs 1,06,500 crore, which is 58 per cent of the total sector. 

 Other sectors at the forefront of wealth creators are banks, metals, engineering and auto followed by petrochem, pharma, utility, FMCG, cement, textiles, shipping, fertilisers, sugar and IT. 

 Multinational companies, which contributed 40 per cent of the total wealth created in the early 90s, chipped in only 6.8 per cent in 2000-05. 

 State-owned companies constitute 30 entries in the 100-wealth creator group. Despite being very large and handicapped by government controls, these entities have delivered 27 per cent of the earnings growth and accounted for 50.6 per cent of the total wealth created. Private companies have achieved 34 per cent earnings growth. 

 The study says the fastest wealth creators during the five-year period have been Matrix Laboratories, Aban Loyd Chiles and Gujarat NRE Coke. The list also includes Sterling Biotech, Jubilant Organosys, Pantaloon Retail, Amtek Auto, Sesa Goa, Hindustan Zinc and Bharat Earth Movers. 

 In the five-year period, while the BSE sensex recorded a decline in three out of five years, the wealth creator group fell only in one year. The group outperformed the sensex in all the years. 

 The study also identifies the 10 most consistent wealth creators over a longer period of 15 years ? and here Wipro shows up on the list. While the scrip features in the 10 most wealth destroyers over the five-year period between 2000 and 2005, it is the third most consistent wealth creator with the highest total wealth created of Rs 46,17,800 crore since 1991. 

 The top consistent companies are Hero Honda and Ranbaxy Laboratories.

 Matsushita to sell JVC stake

 Tokyo, Dec. 23 (Reuters): Matsushita Electric Industrial has decided to sell at least half, and maybe all, of its 78-billion-yen ($656 million) stake in JVC, a loss-making consumer electronics unit, and is in talks with audio equipment maker Kenwood Corp, a financial daily reported on Saturday. 

 The Nihon Keizai Shimbun (Nikkei) said Matsushita, the worlds largest consumer electronics maker, planned to slash its stake in Victor Co of Japan Ltd (JVC) from 52.4 per cent to less than 20 per cent by a shareholder meeting next June. 

 The paper said US private equity firm Cerberus had also offered to buy JVC through a management buy-out. 

 JVCs market value is around 149 billion yen ($1.3 billion), suggesting Matsushita would raise about 45 billion yen from selling a 30 per cent stake. 

 Kenwood would use the Victor brand to strengthen its own video and audio product line up, while a sale would complete a restructuring at Matsushita, the Nikkei said. 

 Struggling JVC has been one of the few sources of concern for Matsushita, which is otherwise enjoying blistering demand for its flat screen TVs and digital cameras. 

 As a pioneer of VHS-format video cassette recorders, JVC once held a strong position in consumer electronics, but new technology and intensifying competition has eroded profits. 

 The company incurred a 30.6-billion-yen group net loss for the year ended March 31. 

 While JVC and Kenwood have not reached an agreement, one possibility is a business integration under a joint holding company to be set up by the two firms, into which Matsushita would sell its shares, Nikkei said. 

 Another proposal calls for JVC executives to acquire the shares from Matsushita through a management buy-out with Cerberus providing the necessary funds, and JVC and Cerberus are likely to present their idea to Matsushita as early as Monday, Nikkei said.

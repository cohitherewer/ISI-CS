The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 SPS gears up to tap market 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 6: Calcutta-based SPS Group plans to go public in the next couple of months. It will garner around Rs 70 crore to fund its foray into power.

 The date, price band and other details would be worked out in a meeting next month.

 The decision to go public was prompted by our business expansion needs, especially our foray into power and the transformer and transmission tower building business. We expect to raise around Rs 70 crore, SPS Group chairman Bipin Vohra said.

 The group makes TMT bars for construction. It would now enter the power business after having acquired Indo American Electricals Limited for Rs 6 crore.

 SPS would resume the transformer wire business of Indo American and follow it up with a Bankura project to construct transformers and transmission towers worth Rs 50 crore.

 The company is also building a Rs 900-crore integrated steel plant with a capacity of 1 million tonnes at Jharsuguda in Orissa.

 Buying fuels bounce-back

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, March 10: The equity markets today gathered momentum following a powerful bout of buying by both foreign and domestic financial institutions. The BSE sensex, led by technology and banking shares, hit a new historic peak of 10,782.34, before settling at an all time closing high of 10765.16 ? a massive gain of 191.62 points.

 The 30-share sensex lost 216.82 points on Wednesday. But it somewhat recovered the lost ground on Thursday by gaining 64.69 points. The price furore on Friday allayed the anxiety among investors caused by the huge offloading witnessed on Wednesday.

 Market participants feel that the current value of stocks still look reasonable and attractive as the economy is growing at over 8 per cent a year.

 The sensex opened on a firm note at 10581.64 vis-?-vis Thursdays close of 10573.54 as mutual funds and foreign institutional investors (FIIs) made hectic purchases. The price rally gathered pace as the day progressed, taking the bellwether market index to a new intra-day peak of 10782.34. Later, it finished at 10765.16, revealing a steep rise of 191.62 points, or 1.81 per cent over its previous close.

 There is a lot of interest in equities. While the FIIs continue to buy the India growth story, mutual funds, who have made record collections, also joined the party. The key thing is that there is enough liquidity and it is chasing something which is reasonably priced, said a portfolio manager with a leading brokerage.

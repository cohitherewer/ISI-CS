 PM rues lack of verve in steel show

 Burnpur, Dec. 24: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today criticised the countrys industrial climate, which he feels is stifling the growth of the domestic iron and steel industry.

 The chief architect of the countrys economic liberalisation cited the example of steel king of the world Lakshmi Mittal, who started his career from Bengal and has now become the largest steel maker in the world without producing a kilo of steel in India.

 Others like Tata group chairman Ratan Tata are also scouting abroad for opportunities. Tata plans to buy Anglo-Dutch Corus to establish global presence even though India has one of the lowest per capita consumption of steel and has rich mineral reserves, he said.

 Why is it that so many Indians do so well when their enterprise and creativity are allowed to blossom? Why is that they choose foreign shores for growth and expansion rather than their home turf? Singh asked.

 He wondered whether it was our industrial environment, our procedures, our bureaucracy and red tape that entrepreneurs shun domestic opportunity.

 His comments gain significance in the wake of the red tape that is plaguing the steel industry, which wants to cash in on the abundance of iron ore reserves.

 A number of committees have been set up to streamline the mine allocation policy. Yet no clear guidelines have emerged so far.

 As a result, greenfield capacities planned by the Tatas, Mittals, Jindals and Korean company Posco are hanging fire.

 It cannot be business as usual any more. We have to give up our chalta hai laid back attitude, Singh said while flagging off the IISCO modernisation programme at Burnpur today.

 The Prime Minister was worried over the flight of capital from the country.

 Today, the steel consumption in China is 10 times that of India. We have to move fast, move quickly and move efficiently to catch up with our neighbours in east Asia, Singh said.

 Indias steel capacity was 40 million tonnes last financial year and is expected to go up 110 mt by 2020 according to the National Steel Policy.

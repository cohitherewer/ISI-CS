 Reliance stuns all with numbers

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, April 27: Reliance Industries, the countrys largest private sector company, left the Cassandras sputtering over their forecasts after reporting a 9 per cent increase in net profit at Rs 2,502 crore for the fourth quarter ended March 31.

 Analysts were biting the dust after projecting a slump in fourth-quarter profits for the Rs 81,924-crore goliath, which became the first Indian company to report a net profit of over $2 billion. It also announced a 100 per cent dividend, taking the payout to Rs 1,394 crore

 Turnover on a standalone basis for 2005-06 rose 22 per cent to Rs 89,124 crore and net profit surged 20 per cent to Rs 9,069 crore. The consolidated net profit of RIL (after taking into account the results of its subsidiaries and associates) stood at Rs 9,398 crore for the year.

 The markets were surprised by the strong financials and the stock spurted to a 52-week high of Rs 1,013 on the Bombay Stock Exchange before dipping at close to Rs 996.50. RIL was the top-traded share on the BSE where 38.21 lakh shares were traded, resulting in a turnover of Rs 381.36 crore.

 Reliance reported its highest ever gross refining margin of $10.3 per barrel, up from little over $8 per barrel last year ? at a time when world refining margins have been steadily falling. The company said while refinery margins were robust in all the regions, Singapore complex margins averaged $6.2 per barrel compared with $7.2 per barrel in the previous year.

 Their refinery margins were stronger than expected. One of the main reason behind this may be that Reliance could have booked crude oil at a better price, said Raj Gandhi, oil and petrochemical analyst at Angel Broking, who had expected RILs profits to fall by 1.3 per cent during the quarter.

 Reliance here explained that its Jamnagar refinery processed heavy crudes that delivered superior returns. The company added that exports of refined products touched $5.9 billion.

 Chairman and managing director Mukesh Ambani said, It has been a very good year in an extremely challenging environment. We took several strategic steps to enhance and distribute wealth to our shareholders. What is even more gratifying is the growth in our profits from a little over $1 billion to over $2 billion in a span of just 24 months. We are now investing in each of our businesses to achieve substantial earnings growth in the future and create further value for millions of our shareholders. 

 While net turnover of RIL rose 23 per cent to Rs 81,211 crore from Rs 66,051 crore, RIL said this rise was on account of a one per cent increase in sales volume and 22 per cent increase in selling price of its products. However, other income decreased to Rs 683 crore from Rs 1450 crore. This decrease was on account of non-receipt of dividends on preference shares of Reliance Infocomm which were converted to equity shares with effect from April 1, 2005.

 Reliance recorded a 92 per cent capacity utilisation at its Jamnagar Refinery. The refinery processed 30.47 million tonnes of crude during the year. Capacity utilisation was lower due to scheduled shutdown in October-November 2005 for maintenance. Adjusted for the refinery shutdown, the unit operated at 96 per cent.

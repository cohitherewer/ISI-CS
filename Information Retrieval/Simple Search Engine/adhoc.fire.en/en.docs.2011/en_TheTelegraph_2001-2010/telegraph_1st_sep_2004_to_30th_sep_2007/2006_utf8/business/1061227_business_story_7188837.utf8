 Godavari gas at market rates

 New Delhi, Dec. 26 (PTI): Natural gas from the D6 block of Reliance Industries and the adjoining field of ONGC in Krishna Godavari (KG) basin may fetch a minimum price of $4.50 per million British thermal unit (mbtu).

 The oil ministry-appointed committee for formulation of transparent guidelines for natural gas pricing has recommended that valuation of natural gas is done based on most recent competitively-determined price in the region.

 For the gas from Reliances KG-DWN-98/3 and ONGCs KG-DWN/98/2, the $4.50 per mbtu price currently charged for gas from Cairn India-operated Ravva satellite field in the KG basin might become the benchmark, official sources said.

 The $4.50-per-mbtu price is 92 per cent higher than the $2.34 per mbtu proposed by Reliance to sell gas to state-run NTPC Ltd and an Anil Ambani group firm through separate contracts. The price for Reliance Natural Resources Ltd, an Anil Ambani group firm, was rejected by the ministry for lack of transparency while the NTPC price is yet to reach the ministry for approval. Sources said the price of gas from Ravva satellite field may go up to $5 per mbtu in 2009, when D6 reaches peak output of 80 million standard cubic meters per day and ONGC begins gas production.

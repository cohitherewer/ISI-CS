 VeriFone to buy rival Lipman for $793m

 New order

 New York, April 10 (Reuters): VeriFone Holdings Inc said on Monday it reached a cash and stock deal worth $793 million to acquire rival electronic payment systems maker Lipman Electronic Engineering Ltd.

 Under terms of the deal, which VeriFone expects to close by October 31, Lipman shareholders will receive for each Lipman share 0.5 shares of VeriFone common stock and $14.30 in cash, adjusted for a special dividend. The amount of the special dividend, yet to be finalised, will likely exceed $23 million, VeriFone said.

 VeriFone said it expects the transaction to be accretive to analysts current estimates for its fiscal 2007 net income.

 The deal is subject to approval by shareholders of both companies and customary regulatory approvals.

 Following completion of the acquisition, VeriFone said it will continue to trade on the New York Stock Exchange and will be dual listed on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange.

 Shares of Israel-based Lipman rose nearly 6 per cent in Tel Aviv one day last month on a report that it was in talks to be acquired by VeriFone. Lipman neither confirmed nor denied the report at the time.

 In its financial year ended October 31, 2005, VeriFone reported a net revenue of $485.4 million. Lipmans revenue in the financial year ended December 31, 2005, was $235.4 million.

 Lehman Brothers acted as financial advisor to VeriFone on the acquisition. Merrill Lynch acted as financial advisor to Lipman.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Oriental Bank bottomline up 12% 

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi/ Calcutta, Jan. 23: The Oriental Bank of Commerce (OBC) has posted a 12.31 per cent rise in net profit at Rs 143.42 crore for the quarter ended December 31 compared with Rs 127.70 crore in the corresponding previous quarter.

 Chairman and managing director K.N. Prithviraj attributed the low profit to an increase in operating expenses after payment of wage arrears and a rise in rent and taxes. Profit dropped because of re-pricing of loans in line with the market scenario, he added.

 However, during the first nine months of the current fiscal, the banks net profit declined to Rs 352.22 crore from Rs 523.11 crore in the year-ago period. The figure has factored in the accumulated losses of Global Trust Bank (GTB), which was merged with OBC in 2002.

 During the period, the bank has recovered Rs 495 crore, thus reducing gross NPA from Rs 2,492.27 crore in March 2005 to Rs 2,339.43 crore in December.

 The capital adequacy ratio in December stood at 12.98 per cent against 9.40 per cent in December 2004.

 Investments have recorded a marginal growth to Rs 19,231.17 crore in December from Rs 19,195.58 crore in the year-ago period.

 West Coast earnings

 Backed by upward revision of prices, West Coast Paper Mills has posted a 107 per cent rise in net profit for the quarter ended December 31.

 During the period, sales went up 18 per cent, while earnings per share increased from Rs 5.72 to Rs 11.82.

 During October and November, the firm managed to increase prices of paper/ paper board and duplex board.

 This helped the company absorb the hike in cost of production, pushed up by increased raw material cost and power and fuel costs.

 During October-December, net sales rose from Rs 113.67 crore to Rs 133.81 crore on a like-to-like basis. Net profit increased from Rs 5.11 crore to Rs 10.56 crore.

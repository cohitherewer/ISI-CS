 PSU banks weigh late bid

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Dec. 9: Even as the respective boards of ICICI and Sangli Bank approved the proposal for a merger, a few public sector banks could approach the Reserve Bank of India to make a late bid to acquire Sangli Bank. If they do, the bank unions are planning to support them to the hilt.

 The merger of Sangli Bank with ICICI Bank is subject to the Reserve Bank of Indias approval. 

 The All India Banking Employees Association (AIBEA), which has been battling public sector bank managements over various issues in the past, has decided to support any move by them to acquire the old private sector bank. There is a small rider: the acquiring bank should be a Maharashtra-based public sector bank.

 The AIBEA is rooting for banks like Union Bank of India, Bank of Maharashtra, Bank of Baroda and Dena Bank all headquartered in Mumbai. Also in the fray is Bangalore-based Canara Bank.

 We are going all out to support these banks. Except for Bank of Maharashtra, none of them has strong networks in the areas of Maharashtra where Sangli Bank mainly operates Sangli, Kolhapur, Satara, and Pune, said Vishwas Hutgi, AIBEA spokesman in Mumbai.

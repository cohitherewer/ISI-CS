 Auto show set to roll

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 11: Auto expo 2006, billed as Asia?s largest automobile show, is set to roll. Both domestic and global auto companies will launch various models at the event.

 The show has been jointly organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry, Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers and the Automotive Component Manufacturers Association of India.

 Besides providing a huge platform for automobile companies to showcase their products, the expo will be a good platform for the component industry. 

 ?The response is enormous and we expect business deals, $55 million in the 2004 show, to cross $100 million this time,? said a senior CII official.

 Auto component manufacturers, who will occupy as much as 60 per cent of the total 70,000-square-meter space, have increased their participation by nearly 40-50 per cent.

 Companies that will participate from the auto component sector include TVS Group, Kalyani Group, Pricol, Goetze, Talbros Group, Essar Steel, Subros and Amtek.

 The auto industry is lobbying for flexibility in labour laws to maintain growth momentum. ?There is a lot of rigidity in Indian labour laws, which are archaic and outdated. These need to be changed soon,? said SIAM president Madhur Bajaj.

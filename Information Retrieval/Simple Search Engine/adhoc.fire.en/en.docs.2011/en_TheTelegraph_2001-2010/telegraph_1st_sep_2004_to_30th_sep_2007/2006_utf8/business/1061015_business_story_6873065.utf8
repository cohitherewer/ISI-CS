 Mallya in Scotland to pursue whisky deal

 Mallya: Moving in

 London, Oct. 14 (Reuters): Vijay Mallya is in Scotland for talks with Whyte amp; Mackay, which may lead to his making a bid for the 600-million ($1.1 billion) whisky distiller.

 Mallya, who owns drinks-to-airline conglomerate UB, will meet Whyte amp; Mackays chairman and majority shareholder Vivian Imerman at the distillers central Scotland bottling plant in Grangemouth for wide-ranging talks, sources said.

 Mallya reached Scotland on Friday.

 Earlier this week, South Africa-born businessman Imerman said he was evaluating more than one unsolicited bid that may lead to the sale of part of the business, the whole of the business, or a strategic alliance.

 The talks could concern a strategic alliance or distribution deal as well as the sale of part or whole of Whyte amp; Mackay, the sources added. 

 A Whyte amp; Mackay spokesperson did not comment on the nature of the talks in Scotland.

 These talks between Vijay Mallya and Vivian Imerman are continuing to evaluate the strategic options for Whyte amp; Mackay, she said. Imerman has said the Scottish whisky group, which makes Whyte amp; Mackay blended scotch together with Isle of Jura and Dalmore single malt whiskies, is valued at 600 million, and it was in talks with UB in addition to others over bids for the group.

 The valuation of Whyte amp; Mackay, which was sold for only 208 million in 2001 to a group of investors, including Imerman, includes 200 million worth of aged whisky stocks, the sources said.

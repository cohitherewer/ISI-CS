 Farm flourishes on rain god blessing

 Seeds of fortune

 New Delhi, Feb. 27: The farm sector has stopped being the party pooper: its expected to record a healthy 2.3 per cent growth in the year to March 2006 and farm output is projected to increase by 5 million tonnes to 209 million tonnes.

 The farm sectors turnaround is being attributed to a change in the rainfall pattern from an erratic to near normal distribution, according to the Economic Survey released here today.

 Erratic rainfall has been blamed for the less than 1 per cent growth in the farm sector in 2004-05.

 Farm sector growth has yo-yoed in the past few years from minus 6.9 per cent in 2002-03 to 10 per cent in 2003-04 ? and these are the first signs that the sector is getting its act together.

 The survey spoke of the need to develop alternative markets for better crop diversification and broad-based agriculture development in future. The market for farm output continues to depend heavily on expensive government procurement and distribution system. A shift from the current MSP and public procurement system is needed, said the survey.

 It also called for improving bank credit conditions for higher profits, better marketing and thrust on futures trading. Indian agriculture suffers from low yields per hectare, volatility in production and wide disparities of productivity over regions and crops.

 A bias in agriculture price support policy in favour of foodgrains in the past may have distorted cropping pattern and input usage may require corrections, it said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Great prices await magic cuppa

 SOHINI MOOKHERJEA

 Calcutta, May 12: The second flush crop is expected to bring good times to tea prices. 

 Supply is weak as north Indian tea growing regions have experienced a poor harvest during April and early May.

 The supply crunch and the rise in prices will become apparent within the next two to three weeks.

 ?The existing circumstances coupled with the need to replenish stocks at auction centres, distributors or retailers across the country will raise prices of both CTC and orthodox tea and the market is expected to stay buoyant over the next couple of months,? said Amit Chowdhuri, chairman and managing director of J Thomas amp; Company.

 Industry experts point out that the market for the peak non-quality tea has moved up due to the supply crunch.

 Big players usually don?t shop at the first flush tea auctions as the variety has a low shelf life. Moreover, more than 70 per cent of the Darjeeling first flush is sold privately or exported directly by the growers.

 According to J Thomas figures, the average price of north Indian CTC leaf at Calcutta, Siliguri and Guwahati auctions combined was Rs 68.08 per kg for April 2005, Rs 63.54 per kg for May and Rs 69.71 per kg for June.

 Tea production in Darjeeling is likely to be down 25 per cent and even 50 per cent in certain gardens in March-April 2006. 

 Despite sporadic showers, gardens in the Dooars and Terai region have experienced a drop of 35 to 50 per cent in the same period. The first flush season took a hit due to the dry spell since February. 

 Upper Assam has experienced abnormally high rainfall in the recent past, which is bad for the tea crop.

 Industry experts feel the prices this year would be much higher during the second flush period and even when the market settles down by September 2006.

 The average price per kg last year at the Calcutta auctions was Rs 65.38 per kg for CTC, Rs 75.07 per kg for orthodox and Rs 148.77 per kg for Darjeeling.

 The price correction has started, especially in the private buying process and the recently concluded auctions.

 The second flush tea has a strong demand both in the export and domestic market.

 Drought in Kenya will increase the demand for Indian CTC. Production in March has increased to 19.8 million kg in Kenya, however, the drop of 35.3 million kg in the January to March 2006 period lead to a global shortfall of CTC tea.

 Kenyan export volumes were down 15.7 per cent between January and March this year but the unit price was up 15 per cent compared with last year.

 The Calcutta auctions last year for CTC leaf fetched an average price of Rs 75.73 per Kg in April, Rs 64.95 per Kg in May and Rs 76.33 per Kg in June 2005.

 The auctions bounced back after 

 a near deadlock and interruption for a week with regard 

 to the hike in brokerage fees.

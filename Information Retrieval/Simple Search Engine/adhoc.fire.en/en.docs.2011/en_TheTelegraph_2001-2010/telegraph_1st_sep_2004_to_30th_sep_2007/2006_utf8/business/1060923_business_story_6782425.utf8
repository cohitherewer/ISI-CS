 Price cut too little for tyre dealers

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 22: Tyre dealers are up in arms against manufacturers despite a partial rollback in tyre prices. The manufacturers have on an average cut prices by 3.5-4 per cent.

 After a lot of agitation, tyre manufacturers have cut prices. But it is grossly insufficient in relation to reduction in the cost of input, said S.P. Singh, convenor of All India Tyre Dealers Federation.

 Manufacturers who have slashed tyre prices include Apollo Tyres, JK Tyres, Ceat, Birla and Goodyear Tyres. These companies have brought down the prices of truck radials, bus tyres and light commercial vehicle tyres.

 The demand from our side was to roll back tyre prices to the January 2006 level. The prices should be brought down by 20-25 per cent, the federation said in its submission to Kamal Nath, Union minister of commerce and industry.

 In his meeting with the association a few days back, the minister assured the dealers that he would sort out the matter with the manufacturers.

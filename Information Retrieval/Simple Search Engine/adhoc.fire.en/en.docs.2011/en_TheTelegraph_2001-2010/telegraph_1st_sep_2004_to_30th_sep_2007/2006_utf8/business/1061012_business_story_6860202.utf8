 One more ADS in queue

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Oct. 11: Infosys Technologies Ltd today announced that it plans to come out with its third sponsored American depository share (ADS) offering.

 The size of the ADS offering is not known. The company said it would consist of a maximum of 30 million equity shares. The board of directors cleared the ADS plan today and said it would be placed with Japanese investors through a Public Offer Without Listing (POWL).

 The board has convened an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) of the shareholders of the company on November 7 to seek approval for the offering and expects the process to be completed thereafter.

 While all shareholders will be eligible to offer their equity shares in the offering, Infosys clarified that it will not be issuing any new shares in the offering and that the underwriters will determine the price of the ADS being sold. 

 The proceeds from the offering, after meeting the expenses, will be proportionately paid to the selling shareholders.

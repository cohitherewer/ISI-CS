 Bounce-back after meltdown

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Sept. 12: The stock market today bounced back from the heavy battering it received yesterday with the sensex ending the day with a gain of 110.10 points at 11660.79. 

 According to the dealers, strong data on industrial production for July 2006 at 12.4 per cent against 4.7 per cent for the month last year helped the recovery. 

 Though starting on a high at 11564.95 against yesterdays close of 11550.69, the 30-share bellwether index yo-yoed between the days high of 11671.80 and a low of 11444.18, before setting with a gain of 0.95 per cent. The major support came in the latter part of the trading session. 

 The relief in the stock market saw the rupee recovering against the US dollar, ending at 46.28 per dollar, higher than the previous close of Rs 46.31. 

 Banking and technology shares led the rally with most of the scrips in the sectors finishing with sharp to moderate gains. 

 Index heavyweights, including Reliance Industries, TCS, Infosys and SBI, led the rally. The trading volume stood at Rs 3,401.29 crore on the Bombay Stock Exchange compared with Rs 3406.61 crore yesterday. 

 Each fall in the stock market to the level of 11500 and below will provide buying opportunities for stocks in sectors like banking, IT and cement as was witnessed in todays trading session, said a portfolio manager. The BSE bankex was the highest gainer amongst the indices and rose by 99.38 points or 1.90 per cent to close at 5336.46, while the BSE-IT index flared up by 77.21 points or 1.86 per cent to close at 4223.81. 

Foreign institutional investors had bought shares 

to the tune of Rs 94.70 crore on Monday compared with Fridays sales of Rs 

48.90 crore. The sensex meltdown yesterday was largely because of the large sales 

they had pressed in the derivatives segment during the last two trading sessions 

of the previous week.

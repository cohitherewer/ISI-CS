 Q amp;A

 Mutually yours

 Would you please confirm whether the entry load and the premium over and above the face value of an equity-linked savings scheme (ELSS) of a mutual fund are also eligible for tax relief under section 80C of the income tax act? 

 Tapan Chakraborty, Calcutta 

 Investments in ELSS of mutual funds up to Rs 1 lakh is deductible from total income under section 80C. And this deduction doesnt distinguish between entry load and premium over and above the face value of the units. One can invest Rs 1 lakh either in an ongoing ELSS or in a new fund offer and can claim tax deduction on the entire amount as permissible under the aforementioned section of the income tax act. 

 Home truth

 In view of the changes brought about in personal income tax in the Finance Act 2005, I would like to know whether the standard deduction of 30 per cent from income from house rent on account of repairs is still admissible in 2005-06? Are investments in PPF, NSC, along with reinvestment of the accrued interest, allowed for deduction from gross income in the assessment year 2006-07?

 Satish Chandra Dutta, Karimganj

 Yes, you will be eligible to claim standard deduction up to 30 per cent of rental income from a let-out property towards repairs and maintenance. The provision has not been tampered with. PPF and NSC are investment instruments covered under section 80C. Even the reinvestment of accrued interest in such investments are tax deductible under the said section but within the overall limit of Rs 1 lakh.

 Taxing times 

 I am a 69-year old pensioner. After deduction of permissible rebates my income never exceeds the taxable limits. Do I have to file income tax returns? Till now I have been filing it regularly. Is there any provision for senior citizens? 

 N. Sarkar, Calcutta

 If ones taxable income doesnt cross the threshold income limit fixed for senior citizens, that is Rs 1,85,000 a year, the person does not need to file IT returns. But since you have been filing returns, you will have to continue to do so. There are no special provisions for senior citizens in this regard.

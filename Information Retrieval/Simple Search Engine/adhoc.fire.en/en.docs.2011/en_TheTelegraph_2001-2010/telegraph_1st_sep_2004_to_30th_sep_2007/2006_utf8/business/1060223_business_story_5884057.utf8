 Novartis centre for OTC drugs

 Mumbai, Feb. 22 (Reuters): Swiss healthcare group Novartis AG on Wednesday opened a global research and development centre for its over-the-counter (OTC) operations in India, and said it would expand its presence as the regulatory environment improved.

 With 38 scientists in the laboratory in Thane, near Mumbai, the centre will supply key European and US markets, Novartis officials said. We needed to be in India because of the skills and talent available here, said Jorge Insuasty, global R amp;D head of OTC. The centre will supply our global OTC pipeline, and we will dedicate more resources as business grows.

 OTC makes up about 10 per cent of Novartis global sales, and Novartis has a strong presence in OTC treatments for coughs and colds, allergies, smoking cessation, gastrointestinal disorders, dermal infections and nutritional supplements.

 To achieve more critical mass in the US market, Novartis last year paid $660 million for the rights to produce and market Bristol-Myers Squibbs North American OTC products

 Globally, OTC is growing at 3 to 4 per cent annually, while it is growing at more than 5 per cent a year in India. Growth is also above the global average in markets like Russia and China, said Larry Allgaier, CEO of Novartis OTC.

 The healthcare business should do better this year on the top line and the bottom line, he said, in response to a question on whether the company expects to post better earnings. OTC is a very competitive market, but we dont see undue pressure on margins this year.

 Novartis invested about $4.8 billion in R amp;D across all its businesses last year, and said it may move more development work to India as the regulatory environment improves.

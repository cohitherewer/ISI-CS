 Capacity hike tops JSW Steel priority

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Jan. 20: JSW Steel will spend Rs 6000 crore to expand its plant capacity and set up a cold-rolling mill. 

 On the funding pattern of the steel expansion capacity, Rs 2,000 crore of the proposed Rs 5,000-crore investment plan would be financed through internal accruals and the rest Rs 3,000 crore would be raised by way of debt in the international or domestic market.

 JSW Steel today informed the bourses that its board has approved the issue of shares with warrants on a rights basis to its shareholders. The total amount it plans to raise by way of the rights issue (excluding the amount of equity issue pursuant to conversion of warrants) will be less than Rs 400 crore. 

 According to the company, the issue proceeds will be used to part-finance the one-million-tonne cold-rolling mill project proposed to be set up at its manufacturing unit in Karnataka at an estimated project cost of Rs 1000 crore.

 While one equity share and warrant will be issued to shareholders holding 8 equity shares on the record date, JSW Steel said each warrant will entitle the holder to apply for one equity share.

 JSW Steel is expanding capacity of its pellet plant from 4.20 million tonnes to 5 million tonnes and is also modernising its hot strip mill. The company is expanding the capacity of its steel plant to 3.8 million tonnes from 2.5 million tonnes.

 These projects are likely to be operational in phases by the first quarter of 2006-2007 because of which the company will continue to have significant volume growth in the next fiscal, JSW Steel said.

 After completing the projects, it will have a 3.8-million-tonne integrated steel plant with state-of-the-art facilities and value-added products contributing significantly to the bottomline. 

 Moreover, in view of the buoyancy in economy and an expected surge in steel demand, JSW Steel is planning to expand the capacity of its steel plant to 7 million tonnes from 3.8 million tonnes, which it says, will add further impetus to volume growth in 2007-08 and 2008-09 at an estimated cost of Rs 5000 crore.

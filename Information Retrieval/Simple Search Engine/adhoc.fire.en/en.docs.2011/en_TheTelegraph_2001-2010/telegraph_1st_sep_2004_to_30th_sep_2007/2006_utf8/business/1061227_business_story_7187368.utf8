 Telecom FDI rule delayed again

 JAYATI GHOSE

 Close watch

 New Delhi, Dec. 26: The government has decided against coming out with new guidelines for foreign direct investment (FDI) in telecom rightaway. This follows the defence ministrys objections to the proposal to allow foreign companies to oversee their network in India from a remote location in another country. 

 According to senior officials, although the department maintains that the guidelines are being drafted, the real stumbling block remains security concerns over clauses in earlier drafts. 

 The government last week passed the buck on this issue to a group of ministers. This new draft guideline will, among other things, specifically deal with remote access of public switch telephone network (PSTN). Once this is done, the GoM will come back to the cabinet for further discussion and approval.

 According to industry analysts, The current delay in implementation of FDI norms is a bureaucratic trap, rather than a genuine effort to formulate a concrete telecom policy. 

 The department of telecom (DoT) has taken into account every possible objection raised by various ministries, industries and intelligence agencies while preparing the latest cabinet note on foreign investment in telecom, they added.

 According to sources, all ministries are now comfortable with the proposal to allow expats to be appointed as the chairman, managing director or the chief executive officer of an Indian telecom company. 

 However, the defence ministry seems to have once again raised the issue of security if foreign companies are allowed remote access to equipment used by Indian service providers. The ministry feels such an access could compromise the countrys security as telecom is a vulnerable sector.

 Keeping in mind the security issue, DoT had proposed that foreign companies be allowed remote access to their networks in India only after taking prior approval of the government. 

 It had also added a stringent clause that remote access can only be provided to telecom equipment suppliers or manufacturers and the parents or affiliates of the licensee company. 

 Moreover, designated security agencies in India would monitor the process through suitable technical devices that would throw up a mirror image of the remote access information being shared. 

 According to the DoT, important data pertaining to key ministries and the government would be sent through a secured network so that even if the remote access centre is outside the country, official data would not be revealed to a third party.

 The department had sought to allow telecom firms to appoint foreign citizens as chairman, managing director, chief executive officer and chief financial officer. However, there is a rider that such appointees would have to seek security clearance from the home ministry. The clearance would have to be renewed every year. 

 To appease the security concerns raised by intelligence agencies, DoT had said that the chief officer in charge of technical network operations and the chief security officer should be a resident Indian citizen. 

 This meant that the post of chief technical officers would be reserved for Indian citizens. 

 A majority of directors on the board would also have to be resident Indian citizens. 

 Regarding objections raised by outsourcing firms, DoT had said that the security guidelines would not be applicable to other service providers (OSPs) like call centres, BPOs, tele-marketing and tele-education companies registered with the DoT. 

 The logic behind it is that since OSPs operate the service using infrastructure provided by telecom companies, they need not separately enforce security guidelines.

 While foreign investment levels were raised from 49 per cent to 74 in November last year and a press note to this effect issued on November 3, 2005, conflicting interests within the government have deferred the implementation of the policy now for the fourth time. 

 The current date of implementing FDI in telecom policy has been set for April 1, 2007.

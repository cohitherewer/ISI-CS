 Mukesh taps Unilever man 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Feb. 11: Gunender Kapur, a Unilever honcho, is all set to join Mukesh Ambanis retailing venture.

 The buzz is that Kapur, who currently heads Unilevers operations in Nigeria, will head the food and grocery division of Reliance Industries retailing venture.

 Kapur was the youngest-ever director at Hindustan Lever and was a member of the managing committee during M. S. Bangas reign. He was the executive director (foods) at Hindustan Lever (HLL) before moving on to head the parents operations in Nigeria as its vice-chairman and chief executive officer. 

 Kapur will be the first Lever executive to join a Reliance group company.When contacted, an HLL official said he wasnt aware of Kapurs decision to quit Unilever.

 Mukesh Ambani has already made strong strides in the area of retailing ? one of the designated free business areas in the non-compete agreement with younger scion, Anil Ambani. Under the pact, the group that enters one of these free business areas will get exclusive control over the turf for a period of 10 years.RILs investment into retail has been the subject of discussion for over a year. 

 Last month, the company announced plans to invest $750 million in setting up a network of hypermarkets, supermarkets, convenience stores and speciality stores across the country. The retail plan is likely to be rolled out by September this year.

 Arcelor terms for rethink on Mittal bid

 Luxembourg, April 28 (AP): Arcelor, the European steel giant that is the target of a takeover bid by Mittal Steel, told its shareholders today it would reconsider the offer if it were made exclusively in cash.

 If Mittal made an offer exclusively in cash, the board of directors would of course reconsider its position against the bid, Arcelor chairman Joseph Kinsch said at the groups annual general meeting here.

 We are not at all stopping Mittal from improving its offer. If this is the case, the shareholders will study it and decide whether or not to tender their shares, he said.

 Kinsch also said Arcelor had no plans to launch a share capital increase solely with a view to making the hostile takeover bid from Mittal Steel more expensive.

 The board of directors will take no measure whose aim is to scupper Mittals offer, he told the gathering.

 It does not intend to launch a capital increase with the only goal of countering an offer, although he maintained that a capital hike could be launched in order to pursue a value-creating industrial project.

 Arcelor is actively examining alternative strategies. Numerous opportunities are open to the company and its shareholders.

 Arcelors board has repeatedly said it would refuse Mittals $23-billion cash and share bid in its current form. 

 Meanwhile, threats by minority shareholders to oust Kinsch evaporated as the 74-year-old was re-elected for another two years to a round of applause at the steelmakers annual meeting. Kinsch promised it would be his last term and there would be no trouble over his succession.

 He said Arcelors board of directors acted within its mandate to protect one of its most important assets when it shifted Dofasco Inc to a separate trust to prevent Mittal from selling off the company if the takeover was successful.

 The board of directors had to adopt quick measures to avoid a heavy loss of value for the group and the shareholders, he said at the meeting.

 A minority shareholder said the board would have had tremendous support for the move but it had lost credibility when it failed to consult all the shareholders.

 Most of the companys capital is fragmented into small stakes and a 20 per cent threshold is needed to submit motions to the board, which, Kinsch said, he was prepared to reconsider.

 Kinsch and CEO Guy Dolle took sideswipes at Mittal and its corporate governance.

 Arcelor considers that the corporate governance of Mittal is neither open nor transparent, a fatal flaw when 75 per cent of the offer is made up of Mittal shares, Kinsch said. Arcelor has been pursuing a different strategy from Mittal and does not feel that the two groups are compatible.

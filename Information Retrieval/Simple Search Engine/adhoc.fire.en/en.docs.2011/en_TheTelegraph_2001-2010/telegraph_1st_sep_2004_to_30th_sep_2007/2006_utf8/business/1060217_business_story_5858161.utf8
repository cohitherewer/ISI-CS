 EU bid to pacify Nath

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Nath: Fair play

 New Delhi, Feb. 16: European Union (EU) trade commissioner Peter Mandelson has assured commerce minister Kamal Nath that he would look into the complaint about Lakshmi Mittal being prevented from acquiring Luxembourg-based Arcelor.

 EU trade commissioner Peter Mandelson spoke to me yesterday after receiving my letter and said he would take up the issue with the European Commission, Nath said.

 In his letter, the commerce minister had pointed out that attempts to thwart Mittals bid violated the EUs commitment to the WTO accord, which provides for national treatment to cross-border investment.

 Meanwhile, Luxembourg authorities have said merchant banker Morgan Stanley has been appointed to study Mittals $22.3-billion offer to buy Arcelor.

 Nath had taken up the issue after seeing the reactions of the French authorities to the bid.

 The French government should not have intervened in the matter as it should have been dealt appropriately by shareholders and industry analysts, Nath said on the sidelines of the inauguration of the handicraft and gifts fair at Greater Noida.

 The bid has sparked objections from the governments of France, Luxembourg and Spain. Labour unions, who are worried about job losses, have also protested the move.

 In his letter, Nath had reminded Mandelson that the EU had made a similar request to India that such cross-border investments should be provided national treatment on a reciprocal basis.

 Nath had pointed out that Mittals bid was covered under the provision for cross-border investment getting national treatment.

 Whatever is happening does not seem to be in consonance with the letter and spirit of WTO negotiations as India would like to see national treatment accorded to all cross-border investments, he said.

 It impinges upon the ongoing WTO services negotiations. We view it with serious concern, his letter had stated.

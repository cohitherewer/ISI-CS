 Mittal bid to derail Arcelor deal

 Mittal: Picks up the gauntlet

 May 29 (Agencies): Mittal Steel is racing to arrange support among Arcelor SA shareholders for a special meeting aimed at derailing Arcelors proposed combination with Russian steelmaker Severstal, according to a news report.

 Goldman Sachs group, Mittals financial adviser, must gain the support of at least 20 per cent of Arcelor shareholders to convene an extraordinary meeting at which the Severstal deal would be subject to debate and approval, The Wall Street Journal reported on its website yesterday, citing people familiar with the situation.

 Arcelor and Severstal are also making efforts to convince investors about the merits of the deal.

 Arcelor CEO Guy Dolle and Russian billionaire Alexey Mordashov, CEO of Severstal, will fly to London tomorrow to persuade investors of the merits of Arcelors proposed 13-billion euro acquisition of Severstal, aimed at derailing Mittal Steels hostile bid. 

 Arcelor, which has been battling a hostile bid from Mittal, announced the Severstal deal on Friday.

 If it succeeds, the new company would surpass Mittal in terms of revenue and production, becoming a global steel titan.

 Under the terms of the proposed transaction, Severstals controlling shareholder Mordashov will pay Arcelor $1.59 billion in cash and surrender his stake in all of Severstals steel assets and Italian steelmaker Lucchini Spa.

 In exchange, Mordashov will own 32 per cent of the enlarged Arcelor group. Existing shareholders will own the remaining 68 per cent.

 The merged companies would have a 6 per cent share of the global steel output ? 70 million tonnes annually ? and 124,000 employees.

 Mittal is offering about $33 billion for all of Arcelor, and the Arcelor deal with Severstal threatens to make Mittals bid far more precarious.

 Over the weekend, Goldman wrote to Arcelor chairman Joseph Kinsch, saying the companys decision to force the deal through unless shareholders reject it was unacceptable, according to a copy of the letter obtained by the newspaper.

 Severstal is seeking to eventually hold 45 per cent in the new company, a company official said today.

 Severstal spokeswoman Olga Antonova confirmed Mordashovs intentions to increase his stake in Arcelor from 32 per cent, but added that it could only happen after five years under the terms of the deal.

 Mordashov was earlier quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying that he wanted to increase my interest to 45 per cent, but only as long as this meets the interests of other shareholders and the regulators in Luxembourg.

 The news came as wrangling intensified for creating an international steel titan, and Mittal Steel reportedly sought to derail the Severstal-Arcelor merger.

 Mordashov said Arcelor was buying back 150 million of its own shares, after which they would be cancelled, thus raising his stake to 38.5 per cent. There was little sense in buying additional shares, they are very expensive, Mordashov was quoted by the Vedomosti business daily as saying.

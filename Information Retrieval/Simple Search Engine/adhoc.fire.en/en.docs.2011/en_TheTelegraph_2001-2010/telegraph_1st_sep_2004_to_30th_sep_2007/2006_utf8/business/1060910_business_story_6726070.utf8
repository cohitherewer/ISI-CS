 Polaris set to raise headcount

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hyderabad, Sept. 9: Polaris Software Lab, a global player in speciality application services for banking and financial sectors, is planning to raise its headcount by 1,200-1,800 in the next two years.

 Disclosing this at the launch of its first super speciality centre in Hyderabad today, Polaris chairman Arun Jain said, We are looking at a 30 per cent growth in revenues through this new facility.

 Andhra Pradesh chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy inaugurated the campus spread over 2 lakh sq ft and built at an investment of Rs 70 crore at the Manikonda information technology park.

 We have moved towards economics of expertise rather than the economics of mere cost arbitrage, Jain said.

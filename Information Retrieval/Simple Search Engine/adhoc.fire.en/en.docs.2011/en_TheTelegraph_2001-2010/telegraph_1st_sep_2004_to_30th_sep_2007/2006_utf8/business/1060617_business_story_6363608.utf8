 Ceat hikes tyre prices

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, June 16: Rising cost of natural rubber and carbon black has forced Ceat Ltd to hike product prices by 2-10 per cent. Consequently, truck, car and jeep tyres will now be costlier by Rs 200-1500 per pair.

 Ceat said in recent months the price of raw materials have gone up, which accounts for over 70 per cent of the production cost of tyres. The price of natural rubber has increased 30 per cent to Rs 120 per kg from Rs 90 per kg in May. Also, prices of carbon black have gone up by 25 per cent. 

 As a result, Ceats manufacturing cost has gone up by around 12 per cent.

 A price hike was essential to meet the manufacturing cost which has shot up. This will help us enhance the quality of our products and upgrade the technologies, said Arnab Banerjee, Ceat vice-president marketing and sales.

 Subsequent to the hike in truck tyres by 6-9 per cent and light truck by 6-10 per cent, truck tyres have become costlier by Rs 1,000-1,500 per pair, the company said. 

 A 3-6 per cent hike in car tyres will jack up their prices by Rs 100-200 per pair, it added.

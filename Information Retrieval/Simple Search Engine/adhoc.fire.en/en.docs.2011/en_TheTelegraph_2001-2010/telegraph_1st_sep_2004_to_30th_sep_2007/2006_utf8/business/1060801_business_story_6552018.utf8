 Reliance Comm back in black

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, July 31: Reliance Communications Ltd, the Anil Ambani group company, has reported profit for the first quarter of this fiscal. It had suffered a loss in the same period last year.

 The companys consolidated net profit stood at Rs 513 crore compared with the loss of Rs 250 crore in the first quarter of 2005-06. On a standalone basis, net profit was Rs 8.45 crore. 

 Consolidated revenues of the CDMA operator rose 42 per cent to Rs 3,250 crore from Rs 2,283 crore a year ago.

 The consolidated numbers are of Reliance Communications and its operating companies that include Reliance Infocomm Ltd, Reliance Communications Infrastructure Ltd, Reliance Telecom Ltd and FLAG Telecom Ltd. On a standalone basis, the income stood at Rs 23.14 crore for the quarter. The quarter saw strong growth in profitability across all business segments, including wireless, global and broadband. 

 I am delighted at the sustained improvement in profitability, and expect the strong business momentum to continue for the rest of the financial year, said Anil Ambani, chairman of Reliance Communications.

 The company said since it was in a pre-operative stage as on June 30, 2005, profit and loss account was not prepared for the period. Therefore, the figures relating to the quarter are not comparable.

 However, in the interests of better disclosure and to assist investors in understanding the overall performance of Reliance Communications, the consolidated numbers have been prepared as if the corporate reorganisation had been implemented for the quarter.

 These numbers are based on a prudent and conservative accounting methodology, whereby revenues during the quarter from free incoming lifetime plans have been deferred over a period of 48 months, it added.

 As on June 30, the company had 22.52 million wireless customers, representing a 20.6 per cent share of the Indian wireless market.

 Users for wireless multimedia services increased 24 per cent to 7.9 million from 6.4 million as on March 31. Revenues from the wireless business increased 15 per cent sequentially from Rs 2,120 crore to Rs. 2,432 crore.

 In the retail ILD business, Reliance Communications claimed that its Reliance India call franchise is posting a robust growth.

 Bengal first in ESI per capita benefit

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 6: Bengal has got a dubious distinction. The state tops the Employees State Insurance (ESI) chart for per capita cash benefits.

 ESI is a social security legislation that provides for medical care and cash benefits to factory workers. 

 The Bengal region has 6.53 lakh insured workers comprising 8.33 per cent of the total covered under the ESI scheme countrywide. Yet, the state accounts for 23 per cent of cash benefits under the scheme, said B.K. Sahu, additional commissioner and regional director, ESI Corporation.

 With a per capita cash benefit of Rs 987.24 as of 2004-05, Bengal tops the chart followed by Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu in that order. The national average for the year was Rs 361.29. ESICs per capita expenditure on cash benefit in Bengal was higher at Rs 1200.66 in 2002-03 and it has since been falling.

 The incidence of sickness benefit and temporary disablement benefit are also higher in the state compared with other states with more insured workers, Sahu added. He pointed out that Bengal accounts for 38 per cent of ESICs total sickness benefit and 41 per cent of temporary disablement benefit in 2004-05.

 According to the ESIC data, its per capita expenditure on medical benefit in Bengal was Rs 1031.77 in 2004-05 against the national average of Rs 982.18. Andhra Pradesh topped the list with Rs 1250.75.

 Interestingly, the incidence of sickness and disablement claims were much higher in ESIC branches having jute mill workers, Sahu said. While the monthly average incidence of sickness and disablement benefit in branches having other than jute mill workers is 1.21, it is 7.58 for those branches which have jute mill workers. This shows how cash benefits are exploited in jute mills, he added.

 After the Beetle, the bunny is back

 JERRY GARRETT

 Rabbit riddle 

 New York, Sept. 5: Volkswagen 

 gives the impression it was a last-minute thing, something 

 of an afterthought, to revive the Rabbit name almost as 

 arbitrarily as the company killed its lovable bunny in 1984. 

 Actually, executives at Volkswagen 

 of America were suggesting as far back as four years ago 

 that they might make the rabbit reappear. At the introduction 

 of the New Beetle convertible, the companys vice-president 

 at the time, Frank Maguire, was asked what the companys 

 next retro revival might be. 

 Reporters were angling for a commitment 

 that VW would start producing the acclaimed Microbus design 

 study; instead, Maguire gave an unexpected answer. Actually, 

 he said, Weve been giving some thought to the Rabbit. 

 At the time, the idea that VW 

 would revive a popular model name that it had euthanised 

 so suddenly, inexplicably and largely without justification 

 nearly 20 years earlier seemed to make little sense. Yet, 

 as the companys fortunes faded in recent years with disappointing 

 sales, a dwindling lineup, spotty reliability and unfavourable 

 euro-dollar exchange rates, the original Rabbits 1975-84 

 heyday started looking better by comparison.

 The fifth-generation Golf went 

 on sale in Europe in the winter of 2004, but VW is just 

 now getting around to selling it in the US. VWs American 

 operation sorely needed a new angle for this somewhat dated 

 car. Hence, the company pulled a rabbit, quite literally, 

 out of its hat.

 Architecturally, the 2006 Rabbit 

 is a Jetta with its trunk sheared off; the cars share underpinnings, 

 drivetrains and major mechanical components. As always, 

 the Rabbit is a hatchback. The base two-door starts at $15,620; 

 adding two more doors costs you $1,000 apiece. The workhorse 

 engine is a 2.5-litre in-line 5-cylinder. For a mere $7,000 

 more, you can have the sporty GTI with a 2-litre turbo 4. 

 After 2006, VW will no longer offer a turbodiesel in the 

 US.

 The original 1974 Rabbit was promoted 

 as a performance machine, which makes sense only if you 

 recall that the car replaced the legendary, and legendarily 

 sluggish, Beetle. The first Rabbits 71-horsepower 1.5-litre 

 engine seems laughably underpowered these days, though they 

 must have seemed quicker than they were. Todays base Rabbit 

 comes with more than twice the horsepower 150, to be exact 

 and a comparatively lavish 170 foot-pounds of torque. 

 The 20-valve engine delivers its 

 thrust in satisfying measures, while still conforming to 

 Californias stringent partial zero emissions regulations. 

 The Rabbit is one of the cleanest vehicles on the road. 

 Few will fault a more Rubenesque 

 Rabbit; the car no longer feels as tinny as a soda can on 

 wheels. Many pounds were devoted to safety features, structural 

 upgrades, layers of sound damping and improved crash resistance. 

 Other improvements include four-wheel antilock brakes, side-impact 

 and side-curtain air bags.

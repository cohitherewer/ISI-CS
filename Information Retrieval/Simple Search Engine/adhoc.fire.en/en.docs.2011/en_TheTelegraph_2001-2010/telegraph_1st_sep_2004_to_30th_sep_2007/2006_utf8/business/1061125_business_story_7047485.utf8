 Aulbur: Gearing up

 New Delhi, Nov. 24: DaimlerChrysler will set up its second Indian plant near Pune. Sources said it is looking at locations like Ranjangaon and Talegaon. The company already has a plant in Pimpri. 

 Wilfred Aulbur, CEO and managing director of DaimlerChrysler India (DCI), said the company was looking at expanding operations as it expects the market for high-end products to grow in the near future.

 Plans are being firmed up and will be finalised soon. It may take two to three years for the new plant to be operational, said a company official.

 However, refusing to divulge how much DCI will invest in this facility, Aulbur said, We plan to manufacture products from our existing offerings in India in the proposed plant. It will also enable us to expand in the future.

 DCI, which set up its facility in India in 2005, has been registering profits for some time now. 

 We have been making profits in India for the past six to seven years, he said. 

 He refused to comment when asked whether the expansion plans in the country would be fully funded by the parent or the Indian subsidiary will also contribute to it.

 DaimlerChrysler, which sells the Mercedes Benz brand in India apart from tippers in the off-highway commercial vehicle range, sold 1,915 cars in 2005 that included 829 units of the C Class, 825 units of the E Class, 140 of the top-end S Class and the rest were completely built unit (CBU) models.

 Aulbur said sales in India were expected to be around 2,000 vehicles in 2006. By October-end, we have sold 1,715 vehicles and hope overall sales growth will be healthy for the full year, in line with our segment, he said. 

 Stating India was an important market for DaimlerChrysler, he said it is poised to become the next China. The way forward is just going up ... India is a very important part of our Asia strategy, said Aulbur. 

 Regarding launching Chrysler-branded vehicles in India, he said there were no such immediate plans.

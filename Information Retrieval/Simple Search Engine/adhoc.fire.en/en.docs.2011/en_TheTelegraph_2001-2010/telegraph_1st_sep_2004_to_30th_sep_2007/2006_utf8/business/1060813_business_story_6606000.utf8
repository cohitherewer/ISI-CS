 Intel exits phone tech

 Cut-down mode

 San Francisco, Aug. 12 (Reuters): Intel Corp, the worlds biggest microchip maker, has sold a unit specialising in telephone technology to a privately held company, marking its exit from a once-promising business.

 Intel and the buyer, Eicon Networks, did not reveal financial terms of the deal, but Intel said it would affect about 600 employees, most of whom were expected to join the staff of Eicon.

 Intel has been looking to sell or shut down under-performing businesses as it tries to save $1 billion and refocus on its mainstay computer microprocessor business in the face of fierce competition from rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc.

 Intel said the sale of the unit known as the media and signalling business that makes hardware and software to process voice and data over networks was not actually part of that programme but could help achieve those cost-cutting goals.

 Negotiations for this transaction were already underway before Intel started looking at the analysis of our overall business, Intel spokeswoman Barbara Grimes said.

 But this divestiture should aid in that effort to become leaner or more focused.

 Intel once viewed telephone technology as a promising growth market and made big bets to tap into it, including buying computer telephony company Dialogic in 1999 for $780 million in cash.

 In June, Intel sold its money-losing communications chips business, which makes and sells processors for high-end cellphones and digital organisers, to Marvell Technology Group for $600 million.

 Montreal-based Eicon said the purchase would more than triple its annual sales and that two investment groups, Tennenbaum Capital Partners and Investcorp, would invest in the company to help it absorb the business.

 Its a few times bigger than we were in terms of size and will more than triple our revenue, Eicon chief executive Nick Jensen told Reuters.

 Its a significant transaction ... so theres no doubt that there was some financing we needed to do.

 Steven Chang, a partner at Tennenbaum, told Reuters, These two businesses are very complimentary the Intel business unit had the benefit of working closely with the Eicon business as they were partners in the past. Putting the two together will be an even more powerful combination.

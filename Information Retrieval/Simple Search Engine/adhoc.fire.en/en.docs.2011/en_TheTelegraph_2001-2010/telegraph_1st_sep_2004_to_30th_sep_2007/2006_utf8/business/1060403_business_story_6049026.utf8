 Q amp;A

 Whats the limit 

 Im a senior citizen. Is it necessary for me to file income tax returns even if my annual income is less than the taxable limit?

 Dhruba Roy, Calcutta

 A clarification from the income tax department on the same issue says one doesnt need to file I-T returns if the annual income is less than the threshold limit of Rs 1,85,000. However, if one comes under any one of the following six criteria ? owns a house, a car, a credit card, has a telephone connection, is a member of a club with an annual membership of Rs 25,000 or more, and has travelled abroad ? one will have to file a return in the assessment year 2006-07, even if the annual income is less than the threshold limit. This clause, however, stands withdrawn in the assessment year 2007-08. This means that one will not be required to file returns from the next assessment year if the annual income is less than Rs 1,85,000. 

 Held in bondage

 I am an income tax payer. I had purchased IDBI infrastructure bonds worth Rs 30,000 last fiscal. This year I got an annual interest of Rs 1,710 from it. Will the interest amount be added to my total income in 2005-06?

 M.K. Maity, Hooghly

Under section 10 (15) of the income tax act, interest income from infrastructure 

bonds are excluded from the computation of total annual income. So, your interest 

income from infrastructure bond investments will not be added to your annual income. 

However, if the interest amount in a year exceeds Rs 5,000, there will be a TDS.

 PAN poser

 I am a real estate agent. I want to get a permanent account number. What documents shall I have to furnish to obtain a PAN? Shall I have to file returns every year irrespective of my annual income after getting the PAN? 

 Ajay Agarwal, Calcutta

 You can contact UTI Securities office for a PAN application form. The tax department has appointed UTI Securities for this. You will have to pay Rs 70 for the application form. You can submit the filled-in form along with two photographs, proof of residence and proof of age with the UTI Securities office itself and the PAN card will be delivered to you in 2-3 months.

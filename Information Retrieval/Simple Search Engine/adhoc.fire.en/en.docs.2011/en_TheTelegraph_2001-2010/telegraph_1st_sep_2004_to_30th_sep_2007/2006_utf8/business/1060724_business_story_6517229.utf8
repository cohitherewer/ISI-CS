 Ministry plays down deficit data

 New Delhi, July 23 (PTI): The finance ministry has played down the high fiscal and revenue deficit figures for the first two months of the current financial year, saying the fiscal consolidation process should be seen on a long-term basis.

 Dont read too much into high frequency data ? daily, monthly or weekly ones. You need a fairly reasonable amount of time to see what is happening (on fiscal deficit front). Maintaining fiscal rectitude is a continuous process, chief economic advisor Ashok Lahiri said.

 After pressing the pause button on FRBM targets last fiscal, the government is again on a fiscal correction path from this year.

 According to the target set under the fiscal responsibility and budget management act, which became effective from 2004, fiscal deficit will be reduced by at least 0.3 per cent of the GDP each fiscal and revenue deficit by 0.5 per cent.

 The government has projected to bring down the fiscal deficit to 3.8 per cent during 2006-07 from 4.1 per cent last fiscal and revenue deficit to 2.1 per cent from 2.6 per cent.

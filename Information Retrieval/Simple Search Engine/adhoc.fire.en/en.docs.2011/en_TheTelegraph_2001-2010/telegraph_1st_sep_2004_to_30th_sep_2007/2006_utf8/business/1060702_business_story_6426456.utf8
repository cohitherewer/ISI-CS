 Calcutta, July 1: India is making a serious effort to increase tea imports from Sri Lanka.

 Sri Lanka mainly produces the orthodox variety and the Tea Board, which is spearheading the initiative, is taking steps to increase domestic consumption of the same.

 Tea Board chairman Basudeb Banerjee was recently in Colombo and met his Sri Lankan counterpart to discuss issues relating to higher imports.

 ?One of the issues discussed was increasing imports from Sri Lanka and thereby expanding the domestic orthodox market,? Banerjee said.

 Under the current provisions, India can import up to 15 million kg of tea from Sri Lanka at a duty of 7.5 per cent. For higher imports, the duty becomes 100 per cent. However, current imports hover around a meagre 0.29 million kg. 

 ?This is because Sri Lanka mainly produces orthodox tea, which does not have a large market in India,? Banerjee added.

 Tea is one of the items which will soon come under the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) with Sri Lanka.

 India produces 70 million kg of orthodox tea. A total amount of 928 million kg was produced all over the world last year.

 Speaking at the Tea Auction Buyers? Association annual general meeting, Banerjee said orthodox consumption was estimated at 20 million kg, as Indians usually consume the CTC variety.

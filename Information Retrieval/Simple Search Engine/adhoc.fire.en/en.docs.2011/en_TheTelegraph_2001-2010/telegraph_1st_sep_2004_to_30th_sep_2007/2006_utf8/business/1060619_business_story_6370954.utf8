 Q amp;A

 After me

 I am a senior citizen and unmarried. If I make my nephew or married niece my sole nominee for my investments in the post office monthly income scheme, mutual funds or in company fixed deposits, what will be his or her legal status on my death? Can my siblings, their spouses or any other nephew/niece make any claim? If I make the investments jointly, will he or she have to show these investment in his or her income tax return? 

Saurabh Datta, Calcutta

A nominee is only a custodian in the eyes of law. Hence, legal heirs, such 

as wife, son, daughter, can claim their rights on the property even if there is 

a nominee. But since you are unmarried, your nominee will become the owner of 

the investment after your demise. Your brothers or their spouses cannot make any 

claim on your investment. A joint account could be a better option, but if your 

nominee is working, he or she will have to include the interest or dividend income 

from these investments in I-T returns.

 In form

 I hold some Rural Electrification Corporation Bonds. Though my interest income on the bonds for the April 2005-March 2006 period was Rs 1,800, the corporation has deducted tax at source at the rate of 10.2 per cent. Can they do this?

 Utpal Chaudhuri, Calcutta

 It seems you have not given them the declaration in Form 15F, which would have pre-empted TDS. Tax deduction at source is not applicable if the total interest payment on securities is less than Rs 2,500 in a financial year. However, the taxpayer will have to submit Form 15F. Otherwise, tax is deducted on the entire interest payment.

 No respite for shopkeeper

 Im a retired person and run an ayurvedic shop. The shop has an annual sales of around Rs 1 lakh. I have kept an assistant who is paid a monthly salary of Rs 400. Do I need to pay a professional tax?

 Nirmal Kumar Neogi, Calcutta

 Yes, you will have to. A shopkeeper in this state has to pay a professional tax.

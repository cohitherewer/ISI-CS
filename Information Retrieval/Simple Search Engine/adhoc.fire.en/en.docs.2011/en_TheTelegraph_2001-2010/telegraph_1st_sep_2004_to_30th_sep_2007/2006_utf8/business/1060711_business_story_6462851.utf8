 Insurance firms grapple with fraud

 Rao: Guessing game

 Mumbai, July 10: What is the scale of insurance fraud in India?

 It?s a guessing game really, but the head honcho with a general insurer puts it at Rs 1,222 crore a year.

 How do you arrive at such a huge figure? Simple. Extrapolate data from the Australian insurance industry. That?s what Tata AIG General Insurance managing director Dalip Verma seems to think. 

 Insurance fraud is estimated to cost around $80 billion in the US; it costs the Australian Insurance sector about A$2.1 billion and about ?1billion in the UK. 

 ?We are assuming that of the annual non-life insurance gross premium of about Rs 20,380 crore underwritten in India, 60 per cent is the claims ratio and 10 per cent of the claims paid is involved in fraud,? he estimates. 

 ?Most of the fraud takes place in third-party motor insurance which is slated to be de-tariffed by December,? says M. Ramadoss, chairman and managing director of Oriental Insurance Company. 

 Next in the pecking order: own car claims and health insurance. According to industry sources, almost 75 per cent of total frauds is committed in these segments. 

 Ramadoss reckons the figure could be much higher. ?Each of the four public sector general insurance companies pays motor insurance claims of about Rs 1,300 crore per annum, of which 30 to 40 per cent would be fraudulent claims, which takes the toll to anywhere between Rs 1,500 crore and Rs 2,000 crore,? he says. 

 ?Staged accidents and inflated bills of damage to vehicles are paralleled by fake bodily injuries to humans and exaggerated bills for health services,? says Verma. 

 ?While the insurance companies investigate each and every claim, they are not as effective due to various reasons, including certain limitations in the Acts,? says Ramadoss. 

 ?Such frauds are committed by a nexus of people, including company officials, agents and even the police. There are many instances in Chennai where false FIRs have been filed,? adds Ramadoss. 

 ?Lately, the CBI has awakened to the situation and recently Chennai High Court has ordered that the CBI should look into all the third-party liability claims from the state,? he says. 

 Are any steps being taken to curb the menace? 

 ?There is no industry-wide database for sharing fraud and theft information for the industry,? says Verma. 

 However, he adds that now the General Insurance Council under the aegis of IRDA has taken the first step towards creating a database of car theft insurance claims. 

 ?It will prevent a car owner from taking a motor insurance from another insurer after claiming car theft insurance for the same car from the previous insurer,? he reckons.

 ?Fraud control is the responsibility of the insurance companies. The General Insurance Council has a full fledged secretary-general, who, I am sure, will take various steps to combat the problem. Also, sharing experiences regarding various regions and frauds will be more effective than just a database,? says C.S. Rao, chairman of Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA).

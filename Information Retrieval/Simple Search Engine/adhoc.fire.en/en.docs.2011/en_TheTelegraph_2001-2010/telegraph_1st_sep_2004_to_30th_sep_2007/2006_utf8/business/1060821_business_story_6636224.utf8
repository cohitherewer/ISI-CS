 Hotel scrips set to head north

 Happy days ahead

 Mumbai, Aug. 20: While hotels witness higher occupancy and a rise in average room rates (ARR), their stock prices cannot be left far behind.

 The hotel industry is expected to see good times over the next five years, according to a study by Crisil. Hotel scrips are going to hog the limelight, say stock market experts.

 According to Crisil, demand for rooms will grow at a compounded rate of 10 per cent over the next five years. 

 The average room rates are also expected to rise beyond their current highs, especially during the current and next fiscal. 

 However, a softening of rates following the emergence of pockets of oversupply is expected after that period.

 While the fear of terrorism and the lean season have weighed down the scrips in the short-term, the medium to long-term view of the stocks remain positive. All the major hotel groups are going in for capacity enhancement to meet the increasing demand, said a portfolio manager.

 For the April-June quarter, foreign institutional investors (FIIs) had pruned their stakes in key hotel companies such as Indian Hotels, Asian Hotels and Taj GVK. However, they increased stakes in Kamat and Viceroy Hotels.

 The period between April to July is the lean season for the sector, while traditionally, September to March is the peak period, said Manish Sonthalia, vice-president (equity strategy), Motilal Oswal Securities.

 However, more business and leisure travel, coupled with high foreign business travel, will fuel the demand for the coming quarters, thereby pushing up occupancy and average room rates, he added.

 According to Crisil estimates, the hotel industry, including foreign players, will invest close to Rs 9,000 crore over the next five years to add fresh capacities in the premium segment. Of this, listed Indian players would account for approximately Rs 3,000-3,300 crore.

 Therefore, while the number of rooms available is expected to grow at a moderate rate of 5 per cent over the next two years, it will grow at 11 per cent in 2009-11.

 The magnitude of this bunch-up, especially in Bangalore, Chennai, Pune and Hyderabad, will intensify competition, leading to a dampening of occupancy rates and softening of average room rates. 

 The occupancy rates in these cities are expected to plummet to 50-55 per cent by 2010-11, with dipping ARRs as a consequence.

 Baillie: Roll call

 Mumbai, Jan. 25: Hindustan Lever Ltd, the countrys largest fast-moving consumer goods company, today announced the formation of an eight-member management committee that will be headed by incoming CEO Doug Baillie.

 Besides Baillie, the committee will comprise vice-chairman M.K. Sharma, finance director D. Sundaram, and MD (foods) S. Ravindranath ? all of whom were members of the national management committee.

 The new management committee will come into effect from March 1, the day when Baillie formally takes over the reins at HLL.

 The new members inducted into the committee are Sanjay Dube as executive director (sales) and customer development, Dhaval Buch as executive director (supply chain), Anoop Mathur as executive director (speciality exports) and Nitin Paranjpe as executive director (home and personal care).

 The big, broad feature of this reorganisation is continuity and change, said Harish Manwani, president of Unilever Asia amp; Africa, and non-executive chairman of HLL.

 Sharma will continue to have operational responsibilities for HR, legal, secretarial, corporate communications, and corporate affairs.

 Sanjiv Kakkar has been appointed as executive director (foods) responsible for marketing and strategy. He will succeed Ravindranath when he retires later this year.

 The reorganisation is designed to pull down the so-called Chinese wall that existed between the hair and personal care and the foods business and is part of an overarching objective of creating one Hindustan Lever. Dube, for instance, will oversee sales of both the home and personal care and the foods businesses.

 The idea is to stop duplication of effort, said Manwani.

 The business heads will have profit and loss responsibility for their businesses. The reorganisation will provide for a decentralised and simplified decision-making structure.

 Baillie is the first expatriate to head Hindustan Lever in 45 years. In 1961, Prakash Tandon took over as managing director of HLL and every one since has been an Indian.

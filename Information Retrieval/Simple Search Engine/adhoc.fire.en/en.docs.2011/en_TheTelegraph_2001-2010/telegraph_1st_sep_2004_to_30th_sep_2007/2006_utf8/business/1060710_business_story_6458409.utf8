 Flavour tea holds export edge in UK

 Gorman: Special touch

 Calcutta, July 9: Tea of varied flavours is the way to win over the UK market.

 The UK bulk tea market is flat and Indian exports have hovered around 19.7 million kg to 20.8 million kg in the last three years. The specialty segment is growing at 7 per cent per annum.

 Indian tea has a historic association with the UK, but clearly the road ahead lies in specialty tea. About 70 per cent of the UK population consumes tea, which is about 165 million cups a day, while 96 per cent of it is consumed through bags, said William Gorman, chairman of the UK Tea Council.

 Gorman has visited the gardens in Darjeeling and Assam. He will also visit Conoor before heading for Sri Lanka. Gorman told The Telegraph that he was impressed with the quality of gardens in Darjeeling and Assam ? their hygiene standards and state-of-the-art processing facilities.

 The UK imports and consumes 120 million kg. India exports 20 million kg and Kenya around 50 to 70 million kg of bulk CTCs.

 The flavoured tea market in the UK is just around 2 per cent and therefore, Gorman feels, it has a huge potential for growth.

 He said two of the five major brands having a 70 per cent market share in the UK, the Tetley and Typhoo, are owned by Indian companies.

 However, companies keen to prise open the UK market need to embrace the idea of ethical sourcing of the beverage.

 Customers in the UK are becoming increasingly aware of the sources of the products they consume. Tea is no exception, Gorman said.

 India and a few other developing nations consider the Ethical Tea Partnership (ETP), which involves a complex process of audit and disclosure, as another non-tariff barrier to trade.

 Gorman said the UK Tea Council was trying to rope in more partners for the ETP programme.

 Exports from Kenya, Tanzania and Zimbabwe are fully audited, while talks are on to induct Indonesia and China, the latter by early next year.

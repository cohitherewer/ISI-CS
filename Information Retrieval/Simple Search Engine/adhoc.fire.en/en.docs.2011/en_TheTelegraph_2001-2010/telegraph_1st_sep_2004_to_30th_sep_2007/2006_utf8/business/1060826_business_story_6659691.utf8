 Rise in recalls likely to hit Toyota rollouts

 Tokyo, Aug. 25 (Reuters): Toyota Motor Corp, Japans biggest auto maker, is considering delaying the introduction of some new models by as much as half a year amid a series of recalls and quality problems, the Wall Street Journal said on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter. 

 Toyota, which has built its reputation on offering safe and reliable cars at reasonable prices, is plagued with a rise in vehicle recalls and faces a legal probe into its past recall practice. 

 I have given an order to pay more attention on safety issues, but we as a company are not stalling, Toyota president Katsuaki Watanabe told reporters on the sidelines of a safety technology briefing in Shizuoka Prefecture, west of Tokyo. 

 We always work flexibly on each model though, he added. 

 On the same day, Chinas quality watchdog said Toyota would recall over 20,000 locally made cars in the country due to a faulty rubber seal used to fix the windshield, although no accidents or injuries had yet been linked to the defect. 

 The paper said Toyota is considering adding as much as three to six months to development lead time, which is usually two to three years to improve quality, affecting a relatively wide range of projects. 

 The next Sienna minivan, the Solara sports coupe, and the Avalon sedan are among models that could be affected, it said. Toyota spokeswoman Shiori Hashimoto said the company would not comment on its strategy and the timing of product introductions. 

 So far this year, Toyota has recalled more than one million vehicles in Japan and 627,000 units in the US.

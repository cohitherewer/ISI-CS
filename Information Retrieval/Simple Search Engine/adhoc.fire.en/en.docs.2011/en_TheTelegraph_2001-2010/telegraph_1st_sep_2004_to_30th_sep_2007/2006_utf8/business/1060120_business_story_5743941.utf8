 Sensex hits a double ton

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Jan. 19: The stock markets today bounced back with the benchmark BSE index zooming by 236.33 points in intra-day trading ? the biggest single-day rise since September 26 last year. The rally was propelled by strong gains in infotech shares and better-than-expected quarterly numbers from Larsen amp; Toubro (L amp;T).

 The hectic buying, especially in bluechip stocks, was triggered by a surge in other Asian markets, including the region?s biggest bourse in Japan. 

 Japan?s Nikkei gained 2.3 per cent and South Korea?s Kospi ended higher, staging a sharp recovery from its depths on Wednesday. The turnaround was also reflected in the sensex, which opened firm at 9,271.63 and gradually moved north to an intra-day high of 9,473.86 before closing at 9,449.84 against yesterday?s 9,237.57, a net gain of 212.31 points or 2.29 per cent.

 The surge was led by heavyweights like Reliance Industries, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation and Infosys, even as the buying was broad-based. The Reliance scrip, which is under the no-delivery period till January 25, closed higher by Rs 10.35 at Rs 704.20.

 The IT firms, however, stole the show on the bourses. The gains here were widespread as Infosys gained more than 3 per cent and Wipro rose by around 8 per cent. Good quarterly performances from Wipro and HCL Technologies boosted investors? confidence. There was heavy buying in TCS and Satyam Computers shares too. Satyam is set to announce its third-quarter results tomorrow and analysts expect the company to revise upwards its earnings estimates for the year.

 Shares of Jet Airways shot up by Rs 70.10 to Rs 1198.80 following the company?s acquisition of Air Sahara. However, profit booking later in the day trimmed the gains and the scrip closed at Rs 1149.90 against its last close of Rs 1128.70.

 According to analysts, the market movements will depend on that of other Asian indices. However, a few analysts expect good gains with the Union Budget around the corner. 

 The volume of business dipped sharply to Rs 3629.00 crore from Rs 5,205.25 crore yesterday. RIL continued to be the top-traded share.

 Sharp eyes stake in LG.Philips

 New suitor

 Taipei, Sept. 22 (Reuters): High-level executives from Japans Sharp Corporation travelled to South Korea last week to visit LG.Philips LCD Company Ltd, as Philips seeks a buyer for its 32.9 per cent stake in the Korean LCD firm, the Taiwanese media reported on Friday. 

 Philips wants to sell its stake in LG.Philips, the worlds biggest maker of large liquid crystal displays (LCDs) used in TVs and PC monitors, but no specific names of interested buyers have emerged, according to previous reports. 

 Philips in Amsterdam reiterated that it regarded its stake as a non-core financial investment which will be sold over time, but that it had agreed with LG. to keep at least 30 per cent of LPL until three years after the company went public, which means until mid-July 2007. 

 We havent specified in which manner we would sell the stake, but it will be in the interest of our shareholders, said Philips spokesman Jayson Otke, who declined to comment on Sharp. 

 The high-level delegation of officials from Sharp went to South Korea for three or four days last week, visiting a number of LCD components suppliers and LG.Philips, a joint venture between Philips and LG.Electronics, the Commercial Times reported without citing sources. 

 Sharp spokesman Hiroshi Takenami in Tokyo said Sharp officials periodically visit its clients but said the report was untrue and was based on speculation. 

 Spokesmen for LG.Electronics and LG.Philips LCD said they had no knowledge of any interest shown by Sharp in LG.Philips LCD, and that Philips had not notified them of any progress in the possible stake sale. 

 Shares in LG.Philips fell 4.61 per cent to end at 32,100 won, against the broader markets 1.35 per cent fall, hit by worries of worse-than-expected third-quarter results and renewed concerns that Philips was looking to sell its stake. 

 Sharps shares fell 0.5 per cent to 2,070 yen, slightly outperforming the broader Tokyo market. 

 Masaki Iso, chief investment officer at Yasuda Asset Management, said it would not be a surprise if Sharp decided to buy a stake in LG.Philips to help it boost its share of the LCD market and possibly use the firms sales channels.

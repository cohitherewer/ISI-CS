 New Delhi, April 28: Bharti Airtel will invest $1.8-2 billion in the current fiscal as capital expenditure to support its expansion in the country.

 ?Our capex for 2006-07 will be $1.8-2 billion,? Bharti chief Sunil Mittal said after announcing the company?s annual results for 2005-06. 

 ?The company?s overall customer base crossed the two crore-mark and during the year, the company added over 90 lakh subscribers,? Mittal said. 

 The company has reported a 49 per cent rise in net profit at Rs 682 crore for the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2006. The consolidated revenues for fourth quarter grew 47 per cent over the same period last fiscal to Rs 3,411 crore. 

 For 2005-06, the company?s net profit clocked a robust 51 per cent year-on-year at Rs 2,258 crore, while its total revenues increased by 46 per cent to reach Rs 11,663 crore. 

 Bharti Airtel chief financial officer Akhil Gupta said the company has made a cash profit of Rs 1,205 crore in the fourth quarter. Therefore, a large part of the capital expenditure will be met out of internal cash generation and it has no plans to raise any further equity.

 During the year, the cash profit stood at Rs 4,905 crore and EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) was Rs 4,360 crore.

 On dividend to shareholders, Mittal said, ?At present, we plan to plough back our profits into the operations, so the thought of dividend has not crossed our mind.? 

 Commenting on the results, Mittal said, ?Bharti has delivered a strong performance which reflects the success story of the Indian telecom sector. The outlook for the industry remains positive and the year ahead promises to be exciting one for Bharti. With integrated organisation structure in place, the company is confident of making rapid strides in fulfilling the vision of making Airtel the most admired brand by 2010.?

 Shares of Bharti, in which Britain?s Vodafone group plc bought nearly a 10 per cent stake for Rs 6,700 crore in October, traded around Rs 405 today, which is 0.66 per cent higher than yesterdays closing price. 

 Bharti has already covered 3,778 census towns and 80,687 villages and locations, including highways, and it plans to reach all the 5,200 towns listed in the census.

 Bharti also plans to launch the next generation 3G services this fiscal if the government gave its approval by June. 

 Mittal also called for allowing foreign nationals to occupy key executive positions in telecom companies saying there should not be different rules for companies with or without FDI. 

 ?I feel there should be no differential treatment ? one rule for companies with FDI and another for those without FDI. Foreigners must be and should be allowed to take key positions and Indian companies are strong enough to take care of security,? said Mittal. 

 The present norms in the telecom sector stipulate that companies with FDI cannot appoint foreign CEOs and CFOs. Tata Teleservices, which does not have FDI, has a foreign CEO Darryl Green. 

 ?If you allow foreigners in a company which do not have foreign investment, I think it is making a mockery of the whole thing ... Because you cannot say that the investment through Vodafone and SingTel is at a discount and, therefore, needs to be penalised,? he said. 

 ?Today when we have Arun Sareen leading Vodafone and Sanjeev Ahuja leading Orange worldwide and many other illustrious Indians are there as CIOs and CTOs, I dont think we need to go a step back,? he said.

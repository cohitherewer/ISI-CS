 Tata Steel quarterly net down 15%

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 23: Tata Steel has declared a 15.4 per cent drop in earnings and a 1.36 per cent decline in net sales for the third quarter ended December 31. It has posted a net profit of Rs 753.74 crore during the quarter under review compared with Rs 890.51 crore in the year-ago period.

 Total income (net of excise) dropped to Rs 3,722.08 crore from Rs 3,765.09 crore.

 The largest private sector steel company in the country, however, has managed to better its nine-month (April-December 2005) performance by posting an 8 per cent growth in turnover and a 6 per cent rise in after-tax profit.

 Tata Steel attributed the decline in its third quarter sales and profitability to a number of shutdowns at its Jamshedpur works which had to be undertaken for maintenance and capacity up-gradation to 5 million tonnes per annum. 

 Moreover, a 26.6 per cent increase in raw material costs also ate into the companys profitability.

 Between October and December last year, Tata Steel upgraded one of its two billet casters capacity from 0.6 mtpa to 1 mtpa and undertook a mid-term repair of its third largest blast furnace. The work was completed in a record time of 44 days.

 We have made these adjustment in the third quarter so that the plant can go full steam in the fourth quarter, a Tata Steel spokesperson said.

 He hoped that the company would be able to keep its year-on-year momentum going.

 Our results have improved during the first nine months and the performance would even be better in the fourth quarter, he added.

 During October-December quarter, production went up by only 7.7 per cent while physical sales grew by 11 per cent. However, net sales slipped marginally, signalling the decline in overall commodity prices.

 Tata Steels raw material costs in these three months went up to Rs 631 crore from Rs 484 crore. The company imported large quantity of coking coal during the quarter. 

 However, the Tata flagship is continuing with its effort to use more local coal to reduce overall coal bill. The companys third quarter imports will be utilised in the fourth quarter, too.

 GMR lists at Rs 215

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Aug. 21: GMR Infrastructure Ltd today made a humble debut on the bourses when its shares opened at Rs 215, marginally above the issue price of Rs 210. 

 The scrip also slipped into the negative territory in intra-day trades and closed at Rs 210.30.

 The debut by GMR Infrastructure came on a day when the BSE sensex breached the 11500 mark. The index closed at 11511.68 against Fridays close of 11465.72, a net rise of 45.96 points or 0.40 per cent.

 Market circles said the main reason for investors not supporting the scrip at present levels was a feeling that it will take some time for GMRs initiatives in the construction space to get fully reflected in its balance sheet.

 The past weeks have not been entirely good for new offerings. Shares of recent issues, including Deccan Aviation and Allcargo Global Logistics, are trading below their IPO prices. Shares of many other companies are trading well below their issue prices.

 On the BSE, the GMR Infrastructure scrip shot to an intra-day high of Rs 219.80, only to dip to Rs 205.10 during intra-day trades. The share later ended at Rs 210.30, marginally above the issue price. GMR was, however, the largest traded scrip on the BSE. Its counter saw 72.09 lakh shares being transacted, resulting in a turnover of Rs 153.42 crore.

 The company raised Rs 800 crore from the IPO, whose price was later fixed at the lower end of the price band. GMR plans to invest part of the proceeds in various infrastructure special purpose vehicles, which are currently in the development stage. Part of the IPO proceeds would also go for power trading, transmission and distribution businesses, which it plans to enter. Brokers said the new issue market will be again put to test soon when Tech Mahindra shares will get listed.

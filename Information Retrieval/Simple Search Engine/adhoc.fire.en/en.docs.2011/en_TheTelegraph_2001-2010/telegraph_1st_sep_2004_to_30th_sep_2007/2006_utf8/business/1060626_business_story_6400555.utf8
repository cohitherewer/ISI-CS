 More to inflation than oil

 Inflation is at a one-year high and the worry is that not all the price increase is because of oil. First, the numbers: the wholesale price index (WPI) is up 5.24 per cent year-on-year; the fuel, light, power and lubricants index has risen by 9.9 per cent; the prices of primary products have gone up by 6.3 per cent. The price of manufactured products, on the other hand, has remained under control, increasing by a comparatively tepid 2.9 per cent. Within the primary articles group, however, the index for food articles has risen by as much as 8 per cent year-on-year. Within food products, the index for foodgrains (cereals and pulses) has risen by 9.5 per cent year-on-year and that for eggs, meat and fish has gone up by 8.9 per cent. To cut a long story short, foodgrain prices have gone up by almost as much as fuel prices.

 Heres where the data start to get interesting. The price index for urad has moved up from 232.9 on June 11, 2005 to 386.3 on June 10, 2006 ? a rise of a massive 65.9 per cent. Similarly, the price of moong has gone up by 47.7 per cent in a year. Nor are pulses the only commodity whose price is shooting up ? even the condiments and spice index shows a rise of 22 per cent. The index for inland fish too is up 23.5 per cent. And if this is the level of price rise at the wholesale level, consider what the final impact on consumers will be. 

 The rise in food prices is reflected in the consumer price indices (CPI) for agricultural workers and rural labourers, where the weight of the food component in the index is high. In May 2006, inflation according to the CPI-agricultural labourers was 6.41 per cent, while the CPI-rural labourers index was up 6.38 per cent year-on-year. Small wonder that the government has opened the floodgates for the import of sugar and pulses.

 Nevertheless, the rate of inflation is expected to go down at the end of June/mid-July because that is when there was a jump in the WPI last year. That base effect should help the headline inflation number.

 RBI rate hike

 Will the increase in inflation prompt the RBI to raise rates yet again? The rise in inflation has been accompanied by a rise in bond yields. The yield on the 10-year government bond is now well above 8 per cent. But much of the inflation is driven by supply-side factors, such as the hike in fuel prices or the rise in the price of pulses. Theres not much the RBI can do about that.

 As a matter of fact, money supply (M3) growth has been lower this fiscal compared with the previous one, because although the RBI has been buying dollars and increasing money supply that effect has been offset by lower credit growth. The latest data show, however, that credit growth has picked up, and once that happens, the RBI will need to clamp down on money supply. Additionally, so long as the other central banks tighten, the RBI too is likely to continue to do so. That?s why the markets are anticipating another rate hike by the RBI.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Left for rules in retail play

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bag of woes

 New Delhi, Dec. 27: The Left parties continue to oppose any move by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to open up the retail window to foreign investors in select sectors. 

 They are also considering seeking a regulatory mechanism for the entire sector so that even domestic big players cannot eat into small pop-and-mom stores business. 

 A regulatory mechanism could be a necessary step ... our apprehensions about big retail players are not just confined to foreign direct investments, said CPM leader Nilotpal Basu. 

 The CPM top brass has also stressed the need for regulation in the sector in discussions so far. 

 Singh has reportedly asked commerce minister Kamal Nath to come up with a plan to open FDI in retail areas such as sports goods, stationery, construction material and electronics in a manner that does not affect small and neighbourhood shop owners. But the Left does not believe that even an area specific opening up would leave small business unscathed. 

 I plan to approach the Prime Minister to warn him that big is not beautiful everywhere. Retail is a labour intensive business run by millions of small businessmen, mostly from the middle class. If we allow big retailers unchecked entry into this business, millions will lose their business, many more their jobs, said Abani Roy, RSP leader and member of the Left-UPA coordination committee, which is supposed to thrash out policy differences between the Congress government and its Left allies. 

 There have to be set parameters even for domestic big retailers ... we are not batting for them against foreign retailers. What will happen to so many unemployed small businessmen and their ex-employees? We have had jobless growth in the past decade, we should not now try to improve upon it with a less job growth model, Roy added. 

 Left leaders feel the regulatory framework for the sector as a whole has to be in place before the government thinks of opening up to foreign investments. A note prepared by a CPM thinktank argues an average Walmart employee displaces up to 95 traditional retail workers. India has about 4 crore retail workers, with retail trade contributing about 11 per cent of the GDP. A thousand supermarket workers could, according to this logic, throw out nearly a lakh kirana store workers.

 However, government officials say the plan that is being worked upon on the retail front is for a limited opening up, and will take care of Left concerns over job loss.

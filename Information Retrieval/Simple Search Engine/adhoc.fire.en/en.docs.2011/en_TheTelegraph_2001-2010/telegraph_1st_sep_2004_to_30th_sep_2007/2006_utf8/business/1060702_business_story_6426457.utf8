 Core sector needs $20 bn a year

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, July 1: Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia today underlined the need to secure foreign direct investment (FDI) worth $20 billion annually for the infrastructure sector.

 Speaking at an MIT-Assocham seminar, Singh said: An investment of $20 billion would have to be achieved on a yearly basis to build the nations infrastructure. 

 Ahluwalia emphasised the need to bring about a balance in the public-private partnership model to ensure private funding for public projects. 

 Private participation in any public project is desirable as private entrepreneurs are target-oriented and follow better fiscal discipline as they are keen to ensure good returns from investments, he said. 

 The plan panel deputy chief, however, cautioned entrepreneurs that mass consumer awareness was on the rise and buyers would not accept careless service. He recalled that when the Delhi government privatised power distribution, many consumers agitated against excessive billing and faulty meters. 

 Ahluwalia earlier said the 11th Five-Year Plan would focus on infrastructure development, besides other areas like education, health and water supply. He said the plan would also focus on strengthening government machinery and making it speedy, transparent and responsive about implementation of the schemes.

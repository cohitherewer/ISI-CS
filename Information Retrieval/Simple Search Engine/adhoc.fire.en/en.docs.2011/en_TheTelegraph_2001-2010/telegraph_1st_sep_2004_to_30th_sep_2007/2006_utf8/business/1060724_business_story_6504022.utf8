 Q amp;A

 Sooner or later

 What is the last date for submitting form 15G for non-deduction of TDS? While UTI Bank, Gol Park branch, wants the duly filled 15G form at the beginning of the financial year, the Lake Gardens branches of SBI, Syndicate Bank and Allahabad Bank accepted the same even on March 30. UTI bank deducted TDS on the accrued interest from April 1, 2005, though I submitted form 15G on March 29, 2006.

 Bhola Nath Das, Calcutta

 UTI Bank was right. According to the income tax law, TDS has to be deducted at the time of credit or payment, whichever is earlier. Hence, your declaration to the bank through form 15G for non-deduction of TDS must be given at the beginning of a financial year. The bank will stop deducting TDS only after receiving form 15 G from you.

 Demat trouble

 I contacted a brokerage firm through a website and asked them to open my demat account in Calcutta. They opened one at their Salt Lake office. I reside at Behala. So I requested them to transfer the account to one of their offices closer to Behala. The firm told me that intracity transfer of demat accounts is not permitted. How can I get the account transferred?

 Amit Choudhuri, Calcutta

 You can get the account transferred to another brokerage firm which is closer to your place. Even banks open demat accounts. 

 Deduction details

 How do banks and post offices deduct tax at source on interest earned under the Senior Citizen Savings Scheme? How would we get the TDS certificate? 

 S.N. Singh, Dhanbad

 The interest in SCSS is payable every quarter. Banks and post offices are required to deduct tax at source as and when the payment is credited. So, your interest income in SCSS will be subjected to TDS every quarter. 

 You can obtain the TDS certificate from the bank or post office where you have the SCSS account at the end of every financial year.

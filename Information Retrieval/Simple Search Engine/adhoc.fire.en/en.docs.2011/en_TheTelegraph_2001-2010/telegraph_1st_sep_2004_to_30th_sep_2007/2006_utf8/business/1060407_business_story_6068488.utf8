 All the action is in nuts amp; bolts

 Mumbai, April 6: The manufacturing sector has started to emerge from the doghouse.

 For years, manufacturing companies have lived in the shadow of the dazzling services sector and the agriculture sector that has been mollycoddled with big incentives and benefits.

 But they are now ready to win back some of the respect they enjoyed earlier. 

 A global study conducted by the Boston Consulting Group and Confederation of Indian Industry claims that the Indian manufacturing sector shows the promise of emerging as a potential hub for the world. 

 The manufacturing sector has received short shrift largely because it contributes only 16 per cent of Indias GDP. However, it also contributes almost 53 per cent of the countrys exports and receives 79 per cent of foreign direct investments into India.

 A global comparison indicates that Indias manufacturing base is the fourth largest among emerging economies after China, Mexico and Russia. It is also among the fastest growing and has seen more investments as a proportion of GDP than any other country except China. 

 At present, the total value of output from the manufacturing sector is about $450 billion, with food and chemicals forming the two largest components. Rubber, petroleum and transport equipment, including the auto components industry, have been identified as the high growth industries by the study. 

 The findings of the report shows that Indias competitiveness in manufacturing is more broad based and involves four key factors, which includes labour cost advantage, skilled manpower, effective use of capital and raw material competitiveness. 

 Manufacturing also plays a vital role in job creation and currently employs 45 million people, which constitute 11 per cent of the countrys workforce. 

 Domestic demand for services is significantly driven by growth in manufacturing.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Way to dusty doom passes through BSE

 OUR BUREAU 

 June 8: Investor woes reached the brim on Thursday when sheer absence of liquidity and a distressed sentiment drove stocks further down into what is now looking as a bottomless pit. The BSE sensex crashed by a huge 460.95 points to end at 9,275.76 even as past saviours like mutual funds turned mere onlookers.

 With todays fall, the benchmark index lost a massive 1155.52 points, or 11.06 per cent, in the last four trading sessions. The scale of the drop could be ascertained from investor wealth in market capitalisation eroding by a gargantuan Rs 1.48 lakh crore to Rs 2,400,684 crore on a single day. The descent was across the board from heavyweights to mid-caps and small-caps; all crushed in a selling wave with many seeing double digit percentage losses.

 The reasons for the hammering were the same as early this week. With US interest rates rising, FIIs could exit from India. 

 More than this, there is a growing feeling that the markets have entered a bear phase. Even mutual funds, which had stepped in times of distress, have not bought stocks as they are facing redemption pressures. The funds are now net sellers.

 Investors simply want to exit from this market or do not want to enter at all in these trying times. We have to now see whether the BSE sensex falls below the 9200 mark tomorrow. If it does, the next bottom for the index is 8750, which could be hit even next week, says Dilip Davda, an analyst.

 The sensex opened sharply lower at 9,664.90, against yesterdays close of 9756.76, and after plunging to a low of 9200.80, an intra-day drop of over 555 points, ended at 9,295.81, down by 4.72 per cent. All sectoral indices plunged by over 3-8 per cent and all 30 index-based counters finished with sharp to moderate losses. The S amp;P CNX Nifty also tumbled by 145.85 points, or 4.76 per cent, to 2,724.60 from the previous close of 2,860.45.

 PM concern

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is worried over the stock market crash as his economic advisory council discussed the issue at its meeting here today. The council feels that the hammering was the result of both global factors and domestic issues, including the petrol and diesel price hike, chairman C. Rangarajan said.

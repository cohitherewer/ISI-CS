 Below-the-line ads grab eyeballs

 A fiery taste: Scene: 

 A crowded market place. Plot: To promote the new masala 

 version of Kurkure, a fried snack, JWT Chennai employed 

 pyrotechnicians who caught fire as soon as they grabbed 

 a bite of the snack, thereby demonstrating how spicy 

 the snack really was. This guerilla stunt by JWT won 

 them a Cannes Lion

 New Delhi, Nov. 21: In a crowded marketplace, a man pops a Kurkure spicy snack into his mouth and suddenly bursts into flames. Once the flame has been doused, the professional stuntman distributes Kurkure spicy snack to a crowd thats still recovering.

 The promo created by JWT Chennai used below-the-line (BTL) or guerrilla advertising to convey the idea that Kurkure is truly spicy.

 Despite being on the wild side of brand promotion, the Kurkure campaign was able to pique consumers curiosity to try out the product, said Beena George, group head, Vyas Giannetti Creative.

 This exemplifies the way BTL, which so far had been dismissed as a niche medium for advertising, is now becoming popular among companies to reach out to customers through personalised and customised campaigns, said George.

 Analysts say the amount of money distributed between BTL and mass traditional media advertising, which includes print and television, varies depending on the product.

 While FMCG or fast moving consumer goods meant for the mass market tend to spend between 10 and 25 per cent on BTL, luxury goods which depend on word of mouth advertising more than media space, could spend up to 50 per cent on promos such as celebrity dinners and personalised promotions.

 Thousands of products and hundreds of TV channels are jostling for mindspace not to mention the high cost of advertising in newspapers and broadcast, making it imperative for companies to look at alternative methods like BTL, said Shikhar Mohan, creative supervisor, Everest Brand Solutions.

 Take for instance the promotion created by Mudra Communications for Air-India Express to create a brand identity of being a low-cost, budget airline.

 The campaign plastered posters of airplane windows on bus windows, creating the illusion that bus commuters were travelling in an airplane. The tagline read Air travel at land travel fares driving home the airlines claim of being an affordable airline service.

 Had we used a print ad or a TV commercial, the cost would have been anywhere between Rs 16 lakh for a print ad to Rs 70 lakh for TV; but by using BTL we were able to create a high impact campaign for Rs 80 per poster, said Mohan, who had conceptualised the airline ad during his stint with Mudra.

 And the campaign was able to attract more eyeballs, which would not have been possible with a three- second TV commercial or even a full page advertisement in the biggest national daily

 BTL, or guerrilla marketing, is a low-cost high impact method of advertising products by making the consumer a part of the advertisement.

 Using touch points that the consumer comes into contact on a regular basis, like posters, direct mailers, and outdoor events, BTL sends the message home in a much stronger manner than traditional, passive media like television or print.

 Says Satish Kaushik, copywriter of Bates India, Since traditional above-the-line (ATL) methods, including television and newspapers, cater to one to many, they are considered impersonal. So the point of sale is changing as clients and advertisers focus on alternative media like outdoor campaign, posters, promotional events. 

 The shift in marketing spend, of the Rs 8,000 crore advertising industry, from above the line (ATL) promotions to targeted, direct response BTL marketing is happening faster than some might expect.

 Analysts said that while ATL advertising is expected to grow by an average of only 5.5 per cent per year, BTL spending would grow at 7.8 per cent annually.

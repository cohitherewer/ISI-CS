 Deficit pruned to $3.9 bn

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, March 31: Indias current account deficit has improved to $3.9 billion for the third quarter of 2005-06 against $5.4 billion in the corresponding period last year, despite a widening gap between imports and exports. 

 The deficit situation improved due to a growth in receipts, which included software exports and remittances from overseas Indians.

 Figures released by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) today revealed that while import payments showed moderation in the third quarter due to a strong base effect in the corresponding quarter of 2004-05, the continued momentum in exports led to a trade deficit of $12 billion in the quarter, up marginally from $11.7 billion in the same period last year.

 The trade deficit of $12 billion is, however, lower than $14 billion recorded for the second quarter. While exports during the October-December period rose to $26 billion ($24 billion in the preceding quarter), imports were stable at $38 billion.

 According to the central bank, capital flows turned negative in the third quarter due to repayment of India Millennium Deposits (IMDs) and moderation of inflows by foreign institutional investors (FIIs) due to selling pressure in the October-November 2005 period. 

 However, inflows in the form of foreign direct investment (FDI) and NRI deposits remained steady. This resulted in a net outflow of $0.6 billion compared with a net inflow of $11.9 billion in the third quarter of 2004-05.

 Net FDI inflows picked up on sustained interest in India as an attractive investment destination. Strong points were robust economic activity and continued strength of the corporate sector with inflows channelling into manufacturing, business and computer services, the RBI said. FDI rose to $4.7 billion during the April-December period, up from $2.7 billion in the corresponding period last year.

 This apart, NRI deposits also 

 showed a significant turnaround from net outflows in the 

 previous year. NRI deposits during the nine month period 

 were placed at $1.1 billion against a outflow of over $1.3 

 billion in 2004-05.

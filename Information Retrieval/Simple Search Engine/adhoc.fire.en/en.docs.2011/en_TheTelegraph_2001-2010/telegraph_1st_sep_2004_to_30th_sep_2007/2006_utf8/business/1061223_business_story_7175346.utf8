 Govt go-ahead to 49% foreign stake in bourses

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 NEW ERA

 Mumbai, Dec. 22: The government today allowed 49 per cent foreign investment in the stock exchanges. This follows Sebis move to allow public shareholding in bourses.

 Within the 49 per cent, there is a separate foreign direct investment (FDI) cap of 26 per cent and a foreign institutional investment (FII) ceiling of 23 per cent. 

 The policy for foreign investments will apply to all companies in the securities market, including bourses, depositories and clearing corporations. 

 However, FDI will be allowed with prior approval of the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB), while FII will be allowed only through purchases in the secondary market. Also, FIIs cannot seek and thus will not get representation on the exchange boards. 

 An overall cap of 5 per cent has been imposed on a single foreign investor, including persons acting in concert. 

 The Bombay Stock Exchange has been waiting for the guidelines to complete its demutualisation and corporatisation process and announce its plans for a strategic sale of 26 per cent. 

 In an earlier notification, Sebi had allowed offers for sale, placement of existing shares held by members and also private placement of fresh shares to increase the public shareholding of stock exchanges. 

 The Sebi notification also mentioned that no entity, either individually or together with persons acting in concert shall be allowed to acquire or hold more than 1 per cent of the paid-up capital of the exchanges without prior Sebi approval. 

 Although no names were disclosed, the BSE chief executive officer and managing director Rajnikant Patel had admitted that various global and Asian stock markets have been wooing the exchange. 

 According to market sources, while the individual limit of 5 per cent means more investors will be able to get a piece of the cake, it also might prove to be a hindrance as most strategic investors, who invest at a premium, would want to hold a substantial chunk of the company. 

 However, India being the most sought-after investment destination, it might not prove to be difficult, added the merchant banking official. 

 The exchange plans to offload the remaining 25 per cent through an initial public offer or an offer for sale. 

 The deadline to complete the corporatisation process had been extended to May 2007, but BSE had hoped to make the strategic sale by December.

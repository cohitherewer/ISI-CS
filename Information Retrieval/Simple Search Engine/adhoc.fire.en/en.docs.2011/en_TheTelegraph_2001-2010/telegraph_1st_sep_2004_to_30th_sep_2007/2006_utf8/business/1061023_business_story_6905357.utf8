 Markets cool to big-bang Tata takeover

 While a slew of superlatives has been used to describe Tata Steels landmark bid for Corus, the stock market has been rather unimpressed. 

 The Tata Steel stock has fallen by around 4 per cent since October 5, when the news was first announced. Over the same period, the sensex has gained around 3 per cent. The worry, of course, is whether the Indian steel company is paying too high a price in jumping from 56th place to number 5 in the global steel league tables. The Corus stock, on the other hand, has rallied sharply. 

 The unease has been stoked by analysts reports which have pointed out that theres no immediate scope for shipping low-quality slab steel from Tata Steels Indian plants to Coruss facilities for finishing and distribution. Credit rating agency Standard amp; Poors has put Tata Steel on ratings watch with negative implications, which means that its rating could be downgraded in the future on the grounds that the deal could have an adverse impact on its financial risk profile.

 In a recent note to its clients, Dutch broker Rabo Securities said it thinks there is no strategic rationale for a Tata takeover of Corus because, firstly, Tata is located in a high growth market whereas the UK market is at best not growing at all and, secondly, the potential synergies are very limited. It added that Coruss know-how is the only synergy potential for Tata. Also, theres a widespread belief that therell be some equity dilution to fund part of the mega deal. Moreover, Corus has been on the block for a long time as its high costs had been a deterrent to prospective partners.

 Nevertheless, over the longer-term there will be substantial benefits from the deal, which will give the Tata company access to a large market and to Coruss worldwide distribution network. The risk is that, in the interim, there could be a lot of pain, with the steel cycle turning. In the first six months of 2006, Coruss pre-tax profits fell 62 per cent from the equivalent period last year. In a research note, Credit Suisse has said with supply overshooting demand growth, US inventories dangerously high, scrap prices falling and leading indicators already rolling over, it thinks there may well be a significant basis for selling the sector in the coming months and few reasons to buy. 

 Leading steel consultant MEPS International says that in the EU we believe that October/November will be the peak period for this cycle. Thereafter, transaction values are expected to gradually decrease.

 Samvat 2063

 Samvat 2062 saw a rise of 59 per cent in sensex, the best performance in the last three Samvat years. Only in Samvat 2059, when the current bull run started, did the sensex put in a better performance. Will the party continue in Samvat 2063? 

 The consensus is that the Indian market is overvalued and its the most expensive among the major emerging markets. But thats been the story for quite some time, and it hasnt stopped the market from going up. 

 At the beginning of Samvat 2062, however, the sensex PE was at 15.45, far below current valuations. Moreover, it was also below the sensex PE at the beginning of Samvat 2061, which was 18.07. It could be argued therefore that the sensex was valued at a lower level last Diwali than during the previous year. This year, however, theres no such luck, and the sensex is more expensive than at any other time during the current boom. 

 But then, that was true at the beginning of Samvat 2061 as well, with the sensex PE at 18.07. That, however, couldnt prevent the sensex from rising 32 per cent that year.

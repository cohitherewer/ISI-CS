 Tata Steel profit loses shine

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, May 18: It was a day of disappointment for Tata Steel on Dalal Street as the company recorded a lower-than-expected net profit for the fourth quarter ended March 31. The stock lost its shine and fell 10.91 per cent to end the day at Rs 545.45 against its previous close of Rs 612.25.

 Net profit during the reporting quarter stood at Rs 799.41 crore, down 13.23 per cent from Rs 921.31 crore in the same period previous fiscal. 

 The board of directors has recommended a dividend of 130 per cent for financial year 2005-06.

 ?The drop in net profit was mainly due to a drop in the prices of steel, while raw materials became costly,? said deputy managing director T. Mukherjee.

 Net sales for the quarter, however, increased 20 per cent at Rs 5,551.35 crore against Rs 4,632.72 crore in the year-ago quarter.

 For 2005-06, Tata Steel has reported a 4 per cent rise in net profit at Rs 3,721.07 crore against Rs 3,571.20 crore in the previous year. Net sales rose 26.54 per cent to Rs 20,244.43 crore year-on-year from Rs 15,998.61 crore.

 The company is planning a capital expenditure (capex) of Rs 2,000 crore this financial year against Rs 1,400 crore in the previous year.

 ?We should do a capex of at least Rs 2,000 crore this financial year,? Mukherjee said.

 Tata Steel will produce more steel this fiscal. ?We expect our steel production to go up by 0.5 million tonnes this fiscal. The 1.8-mt tonne steel plant in Jamshedpur will be completed by calendar year 2008,? he added.

 The production for fiscal ended March 31, 2006 was 4.7 million tonnes. The company has forecast a 7.3 per cent rise in steel demand for 2006.

 Tata Steel will focus on operational efficiencies and a better product-mix and integration of NatSteel and Millennium Steel in the current fiscal, he said.

 On the company?s plans to raise funds, Mukherjee said the board has formed a committee to look in to the matter.

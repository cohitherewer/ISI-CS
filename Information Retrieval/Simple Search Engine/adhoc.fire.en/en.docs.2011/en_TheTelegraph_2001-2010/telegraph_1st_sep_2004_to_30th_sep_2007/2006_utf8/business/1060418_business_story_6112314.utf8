 Eveready battery gets costlier

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 17: Eveready Industries India Limited (EIIL) has raised the prices of all types of batteries by Re 1 because of an increase in zinc prices. This represents a hike of 8 to 20 per cent for various battery sizes.

 Zinc is one of the key components for dry cell batteries as well as brass flashlights.

 Base metal prices have been scaling since March-April 2005 when they were between $1,300 and $1,375 per tonne.

 In September, the per tonne price was at $1,400, which rose to $1600-$1800 by December. 

 The spot prices in April 2006 went up to $3,085 and the average of the first two weeks was $2,900 per tonne.

 This price does not include the premium the company has to pay while importing the base metal. The price rise in all battery categories has been done in a way that will neutralise the adverse impact of higher input costs.

 This is the third price hike in D size batteries.

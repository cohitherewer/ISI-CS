 Campaign for leeway in fixing oil tariff

 S.P.S PANNU 

 In Demand

 New Delhi, April 2: The petroleum ministry wants the government to retain some flexibility in fixing oil duties, especially when prices turn volatile.

 It has recommended to the commerce ministry that during the world trade talks, the country should stick to unbound ? a technical term for flexibility in fixing duties ? tariffs in the oil sector to ensure the necessary headroom.

 However, if the country opts for bound rates, the customs duty on crude should be fixed at 10 per cent and that of petroleum products at 20 per cent so that there is at least a 10 per cent difference between crude oil and petro goods.

 Bound tariffs are customs duties on goods fixed by the WTO. Once a country agrees to accept these bound tariffs, they are legally binding and the country cannot raise customs duties on specified goods above these levels.

 The commerce ministry had asked its petroleum counterpart to submit its recommendations as tariffs for the petroleum sector will figure at the WTO negotiations on non-agricultural market access (NAMA). 

 While the current duty on petroleum products such as petrol and diesel is 7.5 per cent and that on crude is 5 per cent, these can be increased substantially if the need arises.

 The petroleum ministry wants to retain a wide degree of flexibility to enable it to manage the highly volatile market.

 Since refining capacity has gone up sharply in Asia in recent years, the petroleum ministry does not want to take chances on lowering customs duties to levels where Indian refineries do not have any protection. 

 In order to avoid an inverted duty structure, the petroleum ministry wants to retain a margin of 10 per cent between the duty on crude input and output of petroleum products. 

 This would enable domestic oil companies to enjoy a sufficient incentive to expand capacities in the future. 

 India, along with Brazil, is spearheading the case for greater concessions for developing countries and several rounds of tough bargaining are expected to take place before any final agreement.

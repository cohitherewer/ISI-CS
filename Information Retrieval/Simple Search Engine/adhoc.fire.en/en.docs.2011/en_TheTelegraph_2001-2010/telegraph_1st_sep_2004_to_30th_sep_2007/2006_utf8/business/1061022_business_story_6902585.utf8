 Job-loss jitters for Corus staff

 Port Talbot, Wales, Oct. 21 (Reuters): Steelworkers and suppliers for a Corus Group plant in South Wales are concerned an agreed takeover of the Anglo-Dutch steel company by Tata Steel could lead to the end of their jobs.

 They were saying this morning theres not going to be real change. I dont necessarily believe that for one little minute, said Clive Kinsey, 61, who works for a haulage company that contracts for Corus.

 Tata Steel won approval from Corus on Friday for a 4.3 billion ($8.1 billion) takeover bid to create the worlds fifth-largest steelmaker.

 Some workers questioned the viability of their town with its skyline of smokestacks and shipping cranes. Steel has been produced at Port Talbot since 1920.

 This town and this area rely so heavily on the plant, it could be devastated, said an employee of 30 years. Im married myself with three children, and thats crossed my mind a few times in the last week.

 Several steelworkers said the chief risk could be a shutdown of steel-making at Port Talbot but that they thought its refining operations would be spared. The plant employs more than 3,000 people in steel-making and refining.

 I know the workforce are very enthusiastic to do the best they can because they realise whats resting on but a lot of machinery there is quite antiquated, said the man who has transported hot metal at the plant for more than three decades.

 Cuts not ruled out

 He feared Tata Steel was primarily interested in IJmuiden, the Corus site in the Netherlands, which analysts say is the most efficient of its plants. Corus, created through the merger of Dutch firm Hoogovens and British Steel in 1999, employs most of its staff in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands.

 It produces carbon steel at Port Talbot, Teesside, Scunthorpe and Rotherham in the UK and at IJmuiden in the Netherlands.

 Tata Steel refused to rule out job cuts at Coruss workforce of about 47,000 but said there were no short-term plans to relocate plants.

 If they invest in us and show us a bit of trust, were all for it, said the hot-metal transporter. I just hope the shareholders see it that way.

 On the administrative side of the facility, the takeover was eyed with less trepidation. 

 To be honest, we think its a good thing. Its access to a more global market for both sides, said a man from the accounting office. I think, short term, things will pretty much go on as they have been.

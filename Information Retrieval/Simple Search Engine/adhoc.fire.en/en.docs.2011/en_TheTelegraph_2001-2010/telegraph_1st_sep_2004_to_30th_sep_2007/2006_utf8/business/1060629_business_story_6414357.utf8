 Gesco demerger on course

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, June 28: The Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) has withdrawn its insistence on a performance guarantee from Great Eastern Shipping Company (Gesco) that it will be responsible for the services provided by the demerged entity.

 Although a formal communication from the corporation is yet to reach GE Shipping, sources said ONGC is not raising objections to the demerger. GE Shipping had earlier written to the corporation explaining why the latters stipulation could not be met.

 GE Shippings board had approved the de-merger of its offshore services business into a separate company called Great Offshore Ltd last year.

 The offshore business consists drilling services, marine logistics, marine construction and terminal services.

 Ex-Boeing man at Ford helm

 Detroit, Sept. 6 (Reuters): Ford Motor named former Boeing executive Alan Mulally as chief executive on Tuesday, ending the troubled five-year stint of Bill Ford Jr as the operational head of the automaker founded by his great-grandfather.

 Mulally, who had been the head of Boeing Cos profitable commercial plane division, is one of the first chief executives of a major automaker to come from outside the industry. The radical choice is the latest indication of the pressure on Ford to step up its cost-cutting, shake up its product development plans and revamp its entire way of doing business.

 Bill Ford Jr, whose family retains a controlling ownership stake in the No 2 US automaker through a separate class of shares, will stay on as executive chairman. Ford posted a $1.44-billion loss in the first half of the year and its sales this year have declined by nearly 10 per cent through August. 

 Last week, Bill Ford told employees the automaker needed a new business model and had to attract outside executives who would find sources of growth outside the companys once-profitable reliance on sales of trucks and SUVs.

 Our turnaround effort required the additional skills of an executive who has led a major manufacturing enterprise through such challenges before, Bill Ford wrote in an e-mail to Ford employees announcing Mulallys appointment. Clearly, the challenges Boeing faced in recent years have many parallels to our own, Ford said.

 Under Bill Ford Jr, who took over as chief executive in October 2001, the companys US market share dropped from near 23 per cent to about 17 per cent. Its share price fell by almost 70 per cent over the same period. Credit markets, worried about the growing financial pressure on Ford, welcomed the news of Mulallys appointment. 

 The cost to insure Fords debt for five years with credit default swaps fell by around 40 basis points to around 595 basis points, or $595,000 per year to insure $10 million in debt.

 I think Bill Ford was under some pressure to bring in additional leadership, said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Asset Management. He remains as executive chairman, still very much in control, but I think this step to bring in new management from outside the company is a smart, mature action by him ... to move the company on to the next step.

 Analysts said Mulallys experience in wringing efficiencies from Boeings manufacturing operations would serve Ford well, but some said the companys core problem remained its reliance on sales of an ageing line-up of pickup trucks and SUVs. 

 Mirko Mikelic, senior portfolio manager at Fifth Third Asset Management said, Obviously, (Mulally) does not have much auto experience, but he does have turnaround experience ... My concern is not about his ability to cut costs but his ability to stop Fords slide in market share. What is he going to do to stop that slide?

 The timing of Mulallys appointment surprised some analysts since Ford is on the brink of announcing its third restructuring in five years. The company said in January that it would cut 30,000 jobs and close 14 plants in North America by 2012. In July, Ford said it would accelerate and deepen that turnaround plan, dubbed the Way Forward, to respond to the weakening US demand for fuel-hungry trucks and SUVs amid high gasoline prices. Ford said last month that it would cut fourth-quarter production by 21 per cent, with the deepest cuts coming in its planned output of trucks.

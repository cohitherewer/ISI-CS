 Dunlop revival kitty ready

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Ruia: Help at hand

 Calcutta, July 12: In a bid to revive Dunlop, the Ruia group is raising Rs 400 crore from a foreign bank, which will be a mix of debt and equity.

 The company has received about Rs 90 crore, the first tranche, by way of a rupee term-loan from the Indian subsidiary of the foreign bank.

 Dunlop chairman Pawan Ruia said the deal structure is being worked out and will be ready by the end of this month.

 The company could make a private placement of shares with the bank as part of the deal.

 Ruia holds a 74.5 per cent stake in the company. He said the fresh addition would not be more than 10-15 per cent of the present equity of Rs 44.98 crore.

 I am not selling any share from my holding. However, my stake will stand diluted if fresh shares are issued, Ruia said.

 The share is likely to be issued in the form of warrants, to be convertible after some years.

 While about Rs 100 crore will be set aside for capital expenditure, the rest will be utilised for working capital, sundry debtors, workers separation plan and other statutory liabilities.

 Ruia said Dunlops Ambattur unit in Chennai could start operation by early August, while Sahagunj would take some more time.

 Dunlop is targeting a Rs 400-crore turnover this fiscal and close to Rs 900-1,000 crore in the next.

 Meanwhile, the Ruia group has added another engineering company to its portfolio by bagging power transmission equipment maker Hirakud Industrial Works Ltd in Orissa for Rs 22 crore.

 The other engineering companies of the group are Jessop and Pallavi Manufacturing.

 Hirakuds plant is located on a 400-acre plot in Sambalpur. It employs about 400 people. The company has the capability to redesign, fabricate, galvanise and erect a wide range of towers and structures.

 I expect a bright future for the company, as the country is set to witness investments in infrastructure in the near future, he added.

 Sugar plan

 The Ruia group is planning a big-buck investment in sugar. It hopes to expand the cane crushing capacity to 30,000 TCD from 4,000 TCD in three years.

 To start with, Kamlapur Sugar amp; Industries ? the sugar company of the group ? will expand to 7,500 TCD by the end of 2007.

 During the same period, co-generation capacity will be raised to 21 mega watt from 6 mw now and 120 kilolitre of ethanol. 

 Three years from now, the company is targeting 100 mw of power and 500 kl of ethanol. 

 We are looking at inorganic acquisition as well. It may so happen that we buy a listed company and Kamlapur Sugar is merged with it, Ruia explained.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 More the merrier if its not free

 GARIMA SINGH AMP; JAYATI GHOSE

 New Delhi, Nov. 20: India Inc wants more trade with China but is apprehensive about entering into a free trade agreement (FTA) with it.

 Ever since bilateral trade ties became stronger, Indian industry has feared competition from China even as it profited from lower input costs from Chinese suppliers.

 Venugopal Dhoot, chairman of Videocon Group of Companies, which invested about Rs 1,000 crore in buying out Thomson SAs Chinese arm, said, FTA is a primary concern for the white goods industry. We request the government to take adequate measures to protect domestic manufacturers just as China does to safeguard its own industry.

 Dhoot, however, added, President Hu Jintaos visit certainly will give a fillip to bilateral trade.

 IT firms like Wipro, TCS, Infosys, Satyam and NIIT feel opening up of trade ties with China will complement India Incs growth story.

 The IT and IT-enabled services market in Japan and South Korea needs to be penetrated through Indo-Chinese joint ventures, said Puneet Kumar, GM corporate affairs, Wipro.

 India has a lead time of seven years over China in IT software application development and services. More than posing any problems, it will infuse greater competition and acknowledge development because Chinese companies are aggressive in technology and pricing, said N.K. Goyal, president of Indian Manufacturing Foundation and chairman, emeritus, Telecom Equipment Manufacturers Association.

 The effort to cement bilateral ties will prove beneficial as the two countries are trying to capture market shares in developed nations like the US and European Union, said .P. Lohia, managing director, Indo Rama.

 Chinese telecom firms in India will strengthen the domestic telecom industry, said a senior Nokia official.

 Samsung India deputy managing director Ravinder Zutshi, however, said, As long as the FTA is not signed, it does not pose a major concern.

 For India, just five commodities make up for more than 80 per cent of its total exports to China. Chinas export basket, however, is widely dispersed. Businessmen, therefore, feel if trade is further liberalised, the major gainer will be China.

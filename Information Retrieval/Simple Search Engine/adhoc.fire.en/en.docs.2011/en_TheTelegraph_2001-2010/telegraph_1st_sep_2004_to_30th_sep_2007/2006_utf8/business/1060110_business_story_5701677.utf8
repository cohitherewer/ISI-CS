 Oracle banks on Indian market

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Jan. 9: India and China will be the key markets for Oracle Corporations business in the Asia-Pacific region. 

 India and China are the two key markets for us as far as the Asia-Pacific region is concerned, Oracle senior vice-president (Asia-Pacific) Keith Budge told reporters here today. India is being increasingly seen as a priority market for research and development and services, he added.

 Oracle has already been working closely with local partners in India such as Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys and Satyam and will continue to do so in the future, he said.

 Commenting on the performance of the company during the last year, Budge said the company had won a lot of clients. We have won more than 400 business opportunities in 2005 in the country, he said.

 In the last accounting year (June 2004-May 2005), the Asia-Pacific region contributed 15 per cent to Oracles global revenue, Budge said, adding that revenues from the region increased 17 per cent on an annual basis for the second quarter ended November last to $469 million. 

 The enterprise software giant will also organise a two-day conference series, Oracle Open World, in Mumbai beginning tomorrow in association with its local partners. The seminar-cum-exhibition series will showcase Oracles software solutions for the Indian market.

 Meanwhile, a survey, commissioned by the company, revealed that India Inc has accelerated the adoption of grid technology to manage and support growth. 

 According to the Oracle Grid Index, which maps the worlds journey to grid computing, India registered the fastest growth. Grid computing is the co-ordinated use of many servers and storage in an enterprise acting as one large computer. 

 According to Oracle India, a subsidiary of Oracle Corporation, the countrys performance in the Grid Index III was exemplary ? it moved from 2.9 to 4.4, registering the fastest growth of 52 per cent. The Oracle Grid Index is based on three underlying indices that include foundation readiness, knowledge and interest and adoption lifecycle.

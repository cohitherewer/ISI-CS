 Mumbai, March 15: The domestic mutual fund industry is finally coming of age.

 Buoyed by the booming stock market, retail investors interest and a slew of new fund offerings, the assets under management (AUM) of the mutual funds swelled by 4.56 per cent in February.

 The combined AUM of all the 28 mutual fund houses at the end of the reporting month stood at Rs 2,17,472 crore, a rise of Rs 9,490 crore, according to the figures released by the Association of Mutual Funds of India (Amfi).

 The new fund offerings, which closed during the month, have mobilised over Rs 2,500 crore. 

 Some of the new issues were Kotak Lifestyle fund, which closed on February 22, Prudential ICICI Fusion Fund closed on February 27 and Standard Chartered Imperial Equity Fund that closed on February 21. Two tax savings funds, which also closed during the month, were Tata Tax Advantage Fund-1 and Deutsche Tax Saving Fund.

 However, eight asset management companies reported a decline in total assets during the month, including large fund houses like Prudential ICICI, Franklin Templeton and Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund and others were Benchmark, ING Vysya, JM Financial, Sahara and Sundaram Mutual Fund. 

 According to the Amfi figures, HSBC mutual fund gained the most in terms of AUM, which went up by 44 per cent, or Rs 2,772 crore, to Rs 9,060 crore during the month.

 In January, the AUM of mutual funds grew 4.39 per cent at Rs 2,07,982 crore.

 Some big-ticket mutual fund plans that closed in January were SBI Bluechip Fund with Rs 2,850 crore, UTI Leadership Equity Fund with Rs 2,080 crore, HSBC Advantage India Fund with Rs 1,659 crore and HDFC Long Term Equity Fund with Rs 1,450 crore. While 62 mutual fund plans, including 15 equity schemes, closed in the last two months, several issues are still open. Expected big issues, including Reliance Equity Fund and UTI Contra Fund, are scheduled to close during the month.

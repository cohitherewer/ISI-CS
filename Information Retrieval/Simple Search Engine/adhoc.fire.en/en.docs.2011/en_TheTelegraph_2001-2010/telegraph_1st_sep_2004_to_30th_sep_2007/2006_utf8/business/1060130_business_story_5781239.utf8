 Shift in bank income profile

 GAURAV CHOUDHURY

 New Delhi, Jan. 29: Banks may turn to fee-based income from services such as wealth management, mutual funds and insurance to make up for low treasury income and decline in profits from trading.

 Analysts said banks are likely to explore emerging opportunities in the wealth management segment, particularly for high-networth individuals, through mutual funds, deposits and insurance.

 Research shows the overall value of high-networth individuals is increasing at a compounded annual growth rate of 22 per cent per annum. As retail income continues to grow, there are opportunities for banks to raise fee-based income.

 Commercial banks investments in government securities have remained more or less flat over the last one year. Between August 2004 and 2005, investments in G-secs have increased by less than Rs 35,000 crore. In August 2004, the total amount was Rs 7,03,466 crore, while in the corresponding month of 2005 the figure stood at Rs 7,38,604 crore.

 Government securities are rupee-denominated obligations issued by the RBI on behalf of the government for deficit financing. The sovereign bond market constitutes about 70 per cent of the countrys debt market.

 Bankers attribute this flattening of the G-Sec portfolio curve to lower profits from these instruments, limited trading opportunities and higher corporate credit-offtake in recent times.

 Banks have a huge network due to which they can get into distribution of third-party products like insurance. Credit cards too are emerging as a fast source of fee income, a top executive of a PSU bank said.

 He said private banks may see an increase of about 40-50 per cent in their fee income, while in the case of public sector banks, it could be about 15-20 per cent in the current fiscal (2005-06).

 Besides, there are also emerging opportunities in the areas of money remittances and bancassurance instruments.

 Analysts said due to reduced spreads, bank marketing has to go beyond loans and deposits and focus on non-interest income. Bankers expect competition would shift more towards service fees and customised instruments. 

 For example, banks may consider giving concessions to people who buy a large number of drafts in a month and frequently make remittances, a banker said.

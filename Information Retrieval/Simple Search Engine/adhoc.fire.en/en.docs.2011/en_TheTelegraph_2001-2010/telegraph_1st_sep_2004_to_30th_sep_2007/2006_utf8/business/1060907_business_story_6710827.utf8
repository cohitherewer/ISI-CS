 Kerala energiser for Tata Tea

 Siganporia: Glad tidings

 Calcutta, Sept. 6: Tata Tea is close to getting a blanket approval from the Kerala government and the Centre to utilise 5 per cent of the total area under cultivation for alternate cropping in its Kerala plantations.

 The companys south Indian plantation operations (Sipo) comprises primarily of the Kerala gardens. The total area under cultivation or bearing hectareage under Sipo is 11,607 hectares in 25 plantations.

 Of this, 17 gardens form part of Kannandevan, a worker-managed co-operative and six are under subsidiary Tata Coffee. Tata Tea now has two gardens with 750 hectares.

 We want all our estates to be self-sufficient hubs, which would not only have the skills to harvest and market tea but also supplement income through other commodities. The company is looking at forming an ecosystem, which would feed such diversification activities and lead to almost doubling the existing income of the plantation workers. This would also hold true for non-contiguous plantations like the ones in Assam, said Percy Siganporia, managing director of Tata Tea.

 The company is also lobbying with the Bengal government to allow using tea cultivation land for activities other than tourism.

 Tata Tea is already experimenting with multi-cropping options in its two northeastern plantations in Borjan and Hatikuli.

 To evaluate the prospects of non-agriculture alternative revenue streams, Tata Tea had appointed Globally Managed Services, a consultancy firm.

 Tata Tea was earlier looking at balancing its domestic growth and long-term sustainability of plantations business by foraying into alternate cropping like vegetables, floriculture and herbs and medicinal plants.

 This comes at a time when the restructuring of the north Indian plantation operations (Nipo) is close to completion.

 Nipo, which comprises 24 gardens with four in Bengal and the rest in Assam, has a bearing hectareage of 14,406 and is commercially valued much higher than the Sipo.

 Tata Tea will have a higher stake in the co-operative for north Indian operations because of the high valuation of the gardens than in Kannandevan, where the workers have a 74 per cent stake.

 The diversification will help supplement income of the workers.

 While the Kannandevan model involved reducing the number of permanent workers from 18,000 to 12,000, the restructuring of Nipo would keep the 31,044 employees, including 29,276 workers, intact.

 The company has sent employee groups and trade union members to visit the Kannandevan model and the response was quite positive.

 Tata Tea is obtaining various other approvals for the restructuring, Siganporia said.

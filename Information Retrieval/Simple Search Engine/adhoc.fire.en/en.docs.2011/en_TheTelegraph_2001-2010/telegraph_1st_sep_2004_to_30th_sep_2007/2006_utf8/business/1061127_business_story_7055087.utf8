 Govt to mend gaps in free trade pacts

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 New Delhi, Nov. 26: The finance ministry has sought clarity about the definition of rules of origin in free trade agreements (FTA) and preferential trade agreements, to block pass-through imports from countries which are not part of the FTA, preventing loss of revenue. 

 India has an FTA with Thailand and is exploring the possibility of such deals with China, Malyasia, Japan, Korea and the Gulf Co-operation Council.

 Negotiations are on with the Asean for the India-Asean Regional Trade and Investment Area that envisages free trade in goods, services and investment with the regional bloc.

 Officials feel the government needs to carefully evaluate the tariff lines to be included in all the agreements.

 Their argument is that clear rules of origin clause in FTAs will prevent pass through from countries that are not part of the pact. A minimum value addition level of 50-60 per cent should be prescribed, officials said. 

 The government is also keen to address the problem of inverted duty structure, a result of duties on finished products falling below that of inputs, through the pacts. 

 Finance ministry officials said North Block was in talks with the ministries of commerce, textiles, and industry and the Planning Commission on this issue. 

 Officials said a series of inter-ministerial consultations was planned to address the genuine concerns about competitiveness of Indian industry.

 They referred to instances of zero-duty import of white goods from Thailand under the free trade pact with the country, which envisages elimination of duty on 82 selected items in two years, while the duty on the inputs needed to make the products in India remains unchanged. 

 In addition to inverted duty, the government also wants to prepare a policy on FDI. 

 It fears an MNC may prefer to invest in the country with which India has a free trade pact if that country has easier rules for FDI, and leverage the zero-duty arrangement for export to India.

 The officials feel norms for FDI should reflect the reality of FTAs, through a check on excessive tax sops while ensuring speedy clearances and avoiding problems at the local level relating to land allotments, power connections and environment clearances.

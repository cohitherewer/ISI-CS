 State Bank taste for asset trade

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Purwar: In demand

 Mumbai, March 20: The State Bank of India (SBI) is poised to enter the fledgling domestic securitisation market in June, which currently comprises only private sector and foreign banks. The countrys largest bank hopes to securitise close to 25-30 per cent of its assets over two years.

 Securitisation is a process through which a banks performing assets (housing, auto loans) are packaged, converted into tradable securities and sold to third-party investors. 

 ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank and Citibank are active players in this segment and public sector banks have largely been investors in these securities.

 Industry circles said the entry of SBI will go a long way in expanding the scope of securitisation in India. Of late, nationalised banks have started talking of securitisation. With the entry of SBI, the process could really gain momentum, sources from a leading private sector bank said.

 SBIs securitisation plan was unveiled by bank chairman A.K. Purwar here today on the sidelines of the 16th Asian Corporation Conference organised by the Asia Society and the Confederation of Indian Industry.

 We are trying to take tottering steps and will securitise quite a bit, starting from June, he said, adding that it would take the bank a couple of years to enlarge its securitised portfolio. SBI will first get a feel of the market before ramping up, Purwar added.

 Securitisation is becoming a supplementary source of income. Globally, securitisation accounts for 25-30 per cent of the total assets. We take to deposits for lending. Now things have to change, he said. 

 SBI, like all other banks, is now facing a robust demand for loans from both companies and the retail sector. With limited resources available to feed this appetite, the bank is not only looking at securitisation but is also planning to raise close to Rs 4000 crore through a subordinated debt issue in July. Subordinated debt ranks lower than senior and other classes of debt for repayment if the issuer defaults. It, therefore, offers a higher rate of interest to lure investors.

 According to Purwar, the bank has achieved a highest ever credit growth of 28-30 per cent. He added that the bank has enough room to mobilise resources through a subordinated debt issue, which the bank proposes to put forth between July and September. 

 We have room on the subordinated debt side and will go for a subordinated issue of about Rs 3,000 to Rs 4,000 crore immediately between July and September, he said, while reiterating that the bank is also looking at a follow-on offering to raise capital.

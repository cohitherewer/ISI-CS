The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Slide finds its match in surge

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai April 26: After the second biggest fall yesterday since April 12, the stock market today staged its second biggest bounceback since April 17 with a surge of 292 points. 

 That was also the day when the market rebounded after a plunge and rose by 302 points. 

 Part of the meltdown in the market in the last trading session is due to increase in margins. Recovery in Asia coupled with encouraging growth data from the US gave confidence to the market today, said V.K. Sharma of Anagram Stock Broking. 

 Key indices in Asia like Hong Kongs Hang Seng, Japans Nikkei and South Koreas Kospi were up between 0.5-1.5 per cent. 

 The 30-share BSE sensex jumped 292.75 points or 2.5 per cent to 11938.53, while the Nifty gained 93.10 points or 2.69 per cent to 3555.75. BSE clocked a turnover of Rs 4,519 crore compared with Rs 4,588 crore yesterday. 

 The expiry of the derivatives contracts tomorrow saw a significant covering of the short positions which primarily caused todays rally, said Shashi Bhudhan of IL amp;FS Investsmart. 

 The derivatives segment on the NSE today registered an all-time high daily turnover of Rs 56,340 crore due to rollover of April contracts to May, ahead of expiry on Thursday. The turnover yesterday was lower at Rs 47,208 crore. 

 Heavy FII sales and rising crude prices also depressed sentiments. However, the latest FII investment estimate shows that they have not sold as heavily as was expected by the market, which again lifted the mood. A fall in the crude prices also helped the rally, explained Sharma. 

 The current strength of the market should hold tomorrow and we should see a fair closure for the month, said Bhushan. 

 He said mutual funds, which have been witnessing record mobilisation, also came in to buy at lower levels. The latest data showed that mutual funds bought shares worth a net Rs 217.43 crore yesterday, when the sensex tumbled 268 points. The cumulative inflow of mutual funds in equities in April 2006 touched Rs 1,996 crore. The attention was on real estate developers and companies possessing large chunks of land. 

 Auto stocks registered smart gains, revved up by the strong quarterly show of Maruti. 

 quot;Since the frontline stocks have run up largely, the mid and small cap stocks now look more attractive as there exists room for valuation in these scrips. However, the call on such shares should be taken on a selective basis based on individual companys performance and earnings potential, Sharma said.

 ECBs alter foreign debt profile

 Calcutta, Oct. 1: If the widening current account deficit in the countrys balance of payment has caused concern, comforts can be drawn from the improved capital account position.

 The data of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) shows some qualitative changes in the countrys balance of payment data during the first quarter of this fiscal. 

 Foreign exchange reserves as on June 30, 2006, stood at $163 billion compared with the countrys external debt stock of $132.1 billion. The reserves, thus, provide enough cover (123.3 per cent) to the external debt stock.

 While external debt as on June 30 has increased to $132.1 billion from $125.2 billion on March 31 and $119.2 billion on December 31, 2005, the prime contribution to the rise in this debt stock was that of overseas commercial borrowings by the corporate sector both public and private followed by an increase in NRI deposits in banks. 

 The share of concessional loans taken by the government has also come down to 30.2 per cent of the total debt on June 30 from 31.5 per cent on March 31. 

 This share was 45.9 per cent in March, 1991, when the government launched reforms.

 External commercial borrowings (ECBs) by companies in overseas syndicated loans, foreign currency convertible debentures and commercial loans from foreign banks increased by $5.4 billion between April and June this year. 

 This constitutes more than 78 per cent of the incremental external debt stock.

 The spur in overseas borrowings by the corporate sector reflects increased investment activity in the domestic market. 

 The external debt statistics of the Reserve Bank of India also reveals that long-term debt accounts for 93 per cent of the total debt stock, while the remaining 7 per cent are short-term debt (less than one year).

 Domestic companies raised a large part of their ECBs in dollars, which is 46.1 per cent of the total ECBs on June 30. 

 This resulted in a valuation gain of $4.9 billion (compared with a valuation loss of $4.3 billion in the corresponding quarter of the previous fiscal), reflecting the appreciation of major currencies against the greenback.

 There was also a pre-payment of external debt during April-May amounting to $59.2 million, besides the redemption of India Millennium Deposits last year.

 All of these indicate there has been a gradual shift in the composition of external debt towards non-concessional loans by private borrowers from concessional debt by the government.

 KKRs $50-bn secret bid for Vivendi

 New York, Nov. 4: In a sign of the increasing firepower of private equity, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts amp; Company (KKR) secretly made a $50-billion bid last month for Vivendi, the French entertainment and telecommunications company, according to people involved in the talks. 

 The takeover bid marks the largest leveraged buyout offer in history and demonstrates the growing prowess of private equity on the global stage. Negotiations between Kohlberg Kravis and Vivendi, which reached a fevered pitch late last month after taking place in fits and starts, appear to have stalled if not collapsed entirely, people involved in the talks said. 

 Still, one person involved in the talks suggested that it remained possible the talks could resume. Another person involved in the discussions, however, called Kohlberg Kraviss bid just an opening salvo and described the negotiations as dead and not coming back.

 Whatever the case, the negotiations represent the latest example of private equitys ability to take aim at some of the worlds largest companies, once considered unthinkable prey. Flush with some $2 trillion in buying power, private equity is now focusing its attention on blue-chip firms and setting records for bigger and bigger takeovers. In the last year, Kohlberg Kravis led a consortium of investors to acquire HCA for $33 billion, eclipsing the record that it had held for its takeover of RJR Nabisco in 1989, a deal that came to define an era when it was chronicled in the book Barbarians at the Gate.

 Other deals, like the $15-billion purchase of the gas pipeline company Kinder Morgan or the sale of Freescale Semiconductor for $17.6 billion to a group of private equity firms led by the Blackstone Group and Bain Capital, have redefined the size and scope of leveraged buyouts, once called boot straps.

 The big buyouts also come as equity is under increased scrutiny by shareholders and regulators. Some shareholders have complained that private equity firms have been able to buy public companies at massive discounts and have been able to quickly flip them after larding them up with debt and extracting enormous fees. 

 The Department of Justice, meanwhile, is looking into whether private equity firms that form consortiums are breaking antitrust laws and trying to drive down buyout premiums.

 While it is unclear whether talks between Vivendi and Kohlberg Kravis will resume, the negotiations potentially expose Vivendi to questions about its future. The company initiated the discussions, people involved in them said, and then broke off the negotiations after several weeks of intense meetings. Vivendi had previously rejected an informal takeover offer last May from Sebastian Holdings, a Norwegian investment company that had expressed interest in buying Vivendi and breaking it up. Kohlberg Kravis had a special relationship with Vivendi: Henry Kraviss wife, Marie-Jose Kravis, had been a member of Vivendis supervisory board, though she stepped down from it last March. 

 While it was unclear whether KKR had formally lined up other private equity firms to join a consortium, it had been in discussions with JP Morgan Chase and Citigroup about financing the transaction.

 Calcutta, July 12: The merger of Arcelor with Mittal Steel will not impact the Luxembourg-based steel company?s technology tie-up with Tata Steel.

 Arcelor had given Tata Steel a technology licence to develop speciality steel for the automotive industry in 2003.

 Tata Steel deputy managing director T. Mukherjee said the company did not anticipate any problem with the tie-up.

 ?Arcelor will honour the agreements made by it before the merger with Mittal Steel,? he said on the sidelines of the annual general meeting of Tata Metaliks here today. 

 According to the deal, Arcelor had granted Tata Steel a licence to use its proprietary product, Extragal, including the trademark and associated know-how. 

 With Mittal Steel, now Arcelor-Mittal, planning to set up a plant in India where Tata Steel has a strong presence, there was speculation on the future of the tie-up. 

 Extragal, which is a pure zinc hot dip galvanised (HDG) product, was specifically developed for the automotive sector.

 Arcelor also helps market this product in India and some selected countries in certain volumes. Arcelor assists Tata Steel in producing and marketing, including educating Indian customers on the benefits of this new material.

 Mukherjee said Tata Steel had exported 30,000 tonnes of this product last year through Arcelor. The company has a production capacity of 300,000 tonnes per annum in Jamshedpur.

 Tata Metaliks net

 Tata Metaliks, a Tata Steel subsidiary, 

 has recorded net sales of Rs 159.07 crore in the quarter 

 ended June 30, 2006 compared with Rs 90.64 crore in the 

 same period last year, registering a growth of 75 per cent. 

 However, higher input cost pressure depressed the net profit 

 by 31 per cent to Rs 10.57 crore from Rs 15.48 crore in 

 the year-ago period.

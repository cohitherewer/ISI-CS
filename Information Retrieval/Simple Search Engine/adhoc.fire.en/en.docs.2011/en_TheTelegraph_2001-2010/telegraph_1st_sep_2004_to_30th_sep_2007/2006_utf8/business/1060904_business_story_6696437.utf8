 Numaligarh in naphtha fix

 S.P.S. PANNU 

 New Delhi, Sept. 3: The petroleum ministry is concerned over the prospects of Numaligarh Refinery Ltd if it is asked to supply naphtha for the proposed Assam gas cracker project at a fixed price.

 Sources said the ministry favoured a review of prices, though Gail as the main promoter of the petrochemical project that houses the gas cracker unit preferred a fixed price for the feedstock.

 The estimates of the Rs 5,460-crore petrochemicals project will change if naphtha prices are revised.

 Numaligarh is expected to provide naphtha to the petrochemical complex at Rs 15,000 per tonne. It sells the feedstock to NTPC and Haldia Petrochemicals at Rs 33,000 per tonne. 

 Since the price of crude has shot up to Rs 26,000 per tonne, Numaligarh will incur heavy losses if it sells naphtha at the earlier price.

 The petroleum ministry has now asked the ministry of chemicals and fertilisers, which is steering the project, to rework naphtha prices such that the central government bears the subsidy.

 Sources said any increase in the price of naphtha would also raise the prices of petrochemical products.

 If the naphtha prices are fixed, the burden will be onerous for Numaligarh which is just beginning to take off. 

 The Assam petrochemicals complex, to be set up at Lepetkata in Dibrugarh district, will be implemented by a joint venture company to be promoted by Gail with 70 per cent equity participation. The remaining 30 per cent equity will be shared equally among OIL, NRL and the Assam government.

 The hitch over the naphtha prices has delayed the agreement for the joint venture company. Sources said the government has asked Gail to delink naphtha prices from the signing of the agreement.

 Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi is reported to have met petroleum minister Murli Deora to discuss the gas cracker project and the latter is reported to have assured him that the government would meet its deadline for completing the project in five years.

 The petrochemical complex will comprise a cracker unit, downstream polymer and integrated utility plants. The complex has been configured with a capacity of 220,000 tons per annum of ethylene and 60,000 tons per annum of propylene with natural gas and naphtha as feed stock. ONGC and OIL will supply the natural gas for the project.

 The project is expected to generate substantial employment from investments in downstream plastic processing industries and allied activities.

 How to make a crore

 Its not the stuff of dreams. Srikumar Bondyopadhyay explains how you can make the grade 

 Do you want to be a crorepati? Who doesnt? But how can a salaried person become a crorepati unless one has a steady stream of under-the-table income, inherits a huge ancestral property, or wins a Kaun Banega Crorepati gameshow or a lottery? 

 But before you do a double take, hear this: if you follow a simple and disciplined investment strategy, you can become a crorepati in 15-20 years. 

 Not convinced? Where do you invest to avail of the tax deduction under section 80C? Just check out Table 1 which gives you a picture of how Rs 1 lakh invested every year swells to Rs 1 crore over a period of time. 

 Key factor

 What is crucial in this scheme of things is the average annual rate of return on investment. If your investments are earning you a 10 per cent average return every year, you become a crorepati after 25 years. If you can manage a 15 per cent return every year, you become a crorepati in just 20 years. With a 20 per cent rate of return, you can have Rs 1 crore in your balance in 16 years only. 

 And remember that ones past savings are assumed to be zero here. If that is taken into account, one can reach the Rs 1-crore mark earlier. In fact, past savings play a big role in the entire scheme. 

 The question now arises: in which instruments should one invest to realise the dream? Though there is no one-size-fits-all formula, assets can be broadly classified into two categories fixed income and equity. We are not considering other asset classes such as commodities and real estate because these are not preferred investment avenues for small investors. Although many of us have already purchased a house with a loan from a bank or a housing finance institution, it is not for the purpose of an investment per se. 

 The investment strategy we are talking about thus hinges on how efficiently one allocates ones investible fund between fixed income assets, such as bank fixed deposits, NSC, PPF and EPF, and equities. 

 Investment experts have a thumb rule for asset allocation: the percentage of equity investment in ones overall portfolio should be 100 minus the age of the investor. For example, if you are 30 years old, 70 per cent of your total investment should be in equities. The remaining 30 per cent should be in other asset classes. There is, however, no hard and fast rule to this. If age is on your side and you can take risks, you can have more exposure in equities. Table 1 also illustrates that the higher the rate of return on investments, the quicker you become a crorepati. 

 But the risk-taking ability is not the same for all. So let us choose the middle path allocating investment between fixed-income assets and equities in the proportion of 50:50. At this point, you should consider the investments you have already made, be it in PPF or in a bank fixed deposit, NSC and life insurance (non unit-linked plans). Even your monthly contributions from salary towards the Employees Provident Fund and other superannuation funds should be taken into account to determine total investments in fixed income assets. A salaried person has no choice but to contribute a part of his or her tax deductible investment under 80C.

 Stock-taking

 To start with, take stock of your total past investments and how much of them are in fixed-income assets. If it is more than 50 per cent, you should divert the amount in excess of 50 per cent into equity investments, such as equity-linked savings schemes of mutual funds. Fresh investments of, say Rs 1 lakh, every year (for tax saving) should also be made in the same proportion between fixed income assets and equities. 

 At present, fixed-income tax saving instruments are giving an 8 per cent rate of return on a cumulative basis. This means that the portion of your equity investment must fetch a 12 per cent annual return so that the overall portfolio return is 10 per cent per annum and you accumulate Rs 1 crore in 25 years after adopting the investment strategy. 

 To achieve a 15 per cent overall return every year, your equity investments must pay out an annual return of 22 per cent every year, so that you become a crorepati in 20 years! 

 For a 20 per cent return on the entire portfolio, the equity component must yield 32 per cent every year. 

 Reality check

 Let us now do a reality check. From 1979 till date, the sensex has given a maximum compounded annual return of 27 per cent on a 15-year rolling basis. During the same period, the minimum return was 13 per cent. So it can be assumed that a 20-22 per cent annual return on equity investment over the next 20 years, given the economic growth outlook of the country, would not be too far fetched an idea. 

 Now, let us turn to the return on fixed-income assets. The interest rate of 8 per cent is unlikely to be sustained at the current level in the long run, particularly after the rupee is made convertible in capital account and our economy gets more integrated with global economies. In all likelihood, the rates are likely to come down in future. In that case, a reallocation of assets in favour of equities will be warranted the depletion in returns from fixed income assets will have to be replenished with a higher return from equity investment. In short, building a savings of Rs 1 crore is not a distant dream even for a salaried person.

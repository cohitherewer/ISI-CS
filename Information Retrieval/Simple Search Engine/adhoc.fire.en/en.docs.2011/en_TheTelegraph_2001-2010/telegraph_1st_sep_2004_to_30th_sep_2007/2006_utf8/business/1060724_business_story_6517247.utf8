 Shareholders owe it to Ambanis

 VIVEK NAIR

 Mumbai, July 23: The Ambani brothers may be battling each other even after the demerger of the Reliance empire, but the shareholders arent complaining.

 When the group broke up in January, the Ambanis had said the demerger would unlock shareholder value.

 Six months on, its time to take a reality check.

 A quick back-of-the-envelope calculation reveals that the shareholders have made a 39 per cent gain in valuations since the carve up of Reliance Industries on January 18.

 The incremental value generated is not only because the RIL shareholder obtained shares of the four entities that were spun off and now belong to the Reliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group (R-ADAG) but also because the markets confidence in a rump RIL (minus the value of the four interests of communications, financial services, and coal and gas-related energy business) has soared since the beginning of this year.

 On January 17, RIL was traded for the last time as a combined entity on the bourses. The scrip had closed on that day at Rs 928.15 on Bombay Stock Exchange.

 On the following day, a pre-market session was held to discover the price of a rump RIL stock. It fell by Rs 212.65 in the pre-market session. The stock has since clawed back all those losses as the markets continue to remain upbeat about the course that is being charted by chairman Mukesh Ambani. 

 In this process, the shareholder of RIL has gained the most. Even a person buying the scrip on January 17 is now earning a positive return on the investment. During the same period, the sensex has seen a gain of only 8.28 per cent. The index had on that day ended at 9314.13.

 But had an investor bought 100 RIL shares on that day (which would have given him 100 shares each of the four demerged entities as well), one would be earning a return of almost 39 per cent inclusive of the 100 per cent dividend declared by RIL for the last year.

 The RIL shareholders were allotted shares of Reliance Communication Ventures Ltd (now called Reliance Communications Ltd), Reliance Capital Ventures Ltd (RCVL), Reliance Ventures Ltd (REVL) and Reliance Natural Resources Ltd (RNRL). Now, RCVL and REVL are being merged with Reliance Capital Ltd (RCL) and Reliance Energy Ltd (REL) respectively. 

 Recently, R-ADAG said the amalgamation of REVL with REL has become effective from July 17 and the merger of RCVL with RCL has been completed from the same date.

 Five shares of RCL will be issued for every 100 of RCVL and 7.5 shares of REL will be issued for every 100 of REVL.

 The RIL scrip had ended at Rs 928.15 on January 17. Last Friday, it closed at Rs 967.55. 

 If one were to include the market price of the four demerged company shares as well, the cumulative price works out to almost Rs 2,080 per share. It would have been higher, had it not been for the sharp downturn in equity values seen last week.

 Among the two groups, it has been the R-ADAG shares, particularly Reliance Communications and RNRL, which have witnessed some erosion in values from their highs. Although analysts are positive in their outlook for the companies over the long term, it has been the RIL share which has been able to withstand not only the market volatility but also disappointment that was generated from the first-quarter results (April-June). 

 The optimism of analysts has only grown since Mukesh threw light on the retail revolution plans. Corporate cognoscenti are equally positive about the prospects of RILs existing businesses.

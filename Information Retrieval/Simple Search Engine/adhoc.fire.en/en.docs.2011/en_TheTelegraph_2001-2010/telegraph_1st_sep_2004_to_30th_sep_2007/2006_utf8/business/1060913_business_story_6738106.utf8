 Calcutta, Sept. 12: The Bengal government has appointed rating agency Crisil to study the emerging infrastructure needs of the state.

 Crisil would prepare a document and submit to the state government in two months, Bengal commerce and industry minister Nirupam Sen said at a seminar on logistics organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) here today.

 The study was necessary against the backdrop of the states growing importance in trade with Asean countries, Sen said.

 We have to see the requirements, especially in north Bengal, as the trade relation with Saarc and Asean countries grow, Sen added.

 Infrastructure development in north Bengal is also critical in the wake of opening border trade with China through Nathu-La in Sikkim.

 The minister also said a second airport might be necessary at Calcutta. The need will be determined by a pre-feasibility study.

 If we see that the expansion of the present airport is not meeting the demand, a greenfield one will be built and I hope the Centre will agree to it, he said adding that a pre-feasibility study report would be due soon.

 Speaking at the seminar, Union civil aviation secretary Ajay Prasad also affirmed Calcuttas importance resulting from growing ties with Asean.

 The city would be a natural hub for aviation with the Asean and Saarc countries, he added.

 The Centre is exploring an open-sky policy with Asean member states like Thailand and Malaysia.

 If it comes through, there will be no restriction on the number of flights or destination between India and Asean member countries.

 Prasad also highlighted the various initiatives being taken by the civil aviation sector to upgrade passenger, freight and cargo facilities across the country.

 According to the civil aviation secretary, 35 smaller airports that are either state capitals or have business or tourist interest would be upgraded across the country. 

Port initiative

 The Agricultural and Processed Foods Products Export Development Authority (Apeda) will set up a perishable goods handling facility at Haldia to boost export of agriculture and floriculture from Bengal.

 We have offered a 2.13-acre plot to Apeda for this, Calcutta Port Trust chairman A.K. Chanda said on the sidelines of the CII seminar.

 Apeda will develop the facility in joint venture with the state government and the Calcutta Port Trust will act as the facilitator for ground handling equipment to the facility.

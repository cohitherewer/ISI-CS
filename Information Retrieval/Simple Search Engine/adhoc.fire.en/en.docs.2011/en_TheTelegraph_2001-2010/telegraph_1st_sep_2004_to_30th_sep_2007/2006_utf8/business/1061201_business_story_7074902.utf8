 Mumbai, Nov. 30: L.N. Mittal and San Francisco-based Farallon Capital have jointly picked up a 13.33 per cent stake in Indiabulls Infrastructure Development Limited, the construction and real estate subsidiary of Indiabulls Financial Services, for Rs 447 crore.

 The deal values Indiabulls Infrastructure Development Limited at Rs 3,350 crore. The shareholding of Indiabulls Financial Services in the company is now down to 86.7 per cent, after the acquisition by Mittal and Farallon. 

 Indiabulls Infrastructure Development Limited plans to build world-class infrastructure in special economic zones (SEZs).

 The company will be part of a group of real estate subsidiaries and associates forming Indiabulls Real Estate Limited subsequent to the implementation of the scheme of demerger. The demerger is expected to be completed during the fourth quarter of this fiscal. 

 After the demerger, shareholders will hold one equity share of Indiabulls Financial Services Limited, comprising the financial services business, and one equity share of Indiabulls Real Estate Limited, comprising the real estate and construction development-related business, for each share of the company they currently own. 

 Sameer Gehlaut, chairman and CEO of the Indiabulls group, said the rapid growth of the economy has created great opportunities for the company to create world-class infrastructure facilities. 

 He said the group will leverage its pan-India presence, execution skills, proprietary deal pipeline and a proven track record, in the construction and infrastructure market.

 The confidence of Mittal, a world renowned entrepreneur and investor, and Farallon Capital, one of the worlds top most funds, in Indiabulls Infrastructure Development Limited is a testament to the huge opportunity in front of the company, Gehlaut said in a press statement. 

 Mittal is an investor in Indiabulls Financial Services since 2000, when he acquired 61.3 lakh shares, which is 7.52 per cent in the company, at an average price of Rs 6 per share. 

 This investment of Mittal has appreciated by more than 90 times in six years. 

 Mittal had also invested about Rs 90 crore six months back for 8.4 per cent in Indiabulls Credit Services Limited, an unlisted subsidiary of Indiabulls Financial Services in the consumer loans segment. 

 LNM India Internet Ventures holds 2.56 per cent in Indiabulls Financial Services as on September 30.

 Calcutta, April 26: Tinplate Company of India Limited (TCIL) has posted a 23 per cent growth in profit before tax at Rs 39.5 crore in 2005-06 compared with Rs 32.13 crore in the previous year.

 The Tata Steel subsidiarys topline grew by 58 per cent to Rs 415.39 crore from Rs 263.48 crore in the previous year.

 The company will pay a dividend of 12.5 per cent after 10 years as it wiped out its accumulated losses in 2005-06.

 Managing director Bushen L. Raina said the board has approved a capital expenditure plan of Rs 210 crore.

 The company, which has staged a financial turnaround, will step up capacity at Jamshedpur from 1,80,000 tonnes to 3,80,000 tonnes by 2008.

 The company has a 40 per cent share in the domestic tinplate market. After the expansion, this will go up to 60 per cent.

 A mixture of debt and internal accruals will fund the expansion.

 Raina said the company wished to move up the value chain by providing cost-effective, innovative and consumer-friendly packaging solutions for edibles.

 We will work closely with the brand owners. The idea is to position Tinplate as a complete solution provider, he said.

 With the rapid growth of the domestic food processing industry, the demand for tinplate is only expected to grow in future.

 TCIL had engaged Boston Consulting Group to work out a capacity expansion strategy and the recommendations are already with the company.

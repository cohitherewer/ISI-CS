 Mittal in deal with Total, Lukoil

 New Delhi, Dec. 12 (PTI): In the first signs of falling apart of the pact it had with ONGC, Mittal Steel is believed to have entered into separate deals with Total of France and Lukoil of Russia to acquire oilfields in Africa and Central Asia.

 Mittal Steel, which last year announced its entry into the oil and gas business through two joint ventures with Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), has already on its own picked up a 3 per cent stake in Chevrons under-construction $6-billion Olokola liquefied natural gas (OK-LNG) project in Nigeria.

 Industry sources said Lakshmi N. Mittal is not happy with the progress of ONGC-Mittal Energy Services ltd (OMESL), a joint venture company that was to trade and ship oil and gas, including LNG.

 In June, Mittal Steel signed a pact with Total to jointly acquire oil and gas properties, particularly in Africa, and trade oil and gas produced from such fields. Last month, it signed with Lukoil for specific acquisitions in central Asia, particularly Kazakhstan.

 The officials of neither Mittal Steel nor Total could be immediately reached for comments.

 While the Ongc-Mittal Energy Ltd (OMEL) has landed itself three oil blocks in Nigeria, progress on ONGC-Mittal Energy Services had been slow because of ONGCs new management losing interest in the venture.

 While ONGC has not hidden its reservations on trading in oil and gas with Mittal, it has gone ahead and signed a deal with the Hinduja group to source LNG and is negotiating an OMEL type of agreement with the multi-billion dollar group. 

 Sources said Mittal will get 4.5 million tonnes per annum of LNG from the Olokola liquefied natural gas venture and is looking at taking a stake in big oil and gas projects in Africa and central Asia.

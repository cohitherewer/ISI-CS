 Indiabulls treads safe path

 CHANDRALEKHA TULAL 

 Mumbai, May 24: After being recently hauled up by the market watchdog, Indiabulls Securities is taking no chances in the choppy markets. The brokerage house has issued a circular that lays down strict trading guidelines for its customers. 

 What if a client fails to comply with the guidelines? We would be constrained to freeze the clients trading account forthwith at his risk and consequences the very next day, said Gagan Banga, director, Indiabulls Securities Limited. 

 The circular says, In recent times, with the present upsurge in the market, driven by strong corporate earnings and inflow of fresh funds from overseas and domestic investors, there has been an inherent fear that such a trend is always susceptible to manipulations. 

 It is common knowledge that there are people who take advantage of a buoyant market and try and manipulate certain scrips, both in the cash and the derivatives segment, said Banga. 

 Since we have evidence that people have been trying to manipulate stock prices, we have taken various voluntary steps in the recent past to protect the interests of investors and the capital markets. This is another measure towards that objective, he added. 

 The guidelines strictly prohibit clients of Indiabulls to place any orders in options in the F amp; segment, where the strike price of the option is above or below 25 per cent of the prevailing market price of the underlying share. For example, if the current price of a stock is Rs 1,000, then the strike price of the option should not be above Rs 1,250 or less than Rs 750. 

 There are certain stocks, which have very low volumes in the derivatives segment. We do not want people to take exposure in such scrips at a significant different level from the current price, explained Banga. Other than the derivatives segment, the brokerage house has also instructed its clients not to place any orders in illiquid scrips. 

 The circular says, Please ensure that you do not place any orders in illiquid options or illiquid scrips where circular trades or synchronised trades could be possible. 

 We do not allow clients to trade in stocks in the S, T, TS and Z categories as the stocks are illiquid and there are chances of manipulation, Banga added. 

 The guidelines have also specifically advised the clients not to place reverse orders or square-up orders in options at a significantly different price from the first leg during the same trading day. Significant in this case also means a difference of 25 per cent, said Banga. 

 Indiabulls had issued the guidelines on May 20, after the sensex fell by a huge 826 points on May 18 and another 456 points on May 19. 

 Market sources said that the broking house has taken such steps keeping in view its huge margin funding book and as step to prevent any possible payment problems. 

 quot;We are not aware whether any other broking house has undertaken such measures. However, we shall not allow anyone to use our systems to manipulate the markets, quot; said Banga.

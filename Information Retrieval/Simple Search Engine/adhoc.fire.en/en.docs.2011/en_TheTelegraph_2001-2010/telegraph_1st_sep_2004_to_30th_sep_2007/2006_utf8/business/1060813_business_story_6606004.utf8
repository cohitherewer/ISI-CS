 Stock-option glitch delays Apple results

 Held off

 San Francisco, Aug. 12 (Reuters): Apple Computer Inc said on Friday it told securities regulators it would file its quarterly report late because it has not completed a review of stock-option grants that earlier turned up evidence of significant irregularities.

 Apple also said it received a letter on Friday from staff of the Nasdaq exchange that the delay had placed the company out of compliance with Nasdaqs listing requirements.

 Apple, of Cupertino, California, said it would seek a hearing before the Nasdaq listing qualifications panel and that its shares would remain listed on Nasdaq pending a decision by the panel. Apple said it plans to file its report for the quarter ended July 1 after completing the stock-option review.

 Apple spokeswoman Katie Cotton, asked what was the purpose of the hearing Apple is requesting, said, Well prepare a presentation closer to the hearing date.

 Apple, the maker of Macintosh computers and iPod music players, is among the highest-profile companies looking into past stock options-grants. 

 The US Securities and Exchange Commission has more than 80 investigations under way to determine whether companies manipulated options to generate paper gains for senior executives and employees.

 Apple on June 29 said an internal investigation had discovered irregularities related to the issuance of certain stock option grants made between 1997 and 2001.

 A special committee of Apples outside directors has hired independent counsel to investigate the matter, Apple said in an SEC filing.

 Apple said on August 3 that it would likely need to restate earnings and delay filing its report with the Securities and Exchange Commission because of the options review. It said its financial communications since September 29, 2002 should not be relied on.

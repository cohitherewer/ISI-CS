 India Inc hungry for Europe acquisitions

 Ambani: Looking ahead

 London, Oct. 15 (PTI): India Inc has launched a major offensive to increase its global presence with a significant number of corporate houses making takeover bids for British and European companies ranging from Scottish whisky makers to Welsh steel mills and North Sea oil blocks. 

 Between January and September this year, Indian firms spent more than $7 billion acquiring 112 foreign companies. The equivalent figure was $4.5 billion last year, which indicates the speed at which corporate India is globalising.

 According to a report in the Sunday Times today, Mukesh Ambani, head of Reliance group, is leading the charge. The company was planning to acquire an oil drilling and engineering firm to expand its growing exploration and production business in Africa, South America, West Asia and India, he said. Ambani believes British companies working in the North Sea will become increasingly vulnerable to takeover bids as reserves dwindle.

 Were looking at buying companies in North Sea, Scotland. North Sea (reserves) are depleting with the passage of years, but theres a lot of talent there and this industry is short of talent, he said.

 We will look at takeovers to acquire talent to use in this part of the world, West Africa and places like Columbia. We now have to get experienced talent in Europe to go and find oil in the more frontier areas, he added. 

 There is more than 20 years of North Sea experience in the UK, and we could deploy it globally, Ambani said.

 His statement of intent comes as Vijay Mallya, MP and chairman of the Bangalore-based United Breweries, prepares an offer for the 600-million Glasgow distiller Whyte and Mackay. Earlier this year he bought French winemaker Bouvet-Ladubay after narrowly losing a battle for champagne house Taittinger.

 If Mallyas bid for Whyte and Mackay succeeds, he will acquire its Dalmore and Isle of Jura single malts as well as its blended brands, which he will use to improve his India-made whiskies to boost their international sales.

 The Hinduja brothers, one of Britains wealthiest families, will formally open a truck plant in the Czech Republic next week, which they will use to upgrade their Indian Ashok Leyland lorries.

 Gopichand Hinduja, president of the Hinduja group, who recently paid 60 million for the crown estate headquarters at Carlton House Terrace, said the soaring market capitalisation of Indian firms was a key factor in the countrys rapid globalisation. 

 Look at how aggressively the Indians are coming. Our company took over Avia in the Czech Republic. On Monday, we open with a 20,000-vehicle capacity, the first step for Ashok Leyland in globalisation, he said.

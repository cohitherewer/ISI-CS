 Calcutta, July 21: ITC has decided to enter the wholesale trading of agri commodities to consolidate its farm business as well as rival the models being created by Reliance and Metro Cash amp; Carry of Germany.

 The company is setting up pilot projects in four cities ? Calcutta, Chandigarh, Hyderabad and Pune. These will be operational in the next six months. 

 The company, which began the e-choupal network in 2000 ? a chain of installations in rural India where ITC buys as well as retails farm products ? is now scouting for land to start the business.

 In this model, ITC will assist farmers by giving them inputs, buying the produce from them, carrying it to the cold chain, grading and sorting and ultimately selling to wholesalers, including retail chains.

 This cash and carry business will eventually bring ITCs own retail initiative close to the urban areas.

 The company has evolved the e-choupal model to create choupal sagar, the rural malls. There are about 10 choupal sagars operating in the three states.

 Chairman Y.C. Deveshwar did not rule out the possibility of expanding the retail business to urban areas.

 Few years ago, German major Metro started such wholesale trading in Bangalore and now it is expanding to other cities like Calcutta.

 With Reliance Industries going in big way for wholesale and retail of agri commodities, the entire scenario will change.

 During the annual general meeting of the company today, Deveshwar admitted that the entry of Reliance worries him at times. However, later he told reporters that the market was big enough for all.

 As a company, ITC was one of the first to enter the agri sector, dominated by millions of small and marginal farmers in India, mainly to procure leaf tobacco.

 Fielding a question from a shareholder on why ITC should not quit the tobacco business, Deveshwar said, A large number of farmers are dependent on tobacco farming in the country and we cannot suddenly abandon this business.

 Investment plans

 Deveshwar, 59, who will get another five-year term as the chairman from next year, announced a Rs 15,000-crore investment for the next five years with a major chunk assigned to hotel and paper businesses.

 We want to build a hotel in every state capital. The money is not a problem. The only constraint is land, he said.To begin with, it is building three hotels in Bangalore and one in Chennai apart from expanding the existing one in Calcutta.

 The company today also came out with the first-quarter numbers with a 25.7 per cent growth in net turnover and 21.1 per cent growth in profit after tax of 16.8 per cent. However, after adjusting one off income of Rs 19.49 crore last year, the underlying PAT grew by 21.1 per cent.

 MphasiS to merge with EDS, swap fixed at 5:4

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, July 26: Texas-based EDS is raising its stake in Bangalore-based MphasiS BFL to 61.8 per cent from the present 51.4 per cent as a result of the merger of EDS India into MphasiS BFL. 

 The swap ratio for the merger has been fixed at 5:4, that is, five shares of MphasiS for every four of EDS India, after an independent valuation of the two companies.

 Although the process of operational integration of EDS India into MphasiS is expected to be completed by the year-end, it would have retrospective effect from April 1 this year.

 According to analysts, this merger has a positive upside for MphasiS. More so because EDS is not only one of the worlds largest technology services company but also because it recently won a GM deal. 

 In February, EDS bagged the lions share of GMs multibillion-dollar systems integration services contract. EDS won approximately 70 per cent of the contracts worth $3.8 billion over five years.

 We may expect part of some deals to be given to MphasiS. However, the upside of this merger is the fact that EDS will bring its clients and thus MphasiS may get an opportunity to serve them too, MphasiS CFO Alok Misra told The Telegraph from Bangalore. 

 Jerry Rao, CEO of MphasiS, said, We are excited about the merger. The combined entity will help us achieve an optimal business as we also enhance the service offering to our clients. 

 On news of the merger, the MphasiS shares rose today almost 17.04 per cent to end the day at Rs 157.30 against yesterdays closing of Rs 134.40.

 The proposal of merger is subject to the approval of stock exchanges, shareholders of both companies and high courts of Mumbai and Karnataka.

 GM has always been a big client of EDS. 

 GM contributes $1.1 billion of the $20 billion revenue of EDS.

 Analysts say since India is a low-cost destination, it could be the best option to outsource the deal to India.

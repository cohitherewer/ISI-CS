The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Companies on a hiring high in east

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 13: Unhappy with your current job? Planning to move out to greener pastures? Have a heart. Employers in the east are about to hire in a big way in the upcoming July-September quarter. The net employment outlook for the quarter is 42 per cent, according to the Manpower Employment Outlook Survey Q3 2006. 

 The net employment outlook is a measure of how positive employers are about hiring. It can also be measured as the difference between the number of employers who said their hiring will increase and the number who have said it will decrease.

 Out of the 755 employers surveyed in the eastern region, 45 per cent felt there would be an increase in hiring with only 3 per cent saying there would be a decrease. Around 44 per cent said there would be no change in hiring intentions and 8 per cent were not sure about their hiring plans.

 The net employment outlook in the east is on a par with south India at 42 per cent. It is higher than 41 per cent in the west but much lower than the northern region?s 49 per cent, the survey said. The survey has been conducted across 25 countries over the last 40 years.

 ?At 43 per cent employment outlook, Indian employers reflect the strongest outlook amongst other countries, followed by Hong Kong at 27 per cent and Japan at 24 per cent. The outlook for the services sector is the highest at 50 per cent, with mining and construction close behind at 49 per cent,? said Soumen Basu, executive chairman of Manpower India.

 The eastern and the southern region show higher outlook than the west as the western markets are more mature and there are emerging opportunities in the east and the south, Basu said.

 Nationally, transport and utilities, which had topped the hiring outlook last quarter with 46 per cent, dropped sharply by 9 percentage points for the third quarter as mining and construction sector gained 9 percentage points and services 8 points to emerge as the two top sectors. 

 As part of the survey, Manpower had engaged the services of an external agency and spoken to 4550 employers across segments like services, finance, insurance and real estate, mining, oil and gas, construction, public administration and education, transport and utilities, wholesale, retail trade and manufacturing in the month of May.

 AOC plans to tap retail route 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 11: Taiwan-based TPV Technology Limited plans to retail its AOC brand of computer monitors.

 AOC India plans to sell 15 lakh monitors this year at a turnover of over Rs 800 crore. It sold 12 lakh monitors last year with a turnover of Rs 600 crore.

 The Indian home PC market has crossed 4.5 million units, of which the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) segment comprises 2.7 million. The OEM market has players like HCL, HP and IBM.

 AOC-India already has more than 50 per cent of this market and hopes to extend its presence by targeting the balance 1.8 million channel market, said Saurabh Grover, head of marketing, AOC India.

 The company began its operations in India in 2001 as an OEM supplier.

 In the next couple of years, AOC plans to garner 30 per cent of the overall Indian monitor market.

 Last year AOC sold 1.2 million monitors in India and targets to sell 1.5 million in the current fiscal, Grover added.

 AOC has a complete range of LCD monitors ranging from 15 inches to 20 inches. At present, the company has 10 monitor models and intends to launch five more by the middle of this fiscal.

 Trends show that companies are buying LCD monitors more than CRT monitors because of their advantages.

 LCD monitors, with better picture quality, lower radiation, power consumption and heat generation, have a market share of 15 per cent and is expected to grow to 25 per cent by the end of this fiscal. AOC India would also launch LCD television soon. The price point would be 5 per cent lower than leading players like Samsung.

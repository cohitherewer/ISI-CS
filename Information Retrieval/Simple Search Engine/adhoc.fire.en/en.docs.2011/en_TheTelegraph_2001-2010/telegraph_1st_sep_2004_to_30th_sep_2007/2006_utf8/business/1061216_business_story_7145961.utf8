The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Demerged Zee from Monday

 Coming In Pieces

 Mumbai, Dec 15: Today was the last day for the consolidated Zee Telefilms on the bourses.

 From Monday, Zee Telefilms would start trading as the demerged entity (renamed as Zee Entertainment Enterprises Limited) at price adjusted to the demerger of Wire and Wireless India Limited and Zee News Limited.

 According to the scheme of demerger approved by Bombay High Court, Zee Telefilms has demerged its cable undertaking into Wire amp; Wireless India Limited and the regional and news broadcasting undertaking into Zee News Limited.

 While Wire and Wireless India and Zee News are expected to get listed by February 2007, demerger and listing of Dish TV, which will have the direct-to-home satellite broadcasting business, as a separate entity is likely by March 2007. The scrip of Zee Telefilms today, however, was down 3.48 per cent on the Bombay Stock Exchange and closed at Rs 341 against its previous close of Rs 353.30 amidst a volume of 48.33 lakh shares.

 An SSKI report said, We continue to maintain our positive bias over the business direction of Zee Telefilms rapidly improving content, aggressive content marketing, investment on both the distribution platforms and willingness to bleed. 

 While we are confident of strong growth in the broadcasting operations, capitalisation of distribution businesses, Wire and Wireless India in particular, will hold the key to growth of distribution business, said the report.

 Based on sum of parts valuations, Zee Telefilms is expected to get re-priced at Rs 255-275 after the demerger on December 18. 

 The appointed date for the scheme of arrangement was March 31. 

 According to the scheme, 100 shares in Zee Telefilms would continue as 100 shares in the demerged Zee Entertainment Enterprises. 

 In the other demerged entities, investors got 137 equity shares of Zee News for every 100 held in Zee Telefilms.

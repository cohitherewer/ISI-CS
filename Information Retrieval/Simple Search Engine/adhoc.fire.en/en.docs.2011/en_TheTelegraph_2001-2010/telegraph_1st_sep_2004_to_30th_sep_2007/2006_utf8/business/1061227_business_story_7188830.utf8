 Ground handling rule set for recast

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 New Delhi, Dec. 26: The civil aviation ministry is planning to allow three or more operators to handle the ground business at airports.

 Security agencies, however, want to vet the players, especially the foreign ones before their entry. With tight security at the airports, these agencies feel priority should be given to security issues.

 The new policy will see many aviation companies trying to enter the sector. This includes the proposed joint venture between Air-India (A-I), Indian Airlines (IA) and possibly the Singapore Airport Terminal Services (Sats). The Airports Authority of India is also likely to float a company.

 Private players such as Jet, Reliance, UK-based Menzies Aviation and Swissport International also plan to float new firms; so do existing players such as Cambatta. Dubai-based Dnata is also believed to be keen to join the fray, either independently or as part of a combine.

 Earlier, when there was talk of opening up of ground handling, security concerns were raised about foreign operators. 

 The ministrys proposal is for at least three ground handling companies the airport operator concerned, the Air-India-Indian Airlines combine and one or two private players. 

 The security agencies would like this third company to be cleared by it as well as any foreign partners that the airport operator or the Air-India-Indian Airlines combine takes on. 

 The agencies want to keep an eagles eye on the ground handling operators as this business consists of both passenger and baggage handling at the city side as well as the tarmac side of the airport. 

 Activities to be managed include baggage handling, passenger facilitation, loading and unloading of aircraft, cleaning, fuelling and push-back facilities. With terror threats still real over global skies, these are considered security sensitive.

 The two major airports Delhi and Mumbai are being run by private operators who can offer ground handling services in partnership with any other company. AAI runs most of the other airports in the country and can consequently offer ground handling services in these airports.

 Civil aviation officials said the minister has already asked AAI to prepare a plan. Sources said AAI is scouting for a partner. AAI feels it needs to get into this business as a major chunk of its profits came from Delhi and Mumbai airports. With these airports privatised, it needs to find new ways to add to its bottomline.

 The proposed Air-India-Indian Airlines joint venture is part of the design to merge the two airlines. The merger plan talks of a holding company with separate entities under it and two such entities, according to the plan, will be the engineering and ground handling wings. Already A-I and IA together earn about Rs 800-900 crore from this business, officials said.

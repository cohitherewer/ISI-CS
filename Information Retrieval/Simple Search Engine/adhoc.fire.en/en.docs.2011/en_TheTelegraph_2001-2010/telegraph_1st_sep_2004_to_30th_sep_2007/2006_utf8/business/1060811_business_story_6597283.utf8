 Calcutta, Aug. 10: Cairn Energy Plc, the London FTSE 100-listed Scottish exploration company, will scale up its investment in the Indian oil and gas sector.

 The Edinburgh-headquartered company has already pledged $1 billion to develop four fields in Rajasthan in the short term.

 More funds will flow into another field, Bhagyam, which has the second largest oil reserves in Rajasthan.

 Cairn has projected 150,000 barrels per day (bpd) production from the oilfields in Rajasthan by the end of 2010. Oil will start flowing in from 2008.

 The directorate-general of hydrocarbon (DGH) has approved four field development plans in Rajasthan Mangala, Aishwariya, Saraswati and Raageshwari.

 Cairn is now preparing field development plans for Bhagyam and Shakti fields, which will be submitted within a year.

 Mangala the largest oil discovery in the last 22 years in India has the highest potential among Cairns fields in Rajasthan, followed by Bhagyam and Aishwariya.

 We are yet to work out the funds required for developing Bhagyam. However, it has not been included within the $1- billion investment which we arranged from international banks, said David Nisbet, director of Cairn Energy.

 The proposed maiden offer by Cairns Indian outfit could be one of the sources of funds. However, that would depend on how much Cairn will divest as Nisbet clarified that the company has yet to take a call on dilution.

 Rajasthan has in place reserves of about 3.5 billion barrels, of which 1 billion barrels can be recovered.

 Cairn has, so far, spent $450 million in the Rajasthan block, while $1 billion has been set aside for four approved fields.

 Cairn the operator having 70 per cent interest along with ONGC, which shares the remaining 30 per cent will invest another $1 billion in the 30-year life span of the field.

 The company has, so far, made 18 discoveries in the area.

 Cairn will make it clear how it plans to finance the Bhagyam field at the time of submitting the development plan.

 Ravva field

 The company will start fresh exploration in the Ravva field in offshore Andhra Pradesh this autumn, Nisbet said.

 It started production in 1996 and now produces 50,000 BPD oil. Although it has reached the plateau state when production from a oilfield stagnates Cairn believes there is still some potential there.

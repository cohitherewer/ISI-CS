 Tata group firm in Lanka JV

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 22: Tata International Limited (TIL) today announced setting up a joint venture with Dutch Lanka Trailer Manufacturers (DLT) of Sri Lanka.

 The 50:50 joint venture, to be named Tata International DLT, will make trailers at Chakan in Pune. The company, however, refused to disclose the investment details.

 The Chakan unit will manufacture a range of trailers, such as skeletal trailer, flat-bed trailer, tipper trailer, car carrier, port trailers, cement bulkers and low-bed trailers for all market segments, a company release said.

 The newly formed company will cater to the fast growing requirement of trailers from the fully-built vehicle division of Tata Motors Ltd, which will market the prime mover along with the trailer as a single product to customers. 

 DLT has a manufacturing facility in Sri Lanka, from where it also exports to Bangladesh, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the Philippines, Syria, Iran and a few countries in Africa.

 Over the last 10 years, the company has developed designs for a wide range of trailers. In the last four years, TIL has imported several trailers from DLT and sold them in the Indian market.

 The new JV proposes to manufacture trailers in India based on the designs of DLT developed over the years. These are well suited for the road and loading practices in India and its neighbouring markets, said TIL.

 Tata International reported a global turnover of $1.6 billion in 2005-06. The companys operations are organised into two business lines ? leather and engineering. 

 The engineering business unit is involved in international marketing, global sourcing, warehousing, distribution and supply chain management.

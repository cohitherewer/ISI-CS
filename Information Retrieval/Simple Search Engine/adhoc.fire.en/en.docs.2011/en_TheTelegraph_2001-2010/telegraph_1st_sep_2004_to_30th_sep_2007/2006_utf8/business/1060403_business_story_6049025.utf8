 Cash in hand

Beat inflation with liquid schemes of mutual funds, 

says Srikumar Bondyopadhyay

 For quite some time now, inflation is hovering above the yearly interest rate given by banks on savings deposits ? the most liquid form of assets. Though the weekly inflation rate has come down in the last one year from 5 per cent, it is still ruling at 4 per cent plus. And even when interest rates are rising, banks are giving only 3.5 per cent per annum on deposits in savings accounts.

 So, what does all this mean to the common man? A negative return if surplus money is kept lying idle in a savings bank account. 

 Let?s explain this. A 4.2 per cent annual inflation rate implies that an article for which you had to pay Rs 100 a year ago will cost Rs 104.20 now. If you wanted to buy the article and had postponed the purchase by putting the money in a savings bank account, you would be a loser by Rs 0.70 ? Rs 100 in a savings bank account would have grown to Rs 103.50. 

 The loss may look trifle. But when one has sufficient surplus parked in a savings account, it merits a look at other avenues from where one can earn a return that is equal to or greater than the inflation rate with almost the same ease and liquidity.

 Are there such comparable investment options? Yes, these are liquid or cash schemes of mutual funds. 

 Every mutual fund house offers long-term as well as ultra short-term debt plans. Among the two categories, ultra short-term debt funds, popularly known as cash funds, compare more favourably with bank deposits than long-term plans.

 In long-term schemes, mutual funds invest in long-term debt papers and these should be avoided because the interest rates are increasing both at home and abroad.

 An increase in interest rates leads to a fall in bond prices and hence the net asset value of such schemes.

 Ultra short-term plans invest primarily in money market instruments, short-term treasury bills and government securities, and commercial papers. 

 With tightening liquidity conditions in the economy, cash or liquid schemes look more beneficial.

 Historically, cash funds have yielded over 5 per cent returns over the last 12 months and between 4.9 and 5.1 per cent over the past three years. The better performers in the category have given higher returns.

 Liquid plans have always found favour with companies, high networth individuals and foreign institutional investors because of a more than 4.5 per cent return in a very short span. 

 These schemes garner the largest sums for every mutual fund house. 

 Liquid funds have not caught the fancy of retail investors as the minimum investment required in such schemes is relatively high ? upwards of Rs 25,000 generally. But liquid funds dont entail any entry or exit load, and being predominantly debt funds, their expense ratio is quite low ? between 0.60 per cent and 1 per cent ? compared with other categories of schemes. 

 However, redemption of units and getting the cash remitted may take a day or two. A savings bank account scores better in this regard. 

 So, the best way for a totally risk-averse investor is to split the savings into two parts ? a contingency fund and a surplus fund. Put the contingency fund in a savings bank account for ready liquidity in case of an emergency and stash away the surplus fund in a liquid scheme of a mutual fund. 

 Beat the inflation.

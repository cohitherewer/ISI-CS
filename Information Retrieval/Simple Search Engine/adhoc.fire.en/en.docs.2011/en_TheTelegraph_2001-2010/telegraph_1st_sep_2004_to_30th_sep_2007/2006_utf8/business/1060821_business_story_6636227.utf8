 Edible oil import to drop

 New Delhi, Aug. 20 (PTI): Indias edible oil imports are expected to register a 7-9 per cent dip during the current oil year, which ends in October, primarily due to higher oilseeds output along with offloading of mustard stocks by Nafed, an industry expert said.

 The edible oil imports are likely to remain at around 46-47 lakh tonnes in November-October 2006 compared with 50.41 lakh tonnes last year, Solvent Extractors Association executive director B.V. Mehta said.

 The edible oil imports stood at 30.52 lakh tonnes during November-July 2006, down 15 per cent from last years 35.76 lakh tonnes.

 Mehta pegged edible oil imports at 15-16 lakh tonnes during August-October.

 Indias oilseed production has risen by six lakh tonnes to 267 lakh tonnes this year, he said, adding that Nafed has also started offloading its mustard stocks leading to enhanced availability of oilseeds to processors.

 Oilseed processors are currently utilising only 30 per cent of their installed capacity.

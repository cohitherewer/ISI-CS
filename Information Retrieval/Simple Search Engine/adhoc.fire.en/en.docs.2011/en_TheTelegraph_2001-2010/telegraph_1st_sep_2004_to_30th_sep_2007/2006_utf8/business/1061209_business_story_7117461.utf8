 Calcutta, Dec. 8: Danieli, a leading global player in capital goods for the metal industry, has strengthened its operations in the city.

 The company has spent Rs 15 crore to acquire a huge office space at Rajarhat for its wholly owned Indian subsidiary.

 Danieli worked from Taratolla where it has a small manufacturing unit. It is one of the very few Italian majors which operates in India out of the city.

 The move is a precursor to make Danieli India a hub for sales in other countries.

 It is likely that we will work with our parent and associate companies globally where the engineering support will be provided by the Indian company, Bikramjit Ghosh, executive director of Danieli Engineering India Ltd, said.

 Danielis plants are mostly in Europe, except a big one in China which has made phenomenal growth in steel in the last few years.

 The company plans to recruit more technocrats.

 The percentage of technical people will rise substantially to meet the demand of domestic and international markets, the official added.

 The company is expecting a big demand from the steel sector which is poised to grow several times in the next one and half decades.

 As a result, the company is also contemplating expanding in the country. However, talks in this regard are still at the preliminary stage.

 Ghosh said the company is eying a turnover of Rs 167 crore in the next financial year ending June 2007. At present, the turnover is Rs 110 crore.

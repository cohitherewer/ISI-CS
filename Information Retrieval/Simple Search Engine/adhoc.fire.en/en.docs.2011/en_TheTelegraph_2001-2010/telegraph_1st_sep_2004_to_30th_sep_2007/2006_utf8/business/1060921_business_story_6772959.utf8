 Calcutta, Sept. 20: Saregama plans to become an entertainment company with interests in film production, television software and home video segment.

 The company will produce three films at an investment of Rs 20 crore. It has roped in award-winning director Rituporno Ghosh to make Draupadi. It is in talks to produce a number of other movies as well.

 Moreover, the company is exploring opportunities in television software.

 We no longer want to be known as a music company, but an entertainment one, Saregama chairman Sanjiv Goenka said.

 Music audio, however, continues to be the mainstay of Saregama, which has a repertoire of 3 lakh tracks.

 The company, however, is building up other lines of businesses like film production. 

 We want to be cautious and not lose money by committing too much in movies, he said after Saregamas annual general meeting here today.

 The company carries out its movie production business through a wholly owned subsidiary called Saregama Films.

 Goenka did not rule out the possibility of a public offer for the company. A number of movie production houses like Subhas Ghais Mukta Arts and Pritish Nandy Communication have tapped the market.

 Saregama has produced four Hindi and three Bengali films, including two low-budget ones released last year.

 In TV software, the company is creating and marketing programmes for Sun TV in the south. Last fiscal, Saregama Films suffered losses of Rs 2.12 crore.

 Subroto Chattopadhyay, managing director of Saregama, said the company would soon complete digitising tracks. The website will be up and ready by the year-end. This will help consumers buy music without going through the conventional route. It is implementing a Rs 4-crore SAP project, which not only provide better management of track sales but also protects intellectual property rights.

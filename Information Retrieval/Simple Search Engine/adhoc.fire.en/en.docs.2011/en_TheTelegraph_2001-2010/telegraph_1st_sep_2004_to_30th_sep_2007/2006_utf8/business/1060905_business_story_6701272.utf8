 Six in fray for United Western

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Sept. 4: There is some hope for depositors of United Western Bank (UWB). Six banks ICICI Bank, Federal Bank, Andhra Bank, Allahabad Bank, Canara Bank and Standard Chartered have jumped into the fray to acquire the beleaguered bank which was placed under moratorium by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Saturday.

 A few more banks may join the race to acquire UWB, attracted by its strong branch network in Maharashtra. 

 While these banks will be submitting their expressions of interest (EoI) to the department of banking operations and development (DBOD) at RBI, a final decision by the central bank is expected shortly.

 Officials from RBI said the central bank has various yardsticks to decide who would take over such banks. Apart from whether it would be in the best interest of its depositors, it would depend on synergies post acquisition.

 Although the moratorium placed on UWB will be effective till December 1, 2006, it will be lifted if alternate arrangements are put in place earlier.

 Among the interested parties, ICICI Bank announced on Sunday that its board would meet today to take a decision on whether to submit an EoI to acquire UWB. The banks board has approved the submission of an expression of interest to RBI for the amalgamation of UWB with the bank.

 ICICI Bank said UWBs network of over 240 branches and extension counters can be leveraged to grow its rural and small and medium enterprise banking operations in particular and its overall distribution franchise in general.

 Similarly, Allahabad Bank informed the stock exchanges that it is also interested in taking over UWB. Federal Bank, which had successfully taken over Ganesh Bank, said an emergency meeting of its board would be held on September 6 to consider matters related to the expression of its interest in taking over UWB.

 Canara Bank sees a number of positive synergies existing between itself and UWB, particularly in terms of branch network, geographical contiguity and UWBs need for a strong, effective and professional management. The bank has submitted its interest to RBI.

 Though the takeover of UWB will benefit the banks depositors, market circles fear that shareholders may lose out in the long run. 

 In cases where a bank has gone into moratorium, the interests of shareholders come last. Moreover, if any bank, no matter how big, takes over and later amalgamates, the swap ratio will not be beneficial to the banks shareholders, said an analyst.

 This fear led to the UWB scrip taking a major hit on the stock exchanges. It finished at Rs 16.15, a loss of 28.38 per cent over its previous close of Rs 22.55. While the bourses had removed circuit filter limits on the counter, the UWB share had slipped to Rs 10 at intra-day levels, a loss of 56 per cent.

 Meanwhile, the Maharashtra government tried to assuage feelings of depositors when it said their interests will not be affected due to the ongoing reconstruction process in the bank and that it will provide financial support through Sicom, an undertaking of the state government. It is also learnt that Sicom will play a major role in the reconstruction of UWB. Sicom holds little more than 10 per cent in UWB.

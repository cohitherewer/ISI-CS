 McLeod rushes to repay debt

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Khaitan: Burden cut

 Calcutta, Sept. 19: McLeod Russel India Ltd will raise Rs 150 crore by the end of this fiscal from the domestic market through qualified institutional placements (QIP) to repay a part of its Rs 475-crore debt.

 The BM Khaitan Group company has chalked out plans to repay debts worth Rs 300 crore by 2007-08. The company has already repaid Rs 50 crore of outstanding debt in its books and the money was raised through private placement of shares. It plans to repay Rs 100 crore more from internal accruals.

 Following the issue of shares, the Khaitan groups stakeholding in McLeod Russel will come down to 45 per cent from 50 per cent now.

 McLeod Russel had planned to raise the money through global depository receipts. But the companys board has instead decided to tap the QIP route.

 The Khaitan group company recently acquired Williamson Tea Assam and Hindustan Lever subsidiary Doom Dooma Tea Co for Rs 250 crore.

 McLeod Russel aims to export about 25 million kg tea this year to Pakistan, Iran and Egypt the new markets that opened up this year to Indian exporters. Last year, the company exported 22 million kg.

 We hope to produce 69 million kg tea this year compared with 70 million kg last year. We expect to make up for this shortfall with better price realisation and cost-savings through merger of Williamson Tea with McLeod, managing director Aditya Khaitan said during the annual general meeting of the company here today.

 Global tea production this year is expected to be low because of draught-like situations in many countries. Average price in the global market is already up by Rs 9 a kg and it is expected to go up further, Khaitan said.

 Khaitan also said the company was open to acquiring gardens in Assam if opportunities arose. We are looking at Assam for all our future acquisitions, Khaitan said.

 The company has shelved its plan to sell six estates at Dooars. They will remain with the company, Khaitan said.

 While the amalgamation of Williamson Tea with McLeod Russel has already been completed, the same process for Doom Dooma Tea has started and is likely to be completed by this year itself.

 Talwar: Big plans

 New Delhi, Dec. 10: After selling a stake to Swiss Re, Yes Bank plans to make another private placement of equity to overseas investors and a bond issue to raise in aggregate another $100 million. 

 Managing director of Yes Bank Rana Kapoor told The Telegraph, We are in dialogue with a few high quality investors for a private placement. He, however, did not elaborate on the identity of the potential investor(s). Sources said the investors were well known US and European financial corporations who are high pedigreed, similar to Swiss Re in terms of reputation. 

 Yes Bank has recently sold 3.6 per cent of its equity for Rs 120 crore to Swiss Re and issued tier II bonds to raise Rs 180 crore. By March 2007 we will have some Rs 1,500 crore as capital, the banks chief said. 

 Similarly, we will reduce promoter ownership and increase the ownership base ... which is what a well-run bank should aim for, he said. 

 Talwar and Ashok Kapoor together own 38.62 per cent of the equity in Yes Bank. Citicorp Venture Capital, Chryscapital and AIF Capital own another 18.52 per cent, while Rabo Bank owns 20 per cent stake in the bank, which was received the licence from the RBI two years ago. 

 Kapoor, who had worked with ANZ Grindlays and Rabo Bank before setting up Yes Bank, plans to use the money he will be raising in funding organic growth for his bank. 

 From 24 branches, he plans to increase Yes Banks footprint to some 60 branches and 75 offsite ATMs. We will, however, retain our focus on North India, he said. 

 We intend to focus on mines, metals and minerals, agri-infrastructure, textiles, retailing, water resources and education as our key business areas, Kapoor said. 

 He said North India was a suitable region to operate as not only the banks target industries were there but also many high net-worth individuals the banks target clients were in the region.

 The Bank reported a loan base of Rs 3,730 crore and investments of Rs 1,783 crore as on September 30. It had deposits of about Rs 4,329 crore and no non performing assets (NPA). 

 The bank reported a net profit after tax of Rs 21.49 crore in the second quarter of this year on a total income of Rs 79.14 crore during the three-month period, a bank executive added.

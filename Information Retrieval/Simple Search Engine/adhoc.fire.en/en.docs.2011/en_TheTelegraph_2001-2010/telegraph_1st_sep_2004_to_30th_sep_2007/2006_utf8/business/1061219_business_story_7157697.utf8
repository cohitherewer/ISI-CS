The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Oil regulator set to turn heat on Niko

 S.P.S. PANNU

 New Delhi, Dec. 18: The directorate-general of hydrocarbons (DGH) plans to take Canadian oil company Niko Resources to task for jumping the gun and declaring that huge oil reserves are present in the eastern offshore D-6 block in the Krishna-Godavari basin. This basin is known for the major oil discovery made by Reliance Industries.

 Director-general of hydrocarbons V.K. Sibal told The Telegraph that the announcement amounts to misleading people as it is too early to quantify the reserves on the basis of the appraisal well that the company is citing.

 Sibal said, We will issue Niko Resources a letter asking it to explain its conduct. Reliance is the operator of the block with a 90 per cent share, while Niko Resources owns only 10 per cent and yet it is making these announcements on the quantum of reserves.

 Sibal finds it strange that while the operator of the field is quiet, the minority partner is going ahead with the announcements.

 Market regulator Sebi has also asked the DGH to keep a close watch on the announcement of oil and gas discoveries by companies as it has serious implications for the stock market. The DGH is the regulator for the upstream oil and gas sector and the ultimate authority to verify the claims on oil and gas finds.

 The Niko statement comes close on the heels of similar statements made by Cairn Energy on its Rajasthan oilfields in the run-up to its initial public offering (IPO). 

 The Niko statement said, The MA-2 well has encountered the thickest hydrocarbon column discovered to date in D6. 

 The MA-2 reached a target depth of 3,581 metres and penetrated a gross hydrocarbon column of 194 metres consisting of 170 metres of gas and 24 metres of oil in the cretaceous section, the statement adds. 

 The MA-2 is located approximately 2 km from the previous MA-1 exploratory well which had struck oil in the block hitherto known for its huge gas reserves.

 Niko has also said, An application has been made for the commerciality of the MA field and approval is expected to be granted in the near future.

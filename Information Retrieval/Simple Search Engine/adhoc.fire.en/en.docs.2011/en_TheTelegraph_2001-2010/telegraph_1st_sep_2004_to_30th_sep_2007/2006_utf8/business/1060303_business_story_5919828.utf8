 Anil shifts twin firms to Goa

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, March 2: Anil Ambani is moving the registered offices of Reliance Communications Ventures (RCoVL) and Reliance Natural Resources Ltd (RNRL) ? two of the four companies spun off from Reliance Industries Ltd in January ? to Goa.

 Shareholders of the two companies are being asked to approve the relocation through a postal ballot.

 RCoVL has been vested with the telecommunications businesses while RNRL will oversee the gas-based energy operations.

 In a notice issued to shareholders of the companies under Section 192A of the Companies Act, both RNRL and RcoVL sought their approval for shifting the registered office.

 The move may have been prompted by the desire to win a few tax breaks. RCoVL in its explanatory notice only said the shift has been done as a measure of rationalisation.

 RCoVL has its registered office at Dhirubhai Ambani Knowledge City in Navi Mumbai.

 Apart from the proposal to move their registered offices, both the group companies also indicated their plans to raise resources through issue of securities in the international markets. 

 RCoVL said this is being mooted to enhance its global competitiveness and increase the ability to compete with peer group in domestic and international markets. To achieve the significant competitive advantage through easy access to large amounts of international capital, with extended maturities, at optimal costs, the company may need to issue securities in the international markets, it said. Both the companies pointed out this may be done either through an ADR or GDR issue or other instruments. They clarified that the issue of securities shall not result in increase of the equity capital by more than 25 per cent.

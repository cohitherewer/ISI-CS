 Govt gets cracking on limited liability bill

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY AND JAYATI GHOSE

 New Delhi, Sept. 10: The department of company affairs will place a draft bill to allow setting up of limited liability partnership firms before the cabinet this month.

 Department sources said the draft bill has been sent to cabinet ministers concerned on Friday and would be taken up soon. After the bill is enacted, it will allow small firms to limit their liabilities without risking the vagaries of the stock market.

 Officials said the bill describes a limited liability partnership as one where the liability of a partner will be restricted to ones contribution to the partnership, and ones personal assets would not be attached to square up the partnerships liability.

 Senior government officials believe that this new class of business will address the needs of small firms, which want to avail of the benefits of corporatisation without actually becoming a limited company.

 The benefits of a limited liability partnership would be available to all services and small-scale firms as well as professionals like chartered accountants, architects and lawyers.

 Sources said after the draft was accepted by the cabinet and formalised by the law ministry, the final version would be brought before the cabinet in the winter session of Parliament. 

 Earlier, the Naresh Chandra Committee on corporate governance had suggested a limited liability partnership, but only for accountancy and law firms on the lines of a British act which allows accountancy firms this status.

 But the government, after studying the vanishing companies and the penny stock scandals, feels this new class should be extended to all small businesses and knowledge-based entities. However, the rules will initially be framed for professional and services sector firms.

 At present, all Indian businesses are set up either under the Indian Partnership Act 1932 or the Companies Act 1956. The new law will create an intermediary class of business entities which will enjoy benefits of both worlds.

 The new law will be policed by central government agencies. The standards of financial disclosures will, however, be the same as, or similar to, that prescribed for private companies.

 Limited liability partnerships will be governed by tax laws applicable to partnership firms and not those meant for limited companies.

 SEZs send govt into overdrive

 New Delhi, March 17 (PTI): In a bid to make India a global manufacturing hub, the government today cleared nearly 150 special economic zones, including those of Mukesh Ambanis Reliance group, Biocon, Bajaj Auto, Bharat Forge, DLF, Adani Group and Satyam Computers.

 As part of the fast-track single-window clearance, the government will issue notifications within a week for about 75 SEZs, which have been cleared. The remaining SEZs, which have been given an in-principle nod, would have to complete certain formalities such as land acquisition.

 The major SEZs okayed by the board include Reliance Infrastructure Ltds Rs 20000-crore Jamnagar petrochemicals project, Adani Groups two projects totalling Rs 12,000 crore in Gujarat, Biocons Rs 200-crore biotech project in Bangalore and Bajaj Autos Aurangabad auto-component project.

 While the infotech SEZs would have to be completed within three years, the other sectoral and multi-product SEZs must be completed in five years to get tax benefits, official sources said, adding these zones are together expected to generate more than 5 lakh jobs in the next 3-5 years.

 The board considered 166 applications, but deferred a decision on 18 major proposals, which include Wipros plan in poll-bound Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Kerala. Other SEZs given the final approval include Gujarat Industrial Development Corps Rs 4000-crore multi-product project, Divi Labss Rs 250-crore pharma zone in Vizag and Maharashtra Industrial Development Corps (MIDC) IT SEZ near Pune.

 Several other MIDC proposals were also approved, which include a textile SEZ in Kolhapur on 104 hectares, a pharma project on a 150-hectare plot in Nanded district, a 40-hectare biotech zone in Jalna and a 200-hectare agro-processing complex in Latur.

 The MIDC had proposed two SEZs for power generation to be supplied to units in other special economic zones. While the Chandrapur proposal was of 1000 mw, the Raigad project was of about 150 mw. But both were deferred as the board sought clarifications from the power ministry on this.

 The infotech SEZs of Quark in Mohali, Vikas Telecom near Bangalore, Vipul in Berhampur, MIDC near Pune and Satyam Computer in Andhra Pradesh, a gems SEZ in Hyderabad and Jubilant Organosyss biotech SEZ in Mysore also got the final approval. 

 Some major projects, which were deferred, include Essar groups two proposals in Gujarat and ONGCs Mangalore Petrochemicals projects.

 Todays board meeting, chaired by special secretary in the commerce ministry, G.K. Pillai, was being held for the first time since the notification of the SEZ act last month.

 Calcutta, Sept. 11: Alliance Air could be state-run carrier Indians answer to the competition from private low-cost airlines like Air Deccan and SpiceJet.

 The Centre is considering the option to make Alliance Air, which mainly flies to smaller towns within the country, a no-frill airline catering to the burgeoning demand of this segment. Alliance Air is a wholly owned subsidiary of Indian, which is proposed to be merged with Air-India, the state-owned international carrier.

 The government is planning to retain the identity of Alliance Air even after the merger and position it as a small-size aircraft operator.

 It will only fly ATRs and work on the hub-and-spoke model to connect smaller towns, Union civil aviation secretary Ajay Prasad said.

 The government has decided to bring down the cost of operations over a period of time to the level of low-cost carriers, he added.

 Alliance Air has four ATRs and nine Boeing 737 200s. The government is planning to add more ATRs and stop Boeing operations. An ATR is a preferred aircraft for many low-cost airlines. Deccan Aviation, that pioneered the trend of no-frill airlines in India, has a huge ATR fleet. 

 Alliance Air is now a full service airline operating close to 350 flights a week to over 40 domestic destinations.

 Prasad said the government wanted to keep it separate from the merged entity of Air-India and Indian but the final decision would be taken after consultants file report on the merger in November.

 Air-India has already started a low-cost carrier Air India Express. In the first six months, domestic air traffic grew by 50 per cent. A large section of the traffic comprises first-time fliers, lured by cheap tickets offered by low-cost carriers. The government is planning new terminals for such low-cost carriers in existing airports in select cities to facilitate their growth. Airlines would have to pay lower charges there, making their operations more viable.

 Speaking at an interactive session of the Bengal National Chamber of Commerce and Industry, he said the government would set up a regulator to fix airport tariffs soon.

 The draft bill for the formation of the Airport Economic Regulatory Authority has been prepared and would be placed before Parliament in the winter session.

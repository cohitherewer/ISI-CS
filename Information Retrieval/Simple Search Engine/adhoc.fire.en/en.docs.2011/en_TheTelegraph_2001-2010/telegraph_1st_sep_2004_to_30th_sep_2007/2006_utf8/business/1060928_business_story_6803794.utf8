 Hyundai to set up research centre

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 27: Hyundai Motor India is planning to set up a research and development centre either in Hyderabad or in Chennai. The company has earmarked an investment of $40 million (approximately Rs 180 crore) for it.

 With increased indigenisation (using parts made in India) of cars, setting up an R amp;D centre in the country became necessary, said Rajiv Mitra, deputy general manager (corporate communications), Hyundai Motor India Ltd.

 Hyundai Motor today rolled out the Verna, its premium sedan car, in the city in petrol and diesel versions. These are priced between Rs 6,21,498 and Rs 7,35,499 (ex-showroom Calcutta). Even the Verna is 54 per cent indigenised and the remaining 46 per cent are imported primarily from Hyundai facilities in Korea. Next year, we are planning to increase the indigenisation level in the Verna to 71 per cent, said Wang Sik Min, executive director (marketing and sales), Hyundai Motor India. 

 Hyundai Motor now gets its research materials and designs from the parent companys facilities in Korea, Germany and other parts of the world.

 We are planning to set up a design centre here. We will employ about 1,000 professionals initially, Mitra said. The centre will carry out the computer-aided designing works for Hyundai cars, he added.

 However, the company has not yet decided on a final location for the R amp;D centre. It could be either in Hyderabad or in Chennai, Mitra said.

With its country headquarters in New Delhi, Hyundai 

Motor has its manufacturing facility in Chennai. It produces about 300,000 cars 

a year. We are setting up a second plant close to our first unit at an investment 

of $528 million (Rs 2,375 crore approximately). With this, Hyundai Motors 

total investment in the country would be $911 million (excluding the R amp;D centre), 

Mitra said.

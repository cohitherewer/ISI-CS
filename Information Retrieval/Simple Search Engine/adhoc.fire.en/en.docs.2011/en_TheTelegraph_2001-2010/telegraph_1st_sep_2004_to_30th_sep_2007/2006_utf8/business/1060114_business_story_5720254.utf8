 Ketan affiliate still an outcast

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Jan. 13: Sebi today slammed the market door on Jermyn LLC, a foreign corporate sub-account of Taib Bank, after it found links with Jermyn Capital Partners (Jermyn Plc), Dharmesh Doshi and Ketan Parekh.

 Jermyn Plc, earlier known as Triumph Securities UK Plc, was a subsidiary of Triumph International Finance India (TIFIL), an entity with ties to Ketan Parekh.

 Restrictions were clamped on Jermyn LLC in November, when its ties with Doshi and Parekh came to the fore. Todays order, in effect, only prolongs the curbs.

 Sebi believes Doshi, a co-accused in the Ketan Parekh scam, played a key role in the affairs of Jermyn Plc as its executive director. It believes Jermyn Capital LLC, Jermyn Plc and Dharmesh Doshi/Ketan Parekh have ties. The common threads cuts across their names, two directors (including chairman) and two shareholders who owned almost 49 per cent of Jermyn Capital LLC. Sebi was of the view that Jermyn LLC is an associate of Jermyn Plc. This indicates interlacing and interlocking of operations and control, it said. Jermyn LLC substantially dealt in the shares of HFCL, among the 10 stocks Parekh had a liking for.

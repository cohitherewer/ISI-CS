 Ruias plan steel business recast

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Sept. 22: The Ruias of Essar are restructuring their steel business. Since the last couple of months, the promoter holding in Essar Steel has undergone a change with inter-se transfers leading to the shareholding being concentrated among fewer entities.

 For the period ended June 30, the promoters held close to 74.64 per cent of the companys equity. This was distributed among 16 entities, among which Essar Power held the largest stake of 43.93 per cent. 

 However, this shareholding structure has changed in the past few months. 

 Recently, Essar Steel has informed the bourses that Essar Steel Holdings Ltd, along with persons acting in concert (PACs), acquired 13.98 crore shares or 12.27 per cent of the companys equity.

 This saw Essar Steel Holdings stake rising to 50.07 per cent in the company. Some of the PACs included Essar Global Ltd, Essar Infrastructure Holdings Ltd, Asia Pacific Markets Ltd, Essar Logistics Holding Ltd and Asia Pacific Corporation Ltd. Sources said all these entities were holding companies of the group.

 Essar Global is the prime investment arm of the Ruias, which has interests in infrastructure, telecommunications and industrial construction.

 Moreover, Asia Steel Holdings, the financial investor that holds 12.27 per cent of the company, has been merged with Essar Steel Holdings, the subsidiary of Essar Global. The impact of this merger on the shareholding structure could not be ascertained.

 Such a consolidation comes at a time when there are reports that the group is planning to delist Essar Steel, Essar Oil and Essar Shipping from the stock exchanges and create an internationally listed holding company Essar Global.

 However, a company spokesperson said the group does not plan to delist these companies.

 The consolidation has been in evidence since May this year when Essar Metal Holdings sold 36,911,153 shares aggregating to 6.36 per cent of the company to Asia Pacific Markets.

 A similar trend is also seen in Essar Oil. Essar Investments Ltd acquired 5.30 crore shares aggregating to 4.89 per cent of the companys equity in March this year through inter-se transfer between promoters. As a result, the holding of Essar Investments rose to 7.25 per cent in Essar Oil.

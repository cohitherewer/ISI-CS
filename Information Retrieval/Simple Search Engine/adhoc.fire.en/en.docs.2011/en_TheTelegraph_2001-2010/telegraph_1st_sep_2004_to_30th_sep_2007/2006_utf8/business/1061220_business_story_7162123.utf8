 LSE vows to hike dividend 

 London, Dec. 19 (Reuters): The London Stock Exchange issued a bullish profit forecast and pledged a dividend hike on Tuesday as it urged shareholders to reject a 2.7-billion bid from US rival Nasdaq. 

 The exchange said Nasdaqs second offer this year substantially undervalued it in relation to its peers, adding that its stellar growth would continue to be boosted by a rise in electronic trading and a slew of companies many foreign listing on its markets.

 The LSE said its strong performance justified its rejection of the 1,243 pence-a-share offer from Nasdaq, which already owns 28.75 per cent of the London exchange. 

 For the second time this year, Nasdaq is offering a wholly inadequate price for the company and shareholders should reject the offer, Chris Gibson-Smith, the LSE chairman, said in the exchanges initial bid defence document. 

 The worlds stock markets are under pressure from customers who want lower fees and broader offerings. 

 Europes biggest stock exchange said its adjusted basic earnings per share (EPS) for the three months to December 31 would be not less than 14.5 pence, an increase of at least 48 per cent on the same period last year. 

 This would take EPS for the first nine months of its fiscal year to at least 38.6 pence, up 51 per cent, and EPS for the 2006 calendar year to at least 50.4 pence, or up 58 per cent.

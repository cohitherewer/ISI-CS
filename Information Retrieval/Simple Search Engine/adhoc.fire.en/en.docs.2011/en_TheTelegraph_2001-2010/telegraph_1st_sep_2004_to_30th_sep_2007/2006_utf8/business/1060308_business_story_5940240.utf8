 Mukesh pitted against Mukesh

 VIVEK NAIR

 New opponent 

 Mumbai, March 7: You have had your fill of Anil Ambani versus Mukesh Ambani sparring bouts. How about a new fight card that reads: Mukesh Ambani versus Mukesh Ambani?

 The match-up is a stark prospect thrown up by the red herring prospectus of Reliance Petroleum Ltd (RPL) for its forthcoming initial public offering.

 RPL has expressed the fear that it might have to square off against parent Reliance Industries ? which is engaged in the same line of business ? if there is a conflict of interest.

 Listing the risk factors in its prospectus, RPL said it would rely on RIL ? which will have an 80 per cent stake in the firm after the public issue ? for a range of services that include crude procurement, marketing, hedging and risk management services apart from operational support and transportation services.

 Although RIL has agreed to provide us with these services, there could be instances of conflict of interest and RIL has not assured us that, in the case of a conflict of interest, it will not prioritise its own business interests our own interests, RPL warned.

 RPL is setting up a 27-million-tonne export-oriented refinery that also comprises a polypropylene (PP) plant at Jamnagar in Gujarat, adjacent to RILs own refinery. Since RIL also operates a refinery and petrochemicals complex larger than the companys proposed refinery, RPL did not rule out the possibility of competition from its parent. 

 In the event we have a conflict of interest with RIL, the resolution of such a conflict may not be on the most favourable terms to us, it added. 

 According to RPL, conflict of interest may rise in various areas which include the purchase, allocation and transportation of crude, marketing and sales of refined products and PP, deputation of managers and employees as required by RPL among others.

 RPLs project cost is estimated at Rs 27,000 crore. This is proposed to be funded through a debt of Rs 15,750 crore and an equity of Rs 11,250 crore, including proceeds from the IPO. 

 While any additional equity raised in excess of Rs 11,250 crore will be used as additional contingency for the project, the company has also agreed to a preliminary term sheet with certain banks and financial institutions for a syndicated term loan of around Rs 6,750 crore.

 The company will issue close to 180 crore shares, of which the promoters contribution will be 90 crore shares. The remaining 90 crore will be offered to the public.

 The promoters contribution constitutes 20 per cent of the post-issue equity capital of RPL. While these equity shares will be locked in for a period of three years, commencing from the date of allotment of the public issue, RIL will bring in the full amount of the contribution at the upper end of the price band one day prior to the issue opening date.

 Sources from the company added that if the cut-off price is lower than the upper end of the band, the difference will be paid back to RIL. RILs investment will be at the same price as the other investors, they added.

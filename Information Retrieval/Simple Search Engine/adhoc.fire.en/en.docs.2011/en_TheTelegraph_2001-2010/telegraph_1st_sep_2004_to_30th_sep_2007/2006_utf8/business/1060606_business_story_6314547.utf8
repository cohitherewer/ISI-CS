 Praj keen 

to buy facilities in US

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 5: Praj Industries, a Pune-based provider of alcohol and ethanol technology, plans to acquire manufacturing facilities in the US to cater to the growing ethanol demand there.

 Earlier this year, the company had inked a strategic alliance with Aker Kvaerner Netherlands on bio-ethanol projects in Europe. According to the agreement, Praj and Aker will jointly pursue business opportunities in Europe. While Praj will provide Aker with the licence, engineering and critical equipment to set up process plants, Aker will look after the basic engineering, construction and procurement.

 The company has recently roped in US-based venture capitalist Vinod Khosla and private equity investor Marubeni Corporation of Japan by allotting them 24.34 lakh equity shares and 73 lakh convertible warrants for Rs 117.10 crore.

 This capital will be invested in setting up a research and development centre and acquiring facilities in the US, a company spokesperson said. Last month, the board approved the acquisition proposal and increased the authorised share capital of the company to Rs 27 crore from Rs 18 crore. 

 The objective is to capitalise on the growing demand for ethanol worldwide as well as in the domestic market, he added.

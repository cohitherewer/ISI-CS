 Essar Shipping shares to be delisted

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Dec. 1: The Ruias of Essar Group are planning to delist the shares of Essar Shipping from the Bombay Stock Exchange to gain greater flexibility in operations and management of the company. 

 Essar Shipping will convene a meeting of its board on December 2 to consider the delisting proposal from its largest promoter, Essar Shipping and Logistics (ESLL), a Cyprus-based subsidiary of Essar Global. 

 Essar Global is the Ruias prime investment arm having interests in infrastructure, telecommunications and industrial construction.

 Essar Shipping and Logistics has requested the board of Essar Shipping to obtain consent of the shareholders for the proposed delisting of the shares in accordance with the Sebi (Delisting of Securities) Guidelines, 2003, a statement said.

 Essar Shipping and Logistics and promoters currently hold about 76 per cent stake in Essar Shipping.

 According to Essar Shipping and Logistics, the delisting will offer more flexibility in the operations and management of the company, greater efficiencies and at the same time provide an exit opportunity for the shareholders.

 The company will follow a voluntary delisting method. After getting the consent of the shareholders, a public announcement will be made in accordance with the Sebi guidelines to ascertain the exit price.

 This would be followed by an open offer for outstanding shares not held by promoters, which is estimated at about 24 per cent of the total equity capital.

 In August this year, the Essar group announced the formation of Essar Shipping and Logistics, which will hold stakes in Essar Shipping, Essar Logistics and Vadinar Oil Terminal. 

 As Essar Globals investments include Essar Steel and Essar Oil, there is speculation that these two companies may also be delisted at a later stage. 

 Though senior officials of the group denied this, reports say the Ruias are looking to delist all entities from the domestic bourses and go for an overseas listing of Essar Global.

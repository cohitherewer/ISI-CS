 Oil prices rally on Opec, North Korea moves

 Comes at a cost

 Singapore, Oct. 9 (Reuters): Oil climbed above $60 a barrel on Monday as Opec plans to cement a deal to cut production and as geopolitical tensions increased after North Korea said it had conducted its first nuclear test.

 US crude rose 74 cents to $60.50 a barrel by 0410 GMT after losing 27 cents on Friday. London Brent crude gained 67 cents to $60.50. 

 Prices were given an extra lift to the days highs after Pyongyang said on Monday it had carried out a nuclear test, boosting the dollar and prompting South Korea to step up its armys state of alert. However, North Korea is not an oil producer or major consumer and oil traders are focusing more on Opec.

 This is the sort of thing that causes tension in the world, and tension is associated with bumps upward in oil prices, said John Vautrain, vice-president of energy consultancy Purvin and Gertz in Singapore.

 (But) it doesnt carry the same sorts of implications as if Iran tested a bomb. Any sort of sanction would be immaterial to the flow of oil North Korea has no oil weapon, he added.

 Prices had already risen above $60 after Opec president Edmund Daukoru told Reuters on Sunday there was consensus for a supply cut. Opec is expected to formalise on Monday a cut to its official output ceiling of 28 million barrels per day (bpd) by 1 million bpd, tempering market scepticism over Opecs resolve.

 The 1 million number is possibly a good bullish number for the market Opec has reacted sooner than people thought to sub-$60 prices, said Andrew Harrington, an analyst at ANZ Bank.

 The plan by Opec, which pumps more than a third of the worlds oil, expands on marginal supply cuts announced last month by Nigeria and Venezuela.

 Oil prices have halted a slide from a record-high of $78.40 in July, but fundamentals are weighed down by the US distillate stocks at their highest level since 1999, during a period of seasonally weak demand ahead of the northern hemisphere winter.

 Cutting physical barrels in October and November means that deliveries to refiners will be curbed in November-December. Ironically, that is when US and European refiners will be returning from maintenance and potentially looking to run hard ahead of the winter, said JP Morgan.

 Opec is due for a scheduled meeting on December 14, but some members want to hold an emergency session this month to hammer out the details of a cut from its official ceiling, a move that could lead to negotiations over a realignment of Opec quotas.

 Gold prices

 Gold prices jumped 1.5 per cent on Monday as safe-haven buying intensified after North Korea said it had conducted its first nuclear test. 

 Higher oil prices also prompted investors to build positions and analysts said the metal might advance in the near term.

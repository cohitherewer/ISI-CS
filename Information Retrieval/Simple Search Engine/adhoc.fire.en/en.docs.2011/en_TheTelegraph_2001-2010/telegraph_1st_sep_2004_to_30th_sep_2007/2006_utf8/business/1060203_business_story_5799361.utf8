 Wheat import to check price rise

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Feb. 2: The government today decided to import 5 lakh tonnes of wheat to soften foodgrain prices.

 State Trading Corporation (STC) will import half-a-million tonnes of wheat duty-free, agriculture minister Sharad Pawar told reporters. The minister said as the government is committed to ensure food security, it decided to import wheat as prices are ruling at Rs 1,100-1,200 per quintal. 

 The wheat will be sold in the southern states, so that northern supplies can be used to meet demand in hinterland states. 

 The minister said STC will decide on the countries from where wheat will be imported. STC will execute the order within a day or two and supplies will arrive at Chennai, Kakinada, Visakhapatnam and Tuticorin in the next two months, he said.

 We expect the wheat import consignment to take about 60 days to reach these ports, he said. 

 Allaying fears that the decision was taken as the government apprehends depleting wheat stocks, Pawar said prices have come down by increasing the supply in the market.

 The minister claimed that prices of wheat have come down in all states except Kerala and Karnataka, following releases from FCI stocks.

 Q amp;A

 Making money

 I am a housewife. I bought some shares with my husbands money. I have earned a profit of Rs 25,000 from those shares in 2005-06. I have no other income. Im holding a PAN. Do I need to pay short-term capital gains tax and file I-T returns?

 T. Bhattacharya, Asansol

Since you have purchased those shares with your husbands money, the 

tax will have to be paid by your husband. You are a housewife and have no income. 

The short-term sales of shares and capital gains thereon will be taxed at your 

husbands hand.

 Fixed deposits

 Is the capital amount up to Rs 1 lakh for fixed deposit in a nationalised bank for five years or more, made in fiscal 2006-07, eligible for tax deduction or is there any rider attached to it?

 Hiten Barua, Behala

 As of now, tax deduction under section 80C (up to a maximum of Rs 1 lakh) is allowed on regular bank fixed deposits for five years or more; no special conditions are attached. However, the bank should be a scheduled commercial bank. All nationalised banks are scheduled banks.

 Nil tax

 I have been filing income tax returns for the assessment years 2003-04, 2004-05 and 2005-06. In all these years, my tax liability was nil. Do I need to file the returns for 2006-07?

 Mohendra Bhattacharya, Howrah

 If your total income in financial year 2005-06 is below the threshold limit for income tax, you dont have to file returns. You need not file returns if your annual income is less than or equal to Rs 1 lakh if you are below 65 years of age or Rs 1,85,000 if you are above that age. 

 Trading bounty

 Im a salaried individual. Last year, I made a profit of Rs 8 lakh from trading in the futures amp; options market. My salary income is Rs 2 lakh per annum. Under which head will I show my income from derivatives trading? 

 Paresh Manna, Midnapore

Income from derivatives trading has to be shown under the business income 

head. From fiscal 2005-06, trading in derivatives is not treated as a speculative 

business if some conditions are satisfied. The income will be taxed as business 

income or capital gains depending on whether the derivatives are held in stock 

in trade or capital assets.

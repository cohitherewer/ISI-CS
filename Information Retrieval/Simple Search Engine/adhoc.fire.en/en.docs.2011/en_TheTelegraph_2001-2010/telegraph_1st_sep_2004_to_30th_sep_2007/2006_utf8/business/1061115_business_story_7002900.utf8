 Paswan for check on steel from China

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 14: To allay misgivings over cheap imports, steel minister Ram Vilas Paswan today said it was necessary to have a policy to regulate Chinese steel firms in India.

 The government should frame proper policies on the entry of Chinese companies in India, who are looking for opportunities to get a share of the growing domestic steel industry, Paswan said. 

 Since the Chinese companies manufacture and sell steel cheaply, the domestic industry fears heavy loss of market share to the Chinese.

 The minister also suggested that Steel Authority of India (SAIL) should expand overseas like the Tatas.

 SAIL should look abroad for acquisitions in a manner similar to the Tata Groups plans for Corus, said Paswan. 

 He said SAIL should scout for opportunities abroad in coking coal which is in short supply in the country.

 The minister was concerned over the low average consumption of steel in the country, arguing that the average consumption in China at 250 kg was much higher than in India. 

 Paswan said investment Rs 3,50,000 crore was required to meet the target of 100 million tonnes (mt) of steel by 2020. 

 Ore export

 India will soon formulate a policy on export of iron-ore, but ruled out imposing a blanket ban as demanded by the domestic steel industry. The government is very much concerned about the issue, but it is not possible to put a blanket ban, minister of state for steel Akhilesh Das said in Jamshedpur today.

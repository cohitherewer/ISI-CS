 Britannia taste for West Asian firms

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Dec. 13: Britannia Industries, co-owned by the Wadia group and Group Danone of France, is set to make its first overseas acquisition. The Rs 1,818-crore company is buying a majority stake in two bakery product companies in West Asia.

 Britannia, however, has not revealed the identity of these companies or the consideration paid, stating that the acquisition of shares is subject to signing of definitive agreements. 

 Sources however, added that the deal will be financed through a combination of internal accruals and debt. They said that Britannia Industries has more than Rs 300 crore of cash reserves.

 The acquisition comes at a time when reports say that both the Wadias and Group Danone are engaged in a row.

 Sources, however, said Britannias proposed acquisition of the two bakery product companies had nothing to do with the recent developments. 

 It is a strategic move, they said while adding that Britannia would continue to look at various international opportunities.

 This strategy is part of what the Wadia group chairman Nusli Wadia has outlined for the company. Britannia is very keen on venturing into high growth areas and overseas acquisitions will be one component of this course. There may be one or two small acquisitions and even couple of large acquisitions, they said.

 Consistent with such a strategy, Britannia had acquired a strategic stake in Daily Bread, a Bangalore-based boutique manufacturer and retailer of high-end bakery products.

 Britannia is a major player in the domestic foods market with brands like Tiger, Marie Gold, Good Day, 50:50 and Treat.

 Recently, Danone was planning to buy a minority stake in biotech firm Avestha Gengraine Technologies Pvt Ltd (Avesthagen). However, the Wadia group blocked the deal, saying that in doing so, Danone was going against an agreement that said any investment in India would be done through their joint venture. It petitioned Mumbai High Court on this issue. The court later suspended the transfer of shares from Avesthagen to Danone.

 Danone and the Wadias also had differences over the trademark rights of Britannias Tiger brand. Britannia had claimed that Danone has surreptitiously registered the Tiger brand in 74 countries. 

 Later, both the parties are understood to have reached a settlement with Groupe Danone agreeing to return the brand to Britannia.

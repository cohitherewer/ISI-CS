 Toshiba move

 Tokyo, Oct. 10 (AP): Toshiba will invest $46 million to take about a 20 per cent stake in the Polish subsidiary of LG.Philips LCD, forging a partnership with a South Korean rival to strengthen its European TV business, the Japanese manufacturer said today. 

 Toshibas announcement follows the establishment last month of a liquid-crystal display TV production and sales company in Kobierzyce, near Wroclaw in southwestern Poland, where production is set to start in august 2007. 

 Demand for LCD televisions is growing rapidly worldwide, including in Europe.

 New Delhi, Feb. 14: India is unlikely to allow the tiff between the European nations and NRI businessman L.N. Mittal over steel giant Arcelor to affect its relations with these governments.

 Minister of state for external affairs Anand Sharma today said, Indias policy is not linked to any one incident. Any policy of the country has to be comprehensive.

 Sharma said this was purely a business issue and those who believe in free trade and investment should respect that. However, Mittal is likely to be in India during the visit of French President Jacques Chiraq here next week to persuade India to take up the issue with him.

 Meanwhile, the visiting European Commission director-general for trade, David Sullivan, said, The EU is clear that nationality in such cases is not relevant and it should be decided according to the laws in place and commercial merits.

 It is unfortunate that allegations of racial discrimination have crept in the issue, he added. However, he made it clear the EU would be concerned if there were any violations of competition rules and the takeover created a monopoly kind of situation.

 A report from Brussels echoed a similar sentiment from Peter Power, the spokesperson of EU trade commissioner Peter Mandelson. He said Mittals bid will be blocked only if there are considerable commercial aspects that would violate WTO regulations.

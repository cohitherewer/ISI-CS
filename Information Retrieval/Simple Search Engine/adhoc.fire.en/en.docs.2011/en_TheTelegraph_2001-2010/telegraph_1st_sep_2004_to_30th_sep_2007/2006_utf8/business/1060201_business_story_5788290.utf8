 Universal Cables to expand 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 31: Universal Cables Limited (UCL), an MP Birla Group company and a leading player in power cables, is set to implement a major expansion-cum-technology up-gradation project.

 The project, estimated at Rs 60 crore, will use the vertical continuous vulcanisation technology ? the only company in India to use such advanced technology, UCL chairman R.S. Lodha said. The project would be implemented by 2006-07 and would enable the company to produce the complete range of XLPE cables up to 400 kv and process the entire range of conductors required for power transmission and distribution..

 At present, the XLPE cables for 220 kv and 400 kv are imported. This upgradation comes in the wake of the expansion of cement capacities and installation of captive power plants by Birla Corporation.

 Clicks on eBay deal 

 San Francisco, Aug. 28 (Reuters): Google Inc will supply eBay Inc with Web search advertising outside the United States, and the two will join forces on click-to-call ads that link online shoppers to customer service operators, the companies said on Monday. 

 eBay said it had agreed to rely exclusively on Google for international online text advertising instead of existing partner Yahoo Inc, which in May struck a parallel deal to handle all of eBays US ads. 

 The eBay contract is part of a string of deals this month for Google. It previously said it planned to begin testing an ad-supported Web video syndication system with Viacoms MTV Networks. It also struck a deal to supply ads to MySpace users and other Web properties of News Corp. 

 This (latest deal with eBay) in fact is the most important of these areas, Google chief executive Eric Schmidt said in a phone interview. 

 You can now see Googles strategy in each of these new markets, Schmidt said of MTV Web video, the MySpace community and eBay e-commerce partnerships. These are very large businesses for us. I dont know what rate they will grow at. 

 Separately, on Sunday, Google said it was moving beyond search and advertising into the business software market, starting with a set of Web programs for e-mail, scheduling and communications. It plans to add additional programs later. 

 Financial terms for components of the deal involve revenue sharing, but the companies did not disclose specific details. eBay said it did not expect the Google agreement to have a material impact on its financial results in 2006 or 2007. 

 eBay increasingly depends on paid search advertising to drive bidders to its auctions and sales. Its new pacts seek to make it easier for buyers to search for items for sale on eBay, while being careful not to offend sellers with competing ads. Through its deal with Yahoo, chief executive Meg Whitman said eBay had already begun testing ads that appear when US customers fail to locate what they want on an eBay auction search. The Google pact expands this to international sites. If and when eBay sellers become more comfortable seeing ads alongside their listings, eBay plans to expand the number of pages where Yahoo or Google ads may appear, she said. 

 Click-to-call 

 The companies said they will jointly offer click-to-call advertising using the respective instant message and Web phone-calling services of the two companies, eBays globally popular Skype and Googles nascent Google Talk service.

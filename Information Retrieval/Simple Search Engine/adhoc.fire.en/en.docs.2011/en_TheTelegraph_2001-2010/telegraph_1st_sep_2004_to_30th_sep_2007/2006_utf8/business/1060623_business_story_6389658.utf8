 BA wakes up to raid alert

 Bumpy ride

 London, June 22 (Reuters): UK authorities have raided British Airways Plc (BA) as part of a joint US investigation into an alleged cartel over passenger ticket pricing which saw BA suspend two senior executives.

 Some European and US airlines said on Thursday they had been asked to assist in the suspected price-fixing investigation but were not direct targets.

 BA, Europes third-largest carrier, said the investigation by Britains Office of Fair Trading (OFT) and the US department of justice related to passenger ticket prices, including fuel surcharges.

 The carrier said its commercial director Martin George and head of communications Iain Burns had been given leave of absence during the investigation.

 The investigation follows a price-fixing probe involving airlines cargo charges announced in February which spread to carriers in the US, Europe and Asia. That investigation is still proceeding.

 BA shares, which had been trading at five-year highs, fell 5.8 per cent to 346-1/2 pence by 1039 GMT.

 We would be very surprised if a specific issue relating to BAs pricing has developed. Unfortunately, though, putting key personnel on leave is a difficult signal for the market to interpret, Deutsche Bank analysts said in a note.

 The OFT said it visited BAs offices on June 13 as part of a civil and criminal investigation into alleged price coordination and its probe was at an early stage.

 American Airlines, BAs Oneworld alliance partner, said it has been contacted by US authorities about the probe, but was not implicated.

 American Airlines has received a United States federal grand jury subpoena in connection with a government investigation into alleged price fixing in the air passenger industry, it said in a statement.

 United Airlines and Richard Bransons Virgin Atlantic also said they were cooperating with authorities.

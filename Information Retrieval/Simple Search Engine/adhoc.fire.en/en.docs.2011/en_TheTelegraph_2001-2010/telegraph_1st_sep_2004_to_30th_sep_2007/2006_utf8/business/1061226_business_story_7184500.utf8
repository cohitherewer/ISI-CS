 Citi in talks for $5bn core sector fund

 New Delhi, Dec. 25 (PTI): Global financial services firm Citigroup is in talks with the government to start a $5-billion debt and equity infrastructure fund in partnership with IDFC.

 Another US-based private equity firm, Blackstone, has also proposed a fund for infrastructure in India, the size of which is not known.

 Citigroup has proposed a total fund of $5 billion, of which $2 billion is intended to be equity and $3 billion for debt, finance ministry joint secretary (infrastructure) Arvind Maya Ram said.

 The fund by the group would be in association with the Infrastructure Development Finance Company (IDFC), he said.

 The exact nature of approvals that the fund needs would depend on the structure of the fund, he said, adding that talks are at a preliminary stage.

 Citigroup CEO Charles Prince had proposed the fund at a meeting with finance minister P. Chidambaram in New York earlier this year and later, some of the top bosses of the financial services major met officials in North Block, he said.

 We have welcomed the idea but it is still in a preliminary stage, Maya Ram said.

 Blackstone officials had also met Chidambaram in New York and proposed to come out with an infrastructure fund, but have not pursued it with North Block so far, he said.

 Recently, Citigroup India CEO Sanjay Nayar had said the group had only a discussion (with the government) for doing something in the infrastructure sector... But it is only a concept right now.

 The government has estimated that infrastructure development would require $320-350 billion in the next five years, 20 per cent of which is expected from private firms.

 New Delhi, Sept. 17: The Indian real estate industry is poised to witness a majorchange over the next three to five years as the country emerges as a major investment destination for global realty and investment firms, according to a joint study conducted by Ernst amp; Young and Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci).

 Enlargement of project size with focus on product differentiation and quality, geographic de-concentration from metros to smaller cities, shift from regional developers to national developers, consolidation of large Indian business groups and their emergence as market leaders, shift from land transaction to development transaction are some of the developments that will take place, says the study.

 Change in ownership to leasing, movement of construction giants up the value chain and the emergence of strong real estate capital market will also be the key drivers. 

 The study closely examines the scale of opportunity, the catalysts for growth and the potential challenges in commercial offices, residential, hospitality, commercial retail and entertainment segments of the industry. In the commercial office segment, demand for office space is set to expand significantly.

 The demand will primarily be driven by information technology and the IT enabled services (ITeS) industry, which, according to estimates, will require additional office space of more than 367 million sq ft until 2012-13. 

 Indias improving image as a regional corporate base for Asian markets and strong growth in emerging sectors such as financial services, pharmaceuticals, telecommunications and biotechnology will also boost demand and broaden the occupier base. Several upcoming and proposed special economic zones are expected to provide the next generation impetus to the commercial office space development in the country.

 Another catalyst of growth for Indian realty will be the urban development initiatives of the government. 

 Offering significant fiscal benefits, SEZs are bound to attract the IT and ITeS sectors.

 such as Jawahar Lal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JnNURM) and the Mega Cities Fund scheme. These schemes aim to enhance the infrastructure provision and the quality of living in large urban centres.

 Infy in pact with global oil firm

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Sept. 13: Infosys Technologies Ltd has formed a global alliance with oilfield and information technology firm Schlumberger to provide information management solutions to integrate technical and business processes for oil and gas companies. 

 Infosys already provides technical solutions to some global oil and gas companies, but had not entered the domestic market so far. According to a company spokesperson, Infosys provides technology solutions to the supply chain management of some global oil and gas companies. 

 The alliance combines the exploration and production (E amp;P) domain expertise of Schlumberger with the global delivery model (GDM) of Infosys. Schlumberger is the worlds leading oilfield services company supplying technology, information solutions and integrated project management for customers working in the oil and gas industry. This alliance will allow Infosys to explore a new domain and help them enter a new vertical, said an industry analyst. However, an Infosys spokesperson refused to give any financial details of the alliance.

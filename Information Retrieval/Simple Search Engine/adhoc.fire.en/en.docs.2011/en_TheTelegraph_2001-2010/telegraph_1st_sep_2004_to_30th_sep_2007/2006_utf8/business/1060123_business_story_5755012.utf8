 Long-term core sector bonds on way

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY 

 New Delhi, Jan. 22: The government is planning to issue long-term infrastructure bonds with a maturity period of 15-20 years.

 Though there are several gilt issues in the market, the government feels that there is a need for a new long-term instrument to raise resources for funding infrastructure projects that have a long gestation period.

 The offering could come with a tax-saving option making it attractive for middle class retail investors as well as companies on the lookout for tax shelters. For middle class investors, any savings option would be within the Rs 1-lakh limit. 

 The governments gilt offerings are currently trading at annualised interest rates of 6.7 per cent for 364-day papers and about 7.2 per cent for 10-year papers. In contrast, corporate papers are offering rates between 7.1 per cent to 7.7 per cent for 1-10 years. While banks are offering 5-7.25 per cent for 1-6 year deposits. Bank deposit rates may, in fact, climb up further. 

 All this is putting a pressure on the government to raise borrowing rates, something which it does not wish to do. 

 North block officials feel that a long-term gilt, perhaps with a tax-savings option, sold directly in the retail market can help keep the average interest cost low. 

 However, the problem for the government in making any retail long-term offering and pricing most of its existing small-savings schemes is the fact that it has announced an 8.5 per cent rate of interest for the Employees Provident Fund. 

 All new offerings, like the infrastructure bonds, will suffer from being benchmarked against the EPF rate. 

 One way out of all this is to take a fresh look at reports which have been gathering dust for some time ? these call for linking infrastructure bonds with black money amnesty schemes, officials said. 

 Although the Left has been pushing for such bonds to unearth black money, these could be hard to justify to the common man, especially to honest tax-payers. But finance minister P. Chidambaram has come up with quite a few surprises in the past. 

 The government is also considering issuing new inflation-linked bonds for retail investors, especially for senior citizens. 

 The ministry has even sought suggestions on bringing out a series of capital-indexed bonds. 

 The Centres proposal has mentioned capital indexed bonds, which would be sold through auction, where competitive bidders would bid in terms of a desired real yield. Officials, however, said the indexed bonds proposal needs to be modified considerably. Although the government has many options, a decision will depend on two issues ? the cost of funds so that it can mop up as much money as it needs at the lowest possible rates and the attractiveness of the scheme so that people who invest are induced to park their surplus funds with us, officials said.

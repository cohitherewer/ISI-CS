 Piramyd Retail set to sport new logo

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Sept. 12: The Ashok Piramal Group-controlled Piramyd Retail is all set for a fresh brand identity to attract young customers.

 In a month, we are coming out a new tagline and a logo. This is basically a re-launch of our old brand, Nandan Piramal, executive vice-chairman of the company, said. 

 The branding exercise is being carried out by a Mumbai-based agency called DNA. 

 The look and feel of the brand will be much more refreshing than before. This will be in tune with our changing customer profile, he added. He, however, refused to divulge the financial details of the entire exercise. 

 The entry of Reliance has stirred up a storm in the retail sector with almost all players drawing up their own plans. Pantaloon and Shoppers Stop have already announced huge investments. 

 Piramyd also intends to talk to foreign retailers to start new concepts like speciality stores or hypermarkets.

 The group now operates two brands Piramyd and Trumart. The Piramal group sold Crossroads to the Pantaloon group and put all future retail expansions under Crossroads on hold.

 Religare in pact with Dutch insurer

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 7: Ranbaxy promoter group company Religare Enterprises and Dutch insurer Aegon NV have signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to provide insurance and asset management services in India.

 The MoU will combine the international expertise of Aegon with the distribution strength of Religare, a Religare release said.

 Religare, the financial services arm of Ranbaxy, has more than 150 offices across the country. Aegon is one of the worlds largest life insurance and pension companies.

 Entering the Indian market continues Aegons strategy of expanding into countries that offer long-term growth opportunities for insurance and investment products, Aegon said in a statement today.

 The companies are expected to announce a transaction later this year.

 India has long been identified as one of Aegons target markets because of its large population and rapidly developing economy, relatively low penetration level of insurance and strong growth rates projected for the insurance sector in the coming years, it added.

 We are very pleased with the opportunity to join our strong partners at Ranbaxy promoter group to offer protection and financial management solutions to customers throughout India, said Donald J. Shepard, chairman of Aegon.

 Among the companies interested in entering the insurance business in India is the Bharti Group, which is making its foray into the life insurance sector.

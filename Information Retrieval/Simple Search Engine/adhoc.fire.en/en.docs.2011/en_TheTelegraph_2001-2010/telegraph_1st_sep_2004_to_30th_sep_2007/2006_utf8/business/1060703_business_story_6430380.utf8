 Why arbitrage ain?t the rage

 The new kids on the block aren?t so hot, says Srikumar Bondyopadhyay

 The equity markets are unpredictable. But, your investment needs protection against such volatility. With this catchline, three mutual fund houses ? Tata Mutual Fund, JM Financial and UTI ? have hit the market with their arbitrage fund offers.

 But do these funds present a better opportunity to retail investors to rev up returns on investment while ensuring a greater degree of security?

 Not really. Let?s explain why. An arbitrage fund is a relatively new concept in the domestic mutual fund industry and it came in with the introduction of the derivatives market a few years ago.

 Fund funda

 Like any diversified equity fund, arbitrage funds also invest in equities. But stock picking in an arbitrage fund is not guided by the way in which the share price of a particular company or the equity market as a whole will move, but by the existence of ?arbitrage opportunities? or mismatch in prices of a company?s share between the spot and the derivatives market. 

 For example, if a stock is quoting at Rs 50 in the spot market and its one-month futures at Rs 70 in the derivatives market, the price difference net of cost of carry (for holding the stock for one month) gives the extent of arbitrage in that stock.

 Market neutral?

 Hence these funds are often referred to as market neutral. But remember that stock investments are never risk-free. Stock futures attract a premium when the markets move up and there is a discount when they decline. So, the arbitrage opportunities increase in a rising market and shrink in a declining market.

 Now that the equity markets in the country and world over have retreated from their peaks, there could be few opportunities to arbitrage between the spot and the derivatives market. Most futures in the derivatives market, even the three-month futures, are trading at a discount. 

 Besides, 25 per cent to 30 per cent trading in the derivatives market have always been arbitrage trading. With more and more fund houses now going in for arbitrage trading, the premium of stock futures will be squeezed and the returns in these funds will go down. 

 The table shows one-year returns of arbitrage funds were 75 to 100 basis points more than those on fixed-income instruments such as bank fixed deposits for a year.

 Does it make sense?

 Is it worthwhile to take the market risks for that marginal higher return? Certainly not if you are a small investor and looking for a long-term growth. 

 The diversified equity schemes are still way ahead in terms of returns. Arbitrage funds are for big-ticket investors, for whom a marginally higher return than the ruling interest rate means a lot.

 Hit or miss

 Why can?t arbitrage funds match the returns of diversified equity funds? Here?s why: the basic investment proposition of an arbitrage fund is to buy stocks in the spot market and sell them in the futures market at a premium or buy a near month futures and sell a far month futures. 

 All the arbitrage funds launched recently plan to invest 65 per cent of the fund corpus in equities. Now, irrespective of whether you have the equity underlying the futures, you will have to keep margin money to carry out any transaction in derivatives. 

 This means fund managers of the arbitrage funds will have to keep aside between 15 and 20 per cent of the fund corpus in non-interest bearing margin money. They will deploy the remaining 15 to 20 per cent of the corpus in fixed-income instruments such as government securities, bonds and company fixed deposits. A large part of your investment (about 40 per cent) in an arbitrage fund gives no or marginal returns. 

 However, the plethora of arbitrage funds that are in the pipeline indicate one thing ? fund managers are optimistic about a turnaround in the equity markets in the near term. That information could be your pick from these NFOs.

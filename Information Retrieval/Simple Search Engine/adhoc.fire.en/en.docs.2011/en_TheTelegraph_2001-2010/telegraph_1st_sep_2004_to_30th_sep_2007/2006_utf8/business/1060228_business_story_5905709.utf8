 Stocks turn upbeat, hunt for clues

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Feb. 27: The sensex today recovered from its pre-budget lows of Friday and ended at a new closing peak. 

 The benchmark 30-share index rallied to the intra-day high of 10296.22 and ended at 10282.09, up 81.33 points or 0.8 per cent against Fridays close of 10200.76. 

 The Economic Survey has projected an 8.1 per cent GDP growth and has prescribed tax and labour reform measures to boost industrial growth. However, investors pursued sectors that they thought would gain from the Union budget tomorrow. 

 The sectors which witnessed investor interest included information technology, automobiles, banking, capital goods, infrastructure and some FMCG and metal stocks. 

 However, analysts feel the markets might correct tomorrow, irrespective of the budget, as there are no significant expectations. 

 Analysts say the market will take a cue from the budget and may remain volatile till the fine prints are out. 

 On Monday, software firms were the major gainers as they are deemed less vulnerable to policy changes. Infosys Technologies gained 3.4 per cent to Rs 2,849.75, Satyam Computer Services rose 1.8 per cent to Rs 781.90, while TCS climbed 1.4 per cent to Rs 1,690. 

 Apart from Infosys, Zee, PNB, HDFC Bank, Gujarat Ambuja Cements and Satyam were the biggest index gainers, while GSK Pharma, Dabur India, HLL and MTNL lost out. Textile stocks also edged up on expectations of tax incentives/rationalisation in the budget. Arvind Mills, up 6 per cent at Rs 104.50, was one of the top gainers. 

 Select cement stocks also rose on rumours that excise duty on cement may be reduced to Rs 350 per tonne from Rs 400 per tonne. 

 The market breadth was marginally positive, with gainers edging out losers 1308 to 1154 and 70 shares remained unchanged in a low volume of 165 million shares. The total market turnover was Rs 24,474.72 crore. 

 The BSE index has risen more than 9 per cent this year on the back of foreign portfolio investment of more than $2 billion. The 50-issue NSE index rose 0.6 per cent to 3067.45 points. 

 Strong FII inflows, which reported net investments of over Rs 1,890 crore in the first four days of last week, were the driving force behind the market with fresh purchases in the cash segment.

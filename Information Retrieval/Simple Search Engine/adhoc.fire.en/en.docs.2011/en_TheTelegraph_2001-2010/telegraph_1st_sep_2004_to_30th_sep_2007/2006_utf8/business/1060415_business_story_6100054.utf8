 Fed to put an end to rate-hike run

 Oklahoma City, April 14 (Reuters): Federal Reserve governors have hinted that the central bank might be close to the end of its extended programme of interest rate hikes, although not at the expense of allowing an unwanted rise in inflation.

 Governor Susan Bies told reporters after a speech to business leaders in Los Angeles that the Fed is getting closer to calling a halt to its string of interest-rate hikes.

 Were closer (to neutral) than we were a few months ago, she said. Neutral rates are those that neither stimulate nor stymie economic activity.

 Biess comments were echoed by Governor Mark Olson who, speaking at the University of Arkansas in Little Rock, said the Fed has reached a point in monetary policy it had previously identified as neutral.

 But he said it was impossible to know whether the policy was indeed neutral, and that theoretically conditions could exist for the Fed to go beyond neutral.

 At the Feds March meeting we did indicate that some additional tightening may be required, but we also were quite careful to say that would be dependent on the information that comes in, Olson said.

 Indeed, because there is a delay between implementation of rate hikes and their impact on the economy, the Fed needs to be aware of the potential for overshooting, Governor Donald Kohn said in Oklahoma City after a speech to business leaders.

 Overshooting is one of the things we are very aware of as a risk in policy today, Kohn said, noting that it was not good enough to just look out the window at current conditions.

 The economy was at an extremely interesting juncture, Kohn said, adding that he did not know how much policy firming will be needed to accomplish the Feds objective of sustainable growth and low inflation.

 Since June 2004, the Federal Open Market Committee has raised interest rates 15 times by a quarter of a percentage point each, bringing the bellwether federal funds rate to its current 4.75 per cent from 1.0 per cent.

 On balance, financial markets are expecting two more rises, which would carry the benchmark funds rate to 5.25 per cent.

 Kohn, seen as a possible contender to succeed Roger Ferguson as vice chairman of the Fed, said the hikes had so far achieved the central banks goal of sustainable non-inflationary growth.

 The FOMC is aware of the dangers inflation poses, and was weighing information meeting by meeting, he said.

 Kohn said US housing markets are likely to feel the first effects of interest-rate rises and cited signs that home markets are starting to slow, adding that this could weigh on consumer spending.

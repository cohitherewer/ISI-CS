 SpiceJet inks $1.1bn Boeing deal

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Aug. 14: SpiceJet has entered into a sale and lease-back agreement for 16 Boeing aircraft at over $1.1 billion. The low-cost air carrier has inked the deal with Babcock and Brown Aircraft Management (BBAM) along with its long-term strategic partner, Nomura Babcock and Brown Company Limited. 

 The Boeing 737-800/900ER aircraft will be delivered over 22 months beginning January 2007. Earlier, SpiceJet had completed a similar financing with BBAM for the delivery of its first four B737-800 aircraft. 

 We believe that the introduction of these aircraft, along with SpiceJets low-cost business model, will improve its dominance in the Indian market, said Steve Zissis, president of BBAM.

 Mumbai, June 9: A combination of positive cues emerging from global markets and short-covering today led to a massive pullback on the bourses with the sensex surging 515 points, its highest ever single-day gain.

 Though the recovery was led by heavyweights like Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), several mid-cap and small-cap scrips too joined the party. After four days of wreck, all sectoral indices ended in the positive territory.

 However, the only question haunting the brokers is whether the rally seen today is sustainable. Some are apprehensive of a massive correction following todays rise. 

 Brokers said the share movements next week would to a large extent depend on the cues that are emerging from other bourses. Much will also depend on the response of participants like mutual funds who have been sellers of late.

 An observer said though the benchmark index has spurted 515 points, it is still short of 640 points to cover the 1155 points it lost in the last four trading sessions. There is an apprehension that there would be heavy selling on Monday, he added.

 The sensex today opened at 9270.78 and was continuously in the green, except for a few minutes in early trade. However, with buyers making a strong comeback, it shot to an intra-day high of 9849.20 and closed at 9810.46, a gain of 514.65 points over Thursday. It thus broke the earlier record of 426 points of March 24, 1992.

 The National Stock Exchanges nifty also spurted by 141.95 points or 5.21 per cent to 2,866.30.

 Heavyweights like Grasim Industries, ITC, NTPC and Larsen amp; Toubro led the recovery along with RIL. Reliance rose by Rs 96.85 (11.74 per cent) to close at Rs 922.10, while Reliance Energy gained Rs 56.25 (14.91 per cent) to close at Rs 433.50.

 Other index-related shares like Grasim rose by 13 per cent, L amp;T by 7.5 per cent and ITC by 9 per cent.

 All the sectoral indices finished in the positive territory. While the BSE mid-cap index rose 5.6 per cent, the BSE small-cap gained 4.57 per cent.

 The broad-based BSE-100 index recouped 275.84 points to end at 4997.48 from the last close of 4721.64. The BSE-200 index and the Dollex-200 also were quoted sharply up at 1184.53 and 429.30 compared with last close of 1118.64 and 404.65 respectively. The BSE-500 index jumped by 213.05 points to 3763.05 from 3550.

 The volume of business was relatively low at Rs 3,438.34 crore against Rs 3,682.00 crore on Thursday. RIL remained the most active share with the highest turnover of Rs 594.07 crore (including multi-block deals) followed by Tata Steel (Rs 94.98 crore), SBI (Rs 94.29 crore), Hind Zinc (Rs 92.46 crore) and Infosys Tech (Rs 87.56 crore).

 Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have been net buyers for most part of this month. Sebi figures reveal that these investors, who sold shares worth Rs 8,247.40 crore in May, have been net buyers for most of this month. Over the past five trading sessions, they have been net buyers of Rs 1,439 crore.

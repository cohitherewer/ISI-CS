 Harvest time

 New Delhi, Feb. 28: Finance minister P. Chidambaram today sought to give a fillip to the agricultural sector by raising the target of institutional farm credit to Rs 1,75,000 crore, and slashing the interest rate on short-term farm credit to 7 per cent. He also increased the outlay for accelerated irrigation benefit programme (AIBP) to Rs 7,121 crore.

 I propose to ask the banks to increase the level of credit to Rs 1,75,000 crore in 2006-07 and also add another 50 lakh farmers to their portfolio, said Chidambaram.

 The government has also decided to ensure that a farmer receives short-term credit from Nabard at 7 per cent interest rate, with a Rs 3-lakh upper limit on the principal amount. This will require certain level of subvention to Nabard. I propose to give the subvention, said Chidambaram.

 The policy will come into force with effect from kharif 2006-07.

 He also announced relief to farmers who have taken crop loans for kharif and rabi 2005-06, an amount equal to 2 per cent of the borrowers interest liability on the principal amount up to Rs 1,00,000 would be credited to his bank account before March 31.

 A sum of Rs 1,700 crore had been set aside for this purpose, said the finance minister.

 He also asked banking sector to credit-link an additional 385,000 self-help groups (SHGs) in 2006-07.

 Chidambaram said Nabard would be asked to open a separate line of credit for financing farm production and investment activities through such groups.

 Chidambaram also proposed to increase the corpus of rural infrastructure development fund (RIDF) in 12 tranches to Rs 10,000 crore. A separate window under RIDF XII for rural roads with a corpus of Rs 4,000 crore during 2006-07 will be opened.

 The programme for repair, renovation and restoration of water bodies was being implemented through pilot projects in 23 districts in 13 states, he said.

 In the first phase of the programme, 20,000 water bodies with 1.47 million hectare command areas have been identified.

 The finance minister said the design of the programme was finalised in consultation with the states and estimated cost of the programme stood at Rs 4,481 crore.

 I intend to seek, and receive, funds from multi-lateral agencies, he said

 The outlay for AIBP has been raised to Rs 7,121 crore which will include a central grant component of Rs 2350 crore.

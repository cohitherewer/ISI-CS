 New issues cash in on market buoyancy

 CHANDRALEKHA TULAL

Mumbai, Dec. 30: A stellar year for the secondary market and the euphoria spilled over to the primary market. 

 The year 2006 saw 73 initial public offers mobilising Rs 19,324 crore. That is a neat 93 per cent more than Rs 9,990 crore mobilised during 2005. 

 Did anyone ask about the returns? The multibagger award for the year definitely goes to a little known company Atlanta Ltd. The company went public in early September and got listed on the bourses later that month with an issue price of Rs 150. 

 Since then, the stock has hit a high of Rs 1,350, translating into a return of a whopping 800 per cent. However, it closed the year at Rs 983, with an eye-popping return of 555 per cent. 

 Tech Mahindra comes second on the list with a triple-ton return of 358 per cent. The scrip, which went public in August at an issue price of Rs 365, closed the year at Rs 1,672.55. It had hit a high of Rs 1,748.70 during the period. 

 The going has, however, been not nearly as smooth for the countrys first low-cost airline, Deccan Aviation. The airline scrip is now lagging behind at Rs 136.45 from its issue price of Rs 148. The highest it hit after it got listed on bourses in early June was Rs 154.85. 

 Reliance Petroleum, the second largest issue for the year mobilising Rs 2,700 crore, ended the year at Rs 62.85, a mere 4.75 per cent above the issue price of Rs 60. 

 The total mobilisation, including follow-on public offers, for the year was at Rs 24,141 crore. This is the second highest in the history of the Indian capital market, according to Prime Database. The highest, so far, was in 2004 at Rs 30,511 crore.

 Price busters on the way

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Dec. 19: Worried over overheating, the government today said it would take pre-emptive measures against inflation.

 We have to be ahead of developments and take pre-emptive action rather than fall behind and take corrective action, finance minister P. Chidambaram said after his ministry released the mid-year review.

 The review, which took stock of government finances and economic trends, said the combination of high economic growth and slow creeping up of inflation ... has generated some concerns about overheating. 

 Chidambaram said it was too early to say whether the government has put the lid on inflation by reducing oil prices, lowering customs duty on food and raising interest rates. 

 The economy has posted robust growth in GDP of 9.1 per cent in the first half of the year on the back of 9.2 per cent growth in the second quarter which is slightly higher than the rate of growth of 8.9 per cent in the first quarter.

 However, inflationary pressures put by rising food and oil prices are worrying North Block. 

 The inflation rate, measured by the wholsesale price index, at 5.16 per cent though lower than the rate of 5.3 per cent in November is still above the 5 per cent mark, which the finance ministry considers as tolerable.

 To stop prices from going out of control, the response needs to be prospective rather than retrospective. For instance, the review said, any tightening in the money supply will be in response to an inflationary problem anticipated in the future, not an inflationary bout that has already taken place. 

 Analysts said this indicates a policy towards marginally raising interest rates, to check excess and speculative spending, and reducing customs duties to check commodity prices.

 To drain away excess liquidity the RBI had earlier raised interest rates and the cash reserve ratio of banks. 

 The government too has sharply cut duty on wheat, sugar, edible oil to help ease supply constraints. The report said buoyant foreign inflows continued to drive liquidity growth in the first half. 

 Overseas investors have bought $9.2 billion of stocks and bonds in the year till December, generating liquidity.

 The rapid growth, helped by inflationary pressures, money supply and credit growth, also meant that the government was able to breach its revenue target for the half year. Net tax revenues of the Centre for the first half of the year was higher by 35.1 per cent at Rs 1,29,986 crore. 

 The report said the government was budgeting for a fiscal deficit of 3.4 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) for 2007-082008, down from 3.8 per cent for this fiscal.

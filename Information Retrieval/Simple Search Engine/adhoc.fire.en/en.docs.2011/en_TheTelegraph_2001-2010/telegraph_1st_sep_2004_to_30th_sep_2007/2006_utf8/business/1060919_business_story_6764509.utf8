 Calcutta, Sept. 18: The members of the Calcutta Stock Exchange (CSE) are set to join the trading platform of the National Stock Exchange (NSE).

 An MoU in this regard will be signed within a month, CSE administrator T.K. Das said on the sidelines of the 83rd AGM of the century-old bourse. 

 Das said at a meeting of the bourses last Friday, NSE agreed to provide its platform both for the cash and derivative segments.

 He said this was different from an earlier proposal of NSE to make CSE its subsidiary with CSE member brokers becoming sub-brokers of the exchange.

 I expect that the draft MoU will come this week and within a month the final MoU will be signed. After that a final agreement will be prepared which will be sent to the market regulator Sebi for its approval, Das said. 

 Since Lyons Range has the licence for spot trades, its members cannot trade in derivative products of the NSE. We will have to apply for licence for the derivatives segment, too, for which CSE and its member brokers will have to comply with a stricter set of norms, Das said.

 He expects CSE members to clock a daily turnover of Rs 800-1,000 crore on the NSE platform. Even now, trades from the city made up between 10 per cent and 12 per cent of NSE turnover, Das said.

 Meanwhile, the BSE has also agreed to offer its platform to CSE on easier terms after NSE relaxed its offer terms.

 Das said the BSEs initial proposal was for a special deposit of Rs 10 crore plus restrictions on sale of its memberships and denying the use of the terminal outside the city. 

 The BSE management has conveyed us that it would get back with more relaxed conditions. We want to keep both the BSE and NSE platforms, Das said. 

 AGM furore

 The CSE members did not approve the annual accounts for 2005-06 at the AGM today. The members have not approved accounts since 2002-03. 

 CSE brokers allege that for the last four years they have not received any certificate of TDS on the accrued interest on margin capital that have been with the exchange.

 This margin capital was frozen and is with the exchange since the scam of 2001. The brokers, thus, could not claim a deduction against the TDS, which amounted to over Rs 6 crore. 

 Sources said CSE got a favourable order from the city high court over the dispute with Calcutta Municipal Corporation on the 10-acre land near EM Bypass. 

 The corporation, which wanted the land back from CSE, has been told by the court to speed up the process of transfer of land to CSE.

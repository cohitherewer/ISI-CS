 Paswan hints at change in steel policy 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 19: The Centre is considering changes in the National Steel Policy barely six months after it was unveiled.

 Union steel minister Ram Vilas Paswan said there were grey areas in the policy regarding movement of iron ore within the states.

 There are some issues with the distribution of iron ore. This has to be looked into. We will come out with a raw material policy soon, Paswan said here today.

 The ministers comment assumes significance as mining leases have caused many a heartburn among the states.

 For instance, Bengal lost out to Jharkhand when the latter walked away with a Rs 12,000-crore steel project of the Jindal group.

 Jharkhand, Orissa and Chhattisgarh have the lions share of Indias iron ore deposits. But they are unwilling to share the riches with other states.

 Paswan said state governments have the last say on the allotment of mines and they are using this power to allot mines to only those companies who are also willing to set up units in the state.

 Paswan also criticised the states for signing numerous MoUs with private companies for iron ore. Jharkhand signed more MoUs than the reserve it has, he added.

 The minister pointed out that there were no dearth of iron ore in the country with deposits over 23 billion tonnes. But the distribution channel is not right. Every company, be it Posco, Mittal Steel, Essar, Jindal and Ispat are vying for ore. Selection of mine has become a problem, he said.

 The government had set up a committee under former secretary R.K. Dang to look into this sector. The committee has sent its recommendations to the ministry.

 The new policy on raw material will also formulate guidelines on export of ore.

 Paswan assured that the interest of domestic players would be preferred over exports.

 Indias iron ore production now stands at 142 tonnes, while 78 mt is being exported every year. It is the third largest exporter of iron ore in the world.

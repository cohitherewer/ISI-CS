 Lack of appetite for Burger King IPO

 Stale taste

 New York, May 13 (Reuters): Burger King Holdings is expected to serve up its initial public offering next week, but analysts are expecting a tepid debut for the second-largest hamburger chain in the United States.

 Burger King was on a roll with eight consecutive quarters of increased same-store sales, but dropped the ball in the first quarter of this year.

 This is really about Burger King having dropped a couple of burgers off the grill in its past history, said David Menlow, president of IPOFinanacial.com, an independent research firm based in Millburn, New Jersey.

 The current management team has made tremendous strides in making it more palatable...This investment is still about what have you done for us lately.

 The Miami-based company said net income for the first nine months of fiscal 2006 fell 18 per cent from last year. Burger King reported net income of $37 million on revenue of $1.5 billion, compared with net income of $45 million on revenue of $1.4 billion during the year-earlier period, according to its filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.

 The hamburger-chain blamed the decline in part on a $14 million loss related to its refinancing last summer, and increased income tax expenses.

 Burger King is floating 25 million shares in the IPO, which could raise up to $460 million. The underwriters, led by JP Morgan Securities and Citigroup Global Markets, expect the stock to price in a range of $15 to $17. The issue represents a 19 per cent stake in the company.

 The fast-food chain is controlled by private equity firms Texas Pacific Group, Bain Capital and Goldman Sachs.

 If the shares price at the midpoint of that forecast, Burger King would have a market capitalisation of 45 times its 2005 net earnings of $47 million.

 Burger King suffered earlier this decade from mismanagement and declining revenue. Its revitalisation began after it was bought in 2002 for about $1.5 billion from British drinks company Diageo Plc.

 The company boosted its sales with new menu items like the Angus burger, more breakfast offerings and a quirky advertising campaign.

 Burger King began as a drive-up Miami hamburger stand in 1954. In the last half-century it has grown into an international presence, selling its burgers and shakes in over 11,000 restaurants in 65 countries, according to the filing. 

 It is dwarfed only by McDonalds, which has about 30,000 restaurants in 119 countries, and therein lies another problem for Burger King, analysts said.

 What investors are really concerned about is growth, and its hard to find where the growth is with Burger King, said Tom Taulli, an independent IPO analyst and author of Investing in IPOs.

 Theyre in a market where the real value is with McDonalds. They have so much more going for them than Burger King. ... Given that McDonalds is so powerful and has so much more marketing muscle, they might not have the resources to promote that growth. They will get it off the ground, I just dont see it as being a great deal.

 Raymond, Belgian firm ink pact

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Feb. 15: Raymond Ltd is spinning off its denim business into a separate 50:50 joint venture with UCO NV of Belgium. The proposed firm, UCO-Raymond, will own the denim business of both Raymond and UCO with a combined capacity of 80 million metres.

 UCO has manufacturing facilities in the US and Belgium. It is setting up a new facility in Romania, which will be commissioned by May with a capacity of 40 million metres.

 Raymonds denim division has an annual capacity of 30 million metres of high-end ring denim, which will be increased to 40 million metres by March at its factory in Yavatmal.

 This joint venture will create an entity with manufacturing facilities across three continents and a global marketing network, said Gautam Hari Singhania, CMD of Raymond.

 We are expecting a combined turnover of Rs 1,150 crore for the first year. However, the impact of the new company will come into effect only in the next fiscal, he added.

 UCO-Raymond will be formed in Europe with outfits in India, Belgium, Romania and the US. The due diligence, demerging the assets and setting up the new company will be completed by the first quarter of next fiscal, said Pradeep Bhandari, group president of Raymond.

 The deal, cleared by the board of directors, is subject to due diligence as well as approval from shareholders and appropriate authorities. 

 The denim unit of the UCO group accounts for 75 per cent of its total sales. In fiscal 2005, the company had achieved a turnover of 104 million euros.

 The denim division of Raymond had achieved a turnover of Rs 210 crore for the nine months ended December, an increase of 28 per cent over the comparable previous period.

 The global denim market has a capacity of 4.5 billion metres, of which 30 per cent is constituted by the high-end segment. The joint venture company will constitute 6-7 per cent of this market.

 The joint venture will leverage on the denim-making facility in India. It will also derive benefits from synergies in joint marketing, manufacturing, product development, product mix, sourcing and a flexible supply chain, Singhania said.

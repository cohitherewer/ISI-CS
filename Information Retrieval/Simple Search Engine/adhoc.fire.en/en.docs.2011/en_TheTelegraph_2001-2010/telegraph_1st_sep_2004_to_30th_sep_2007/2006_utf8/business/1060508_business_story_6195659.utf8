 Reality check on emerging markets

 Which way to go?

 Even the permanent bears are becoming optimists. Long-term sceptic Stephen Roach, chief economist at investment bank Morgan Stanley, now says, ?The odds are shifting away from disruptive global rebalancing.? That?s quite an admission for someone who has, ever since the current boom began, been crying wolf about the mounting global imbalances.

 However, it?s scarcely a surprise. Investors would have missed the entire bull run had they listened to Roachs gloomy prognostications. Stock markets across the world have been booming ? the Dow Industrials rose to a 6-year high last week, while the MSCI Asia-Pacific index, which tracks 14 markets in the region, rose to a new high, and we all know what?s happening in the Indian market.

 Liquidity continues to be very strong and total fund flows into emerging market equity funds this year, according to Emerging Portfolio.com, have already topped $28 billion, with country funds investing in the BRIC markets (Brazil, Russia, India, China) and the new breed of BRIC funds accounting for $13 billion of those inflows.

 Liquidity flows are propelling commodity prices to new highs. Take copper, which surged to another record high last week. Analysts say that funds tracking commodities indexes may hold almost three times more copper contracts than physical metal stored in warehouses monitored by exchanges in London, New York and Shanghai. Back home, FII buying has turned positive this month. In short, there are plenty of reasons for Roach to throw in the towel.

 Ironically, he does so at a time when there are signs that the party is nearing an end. Interest rates continue to rise, the 10-year government bond yield in the US has crossed 5 per cent and growth is picking up across the globe at a time when money is becoming tighter. That will mean there?s less money left over for investing in financial assets. But then Roach himself has admitted that he was bullish in 1999 and we all know what happened to the tech boom after that. Could Roach?s turning bullish be the straw that breaks the back of this bull run?

 Strong FII inflows have not deterred brokerages from sounding the warning bells on the Indian market. The foreign brokerages have been particularly downbeat but even the Indian houses are now joining in.

 Citigroup, for instance, has a year-end target of 8500 for the sensex. Michael Hartnett, global equity markets equity strategist at Merrill Lynch, points out in a recent report that the strong inflows into emerging markets are unsustainable, citing high energy and commodity prices and the narrow market performance. 

 For instance, of the 829 stocks in the MSCI EM index, the 100 best-performing stocks in the first quarter of the current year contributed 70 per cent of price return.

 So what does Hartnett advise his clients? The obvious choice, he says, is to own stocks in countries with current account surpluses and cheap PE ratios. Russia, Indonesia and Brazil fall into this category. Korea is another recommendation. Across emerging markets, he advises investors to stay overweight on infrastructure and consumer themes because ?these are secular mega-themes within emerging markets that will generate strong earnings for infrastructure and consumer plays over a number of years?. 

 On India, Hartnett says a bubble in global emerging markets will appear first in the Indian market, which is currently quoting at a 45 per cent premium to emerging markets.

 Calcutta, Feb. 13: The Union Bank of India plans to raise between Rs 450 crore and Rs 495 crore through its follow-on public issue comprising 4.5 crore equity shares.

 The bank has fixed the price band between Rs 100 and Rs 110, which is 6.38 per cent less (at the upper limit of the band) than the bank?s closing price of Rs 117.50 on Bombay Stock Exchange today. The offer will remain open from February 15 to 21.

 This is the bank?s second public issue comprising 8.91 per cent of its post-issue equity capital. Following the issue, the government?s holding in the bank will come down to 55.43 per cent from 60.85 per cent. Net offer to the public will be 4.05 crore shares and investors can bid for a minimum of 50 shares or in multiples of it.

 During the last calendar year, Union Bank?s total business grew by Rs 27,871.91 crore to stand at Rs 1,21,187.60 crore as on December 31. The bank has posted a net profit of Rs 530.57 crore for the nine months of the current fiscal, a rise of 10.50 per cent over the comparable previous period.

 ?The earnings suffered due to a loss from treasury income during the April-September period,? said Bhaskar Sen, general manager, treasury and international banking. 

 During the period, the bank had to make a provision of Rs 235 crore for transferring investments worth Rs 7,224 crore in government securities from ?available for sale? to ?held-to-maturity? (HTM) category.

 Between April and December 2005, Union Bank witnessed a year-on-year deposit growth of 26.25 per cent at Rs 70,469.37 crore, while advances increased 35.25 per cent to Rs 50,718.23 crore. These translated into a 93 per cent growth in the bank?s credit-deposit ratio, following which its capital adequacy ratio fell to 10.91 per cent from 12.09 per cent as on March 2005.

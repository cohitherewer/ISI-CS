 Lending rate hike on SBI agenda

 Mumbai, Dec. 12 (PTI): State Bank of India (SBI) today said it could consider raising lending rates if its profit margins come under pressure. However, it would take a call if the Reserve Bank (RBI) decides not to offer any interest on the cash reserves deposited with it.

 The decision on offering interest rates on cash reserve ratio (CRR) funds is still pending with the apex bank. 

 RBI has not closed the issue completely but assuming it decides not to pay interest we could consider raising the lending costs, SBI managing director Yogesh Agarwal said on the sidelines of a Dun amp; Bradstreet conference.

 Agarwal said the finance ministry has asked RBI to consider the issue of offering interest on the amount parked with it as CRR. If our profit margins come under pressure we could look at passing on a part of the cost to the customers, he said.

 He, however, declined to comment on the quantum of rise in rates. It would depend on what interest the RBI decides to offer on CRR funds, he said. 

 When asked of a possible slowdown in credit offtake following the 50 basis points rise in CRR by the apex bank recently, Agarwal said the busy season would start soon and it remained to be seen if the demand of credit from productive sectors was in the offing.

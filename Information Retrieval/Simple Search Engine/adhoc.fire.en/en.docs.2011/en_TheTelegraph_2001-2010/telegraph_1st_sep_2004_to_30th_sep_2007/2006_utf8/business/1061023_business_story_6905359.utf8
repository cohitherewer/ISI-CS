 Oil biggies eye Norway tieups

 S.P.S. PANNU 

 Reaching out

 New Delhi, Oct. 22: The Oil India Ltd-Indian Oil Corporation combine and ONGC are planning tieups with Norwegian oil firms Statoil and Norsk Hydro for technical collaboration and joint ventures in the upstream sector.

 According to sources, a high-level team from Norway, which will include CEOs of the two companies, has agreed to visit India next month for further discussions that could culminate in the signing of collaboration agreements. 

 The Norwegian companies have cutting-edge technology in deep-sea oil exploration, which the Indian companies are keen to harness as they have failed to discover a major oil source despite heavy investments. 

 The companies could also jointly scout for oil and gas exploration opportunities in Africa, Latin America, Russia and the Caspian region.

 The petroleum ministry had asked OIL and Indian Oil to join hands for overseas oilfield acquisitions on the same lines as ONGC-Videsh. The plan is to club the upstream technical expertise of OIL with the financial muscle of Indian Oil.

 ONGC has already roped in Norways Norsk Hydro in a joint venture for oil exploration in the deep-sea areas of Cuba. Although Norsk Hydro has a small share in the equity, it is the technical expertise of the company that ONGC is banking upon for a breakthrough. The Indian oil major is keen to strengthen this relationship. 

 ONGCs deal with Statoil had come under a cloud in 2002 when it hired a deep-sea rig from the company on a nomination basis, which was against the government policy of buying rigs through tenders. 

 However, there has been a major management change in Statoil since then and the Indian companies are keen to forge a successful relationship.

 ONGC floated a global tender to hire rigs from TransOcean and Dolphin for oil hunt in the Gulf of Mexico. The company hired the rigs on a time charter basis and has been shelling out close to $700,000 per day for the deep-sea hunt. It has used its own rig Sagar Vijay at lesser depths.

 However, despite having drilled several wells, ONGC has made no significant discovery. 

 The gas discoveries made by Reliance and Niko in the Krishna Godavari basin and the finds of Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation are largely because of the spadework done by ONGC in collecting the geological data and mapping fields.

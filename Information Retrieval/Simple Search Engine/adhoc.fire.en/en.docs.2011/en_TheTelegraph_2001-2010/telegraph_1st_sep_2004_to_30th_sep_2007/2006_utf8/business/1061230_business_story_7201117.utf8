 New Delhi, Dec. 29: Tax exemptions for those who earn a salary of up to Rs 2 lakh and loans for farmers at a 4 per cent interest pay-back farm sector experts and trade union leaders came up with such suggestions at the traditional pre-budget meeting with finance minister P. Chidambaram today. 

 With key state elections round the corner, the government gave more than just a patient hearing to the experts suggestions.

 Senior officials said there was a Congress party directive to streamline policies taking care of farmers and common mans interest in the coming budget. We have asked the government to break with the past and present a people-friendly budget, Gurudas Dasgupta, general secretary of All India Trade Union Congress, said.

 We feel the income tax exemption limit should be doubled to Rs 2 lakh in view of the overall increase in prices, Intuc chief G. Sanjeeva Reddy said. The FM has assured us he will consider this demand. 

 Farm activist Sharad Joshi said he had asked Chidambaram to implement the recommendations of the National Farmers Commission on providing crop loans at just 4 per cent interest. The central and state governments would pick up the subsidy tab on the difference, he added.

 Joshi also advocated a financial package that would serve as an exit route for farmers, including those who would sell land to special economic zone developers. 

 He also wants restrictions on transport, storage, marketing, processing and export of farm products. He described the Essential Commodities Act as an archaic legislation which bestowed enormous power on the state but hardly any legal obligation to ensure that farmers get a fair and remunerative price for their crops.

 Trade unions also want perquisites given by employers to be exempt from the fringe benefit tax.

 Unlisted firms to sponsor global issue

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, June 28: The government today permitted unlisted companies to come out with sponsored offerings of American depository receipts (ADRs) or global depository receipts (GDRs).

 A sponsored offering enables domestic shareholders to trade in their stock for an attractive price. The shares tendered are then offered to overseas investors through an ADR or a GDR issue.

 Analysts said the measure would provide an exit route for domestic shareholders of such companies even as it could also enhance their liquidity in the overseas markets.

 In a notification issued today, the government said unlisted Indian companies would be allowed to sponsor an issue of ADRs/GDRs with an overseas depository against shares held by its shareholders, subject to certain conditions. While unlisted companies which had issued FCCBs, ADRs/GDRs prior to August 31, 2005 and are not making profit may be permitted to sponsor issues against existing shares held by its shareholders, these companies have been told that they will be permitted to comply with listing conditions on the domestic stock exchanges within three years of having started making profit.

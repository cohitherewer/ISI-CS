 Supply drag fails to lift tea export price

 Calcutta, Aug. 13: Indian tea continues to fetch low prices in world auctions despite adverse supply conditions in the country and Kenya. India had drought-like conditions in the first half of this year, and Kenya was in the grip of a full-blown drought.

 According to the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) of the United Nations, the composite price of tea globally has remained steady at $2 per kg and lower for the last 17 years. A shortfall is not expected to drastically alter the scenario.

 Globally, prices are on the rise, but oversupply at times forces down rates. While world consumption has been growing steadily at 1 per cent for the last few years, there is an excess in supply with the 36 producing countries increasing their output by 2 to 10 million kg, Tea Board chairman Basudeb Banerjee said.

 Industry analysts said the crop shortfall in Kenya and India is balanced by the production in Tanzania, Indonesia, Vietnam, Bangladesh and the Philippines.

 There was a rise in prices in 1976 and in 1983-84, but it failed to have an impact on importing markets, including the price-sensitive ones of Egypt and Pakistan, in the long run.

 According to Tea Board figures, world auction prices for Indian tea was $1.39 per kg from January to June 2006. For the same period in 2005 and 2004, they were $1.32 and $1.28 per kg respectively.

 Prices in Mombassa were $2 per kg in 2006, $1.46 per kg in 2005 and $0.99 per kg in 2004 for the half-year period.

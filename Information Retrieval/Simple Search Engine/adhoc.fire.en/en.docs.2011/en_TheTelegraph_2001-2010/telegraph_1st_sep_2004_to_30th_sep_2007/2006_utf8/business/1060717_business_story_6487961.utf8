 Mumbai, July 16: The Wadhwan family, whose business interest includes real estate and housing finance, has made a foray into retail with eight stores in Mumbai under brand name Spinach. The company will soon add another store.

 Promoted as the neighbourhood food and grocery store, Spinach stores are expected to cater to the daily needs of retail customers. The stores will be in three formats ? the Spinach Local, which will be approximately 2,500 square feet in area, Spinach Super almost 5,000-7,000 sq ft and Spinach Express would be the large format stores.

 Part of the Wadhwan Food Retail Pvt Ltd, the company is expected to invest close to Rs 100 crore this financial year.

 We plan to have close to 60 stores in Maharashtra, mostly in Mumbai and about 10 to 12 in Pune, said Dippankar Haldar, CEO, Spinach. 

 Depending on the size and the location of each store, we could end up spending between Rs 50 lakh and Rs 1 crore on each store. We plan to have each store approximately within a nine-kilometer radius of the other, he said.

 The company plans to move to the eastern parts of the country in the next financial year. During 2007-08, we plan to open stores in Calcutta. We are scouting for locations as of now and Calcutta could have close to 10 Spinach stores, he said.

 The company plans to have its own private labels as well as well-known brands. We have a centralised bakery that supplies to the stores. And we plan to source a few private labels too, Haldar added.

 For selecting locations and property for the stores, the company will consider its own land as well as others.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Hind Petro on Bangla gas trail

 Fuel factor

 New Delhi, Nov. 10: Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) wants to enter Bangladeshs retail LPG and compressed natural gas (CNG) market in partnership with a local company.

 HPCL is looking for a suitable Bangladeshi company to form a joint venture, chairman and managing director M.B. Lal told The Telegraph.

 Petrobangla, Gas Transmission Company Ltd (GTCL) and Titas Gas are the leading companies in Bangladesh with which HPCL could forgetieups.

 Lal said Bangladesh has abundant supplies of natural gas while HPCL can use its expertise in the downstream retail business to get the joint venture going.

 HPCL wants to initially start a pilot project in Dhaka before launching a full-scale business in the country.

 HPCLs strategy for Bangladesh marks a break with the past when Indian companies were trying to import gas from Bangladesh.

 US upstream firm Unocal, which had discovered the gas, was keen to sell it to India.

 The Bangladesh government, however, had taken the stand that there was no certainty about the domestic availability of gas and so Dhaka could not commit exports to India.

 Unocal, however, had been telling Indian companies that there was surplus natural gas to buy.

 Unocal had roped in GAIL for laying a pipeline from the Bangladesh border to Indian consumers. GAIL had even chalked out a blueprint for the pipeline and worked out the funds required.

 The US company played a crucial role in assuring India that the gas would come through and it was being held up for political reasons. 

 Lubricant facility

 HPCL is planning to use its lubricants facility at Calcutta to produce emulsified bitumen. Lal said bitumen produced at the companys refinery at Vizag would be brought to Calcutta and emulsified at the facility that would be set up at its lubricants complex.

 Emulsified bitumen is a ready-to-use product that can be spread on the roads without heating. It enables quick pavement of roads and, unlike the traditional method, does not cause any pollution as it is not required to be heated.

 Panipat, April 5: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today said the UPA government had lined up projects involving investments of Rs 1,80,000 crore in new highways and road networks. 

 Laying the foundation stone for the Rs 325-crore elevated highway project here, Singh said the government would provide every village in the country with roads, telephone connections, electricity and drinking water by 2009, under the Rs 1,74,000-crore Bharat Nirman Programme.

 I have repeatedly said our country needs world-class infrastructure. We have set for ourselves a growth target of 8 to 10 per cent over the coming years, he said. 

 To meet this target, the country will need massive investments in basic infrastructure such as roads, ports, telecom, electricity and airports.

 In addition to the huge outlay on the road network, the Centre would assist in improving state highways and other roads, Singh said.

 He said in the last year alone the government had awarded contracts to turn 5,500 kilometre of national highways to four-lanes, the highest since the start of the National Highways Development Programme. 

 He said the UPA had given the highest priority to build more roads, schools and hospitals for villages. 

 Roads connect villages to towns and towns to big cities and bring jobs closer to our homes. High quality roads also encourage setting up of new industries and create new income opportunities, he said. Our government has given the highest priority to develop national highways and rural roads. 

 Singh said the road project in Panipat would ease congestion in this town as long-distance traffic would ply on the elevated highway, while local vehicles would move below without being affected by heavy traffic.

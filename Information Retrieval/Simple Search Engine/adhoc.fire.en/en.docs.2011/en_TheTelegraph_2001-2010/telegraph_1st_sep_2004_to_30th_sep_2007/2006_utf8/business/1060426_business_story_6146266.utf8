 More services come under tax net

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, April 25: The government today notified that 15 more services would be liable to tax, including ATM operations and Net telephony, as specified in the Finance Act 2006.

 The new services include share transfer agents, registrars, ATM operations, sale of space for advertisement other than print, international air travel other than economy class, public relations, and Internet telephony. 

 These services will become taxable from May 1.

 The government has withdrawn exemptions on six services, including call centres, re-insurance premium from home and abroad, outdoor caterer charges in academic institutions and medical establishments.

 The Finance Bill 2006 also removed the exemptions to call centres and medical transcription, railway catering done by an outside party and the work done by chartered accountants other than auditing and accounting.

 Also under the net are Internet telephony, cruise operators, sponsored entertainment events other than sports, and ship management. 

 Credit card, debit card and other payment card-related services are under the levy fire as well.

 The government has also clarified that it would strike down on work of a banker in a public issue and clinical testing of drugs and formulations.

 Services of the Reserve Bank of India have been freed of the burden. 

 In the budget, finance minister P. Chidambaram has raised the service tax rate from 10 per cent to 12 per cent, which will bring in Rs 34,500 crore.

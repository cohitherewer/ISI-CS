 Setting sail

 Mumbai, May 2: Larsen amp; Toubro Ltd, the engineering and construction firm, has bagged its maiden order for shipbuilding from Zadeko Ship Management CV of the Netherlands. L amp;T will build four ships for Rs 440 crore.

 The order marks the formal launch of the company?s foray into shipbuilding.

 The vessels will be built at a new shipyard in L amp;T?s engineering complex at Hazira in Surat, the company informed stock exchanges today. The construction of ships is scheduled to commence in July, it added.

 Chairman and managing director A.M. Naik said shipbuilding would significantly expand the company?s high-tech manufacturing capabilities. It is also a major step towards meeting its strategic growth objectives.

 He added that the new venture would be aligned with the country?s priority towards increasing its share in the global shipbuilding market.

 Zadeko, the Rotterdam-based shipping company, caters to special purpose cargo movements.

 Many leading shipping companies across the globe are also in touch with L amp;T for their fleet augmentation requirements, the release said.

 In line with the global trend in shipbuilding, the company would adopt modular construction and seamless work-flow techniques at its shipyard to meet the stringent delivery schedules.

 Described in technical terminology as RO-RO/LO-LO semi-submersible, heavy lift container cargo ships, these highly specialised vessels are among the only one of its kind to be made in India, the release said.

 The vessels have a dead-weight capacity of over 8,250 tonne, 17,000 cubic metres of cargo hold and can carry 830 teu (twenty-foot equivalent unit) of containerised cargo.

 The Hazira shipyard will focus on construction of commercial vessels and warships for the navy as well as the coast guard.

 The yard will have the capacity to construct high technology vessels of up to 150 metre length and displacement of 20,000 tonne, the company said.

 L amp;T also plans to install ship-lift system for new construction, repairs and refit of ships, including defence and paramilitary vessels.

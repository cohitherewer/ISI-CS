 Calcutta, April 11: Beltek Group, which exited the state in the 90s, has returned to introduce a slew of consumer electronic goods.

 The company has launched colour televisions, digital video disc players (DVD) with multi-player systems, compact disc players and home theatre systems in Calcutta.

 The group turnover is expected to increase to Rs 350 crore in the next one year with a foray into home appliances.

 The company had a turnover of Rs 200 crore in 2004-05, which includes that of the groups sister concern that makes set-top boxes and another subsidiary that bottles Aquafina.

 We have appointed eight distributors in the state and are also in partnership talks with a Dunlop-based company to manufacture original equipment. We would finalise a deal in the next two to three months. It all depends on how quickly the sales pick up in the state, said Mohit Verma, director of Beltek Group.

 The company will introduce its home appliances by mid-May. This will include refrigerators, air conditioners and microwave ovens.

 The company sells around 20,000 television sets a month. It plans to garner a 5 per cent market share in the state and has set a target to sell 2000 sets in 2006.

 Beltek sells 5000 DVD players and 4000 DVD multi-players a month and expects to sell 1000 to 1500 units in Bengal this year. It sells around 2000 to 2500 home theatres every month. However, the annual sales target for the state would be 300 to 400 units.

 We have made innovations in the home theatre technology to give the surround sound effect by connecting the television with any channel to the home theatre system, Verma said.

 The price of colour television ranges between Rs 4,000 and Rs 12,000 and DVDs between Rs 2,400 and Rs 2,700.

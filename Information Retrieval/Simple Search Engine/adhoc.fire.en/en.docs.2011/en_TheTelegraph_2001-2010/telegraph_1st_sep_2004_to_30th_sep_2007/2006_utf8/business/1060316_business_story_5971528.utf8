 Boots readies ?250-m store recast plan

 New remedy

 London, March 15 (Reuters): The countrys top health and beauty retailer Boots Group is to invest ?250 million in a revamp of its local pharmacies and supply chain, but up to 2250 jobs could go as distribution depots close.

 Boots, whose acquisition of drugs distributor and retailer Alliance UniChem was effectively cleared by competition authorities on Tuesday, said 700 of its smaller stores will be given a major overhaul.

 The three-year investment at the 1,400-strong chain will see ?70 million pumped into a new automated warehouse in Nottingham.

 But this will eventually lead to the closure of 17 regional warehouses and lorry docking stations, leading to up to 2250 job losses out of a group total of 45000 full-time equivalents.

 Many of these employees will be redeployed either through relocation to nearby stores or the Alliance Unichem merger, and others would go through natural wastage, chief executive Richard Baker told a conference call.

 This is another step forward in modernising the retail chain. Its the biggest single commitment given by a large retailer to the local high street, he said, drawing a contrast with moves by other retailers into out of town centres.

 Usdaw, the main trade union for Boots employees, said there was no need for employees to panic given the long time-scale of the redundancies and what it called its long standing and positive relationship with the company.

 The move comes as Boots seeks to spend some of the ?400 million it has kept back from the 1.9 billion pound sale last year of its over-the-counter drugs portfolio Boots Healthcare International (BHI).

 Of the remaining ?1.5 billion, ?1.4 billion has already been returned to shareholders.

 Consequently, the announcement should not affect analysts pretax profit forecasts of around ?380 million for the current year, a Boots spokesman said.

 The changes to the supply chain and lower IT expenses will remove around ?60 million of annual operating costs by 2010/11, it said, weighted towards the later years of the project. No savings are expected in the 2006-07 financial year.

 Savings will be achieved through efficiencies in the supply chain and a resulting fall in capital invested in stock.

 The total cash cost of the changes would be ?250 million, with a further ?45 million of asset write-offs, the company said.

 The capital investment would be about ?120 million, with the first ?50 million taken in 2006-07 and the remainder over the following three years.

 High prices take fun out of Indian safari

New destinations

 New Delhi, May 7: Hefty hotel rates and a fat tab on air fares have made India an unattractive destination to holiday-makers.

 Both Indian and foreign tourists are heading to neighbouring countries to spend their summer vacations. 

 Tour operators and travel agents said destinations like Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Thailand, Maldives, Egypt and even Turkey are preferred destinations of Indians.

 For the approaching summer vacations, we already have started getting a lot of bookings. Tourists prefer to travel to Bangkok, Sri Lanka and Malaysia rather than plan an expensive trip to Cochin and Rajasthan, said Subhash Goyal, chairman, Stic Travel and president of the Indian Association of Tour Operators (Iato).

 Operators said an increase in room rates of five star hotels and high air fares, especially for travel to South India, are the main deterrents.

 Indian customers get value for money when they travel to Thailand, Sri Lanka and China. They utilise half the money they will end up in spending in India, said Praveen Chugh, vice- president, Travel Agents Federation of India (TAFI).

 Chugh said, There is a shortage of rooms in India and everyone knows this. Hotels, however, are not running in full capacity. But despite this, the rooms are overpriced. No five star hotel in Delhi and Chennai is selling rooms for less than Rs 8,000 a night, while prices in Bangalore, Cochin and Pune are as high as Rs 12,000.

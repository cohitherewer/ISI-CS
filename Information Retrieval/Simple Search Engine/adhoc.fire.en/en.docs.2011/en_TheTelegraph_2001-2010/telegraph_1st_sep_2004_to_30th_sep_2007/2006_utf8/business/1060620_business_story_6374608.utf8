 GHCL buys UK home textile chain

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, June 19: GHCL has acquired 100 per cent of Rosebys, a leading retail home textile chain in the UK, for $40 million (Rs 180 crore).

 Rosebys has a turnover of around 115 million euros and a strong presence in bedding, curtains and kids garments with over 300 retail outlets across the UK.

 GHCL said after the acquisition, it would become an integrated home textiles company with presence in spinning, weaving, product design and development, sourcing and distribution to retail stores at a global level.

 The company said the equity cost of acquisition would be funded through the resources raised from various domestic and foreign institutions. The acquisition is likely to be completed by October, after which GHCL would have a complete control over Rosebyss operations.

 GHCL chairman Sanjay Dalmia said, This acquisition provides us with an ideal opportunity to leverage Rosebyss established platform across the EU markets and a renowned global brand to make GHCL a dominant player in the home textile space globally. It would be an ideal combination of a low-cost strong manufacturing base with a large established marketing platform to put us on the growth fast track.

 Last year, GHCL acquired Dan River Inc, which is present in the US textile markets. Dan River has a large sales and distribution network within the US catering to large retailers like JC Penny and Linen amp; Things, Wal-Mart and Bed, Bath amp; Beyond.

 With these acquisitions, GHCL is set to enter the $40-billion US and UK markets, which account for 60 per cent of the global home textiles trade.

 In India, GHCL is expanding its capacity in spinning from 85,000 spindles to 1,40,000 spindles over the next 18 months. The company is completing a home textile manufacturing facility at Vapi at a cost of Rs 230 crore.

 Silverline enters into health deal 

 Mumbai, Dec. 26 (PTI): Silverline Technologies Ltd (STL) today announced its tieup with Canada-based Sumalytics Inc to foray into the North American healthcare market.

 The duo is targeting to tap more than 2,000 hospitals in the US alone during 2007, STL informed the Bombay Stock Exchange.

 Over the next few weeks, STL, which is a 100 per cent export oriented unit, would spell out details on the initiative. 

 It would leverage its facilities in Gujarat and Mumbai to deliver these initiatives, the company added.

 Sumalytics, a healthcare change and performance management company, has developed Variance Analytics (VA) that would deliver value to clients in hospitals, insurance companies and governments that fund healthcare, it added.

 Silverline would be the global shared services provider working strategically with the North American firm.

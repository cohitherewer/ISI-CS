 No relief for IDBI in Haldia Petro case

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, May 30: Delhi High Court today dismissed Industrial Development Bank of Indias appeal for a stay on the Company Law Boards order, which deferred the allotment of shares by Haldia Petrochemicals to the financial institution.

 IDBIs earlier plea on the issue was rejected by a single bench of the court. 

 While dismissing IDBIs appeal, the division bench of acting Chief Justice Virender Jain and Justice Kailash Gambhir said it would hear the matter after the CLB takes a decision on the petition. The final hearing at the CLB is scheduled on July 4-6. 

 While rejecting IDBIs petition on May 15, the single bench of Justice Vikramajit Sen had said it was inappropriate to express opinions on the merits of the case as it might affect the CLBs independent decision. 

 IDBI is the principal lender in a consortium of 52 financial institutions and had lent around Rs 3,500 crore to Haldia Petrochemicals.

 Dispute arose between the promoters after the HPL refinery, which was making loss till last financial year, decided at an EGM to allot shares worth Rs 135 crore to IDBI under the corporate debt restructuring package.

 This was objected by The Chatterjee Group (TCG) on the grounds that after the share allotment, they would lose their control over the refinery.

 Later, TCG moved the CLB to restrain allotment of HPLs shares or ownership rights to IDBI.

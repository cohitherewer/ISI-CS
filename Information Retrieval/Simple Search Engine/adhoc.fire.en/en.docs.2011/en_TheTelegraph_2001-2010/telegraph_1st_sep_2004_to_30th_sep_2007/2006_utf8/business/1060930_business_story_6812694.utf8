 Leyland prunes stake in IndusInd Bank

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Sept. 29: Ashok Leyland today offloaded close to 2.9 per cent of its holding in IndusInd Bank to comply with Reserve Bank of India (RBI) guidelines. Ashok Leyland held a 12.89 per cent stake in IndusInd and RBI regulations state that a company must not hold more than 10 per cent stake in a bank.

 The sale was conducted through a block deal on the BSE today. The Chennai-based automobile company sold a little over 84 lakh shares at an average price of Rs 46.08 apiece, thus taking the deal size to Rs 38.70 crore. While the deal was struck in two tranches, more than 83 lakh shares were picked up by Credo Capital Plc, a UK-based wealth management group that also acquires and manages commercial properties and investment banking.

 Credo Capital also has an exclusive India desk whose clients are high networth individuals, institutions or hedge funds, private equity investors and venture capital funds. It could not be ascertained whether this investment was on the sole proprietary account of Credo or it was done on behalf of a client.

 Market circles had, however, anticipated such a sale by Ashok Leyland. In an interaction with analysts last month, Bhaskar Ghose, managing director and CEO of IndusInd Bank, had acknowledged that Ashok Leyland may bring down its stake to below 10 per cent by the end of September. 

 Ghose had then clarified that Ashok Leyland or any other investor is not waiting for a strategic investor to come in to comply with regulatory requirements. The two issues are not really directly linked, he added.

 There have been reports over the past couple of months that a strategic investor may be inducted into IndusInd Bank. It is believed that ABN Amro Bank is among the frontrunners to pick up less than 5 per cent in the private sector bank. This investment by Credo Capital comes at a time when the bank has confirmed that it is in talks with a global bank to offer wealth management services and that a formal agreement will be signed shortly. 

 IndusInd Bank is also planning to enter other activities that include credit cards and insurance distribution, even as it is also open to acquire a non-banking finance company. At the banks annual general meeting on Thursday, shareholders passed a resolution authorising the banks board to issue GDRs, ADRs and issue on a preferential basis capital to qualified institutional bodies. This, however, is an enabling provision.

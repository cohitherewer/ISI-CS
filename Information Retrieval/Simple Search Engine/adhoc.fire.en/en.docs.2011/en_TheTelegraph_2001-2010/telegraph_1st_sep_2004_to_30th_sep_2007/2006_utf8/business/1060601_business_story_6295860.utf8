 Infosys plans to set up five SEZs

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 31: Infosys Technologies plans to set up five exclusive special economic zones.

 At the moment, we have set up one campus at the Mahindra SEZ in Chennai. The five SEZs ? in Pune, Chandigarh, Mangalore, Thiruvananthapuram and Mysore ? that we are looking at are in different stages of approvals, said Kris Gopalakrishnan, chief operating officer of Infosys.

 Infosys had earlier said it planned to hire 25,000 people in 2006-07. Gopalakrishnan said a major chunk of the employees would be for the SEZs.

 The company was also in talks with the Bengal government for setting up a 100-acre campus at Rajarhat. Two company officials had visited the city to survey the plot owned by West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation (WBIDC). However, the high price of land is being cited as the main roadblock to IT investments there.

 We are still in talks with them. Nothing has been finalised, he said.

 Unveiling Infosyss plans on patenting product innovation, Gopalakrishnan said it was evaluating patenting of its 82 inventions at its Software Engineering and Technology Labs, which spearheads its technology innovation development. The company filed for 20 patents last year.

 Infosys also said it is looking at acquisitions to enter new markets.

 We think companies with turnovers between $50 million and $100 million are reasonably good since we are looking at strategic partnerships, he said. 

 Banking, healthcare and life sciences are some of the areas the company is targeting.

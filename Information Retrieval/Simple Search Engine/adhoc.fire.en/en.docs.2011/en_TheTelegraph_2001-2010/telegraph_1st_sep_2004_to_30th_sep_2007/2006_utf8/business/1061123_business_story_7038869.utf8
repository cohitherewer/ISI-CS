 New offers of over Rs 50 cr under watch

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 22: A day after market regulator Sebi slapped a huge penalty on market intermediaries for getting involved in the IPO scam, the government has decided to examine all initial public offerings (IPOs) that raised more than Rs 50 crore in the last three years.

 As part of this campaign aimed at protecting individual investors, the Registrar of Companies (RoC) has been asked by the ministry of company affairs to keep a watch on all IPOs to hit the market since 2004. These IPOs have collected around Rs 25,000 crore from the public.

 According to a ministry official: The government would keep a strict watch on the IPOs that have hit the markets in the last three years and raised Rs 50 crore to ensure that the funds raised have been utilised according to the initially announced plans.

 This move is a follow-up to the clampdown yesterday by Sebi against two depositories, NSDL and CDSL, and eight depository participants, such as ING Vysya Bank and Karvy Stock Broking, which have been asked to pay a disgorgement amount of around Rs 116 crore. 

 The market regulator felt that several entities either deliberately closed their eyes when the wrongdoers perpetrated their illegality or were actively involved in the transactions.

 In the last three years, there have been a slew of mega and medium-sized IPOs from different entities such as Suzlon, TCS, Reliance Petroleum, Patni Computers, Biocon, NDTV and Jet Airways.

 The official said the registrar of companies, where the companies file their annual returns, would monitor the use of IPO funds, though no particular sector or group of companies have been identified for monitoring. 

 Most companies file their annual returns between October and December.

 In 2004, the company affairs ministry had launched an operation against vanishing companies, which led to some companies filing their returns to comply with the guidelines. The ministry had also strengthened its efforts against serious corporate offenders through the serious fraud investigation office.

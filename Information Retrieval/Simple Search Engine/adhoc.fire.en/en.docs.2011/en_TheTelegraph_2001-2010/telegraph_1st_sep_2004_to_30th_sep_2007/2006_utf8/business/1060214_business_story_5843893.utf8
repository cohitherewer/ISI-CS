 Scam kingpin in CBI net

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 13: Ending a three-year search, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has arrested Dinesh Dalmia, a director of DSQ Software, for his alleged involvement in the Rs 595-crore securities scam that broke out in 2001.

 The accused was arrested late on Saturday night from a south Delhi location by the officers of the CBIs bank fraud and securities cell.

 The accused is also wanted by Calcutta Police in two cases and non-bailable warrant (NBW) has been issued against him in these cases. Dalmia is also reportedly wanted by other agencies.

 CBI has found that Dalmia had allegedly created non-existent entities, which were falsely shown as trusts of DSQ Software. 

 Dalmia was produced before link metropolitan magistrate Sanjiv Jain at the designated court today. The court remanded him in transit custody of CBI and directed that the accused be produced before the court of assistant chief metropolitan magistrate (ACMM), Egmore, Chennai, where a case against him is pending.

 The accused fraudulently issued letters to National Securities Depository Limited (NSDL) Mumbai, showing a preferential allotment of 100 lakh equity shares of DSQ Software to these non-existent trusts, CBI said in a statement.

 CBI said DSQ Software had allegedly not allotted any preferential shares to these trusts and the accused had fraudulently induced NSDL to credit these unallotted shares in the demat accounts of the falsely created entities by deception and frauds.

 It has also been found that DSQ Software had allotted 30 lakh partly-paid shares to another investment company in the UK, CBI said. Through similar deception, the accused induced NSDL to credit the partly-paid equity shares of DSQ Software as fully-paid equity shares along with the existing shares, it said.

 Dalmias passport was revoked by the regional passport officer in Chennai in April last year on the request of CBI. Dalmia was traced in the US after fleeing the country in December 2003.

 Despite being summoned by the court, the additional chief metropolitan magistrate issued an open-ended non-bailable warrant of arrest against Dalmia.

 The news of Dalmias arrest would also encourage Calcutta Police, which was gearing up to seek his remand in the 2001 stock scam. The scam had led to an acute payment crisis on the Calcutta Stock Exchange and finally to the crash of stock markets across the country.

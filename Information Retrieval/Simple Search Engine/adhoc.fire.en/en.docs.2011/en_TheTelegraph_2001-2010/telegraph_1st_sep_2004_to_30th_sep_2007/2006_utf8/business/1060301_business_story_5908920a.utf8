 Global option for local MFs

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Feb. 28: The budget 

 proposal to remove the 10 per cent reciprocal shareholding 

 requirement for investment in foreign equity will open up 

 global investment options for Indian investors as the fund 

 houses of the country line up to launch such schemes.

 Among the first to do so would 

 be the countrys largest mutual fund house, UTI Mutual 

 Fund, which had entered into a tie-up with State Street 

 Global Advisors (SsgA) almost two years back to launch global 

 equity funds.

 We had already outlined 

 the product structure of our global equity fund and had 

 been waiting for the regulators nod to go ahead with 

 the scheme launch, said A.K. Sridhar, chief investment 

 officer, UTI Mutual Fund.

 We expect the regulator 

 to give us a proper guideline within a short time, following 

 which we will make the necessary finetuning to our products, 

 added Sridhar. 

 To begin with, the fund house plans to launch an index-based 

 product and a broad actively managed diversified equity 

 fund.

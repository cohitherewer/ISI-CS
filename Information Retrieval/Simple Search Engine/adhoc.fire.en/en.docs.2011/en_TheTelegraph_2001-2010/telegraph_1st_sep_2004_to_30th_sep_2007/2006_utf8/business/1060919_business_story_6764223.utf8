 Peugeot, Proton plan partnership

 Good friends

 Paris, Sept. 18 (Reuters): Frances PSA Peugeot Citroen and Malaysias Proton are looking into forming a partnership that covers at least the Southeast Asian region, the two carmakers said on Monday.

 The study is expected to take several months and will focus on areas like product development, manufacturing, quality initiatives, vendor development, contract assembly and distribution.

 SA Peugeot Citroen, Europes second-biggest carmaker, and state-controlled Proton have been grappling with competition and PSA, suffering from higher raw material prices, has issued three profit warnings in roughly a year.

 The announcement comes after a business weekly reported in May that the carmakers were in talks about jointly developing and making new models in the Southeast Asian market and that PSA could eventually end up taking an equity stake in Proton.

 For PSA the agreement is expected to increase its car sales in Malaysia and develop its business in the region, while Proton said it hoped to benefit from the technological know-how of a major carmaker and make the best use of its production capacity.

 The areas being studied will focus on offering benefits to both parties in the Asean region and elsewhere, the companies said in a statement.

 Asean, the Association of South East Asian Nations which has been a free trade area since 1993, includes Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam, and says it has a combined gross domestic product of almost $700 billion (372 billion) and trade of some $850 billion (452 billion).

 Troubles at PSA have prompted the company to work on a plan, to be disclosed by the end of September, to improve profit margins in 2007 but PSA head Jean-Martin Folz will not oversee the improvements due to his early retirement next year.

 Proton is facing mounting competition and falling prices as the government opens the domestic market to foreign rivals under free trade deals. It said earlier this month it was reviewing its performance targets for its financial year.

 Beetle in debutant parade

 Bug party

 New Delhi, Jan. 5: The New Beetle is coming to town.

 The Bug ? which achieved almost an iconic status in Europe back in the sixties ? is a 2.5-litre five-cylinder engine that generates 150 bhp and is an improved version of the concept car that was first unveiled in 1994 and carried the New Beetle tag.

 Volkswagen, which was unwittingly drawn into a corruption scandal that engulfed its plans to establish a plant in Andhra Pradesh last year, isn?t planning to launch the car in India. It only plans to showcase the model at the Auto Expo that opens here on January 12.

 The New Beetle ? which will be leading a long line of debutants at the eighth Auto Expo ? has bolder and sharper lines that seek to moderate the bulbous shape of the old Beetle, especially at the wheels and bumpers. 

 VW leads a large German contingent of car and auto component makers, including Mico Bosch, that will showcase their products at the week-long extravaganza.

 Several Indian outfits on their maiden trip to the Expo will be hoping to grab the attention of aficionados. International Cars and Motors Limited (ICML) will make its debut with its multi-utility vehicle Rhino. ICML is a part of the Sonalika group, makers of International Tractors. 

 S. Burman, head of operations at ICML, said, ?We will initially manufacture passenger vehicles. This year, we also plan to make a slew of launches in the sports-utility vehicle category. In future, we might produce commercial vehicles.?

 Rhino is set to compete with General Motors?s Tavera and Mahindra?s Scorpio. Other debutants include Kranti Automobiles, a maker of light commercial vehicles and three-wheelers. In the two wheeler category, Kandaa Motors, the entrant from Maharashtra, will add some freshness. 

 The company has already been selling its motorcycles in India for the last two years. Present in 100cc, 125cc and 150cc category, the company sells bikes under Thunder and Tracer brands. It also claims to be the first one to introduce self-electric start in 100cc category. Rajender Singh Kandaa, managing director of Kandaa Motors, said, ?We will price our bikes competitively.?

 At present, this segment is already crowded with players like Bajaj Auto, Honda Motors and Scooters India Limited, TVS Motor, Yamaha Motorcyles and Suzuki Motorcycle. Kandaa Motors, a 35-year-old company, has primarily been present in the business of manufacturing heavy duty pressed parts for players like Telco and Mahindra. 

 A large number of auto component makers from Italy, China and Taiwan will also be jostling for attention at the sprawling Pragati Maidan where organisers are bracing to deal with a record turnout of visitors.

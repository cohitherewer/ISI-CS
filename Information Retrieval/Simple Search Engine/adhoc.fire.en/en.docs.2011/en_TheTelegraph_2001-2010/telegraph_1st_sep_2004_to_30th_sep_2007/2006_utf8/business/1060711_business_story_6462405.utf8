 New twist to Amar Ujala row

 URVASHI KAUL 

 New Delhi, July 10: The Company Law board today reversed its earlier order on the Amar Ujala group of newspapers and directed majority shareholder, the Maheshwari family, to buy out minority stakeholders, the Aggarwals.

 It further directed the Maheshwaris to disclose the funding pattern for acquiring the Aggarwals stake before making the payment. It clarified that this should be done before paying the first instalment.

 The order binds the Maheshwari family by all the terms of the consent order dated January 25, 2006, which were applicable to the Aggarwals, who were asked to buy out the shares of the Maheshwaris. 

 The CLB noted that the consent order had been obtained by suppressing facts. 

 The Aggarwals, holding a 35.33 per cent stake in Amar Ujala Publication Ltd, had petitioned the CLB alleging mismanagement of the company affairs and suppression of minority stakeholders by the Maheshwaris, who hold a 64.67 per cent stake.

 Following negotiations, the CLB had allowed minority stakeholders (Aggarwals) to buyout the company within a period of three years in five instalments.

 In March, the board asked the Aggarwals to furnish the financial funding pattern.

 Counsels defending the Maheshwaris had raised objections to the financing pattern of the Aggarwals, alleging that the first instalment was not paid from their own funds as stipulated in the consent order.

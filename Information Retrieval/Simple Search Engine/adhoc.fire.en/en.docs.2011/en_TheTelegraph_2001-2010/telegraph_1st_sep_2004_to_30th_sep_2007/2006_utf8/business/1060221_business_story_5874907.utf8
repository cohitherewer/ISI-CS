 ONGC makes use of Delhi power play

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Raha: Well-timed

 Calcutta, Feb. 20: The exit of Mani Shankar Aiyar from the petroleum ministry has prompted a shift in Oil and Natural Gas Corporation?s strategy on power foray.

 The corporation has decided to develop the Rs 2,400- crore gas-based power plant in Tripura on its own, leaving aside the joint venture company it had earlier set up to execute the project.

 The petroleum ministry had objected to ONGC?s foray into power.

 ONGC had set up a three-way venture with ILFS and the Tripura government to limit its exposure in the power sector.

 However, with Mani Shankar Aiyar making way for Murli Deora as the new petroleum minister, the company seems to have found more freedom to choose its direction.

 ONGC plans to go ahead with the project on its own, which will be reflected on its balancesheet, chairman and managing director Subir Raha told The Telegraph.

 The board, which discussed the issue today, is likely to clear the proposal in its next meeting scheduled for March 3. The project entails a 750-mw gas-based power plant at Palatana through a special purpose vehicle, ONGC Tripura Power Company (OTPCL). 

 It will also set up a transmission project to wheel power from Palatana to Bongaigaon in Assam to connect to the national power grid.

 The cost of the transmission project is estimated to be Rs 1,600 crore. This project, however, will be executed by an SPV as planned earlier.

 The company is awaiting approval for the viability gap funding to go ahead with the transmission line project.

 Raha said the Tripura project was a special case as the company had to develop the power plant to save its investment in exploration and production of natural gas there.

 ?We had to monetise the gas from the field there. It is a compulsion for ONGC,? Raha added.

 There is no ready market for the gas in Tripura. Building a pipeline to bring the gas to the market will not be viable. ?Placing cable is cheaper than pipeline,? Raha pointed out.

 The project will convert ONGCs Tripura asset, which is currently losing over Rs 100 crore a year, to a profit-making one by monetising the production opportunities.

 The power project is likely to be developed at a 70:30 debt-equity ratio. The project having two units with a capacity of 375 mw each may later be expanded to 1,100 mw.

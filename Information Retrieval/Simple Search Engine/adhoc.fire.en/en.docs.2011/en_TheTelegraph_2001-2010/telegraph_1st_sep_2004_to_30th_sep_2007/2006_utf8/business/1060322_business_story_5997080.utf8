 Louder buzz on phone service quality

 Smooth talk

 New Delhi, March 21: The Telecom Dispute Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) today issued a notice to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) asking the regulator to define quality of service.

 The notice has been issued after the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) filed an application with TDSAT on the matter. TDSAT chairperson N Santosh Hedge directed Trai to file its reply within two weeks.

 TDSAT also granted two weeks time to COAI report what was leading to poor call quality in their network. 

 COAI contended that Trai should give operators a proper opportunity to defend themselves instead of simply serving show-cause notices. 

 Trai had, on March 6, issued show-cause notices to Bharti Tele-Ventures, Tata Teleservices Ltd, Reliance Infocomm Ltd as well as Reliance Telecom, BPL Mobile, and Spice Communication after analysing their performance report.

 Meanwhile, Trai today said that it has decided not to take further action on the showcause notices till the matter is decided by TDSAT.

 The service providers to whom showcause notices were issued have submitted their reply to the authority. COAI and some service providers have appealed to the TDSAT against the showcause notices. Since the matter is subjudice, the authority has decided not take further action on the showcause notices, till the matter is decided by the TDSAT, Trai said.

 Trai has also issued regulations on code of practice for metering and billing accuracy. Under the new regulations, it would be mandatory for service providers to furnish all information about charges on value added services such as download of film, ring tones and games.

 Moreover, the regulations state that before a customer is enrolled as a subscriber of any telecommunication service, he shall be provided in advance with detailed information relating to the tariff for using that service.

 Further, the service provider shall inform the customer in writing, within a week of activation of service, the complete details of his tariff plan, Trai said.

 The services provided to the customer and all subsequent changes therein shall be those agreed with him in writing prior to providing the service or changing its provisions.

 Payments made by a post-paid customer shall be credited to his account within 3 working days of receipt of the cash/cheque. For pre-paid customers, top-up credit shall be provided to a customers account within 15 minutes of its application, the regulations stated.

 In case, the service provider unilaterally intends to restrict or cease service to the customer, a notice shall be provided to the customer in advance of such action.

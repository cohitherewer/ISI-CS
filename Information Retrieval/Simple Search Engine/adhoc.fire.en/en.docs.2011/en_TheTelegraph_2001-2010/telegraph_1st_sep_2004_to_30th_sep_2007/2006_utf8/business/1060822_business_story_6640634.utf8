 Frauds a big headache for firms going global

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Aug. 21: As Indian companies turn global and reach out to the far corners of the world, the risks of doing business also magnify.

 One of the biggest problems faced by the Indian companies today is the increasing number of frauds they face.

 According to the Ernst amp; Youngs 9th Global Fraud Survey, there has been a significant increase of frauds in emerging markets, which would include countries like Eastern Europe, Asia and Latin America. 

 Almost 42 per cent of Indian companies believe fraud levels have increased in the last two years. But thats just the tip of the iceberg. Not only has the risk of frauds increased significantly in India, it is also higher than the global average of 27 per cent. To compound the problem, almost 38 per cent of Indian firms do not have formal anti-fraud policy and 68 per cent of companies do not provide formal training in anti-fraud policies.

 Agrees Ragu Raman, CEO, Mahindra Special Services Group (MSSG), The kind of work that Indian firms have been doing in the last two to three years has changed. While previously it used to be transaction related work where our employees would just follow instructions and install processes, now it is more judgmental work. We have more IPR-related work happening in India now. The quality and the quantity of work has gone up. So, in the last two years the volume of work has also gone up from zero to may be one and a half per cent now. As a result, security related issues will crop up. In absolute terms, there may not be such an increase in terms of numbers of frauds. 

 But what are the biggest fraud risks? Its always the leak in the company. According to the survey, internal collusion tops the list with almost 36 per cent respondents agreeing to it, followed by bribery at 29 per cent and 14 per cent consider financial statement fraud as a great risk. 

 Here, we need to understand that a lot of accounting entries made in the account books of the companies are not yet being seen through the lenses of a fraud. A great part of the senior managements remuneration depends on the companys quarterly performance. So, it is quite possible that certain changes may be made in the result statement that helps them inflate the numbers. These are actual frauds but in India there is not much awareness about this as of now, said Sunil R. Chandiramani, national director (risk amp; business solutions), Ernst amp; Young. 

 When you talk about internal collusion, one must remember that in India, more than often, the employees are not even aware which information they are allowed to share in the public domain. It is more a lack of awareness than internal collusion that leads to frauds here, said Raman.

 And which are the most vulnerable sectors? 

 Wherever there is more easy access to either capital or information related to capital, said Alok Shende, director, ICT practice-India, Frost and Sullivan.

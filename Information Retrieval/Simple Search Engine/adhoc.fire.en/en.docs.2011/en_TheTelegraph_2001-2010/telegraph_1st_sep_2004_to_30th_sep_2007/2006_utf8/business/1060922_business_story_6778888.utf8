 Rail tickets from Sify cafes

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 21: The Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) has tied up with Sify iWay cyber cafes to provide online railway ticket booking services against cash payments.

 This will help people who may not be conversant with the Internet or possess credit cards. To book tickets online, credit cards were a necessity till now.

 IRCTC managing director P.K. Goel said: Less than 1 per cent of the Indian population has credit cards, and an even smaller fraction has access to net banking facility.

 Besides, people who have credit cards are wary of using them to make online purchases. The new iWay service is aimed at attracting that section as well, he added. 

 For a service charge of Rs 40 per ticket (up to six tickets), the new service allows a customer to walk into any of the 3,400 Sify iWay cyber cafes across 155 cities in the country, take the help of the cafe host to book a railway ticket through IRCTCs website, make the payment in cash and take the ticket printout.

 Although more than 8 lakh railway tickets are booked every day, only around 25,000 of the total booking is handled through the Internet, which the iWay service plans to correct.

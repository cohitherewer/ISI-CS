 ONGC has no appetite for Bharat Pumps

 S.P.S. PANNU

 New Delhi, Dec. 11: The petroleum ministry has informed its heavy industries counterpart that ONGC is not interested in taking over the ailing Bharat Pumps and Compressors.

 According to sources, the petroleum ministry has said there is no synergy between the two companies as ONGC accounts for only 5 per cent of the orders of Bharat Pumps and Compressors.

 While ONGC is an upstream oil exploration and production company, Bharat Pumps is an engineering firm. If a bigger public sector enterprise has to acquire it, Bharat Heavy Electricals, which is also an engineering company under the administrative control of the department of heavy industries, is better suited for the purpose, a senior petroleum ministry official said.

 Sources said the petroleum ministry has pointed out that even downstream oil companies such as Indian Oil Corporation and Bharat Petroleum pick up a larger share of the products of Allahabad-based Bharat Pumps.

 The petroleum ministry, however, has said the oil companies under its administrative control could otherwise help Bharat Pumps and Compressors recover by placing orders with the company and making advance payments to help the company meet its cash requirements.

 The ministry of heavy industries is keen to revive sick public sector companies under its charge. Acquisition by rich oil companies was seen as a viable route out of this impasse.

 The new ONGC management does not consider it prudent to take on a problem-ridden engineering company while it has decided to focus on its core area of exploration and production.

 ONGCs plans to take over Tide Water Oil have also been put into cold storage.

 Tide Water Oil did fit into the earlier diversified business model of ONGC as it intended to set up a network of petrol pumps backed by Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals. This retail chain would have enabled it to market Tide Waters Veedol brand of lubricants.

 Since ONGC has shelved its retail marketing plans, it does not make much sense to pursue the Tide Water proposal at this stage, a senior company official said.

 Oil industry officials feel it makes more business sense for downstream oil marketing companies Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum or Hindustan Petroleum to take over Tide Water Oil.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chidambaram: All ears

 New Delhi, Feb. 6: Anil Ambani today flew down to the capital to meet finance minister P. Chidambaram amid the fresh round of tussle with his elder brother Mukesh over the transfer of four Reliance group companies.

 Though North Block and Ambani officials remained tight-lipped about what transpired at the meeting, sources said the younger Ambani could have explained his side of the story on the quarrel between the two brothers. 

 Anil has accused Mukesh of deliberately delaying the transfer of shares of four Reliance group companies ? Reliance Energy Ventures Ltd, Reliance Capital Ventures Ltd, Reliance Natural Resources Ltd and Reliance Communications Ventures Ltd. 

 Apart from giving his version and explanation of the recent developments, sources said the younger Ambani was likely to sound out the finance minister on various proposals of his group that are pending with the government. 

 The high-level meeting between Chidambaram and the embattled Ambani took place even as his group sent a letter to Karvy Computershare Pvt Ltd, asking the share registrar to act only according to its order on all matters relating to the shares of four Reliance group companies that are to be transferred to the younger brother. This implies that indirectly the Anil group is putting pressure on Karvy not to take instructions from Mukeshs camp.

 Reliance Infocomm

 In a setback to Reliance Infocomm, the Supreme Court today asked the company to pay Rs 40 crore to state-owned Bharat Sanchar Nigam (BSNL) towards the levy on fixed wireless phone service as the same has been declared equivalent to limited mobile service by the telecom tribunal TDSAT. BSNL had raised a demand of Rs 160 crore on Reliance Infocomm of which the private operator had already paid Rs 10 crore.

 Essar Steel repays debt before date

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Steely resolve

 Mumbai, June 1: Essar Steel has come out of the corporate debt restructuring (CDR) net by repaying Rs 2,800 crore to its lenders ? a clutch of institutions and banks ? ahead of time.

 This repayment comes after the Ruia group flagship paid off a debt of Rs 927 crore to the Specified Undertaking of the Unit Trust of India (UTI). 

 Sources said while the CDR package approved by its lenders, led by IDBI, in October 2002 required the amount to be repaid in 12 years, the company has paid off the entire amount in four years.

 Essar Steel will enjoy a host of benefits from the repayment. 

 It will now have more freedom to invest. Earlier, any major investment proposal had to be first approved by the lenders. 

 The repayment will also bring down the average interest cost of the company to between 8 per cent and 9 per cent from 11.6 per cent and strengthen its bottomline.

 Essar Steel, like many other steel companies, had to take the CDR route at a time when the industry was in a bad patch. However, times have changed and many of them have not only turned around but have also performed well.

 Though Essar Steel officials refused to comment on individual proposals, sources said the company had been working on reducing its finance cost for some time.

 Essar Steel had planned to be out of the CDR net by March 2006. Of the original debt of Rs 2,800 crore, the company had already refinanced Rs 1,400 crore and made a prepayment of around Rs 400 crore. The remaining amount was repaid through a mix of internal accruals and refinance from banks.

 The Ruia group company, sources said, went through a rigorous programme to improve efficiency and productivity. It acquired Hy Grade Pellets Ltd, which operates a 4-million-tonne pellet plant at Visakhapatnam, and Steel Corporation of Gujarat Ltd, which operates a 1.2-million-tonne cold-rolling complex at Hazira. 

 With these acquisitions, Essar Steel has become an integrated steel plant.

 These acquisitions were financed out of equity and not through debt. The company is also expanding its capacity from 2.4 million tonnes to 4.6 million tonnes ? an exercise that is expected to be completed this year.

 The cost of this expansion will be around Rs 2,000 crore, which is substantially lower than a greenfield capacity of a similar nature. 

 These measures are aimed at making Essar Steel a low-cost producer.

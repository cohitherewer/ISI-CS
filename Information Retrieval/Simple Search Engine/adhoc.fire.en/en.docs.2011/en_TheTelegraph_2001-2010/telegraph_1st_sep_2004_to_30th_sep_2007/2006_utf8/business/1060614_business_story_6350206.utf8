 GMR flip-flop on Citi shares

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, June 13: The Hyderabad-based GMR Industries, which belongs to the Rs 2,500-crore GMR group, today told stock exchanges it had not allotted any share to Citi Group Venture Capital (CVC) International of Mauritius, five days after it announced it had allotted more than 37 lakh shares to Citi Group for Rs 260 apiece.

 Instead, it was group company GMR Infrastructure, which recently completed its third round of pre-IPO private equity placement, which sold 1.26 per cent of its equity to CVC for around Rs 100 crore.

 It is not known as to how this error took place. However, officials in GMR Industries confirmed it had issued a disclaimer to stock exchanges today. GMR Industries is not in the picture at all. We have not allotted any share to anybody, he said. He added that the earlier announcement was wrong.

 With reference to the earlier announcement regarding preferential allotment of equity shares, it is clarified that the company has not allotted any share to Citi Group, GMR Industries said today. 

 The company has reported an 85 per cent rise in net profit for the year ended March 31, 2006 on a lower turnover of Rs 267.9 crore. The lower topline was on account of phasing out of trading activities. The two major divisions of GMR Industries include sugar and metallurgy.

 GMR Industries is now betting on the sugar division. The optimism stems from the growth anticipated in the domestic market even as there are plans to tap the international market. 

 The company is planning a foray into agri-business and agri-infrastructure like dairy and bio-diesel. The sugar division now contributes close to Rs 150 crore to the companys bottomline, while the metallurgical segment brings in Rs 67 crore.

 In April, GMR Industries informed the Bombay Stock Exchange that its board, at a meeting held on April 26, approved the purchase of 50,000 shares of Bharat Sugar Mills Ltd (BSML). The shares would comprise 98.62 per cent of the total paid- up capital of BSML. BSML is a closely held public limited company.

 During the same month, the company also decided to downsize the activities of its international trading division. Recent reports say the company is now planning to enter the civil aviation segment, apart from shipping and container services.

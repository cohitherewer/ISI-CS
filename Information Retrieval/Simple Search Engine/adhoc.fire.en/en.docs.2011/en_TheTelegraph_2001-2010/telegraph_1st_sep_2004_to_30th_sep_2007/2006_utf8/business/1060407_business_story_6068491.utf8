 New Delhi, April 6: The World Trade Organization (WTO) today warned that India and other developing countries stand to lose much more than the developed nations if the ongoing trade talks fail.

 ?India has a huge stake at the trade negotiations... If the talks fail, India may be one of the victims,? WTO director-general Pascal Lamy said at a conference on ?WTO and the Doha Round: The Way Forward?. Lamy is striving to meet the April 30 deadline to finalise terms in agriculture and industrial tariffs.

 For India, both from trade and diplomatic perspective, Lamy said ?keeping and solidifying? the multilateral trading system will help the economy.

 He said it was important that all the member countries work towards a collective discipline by successfully completing the current Doha round of trade talks.

 The WTO members had agreed in Hong Kong to reach convergence on key numbers in three areas ? quantum of reduction of domestic subsidies in agriculture, quantum of reduction of tariffs on agricultural and industrial products ? by April 30, 2006.

 However, commerce minister Kamal Nath had a different approach to the issue. He reiterated that ?while no one could disagree with Lamy?s call for urgency in the negotiations, developed countries must recognise the character of the current negotiations for a fair solution?.

 Nath insisted that policy space must be an essential element of any modality for negotiations in the WTO talks and its final outcome.

 Stressing that protecting the interests of millions of farmers was important for India, the minister said, ?It remains central to our collective interests that the trade-distorting subsidies and protection provided by developed countries to their farm sectors are eliminated so that a level-playing field is established.? 

 Nath said in agriculture, for India as well as the developing countries in G-20 and G-33, effectiveness of instruments such as special products and special safeguard mechanisms was vital.

 Any formula would have to secure lower tariff reduction commitments for developing countries, which should be at least one-third of developed countries.

 Similarly, in non-agricultural market access, he stressed the principle of less than full reciprocity in reduction commitments for developing countries.

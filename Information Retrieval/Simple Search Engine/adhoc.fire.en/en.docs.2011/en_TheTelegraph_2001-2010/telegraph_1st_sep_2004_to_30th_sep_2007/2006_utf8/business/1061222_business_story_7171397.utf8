 Maruti exit to fetch govt Rs 2700 crore

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Moving out

 New Delhi, Dec. 21: The government today decided to exit Maruti Udyog by selling its 10.27 per cent residual stake that is valued at Rs 2,700 crore at current market price.

 Maruti, often described as the brand that India drives, would see the government offloading its remaining 2,96,79,689 shares (as on September 30, 2006) to public sector financial institutions, private sector banks and mutual funds.

 The cabinet committee on economic affairs approved the move to exit Maruti, which commands a dominant 50 per cent-plus share in the burgeoning car market.

 However, finance minister P. Chidambaram refused to specify when the shares would actually be sold.

 Significant money can be raised through the sale which can be this fiscal, may be next fiscal... Depends on the market condition. The call is mine, he said.

 Shares of Maruti, in which Suzuki holds the majority 54.2 per cent stake, opened at Rs 910.05 on the Bombay Stock Exchange and ended the day at Rs 926, up by Rs 3 over the previous close.

 SBI Caps and Kotak Mahindra Capital, who were appointed as advisers during the previous stake sale in January at a zero fee, would once again advise the government on the process.

 Asked if the proceeds would go to the National Investment Fund, Chidambaram said: Strictly no, as this is not a divestment of a public sector undertaking.

 As part of the stake sale process, the government will come out with a floor price over which bids would be invited. 

 In June 2003, the government sold a 27.5 per cent stake in Maruti to the public at a price of Rs 125 per share to garner Rs 993 crore.

 In January this year, the government again mopped up Rs 1,567 crore by selling another 8 per cent in Maruti to banks and financial institutions at an average price of Rs 678.24 share.

 With the capital market is in a bull phase, the government wants to ensure that it gets a substantial amount by selling the remaining 10.27 per cent stake as Marutis stock price has risen over 35 per cent since January.

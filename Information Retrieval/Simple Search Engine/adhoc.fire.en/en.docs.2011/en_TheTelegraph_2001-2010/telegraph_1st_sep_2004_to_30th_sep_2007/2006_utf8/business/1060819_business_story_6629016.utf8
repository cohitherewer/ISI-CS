 Lending leeway for PSU banks

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Aug. 18: The cabinet committee on economic affairs today approved the conversion of Rs 20,808 crore of bank recapitalisation bonds into tradeable special liquidity ratio (SLR) securities.

 This will increase the lending capacity of the PSU banks as these bonds were previously special securities and non-tradeable. A government spokesman said the decision will facilitate increased resources for lending to the productive sector in the light of the increasing credit needs of the economy.

 The government had provided Rs 28,808 crore to bail out nationalised banks such as Indian Bank, Uco Bank and the United Bank of India.

 Since these banks have regained their fitness, the government has permitted the trading of the special bonds to enable them to raise funds for lending. 

 Finance minister P. Chidambaram had announced the conversion in the budget.

 A government official said the plan was not to convert the entire stock in one go, but to do so in four tranches of Rs 5,000 crore per quarter.

Land swap

 The CCEA cleared a proposal to swap defence land with land of the Airports Authority of India (AAI), to give a fillip to the civil aviation sector. 

 Defence land measuring 19,471 acres in Goa and 2.32 acres in Port Blair will be exchanged with the civil aviation ministrys land of 5.41 acres at Santa Cruz, Mumbai, 3.678 acres at Porbandar and 2.32 acres at Port Blair.

 Parliamentary affairs minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi said the swap is free of cost. Since it is a mutual exchange of land between the defence ministry and the AAI, no financial implications are involved, he said.

Maize relief

 The CCEA also approved the release of 5 lakh million tonnes of maize for Rs 450 per quintal from the surplus stock of the government as poultry feed to farmers who suffered losses due to the bird flue scare.

 Maize constitutes as much as 80 per cent of the cost of poultry feed and the concession will reduce feed costs significantly, the spokesman said. 

Livestock sops

A special package for live stock and fisheries have 

also been approved for those districts in Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Kerala 

and Karnataka that have been hit by farmer suicides.

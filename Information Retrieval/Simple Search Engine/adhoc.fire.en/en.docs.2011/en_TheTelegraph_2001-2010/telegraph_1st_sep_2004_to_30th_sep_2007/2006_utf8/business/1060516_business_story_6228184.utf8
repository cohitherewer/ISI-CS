 Delhi court rejects IDBI plea

 Legal hurdle

 New Delhi, May 15 (PTI): The Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI) today suffered a setback with Delhi High Court rejecting its petition seeking a stay on a company law board order, which deferred allotment of shares by Haldia Petrochemicals to the bank and several other lending institutions.

 Justice Vikramajit Sen, while rejecting the petition, however, said it was inappropriate for him to express opinions on the merits of the case as it might affect the CLBs independent decision.

 In my opinion, it should be left to the CLB to pass such orders, as it considers expedient and just, and then enable any person who may come within the fold of those orders to assail it before the appellate authority, Sen said.

 The bench also chided the creditors for approaching the court after six-mandatory-months, which is the prescribed period for filing an appeal.

 The vehemence with which Haldia has supported the application before the CLB, as well as the present petition, becomes fatally relevant, because it could have filed an appeal but it failed to do so, Justice Sen said, adding that the CLB would pass the final orders in July.

 The HPL refinery, which was running on losses until last fiscal, has decided at an extraordinary general meeting to allot shares worth Rs 135 crore to IDBI under the corporate debt restructuring package.

 IDBI is a leading consortium of 52 financial institutions, which have lent around Rs 3,500 crore to HPL. This was disapproved by the Mauritius-based The Chatterjee Group (TCG) on the grounds that once the shares were allotted, the group would lose its control over the refinery.

 Later, TCG moved the company law board to restrain the allotment of shares or ownership rights to IDBI as decided by the management at the EGM.

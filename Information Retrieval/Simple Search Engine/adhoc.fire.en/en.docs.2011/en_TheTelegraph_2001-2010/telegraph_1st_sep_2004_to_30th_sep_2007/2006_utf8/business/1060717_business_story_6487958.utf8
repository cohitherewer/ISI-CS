 Samsonite bets big on retail 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Out of the box

 Calcutta, July 16: Samsonite South Asia Ltd is set to invest Rs 65 crore this fiscal in retail expansion across the country. It will also introduce the luxury brand ? Samsonite Black Label.

 The company has a market share of 68 per cent in the middle to premium segment.

 The company has also set up a second factory after Nasik at Umargaon in Gujarat with an investment of Rs 45 crore.

 We want to maintain the last three years CAGR of 35 to 40 per cent. We will focus on retail expansion and an aggressive entry into the luxury segment with the Samsonite Black Label brand, said Ramesh Tainwala, president of Samsonite South Asia.

 The domestic luggage market, including the unorganised sector, is worth Rs 1,500 crore. Of this, the premium segment comprises 30 per cent.

 The entry into the premium segment was the result of a study conducted by the Boston Consulting Group after the company reported a 35 per cent loss in business following the September 11 terror attacks in the US. The study reported that luxury brands would witness a never before spurt in sales as people would want to make up for the bad times.

 Samsonite has 132 large format stores ? Samsonite Travel World ? across 1.2 lakh sq ft retail space in India and plans to add another 38 in the next 15 months spread over around 1.7 lakh sq ft.

 There are two Black Label stores in Mumbai and one in Calcutta and the company plans to add 11 stores in the next six weeks in New Delhi, Bangalore, Chennai and Chandigarh.

 Black Label, which was started six months ago, comprises 2 to 3 per cent of the global turnover. In the next five years, it is set to contribute to one-third of the companys global turnover of $1.2 billion.

 The Nasik facility is the biggest manufacturing base globally.

 The factory functions as a design centre as well as a manufacturing unit with 95 per cent of the products being exported. It manufactures premium products and has now churned out a Black Label line.

 The IPR protection scenario in India is conducive for the industry unlike some other Asian countries. Therefore, the Nasik plant also serves as a competence centre to manufacture new international designs on a pilot basis, Tainwala said.

 While the Nasik plant has a capacity of 2 million pieces a year, the new plant should start making one million units in a year.

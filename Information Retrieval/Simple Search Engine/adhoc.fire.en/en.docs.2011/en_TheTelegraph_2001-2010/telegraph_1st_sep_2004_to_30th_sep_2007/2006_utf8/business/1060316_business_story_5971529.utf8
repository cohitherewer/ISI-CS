 Goldman Sachs beats forecast

 New York, March 15 (Reuters): Goldman Sachs Group Inc on Tuesday said quarterly profit surged 62 per cent, blasting past Wall Street expectations, on record revenue led by surprisingly strong results from trading stocks and bonds.

 The New York-based investment bank leads off what is expected to be another quarter of record results on Wall Street, again disproving analysts and investors who expected rising rates would slow down the firms global trading engine.

 Instead, Goldmans record trading revenue, accompanied by one of the busiest periods for mergers and acquisitions ever, resulted in record revenue and earnings, and its shares rose more than 6 per cent to touch an all-time high.

 They are in the right place at the right time, said Jim Russell, a portfolio manager at Fifth Third Asset Management in Cincinnati. There were a lot of good things in currencies, in commodities and many credit products.

 Goldman also has the greatest presence in non-US markets and those markets are growing exceptionally fast, he added.

 Goldman shares, up about 30 per cent in the past year, rose $8.70, or 6.2 per cent, to close at $149.42 on the New York Stock Exchange. Thats just 8 cents off its record high reached near the end of the session. The report bodes well for rivals Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc and Bear Stearns Cos, which are to report their quarterly results this week, and Morgan Stanley, which announces earnings next week. Lehman and Morgan shares were up about 2 per cent in afternoon trade.

 Goldman also announced it increased its quarterly dividend by 40 per cent to 35 cents a share.

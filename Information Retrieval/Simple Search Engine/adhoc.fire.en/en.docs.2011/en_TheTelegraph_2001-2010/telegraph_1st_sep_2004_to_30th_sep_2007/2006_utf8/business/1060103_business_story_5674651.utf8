 Panel to set Maruti offer band

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY 

 Ready for the run

 New Delhi, Jan. 2: A high- level inter-ministerial government group will set a price band for the sale of the governments 8 per cent stake in Maruti. 

 The price will be based on the average stock price of the last three months, senior officials said. The government will sell the stake to state-run financial institutions and banks through open bidding.

 The Maruti sale cannot be termed a true disinvestment as it involves one government holding buying governments shares in another. The stake sale is expected to be followed up by maiden offers in the two state-run airlines ? Indian Airlines and Air-India ? and by a public offering in Syndicate Bank.

 Suzuki Motor Corp holds 54.2 per cent in Maruti. The government sold a 25 per cent stake in Maruti through an initial public offering two years back. It retained an 18.2 per cent stake in the car-maker. The sale being planned now is expected to raise about Rs 1,000-1,500 crore. 

 The proceeds of the sale will be parked in the disinvestment fund, which will be spent to revive sick PSUs as well as on projects in education and healthcare. The Maruti stock is ruling at Rs 620-630. 

 Officials said the government wishes to retain the remaining 10 per cent stake for now as it is keen to retain a nominee on the Maruti board. The government wants to push the divestment programme forward as it realises it is short on money to fund its flagship projects. 

 Officials are banking on extra budgetary schemes like the divestment programme to earn money to fund basic education and healthcare bill.

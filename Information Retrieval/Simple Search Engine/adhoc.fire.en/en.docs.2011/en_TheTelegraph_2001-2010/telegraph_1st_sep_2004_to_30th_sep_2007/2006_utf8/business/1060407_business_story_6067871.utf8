 Tata Metaliks eyes south India 

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Calcutta, April 6: Tata Metaliks Ltd (TML), the largest pig iron manufacturer, is eyeing fresh acquisitions in south India.

 The Tata Steel subsidiary acquired a unit in Maharashtra earlier this year. However, it is open to more buyouts if the acquisition makes synergy with TMLs existing operations. The company has been looking for capacities in the west and south for a long time as they are two key markets for foundry grade pig iron. Both locations have many auto and auto ancillary units.

 Harsh K. Jha, managing director of Tata Metaliks, said: Even though we are busy in stabilising the new acquisition, we can buy more. While south could be the natural choice after having established its presence in the west, the company is not averse to another capacity in west too.

 Tata Metaliks had its unit at Kharagpur before taking over the Redi plant from the Stressed Assets Stabilisation Fund (SASF). The Kharagpur unit caters to the foundry industry in the east. The company will have total production capacity of close to 650,000 tonnes once the Redi unit goes full throttle.

 While Rs 115 crore was paid to SASF for the unit, TML will invest another Rs 35 crore to modernise the factory. Industry sources said TML was eyeing some target units. However, Jha declined to comment on this.

 Doubts over steel plant 

 TMLs plan to foray into steel making has come under cloud. TML had sought 300 acres contiguous to its unit at Kharagpur from the state government. West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation (WBIDC) was to acquire the land. WBIDC has managed to acquire only 60 acres till date. As a result, TMLs diversification plan is being delayed.

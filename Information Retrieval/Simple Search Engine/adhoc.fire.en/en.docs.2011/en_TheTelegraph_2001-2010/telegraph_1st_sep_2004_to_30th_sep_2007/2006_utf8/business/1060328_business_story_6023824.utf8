 Mathew takes over as LIC managing director

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 27: Thomas Mathew has become the new managing director of the Life Insurance Corporation (LIC).

 He replaces K. Sridhar, who retired in January. Mathew earlier managed LIC?s western zone. He also served as a director on the board of Corporation Bank.

 The 53-year old Mathew is a post-graduate in economics, graduate in law, holds a post-graduate diploma in management (marketing) and is also an associate of the Insurance Institute of India.

 His appointment has, however, raised questions as other contenders were supposedly senior to him, sources said.

 Others vying for the post were LIC?s Sudhin Roy Chowdhury, executive director-personnel (central office), Ashok Shah, zonal manager (north), and Tapash Chattopadhyay, zonal manager (south central).

 All the four contenders belong to the 10th batch of direct recruit officers. But based on the seniority level and ranking, Shah should have been selected for the post.

 Also, while Shah, Chattopadhyay and Chowdhury have four, five and six years respectively to retire, Mathew still has seven years of service. Sources said other senior candidates, who have a number of years to put in, are dissatisfied on the appointment of a junior officer.

 A few other names doing the rounds for the post were N. Mohan Raj, chief of LIC Mutual Fund, Hira Sadhak, director (management development centre), LIC, and Jid Prabhakara, zonal manager (south), LIC. Meanwhile, LIC chairman A.K. Shukla will retire next month.

 Two other LIC managing directors ? D.K. Mehrotra and T.S. Vijayan ? have already been interviewed for the post, but no decision has been taken yet. Industry sources said there are chances of roping in an outsider.

 Senior LIC directors said there was speculation that Shukla might get an extension since the two managing directors have long tenures.

 New Delhi, March 9: Toyota Kirloskar Motor will wipe out losses and book profits this year, said a senior company official.

 ?Our policy was to break even in the sixth year of operations ? we are on our way to do that. The company will register a net profit this year and wipe out all previous losses,? said K.K. Swamy, deputy managing director of Toyota Kirloskar Motor.

 Toyota Kirloskar Motor is an 89:11 joint venture between Toyota and Kirloskar Motor respectively. 

 Regarding the company?s plans to make a foray into the small-car segment, he said, ?We cannot give any timeframe, though we are bullish on small cars.?

 ?The basic decision is to make a car that customers want. We definitely need to address this (small car) particular segment,? Swamy added. 

 Toyota Kirloskar Motor, which has so far invested Rs 2,400 crore in India, expects to achieve a 37 per cent sales growth led by the Innova, its multi-utility vehicle. The company is aiming at selling 56000 cars this year against more than 40700 sold in 2005.

 Toyota Kirloskar Motor today rolled out its new premium sedan, the Camry, priced between Rs 19.8 lakh and Rs 21.4 lakh. The model is being simultaneously launched in the US. The Camry is Toyota?s flagship brand and is the largest selling car in the US.

 Talking about his sales target for this year, Swamy said the company expected to sell about 44000 Innova, 10000 Corolla, 1000 Camry and 250 Prado cars.

 At present, the company has a manufacturing capacity of 60000 cars at its plant in Bidadi in Karnataka. ?Our capacity utilisation is nearly 90 per cent,? he said. 

 While both the Corolla and the Innova are manufactured in India, the Camry and the Prado are imported as completely-built units.

 Toyota Kirloskar Motor, which also manufactures transmissions for Toyota, has sold 160000 units last year. ?We export them to the US, South Africa and few Asian countries. Till now, it has contributed Rs 400 crore to our revenues,? Swamy said.

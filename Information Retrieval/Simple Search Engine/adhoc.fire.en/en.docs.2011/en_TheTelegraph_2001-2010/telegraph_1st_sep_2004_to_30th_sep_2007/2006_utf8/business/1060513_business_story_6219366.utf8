 House panel in balancing act

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 12: The parliamentary standing committee on finance has asked the government to ensure that public sector banks are not at a disadvantage vis-?-vis the private banks over the issue of preference capital.

 There is a need to ensure that the regulatory aspects relating to the terms and conditions on the issue of preference shares by public sector banks were not in variance with or detrimental to the public sector banks vis-?-vis private banks, the committee said in its report on Banking Companies (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertakings) and Financial Institutions Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2005. 

 Parliament endorsed the bill, which enables public sector banks to meet capital adequacy requirements without infusing additional capital from the government or diluting the voting rights.

 Accounting of unclaimed dividends by banks will change, as these funds will now have to be transferred to a specially created account.

 Under the new system of accounting, proposed by the bill, dividends that are not claimed or encashed within six weeks will have to be parked by banks in a special account called the unpaid dividend account.

 The parked funds will be eventually transferred to the Investor Education and Protection Fund (IEPF), which was created in 2001 by amending the Companies Act, 1956.

 At present, only companies are required to transfer their unpaid dividends to the IEPF as mandated by Section 250 C of the Companies Act. 

 The IEPF ? set up in the wake of the stock market scam in 2001 ? is expected to create awareness among investors and enable them to take informed decisions before investing in companies.

 Banks are not required to do the same and unclaimed dividends remain in their books for a long time. 

 The proposed amendments stipulate that the unclaimed dividends will remain parked in the specially created account for a period of seven years.

 The committee also supported provisions in the bill to bring regulations on the supersession of boards of weak public sector banks on a par with weak private banks. 

 The bill seeks to empower the central government to appoint administrator for such weak banks who would be assisted by a committee of 3-4 persons to oversee the management of superseded banks for a maximum period of 12 months. 

 It also proposed a change in the financial reporting of banks by making it mandatory for them to include the accounts of their subsidiaries.

 Under the existing norms, there is no provision to include the accounts of subsidiaries of nationalised banks in the annual reports of the parent bank. 

 The bill has proposed to include a new section similar to section 212 of the Companies Act, 1956, in the Banking Companies (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertakings) Act, 1970/1980.

 This would make it mandatory for banks to attach details of their subsidiaries.

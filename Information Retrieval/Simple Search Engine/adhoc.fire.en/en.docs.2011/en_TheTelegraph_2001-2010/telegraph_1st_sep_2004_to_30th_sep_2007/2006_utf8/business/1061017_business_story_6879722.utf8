 New Delhi, Oct. 16: The government has set up an advisory group to chart a roadmap for public-private partnership (PPP) projects in the Eleventh Five-Year Plan period (2007-12).

 The panel, which will oversee effective and quick implementation of PPP projects in identified areas, will meet for the first time in the last week of this month, Union minister of railways Lalu Prasad said.

 He was addressing a conference jointly organised by Ficci and the ministry of railways.

 We want close coordination and liaison with the private sector for which the advisory group, comprising representatives of apex chambers and retired senior members of the railway board, will be consulted to take the PPP projects forward, the minister said.

 He outlined a number of possibilities for participation of the private sector in railway projects like modernisation of railway stations, setting up of agro product outlets at railway stations, construction of sidings and logistic parks, wagon manufacture, port connectivity and setting up of a dedicated freight corridor.

 The minister also said the container policy has been liberalised for participation of the private sector, which is investing about Rs 2,000 crore to make wagons and terminals.

 The Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) has also encouraged private participation. With surplus of more than Rs 13,000 crore, the railways are on a fast track and we wish to make Indian Railways one of the best in the world, he added.

 Meanwhile, regarding the success achieved by the railways, the minister said, I am against blanket privatisation of the railway system. However, the private sector was being encouraged to participate with the railways to develop its non-core activities.

 Railway Board chairman J.P. Batra said, We are looking for an investment of over Rs 3,00,000 crore by 2015 in a host of activities such as port connectivity, gauge conversion, dedicated freight corridors along with upgradation of feeder routes, asset renewal and augmentation of high density routes and increasing the manufacturing of rolling stock.

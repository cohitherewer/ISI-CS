 Calcutta bank twins await equity rejig

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 New Delhi, Oct. 9: The government plans to restructure the equity of two Calcutta-based banks United Bank of India and Uco Bank. 

 The UBI recast will leave it with a smaller capital base of Rs 400 crore against its present level of Rs 1,532.43 crore. The capital recast will involve the conversion of a large portion of the equity base into preference capital and extinguishing the rest.

 Similarly, the government wants to restructure the Rs 799-crore capital base of Calcutta-based Uco Bank.

 It will extinguish part of the 59.93 crore shares it holds which works out to 74.98 per cent of the equity base. 

 Analysts say this will bring down the share capital and increase the market value of the stock significantly. 

 On Monday, the Uco share closed at Rs 23.15 on the Bombay Stock Exchange. 

 Top North Block officials said the government had re-worked capital restructuring plans submitted by UBI and felt that it should convert a large portion of nearly Rs 600 crore into preference capital and extinguish about Rs 400 crore of equity through a one-time payment to the government.

 Officials said the bank had submitted restructuring plans to the ministry but these had to be re-worked in the light of recent experiences gained by the government in restructuring several PSU banks, including Indian Bank.

 This payment will be deferred till it is able to raise money through an initial public offering which could come after the capital restructuring, officials said. 

 The restructuring will help the bank increase the valuation of its shares and earn enough money not only to pay back the government for shares extinguished but also fund its business growth plans.

 The bank is also planning to come out with a Rs 300-crore perpetual bond issue which will act as additional capital and help shore up its capital adequacy ratio for the period between its capital restructuring and public offering. 

 UBI, which at one time had been identified as a weak bank, has now become one of the better performing PSU banks in the country. 

 In 2005-06, UBIs gross advances have registered a growth of 27.52 per cent year over year whereas its deposits have grown by 15.63 per cent. 

 Officials said Uco would be encouraged to come out with a follow-on public offering after its stock had restructured. Uco Bank has already raised Rs 450 crore through two bond issues. These issues helped the bank improve its capital adequacy ratio.

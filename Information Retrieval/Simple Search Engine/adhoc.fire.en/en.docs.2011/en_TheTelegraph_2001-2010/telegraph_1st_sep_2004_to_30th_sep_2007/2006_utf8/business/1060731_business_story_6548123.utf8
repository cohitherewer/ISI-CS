 General insurers offer cover for mistakes on the job, says Chandralekha Tulal

 Y our profession may have made you rich and famous, but beware! Your work could also expose you to scary claims if you happen to make mistakes on the job. 

 Well, you cannot insure fame, but insurers give you the option of insuring your fortune. Almost all general insurance companies offer a liability or indemnity insurance, which allows a professional to get cover against risks inherent in one?s job. 

 Who can opt for it? 

 ?The scope of such a policy is quite large and can be availed of by a range of professionals,? said M. Ramadoss, chairman and managing director of Oriental Insurance Company. 

 The insurance company offers the cover to lawyers, doctors, chartered accountants, architects, management consultants and other professionals, including their employees and partners. 

 According to industry experts, doctors are increasingly becoming aware of the risk of being sued and therefore, are opting for a liability cover. 

 ?In India, instances of blame and claim are not as common as in developed countries like the US and those in Europe. Most often, the long process of litigation discourages clients to even pursue claims,? said Uttara Vaid, national head, product development and marketing, Tata AIG General Insurance. 

 ?Though many professionals, including lawyers, solicitors, chartered accountants and architects, are getting themselves covered, the concentration still remains low. However, increasingly corporate houses with international exposure are taking such policies for their directors and executives,? said Vaid. 

 What are the risks covered? 

 The risks covered under such policies issued by most general insurers are restricted to acts of negligence or liability for errors and omissions. It covers all sums which the insured is legally liable to pay as damages to a third-party while rendering professional services, arising out of claims first made in writing against the insured during the policy period, including legal costs and expenses incurred. 

 However, some private insurers like Tata AIG, who mostly focus on corporate clients, offer quite a comprehensive cover under the ?directors and officers liability? insurance. The policy covers personal liability of directors and officers, including lawsuits for sexual harassment, discrimination, allegations and other employment practice violations, regulatory investigations and accounting irregularities.

 While public insurers exclude any criminal act or act committed in violation of any law or ordinance, the Tata AIG policy covers exposures relating to mergers and acquisitions, corporate governance requirements and compliance with various legal statutes. All claims for compensation have to be established in the court of law. 

 But keep this in mind, you need to be covered when a claim is made and not only for when the mistake is made. This can lead to problems if you plan to cancel your coverage when you retire, because somebody could still make a claim against you. 

 What are the premiums charged on such policies? 

 Public insurers have a rate card for such policies, but Tata AIG claims it sees each policy as a unique case and take up underwriting measures accordingly. ?Such policies are subject to numerous underwriting parameters and each case is customised. Thus, there is no standardised rate card of the amount of premium charged and cover provided,? Vaid said.

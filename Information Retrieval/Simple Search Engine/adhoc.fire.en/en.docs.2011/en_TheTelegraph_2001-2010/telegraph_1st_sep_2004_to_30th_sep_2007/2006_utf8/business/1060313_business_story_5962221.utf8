 Calcutta Port arm to post maiden profit

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Safe haven

 Calcutta, March 12: For the first time since its inception in 1977, Calcutta Dock System (CDS), the city arm of Calcutta Port, is going to report profit this fiscal.

 Buoyed by the rise in rent income from land, CDS will make a net surplus ? net profit in the ports parlance ? of Rs 50 crore, taking the total net surplus of the port to Rs 350 crore.

 Last year, CPT recorded a net surplus of Rs 184.57 crore.

 The turnaround would silence those critics who alleged that Calcutta was a drag on the two port systems with Haldia having to pay for the existence of the older arm. 

 CDS is likely to garner Rs 120 crore as land revenue during 2005-06 compared with Rs 55 crore last year. CDS had posted a deficit of Rs 47.73 crore in 2004-05.

 While income from operations has gone up, we have also been able to realise more from tenants without even increasing rents, said A.K. Chanda, CPT chairman.

 Calcutta Port is said to be the biggest landlord in the city with over 3,500 acres distributed for lease licence.

 The port has managed to improve billing, increase collection and recover old dues to raise the land revenue this year. 

 Chanda said the port has the ability to average Rs 200 crore a year from Calcutta alone.

 This year, Haldia Dock Complex raised about Rs 60 crore land revenue.

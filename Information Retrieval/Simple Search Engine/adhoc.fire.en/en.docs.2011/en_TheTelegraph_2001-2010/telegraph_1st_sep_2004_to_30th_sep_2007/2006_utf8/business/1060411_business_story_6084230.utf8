 BSNL bottomline takes a hit

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 10: Bharat Sanchar Nigam (BSNL) has reported a lower net profit in 2005-06, thanks to a reduction in access deficit charges (ADC) of private operators and lower reimbursement of licence fee from the government.

 The public sector telecom firm has earned a net profit of Rs 8,000 crore in 2005-06 compared with Rs 10,000 crore profit in the previous fiscal. 

 Disclosing the unaudited figures of the PSU for 2005-06, BSNL chairman-cum-managing director (CMD) A.K. Sinha said, BSNL earned a net profit of Rs 10,183 crore in 2004-05, but we expect to post a profit of around Rs 8,000 crore in 2005-06.

 Sinha said the ADC payout was less by about Rs 2,000 crore and re-imbursement of licence fee by Rs 1,600 crore in 2005-06. However, gross income increased 9 per cent to Rs 39,500 crore from over Rs 36,000 crore in the previous fiscal.

 Sinha said BSNL planned to add 10 million connections in 2006-07, of which 90 per cent will be wireless phones. Of the 10 million connections, one million will be in rural areas, he said. It also plans to have 6 lakh more broadband connections. The capital expenditure plan in this regard is estimated to be around Rs 17,000 crore.

 IPO shelved

 The company has dropped its plans for an initial public offering (IPO) in this fiscal on the advice of bankers.

 The government has been writing to us. We have taken advice from bankers and they have suggested that this is not an appropriate time to go for an IPO, said S.D. Saxena, director (finance) of BSNL.

 Through the IPO, BSNL wanted to pare down government equity by a small amount, as has been done by some other non-navratna public sector companies.

 Sinha said 18 telecom equipment and IT hardware manufacturers, including Nokia, Ericsson, Motorola, Cisco and HP, have tendered bids to provide equipment to instal 45.5 million GSM lines.

 Eighteen companies have bought tender documents. Virtually all the big players such as Siemens, Nortel, Nokia, Motorola, Huawei, Sun Micro Systems, HP and some other smaller companies are there, Sinha said. 

 The bids will be opened on May 10. Sinha said French equipment maker Alcatel, which has already bagged an order to provide equipment for 18 million lines through the reserved quota for ITI, would also be eligible to bid for rest of the zones. 

 BSNL would be adding 63 million lines but 30 per cent was reserved for public sector ITI. Alcatel is the indirect beneficiary of this move due to its tie-up with ITI.

 HP board split over fate of chairperson

 JAMES DORAN 

 New York, Sept. 11: The board of Hewlett Packard held an emergency meeting last night (Sunday) to decide the fate of Patricia Dunn, the chairperson, hours after a powerful former director called for her resignation.

 The meeting, which was held at about 4 pm California time by telephone conference, is thought to have involved all ten members of the computer makers board and came after Thomas Perkins, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist and former HP director, urged Dunn to step down.

 Sources said that there was a broad split emerging on the HP board with George Keyworth, a longstanding director, and at least one backer calling for Dunn to resign, while the clear majority appeared to support her continuing as non-executive chairperson.

 Perkins, who quit HP in protest after the company revealed that it had covertly monitored his phone calls during an investigation into boardroom leaks, said that it would be in the best interests of the company if Dunn left immediately.

 I acted not from any ill will toward Dunn but to protect the best interests of HP, Perkins said. I think the past months and days have shown that those interests are best served if Dunn would resign from the board.

 HP revealed last week that the company had hired a firm of investigators to look into the leak of sensitive boardroom information surrounding the resignation in 2005 of Carly Fiorina as chairperson and chief executive.

 The company revealed that the investigators, or a company hired by them, had obtained the telephone records of certain board members by deception as part of their inquiry.

 They engaged in a practice known as pretexting which involves pretending to be a customer of a phone company in order to obtain calling records.

 The internal investigation, the results of which were revealed at a board meeting in May, blamed Keyworth, who was asked to resign. Keyworth refused to step down but Perkins resigned in protest when he discovered that his phone records were among those that had been obtained by the investigators.

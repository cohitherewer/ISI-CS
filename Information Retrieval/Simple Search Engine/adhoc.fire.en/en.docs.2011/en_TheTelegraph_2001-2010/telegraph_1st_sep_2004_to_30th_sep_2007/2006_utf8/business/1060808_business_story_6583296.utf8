 Deora sticks to stand on Reliance gas

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Deora: Firm

 New Delhi, Aug. 7: Petroleum minister Murli Deora has ruled out a review of the governments decision to disallow Reliance Industries to sell natural gas from the eastern offshore KG basin to Anil Ambani-controlled Reliance Natural Resources Ltd at a cheap price.

 There will be no review of the decision. If we allow the price RIL has proposed, the government will suffer huge losses, the minister said.

 The petroleum ministry said the decision was in line with globally accepted business practices and there was no question of reviewing it.

 It is reiterated that the decision has also been guided by the governments firm commitment to follow transparent, stable and globally accepted business practices in an area where a level-playing field has been provided to all operators from India and abroad, a ministry statement said.

 Stating that the new exploration licensing policy (Nelp), under which RIL won the D-6 block, provided for freedom to market the gas in India, the ministry said, It would be inappropriate to think of decisions which are contrary to the provisions of legally enforceable contracts and may drive away investors from this area.

 Anil had termed as unfortunate and premature the rejection saying the decision should have been referred to an expert committee.

 Deora dismissed Anils criticism of the ministrys decision, saying, Dont we have any other job than to settle their (Ambanis) matters?

 Anil said the gas supply agreement between the two companies was arrived at in 2004, a claim disputed by RIL.

 Last month, the petroleum ministry rejected the price of $2.34 per million British thermal unit proposed by RIL for sale of natural gas to RNRL on the grounds that it would lead to massive losses to the exchequer. The rejection of the proposal has come as a major setback for Anils plans to set up an 8,000-mw gas-based power project at Dadri in Uttar Pradesh.

 The issue had assumed a political colour as Samajwadi party MP Amar Singh, who is considered close to Anil, had alleged that Deora had joined hands with elder brother Mukesh to stall the project in UP where Mulayam Singh is the chief minister.

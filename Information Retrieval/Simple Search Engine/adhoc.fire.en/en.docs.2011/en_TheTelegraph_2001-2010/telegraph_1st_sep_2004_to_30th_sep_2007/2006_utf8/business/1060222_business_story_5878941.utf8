 Labour, tax top IMF agenda

 Washington, Feb. 21 (PTI): Ahead of the budget, the International Monetary Fund today asked the Indian government to hasten tax and labour reforms, open up the economy and raise domestic fuel prices.

 Projecting a buoyant over 7.5 per cent growth for India during 2005-06, IMF, however, warned that without hastening reforms, the economy cannot move on to higher growth of 8-10 per cent.

 In its India country report, IMF advised government to raise domestic fuel prices in tandem with the global crude price movement but favoured targeted support for the poor.

 Warning that the combined fiscal deficit of the Centre and states could rise for the first time in four years to 7.75 per cent of GDP during 2005-06, IMF said large public debt remains a constraint on growth.

 IMF advocated acceleration of tax reforms and tighter spendings with better targeting of subsidies. Further opening up of the economy and tariff reduction would enable India to reach its full growth potential.

 With an acceleration in the reform process, India would be able to achieve sustained economic growth of 8-10 per cent, in line with the objectives of the authorities, IMF said.

 IMF, whose executive board concluded the customary Article-IV consultation with government officials, said the current favourable economic conditions provided good opportunity to speed up structural reforms.

 Inflation should rise from average 5.25 per cent in 2005-06 to 6.75 per cent in 2006-07, reflecting the expected upward adjustment in fuel prices, the IMF report said.

 The possibility of an acceleration in domestic demand supported by credit growth poses a key upside risk to growth and inflation, it said. A more rapid than expected rise in world interest rates, either because of a disorderly global rebalancing or inflationary pressure in the United States, would hit Indias exports.

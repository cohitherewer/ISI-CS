 Murthy stays chief mentor

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bangalore, July 12: Infosys chief mentor N.R. Narayana Murthy will continue as the non-executive chairman of the companys board and function as its chief mentor even after retiring on August 20. This was decided by the board which met recently.

 According to company rules, Murthy would have to retire on August 20 when he turns 60. The retirement rule was brought in by the company founders themselves, including Murthy. 

 In March 2002, Murthy handed over the reins to Nandan Nilekani and planned a new role for himself as the chief mentor. This arrangement was to expire on August 20.

 However, with the board decision, Murthy, who started Infosys 25 years ago, will be able to continue in the same position from August 21.

 Murthy was not present at the meeting where the decision was made public.

 The exact duties of the chief mentor in his second innings is anybodys guess. At this time, we do not really know, a company source said.

 The source, however, added that Murthy would more or less continue to do the things he did for the last four years.

 He travels 25 days a month. And he wants to pursue educating people, which takes up much of his time nowadays, the source said.

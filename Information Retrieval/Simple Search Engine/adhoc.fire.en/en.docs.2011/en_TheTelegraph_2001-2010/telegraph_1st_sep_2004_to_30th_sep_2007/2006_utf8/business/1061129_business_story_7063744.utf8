 ONGC move to rope in BG hits roadblock

 S.P.S. PANNU

 New Delhi, Nov. 24: The ONGC move to rope in British Gas as an exploration partner in three deep-sea blocks in the eastern offshore Krishna-Godavari basin has hit a roadblock as the petroleum ministry is not satisfied with the financial terms of the proposed agreement.

 Sources said the ministry wants British Gas to make a matching offer with the bids that have been made for the other KG basin blocks under the sixth round of the new exploration licensing policy (Nelp VI).

 The Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) has offered British Gas a 40 to 50 per cent stake in three deep-sea exploration blocks for which it expects the latter to pay $150 million upfront. ONGC is also willing to hand over the oil hunt operations in these blocks to British Gas. These blocks were awarded to ONGC in the earlier Nelp rounds.

 ONGC is keen to rope in BG to access the cutting-edge technology that it lacks for deep-sea exploration. ONGCs track record has been poor as it has failed to make a major discovery of oil or gas despite spending millions of dollars on exploration.

 It is being increasingly felt that smaller companies such as Cairn Energy and Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation that outsource operations are doing better.

 Of the eight exploration blocks for which ONGC signed contracts in the Nelp V round last year, it selected Cairn Energy as partner in five and ENI of Italy in one. ONGC decided to go solo only in the remaining two.

 However, ONGC has been successful in marking the vast hydrocarbon basins in the country. The data prepared by ONGC has ultimately led to the discovery of oil and gas fields in the country even by the private companies.

 The discovery by Reliance Industries and Niko Resources of Canada in the KG basin was made in a block that had been marked by ONGC through extensive gathering of geological data. The then government had decided to hand over the block to the private company despite the protests of the national oil giant.

 The fact that British Gas is willing to come in for the first time proves that India is now beginning to be seen as a country with a hydrocarbon potential and the credit for this goes to ONGC as well.

 ONGC has drilled three exploratory wells in the blocks and there are good indications of hydrocarbons.

 If British Gas steps in as a partner, it will also share the risk and expenditure to explore these large frontier blocks. This assumes importance as the costs involved in drilling operations and developing deep-sea fields are much higher than shallow water or onland blocks.

 Parekh: A breather

 Mumbai, Sept. 8: A Mumbai Court today granted bail to rogue trader Ketan Parekh and top mutual fund managers Sandip Sabharwal and Rajat Jain with respect to the chargesheet filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in the SBI Mutual Fund imbroglio.

 The bail amount for Sabharwal and Jain is Rs 50,000 each and for Parekh, it is Rs 1.5 lakh.

 The CBI had filed the chargesheet in the case arising from the huge loss that SBI Mutual suffered on the purchase of Padmini Technologies shares during the stock market scam of 2001.

 This was among the 10 stocks that had been allegedly manipulated by Parekh.

 SBI Mutual had purchased 22 lakh shares at Rs 165 each in February 2000 through off-market deals from Parekh-controlled firms.

 The deals were allegedly in violation of stipulated norms and left a gaping Rs 60 crore hole in the fund houses books when the stock price subsequently plunged 

 The chargesheet had named 33 accused which contains the names of other SBI mutual fund officials who formed part of the investment committee of the fund house when the share purchase decision was taken. 

 It includes the former managing director, Niamatullah, PPR Upadhyay, former executive vice-president and Ajay Bodke, ex-fund manager. 

 Sandip Sabharwal was the ex-chief of equity investments while Rajat Jain was the former chief investment officer with the mutual fund house. 

 Apart from Ketan Parekh and the 

 SBI officials, others named in the charge sheet are Vivek 

 Nagpal, managing director of Padmini Polymers, Panther Fincap 

 Management Services and Classic Credit, both Ketan Parekh-controlled 

 firms, Mahesh Malhotra, official at Padmini Polymer and 

 Rajesh Jodhi, company secretary, Padmini Polymers.

 Kalmar eyes deal with Reliance

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, June 14: Kalmar India, the local arm of Sweden-based Kalmar Industries, a global provider of container and industrial handling equipment, is in negotiations with Reliance Industries for a deal worth roughly Rs 50-60 crore for container handling equipment. 

 Reliance Industries is among the 14 players to enter the private container-train business.

 Speaking to The Telegraph, G. Vijay Kumar, managing director of Kalmar India, said, We are negotiating with Reliance to provide them our machines for handling their inland container business. We are at an initial stage of discussion and it will take some time before we finalise anything.

 The company manufactures heavy equipment like terminal tractors, reachstackers, forklifts, ship-to-shore cranes and so on. 

 The company has already signed a deal worth Rs 40 crore with Hind Terminals of MSC Group for 20 machines. 

 The Hind Terminals deal is our first deal with private players. It was signed a fortnight ago, he said on the sidelines of a conference to announce the launch of Kalmar India, which has been formed as a joint venture after Kalmar Industries picked up 51 per cent in Indlift, the agent for Kalmar products in India since 2000. Kalmar India is looking at starting a manufacturing plant in the country in the next three to four years.

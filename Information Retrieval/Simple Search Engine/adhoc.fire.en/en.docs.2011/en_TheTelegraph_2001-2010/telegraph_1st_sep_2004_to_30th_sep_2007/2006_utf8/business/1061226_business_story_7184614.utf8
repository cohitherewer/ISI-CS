 Tea fund mired in uncertainty

 Long wait

 Calcutta, Dec. 25: The replantation and rejuvenation plans of more than 340 tea companies have become uncertain as they will now get loans from the special purpose tea fund (SPTF) only after the cabinet approves it in the next session of Parliament.

 Speculation is also rife on whether the interest rates on loans would be attractive enough for the companies. The disbursement of the fund was supposed to start by November 1.

 A lot depends on the financial health of the companies that have applied for loans to ascertain the impact of the delay in disbursement. Many of these companies would have chalked out their replantation programmes factoring the loan component. This delay sets us back by another year in implementing this long-term programme to improve productivity that would help the industry regain its cost competitiveness in the export market, said Aditya Khaitan, managing director of McLeod Russel India.

 The proposal is awaiting cabinet approval. As the winter session of Parliament has come to a close, it is likely to be tabled only in the new year.

 We did not apply for the SPTF loan because the rate of interest was expected to be around 11 per cent and we can get credit at a cheaper rate. The SPTF loan with those kinds of rates is not feasible. Many large companies would have initiated their replantation programmes earlier to meet production deadlines, said Deepak Atal, managing director of Apeejay Tea Group.

 However, G. Boriah, tea development director of Tea Board, said the interest rate is likely to hover around 9.5 per cent 0.5 per cent more than the prevailing government securities rate.

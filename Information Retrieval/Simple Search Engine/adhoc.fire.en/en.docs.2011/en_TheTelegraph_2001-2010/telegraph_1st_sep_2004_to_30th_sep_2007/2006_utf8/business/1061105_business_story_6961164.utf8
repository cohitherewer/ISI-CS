 Berkshire profit rises to $2.6 bn

 New York, Nov. 4 (Reuters): Warren Buffetts Berkshire Hathaway Inc said on Friday its third-quarter profit nearly quintupled, as its insurance operations rebounded after paying out billions of dollars in hurricane claims a year earlier.

 Net income for the Omaha, Nebraska-based insurance and investment company rose to $2.77 billion, or $1,797 per Class A share, from $586 million, or $381, a year earlier.

 Excluding investment gains, profit rose to $2.6 billion, or $1,687 per share, from $189 million, or $123. Analysts polled by Reuters Estimates on average had forecast profit of $1,244 per share.

 Revenue rose 24 per cent to $25.36 billion, helped by growth at its reinsurance operations and its Geico Corp auto insurance unit.

 Expenses fell 6 per cent to $17.66 billion. Berkshire, like other companies with big insurance operations, suffered heavy losses from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita a year ago.

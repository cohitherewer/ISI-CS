 New Delhi, Jan. 5: Jagson Airlines, a short-haul carrier, plans to rent 19 Airbus planes for its nationwide operations, which include destinations like Calcutta, Delhi, Guwahati and Bangalore. The airline wishes to follow the low-cost model, but offer full services.

 Jagson will now fly as a national airline covering nine cities by the year-end with an inaugural flight between New Delhi and Bangalore in April or May, airline president and CEO Uttam Kumar Bose said.

 Bose said the airline would pump in Rs 1,500 crore over the next three years and expand operations to most of the major cities. Besides Bangalore, we will initially link up Delhi with Calcutta, Patna, Guwahati and Dibrugarh. We will also connect Bangalore with Goa, Mumbai and Jaipur, he said.

 Currently, Jagson operates on short routes to tourist hubs in Himachal Pradesh, Uttaranchal and Rajasthan. Bose said Jagson would follow the low-cost model and target existing economy-class travellers and frequent fliers of legacy airlines with premium service at competitive prices.

 After the government opened up the civil aviation sector for private investments, Jagson was the first to get its registration in 1992.

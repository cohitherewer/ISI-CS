 Reliance Retail debut in Sept

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 18: Reliance Retail will open its first store in Hyderabad next month. It is also in talks with global brands to introduce them in India.

 We will open our first store in Hyderabad in September a large store with food, vegetables and staples, said Raghu Pillai, president and chief executive (operations and strategy) of Reliance Retail, on the sidelines of the CII marketing summit. 

 We are in talks with different global brands and things will be finalised in the next six months, said Pillai.

 The retail firm has already drawn up big investment plans worth Rs 25,000 crore. The company also intends to list subsequently.

 Reliance, which is looking at partnerships, said, We are in talks with quite a few state governments and co-operative chains for alliances.

 The company has already signed agreements with the Bengal and Punjab governments for procurements and rollouts.

 Pillai, who refused to divulge details on the number of stores the company plans to open this year, said, We will go to other parts of the country as soon as we can.

 Besides rural markets, Reliance will gradually spread to urban areas.

 Pillai said the company will take out extra costs from the supply chain to offer products at competitive prices.

 As part of backward integration efforts to cut down costs, Reliance Retail is looking at partnering companies, including consumer durables, for direct procurements.

 On whether Reliance Retail was looking at sourcing from other countries, including China, Pillai said, Why not? If we get a better price, we will do that too.

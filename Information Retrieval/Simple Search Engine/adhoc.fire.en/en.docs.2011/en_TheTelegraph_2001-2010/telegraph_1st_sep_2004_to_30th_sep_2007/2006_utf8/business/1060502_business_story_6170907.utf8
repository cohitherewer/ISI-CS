 Bargain-basement discounts on top funds

 CHANDRALEKHA TULAL 

 Mumbai, May 1: In a heated market, there are still a few windows where an investor can buy units of some mutual funds at a discount. 

 A unit of Morgan Stanley Growth Fund is available at a discount of 17.43 per cent to its inherent value. 

 This means you have to pay that much less than its present net asset value to buy the units of this fund.

 You may wonder how this is possible. Morgan Stanley Growth Fund is a closed-ended fund whose current net asset value (NAV) is Rs 49.98. 

 However, the units of the mutual fund are traded on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) at Rs 42.56, a neat discount of 17.43 per cent. 

 Says Dhirendra Kumar of Value Research, It presents a wonderful risk management opportunity for an investor. Any equity fund investor today would be worried about where the markets would go from here. Only three things can happen ? either the markets would go down, or they would go up, or they would be range-bound and stay where they are. 

 However, if one takes advantage of this situation, an investor is likely to be better off in all the three situations. If the markets go down, the downside of your investment will be protected to an extent, and the loss to you will start only if the markets falls by more than 17 per cent, he said.

 On the other hand, if the markets go up or remain where they are, even then you have an advantage of 17 per cent to start with which is available to you as a result of buying the units cheaper, Kumar explained. 

 There is a rider however: it is an investment that you have to hold till February 2009 because it is only then that the fund will either be converted into open-ended or get redeemed and you will realise the NAV. 

 A similar situation exists with the exchange-traded Spilt Capital Fund Class A of Benchmark Mutual Fund. The units of this fund are trading at a discount of 27 per cent to its net asset value. While the NAV of the fund is Rs 120.02, the market price of the unit is Rs 94.55. 

 It is common for exchange-traded funds to trade at a premium or discount, however, such huge discount seems an anomaly, said Kumar. 

 Earlier, units of SpicE, the exchange-traded fund of Prudential ICICI, were suspended from trading as they were trading at a huge premium.

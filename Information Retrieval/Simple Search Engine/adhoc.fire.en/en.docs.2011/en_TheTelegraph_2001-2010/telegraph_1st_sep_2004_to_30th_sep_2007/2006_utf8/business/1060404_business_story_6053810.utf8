 New Delhi, April 3: India and US today signed a protocol on co-operation in the $950 million FutureGen project for building and operating the first coal-fired emission-free power plant. 

 India is expected to invest about $10 million over five years to be part of the project.

 The project is a public- private initiative, targeted at building a plant with 275 mw capacity.

 While the private sector will be pumping in $250 million, the rest will be provided by the US in partnership with foreign governments.

 India will become a full charter member in the government steering committee, monitoring the progress of FutureGen project.

 The committee will also supervise the mechanism to provide guidance, input and recommendations on the direction of the project. 

 The agreement was signed in the presence of Union power minister Sushil Kumar Shinde and Jeffery D. Jarret, who is the assistant secretary in the US department of energy. 

 India would also have access to reports and other project related information. The agreement provides for Indian scientists and engineers to visit the project facility and a royalty-free licence in all countries to translate, reproduce and distribute reports arising from cooperation under the agreement. 

 The project, which would also have the participation of Indian companies, is expected to be commissioned by 2012. 

 The US department of energy has entered into a cooperative agreement with a consortium led by the coal fired electric power industry and the coal production industry to execute this project.

 The selection of the site for the project, will be followed by selection for choosing equipment supplier and service vendors.

 Indias participation in the global project, has been justified on the grounds that the technology developed would be adaptable to variety of coals prevalent in the India and China, where most of the new coal based generation capacity is going to come from in future. 

 The coal available both, in India and China, have a much higher ash content and this poses a major problem. 

 The project is expected to provide a technological solution for a variety of coals including those with a high ash content.

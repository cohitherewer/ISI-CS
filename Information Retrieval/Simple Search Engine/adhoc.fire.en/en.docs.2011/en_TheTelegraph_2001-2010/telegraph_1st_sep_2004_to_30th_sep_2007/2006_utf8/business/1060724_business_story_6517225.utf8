 Exim Bank fans rural trade hope 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Looking forward

 Calcutta, July 23: The Export Import Bank of India is working with non-government organisations (NGOs) and self-help groups in rural areas to set up export linkages for growth at the grassroots level. 

 The products of our small and cottage industry have a huge demand abroad. But, the rural co-operatives cannot sell their products in developed markets without a Fair Trading Certificate. We are working towards providing more co-operatives with the certificate, Exim Bank chairman and managing director T.C. Venkat Subramanian said at the third banking conclave organised by the eastern regional council of Ficci.

 The Fair Trading Organisation has 24 European Union countries as members and covers 1,500 village and rural products. In India, only a co-operative from Kutch has this certification. The co-operative sells cotton products, said Subramanian. 

 But with this certification, we can make a lot of other products, such as honey, exportable. It has a lot of benefits. For example, a tribal co-operative in Andhra Pradesh sells honey for Rs 180 a kg, while co-operatives from Brazil are selling honey for Rs 480 a kg in a fair trading outlet in London, he added.

 The bank has also signed a memorandum of co-operation with NGOs such as DHAN (four states), Basix (Hyderabad) and Uravu (Kerala) to promote and market village products overseas. The bank has also taken initiatives to help marketing Madhubani paintings from north Bihar districts. For Madhubani paintings, we are looking at an e-commerce model, Subramanian said.

 The bank is also focusing on the small and medium enterprises.

 Mahindras to buy German forging firm

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Dec. 22: Mahindra amp; Mahindra (M amp;M) will acquire a 90.47 per cent stake in Schoneweiss amp; Co GmbH, a Germany-based forging company, for an undisclosed sum.

 This acquisition will be done through M amp;Ms subsidiaries, the company has informed the stock exchanges. However, it did not divulge further details.

 Schoneweiss is one of the top five global axle beam manufacturers and specialises in suspension, power train and engine parts.

 In September, M amp;M announced that it would acquire a 67.9 per cent stake in Jeco Holding AG, one of the top five forging companies in Germany, for an enterprise value of Rs 830 crore (140 million euro). 

 Jeco Holding caters to trucks, buses and trailers. Its products include gear boxes, engine and axle parts, hubs, gears and piston heads.

 Its customers include DaimlerChrysler Group, ZF Group, MAN Nutzfahrzeuge, Volvo, Linde, Renault, Agco, Kessler and Kolbenschmidt.

 Ninety per cent of shareholding in Jeco Holding AG is currently held by Scholz AG with the remaining 10 per cent held by the management.

 Sources said a major reason for the spate of buyouts in auto components was to cater to global markets. While the two German acquisitions are expected to help the company cater to clients in both Europe and the US, the buyout of DGP Hinoday Industries will help it focus on the domestic market.

 Last month, M amp;M announced the acquisition of DGP Hinoday Industries, a joint venture between DG Piramal Group and India Private Equity Fund Mauritius and Hitachi Metals, for an undisclosed amount. Hinoday is a market leader in casting and ferrites and it is the largest manufacturer of hard and soft ferrites in India.

 Last year, M amp;M bought Rajkot-based SAR Transmission. This was followed by the Amforge Chakan unit and Stokes Forging of the UK.

 Calcutta, Feb. 3: The Marine Products Export Development Authority (MPEDA) is planning to phase out traditional subsidies with a new restructured one that will promote seafood processing and provide other value additions.

 The MPEDA is awaiting the governments clearance on the proposal, said G. Mohan Kumar, chairman of the authority. The organisation, under the ministry of commerce, had a budget of about Rs 40-45 crore for subsidies.

 Although seafood exports have generated about Rs 7,000 crore business, the sector is yet to gain industry status, said Kiranmay Nanda, Bengal fisheries minister, at the inauguration of the 15th India International Seafood Show.

 This could be because seafood exports involve three departments ? commerce, agriculture and food processing ? often overlapping between the three, Nanda said.

 With Japan resuming imports of black tiger prawns from the state after disease control and eradication measures, the government is promoting this industry. It has set up a marine food park in Sankarpur, he added. Bengal is the first state to initiate and promote the cluster model for seafood processing through infrastructure sharing, which will be taken up by other states, Nanda said.

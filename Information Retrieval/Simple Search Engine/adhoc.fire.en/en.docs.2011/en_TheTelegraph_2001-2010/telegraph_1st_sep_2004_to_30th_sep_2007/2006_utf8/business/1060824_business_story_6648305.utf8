 DoT to go easy on verification

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 23: The department of telecommunications (DoT) is unlikely to get too tough on telecom players who have not properly verified the identity documents of their subscribers.

 Top DoT officials said a nominal fine may be imposed, but there is no intention to terminate the licences of operators. Even the fine would not be very heavy and was likely to be below Rs 10 crore. 

 The officials said an internal group would be set up to fix guidelines for verification, including penalty for non compliance, by the end of the month. 

 DoT, however, expects operators to adhere to the new guidelines and warned of tougher penalties if the norms are flouted.

 The officials said the abuse of verification procedures was from the haste shown in enlisting subscribers, enabling terror groups to access networks with false identities. 

 The size of the problem can be apprehended from communications minister Dayanidhi Marans statement in the Lok Sabha today. Maran said 40 per cent of pre-paid subscribers in places like Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad and Haryana have not fully complied with exact instructions on subscriber verification.

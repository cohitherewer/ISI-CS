 Checklist for taxpayers

 Subhash Lakhotia draws up an agenda before the financial year closes on March 31

 The current financial year is drawing to a close. A taxpayer needs to take care of a few important aspects before the year ends. By doing this, the taxpayer will be able to achieve an optimum level of tax planning with respect to income accrued during the financial year. 

 So, let?s start with a tax planning agenda for 2005-06. Remember that you need to wrap this up by March 31. 

 It may seem like a mad scurry to do all of this, but it?s well worth the effort. It will guarantee saving a certain portion of one?s tax outgo.

 First and foremost

 The first step is to make investments so as to achieve the maximum deduction permissible under section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961. Every individual as well as a Hindu undivided family (HUF) is allowed a deduction on investments or payments made according to the provisions of section 80C.

 If these payments are not made on or before March 31, one cannot claim tax deduction in this fiscal.

 Be on time

 To avoid any hassle from the income tax department, it is always better to ensure that one not only makes a payment or an investment in time but also sees that all payments are cleared from one?s bank account on or before March 31.

 The maximum amount that an individual or an HUF can claim deduction under section 80C is Rs 1 lakh. 

 This amount can be invested in life insurance, provident fund, PPF, NSC, NSS, ELSS, infrastructure bonds, repayment of housing loan, and payment of tuition fees for children. 

 All taxpayers must try to take full advantage of the investment limit to avail of the deduction and cut down their liabilities for the financial year, 2005-06.

 While investing, one should keep in mind that there are no sub-limits for different instruments. 

 However, one cannot invest more than Rs 70,000 in a PPF in a year. One may, however, contribute to the PPF account of one?s spouse over and above this limit and enjoy tax deduction.

 Pension plans

 Under section 80CCC of the Income Tax Act, 1961, investments in any pension plan are also eligible for deduction. However, the maximum deduction on such investments is limited to Rs 10,000. 

 If you have not yet paid your premium or bought a pension plan, you need to do so before March 31. 

 It may be noted that the deduction for pension plan contribution is included within the overall limit of Rs 1 lakh under section 80C.

 House proud

 If you have an income from a house property in 2005-06, do not forget to pay the house tax that is due on the property this month. 

 In case the property is given on rent, then while computing the income from the property during the year, the payment of the house tax will be allowed as a deduction provided it has actually been paid by the assessee. 

 Hence, pay the house tax before the month-end. 

 In advance

 All categories of taxpayers are required to make advance payment of income tax when the amount payable is Rs 5,000 or more. But if it is less than Rs 5,000, one is not required to pay the tax in advance. 

 Missed the bus?

 The last date for paying advance tax was March 15. If you have missed the bus, do try to pay the tax before March 31 so that a penal interest is not charged. 

 Remember that if an income has accrued to the assessee after the last day of advance tax, the person has to pay the advance income tax by March 31.

 So this week?s agenda should include payment of the advance tax if one has not yet made the claim. It may be noted that the penal interest is not allowed for deduction while computing taxable income. 

 Also remember to pay advance tax on interest income from your savings bank account, NSC and such other deposits because it is taxable following the withdrawal of section 80L benefits.

 Cash in hand

 All those who have adopted a cash system of accounting, it is time to make a quick assessment of their projected profit-and-loss account and pay the business liability, if any. 

 Taxpayers should remember that while computing the income from a business or profession, deduction is allowed only on those business expenses which have actually been incurred and paid. 

 Thus, any business expenditure that is not paid during financial year 2005-06 will not be allowed for deduction. 

 However, this principle does not apply to a businessman who has adopted the mercantile system of accounting. 

 If you are an individual, an HUF or a company, make sure that you deposit in the bank your cash in hand in excess of Rs 50,000. 

 This is important especially for payment of wealth tax. Under the wealth tax act, cash in hand in excess of Rs 50,000 at the end of an accounting year will be liable to tax. 

 This limit is applicable for individuals and HUFs. In case of corporate taxpayers, the cash in hand would be included in wealth tax but only so much of the amount which is not recorded in the books of accounts.

 A taxpayer is required to pay wealth tax, but only when the net taxable wealth exceeds Rs 15 lakh. The rate of wealth tax is 1 per cent per annum.

 Follow the check list and manage your tax affairs in a hassle-free way.

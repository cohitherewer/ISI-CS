 Buzz gets louder on spectrum auction

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 26: Senior officials connected with the group of ministers on spectrum feel that airwaves that carry voice and data signals should be auctioned just as FM radio licences were sold. Officials said as spectrum is a scarce resource, it would make sense to auction it instead of just allocating it. 

 Much of the spectrum is with the defence services, but the government has indicated that a part of it may be vacated soon and re-allocated to telecom companies. In all, defence services are expected to vacate 45 MHz of spectrum within this year.

 Officials said the government plans to release spectrum over a three-year timeframe and this would help telecom operators bring in new services like 3G.

 Private telecom operators, including Reliance and the Tatas, have long been lobbying for this. Actual release of a small chunk of spectrum could kick off as early as June this year, officials said.

 They pointed out that some time back Ratan Tata had offered to pay Rs 1,500 crore for a spectrum bandwidth. However, the communication ministry does not favour the auction route.

 Many of the telecom firms also do not favour the auction route. India is a price sensitive market, and auctioning of spectrum will unnecessarily result in higher prices, the brunt of which will go to end users, said T.V. Ramachandran, director-general of the Cellular Operators Association of India. Every player today needs spectrum so it is not something one should auction, he added. 

 As per the license agreement, as the subscriber level grows, additional spectrum should be provided.

 The communications minister has already indicated he will be meeting telecom companies soon to work out an appropriate route for allocating telecom spectrum. There is already a war of words between telecom firms which offer CDMA and GSM based mobile phones over spectrum allocation and meeting may instead of solving the problem actually lead to more open conflict between operators. 

 Indias 88.62 million strong telephone network, including mobile phones is one of the largest in the world. However, a low telephone penetration rate of about 8.20 phones per 100 person , means the country has still a lot of catching up to do to come to terms with the developed telecom markets of the west or even South East Asia.

 Operators accuse defence and police departments of squatting on large spectrum bands without using all of it. The government has been studying how much of it can be vacated and is likely to take a decision soon on the issue.

 Ethanol ride for cars from November

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Perfect blend

 New Delhi, Sept. 8: Public sector oil companies have started the process of procuring ethanol to meet the November 1 deadline to sell petrol blended with ethanol in all states. 

 However, the northeastern states, the Andaman and Nicobar islands, Lakshadweep and Jammu amp; Kashmir have been exempted from the scheme. 

 Oil companies now sell petrol blended with 5 per cent ethanol in states that produce the bulk of the sugarcane in the country. These states are Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Goa. The scheme flopped in Haryana as high local taxes made ethanol too expensive for blending.

 The success of the programme at the national level will depend on the availability of ethanol. The current scheme generated a mild response due to shortage of ethanol and sugarmills raising prices to unrealistic levels. 

 The states where the scheme exists have criticised the government for not giving sufficient attention to the programme. 

 Petroleum minister Murli Deora is keen to dispel this impression and has directed the oil companies to implement the programme seriously. 

 The government recently held a string of meetings with ethanol suppliers, sugar mills and oil marketing companies to make the programme a success.

 The Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA), negotiating for sugar mills, has assured the government that it now has the capability to supply sufficient quantities of ethanol.

 The petroleum ministry today said that Deora has told oil marketing companies to go in for early implementation of the ethanol blended petrol programme on a national scale.

 The oil companies will procure ethanol through bidding and has issued a notice to buy the same in different states. 

 Deora has recommended open bidding to ensure participation by all suppliers and transparent price discovery. He opposed direct purchase as this was non-transparent and could embroil the programme in a controversy. The petroleum ministry said oil companies have been given the freedom to protect their interests to arrive at the prices.

 The government was veering towards buying ethanol at a fixed rate from sugar mills to be arrived through negotiations with the ISMA. However, this got shelved as the mills were demanding Rs 27 for a litre of ethanol compared with Rs 18 previously. The government feels ethanol should be cheaper as it generates less energy than petrol.

 Oil marketing companies will have to procure almost 60 crore litres of ethanol for blending with petrol to promote green fuel in the country.

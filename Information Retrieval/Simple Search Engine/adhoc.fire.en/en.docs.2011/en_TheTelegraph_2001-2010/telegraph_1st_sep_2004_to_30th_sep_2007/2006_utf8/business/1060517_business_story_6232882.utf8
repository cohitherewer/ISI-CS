 BAA move to thwart $16-bn Ferrovial bid

 Flying high

 London, May 16 (Reuters): UK airports group BAA Plc held firm against a ?8.75-billion ($16.5-billion) bid from Spains Ferrovial on Tuesday, as airport shoppers and cost cuts helped it post a small rise in annual profits.

 The worlds largest airports operator offered its shareholders a higher dividend and forecast improving passenger growth this year, which traders and analysts said would be enough to keep shareholders on side in the tussle with Ferrovial.

 Investors are more interested in whether Ferrovial will increase its bid, which we believe is likely, and whether other bidders will emerge, which in our view is less certain, bokerage Cazenove said in a note to clients.

 The owner of Londons Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports said pre-tax profit before exceptional items for the year ended March 31 was ?620 million ($1.2 billion).

 This was broadly in line with an expected ?627 million, according to the average of six analysts polled by Reuters.

 The results are really of no importance, although the figures are fine. Its all to do with the Spanish bid and I get the sense that there is a growing uncertainty that it will be successful, a trader said.

 Chief executive Mike Clasper said passenger growth of 2 per cent for the year was lower than expected due to a strike by British Airways ground staff at Heathrow last summer while the July bombings in London affected travel. BAA expects this to rise to 3.5 per cent this year.

 However, passengers spent more money at its airports, particularly in the second half of the year, which the firm attributed to more aggressive promotion of its duty free and catering businesses.

 Airport charges were also rising, Clasper said.

 BAA said it was on track to achieve annual cost savings of ?45 million from 2008-09. It announced plans in November to cut 700 management and back office jobs.

 BAA last month rejected a takeover bid from a consortium led by Ferrovial. US investment bank Goldman Sachs has also made an informal approach to BAA.

 There is a lot of speculation but nothing is on the table, Clasper told reporters on a conference call, when asked about whether it had received other offers.

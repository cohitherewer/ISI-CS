 GE Ship demerger in limbo

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Aug. 2: The deadline for the demerger of GE Shipping Cos offshore services business expired today, the company informed stock exchanges. The demerger was delayed as Oil and Natural gas Corporation (ONGC) had insisted on a performance guarantee from GE Shipping for the services rendered by the demerged entity.

 There was a ray of hope for the demerger to sail through following reports last month that the oil major has withdrawn its objections. However, it is not yet known whether ONGC has issued any formal communication to GE Shipping.

 GE Shipping told bourses that the deadline stipulated under the scheme of demerger approved by Bombay High Court is at close of business hours on August 2.

 Last year, the board of GE Shipping approved the de-merger of its offshore services business into a separate company, Great Offshore Ltd. The offshore business consists of drilling services, marine logistics, marine construction and terminal services.

 As the deadline has expired, questions are raised about the future of GE Shippings services business. A spokesperson from GE Shipping was unavailable for comments despite repeated attempts.

 According to analysts, GE Shipping has two options, either extend the deadline or call off the demerger. 

 It is, however, largely expected that GE Shipping would extend the deadline.

 Earlier, GE Shipping said a contractual party (its customer) has sought a guarantee that the company would be responsible for the services of the demerged unit and for the execution and performance of the contract with that party. This condition was not accepted by GE Shipping. As contractual parties have to give their assent for a demerger, the whole process got delayed.

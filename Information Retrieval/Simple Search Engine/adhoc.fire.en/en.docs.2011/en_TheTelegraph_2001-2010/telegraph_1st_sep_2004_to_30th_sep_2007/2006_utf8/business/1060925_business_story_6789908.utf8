 Jewellers crank up the sales volume

 Absolute shine

 New Delhi, Sept. 24 (PTI): Trying to cash in on age-old sentiments that buying jewellery is auspicious during the festive season, the gems and jewellery industry is putting its act together and creating what it says enough noise for the metal.

 From organising roadshows to jewellery festivals, the industry is luring customers with free gifts, including diamonds, on higher purchases. 

 As gold prices remained unstable in the last few months, Indian customers held on to its purchases. However, the fall in gold prices, which coincided with the start of the festive and wedding season, will bring buyers back to the market, say industry players.

 Without making a forecast, Dharmesh Shah of World Gold Council, however, says, The prices should firm up. 

 There is need to create enough noise for the metal to get the message across, he says. 

 Gold prices fell after European Central Bank sold some of its stock on September 18. There is speculation that it may sell more on September 26. There may be some effect on the prices because of that. They are likely to firm up at around Rs 9,000 in the coming months, said Suresh Kumar of Om Sons Jewellers. 

 However, since the festive season has started, the fall in prices may not be much as the demand is also rising fast, he added.

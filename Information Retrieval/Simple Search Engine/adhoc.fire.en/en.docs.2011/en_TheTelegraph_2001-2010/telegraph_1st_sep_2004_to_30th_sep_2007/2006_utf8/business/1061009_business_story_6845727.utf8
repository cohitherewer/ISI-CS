 Paper over health risks

 Srikumar Bondyopadhyay explains the virtues of a family floater plan

The increasing incidence of lifestyle-related and other diseases, coupled with rising costs of medicine and treatment, has a significant impact on everyones savings and investments. 

 Like life insurance, medical insurance should also be considered as an important and integral part of ones personal finances. 

 But only 85 million people in the country, or 8.5 per cent of the population, hold health insurance in one form or the other. More surprisingly, only 10 million people are covered under health insurance schemes of public sector non-life companies, 800,000 are covered by schemes of private sector non-life companies and 2,30,000 by those of life insurance companies, both private and public. 

 Unlike life insurance, medical insurance should be bought for all members of the family, including children. A mediclaim cover for every member of the family ensures that care is neither delayed nor denied to whoever falls ill. 

 For more than one reason, it makes sense that you get an umbrella product covering every member of the family instead of getting individual health insurance policies. 

 A family floater plan costs less in terms of premium compared with individual mediclaim policies. For example, under ICICI Lombards 10K plan, you can get a medical insurance cover of Rs 2 lakh for four persons at an annual premium of Rs 10,000, provided the age of the eldest member is not more than 55 years. Now, if you want to buy mediclaim policies from the same insurer for each of the four members separately, the total premium cost to you would have been Rs 11,988. 

 Thus, by choosing a family floater plan rather than separate medical insurance policies for individual members, you can save about 20 per cent on the total premium cost. 

 A family floater plan is also more useful than individual mediclaim policies in the sense that the likelihood of anyone in a four-or five-member family falling ill in a year is more than that of a healthy, adult individual. 

 Most people dont buy a medical insurance policy because they think they are young and healthy and hence are less likely to fall ill. So, buying a health insurance policy and paying the premium every year is just a wastage of money. 

 True, but like life insurance, buying medical insurance at an early age has its benefits, too. If there is no claim made during a policy year, most insurers offer a 5 per cent bonus by increasing the sum assured on renewal of the policy in the succeeding year. The total increment can be up to 50 per cent of the basic sum assured. This means that if anyone buys a mediclaim at an early age, in the later years, one is likely to get a higher coverage. 

 Pre-existing diseases are not covered by most plans till the first two to three years of commencement of the policy. A family floater plan comes in handy if there are one or two elderly members in the family and no claim is made during the first two years. 

 At present, the maximum age at entry of a medical insurance plan offered by general insurance companies public or private has been kept at 55 years and it can be renewed up to 75 years. This particular practice precludes many families from including their senior citizen parents in the family floater plan. However, nuclear families with working couples would find such health insurance plans more useful than individual policies.

 A new window for buying cheaper medical insurance plans has recently been opened by banks which, in association with one or the other general insurers, are providing group medical insurance to their individual customers and their families. The premium cost of these medical insurance policies is quite low compared with the stand-alone family floater plans of the same insurance companies. 

 Since health costs rise sharply after a person reaches the wrong side of 50, providing for medical insurance in the twilight years of ones life is all the more important because income starts declining after retirement and insurance companies are also not willing to sell fresh medical covers after one attains the age of 60. 

 New India Assurance Company, a public sector insurance company, offers a life term health plan called Bhavishya Arogya where medical benefits are made available after retirement of the insured person. Therefore, by paying premium during the earning period, one can make a provision for medical insurance after retirement. 

 Anyone between 25 and 55 years can buy this plan for a sum assured between Rs 50,000 and Rs 5 lakh by paying equated annual premium or a single premium. The premium cost is also abysmally low: for a 30-year-old person, the single premium for a sum assured of Rs 2 lakh is Rs 2,876, while the annual premium is Rs 316. 

 Medical insurance can also be used as a tool to save tax. Annual premium payment up to Rs 10,000 can be claimed as deduction from ones annual income under section 80D of the Income Tax Act. Senior citizens can claim a maximum of Rs 15,000 every year. 

Even if you buy a family floater plan that includes 

your spouse, children and dependant parents, you can claim a tax deduction on 

the premium payment.

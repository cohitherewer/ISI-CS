 Calcutta, July 5: ICICI Bank will adopt the franchisee model to widen its reach in rural areas. This will be similar to its channel financing model for FMCG companies.

 The franchisee could be a local wholesaler who has a better knowledge of the people in the area, their risk profiles and credit worthiness. We would like to open 100 such outlets per district for credit delivery, ICICI Banks deputy managing director Nachiket Mor said at the third bank conclave organised by the eastern regional council of Ficci.

 ICICI Bank has tied up with a number of FMCG companies like Godrej Sara Lee to provide loans. Under the channel financing model, Sara Lee distributors are provided loans to buy the products of Godrej. The distributors can in turn help dealers get advances from ICICI Bank.

 The bank is also helping cattle farmers buy fodder under a similar arrangement with fodder manufacturing companies.

 We will also set up kiosks and other touch points so that there is at least one access point in every 5 km, Mor said. The bank has set up 8,000 touch points in 6,000 blocks.

 According to Mor, the bank will also set up rural ATMs ? low-cost and user-friendly automated teller machines ? that are being developed by IIT Chennai. 

 These ATMs will be able to lift old notes and have a more secured thumbprint operation system, he added. 

 The bank is also partnering with the postal department to expand its rural base. The bank has formed a rural, micro-banking and agri-business group (RMAG) for a focused approach, Mor said. Since the department of posts wants to be a one-stop financial shop, arrangements can be made with it for movement of funds, he added.

 Regarding changes in the banking sector, Mor said, The kind of restructuring seen in the industrial sector will happen to banks soon. Setting own house right will be the biggest challenge for the banks and the efficiency of the top management of banks to cope with this challenge will determine how they function in future.

 PC lists reasons for fiscal deficit surge

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Chidambaram: Points to ponder

 New Delhi, Sept. 29: During the first four months of the current fiscal, states had received Rs 11,737 crore more than last year as their share of taxes, non-plan grants and plan grants, which made the fiscal deficit shoot up, finance minister P. Chidambaram today said. 

 The minister said fiscal deficit had crossed 60 per cent of budgetary targets during the first five months of this fiscal.

 Chidambaram said states share in taxes alone was Rs 5,266 crore higher than last year. Many of these financial transfers seem to be front-loaded and devolution that had already taken place in the first part of the year will get adjusted in the last part of the year, he said.

 However, he added that the fiscal situation should be watched carefully. There are some concerns about the fiscal deficit and revenue deficit figures... I am confident, given the buoyancy in tax revenue, targets for fiscal and revenue deficits will be met for the current fiscal, Chidambaram said.

 The rate of growth of fiscal deficit slowed down a bit in August since it had already crossed 58 per cent by July, he said. We have to try to contain expenditure within the budgeted level, and for the same, every ministry/department is requested to make expenditure within the budgeted figure, Chidambaram said.

 He said there would be some unexpected expenditure, but it will be met through savings as long as it is within limits. The fiscal deficit would be contained at 3.8 per cent of GDP and revenue deficit at 2.1 per cent of GDP as projected in the budget, he added.

 The fiscal deficit touched Rs 90,678 crore during April-August, 2006, which accounted for 60.98 per cent of the budgetary target of Rs 1,48,686 crore for the whole year, he told reporters here.

 Revenue deficit stood at Rs 79,348 crore, which was 93.71 per cent of the target of Rs 84,727 crore for entire 2006-07, he said. On the price front, he admitted that the mismatch in the supply and demand of wheat and pulses was impacting the inflation rate and other than this, the price rise was moderating since the last two-three weeks.

 I must admit that there is some pressure on food prices. The impact of supply-demand mismatch in wheat and pulses continues to impact inflation index especially Consumer Price Index (CPI), the finance minister said. 

 He, however, said that the government would continue to take monetary and fiscal steps to keep inflation under control.

 He said steps taken by the government to increase supply of wheat, pulses and sugar have yielded results. 

 Chidambaram said inflation fell to 4.56 per cent for the week ended September 16 from 4.61 per cent in the previous week mainly due to lower prices of food items and industrial fuels. The wholesale price based inflation stood at 4.17 per cent during the correspondent week last year. 

 He also met RBI governor YV Reddy and discussed with him the various measures required to keep the rate of inflation below four per cent. 

 On reports that there are differences between RBI and the finance ministry over interest rate regime, Chidambaram said these are presumed differences and not real ones.

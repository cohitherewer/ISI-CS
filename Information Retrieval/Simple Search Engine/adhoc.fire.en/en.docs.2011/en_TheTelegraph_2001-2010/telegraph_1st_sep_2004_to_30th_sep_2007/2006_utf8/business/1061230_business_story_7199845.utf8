 TCS bets big on e-governance 

 SOHINI MOOKHERJEA

 Calcutta, Dec. 29: The global government industry group business of TCS expects to contribute as much as 10-12 per cent to the companys turnover by the next two-three years. 

 The company expects to capture a sizeable chunk of the $6 billion expenditure in e-governance initiatives planned by the central government in the next five years.

 The headcount of the division during this period will touch the five-figure mark from 1,500 now.

 The rate of growth has doubled in the last two years and is expected to be between 50 per cent and 60 per cent in the coming years.

 Tanmoy Chakraborty, vice-president and head - global government industry group, TCS, said the company is concentrating on India and has notched up a hit with the MCA21, the first e-governance project of the ministry of company affairs. The MCA21 allows firms to make their filings with the ministry of company affairs (MCA) through the Internet. The project was launched just a few months ago and the adaption rate among companies has been a fabulous 90 per cent, much above the target of 25 per cent which was for a full year, Chakraborty said.

 The department has now submitted an expression of interest (EoI) for a project of the Centre to IT-enable the environment and forest departments that is worth about $80-100 million.

 Gujarat has invited the department to implement a Rs 120-crore project and Andhra Pradesh, a Rs 50-crore project. 

 In Andhra Pradesh, the state government will offer 164 services through a portal. Similar projects on portals are also on the cards in Madhya Pradesh and Bihar.

 Considering that we have a strong presence in the city, we are very keen to work with the government of Bengal and have already responded to their proposal for the Rs 80 crore state wide area network. The decision is expected to be taken in the next month, Chakraborty added. 

 The company is also working on a Rs 15 crore, three-year project of the UKs Department for International Development (DFiD) to design end to end systems. 

 A system on value added tax (VAT) has also been implemented in 11 states including Gujarat, Rajasthan, the north eastern states and Bihar.

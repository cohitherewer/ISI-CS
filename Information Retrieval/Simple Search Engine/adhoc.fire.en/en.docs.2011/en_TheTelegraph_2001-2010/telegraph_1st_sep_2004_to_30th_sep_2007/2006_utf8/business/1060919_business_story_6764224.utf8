 US slump not to have wide impact 

 London, Sept. 18 (Reuters): A sharp slowdown in the US economy in 2007 is unlikely to drag the rest of the global economy down with it, Merrill Lynch economists said in a report. 

 The good news is that there are strong sources of growth outside the US that should prove resilient to a consumer-led US slowdown, Merrill said on Monday.

 US gross domestic product growth is expected to slow to 1.9 per cent next year from 3.4 per cent in 2006, but non-US growth is seen declining by only half a per cent, said Merrills global economics team.

 Behind this decoupling is higher non-US domestic demand, a rise in intra-regional trade and supportive macroeconomic policies in many of the worlds economies.

 Asia, Japan and India appear well-placed to decouple from the US, though Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore are more likely to be impacted, the report said. 

 Merrills comments came as the G7 said in Singapore that the worlds leading industrial countries were enjoying strong growth but faced the risk of inflationary expectations, tight energy markets and spreading protectionism.

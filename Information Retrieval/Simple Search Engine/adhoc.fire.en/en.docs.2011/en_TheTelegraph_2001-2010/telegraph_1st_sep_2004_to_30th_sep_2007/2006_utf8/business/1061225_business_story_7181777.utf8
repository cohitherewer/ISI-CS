The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Bid value unlikely to exceed $20bn

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Dec. 24: With battle lines almost drawn to gain control of Hutchison Essar (HEL), observers are curious about how far the contenders will go to buy the countrys fourth-largest cellular operator.

 Even with the current minimum valuation of $14 billion, it is largely felt that the bids are unlikely to exceed $19-20 billion.

 This view comes at a time when Hutch-Essar has received three bids from Reliance Communications (R-Com), Vodafone Group and Maxis Communications in the range of $16-18 billion. Officials of these companies, however, deny that they have put forward formal bids.

 While the picture is likely to become clearer this week, there are apprehensions about expensive valuations for Hutch-Essar. On Friday, Vodafone shares slid after the company formally announced it could put forward a bid. 

 The shares slumped on worries that the company might have to overpay to get a controlling stake in Hutch-Essar.

 Industry circles believe the real race could be between Vodafone and R-Com. Though the jury is still out on how far they will go, the consensus is it will be in the range of $19-20 billion.

 The players are unlikely to go beyond $20 billion, since with such an amount, it is not difficult to have a reasonably good footprint in the country. Players like R-Com will not be interested in Hutch if it seeks a valuation of more than $19 billion or there is a war that could stretch the bids beyond this level, as it can build a good GSM infrastructure with less money, an industry source said.

 At $16 billion, the enterprise value of Hutch-Essar by the bidders is far above what analysts had initially projected. 

 Based on various matrices, they had estimated the enterprise valuation to be in the range of $13-14 billion. Bharti Airtels enterprise valuation is said to be around $27 billion.

 Mumbai, April 7: Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena, the oldest bank in the world, today kicked off its India operations with the opening of a representative office here.

 The bank, founded in 1472 and headquartered in Italy, has launched this service as it wants to be a business partner for many Italian companies who are keen to have a presence in India. 

 Although the bank has not set any timeframe for elevating the representative office to a branch or a subsidiary, it is open to the idea of partnering with other domestic banks. 

 Briefing newspersons, Pier Luis Corgi, chairman of the bank, and Primo Brioni, who heads the international operations, said the bank would maintain a prudent approach in expanding its reach and presence in India. The plan is to advance step by step but steadily. 

 Brioni said in the first phase, the bank plans to add another representative office in New Delhi. 

 In the second phase, the bank will report to its board of directors about the Indian market. Only after this, the bank will venture into retail and corporate banking in India. It follows a similar strategy in China. 

 Asked whether the opening up of the representative office was a step towards acquiring a bank in India, Brioni said, The banks corporate strategy does not prevent from acquiring stakes abroad if it promises opportunity. However, if we decide to go for acquiring stakes, we dont buy minority stake. Its always a majority stake. 

 The year 2009 attracts us very much, he said. It is expected that by that time the Reserve Bank of India will allow foreign banks to take more than 5 per cent stake in domestic banks. Banca Monte also plans to tap the potential of asset management and insurance businesses. 

 According to the bank, Italian firms planning to have operations in India, can rely on it for developing their business here. However, the representative office cannot provide any banking service, it can only advise clients. Any financing will have to be done by the overseas branches.

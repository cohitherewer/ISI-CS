 ADB links reforms to double-digit growth

 New Delhi, March 10: The Asian Development Bank (ADB) today said India was in a position to clock an annual economic growth rate of 9-10 per cent, provided appropriate reforms are carried out in the infrastructure sector. 

 Eight per cent growth is sustainable in the coming five years or more. If infrastructure is improved and economic reforms are continued, the rate of growth can be accelerated to 9-10 per cent, ADB president Haruhiko Kuroda told reporters here. 

 Kuroda said the bank would raise its lending to India in the next few years. It was planning to raise about $400 million from the domestic bond market. 

 He said Asian Development Banks assistance to India will be about $2.25 billion in 2005-06, which will go up to $2.45 billion next financial year and further to $2.65 billion in 2007-08. 

 The bank will focus on three major sectors ? transport, power and water. 

 We will increase our support for the governments efforts to reinvigorate the agriculture sector, the ADB chief said. 

 Loans for developing the agri-business sector, strengthening commodity markets and rural finance institutions and improving water resources management would account for 13 per cent of the proposed programme over the next three years, he added. 

 The bank will soon take up a rural road project for Assam, Orissa and Bengal. For upgrading weak road networks, projects are planned for Uttaranchal, the Northeastern states, J amp;K and Jharkhand. 

 Kuroda cautioned India against the huge social and economic costs of ignoring the poverty-related education and health issues, which continue to show widening gender gaps and large urban-rural differences. 

 Given the current pace and pattern of growth, India will not reach many of the non-income millennium development goals for maternal mortality rates, infant mortality rates, or gender parity in secondary enrolment ratios with in the stipulated time, said Kuroda. 

 The ADB chief also expressed concern over the deceleration in agriculture growth from over 3 per cent a year between 1980 and the mid-1990s to a subsequent trend average of 1.9 per cent.

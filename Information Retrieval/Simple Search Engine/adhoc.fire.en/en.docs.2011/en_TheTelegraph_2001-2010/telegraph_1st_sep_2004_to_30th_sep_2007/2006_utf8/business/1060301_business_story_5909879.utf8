The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Taxpayers heave a sigh of relief

 GUEST COLUMN - SUBHASH LAKHOTIA

 For the first time in the last 

 one decade, this years budget proposals have nothing 

 particular about income tax, but still, by and large the 

 individual taxpayers appear to be happy and satisfied with 

 the tax proposals. The reason is that there are no proposals 

 to introduce the long talked about concept of EET. 

 Likewise, the inheritance tax 

 was out of the shelf and finally there was no provision 

 introduced in the budget to bring some extra tax on shopping 

 by the rich and the famous in the big malls. 

 The minimum alternate tax (MAT) 

 has been increased from 7.5 per cent at present to 10 per 

 cent. While calculating MAT, the long-term capital gain 

 on securities is calculated to arrive at the book profit. 

 This amendment means some extra tax outgo. 

 The securities transaction tax 

 (STT) on different types of share deals has also been raised 

 by 25 per cent of the existing tax schedule, but this will 

 not mean too much loss of money to the common man. 

 Now coming to the investment scenario 

 from the point of tax benefit to the individual taxpayer, 

 we find that the existing limit of deduction under section 

 80C has remained unaltered. What all has changed is just 

 the choice of investment instruments. 

 According to the amendment made 

 by the Finance Bill 2006, the investment in the pension 

 plan can be made up to Rs 1 lakh against the existing limit 

 of Rs 10,000. However, the combined limit for exemption 

 under section 80C as well as section 80CCC (pension) continues 

 to be Rs 1 lakh only.

 Similarly, the investment in five-year 

 fixed deposits with scheduled banks would qualify for a 

 tax deduction within the overall limit of Rs 1 lakh. 

 Substantial amendments have also 

 been made to the provisions relating to fringe benefit tax 

 (FBT). The genuine problem of the taxpayers has been solved 

 to some extent, but still the pinch of FBT would be felt 

 by the tax-paying public. 

 For the first time a new concept 

 has been proposed in the budget which speaks about filing 

 income tax return through income tax preparers, who could 

 even sign your income tax return. More details on this are 

 awaited. 

 The provisions relating to compulsory 

 filing of income tax return based on 1/6 economic indicators 

 have been completely done away with. 

 Not a single provision has been 

 introduced which would provide any relief to women taxpayers 

 and senior citizens. It was expected that in tune with the 

 Common Minimum Programme of the UPA government certain new 

 schemes to unearth black money would be coming in this years 

 budget. But there nothing has been proposed to tackle the 

 problem of black money.

 An amendment to section 43B has 

 been proposed on retrospective basis since the assessment 

 year 1989-90. This proposed amendment states that if interest 

 payable to a bank has been converted further into a loan 

 or a borrowing it shall not be deemed to have been actually 

 paid and thus this proposed amendment would result into 

 hardships to lakhs of business taxpayers in the country. 

 The old concepts of tax and investment 

 planning still continues to exist.

 Agreement on airport update

 New Delhi, April 4: The Airports Authority of India (AAI) today signed the agreements to hand over Delhi and Mumbai airports to joint venture companies led by GMR-Fraport and GVK-South Africa Airport, respectively.

 The operations, maintenance and development agreement and the shareholders pact were signed by AAI chairman K. Ramalingam and director finance V. D. V. Prasada Rao in the presence of civil aviation minister Praful Patel and secretary Ajay Prasad.

 The agreements have been signed. The joint venture companies are in place and their boards are meeting today, Patel told journalists.

 The operations, maintenance and development agreement specifies the work to be undertaken by the private partners at the two airports in the areas of maintenance, development, design, construction and management.

 The government has already issued letters of intent to the two consortia. Both GMR-Fraport and GVK-South Africa Airport have given bond guarantees of Rs 500 crore each in February.

 GMR-Fraport and GVK-South Africa Airport will now form joint venture companies with the Airports Authority of India (AAI). 

 AAI, which is owned by the government, will hold 26 per cent equity in the joint venture, while the private partner will have a 74 per cent share. 

 Both the winning consortia have an Indian and a foreign element. For instance, while GMR is a south India-based company, it has a tie-up with Fraport, which runs the Frankfurt airport. Similarly, GVK is the Indian partner for South Africa Airport. 

 GMR will give the government 45.99 per cent of the revenue earned every year from operating the Delhi airport, while GVK will part with 38.7 per cent of the revenue earned from Mumbai airport.

 The first phase of modernisation, to be completed by 2010, will cost Rs 2,800 crore in the case of Delhi airport and Rs 2,400 crore for Mumbai. 

 Patel allayed fears of retrenchment at AAI. Every single employee will be absorbed either by the joint venture or the AAI. There will be no job loss, he said.

Left ire

 The CPM has criticised the deal as a breach of agreement between the government and the airport employees. In a statement the party politburo said: The deal is a clear breach of the governments commitment that all issues will be discussed at a tripartite forum of the government, Airports Authority of India and employees. 

 The party said it strongly disapproved of the deal which violated the UPA governments common minimum programme (CMP).

 Bunge bets on edible oils

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 21: Bunge India, which owns the Dalda brand of vanaspati, will leverage the brand to market all varieties of edible oils, including ghee and margarine.

 The company today launched the Dalda brand of refined soyabean and mustard oil in the eastern region. 

 It plans to introduce coconut and groundnut oil in the southern region soon.

 The New York-based $25-billion Bunge Limited had bought over the edible oils and fat business from Hindustan Lever Ltd (HLL) in 2003. 

 The companys new strategy includes re-launch of the mother brand, Dalda, roll out other packaged edible oils and extend the portfolio to ghee and margarine, managing director Adhiraj Sarin said.

 Sarin said the company is hoping to gross Rs 1,200 sales in the current year against Rs 850 crore last year.

 The vanaspati market, according to Sarin, had remained stagnant at around 1.5 million tonnes while the overall edible oil consump-tion was growing at 4.5 per cent. The current consumption base is 12.5 million tonnes, he added.

 Sarin said the company aimed at increasing its market share in vanaspati and soyabean oil to 25 per cent each by 2010 and 2011 respectively.

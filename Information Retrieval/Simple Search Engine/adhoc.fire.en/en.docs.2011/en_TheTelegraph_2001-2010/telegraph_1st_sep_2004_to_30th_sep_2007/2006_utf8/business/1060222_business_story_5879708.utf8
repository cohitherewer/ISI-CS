The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Handset rates slashed

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Feb. 21: Reliance Infocomm has reduced the prices of CDMA handsets by 40 per cent for black and white sets and 15 per cent for colour models. The move is expected to bring about a considerable increase in market share as the entry-level barriers are lowered. 

 Reliance will offer the black and white LG 2340 handset at Rs 1,500, down from Rs 2,500. The overall reduction in this segment will range between 15 and 40 per cent. 

 The price of colour handset LG 5340, which is currently available for Rs 4,500, has been slashed to Rs 3,800 and would favourably impact price-sensitive consumers, sources said.

 This offer, coupled with the earlier IndiaOne scheme, will provide a new dimension to market penetration. 

 The black and white CDMA handset is among the top-three higher selling models. The company will be importing around 20 million CDMA handsets for 2006.

 Reliance has been adding over one million subscribers every month in December and January.

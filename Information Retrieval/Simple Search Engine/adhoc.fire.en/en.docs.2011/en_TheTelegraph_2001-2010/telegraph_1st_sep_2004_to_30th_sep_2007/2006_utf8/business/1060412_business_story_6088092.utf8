 IMF warns against leveraged buyouts

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, April 11: The leveraged buyout (LBO) is back with a bang ? and the aggressive reliance on LBOs to acquire companies threatens to undermine the credit quality of the firms that are bought out, says the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in its latest Global Financial Stability Report released today.

 Leveraged buyouts facilitated by a significant increase in LBO loans in the United States and Europe could significantly weaken the credit quality of the acquired company, says the report.

 The LBO was all the rage in the mid-eighties and facilitated a number of management buyouts and the subsequent carve-up of several large corporations. It received a lot of criticism because it enables the acquirers to strip assets and raise cash without committing a great deal of money upfront.

 Some of those sharp practices seem to be returning. Recently, acquirers (usually private equity funds and, increasingly, hedge funds) have adopted the practice of significantly leveraging the balancesheets of the companies they have just acquired so as to pay high dividends to themselves right away. This is in contrast with the past practices according to which acquirers spent about five years ?. improving the profitability of the acquired company before doing an initial public offering (IPO) or a trade sale to realise their investments, the IMF said.

 The IMF warned that such an aggressive LBO style ? in terms of both leveraging and a shorter time frame ? could lead to a sharp deterioration of the credit quality of the acquired companies leading to multiple notch downgrading by the rating agencies.

 As private equity funds have been able to attract large amounts of money in the past year or two, and as they have reportedly increased the degree of leverage (from 3-4 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation to 6-8 times), they have the financial resources to target a much wider range of companies.

 The IMF said LBO debt raised in 2004-05 in the US market amounted to $200 billion, or 5 per cent of the total corporate debt outstanding. Despite strong balancesheets for the corporate sector as a whole, this is one reason for the rise in idiosyncratic risk, the report said.

 Specific industries that are burdened by overcapacity ? such as the automobile and airline industries ? are expected to continue to shrink and cause specific companies to suffer deterioration along the way, the IMF warns. 

 Companies that ?neglected to improve their finances could be exposed to pressure as cyclical conditions become less favourable, says the report.

 The IMF said the turning of the credit cycle could bring about an increase in idiosyncratic risk though against the backdrop of still-healthy balancesheets of the corporate sector. It said the most likely repercussion of this development would be a widening of the credit spreads for specific firms.

 If such a company-specific deterioration in credit quality were to affect a very large name in the fast-growing market for credit derivatives and structured credit, there is a possibility that this could upset some of the complex correlations on which investment positions in these markets are predicated, the report said.

 This could trigger a major disaster. A sudden drying up of liquidity as a result of unexpected price dislocations could ?lead to large-scale redemptions for hedge funds active in this area. As a potential next step in such a chain reaction, hedge funds could feel under pressure to liquidate other assets ? in other words start a contagion process, the report said.

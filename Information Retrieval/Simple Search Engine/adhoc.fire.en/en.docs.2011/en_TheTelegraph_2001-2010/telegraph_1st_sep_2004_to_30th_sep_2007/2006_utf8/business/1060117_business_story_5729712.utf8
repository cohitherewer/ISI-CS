 ONGC eyes Shell tech to raise output

 S.P.S. PANNU 

 ON RECOVERY PATH 

 New Delhi, Jan. 16: ONGC plans to approach Shell for the latest technology to increase recovery from its fields.

 Shell is a global leader in technologies used to increase oil recovery and ONGC wants to tap this knowledge to raise output from existing fields as well as enhance in-place reserves.

 An agreement is likely to be signed this week, a senior ONGC official told The Telegraph. 

 The ONGC management feels the company should tie up with global experts to bridge the technological gap. 

 The technology available with Shell is expected to increase the rate of flow of oil from existing wells and also improve the recovery factor. At present, domestic oil companies are, on an average, able to recover only 28 per cent of the in-place reserves of oil. The world average is 32 per cent. 

 ?High international prices of oil and the increasing age of ONGC fields has made it necessary to go in for new techniques to recover more oil,? a senior company official said.

 ONGC has set a target of 40 per cent oil recovery by 2020 and wants to access the latest technology to achieve this goal.

 ONGC is under pressure from the petroleum ministry to step up oil production and there was a major tussle over the target to be set for this year.

 The company was upset that the ministry had set an unrealistic target of 35 million tonnes. A special task force also agreed with the ONGC management that the domestic output for crude could not be raised to such a high level as it would lead to a flogging of the wells.

 The ministry has now reconciled to the fact that ONGC would fix the new target for domestic crude and gas production. ONGC chairman Subir Raha has said a new estimate of 27.8 million tonnes would be fixed for the current year. 

 ONGC also plans to form joint ventures with foreign companies to benefit from their knowledge of the latest technology. ONGC bagged seven blocks in the fifth round under the new exploration licensing policy (Nelp V). Of these, four are in partnership with Cairn Energy of the UK.

 The high success rate the UK company has achieved in striking oil and gas in India has prompted ONGC to make this move. Similarly, it has also gone in for a partnership with ENI of Italy in one of the blocks. 

 ONGC had also formed a joint venture with British Gas for two deep-sea blocks off the eastern coast.

 Hong Kong, May 24 (Reuters): Bank of China, the countrys second-biggest lender, raised $9.7 billion after pricing its initial public offering near the top of its indicated range in the worlds sixth-largest IPO.

 The offering, which was heavily oversubscribed as investors scrambled to tap Chinas surging economic growth, will rise to fourth in the all-time IPO rankings if, as expected, Bank of China exercises an overallotment option that will expand the deal to $11.1 billion.

 The state-run banks share sale tops the $9.2 billion raised last October by rival China Construction Bank to be the nations largest, and was the most heavily-subscribed Hong Kong IPO ever despite a recent selloff in emerging markets.

 Its pretty much a no-brainer in that most institutions see it as a stock they have to own, and the brand name drives a lot of the non-institutional demand, like corporate, wealth management, and retail, UBS Managing Director David Chin told Reuters by phone from New York.

 Bank of China, whose IPO is the worlds largest by a financial institution, will use proceeds from the deal to build its capital base and expand its business.

 China is listing its big lenders as it struggles to whip the long-ailing banking industry into shape before the sector opens further to foreign competition at the end of this year under Beijings World Trade Organisation (WTO) commitments.

 The deal values Beijing-based Bank of China at $92.4 billion, ranking it tenth among banks in the world, just ahead of Spains Santander and just behind Mizuho Financial Group of Japan.

 Investors crowded into the IPO to access Chinas consumer lending boom as members of the fast-growing middle class buy cars and homes and carry credit cards for the first time. Investors also hope the countrys banking sector is managing to put the legacy of decades of state-directed lending behind it.

 Bank of China sold nearly 25.57 billion shares ? or 10.5 per cent of its enlarged share capital ? at HK$2.95 each, compared with its indicated range of HK$2.50-HK$3.00 per share, underwriters Goldman Sachs and UBS said.

 The warm investor reception to Bank of China, despite choppy markets, paves the way for the IPO later this year of the countrys biggest lender, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, which aims to raise roughly $12 billion.

 Another state-run lender, China Merchants Bank, plans to raise about $2 billion in a Hong Kong listing this year.

 Bank of China opted to price its deal below the top of the range after the recent selloff in global emerging markets.

 Tata priority to power, ferro chrome

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Power play

 Calcutta, April 11: Tata Steel will invest Rs 350 crore to double its ferro chrome capacity and set up a captive power plant.

 The development comes close on the heels of the South Africa project, which received an environmental clearance last month.

 The company is the largest player in the domestic ferro chrome industry with a capacity of 120,000 tonnes.

 Priyadarshan Roy, executive in charge of ferro alloys and minerals division, said the company will increase production by another 50,000 tonnes by investing about Rs 100 crore.

 It now produces 50,000 tonnes on its own and the rest is outsourced from various units.

 We are adding another 50,000 tonnes to the existing capacity at the Bamnipal facility in Sukinda valley of Orissa, Roy added.

 The company has started placing key orders for the work and it is expected to be completed by 2007.

 Tata Steel is also setting up a coal-based captive thermal power plant of 60 megawatt. This would call for another investment of Rs 250 crore.

 Power is the principal raw material for ferro chrome, contributing around 45 per cent of the cost.

 Power tariff is only going up in India. The captive unit will reduce that burden, Roy said.

 Compared with Rs 2.45 per unit that it pays, the captive unit will provide at Rs 1.90 per unit. In contrast, power is available at less than Re 1 in South Africa, which asked the Tatas to venture into that country.

 The Tata group, led by Tata Steel, will invest $100-110 million for a 120,000-tonne capacity ferro chrome unit.

 South Africa produces 60 per cent of worlds capacity.

 The project is being developed through Tata Steel KZN Pty Ltd. Indian production stands at 550,000 tonnes and half of it is exported.

 This project will give us presence in two continents. It will also give us more confidence to serve long-term contracts, Roy said.

 The ferro chrome price now stands at Rs 33,000 a tonne. It has gone up at the beginning of the year as some of the capacities have closed down because of maintenance works.

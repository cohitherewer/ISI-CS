 Business Briefs

 New Delhi, Dec. 3: Industry chamber 

 CII today asked the government to rationalise all customs 

 duties to the peak rate of 12.5 per cent. CII, in its pre-budget 

 memorandum to the finance ministry, has said that several 

 product categories continue to attract significantly high 

 duty rates, ranging from 15 per cent to 150 per cent despite 

 the peak rate reaching 12.5 per cent since March 2006. Peak 

 rate is the most commonly used rate of customs duty.

 New Delhi, Dec. 3: Major car makers, 

 including Hyundai, Honda, Toyota and GM have sought extension

 Iberdrola to buy Scottish Power

 Buy mode

 Madrid/London, Nov. 28 (Reuters): Spains Iberdrola is to buy Scottish Power for an agreed 11.6 billion ($22.5 billion) in cash and shares to create Europes third-biggest utility and a world leader in renewable energy. 

 Iberdrola, Spains second-largest utility, said on Tuesday it would pay 400 pence in cash and 0.1646 new shares for each Scottish Power share, worth a total of 777p a share at Mondays close. The price includes Scottish Powers 12p special dividend. 

 The price is slightly below that expected by some analysts, and at 1015 GMT Scottish Power shares were down 0.3 per cent at 744p. Iberdrola shares were down 2.3 per cent at 32.00 euros, while the DJ Stoxx European utilities index was little changed. 

 Recent rumours had suggested the bid could be for as much as 12 billion, or around 800 pence a share, so the fact that the actual figure falls short will ... prove frustrating to investors, spread-betters GFT Global Markets said in a note. 

 Some analysts said the deal could leave room for a rival bid as Scottish Power investors might be prepared to accept a lower offer if it is all in cash. Germanys RWE and Swedens Waterfall have been tipped as possible rival suitors. 

 But Hexane BNP analyst Jose Javier Ruiz Fernandez said Iberdrola was paying a price broadly in line with recent sector deals and saw little room for a counter-offer. 

 I think it is a good move (by Iberdrola), he said. Theyre paying the sector average, its slightly value creative and a new platform of growth, especially in renewable. 

 Ruiz Fernandez said Iberdrola was paying 12.2 times Scottish Powers enterprise value divided by its forecast earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) for 2007, in line with the European utilities sector average of 12.3 times and with German group E.ONs recent bid for Spains Ends. 

 Europes utilities are consolidating as governments ease takeover rules and firms are bolstered by high energy prices and cost cuts. Scottish Power, Britains fifth-largest energy supplier, has long been viewed as a bid target for larger rivals. Last year it rejected a 570 pence a share offer from E.ON. 

 After buying Scottish Power, Iberdrola would trail only Frances EDF and E.ON among Europes utilities. 

 The deal could also help Iberdrola to stay independent amid speculation that its biggest investor, Spanish builder ACS, favours it merging with domestic rival Union Femora. 

 Renewables 

 The new group will be well positioned for the future European energy market and will enjoy a strong growth platform in Spain, the United Kingdom, Continental Europe, North America and the global market, particularly in renewable energy, a sector in which it will be a world leader, Iberdrola chairman and chief executive Ignacio Galen said in a statement.

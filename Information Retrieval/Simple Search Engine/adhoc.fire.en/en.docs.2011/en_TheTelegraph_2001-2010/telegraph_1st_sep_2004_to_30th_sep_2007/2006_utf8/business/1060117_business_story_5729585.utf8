 Arcelor hikes Canadian bid

 Scaling heights

 Brussels, Jan. 16 (Reuters): Arcelor, the worlds number-two steel maker, raised its offer for Canadas Dofasco to C$5.5 billion ($4.74 billion), outbidding Germanys ThyssenKrupp in one of Europes hottest bidding wars.

 The move by the Luxembourg-based company on Monday represented a near 13 per cent premium over its previous bid and was more than 4 per cent higher than ThyssenKrupps latest offer.

 The German group raised its offer for the second time in two weeks on Saturday, after it entered the fray with a bid backed by Dofasco following Arcelors hostile approach last November.

 Arcelor said its new bid was conditional on Dofasco terminating its support for the German groups offer.

 At 0842 GMT, Arcelor shares were down 2.3 per cent at 21.41 euros. ThyssenKrupp was down 1.5 per cent at 18.75 euros.

 Dofasco said Arcelors offer constitutes a superior proposal and it provided ThyssenKrupp with notice of its right to match Arcelors sweetened bid by January 23.

 ThyssenKrupp said it was reviewing Arcelors offer and then would decide how to proceed.

 If ThyssenKrupp decides to withdraw from the bidding war, it is entitled to a fee of C$215 million from Dofasco. 

 Analysts said Dofasco now looked expensive but it was clear that the bidders saw long-term strategic sense in buying the North American steel firm, which is based in Hamilton, Ontario.

 This just shows the value embedded in an integrated company such as Dofasco and that the market does not recognise that, said Morgan Stanley analyst Charles Spencer.

 Despite Arcelors persistence, some analysts said they still thought the German group will win out.

 I think ThyssenKrupp will get the deal, said an analyst who did not want to be named. I think it is ready to pay whatever price and as the bidding war continues, Dofasco is getting more expensive.

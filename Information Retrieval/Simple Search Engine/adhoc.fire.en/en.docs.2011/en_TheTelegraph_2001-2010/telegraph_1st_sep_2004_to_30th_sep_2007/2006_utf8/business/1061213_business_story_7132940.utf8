 New Delhi, Dec. 12: SpiceJet Ltd, a low fare airline, today said it had received proposals from four major equity investors Texas Pacific, Dubai-based Istithmar PJSC, Tata group investment firms and Goldman Sachs worth $118 million for shares in the company. 

 The airline said US-based global investment firm Texas Pacific has proposed to invest $30 million, Istithmar PJSC $25 million, the two Tata entities Tata Investments and Ewart Investments $16 million and Goldman Sachs $5 million. Istithmar has already invested $12.5 million in the company.

 SpiceJet got bids for more than what it planned to sell, Ajay Singh, SpiceJet director, said here today. 

 SpiceJet announced last month it would sell shares worth $80 million in the company. 

 The company said preference shares would be issued after the shareholders approve the bids on January 11.

 Under the arrangement, Istithmar and Goldman Sachs, as senior investors, will get their full quota of shares, as sought in their bids, while the Tatas and Texas Pacific will receive less than their full quota. 

 Sources said after the share issue, Istithmar would hold nearly 25 per cent and the Tatas about 7.5 per cent. The combined stake of founders, including the Kansagra family, may come down to 35 per cent from 44 per cent.

 Istithmar and Texas Pacific have diversified interests. Texas Pacific has often bought out control of the firms in which it has invested.

 Under-cutting of fares by the new players has eroded the bottomlines of most airlines, with many of them reporting losses.

 The airlines are exploring ways to expand their capital base to meet their working capital expenses and finance the purchase of new aircraft.

 SpiceJet said last month it was negotiating with a clutch of investors, both Indian and foreign, to raise $60 million and expected the terms to be finalised by this month.

 The airline raised $80 million previously through overseas convertible bonds.

 Revenues for the year-ended May of the airline was Rs 453 crore.

 The UK-based Kansagras had taken majority stake in the airline, which was known as ModiLuft in its earlier avtar and run by the SK Modi group. 

 The Modis ceded majority control in 2000 when they ran up massive debts. They now have 7 per cent stake in the airline.

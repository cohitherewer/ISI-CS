 Puma gets ready for the big leap 

 SOHINI MOOKHERJEA

 Calcutta, Aug. 23: Puma Sports India Private Limited, set up in January this year as a subsidiary of Puma, will open 40 exclusive stores across the country by 2007.

 The company will also make India the export hub for Saarc countries, South Africa and West Asia.

 Puma decided to form a subsidiary in India to expand its brand presence by introducing categories like sports lifestyle. We are already working on distribution presence in Sri Lanka, Nepal and Bangladesh and would hope to start stores through the franchisee route by next year, said Rajiv Mehta, managing director of Puma Sports India Limited.

 The company has two stores in Chennai and Bangalore and is set to open a 3,500-sq-ft store in Bangalore called Black Station, which will stock the premium fashion range from Puma.

 Calcutta will boast of one store by November 2006 and another in 2007.

 Out of the 40 stores, the eastern and the northeastern region combined would have five stores ranging between 1500 and 3000 sq ft.

 We will make sandals, floaters, flip flops here for export to South Africa and the Saarc countries, Mehta said.

 The company has warehouses in New Delhi and Bangalore and is planning to open another office in the capital. It already has one in Bangalore.

 Puma is not keen on single-brand retail and will continue with the franchisee format with a strict supervision on store format and distribution.

 Puma India does not expect the single-brand FDI levels to increase substantially in the next three years.

 Puma globally is divided into three categories sports, lifestyle and fashion, with the lifestyle and fashion fast emerging as high sales generators.

 The company claims to be the first to bring in the sports lifestyle genre in the country accessories and products that are sporty but have a high fashion content and are not meant for serious sporting activity.

 Puma will also retail the BMW and Ferrari range.

 The Indian subsidiary, which now sells bags, caps, footwear and apparel, plans to introduce the international range of watches, perfumes and eyewear. Talks are on for a presence in multi-brand outlets with retail majors like Bata India Limited, Lifestyle and Westside.

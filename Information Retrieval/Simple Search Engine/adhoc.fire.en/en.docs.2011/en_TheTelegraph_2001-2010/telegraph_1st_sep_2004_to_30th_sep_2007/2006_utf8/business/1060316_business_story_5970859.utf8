 Calcutta, March 15: The Computing Technology Industry Association (CompTIA) will offer information technology (IT) certification programmes in India. The domestic IT training market is estimated at $1246 million and is expected to register a 22 per cent growth in 2006 over 2005.

 CompTIA has been operating globally for the past 24 years and plans to bring to India 11 of its internationally certified programmes like A+. It also plans to launch the worlds first vendor-neutral (not belonging to any particular company or its software) radio frequency identification (RFID) certification in the country next month. The RFID technology, which is expected to gradually replace cards with magnetic strips, uses sensors to detect, store and retrieve data remotely.

 According to the International Data Corporation (IDC) Indias statistics, the IT training and education market is growing at a phenomenal rate from $756 million in 2003 to an estimated $1793 million in 2009. CompTIA, recognising Indias position in the global IT market and employers demand for advanced skills and expertise, would be offering its certification courses in the country, John Venator, president and chief executive officer of CompTIA, said.

 The course fees vary from $150 to $200 per exam and CompTIA is looking at possible tie-ups with banks and financial institutions to offer financial aid to students by the year-end.

 This non-profit organisation, which operates in 102 countries with 20,000 members, works with associations to upgrade skills. Other areas include e-commerce, software services and public policy. CompTIAs programmes for the business process outsourcing sector has helped decrease attrition rates through specially designed employee training programmes, Venator said.

 A few domestic IT training institutes like NIIT and Aptech already offered part of the CompTIA certification programmes. But now, CompTIA, in association with certification service provider Thomson Prometric, will offer testing services in nine cities and 145 centres.

 India has a huge talent pool in smaller towns and cities and we hope to penetrate the market further through our widespread centres. Such globally recognised programmes would make the aspiring students from such towns and cities not only better equipped for the national IT industry but make them internationally competitive for IT jobs, said Pradipto Chakraborty, business development director, CompTIA, India and Thomson Prometric.

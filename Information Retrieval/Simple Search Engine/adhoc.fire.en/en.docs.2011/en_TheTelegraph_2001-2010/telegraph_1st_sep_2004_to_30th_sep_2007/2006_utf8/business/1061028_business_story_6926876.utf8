 Nicholas, Morvus tie up to bust cancer

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

Mumbai, Oct. 27: Nicholas Piramal India Ltd (NPIL) has entered into two licence agreements with Morvus Technology Ltd, a UK-based drug discovery company. 

 Under the agreements, NPIL will have the right to develop and commercialise two of Morvus technologies. 

 The first agreement relates to a technology that allows the identification of novel genes and proteins. 

 NPIL will be responsible for developing the technology to generate new drugs to fight diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis. 

 The second agreement encompasses a combination therapy for cancer, which utilises a specific inhibitor to enhance the effectiveness of known anti-cancer drugs.

 Morvus will be entitled to initial fee payments for both the contracts and will also be entitled to milestone and 2 per cent royalty payments as the potential products progress to the market. 

 Commenting on the agreement, Ajay Piramal, chairman of Nicholas Piramal, said, We are pleased to partner Morvus Technology in drug discovery platforms, which reinforce our discovery research efforts. Morvus is doing excellent work from its laboratories in the UK, a region where we continue to find excellent opportunities for partnering in high-end work. 

 Dr Philip Burke, chief executive of Morvus, added, We have signed these agreements with NPIL as they have a proven capability to develop drugs in these areas, thus providing an excellent opportunity for our early-stage technologies to progress towards the market. NPIL is currently reviewing other aspects of our portfolio and we look forward to further interactions in the near future. 

 Since early 2005, Nicholas Piramal has made significant investments in the UK across its businesses. 

 The company acquired the Inhalation Anaesthetics business of Rhodia Organique Fine Ltd, UK, in January last year, followed by acquisition of the custom manufacturing business of Avecia Group, UK in December 2005 and acquisition of the Morpeth-based Pharmaceutical manufacturing unit of Pfizer, UK in June this year. 

 NPIL added that with these investments, it now has four manufacturing facilities in the UK, which employ nearly 650 people. 

 Morvus Technology Ltd is a drug-discovery company operating in the pharmaceutical/biotech sector. 

 It is focused on developing commercially attractive therapies for cancer and neurological disorders where there is a clear, unmet, medical need. 

 Its business model is to license its programmes at a pre-clinical stage in return for milestone and royalty payments.

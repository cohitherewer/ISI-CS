 New Delhi, June 5: Ballarpur Industries and JP Morgan are jointly picking up a 97.8 per cent stake in Malaysia?s Sabah Forest Industries for $261 million (approximately Rs 1,175 crore). 

 Bilt will be one of the first paper and pulp companies to venture abroad. It will pick up 77.8 per cent, while JP Morgan will buy 20 per cent of the company. 

 ?This acquisition is a strategic fit in our growth plans. It is aimed at retaining leadership in India and expanding our presence in the region,? Bilt vice-chairman and managing director Gautam Thapar said.

 ?The pulp production costs in Malaysia are about half of that in India,? Thapar added.

 Bilt, which will continue to focus on the pulp and paper segment, also plans to invest about $400-500 million over the next 5-6 years to increase the pulp production capacity in the Malaysian plant.

 Sabah Industries, a part of Malaysia?s Lion Forest Industries Bhd, operates the largest pulp and paper mill in Malaysia with paper production capacity of 1,44,000 mt per annum and pulp capacity of 120,000 mt per annum. 

 The acquisition is expected to place Bilt among the 10 top players in the Asian market, a senior official said at a press conference here. 

 Apart from the pulp and paper mill, SFI?s other assets include a jetty, a power plant and a steam generation facility. 

 Bilt also stands to gain from the deal in terms of the use it can make of 2,89,000 hectares of forest land, which SFI holds as concession from the Malaysian government. SFI?s turnover in the fiscal ending June 2005 was $107 million. The consideration of $261 million would be paid over a period of 18 months. 

 The agreement, however, is subject to due diligence and approvals from various regulatory authorities of Malaysia as well as shareholders of the Lions Industries.

 Ballarpur, a part of the Thapar group, is India?s largest paper and pulp company. The group has interests in engineering, chemicals, food and agriculture and information technology.

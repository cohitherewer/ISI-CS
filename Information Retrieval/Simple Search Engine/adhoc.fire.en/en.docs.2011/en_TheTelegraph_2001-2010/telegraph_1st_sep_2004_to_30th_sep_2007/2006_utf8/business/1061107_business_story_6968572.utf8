 Rate rise just a matter of time

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Nov. 6: Interest rates on deposits may rise after finance minister P. Chidambaram today asked commercial banks to enhance their deposit growth rates. 

 Bankers say that though nationalised banks are likely to take the lead in the coming weeks, a hike in deposit rates could make loans dearer as well. 

 Banks have to look at their spreads as well. If deposit rates rise, interest rates on loans could inch up as well, an official from a nationalised bank said. 

 While deposits of banks are now growing at over 18 per cent, the finance minister wants the growth rate to be above 25 per cent. Bankers state that a higher rate of growth can be accomplished by two factors financial inclusion and better returns. 

 At present, a large number of people do not form part of the banking setup. This is more so in the urban areas as there are many investment options available. Therefore, there will be attempt by banks to go in for more financial inclusion. But this will happen only if banks can offer better returns in the metros, adds another banker. 

 Interest rates on deposits are now ruling between 6-8 per cent across various maturities. While they have come down from the level of over 11 per cent that prevailed few years ago, bankers note that at a time when alternative investment avenues like equity markets, real estate and commodities are giving superior returns, many urban savers have shunned banks.

 True, there has been some respite with the finance minister allowing tax incentives to deposits of over five years. But depositors are not enthusiastically putting their money in such long-term deposits as they feel that interest rates could rise further. Rate of interest therefore plays a vital role, says a general manager from a leading south-based public sector bank. 

 Several banks also fear that commercial real estates and personal loans may cost more in the near future following Chidambarams directive to rebalance their credit portfolio for channelising advances to productive sectors. 

 Loan rates may harden for the commercial real estate sector, Vijaya Bank chairman P.P. Mallya said. 

 IDBI Bank chairman V.P. Shetty said his bank would slow down loan disbursal to the real estate sector.

 Real estate carries higher risks. To the extent that credit will be channelised to preferred areas, the rates for real estate may rise little bit, United Bank of India chairman P.K. Gupta said. Another leading PSU bank chairman said there was a possibility of a quarter per cent rise in retail sector loans.

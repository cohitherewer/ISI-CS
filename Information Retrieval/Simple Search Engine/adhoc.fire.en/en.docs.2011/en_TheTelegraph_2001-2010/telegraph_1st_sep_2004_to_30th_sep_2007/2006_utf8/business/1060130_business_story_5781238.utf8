 India loses the whiff of money

 Merrill Lynch?s recent report on global emerging market fund allocations (GEM Fund positioning: January 24, 2006) shows that investors are neutral on India. Thailand, Turkey, Brazil, Russia are the most overweight, relative to their weight in the MSCI index. In contrast, markets like China ex Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Africa are some of the most unloved. The data is for December 30, 2005.

 Indias neutral positioning suggests that it will attract funds according to its weight in the MSCI index from now onwards ? India had a consistently overweight position in the last couple of years, which enabled it to attract more funds than its weight in the index. That appears to be changing, because of the high valuation of the market.

 That neutral positioning is reflected in the relative underperformance of the MSCI India index compared with indices of other emerging markets. For instance, as of January 27, 2006, the return on the MSCI emerging markets index for the year was 7.5 per cent, while the MSCI India index had risen by 4.8 per cent. Contrast the performance of the markets in which fund managers were overweight ? Brazil, up 15.1 per cent, Thailand, up 6.7 per cent, and Turkey, up 13.3 per cent. 

 FII net investments too have slowed down considerably: up to January 27, the net amount of money pumped in was $691.40 million, considerably less than the $2 billion that came in December. One reason could be that cash levels in GEM funds fell to 1.96 per cent by end-December, their lowest level since January 2000.

 Nevertheless, emerging market funds are not the only investors in India?s markets. According to a survey of private equity investors by Colliers Capital, India is a destination for four out of every five private equity investors.

 Steel consolidation

 Will Lakshmi Mittal?s audacious bid for Arcelor lead to a rise in steel prices? If the deal goes through, the Mittal-Arcelor combine will account for 10 per cent of the market. There are several reasons why steel companies will be more valuable going forward. First, the Mittal-Arcelor combine will mean less leverage for raw material suppliers. Consolidation could beat down iron ore and coal prices.

 More importantly, consolidation could lead to shallower booms and busts and make the steel industry less volatile. The lower element of cyclicality will also be good for steel stocks. In the immediate future, demand is likely to remain robust and the only concern lies in steel oversupply. That concern will be addressed to a certain extent by the merger, although much will depend on Chinese overproduction. 

 Moreover, it?s probable that Mittal?s bid for Arcelor could lead to other players too trying to sew up similar deals. That?s the assumption behind the rise in prices of companies like Corus in the UK. Also, it?s worth remembering that both Arcelor and Mittal have been in the race for picking up Chinese steel mills. Chinese reports say that Mittal is in merger talks with Chinese steel makers such as Baotou Iron and Steel Co Ltd in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Kunming Iron and Steel Co Ltd in Yunnan Province. Arcelor is reportedly negotiating a 38-per cent merger deal with Laiwu Iron and Steel Co Ltd in Shandong Province. Chinese reports also point to growing M amp;A activity in China as well, driven both by foreign acquisitions and government fiat. Weak steel prices will only hasten that process. For steel stocks, this could well be the start of another run-up.

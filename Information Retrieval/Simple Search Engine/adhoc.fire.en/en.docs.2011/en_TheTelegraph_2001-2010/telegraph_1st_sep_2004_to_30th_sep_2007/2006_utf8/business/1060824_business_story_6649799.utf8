 IBM to expand in China

 Beijing, Aug. 23 (Reuters): IBM, the worlds biggest computer-services firm, said on Wednesday it could open four offices annually in second-tier Chinese cities in coming years to take advantage of robust growth and a deep talent pool.

 Any expansion would come after IBMs Asia-Pacific office completed its move to Shanghai from Tokyo this year, attracted by vibrant growth and deep talent pools in China.

 The move also brought the company closer to India, IBMs fastest growing market.

 We set up four new offices last year, Michael Cannon-Brookes, vice-president for business development in China and India, said on Wednesday. And that pace is sustainable in the near term.

 International Business Machines Corp of New York had 22 offices in China at the end of last year. It employs 43,000 staff in India, the centre of the worlds software services industry, and 7,300 in China, the worlds manufacturing hub.

 Thats why Im in Shanghai, said Cannon-Brookes.

 IBMs business in India grew 61 per cent in the first quarter from a year earlier as telecom, banking, insurance and services sectors bought computer hardware and services to spur expansion.

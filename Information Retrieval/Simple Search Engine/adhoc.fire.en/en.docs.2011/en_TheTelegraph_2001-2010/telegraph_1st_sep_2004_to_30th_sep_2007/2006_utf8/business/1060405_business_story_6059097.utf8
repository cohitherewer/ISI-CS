 RBI puts lid on advances to states

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Check point

 Mumbai, April 4: A committee set up by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has recommended that normal advances provided by the central bank to state governments for meeting temporary mismatches in their cash flows can be maintained at current levels over the medium term as state finances have shown major signs of improvement.

 Advances provided by the Reserve Bank to states for meeting temporary mismatches in the cash flows of their receipts and payments are called ways and means advances (WMA). 

 There are two types of WMA: normal or clean advances; and special or secured advances that are provided against the collateral of Government of India securities. State-wise limits in respect of normal and special WMA are fixed based on certain parameters and these limits have been revised periodically over the years. An overdraft (OD) occurs whenever these limits are exceeded.

 In its report, the advisory committee on WMA to state governments, headed by MP Bezbaruah, said normal WMA limits are fixed on the basis of a formula which is the average revenue receipts during the last three years.

 It observed that since March 1999, normal WMA limits have been increased every year. 

 However, with the prospective improvement in the financial position of the states, the need to further increase the normal WMA limits, year after year, in line with the growth of average revenue receipts (in accordance with the existing methodology) may not be as compelling over the ensuing medium term, as it was during the late 1990s and the early part of the present decade when state finances were under greater stress. 

 According to the committee, while many states have expressed their satisfaction with the existing formula for computation of WMA, there were some suggestions that the normal WMA limits should be increased on an annual basis in line with the growth of their budgetary transactions. 

 Responding to the plea made by some states that the base be changed to total expenditure instead of revenue receipts, the committee recommended that base may be defined as total expenditure excluding repayments and adjusted for one-time ad hoc expenditures.

 For 2006-07, the proposed normal WMA for all the states stands at Rs 9,875 crore (based on data complied from budget documents of state governments), up from the existing limit of Rs 8,935 crore in 2005-06.

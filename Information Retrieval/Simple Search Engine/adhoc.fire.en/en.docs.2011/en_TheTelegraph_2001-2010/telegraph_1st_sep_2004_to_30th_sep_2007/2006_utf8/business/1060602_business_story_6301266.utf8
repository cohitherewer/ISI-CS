 Squabble over oil bond size

 S.P.S. PANNU AND JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY 

 Ground reality

 New Delhi, June 1: Serious differences have cropped up between the ministries of finance and petroleum over the value of government bonds that have to be issued to oil companies to compensate them for under-recoveries in cooking gas and kerosene prices. 

 While the petroleum ministry is pitching for bonds of more than Rs 30,000 crore, its finance counterpart apparently is comfortable with Rs 15,000 crore. 

 The petroleum ministry is arguing that any offer of less than Rs 30,000 crore will push oil companies into the red, given the prevailing mood to allow only a moderate increase in the price of petrol and diesel with LPG and kerosene prices kept out of the picture.

 Since the bonds are IOU slips to oil companies, the finance ministry, with its revenue-centric approach, wants to limit them to a minimum even at the expense of the profits of oil companies.

 The ministries had bickered in the last fiscal as well: the petroleum ministry demanded bonds worth Rs 15,000 crore, only to be turned down by the finance ministry, which offered Rs 11,500 crore in two tranches.

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh then intervened and asked the finance minister to issue both the tranches in quick succession as the oil companies were in dire straits. 

 The Prime Minister and petroleum minister Murli Deora had discussed the available combinations of duty cuts, price increases and quantity of bonds. 

 If the duties are not scaled down and the government wants a moderate increase in prices of around Rs 2-3 per litre, the value of government bonds needs to be at around Rs 35,000 crore. 

 Petroleum ministry sources said oil companies would save Rs 5,000 crore for every rupee cut in excise duty in petrol and diesel. The ministry prefers this approach as the ready cash in hand offers oil companies a greater room for manoeuvrability.

 Deora feels the offer of bonds is an ad hoc measure. He supports an allocation in the budget for subsidies on kerosene and petrol.

 Taxman seeks views on slew of reliefs

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 17: The government today sought comments from the public on the distinctions between a stock trader and an investor for revenue purposes. 

 It also invited comments on the validity of a range of tax exemptions available to assessees. 

 Currently, market players can term their income from stock market as trading or as investment income. This allows many businessmen to set off losses suffered in one business against income from the stock market.

 If the money earned is trading income, this will continue to be allowed by the government. However, if it is investment income, this has to be separately classified as it is liable to long-term capital gains tax and not normal income tax. 

 The CBDT, therefore, wants to bring in 15 new tests to distinguish between shares held as stock-in trade and shares held as investment.

 These tests would see the period for which the shares have been held, the number of shares traded in, whether they are listed, amounts invested, and whether the amount was invested from company or individuals income or from borrowed funds.

 The addresses to which the comments can be sent by May 25 are available on the website of the income tax department ? incometaxindia.gov.in. 

 Simultaneously, the government also placed on its website, a request for suggestions on whether tax exemptions should be continued or not. 

 Finance minister P. chidambaram had said in his budget speech that all tax exemption schemes of the government would be reviewed and the move is a follow-up of that. 

 Tax exemptions which will be reviewed include exemptions for housing loans, provident fund savings, life insurance policies, savings in National Savings schemes, constituency allowances of legislators, and even farm income. 

 A senior finance ministry official said the list was a general one .... many of these exemptions cannot and will not be touched. For instance, housing sops, provident fund will not be touched nor will legislators allowances or farm incomes. 

 However, he pointed out that exempt, exempt tax would be brought in at a later stage for all tax-saving instruments. 

 But even this will be with prospective effect and old savings will continue to enjoy the protection that they get.

 DLF builds base for skyscraper

 OUR BUREAU

 May 12: DLF Universal, the Gurgaon-based real estate company, today filed the draft prospectus for its Rs 11,000-crore blockbuster issue ? the largest capital flotation in Indian capital markets ? with the Securities and Exchange Board of India.

 In one sense this is a second coming for the real estate giant. Back in 1982, it had delisted from the Bombay Stock Exchange and again in 2003 from the now moribund Delhi Stock Exchange.

 DLF is offering 20.2 crore shares of Rs 2 each for cash at a premium to be decided through the 100 per cent book building process, said a senior company official. The premium will be decided by the first week of June, he said. The DLF flotation will dwarf the other issues in the past like ONGC (Rs 9,700 crore), TCS (Rs 5,000 crore) and Reliance Petroleum (Rs 2,700 crore).

 According to merchant bankers, this public offer will make K.P. Singh, the promoter of DLF, one of the richest men in India. The shareholding of Singh and his family would come down to between 87 and 88 per cent post-IPO, from 99.5 per cent. 

 Out of the issue proceeds, a sum of Rs 6,500 crore will be used to consolidate the process of creating land banks, up to Rs 4,000 crore will be used to return loans, and another Rs 3,100 crore will be used for the execution of development and construction of the existing projects, sources said. 

 While the net profit of the company for 2005-06 was Rs 1,99.4 crore, the issue mentions that DLF has suffered negative cash flows in recent years. The company proposes a fresh issue of 187,097,190 equity shares, and an offer for sale of 14,902,810 equity shares. Besides this, there will be a greenshoe option to issue an additional 17,000,000 equity shares. Thus, the total issue to public, if the greenshoe option is exercised, would aggregate 219,000,000 equity shares. 

 Around 200,000 equity shares of Rs 2 each, have been proposed to be reserved for the employees. Of the balance, at least 60 per cent will be allotted to qualified institutional buyers, 10 per cent to non-institutional investors and 30 per cent to retail investors. Kotak Mahindra Capital and DSP Merrill Lynch are the global coordinators and book running lead managers, while Goldman Sachs and HSBC are advisers to the issue. 

 The company will raise over Rs 10,500 crore from the largest-ever public issue in June. But before coming out with the issue of 20 crore shares to the public, the company will issue seven bonus shares against each held by the existing shareholders, split the stock with a face value of Rs 10 into Rs 2, and place 3.5 crore shares with foreign institutional investors or domestic institutional investors. 

 Approval to these decisions was given by the companys shareholders at the extraordinary general body meeting held on April 20. 

 The group has started the process of acquiring land for building SEZs in Ludhiana, Amritsar and Gurgaon. It also plans to foray into the hotel business.

 Meanwhile, the Rs 500 crore Gurgaon-based Unitech Group today informed the Bombay Stock Exchange that it planned to split its Rs 10 stock into five shares of Rs 2 each. 

 The company also announced a bonus issue in the ratio of 12 equity shares for every one held. 

 The group is looking at an annual growth of over 30 per cent, led primarily from new businesses. In the next five years, the group is expected to achieve revenues of Rs 2,000 crore. The group is developing three malls and entertainment centres in Delhi, Noida and Gurgaon on over 200 acres of land.

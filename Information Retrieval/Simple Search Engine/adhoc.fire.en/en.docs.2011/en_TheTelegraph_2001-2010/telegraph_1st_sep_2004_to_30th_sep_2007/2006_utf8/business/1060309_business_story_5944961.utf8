 Calcutta, March 8: Bengal will get a substantial rebate on interest under the Accelerated Power Development Reforms (APDRP) scheme. The state claims to be the first in the country to avail of this scheme and the additional capacity generation is on track.

 With a rebate of 3 per cent on the interest rate, the existing rate of 7.5 per cent would go down to 4.5 per cent. An additional capacity generation project of 1570 mw in Bakreshwar, Sagardighi, Durgapur and Shantaldihi is on track and slated to be completed by 2007, Bengal power minister Mrinal Banerjee said here today. He was speaking at an interactive meet organised by the Bharat Chamber of Commerce.

 The minister said the state government is in the process of acquiring 5000 acres in the abandoned colliery areas and are engaging the self help groups for Jatropha plantation as part of the states continual efforts in renewable energy.

 Banerjee said around 22 private companies are currently working on renewable energy projects.

 There are more than 50 rice mills in Birbhum, Burdwan, Bankura engaged in power generation through rice husk and have brought in new machines for the same.

 The transmission and distribution loss has come down from 42 per cent to 26 per cent while the aggregate technical and commercial loss is 31 per cent compared with 58 per cent five years back.

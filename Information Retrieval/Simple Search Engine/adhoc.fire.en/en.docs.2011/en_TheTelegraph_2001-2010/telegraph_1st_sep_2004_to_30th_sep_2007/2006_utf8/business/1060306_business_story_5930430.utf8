 Survey to ensure gold purity 

 CHANDRALEKHA TULAL

 All that glitters

 Mumbai, March 5: The Bureau of India Standards (BIS) is planning to launch a fresh survey to determine the extent to which jewellers are swindling their customers by selling impure gold.

 BIS ? which runs a hallmarking scheme that authenticates the purity of gold ? has invited bids from market research agencies, non-government organisations and voluntary consumer organisations to carry out the survey across 16 cities.

 Four years ago, a BIS survey threw up a startling statistic: 88 per cent of all gold jewellery sold in India was not as pure as the jewellers claimed. With gold prices soaring this year, there?s a suspicion that the swindling could be on the rise.

 BIS officials say the survey is designed to raise consumer awareness about the quality of gold jewellery sold in the market. It will be conducted in Pune, Vadodara, Thiruvananthapuram, Madurai, Bhubaneswar, Ranchi, Kanpur, Ludhiana, Indore, Meerut, Jaipur, Jodhpur, Chandigarh, Jammu, Gurgaon and Delhi. 

 In 2002, the surveyors purchased gold jewellery claimed to be of 22-carat purity from 15 outlets in eight cities and had them tested. The results showed that 88 per cent of the jewellery was not as pure as the jewellers claimed. In some case, gold as low as 14 carat and 17 carat had been passed off as 22 carat.

 Extrapolating figures from that survey, BIS concluded that consumers were being ripped off by unscrupulous jewellers to the extent of Rs 6000 crore a year.

 The government launched the hallmarking scheme in April 2000 but found few takers as it was voluntary. Only 1200 of the three lakh jewellers in India subscribe to BIS? hallmarking scheme. But what?s shocking is that even these jewellers ? some of the biggest names in the business ? do not hallmark all the gold they sell. The hallmarking is reserved for only the cheaper stuff; the expensive heavy jewellery isn?t usually hallmarked, say sources. Consumers are often conned into believing that the entire collection is hallmarked whereas a jeweller may have got only a part of his collection assessed. Industry reports say some jewellers have been found to pass off non-hallmarked pieces as hallmarked items. 

 This suits the jeweller as well as the buyer who is loath to spend more money for hallmarking. Most of the top jewellers have a distinctive mark on the jewellery they sell ? and they are ready to buy it back at the prevailing prices for the relevant gold carat. Industry feels that until BIS is armed with the powers to make rules or regulations and carry out search and seizure operations, the hallmarking standards will not have the desired effect. 

 BIS officials say the government plans to make hallmarking of gold jewellery mandatory from January 1, 2008. The Centre has the power to notify any article or process, by way of mandatory requirement, to conform to the Indian Standard.

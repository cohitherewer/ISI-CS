 NSE stock quotes on mobiles 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, May 26: Bangalore-based Live Market Watch Solutions, founded by former cricketer Brijesh Patel, is offering live feed from the NSE on mobile phones.

 The service helps users monitor the movement of select scrips on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) live on their phone screens. The technological breakthrough is the first of its kind in India.

 Around 90 per cent of the calls made by investors to brokers are enquiries regarding stock prices. This service will reduce that bulk and allow more order calls to be made, Patel said.

 LMW-Pro and LMW-Lite are the two variants of the service. 

 While Pro, priced at Rs 199 per month, updates the information every second, Lite, available for Rs 99 per month, refreshes the data every 10 seconds.

 The NSE has 70 lakh investors. Of this, 69 lakh are offline investors who call up brokers to enquire about share prices. We are targeting these clients, said Ganesh Yala, co-founder and CEO of Live Market Watch.

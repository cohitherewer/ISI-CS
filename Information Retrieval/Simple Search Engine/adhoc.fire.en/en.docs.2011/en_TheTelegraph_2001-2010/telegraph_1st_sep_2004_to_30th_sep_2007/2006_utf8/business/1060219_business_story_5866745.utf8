 Andhra Paper charts Rs 650cr expansion

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Calcutta, Feb. 18: L.N. Bangur-owned Andhra Pradesh Paper Mills Ltd has embarked upon a large-scale expansion and modernisation programme at an investment of Rs 650 crore.

 The move will increase its pulp and paper production and upgrade the entire facility to the ECF (elemental chlorine free) grade. Only ITC makes ECF-grade paper in India.

 The entire project would be completed by the year end, said Shreeyash Bangur, vice-president (corporate planning and business development) of Andhra Pradesh Paper Mills.

 After the project is completed, the pulp making capacity will go up to 550 tonnes a day from 300 tonnes at present while that for paper would increase by 30,000 tonnes to 180,000 tonnes a year.

 Under the modernisation programme, the entire pulp making process will be upgraded to ECF. The company hopes to sell 150 tonnes in the open market in India as this product is increasingly being used in the packaging of food materials.

 Moreover, it would also step up export of paper to 25,000 tonnes following the expansion.

 The company expects to reap the benefits of the increased capacity during 2007-08.

 Bangur said the topline should reach Rs 650-700 crore during the year compared with Rs 500 crore in 2004-05.

 The expanded pulp capacity would also help the Kadiam facility use fresh pulp to make paper. At present, this unit makes paper from recycled pulp. The bigger unit at Rajamundry already uses fresh pulp.

 To meet the demand of pulp, the company had initiated an afforestation programme five years ago. It now hopes to get 70-80 per cent of the wood from these resources raised by farmers, who were provided saplings and other assistance by the company. The remaining 20-30 per cent will come from other government sources. The company is providing 40 lakh saplings every year to farmers now.

 To improve co-ordination among all sections ? from procurement of wood to marketing of paper ? it is also implementing an enterprise resource planning (ERP) programme.

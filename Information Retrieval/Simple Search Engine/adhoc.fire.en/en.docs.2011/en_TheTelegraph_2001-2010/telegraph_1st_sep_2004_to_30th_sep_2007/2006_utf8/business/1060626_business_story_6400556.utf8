 Ambani: Big plans

 Mumbai, June 25: Anil Ambani may have serious differences with elder brother Mukesh over certain provisions of the non-compete agreement, but that hasnt deterred him from expanding his operations.

 The younger scion is now touring the Gulf to sign big bandwidth deals that will ramp up international bandwidth capacity on Falcon cable system, which is under construction. Falcon, which is a part of the Reliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani group (R-ADAG), is a submarine telecommunication cable interconnecting India and several countries in the Persian Gulf. 

 Reliable sources said Ambani is now touring Oman and Kuwait and is likely to proceed to Saudi Arabia and Bahrain to sign similar bandwidth deals.

 Although the exact details in this regard are still sketchy, sources said Ambani has already signed a deal in Oman this morning and the one in Kuwait will be finalised later in the evening.

 In Oman, he met Omantels chairman Saud Al-Shakeeri and president Mohammed bin Ali Al Wohaibi, sources said. Omantel has two landing points in Al Seeb and Khasab and there is an option to set up a third landing point in Salalah.

 Ambani also met Sheikh Mohammed Bin Abdullah Bin Isa Al Harthi, minister of transportation and communications and chairman of Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (TRA).

 TRA was established in 2002. It is a corporate body, which was set up with the purpose of introducing competition and regulating the telecommunication sector.

 In Kuwait, he met Ismail Al Shatti, minister of telecommunications. The ministry of communications solely operates Kuwaits fixed telecommunication network and is also the regulatory entity for telecommunication in the country.

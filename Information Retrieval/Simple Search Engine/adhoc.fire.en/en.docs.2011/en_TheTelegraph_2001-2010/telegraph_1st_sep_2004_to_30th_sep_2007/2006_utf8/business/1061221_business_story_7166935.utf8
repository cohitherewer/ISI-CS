 Hutch action in London

 London, Dec. 20 (PTI): Amid speculation that British telecom giant Vodafone could be interested in acquiring Indias third-largest mobile operator Hutch-Essar, top officials of the joint venture company as well as the Indian parent Essar are in the city by coincidence.

 Essar vice-chairman Ravi Ruia, Essar Teleholdings CEO Vikas Saraf and Hutch-Essar managing director Asim Ghosh are here. 

 But it is not clear whether their visit is related to the reported acquisition by Vodafone or some other purpose.

 Sources in the know, however, said Ghosh is here on a personal visit.

 The purpose of Ruias visit could not be ascertained.

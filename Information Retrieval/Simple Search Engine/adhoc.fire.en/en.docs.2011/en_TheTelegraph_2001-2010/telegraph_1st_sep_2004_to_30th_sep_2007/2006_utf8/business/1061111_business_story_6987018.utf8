 Calcutta, Nov. 10: Usha Martin Ltd and Gustav Wolf of Germany have joined hands to set up a tyre bead wire unit in Ranchi.

 It will have a capacity of 30,000 tonnes a year entailing an investment of Rs 40 crore.

 The first phase of the tyre bead project will be commissioned in the next two years with a capacity of 15,000 tonnes.

 Both Usha Martin and Gustav Wolf will have an equal stake in the venture.

 The Indian market for this high value product is 72,000 tonnes a year. 

 Tata SSL is the largest player in the domestic market, which is also witnessing Chinese import of late.

 P. Bhattacharya, joint managing director of Usha Martin, said the new investment was a step towards realising the opportunity arising out of the growing Indian automobile sector.

 Both companies have already established a relationship. They have joint ventures in wire rope in Dubai and in steel cord for belt reinforcement at Ranchi.

 Under the new arrangement, the cord capacity is also being increased from 2,400 tonnes to 3,600 tonnes a year.

 Gustav Wolf is one of the leading players in this segment.

 The tyre bead project is part of Usha Martins strategy to go up the value chain. A tonne of tyre bead costs no less than Rs 45,000-50,000 a tonne, made from steel, which costs about Rs 25,000 a tonne.

 The company makes the speciality steel required for such products. It has a capacity of 340,000 tonnes that will be raised to 1 million tonnes in the next four years.

 With an iron ore and a coal mine under its belt, it is hoping to improve profitability this fiscal.

 Compared with net sales of Rs 1,850 crore last fiscal, its turnover is expected to touch Rs 2,100 crore while profit after tax may touch Rs 125 crore, up by almost 50 per cent from Rs 80 crore in 2005-06.

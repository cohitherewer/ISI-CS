 Calcutta, April 19: Hindustan Paper Corporation Ltd has chalked out a Rs 3,700-crore expansion plan for the next three years. The state-owned paper maker plans to almost treble its installed production capacity to 8 lakh tonnes per annum by 2011-12 from the current level of 3 lakh tonnes annually.

 The per capita paper consumption in India is only 6 kg while the Asian and world averages are 28 kg and 54 kg respectively. This implies that the growth potential for per capita paper consumption in the country is huge given the current rate of growth, said Raji Philip, chairman-cum-managing director of Hindustan Paper.

 The demand for all categories ? pulp and boards, printing and writing and newsprint ? will continue to outpace domestic production for some time now. Thats why all big companies have embarked on capacity expansion. So have we, he added.

 The expansion will be funded through a mix of internal accruals and borrowings, said Philip, adding, After the expansion, our equity-debt ratio will be 1:2. Right now, we are a debt-free company.

 Hindustan Paper has been planning an initial public offering of Rs 300 crore. But Philip declined to divulge anything on this. We have a networth of Rs 900 crore. A part of the expansion cost will also come from our operational income during the next three years, Philip said.

 Initially, the company will set up a paper mill with an installed capacity of 3 lakh tonnes per annum. The exact location for the plant has not yet been decided. However, it will be set up somewhere in central Uttar Pradesh at an investment of Rs 2,400 crore, Philip said. Construction of the new manufacturing unit will start in July and be completed by 2009.

 Besides, Hindustan Paper will also expand and modernise production capacities at Cachar Paper Mill and Nagaon Paper Mill ? its existing plants in Asom ? at a cost of Rs 660 crore. Both the mills, having installed capacities of 1 lakh tonnes each, are currently operating overtime producing 1,00,631 tonnes and 1,06,437 tonnes, respectively. The capacity at our Nagaon mill will be increased by 30 per cent, while both our Asom mills will be modernised with upgraded technology, said Philip.

 As of now, the two mills are using only bamboo as raw material to manufacture printing and writing, copier and type writing paper and other reels and sheets.

 However, the brownfield expansion will be the largest at its subsidiary, Hindustan Newsprint Ltd, in Kerala. Hindustan Paper has earmarked Rs 700 crore for expansion and modernisation of its newsprint manufacturing unit. The Hindustan Newsprint unit, which rolls out 1,13,050 tonnes of newsprint against an installed capacity of 1,00,000 tonnes per annum, will be upgraded to manufacture finer and premium newsprint and printing paper.

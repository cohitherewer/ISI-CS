 Russian bank picks up 5% in EADS

 Moscow, Aug. 29 (Reuters): Russian state bank Vneshtorgbank has accumulated a 5 per cent stake in European aerospace firm EADS, the maker of Airbus planes, business daily Vedomosti reported on Tuesday.

 Quoting sources close to the bank and government officials, the paper said the former Soviet foreign trade bank, which is Russias second-largest bank, spent around $1 billion (527 million) buying EADS shares on the market.

 Officials at both companies were not immediately available for comment.

 EADS is keen to expand in Russia, where it is competing with US rival Boeing for a multi-billion-dollar contract to renew the ageing fleet of Russian national carrier Aeroflot.

 Vedomostis report comes as Russia plans to relax its curbs on foreign investment in commercial aviation projects to allow foreign capital to own stakes of up to 49 per cent. Currently foreign companies can own less than 25 per cent.

 The move appears in line with a trend of consolidating state control over strategic Russian industries and then inviting foreign companies as minority shareholders.

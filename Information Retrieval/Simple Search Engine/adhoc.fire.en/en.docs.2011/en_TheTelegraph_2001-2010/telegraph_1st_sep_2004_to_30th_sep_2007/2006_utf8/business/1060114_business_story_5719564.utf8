 Bajaj Auto net profit up 53%

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Jan. 13: Bajaj Auto Ltd (BAL) today beat expectations when it posted a 53 per cent rise in net profit for the third quarter ended December 31, 2005 as topline swelled on account of better sales and margins expanded due to fall in raw material costs. 

 Net profit during the quarter shot up to Rs 280 crore from Rs 182.7 crore in the corresponding period last year.

 The period saw Bajaj Autos total turnover jumping to Rs 2107.3 crore from Rs 1692.6 crore, while net sales was placed at Rs 2000.9 crore (Rs 1605.7 crore). 

 The increase in profits was driven by the automobile business. While the turnover in the automobile business grew by 25 per cent, operating profits from the business grew by 65 per cent, BAL said while commenting on its performance.

 The company said margins improved due to various factors. Apart from a growth in the sale of motorcycles, there was a change of product mix in favour of motorcycles in the premium and value segments. Moreover, amidst productivity gains, the company was successful in keeping a tight lid over costs.

 According to BAL, the reporting period saw the highest ever sales of two- and three-wheelers. While the Bajaj Pulsar twins crossed cumulative sales of one million in November, the cumulative sales of the Bajaj Auto since inception crossed 25 million units in October.

 Motorcycle sales for nine months continued to outgrow the industry as it rose by around 31 per cent against the industry growth of around 19 per cent.

 Tata Power plugs into Bengal

 A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta, Oct. 31: Tata Power will set up a 120-mw plant in Haldia for Hooghly Met Coke and Power Company Limited, involving an investment of Rs 120 crore. 

 Hooghly Met Coke, a joint venture between Tata Steel and West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation, is setting up a standalone coke oven unit and a power plant in Haldia.

 The boards of Tata Steel and Tata Power have passed the resolution to hand over the power plant to Tata Power. The Hooghly Met Coke board will meet on November 4 to discuss the same. The name of the joint venture might have to be changed with power being dropped from it, Hooghly Met Coke chairman T.K. Mukherjee said.

 The proposed capacity of the coke plant is 1.6 mtpa of high quality low-ash metallurgical coke along with 120 mw of power generation. This will involve a total investment of around Rs 1,660 crore.

 The coke oven would be commissioned in phases from June to December 2007 in modules of 0.4 mtpa.

 On commissioning of full capacity, the plant will be one of the largest standalone coke plants in India.

 At current prices, 1.6 mtpa of metallurgical coke would cost Rs 2,000 crore, while 120 mw of power at a minimum of Rs 2 per unit would cost around Rs 240 crore. The power purchase agreement for 60 mw has already been signed with the West Bengal State Electricity Board (WBSEB). We should also be supplying to other Tata companies like Tata Metaliks, Tata Chemicals and Tata Bearings. After meeting captive requirement, we will also supply to others like Haldia Dock Complex, Mukherjee added.

 The company has also recruited 41 candidates from the local industrial and technical training institutes in Haldia. They would be trained further in Jamshedpur to operate coke ovens. 

 After three months, they will undergo on-job training for six months after which they will be absorbed in Haldia.

 The coke oven project and the power plant would be providing employment to 800 to 1000 people.

 The project is being set up on the 200-acre waste land of the now defunct Hindustan Fertiliser Corporation Ltd.

 Tata Metaliks

 Mukherjee said Bengal commerce and industry minister Nirupam Sen has assured that 176 acres has been acquired for Tata Metaliks. The company required around 300 to 350 acres. 

 The remaining plot will be acquired soon, he added.

 Beeline for ONGC methane 

 VIVEK NAIR

 Mumbai, Feb. 12: A host of prospective buyers has expressed interest in buying Oil and Natural Gas Corporations coal-bed methane (CBM) that will flow from its Parbatpur block at Jharia in Jharkhand. Commercial production of CBM will begin from March next year.

 The willing customers belong to different industries. According to sources, the interested buyers include Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL), Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC), Lafarge India and Hindalco Industries.

 While CBM is expected to substitute SAILs demand for coking coal, an expensive commodity for the steel industry, DVC will use this fuel for its gas turbine plant at Dhanbad.

 It is for the first time that CBM, which can be used across various industries, will be produced and sold commercially within the country. The selling price will set a benchmark for future CBM deals in the country. ONGC hopes to garner significant revenues from such alternative energy sources over the next few years.

 It will be for the first time in the country that gas from a CBM block will be produced and commercially exploited. We are, therefore, very optimistic. The gas will be sold at market prices, ONGC officials added.

 CBM is methane found in coal seams. Methane is the primary energy source for natural gas. The extraction of CBM involves pumping out water from the seam, thereby releasing gas.

 While close to 14 wells will be drilled in the first phase, ONGC officials said gas production is estimated at 750,000 cubic metres per day. 

 The estimated gas reserves in the block are around 3 trillion cubic feet (tcf), they added.

 ONGC holds the 85-square-km Jharia block through a 90:10 joint venture with Coal India Ltd. 

 The consortium had signed contracts for exploration and production of this block with the ministry of petroleum and natural gas in 2003. 

 The US is currently the worlds largest player in CBM. India, Australia and China are also expected to produce CBM commercially.

 Even as buyers from steel, cement, power, gas distribution, fertilisers and ceramic sectors have expressed interest in sourcing gas from this project, ONGC is readying a back-up plan in case it does not get a good price. Sources said one of the options might include acquiring or setting up a unit that can use this CBM closer to the production site.

 Patton in supply pact with US outfit

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Oct. 10: US-based Cooper Industries today signed an MoU with Patton International to source electrical products and electrical tools.

 The agreement was signed at Writers Buildings in the presence of Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.

 We are glad to have Patton as a partner with us. They have excellent quality products, great manufacturing process, highly trained work force and thats what we were looking for here in this country, Paul R Dawley, director of strategic sourcing and logistics, Cooper CrouseHinds said.

 Patton group managing director Sanjay Budhia said the company would supply electrical switch boxes, electrical fittings, stamping parts and other products according to the specifications of Coopers. Budhia said Patton was the sole supplier from eastern India to the $4.7-billion Cooper which sources 30 per cent of its requirements from abroad.

 The products will be made at the Falta export processing zone where Patton is setting up a Rs 60-facility for engineering goods.

 The foundation stone for the unit was laid on July 8 in the presence of Bhattacharjee, and Budhia said that the deal with Cooper necessitated advancing the opening date of the plant by five months. He said the plant would commence operations in the next four months. 

 The Falta unit is expected to provide employment to 250 and generate Rs 250 crore in foreign exchange earnings.

 At the signing of the MoU, Bhattacharjee said, In Bengal we lack manufacturing units for electrical products. With the coming of Cooper this void will be filled up. In fact, I even asked them to come and have their own unit in Bengal.

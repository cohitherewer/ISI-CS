 New Delhi, Feb. 13: The Prime Ministers Office today held a meeting with the chiefs of state-run oil companies to explore the possibility of wooing big-ticket NRI investments into the petrochemicals sector.

 Sources said ONGC chairman Subir Raha, Indian Oil chief Sarthak Behuria and Hindustan Petroleum managing director M.B. Lal were among those who attended the meeting. 

 Representatives of an NRI consortium present at the meeting said they had a $30-billion kitty for investments worldwide, part of which could come to India.

 However, the oil company chiefs were tight-lipped on what transpired at the meeting. One of them just said the discussions were of an exploratory nature.

 The petrochemicals sector has come to be dominated by Reliance Industries after the acquisition of state-run Indian Petrochemicals (IPCL) during the erstwhile Vajpayee regime. This capacity is concentrated in the western region of the country. 

 The public sector oil companies have surplus naphtha, which can be used as feedstock to move up the value chain into petrochemicals.

 Indian Oil has been trying to fill the gap and has made fresh investments in Panipat where it has a refinery. The naphtha from its Mathura refinery can also be transported to Panipat for further processing at the petrochemicals complex.

 ONGC plans to venture into petrochemicals and its Mangalore refinery will provide the feedstock. The company had chalked out a Rs 25,000-crore plan to set up a huge petrochemicals complex, an LNG import terminal and a power plant. The company also plans to double the capacity of the Mangalore refinery to 30 million tonnes which would make that much more naphtha available for petrochemicals.

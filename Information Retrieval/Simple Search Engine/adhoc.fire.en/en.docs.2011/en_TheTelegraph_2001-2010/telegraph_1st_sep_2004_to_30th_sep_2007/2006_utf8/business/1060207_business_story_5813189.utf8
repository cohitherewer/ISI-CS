The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Flakt sets sights on Rs 100cr business

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Feb. 6: Flakt India, the wholly owned subsidiary of the Switzerland-based Flakt Woods, has set a turnover target of Rs 100 crore for the 2006 calendar. In the next two years, the firm plans to double its business in the country. Flakt India makes ACs, ventilators and other such air movement products for industrial and commercial use. 

 Its sales in the last two years have grown at an annual compounded rate of more than 70 per cent. Encouraged by this, Flakt India is now planning to introduce high-end products, such as energy-efficient ductless car park ventilation system, from its Swiss parents stable to expand market in this country.

 We have a two-pronged strategy for doing business in India ? first, to penetrate deep into the market and widen the applications of our products and second, to make the country as a sourcing hub for cheap and quality components to supply to our European markets, said Didier Forget, chief executive officer (air climate), Europe, Flakt Woods Group. 

 While Flakts business in European markets is growing at around 4 per cent annually, the company is experiencing a double digit growth here.

 Flakt India markets only 25 per cent of the parent groups product portfolio. It plans to introduce soon other products like chilled beams, which, the company claims, would revolutionise cooling applications in buildings through energy efficient air handling and heat recovery. These coupled with the car park ventilation system would help Flakt India in leveraging the countrys booming construction sector in which it has little presence.

 The company is also planning to arrange workshops to raise awareness among customers about energy efficiency, environment friendly technology before launching any new product.

 We will upgrade our manufacturing facilities in Chennai and Calcutta and may consider setting up another manufacturing unit on the basis of demand responses, said Ail Baijal, managing director and CEO, Flakt India.

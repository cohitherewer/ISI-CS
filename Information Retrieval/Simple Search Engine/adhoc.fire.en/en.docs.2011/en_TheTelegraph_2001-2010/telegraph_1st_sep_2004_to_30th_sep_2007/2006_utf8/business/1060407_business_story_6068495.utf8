 Luxembourg relief for Mittal

 Mittal: Shot in arm

 Luxembourg, April 6 (Reuters): Luxembourg has dropped a proposed change in its takeover laws that would have helped local steel group Arcelor fend off Mittal Steels $25-billion takeover bid.

 A committee in Luxembourgs Parliament today scrapped the controversial proposed amendment to the countrys takeover laws, said finance committee head Laurent Mosar.

 The amendment, proposed by the committee last month, would have prevented companies resubmitting an offer for 12 months after the failure or withdrawal of a previous bid.

 That would have meant that Mittal could not change the terms of its offer for 12 months, contrary to the practice in many countries.

 But on Tuesday Luxembourgs state council ? the countrys highest administrative review body ? came out against the change and the government had earlier voiced some unease.

 Parliament plans to have its final vote on the takeover law during a plenary session on May 4, Mosar said.

 The small state wedged between Belgium, Germany and France is the largest single shareholder in Arcelor, with a 5.6 per cent stake, and the group has its headquarters in a palatial building just outside the old city centre.

 But Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker, a steelworkers son and outspoken critic of the Mittal bid, has been careful to avoid any international political fall-out or legal challenge to the Grand Duchys actions.

 The formal ruler of Luxembourg, Prince Guillaume, sits on the Arcelor supervisory board.

 In the meantime, Arcelor has beefed up its own legal defences with recourse to Dutch law. On Tuesday it said it was transferring the ownership of its recently acquired Canadian subsidiary Dofasco to a special Dutch foundation, legally independent of Arcelor but with three hand-picked members on its board and a brief to vote in line with a decision of Arcelors independent board members.

 Mittals 20.5-billion-euro share-and-cash bid for Arcelor, which is awaiting regulatory approval, envisages selling Dofasco to German group ThyssenKrupp, which lost out to Arcelor earlier this year in bidding for the Canadian company.

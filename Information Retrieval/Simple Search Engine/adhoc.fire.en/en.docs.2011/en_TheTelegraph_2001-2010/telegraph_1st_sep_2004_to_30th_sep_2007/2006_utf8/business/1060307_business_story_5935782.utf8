 Zen brand to roll on but not the car

 Riding into sunset

 New Delhi, March 6: Maruti Udyog Limited is likely to phase out the production of its popular model Zen.

 ?The Zen brand will continue, but there could be a new car under its umbrella,? said company sources.

 Declining to comment on the timeframe required for the launch or the price of the new model, sources said, ?There will be no facelifts, but a brand new car from Maruti.?

 At present, the price of the Zen Lxi, manufactured under the Bharat Stage III norms, ranges between Rs 3,53,077 and Rs 3,56,489. 

 While the Zen VXi is priced between Rs 3,76,565 and Rs 3,79,968, buyers have to shell out Rs 3,31,399 for a Zen LX model. 

 Maruti Udyog will stop the production of its high-selling compact car or at least reduce it by the month end to create a bigger market share for the company?s other large-selling models like the Swift, the WagonR and the Alto.

 The Zen, rolled out in 1993, has been a huge success for Maruti Udyog for many years, next only in sales to its bread-and-butter car Maruti 800. 

 The five-door hatchback model of the Zen is based on the 1991 Suzuki Cervo Mode, which was meant only for the Japanese market.

 The Zen was the first car designed by Maruti for worldwide market with India as its only production hub. 

 The car?s design and specifications are contemporary with world standards. 

 The Zen was also voted the best car in its category in Belgium and the Netherlands in 1997. It was adjudged the top car in the UK in 1997 in terms of operating costs. 

 The Zen was the first car to have an all-aluminium engine.

 However, the launch of models like the WagonR, the Alto and the Swift is believed to have pulled down the sales of the Zen.

 A new redesigned model of the Zen was introduced in 2003, which put its sales on the fast lane once again. In 2004-05, Maruti Udyog sold 65000 units of the Zen.

 A few days ago, when finance minister P. Chidambaram announced an excise cut on small cars from 24 per cent to 16 per cent, Maruti Udyog cut prices across its models, including Zen.

 Maruti Udyog was among the first to slash prices of its cars by as much as Rs 12,000-Rs 21,000.

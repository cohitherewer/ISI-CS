 Aviation fuel prices ready to fly north

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, May 26: Jet fuel prices are likely to go up from the next month as petroleum product prices have firmed up in the global markets.

 Unlike petrol and diesel, the PSU oil companies have the freedom to charge international market prices on aviation fuel. 

 The rates are revised on the first day of each month based on the average international price of the previous month. 

 In Delhi, prices were raised in May for international airlines to $645.19 per kilo litre (1000 litres) from $615.75 per kilo litre (KL) in April .

 In Calcutta, the prices were a little higher at $675.68 in April and $701.93 in May.

 Domestic airlines pay a sales tax that results in a higher bill compared with global airlines which are exempt from local taxes according to an international treaty.

 International prices have been fluctuating during May and the oil companies will work out the average price for the entire month for revising the price for June, a senior IOC official said.

 Airlines have yet to finalise the hikes, though they have indicated they will raise prices once ATF prices go up. 

 Ajay Jasra of SpiceJet said, We are not planning hikes right now but will take a call when fuel rates go up.

 Indian Airlines officials said any decision would be based on the extent and timing of the hike. Air-Indias Jitendra Bhargava said since fares were raised in May, another hike was not expected soon. 

 , We raised the fuel surcharge on flights to the US from $100 to $125 and from $55 to $65 on flights to Europe, said Jitendra Bhargava, AIs director- corporate affairs. 

 Hit by prices last year, Air India just managed to stay in the black, despite a jump in its turnover by 18 per cent to over Rs 9,000 crore.

 Heidelberg leads race for GSCL

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Nov. 22: HeidelbergCement AG is understood to have emerged as the frontrunner to pick up the promoters stake in Gujarat Sidhee Cements Ltd (GSCL).

 The Mehtas, who control the mid-sized company, are planning to divest a major part of their over 30 per cent stake in GSCL.

 Industry circles say several other suitors are circling GSCL: these include Holcim, Cemex and Lafarge SA. It is learnt that the companys promoters are likely to prefer the German major which figures among the top cement producers of the world.

 If the deal goes through, it will be Heidelbergs second major transaction in the country. 

 In July, HeidelbergCement announced plans to acquire a majority stake in Mysore Cement to gain access to the central and southern Indian markets.

 In the first stage, Germanys largest cement producer intended to buy out a 41.7 per cent stake through a capital increase.

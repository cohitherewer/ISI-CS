 Rs 3673-cr windfall for IOC

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 27: Indian Oil (IOC) has sold 20 per cent of its stake in ONGC, comprising over 2.74 crore shares or 2.24 per cent of the paid-up capital of the oil refiner, to rake in Rs 3,673.41 crore.

 IOC will use the proceeds to reduce its debt burden. The company expected to raise Rs 3,900 to 4,000 crore from the sale, but financial institutions have dug in their heels as they are aware that IOC is short on cash because of skyrocketing crude prices and no hike in domestic petroleum goods rates.

 Citigroup and JM Financials, the merchant bankers for the deal, had to bargain hard with financial institutions. The deal was clinched in the wee hours this morning at Rs 1,340 per share. This was the lower end of the band of Rs 1,330 to Rs 1,399 that IOC had fixed for the share.

 According to Sebi rules, negotiations on share sale had to start after the bourses closed and the deal, if struck, had to be announced before the stock market opened.

 IOC had a 9.61 per cent stake in ONGC with an entitlement of 13.7 crore shares. The IOC board had cleared a proposal to sell 20 per cent of this share, which constitutes 1.92 per cent of the total ONGC stake. Earlier, IOC had sold half of its crossholding in GAIL (India) Ltd, comprising 20.4 million shares, to rake in Rs 561 crore in March.

 The shares were sold at Rs 275 apiece to various domestic and overseas financial institutions, including LIC and ICICI Prudential. The share sale represents a 2.41 per cent stake of GAIL. IOC had a 4.83 per cent stake in GAIL, which amounted to 40.8 million shares.

 The government had raised Rs 4,643 crore by selling the shares of ONGC, IOC and GAIL to each other in 1999 to reduce its fiscal deficit. The stock price of the shares has shot up since then and the 9.6 per cent stake that IOC holds in ONGC is valued at well over Rs 18,000 crore. The company had paid only Rs 1,371 crore for these shares. GAIL owns a 2.4 per cent stake in ONGC. On December 28, the IOC board had approved the sale of 20 per cent of its holding in ONGC and 50 per cent of its holding in GAIL in the current fiscal.

 The company had appointed JM Morgan Stanley and Citi Financial as the merchant bankers for sale of its GAIL shares.

 With international crude prices skyrocketing and the government forcing the downstream oil companies to sell their products at fixed prices, IOC has come under increasing financial pressure. 

 A senior company official said the debt burden of the company had gone up to Rs 26,000 crore for the financial year ended March 31 compared with Rs 17,000 crore in the previous year.

 The government had offered these companies the share-swap option so that they could retain their shares instead of offloading them in the market. However, IOC has chosen to go for the money instead of the swap option because of its dire need for cash.

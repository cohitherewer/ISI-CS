 Hutch keen to settle mobile tiff with Essar

 Way to go

 New Delhi, Dec. 10 (PTI): Hong Kong-based Hutchison is understood to have expressed its desire for an expeditious settlement of the row over the merger of BPL (Mumbai) circle with Hutchison Essar, but no headway seems to be in sight.

 The dispute, one among various between the two joint venture partners, was back in focus when Fok Kin-ning Canning, group managing director of Hutchison Whampoa and chairman of Hutchison Telecom, met Ravi Ruia, vice-chairman of the joint venture partner Essar, on Friday.

 This comes amid the unconfirmed reports that private equity players Blackstone and Texas Pacific are in the race to acquire Hutchison Whampoas Indian assets.

 Sources familiar with the joint venture said while Kin-ning had expressed the desire for a settlement of the dispute, no discussion could be initiated on the issue where Hutch is still to appoint its arbitrator.

 Sources said there has been no development regarding the merger of BPL Mumbai circle into Hutchison-Essar and the a status quo is maintained. Hutch had moved Bombay High Court against the termination and the court has directed an out-of-court settlement through arbitration.

 On August 10, Bombay High Court directed that an arbitration tribunal be set up within 30 days for the settlement of disputes between Essar and Hutchison on the termination of BPL (Mumbai) circle sale deal by the former.

 While declining a stay on the plea of Hutchison-Essar on termination of sale deal, the court had restrained Essar from selling the BPL circle to a third party.

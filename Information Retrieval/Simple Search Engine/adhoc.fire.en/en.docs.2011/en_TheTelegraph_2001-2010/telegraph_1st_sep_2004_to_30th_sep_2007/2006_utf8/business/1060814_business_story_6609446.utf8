 Rancour over Assam selloff

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 No Field day 

 New Delhi, Aug. 13: Senior ONGC officials are opposed to selling the companys Assam oilfields to Oil India Ltd.

 However, it remains to be seen whether they can stall the proposal if the government eventually decides to push it through.

 ONGC officials have taken a strong exception to the fact that the ministry considers OIL to be a better company, though in a regional context.

 They said the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) is far ahead of OIL as it has made major oil discoveries in Mumbai High and Ankleshwar in Gujarat, while OIL has not been able to emerge from the confines of Northeast.

 OIL had to seek ONGCs help to fight a well-head fire in one of its fields last year, they added. This clearly reflects on the operational capabilities of the two companies, an ONGC official said.

 A senior ONGC official told The Telegraph that there was a huge difference in the size of two companies as ONGC produces over 24 million tonnes of crude while OILs output is only 3.5 million tonnes.

 ONGC is ready with a Rs 3,300-crore war chest to double its crude output in Assam in the next three years, the officials said.

 However, the law and order situation in the state will determine the inflow of these funds.

 OIL has been performing better than ONGC in the Northeast in meeting its output targets. OIL is seen as having a more Assamese character, which enables it to handle operations with relatively greater ease in the prevailing socio-political conditions of the state.

 ONGC produced around 3 million tonnes of crude in Assam during the early nineties but the output has fallen to 1.5 million tonnes now. It also produces 470 million standard cubic metres of gas every year.

 While ageing fields are contributing to the decline in output, numerous bandhs and protests in the state have prevented ONGC from realising its full potential.

 Official figures show there had been periods when ONGC has been able to achieve only 82 per cent of its targeted output. The company has listed frequent bandhs and strikes that disrupt production as one of the major factors for this shortfall. 

 It is not that OIL has been entirely free of these problems, but the ground realities show that it has not been hit as badly as ONGC. 

 Senior ONGC officials have been complaining that the security provided by the Assam government to the oil firm is not adequate, particularly in areas adjoining Nagaland and the oilfields in upper Assam.

 ONGCs main oilfields, which include Geleki, Rudrasagar and Lakwa, are located in upper Assam. ONGC also owns smaller fields of Borholla and Khoraghat. The proposal envisages the sale of all these oilfields to OIL so that oil production can be enhanced in the state.

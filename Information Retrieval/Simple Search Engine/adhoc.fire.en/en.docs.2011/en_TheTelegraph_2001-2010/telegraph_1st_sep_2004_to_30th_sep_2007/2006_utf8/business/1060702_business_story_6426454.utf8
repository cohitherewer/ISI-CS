 Trade talks flounder

 Geneva, July 1 (Reuters): World Trade Organisation (WTO) countries failed again on Saturday to break a deadlock in global free trade negotiations, but insisted the round was not yet dead.

 Major trade powers agreed on a more prominent role for WTO chief Pascal Lamy in the increasingly desperate search for compromise in the near five-year-old trade round after two days of talks did not heal a split over farm and industrial goods.

 We have clearly reached an impasse here. But does that mean the round is dead? No. We have no intention to give up hope, US trade representative Susan Schwab told a news conference.

 Commerce minister Kamal Nath was more forthright. There is no need to pretend that this has not been a failure, he said.

 Despite Lamys warnings that the future of the WTO round hung by a thread, senior trading powers were unable to agree on how far rich nations should slash farm subsidies and tariffs, and developing countries open their manufacturing markets.

 Without a deal this weekend, Lamy had said the WTO could run out of time to finish the Doha round, which also includes complex issues such as services, by the end of the year which is the absolute cut-off.

 Calling the meeting neither a success nor a disaster, European Union trade chief Peter Mandelson said a breakthrough must come before the end of July.

 Heads of the government of the so-called G6 ? Australia, Brazil, India, Japan, the EU and the United States ? which has been taking the lead in negotiations, could soon meet, possibly at the G8 summit later this month in St Petersburg.

 The talks stalled late on Friday at the end of the first of an originally scheduled three-day negotiations between ministers from some 60 WTO countries. 

 Developing countries said they would not let rich nations negotiate away the primary purpose of the Doha round ? to give economic opportunities to millions living in poverty.

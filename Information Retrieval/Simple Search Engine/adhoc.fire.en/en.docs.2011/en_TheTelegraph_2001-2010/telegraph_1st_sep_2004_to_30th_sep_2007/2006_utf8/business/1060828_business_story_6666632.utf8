 Ministry nixes Anil methane charge

 New Delhi, Aug. 27 (PTI): After the spat over the pricing of natural gas for its projects, Anil Ambanis group is on yet another collision course with the oil ministry as it alleged discrimination in evaluation of bids for coal-bed methane blocks, a charge stoutly denied by the petroleum ministry.

 Breaking its silence over reports of allegations during the last few weeks, the petroleum ministry today said there was no discretionary marking in allotment of coal-bed methane blocks and it was ready to face any legal challenge.

 In the face of allegations against the director-general of hydrocarbon (DGH) by the consortium led by Reliance Natural Resources (RNRL), which was a clear winner in four out of 10 coal-bed methane blocks recently, a petroleum ministry official said, There are no discretionary marks in assessing the bids. All the evaluation parameters (mark wise) were specified clearly in the offer document. The two blocks in question went to the consortium led by Australias Arrow Energy as it had made a technically superior bid.

 When contacted, RNRL said, We have been protesting against the last-minute-changes in the criterion for evaluation, which we, even as bidders, were not informed of till the submission of the bids. This has put us at a disadvantage as changes were arbitrary and non-transparent.

 This is the second instance of protest from Anils group after the petroleum ministry rejected a proposal by Reliance Industries to supply natural gas to RNRL at a price considered half the current market price. 

 The petroleum ministry official said of 20 marks allotted for technical capability, two were for a firms technical assessment of the block and one was for any other work programme such as use of newer technology.

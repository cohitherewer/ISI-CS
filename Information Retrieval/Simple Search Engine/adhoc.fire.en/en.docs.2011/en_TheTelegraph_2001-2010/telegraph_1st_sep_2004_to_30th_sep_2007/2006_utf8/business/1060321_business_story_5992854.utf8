 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, March 20: US-based private equity investor General Atlantic (GA) will invest Rs 300 crore in Hexaware Technologies to acquire a 14.99 per cent post conversion stake through the preferential allotment route. 

 The allotment will be in the form of 10.57 million equity shares and 1.056 million optionally convertible preference shares, amounting to Rs 150.20 crore and Rs 150 crore respectively. 

 The preference shares will carry a coupon rate of 2.95 per cent for the first 18 months. In case the conversion option is not exercised, the shares shall carry a coupon rate of five per cent thereafter. 

 The proceeds of the allotment will be used to create infrastructure assets, enable suitable acquisitions and meet working capital needs of Hexaware, resulting in the long term sustained growth and help the company in realising new growth opportunities. The deal values Hexaware at a capitalisation of Rs 2,000 crore post-investment. 

 GAs investment is a validation of Hexawares focused growth strategy and future prospects. We believe this partnership will be a platform for our global business development and take the company to the next level. Their global footprint, particularly in the US, Germany and China will be of key importance to us, said Atul Nishar, executive chairman, Hexaware Technologies. 

 Hexaware is extremely well-positioned for continued growth due to their specialised IT expertise, high quality client base, international footprint and strong management team. We look forward to leveraging our global network to work closely with management as they continue to expand, said Mark Dzialga, managing director, GA. 

 Hexaware will hold an extraordinary general meeting on April 13 to seek shareholders approval for the transaction. GA invests in both public and private companies with a long-term investment horizon and a value added approach. The firm has approximately $10 billion of capital under management. 

 GA has invested in about 150 companies, with current holdings in nearly 60 portfolio firms. Of this, almost one-half are based outside the US. 

 Hexaware is a leading differentiated premium IT services provider and provides solutions across financial services, insurance, and transportation sectors. The company employs more than 3,800 software professionals in the US and Asia. 

 The company has posted a revenue guidance of $38.6 million and a net profit guidance of $5.4 million for the first quarter ending March 31.

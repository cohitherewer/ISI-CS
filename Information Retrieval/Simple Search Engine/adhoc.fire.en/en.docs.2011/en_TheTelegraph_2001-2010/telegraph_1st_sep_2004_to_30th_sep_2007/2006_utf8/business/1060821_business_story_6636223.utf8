 CII highlights reform woes

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 20: Fifteen years after economic liberalisation, India Inc remains disappointed with the way public sector enterprises have been privatised, de-reservation of the small-scale sector and the progress in the power sector, according to a CII study.

 An overwhelming 81 per cent of the respondents felt that the reform process in case of the privatisation of PSUs has been inadequate and below expectations, the study said.

 The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) conducted a nationwide survey of the captains of industry to gauge their perceptions on economic reforms and liberalisation that began in July 1991.

 Around 72 per cent of the respondents feel abolition of industrial licensing is one of the most successful measures for industrial reforms.

 Industry also appreciated the removal of investment controls by repealing the MRTP act and opening up of sectors for private participation.

 However, industry said, sectors like education, transportation, agriculture, ports and airports, labour reforms and healthcare would demand the highest priority.

 Almost four-fifths of the respondents believe education is critical as India progresses towards higher growth and development. Two-thirds accorded high priority to reforms in labour regulations, the survey said.

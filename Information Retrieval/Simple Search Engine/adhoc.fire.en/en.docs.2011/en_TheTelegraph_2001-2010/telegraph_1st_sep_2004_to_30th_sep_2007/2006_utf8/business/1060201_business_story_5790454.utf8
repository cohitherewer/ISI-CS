 Base year shift helps in growth surge

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 31: Encouraged by the upward revision in the GDP growth rate to 7.5 per cent for 2004-05, finance minister P. Chidambaram is confident the economy would clock similar growth rates in 2005-06.

 The Central Statistical Organisation today revised the growth rate for 2004-05 to 7.5 per cent from the earlier estimate of 6.9 per cent. The new estimate follows a change in the base year to 1999-2000 from 1993-94 in the national income estimations.

 Earlier, I had said the growth would be 7 per cent. Now I am confident it would be close to 7.5 per cent in the second year (of the UPA government), Chidambaram said.

 He attributed the upsurge in the economy to prudent fiscal policy, splendid inflation control by the Reserve Bank through appropriate monetary policies and a more efficient implementation of projects and programmes.

 The growth was even more creditable considering that agriculture recorded a meagre 0.7 per cent growth in 2004-05 due to erratic climatic conditions, Chidambaram said.

 Significantly, the 7.5 per cent growth rate was achieved on the back of an unprecedented 8.5-per-cent growth in the previous fiscal (2003-04).

 The farm sector in the current year (2005-06) is expected to register a robust growth and maintain the momentum, said Chidambaram.

 He said the savings rate in 2004-05 has gone up to 29.1 per cent of the GDP from 28.9 per cent in the previous year at current prices and capital formation increased to 31.3 per cent from 27.2 per cent at current prices. This meant greater investment was taking place, which augured well for the economy, he said.

 This year, the task will be difficult because the base has gone up, he said. Hard work and efficiency would increase prosperity. Growth, I believe, is the best anti-dote to poverty. We are conscious of our obligation to equity. But we are looking at growth that can help alleviate poverty, Chidambaram said.

 GDP at factor cost at constant prices with base year 1999-2000 is estimated at Rs 23,93,671 crore during 2004-05 compared with Rs 22,26,041 crore a year ago, registering a growth of 7.5 per cent. The per capita income grew 6.1 per cent to Rs 19,649 in 2004-05 from Rs 18,517 a year ago.

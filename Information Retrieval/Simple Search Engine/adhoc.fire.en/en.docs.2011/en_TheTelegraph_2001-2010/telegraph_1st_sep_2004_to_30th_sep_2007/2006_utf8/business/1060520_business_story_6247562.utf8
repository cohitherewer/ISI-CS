 Mittal raises Arcelor offer price

 London, May 19 (Reuters): Mittal Steel, seeking to win back eroding investor support for its bid for Arcelor, raised its offer by a third and dropped a key demand for family control over the combined global steel giant.

 In a surprise move on Friday, just a day after the hostile bid was formally launched, Mittal boosted its total value by 6 billion euros to over 24 billion euros ($30.7 billion).

 Arcelor shares jumped some 13 per cent and Mittal?s shed some 5 per cent after a suspension during which the raised offer was made public. Arcelor said it would not comment on the new bid before a board meeting planned on Sunday.

 Mittal?s move came after the value of its cash and share offer fell more than 10 per cent behind the market value of Arcelor, as the Luxembourg-based target announced a buyback of its own shares at above-market prices to ward off Mittal.

 Mittal?s improved bid valued Arcelor shares at 37.9 euros by mid-session on Friday, once again catapulting the offer ahead of Arcelor?s stock which stood at 35.25 euros.

 Mittal, 87 per cent owned by the family of Lakshmi Mittal, is aiming to create a 100 million tonnes per year steel producer, more than three times the size of its closest rival.

 But its ambitions have been fiercely resisted by Luxembourg-based Arcelor and have sparked a political storm, with some European politicians fearing job losses.

 French finance minister Thierry Breton said the government was still awaiting answers from Mittal on questions about its pledges, while Luxembourg, which has a 5.6 per cent Mittal stake, added it still needed to see the bidder?s industrial plan.

 Belgium?s Walloon region, owner of a 2.3 per cent stake, said its decision on whether to sell would depend on jobs and investment plans and not the financial terms of the offer.

 Increasing premium

 A source familiar with the matter said Mittal had mulled raising its offer for more than a week, as Arcelor?s share price traded at an increasing premium to its previous bid, implying Arcelor shareholders were unlikely to accept that offer.

 Lakshmi Mittal had previously said he would raise his bid only if he got a recommendation from Arcelor?s board.

 Mittal Steel said in a statement that it was now offering a choice between one new share and 11.10 euros in cash for each Arcelor share, 17 Mittal Steel shares for every 12 Arcelor shares, or 37.74 euros in cash for each Arcelor share.

 Previously, the main offer from Mittal Steel was 0.8 Mittal Steel shares and 7.05 euros per Arcelor share.

 Mittal Steel said the maximum amount of cash it was offering was now 7.6 billion euros, up 57 percent from its previous bid. 

 The new terms mean the Mittal family?s shareholding in the enlarged company would fall to 45 per cent.

 ?Not only are we offering a very significant increase in the cash component but also a greater participation in the combined company,? chairman Lakshmi Mittal said.

 Gerard Augustin-Normand, head of fund management firm Richelieu Finance, said, ?It is a serious offer and Arcelor, if it is going to reject it, will have to make clear why. Mittal now has a serious chance of winning but much depends on the evolution of the Mittal share price.? 

 Shares in other steel groups were buoyed by the prospect of a higher bid, with Corus up 4.4 per cent and ThyssenKrupp up 5.3 per cent.

 GLOBAL GIANT

 If successful, Mittal Steel would become a global giant worth around $40 billion, employing 320,000 people and producing about 10 per cent of the world?s steel.

 Mittal Steel first announced its offer for Arcelor on Jan. 27 but had to wait for regulatory clearance for the bid from watchdogs in Belgium, France and Luxembourg before posting its offer document this week.

 The offer is open until June 29. Regulators have said the result would be announced on July 13.

 Arcelor has urged shareholders to preserve the companys independence and has already promised an increased 2005 dividend and a 5 billion euro share buyback at a price above the market level, in a bid to win their support.

 Arcelor has also ring-fenced its Canadian unit Dofasco, which it bought earlier this year, inside a Dutch foundation.

 The move would prevent any predator from selling it for five years. Mittal had planned to sell the unit to ThyssenKrupp, which lost a battle for the unit last year to Arcelor.

 Mittal may be back in the race but Arcelors defensive moves mean the outcome is less than clear cut.

 ?Its a nice effort but its not sure this will carry the day,? said Renaud Berenguier at fund manager Aurel Leven.

 ?They raise cash, they boost corporate governance and they are acting quick to try and neutralise the Arcelor buy back. But I do not think this will be recommended (by Arcelor).?

 Lalu bets on boom to let hopes bloom 

 S.P.S. PANNU 

 Lalu: On track

 New Delhi, Feb. 26: Railway minister Lalu Prasad?s ambitious projections from freight and passenger earnings for the second consecutive year are expected to materialise only if the current buoyancy in economy continues. Senior railway officials said the demand for railway wagons is a ?derived demand? and the increase in traffic depends on the country?s economic growth.

 If the economy is growing at a robust pace, more goods are being produced. This, in turn, generates a higher demand for transporting raw materials such as coal and iron ore and finished goods such as steel.

 Freight accounts for more than two-thirds of the railway?s earnings. 

 Similarly, while part of the rise in passenger traffic is normal every year due to a growing population, higher income in a booming economy also fuels passenger traffic as more people can afford to travel.

 ?The over 8-per-cent growth rate of the economy during 2005-06 has been a boon for the railways. If this growth rate continues, the railways will do well again,? said a senior official. 

 While Lalu has been praised for not raising freight rates across the board, the truth is that ?rationalisation of goods tariff? that has been undertaken will actually lead to an increase in freight rates of several commodities.

 The increase in freight rates is also designed to generate more revenue and clearly the minister is not banking merely on the rise in volumes, as is being made out. 

 The freight rates for transporting iron ore have been increased for the second year in a row through the rationalisation of tariffs, though some discounts are expected to be given for loyalty and those who move larger volumes. Similarly, the freight rate for sponge iron has also been raised.

 The new classification will result in higher freight rates for foodgrain, pulses and sugar, though commodities supplied through the public distribution system have been spared.

 Acids, alcohol, industrial salt and caustic soda are some of the other items which will carry a higher freight rate.

 Lightweight items have been reclassified into three new classes, which will mean higher freight rates for most commodities.

 The introduction of new trains, such as the air-conditioned ?garib raths?, are not expected to add much to the revenue kitty of the railways.

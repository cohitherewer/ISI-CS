 Interest, prices restrain growth

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, June 25: Hardening interest rates, rising fuel prices and a simmering inflation rate are likely to check GDP growth rate slightly in the current year. 

 While growth in the previous year was at 8.4 per cent on the back of 3.9 per cent agricultural growth, the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) forecasts an 8 per cent growth for the current year.

 In its latest quarterly report on the state of the economy, the chamber said, The economy should be able to manage an 8 per cent growth rate as the important economies around the world are growing faster, and also because agriculture may repeat its last years performance given the normal forecast of the monsoon. 

 The paper said there has been an improvement in the manufacturing sector, which posted a growth rate of 8.9 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2005-06 against 8.1 per cent a year ago. 

 The CII is also concerned over the drop in the already low growth rate of the intermediate sector and fears the upward price pressure on material inputs of companies will affect their profitability.

 Despite the 6.1 per cent growth registered by the electricity sector, the index of industrial production growth fell to 8.2 per cent during the fourth quarter of 2005-06 from 8.4 per cent a year ago.

 Europe punch in liquor tariff tiff

Brussels, Nov. 10 (Agencies): Europe is on the verge of launching a formal complaint with the World Trade Organisation about Indias high tariffs on wines and spirits. 

 Patience in Brussels has run out after the Indian government missed a European Union deadline for cutting import duties. The start of the case was very close, a senior European Commission official said yesterday. 

 We are moving towards formal consultations (at the WTO) with India, said Peter Power, a spokesman for EU Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson, adding that Brussels has given New Delhi until November 17 to address its concerns. However, our door remains open to India if it wishes to come forward, he said. Peter Mandelson is due to visit India on November 17 to start talks on a free trade agreement. 

 But the WTO complaint is unlikely to be sidelined after India failed to offer any concession at the recent EU/India summit in Helsinki. 

 The EU is angry at the way India allows high regional tariffs on Scotch whisky, French wine and other European drinks. Scotch whisky accounts for less than 1 per cent of the 100 million cases of spirits sold annually in India. 

 A spokesman for the Scotch Whisky Association (SWA) said: The association supports any move to bring the matter forward to WTO dispute proceedings in Geneva so we can move to a level playing field for international producers in India. 

 India imposes a basic customs duty of 150 per cent, one of the highest in the world, but an additional duty is then imposed, which in the case of whisky can raise the total amount of duty to 550 per cent. An EU investigation branded this additional duty as a blatant violation of WTO regulations, adding: The Indian market has remained essentially closed for imported wines and spirits.

 David Williamson, a spokesman for the Scotch Whisky Association, said European wine and spirits producers had run out of patience with India for not moving on the issue.

 We have worked for years look for fair market access in India, Williamson said. We would welcome a request for formal discussion with India on its failure to address its discriminatory tax system for imported spirits and wine.

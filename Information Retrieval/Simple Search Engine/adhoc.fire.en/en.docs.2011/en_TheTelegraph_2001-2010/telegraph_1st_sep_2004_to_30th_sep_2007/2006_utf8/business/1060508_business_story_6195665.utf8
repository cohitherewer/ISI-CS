The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 IOC refuses to play cash ball with port

 S.P.S. PANNU

 Charged up

 New Delhi, May 7: The Indian Oil Corporation and Calcutta Port Trust (CPT) is in a dispute over the payment of wharfage charges for the oil companys pipeline under the Hooghly river. A wharfage charge is the fee that ships and small vessels pay to ports.

 The pipeline carries petrol and diesel from IOCs Haldia refinery to its Budge Budge terminal that feeds the petrol pumps in Calcutta and the adjoining regions.

 The CPT has demanded Rs 3 crore as annual charge for allowing the pipeline to pass through an 8-km stretch under the Hooghly .

 However, IOC has refused to pay, arguing that neither the pipeline interferes with the flow of traffic on the Hooghly, nor does it make use of any land of the CPT.

 IOC has asked the petroleum ministry to take up the issue. A senior ministry official said a meeting with the shipping ministry has been fixed to sort out the matter. 

 Senior IOC officials feel the company is under immense financial strain as international crude prices have skyrocketed and domestic prices of petroleum products have not been revised to cover the increase.

 Also, the company will have to upgrade the quality of its petrol and diesel to meet strict emission standards. The upgrade carries no economic gains for the company in terms of higher prices of fuels.

 The port trust needs to keep in mind that IOC is a government-owned company, which meets a lot of social objectives as well, said a senior company official. 

 Port authorities see the oil companies as cash rich entities, which can be tapped for raking in easy money, he added.

 ONGC had entered into a similar dispute when it replaced its pipelines from Mumbai High to the shore. 

 Mumbai Port Trust demanded Rs 585 crore from the company before it could start work on replacing the pipelines. The port trust had demanded Rs 239 crore as past compensation. 

 ONGC had approached the petroleum ministry to resolve the issue. The company had produced records of past meetings between the petroleum and shipping ministries to back its case. 

 Earlier, charges for way leave fee had been worked out at Re 1 per pipeline per month which was later increased to Rs 10 per pipeline per month. These payments were in the nature of establishing rights in the port limit.

 Andhra Paper charts growth 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Expansion mode

 Calcutta, Dec. 26: LN Bangur-owned Andhra Pradesh Paper Mill has lined up a Rs 300-crore project to expand writing and printing paper capacity by 90,000 tonnes.

 The company will import a used machine from Germany and refurbish it before setting it up at the Rajahmundry plant.

 The new machine will churn out high-margin notebooks, copiers and pigmented paper for printing and publishing.

 Shreeyash Bangur, vice-president (corporate planning amp; business development), said the company was in talks with the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and State Bank of India (SBI) to finance the project.

 While Rs 120 crore would come from internal accrual, the rest would be either foreign currency or rupee loans.

 IFC, a World Bank arm, is a shareholder in the company with a 9.61 per cent stake. It has also extended a credit line to the company.

 Bangur said importing a used machine would result in cost savings of 40 per cent vis--vis a new one.

 Andhra Papers new investment follows the Rs 635-crore expansion plan the company is already executing now.

 The company is expanding pulp line from 90,000 tonnes to 190,000 tonnes, while paper-making will also go up by 25,000 tonnes from 155,000 tonnes now.

 It is already one of the prominent players in printing and writing paper segment, estimated at 2.3 million tonnes.

 The present expansion includes upgradation of the entire facility to ECF (elemental chlorine free) grade.

 Andhra Papers will get the full benefit of the augmented capacity during 2009-10 when its turnover would cross Rs 800 crore against Rs 500 crore in 2005-06. 

 It will then have a combined paper-making facility of over 250,000 tonnes a year.

 The present project also includes replacing the use of re-cycled pulp by fresh or virgin pulp at its Kadiam manufacturing facility. The bigger unit at Rajahmundry already uses fresh pulp.

 The long-term vision is to enter the high margin sector by going up the value chain, Bangur added.

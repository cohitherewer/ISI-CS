 Motorola signs two deals in one day

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, July 25: US-based telecom company Motorola today formed two separate joint ventures with IT giant Wipro and Tech Mahindra that would see the company increase its India presence and focus on activities like outsourcing and other value-added services.

 Wipro Technologies and Motorola Inc will establish a joint venture that will help provide network maintenance, operation and management services for telecom clients globally. 

 The joint venture, named WMNetServ, will provide outsourced telecom services to its customers. The global market size of telecom managed services is estimated to be close to $26 billion. 

 This venture will make maximum use of the Motorola client base globally and will start operations from August 31, A.L. Rao, chief operating officer of Wipro, said here today. 

 Wipro will have a majority stake in the venture. 

 Telecom is one of the largest verticals serviced by Wipro in India. We have close to 8,000 people who are employed in Wipros telecom business. But the clients that we will bid for under the newly formed joint venture will be independent from Wipros telecom business. We will make maximum utilisation of Motorolas global clientele, he added. 

 The headquarters of the joint venture will be based in Europe and the company will have a subsidiary based in London.

 Besides there will be two more offices ? one in Bangalore and the other in New Delhi. The Network Operation Center (NOC) will be based in New Delhi.

 Rao said that the details of the JV have not been worked out yet. 

 Wipro has a proven track record in delivering managed services and complements Motorolas expertise in mobility, said Srikanth Kannankote, corporate vice-president, Motorola. 

 The combined strength of Wipro and Motorola gives WMNetServ a significant competitive advantage in managed services. Customers can reap the benefits of two industry leaders delivering managed services that are innovative, high-quality and offer global capabilities in a converging marketplace. 

 Customers now have a dependable and long-term partner that is backed by two global companies to outsource and manage their network operations.

 The joint venture with Tech Mahindra will be to develop and deliver innovative application solutions. The joint venture company called Canvasm will enable network service providers and enterprises to launch and manage the deployment of applications that will help increase their differentiation, shorten time to revenue, and reduce total cost of ownership. 

 Canvasm will implement end-user applications and content services, consistent service creation, and a delivery and management framework utilising Motorolas global applications management architecture, the companies said in a statement, adding that the JV will deliver customised applications.

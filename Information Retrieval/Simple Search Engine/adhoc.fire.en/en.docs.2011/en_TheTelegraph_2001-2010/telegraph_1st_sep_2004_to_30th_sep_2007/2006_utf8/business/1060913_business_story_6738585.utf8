 IMF warns of global slowdown risks

 Singapore, Sept. 12 (AP): The International Monetary Fund warned today that while its outlook on the global economy remains positive, the risks of a global slowdown have increased due to higher interest rates, surging oil prices and an apparent cooling in the US housing market that could slow the US economy.

 There are risks to the global economic outlook that have tilted to the downside, IMFs semi-annual global financial stability report said.

 Should global growth falter, the IMF said international financial markets could undergo a more severe correction than the one they experienced in May and June, when emerging markets in particular were hit hard.

 The recent market turbulence is a timely reminder for authorities to strengthen macro-economic policies and persevere with needed structural reforms, said the report, released a week before the Washington-based fund starts its Septemer 19-20 annual meeting in Singapore.

 Todays report, which focuses on issues and risks facing global financial markets, gave a general indication of the IMFs outlook on the global economy two days before it releases the second part of its closely watched World Economic Outlook, which includes specific economic forecasts for the world and regions.

 Citing the World Economic Outlook, the report said the IMF sees a continuation of favourable developments, in both growth and inflation. Under this scenario, corporate earnings growth would remain healthy and default rates low. 

 However, as prices for oil and other commodities have risen, investors are uncertain about how much major central banks those in the US, Europe and Japan will have to raise interest rates to keep inflation under control.

 This raised investors aversion to risk, leading to a correction in prices of risky assets and a rise in underlying volatility beginning in may 2006, the report said.

 Given the rather quick recoveries in many financial markets, that turbulence in May and June was modest, and not a harbinger of a protracted downturn, the IMF said.

 Oil prices tumble below $60

 Easy access

 London, Oct. 6 (Reuters): Oil prices fell below $60 per barrel on Friday as investors doubted Opecs resolve to carry out supply cuts and focused instead on brimming fuel stockpiles in top consumer the United States.

 A senior Opec delegate said on Thursday of Opec plans to remove 1 million barrels per day (bpd) from oversupplied markets as soon as possible. 

 It is a big surprise to the market that Opec has not been prepared to formally announce the decision to cut, said Frederic Lasserre, head of commodity research at SG CIB Commodities. 

 It looks like it may take some time for Opec to decide how to allocate this cut and that is bearish, not bullish, Lasserre said.

 US crude fell 22 cents to $59.81 a barrel by 0942 GMT, after dipping to a low of $59.60 in early trade. London Brent fell 20 cents to $59.80.

 Opec president Edmund Daukoru said on Thursday it was only worthwhile for the group to hold an emergency meeting if producers were ready to make a substantial cut from an official output ceiling of 28 million barrels per day (bpd).

 Investors turned their attention back to ample supplies and high stocks as they waited for an official word from Opec on cuts.

 If Opec is not able to get any credibility in reducing supply, we are back to fundamentals, Lasserre said. 

 And the fundamentals are that we have plenty of stocks around they are still building up which means that the market is oversupplied quite substantially.

 US distillate supplies, which include heating oil, rose 200,000 barrels to their highest level since 1999 last week, according to a government report this week.

 Crude oil and gasoline stocks were substantially higher than at the same time last year.

 Despite the high stock cushion, Opecs plan to cut supply has disappointed the worlds top oil consumer.

 US energy secretary Sam Bodman said he did not want Opec to cut output and White House economic adviser Al Hubbard said President George W. Bush was not happy with oil prices near $59 a barrel.

 Nokia remains upbeat

 Helsinki, July 12 (Reuters): Robust demand for new cellphones in emerging markets in Asia is expected to lift second-quarter profits and sales at Nokia, the worlds largest handset maker. 

 The companys underlying earnings per share is set to jump to 0.24 euros from 0.18 euros a year ago, according to a Reuters poll. The reported EPS numbers are expected to include 5-6 cents per share in one-off gains from the settlement of a claim against Turkish telecom operator Telsim. 

 Nokias net sales for April-June are on average projected to rise 21 per cent from last year to 9.76 billion euros ($12.4 billion). 

 The Finnish firm, which sells more than a third of all phones across the world, is seen benefitting from its early entry in emerging markets, where its broad line-up of easy-to-use, cheap models has given it more than a 50 per cent share in many countries. 

 Nokias closest rivals, US-based Motorola and South Koreas Samsung Electronics have in the last few years started a bigger push into these growth markets and have succeeded in taking a share. 

 Nokia is about a year ahead of its rivals, said Evli analyst Ilkka Rauvola, adding that Nokia benefits from its wider line-up and lower production costs in the battle to sell phones for 50 euros or less. 

 Phone price to drop 

 The average selling price (ASP) of a Nokia phone is expected to fall to 101 euros in the April-June quarter from 103 euros in the first three months, due to a weaker US dollar and stronger sales growth in emerging markets, where consumers usually go for cheaper models.

 Its about the growth in cheaper phones, but also 3G has clearly come to the picture, said Opstock analyst Hannu Rauhala.

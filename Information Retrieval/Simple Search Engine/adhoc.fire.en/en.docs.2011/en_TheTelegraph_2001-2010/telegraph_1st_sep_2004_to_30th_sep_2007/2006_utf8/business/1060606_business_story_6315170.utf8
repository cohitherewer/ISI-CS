 Mumbai, June 5: Two domestic pharmaceutical companies today entered into separate deals with overseas firms in dermatology. While Wockhardt Ltd entered into an in-licensing agreement with LSI, a UK-based company, to market Vitix, a patented product for the treatment of vitiligo, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Inc, a wholly owned subsidiary of Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Ltd, entered into a royalty deal with Paul Capital Partners Royalty Fund (Paul Royalty), an international healthcare Investment fund.

 Paul Royalty will invest up to $27 million to finance the development of 16 dermatological products by Glenmark for the US market. In return, it will receive undisclosed royalties on net sales following US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) approval and the launch of each product. 

 According to a Glenmark statement, the products in the portfolio have a total US market revenue of around $1 billion. 

 Under the agreement, Glenmark Pharma will be responsible for the pre-clinical development, managing the clinical trial and manufacturing of the products, while its subsidiary will file the abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs) and upon approval, market the products in the US. 

 The company will also supply active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) for some of the products. Paul Royalty, which will finance product development through milestone payments to Glenmark over the next two years will, in return, receive a royalty on net sales, with the percentage varying by product and performance.

 It is for the first time an Indian company is entering the US market with an entire portfolio of dermatology products, said Glenn Saldanha, MD and CEO of Glemark.

 Wockhardt will bring Vitix to India to treat leucoderma. Habil Khorakiwala, chairman of Wockhardt Ltd said, This agreement is part of Wockhardts initiative to bring advances in medicine to India.

 Market hopes to regain lost touch in new samvat

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Oct. 20: It has been a magical Samvat 2062. Tomorrow Muhurat trading will ring in Samvat 2063 with a wish the elusive 13,000-mark for the sensex. It would be the perfect ode to the year that went by. 

 After a long time we have seen a year where the economic, corporate and market performance have been in complete alignment, said Vallabh Bhansali, chairman of Enam Financial Consultants. 

 What else can be said for a year that began at 7989.86 points on November 1, 2005 and closed at 12709.40 on October 20, 2006? A year that saw the sensex conquer peak after peak a stellar 60 per cent rise in the market indices. A year when no height seemed high enough. 

 Before it all came crashing down on May 22, when a massive sell-off sent the sensex tumbling by 1,111.70 points or 10.16 per cent. The index hit the 10 per cent circuit filter of 10 per cent and trading had to be suspended for an hour. 

 May and June saw the sensex scale the highest peak of 12612.38 on May 10 and the lowest of 8929.44 on June 14. 

 But as Bhansali puts it, This has been a year both marked by healthy corrections and subsequent resurgence, added Bhansali. Since then, the markets slowly recovered to touch a new high of 12928.18 on October 16. 

 However, Manish Sonthalia, vice-president (equity strategy) of Motilal Oswal says the year has been a mixed bag for retail investors. 

 The going has been great for all investors till May due to the wealth effect. The midcap stocks also gave returns ranging between 30-70 per cent. 

 But the rally since then saw retail investors sitting on the fence and its only now they have started coming back to the market, he said. 

 What shall this Samvat hold for investors? 

 The fundamentals are intact. The second quarter results have been superb and there will be an overall earnings upgrade after this quarter, said Sonthalia. 

 While the first quarter witnessed an average 25 per cent growth in net profit for companies, this quarter the increase has been about 35 per cent. 

 All the indications hint at a robust stock market and there should be a slow and steady rise in the indices. While corrections will mark the growth, they are always healthy, said Sonthalia. 

 However, spectacular spurts in indices akin to last year will happen only with price-earnings re-rating and strong fund inflows, both from FIIs and domestic institutions, he added. 

 Bhansali said, No matter what levels the markets are, an investor should be cautious and selective, even more so at these high levels. quot;

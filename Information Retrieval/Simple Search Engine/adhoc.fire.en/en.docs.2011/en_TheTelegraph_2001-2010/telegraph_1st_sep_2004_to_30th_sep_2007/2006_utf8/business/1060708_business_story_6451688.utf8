 PM quit rumour triggers sensex slide

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, July 7: The sensex tanked today on speculation that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh may resign. The markets were already jittery over the Union governments decision to put the divestment programme on hold. After a strong start, the benchmark BSE index today plummeted by 258 points in late trades on rumours that Singh ? considered the architect of reforms ? may quit, perturbed by the attitude of his coalition partners.

 Though the rumour was denied by the Prime Ministers Office (PMO) after market hours, the damage was already done. The markets, which have been in a pullback mode after the recent hammering, ended the week on a negative note. Observers feel the sentiment could be bleak in the days ahead as foreign institutional investors (FIIs) could pull out, disappointed by the slow pace of economic reforms.

 The sensex, which opened at 10813.75, hit an intra-day high of 10887.67 as stocks rallied across the board. However, as the rumour trickled in towards late afternoon, a sudden bout of selling was witnessed. The benchmark index skidded to an intra-day low of 10440.01 and later ended at 10509.53, a loss of 258.44 points or 2.40 per cent.

 The National Stock Exchanges (NSE) S amp;P CNX Nifty also tumbled by 80.55 points or 2.55 per cent to 3,075.85 from the last close of 3,156.40.

 While brokers said FIIs pressed brisk sales in heavyweight counters like Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), many mid and small-cap stocks, which till late noon had rallied sharply, also fell victims to the selling pressure. All the sectoral indices on the BSE ended in the red with the oil and gas index and the metal index suffering the most.

 Analysts said the markets are now entering a crucial phase as the first quarter results of corporate India are just round the corner. However, they added that there are other factors worrying the markets. These include firm crude oil prices and the possibility of another rise in interest rates later this month by the Reserve Bank of India. 

 Global analysts are already talking about the possibility of Bank of Japan hiking the interest rate by 25 basis points. It is expected that RBI, in its quarterly review of monetary policy scheduled later this month, will hike the reverse repo and the cash reserve ratio by 25 basis points each.

 Tata Chem froth in HLL net profit

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Oct. 31: Hindustan Lever Limited (HLL) today reported a 17.7 per cent increase in its profit after tax at Rs 383 crore for the third quarter ended September 30, bringing some cheer to an otherwise lacklustre stock market. 

 The FMCG giant had recorded a profit after tax of Rs 325.35 crore in the year ago period. 

 However, taking into account exceptional items, the net profit of HLL swelled 59.8 per cent to Rs 520.74 crore from Rs 325.96 crore last fiscal. 

 The exceptional items for the quarter amounted to Rs 137.74 crore, which includes a profit of Rs 120.8 crore from the divestment of part shareholding in Tata Chemicals. 

 Total sales grew by 12.2 per cent to Rs 3,066.01 crore from Rs 2,731.54 crore. 

 However, the continuing businesses of the company increased 13.8 per cent for the period to Rs 3,066.01 crore against Rs 2,693.50 crore achieved during the same period last year. 

 The scrip rose 2.12 per cent on the Bombay Stock Exchange to Rs 233.60 amid a volume of 22.5 lakh shares. 

 Strong volume growth and favourable product mix have led the topline with a minor contribution from price increases, said D. Sundaram, finance director of HLL. 

 We have continued to aggressively save costs and thus have been able to increase our profit before interest and taxes margin by 80 basis points, said Sundaram. The companys gross margins, however, increased by 250 basis points. 

 The advertising and promotion expenses spend as part of sales went up from 8.8 per cent for last fiscal to 11.1 per cent for the current fiscal. 

 We will continue to invest and strengthen our brands as we see it as long-term measures, said Sundaram. 

 The FMCG business of the company grew 14.2 per cent, driven by 15 per cent growth in household and personal care business and 10.7 per cent growth in foods. 

 The company will also focus on driving the foods business, including beverages. 

 We have a huge Unilever portfolio to leverage upon. Further, we are also continuously evaluating the inorganic growth option for the segment, he added. 

 The soaps and detergents category grew 12.1 per cent to Rs 1,393.30 crore from Rs 1,242.88 crore, while the personal products segment grew by 17.1 per cent to Rs 853.82 crore from Rs 729.05 crore. 

 The processed foods category grew 19.3 per cent to Rs 97.27 crore from 81.51 and icecreams segment grew 47 per cent to Rs 33.80 crore from 22.98 crore.

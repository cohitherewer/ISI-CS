 Suven in pact with Eli Lilly

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Aug. 29: The Hyderabad-based Suven Life Sciences Ltd has joined hands with the US-based Eli Lilly to carry out pre-clinical research of molecules for disorders in the central nervous system (CNS). 

 Under the collaboration, Suven would receive an initial payment from Eli Lilly for further research on the molecule and would get additional payments after meeting certain targets.

 Suven is pursuing similar agreements with multinational drug companies for some other molecules. 

 Suven told the stock exchanges today that it will receive payments from Lilly and potentially downstream payments if the identified candidates are selected by Lilly for further research and development. 

 The company, however, did not divulge the initial amount that it would receive.

 This is our first true research collaboration with a global pharmaceutical company, thereby helping us realise the next step of our strategic vision, said Venkat Jasti, vice-chairman and CEO of the company. He added that Suvens business model has expanded from contract research and manufacturing services to drug discovery and development support services to collaborative research (CRP) with a leading global life science player.

 This effort is a collaboration between Suven and Lilly, with scientists from both parties working together, with the goal of identifying potent, oral compounds that selectively modulate the specified G-protein coupled receptor for the target CNS disease, said Ramakrishna Nirogi, the companys vice-president, drug discovery.

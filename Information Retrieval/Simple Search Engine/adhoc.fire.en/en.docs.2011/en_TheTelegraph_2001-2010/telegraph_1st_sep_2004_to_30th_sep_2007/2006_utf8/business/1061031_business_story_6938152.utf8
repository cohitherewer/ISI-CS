 Mumbai, Oct. 30: Tata Motors has posted a 31 per cent increase in net profit at Rs 441.72 crore for the second quarter ended September 30, but its stock was battered in an otherwise buoyant market as the results fell way behind the Streets expectations.

 In the same period last year, the company registered a net profit of Rs 337.87 crore.

 According to the earnings estimates of Motilal Oswal, the profit after tax was expected to grow by 51.2 per cent on account of improvement in EBIDTA margin.

 The company continued to witness increases in input costs, interest rates and general inflationary pressures during the quarter which crimped the margins. The cost pressures are expected to continue during the rest of the year.

 The scrip was among the largest losers on the Bombay Stock Exchange. It lost Rs 34.20 or 3.86 per cent to end the day at Rs 852.10. The stock hit a low of Rs 840.05 in the late trading session.

 The stock had witnessed selling pressure ahead of its results as it slipped to Rs 886.30 on October 27 from a high of Rs 910.65 on October 13.

 The company posted revenues of Rs 6,571.79 crore for the quarter, an increase of 37 per cent compared with Rs 4,788.18 crore in the corresponding period last fiscal.

 Profit before tax stood at Rs 586.39 crore, an increase of 29 per cent over Rs 454 crore achieved during the same period last year.

 The automaker sold 1,39,704 units compared with 1,07,066 units during the year-ago period, registering an increase of 30 per cent.

 Tata Motors raised prices of its commercial vehicles from October 1. 

 We shall witness the effect of the price hike in the coming quarters. However, we have to be cautious about further price hikes as we are volume players, said Ravi Kant, managing director of Tata Motors.

 Singur project

 Tata Motors is negotiating the terms for the lease of the land at Singur for the Rs 1-lakh car project. 

 The Bengal government has acquired 876 acres out of 997 acres and they expect that all of the land will be acquired and transferred to them by December, said Kant. 

 We believe that the government has made disbursements to 40-50 per cent of the farmers and special bank branches have been set up for the purpose, said Kant. 

 The project, at an investment of over Rs 1,000 crore, will create direct and indirect employment for 10,000 people.

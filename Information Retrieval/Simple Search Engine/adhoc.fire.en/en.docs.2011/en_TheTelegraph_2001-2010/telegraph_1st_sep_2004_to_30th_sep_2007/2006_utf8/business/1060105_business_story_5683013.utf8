 RIL rocket propels stocks past 9600

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Jan. 4: Reliance Industries continued to dominate trading on the bourses even as market pundits speculated that the value of the stock prior to the demerger would be above Rs 1,000. 

 The stock closed today at Rs 929.60, a gain of Rs 10.10 over the previous close, after touching an all-time high of Rs 935.90. 

 The Reliance factor ? it recorded the highest turnover value of Rs 191.98 crore on the Bombay Stock Exchange ? has been one of the biggest ballasts for the bellwether sensex which closed today at 9648.08, up 108.71 points (or a gain of 1.14 per cent). Banks and information technology stocks also spiralled upwards as excitement built up over the third-quarter earnings season that starts next week.

 Frenzied investors have been scooping up the Reliance stock ahead of its carve up on January 18 with many aiming to pick up shares in the demerged entities that will go to Anil Ambani, especially the telecom business. 

 Yes, people are buying Reliance. But they are not buying Reliance for the purpose of buying the scrip. Buying RIL will give them shares of the telecom entity, says V.K. Sharma, head of research at Anagram Stock Broking. The domination of RIL in the days trading was evident from the fact that it was the highest traded scrip on the BSE as over 20.66 lakh shares were transacted. 

 The mavens on the market have put the value of the pre-demerger Reliance stock at anywhere between Rs 1,000 and Rs 1,200. Some analysts, however, warn that the post-demerger scrip will plummet by as much as 20 per cent. 

 RILs surprise decision to announce its results on January 10 is seen by some as a move to ensure that the shares of Reliance Prime (the refinery-to-textile rump left after the demerger) dont slide by very much in the special one-hour, pre-market trading session on January 18.

 Broking circles said investors were gung-ho about a strong performance by corporate India in the third quarter and expected a steady flow of funds from FIIs.

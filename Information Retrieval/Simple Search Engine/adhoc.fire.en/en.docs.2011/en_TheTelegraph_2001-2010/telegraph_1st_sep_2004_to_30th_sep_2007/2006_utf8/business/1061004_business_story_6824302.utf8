 UN warns of global growth slide 

 New York, Oct. 3 (PTI): The world can expect a robust economic growth rate of 3.6 per cent this year, but it could come down to 3 per cent in 2007, according to the latest United Nations assessment, which warned that widening global imbalances are raising the risk of a sudden and sharp disorderly adjustment. 

 Pointing to the ripple effect of the US economy and the worries about oil supply disruptions, under-secretary-general for economic and social affairs Josi Antonio Ocampo said a number of downside risks could reduce the projection even further.

 With an increasing income gap between the developing and the developed world, a dual divergence could be seen alongside a growth divergence among the developing countries, he told the general assembly second committee on economic and financial matters yesterday. 

 Ocampo described the suspension of the UN World Trade Organisation Doha round of talks as a major setback. 

 He said the least developed countries are the most adversely affected by trends in global disparities, and as such, development partners, including other developing countries, should continue to increase their support through the contribution of official development assistance (ODA), debt reduction and the provision of market access.

 The longer widening global imbalances are allowed to develop, the higher the risk of a sudden and sharp disorderly adjustment, Ocampo said.

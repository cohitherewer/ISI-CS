 New Delhi, Jan. 3: The government will permit financially solvent multi-state co-operative societies engaged in manufacturing activities to raise funds through external commercial borrowings (ECB).

 The borrower should comply with all parameters of ECB guidelines such as recognised lender, permitted end-use, average maturity period and other norms subject to approval by the Reserve Bank of India and the government. 

 The amendment to the ECB policy will come into force after the necessary notification is issued by the Reserve Bank. Todays amendment will allow multi-state cooperatives to access ECBs on a case-to-case basis.

 The ECB policy is regularly reviewed by the government in consultation with the Reserve Bank keeping in view the current macroeconomic situation, challenges faced in external sector management and the experience gained so far in administering the policy. It was last amended in June 2005, an official statement said.

 External commercial borrowings include commercial bank loans, buyers credit, suppliers credit, securitised instruments such as floating-rate notes and fixed-rate bonds and credit from official export credit agencies accessed from abroad. 

 These borrowings act as a source of finance for Indian companies for expansion of the existing capacity as well as for fresh investment, to allow companies to take advantage of the lower interest rate regime abroad. 

 The government had last amended the ECB policy in January 2004. ECB can be accessed under two routes ? automatic and approval. 

 The automatic route applies for external commercial borrowings for investment in the industrial sector, especially infrastructure. These borrowings will not require the approval of the government or the Reserve Bank.

 The maximum amount of ECB that can be raised by an eligible borrower under the automatic route is $500 million during a financial year.

 Under the present policy, companies registered under the Companies Act, 1956, except financial intermediaries such as banks, financial institutions (FIs), housing finance companies and non-banking finance companies (NBFCs), are eligible.

 Subsequently, non-government organisations engaged in micro-finance activities have been permitted to raise ECB up to $5 million during a financial year for permitted end-use under the automatic route.

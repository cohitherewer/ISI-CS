 HP chief to step down in January

 New York, Sept. 12 (Reuters): Hewlett-Packard Co said on Tuesday chairperson Patricia Dunn will step down on January 18, 2007, after coming under fire for ordering a controversial board investigation into boardroom leaks to the media.

 Chief executive and president Mark Hurd will succeed Dunn as the chairperson, as well as retain his existing positions, HP said in a statement. Dunn will continue to serve on the board as a director.

 HPs probe into boardroom leaks dating back to 2005 sparked a media furore, as well as an inquiry by Californias attorney general that could result in criminal liability for identity theft and illegally accessing database information.

 Dunn has defended her role in the inquiry, saying she did not know private investigators hired by the computer maker had used questionable tactics to access private phone records of board directors and journalists.

 Unfortunately, the investigation, which was conducted by third parties, included certain inappropriate techniques, said Dunn in a statement on Tuesday.

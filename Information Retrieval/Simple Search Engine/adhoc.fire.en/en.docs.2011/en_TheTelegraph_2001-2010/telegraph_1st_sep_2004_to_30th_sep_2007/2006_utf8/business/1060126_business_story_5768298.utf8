 Mumbai, Jan. 25: DaimlerChrysler India today launched two versions of its flagship model, the Mercedes S-Class ? the S350 and S500. 

 The S-Class model series has been the numero uno in the luxury class globally with around five lakh units sold. 

 The S350, the base model, will be manufactured in India and will cost between Rs 72 lakh and Rs 75 lakh, while the S500 will be imported from Germany and the starting price will be Rs 85 lakh.

 The new S-Class model provides a choice of two body lengths ? 5076 or 5206 millimetres.

 The engines offer up to 26 per cent more output, while the fuel consumption has been reduced by up to 9 per cent.

 Mercedes-Benz has improved the safety systems for the new S-Class to prevent accidents, improve occupant protection and assist the driver. 

 Pre-Safe ? the unique safety systems for Mercedes-Benz ? recognises potential accident situations as they arise.

 The cockpit management and data system has been redesigned and offers more features, including a radio, CD/DVD player and a port for computer memory cards. 

 The multi-contour technology for the front seats of the new S-Class have been improved to let passengers enjoy a gentle massage to stimulate back muscles, assist blood circulation and thus prevent fatigue.

 Exports grow 41% to $10.3 bn

 New Delhi, Sept. 22 (PTI): The export of goods from India continued to speed ahead at an impressive pace in August, growing at 41.14 per cent year-on-year to touch $10.3 billion.

 The surge in imports was, however, not enough to contain the ballooning trade deficit, which touched $3.4 billion. The overall imports during the month went up 32.16 per cent year-on-year to $13.8 billion, according to figures released by the commerce ministry.

 A large part of this deficit was due to a rising oil import bill, which went up 27.25 per cent to $5 billion.

 The growth of exports this fiscal so far has been 34.48 per cent, which has taken the value of goods exported from India to $48 billion.

 The imports during April-August grew $28.39 billion to $53 billion. The trade deficit in the first six months grew to $20.2 billion from $17.4 billion in the same period last year.

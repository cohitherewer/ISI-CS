 Mumbai, May 25: Shareholders of engineering giant Larsen amp; Toubro (L amp;T) have plenty to cheer as the company topped a great fourth quarter run with an announcement that its board would meet on June 7 to consider a bonus issue. 

 L amp;T posted a net profit (after extraordinary items) of Rs 466.85 crore for the quarter ended March 31, 2006, compared with Rs 333.68 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year, an increase of 40 per cent. 

 Total income during the period increased 8.70 per cent to Rs 4,744.97 crore from Rs 4364.95 crore. The company posted a net profit of Rs 1,012.14 crore for the year ended March 31, 2006 against Rs 983.85 crore in 2004-05. Total income increased to Rs 15,198.63 crore from Rs 13,748.26 crore. 

 The directors recommended a dividend of Rs 22 per share at a board meeting held here today.

 During the year, orders booked by the engineering amp; construction (E amp;C) segment of the company jumped 51 per cent to Rs 19,609 crore.

 SAIL officers on warpath

 ARUN KUMAR THAKUR 

 Ranchi, Jan. 17: The executives of Steel Authority of India (SAIL) have decided to stage a protest against the vague assurances by the SAIL management and the steel ministry to their one-point charter of demand for annual salary increment.

 The executives have been demanding that four per cent of their basic pay be taken as the yardstick for annual increment. 

 All major public sector undertakings, such as National Thermal Power Corporation, Coal India Ltd, and others have implemented what the steel executives are demanding, said B.K. Pandey, president of Association of Steel Executives (ASE), Steel Authority of India units. 

 We are tired of vague assurances of the steel ministry bureaucrats. We cannot approach the steel ministry directly. So, the Steel Executives Federation of India (SEFI) council met in Rourkela on January 7 and decided to protest against the long pending demand of four per cent of basic pay as the rule for annual increment, he added. 

 Following this, more than 20,000 steel executives under the umbrella of SEFI will go on mass casual leave on February 7, Pandey announced here today.

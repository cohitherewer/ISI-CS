 Small is still beautiful for Suzuki after 30 years

 Tokyo, Aug. 9 (Reuters): Japans Suzuki Motor Corporation on Wednesday raised its annual revenue forecast and announced plans to build a 60-billion-yen ($520 million) plant for small cars, as it looks to cash in on a global shift to fuel efficiency amid record-high oil prices.

 Suzuki, ranked fourth in sales volume behind local rivals Toyota Motor Corp, Nissan Motor and Honda Motor, said it would aim for a group revenue of 3 trillion yen this year, up 7 per cent from its previous forecast and in line with analysts estimates.

 At a news conference, chief executive Osamu Suzuki said the auto-maker would target an increase in profits in line with the higher revenue forecast by sticking to its original profit margin plan. That would imply an operating profit of 123 billion yen instead of the official 115 billion yen, at the targeted margin of 4.1 per cent.

 The popularity of 660cc mini vehicles in Japan and heady growth in India and Europe have helped Suzuki expand at breakneck speed, keeping most of its factories running at full capacity.

 With overseas demand for its Swift compact, SX4 crossover and Grand Vitara SUV racing ahead of supply, Suzuki said it would build a 240,000-units-a-year small-car plant in Japan its first new domestic factory in more than 30 years to begin production in the fall of 2008.

 In the light of the runaway demand overseas, we decided it was time for a new factory, Suzuki said. He added that a plant in Japan was ideal considering labour management, costs and flexibility for building export-bound cars.

 The factory, to be constructed at the site of its Sagara plant in Shizuoka, near Mount Fuji, would add some 2,000 jobs and lift domestic production capacity to 1.24 million units by the business year ending March 2010, it said.

 Suzuki said it would boost capacity in Pakistan, where it builds the Alto and other models, to 170,000 units in 2009-10 from 110,000 now.

 It has also said it would double capacity in Hungary, where it builds the Swift, SX4 and Ignis models, to 300,000 units a year in 2008-09 from 160,000 this year. At its Indian unit, Maruti, it plans to raise capacity to 960,000 units in 2009/10 from 630,000 this year.

 Combined with the expansion in Japan, Suzuki aims to be making 3 million cars by the year starting April 2009, it said.

 Minis to compacts

 Until new capacity emerges at its global factories, Suzuki said it would also reduce production of the less-profitable 660cc mini-vehicles in Japan by 30,000 units each this year and next, to make room for more output of small cars.

 By ramping up small-car output by a further 30,000 units next business year, Suzuki said it would aim to achieve a target of bringing domestic small-car sales to 100,000 units in 2008-09, one year ahead of schedule.

 In another plan drawn up with profitability in mind, Suzuki said it aimed to cap the ratio of cars it builds for other automakers at one-tenth of the total 3 million units to be sold in 2009-10.

 Last year, it built about 110,000 units in an original equipment manufacturing (OEM) deal with Nissan, Fiat and other brands, for a ratio of 5.2 per cent.

 CEO Suzuki said the upper limit would also help reduce the risk of overcapacity when the OEM contracts expire.

 Suzuki is in the second year of a five-year business plan under which it had targeted revenue of 3 trillion yen and forecast total capital spending of 1 trillion yen.

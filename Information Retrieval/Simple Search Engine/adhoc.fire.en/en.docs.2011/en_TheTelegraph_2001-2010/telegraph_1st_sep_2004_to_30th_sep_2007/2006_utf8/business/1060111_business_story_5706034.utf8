 Ranbaxy pops Swiss pill

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 10: Ranbaxy Laboratories today announced that it has entered into an agreement with Swiss pharmaceutical company Ferring International to market the latters urology drug Desmopressin.

 Desmopressin used in the treatment of a urological ailment, called nocturia, 

 Nocturia ? having to get up during the night to go to the toilet ? is more likely to occur as people get older. The problem is extremely common among older men because it can be caused by an enlarged prostate (benign prostatic hyperplasia). The prostate presses on the tube called the urethra and prevents the bladder from emptying completely. Hence the need for more frequent trips to the toilet. 

 However, recent studies have shown that many older women also suffer from the same problem.

 Desmopressin, an original research product of Ferring International, is available in tablets and sprays, and is currently being marketed by the companys own subsidiary in India. The new co-marketing arrangement aims to leverage Ranbaxys significant marketing and distribution strengths to maximise patient coverage within the country, Ranbaxy said in a statement.

 The product will be sold under the brand name, Adiuretin.

 This is a strategic move by Ranbaxy to in-licence differentiated products for the Indian market. In a short span of three years, Ranbaxy has become a leader in the urology segment and the agreement will help consolidate our position further, said Sanjeev Dani, regional director (India and West Asia) of Ranbaxy.

 Ferring is a Switzerland-based research-driven speciality biopharmaceutical company with subsidiaries in 40 countries. The company develops and markets in the products in the area of urology, infertility, obstetrics, gastroenterology and endocrinology.

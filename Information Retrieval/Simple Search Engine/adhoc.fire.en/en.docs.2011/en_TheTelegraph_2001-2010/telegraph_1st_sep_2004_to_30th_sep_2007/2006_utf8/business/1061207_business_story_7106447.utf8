 Haldia Petro in fine health

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Dec. 6: Haldia Petrochemical Ltd (HPL) has posted a 45 per cent jump in profit before tax (PBT) in the first eight months of this financial year to Rs 433 crore from Rs 298 crore in the year-ago period, on the back of a strong domestic demand.

 During the April-November period, HPLs gross sales increased by 28 per cent at Rs 5,496 crore compared with Rs 4,298 crore in the same period last year.

 PBT in that period jumped to Rs 433 crore from Rs 298 crore on a like to like basis.

 That the company could achieve a better margin on its product was evident from the fact that its sales volume grew by only 8 per cent.

 The performance comes at a time when HPL promoters, the Bengal government and The Chatterjee Group (TCG), are awaiting the verdict of the Company Law Board (CLB) over the ownership issue.

 The in-fight, however, clearly could not impact the operations of HPL.

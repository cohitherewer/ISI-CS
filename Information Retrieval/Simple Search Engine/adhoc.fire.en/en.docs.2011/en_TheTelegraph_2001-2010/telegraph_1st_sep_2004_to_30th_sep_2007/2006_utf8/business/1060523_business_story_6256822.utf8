 Fuel rate hike by month-end

 Deora

 New Delhi, May 22 (PTI): The government is likely to take a decision on revising fuel prices by the end of this month, petroleum minister Murli Deora said today. We are giving a final shape to it and meet the finance minister, Left parties and our party next week, he said. The decision to revise fuel prices would depend on the outcome of these meetings.

 Earlier this month, Deora had met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, finance minister P. Chidambaram and Left parties to discuss the matter, although no decision could be taken due to lack of consensus.

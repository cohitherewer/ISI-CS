 BASF finetunes operations

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Nov. 28: BASF India Ltd, a subsidiary of German group BASF, will discontinue production of agrochemicals at its plant in Thane, Maharashtra, as part of its ongoing rationalisation measures. The unit will, however, continue to manufacture expandable polystyrene, leather chemicals and textile chemicals.

 Though the production activity at the agrochemical plant in the Thane site is being discontinued, there will be no adverse impact of a material nature because of the discontinuance, the company has informed the stock exchanges. Alternative arrangements have been put in place to supply agrochemical products to its customers, it added.

 The domestic agrochemicals market is highly competitive, said Prasad Chandran, chairman and managing director of BASF India. Since BASF wants to offer new and safe technology at the best price, it has decided to discontinue the production activity at one of the plants in Thane, he added.

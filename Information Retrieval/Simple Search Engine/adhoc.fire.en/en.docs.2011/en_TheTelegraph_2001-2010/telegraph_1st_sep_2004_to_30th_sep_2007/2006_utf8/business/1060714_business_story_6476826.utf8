 UTI Bank earns more profit

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 High note

 Mumbai, July 13: UTI Bank has reported a 30.14 per cent increase in net profit at Rs 120.55 crore for the first quarter ended June 30 compared with Rs 92.63 crore in the corresponding period last year.

 Its net interest income was Rs 321.84 crore, a growth of 45 per cent over Rs 222.48 crore in the year-ago period. 

 According to the bank, the rise in earnings has been possible because of a robust growth in advances. Net advances jumped 65 per cent to Rs 25,836 crore from Rs 15,666 crore. Even as the number of savings bank accounts grew to 38.26 lakh from 26.55 lakh, retail advances moved up to Rs 7,842 crore, a surge of 82 per cent over Rs 4,320 crore in the year-ago period.

 The banks balance sheet size grew by 39 per cent to Rs 53,002.23 crore from Rs 38,014.13 crore as on June 30, 2005. Its fee and other income rose to Rs 184.55 crore.

 However, there was a 96 per cent jump in provisioning during the quarter to Rs 124.81 crore from Rs 63.54 crore in the year-ago period. UTI Bank said an increase in provisioning rates for standard assets to 0.55 per cent from 0.40 per cent on commercial real estate loans, residential housing loans over Rs 20 lakh, personal and capital market loans led to a higher provisioning of Rs 7.29 crore. The total provisioning for standard assets shot up to Rs 21.89 crore during the quarter. Reserve Bank of Indias guidelines on floating provisions (providing above the stipulated norm) led to an additional provision of Rs 13.47 crore on non-performing assets (NPAs).

 The net NPAs of the bank as a proportion of net customer assets was lower at 0.73 per cent at the end of the quarter, down from 1.19 per cent in the year-ago period. Gross NPAs as a proportion of gross customer assets was 1.25 per cent, lower from 1.82 per cent last year.

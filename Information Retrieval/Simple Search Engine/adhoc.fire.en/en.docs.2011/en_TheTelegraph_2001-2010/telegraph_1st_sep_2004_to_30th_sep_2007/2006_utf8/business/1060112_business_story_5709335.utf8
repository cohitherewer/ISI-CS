 Hurricane weighs heavy on BP profit

 Eye of the storm 

 London, Jan. 11 (Reuters): Oil giant BP continued to feel the aftermath of US hurricanes in the fourth quarter, with production down from a year ago and over $1 billion (?568 billion) of lost profits and repair bills. 

 The company has produced an average 4.01 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) in the quarter, a level which was at the lower end of analysts forecasts of 4.0-4.2 million boepd and below the 4.095 million boepd the firm pumped in the fourth quarter of 2004. 

 A company spokesman said the firms average production for 2005 would be around 4.0 million boepd, below the 4.1-4.2 million boepd BP had hoped for before its Gulf of Mexico production was hit by hurricanes in the third quarter. 

 Production hasnt been as fantastic as theyd been hoping, quot; said Geoff Langham, head of trading at CMC Markets. 

 BP has under-performed in the last quarter. quot; 

 Unfortunately for BP, the barrels foregone in the Gulf of Mexico are among the most profitable in its portfolio. 

 BPs shares were flat at 643-1/2 pence at 10 am, when the DJ Stoxx European oil and gas sector index was up 0.23 per cent. 

 The spokesman said the hurricane-related shutdown of its Texas City refinery and hurricane damage elsewhere would cost the worlds second-largest listed oil firm by market capitalisation over $1 billion in lost profits and repairs in the fourth quarter. 

 Oil traders had hoped BP would use its quarterly trading statement to announce a restart date for Texas City but this was not given. 

 However, sources familiar with the plants operations told Reuters on Tuesday it will resume fuel production in March. 

 Bumper 2005 

 Despite the hurricane costs, analysts expect London-based BP to unveil bumper annual profits for 2005 next month, with record oil prices and fat refining margins more than making up for its failure significantly to boost output. 

 However, oil prices eased in the fourth quarter and BP said, as expected, that its refining margins fell significantly in the fourth quarter from the third. 

 A recovery in fuel marketing margins offset around half of the fall in refining profits, and Citigroup said in a trading note that it expected buoyant US gas receipts. 

 Nonetheless, some analysts feel the industry has now ended its run of quarter-on-quarter earnings records and predict weaker times in 2006. 

 BP said it would also take a $400-million charge for a previously announced restructuring of its European marketing business.

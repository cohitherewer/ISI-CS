 Calcutta, May 16: Saint Gobain Glass India will invest about Rs 100 crore for setting up a production line for Cool-Lite, a premium range of reflective glass from its French parents stable. 

 Currently, we are importing Cool-Lite and Antelio branded reflective float glasses from Saint Gobains factories in Europe and China. Manufacturing of these glasses requires a more sophisticated technology than Reflectasol that we make here. We will invest about Rs 100 crore to set up a new production line for Cool-Lite this calendar year, which will produce 3 million sq ft of glass per annum, said R. Subramanian, national head (sales and marketing), Saint Gobain Glass India Pvt Ltd.

 The company today launched an umbrella brand, Sun Ban, for its range of reflective glasses. These glasses, which have a coating of a metal or a metal oxide on one side of it, cost 40 per cent more than a plain sheet glass, Subramanian said.

 Saint Gobain Glass India recently set up its second manufacturing unit adjacent to the first one in Sriperumbudur near Chennai at an investment of Rs 750 crore. 

 While the first unit, built in 2001 at an investment of Rs 650 crore, caters mainly to the domestic market, the second unit manufactures products primarily for the export market.

 Last year, Paris-based Saint Gobain acquired BPB Plc globally following which the latters Indian outfit, India Gypsum, came under its fold. Saint Gobain has seven subsidiaries in this country.

 With a 26 per cent market share in the Rs 1,700-crore glass market in India, Saint Gobain Glass India is clearly the leader.

 We are expecting a 12 per cent market growth this fiscal. However, the float glass market here is only 5 per cent of the overall glass market, but this segment is growing at over 50 per cent per annum. Thats why we are concentrating on it, Subramanian said.

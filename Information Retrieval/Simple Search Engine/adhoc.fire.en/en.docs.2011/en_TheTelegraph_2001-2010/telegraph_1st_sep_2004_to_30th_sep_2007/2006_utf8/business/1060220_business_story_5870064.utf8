 New Delhi, Feb. 19: German carmaker Volkswagen is planning to launch its popular mid-size sedan Passat in India by the end of this year. 

 The Passat will be available in both petrol and diesel variants with a standard 2-litre engine. 

 According to company sources, the car will be imported from Germany and will be priced between Rs 23 lakh and Rs 24 lakh. 

 However, the car will first have to go through a homologation process ? an approval process certifying that the car conforms to Indias vehicular norms.

 The Passat will undergohomologation in April and we will start booking orders and selling the car by the year-end, said Anita Kashyap-Monne, exclusive dealer for Volkswagen in India.

 The much-awaited sedan was supposed to be showcased at the auto expo in Delhi last month. But the company couldnt get the customs clearances in time to be able to bring the Passat to Pragati Maidan for the expo.

 In India, the Passat will compete with Toyota Camry, Honda Accord, Skoda Superb and Mercedes C-class sedans.

 Since its roll-out in Germany in 1973, the Passat has been one of the bestselling cars in Europe and one of the most profitable models for the Volkswagen Group. 

 In North America, the Passat was introduced as Dasher, Santana and Quantum.

 The German carmaker is also planning to introduce its nine-seater Shuttle sometime next year. If everything goes as scheduled, the Shuttle will come to India in the first or the second quarter of 2007. The homologation process will begin only when we are through with the Passat, said Kashyap-Monne.

 The Shuttle, powered with a 2.5-litre diesel engine, will come with a price tag of Rs 20-25 lakh.

 Until now, Kashyap-Monne has sold about 18 Touaregs ? VWs sports utility vehicle, three Phaetons and four Multivans in the country.

 We hope to sell 60 Touaregs, 25 Phaetons and 15 Multivans by the end of this year. This will take our total sales to 100 units, said Kashyap-Monne.

 While Touareg competes with the BMW X5 and Porsche Cayenne, the Phateon is pitted against the Mercedes S-class and BMW 7-series.

 Kashyap-Monne, however, is not very optimistic about the launch of the much-hyped New Beetle here. 

 Though the car is available in both the convertible and non-convertible styles, it needs changes in the rules and regulations before it can get here, she added.

 The dealer failed to get the New Beetle, too, to the Delhi auto show as it was stuck at Mumbai customs.

 The New Beetle has a more powerful 2.5-litre, five-clylinder engine that generates 150 horse power. 

 The styling has been changed from the iconic model of the 60s and now includes bolder, sharper bodylines, especially at the wheel wells and bumpers.

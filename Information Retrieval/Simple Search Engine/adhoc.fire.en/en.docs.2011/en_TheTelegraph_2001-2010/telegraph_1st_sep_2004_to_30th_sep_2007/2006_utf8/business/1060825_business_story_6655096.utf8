 PNB ready for Pak plunge

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Aug. 24: Punjab National Bank (PNB) has set its sights on Pakistan and has filed an application with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for permission to set up shop there. 

 Sources in the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said no Indian bank has operations in Pakistan. However, a couple of banks like the State Bank of India and PNB have filed applications with the apex bank seeking permission to go there.

 PNB is keen to step up its overseas operations and has undertaken the process to set up subsidiary offices in London, Canada, Singapore and Hong Kong. 

 We have a representative office in London. In order to expand our international operations, we plan to upgrade it to a wholly-owned subsidiary and have already filed an application with the UK regulatory authorities for the same, said S.C. Gupta, PNBs chairman and managing director. 

 We will shortly file an application to open a subsidiary at Ottawa in Canada where we plan to infuse Rs 41 crore to begin with, said Gupta. 

 The bank is also in the process of filing an application to open an offshore banking unit in Singapore and set up a branch in Hong Kong. 

 We will invest about Rs 400 crore to Rs 500 crore to expand our overseas operations and will do so with our existing capital, said Gupta. 

 To meet the Basel II norms, the bank had augmented its capital base by Rs 1,000 crore of lower Tier-II bonds. 

 We plan to raise additional capital of Rs 1,000 crore from lower and upper Tier II bonds, added Gupta. At the end of July, PNB has achieved a total business of over Rs 2 lakh crore. 

 The net profit of the bank for the first quarter of the current fiscal grew by 2.61 per cent to Rs 367.52 crore against Rs 358.16 crore in the same period last fiscal. During the period, the bank had suffered a loss of Rs 387 crore on account of transfer of securities from available-for-sale to held-to-maturity category. 

 The operating profit of the bank was 23.9 per cent lower at Rs 490.56 crore against Rs 644.51 crore for the same period last fiscal. 

 The outstanding retail credit amounted to Rs 18,180 crore as on June 30, 2006, a growth of 48.9 per cent compared with Rs 12,206 crore recorded last fiscal.

 Soya oil import norms eased

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 21: The government has eased the import norms for soyabean oil to stabilise prices of edible oil.

 A notification issued by the directorate-general of foreign trade (DGFT) states the government has decided to extend the last date for import of soyabean oil without the clearance of the Genetic Engineering Approval Committee (GEAC) till the end of this financial year.

 The total demand of soyabean oil is 30 lakh tonnes. Of this, 20 lakh tonnes are imported from Argentina and Brazil.

 The government is concerned about the prices of edible oil. We are grateful to them for taking our suggestion in the right spirit by allowing us to import soyabean oil without clearance up to March 2007, said B.V. Mehta, executive president of the Solvent Extractors Association.

 Earlier, the association had also requested the DGFT to keep in abeyance the stipulation for GEAC clearance. This would ensure that supplies to India are not disrupted.

 According to the norms, import of genetically modified foods like soyabean oil requires a one-time clearance from GEAC.

 Mehta expressed concern that consignments of soyabean oil had not reached the country for the last two months because of the stipulation of GEAC approval, which had affected the crushing process.

 The government decision, he said, would help in stabilising prices as soya oil constitutes a major percentage of total edible oil consumed in the country.

 Edible oil consumption in India is growing at around 5 per cent annually, fuelled by growing consumer income and larger availability of imported oils at cheaper prices.

 Every year per capita income is rising by 3-5 per cent, which leads to an annual rise in edible oil consumption at a similar rate, said Mehta.

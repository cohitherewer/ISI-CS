 Deepika Padukone

 Average annual income (say last five years): Not to be revealed

 What rsquo;s the wow factor in the budget? I think the best thing is the reduction in prices of small cars. A lot of people can now switch from two-wheelers to cars

 Do you rely on professional advisers or decide yourself? Mix of both. I take advice but go for something I am convinced about

 What rsquo;s the wow factor in the budget? There is no wow factor in the sense of India Shining. It rsquo;s a budget for the people. Focus has been on healthcare and social reform. The prices of drugs for HIV have been cut

 What rsquo;s the ouch factor in the budget? I rsquo;m not a technical expert on the budget

 Anything you rsquo;d have liked the finance minister to do and he did or didn rsquo;t: If the FM has not done it already, he should allow HIV drugs to be available for free in all government hospitals across the states

 property, a stud farm or

 what you want and face the 

 consequences

 Shobhaa De

 Average annual income (say last five years): No comments

 Average annual tax paid (say last five years): 

 No comments

 What rsquo;s the wow factor in the budget? Frankly, it rsquo;s a budget that is 

 totally lacking in ldquo;oomph rdquo; mdash; we 

 expected more from Mr Chidambaram. There is no wow factor either, unless you rsquo;re dying to buy 

 a small car

 What rsquo;s the ouch factor in the budget? The ouch factor is missing, so 

 we can breathe easy. I only hope 

 that donations to religious institutions being exempt from tax 

 won rsquo;t encourage tax-dodgers to 

 become pious overnight. A 2% 

 hike in service tax is bound to raise hackles. On the whole, a cautious, lacklustre, insipid budget, which brings neither smiles nor snarls 

 to our faces

 Anything you rsquo;d have liked the finance minister to do and he did or didn rsquo;t: I was hoping for a Viagra-driven budget mdash; this one has taken a sleeping pill

 Prefer to invest in: real estate, gold and jewellery, stock market, mutual funds, bank deposits, bonds. And why? No comments

 Rituparna Sengupta

 Average annual income (say last five years): No comments

 Average annual tax paid (say last five years): No comments

 What rsquo;s the wow factor in the budget? I rsquo;ve been shooting non-stop and 

 I don rsquo;t really know anything 

 about it

 Prefer to invest in: real estate, gold and jewellery, stock 

 market, mutual funds, bank 

 deposits, bonds. And 

 why? I go by what my husband suggests as I am not clued in to all these schemes. We would go for stocks and bonds 

 Do you rely on professional advisers or decide yourself? My chartered accountant looks into all the details. That apart, I take my husband rsquo;s advice

 Any business investments? Perhaps movie business, restaurant, commercial property, a stud farm or horses? 

 Yes. My film and TV production company mdash; Bhavna Aaj O Kaal

 Any wild idea or place you 

 simply would love to invest 

 in? Nothing to say

 Advice for amateur investor: Nothing

 Prahlad Kakkar

 Average annual income (say last five years): No idea

 Average annual tax paid (say last five years): I pay a huge amount of tax mdash; about Rs 8 lakh a year 

 What rsquo;s the wow factor in the budget? Reduced excise duty on idli mixes smells of nepotism, but increasing the limit of FIIs in corporate debts from $0.5 billion to $1.5 billion will make a huge difference. If the government has the will, it may translate to improving infrastructure

 What rsquo;s the ouch factor in the budget? None. It rsquo;s a safe and ldquo;soppy rdquo; budget because there are sops for everyone

 Anything you rsquo;d have liked the finance minister to do and he did or didn rsquo;t: Cut down government expenditure. That money should go into improving infrastructure

 Prefer to invest in: real estate, gold and jewellery, stock market, mutual funds, bank deposits, bonds. And why? I rsquo;m not an investor. My money is my pleasure

 Do you rely on professional advisers or decide yourself? 

 They rsquo;ve stopped giving me 

 professional advice

 Any business investments? Perhaps movie business, restaurant, commercial property, a stud farm or horses? 

 I cook slow food, not fast food. I rsquo;m looking at a large place for a base kitchen that would supply several of my restaurants

 Any wild idea or place you simply would love to invest in: I want to buy an island

 Advice for amateur investor: Buy land in cities and sit on it

 Bipasha Basu

 Average annual income (say last five years): Off the cuff, I cannot reply

 What rsquo;s the wow factor in the budget? Removal of fringe benefit tax on the amount companies pay brand 

 ambassadors. I rsquo;m also happy that cigarettes will cost more

 What rsquo;s the ouch factor in the budget? The 12% service tax. It will hurt everyone, including ad agencies 

 Anything you rsquo;d have liked the finance minister to do and he did or didn rsquo;t?

 He has not given any tax breaks to the common man

 Prefer to invest in: real estate, gold and jewellery, stock market, mutual funds, bank deposits, bonds. And why? Real estate. Also mutual funds, jewellery, stocks and LIC policies 

 Do you rely on professional advisers or decide yourself? 

 Yes, but the final call is mine

 Any business investments? Perhaps movie business, restaurant, commercial property, a stud farm or horses? 

 I plan to look at a restaurant option

 Any wild idea or place you simply would love to invest in? A farmhouse for my parents in interior Goa

 Advice for amateur 

 investor: Go for mutual funds or tax-free government bonds

 Dia Mirza

 What rsquo;s the wow factor in the budget? I didn rsquo;t like the budget at all, what with increased service tax and 

 business class foreign travel getting costlier. There rsquo;s nothing wow for me

 What rsquo;s the ouch factor in the budget? For actors like us, service tax is a big thing. Whatever we earn, 30% goes as income-tax, then you have service tax and we even pay 10% to our managers. So it rsquo;s like 50% is 

 gone just like that. It rsquo;s like two of us 

 have gone for a meal at a five-star hotel 

 and the government is eating the meal 

 with us. 

 Anything you rsquo;d have liked the finance minister to do and he did or didn rsquo;t: By bringing down the price of small 

 cars, more people would be buying cars. That would mean more traffic, which in turn would mean increased pollution. So that rsquo;s something I didn rsquo;t expect 

 Prefer to invest in: real estate, gold and jewellery, stock market, mutual funds, bank deposits, bonds. And why? I primarily invest in mutual funds. Although I have started trying out the stock market, I rsquo;m not so much into shares because I find it very scary

 Do you rely on 

 professional advisers or 

 decide yourself? I decide myself with a little help from here and there

 Advice for amateur 

 investor: No comments

 Cyrus Broacha

 Average annual income (say last five years): Cannot be disclosed. Company pays me so little that it wouldn rsquo;t be polite to do so

 Average annual tax paid (say last five years): Same thing

 What rsquo;s the wow factor in the budget? Petrol price hasn rsquo;t gone up. But it rsquo;s conditional happiness, like being with a girl who is about to break up. The rest I will read in the papers tomorrow

 What rsquo;s the ouch factor in the budget? Service tax. Perhaps, Chidambaram didn rsquo;t take the right 

 medication, or it was the heat. But otherwise, things that 

 affect me, which usually affect a five-year-old, like sweets, are 

 unaffected

 Prefer to invest in: real estate, gold and jewellery, stock market, mutual funds, bank deposits, bonds. And why? My father handles them. He rsquo;s older 

 Any wild idea or place you simply would love to invest in? An adult magazine. Gambling should be legalised

 investor: Stop buying unnecessary stuff. Or, 

 invest in me

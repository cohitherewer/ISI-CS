 RBI takes price punch in stride

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Oct. 30: Inflation is riding at a four-month high but the Reserve Bank is no longer spooked by the bugbear.

 The central bank today said though inflation movements this year have been largely driven by the prices of primary food articles, headline inflation has been contained so far.

 Pundits, who try to second guess which way Reserve Bank governor Yaga Venugopal Reddy and his coven tilt tomorrow on the crucial question of raising short-term interest rates, are drawing a lot of comfort from the RBI statement.

 Many now expect that the Reserve Bank will not tinker with the short-term reverse repo rate in its mid-term review of monetary policy. 

 The Macroeconomic and Monetary Developments: Mid-Term Review 2006-07 document, which precedes the policy event, saw the central bank stating that inflation expectations remained largely stable so far this year, reflecting the success of the pre-emptive monetary policy and fiscal measures.

 The RBI did not make any forecast on how inflation would shape up in the months to come in the report, even as data released last week has showed that annual inflation has risen to 5.27 per cent. This comes close to the central banks upper limit of 5.5 per cent set for the year. 

 It may be recalled that the RBI has targeted to contain the year-on-year inflation rate for 2006-07 in the range of 5 to 5.5 per cent.

 The report said though headline inflation remained within the indicative trajectory of 5 to 5.5 per cent, underlying (crude oil and food article prices) inflationary pressures continued. However, there are other items that could give more consolation on the inflation front.

 According to the central bank, the pass-through of international oil prices to domestic prices in a phased manner amid the burden-sharing strategy by oil companies as well as duty reductions also mitigated the immediate cost push impact of international crude oil prices.

 More importantly, the report indicated that inflation would have been higher, had it not been for the corporate houses not passing on the rise in input costs to their consumers. 

 Competitive pressures, corporate profitability and productivity gains in several sectors enabled corporate houses to absorb a part of the higher input costs into their profit margins. This has partially helped in abating the second order effects of higher oil prices and contained manufactured product inflation, the report noted.

 However, there are other factors 

 to worry about. The report said that broad money (M3) growth, 

 on a year-on-year basis, accelerated to 19.0 per cent as 

 on October 13 from 16.8 per cent a year ago.

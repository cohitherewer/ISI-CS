 Wheat scare whets hunger for paddy

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 Food for thought

 New Delhi, June 21: Worried over depleted wheat stocks, the cabinet committee on prices will meet tomorrow to discuss the proposal to raise procurement prices for paddy and give more autonomy to Food Corporation of India to buy at still higher prices from the market.

 The government will also broaden its procurement initiatives. Besides the north Indian states of Punjab and Haryana along with western Uttar Pradesh, paddy purchase operations will be beefed up in Bengal and Andhra Pradesh.

 The cabinet note proposes a Rs 50 per quintal bonus and a Rs 10 per quintal price hike in rice. Given that sufficient wheat could not be procured despite the bonus of Rs 50, the government intends to empower the FCI and other agencies to buy rice at even higher prices to stall private traders like Cargill. 

 The government is the largest buyer of grain in the country, for the public distribution system and use as buffer stocks during shortage. 

 The proposed move to raise paddy procurement prices to Rs 660 a quintal is a result of rising grain prices in mandis. Wheat prices have shot up 40 per cent in the past one year with private traders managing to corner most of the stocks. 

 On April 1, against a norm of 4 million tonnes (mt) of wheat stocks, the government had just 1.8 mt as buffer. Buffer stock of rice, however, at 13.6 million tonne was more than the norm of 1.22 million tonne.

 India produces between 90-100 million tonne of rice a year and consumes around 80-85 million tonne. The incentive plan may not be needed if rains are normal to encourage farmers to sell rice to the government. 

 However, the incentives and the emphasis on states such as Bengal and Andhra Pradesh are good news for farmers.

 New Delhi, Feb. 20: Petroleum secretary M.S. Srinivasan today said the price at which exporting countries were willing to supply natural gas has emerged as the key issue that would determine the success or failure of trade talks on the issue. 

 Delivering the keynote address at the Asia gas partnership summit organised by GAIL, he said the affordability by the importing country is a key issue and the whole trade revolves around the price.

 Inaugurating the summit, petroleum minister Murli Deora said the government would have to extend sovereign guarantees to the funds needed to be raised to lay transnational pipelines from Iran, Turkmenistan and Myanmar for the import of natural gas to feed the growing economy.

 Transnational pipelines require large investments for which various international institutions and multilateral agencies have to pool their resources together. However, such investments would require guarantee from the governments, he said.

 According to Deora, a regulator for the downstream petroleum and natural gas sector and a natural gas pipeline policy would be announced soon. 

 Deora said these measures would provide a non-discriminatory and transparent platform, which would give further impetus to the overall development of the natural gas sector in the country in a more organised manner.

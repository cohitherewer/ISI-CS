 Dofasco selloff plan hits roadblock

 Brussels, Nov. 13 (AP): Arcelor Mittal said Monday that an independent trust controlling Dofasco Inc has refused to allow its sale, thwarting plans by the worlds biggest steel producer to divest the Canadian steelmaker and soothe US antitrust concerns.

 It may also spark legal action from Germanys ThyssenKrupp AG, which warned that it would exhaust every possibility to see Mittal abide by a deal to sell it. 

 Mittal is legally bound by a US Department of Justice decree to shed Dofasco by November 28 although that deadline can be extended by another 60 days.

 Mittal Steel Co NV had previously said that if it could not solve US worries by disposing of Dofasco, its first choice would be to sell its plant in Weirton, West Virginia, although it has not made a final decision between that and Sparrows Point one of its largest US facilities near Baltimore, Maryland.

 Dofasco is a painful hangover from Arcelors bitter battle against Mittals takeover bid earlier this year. Determined to protect its new acquisition from being sold off if Mittal prevailed, the Arcelor management locked it into an independent trust based in the Netherlands that would need to agree any resale.

 Arcelor finally agreed to the Mittal merger this summer and the boards of both companies recommended Dofasco be sold. But the trust, or stichting, has now vetoed that decision.

 Arcelor Mittal has been informed that the directors of the Strategic Steel Stichting, the Dutch foundation that holds the shares of Dofasco Inc, decided on November 10 not to dissolve the foundation, which would have permitted the sale of Dofasco, the company said in a statement.

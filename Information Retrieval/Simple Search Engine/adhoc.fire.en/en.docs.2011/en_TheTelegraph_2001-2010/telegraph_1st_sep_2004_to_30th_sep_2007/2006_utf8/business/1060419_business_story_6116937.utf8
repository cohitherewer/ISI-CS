 India: The new Oracle on infotech

 JOE BOLGER

 Here and now

 London, April 18: Silicon Valley is in the danger of losing its crown as home of the technology start-up, according to one of the software industrys leading executives.

 Jeff Henley, chairman of Oracle, the worlds second-largest software group, believes that India is on course to become the new hotbed of innovation.

 Henley says Americas strong track record as a developer of software will weaken in the next few years, amid burgeoning activity in Indian cities such as Mumbai, Bangalore and Chennai.

 The US has been a big developer of software . . . but thats going to change over time, he said. Were going to see more and more (technology) from Indian companies.

 Henley said the growing prominence of India would have an impact on where Oracle, which has made a string of multibillion-dollar acquisitions in recent years, would seek new acquisition targets. Well buy from wherever the product is. It doesnt have to be in the US, he said.

 Last August, Oracle bought a 41 per cent stake in i-flex, an Indian provider of software to the financial services industry. It has since made increases to its stake in the company, but Henley said it had no intention of taking full control. 

 Last year, Oracle also took control of PeopleSoft, a rival business software group, for $10.5 billion. It also agreed to pay $5.8 billion for Siebel, another rival. Last week, it agreed on a $220 million (?124 million) deal to buy Portal Software, which makes billing software.

 International technology groups are showing a growing interest in buying Indian groups. Last week EDS, the American IT services group, made a $380-million offer to take a 52 per cent stake in MphasiS, a Bangalore-based services group.

 Indian IT groups, the biggest of which have excelled in delivering basic data entry and administration services, increasingly are moving into more demanding and profitable areas of work, including high-level software development.

 Universities across Asia are turning out well-educated engineers and science graduates, helping to meet the growing demands of the industry. Despite high wage inflation, Indian workers still command salaries that are, in many cases, barely 30 per cent of the equivalent salaries in developed economies.

 Indian companies have also benefited from India-born workers returning home from jobs in America and elsewhere.

 Panel defers sales tax phaseout

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Sept. 23: The empowered committee on VAT today decided to postpone the phaseout of the central sales tax (CST) to April 2007 as it failed to arrive at an agreement with the Union government on the package to compensate states for the revenue loss involved. 

 Central sales tax and value-added tax cannot co-exist. CST has to go subject to the full compensation package for loss in revenues to states on account of the phaseout. Unfortunately, convergence could not be reached on the issue, empowered committee chairman Asim Dasgupta said here.

 The empowered committee of state finance ministers is deferring the phaseout to the next fiscal for the second time. However, the reduction is proposed to be restored to 2 per cent as was originally planned.

 CST is scheduled to be reduced to 1 per cent during 2008-09 and then entirely removed during 2009-10, Dasgupta said after the committees five-hour meeting. The CST phaseout will be reviewed before reducing it to 1 per cent in 2008-09, he added.

 CST is imposed on inter-state trade of goods and was originally scheduled to be scaled down to 2 per cent from 4 per cent at the beginning of this fiscal as part of the phasing out process. 

 However, the proposal was mellowed down to a 3 per cent reduction and the scheduled date was extended from April 1 to October 1 this year.

 The fate of the phasing out has remained largely undecided with the states and the Centre failing to hit upon a common compensation package in spite of the fact that CST is not in accordance with the VAT structure. 

 The states have asked for authority to impose VAT on imports, increase in states share in devolution of services tax to 50 per cent from 30.5 per cent, bringing in 68 services under the state tax-net and imposition of VAT on sugar, textiles and tobacco from 2007-08 as a compensation package. They have also asked for some budgetary support from the Centre. 

 Sources said the finance ministry is averse to budgetary support since the states would ask for compensation all the time even if their revenues increase due to VAT.

 The states that feel they have not been given their due share from the Union tax kitty are keen to raise more revenues so that they can undertake their development schemes. 

 The finance ministry, on the other hand, is worried about the fiscal deficit spinning out of control and is not ready to give tax concessions easily.

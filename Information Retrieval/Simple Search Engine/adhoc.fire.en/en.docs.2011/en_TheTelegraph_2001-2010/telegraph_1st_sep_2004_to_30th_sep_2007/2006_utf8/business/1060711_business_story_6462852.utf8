 Going gets tough for Indian Oil in Lanka

 S.P.S. PANNU 

 Behuria: Bad time

 New Delhi, July 10: Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) has run into rough weather in Sri Lanka with some of its pumps running dry due to the cash crunch caused by the governments inability to meet its commitments vis-?-vis under-recovery of fuel prices.

 It appears that Lanka is arm-twisting IOC to sell petrol and diesel at subsidised prices. The company operates in Sri Lanka through the subsidiary Lanka IOC.

 A senior IOC official told The Telegraph that fresh supplies were being rushed from Haldia and Chennai to Lanka. Reports from Colombo say Lanka oil minister A.H.M. Fowzie has given IOC a 30-day ultimatum to resume sales or risk its assets being taken over by the government.

 IOC chairman Sarthak Behuria, however, denied receiving any notice from the Lankan government to take over its facilities.

 There is an outstanding amount of $70 million in subsidies. The government has given us revised pricing and subsidy proposals that are being legally examined. We hope the issue will be sorted out soon, he said.

 Behuria admitted that some of IOCs outlets ? the company has 162 outlets in Lanka ? have run out of petrol due to lack of money. Till the outstanding amount is cleared and the cash position improves, the company will continue to live in hand-to-mouth conditions, he said.

 IOCs Sri Lankan subsidiary is facing a severe cash crunch. As and when funds are available, Lanka IOC will import petrol and diesel for sale through the retail outlets, Behuria said.

 A senior IOC official said a tanker from Haldia would reach Trincomalee with 7,000 tonnes of petrol and 15,000 tonnes of diesel in the next four or five days.

 Another consignment of 10,000 tonnes of petrol and 18,000 tonnes of diesel will be despatched from the Chennai refinery. The fuel will reach Colombo by August 1. 

 The official said Lanka has no system in place to tackle the problem of under-recovery, arising from spiralling prices of crude and the political necessity to keep fuel prices in check, unlike in India where the government not only issued oil bonds but also directed upstream companies to share part of the burden.

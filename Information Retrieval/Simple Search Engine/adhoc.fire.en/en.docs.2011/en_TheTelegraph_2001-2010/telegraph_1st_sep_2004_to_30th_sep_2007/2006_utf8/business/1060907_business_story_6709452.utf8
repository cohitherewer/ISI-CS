 Natco to buy back shares

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Sept. 6: Hyderabad-based Natco Pharma would begin a share buyback programme on September 12 for a price of up to Rs 150 per share, aggregating Rs 7 crore. The buyback is being done to increase shareholder value by returning surplus cash to the companys shareholders.

 Natco Pharma said at the maximum price of Rs 150 per share and for the buyback size of Rs 7 crore, close to 4.67 lakh shares would be bought back. Following the programme, promoter holding, which now stands at 61.22 per cent, would go up.

 Natco said the aggregate maximum consideration for the shares to be bought back will not exceed 10 per cent of the total paid-up equity capital and free reserves of the company on March 31, 2006.

 The buyback is being proposed in keeping with the companys desire to maximise returns to investors and increase overall shareholder value by returning surplus cash to them in an investor-friendly manner. The company has accumulated free reserves and satisfactory liquidity. The buyback is expected to lead to reduction of outstanding equity shares, which may lead to increase in earnings per share and return on equity of the company in future, thereby creating long-term shareholder value for the continuing shareholders. The proposed buyback is also a reflection of confidence of the management in the future growth prospects of the company, the company added.

 Natco is present in active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and chemical intermediates; finished dosage pharmaceutical formulations and contract manufacturing. It has five manufacturing facilities in Andhra Pradesh.

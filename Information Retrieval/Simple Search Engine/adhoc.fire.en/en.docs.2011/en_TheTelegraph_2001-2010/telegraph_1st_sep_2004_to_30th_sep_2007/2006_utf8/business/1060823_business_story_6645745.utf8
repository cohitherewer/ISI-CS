 Key meet to review SEZ rules

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 22: The empowered group of ministers is expected to meet tomorrow to discuss issues relating to special economic zones (SEZ) that are being set up.

 The group, chaired by defence minister Pranab Mukherjee, will go through the SEZ guidelines to see whether these can be finetuned to allow more concessions to industry and whether the ceiling on the number of zones can be raised from the existing cap of 150.

 There are over 200 applications pending with the commerce ministry from various state governments and commerce minister Kamal Nath is keen to raise the cap so that these can be accommodated.

 The minister feels additional zones should be allowed to come up as they would generate more jobs and give a fillip to exports. This would increase potential investments in SEZs by another $5 billion from the current $6 billion in the 150 proposals cleared so far.

 However, the great rush by India Inc to set up special economic zones has also given rise to some misgivings regarding land acquisition. 

 Earlier this month, the inter-ministerial board asked the Maharashtra government to take a second look at the land being acquired for the 10,000-hectare SEZ of Reliance Industries in Mumbai.

 The empowered group of ministers on SEZs could consider a one-to-two-year ban on setting up of more information technology (IT) zones. Of the 150 zones approved so far, over 70 are in the IT sector.

 The board also questioned the Tamil Nadu government on the use of double-cropped land for a SEZ following a representation from farmers. The state government said only single-cropped or barren land would be used.

 Since companies are investing in SEZs mainly for tax breaks, it is feared that they will have an adverse impact on other investments planned.

 The finance ministry is concerned about the Rs 1,58,000 crore spent each year on tax breaks to existing units and wants to bring these to an end. Therefore, any move to increase the number of SEZs has to be accompanied by an exercise to determine its cost-benefit ratio. 

 It is important to assess the net benefit the country gets from tax concessions given to the existing units, and from those being extended to special economic zones.

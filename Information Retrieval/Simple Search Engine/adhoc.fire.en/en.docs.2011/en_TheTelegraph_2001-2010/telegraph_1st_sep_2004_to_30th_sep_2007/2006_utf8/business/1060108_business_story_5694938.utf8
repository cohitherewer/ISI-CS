 Moratorium on Kolhapur bank

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Jan. 7: Ganesh Bank of Kurundwad Ltd, a private bank based in Kolhapur district of Maharashtra, has been placed under moratorium by the central government. This came after the bank?s net worth and capital adequacy ratio turned negative, resulting in the erosion of depositors? money. The bank was also unable to come up with any credible plan to raise fresh capital.

 The moratorium came after an application was filed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). A press statement issued by the central bank said the order (moratorium) was passed by the Centre in public interest.

 The moratorium will be effective from the close of business on Saturday up to and inclusive of April 6, 2006 or an earlier date if alternative arrangements are put in place. The RBI added that during this period, it would consider various options, including an amalgamation of the bank with another bank and finalise plans to protect public deposits.

 During the moratorium period, the bank will be allowed to make only those payments that are specified in the order. 

 The depositors of the bank will also be permitted to withdraw money up to Rs 5,000 a day from their savings bank account or current account or any other deposit account in the bank. The customers can withdraw up to the limit specified from any of the branches of Ganesh Bank, the apex bank added.

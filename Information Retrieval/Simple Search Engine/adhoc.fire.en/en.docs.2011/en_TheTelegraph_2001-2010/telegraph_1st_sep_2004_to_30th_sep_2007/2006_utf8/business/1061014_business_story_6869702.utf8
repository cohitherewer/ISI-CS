 Landmark pact bulldozes hurdles to trade with EU

 Helsinki, Oct. 13: India and the European Union on Friday decided to enter into a path-breaking trade and investment agreement that will go beyond the current rules of global trade under the World Trade Organisation (WTO).

 The agreement, aimed at removing obstacles to trade and lowering investment barriers, will be the biggest-ever such pact for India. The EU is Indias largest trading partner, accounting for one-fifth of its external trade.

 The agreement will free 90 per cent of tariff lines and trade volume between India and Europe. Negotiations are expected to last two years, although the business community wants them concluded in a year.

 The agreement will be outside the scope of WTO negotiations. It expressly hopes to go beyond WTO rules and, therefore, has the potential of shaping future international trade negotiations.

 Describing the decision to enter into negotiations for the agreement as the highlight of the EU-India Summit and a win-win situation for both, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said, This is indeed a significant step that will build on the complementarities in the trade flows between the two sides.

 While commerce minister Kamal Nath seemed reluctant to describe the pact as a free trade agreement preferring to call it an important trade engagement European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso said the agreement was essentially a free trade agreement. He seemed to suggest that it was not described as such because it also covered investment. 

 EU trade commissioner Peter Mendelson said, We will each gain, but so will the rest of the world because any agreement between us will set new standards for openness and global trade rules.

 The agreement is ambitious and aims not only at freeing trade in goods and services but also investment. It will address issues of public procurement, improving the rules on the protection of intellectual property rights, issues of competition and dispute settlement.

 The agreement will go beyond WTO addressing areas such as improving conditions for trade in services, tackling non-tariff barriers or rules in areas such as investment, competition and public procurement. These are areas where WTO rules do not yet fully apply. However, both India and EU were at pains to point out that the agreement should be seen as a stepping stone and not as a stumbling block for further multilateral liberalisation.

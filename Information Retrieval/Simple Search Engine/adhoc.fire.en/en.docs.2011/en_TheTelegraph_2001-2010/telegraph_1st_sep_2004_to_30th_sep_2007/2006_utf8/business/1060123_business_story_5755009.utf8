 Jet-lag in Sahara Airlines numbers

Commentary on Jet?s takeover of Sahara Airlines suffers from the grave defect that Sahara Airlines?s financials are not public knowledge. Reporters have, therefore, used their sources to get the figures, and the numbers given differ. Even the market share figures vary, with some analysts putting Jet?s share after the acquisition at 50 per cent or thereabouts, while Naresh Goyal puts it at 41 per cent.

 Nevertheless, the consensus is that, at $500 million, the multiple at which Sahara has been valued, whether it is EV/EBITDAR or market cap/EBITDAR or some other metric, is well below that of Jet. Thats not much to go on, and that seems to be the opinion of the market as well ? after the initial knee-jerk reaction, there has been a complete lack of euphoria on the deal. As a matter of fact, after moving up on Thursday after the deal was announced, the Jet stock fell 2 per cent on Friday, closing at Rs 1125, the same level it was on March 14, 2005. 

 Essentially, the stock has gone nowhere since listing, severely underperforming the sensex, and the Sahara deal has made no difference.

 But perhaps the conventional valuation measures miss the point. Yes, of course they matter, as does the tax cushion. 

 But the way to consider the valuation is that, given the severe infrastructure constraints such as the lack of parking bays or prime slots or even the shortage of pilots, Jet?s growth plans would have been stymied if it chose to grow organically. Reports indicate that Sahara Airlines has access to about 17 per cent of available night parking facilities at its hubs at Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Calcutta and Hyderabad. Its right to 22 bays at airports, prime time slots, hangars and even business lounges make it an attractive target. These assets are scarce commodities at the moment and its well worth paying a premium for them. 

 No wonder that some of the smaller airlines have voiced their concerns about the monopolisation of scarce airport infrastructure. 

 Simply put, given the lack of infrastructure, it makes sense for any airline to acquire Sahara?s facilities, even if a premium had to be paid.

 IT results

 The big four IT services companies have all declared their results, and three of them ? TCS, Wipro and Satyam, have beaten analysts expectations. 

 That doesn?t, however, seem to have made much of a difference to the sector as a whole. At the close of trading on Friday, the BSE IT index was lower by 2.3 per cent compared with its opening level at the beginning of 2006. That?s against a gain of 1 per cent for the sensex over the period. 

 Infosys is lower by 6.3 per cent, TCS is down 3.8 per cent, Satyam is flat and only Wipro has moved up 6.9 per cent between the stocks opening on January 2 and the January 20 closing.

 Satyam has comfortably beaten third-quarter guidance and improved its full year guidance. 

 Wipro too beat its guidance and had the highest ever customer adds in the last quarter. 

 After Infosys? initial scare, all the other big companies showed that they had been able to manage or offset their forex risk. 

 But perhaps the most heartening aspect of recent developments in the IT space has been the increasing acceptance of Indian vendors in large multi-million dollar and multi-year contracts, as seen from the ABN Amro and DSG International deals. That means the relatively lower-valued IT stocks should see some upside.

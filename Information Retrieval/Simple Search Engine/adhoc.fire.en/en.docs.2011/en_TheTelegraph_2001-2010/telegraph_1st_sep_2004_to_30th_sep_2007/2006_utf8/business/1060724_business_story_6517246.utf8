 Qualcomm to check out royalty

 Mumbai, July 23 (PTI): Under pressure from investors and major revenue contributors, chipmaker Qualcomm may commence fresh round of talks with CDMA operators, including Reliance Communications, as the companys market share has declined sharply.

 The San Diego-based technology firm, facing the ire of third-world CDMA operators for higher royalty charges, hinted that the negotiations with the operators are likely to start soon. I think thats going to continue and theres a lot of negotiating back and forth thats currently happening, Qualcomm CEO Paul Jacobs told analysts after announcing the firms results last week.

 Qualcomm has lost market capitalisation to the tune of Rs 1,21,500 crore ($27 billion) in the last 10 weeks.

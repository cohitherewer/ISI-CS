 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bangalore, July 12: Infosys will become a $3-billion company ? probably by June 2007, if not earlier.

 The Bangalore-based information technology giant became a $1-billion company in 2004 to scale the $2-billion peak in March 2006.

 The company today projected that it would close fiscal 2006-07 ? which ends in March next year ? with consolidated revenues of $2.91 billion to $2.92 billion, a year-on-year growth of almost 26 per cent. The consolidated earnings per American depositary share is expected to grow by almost 34 per cent to anywhere between $2.70 and $2.73.

 In rupee terms, the company is projecting an income of between Rs 13,350 crore and Rs 13,400 crore in the year ending March 31, 2007, translating into a year-on-year growth of over 40 per cent. It also expects an earnings per share (EPS) between Rs 124.51 and Rs 125.74, a year-on-year growth of over 39 per cent.

 Infosys is the second largest software services exporter after TCS.

 The company, which is hoping to hire 25,000 new employees this fiscal, beat forecasts with an almost 50 per cent jump in net profit at Rs 794 crore and a 45.6 per cent surge in income at Rs 3,015 crore for the period ended June 30.

 Infosys chief executive officer Nandan Nilekani said they were surprised by the strong showing in the first quarter which beat the guidance the company gave back in April when it had forecast an EPS of Rs 113.85 to Rs 115.61 for the year ending March 31, 2007.

 The almost Rs 10 jump in the EPS forecast for the year has been attributed to strong organic growth and the depreciation of the rupee, which fell over 3 per cent during the first quarter against the greenback.

 We benefited from the depreciation of the rupee against all major currencies during the quarter, said V. Balakrishnan, chief financial officer. Our margins have been maintained, despite an increase in salaries and visa costs. We continue to focus on margins without compromising on investments needed to meet our growth objectives. 

 The company is hoping to maintain the pace of growth in the second quarter (July-September) as well with income projected to be in the range of Rs 3,357 crore and Rs 3,280 crore, a year-on-year growth of close to 43 per cent. 

 Balakrishnan said the company was able to maintain its margins despite an increase in salaries and visa costs.

 The pricing environment will be stable with an upward bias, said Balakrishnan. New customers are coming in at slightly better prices. He added that business from Europe ? especially the UK ? was growing at a faster rate than the US.

 Infosys shares closed at Rs 3,386.45 on the Bombay Stock Exchange, a gain of 7.5 per cent.

 Under the US GAAP, the company posted a net income of $174 million in the first quarter against $122 million last year during the same quarter, registering a year-on-year growth of 43 per cent.

 EPS for this first quarter has increased by 46 per cent to Rs 28.71 from Rs 19.63 under the Indian GAAP.

 Our efforts in building the brand, developing the client base and expanding strategic accounts have fuelled our robust organic model, Nilekani said in a statement.

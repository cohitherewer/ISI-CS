The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Expect a hike, but not like last year

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 7: The 10th annual salary survey conducted by Hewitt Associates expects salaries in India to rise 13.8 per cent this year, a marginal drop from last year?s figure of 14.1 per cent. 

 The survey also shows that salaries in India are gradually getting stabilised and no major upward swing has been noticed since 2004. 

 ?Though there has been an upward swing in salaries since 2002, the past two years have seen salaries stablising with no sudden inflections since 2004,? said Nishchae Suri, Asia Pacific business consulting leader with Hewitt Associates.

 Interestingly, the survey demonstrated that locally owned organisations are giving higher salary increases than multinational companies in India. In 2005, locally owned organisations saw an overall salary increase of 14.7 per cent, while foreign owned organisations saw an overall increase of 13.8 per cent and the trend is expected to continue this year. 

 ?As homegrown organisations attempt to be more global and capture larger customer bases domestically and around the world, the need for good talent becomes critical. Locally owned organisations are now beginning to align their compensation practices to global standards, strengthen their reward management practices and focus on pay for performance to attract and retain talent, and enhance overall productivity,? said Suri. 

 The survey covered 29 industries, 652 countries and 9,00,000 employees. It was conducted to measure actual and projected salary increases, and compensation packages of five specific job categories, namely ? senior/top management, manager, professional/supervisor/technical, clerical/support and manual workers. 

 The survey projected that asset management companies (AMCs) would witness the highest salary growth in 2006, followed by information technology and IT enabled services.

 Projections for these industries for 2006 stand at 16.6 per cent (AMC), 16 per cent (IT) and 15.4 per cent (ITes).

 ?At 17.1 per cent, AMCs in India awarded the highest average salary increases in 2005. Close behind were the IT (16.5 per cent) and IT enabled services (16.1 per cent),? the survey said.

 Industries with lowest salary increases in 2005 were not-for-profit (9.5 per cent) and banking (9.9 per cent).

 The professional/supervisor/technical employees can expect the highest salary hike of 15.1 per cent this year primarily because of the large availability of jobs across all industries and sectors.

 In Asia, India recorded the strongest trend in salary growth of 14.1 per cent, ahead of the Philippines (8.2 per cent), and China (8.1 per cent).

 Suri said in 99.5 per cent of companies surveyed it was found that they have a very effective performance management system.

 ?Companies are increasingly focussed on measuring and managing performance with 99.5 per cent saying they have formal platforms for performance management, and a growing number of companies saying they are conducting bi-annual performance reviews,? he said.

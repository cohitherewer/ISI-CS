 UTI Mutual bets big on new fund

 GAURAV CHOUDHURY

 New Delhi, Jan. 22: UTI Mutual Fund is betting big on the emerging derivatives market and plans to launch a dedicated derivatives fund in February.

 Our fund managers are working on the fund and hopefully by next month we will be able to launch a specialised derivatives fund, a senior official of UTI Mutual Fund told The Telegraph.

 Derivatives is a financial instrument, whose value is derived from the value of one or more underlying assets. The underlying assets can be commodities, precious metals, currency, bonds, stocks or stock indices.

 The derivatives market in India has seen major growth in 2005. It has grown by 46 per cent in the calendar year 2005 compared with the previous year. Active participation from foreign institutional investors (FIIs) and the increase in the number of stocks in derivatives products have helped this growth. 

 The volume has grown from Rs 11,098.74 crore contracts to Rs 18,608.36 crore with the cumulative value recording an increase of about 50 per cent.

 Among the derivatives market, except stock options all the other three segments ? index futures, index options, stock futures ? have shown increased participation. UTI, the countrys largest mutual fund, is planning to launch a series of new funds this year. 

 The derivatives market in India is poised for an expansion and upsurge after the Reserve Bank of India is empowered to regulate transactions in derivatives, the UTI official said.

 While derivatives transactions in commodities and underlying assets are conducted through the stock exchanges, credit derivatives (loans and debts as underlying assets) are transacted through banking institutions. The official said that derivatives market would enter a boom phase once trading in credit derivatives are allowed for all. 

 Bankers said credit derivatives would imply that loans and debt obligations act as an underlying asset and widen the scope of the derivatives market manifold. With rapid rise of Indian financial markets, sooner or later, the credit derivative market is bound to happen in India. This is where we want to make a head-start by launching a dedicated derivatives fund, the UTI official said.

 Aviva acquires US life insurer

 London, July 13 (Reuters): Aviva Plc has agreed to pay $2.9 billion (?1.6 billion) in cash for US life insurer AmerUs Group Co to boost its undersized presence in the United States and tap its lucrative retirement market. 

 Britains biggest insurer said on Thursday it would pay $69 a share, a 10 per cent premium to AmerUss closing price on July 6, the day before the two firms confirmed they were in talks.

 Aviva said it would pay for the deal in part with a fully underwritten placing of 129 million new shares at 700 pence apiece, raising about 900 million pounds. 

 The acquisition of AmerUs fulfils Avivas objectives in the US long-term savings market, Aviva Chief Executive Richard Harvey said in a call with journalists. 

 The deal is the latest in a series in the industry as top firms seek to bulk up or use some of their excess cash to strengthen weak spots in their businesses. 

 Aviva also said trading in the first half of its financial year had been strong, with operating profit for the period on a European embedded value (EEV) basis up to at least 1.65 billion pounds versus 1.32 billion in the same period last year. 

 Aviva shares were down 2.2 per cent at 697-1/2 pence by 11:27 am, below a 1.6 per cent fall in the index of European insurers. The stock has fallen 12 per cent since the end of March.

 The company, whose ?17-billion bid for UK rival Prudential Plc was rebuffed in March, has said it wanted to expand in the United States, from where it currently gets only 4 per cent of its sales outside Britain.

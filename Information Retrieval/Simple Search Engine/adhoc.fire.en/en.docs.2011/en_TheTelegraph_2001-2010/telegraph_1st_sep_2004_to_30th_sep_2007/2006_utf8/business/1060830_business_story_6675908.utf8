 Oil cop trashes Anil charges

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Aug. 29: The director-general of hydrocarbons (DGH) today debunked the Anil Ambani groups charges of unfairness in the allocation of the 10 coal-bed methane blocks to bidders.

 He said the Anil Ambani group (ADAG) never questioned the bid criteria before the tender closed. 

 Director-general of hydrocarbons V.K. Sibal said the award of the blocks was made strictly according to the norms of offer document.

 If certain bid evaluation criteria were unclear, why did it (ADAG) not ask for clarification, Sibal said.

 He said there were queries on the evaluation norms from most bidders during the bid period of February to June but none from ADAG.

 Sibal said ADAG raised doubts on the three mark criteria in the two blocks, which it lost to the Arrow led consortium, only after the end of the evaluation on July 28. The ADAG-led combine, comprising Reliance Natural Resources and Reliance Energy of the group and Geopetrol, won the rights for four of the 10 blocks. 

 The petroleum ministry had earlier rejected the claims of the consortium of being kept in the dark about the evaluation parameters till the submission of the bids. The ministry said there was no discrimination and its decisions were open to scrutiny.

 Sibal said the evaluation committee objected to the technical and fiscal package of ADAG and had doubts of ADAGs capability to implement the ambitious proposals in its bid. He said, I put my foot down and told my officers that we want to encourage new entrants. 

 I have come here to create trust and transparency in the system. I am not favouring or disfavouring anyone. For me the most important issue is prospecting of oil and gas. Everyone is equal and is evaluated on the same parameters, he said.

 He said of the 20 marks assigned to technical capability to rate the bid, two were for a firms technical assessment of the block and one for undertaking other work programmes like new technology. 

 The notice inviting offers clearly states that the two marks will be given based on assessment made by the DGH.

 It further stated that information on the technical assessment by the bidder should comprise information about the geological parameters upon which the bidders application for a block is based, accompanied by structural maps, if feasible. The bidder shall also, in a separate enclosure, furnish a geological study of the area in the regional geological context.

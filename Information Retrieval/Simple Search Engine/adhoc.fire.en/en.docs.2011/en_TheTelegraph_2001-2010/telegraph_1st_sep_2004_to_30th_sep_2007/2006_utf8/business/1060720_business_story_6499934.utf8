 Biocon pins hopes on Insugen tonic

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Shaw: Going places

 Calcutta, July 19: Biocon is in talks with international drug companies for taking its recombinant human insulin ? Insugen ? to Europe and the US.

 The biotech company will enter into licensing agreements with foreign firms for the exclusive marketing and trademark rights of this product.

 Kiran Mazumder Shaw, chairman and managing director of Biocon, said agreements would be signed this fiscal.

 We are working towards it. We will also sign up for Europe and America, Shaw told The Telegraph.

 The company has also begun phase I human clinical trials for its oral insulin molecule IN105.

 Experts say this could be a hit as oral drug delivery system is more popular than injections.

 The trials will establish the proof of concept of its proprietary oral delivery technology, recently acquired from Nobex.

 The studies are expected to be completed by the third quarter of 2006-07 and will be used to support IND filings with international regulatory authorities.

 Meanwhile, Biocon today announced an agreement with Bayer HealthCare (BHC) for exclusive marketing and trademark rights for Insugen for the Chinese market.

 It is likely that this collaboration will be expanded to other countries in Asia Pacific. 

 Insugen is expected to be launched in the next two to three years after completing necessary local registration trials.

 Shaw said the company would get signing and milestone fees this year and the main revenue would flow in from 2008-09.

 The company is also setting up its own sales and marketing network across the country to support its finished dosage business. Biocon has so far been concentrating on the API business.

 Biocon also announced its first-quarter results today. Consolidated sales increased 22 per cent to Rs 212 crore from Rs174 crore in the same period last year.

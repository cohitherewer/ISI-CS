 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, May 16: Graphite India Ltd, a KK Bangur group firm, today reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 68.35 crore for the year ended March 31, 2006, compared with Rs 60.41 crore in the previous fiscal. 

 On a standalone basis, the companys net profit rose to Rs 62.95 crore from Rs 48 crore a year ago.

 Encouraged by its performance against odds like increasing interest rates and the crude price rally, the board has recommended a 60 per cent dividend for 2005-06, up from 45 per cent announced in the previous fiscal.

 The company has performed better during the January-March period than in the previous three quarters of 2005-06.

 Graphite Indias fourth quarter profit has grown significantly to Rs 27.57 crore from Rs 15.16 crore in the corresponding previous quarter, representing an 81.86 per cent growth on a year-on-year basis. 

 While net income from operations during the quarter went up 39.75 per cent to Rs 196.94 crore from Rs 140.92 crore, other income rose to Rs 8.19 crore from Rs 2.81 crore a year ago. 

 Graphite Indias reserves, excluding revaluation reserves, at the end of the last financial year stood higher at Rs 424.61 crore on a stand-alone basis and at Rs 447.13 crore on a consolidated basis. As a result, the companys earnings per share rose to Rs 21.43 from Rs 16.34.

 The German subsidiary of the company, Graphite International BV, has operated at more than its rated capacity during its first full year of operations, the company said.

 The companys income from graphite business has swelled to Rs 724.04 crore in 2005-06 from Rs 524.71 crore a year ago. 

 Graphite India also increased the graphite electrodes manufacturing capacity at its Durgapur plant to 34,000 tonne from 14,000 tonne and the expanded capacity went on stream during the latter half of 2005. 

 Last year was a good business year for graphite electrode manufacturers, as the demand and production for steel, both domestic and international, went up and many steel manufacturers embarked upon capacity expansion through the EAF route that uses graphite electrodes.

 The demand for electrodes is expected to remain strong this fiscal, too, following a healthy demand of steel from infrastructure, automotive and real estate firms. 

 Graphite India is also focussing on power generation. Its hydel power project in Karnataka has given the company a good business last financial year.

 Centre clears 18 FDI proposals

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Aug 22: Global luxury brands Louis Vuitton Malletier and Lifestyles International Holding Corporation figure among the 18 foreign direct investment proposals cleared by the government to bring in Rs 586.123 crore into the country.

 The proposals, approved on the recommendations of the foreign investment promotion board on August 11, also include the revised aggregate foreign holding, both direct and indirect, of 74 per cent in Bharti Airtel.

 A proposal by Mauritius-based Lotus Global Investments Ltd for oil exploration activities is the largest at Rs 345 crore, which is followed by Huntsman Investments of Netherlands for Rs 122.50 crore.

 Among the first company to get clearance for single branded products in retail trading, France-based Louis Vuitton will bring in Rs 5.70 crore. Its products will include pens, diary, refills, paper, shoes, trunks, travel bags, wallets, sunglasses, watches and ready-to- wear garments. 

 Vuittons signature leathergoods are now a status symbol all over the globe and are highly regarded in the fashion world. Unfortunately, Louis Vuitton has become the most counterfeited brand in fashion history.

 Louis Vuitton has carefully cultivated a celebrity following and has used famous models and actresses in its marketing campaigns among them Uma Thurman, Jennifer Lopez, Scarlett Johansson, Kate Moss and Naomi Campbell. 

 Lifestyles International Holding Corporation of Spain will set up a wholly-owned subsidiary to undertake third party contract manufacturing, preferably small scale industries, to manufacture its products in India. It will bring in Rs 4.5 crore as FDI.

 Its proposal also included imports of products for test marketing and export of finished products and training and motivational materials to overseas sister companies.

 Lotus Global received approval to invest for Rs 345 crore for issuing foreign currency convertible bonds for investment in oil exploration activities. Huntsman Investments will bring in Rs 122.50 crore to acquire existing Indian companies.

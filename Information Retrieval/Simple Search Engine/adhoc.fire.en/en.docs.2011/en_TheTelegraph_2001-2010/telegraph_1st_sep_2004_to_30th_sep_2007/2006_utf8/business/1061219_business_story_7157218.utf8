 Bengal bid to step up exports

 Calcutta, Dec. 18: The Bengal government will try to revive its board of trade, which has become non-functional since the turn of the decade, to promote exports. 

 I have taken note of the demand of exporters from this region to revive the board of trade and I think, I will be able to do something to revive it, Bengal industry minister Nirupam Sen said at a function of the Engineering Export Promotion Council, eastern region. 

 The last board meeting of the trade promotion body was in 1999-2000, said EEPC eastern region chairman R.P. Sehgal. 

 Sehgal also said export houses, which are not 100 per cent export-oriented units (EOU), are finding it difficult to get refund of value-added tax on the exported value. While Article 61AA of the value-added tax act says that 100 per cent EOUs will get their refund within two months, the act is silent on those units that are not 100 per cent EOUs, Sehgal added.

 Under the current practice, units that are not 100 per cent EOUs get their VAT refund after two years on completion of the full assessment by the commercial tax department. This delay poses hardship for exporters by increasing their costs. At present, VAT refund worth Rs 12 crore to exporters is pending with the tax department. The state government should look into this anomaly, particularly when states like Punjab give spot refund of VAT to exporters. Exporters from Bengal are facing competition from other states on this count, said Rakesh Shah, national chairman, EEPC.

 This matter comes under the jurisdiction of the commercial tax department and the finance ministry. However, I can tell you I will try to find out how to tackle this issue in consultation with the finance ministry, the minister said in his reply.

 The eastern region accounts for 18-20 per cent of the countrys total engineering exports. In 2005-06, engineering exports from this region was $3.23 billion and this we expect to cross $3.75 billion in the current financial year, Sehgal said. 

 However, EEPC urged exporters to focus on the engineering process outsourcing sector that poses a potential of $40 billion business by 2020.

 While exports at an all India level during the last fiscal went up by 25 per cent, the states growth in exports was lower at 17 per cent.

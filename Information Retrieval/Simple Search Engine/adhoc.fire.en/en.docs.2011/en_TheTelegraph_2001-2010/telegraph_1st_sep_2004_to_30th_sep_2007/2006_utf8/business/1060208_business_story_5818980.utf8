 Mumbai, Feb. 7: Tata Motors is eyeing a slice of the passenger vehicles market of Latin America.

 Official sources said while a team from the company recently visited Venezuela, a Chilean team came to the country for negotiations.

 At present, the companys commercial and passenger vehicles are being marketed in several countries in Europe, Africa, Australia and Asia.

 Tata Motors also has assembly operations in Malaysia, Kenya, Bangladesh, Spain, Ukraine, Russia and Senegal.

 South Africa constitutes a major export market for the company, sources said.

 To increase its share in the global pie, the company exported 4569 vehicles in January compared with 3943 in the year-ago period, an increase of 15.9 per cent.

 However, the company refused to comment on its plans for Latin America.

 The cars would have to undergo modifications for the Latin American market and attempts are on to make them more cost competitive, sources added. 

 Maruti Udyog Limited, a leading carmaker in the country, also exports cars to the Latin American countries and in 2003-04, exports contributed to more than 10 per cent of the total Maruti sales. Europe is the largest export market for the company, which attracts over 70 per cent of its total exports.

 According to an auto report released by Scotiabank, Asia and Latin America will drive the global car sales to record highs in 2006. 

 In 2005, Latin America posted the strongest growth in car sales, with volumes advancing at a double-digit pace for the second consecutive year.

 Back home, Tata Motors sold 20,765 passenger cars in January, a growth of 15 per cent over January 2005. This is also the highest ever monthly sales growth posted by the company.

 Indica sales grew 18.7 per cent to 12640 units ? the highest sales ever in any month ? fuelled by the recently introduced Indica V2 Xeta Petrol and the Indica V2 Turbo Diesel launched in October 2005.

 Around 3865 cars in the Indigo range were sold, registering a growth of 15.6 per cent. 

 The Sumo and the Safari together sold 4260 units, a growth of 5 per cent over January last year.

 The cumulative sales of passenger cars in the domestic market for the fiscal stood at 148275, a growth of 3.7 per cent.

 New feather in mutual cap

 - Fund Houses, Local or global, cash in on bull run

 CHANDRALEKHA TULAL 

 Mumbai, April 2: As the mind-boggling bull run continues and foreign fund managers ride the momentum by pumping loads of cash in local markets, their Indian counterparts are emerging as equals on the performance scale.

 Domestic mutual fund schemes continue to post stellar performances and, according to Bloomberg data based on the last one-year returns as on March 27, 11 of the top 15 Asia-Pacific funds are from India. 

 While the top position in the pecking order has been grabbed by a plan of Mitsui Sumitomo of Japan ? investing in the Japanese markets with a one-year return of 126.49 per cent ? the next 10 ranks are occupied by Indian schemes. The second on the list is SBI Magnum Multiplier Plus with a return of 116.06 per cent, followed by Reliance Power with 113.11 per cent, SBI Magnum Global at 112.99 per cent and SBI Magnum Tax Gain with 112.23 per cent. 

 The others on the list are Pru ICICI FMCG, Pru ICICI Emerging Star, SBI Magnum Contra, Kotak Opportunities, Sundaram India Leadership, SBI Magnum Emerging Businesses and Sundaram Select Midcap funds.

 Against the average returns of 19.85 per cent posted by the Asia-Pacific mutual fund schemes, the equity plans back home have given average returns of over 75 per cent in the last one-year period.

 And why not? Markets rose to record highs yet again last week with the sensex and the nifty gaining 3 per cent and 3.7 per cent respectively. 

 The one-year returns from the indices have been 70.78 per cent and 64.56 per cent respectively. 

 The best part is the hard work of mutual funds is paying off with investors putting their faith and money in them.

 So far this year, 12 new fund offers have collected Rs 16,287 crore, nearly 65 per cent of the total collection by equity funds in 2005.

 Ore deals get a scrub

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Paswan: Across the table

 New Delhi, May 16: Steel minister Ram Vilas Paswan today said India is considering a long-term contract on sale of iron ore to China and the option of renegotiating the deal with Japan.

 ?We are thinking of entering into a minimum five-year-term ore export agreement with China in view of the growing demand there after ascertaining their need,? Paswan said during a seminar on the steel sector here today.

 He said India would renegotiate the ore export deal with Japan as this has become necessary in the wake of higher demand for quality input from domestic steel producers.

 The steel ministry has asked the state-owned National Mineral Development Corporation to drastically cut down its export of iron ore to 1.7 million tonnes (mt) a year from 5.4 mt. More of the input will then be available to steel makers like the Ruias and Jindals whose cravings have multiplied, to feed both their existing plants and new facilities in Gujarat, Orissa, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand. 

 Older steel makers such as SAIL and the Tatas possess captive iron ore mines but newcomers look to state-run NMDC for their supply. NMDC supplies about 16 mt iron ore in domestic markets and exports up to 6 mt of high grade ore.

 Paswan said talks will commence soon with the Japanese to finalise export terms. 

 The minister said globalisation has brought in its wake new types of trade disputes that require government intervention. ?While the WTO has played a key role in resolving such disputes and putting in place a rule-based system for all of us to work together, global trade matters cannot be left on their own. Active interventions were often felt necessary,? he said.

 The steel and commerce ministries have been at the centre of a tug-of-war between advocates for more exports and proponents of curbs. The pro-export group is pointing at the advantages of higher forex earnings and has argued that exports will not affect India?s 22 billion tonne reserve, though only 45 per cent of this can be mined due to various reasons.

 Exports of high grade iron ore to Japan at cheap rates have been a sore point with most domestic steel-makers. They argue that the domestic steel industry is expanding and needs high class ore, a scarce resource the world. 

 The two most sought-after raw material in the global commodities market are high grade iron ore and high class coal, needed for steel. India and Brazil are the only nations that possess such quality ore with an iron content of between 60-65 per cent.

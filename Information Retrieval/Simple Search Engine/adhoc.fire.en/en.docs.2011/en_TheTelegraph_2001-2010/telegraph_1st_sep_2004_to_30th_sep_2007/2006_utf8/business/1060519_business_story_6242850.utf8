 Metals add to meltdown

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, May 18: Base metal rates affected stock prices today and contributed to the downtrend in the market. 

 While the benchmark index had the highest intra-day loss ever, the BSE metal index had the biggest fall, shaving off 1180.75 points or 11 per cent. 

 A steep fall in the base metal prices ? copper slid 4.4 per cent in New York, the lowest since May 9 ? triggered the fall in the Indian metal stocks today. 

 The losses were further aided by the disappointing results by steel major Tata Steel, which posted a 14 per cent lower net profit at Rs 783 crore for the fourth quarter of 2005-06 against Rs 909 in the year-ago period. 

 Tata Steel and Hindalco were among the top five losers today. 

 Tata Steel dropped by Rs 66.80, or 10.91 per cent, to Rs 545.45. The scrip attracted 257 block deals in about 1.40 crore shares on both the bourses. 

 Hindalco lost Rs 26.10 or 11.97 per cent to close at Rs 191.95, despite a price hike in aluminium recently. 

 All the markets are now inter-linked and any positive or negative cues from each market gets reflected in the other, said Naresh Kothari, head-institutional equities, Edelweiss Capital. 

 There is serious volatility in the base metal prices as they have gone up sharply, which is again getting reflected in the share prices, said Kothari. 

 The copper prices continue to be under pressure and the next few trading sessions will be marked by extreme volatility, said Sunil Ramrakhiani, head, IL amp;FS Investsmart Commodities. 

 In LME, three-month copper swung within a $600 a metric ton range in a display of volatility typical of the recent daily trading pattern. 

 Copper prices dipped back below $8,000/tonne in early morning trading before sentiment swung to the upside, driven by evidence of further stock drawdowns in LME warehouse inventories of copper. 

 Nickel was the only metal to buck the downward trend, finishing late kerb in London up $555 on previous kerb at $21,000/tonne.

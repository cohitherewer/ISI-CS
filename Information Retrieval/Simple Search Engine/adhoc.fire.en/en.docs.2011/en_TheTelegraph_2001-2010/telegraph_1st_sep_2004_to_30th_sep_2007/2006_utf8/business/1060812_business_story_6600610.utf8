 Coal unions demand ban on outsourcing

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 11: Cutting across party lines, trade union leaders today demanded a ban on outsourcing in the coal industry to free it from corruption.

 The government must immediately put a stop to outsourcing in the coal sector, CITU president M.K. Pandhe said at a seminar on Safed Industry what are the factors required for a profitable and corruption-free industry organised by Rashtriya Coal Mazdoor Sangh (ECL and SECL branch) here. 

 The labour ministry has announced a list of sectors where outsourcing should not be allowed. Coal is one of them. But unfortunately, 130 million tonnes of the 400 mt produced in the country are outsourced, he said.

 After many years, ECL reported a profit in 2005-06. But if the government wants to make profit by leasing out coal production to contractors, we will oppose that. In fact, all the five trade unions voiced their concerns to the government but with no effect, Pandhe said.

 Contracting out coal production has many difficulties. Not only do the contract workers get less paid but are also denied of many employment benefits such as provident fund and ESI. Moreover, contractors pay huge cut money and bribes to government officials to bag contracts, Pandhe said adding this practice should be stopped immediately. At Mahanadi Coal Fields, two-thirds of the total workers are on contract, he said. 

 He also said it is the responsibility of Coal India to stop illegal mining, which is another source of corruption. Many mines are abandoned without lifting coal completely. Such slaughter mining results in illegal raising of coal from these mines, Pandhe said.

 The coal ministrys rationale in allowing Coal India to outsource certain production activities was also questioned by the parliamentary standing committee on coal and steel earlier this week. The parliamentary panel said Coal India was allowed to outsource production while its own staff and machines remained under-utilised. The panel said while Coal India often cited land acquisition as a handicap to fully utilise heavy earth moving machinery, it frequently resorted to hiring the machines from a third party.

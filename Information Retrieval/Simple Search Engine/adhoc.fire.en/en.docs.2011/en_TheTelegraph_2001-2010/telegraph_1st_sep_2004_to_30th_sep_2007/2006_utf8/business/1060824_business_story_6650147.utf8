 Top guns to fight ore exports

 Muthuraman amp; Jindal: Fighting spirit 

 New Delhi, Aug. 23: A cabal of top steel CEOs, including Tata Steels B Muthuraman, Jindal groups Sajjan Jindal and Essars Prashant Ruia, met here today and decided to persuade the Centre to phase out iron ore exports. The honchos will also lobby against any possible restrictions by ore-rich states on trucking the mineral to steel plants in other states.

 Muthuraman even flew in from South Africa to attend the meet that was convened by Jindal. Others at the powwow were Vinod Mittal and Anil Surekha from Ispat, besides Ruia. There was also a PSU man at the meet Shiv Sagar Rao, chairman of Vizag Steel. Representatives from the smaller sponge iron makers association were also at the high table. 

 The PMO, in the meantime, was quick on the take with its response to the criticisms by several chief ministers on ore exports, forming a committee of secretaries on the issue. The PMO also appeared to have paid heed to earlier protests by the steel executives against exports.

 The committee to review the mines policy, led by Planning Commission member Anwarul Hoda, had supported ore exports and proposed more powers to states on disposing of the scarce resource.

 The CEOs today decided that they would lobby for a total ban on exports if the ore content in the iron was more than 60 per cent. It was also agreed that they would press their claims through the apex chambers Ficci, Assocham and CII and the Indian Steel Alliance.

 Sources said the committee of secretaries, including finance, commerce and the steel secretaries, was likely to meet on Friday. The committee was expected to take note of the views of the steel chiefs. 

 The sources added that the presence of Vizag Steels Rao was being viewed curiously by the government. PSU chiefs largely present their cases through their parent ministry and not through industry bodies. 

 The Huda panels report was in the backdrop of lobbying by foreign steel and mining majors for ore exports as it will give revenues to the government.

 However, domestic giants like the Tatas and SAIL want ban on high grade iron ore. They argue that it was more prudent to earn higher revenues through export of steel from the iron ore.

 Cheap exports of high-grade ore to Japan have long been a sore point with Indian steel companies. They feel the burgeoning domestic sector needs the high quality ore, which is a scarce resource globally. 

 The two critical inputs for steel making, iron ore and coal, are both in short supply globally. High quality iron ore is available only in India and Brazil.

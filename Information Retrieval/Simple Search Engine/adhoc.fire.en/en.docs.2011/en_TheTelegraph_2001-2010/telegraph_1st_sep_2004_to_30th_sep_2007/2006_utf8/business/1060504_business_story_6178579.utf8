 New steel plant in Bokaro

 SHASHANK SHEKHAR 

 Bokaro, May 3: Jharkhand will get another steel plant with the Steel Authority of India (SAIL) setting up one in Bokaro with a capacity of five million tonnes. This was announced by Union minister of state for steel Akhilesh Das on Tuesday.

 SAIL would set up the new, integrated plant on the vacant plot of Bokaro Steel and utilise the iron-ore reserves at Chiria.

 The plant would provide employment to people who were displaced earlier by Bokaro Steel.

 SAIL had been at loggerheads with the state government on several issues.

 The Jharkhand government had refused to extend the lease on Chiria reserves to SAIL and Indian Iron amp; Steel Co (IISCO) on the ground that IISCO had been unable to use even 5 per cent of the reserves during the previous lease period. While the state government lost the case before the tribunal, it has appealed against the order at the high court.

 The state government had also threatened to take back the vacant land at the disposal of Bokaro Steel.

 Berger Paints net at Rs 23.6 cr

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Oct. 24: Berger Paints recorded a marginal rise in net profit today for the three months ended on September 30. 

 Although the companys net sales between July and September increased 22.3 per cent to Rs 319.7 crore on a like-to-like basis, an unprecedented rise in the prices of downstream petroleum products used as raw materials for solvent-based paints ate into its profitability, Berger Paints said in a statement released here after its board approved its unaudited financial performance for the second quarter this fiscal.

 The companys quarterly net profit was Rs 23.6 crore against Rs 21.2 crore a year ago. 

 The companys earnings on a half-yearly basis also rose marginally to Rs 40.78 crore at the end of September from Rs 36.77 crore in the corresponding period last year. Net sales, on the other hand, increased 18.78 per cent on a year-on-year basis to Rs 572.11 crore from Rs 481.65 crore. 

 However, Berger Paints has hiked its product prices by 5-6 per cent in September this year and hopes it will stem the margins of the company in the following quarters. 

 The product price increase in September will bring significant improvements and restore the margins in the second half of the year, the release said. 

 Berger Paints had already raised its solvent-based product prices between 4 per cent and 5 per cent in May this year. Solvent-based products comprise 55 per cent of the companys total turnover. 

 Berger Paints also expects that the 12-14 per cent annual growth rate in the domestic paint industry will keep its pace following the unabated growth in the real estate and overall economic activities.

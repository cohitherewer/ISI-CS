 Bajaj Auto ups stake in ICICI Bank

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Deal done

 Mumbai, July 7: Bajaj Auto Ltd today forked out Rs 633 crore to snap up an additional 1.42 per cent (or 1.26 crore shares) in ICICI Bank, the countrys second largest commercial bank.

 The shares were bought through block deals on both the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and the National Stock Exchange (NSE). 

 On the BSE, Bajaj Auto bought 68.04 lakh shares of the private sector bank at an average price of Rs 499.73 per share. 

 On the NSE, it purchased over 58.66 lakh shares at a price of Rs 499.43 per share. 

 Though the identity of the sellers could not be established, brokers speculate that they were foreign institutional investors (FIIs) who hold close to 47 per cent of the banks equity. 

 Although Bajaj Auto has one of the largest investment portfolio among private sector companies of over Rs 6,000 crore, the deal is significant as it may signal a possible entry into the mainstream banking space as and when the sector is thrown open.

 Current regulations prohibit corporates from having more than 10 per cent stake in a bank. The Bajaj Auto group, which has a non-banking finance entity called Bajaj Auto Finance, has however, so far maintained that its investment in ICICI Bank is purely of an investment nature. 

 As of March 31, 2006, Bajaj Auto held 2.71 per cent or over 2.41 crore shares of ICICI Bank. Its holding in the bank had come down on account of the latters public offering last year. Its acquisition could, therefore, have been done to readjust to the previous levels. 

 The purchase of these 1.26 crore shares, now takes its stake in ICICI Bank to 4.13 per cent. This deal led to ICICI Bank topping the turnover charts at the exchanges. On the BSE, more than 70 lakh shares were transacted, resulting in a turnover of around Rs 353 crore.

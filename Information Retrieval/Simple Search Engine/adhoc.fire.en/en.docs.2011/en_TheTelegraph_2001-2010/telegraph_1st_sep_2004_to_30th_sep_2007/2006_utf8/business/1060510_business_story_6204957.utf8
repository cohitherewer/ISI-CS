 Deora: Time for a raise

 New Delhi, May 9: Petroleum minister Murli Deora today said his ministry would try not to raise prices of cooking gas and kerosene as these were used by the common man.

 While a Rs 2-3 per litre hike in the prices of petrol and diesel is imminent, it now remains to be seen whether the government goes in for a modest hike of Rs 15-20 per cylinder of cooking gas or not.

 With the polling process coming to an end in Bengal and Kerala, the government has resumed its discussions with the Left parties on the thorny oil price issue.

 Gurudas Dasgupta told Deora today that the Left parties did not favour a price increase but rather advocated ?rationalisation of duties on petroleum products... revenue could be raised elsewhere by raising duties.?

 He added that ?no Asian country has such a high level of duty on petroleum products?. 

 Deora has told the CPI leadership that the national oil companies would lose Rs 73,000 crore at the current price levels. While the Centre was collecting Rs 86,000 crore as duties from the oil sector, the states were mopping up Rs 45,000 crore as sales tax, he added. 

 In such a situation, the government has no choice but to go in for a price hike, he said. 

 The petroleum minister is expected to meet all the Left party leaders, including CPM politbureau member Sitaram Yechury and Rajya Sabha MP Dipankar Mukherjee, tomorrow to apprise them of the grim situation confronting the government on the oil front. 

 The Left allies of the ruling UPA have been opposing an increase in the prices of petroleum products. However, in the past, they have fallen in line in the case of petrol and diesel in view of the harsh economic realities. 

 When diesel and petrol prices were increased in September last year, railway minister Lalu Prasad had put his foot down on the issue of increasing domestic LPG prices. 

 The national oil companies are losing Rs 220 on each cylinder of cooking gas sold to households. 

 Senior petroleum ministry officials feel that with crude prices surging to $70 per barrel, it will be extremely difficult to escape a price hike. 

 Deora said his ministry was studying the report of Rangarajan committee on petroleum product pricing, even as the proposed meeting between petroleum secretary M.S. Srinivasan and finance secretary Adarsh Kishore on Monday was deferred.

 When the meeting takes place, Srinivasan is expected to seek a cut in import and excise duties and a hike in subsidies on cooking fuel as measures to help oil firms.

 Public sector oil marketing firms are losing Rs 9.34 per litre on selling petrol below the imported cost, while the loss on diesel is Rs 10.43 a litre. Kerosene is being sold at a loss of Rs 16.78 per litre.

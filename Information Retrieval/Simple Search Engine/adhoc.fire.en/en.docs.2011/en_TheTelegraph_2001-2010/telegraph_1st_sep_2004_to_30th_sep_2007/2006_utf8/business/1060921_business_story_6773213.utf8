 OVL sniffs big gains from overseas buys

 S.P.S. PANNU

 New Delhi, Sept. 20: ONGC-Videsh (OVL) is targeting 20 million tonnes of oil every year from its overseas fields by 2010 with Latin America and Africa emerging as new thrust areas.

 OVL chairman R.S. Sharma said the recent acquisition of a 15 per cent stake in the BC-10 deepwater block in Brazil with a production potential of 90,000 barrels of oil per day is a move in this direction. It has also acquired two offshore blocks in Nigeria with a rich hydrocarbon potential.

 Sharma said, With OVL making headway in Latin America, some promising opportunities are expected to come its way in the days ahead.

 ONGC is backing its foreign investments with a warchest of Rs 50,000 crore for the Eleventh Five-Year Plan period (2007-12). 

 This is a quantum leap from the Rs 15,300 crore allocated for the purpose during the tenth plan.

 OVL gets 6.3 million tonnes of oil and oil equivalent of gas as its share from overseas assets. It had made a net profit of Rs 981 crore for the fiscal ended March 31, 2006. 

 Riding on the back of its Sakhalin I success story, OVL looked at expanding its operations in Russia. However, the Sakhalin I deal was struck when the Russians were strapped for cash and preferred to accommodate OVL rather than British Petroleum for geopolitical reasons.

 With crude prices going through the roof, the Russian economy has bounced back and there are no cheap deals available. 

 The Russians have already prepaid the $1.3-billion OVL loan that they had taken at the time of the Sakhalin I deal.

 The switch to Latin America and Africa is a logical way out as these countries are looking for foreign investment and are geopolitically comfortable with India as well.

 OVL has also inked production-sharing contracts in adjoining Cuba for two deepwater exploration blocks N-34 and N-35 in the Gulf of Mexico. 

 This comes close on the heels of acquiring a 30 per cent interest in six deepwater blocks, which were assigned by the Cuban government.

 With these acquisitions, OVL now has 24 oil and gas properties in 14 countries.

 Talks for a 25 per cent stake in an oilfield in Columbia are at an advanced stage with OVL managing director R.S. Butola at Bagota to give the finishing touches to the deal. ONGC expects to get 1 million tonnes of oil per year as its share from the oilfield.

 Ecuador is yet another South American country that is keen to invite government-owned companies to help develop its infrastructure to promote overall economic development. 

 OVL has signed an agreement with PetroEcuador and is looking for oil assets in the country.

 The Indian government is also considering linking its policy of giving credit lines and aid to various governments to help OVL and other domestic oil companies gain oil and gas assets abroad.

 This has already been initiated in Nigeria, where OVL is expected to take up development projects, which include the development of railways.

 The companys geographical map includes Vietnam, Russia, Sudan (three assets), Iran, Iraq, Libya (two assets), Myanmar, Syria, Ivory Coast, Australia, Qatar and Egypt. Two of these assets one each in Vietnam and Sudan are in production and four assets in Russia, Myanmar, Qatar and Sudan (5A) have oil or gas discoveries where appraisal and development are in progress. Exploration is in progress in nine other assets in Iran, Iraq, Sudan (5B), Syria, Libya (NC 188 amp; 189), Ivory Coast, Australia and Egypt.

 The company has as many as four producing properties, which include the Sakhalin I oilfield in Russia and Greater Nile and 5A projects in Sudan and an offshore gas field in Vietnam.

 Five other discovered properties are under development, while 13 assets are still at the exploration stage.

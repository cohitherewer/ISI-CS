 Vodafone strikes deal in Italy

 Fast connection

 Milan, Sept. 16 (Reuters): Italian broadband company Fastweb and the Italian unit of mobile phone giant Vodafone announced on Friday a commercial agreement to jointly offer parts of each others services, the companies said. 

 Vodafone clients would be able to use their mobile phones from home at fixed-line rates and use a high-speed ADSL modem to access Fastwebs broadband network, the companies said.

 The companies are also offering discounted rates for calls between Fastwebs fixed-line numbers and Vodafones mobile clients. 

 This accord represents the first step of a cooperation that will lead to the launch of new products for business clients, the companies said. 

 The agreement would provide additional wholesale revenues without associate subscribers acquisition costs, Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in note on Friday. 

 Vodafone is Italys second-largest mobile operator with a 32 per cent market share, behind Telecom Italias TIM unit, which has a 40 per cent market share. 

 A deeper agreement allowing Fastweb to form a so-called virtual mobile operator one that buys mobile network capacity wholesale from the network operator at a discount and sells mobile phone services appears increasingly likely, Morgan Stanley said. 

 Fridays deal would be in line with Vodafones strategy to offer broadband services in its main markets and would pre-empt convergence offers from Wind, Italys third-largest mobile operator, Morgan Stanley said. 

 Milan-based Fastweb, Italys second-largest telecommunications operator, has attracted contracts since expanding its network to cover most of Italy. The company aims to add mobile phone services, by 2007, to the Internet, phone and on-demand media content it already provides.

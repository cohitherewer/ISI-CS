 Marginal rise in JSW Steel profit 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, April 19: Hit by poor price realisation, JSW Steel Ltd, the .P. Jindal group company, recorded a marginal rise in net profit for the fourth quarter of the year ended March 31. 

 Net profit marginally rose to Rs 410.68 crore from Rs 404.14 crore in the corresponding period previous year as steel prices took a beating.

 The picture could have been poorer, had it not been for a profit of Rs 369.20 crore, which the company received by disinvesting shares of JSW Energy Ltd in favour of an associate company. JSW Steel divested this stake for a consideration of Rs 513.70 crore.

 During the quarter, domestic sales rose to Rs 1,203.83 crore from Rs 983.43 crore in the corresponding previous quarter. 

 With JSW Steel focusing more on domestic markets in recent times, exports took a sharp beating to Rs 531.08 crore from Rs 1,308.88 crore a year ago.

 For the year ended March 31, the company reported a drop in earnings as well as income. 

 Net profit stood at Rs 856.53 crore against Rs 870.11 crore in 2004-05 and total income was at Rs 6,766.09 crore against Rs 7,035.90 crore.

 However, JSW Steel has put these disappointments behind. With steel prices recovering in recent times, the company is projecting a conservative growth of 20 per cent in topline for this year. 

 Senior officials pointed out that while prices are likely to gain during the first two quarters, it might come under pressure later.

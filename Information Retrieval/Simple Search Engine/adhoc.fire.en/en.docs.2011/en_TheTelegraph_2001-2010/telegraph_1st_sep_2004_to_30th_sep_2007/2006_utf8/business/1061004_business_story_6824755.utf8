 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Khorakiwala: Booster dose

 Mumbai, Oct. 3: Wockhardt Ltd has bought Irelands Pinewood Laboratories for $150 million. This is its fourth European acquisition.

 Pinewood, according to Wockhardt, is the fastest growing branded generic pharmaceutical company in Ireland and the acquisition would increase its presence in the region. This acquisition gives us a larger footprint in Europe that is spread over the UK, Ireland and Germany. European business will now exceed $200 million, accounting for almost half of Wockhardts total sales, Wockhardt chairman Habil Khorakiwala said. 

 Apart from giving Wockhardt an entry in the generic market of Ireland, the acquisition will also indirectly strengthen its presence in the UK. This is because almost half of Pinewoods sales come from the UK. Wockhardt is a leading generic company from India and the second largest player in hospital sales in the UK.

 The acquisition offers us opportunities to unlock the value of our enlarged customer base in the UK and Ireland by offering them a wider range of products, Khorakiwala added.

 Wockhardt added that the acquisition is a strategic fit as Pinewoods liquids and creams business complements its strengths in injectable and solid dosages. 

 Wockhardt UK is among the top 10 generic companies and is the market leader in several of its injectable and solid products in the UK. Wockhardt UK can now leverage Pinewoods marketing and distribution system and its customer base in Ireland for its vast range of hospital products.

 Pinewood is Wockhardts fourth European acquisition, after Wallis, CP Pharmaceuticals (both in the UK) and Esparma in Germany. The UK and Germany are Europes leading generic markets.

 Pinewood has over 200 prescription and over-the-counter products. It is the market leader in renal therapy products and has a strong brand name in its market segments. The company also has products that are at various stages of development. It reported a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 20 per cent for the last five years.

 Ireland has seen considerable growth over the last 15 years, Wockhardt said. Its economy grew at almost 9 per cent per annum between 1996 and 2000. Pinewood has reported sales of over $70 million for the year ended June 2006.

 Q amp;A

 Theres a will 

 I am a widower with a son and a daughter. For my PPF and life insurance policies, I have made my son the sole nominee in my will. After my demise can my daughter legally claim any share of the PPF and life insurance money? Should I close my PPF and life insurance account and reinvest the sum in a bank with my son as joint holder?

 P. Basu, Halisahar

 In the eyes of law, a nominee is only a custodian of the property and not 

an heir. There will be no problem if you have mentioned your son will get the 

PPF and life insurance money after your death in your will. But if you have made 

your son a nominee only, there could be a problem and you daughter can claim a 

share in them. However, you can withdraw your investments in PPF and life insurance 

and reinvest the sum in a bank deposit with your son as you have suggested.

 Farm fresh

 I have an annual income of Rs 12,000 from agriculture and other sources. Do I have to file income tax return every year once I get my PAN? While applying for PAN what should I mention in the occupation column? If I make short-term profit from share trading, do I need to file income tax return and pay tax?

 Sibhendu K. Mondal, Calcutta

 People with annual income of less than Rs 1 lakh do not require to file income tax return even if they have a PAN. While applying for PAN, you can mention agriculture as your occupation. For short-term gains calculation, if your total annual income, including the short-term gain, falls below Rs 1 lakh you dont have to pay any tax.

 Banking on it

 Is a retired bank employee eligible for a 2 percentage point higher interest rate on term deposits? Im a retired bank employee and Im getting 1.5 percentage point higher interest rate 1 per cent more for being a bank employee and 0.5 per cent more for being a senior citizen.

 Nirmalendu Ghosh, Kasba

 Employees of a bank get 1 percentage point higher interest rate on their term deposits with their employer bank. Now, different banks offer different interest rates for senior citizens some give 1 percentage point higher interest rate, while some offer 0.50 percentage point more.

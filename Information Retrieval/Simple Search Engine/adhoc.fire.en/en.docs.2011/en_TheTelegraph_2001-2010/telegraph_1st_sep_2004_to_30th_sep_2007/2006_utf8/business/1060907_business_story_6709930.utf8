 Calcutta, Sept. 6: Godrej Lifespace, the retailing division of Godrej amp; Boyce Manufacturing Ltd, plans to achieve a turnover of Rs 300 crore by 2010. 

 It will also ensure a pan-India presence for the Godrej Lifespace brand in the same time. The company is set to expand its retail footprint to 90 stores from 43.

 The company expects around 20 per cent of its turnover to come from Tier II and III towns by 2010, while non-Godrej brands are expected to comprise 15 to 20 per cent.

 We closed last fiscal with a turnover of Rs 60 crore, which is expected to increase to Rs 100 crore this year. Part of this retail expansion footprint is the 10,000-sq-ft flagship stores and we plan to have one or more of them in each of the seven metros, said Shyam Motwani, vice-president and business head (retailing division) of Godrej amp; Boyce Manufacturing.

 The home and office interiors company will spend Rs 36 crore over the next three years on expansion.

 Calcutta has five stores and two more will open in the next six months.

 The company is focusing on Jamshedpur and Ranchi, besides Bhubaneswar and Guwahati, to increase the number of stores in the eastern region from seven to 11 by the end of this fiscal.

 The retailing division is also on the verge of finalising discussions with two digital camera brands to offer customers non-Godrej brands.

 The categories also include personal computers and laptops, home furnishing, kids furniture, containers that can withstand microwave, wall furnishings and crystalware. We want to stock other popular brands in such categories, Motwani added.

 Other services such as ATMs and coffee bars on the premises are also being considered and talks are on with a number of players.

 All the stores are either company-owned, managed or leased and managed. 

 But with real estate prices having almost doubled in the last one year, the company might consider the franchisee route if needed.

 The company, which has a store in Dubai, will consider overseas presence in due course.

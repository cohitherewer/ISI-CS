 Bengal set for textile odyssey

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Bhattacharjee: Here we come!

 Falta, Sept. 17: Bengal has warmed up to seize the opportunity in the international textile market 21 months after the World Trade Organisation (WTO) lifted the bottleneck, paving the way for countries like India to export freely. 

 The quota regime, which restricted the quantum of export of textile goods to EU and US, went out of the system in January 2005.

 Today, while attending the expansion programme of a textile unit at Falta, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said the time has come to seize the bull by the horns.

 Other states, however, were rather fast on the block as they have taken full benefit of the new schemes that the Centre had formulated to push the textile industry nationally following the end of the quota regime.

 The Centre, for instance, is doling out large subsidies to set up textile parks. Bengal has got only one of the 25 parks approved by the Centre.

 Bhattacharjee admitted that the state was a late starter in this field but vowed to make up. He said four districts Burdwan, Birbhum, Bankura and the South 24 Parganas have been identified where cotton is being grown experimentally.

 If this is successful, the state will have a stake in the entire value chain of the business, from cultivation of cotton to spinning, weaving, clothing.

 The state government has also got some mills but not all of them are doing well. The chief minister urged private entrepreneurs to come forward.

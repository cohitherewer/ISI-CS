 New Delhi, Jan. 11 (PTI): German auto component major Bosch today said it would invest Rs 1,800 crore in the Indian market between 2005 and 2008, which is an extension of the Rs 1,000 crore investment already announced.

 India is a growth economy and we are confident that the steep upward trend will continue in the future, Robert Bosch GmbH chairman Bernd Bohr told reporters at the eighth edition of the auto expo here today.

 A major part of the new investments will go towards the expansion of the companys automotive activities in India, including additional investments in Mico, Bosch Chassis Systems (formerly Kalyani Brakes) and IT company Robert Bosch India Ltd. Bullish on the growth of the diesel market in the Indian auto industry, the company had earlier announced investments of Rs 1,000 crore in Mico, which will come out with common rail injection systems in Bangalore and Nasik. This will be made between 2004 and 2007. 

 Current investment (Rs 1,800 crore) is an extension of the previously announced Rs 1,000 crore investment between 2004 and 2007 by the company, Bohr said. 

 He said diesel vehicles were going to increase their share in the Indian auto market, cornering about 40 per cent of the market from the current 32 per cent. The company is also increasing the strength at its captive IT unit Robert Bosch India, apart from the research and development unit of Mico which caters to the demands in the domestic market.

 Bosch said it will also be increasing components sourcing from India, which last year stood at Rs 400 crore ? a growth of 13-14 per cent. The company exports products like fuel injection, auto electricals and braking systems to Europe, North America and Far East.

 The company said that apart from two and three-wheeler brakes, Bosch Chassis Systems will also be manufacturing four wheeler brakes.

 We are establishing local manufacturing capacities in India. Last year saw the production of injector components for the common rail system in Nasik. Manufacturing of complete injectors will follow in 2007... The first common-rail system will come off production line by mid-2006 from Bangalore, he said. 

 Bohr said India held an important position for Bosch and the market would expand further in the coming years. 

 In total, sales of our Indian subsidiaries grew by 25 per cent in 2005, to nearly Rs 3,802 crore. In 10 years, the sales growth has quadrupled. 

 These figures alone show the extent to which India has become a growth economy for Bosch. And we have every reason to be confident that the steep upward trend will continue in the future, he added.

 Even as it is moving forward to manufacture common rail diesel systems in India, the company supplies these systems to Mahindra and Mahindra and Hyundai. 

 In 2005, we delivered roughly 40,000 common-rail systems in India, and in 2010 this figure is likely to be 6,00,000. In the same period, the share of diesel engines in the Indian car and utility vehicles market will rise from 29 per cent to 37 per cent, he added.

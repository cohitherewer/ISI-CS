 Dalal Street now desolation row

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, June 7: In what could be a strong indication that shares are under a bear spell, renewed selling pressure has driven the sensex below the low of 9826.91 it had struck on May 22, when the index had tanked over 1000 points. The market barometer fell for the third straight session today by losing 201 points to close at 9756.76.

 The sensex opened weak at 9919.28 against the previous close of 9957.32. It touched an intra-day high of 10051.81 and then slipped to 9609.21, reflecting a swing of 442.60 points.

 While investors continued to pull out amid concerns of a likely hike in US fed rates and melting global commodity and equity markets, heavy selling by mutual funds to meet redemption pressure also compounded the market woes.

 Till now, mutual funds were seen as a force that could step in when equity values dip. However, this has not been the case. Market circles say mutual funds have been consistent sellers since June 2, making a cumulative sales of Rs 526.85 crore in two days. 

 The most worrying part is that there is no buying at lower levels. Any rise is being seen as an opportunity to sell. Investors, whether it is the FIIs, mutual funds or high net worth individuals, simply want to exit the market at this stage, said a dealer.

 Morgan Stanley echoed similar sentiments in its report on Asia-Pacific economies. The report, titled The Bear Market May Have Begun, said as inflation is likely to surprise on the upside in the US and other economies, their central banks may have to tighten and keep rates high for two years or more. 

 In another report, Morgan Stanley said the recent downslide has again exposed the countrys over-dependence on portfolio flows. Although such flows have accounted for nearly one-third of the total capital inflow over the past three years, funds have offloaded more than $2.5 billion since the sensex started to drop from the first half of May, it added.

 Although the Sebi data says that FIIs were net investors for the past three trading sessions, it is believed that they were net buyers in the cash segment today.

 While the sensex opened weaker at 9919.28 against the previous close of 9957.32, the index had overcome these losses due to short-covering. After touching an intra-day high of 10051.81, the BSE sensex hit a low of 9609.21, thus reflecting a swing of 442.60 points.

 Since June 5, the market has lost 6.2 per cent, or 694 points, to a level last seen on January 25.

 The National Stock Exchanges S amp;P CNX Nifty also fell sharply by 76.85 points, or 2.62 per cent, to 2,860.45 from the previous close of 2,937.30.

 Though metal and state-run oil company stocks remained major losers, mid-cap and small cap stocks have also borne the brunt of selling pressure. While the BSE Mid-Cap index today sank by 6 per cent, the small cap index was lower by 7 per cent.

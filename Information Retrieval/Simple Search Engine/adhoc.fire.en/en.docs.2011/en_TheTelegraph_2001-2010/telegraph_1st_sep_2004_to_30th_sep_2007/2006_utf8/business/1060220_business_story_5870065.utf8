 Aiyar aides fall to Deora sweep 

 S.P.S. PANNU 

 Deora: In control

 New Delhi, Feb. 19: Petroleum minister Murli Deora has wielded the broom against his predecessor Mani Shankar Aiyars trusted aides. He has shunted around 10 of Aiyars ministerial staff to lesser posts. 

 In contrast, Aiyar had continued with most of Ram Naiks aides. Naik was the petroleum minister during the previous BJP regime. 

 Additional secretary Tamleez Ahmed, an IFS officer inducted by Aiyar as the pointman for the countrys oil diplomacy, has been sidelined too. 

 While petroleum secretary M.S. Srinivasan left for Oman for a crucial assignment last week and joint secretary Ajay Tyagi went to Turkmenistan with minister of state Dinsha Patel for a meeting on the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan pipeline, Ahmed had been left to cool his heels at home. 

 Ahmed used to accompany Aiyar on his foreign jaunts and visited several countries in pursuit of the nations oil diplomacy.

 Aiyar, a former career-diplomat, in an unprecedented move had inducted Ahmed into the petroleum ministry. Ahmed was known to him from his IFS days.

 The IFS-IAS rivalry entered the corridors of the petroleum ministry as Ahmed wanted to bring in more IFS officers to assist him. 

 However, with the change of guard at the top, the IAS lobby appears to have regained its traditional hold. 

 While Deora had, in a show of apparent bonhomie, called on Aiyar at home before taking over the reins, the ground reality is that the new minister does not want anyone he perceives to be close to Aiyar peeping over his shoulder. 

 A considerable amount of political lobbying always goes on within the party to wrangle plum jobs like the petroleum ministers portfolio. Deora, who has displaced Aiyar, does not want to take any chances. 

 Ironically, Aiyars piece of advice to Deora while handing over charges was that too much information was leaking out of the petroleum ministry. 

 Deora, being a seasoned politician, seems to have drawn his own conclusions and shunted out Aiyars trusted aides.

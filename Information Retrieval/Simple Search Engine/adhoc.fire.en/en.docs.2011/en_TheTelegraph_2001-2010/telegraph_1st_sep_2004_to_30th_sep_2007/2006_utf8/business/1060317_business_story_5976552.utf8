 Shift in mutual order

 CHANDRALEKHA TULAL 

 Mumbai, March 16: The pecking order in the mutual fund industry is set to change with Reliance Mutual Fund poised to take over as the largest private mutual fund house overtaking Prudential ICICI Mutual Fund. 

 The change would be brought about by the recently concluded Reliance Equity Fund, which collected Rs 5,759 crore from over 9.29 lakh applicants across the country. 

 This is the highest ever collection in the history of the mutual fund industry and has replaced the record of UTI Mastergain which had garnered Rs 4,472 crore, said Amitabh Chaturvedi, chief executive officer of Reliance Mutual Fund. 

 This will take our total assets under management to around Rs 22,000 crore by the end of March, said Chaturvedi. As at the end of February, Prudential ICICI had over Rs 21,000 crore worth of assets followed by HDFC at over Rs 20,000 crore and Franklin Templeton at almost Rs 18,000 crore. Reliance Mutual Fund was at the fourth position with almost Rs 17,000 crore assets in its kitty. 

 We will have to wait till the end of March to understand whether we will emerge as the second largest mutual fund house in the country and the largest among the private fund houses, said Chaturvedi. 

 However, we will surely be the fund house with the highest equity assets of Rs 14,500 crore. Apart from the new fund, we are continuously adding new assets to our existing schemes, including Reliance Growth and Reliance Vision, he added. At the end of February, UTI had equity assets of Rs 11,972 crore followed by Franklin Templeton at Rs 10,564 crore. 

 The last couple of years saw some changes in the rankings of the fund houses in terms of assets under management. Franklin Templeton slipped from being the largest private fund house with Prudential ICICI taking over as the numero uno and now has taken the third place after HDFC.

 SBI Mutual Fund shot into the top 10 in July last year and has seen its assets grow steadily since then. Its latest fund offering, SBI Bluechip Fund, collected Rs 2,855 crore and the fund house had almost Rs 13,000 crore worth of assets at the end of February. 

 According to data provided by Value Research on three-year returns, while no scheme of Prudential ICICI features among the top 20 funds, there are three schemes of SBI Magnum, three of HDFC, two of Reliance and one of Franklin Templeton.

 Mittal sees profit rise

 Mittal: Future perfect

 London, June 13 (Reuters): Mittal Steel expects core earnings to rise by 70 per cent, or $4.1 billion, over the next three years, it said today as it published a business plan intended to secure a takeover of rival Arcelor.

 The worlds biggest steel producer, whose cash and shares offer for Luxembourg-based Arcelor is worth around 21.1 billion euros ($26.5 billion), said earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) should reach $9.9 billion in 2008, up from $5.8 billion in 2005. The forecast does not include the potential acquisition of Arcelor, which has rejected Mittals latest bid despite seeing its earnings forecast last week.

 Mittals business plan is underpinned by market forecasts that demand for steel will continue to grow by 3.6 per cent to 4.5 per cent per year, offsetting the companys assumption that steel prices will fall 1.75 per cent in real terms annually. The firm expects to add $500 million to EBITDA by 2008 by cutting energy use by 6 per cent and forecast another $500 million boost from raised productivity. Mittal also plans to cut over 10 per cent of its workforce, or 26,000 jobs out of 224,000.

 This should put pressure on Arcelor, which has been saying Mittal concentrates on volumes rather than margins. This business plan shows this is not the case and should comfort people holding Mittals shares, a trader said.

 Rabo Securities analyst Richard Brakenhoff said, Their guidance for 2008 is clearly above my targets. This is not only driven by higher sales volumes but also as they are investing in trying to improve their product mix.

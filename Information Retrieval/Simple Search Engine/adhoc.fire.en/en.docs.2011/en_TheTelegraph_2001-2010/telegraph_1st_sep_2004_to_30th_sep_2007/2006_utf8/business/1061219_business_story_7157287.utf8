 Cabinet okays sugar exports

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Dec. 18: The Cabinet today approved a proposal to allow sugar export to companies that have been issued advance licences and fulfil their commitments to overseas buyers. 

 Parliamentary affairs minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi said the commerce ministry proposal would be limited only to exporters holding advance licences.

 The sugar firms have been demanding liberalisation of the export policy on the ground that domestic prices have gone down, while they have to pay high prices for the cane bought from farmers.

 The government, however, is alert, as inflation has started rising and the prices of food items are increasing. It does not want to take the risk of allowing liberal exports as this could lead to an increase in domestic prices.

 Therefore, it has chosen the middle path and allowed firms that have been complaining that they have to meet their export commitments made on the basis of advance export licenses.

 Power bill

 The cabinet today gave its approval for making necessary amendments in the Electricity (Amendment) Bill, 2005, aimed at bringing down power theft.

 Das Munshi said the proposal is based on the recommendations of the standing committee of Parliament and the group of ministers that wanted some additional measures incorporated in the bill.

 HCL Technologies to hire 5000 more

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 14: BPO Services of HCL Technologies plans to invest $25 million this fiscal to upgrade its infrastructure and hire 5,000 more. It is also considering acquiring companies engaged in transaction processing services in the US and the UK.

 HCL Technologies BPO Services is eyeing companies between a turnover of $50 and $100 million.

 The company expects to generate revenues in excess of $160 million in the financial year ended June 30, 2006.

 It is likely to maintain a growth rate of over 50 per cent this fiscal.

 Around 70 per cent of our business now comes from voice-based activities and the remaining 30 per cent from non-voice. But we would like to move up the value chain from voice to transaction and finally to knowledge process outsourcing and expect the ratio between voice and non-voice to become 50:50 in the next two years, said N. Ranjit, chief executive officer of HCL Technologies BPO Services.

 Of the 5,000 people to be hired, around 150 to 200 would be for the Northern Ireland centres. The company is the largest BPO outfit in Belfast and Armag and currently employs 2,000 people. 

 The company has a total staff strength of 10,000.

 Ranjit said former Bengal IT minister Manab Mukherjee visited the companys centre in Noida in November 2005.

 The huge talent pool in the Calcutta centre is best suited for transaction and knowledge-based services. Since HCL already has a software development centre employing 700 people in this city, it might not be more than a year before BPO Services set up base as well, Ranjit said.

 HCL feels mature markets like the UK would experience an annual growth of 10 per cent compared with over 50 per cent in India.

 The companys investment per seat is $5,000 on an average.

 BPO Services of HCL Technologies has centres in Noida (5,000 staff), Chennai (3,500) and Northern Ireland (2,000). 

 HCL Technologies is also keen to enter tier II cities.

 The company also has a unit in Malaysia with 70 people.

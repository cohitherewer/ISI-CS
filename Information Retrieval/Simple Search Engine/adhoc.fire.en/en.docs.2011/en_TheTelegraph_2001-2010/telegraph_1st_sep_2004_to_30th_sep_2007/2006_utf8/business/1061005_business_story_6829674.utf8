 Gold prices take a tumble

 All that glitters

 Mumbai, Oct. 4 (Agencies): The bullion market witnessed a free-fall on brisk selling by stockists that was triggered by a weakening trend overseas.

 Selling pressure gathered momentum after reports of the precious metal losing over $24 at $577 an ounce in overseas markets last evening.

 Gold fell the highest in Delhi by Rs 295 at Rs 8,780 per 10 gram. It fell by Rs 245 at Rs 8,790 in Calcutta, Rs 230 at Rs 8,650 in Mumbai and Rs 260 at Rs 8,715 in Chennai.

 Silver prices also tumbled downhill. It fell by Rs 800 at Rs 17,250 per kilo in Delhi, Rs 600 at Rs 17,400 in Calcutta, Rs 690 at Rs 17,615 in Mumbai and Rs 870 at Rs 16,770 in Chennai.

 Gold is tracking the decline in oil prices and showing quick impact whenever a sharp fluctuation takes place, traders said, adding that crude oil dropping below $59 a barrel weighted heavily on precious metals such as gold, silver and palladium.

 They felt that some recovery in Asian markets might bring relief to the market tomorrow. 

 In select Asian markets, gold made a small rebound after four straight days of losses as some investors judged the drop in oil price to a seven-month low was overdone and bought the precious metal, dealers said.

 In the morning trade, gold quoted sharply weak in Hong Kong at $576.50-577.30 per ounce. But in some parts of Asia, it recovered marginally later in the day and quoted at $577.92 per dollar.

 In London, silver slumped to $10.82 per ounce from the previous level of $11.34.

 In Mumbai, gold made a feeble recovery attempt towards the end on some low-level buying by jewellers and fabricators. However, it closed with sharp losses over yesterdays close, the dealers said.

 Standard gold (99.5 purity) opened steeply lower at Rs 8,630 and later recovered part of the early losses on fresh buying and closed at Rs 8,650, a steep setback of Rs 230 over yesterdays close of Rs 8,880. Similarly, pure gold (99.9 purity) declined steeply by Rs 240 to Rs 8,700 from Rs 8,940 the previous day.

 Ready silver (.999 fineness), after a steeply lower start at Rs 17,630, continued to lean down on increased selling and closed at Rs 17,615, showing a huge loss of Rs 690 over the previous close of Rs 18,305.

 Thomas Cook to cash in on leisure travel

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Oct. 4: Thomas Cook India has launched a premium holidays brand 100% Holidays to focus on the growing leisure travel business. The new brand will be used for packages in the international group and customised individual holidays segments. 

 The new brand will function within the corporate brand of Thomas Cook. Madhavan Menon, managing director of Thomas Cook India, said as the company expands into newer product lines and geographies, the corporate Thomas Cook brand is being stretched across many product segments. Therefore, the need was felt to create a specialised and distinct holidays brand.

 According to the company, the international holiday travel market is growing at over 30 per cent annually and it has a strong franchise in both the group escorted holidays segment and the individual customised holidays sector.

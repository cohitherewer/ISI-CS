 Spotlight on diesel export to Bangladesh

 S.P.S. PANNU 

 New Delhi, March 21: The petroleum ministry has asked the ministry of external affairs to discuss with Bangladesh Prime Minister Khaleda Zia the issue of exporting diesel from Numaligarh and Haldia refineries.

 Numaligarh Refinery Ltd (NRL) has offered to supply 50,000 tonnes of diesel to Bangladesh. While 40,000 tonnes is proposed to be shipped through the river route, the remaining 10,000 tonnes would be transported by road. 

 The total value of the deal would work out to around Rs 120 crore and Bangladesh could save as much as $1 million on its diesel imports. 

 A senior petroleum ministry official told The Telegraph that although the NRL proposal makes economic sense for Bangladesh, political clearance would have to come from the highest level for the deal to sail through.

 Indias diesel exports are linked to the bilateral trade imbalance with Bangladesh.

 Commerce minister Kamal Nath met Zia today and is reported to have informed her that India is sensitive to Dhakas concerns over a sizeable imbalance in the bilateral trade. 

 He said India would like Bangladesh to have a greater access to the Indian market utilising the concessions under the South Asian Free Trading Agreement and Bimstec grouping.

 NRL is offering diesel at a competitive rate to Bangladesh, which is currently procuring it from the Gulf. It involves a huge transport cost, as ships from the Gulf have to go around Sri Lanka to reach Chittagong.

 Once the consignment reaches Chittagong, there is a long haul to the hinterland, which can be reached more easily from Numaligarh.

 NRL is virtually in the backyard of Bangladesh and the country will save a lot in transport costs if the diesel is supplied directly, a senior official said. 

 NRL has already sent a consignment of diesel to Budge Budge on a river barge, which travelled through Bangladesh to reach its destination. The waterway has been successfully tested and it takes eight days for the barge to reach the river port of Baghbari in Bangladesh. 

 Another 10,00 tonnes of diesel can be transported by road to the border town of Dauki through Sylhet.

 Senior NRL and BPCL officials have submitted a formal proposal on diesel exports to Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation in Dhaka.

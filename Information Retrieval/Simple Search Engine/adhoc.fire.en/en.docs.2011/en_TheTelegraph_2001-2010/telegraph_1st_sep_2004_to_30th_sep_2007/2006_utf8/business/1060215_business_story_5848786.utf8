 Dalmia in CBI custody till Feb 24

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, Feb. 14: A metropolitan court today placed Dinesh Dalmia, the founder-director of DSQ Software Limited, in CBI custody till February 24.

 Dalmia, who has been charged with misappropriating Rs 595-crore worth unlisted shares from investors, was produced this evening before additional chief metropolitan magistrate D. Arul Raj, who granted the CBI plea and directed Dalmia be produced before the court on February 24.

 The Central Bureau of Investigation had sought Dalmias custody for a fortnight on the plea that the sum involved was large and its end use had to be found and also because Dalmia was connected with other cases. 

 Dalmias advocate, however, objected to grant of police custody.

 Dalmia was arrested in Delhi on February 12.

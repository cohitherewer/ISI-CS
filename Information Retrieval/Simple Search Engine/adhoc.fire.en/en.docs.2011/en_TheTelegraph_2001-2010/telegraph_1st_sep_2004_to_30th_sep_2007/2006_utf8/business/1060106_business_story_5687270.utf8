 New Delhi, Jan. 5: Personal computers (PC) and notebook sales are expected to get a fillip with increased demands from companies and small town buyers.

 The fall in prices of notebooks have led to a sales growth of 94 per cent during the first half of 2005-06.

 During the period, about 23.4 lakh units were sold. This encouraged MAIT ? the apex body of computer and peripheral manufacturers ? to revise sales projection for the year from 42.5 lakh to 47 lakh.

 According to MAIT, the first half of 2005-06 witnessed a 36 per cent jump in PC sales over the same period last year.

 Increased purchases by telecom, banking and financial services, manufacturing, and BPO companies contributed to the high growth in PC sales. Education and retail sectors also bought more.

 Sub-Rs 10,000 PCs have added to the sudden spurt in sales in small towns.

 MAIT executive director Vinnie Mehta said, PC penetration in India is still low. But we are confident that a pan-India deployment of broadband at a low cost, coupled with industry initiative of low-priced PCs, will soon lead to accelerated computer use in homes. 

 MAIT president Rajendra Kumar said, As the demand for computers rises, the government should aggressively attract investments in IT manufacturing in the country.

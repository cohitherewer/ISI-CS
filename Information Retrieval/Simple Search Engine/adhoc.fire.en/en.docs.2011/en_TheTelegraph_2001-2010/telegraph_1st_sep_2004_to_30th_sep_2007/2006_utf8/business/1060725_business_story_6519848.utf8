 Morocco beyond Tata Teas reach

 SOHINI MOOKHERJEA

 Calcutta, July 24: Tata Tea has lost out in the race to acquire the Moroccan tea and sugar company, the Societe Marocaine du The et du Sucre, popularly known as Somathes.

 The minimum bidding price for Somathes was set at $51.17 million or 440 million Moroccan dirhams. Moroccan Trade and Finance Holding (Homarcom) was the successful bidder with an offer of $59.88 million.

 Of the 25 companies which bid for Somathes, 19 put in their expressions of interest directly while six others, including Tata Tea, did it through bank advisers.

 Morocco is a large importer of green tea and China was an exclusive supplier to Somathes.

 According to industry experts, such an acquisition would have been a stepping stone for Tata Tea to the Chinese green tea market.

 In February, Tata Tea vice-chairman Krishna Kumar said the company was looking at business opportunities in China in the tea beverage segment. The company would thereby enter a new segment like health drinks, Kumar had added.

 To make inroads into the Czech and east European markets, Tata Tea (GB) Limited, UK, a subsidiary of Tata Tea, had signed a definitive agreement to acquire the assets of JEMCA, which is part of the Czech food processing company Alima Znac kova Potravina a.s. JEMCA has a 26.6 per cent share of the tea market in the Czech Republic. The Tetley group funded the deal. The negotiations started in 1995 and the $432-million deal was completed in 2000.

 Tata Teas other overseas acquisitions include FMALI Herb Inc and Good Earth Corporation through its US subsidiary, Tetley Holdings Ltd.

 Tata Coffee, a subsidiary of Tata Tea, recently acquired Eight Clock Coffee Company of the US from Gryphon Investors for a total cost of $220 million. On the BSE today, Tata Tea shares closed at Rs 736.40, up 1.69 per cent from a previous close of Rs 724.15.

 Q amp;A

 And thats flat

 I bought a flat in 2004 for Rs 14 lakh and paid registration charges of Rs 1,05,000. I took a home loan of Rs 12 lakh. The value of the flat is now Rs 36 lakh and I propose to sell the flat. How much capital gains tax I will have to pay?

 Dhiren Chowdhury, Calcutta

 ce you have held the flat for less than 36 months, the gain from the sale will be treated as a short-term capital gain. Any immovable property becomes a long-term capital asset only if it is held for more than three years. The capital gains will be Rs 14,95,000. The tax will be charged at the marginal rate at which you pay the income tax. 

 Doting father

 I gifted my daughter Rs 12 lakh at the time of her marriage. She wants to use the money to buy a house. Will there be any tax implication?

 Ashok Pal, Midnapore

 The income tax department can ask your daughter about the source of investment. If she shows it as a gift from you, the tax department may also seek your source of income. The department can serve a reassessment notice under Section 148 within a maximum period of six years from the end of the relevant assessment year. If no notice is received up to this time, you can be sure that no further investigation will be made. 

 Dutiful son

 My father is 85 years old and is suffering from prostrate cancer. My employer reimburses the costs related to the treatment. Will the reimbursement be taxable? 

 S. Debnath, Hooghly

 If you havent hospitalised your father, the reimbursement of expenditure for his treatment will be treated as a perquisite in your hand and will be taxable. However, if you are entitled to medical allowance, reimbursement of up to Rs 15,000 will not be treated as a perquisite under section 17(2). For any reimbursement over and above Rs 15,000, you can claim a deduction under Section 80DDB.

 New Delhi, June 21: Infocom 2006, the country?s biggest information, communication and technology (ICT) exposition, will kick off in Calcutta in the first week of December with leading European companies scheduled to participate in the event. Infocom, which started as an annual event in 2002, is organised by Nasscom and Businessworld, an ABP group publication.

 ABP Pvt Ltd has tied up with Deutsche Messe AG, organisers of world?s largest trade fair CeBIT, for Infocom 2006. Under the partnership, CeBIT will put up a special European pavilion where companies from Europe will exhibit their products and services. The alliance is expected to widen Asian participation too. Companies from Canada will also participate in the exposition.

 ?We are happy to announce the partnership with CeBIT, as it will add tremendous momentum to the growth of the IT industry,? Pramath Raj Sinha, managing director and chief executive officer of ABP Pvt Ltd, said.

 ?CeBIT has a large customer base in Europe. We will use our strong base to enable a large number of small and medium-sized companies to showcase their products and services in India,? said Eberhard Roloff, director central and eastern Europe, Deutsche Messe AG. ?CeBIT?s alliance could also result in greater participation by Asian countries, including China, Japan, Sri Lanka, Korea, Singapore and Malaysia.?

 ?It would be another four to five weeks before we would know which companies would be participating,? said Roloff. The European companies are likely to concentrate on IT, telecommunications and healthcare in India as these sectors offer a big market here, he added.

 Nasscom president Kiran Karnik said, ?For India to touch the $60-billion mark by 2010, which is the estimated growth figure for the domestic IT industry, we need to sustain growth. We are at the $24-billion mark in IT services exports. Part of this growth has to be sustained by consolidating and expanding to other parts of the country.?

 ?There is a huge untapped talent in Calcutta, which the industry can use,? Karnik added. As the traditional IT bases like Delhi, Mumbai, NCR and Bangalore are getting crowded, the industry had to look at other places, and turning eastward was ideal, he said.

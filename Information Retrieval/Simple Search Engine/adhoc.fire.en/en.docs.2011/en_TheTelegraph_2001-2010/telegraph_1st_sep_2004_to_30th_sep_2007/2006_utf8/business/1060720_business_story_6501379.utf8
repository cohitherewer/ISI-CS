 IDBI taste for private equity

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai July 19: After becoming a universal bank, IDBI Ltd is pursuing new business opportunities.

 The bank plans to float a wholly- owned subsidiary for its private equity business, as a follow-up to its favourable stint in venture capital. 

 The bank has also joined hands with Federal Bank and Fortis Insurance International for a life insurance company. An asset management company (AMC) for mutual funds is also on the cards.

 The board has approved the entry into private equity, chairman-cum-managing director V.P. Shetty told newspersons after the second annual general meeting of the company here today.

 The bank expects to roll out the business by the end of the year, though it is yet to decide on the corpus and the sectors for investment. 

 We have had a good experience with venture capital, where there has been more than 20 per cent yield on our investments. This gives us confidence about the private equity business, Shetty said. 

 He said the bank was also planning to demerge the primary dealership business from IDBI Capital Market Services Ltd.

 Earlier addressing shareholders, the IDBI chairman said that in a rapidly changing global environment the bank would not only fulfil its mandated role of providing development finance but would also focus on corporate, retail and priority sector lending. 

 The bank will also go full throttle in insurance and intends to venture abroad.

 The AGM was marred by employees shouting slogans to implement the wage agreement signed with the management in March.

 Shetty said the employees were demanding that the IDBI management link their wage structure to Reserve Bank of India norms. This was unacceptable to the government, he said, though the bank has agreed to pay the arrears according to RBI norms.

 Meanwhile, net profit of the bank for the first quarter increased 39 per cent to Rs 150.57 crore from Rs 108.51 crore a year ago. Interest earnings increased to Rs 1,383.73 crore from Rs 1,331.85 crore.

 Profit from sale of investments was up 22 per cent to Rs 148 crore from Rs 121 crore, comprising 52 per cent of other income. Cost of funds was down to 6.61 per cent from 7.14 per cent last year. 

 While deposits increased by 73 per cent, advances were up 10 per cent.

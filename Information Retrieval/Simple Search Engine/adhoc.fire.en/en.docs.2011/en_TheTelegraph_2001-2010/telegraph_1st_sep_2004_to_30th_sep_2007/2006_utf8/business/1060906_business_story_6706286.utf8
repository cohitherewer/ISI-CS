 Balaji Paper picks up sick outfit

 AMIT CHAKRABORTY

 Calcutta, Sept 5: City-based Balaji Paper, owned by the Agarwals, has acquired India Paper Pulp (IPP) at Naihati, North 24 Parganas, from the Bengal government.

 Manish Agarwal, director of Balaji Paper, said India Paper would resume production in six months. IPP is one of the countrys oldest concerns.

 The Bengal government, which took over IPP in the seventies, closed the mill in 2004 as it was suffering losses. The mill was then put up for sale under the state governments programme to reform public enterprises.

 Ardhendu Sen,the secretary to the state government at the department of public enterprises, said the mill was sold to Balaji Paper for Rs 11 crore. Since the government had cleared all arrears of the workers, the Agarwals acquired the unit on a clean slate basis. The mill is by the Hooghly and spread over 40 acres.

 IPP is the first public sector enterprise to be put on the block by the government. Sen said the state has also floated tenders for the sale of West Bengal Plywood and Apollo Zippers.

 The Agarwals will invest around Rs 60 crore to upgrade the facilities of IPP which has the capacity to produce 100 tpd of writing and printing paper.

 We also have plans to produce 

 newsprint by using imported pulp, Agarwal said.

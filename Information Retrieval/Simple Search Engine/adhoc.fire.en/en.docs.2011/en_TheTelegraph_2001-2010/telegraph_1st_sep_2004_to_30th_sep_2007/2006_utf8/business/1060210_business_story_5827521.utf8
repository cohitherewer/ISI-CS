 NCAER sees 7.8% growth

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 9: The National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER) has estimated that the economy would grow at 7.8 per cent during 2005-06.

 NCAER has arrived at this estimate in its quarterly review of the economy after taking into account the latest domestic and global developments. However, the 7.8 per cent growth rate has been estimated at 1993-94 prices. The review states: A quick calculation of conversion of base year of GDP estimates suggests that our 7.8 per cent growth in 2005-06 at 1993-94 base would be equivalent to 8.0 per cent growth in 2005-06 at 1999-2000 prices.

 Agriculture will grow by 3.4 per cent, while industry will clock a growth of 8.0 per cent and the services sector 9.3 per cent, according to the review. This will be the first year after independence when GDP growth would touch the 8 per cent mark without a substantial contribution from agriculture, it said.

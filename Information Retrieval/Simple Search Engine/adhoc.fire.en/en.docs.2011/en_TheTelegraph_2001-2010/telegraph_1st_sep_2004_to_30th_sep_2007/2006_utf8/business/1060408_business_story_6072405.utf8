 Corporate India hails Nath recipe

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 7: Industry chambers today welcomed the initiatives announced in the foreign trade policy.

 Ficci president Saroj Poddar said the measures would push up rural growth, create jobs, cut transaction costs and help exporters in diversifying to markets that have remained so far relatively under-exploited.

 Welcoming the announcement on remission of service tax and fringe benefit tax in various duty neutralisation schemes, he urged the government for its early notification.

 Poddar said expansion of the Vishesh Krishi Upaj Yojana and new focus product scheme would help in the growth of the rural economy.

 The new schemes would stimulate our exports and employment from rural and semi-urban areas which would help in reducing poverty in these areas, Poddar said. 

 Similar views were echoed by the Confederation of Indian industry (CII). The policy reflects a pragmatic approach to boost exports from the country, it said.

 Focus product scheme and focus market scheme would provide a thrust to manufacturing and exports of several products and will help diversify the export markets for India, CII said.

 The focus market scheme, which will allow duty credit facility of 2.5 per cent of the f..b. value of exports of all products to the notified countries, especially in South America, will boost exports to these new regions, the chamber said.

 CII said the new benefits to suppliers of special economic zones under the duty entitlement passbook scheme will help make supplies to these zones more attractive. The decision to offer the facility to import the required inputs before exports and the ability to transfer the scrip once the export obligation is over provides the right flexibility to exporters, said CII.

 Assocham president Anil K. Agarwal said the policy will decelerate the gap between imports and exports and help India achieve a double digit growth in the near future as the policy pronouncements are full of incentives to exporters and Indian industry. 

 Indo-American Chamber of Commerce president B. Prabhakar said surge in exports in coming years will depend mostly on reduction in transaction cost, labour reforms and infrastructure revamp like de-congesting the sea and air ports and faster movement of export consignments from hinterland to ports.

 Bakul R. Mehta, chairman of the Gem and Jewellery Export Promotion Council, said the policy provides the right measures to the industry in transforming itself into a global hub for the gem and jewellery industry. 

 The government has announced favourable policy measures for the industry that will not only help boost exports by 20-25 per cent but will pave the way for increased FDI, Mehta said.

 Santosh Saraf, president, Merchant Chamber of Commerce, has commended commerce minister Kamal Nath for the provision that the incidence of unrebated service tax and fringe benefit tax on exports would be factored in the various duties on neutralisation and remission schemes. 

 The introduction of the duty free import authorisation scheme was welcomed as it would ensure economies of scale in respect of import of inputs required for export production.

 The move to expand the Vishesh Krishi Upaj Yojana to include village industry-based products for export benefits under the Vishesh Krishi Upaj aur Gram Udyog Yojana is a significant step to bolster the rural economy, feels Santosh Rungta, president, Bharat Chamber of Commerce.

 Rakesh Shah, EEPC chairman, said the EDI initiatives would help remove the transaction cost to the relief of the export community. 

 However, Fieo eastern region chief S.K. Jain said focus product and focus market fell short of the erstwhile target plus scheme.

 Telecom parts to fetch $2bn

 New Delhi, Dec. 29 (PTI) The country could attract about $2 billion worth investment in telecom equipment manufacturing in the next three years.

 At present, the total FDI in telecom manufacturing is about Rs 1,000 crore, which is expected to touch $2 billion or Rs 9,000 crore over the next three years, telecom minister Dayanidhi Maran said.

 Telecom equipment manufacturing revenue is also expected to double in the next one year from the current about Rs 17,000 crore to Rs 35,000 crore, Maran said.

 Global majors are exploring India for production of switches, gearbox, hand-sets and other wireless equipment.

 Rising demand for a wide range of telecom equipment, particularly in the area of mobile telecommunications, has provided excellent opportunities to domestic and foreign investors in the manufacturing sector, he said.

 India, adding up to six million wireless subscribers a month and having recently surpassed China, promises to be a market with huge demand potential.

 Oil bailout package in pipeline

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 11: Petroleum minister Murli Deora will meet finance minister P. Chidambaram next week to work out a bailout package for state-run oil companies. 

 There was no conclusion in the last meeting. We will meet the finance minister next week, Deora said. 

 The petroleum minister wants to put in place a subsidy mechanism for LPG and kerosene on the same lines as the food and fertiliser subsidy. 

 The oil companies have been suffering heavy losses as crude prices have skyrocketed, whereas the rates of LPG, kerosene, petrol and diesel have not been increased. 

 Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum, Hindustan Petroleum and IBP have reported a collective loss of over Rs 800 crore on selling petrol and diesel at a discounted price and LPG and kerosene below the cost of production during the first fortnight of April alone. 

 The situation appears to be going from bad to worse with New York light crude touching a record $70 per barrel today. The Indian basket of crude imports is around $10 per barrel cheaper but moves in tandem with world prices of these light crudes.

 In the budget, finance minister P. Chidambaram had introduced a cess on upstream oil companies ONGC and OIL, which are also compensating the downstream oil marketing companies for the subsidy on LPG and kerosene. 

 Deora feels the cess should be used to finance the subsidy. 

 Deora had urged Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to put in place a mechanism like the food and fertiliser subsidies to compensate the public sector oil companies. The meeting, held on March 13, was attended by Chidambaram and C. Rangarajan, chairman of the PMs economic advisory council. After the first meeting, Singh had asked Chidambaram and Deora to come back within a month with a roadmap on implementation of the Rangarajan Committee recommendations.

 The current subsidy of Rs 22.5 per cylinder on LPG covered only a tenth of the differential between the retail selling price and cost of production. Similarly, the Rs 0.82-per- litre on kerosene was only a fraction of the Rs 13-per-litre difference between cost and sale price.

 The Rangarajan committee on fuel pricing has suggested a steep rise of Rs 75 in the price of cylinders used in domestic cooking gas and a Rs 1.21 per litre increase in petrol and Rs 1.96 per litre hike in diesel rates.

 While the budget had fallen far short of the expectations of the oil companies, Deora had managed to wrest some post-budget concessions for them from Chidambaram. 

 In a meeting with Deora, Chidambaram had agreed to allow the cash-strapped oil marketing companies to borrow funds from the Oil industry Development Board and had said government guarantees will be extended to them for loans to import crude oil.

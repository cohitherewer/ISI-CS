 Policy seeks fiscal sops

 Dev: Energy concern

 New Delhi, Sept. 7: Domestic carmakers have sought tax holidays and sops for investments over Rs 500 crore. 

 The draft automotive policy released by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam) today seeks fiscal incentives for the auto sector on the same lines as those enjoyed by large infrastructure projects in the country.

 The draft policy states that the auto sector should be granted concessions on land and power like those given by state governments to IT companies.

 The government will henceforth support those companies that will achieve substantial reduction in energy consumption and at the same time look for use of alternative fuels, including hybrids, Union minister for heavy industries Santosh Mohan Dev said at the annual general meeting of Siam here today.

 According to Dev, the two major challenges before the auto industry are: development of efficient engines to minimise energy consumption and promotion of alternative fuels and hybrid.

 We have completed the first phase of liberalisation, which was only investment-oriented. Now, we are in the second phase where we will look for investment in innovation and energy security, the minister said.

 The draft policy sees the turnover of the auto industry growing at 16 per cent every year till 2016 to touch $145 billion from $34 billion at present.

 With this kind of growth, the contribution of the auto sector to the GDP will increase to 12 per cent in the next 10 years from 5 per cent at present, Anand Mahindra, member of the Siam development council for automobile and allied industries and vice-chairman of Mahindra amp; Mahindra, said. 

 Incentives sought by the industry include tax deductions of 100 per cent of export profits, one-stop clearances for FDI proposals in the automotive sector and deduction of 30 per cent of net income for 10 years for new industrial undertakings.

 The industry has also asked for concessions on import duty on machinery to set up a plant or expand capacity. It also wants a deduction of 50 per cent on foreign exchange earnings of automotive firms.

 There is a need for wider public debate on the draft so that the document can be inclusive, Dev said, adding that the government would like to announce the automotive action plan by the year-end.

 The plan aims at making India a destination of choice in Asia for design and manufacture of automobiles and automotive components.

 The government would play the role of a facilitator, Dev said. 

 According to the minister, the national automotive testing and R amp;D infrastructure project, coming up at a cost of Rs 1,718 crore, would be ready by 2008. It will provide the industry an excellent infrastructure in testing, homolgation and certification.

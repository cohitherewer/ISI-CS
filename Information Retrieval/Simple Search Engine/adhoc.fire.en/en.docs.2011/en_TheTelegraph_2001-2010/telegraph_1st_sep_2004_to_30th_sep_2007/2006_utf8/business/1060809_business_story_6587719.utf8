 Calcutta, Aug. 8: Fresh from acquiring Eight Clock Coffee, the Tatas, through Tata Tea, are planning more acquisitions in the US. 

 The acquisitions will help the company to reach the turnover target of Rs 7,000 crore in the next three years from Rs 3,000 crore now. The target has been set by the global management board of the company.

 For the acquisitions, we will have tea as a base in some form, including bottled, speciality, flavoured, strawberry, the whole gamut of ready-to- drink and value-added products, which is the trend in global markets, said R.K. Krishna Kumar, vice-chairman, Tata Tea Limited. The range would also include coffee products.

 Since the tastes and preferences of US consumers mirror that of other developed regions, such as the EU, the US acquisitions will help Tata Tea ascertain the trends in other markets, which the company can leverage when it expands further. 

 We want to keep pushing our frontiers all the time so that acquisitions in the US would help us become strong players in the European markets, Kumar said.

 The company may use Europe as a platform to enter Russia and later China, which has a big market for extracts from green tea, Kumar added.

 The company has already sensed some prized targets and is in serious negotiations with two to three players.

 Tata group chairman Ratan Tata said the long-term plan was to create a global splash with useful derivatives of tea. The base would be expanded with future products which have their genesis in tea but would focus on wellness products which draw from intrinsic properties like anti-oxidants and merits of green tea extracts, he said.

 Tata Tea also plans to turn US-based Eight Clock Coffee, acquired recently by subsidiary Tata Coffee, into a global brand with planned forays into Russia, Central Europe and even India. 

 Kumar said future acquisitions would be financed through a mix of debt and other instruments. He said the company was comfortable with handling large volumes of debt, citing the case of the Tetley acquisition six years ago that was financed mainly by debt. 

 The issue, Kumar said, has more to do with the intrinsic worth of the target company and not funds.

 He said the Tata group will play a role in acquisitions as it is in the interest of the group to be an important global player.

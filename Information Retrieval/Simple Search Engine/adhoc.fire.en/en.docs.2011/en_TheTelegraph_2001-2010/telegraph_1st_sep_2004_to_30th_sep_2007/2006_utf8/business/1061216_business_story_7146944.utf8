 Petroleum price cut reins in inflation

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, Dec. 15: The recent cut in prices of petrol and diesel had the desired impact on prices and the inflation rate dipped to 5.16 per cent.

 The wholesale prices-based annual inflation rate declined to 5.16 per cent for the week ended December 2, from 5.30 per cent and 5.45 per cent in the two previous weeks. 

 Concerned over inflation rising to a 18-month high of 5.45 per cent in the third week of November, the government slashed petrol and diesel prices by Rs 2 and Re 1 per litre respectively on November 29, taking advantage of a moderation of global oil prices. 

 Aware that the fuel price cut alone would not be enough to contain prices, the Reserve Bank announced a 0.5 per cent hike in the cash reserve ratio on December 8. The move is aimed to suck out some liquidity to moderate credit growth and thereby contain prices. CRR is the percentage of deposits banks park with the central bank.

 The RBI has raised short term interest rates four times this year, besides the CRR hike, to contain inflation in the projected range of 5-5.5 per cent for 2006-07. 

 The government has earlier made some relaxations on imports of essential food items to ease supply side constraints. 

 Even the members of the ruling Congress have appealed to finance minister P. Chidambaram to rein in prices of essential commodities like wheat, edible oil, pulses and vegetables. 

 The government will not hesitate to take further fiscal measures to tackle inflationary pressure, which was natural in a high growth economy, Chidambaram told Parliament yesterday. The Indian economy grew 9.1 per cent in the first half of this fiscal. 

 The wholesale price index (WPI) for all commodities fell by 0.4 per cent to 207.8 points.

 Anxious wait for report card

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Oct. 10: There is a strong mood of optimism as the second quarter earnings season opens on Wednesday. From banks to oil, and from cement to software services, India Inc is expected to push another set of robust numbers on the back of a strong economy that grew 8.9 per cent in the first quarter.

 The Bangalore-based IT services bellwether Infosys Technologies will be among the first to unveil its financial performance for the second quarter ended September 30. Although Infosys and its peers are expected to post a healthy set of numbers, corporate mavens believe that the same picture will be seen across sectors.

 Its not the IT sector alone that will do better this time around. We expect many industries, which posted numbers that were way below expectations in the first quarter, to fare better this time around. Banking should be one such sector. Cement, automobiles and telecom will also show a robust performance. Oil could also be a pleasant surprise, says a research head from a leading brokerage.

 The analyst added that a major reason contributing to this outlook is the state of the Indian economy. While banks continue to see good demand for advances with estimates saying that they continue to grow at over 30 per cent, commodity prices have largely remained firm. A case in point is that of cement where even during the monsoon season, prices were higher than that compared with the same period last year. Automobile companies have been reporting healthy sales while telecom companies have ramped up their subscriber bases significantly.

 After the first quarter results were announced, oil and banking sectors did not participate. This is because, results of Reliance Industries Ltd, State Bank of India and others did not meet the expectations of many. However, from now on, they should start participating, said a broker.

 Infosys, which usually sets the tone in the equity markets during the earnings season, is not expected to disappoint. The second quarter results of the Indian IT services sector are expected to be healthy. For second quarter 2006-07, we expect the average topline growth of companies to be at 7.8 per cent quarter-on-quarter and 40.1 per cent year-on-year and net profit growth at 12.5 per cent quarter-on-quarter and 38.8 per cent year-on-year, said Edelweiss in a report.

 The brokerage expects Infosys to close the second quarter with revenues of Rs 3,290 crore, a sequential growth of over 9 per cent and net profit of Rs 860 crore, a growth of over 8 per cent. On the BSE today, the Infosys share closed at Rs 1,906, a gain of 0.5 per cent, after rising to Rs 1,950, the highest since 2002.

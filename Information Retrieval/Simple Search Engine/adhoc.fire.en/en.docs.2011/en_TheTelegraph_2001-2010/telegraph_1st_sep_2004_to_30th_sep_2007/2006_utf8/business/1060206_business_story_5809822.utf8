 The sunset clause

 We spend sleepless nights on retirement planning. Srikumar Bondyopadhyay checks out what?s available

 If your monthly household expenditure is Rs 10,000 today, guess how much you will have to spend every month 30 years hence to maintain the same standard of living? 

 It is Rs 37,561 if we assume an annual inflation rate of 4.51 per cent ? the current rate. The value of Rs 10,000 will go down to Rs 2,504.59 then.

 Started worrying about post-retirement savings? In India, retirement benefits, in one form or the other, are available to only about 11 per cent of the working population (which is between 43 and 45 crore now), including government employees, according to the Economic Survey 2004-05. This means that 89 per cent, or 38 to 40 crore employees don?t have any pension income to fall back on after retirement. 

 Options available

 For this large number of people as well as for professionals and private practitioners, the way out is a voluntary pension system comprising the Public Provident Fund and the superannuation, gratuity and pension plans of life insurance companies. 

 The mandatory Employees Provident Fund and Employees Pension Scheme 1995 cover only employees in the organised sector. 

 While in PPF a subscriber can contribute any amount between Rs 100 and Rs 70,000 a year, the rate of return is linked to the small savings rate. The pension plans of life insurers are mostly market-linked and don?t give any assured benefit on maturity.

 Then there are private provident funds, such as Birla Brothers Provident Fund, which give memberships to private sector companies in the organised sector that are not covered by or excluded from the EPFO. 

 The shortcomings

 However, the scope of enough accumulation of pension wealth under the EPF and EPS schemes is limited because the employee?s contribution (12 per cent) is restricted to a maximum basic salary of Rs 6,500. Though the contribution can be increased up to a maximum of 20 per cent (of Rs 6,500), for this the employer must be willing to raise its matching contribution, too. In most cases, companies don?t entertain this. 

 Again, only 8.33 per cent of the employer?s contribution of 12 per cent goes to the Employees Pension Scheme. 

 With private provident funds, however, there is often no such cap on the basic salary.

 For voluntary pension schemes, there exists a distortion in terms of tax treatment. While a maximum contribution of Rs 70,000 in PPF is fully tax deductible under section 80C of the Income Tax Act, the tax benefit on contribution to personal pension plans is only Rs 10,000 a year. 

 New pension scheme

 The Centre has come out with a new pension scheme which is mandatory for central government employees joining January 1, 2004 and voluntary for others.

 It is a two-tier system. The first tier is for government employees and the second for voluntary contributors. The government will not contribute anything to the second tier fund. Private fund managers will be allowed to manage the pension corpus. Subscribers can choose their preferred fund manager as well as the type of fund. There will be four types of funds ? a default plan, a secured plan, a balanced fund and a growth fund.

 A new regulator, Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority, will oversee the pension funds.

 However, employees of private sector companies, which are already members of the EPFO, can join the new pension scheme only on a voluntary basis and without a matching contribution from the employer.

 The caveat

 Life insurance companies which are now selling pension plans will have to hive off their pension business into a separate entity. ?The pure pension plans of the life insurers will definitely come under PFRDA, while their insurance business will be regulated by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority,? said PFRDA chairman D. Swarup. ?Some concerns still remain in this area,? he added. A clash of interest is likely to happen.

 The existence of a market for longest-term bonds is a prerequisite for the growth of the pension sector. ?In India, the longest-term bonds having a maturity of 25 years were floated by the LIC. The government must float securities with 30-35 years of maturity,? said Swarup.

 The puzzles in the pension sector are yet to be solved. Till then, options for investors will be limited.

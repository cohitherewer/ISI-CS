 Asbestos gives rude shock to Philips bottomline

 The blues

 Amsterdam, Oct. 16 (Reuters): Philips Electronics missed analysts forecasts on Monday with a fall in third-quarter core profit, depressed by disappointing LCD display sales and asbestos charges, hurting its shares. 

 Shares of the Dutch TVs-to-hospital equipment maker fell 0.7 per cent, as revenues slipped from a year earlier and core operating profit, excluding various charges, rose slightly. 

 Net profit was 4.24 billion euros ($5.3 billion), including a gain, also of 4.24 billion euros, on the sale of its semiconductors business. Excluding the chip unit sale, analysts had expected 257 million euros net profit, according to the median of 15 forecasts compiled by Reuters. 

 The results were hit by an unexpected charge of 265 million euros for asbestos-related liabilities dating back to the 1970s, which should cover the company until 2016. 

 The big negative is the asbestos claim, that came out of the blue. They had talked about it in the past and taken small charges, but this a large charge and its not something we like to see, said analyst Eric de Graaf at broker Petercam. 

 Net profit a year earlier was 1.436 billion euros, with one-off gains of well over a billion euros. Chief financial officer Pierre-Jean Sivignon said comparisons with the previous year were difficult due to the avalanche of exceptional items. 

 (These results) are difficult to read, he told journalists in a conference call, stressing that Philipss four core operations of lighting, medical systems, domestic appliances and consumer electronics had improved their joint operating margin. 

 We expect this momentum to continue as we round out the year. This quarter was a big step forward because we have concluded the semiconductor sale, he said, adding Philipss sales and earnings would become less volatile. 

 With 3.4 billion euros of net cash, the company confirmed plans to hand back 4 billion euros to shareholders through share buybacks, and said it would buy shares worth 2.5 billion euros before the end of the year and the rest next year. 

 The maker of shavers, televisions, lamps and x-ray machines is the third major electronics company to publish results after rivals General Electric of the United States, which posted increases of 12.3 per cent in sales and 6 per cent in earnings, and Samsung Electronics with mixed results. 

 Revenues undershot expectations, falling to 6.31 billion euros from 7.62 billion a year earlier and compared with a median analyst forecast of 6.53 billion. The decline was the result of the sale of the semiconductor business in the quarter. 

 The numbers look in line with expectations, if you exclude all charges, (but) sales are a little shy of expectations due to consumer electronics, said analyst Jan Willem Berghuis at Dutch broker Kempen amp; Co.

 Ruia: Steering ahead

 Calcutta, July 30: After acquiring Dunlop and Falcon Tyres, the Calcutta-based Ruia Group is on the prowl again. It is eyeing Mumbai-based Monotona Tyres Ltd, which mainly makes tyres for two wheelers.

 The Ruia Group has carried out a due diligence of Monotona?s facility in Wada, Thane, which is about 90 kilometres from Mumbai.

 Market sources said the negotiation has gained pace, and the deal could be finalised within a month.

 When contacted by The Telegraph, Omprakash Bhutada, executive director and company secretary of Monotona, confirmed that talks were on between the two companies, but clarified that ?nothing has been finalised yet. Talks are still at an exploratory stage?.

 Ruia Group chairman Pawan Ruia, however, was not available for comment.

 Monotona is an unlisted company. It was incorporated in 1995 by Monotona Exports Ltd, the flagship company of the group having interest in garments export.

 Since 1997, it has been supplying tyres and tubes to Bajaj Auto Ltd under the brand name MTL RACER. It also supplies to Kinetic and LML. 

 The company has a sizeable presence in the retail market through distributors across the country.

 Monotona has ventured into many export markets like South America, West Asia, Africa and the Saarc countries.

 It also manufactures three and four-wheeler tyres and tubes.

 Monotona?s turnover is about Rs 175 crore and Ruia might stump up Rs 100-150 crore to acquire it.

 The acquisition will fit into the Ruia Group?s existing tyre business portfolio.

 Falcon Tyres has a 22 per cent market share in the two and three-wheeler segments.

 If Ruia manages to pull this acquisition, Monotona could eventually be merged with Falcon.

 Falcon markets its products under the Dunlop brand in India. It has a capacity to make 9 million pieces of tyres and tubes a year.

 The company recorded a turnover of Rs 255 crore and a net profit of Rs 3.6 crore last fiscal. For next fiscal, Ruia had forecast a profit of Rs 70 crore and a turnover of Rs 1,000 crore.

 For this fiscal, Falcon?s targeted topline is Rs 360 crore and bottomline Rs 6 crore.

 The development comes at a time when the tyre market is looking up. All companies have improved profitability after passing off high input costs to consumers.

 Ruia seems to have ironed out issues with the unions at Dunlop, and the operations will resume in a couple of months.

 With the possibility of this acquisition, and Dunlop soon to be back on its feet, the Ruia Group will turn out to be a formidable player in the tyre industry.

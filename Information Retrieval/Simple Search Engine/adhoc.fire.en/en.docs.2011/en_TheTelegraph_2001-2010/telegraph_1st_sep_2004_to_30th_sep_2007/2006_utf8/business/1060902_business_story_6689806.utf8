 Ally puts Assam Co in a jam

 Chawdhry: Zapped!

 Calcutta, Sept. 1: The relationship between Assam Company and Canoro Resources of Canada the two partners in the Amguri oil and gas block in Assam is growing increasingly frosty.

 Assam Company Limited (ACL), which holds a 40 per cent participating interest in the block, has found itself in a spot as Canoro, which is the operator of the oil and gas field and holds the remaining 60 per cent in the venture, has failed to inform ACL that it started commercial production there in April almost five months ago! 

 In its first quarter consolidated financial statement filed last month with SEDAR (System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval, Canada), Canoro said it had not only started commercial production at Amguri from April 1 but it also showed a revenue of $337,482 and a net loss of $494,998 from its Indian operations during the reporting quarter. The company has also declared the value of its total Indian assets of $29,887,337. 

 The failure to inform Assam Company about the development has forced the company to put off the finalisation of its own first-quarter results. 

 When the board of Assam Company met on August 28 to review the results for the first quarter of the current financial year, it could not arrive at a consensus and postponed the meeting by a day.

 While surfing Canoros website, we find that they had included the figures for Amguri operations in their April-June quarter results. We didnt have those data as we had no knowledge about the commencement of operations at Amguri oil field, said Abhay Chawdhry, chief financial officer of Assam Company Ltd. ACL showed that product testing was going on.

 This revelation prompted the company to again postpone its board meeting to September 2.

 Canadian companies get two months time to file their quarterly results while we get only one month. Since Canoro was the operator of this block, we expected it to keep us informed about the status of the project but they failed to do so. As a result, we are in default and our returns shown for the quarter are wrong, said Chawdhry. 

 ACL is now in regular touch with the CFO of Canoro and expects a letter of apology from them on this issue.

 Chawdhry said the company was awaiting certain clarifications from Canoro for their books of accounts for the Amguri project. Hopefully, this will not have any bearing on our partnership in future, Chawdhry said.

 The joint venture produces 1,000 barrels per day oil from two wells from January 26. It has a target to dig two more wells this year. In 2006, the consortium hopes to produce 250,000 bpd of oil.

 Stocks get caught in monsoon rain

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, July 3: Whether on the rain-swept roads of Mumbai or on the bourses, investors chose to tread cautiously today. Volumes and the level of activity was low and the BSE sensex advanced by 86 points to close at 10695.26 in a relatively range-bound trade.

 Brokers said most of the transactions were confined to frontline counters. Participants were not in a tearing hurry to raise their positions as they waited for the markets to consolidate at the current levels, particularly after the huge rise witnessed last week.

 The sensex fluctuated in a range of 10729.92 and 10589.46 before ending the day at 10695.26 against Fridays close of 10609.25, a net rise of 86.01 points or 0.81 per cent. The National Stock Exchanges (NSE) S amp;P CNX Nifty also shot up by 22.75 points, or 0.73 per cent, to 3150.95 from the previous close of 3128.20.

 In Mumbai, trading activity was affected following disruption of transport services because of the heavy rains for the third consecutive day. Cues from the Asian markets were positive with the Nikkei ending up 66.44 points and the Hang Seng by 59.04 points. 

 Metal counters hogged the limelight today. Steel and aluminium stocks saw some interest on news of price hikes by companies like JSW Steel, Hindalco and Nalco. Banking, FMCG and software shares also witnessed good gains. However, most of the auto shares ended in the red as investors were not very happy with the sales figures announced by the sector today. 

 Some of the major gainers included Reliance Industries (RIL), Infosys, State Bank of India, Hindustan Lever among others. The volume of business was extremely low at Rs 2,411.50 crore.

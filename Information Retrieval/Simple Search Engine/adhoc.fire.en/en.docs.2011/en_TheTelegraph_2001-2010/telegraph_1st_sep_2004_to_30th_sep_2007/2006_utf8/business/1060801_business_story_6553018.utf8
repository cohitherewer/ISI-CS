 Talwar: New plans

 Mumbai, July 31: Temasek, the Singapore government?s investment arm, has obtained permission to float a mutual fund in the country through an asset management company in which it owns a 55 per cent stake. 

 The mutual funds will be launched by Lotus India Asset Management Company (AMC), a joint venture between Fullerton Fund Management Group and Sabre Capital Worldwide. Fullerton is wholly owned by Temasek. 

 The AMC is sponsored by Alexandra Fund Management, an affiliate of Fullerton and also wholly owned by Temasek. Sabre Capital owns 20 per cent in the AMC, while the remaining 25 per cent is being held by the employee trust fund of Lotus. 

 ?Lotus India AMC is well poised to tap the growing savings and investment in one of the fastest growing economies in the world,? said Rana Talwar, chairman, Lotus India AMC. 

 ?Given the 61 per cent growth in the assets under management of mutual funds over the last year and of 36 per cent over the last three years, coupled with a penetration of less than 2 per cent of households, we feel that the Indian mutual fund industry offers strong growth potential,? added Talwar. 

 ?We had the in-principle approval from Sebi for almost a year and already have our infrastructure in place with 115 employees across 29 cities and over 4,000 distributor tie-ups,? said Talwar. 

 ?We have already invested in a scale that will allow us to rapidly build this business towards our objective of Rs 25,000 crore of assets under management within the first few years of operations. Over the next few quarters, we are targeting a presence in the top 100 cities and a distribution footprint that ranks among the top five fund houses in India,? said Ajay Bagga, chief executive officer, Lotus India AMC. 

 Sandeep Sabharwal had been appointed as the chief investment officer (equities) and Nandkumar Surti had been appointed chief investment officer (debt).

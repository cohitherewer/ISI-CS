 Vodafone in rejig mode

 The way ahead

 London, April 6 (Reuters): Vodafone unveiled a new organisational structure on Thursday aimed at cutting costs in mature markets, boosting growth in emerging markets and tapping new technologies. 

 The mobile phone giant, battling with slower growth in core markets such as Germany and Italy, said it would be managed through three new business units ? Europe; Central Europe, West Asia, Asia Pacific and Affiliates; and new businesses and innovation. 

 The revamp also includes the latest in a series of management changes by chief executive Arun Sarin, who has come under fire for the sluggish performance of Vodafones shares. 

 Analysts said the new structure better reflected the challenges facing Vodafone, and were particularly interested by the firms pledge to look at extending its reach in new technology areas such as converged services, which link mobile and fixed-line devices, and Internet services. 

 This is an interesting statement because it gives some indication of their strategy update thats going to happen at the full-year results (on May 30), said Tajesh Tailor at SG. 

 He said the focus on new technologies raised the question whether Vodafone would have to make acquisitions, or whether it would be able to rent infrastructure it does not already own. 

 A Vodafone spokesman said it was too early to say how the firm would look to extend its position in new technologies. 

 I wouldnt necessarily jump just to the conclusions that we ourselves will be pulling loads of fixed-line business or anything else, he said. It may be that we partner up with someone else who already does that. Its all highly speculative at this stage. quot; 

 At 0945 GMT, Vodafone shares were up 1.6 per cent at 125-1/2 pence, valuing the firm at ?75 billion. The shares have underperformed the European telecoms sector by around 12 per cent over the past year.

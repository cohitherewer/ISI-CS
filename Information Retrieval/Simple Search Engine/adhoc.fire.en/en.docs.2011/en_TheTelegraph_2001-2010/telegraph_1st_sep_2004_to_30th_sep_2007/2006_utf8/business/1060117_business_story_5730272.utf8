 December exports make a turnaround

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Jan. 16: After registering a decline in November, Indias exports clocked a 16.19 per cent growth in December to touch the $8.2-billion-mark, according to official data released today.

 To provide fillip to the export surge and remove roadblocks, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has agreed to meet exporters on January 24 to listen to their problems. 

 The exporters have been complaining about the levy of various taxes and uncertainty regarding the duty entitlement passbook scheme. They feel that the levy of fringe benefit tax, value-added tax and service tax has reduced their global competitiveness, and the uncertainty surrounding the duty entitlement passbook scheme has added to their woes.

 Commerce minister Kamal Nath has already taken up these issues with finance minister P. Chidambaram. I am bullish on exports, Nath said. 

 The countrys exports during the first nine months of the current fiscal clocked a growth of over 18 per cent to scale $66.4 billion, up from $56.2 billion in the corresponding period of 2004-05.

 However, exports slipped by 11.38 per cent in November to $6.16 billion from $6.95 billion in the same month a year ago. The decline during November also pulled down the overall growth during April-November 2005 to 16.07 per cent. It was 22.08 per cent for the April-October period. 

 Exports, in rupee term, grew 20.58 per cent to Rs 37,807.74 crore in December 2005 compared with the same month in 2004.

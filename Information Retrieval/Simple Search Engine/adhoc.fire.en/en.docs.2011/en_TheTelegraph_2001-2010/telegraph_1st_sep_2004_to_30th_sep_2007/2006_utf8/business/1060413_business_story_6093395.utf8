 Purnendu spurns offer on Haldia Petro stake

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Argument continues

 New Delhi, April 12: The dispute surrounding Haldia Petrochemicals looks far from over with The Chatterjee Group today refusing to sell its stake to the Bengal government even as the Company Law Board deferred the matter for further hearing till July 4.

 The CLB, which had earlier suggested that the state government ? through the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation ? either buy TCGs stake or sell its own to resolve the matter, also gave a go-ahead to the HPL board meeting but warned both parties against raising contentious issues.

 Acting on CLBs suggestion, the Bengal government had offered to buy rival TCGs entire holding in HPL at a price not lower than Rs 28.80 per share. The CLB had asked TCG to convey its response by today.

 However, during the proceedings today TCG rejected the proposal saying WBIDCs offer was not clear and there was no clarity on price. It demanded the appointment of an independent authority to value HPLs share price. 

 The TCG counsel alleged that the valuation is not proper and the offer is not clear. Therefore, we are not accepting it. We will argue the matter. 

 Lawyers of the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation (WBIDC) said there is no question of valuation in a buy or sale offer, since we are equally ready to buy The Chatterjee Groups share at that price. 

 Since TCG has rejected the offer, we will wait for CLBs decision, government sources said.

 TCG sources said the state government must decide on whether it wanted to buy or sale its stake in HPL. We are not a seller. But the government is willing to sell as well, the sources added.

 Analysts said any settlement could occur only after the elections. The state leadership is busy with the polls, and the Election Commission is keeping a close eye on the issue. Once the new government is sworn in, things will move faster, they said.

 WBIDCs proposal offered on March 31 to TCG said: On a day appointed by the CLB, WBIDC will, before the CLB, submit its offer in a sealed cover of the price per equity share not being lower than Rs 28.80 per equity share at which it is willing to sell all its shares and is equally willing at that same price to buy all the shares held by the Chatterjee Group.

 CLB chairman S. Balasubramanian rejected TCGs plea to postpone the board meeting on next Monday. ? the board meeting can be convened without having an effect on the rights and contention of either party before the CLB, he said in the order.

 The order also said that, The company shall pay auditors fees for the financial year 2004-05. 

 The West Bengal government, represented by the WBIDC, and TCG are the promoters of Haldia Petrochemicals Ltd.

 In a petition before the CLB, TCG had alleged that WBIDC had issued shares to Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) without its approval. TCG owns 58 per cent stake in the company.

 Before the petition was filed, WBIDC had offered to sell its 43 per cent stake to TCG. Since TCG failed to come forward with the money to buy its stake, WBIDC proceeded to sell 7.5% in HPL to IOC for Rs 150 crore. The sell valued WBIDCs share at Rs 860 crore.

 At a hearing last month, Chatterjees lawyers objected to the basis on which its consent was obtained by the West Bengal government for allotting shares to IOC.

 On the other hand, IOC and the WBIDC had on March 29, asked TCG to honour the board resolution approving allotment of shares to IOC. 

 TCG had pleaded before the CLB chairman to make the resolution void. In its petition, TCG has been seeking the cancellation of allotment of shares to IOC, claiming the oil PSUs motive in picking up the stake in HPL was to eventually take control of the firm.

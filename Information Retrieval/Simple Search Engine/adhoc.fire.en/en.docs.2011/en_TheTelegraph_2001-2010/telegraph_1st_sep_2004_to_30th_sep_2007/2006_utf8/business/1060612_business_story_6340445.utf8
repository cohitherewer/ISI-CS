 A fine balance by firms in debt

 Agarwal: Words of praise

 New Delhi, June 11: Cement, steel, textile, telecom and sugar companies, which shaved interest costs in the last quarter of 2005-06, will continue the trend in the first quarter of this fiscal despite an upward revision of bank rates. 

 Assochams Eco Pulse (AEP) analysis has shown that companies like Gujarat Ambuja Cement, Steel Authority of India, Dhampur Sugar Mills and Dabur India have managed their debt well, reducing their interest costs between 4 per cent and 84 per cent.

 The report said, Contrary to the expectations that the companies may have to bear a high burden on interest cost, most of them managed to not only keep their capital cost in check but also cut the interest cost by an aggregate 2.42 per cent, on the back of an 18 per cent rise in net profits. 

 The study covered 71 companies in cement, FMCG, textiles, energy, telecom, infotech, sugar, steel and pharmaceutical sectors. 

 Even though all banks have increased their prime lending rates by 50 to 100 basis points in the recent past, the well-performing firms may manage their debt well in the first quarter of this fiscal, because of the likelihood of consistent buoyancy in cash flows, net profits and demand and profit margin.

 The credit goes to the industry for adopting a smart strategy in managing their debt portfolio, Assocham president Anil K. Agarwal said. In the last quarter of 2005-06, the interest cost recorded by various companies across different sectors of the economy, such as cement, steel, telecom, textile and sugar, marked a reduction of 17 per cent on an aggregate. 

 The telecom sector took the lead by marking a decline of 35 per cent in its interest cost followed by sugar at 31 per cent, steel at 21 per cent, textile at 10.50 per cent and cement at 10 per cent.

 Jobs, not race, on Chirac radar

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 20: French President Jacques Chirac today said the rights and jobs of European people were connected with L.N. Mittals takeover bid for Arcelor and would be considered seriously while deciding the issue. He rejected allegations that reactions to the proposal were based on racist considerations. 

 In principle, we have nothing against a non-European taking over an European company, Chirac said in a press briefing after his meeting with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.

 He said a hostile bid had been made and no plan was given. We do not know the contents of the bid and I am not pre-judging anything. Hostile bids are contrary to practice, said Chirac.

 We have no notion of what the intention was or what lies ahead. When they bring out these facts, we will act on set principles, he said.

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said the matter came up for discussion during his bilateral talks with Chirac. The French President explained the position in detail and I hope a fair decision is taken, taking into account the interest of the stakeholders, he said. 

 Official sources confirmed that Mittal had called on the Prime Minister last evening ostensibly to discuss the matter.

 At a meeting jointly organised by the CII, Ficci and Assocham, Chirac underlined the need for values in forging commercial relationships between the companies of the two countries.

 France and India have never considered that globalisation meant the absence of rules. We wish that the necessary partnerships between companies of the two continents should be balanced, respectful of the others culture, respectful of each ones know-how and above all favourable to employment, he said.

 Arcelors board of directors has rejected a hostile takeover bid by Mittal Steel, saying it would hurt the group, its shareholders, employees and customers. 

 After a thorough review and analysis of the elements at its disposal, the board has swiftly concluded that Arcelor and Mittal Steel do not share the same strategic vision, business model and values, Arcelor had said in a statement issued after an extraordinary board meeting in Luxembourg. 

 Arcelor has asked shareholders not to tender their shares in the offer, which values them at 28.21 euro ($24.50) each. 

 Mittal has said the deal would create the worlds first 100-million-tonne-plus steel producer, with a market capitalisation of $40 billion (32.7 billion euros). It anticipated annual synergies of $1 billion (816 million euros). The Mittal bid was launched shortly after Arcelor offered a significant premium to win Canadian steelmaker Dofasco Inc in a bidding war with Germanys Thyssenkrupp AG.

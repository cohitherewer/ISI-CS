 Supreme Court stays Jet-Sahara proceedings

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 14: The Supreme Court today stayed proceedings on petitions filed by Jet Airways and Air Sahara before Bombay High Court and a Lucknow court after the Rs 2,300-crore acquisition deal between them collapsed.

 Soon after the Jet Airways-Air Sahara share purchase deal was grounded, both parties had moved courts claiming their rights over the advance money deposited in the escrow account with the ICICI Bank. 

 The stay was ordered by a three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice Y.K. Sabharwal while issuing notice on a petition by Jet Airways seeking transfer of Air Saharas arbitration petition from a Lucknow district court to Bombay High Court. 

 Besides seeking to club Air Saharas petition with the one filed by it at Mumbai, Jet Airways had also sought a stay on an interim order by the Lucknow district court freezing the escrow account.

 However, the court refused to grant any relief and said the order restraining Jet from withdrawing Rs 1,500 crore from the escrow account would continue till further orders.

 The court asked Air Sahara and ICICI bank to respond to the transfer petition by Jet Airways within two weeks. 

 Jet Airways, which had sought to purchase the existing equity shares of Air Sahara, could file its rejoinder within a week thereafter.

 Apprehending that Sahara India Commercial Corporation will not repay the advance amount in accordance with the agreement, Jet had petitioned before Bombay High Court on June 20. 

 While Air Sahara filed a plea before the Lucknow District judge seeking to restrain Jet from demanding the money deposited in the escrow account.

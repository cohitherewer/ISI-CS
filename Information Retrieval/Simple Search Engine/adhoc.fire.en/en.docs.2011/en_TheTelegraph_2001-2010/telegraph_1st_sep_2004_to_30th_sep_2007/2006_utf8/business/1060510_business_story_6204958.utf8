 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, May 9: The sensex closed above the 12,500-mark for the first time today. 

 The bellwether index oscillated 190 points between an intra-day high of 12,546.07 and a low of 12,356.04. It closed the day with a gain of 0.41 per cent, or 51.39 points, at 12,513.86.

 Total turnover on the BSE amounted to Rs 4,907 crore against yesterdays Rs 4,762 crore.

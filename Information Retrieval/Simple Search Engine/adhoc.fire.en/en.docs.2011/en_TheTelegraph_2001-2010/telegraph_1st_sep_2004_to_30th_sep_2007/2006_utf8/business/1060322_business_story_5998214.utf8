 Milestone march falters

 - Sensex scales the 11000-mark but fails to hold on to gains

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, March 21: Rubbing shoulders with the Dow Jones, the sensex today scaled the 11000-peak for the first time in history, sending the market into a frenzy. The joy was, however, shortlived as the bellwether index failed to close the day above the magical mark. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 11274.53 points on Monday.

 Incidentally, the sensex success came on a day when its Pakistani sibling ? the KSE-100 of Karachi ? too breached the 11000-mark.

 Other indices that hover above 11000 points are Hong Kongs Hang Seng, Japans Nikkei, Canadas TSE 300 and Brazils Bovespa. 

 The sensex, which began the day by hitting the magical 11000-level, continued its upward journey to 11004.07 points at 1230 hrs on aggressive buying in metal, pharma and PSU shares.

 However, the markets lost ground during the final hour of trade and the index ended the day at 10905.20, down 35.91 points or 0.3 per cent from yesterdays close.

 After conquering the 10000-point peak on February 7, the index took just 29 trading sessions to cross the 11000-mark. The sensex has risen 17 per cent in value so far this year, while it had surged by 42 per cent last calendar year.

 The nifty touched an all-time high of 3292.15 in intra-day trading, but closed at 3262.30, down 3.35 points or 0.10 per cent. 

 Foreign investors have pumped in a record $10.7 billion in 2005 and almost $3.5 billion more so far this year. The year 2006 has also seen 12 new mutual fund offers collecting Rs 16,287 crore, besides the money flowing into the existing schemes.

 It is a liquidity-driven market with mutual funds sitting on a pile of cash and foreign institutional investors continuing to buy, said Manish Sonthalia, vice-president (equity strategy), Motilal Oswal Securities.

 Market watchers also feel that the latest gains have been sparked by the governments plans to make the rupee fully convertible ? a liberalisation move, which should attract the much-needed foreign investment to fuel growth.

 While investors sold stocks from the banking, FMCG, software and telecom sectors, select energy, engineering, pharma and steel stocks managed to gain ground. The market breadth was negative ? about 918 shares advanced, 1571 declined, and 56 remained unchanged. 

 The total turnover today was Rs 46,893 crore.

 However, analysts and brokers continue to be concerned about the valuation. A couple of foreign brokerages have assigned underweight rating to India with the stock valuations looking stretched at the current levels.

 It is difficult to take a call at the current levels. While our year-end target for the sensex was 11500, it is close to those levels already, said Sonthalia.

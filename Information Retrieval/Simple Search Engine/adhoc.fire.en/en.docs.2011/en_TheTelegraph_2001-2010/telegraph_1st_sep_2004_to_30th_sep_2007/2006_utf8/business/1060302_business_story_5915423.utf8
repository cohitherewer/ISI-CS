 Selloff to be in small doses

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 1: The government plans to sell small stakes in up to eight non-navratna PSUs to raise about Rs 6000-7000 crore in financial year 2006-07. 

 Finance minister P. Chidambaram today said stake-sale in Power Finance Corporation and National Mineral Development Council has been finalised. 

 Divesting a small portion of the governments stake in these two profit-making PSUs has been cleared by the cabinet committee on economic affairs and would be carried out soon. 

 The government is also planning to sale its residual stake in Balco and Hindustan Zinc, but there are some legal glitches, officials said.

 The budget for 2006-07 has provided for raising Rs 3,084 crore from disinvestment, which would be put in the National Investment Fund. 

 About 75 per cent of the funds kitty will be spent on social sector projects including, education, health and employment, and the rest will be utilised for reviving sick PSUs.

 Chidambaram said sick PSUs, which cannot be revived, would be either closed down or sold off as mentioned in the UPA governments National Common Minimum Programme. 

 Senior finance ministry officials said the government would revive only those PSUs, which have been vetted by standards set by banks for normal business loans and found acceptable. 

 The revival programme will be partly supported by the investment fund, where proceeds from disinvestment are being ploughed in. Till now, revival packages of PSUs were coming from budgetary allocations. 

 Although this fund does not fall under budgetary allocations, actual revival packages will continue to be cleared by the cabinet.

 Sources said balance funds for reviving the sick PSUs would come as debts from banks and financial institutions as well as from the sale of assets. 

 Andrew Yule, Burn Standard, Hindustan Cables and Tyre Corporation of India are among the state-run companies likely to benefit from the revival programme. Others in queue are FACT and HOCL. 

 If the government decides to rope in a private partner while reviving a PSU, it would have two options ? either induct a minority partner with technical or financial expertise and no management control, or, hand over management control to the majority partner in case the firms revival is risky. 

 The decision to induct a private partner would solely depend on the need to gain technical, managerial and commercial expertise. 

 A note prepared on this issue states, The norm in developing the financial package must be that the government takes the responsibility for strengthening the equity base, while the financial institutions provide loans (without the need for government guarantee).

 The government may, however, have to bear the burden of waiving the interest cost and even the principal amount of outstanding loans, penalties and taxes, but in all cases, bankability must be a pre-requisite before rehabilitation proposal for a CPSE can go forward, it added.

 UWB rejig gains momentum

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Sept. 7: The Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) and Infrastructure Development Finance Corporation (IDFC) have proposed to pump Rs 70 crore into United Western Bank (UWB). 

 While Sicom has promised to invest Rs 70 crore, the Maharashtra government will infuse Rs 210 crore, according to a rehabilitation package for the ailing UWB.

 On Wednesday, the UWB board agreed to submit the scheme of reconstruction of the bank under section 45(4)(d) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The infusion of capital by Sicom, the Maharashtra government and HDFC/IDFC is in the scheme. 

 This scheme was submitted to the central bank today. Sources said the scheme also outlines a revamp of the banks board by inducting new members.

 Simultaneously, IDFC has informed the stock exchanges that it proposes to invest up to Rs 35 crore in the aggregate by way of equity in UWB, subject to such terms and conditions as may be imposed by the RBI. 

 IDFC added that this investment would be made by the company, along with HDFC and its subsidiaries/associates, Sicom and the Maharashtra government.

 HDFC also said it proposes to invest up to Rs 70 crore jointly with any one or more of its subsidiary/associate companies in the aggregate by way of equity in UWB. 

 While Sicom holds close to 10 per cent in UWB, bankers said the coming of HDFC and IDFC may strengthen UWBs reconstruction proposal before the central bank. 

 After UWB was put under moratorium by the RBI late last week, Sicom and the Maharashtra government indicated that they were willing to pump in capital to rescue UWB. 

 However, a major drawback was that since Sicom did not have banking experience, its proposal would not find favour with the RBI. 

 Farmers form the majority of customer base of UWB in the sugarcane growing areas of Maharashtra and this has forced the state government to step into the picture.

 This comes even as several leading banks have shown interest in acquiring UWB, attracted by its strong branch network of over 200. 

 They include ICICI Bank, Federal Bank, Andhra Bank, Allahabad Bank, Standard Chartered, IDBI, Canara Bank, Corporation Bank and Bank of Maharashtra. 

 Today, Uco Bank said its board has resolved to submit an expression of interest to the Reserve Bank of India for amalgamation of UWB with the bank.

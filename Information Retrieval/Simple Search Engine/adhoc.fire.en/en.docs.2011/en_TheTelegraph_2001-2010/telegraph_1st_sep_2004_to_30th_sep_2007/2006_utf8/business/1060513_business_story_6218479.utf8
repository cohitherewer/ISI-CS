 Cement under mortar fire

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 12: The government today set a three-day deadline for cement companies to build an action plan to check the tearaway rise in cement prices and threatened to clamp down with a ban on exports or a cess on their earnings if they failed to do so.

 Commerce minister Kamal Nath did some tough talking with cement manufacturers who had been called for a round of talks to check spiralling cement prices. 

 The increase in cement prices is unacceptable and the government cannot remain a silent spectator to a situation that impacts other sectors of the economy, Nath told them.

 He warned that the government would consider various options, including a ban on exports and imposing a cess, if the cement companies did not take steps to curtail the unjustified and unacceptable price rise.

 Representatives of the cement industry included the Cement Manufacturers Association, Gujarat Ambuja Cement Ltd, Associated Cement Company (ACC), Grasim Cement, Birla Cement Corporation, J.K. Lakshmi Cement, and J.P. Rewa Cement who together account for over 80 per cent of Indias cement output.

 He asked the cement companies to inform the government by Monday about the action they were planning to take to check the rising prices.

 Meanwhile, cement stocks led by ACC remained under pressure following the government directive to tone down its price act. ACC dropped Rs 68.45, or 7.1 per cent, to Rs 897.20; Gujarat Ambuja Cements by Rs8.60, or 7.5 per cent, at Rs 106; and Grasim by Rs 53.55, or 2.3 per cent, to Rs 2,250.80. The sensex, meanwhile, fell sharply by 150.30 points to end at 12285.11 points on persistent heavy selling by funds and operators.

 Nath dismissed arguments given by the Cement Manufacturers Association that the price rise was due to increase in costs of inputs such as coal, freight and power. He said prices should not have gone up by more than 7 to 8 per cent due to the rise in input costs.

 The minister had called the meeting after builders complained of abnormal rise in cement prices during the past five to six months. Prices have gone up 40 to 50 per cent since November 2005 in the country, particularly in northern and western regions.

 We certainly want the cement industry to grow and be a healthy industry, but limitless profiteering is just not acceptable. Our studies show that increase in input prices is not commensurate with the extent of the cement price increase. We want you to tell us by Monday, what you are proposing to do. If we do not hear from you within the next three days, the government will have to take whatever steps necessary to control the price rise and to explore all options, he said.

 The minister is reported to have pointed out that even after taking all input cost increases into account, the rise in the retail price of cement should have been about Rs 16 per bag only against the actual increase of Rs 41 per bag, which has taken place. While there has been an average increase of Rs 41 per bag since December 2005, the increase in Mumbai has been Rs 71, in Pune Rs 63, in Goa Rs 79, in Lucknow Rs 48 and Delhi Rs 45.

 Nath explained that todays meeting was in continuation of the earlier meeting held by secretary (IPP) with cement manufacturers on May 2 when the industry was urged to carefully look at the pricing mechanism and take effective steps to rationalise the prices.

 The cement industry reacted with dismay to Naths dire warning. The prices of cement in the last few months have actually come to a more realistic level. Just because the rise has happened within a few months time, it has caught the attention of the minister, said Sanjay Ladiwala, head of the Cement Dealers Association. 

 Cement prices were rising because of genuine mismatch in demand and supply. The crunch in supply is due to increase in cost pressures, sustained infrastructure development and high capacity utilisation, said a sector analyst justifying the increase in rates. 

 Exports constitute a negligible 4.3 per cent of the total output. Moreover, the price realisations from domestic sales are higher than that from exports. He said Naths view that a ban on exports would check spiralling prices was unfounded. Large cement makers like Grasim only exports 15 per cent of the total production. 

 Industry insiders said the average cost of development per square feet is Rs 500 to Rs 600 at the upper end and cement constitutes only 10 per cent of this cost. So the builders argument that cement price hike adds to their cost does not hold water. 

 The industry also feels that the onset of monsoon in a months time would have put a brake on rising cement prices as construction activity slows down during the rainy season.

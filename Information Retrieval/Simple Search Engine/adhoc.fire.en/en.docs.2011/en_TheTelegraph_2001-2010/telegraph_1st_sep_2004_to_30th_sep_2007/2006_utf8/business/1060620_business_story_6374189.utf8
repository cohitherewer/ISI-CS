 Calcutta, June 19: The Central Bank of India is planning to tap the market soon and has, therefore, sought the governments approval to restructure its capital base.

 We have a huge capital base of Rs 1,124 crore, a part of which we want to convert into preference shares qualifying for tier I capital. We have already sought approval for this capital restructuring proposal. However, the government is yet to give its nod, Central Bank chairperson-cum-managing director H.A. Daruwalla said on the sidelines of the third banking conclave organised by the Ficci Eastern Regional Council.

 After receiving the approval, the bank will take two to three months to float its maiden public issue, said Daruwalla.

 The bank wants to reduce its equity by converting a part of its present capital into preference shares so that its proposed public issue can fetch a premium. The smaller the equity size, the higher will be the book-value and earnings per share. This in turn will result in a higher premium.

 However, Daruwalla refused to divulge the number of shares to be offered to the public. We will decide on it only after getting the governments approval, she said.

 In 2005-06, total business of the bank was Rs 1,05,678 crore, including deposits and advances. 

 This fiscal, we are targeting a business of Rs 1,27,000 crore, Daruwalla said.

 Last fiscal, the bank clocked a 34 per cent growth in advances and a 9.4 per cent increase in deposits over the previous year. In 2006-07, it targets a credit growth rate of 30 per cent and a deposit growth between 20 per cent and 21 per cent.

 The banks capital adequacy ratio (CAR) came down to 11.10 per cent on March 31, 2006 from 12.15 per cent a year ago. According to Daruwalla, the banks CAR is likely to fall this year too, unless additional capital is provided for.

 The bank may need to provide for higher depreciation on investments in the face of rising interest rates and non-performing assets from its profits.

 Besides, it will also have to spend substantially on technology. As of date, only 50 of its 3,165 branches in the country are on the core banking platform. We have started to implement technology upgradation of late. Our first CBS branch was rolled out in June 2005. But it is imperative for every bank to invest in technology and it is burning a big hole in their capital, including ours, Daruwalla said.

 The bank will also require additional capital to comply with Basel II norms and growth in advances. 

 However, the Central Bank of India is focusing on increasing its fee-based income from selling mutual funds, life and non-life insurance products, credit card business and other financial services such as merchant banking.

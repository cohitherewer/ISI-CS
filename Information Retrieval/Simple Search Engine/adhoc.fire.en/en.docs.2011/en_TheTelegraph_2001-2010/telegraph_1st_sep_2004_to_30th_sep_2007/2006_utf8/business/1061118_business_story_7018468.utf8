 Whiff of Iran gas deal in air

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Nov. 17: Iran today softened its stand on the price of liquefied natural gas (LNG) for India, reviving the possibility of a deal that appeared to fall by the wayside when oil prices flared up in the international markets.

 However, the parties are likely to be involved in tough negotiations before settling the issue. 

 They have given us a new offer and now we will start working on that, petroleum minister Murli Deora said after a meeting with Irans foreign minister Manouchehr Mottaki. The meeting lasted for more than an hour.

 The deal ran aground when India rejected Irans demand of a higher price of $5.10 per mBtu (million British thermal unit) against the price of $2.90 agreed for annual supply of 5 million tonnes (mt) of LNG by Iran from 2009.

 The meeting between Deora and Mottaki today was held in an atmosphere of give and take where India agreed to pay slightly more after its initial offer, though higher than $2.90 but considerably less than $5.10, was rejected by Iran as being too low a price for the gas. Iran then proposed a new price.

 A little more price is ok but the new price should not be very high from what we had offered, Deora said, adding, With the new formula I am hopeful that the deal would fructify.

 Mottaki told reporters after the meeting that the countries complemented each other in gas business, with India needing gas for development and Iran keen to earn revenues from exports.

 I am optimistic that with further negotiations with a specific formula, you will receive gas very soon, he said.

 The Iranian minister yesterday said, We are going to offer a new price. If it is accepted, the project would be implemented. 

 India requires gas for its power plants and can afford to meet Irans terms since electricity tariff is regulated in India. The deal was almost clinched earlier, but the surge in global oil prices triggered a fresh demand from Iran to link the price of gas to oil.

 Mumbai, May 19: In a move to capture a major pie of the Rs 4,200-crore Indian networking market, Siemens Ltd today entered into a strategic alliance with Huawei-3 Com to offer networking solutions to Indian companies.

 ?Huawei-3Com, a joint venture between Chinese company Huawei and US-based 3Com, will provide us the IP network. We (Siemens) will use their infrastructure and our products to provide IP services to companies,? Peter Gartenberg, executive vice-president, Siemens Ltd, said here today. 

 Siemens Ltd, the Indian subsidiary of Siemens AG, will integrate the hardware and networking solutions offered by Huawei-3 Com.

 ?There is a huge demand for networks that can carry increasing data traffic and high quality voice and video-over-IP,? Gartenberg said.

 The alliance will offer IP-based voice data and video network solutions for Indian enterprises.

 IP telephony, which allows the user to transfer voice and data over the Internet cable, is allowed in the country over the computer. It means that the user can use the Internet connection on a computer to dial an international number. 

 However, due to restrictions imposed by regulators, the growth of IP telephony has been limited. 

 Also, the fact that international call rates have steadily dropped has taken the charm off IP telephony. However, call centres, BPOs and companies with huge international presence find it helpful. 

 Siemens plans to offer networking solutions to the entire market spectrum to meet specific requirements at a highly attractive total cost of ownership. 

 ?In India, there is a huge demand for networks that can carry increasing data traffic and high quality voice and video-over-IP. In order to serve this potential, Siemens has partnered with Huawei-3Com to provide solutions that are both technologically superior and high value in terms of total cost of ownership,? Gartenberg said. 

 Huawei-3 Com, a supplier of IP network solutions, has three offices in the country and is targeting to achieve $100 million revenues from India over the next four years, Huawei-3 Com managing director Eric Zhao said.

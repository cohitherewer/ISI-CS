 Q amp;A

 Investing is easy

 I want to invest in shares and mutual funds. But there are no investment agents in my area. How do I go about it?

 Swapan Kumar Mandal, Howrah

 ks and post offices now sell mutual fund products. To invest in shares, you need to open a demat account with your bank. Also ask the bank if it can suggest some brokerage house for share transaction. If you have an Internet connection, you can register with a brokerage house for online trading from home. 

 Pre-emptive measures

 I bought infrastructure bonds worth Rs 30,000 of REC in March 2005. At the rate of 6 per cent per annum, the total interest payable till March 2006 is Rs 1,800. The company has deducted TDS 10.20 per cent on Rs 1,800. Is this right?

 der section 193, no tax is deductible on annual interest income below Rs 2,500 from securities of companies notified in the proviso of the said section. But section 193 should be read with section 197A that allows an individual the benefit of non-deduction of tax at source on filing a declaration. For interest income on securities under section 193, the form is 15F. You should submit this form, filled in duplicate, with REC so that they dont deduct the tax from the current fiscal. 

 Cash rich

 I am over 65 years and my annual income is below Rs 1 lakh. I have sold my house for Rs 10 lakh and invested the amount in Senior Citizens Savings Scheme. How will this affect my income tax assessment? I have invested Rs 1 lakh in mutual funds also.

 The sale of your property entails a capital gains tax. However, one doesnt have to pay the tax if the proceeds are reinvested in another house within three years of the sale. But you have invested the money in the Senior Citizens Savings Scheme where it will be locked for 5 years. So, you will be liable to pay a capital gains tax on the property sale. Besides, your annual interest income on the investment works out to be Rs 90,000. If your annual income, including the interest income, exceeds Rs 1,85,000, you will have to pay an income tax at the rate of 20 per cent.

 Equity is heady but dangerous; you need debt funds in your portfolio to spread the risks, says Srikumar Bondyopadhyay

 Back in the spring of 1720, Sir 

 Issac Newton owned shares in the South Sea Company, the 

 hottest stock then on British bourses. Sensing that the 

 market was getting out of hand, Newton dumped his shares, 

 pocketing a profit of ?7,000. 

 A few months later, swept by the market enthusiasm, he jumped back in at a much higher price and lost ?20,000. For the rest of his life, the great physicist forbade anyone to utter ?South Sea? in his presence. ?I could calculate the motions of the heavenly bodies, but not the madness of the people,? he muttered. 

 But why in the first place should one invest in stock markets that forever swings like a pendulum from unsustainable optimism to unjustified pessimism?

 First, because, despite the inseparable risk, stocks give the best hedge to one?s fund from inflation corrosion. And, second, stocks give a much higher average return than other instruments to investors over the years.

 Newton, one of the most intelligent men on this earth, was not an intelligent investor. ?But, one can profit from the folly of stock markets rather than participate in it by following a disciplined investment policy,? wrote Warren Buffett in the preface of the classic text, The Intelligent Investor, by Benjamin Graham, the greatest investment adviser of the twentieth century. 

 In his book, first published in 1949, Graham described that investment intelligence is rather a trait of the character than of the brain ? it is about being patient and disciplined to keep impulses away from corroding the brain from following an investment policy strictly. 

 According to Graham, there is, however, no ?Simonpure? investment policy comprising representative shares. ?An investment option is one which, upon thorough analysis promises safety of principal and adequate returns. Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative,? he wrote.

 This is exactly what many of us are looking for ? safety of investment and freedom from the bother of tracking the stock tickers regularly.

 What the ?defensive investors? can do is to ?divide their holdings between high quality bonds and leading common stocks?; that the proportion held in bonds be never less than 25 per cent or more than 75 per cent, according to Graham. 

 However, in the absence of a matured bond and debt market here in India, investors can opt for fixed income or debt schemes of mutual funds. This will yield almost the same result. Further, professional fund managers of mutual funds do the searching for the best quality bonds. 

 Now, the simplest choice for bond and stock holding could be 50:50, with adjustments to restore the equality when the market developments had disturbed it by as much as, say 10 per cent. When the market level pushes up the value of the stock holding to say, 60 per cent, the balance could be restored by selling one sixth of the stock portfolio and transferring the proceeds to the bond/debt funds. Similarly, a fall in the value of the stock portion to 40 per cent would call for the use of one sixth of the bond fund to buy additional equities. 

 The interesting aspect of this approach is that you can set the holding targets, say at 30:70 between bond funds and stocks, depending on your risk bearing ability. By doing so, this approach also does away with the ?age? factor. The key is to rebalance the portfolio on a predictable and patient schedule ? not so often that it may drive you mad, and not so seldom that your targets get out of whack, say every six months.

 While a wide availability of debt/bond funds of mutual funds has made it easy to choose one from, the selection of stocks requires special attention. The rules for selecting the stock component, according to Graham, involves three rules:

 First, the company selected should be large, prominent and actively traded on the bourses. The highest dividend paying companies (with at least 5 years track record of dividend payment) in the BSE 30 share index or 100 share indices are ideal. 

 Second, there should be adequate though not excessive diversification. This could be a minimum of 10 stocks and a maximum of 30.

 Third, the investor should impose some limit on the price he will pay for in relation to the stock?s average earnings for, say the last 12 months. The price earnings ratio (P/E ratio indicates how much price other investors and speculators in the market are willing to pay for a given earnings per share) of the particular company vis-?-vis the industry average give a good guidance to set the limit.

 Stock purchases can be made through a ?monthly purchase plan? or the systematic investment plan (SIP). Under this, an investor devotes a fixed sum of money each month to buy one or more stocks. This application through the thick and thin of the market movements brings down the average rupee cost of stocks. 

 Since it is difficult for common investors to forecast market prices and movements and take action accordingly, they can benefit from buying stocks after each major decline in the market level and by selling out after each major advance. A systematic investment plan or a monthly investment plan works well in this approach.

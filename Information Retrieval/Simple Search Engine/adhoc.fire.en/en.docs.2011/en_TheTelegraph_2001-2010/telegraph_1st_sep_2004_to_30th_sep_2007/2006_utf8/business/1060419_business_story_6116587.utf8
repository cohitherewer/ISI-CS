 Goldman chief rings alarm bell

 London, April 18 (Reuters): Hank Paulson, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, has told the firm to think carefully about using its own money to finance hostile takeovers after a backlash against its role in a series of deals, a source close to the bank said on Tuesday.

 The Financial Times reported that Paulson told executives at the bank that such actions threatened its standing with corporate clients, which he said was more important than profits from any single deal.

 A source close to Goldman Sachs confirmed that Paulson had asked bankers in the firm to consider carefully its actions when it is putting its money behind unsolicited or hostile transactions.

 Goldman Sachs has always been skilled at handling conflicts between its role as an adviser on M amp;A activity for corporate clients and its own investment activities.

 But the Financial Times said Paulsons intervention suggested he was concerned at the level of criticism about the banks actions in the past few weeks.

 Paulsons move followed the disclosure that Goldman made an unsolicited approach to UK airports operator BAA, which is facing a hostile bid led by Spanish construction company Ferrovial.

 Goldman Sachs was also involved in a consortium that made an offer for Mitchells amp; Butlers, the UK pub chain operator, which then turned hostile.

 The bank also backed bids for UK television network ITV and Associated British Ports.

 Goldmans move highlights the increasing conflicts investment banks face in their roles as advisers and investors in M amp;A activity that frequently involves private equity firms.

 Some of the other big investment banks, including JP Morgan Chase and UBS, have scaled back in-house investment activities because of potential conflicts with private equity clients, which are big revenue earners for banks.

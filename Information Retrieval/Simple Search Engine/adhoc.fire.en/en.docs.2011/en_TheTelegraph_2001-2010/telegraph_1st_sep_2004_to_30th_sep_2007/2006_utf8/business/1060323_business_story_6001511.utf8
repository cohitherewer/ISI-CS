 Calcutta, March 22: General Motors (GM) is open to the idea of bringing Daewoo small car Matiz back to the Indian market.

 The production and sale of the car was discontinued in the country a few years back after the Korean chaebol got defunct.

 A consortium led by GM bought parts of Daewoo?s auto business, but the deal did not include the Indian assets. 

 At present, the company is selling the Matiz model in China, Korea and parts of Europe.

 The Matiz used to operate in the big-volume small car segment dominated by models from Maruti, Hyundai and Tata Motors.

 The small car segment contributes to over 50 per cent of the Indian passenger car market.

 ?We know it is a big market and the company has the choice to launch the car. We are open to this idea,? a GM official said.

 However, he clarified that the company was not looking at taking over Daewoo?s Indian assets at Surajpur.

 GM does not have a presence in the B segment at present. However, it plans to enter the premium end by launching the U-VA, a hatchback version.

 This model, to be launched next quarter, will compete with Hyundai?s Getz and Maruti?s Swift.

 This segment constitutes about 15 per cent of the country?s passenger car sales.

 During 2006, however, the company will focus on three Chevrolet launches it announced in January.

 ?We have set an internal target of selling 50,000 units this year. But this is a conservative estimate. We will do better than that,? Ankush Arora, vice-president (marketing, sales and after-sales) of General Motors India, said.

 In 2005, the company sold 30,837 cars compared with 26,166 in the previous year.

 GM India produces the Chevrolet Tavera (a MUV) and the Optra (entry-level premium car) at Halol near Vadodara in Gujarat.

 It has discontinued producing the Opel brands in India.

 Arora was in town to launch mid-size sedan Chevrolet Aveo. The model will be pitted against the Honda City and the Ford Fiesta. The company hopes to sell over 20,000 Aveos during this year.

 Oil stalwarts face penalty

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Sept. 18: The directorate-general of hydrocarbons (DGH) has recommended a penalty of $107.4 million on ONGC and $26.5 million on Reliance for failing in their oil exploration commitments.

 The recommendations are for the petroleum ministry, the final arbiter on the penalty.

 RIL has been asked to cough up $7.3 million for failing on a 3D seismic survey and to drill two exploratory wells in block KG-OSN-97/3. Another penalty is of $2.6 million for unfinished 2D and 3D seismic survey and one undrilled exploratory well in block KG-OSN-97/4.

 DGH has also proposed recovering $2.9 million from the private company for failing to drill one exploratory well in block GK-OSN-97/1 and two wells in block MB-OSN-97/3.

 ONGC was pulled up for playing truant in six blocks. The PSU faces a fine of $6.4 million for not drilling two exploratory wells in block MB-OSN-2000/1; $19.615 for wells on block MB-DWN-2000/1; and $22.807 million for two wells on MB-DWN-2000/2.

 The DGH also wants penalties of $6.450 million on the PSU for not drilling an exploratory well on block GS-DWN-2000/1, $28.293 million for two wells in block GS-DWN-2000/2 and $23.872 million for an unfinished well on block KK-DWN-2000/4. 

 DGH has informed the petroleum ministry that in some of the blocks, ONGC as a contractor did not agree to the conditions of extension and therefore, according to the order, the contractor has to pay money equivalent to the unfinished work programme.

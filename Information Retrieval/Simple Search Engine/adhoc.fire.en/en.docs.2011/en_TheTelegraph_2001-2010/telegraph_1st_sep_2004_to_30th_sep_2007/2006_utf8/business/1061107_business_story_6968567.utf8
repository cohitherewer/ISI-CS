 Merc sees new-look E-Class selling more

 CHANDRALEKHA TULAL

 Road rage

 Pune, Nov. 6: Daimler Chrysler India today introduced its new Mercedes Benz E-Class here five months after its global launch. The car will sport several features that had until now been stapled in the S-class sedan.

 The new generation E-Class features about 2,000 parts that are new or further developments from its predecessor, said Wilfried Aulbur, managing director and chief executive officer of Daimler Chrysler India.

 Available at a premium of Rs 1.25 lakh over the original E-Class, the new one will have a revamped front-end design. The bumper and radiator grille will feature a pronounced V-shape and has enhanced the familiar twin-headlamp by adding transparent louvres.

 Certain features of the S-Class such as adaptive braking and a pre-collision warning system that activates protection features for the driver and his co-passenger have been incorporated in the new E-Class. With a new four-spoke steering wheel, control unit for standard-fit thermatic automatic climate control, the designers have also redefined the coordinated colour schemes, upholstery and materials.

 Introduced in Spring 2002, the original E-Class had sold over one million units globally. In India, it was launched in 2003 and sold 667 units during the year. In 2005, it had sold 825 units.

 We have already sold 685 E-Class during the current year and we expect that with the new E-Class, it will be even better, said Aulbur.

 Priced at about Rs 41.94 lakh for the E 280 petrol and Rs 40.64 lakh for E 280CDI diesel, the new E-Class will come in two designs and equipment lines. The lines, called Classic and Elegance, will be distinguished by special design features. It will also offer the E200 Kompressor, which features a modified engine management system, a more dynamic supercharger and improved pistons that result in increased output by 12.5 per cent.

 Pune plant

 Increasing business confidence has prompted Daimler Chrysler to set up a new plant in Pune. Spread over 20 acres, the plant will have an annual production capacity in excess of 9,000 vehicles.

 We are at an advanced stage of finalising the land and expect it to be operational before the first half of 2007. We are looking at the three industrial belts of Pune, Chakan, Ranjangaon and Talegaon, said Suhas Kadlaskar, director (corporate affairs and finance), Daimler Chrysler India. The company has completed 10 years of operation in India.

 The current plant is on rented premises and now we want to have our own plant. It will enhance our long term plans for the country, Kadlaskar said. The plan has a capacity to produce 4,000 vehicles in one shift, which can be scaled up to 9,000 units in two shifts.

 Kadlaskar refused to say how much the company planned to invest. A project has to be over Rs 500 crore to be eligible for Maharashtra government incentives.

 Montek: Resolute 

 New Delhi, Aug. 29: The tussle between the finance ministry and the Planning Commission over more resources for plan projects has intensified, with deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia saying he was keen on getting more money for the Eleventh Five-Year Plan rather than practising austerity to meet fiscal deficit targets.

 We really do not care for FRBM (fiscal responsibility and budget management act) targets so long as we get the money (for the planned programmes), Ahluwalia said, responding to a letter from finance minister P. Chidambaram, who was not in favour of shifting goalposts of FRBM to provide more resources for the Eleventh Plan as suggested by the commission. Ahluwalias views were shared by human resources minister Arjun Singh, who seemed to favour more social sector spending even at the cost of fiscal discipline.

 Advocating that the next plan need not be constrained by the fiscal responsibility and budget management act, Singh wrote to the Planning Commission that indeed this act has put artificial curbs on the capacity of the economy to invest more in poverty alleviation programmes as well as in the much needed public investments in agriculture, which is the primary cause of the current agrarian distress.

 Under the FRBM act, the government has reduced fiscal deficit by 0.3 per cent and revenue by 0.5 per cent of GDP annually in a bid to wipe out revenue deficit and bring down fiscal deficit to 3 per cent of GDP by 2009.

 We are just bothered about the resources for the Eleventh Five-Year Plan, Ahluwalia said.

 On the other contentious issue of current account deficit, Ahluwalia said, We are recalibrating the entire thing. 

 The deficit depends on the impact of oil prices and domestic investment.

 The commission is of the view that the burgeoning current account deficit will hinder economic growth. The deficit as a percentage of GDP is likely to grow from 2 per cent to 2.8 per cent as the GDP itself grows 9 per cent from 7 per cent over the five-year period.

 The RBI too has opposed the commissions view to dilute restrictions imposed by the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act, 2004 on government spending and fiscal profligacy.

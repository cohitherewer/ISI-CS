 New Delhi, Feb. 14: India is poised to overtake Japan as the largest market for Suzuki Motor Corporation?s vehicles in the next one-and-a-half years.

 ?Our dealers in India tell us that they will be able to take over sales in Japan in the next 18 months. Let us see how it really goes,? said a senior official from Maruti Udyog Limited, the Indian joint venture of Suzuki Motor, after a meeting between the dealers and Osamu Suzuki, chairman and managing director of the Japanese parent company.

 In 2005, Suzuki Motor sold 7 lakh cars in Japan through 3500 outlets against 5.16 lakh in India through just 300 dealers.

 Suzuki Motor, however, clocked a sales growth of 8.9 per cent in India last year, while it was just 5 per cent in Japan.

 ?Annually, Japan does not clock more than 2-3 per cent growth. Last year was an exception because the Swift sold very well,? the official said.

 Suzuki said, ?We brought our Japanese dealers to India to show them the best practices adopted in this automobile market.?

 The chairman is accompanied by 2236 dealers from Japan, who have been flown to India by 12 charter flights to attend conventions here.

 In this trip, the dealers will visit Maruti?s facility in Gurgaon (near Delhi). They will also visit a few select Maruti dealerships to understand their processes and practices.

 ?This is an incentive trip for our Japanese dealers,? said Suzuki, who could not meet finance ministry officials due to time constraints.

 Suzuki Motor and Maruti Udyog have decided to invest about Rs 6,000 crore in India by 2008. This includes investment in a new car plant, a diesel engine facility and in making new models in the next five years.

 Suzuki Motor came to India in 1983 to manufacture small cars. The company has already sold in excess of five million cars in the Indian automobile market.

 Besides India, China is another big market for Suzuki Motor where it plans to become more aggressive, the official said.

 On whether the Indian subsidiary was working towards becoming the biggest market for Suzuki, Kinji Saito, director (marketing and sales), said, ?it is a matter of time before we catch up. This is one big challenge... A good challenging target for us.?

 Maruti termed the visit as ?yet another indication? of the importance Suzuki Motor attaches to the Indian market and its joint venture.

 Maruti is the biggest subsidiary for Suzuki outside Japan in terms of numbers and value. The Japanese auto company holds around 54 per cent stake in Maruti.

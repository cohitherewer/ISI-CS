 Aveo to be top bet in GM gamble

 GARIMA SINGH

 Dream Ride

 New Delhi, March 7: General Motors India is hoping to create a buzz around its marque with the Aveo ? a mid-size sedan ? which will have a sibling in the form of a premium hatchback called Aveo U-VA.

 GM has never really wowed the Indian auto enthusiast: the Astra was considered stodgy and old fashioned, the Corsa didn?t quite match the verve of the Fiat Palio, and the Tavera was just another ho-hum utility vehicle.

 A couple of years ago, GM India tried to capture some of the old magic by using one badge ? the Chevrolet ? for all its models. It seemed to work and soon the Optra turned into a small moneyspinner but wasn?t the best in its class. But it?s cheap and chic: better than the Maruti Baleno and the ageing Mitsubishi Lancer.

 But now GM India is taking its biggest gamble yet by getting into the tight scrum in mid-size cars ? one of the fastest growing segments and the most viciously competitive.

 ?The Aveo will give us the push in the Indian automobile market. This is the first time we are entering the volume segment. We want to be seen as a volume player in India. The launch will help us do just that,? said P. Balendran, vice-president (corporate affairs) at GM India.

 GM India is looking to pitch up its targets this year: it expects sales of around 50,000 units this year against 30,837 units in the last calendar year. ?The launch of the Aveo makes us very optimistic about sales this year,? he said.

 The Aveo will be available in two engine capacities ? 1.4 and 1.6 litre petrol variants. It will be launched in Mumbai later this month after which the car will be available at all GM showrooms. The sedan is expected to be priced at a nifty Rs 5.5 lakh.

 In the Indian automobile market, the Aveo will primarily compete with the Honda City, Ford Fiesta and Hyundai Accent. The Aveo U-VA will be pitted against Hyundai?s Getz and Maruti?s Swift and it will be interesting to see how it measures up.

 GM has fallen in with the rest of the crowd and decided to get two brand ambassadors for the Aveo: Bollywood icons Saif Ali Khan and Rani Mukherjee and hope that some of the chemistry they shared in blockbuster film Hum Tum will rub on the Aveo.

 ?We are looking for more visibility and hence we got brand amabssadors,? said Balendran.

 Meanwhile, an excise cut of 8 per cent for small car manufacturers has just proved to be a boon for carmakers like GM India which has been considering an entry in the small car market for a long time.

 ?We had been eagerly waiting for the Union budget. The launch of the Aveo, Aveo U-VA and finally the Spark ? an entry level hatchback ? which is expected to be unveiled later this year will really set the ball rolling for GM,? said company sources.

 The Aveo U-VA will probably fall short of the new definition of the small car that the finance minister announced in the budget: 1200 cc engine and length of not more than 4000 mm.

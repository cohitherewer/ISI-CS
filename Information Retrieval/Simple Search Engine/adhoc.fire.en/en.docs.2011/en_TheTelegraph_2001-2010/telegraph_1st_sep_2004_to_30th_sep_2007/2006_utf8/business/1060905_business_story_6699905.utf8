 Modern Foods to merge into Lever

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Sept. 4: Hindustan Lever Limited (HLL) plans to amalgamate Modern Foods Industries Limited (MFIL) with itself and the board will meet on September 8 to consider the issue. 

 According to a notice sent by the company to the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), the board will settle the draft scheme of amalgamation after considering all other related and incidental matters. 

 The company has not carried out any valuation exercise for Modern Foods, since the latter is a wholly owned subsidiary of the company. Also, no share exchange ratio needs to be fixed for the merger because of the same reason.

 The company plans to extinguish the shares of Modern Foods once the scheme is sanctioned. It is subject to the approval of the shareholders and the high courts of Delhi and Mumbai. 

 According to the notice, the board will also consider a proposal to demerge the companys assets at Jamnagar, Shamnagar and Daverashola plantations in Tamil Nadu into one or more subsidiaries. 

 HLL had acquired the bread manufacturing public sector unit Modern Foods for Rs 170 crore in the year 2000 and later infused an additional Rs 35 crore to upgrade the production units. 

 Rumours were rife since last year that HLL would divest Modern Foods when the company had admitted that the acquisition of MFIL was a case of improper due diligence and the companys inherent lack of capability in distributing fresh products. 

 The problems with Modern Foods really began in 2003 when the Uttar Pradesh government disqualified HLL as a potential bidder for supplying supplementary nutritional foods (SNF), a combination of wheat soy and milk to state run institutions. 

 As the state had been buying SNF from HLL for the past nine years, this move was totally unprecedented.

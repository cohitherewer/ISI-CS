 Vodafone in talks to sell Japan unit 

 Exit mode

 Tokyo/London, March 4 (Reuters): Vodafone Group Plc is in talks to sell a controlling stake in its struggling Japanese unit to Softbank Corp., giving the UK groups battered shares a lift on Friday and its embattled CEO Arun Sarin some respite.

 Sources said the deal would be valued significantly higher than 1 trillion yen ($8.6 billion) which the two companies had discussed over a year ago. The units book value is about 2 trillion yen.

 The third-ranked Vodafone KK business has been the symbol of much of the British-based groups woes and analysts said any decision to sell the operation would ease some of the pressure on Vodafone to exit the United States.

 Vodafone, the worlds largest mobile operator by sales, said on Friday the talks with the Internet communications conglomerate may or may not lead to a deal and a further announcement would be made in due course.

 The sources said the two firms were in the final stages of talks and a deal could be reached this month. Softbank declined to comment.

 Shares of Vodafone leapt 10 per cent on the news. The shares, which have underperformed the pan-European telecoms index by some 3 per cent this year, closed 8.5 per cent higher.

 Im surprised ... its happening so early (in the Japanese turnaround). It runs the risk that it wont get a decent value for it, but it may well be that Softbank have come to Vodafone, in which case maybe they can talk sensibly on price, said Williams De Broe analyst Darren Ward.

 Ward put a price tag of between 8 billion pounds ($14.0 billion) and 9 billion on the entire 97.7 percent stake.

 Future turnaround 

 Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein analyst Robert Grindle said Vodafone could also decide to sell only a majority stake to Softbank, retaining a small stake to benefit from a future turnaround of the business.

 I think its a hugely positive signal. This will relieve some of the pressure on them to get out of the US, said one Vodafone investor, who asked not to be identified.

 Some investors have called upon the group to sell its 45 per cent stake in Verizon Wireless, its joint venture in the United States with Verizon Communications, and return the cash to shareholders.Vodafone KK has been struggling to recover from a tumultuous few years in which sales of its 3G phones fell flat, its leadership changed twice within a year, and it suffered an industry-record monthly loss of customers.

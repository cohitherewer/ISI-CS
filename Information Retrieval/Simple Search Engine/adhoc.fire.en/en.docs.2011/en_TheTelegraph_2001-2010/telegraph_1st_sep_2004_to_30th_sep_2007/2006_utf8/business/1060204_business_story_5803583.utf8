 British Airways beats forecast

 London, Feb. 3 (Reuters): British Airways, Europes third-largest airline, said on Friday third-quarter operating profit rose 29 per cent, ahead of expectations, after strong passenger numbers helped offset rising fuel bills.

 The airline slightly raised its revenue forecast but warned costs would be higher than expected and reported lower average passenger fares in the quarter as it discounted seats to keep planes full.

 The results are slightly above consensus but on the other hand, there are some not too good things in it, BNP Paribas analyst Nick van den Brul said, pointing to falling yields and costs. Operating profit for the three months to end-December was ?175 million ($310.5 million), compared with ?136 million a year ago.

 Analysts had expected BA to post an operating profit of ?164 million, according to the average from a poll of eight analysts by Reuters. BA said pretax earnings were ?164 million against ?151 million a year ago. A recovery in first and business class, or premium, traffic and new international routes to India and Shanghai helped BA keep planes full, while ticket prices stabilised.

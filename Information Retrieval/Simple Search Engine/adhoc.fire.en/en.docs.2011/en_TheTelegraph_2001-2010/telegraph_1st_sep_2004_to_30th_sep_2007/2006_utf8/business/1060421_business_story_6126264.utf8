 Infy buys out Citi in Progeon

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, April 20: Infosys Technologies is buying out the entire holdings of Citicorp International Finance Corporation (Citi) in Progeon for $115.13 million, or Rs 518 crore, in cash.

 While Infosys will buy 23 per cent of Citis holding in Progeon, the transaction is expected to be completed by July this year.

 Progeon is a subsidiary of Infosys, in which it holds a majority stake. Its employee-strength was over 7,000 as on March 31, 2006 and provides BPO services to global companies. 

 Progeon is now ranked among the top 10, third-party BPOs in India according to Nasscoms rankings for 2004-05.

 The exit from Progeon would yield a huge return to Citi as it had invested $20 million in 2002 for obtaining this stake in the Infosys subsidiary.

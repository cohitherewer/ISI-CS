 Pill push to RILs growth strategy

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Booster dose

 Mumbai, Nov. 13: After petroleum and retailing, Mukesh Ambani-controlled Reliance Industries is turning to pharmaceuticals to provide the next booster dose to its business. Although details of the pharmaceutical foray are still sketchy at this stage, Ambani is likely to adopt a vertical model just as he has done in the other businesses.

 RIL will be present in both active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) or bulk drugs and formulations. While distribution can be taken care of by maintaining a sales force, he could harness a distribution strategy through Reliance Retail Ltd. The buzz is that Ambani is looking to acquire an over-the-counter (OTC) product.

 The subsidiary of RIL will also be involved in retailing drugs. At a later stage, it could start offering various products through a multiple format. Reliance Retail recently kicked off operations by offering food and grocery items through the friendly neighbourhood store format in Hyderabad.

 For Ambani, drugs will be one front in which RIL will be present over the coming years. Giving a detailed perspective of what the future holds, the RIL chairman told shareholders at the annual general meeting early this year that there were several sectors in India which are on the threshold of expansive growth.

 Notable among them are organised retailing, agriculture and food processing, infrastructure and special economic zones and life sciences and healthcare. All these sectors are ones that intensively consume products made by Reliance. Reliance will develop opportunities in agriculture and food processing that would support the organised retailing business. While Reliance is engaged with this effort, it would open up three broad fronts: forging new growth avenues in urban infrastructure and SEZs, founding new economy business in life sciences and healthcare, he had then said.

 Observers tracking the group say while RIL has kicked off activities in both retail and SEZs; pharmaceuticals, agriculture and food processing will be the next target areas.

 As the pharmaceutical venture is believed to be in a preliminary stage, industry observers expect Ambani to pump anywhere between $500 million and $1 billion. However, while responding to reports that Reliance may begin its foray through the inorganic route, officials from the company said there were no concrete developments at this stage.

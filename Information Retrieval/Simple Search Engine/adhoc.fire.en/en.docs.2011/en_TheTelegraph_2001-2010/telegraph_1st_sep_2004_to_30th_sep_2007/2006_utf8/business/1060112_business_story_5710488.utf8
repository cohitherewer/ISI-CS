 Marginal rise in Exide net

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Ganguly: Hopes for the best

 Calcutta, Jan. 11: Exide Industries Ltd, Indias largest lead-acid storage battery maker, reported a gross turnover of Rs 431.9 crore and an operating profit of Rs 53.31 crore for the quarter ended December 2005.

 It represents a 17.2 per cent increase in gross turnover and 38 per cent jump in operating profit compared with the corresponding period of the last financial year. 

 However, the companys before-tax profit grew by only 6 per cent during the quarter, while net profit grew by only 3 per cent.

 Profit was depressed due to depreciation of Indian rupee vis-?-vis US dollar. 

 The rupee depreciation resulted in a foreign exchange loss of Rs 3.7 crore for Exide during the three months. 

 However, earnings per share has remained the same as in the previous year despite an increase in the capital base following a preferential issue made late last year. 

 During the nine months of this fiscal, Exides gross turnover and net profit rose 17.0 per cent and 26.7 per cent respectively to Rs 1274.9 crore and Rs 74.8 crore. 

 The EPS for the April-December period stands higher at Rs 10 than Rs 8.3 in the year-ago period. 

 The rising cost of lead, the prime raw material for the company, in the international markets remains a cause of concern. However, our continued focus on quality, technology and cost control across levels has paid rich dividends in terms of better profitability. The robust growth in the automotive and infrastructure segments hold business promises, companys executive chairman and chief executive officer, S. B. Ganguly, said.

 During the period, Exides replacement battery business in the automotive segment grew by close to 20 per cent. 

 The LCV segment of the original equipment business showed the most promising growth. 

 During the September-December quarter Exide announced major brand initiatives through signing up cricket sensation M. S. Dhoni as the companys brand ambassador. 

 The industrial battery business of the company continued to show good growth. 

 So far this fiscal, it showed a growth of close to 22 per cent. Among the categories where it operates, the telecom sector showed the most promising growth prospects. The demand for UPS and inverter batteries was also healthy. 

 In automotive batteries, the company controls a market share of over 80 per cent in the OE business and above 75 per cent in the branded replacement market. In industrial batteries market, the company controls more than 50 per cent.

 IT solutions provider, CMC Ltd, today reported a 15.94 per cent rise in net profit at Rs 10.76 crore for the quarter ended December 31, 2005 compared with Rs 9.28 crore for the quarter ended December 31, 2004.

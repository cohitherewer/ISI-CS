 Motilal Oswal lines up IPO plans

 SRIKUMAR BONDYOPADHYAY

 Calcutta, Feb. 18: Mumbai-based Motilal Oswal Securities will tap the capital market with an initial public offering (IPO) early next year to fund its expansion.

 We are planning an IPO during the early months next year, said Raamdeo Agarwal, managing director of Motilal Oswal Securities. The IPO will be for 25 per cent post-issue equity of the company, he said.

 Meanwhile, the brokerage firm is also scouting for a private equity investor, who can bring in capital to fund its growth. 

 According to Agarwal, the brokerage firm has already started negotiations with a few private equity partners, including the New Jersey-based New Vernon Capital, a hedge fund promoted by the former Merrill Lynch vice-president, Arshad Zakaria.

 Motilal Oswal Securities plans to sell the private equity partner a 10-15 per cent stake in the company and rake in Rs 150-200 crore in the process. The proceeds will be used to fund acquisitions, expansions, buildings and offices, said Agarwal.

 The company has recently acquired an Andhra Pradesh-based brokerage firm, Gayatri Capital. We are now looking for a suitable acquisition in the northern region, Agarwal added. 

 The company has embarked on a branch expansion drive, particularly in the northern and eastern regions where it has a scant presence. At present, Motilal Oswal Securities has 650 outlets, most of which are concentrated in the southern and western regions. 

 The brokerage firm aims to increase its number of branches as well as franchisee outlets to 1000 by the turn of the calendar 2006.

 Reliance goes downhill on downgrade

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Nov. 15: Reliance Industries has been clobbered with a second downgrade by a brokerage this time by Motilal Oswal, which winched down the stock to neutral from buy as concerns started to mount about the lack of information about the Indian conglomerates new ventures.

 On November 6, the Reliance stock was downgraded to underperform from inline by Kotak Institutional Equities Research.

 We have cut our earnings estimates due to weaker refining margin expectations. At the current price, the stock trades higher than our revised estimate of their total business, said the Motilal Oswal report.

 It has outperformed the sensex by a significant 50 per cent over the last 12 months. We believe that expectations on the value of new businesses and/or reserve size of new discoveries have run up well ahead of time as well as available information, the report said.

 Based on RILs total business valuation, Motilal Oswal had cut the value of the share from Rs 1,180 per share to Rs 1,111 per share. 

 However, the potential upsides from coal-bed methane could add another Rs 147 per share, taking it to Rs 1,258, which is still lower than the current market price.

 We are unable to justify Reliances current rich valuations on weakening fundamentals and publicly available information. We see a large gap between Reliances stock price and the fair valuation of its extant businesses, said the Kotak report.

 Kotak also has several unresolved issues with Reliances financials, accounting and disclosures. It has assigned a 12-month target price of Rs 1,100 for the scrip.

 Reliance shares fell Rs 15.75, or 1.2 per cent, to Rs 1,262.05 at close on the Bombay Stock Exchange today. The stock had hit its lifetime high of Rs 1,315.90 on November 6 and closed at Rs 1,306.05.

 Several other brokerages have also started to take a hard look at Reliances valuations, which have run up sharply this year.

 ABN Amro and Citibank are also understood to be neutral on the stock while I-Sec, CLSA and JM Morgan Stanley had upgraded RIL over the past couple of weeks.

 According to analysts, while most brokerage houses are of the same view over the refining and petrochemical margins, the differences of opinion stems from values assigned to the companys E amp;P blocks and the retail business.

 PNB raises deposit rates

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 5: Punjab National Bank today raised its deposit rate by 25-75 basis points across different maturities. It is one of the few public sector banks which had been advised by the finance ministry to hold back any lending rate hike unless its board approves a PLR increase. 

 The new rates will come into effect from August 7, the bank said in a press release today. The public sector bank had increased its deposit rates in July this year. So, this is the second time the bank has raised deposit rates in this quarter. From next week, fixed deposits of less than one year will attract an interest rate of 6.25 per cent, while the interest rate on deposits for five years and above will be 7.50 per cent. 

 PNB officials said the decision on the deposit rate hike had nothing to do with the finance ministrys letter to the bank, but one cannot help taking the argument with a pinch of salt as it had increased the deposit rate by the same percentage points only a month ago. The bank chairman could not be reached for a comment.

 However, the second leg of deposit rate hike by PNB is for those deposits with a maturity of over six months. For deposits maturing between 7 and 180 days, the interest rates have not been increased.

 PNB had raised its benchmark prime lending rate (PLR) by 0.25 percentage points this week, following the increase in repo and reverse repo rates by the Reserve Bank of India on July 25. 

 Other public sector banks, including State Bank of India, have also raised their PLRs and other lending rates. This drew the finance ministrys attention, which has asked the banks to take a prior approval of their respective boards for a PLR hike.

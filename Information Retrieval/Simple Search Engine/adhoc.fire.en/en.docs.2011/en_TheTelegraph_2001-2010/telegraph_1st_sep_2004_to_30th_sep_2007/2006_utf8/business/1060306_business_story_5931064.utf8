 Drought in Kenya puts tea prices on fire

 SOHINI MOOKHERJEA

 Calcutta, March 5: Kenya has suffered a 47 per cent drop in tea production in January. This can lead to a massive price correction in Indian tea like it did after the Kenyan droughts of 1997 and 2000. 

 The Indian tea prices had shot up during these periods. The north Indian tea prices peaked in 1998 at Rs 80.22 per kg.

 In 1997 and 2000, Kenyan tea production dropped by 14 per cent and 15 per cent respectively, according to the Tea Board of Kenya.

 In 1997, the average auction closing price for north and south Indian tea combined was Rs 66.87 per kg, which rose to Rs 72.80 in 1999, according to figures compiled by J Thomas and the Indian Tea Association. In 1998, the prices rose to Rs 76.43.

 In the last four years, tea prices have been steadily declining in India. 

 The average auction closing price for north and south Indian tea combined for 2005 was between Rs 58 and Rs 59 per kg.

 The global shortfall due to the Kenyan crisis increased Mombasa auction price for the last week at $2.46 per kg (around Rs 111.25 per kg) while the rates in Jakarta markets increased by around 20 to 40 cents, depending on the type of tea, added industry experts.

 The south Indian markets have dipped slightly as was revealed by the Cochin auctions. But industry experts attribute it to the sharp price escalation and a temporary correction, which would be stabilised by re-negotiating with buyers. 

 The Kenyan production declined from 34.1 million kg in January 2005 to 17.9 million kg in January 2006.

 The tea production in Kenya is expected to drop by 16 per cent in 2006 at 276 million kg from 328 million kg in 2005.

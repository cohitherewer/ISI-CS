 Rider set for tax break on bank deposits 

 OUR BUREAU

 March 20: The tax break on bank fixed deposits has been circumscribed.

 Finance minister P. Chidambaram had said in the budget that fixed deposits with banks with a tenure of five years or more would qualify for the tax benefit under section 80C.

 Today, however, the government decided that the tax benefit would be extended to only those term deposits with banks that have been issued in accordance with a scheme framed and notified by the central government.

 Section 80C allows taxpayers to claim a deduction of up to Rs 1 lakh from their taxable income for the investments they make in the public provident fund, national savings certificates, life insurance policies, equity-linked savings schemes and specified bonds. Other payments like home loan repayments, investments in pension funds and school and college tuition fees also qualify. 

 The sudden qualification meant that there would now be two classes of bank deposits: one eligible for the tax break and the other that would not. 

 The (original) proposal was open-ended and, therefore, difficult to implement, the government said in a late evening statement issued after the Lok Sabha passed the Finance Bill 2006.

 The chairmen of public sector banks that The Telegraph spoke to said the amendment indicated that not all term deposits above five years would be eligible for deduction under section 80C. However, they would wait for the final notification from the finance ministry before coming out with a structured product.

 We will have to wait for a clarification from the government to find out which deposits can qualify for tax relief, said K. Cherian Varghese, CMD of Union Bank of India.

 We are yet to come out with a structured product. Once the government issues a notification, it is likely that banks will attract substantial deposits, Dena Bank chairman M.V. Nair said.

 Some bankers were not sure whether the scheme referred to any significant modification in terms of the rate of interest, maximum investment limit or a lock-in period for bank fixed deposits (five years and above) to be eligible for section 80C benefits. They expect the issue to come up for discussion on Thursday when bank chairmen meet the finance minister in Delhi.

 We are not clear about what sort of scheme the government intends to notify. We will meet the finance minister on Thursday. Only then will we know about the new guidelines. Before that I cant say anything, said .N. Singh, chairman-cum-managing director of Allahabad Bank.

 Certainly we will have new fixed deposits, but as of now we dont know anything about the guidelines, said R. Dhawan, general manager of Punjab National Bank.

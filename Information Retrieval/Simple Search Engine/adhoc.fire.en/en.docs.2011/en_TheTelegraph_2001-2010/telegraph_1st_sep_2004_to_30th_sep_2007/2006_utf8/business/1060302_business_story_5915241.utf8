 Dull budget a testimony to reform pace

 Winds of change

 New Delhi, March 1: The days of big-bang budgets are over.

 North Block, the red sandstone edifice housing the offices of the finance ministry, may cease to be the nerve centre of economic change ? a trait with which it was associated through the 1990s.

 ?Economic reforms have been taken off the budget and that?s how things should be,? argues Pranab Sen, noted economist and principal adviser to the government. ?The right place for announcing non-fiscal reforms should be Parliament or the ramparts of the Red Fort, possibly by the Prime Minister.? 

 With no announcements on FDI, labour laws and privatisation and most major direct tax reforms already a thing of the past, policy makers feel budgets in the future will be more ?prosaic statements sticking to fiscal matter?.

 ?That?s a change for the better ... we had cases of a finance minister unilaterally announcing labour reforms, which the labour minister later said had never been bounced off him. The new trend is welcome,? said Sen. 

 Budgets became major talking points in the 1990s when the then finance minister Manmohan Singh brought in bold and striking reforms. He slashed red tape, simplified the tax system and removed stifling controls and regulations over industry, opening it up to private enterprise and foreign capital. 

 The changes were catalytic. Private sector companies tried to get into every line of business that the earlier licence regime did not allow them. There was a sheaf of new investments in brick-and-mortar sectors as well as in sunrise ones like telecom, aviation and infotech.

 All this catapulted the country from a lowly GDP rate of 3.5 per cent to a sudden growth burst averaging 6-7 per cent through the decade. 

 Naturally, the Union budget became something to watch out for. This was true not only for Indians but also foreigners keen to invest in a rapidly expanding market giving high rates of returns. 

 But with most major tax reforms a thing of the past and other reforms out of budget purview, times have changed. ?You will see most of the major reforms will now come as mid-term corrections after the state Assembly elections are over,? predicts S.P. Gupta, former member of the Planning Commission.

 Government officials agree that most of the reforms in direct taxes have already been carried out. ?Whats left is really tinkering with surcharges and removing exemptions and bringing in exempt, exempt tax (EET) in full measure,? points out a member of the Central Board of Direct Taxes. 

 EET will see all current tax-free savings being eventually taxed when withdrawn. However, the government will allow grandfathering of old investments, which means that investments made before EET is notified will not be taxed, even when withdrawn later. 

 However, indirect taxes or taxes on industrial produce, also called excise duties, and on imports, termed customs duties, are areas where more reforms are expected.

 Q amp;A

 Gains goal

 Is capital gains on sale of equity shares of Indian companies 12 months after their acquisition exempt from tax? The shares were transacted in 2005-06 through a Sebi-recognised stock exchange

 Parimal K. De, Calcutta

 Capital gains on sale of equity shares of companies 12 months after their purchase is exempt from tax under the income tax act. The point should be underlined that the shares must be held for 12 months or more.

 Investment tips

 I want to invest in redeemable preference shares of Calcutta-based Amrit Project Ltd and Chandigarh-based Alchemist Ltd. Both the companies issue shares through private placement. How secured such investments will be?

 Ashim K. Mallick, Guwahati

 First check out whether these companies are listed and traded on any stock exchange of the country or not. Investments in preference shares of unlisted companies is riskier than in listed companies. You can also check out the credit ratings of the companies to ascertain how good or bad your investments may turn out to be. However, investments in shares are never secured.

 Tedious TDS 

 I am employed in a PSU and an income tax assessee. I am a member of a voluntary fund promoted by my employer and I get an interest of about Rs 4,000 per annum from the fund. Till assessment year 2005-06, I added the interest to my annual income and paid the income tax thereon. If the fund deducts the tax at source on the accumulated interest during the final withdrawal by me, how shall I get back the TDS? What proof shall I be required to produce before the income tax authorities to claim the refund?

 A.K. Mukherjee, Calcutta

 Till the time you finally withdraw your investment from the fund and a tax is deducted at source thereon, keep the copies of income tax returns and Form 16 you have filed within the intermediate period. You can submit these copies to your employer so that they wont deduct tax at source during final withdrawal. In case, if they still deduct it, you can claim the TDS by producing these support documents.

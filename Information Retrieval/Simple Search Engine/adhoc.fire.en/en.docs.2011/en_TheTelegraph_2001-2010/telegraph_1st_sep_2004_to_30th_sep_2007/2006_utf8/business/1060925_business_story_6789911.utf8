The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 East to get a taste of Spinach

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Sept. 24: The Wadhwan family, whose retail foray under the brand name Spinach has already made its presence felt in Mumbai, is heading for the East. 

 Our next phase of expansion will be in the eastern regions of the country, starting with Calcutta next year, said Dippankar Haldar, CEO of Spinach. 

 But why the East? 

 The East is a big sourcing hub for us. Moreover, acquiring land in this region is still much easier than in the North. After the East, we will look at the North. The focus will not be on Delhi but the NCR region, Haldar said. 

 When asked how many stores they planned to open in Calcutta, he said, We aim to open 80 in two years time. 

 All the stores will come up in residential areas, as it has been in Mumbai. The company, whose business interest includes real estate and housing finance, has plans to sink in around Rs 1,500 crore over the next few years in its retail foray. 

 A part of the Wadhwan Food Retail Pvt Ltd, Spinach plans to have about 50 stores in Mumbai by the end of March 2007. 

 Promoted as the neighbourhood food and grocery store, Spinach stores are expected to cater to the daily needs of retail customers. 

 The stores will be in three formats Spinach Local, at approximately 2,500 sq ft, Spinach Super at 5,000-7,000 sq ft and Spinach Express, which will be large format stores. 

 Talking about the store mix in Calcutta, Haldar said the format of the stores would differ depending on the areas they are opened. 

 The company plans to hire around 2,000 people for their Calcutta outlets. 

 It eventually plans to roll out 1,500 stores in 93 cities by 2011. After Mumbai, Pune is the next probable destination in Maharashtra. 

 The company plans to have its own private labels as well as well-known brands. 

 We have a centralised bakery that supplies to the stores. We plan to source a few private labels too, Haldar added.

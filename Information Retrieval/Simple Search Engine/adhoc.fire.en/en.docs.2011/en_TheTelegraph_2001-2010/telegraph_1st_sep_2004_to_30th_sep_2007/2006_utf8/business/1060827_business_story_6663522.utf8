 US economy under strain 

 Above the world?

 Jackson Hole, Wyoming, Aug. 26 (Reuters): The US economy is facing uncertainties, both on the degree to which price pressures are contained and how much the economy might slow, IMF chief economist Raghuram Rajan said on Friday.

 I think this is a time of a fair amount of uncertainty, because certainly there seems to be a shifting in the United States, he said on the sidelines of a conference here. Were not quite sure if inflationary pressures are contained ... and we are also not sure how far and how quickly housing will slow.

 Given these uncertainties, I think its just natural at this point for everybody to be waiting and looking to see what the data bring, and it seems to me that is also what the (Federal Reserve) is doing, Rajan said.

 He said he would not disagree with forecasts of the US economic growth slowing toward a rate not far from its long-term trend, or as he put it: reasonably strong growth.

 But he said there were substantial risks on the downside, mentioning both the slowing housing market and lofty oil prices.

 He declined to offer a preview of how the International Monetary Fund might change its global growth forecasts when updated projections are released next month. However, he said strong productivity growth outside the United States offered hope the world economy would survive a slowdown in US demand and remain strong. 

 China rising

 Chinas economy could be the worlds largest within 25 years, although it wont be able to keep up its current break-neck pace forever, Bank of Israel governor Stanley Fischer said on Friday.

 Fischer, once the IMFs No 2 official, said growth was likely to ease when Beijing took the necessary step of letting its yuan currency rise.

 If the Chinese economy were to continue to grow in real terms at a rate 7 per cent greater than that of the United States economy at a constant exchange rate as it has for over 20 years its GDP would indeed overtake that of the United States in about another quarter of a century, he told central bankers and top academics from around the globe.

 Further, the yuan is likely to appreciate over that period relative to the dollar ... reducing the length of the catch-up period, Fischer added.

 He said Beijing could ill afford to let the economy continue to run at a hot 10 per cent growth rate indefinitely.

 At some point, perhaps because of inflationary pressures and the costs of the continuing reserve buildup, the process of exchange rate appreciation that other countries in the region, including Japan, Korea and others have experienced, will have to begin, he said.

 However, Fischer said that even when that happens, the yuan is likely to rise in value at a rate that allows China to continue to run a sizeable current account trade surplus.

 US businesses have said an undervalued yuan gives Chinese producers an unfair advantage on world markets. Washington has pressed Beijing to allow for more flexibility in its currency as one way to help ease global trade imbalances.

 Fischer expressed hope that a disruptive unwinding of imbalances and narrowing of the large US trade gap could be avoided.

 It is easy to describe crisis scenarios, particularly with regard to the unwinding of the US current account deficit and many delight from doing so, he said. But overall it seems that the international economy and its market and governmental organisations have sufficient flexibility, and perhaps even the wisdom, needed to deal with the required adjustments.

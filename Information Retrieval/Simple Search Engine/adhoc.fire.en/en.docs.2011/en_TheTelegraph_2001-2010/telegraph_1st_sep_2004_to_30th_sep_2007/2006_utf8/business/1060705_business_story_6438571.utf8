 New Delhi, July 4: Honda Motor is planning to consolidate its India businesses under a single company ? Honda Motor India Pvt Ltd.

 ?Although this company will initially take care of logistics for automobile spare parts, we are looking at the possibility of transferring the shareholdings of Honda Japan in different ventures in India to the new company,? said M. Takedagawa, head, Southwest Asia, Honda Motor.

 Honda had entered India in 1984 and its businesses include two-wheelers, cars and power products.

 Honda operates through four companies in India ? fully owned two-wheeler subsidiary Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India, joint venture two-wheeler firm Hero Honda, car company Honda Siel Cars India Ltd and Honda Siel Power Products.

 In Hero Honda, the publicly listed joint venture with the Munjals, Honda holds a 26 per cent stake. 

 The company has Shrirams as the partner for car and power products businesses. The Indian partner currently holds a 0.1 per cent stake in Honda Siel Cars India Ltd and 1 per cent in Honda Siel Power Products.

 Honda today rolled out the popular Civic with a 1.8-litre petrol engine. The sedan will be available in automatic and manual variants. The manual variant will sport a price tag of Rs 10.75 lakh and the automatic Rs 11.45 lakh. 

 Civic boasts of fuel efficiency, slightly lower than its 1.5-litre City model but it can deliver power equivalent to that of a 2-litre car.

 The Civic will compete with the Toyota Corolla, the Skoda Octavia and the Hyundai Elantra. 

 It will be manufactured at Honda?s Greater Noida facility and have 68 per cent localisation, which will be scaled up to 80 per cent within the next two years, the company said.

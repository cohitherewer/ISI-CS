 Business Briefs

 New Delhi, Oct. 13: The rate of inflation rose to a 15-week high of 5.16 per cent for the week ended September 30, but finance minister P. Chidambaram said there was no pressure on interest rates as prices would ease after fresh arrival of essential food items such as sugar and wheat. When asked whether higher inflation would put pressure on interest rates, he said, No, it would not, as there is ample liquidity in the system.

 Deficit cut must for full float

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 15: Former RBI deputy governor S.S. Tarapore, who is the author of the report on full float of rupee, today said removal of revenue deficit, coupled with strong macroeconomic fundamentals, were pre-requisites to move towards capital account convertibility.

 Capital account convertibility should be gradual and cautious, he said at a Ficci seminar, thereby silencing his critics who were advocating an extremist approach toward full float of rupee.

 Calibrated sequencing and timing of measures along with progress could maximise growth, employment and social well being, he added.

 Those not wanting any progress on fuller capital account convertibility must realise that an independent economy is not a serious option. If we, in India, do not undertake a well calibrated move to full convertibility, the forces of globalisation would set a pace which would be out of our control we will become less competitive and not attain the optimum efficiency, said Tarapore.

 GM India keen on Opel return

 New Delhi, Dec. 25 (PTI): General Motors India is considering bringing back its Opel brand in the niche segment of the domestic market, months after it slammed brakes on local manufacturing of products of the marque early this year. 

 The plan to re-launch the brand in India comes in the wake of a possible revival of fortunes of German technology here with the entry of BMW and Volkswagen.

 There is a possibility of re-introducing the Opel badge in the niche segment, a company source said.

 GM, which had shifted its focus to the Chevrolet brand after the global acquisition of erstwhile Daewoo, has found the latters technology not only cost-efficient but also more suitable to the Indian market.

 If and when the company brings back any Opel badge, it would definitely not be in the lower end of the market, the source added. 

 Earlier this year, General Motors India had announced stopping the local production of mid-sized sedan Corsa, the last of the Opel badge to be produced in India. General Motors India had struggled for nearly a decade to make a cut in the Indian market with the Astra, Corsa, Sail and Vectra from the Opel stable.

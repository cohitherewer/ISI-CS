 Nigerian oil block for ONGC Mittal

 New Delhi, Oct. 6: ONGC Mittal Energy Ltd, the joint venture company floated by ONGC and Mittal Steel, has bagged another oil block in Nigeria.

 The company put in the highest bid of $100 million for Nigerias OPL-246 after South Atlantic Petroleums (Sapetro) licence for the block was revoked, a senior official said. 

 The joint venture outbid INC Natural Resources and BG-Sahara at an auction held on October 4 shortly after Sapetro lost a legal challenge against a government decision to revoke the companys licence.

 OPL 246 is the relinquished area of the billion-barrel Akpo oilfield of Sapetro which is part-owned by Theophilus Danjuma, former defence minister who fell out with President Olusegun Obasanjo after opposing a campaign to extend Obasanjos term in office. 

 In January this year, ONGC had lost out on acquiring Sapetros 45 per cent stake in Akpo to Chinas CNOOC as the Indian government did not allow it to proceed with the deal due to geopolitical reasons at the time.

 ONGC Mittal has to pay 25 per cent of the $100-million signature bonus committed for OPL 246 this week, failing which it would lose the block to INC, which was designated as the reserved bidder.

 An ONGC official said the company was studying the prospects and will shortly take a decision on the issue. It may take an extension on payment of the signature bonus.

 In Nigeria, ONGC Mittal had recently secured licence for OPL 209 near ExxonMobils Erha project and OPL 285, where Statoil earlier struck hydrocarbons.

 ONGC, however, pulled out of two Nigerian deep-water blocks 323 and 321 following differences with majority stakeholder Korean National Oil Company (KNOC).

 Sources said under the Nigerian rules, oil firms have to relinquish half of their exploration licences when they make a discovery. The smaller discovery area is converted into a production licence, freeing up unused acreage for others to do more exploration.

 But South Atlantic had asked a federal high court to review the governments decision to revoke the remnant of OPL 246 after the giant Akpo oilfield was discovered.

 The Akpo field, about 200 km off the Nigerian coast and operated by French energy giant Total, is expected to produce 225,000 barrels of oil a day when it comes on stream in the second half of 2008.

 However, the government insisted Sapetro must relinquish the entire block, which was originally set to run through 2008.

 Cold weather adds warmth to CTC rates

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Dec. 17: Due to the cold weather, production in most of the tea growing regions of Northeast will end a fortnight earlier than planned. 

 With the coming of winter, coupled with the tailing off of production, markets for good categories are expected to remain strong.

 This has resulted in improved demand for all CTCs in the three auction centres of Calcutta, Guwahati and Siliguri. 

 Good quality tea appreciated in value, while medium varieties sold at firm rates. The plain and fibrous sorts sold at levels comparable to the previous week. 

 Demand was strong from all sections of the domestic market. Due to the anticipated early closure in production, this trend is expected to continue for the remaining sales of the season.

 The average price at Indian auctions, between January and September 2006, according to the Tea Board, was higher by 14.37 per cent compared with the same period in 2005. 

 The price for north Indian and south Indian varieties were higher by 14 per cent and 18.29 per cent respectively. 

 Darjeeling tea met with good demand and those with seasonal character witnessed a rise in prices. The remainder sold at firm rates compared with the previous week. 

 The demand in the north Indian tea market starting December 11, 2006, was largely forthcoming from major domestic packeteers and local Bengal buyers. 

 Orthodox tea met with good demand, with clean, well made whole leaf grades selling at firm rates. The remainder were absorbed at limits similar to the previous week following quality enquiry. 

 The important players this week continued to be buyers from West Asia and the CIS.

 Plainer sorts are likely to witness an improved demand, as buyers would need to hold sufficient stocks till April 2007. 

 According to the Indian Tea Association (ITA) status report on tea, the year will end with a shortfall of 27 million kg. As a result, the year 2007 will start on a finer note with lower crop in the pipeline. 

 The report observes that to meet the shortfall and the burgeoning domestic demand, the industry would have to produce quality tea at a reduced cost, increase productivity and manufacture more orthodox variety.

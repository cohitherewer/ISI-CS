 Paradip Phosphates turns around

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, July 20: Four years after the Centre privatised Paradip Phosphates, the fertiliser firm has turned around and posted a net profit of Rs 12.7 crore in 2005-06 ? its first in the last decade. This was possible because of an overall growth in production and sales, managing director S.S. Nandurdikar said.

 The total sales during the year amounted to Rs 1,971.3 crore against Rs 1,595 crore during 2004-05, registering an increase of 23.6 per cent.

 Paradip Phosphates produced 12.58 lakh tonnes of DAP and complex fertilisers during 2005-06 against 10.21 lakh tonnes in the previous year, registering an increase of 23 per cent. Sulphuric acid production was 7.35 lakh tonnes against 6.39 lakh tonnes in the year ago, an increase of 15 per cent. Nandurdikar said the improvements and debottlenecking were financed by internal accruals. The plant was divested to Zuari Maroc Phosphates Pvt Ltd for Rs 151.7 crore on February 18, 2002.

 Mumbai, June 12: Berger International Ltd, the overseas arm of Asian Paints Ltd, has divested its stake in Dutch Boy, a company based in The Philippines, for Rs 6.74 crore. The move is part of the company?s efforts to cut exposures in loss-making units.

 Berger International has entered into a conditional stock purchase agreement with Wilson V. Ko to sell 427,000 shares in Dutch Boy Philippines Inc, representing a 30 per cent stake, the company has informed the Singapore Stock Exchange.

 The deal would be completed six months from the date of the agreement subject to shareholders? approval. Berger International will convene an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders if required.

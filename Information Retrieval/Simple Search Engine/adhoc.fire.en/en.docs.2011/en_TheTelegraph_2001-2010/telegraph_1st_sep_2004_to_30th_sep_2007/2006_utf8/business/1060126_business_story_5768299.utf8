 Ruia open to stake sale to fund Dunlop revival

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Calcutta, Jan. 25: Pawan Ruia, the new owner of Dunlop, is considering a private placement of some of his stake to raise cash to restart the ailing tyre company.

 Latest estimates put the cost of reviving the Sahagunj and Ambattur units at Rs 250 crore. 

 The company has set up a team, including merchant bankers, which will work out the modalities for the proposed fund raising programme.

 We may part with 5-10 per cent stake to raise resources, Ruia told The Telegraph.

 Ruia holds a 74.5 per cent stake in Dunlop through a holding company. The management is in talks with banks, financial institutions and other financiers to tie up the arrangement.

 The aim is to get the lowest cost of capital. It could be a plain vanilla loan or placement of shares or a mix of both, Ruia added.

 The company needs Rs 100 crore for plant and machinery and another Rs 55 crore to pay workers dues. It would need Rs 100 crore to meet various other liabilities like sales tax, electricity dues and sundry creditors.

 Dunlop plants are likely to go on production in another six months following the wage pact signed yesterday in Calcutta. Ruia said the agreement with the workers at the Ambattur unit would also be signed soon.

 Board recast

 The Dunlop board went through a complete overhaul today with induction of six new directors, including Pawan Ruia as the non-executive chairman. Ashok Jajodia, the other company nominated member, would be the only whole-time director, while four others ? Narayan Prasad, R.K. Sadhu, Sajid Khan and Deepak Rudra ? were appointed as independent directors of the new board.

 Moreover, the promoters took approval of more than 75 per cent shareholders for change of management to avoid making an open offer for acquisition according to Sebi norms.

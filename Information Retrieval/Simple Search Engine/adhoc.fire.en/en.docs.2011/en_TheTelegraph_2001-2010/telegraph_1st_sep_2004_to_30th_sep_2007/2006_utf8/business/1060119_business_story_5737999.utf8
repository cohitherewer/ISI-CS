 Dip in Biocon third-quarter bottomline

 Shaw: Looking beyond

 Bangalore, Jan. 18 (PTI): Biocon Ltd, the countrys leading biotech firm, today reported a drop in net profit at Rs 44 crore for the third quarter ended December 31 against Rs 50 crore in the corresponding previous quarter. 

 During the April-December period, earnings declined to Rs 126 crore from with Rs 155 crore a year ago, the company said in a statement.

 However, it added that Biocons performance during the nine months was according to expectations with revenues touching Rs 578 crore.

 Consolidated sales grew 7 per cent over the same period in the previous year, while operating profits dropped by 7 per cent. The profit after tax margin stood at 22 per cent, it added.

 The operating results continued to be challenged by difficult pricing environment in the European stetins market. However, the US market for generic stetins offered a respite in 2006-07, the statement said.

 Research services and insulin and other pharmaceutical products posted a strong growth during the nine-month period. Biocons discovery-led diabetes and oncology research programmes were making good progress, the company said.

 Taking stock of the companys performance, chairperson Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw said, I am pleased that we continue to deliver healthy profits at a time when we are investing in our discovery-led research programmes.

 Operating margins of 30 per cent demonstrate the quality and spread of our various businesses, the chairperson said. 

 We are excited over the progress being made on the research and development fronts as we believe that we are creating powerful innovation platforms for future, she added.

 The company is building domain knowledge in both oncology and diabetes, which are focal points of its discovery-led research programmes. 

 The research, combined with manufacturing expertise, reinforced Biocons integrated bio-pharmaceutical model, she added.

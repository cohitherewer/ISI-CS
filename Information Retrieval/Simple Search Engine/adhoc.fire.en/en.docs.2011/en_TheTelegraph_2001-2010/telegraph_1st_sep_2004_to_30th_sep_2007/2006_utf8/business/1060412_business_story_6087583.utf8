 Techbooks to spend $7 m on buyouts

 URVASHI KAUL

 New Delhi, April 11: Techbooks, a US-based knowledge process outsourcing company, will invest $5-7 million in buyouts in India in the current financial year.

 Within less than a year of completing its acquisition of e-learning company Maximise Learning in August last year, Techbook is evaluating further acquisitions in IT-enabled services, pharmaceuticals, healthcare, automobile and litigation support segments. 

 We are eyeing acquisitions in consonance with our plans to re-brand the company into fully integrated solutions provider in all segments of content management ? creation, designing and storage, said Ranjit Singh, president and CEO of Techbook. 

 The company is also in the process of rebranding, said Singh. 

 He said the acquisitions are likely to be financed through a mix of internal accruals, equity and debt, he said. 

 We plan to invest $5-7 million every year if we continue to grow at the same rate of 30 per cent, he said.

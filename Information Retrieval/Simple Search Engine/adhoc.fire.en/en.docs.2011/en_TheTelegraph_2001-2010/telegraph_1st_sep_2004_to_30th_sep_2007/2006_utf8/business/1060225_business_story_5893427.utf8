 HSBC sells 7% of UTI Bank 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Feb. 24: Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Ltd (HSBC) today offloaded a 7.19 per cent stake in UTI Bank in accordance with the Reserve Bank regulation that bars banks with operations in India from holding more than 5 per cent in another bank. HSBC raked in Rs 638.10 crore ($142 million) by offloading 20.03 million shares at an average rate of Rs 318.61 per share.

 With this sale, HSBCs holding in UTI Bank has come down to around 4.99 per cent from 12.18 per cent. While officials from the European bank declined to disclose the identity of the buyers, information from stock exchanges revealed that they were foreign institutional investors ? Fidelity Funds, Mauritius, and Crown Capital Ltd. 

 The third buyer is understood to be The Master Trust Bank of Japan, which is a specialised asset management bank. The principal shareholders of Master Trust include Mitsubishi UFJ Trust amp; Banking Corporation, Nippon Life Insurance Corporation and Meiji Yasuda Life Insurance Co.

 HSBC has made a killing in this transaction. It had acquired a 14.6 per cent stake in UTI Bank from CDC Capital in 2003 for Rs 90 per share. The sale, therefore, translated into a capital gain of 254 per cent for HSBC. The foreign bank had also applied for another 5.46 per cent stake, which was turned down by the RBI.

 UTI Bank also topped the turnover charts at the exchanges. On the BSE, 207.08 lakh shares of UTI changed hands, resulting in a turnover of Rs 659.85 crore.

 HSBCs stake in UTI Bank was reduced to 12 per cent after the latter issued a global depository receipt last year. 

 Following the RBIs regulations, ICICI Bank too brought down its holding in Federal Bank. It also told the central bank that it will prune its holding over a period of time to comply with the regulation.

 While HSBC was prepared for this stake sale, it has been focussing on its Indian operations for the last one year. The parent has allocated close to $243 million to support the fast growing retail and commercial businesses.

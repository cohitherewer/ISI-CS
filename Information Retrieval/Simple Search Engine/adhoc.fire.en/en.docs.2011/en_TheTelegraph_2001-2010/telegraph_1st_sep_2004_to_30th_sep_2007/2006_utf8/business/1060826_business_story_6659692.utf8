 Vodafone sells Proximus stake 

 Brussels, Aug. 25 (Reuters): Belgiums dominant telecom firm Belgacom will take full control of mobile unit Proximus after agreeing to buy Vodafone Groups 25 per cent stake for 2 billion euros (1.4 billion), it said on Friday. 

 Vodafone will use the proceeds from what it said was an attractively priced deal to reduce debt. It said it expects to record a gain of around 450 million in its results for the year ending March 31, 2007 from the sale. 

 This transaction does not materially affect Vodafones proportionate mobile revenue and EBITDA outlook for the financial year ending March 31, 2007, Vodafone said, but added it would no longer receive anticipated dividend income from Proximus of about 150 million, reducing free cash flow. 

 The mobile giant has been under pressure to unravel its global structure with minority interests and concentrate on core western European operations. 

 It announced the sale of its Japanese business in March, the first real retreat from an expansionist strategy that has defined it for years. 

 The Vodafone stock was up 0.7 percent at 111-1/2 pence at 10:40 a.m., while the Dow Jones Europe telecom index was flat. 

 KBC analyst Dirk Saelens said the price for Belgacom was reasonable. He said the company had been paying Vodafone around 140 million euros per year for its minority interest, but would instead now be paying interest closer to 100 million euros. 

 Chief financial officer Ray Stewart said Belgacom was inclined to fund the deal with a bond and added the purchase should increase 2007 earnings per share by 6 to 7 per cent. 

 Belgacom also said it had agreed to sell its 5.8 per cent stake in Frances number two fixed-line operator Neuf Cegetel to French media group Vivendis mobile phone division SFR for at least 187 million euros. 

 In a final announcement on a busy morning, Belgacom said it would buy back up to 200 million euros of its shares. 

 Belgacom shares had gained 2.2 per cent to 27.74 euros by 0935 GMT. They are up 5.5 per cent this week. 

 Belgacom repeated its 2006 guidance that fixed-line sales would fall by 3 per cent, excluding consolidated IT services unit Telindus, and mobile by a 3 to 5 per cent decline. 

 A company spokesman added that it expected the mobile revenue decline to be nearer 3 than 5 per cent, based on the performance in the first six months. 

 Thats a positive element. Theyre also now saying the margin should remain above 46 per cent. Before they said it would be around that level, said Siddy Jobe, analyst at Bank Degroof. 

 Belgacom had almost 74,000 TV customers at the end of June and was on track to surpass the 100,000 mark by the year-end.

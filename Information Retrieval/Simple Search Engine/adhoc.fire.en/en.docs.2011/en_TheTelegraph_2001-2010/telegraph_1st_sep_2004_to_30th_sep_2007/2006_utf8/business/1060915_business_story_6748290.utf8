 Govt waits for MNC thunder in oil hunt

 S.P.S. PANNU

 New Delhi, Sept. 14: The government is keeping its fingers crossed on global majors joining the oil hunt under Nelp-6.

 Indian companies are keen on joint bids with the multinationals who have better technological capabilities and access to greater resources.

 ONGC has established contact with Shell and Italys ENI, while Gail is keen on a tie-up with Russian gas major Gazprom and Daewoo International of South Korea.

 The majors have skipped India previously in the absence of major discoveries.

 The situation changed when Reliance and Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation struck gold in the Krishna Godavari basin, though the jury is still out on Indias hydrocarbon potential.

 Analysts said the majors prefer joint ventures to going solo in India as the countrys reserves were not comparable to other oil bearing regions. The multinationals are keen on buying out existing fields rather than risk sinking money in regions with unproven reserves.

 The case of GSPC appears to indicate that the bigwigs are following this strategy in India. GSPC has shortlisted four majors, including Chevron, British Petroleum and ENI, to sell its 30 per cent stake in the Krishna-Godavari oil block.

 The petroleum ministry said there were 30 foreign companies in the 47 that paid for data on the 55 blocks on offer under the New Exploration and Licencing Policy (Nelp) 6. This does not mean that the 30 will bid for the blocks.

 Among the majors to bid are ENI, Shell, BP, Total, Conoco, Cairn, BHP Billiton, Chevron, Petronas, BG Group and Conoco Philips.

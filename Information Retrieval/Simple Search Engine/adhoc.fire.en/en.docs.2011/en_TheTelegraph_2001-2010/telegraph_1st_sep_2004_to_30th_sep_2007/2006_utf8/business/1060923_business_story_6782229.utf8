 Orissa funds for better roads

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 22: Orissa chief minister Naveen Patnaik today announced investments worth Rs 25,000 crore to improve the states road infrastructure in the next five years. 

 With big IT companies, including TCS and Infosys, setting up base in Orissa, the state will also spend Rs 250 crore to upgrade the Bhubaneshwar airport. The state government wants the Airports Authority of India to handle the job. 

 We are aiming at a quantum jump in software exports and has set a target of $500-million exports by 2011-12. With Infosys, Satyam and TCS expanding and MindTree Consulting, Genpact and Hexaware Technologies becoming operational soon, we are confident of even exceeding this target, Patnaik said at a conference on Investment Opportunities in IT and ITeS sectors in Orissa organised by Nasscom here today.

 In all, four IT parks would come up in the state. Two IT parks, being set up by Genpact and DLF, have already received an in-principle SEZ approval and the other two are likely to be approved by the month-end, the chief minister said.

 Patnaik said the states selling point was that it had some 88 engineering and MCA colleges and 176 polytechnics and these would be able to feed the demand for trained manpower that infotech companies needed.

 Anticipating increased demand for such institutes, we are setting up a number of additional centres of excellence like the Indian Institute of Information Technology and an IIT Khargpur campus at Bhubaneswar, he said.

 Patnaik said, The total investment proposals (in all sectors) we have received till date is almost Rs 400,000 crore. To hasten the process, the government has created a single-window clearance and facilitation system.

 Over the next five years, we will spend Rs 25,000 crore to improve our roads, he told chief executives of top firms at a meeting organised by the National Association of Software and Services Companies (Nasscom) here.

 Other initiatives include two private ports that will open shortly, four new software parks within the next two years, an investment of Rs 16,000 crore in the power sector and a special economic zone to be built by Genpact and DLF.

 The Orissa government has signed 36 memoranda of understanding to generate 15,000 megawatt of power. We are proud to say that the state has near zero power cut, state power minister Surya Narayan Patro said.

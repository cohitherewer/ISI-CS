 ICICI pulls out of Kerala bank

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, March 22: ICICI Bank has offloaded its entire stake in Kerala-based South Indian Bank to comply with Reserve Bank of India (RBI) regulations that bar one bank from having more than 5 per cent stake in another. The countrys second largest commercial bank today sold 47.22 lakh shares to foreign institutional investors (FIIs), constituting 6.71 per cent of South Indian Banks equity, for Rs 30.3 crore.

 The sale was done through block deals on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). While over 25.74 lakh shares were bought by India Capital Fund at a price of Rs 64 per share, 12 lakh shares were purchased by Goldman Sachs Investments (Mauritius) Ltd. The identity of another buyer was not known. Both India Capital Fund and Goldman Sachs are existing investors of South Indian Bank and they hold 3.08 per cent and 1.80 per cent of its equity respectively.

 Analysts said the sale would boost the balancesheet of ICICI Bank during the fourth quarter of the current financial year. This sale comes only days after the bank sold part of its stake in Federal Bank, another Kerala-based bank for Rs 48 crore. These shares were acquired by International Finance Corporation (IFC). Consequent to the acquisition, the shareholding of IFC in the bank rose to 7.76 per cent from around 4 per cent. 

 On the BSE today, the ICICI Bank scrip ended at Rs 592.20 after it opened at Rs 597.50 and rose to a days high of Rs 599.90. The South Indian Bank shares touched an intra-day high of Rs 66.25 on news of the deal after opening at Rs 62.30. It, however, surrendered these gains to close at Rs 61.80.

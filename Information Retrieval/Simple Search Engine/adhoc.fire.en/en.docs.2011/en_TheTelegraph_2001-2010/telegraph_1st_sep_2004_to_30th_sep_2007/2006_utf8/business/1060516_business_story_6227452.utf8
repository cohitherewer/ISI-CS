 Energy boost

 Mumbai, May 15: Suzlon, the countrys largest wind energy firm, will raise Rs 5,000 crore to repay debt incurred for acquiring Belgium-based Hansen Transmission. The fund will also be utilised for capacity expansion at its domestic manufacturing units.

 The Pune-based manufacturer of wind turbine generator, which today reported a 108 per cent jump in net profit at Rs 760.52 crore for 2005-06, expects a 20-25 per cent growth in revenue this fiscal.

 We will raise Rs 5,000 crore from domestic and global markets. Of this, $500 million (Rs 2,250 crore) will be through foreign currency convertible bonds, said Suzlon energy chairman and managing director Tulsi R. Tanti.

 He said the company was looking at various options, including ADRs/GDRs, for raising the balance amount. The FCCB issue, which could be this quarter, would be used for repaying debts raised to acquire Hansen.

 Earlier this year, Suzlon had acquired Hansen for 465 million euros.

 Tanti said about Rs 2,500 crore would be utilised for expanding its backward integration projects at the domestic facilities and to meet other working capital requirements.

 With its current order-book position at Rs 3,300 crore, Suzlon is expecting a 40 per cent surge in orders this year.

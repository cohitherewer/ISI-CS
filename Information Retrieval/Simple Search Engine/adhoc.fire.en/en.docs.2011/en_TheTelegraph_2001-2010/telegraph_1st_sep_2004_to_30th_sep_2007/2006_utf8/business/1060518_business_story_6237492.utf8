 New Delhi, May 17: The Opposition and the Left parties put commerce minister Kamal Nath on the defensive in the Rajya Sabha today as they came out strongly against foreign direct investment (FDI) in general retail trade and demanded a full discussion on the issue.

 The matter came up during the question hour when Nath said the Centre has allowed FDI up to 51 per cent, with prior government approval, in the retail trade of single brand products.

 The minister sought to allay the Oppositions concern that domestic retail trade would be affected saying there was no FDI in general retail trade. 

 He said the issue was being reviewed and, so far, no decision had been taken on allowing FDI in general retail trade.

 However, members of the BJP, JD(U), Left parties and Samajwadi Party voiced serious concern over the issue and they demanded a full debate on the subject.

 When the minister said there could be a debate on the matter, Rajya Sabha chairman Bhairon Singh Shekhawat assured the agitated members that he would arrange a discussion during the current session itself.

 Nath said the government had allowed FDI only in single brand products and it included only those goods that were sold under the same brand internationally. Single brand product retailing would cover products which are branded during the manufacturing process itself. 

 Survey report

 Indias retail industry favours allowing foreign direct investment in the sector in a calibrated manner to allow domestic players prepare for competition, says a survey.

 FDI in retail should be allowed, at best in select sectors, in a calibrated manner. It could be 49 per cent to start with, said the survey of domestic retail sector done by Assocham.

 The survey found that the industry wanted the government to first consult them before making any policy announcement. Most firms argued that the organised retail industry was at a nascent stage and formed only 3 per cent of the entire retail trade.

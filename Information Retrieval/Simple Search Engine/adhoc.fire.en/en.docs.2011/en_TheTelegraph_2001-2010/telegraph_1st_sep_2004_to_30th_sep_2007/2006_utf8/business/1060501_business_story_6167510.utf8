 Odds stacked against Karvy

 - Brokerage chief to explain position to sebi tomorrow

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, April 30: Karvy chairman C. Parthasarathy is due to meet Sebi officials on Tuesday to press his case for a reprieve ? just the way Sameer Gehlaut managed to wangle one last week for Indiabulls.

 The big question is: will Parthasarathy be able to pull it off?

 On the face of it, it does seem unlikely because Karvy ? which is one of the masterminds of the shenanigans that surrounded what has now been dubbed as the IPO scam ? faces a welter of charges from which it will be difficult to wriggle out.

 The truth is that Indiabulls and Karvy cannot be placed on the same footing: the only charge against Indiabulls was that they were among the six key operators involved in cornering 2.09 per cent of retail allotment in the TCS initial public offer. In its defence, the company has said those shares were held as margin received from clients for IPO financing under the Sebi rules. The regulator has suspended the ban on Indiabulls pending the verification of Gehlauts claims.

 But Karvy faces a mountain of charges. First, the report shows that 84 per cent of all the accounts that were used to corner a retail portion of the IPOs were held with Karvy Stock Broking Ltd (dubbed as Karvy-DP because it was the depository participant for the group as a whole).

 Second, the report reveals that of the 24 key operators identified by Sebi, as many as 14 of them had their respective demat accounts with Karvy-DP.

 The numbers are too significant to be dismissed as the normal incidence of business while the stunning percentage in terms of concentration of suspect accounts cannot but tar Karvy-DP with the same brush, says the report.

 The real clincher to prove collusion between Karvy and the operators is that it accepted payment of the amount due on various demat accounts from third-party cheques.

 For example, in case of 225 accounts, a single cheque was deposited in the account of a key operator, while in case of 1,276 accounts, a single cheque was deposited in the account of a key operator. It had also issued a single receipt for the amount paid on behalf of various accounts.

 Similarly, in various accounts of the Panchal group, a single consolidated cheque had been deposited by a third person on behalf of the account holders to settle the outstanding dues.

 One of the most significant charges against Karvy is that it accepted invalid documents towards proof of identity for opening demat accounts. The seriousness of the charge escalates in the light of the fact that those invalid documents were prepared by Karvy itself.

 It was found that the forms of almost all the demat accounts opened by Karvy in fictitious or benami names had letters purportedly issued by Bharat Overseas Bank and Vijaya Bank towards proof of identity (POI) and proof of address (POA). However, investigations show that the savings bank accounts indicated in the accounts did not exist. The branch managers of the concerned banks denied that the bank had issued any letters towards POI and POA indicating the bank account number.

 The report says, In view of the non-existence of the savings bank account with the banks branches and the denial of the branch managers, it is evident that the bank letters based on which Karvy-DP had opened thousands of demat accounts are fraudulent and fabricated.

 Investigations reveal that the details for the fabricated bank letters have been picked up from the depository system and then printed on bogus bank letterheads.

 Since the data in the depository would be available only after entry in the system and not before, it appears that the bank letters had been fabricated after the date of opening of the demat accounts.

 In view of the above, it appears that at the time when Karvy-DP opened the demat accounts, there were no documents evidencing proof of identity and proof of address of the account holder? Karvy might have fabricated the bank letters as an afterthought to make the records complete in the wake of Sebi enquiry in October 2005 long after the opening of the demat accounts, says the report.

 Karvy also faces another grave charge of exploiting the trust of Bharat Overseas Bank with which it had tied up during 2003 for the purpose of financing its demat account clients. In 2005, Karvy used complete knowledge of the details of the bank accounts for opening multiple demat accounts fabricating the bank documents and procuring photographs from other sources.

 The Sebi investigations found that Karvy Registrar and Transfer Agent had issued consolidated refund orders favouring banks and financial institutions in respect of the applications that were financed by them. It issued a single refund order to Bharat Overseas Bank in respect of 6,878 applicants in the case of IDFC issue.

 Similarly, it issued consolidated refund orders favouring Centurion Bank Limited, IDBI Limited, Indian Overseas Bank, Infrastructure Leasing amp; Financial Services Ltd, Kotak Street.com and ICICI Web Trade Limited in respect of thousands of applicants to the Yes Bank and IDFC IPOs.

 The Sebi report says, It can be concluded that Karvy was instrumental at the root of creating rootless wonders by opening demat accounts in thousands of fictitious names.

 Parthasarathy defends his group saying that the fictitious accounts were opened by a handful of sub-brokers in two branches at Ahmedabad and Mumbai and the company had already taken action in this regard and suspended some employees in Ahmedabad.

 We acted on certificates of introduction issued by bankers. Now, the banks claim that the certificates are forged. Sebis charge that they have been issued with the connivance of Karvy is baseless and simply based on the bank concerned along with the said individuals who seemed to have acted in collusion and are now shifting the blame, said Parthasarathy.

 Karvy claims that if it had acted with a malafide intent or benefited unduly, it should have received the benefit either by way of shares or funds by way of profit realised on these shares. It claims that it did not receive any undue benefits.

 On Tuesday, we will know whether the regulator buys this argument.

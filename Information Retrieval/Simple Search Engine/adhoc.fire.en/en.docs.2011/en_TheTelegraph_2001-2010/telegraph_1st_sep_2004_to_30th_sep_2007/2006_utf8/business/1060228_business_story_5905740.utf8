 Arcelor growth plan to thwart Mittal

 Dolle: Strategist extraordinaire

 Paris, Feb. 27 (Reuters): European steel group Arcelor unveiled a three-year growth plan on Monday as it urges its shareholders to reject an unsolicited $22.6 billion offer by global sector leader Mittal Steel Co.

 The group, led by chief executive Guy Dolle, is kicking off a tour of capitals to meet investors and try to convince them there is more value in keeping Arcelor independent than by accepting Mittals proposed shares-and-cash offer.

 Mittal founder Lakshmi Mittal has already met Arcelor shareholders and claims wide support for a bid that would create a steel group with capacity of more than 100 million tonnes and with global market share of about 10 per cent.

 Mittal is due to brief the governments of France, Spain and Luxembourg about further details of the plans to weld the two groups together, against politicians fears of job losses and further erosion of national control over a key basic industry.

 Arcelor said in a statement it was aiming to increase annual earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization each year from 2006 to 2008 and beyond, with a target of 7.0 billion euros ($8.29 billion) by 2008, excluding exceptional items.

 The worlds number two steel maker said it would return to shareholders all gains from the sale of non-strategic assets and any acquisitions would have to have a return on capital of at least 15 per cent.

 Arcelor said it would continue its progressive dividend policy with a pay-out ratio of 30 per cent and would have sustainable and resilient free cash-flow generation of 4.4 billion euros per year.

 Arcelor said it aimed to reduce working capital by 800 million euros by 2008 and would cut yearly maintenance capital expenditure by 400 million euros from 2006.

 It also said management compensation would be more aligned with the value created for shareholders.

 Arcelor shares gained 0.36 per cent to 30.61 euros. Mittal was up 0.49 per cent at 28.50 euros, valuing its proposed bid at 29.83 euros per Arcelor share.

 Back-office: Wipro forte

 OUR BUREAU

July 19: Wipro Ltd, the leading software services firm, today posted a 45 per cent rise in net profit at Rs 620.4 crore for the first quarter ended June 30 compared with Rs 428 crore in the corresponding period last year.

 Riding an outsourcing boom and a strong dollar, the Bangalore-based company beat its global IT services revenue guidance.

 Revenues for the April-June quarter increased 39 per cent to Rs 3,143 crore.

 Chairman Azim Premji told reporters that offshoring continues to be buoyant. In these exciting times, we are well-positioned to benefit from our diversified portfolio and expertise. Looking forward to the quarter ending September, we expect revenues from our global IT services business to be approximately $577 million, he said.

 Revenue from the New York Stock Exchange-listed firms global IT services business was $539.3 million (Rs 2,425 crore), ahead of its guidance of $533 million. Wipro added 62 new customers, including around 20 from recent acquisitions. The IT major also brought on board 2,400 employees.

 Despite the strong performance, Wipro shares fell 5.5 per cent to Rs 458.30 on the Bombay Stock Exchange today.

 The company said global IT services and products revenue grew 42 per cent to Rs 2,451 crore. 

 Chief financial officer Suresh Senapathy said continued improvements in BPO profitability helped partially offset additional investments in sales and marketing and acquisition-related pressures on profitability.

 Despite a string of acquisitions in the past six months, Premji hinted that the IT firms buyouts would be bigger in the next few months, as it seeks to build a stronger strategic footprint overseas. 

 The size of future acquisitions will be a little bigger than the past. We are looking at buyouts from the point of view of building a stronger strategic footprint, he said.

 In the last six months, Wipro had announced six acquisitions, including that of US-based design services provider Quantech and European retail solutions provider Enabler. 

 While these acquisitions definitely have a long-term strategic value, we are equally confident that we will derive significant value from these in the medium term as well, Premji added.

 Calcutta plans

 Premji said Wipro was looking at expanding its presence in Calcutta. We are looking at Calcutta along with other centres. We will increase our presence there, he said without elaborating.

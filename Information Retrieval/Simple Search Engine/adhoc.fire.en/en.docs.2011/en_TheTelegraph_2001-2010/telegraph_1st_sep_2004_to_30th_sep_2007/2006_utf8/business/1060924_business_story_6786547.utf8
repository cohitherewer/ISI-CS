 Reliance finds more gas in KG basin

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Treasure hunt

 Mumbai, Sept. 23: Reliance Industries (RIL) continues to strike gold in its oil exploration and production (E amp;P) endeavours. The largest private sector company of the country today announced that it has discovered gas in the Krishna Godavari basin and that this has been communicated to the directorate-general of hydrocarbons (DGH).

 RIL has notified DGH about the discovery of gas in KG-OSN-2001/1 (NELP-III) block in Krishna Godavari basin off east coast of India. The discovery has been named Dhirubhai 28. This notification has been made in terms of the production sharing contract (PSC) entered into by RIL and the government of India, RIL said in a press statement.

 However, the company did not comment on the estimated reserves in the block or its commercial value. The potential commercial interest of the said discovery is yet to be established, Reliance said.

 A company official said it would still take some time for an estimate to be available. A third party will come and certify it. Only then can some estimate be made available, he added.

 This is the second major discovery announced by Reliance since chairman Mukesh Ambani told shareholders at the annual general meeting in June that crude oil was discovered in the MA1 well in deep water D6 block in the Krishna Godavari basin. 

 Ambani had then said that testing had been done in two zones located three kilometres below sea level. The discovery signified a large geological play that could result in future discoveries. RIL also had made crude oil discoveries in two wells in the KG-III-6 shallow water block.

 Early this week, RILs head of international operations Atul Chandra had indicated at an oil conference in London that natural gas reserves in the KG block could exceed 50 trillion cubic feet (tcf). 

 Deliveries to consumers from the KG block is expected to take place in the second half of 2008-09. Reliance is planning to set up a 1400 km east coast-west coast pipeline to transport the gas.

 that traverses the states of Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Karnataka.

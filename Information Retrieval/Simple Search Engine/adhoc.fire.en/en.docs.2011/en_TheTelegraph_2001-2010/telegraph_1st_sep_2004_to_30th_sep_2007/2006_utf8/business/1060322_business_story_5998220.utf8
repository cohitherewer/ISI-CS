 New Delhi, March 21: The Indian Hotels Company Limited (IHCL) is keen to form a joint venture with the Indian Railways to build budget hotels across the country.

 ?We are interested and keenly looking at tenders floated by the Railways. If we get land from them, it will be great for our projects,? Uday Narain, chief operating officer of Roots Corporation, said. Roots is the wholly owned subsidiary of IHCL that operates the company?s budget hotels. 

 The Railway Board has recently approved 40 sites to build such hotels. ?This could go up to 100 sites eventually. We will first start with the national capital region where at least three to four sites are proposed to be given. ? we are already talking to Taj, Welcomgroup and other big chains for this purpose. The response is very good,? a senior railway official said. The bidding would end within a month, he added.

 Ginger brand

 IHCL today rebranded its budget chain of hotels as ?Ginger?. It was known as indiOne Hotels. Today, IHCL opened its second 100-room property in Haridwar. Simultaneously, the hotel in Bangalore has been re-branded Ginger hotel.

 IHCL managing director Raymond Bickson said high land prices were a deterrent in building more such hotels. ?Besides, it was a learning project for us and we were waiting for the feedback.?

 The firm is now exploring the option of opening hotels under the Ginger brand in Bhubaneswar, Pune, Mysore, Thiruvananthapuram, Durgapur and Goa by the year-end. Bickson said work would begin at the properties in Agartala, Tirupur, Pondicherry and Nashik in the next few months.

 The company estimates a budget hotel will cost around Rs 10 crore, excluding real estate expenses. IHCL wants to build both 100-room and 200-room hotels for business and leisure travellers. IHCL will invest Rs 120 crore to build 10 to 12 Ginger hotels in the next one year. The tariff is Rs 900 for a single room and Rs 1,175 for a double room.

 On IHCL?s overseas expansion plans, Bickson said, ?We are currently looking at China, Vietnam, Thailand and Bali. These could be both acquisitions or greenfield projects.?

 IHCL earns 20 per cent of its revenues from overseas operations. ?We would like to garner at least one-third of our revenues from our hotels abroad,? said Bickson.

 IHCL recently opened hotels in Sydney and New York. 

 Sharing his plans for service apartments like the Wellington Mews at Mumbai, Bickson said: ?The second one should be up and running in the next two years. Delhi, Calcutta, Hyderabad, Chennai and North Mumbai are some destinations we are looking at.?

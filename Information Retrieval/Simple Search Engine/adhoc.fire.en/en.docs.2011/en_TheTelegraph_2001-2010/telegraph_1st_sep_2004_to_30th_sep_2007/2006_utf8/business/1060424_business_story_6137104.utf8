 FM to talk farm rates with banks

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 23: Finance minister P. Chidambaram will meet the chiefs of public sector banks tomorrow to discuss key issues such as agriculture lending rates and the liquidity situation.

 The meeting will discuss the budget proposal to enhance the flow of short-term credit to farmers for the kharif season. The government has decided to provide short-term credit to farmers at 7 per cent rate of interest for loans up to Rs 3 lakh. 

 Last month, banks suggested that Nabard be tapped for low-cost refinance facilities. 

 Another option that we suggested was to provide tax breaks to banks for this particular loan portfolio or reduce the risk weightage of the loan from 100 per cent to about 50 per cent, said a senior banker.

 Bankers said the cost of lending to farmers is as high as 9.5 per cent due to the higher risks that are attached with such loans.

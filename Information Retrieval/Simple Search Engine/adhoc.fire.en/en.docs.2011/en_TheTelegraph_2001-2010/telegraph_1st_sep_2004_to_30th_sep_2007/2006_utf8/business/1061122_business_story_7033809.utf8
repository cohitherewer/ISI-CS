The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Bosch eyes local market

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Hieronimus: Upbeat

 Calcutta, Nov. 21: Bosch India might consider bringing the companys international range of consumer appliances to the country to achieve a target of 8 per cent growth.

 About eight to 10 years ago, IFB Industries used to import and sell Bosch washing machines after co-branding them as IFB-Bosch.

 The arrangement was discontinued as the market was not mature enough then to encourage sufficient volumes.

 We are expecting a growth of 8 per cent across businesses against the current 4 to 4.5 per cent. To achieve this growth, we have to explore inorganic routes in addition to organic ones. Acquisitions would also include expansion of activities and with the current growth in consumer products in India, the company should be looking at bringing back these appliances to the country, said Albert Hieronimus, managing director of Motor Industries Co Ltd (Mico) and spokesperson of Bosch India.

 Bosch, which only retailed washing machines in India, has automatic dishwashers, light wave ovens, fridges with anti-bacteria finish or the wall-mounted LiftMatic oven.

 Robert Bosch Hausgerte GmbH (home appliances) is a 50:50 joint venture between BSH Bosch and Siemens Hausgerte GmbH. Its portfolio has brands like Bosch, Siemens, Gaggenau, Neff, Thermador, Constructa and Ufesa.

 The home appliances company is present in China, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand.

 If the firm brought the entire range or part of it to India, it would initially take the vendor route till business volumes justify importing the products from Europe.

 Bosch will invest Rs 1,800 crore in India within 2005-2008 to develop new products. The company is expecting 25 per cent of its revenue to come from the Asia Pacific region by 2015.

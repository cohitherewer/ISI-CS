 Global float fetches Cipla $170 m 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, April 12: Pharmaceutical firm Cipla Ltd has raised $170 million through the issue of over 1.10 crore global depository receipts (GDRs). The GDRs, which will be listed on Luxembourg stock exchange, were priced at $15.30 apiece.

 Each GDR represents one underlying share. Based on the closing price of the Cipla stock at Rs 730.70 per share on Bombay Stock Exchange today, its pricing represents a discount of over 5.3 per cent. 

 The company has informed stock exchanges that these GDRs were placed through a book-building route.

 Cipla has entered into a purchase agreement with CLSA Singapore Pte Ltd and Kotak Mahindra (International) Ltd. 

 CLSA Singapore and Kotak Mahindra acted as joint global co-ordinators and joint book runners for the offering. The company had launched the issue on April 10 and it was closed today.

 Cipla, which is one of the countrys largest pharmaceutical companies, had announced in early February that it will issue securities in the domestic or the international market. The offering has been made to fund its capital expenditure plans. Later in the month, Cipla declared a bonus issue in the ratio of three shares for every two shares held.

 The company was in news last month, when a US Court order had rejected GSK Pharmas plea to block the generic version of its anti nasal spray, Flonase. 

 The verdict meant that Cipla could supply base material for the generic version of the anti-aesthma product to unlisted Roxane Laboratories, which is an arm of Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH. The supply is expected to boost Ciplas topline.

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, July 7: Riding high demand in cement and the growth in infrastructure projects in the country, UltraTech Cements Ltd has posted robust numbers for 2005-06.

 The Aditya Birla Group firm has rewarded shareholders with a dividend of 17.50 per cent. 

 The companys earnings sky rocketed to Rs 230 crore during the year from Rs 3 crore in the previous fiscal. 

 Revenue jumped more than 26 per cent at Rs 3,299 crore against Rs 2,607 crore in 2004-05. 

 According to analysts, the results are in line with market expectations.

 Profit before tax stood at Rs 286 crore, after providing for interest of Rs 90 crore and depreciation Rs 216 crore. 

 The figures for the year under review include those of Narmada Cement Co Ltd for the period October 1, 2005 to March 31, 2006.

 The company is planning to spend Rs 1,660 crore towards capex expenses in the next three years. Of this, about Rs 760 crore will be spent this year. 

 Domestic cement realisation increased 21 per cent from Rs 1,750 pmt to Rs 2,123 pmt. 

 Export realisation also improved. Both cement and clinker export realisations increased 11 per cent and 23 per cent respectively.

 However, due to the crude price rally, power and fuel costs have increased 8 per cent last year.

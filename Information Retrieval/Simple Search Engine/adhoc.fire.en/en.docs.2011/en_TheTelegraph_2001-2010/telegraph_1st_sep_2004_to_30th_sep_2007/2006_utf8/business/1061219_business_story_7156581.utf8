 New Delhi, Dec. 18: Kinetic Motors Company, part of the Rs 2,000-crore Firodia group, expects to break even in the first quarter of next year.

 The company, which has set a target to clock a turnover of Rs 1,300 crore in the next calendar year, will launch two scooters and a scooterette in 2007. This year, the turnover is likely to be around Rs 800 crore.

 The company has been suffering losses for sometime now, but we will break even in the first quarter of next year and register net profit in the second quarter. The launches will help us do that, said Ajinkya Firodia, vice-president, sales and marketing, Kinetic Motors.

 Kinetic Motors will launch two scooters in 135cc and 250cc categories from the Italjet SpA range. Last year, the company acquired the rights to manufacture seven models of the Italian two-wheeler company for the domestic market and exports.

 A scooterette will also be launched from the Sanyang Industry Company range. Kinetic entered into a joint venture with Sanyang Industry earlier this year.

 Sanyang Industry is a Taiwanese company which also has operations in Vietnam, Indonesia and China. It has bought an 11 per cent stake in Kinetic Motors.

 Kinetic Motors today launched the 165cc Blaze, an automatic motoscooter, in two variants. While the standard variant is priced at Rs 50,999, the disc brake variant comes with a price tag of Rs 53,999 (ex-showroom, Delhi).

 The Blaze has a top speed of 105 km/hour. Next year, Kinetic Motors targets to sell 36,000 units of Blaze in the domestic market and export 10,000 units to Europe and Africa.

 Century cements Bengal ties

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Birla: Destination East

 Mumbai, July 12: BK Birla group flagship Century Textiles and Industries Ltd is likely to set up a 1.5-million-tonne cement grinding plant in Murshidabad district of Bengal as part of its expansion plans. The company is in the process of acquiring a 150-acre plot for the proposed project.

 While the project is still at a preliminary stage, analysts expect it to cost over Rs 500 crore.

 Century Textiles director Kumar Mangalam Birla told shareholders at the annual general meeting today that the company would take a final call after acquiring the land and conducting a viability study. Also, it has not set a deadline for starting commercial operations at the unit.

 Birla was appointed as an additional director of the company with effect from February 7. He chaired the meeting in the absence of S.K. Birla, who has resigned from the company.

 Century Textiles has an installed capacity to manufacture 6.3 million tonnes, which comprises Century Cement, Maihar Cement Units I amp; II and Manikgarh Cement. 

 All units are on course to enhance their capacities through de-bottlenecking and upgrading. This will raise the capacity from 6.30 million tonnes to 7.80 million tonnes by the third quarter of 2006-07. Birla, however, did not divulge the quantum of investment for the proposed cement grinding unit.

 The company is planning to infuse Rs 385 crore to expand the paper manufacturing capacity by 75,000 tonnes.

 While the company is on an expansion spree, it is also planning to downsize the composite mill at Worli in central Mumbai. It will reduce the production at this textile mill. While 1,200 looms and 77,000 spindles are in operation, Century Textiles is planning to run the mill with about 500 looms. 

 Birla said operating a composite textile mill in Mumbai may not be viable in the long run due to technical limitations of the machinery, high labour costs, octroi and municipal taxes, water charges and the rising cost of electricity.

 Responding to shareholder queries on a dispute with the Wadias of Bombay Dyeing over the Century Mill land, Birla said the company does not intend to develop a part of the land for real estate purposes.

 He further said Century Textiles was not shifting its textile operations to Gujarat, but only considering setting up a state-of-the-art textile mill at Bharuch. 

 He also revealed that of the 30-acre plot on which the mill rests, 10 acres was taken on lease from the Wadias for 999 years and the rest was a free-hold area independent of any encumbrances.

 Century Textiles president R.K. Dalmia said while the total workforce at the Worli unit stood at 7,000, the company plans to reduce it to 2,000. The process is expected to be completed by the middle of next calendar year. He also denied that the company has any plans to develop the land for real estate purposes. At present, we are not developing any land in the site.

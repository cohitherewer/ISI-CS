 Overseas buyout on IOC radar

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hyderabad, Feb. 24: Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) plans to invest $2-$3 billion over the next five years to acquire overseas oil exploration and production assets, chairman Sarthak Behuria said.

 It has earmarked a $2-billion corpus for inorganic growth through acquisitions. 

 We are ready to spend $2-$3 billion for acquisitions and propose to bid for equity along with Oil India Ltd and also with local overseas partners if necessary, Behuria said on the sidelines of the 14th international aviation conference.

 He said IOC has planned to invest $15.5 billion by 2011 to realise its growth plans. We plan to grow into a $69-billion company by 2011, he said. 

 He said two or three prospective investments are being assessed by the IOC and Oil India combine. 

 Behuria was reluctant to give details of the prospects being assessed. He, however, said the companies were looking at oil assets abroad not merely for portfolio investment but also active involvement in their development.

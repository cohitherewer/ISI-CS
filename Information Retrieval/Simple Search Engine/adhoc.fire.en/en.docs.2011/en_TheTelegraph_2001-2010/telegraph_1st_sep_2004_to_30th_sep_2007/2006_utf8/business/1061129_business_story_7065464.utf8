 Cairn to sink extra cash into Ravva

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Ravva (Andhra Pradesh), Nov. 28: Oil explorer Cairn India is making fresh investment in the Ravva oil field to maintain the current level of production.

 Ravva accounts for 7 per cent of Indias oil production, pumping 50,000 barrels of oil per day from 1999 till date.

 Cairn is the operator in the field with a 22.5 per cent interest, while the other partners include ONGC, Videocon and Marubeni.

 The consortium has earmarked $105 million or Rs 470 crore to retain production at this level.

 The field, located in the Krishna-Godavari basin, was to come off the plateau (50,000 bopd) in 2005. However, timely intervention stopped this.

 Cairn has started a new campaign to drill six infill wells and one exploratory well within the Ravva field since October to maintain the production of 50,000 bopd till the end of 2007.

 This project would cost the consortium some $90 million, David Nisbet, director communication of Cairn India, said. At present, there are eight unmanned platforms in the field.

 However, as the operator of Ravva, Cairn is planning to take up further exploration activities there.

 Interpretation and mapping of major sub-surface in Ravva has permitted Cairn to identify nine internally high- ranked prospects, above and below the currently producing areas. A comprehensive inventory has been collated, based upon the analysis of block-wide 3D seismic data and from various wells in and around the Ravva field.

 A study conducted by WesternGeco, a geophysical services company, suggested that Ravva is a good candidate for 4D seismic data acquisition.

 These studies are intended to help find oil that has not been drained by the current recovery scheme or new prospects in the Ravva area.

 Cairn may deploy this new technology to maintain the crude plateau. This is likely to cost another $15 million.

 Incidentally, Cairn had raised oil production from this field the first in the highly prospective KG Basin that now boasts of huge finds of Reliance and GSPC from a mere 3,700 bopd under ONGC to this level today.

 Apart from oil, Ravva has been producing natural gas since September 2001.

 The gas is sold to GAIL, while the oil is transported to HPCLs Vishakhapatnam refinery and Bongaigaon Refinery in Assam.

 Cairn, which is coming up with an IPO, has also found huge reserves in Rajasthan. 

 Production from the Barmer basin in western Rajasthan will start from 2009 and stabilise at 150,000 bopd. 

 The company is talking to the government and third parties to place a pipeline to refinery.

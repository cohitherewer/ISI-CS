 Fresh fetters on telemarketing

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Ready to hang up

 Mumbai, April 1: For many of us who have to do the onerous job of registering with each bank to stop unwanted telemarketing calls hawking financial products, help is on the way. 

 A common Do-Not-Call registry covering all financial products will be set up over the next few months. Apart from doing away with the process of approaching each bank, the mechanism will enable customers to register their names in a no-call list maintained in a web-site.

 A decision to this effect was taken today at a meeting between the Indian Banks? Association (IBA) and Indian Cards Council (ICC), facilitated by MasterCard International. 

 The governance committee of the cards council comprises officials from MasterCard International, Central Bank of India, Citibank, HDFC Bank, HSBC, ICICI Bank and Vijaya Bank.

 This step comes after the Reserve Bank of India issued guidelines on credit card operations last year. The central bank had then stipulated that each bank should set up a Do-Not-Call registry for customers who did not wish to receive telemarketing calls from a bank. According to India Cards Council, though banks have set up such Do-Not-Call centres, customers have found the arrangement cumbersome as they have to register with each bank separately. 

 Drawing upon its experiences in the US and Canada, MasterCard suggested a better solution would be for the cards industry as a whole to operate a Common Do- Not-Call Registry. 

 ?After extensive discussion and meetings a decision was taken to progress in the direction of setting up a common Do-Not-Call centre,? a press statement issued by the IBA said today. 

 It is expected that in three months a request for proposal will be issued inviting prospective service operators to bid to set up and operate the centre. 

 Though IBA did not elaborate on how individuals can put their names in the proposed registry, industry insiders say that it can well be a website.

 Last year, the RBI announced a fair practice code for banks and non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) for credit card operations. 

 The apex bank had asked the card issuing bank/NBFC to maintain a Do-Not-Call registry containing the phone numbers (both cell phones and land phones) of customers as well as non-customers (non-constituents) who have informed them that they do not wish to receive unsolicited calls/SMS from the bank.

 According to the RBI, the intimation for including an individual?s telephone number in the registry should be facilitated through a website maintained by the bank/NBFC or on the basis of a letter received from such a person addressed to the bank/NBFC. 

 The RBI also asked the card issuers to introduce a system whereby the direct selling agents, direct marketing agents and call centres be directed to first submit to the bank/NBFC a list of numbers they intend to call for marketing purposes. The bank/NBFC should then refer to the registry and only those numbers that do not figure in the registry should be cleared for calling.

 Though most of the banks have implemented these guidelines, customers have found it tough since they have to register with each individual banks separately.

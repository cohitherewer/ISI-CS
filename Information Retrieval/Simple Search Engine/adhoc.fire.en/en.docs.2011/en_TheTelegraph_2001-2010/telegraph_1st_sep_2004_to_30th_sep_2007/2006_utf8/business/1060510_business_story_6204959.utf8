 Fresh twist to Ranbaxy will row

 Bitter pill

 New Delhi, May 9 (PTI): The tussle over Ranbaxy patriarch Bhai Mohan Singh?s will is set to intensify with his second son Manjit Singh today staking claim to his parents? assets, which includes shares of about 40 companies.

 ?It is a matter of principle. I was given my share when the family settlement took place in 1990. But now as a son I am claiming my share to the immovable assets, shares in about 30-40 companies and jewellery that was owned by my parents,? Manjit said.

 Asked how he could claim his share since he had already been included in the family settlement, he said, ?I am not claiming what my brothers have been given. Since my parents are no more, their assets have to be divided among the sons.?

 While he declined to give a valuation of the assets, he said the shares included about 7-8 lakh of Ranbaxy.

 ?If these (Ranbaxy shares) were held by my mother, I would claim, but if they were held by my father, I have no issues,? he said.

 He said the will left by his father had a ?lot of lacunae and would be challenged in the court?. ?In another 10-15 days I would be filing a case,? he added.

 Disputing claims made by his younger brother and Max Healthcare chairman Analjit Singh over the family property at the Aurangzeb Road, he said, ?A case is already pending in Delhi High Court, which challenges the transfer of Delhi Guest House shares to Bhai Mohan Singh Foundation.?

 ?Those shares were illegally transferred to Bhai Mohan Singh Foundation. Ever since it came up, Delhi Guest House was meant to be used by the family members for residential purpose and had to be divided among them for the same purpose,? he said.

 ?As it stands today, matter relating to 53 per cent of the shares of Delhi Guest House is subjudice and is in court,? he said.

 When contacted, Analjit declined to comment.

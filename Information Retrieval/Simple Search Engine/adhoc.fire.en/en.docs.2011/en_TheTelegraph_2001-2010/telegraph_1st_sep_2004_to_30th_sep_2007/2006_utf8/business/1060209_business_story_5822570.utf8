 Special tea fund sought

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Feb. 8: The Indian Tea Associations wish list for budget 2006-07 seeks a special purpose replantation fund and continuance of tax concessions for the industry.

 ITA has urged the Centre to create a special purpose tea fund (SPTF) to provide loan assistance to tea units, especially ones which are unable to access bank finance, to motivate them to undertake replantation. 

 The proposal for the SPTF is awaiting approval from the cabinet, non-banking financial corporation and the Reserve Bank. SBI Caps was the financial consultant for the project proposal. Plans are afoot to replant 2.12 hectares over the next 15 years.

 The loan funds should have a tenure exceeding 10-15 years with an interest of 8 to 8.5 per cent. As the first five years of the replanted bush would not have any yield, commercial banks were reluctant to take such long-term exposure with long gestation periods, said Monojit Dasgupta, general secretary, ITA. 

 The average cost of replantation process, including rejuvenation, is Rs 2.6 lakh per hectare. The Tea Board bears one-fourth of the cost.

 The total cost over the course of the next 15 years would be Rs 4,700 crore, Dasgupta explained.

 The government currently provides a replanting subsidy of 25 per cent and is planning to raise it to 40 per cent. Hence, with the raised subsidy and the Tea Boards provision, the units would require only 50 per cent as loan funds.

 The proposal also recommends locking a certain amount of the replanted tea through public auction, which operates on a relative transparency and has average projected price levels.

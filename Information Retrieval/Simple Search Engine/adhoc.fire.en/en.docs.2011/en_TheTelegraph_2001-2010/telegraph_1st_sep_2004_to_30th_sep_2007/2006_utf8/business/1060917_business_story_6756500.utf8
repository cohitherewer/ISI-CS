 Hari: Looking forward

 Calcutta, Sept. 16: Ontrack Systems Ltd, the Calcutta-based information technology service provider, is planning to acquire a company in the UK. 

 Though Ontrack already has a subsidiary there, it is not involved in the current negotiation. We ourselves are talking to the UK company, said Ontrack Systems promoter B. Hari. 

 The software application and network solutions provider is already in the process of buying out the US-based Intellisys group, which has three outfits Intellisys USA, Intellisys Australia and Intellisys India. 

 We have just concluded the due diligence for acquiring Intellisys group companies and the acquisition will be completed within a couple of weeks, said Hari, who and his family hold 30.84 per cent share in the company. The public holding is 43.99 per cent. 

 With these acquisitions, totalling $64.9 million, we will have significant presence in the US and Australia. We are looking for an acquisition in the UK to consolidate our presence in Europe, Hari said. 

 According to him, the UK company specialises in enterprise resource planning (ERP) solutions. Interestingly, Ontrack Systems has recently bagged the ERP contract from Linc Pen amp; Plastics. 

 Ontrack will initially implement the ERP solution at one of Linc Pens retail outlet in Calcutta and then in other parts of the country.

 Ontrack is also planning to consolidate its equity shares by converting the face value of its shares to Rs 10 from Re 1 now. Only late last year, the company had split its shares one share of Rs 10 was split into 100 shares of Re 1 each. 

 The company had also issued bonus shares one share for every two held. 

 Besides stock consolidation, the company is also planning to come out with a follow-on public issue by the end of this year.

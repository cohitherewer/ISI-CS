 Raipur, March 3: American power company AES Corporation will invest $1.2 billion to set up a coal-fired 1000-mw plant in Chhattisgarh.

 The company will invest this amount through its subsidiary, AES India Private Limited. 

 Company officials claimed that this will be one of the largest foreign direct investments in the power sector. The move reassures the rising global importance of the country?s power sector.

 AES India today inked a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Chhattisgarh government and the state electricity board for the project. 

 The MoU was signed in the presence of chief minister Raman Singh and American consulate general Michael Owen. Principal secretary (energy) Vivek Dhand, who signed on behalf of the state government, said the company had been asked to submit its work plan within 60 days and a feasibility report within six months.

 The implementation agreement would be translated into action in a year, Dhand said, adding that it meant the company would start its work within a year. 

 Allena Srinivas Rao, country leader of AES for India and Sri Lanka, signed on behalf of the company. Singh said the power plant is likely to come up somewhere near Raigarh. 

 According to the MoU, AES India will develop, construct, own and operate the power plant in the state. The company will have the right to develop the project, which will be integrated with a captive coal mine.

 AES president for Asia Haresh Jaisinghani said the plant would supply electricity to the power deficit states in India. ?In addition to the benefits to the local economy, the state stands to gain from the project by purchasing 7.5 per cent of the electricity generated from the project on favourable terms,? he added.

 AES, a New York Stock Exchange listed and a Fortune 500 company, started its operations in India in 1998. 

 At present, AES owns 49 per cent in Orissa Power General Corporation (OPGC) ? a joint venture with the Orissa government ? to generate power in the state.

 Pressure on Mittal to sweeten bid

 Mittal: Money matters

 Luxembourg/Brussels, June 21 (Reuters): The worlds biggest steelmaker Mittal Steel faced further pressure to raise its 23-billion-euro ($29-billion) bid for rival Arcelor after Russian suitor Severstal improved its friendly merger offer.

 Directors from Arcelor were gathering in Luxembourg on Wednesday, home of the worlds second largest steelmaker, to discuss which of its suitors in the five-month-old battle would make the best match.

 It seems to be a win-win situation for Arcelor because Severstal has improved the offer substantially and now this might force Mittal to sweeten its offer if it really needs Arcelor, said a trader at a French brokerage.

 Shares in Arcelor were up 1 per cent at 35.8 euros while Severstal shares were off 0.3 per cent at 280 roubles after reaching an earlier high of 285.87 roubles.

 Mittal shares, traded in Amsterdam, were up 1.2 per cent at 25.65 euros, valuing its current offer of 1 new share and 10.05 euros in cash for every Arcelor share at 35.70 euros.

 On Tuesday, Severstal revised the terms of its merger proposal, saying that majority owner Alexei Mordashov would settle for 25 per cent of the new group rather than the initially proposed 32.3 per cent and raised its offer by about 2 billion euros. 

 Mittal said on Wednesday it had no immediate comment to make about the Russian groups move to block its proposed takeover of Arcelor. 

 Under the previous deal, which envisaged Arcelor acquiring Severstal for shares on the basis of valuing Arcelor at 44 euros-a-share or 29.5 billion euros, Mordashov would end up owning 32.3 per cent of the combined group after buying an additional tranche of new Arcelor shares.

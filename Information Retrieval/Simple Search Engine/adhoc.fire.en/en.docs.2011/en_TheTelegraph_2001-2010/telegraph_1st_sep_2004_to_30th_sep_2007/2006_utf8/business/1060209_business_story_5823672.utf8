The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Century set to cement ties with Bengal

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Birla: New plans 

 Calcutta, Feb. 8: Keeping in mind the demand-supply mismatch in the state, Basant Kumar Birla-owned Century Textiles and Industries is planning to set up a cement plant in Bengal. 

 The company wants to set up a 1.5-million-tonne grinding unit in the northern part of the state at an estimated investment of Rs 180 crore. 

 We have identified some land. It would take about six months to get various permissions. Production should start by the end of 2007, chairman B.K. Birla told The Telegraph.

 The company has four units in the three states of Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. As Bengal does not have limestone deposits, the company plans to bring clinker from existing units and grind here.

 The investment would be done through a mix of debt and internal accruals. Birla said no fresh equity would be issued to meet expenditure.

 Cement is the highest revenue earner for Century, contributing 47 per cent of 2004-05 sales.

 The company is planning to expand total capacity from 6.3 mt to 7.8 mt by the third quarter of this year at all the existing locations.

 Birla said the strong demand in the state has encouraged the company to touch base here.

 Industry observers put demand in Bengal at 6.75 mt annually, while the production is now 4.2 mt. The shortfall is being met from units in neighbouring states.

 As a result, the sector is attracting fresh investment in the state.

 Holcim-owned Ambuja Cement Eastern Ltd is setting up a plant at Farakka at an investment of Rs 115 crore.

 Moreover, the MP Birla group flagship Birla Corporation has expanded capacity by 1 mt in Durgapur. 

 French company Lafarge had also expressed interest to set up a unit here.

 During the year, cement production in the state is growing by 7.5 per cent compared with the national rate of 9 per cent.

 Cement off-take has remained depressed this year in Bengal since many of the road projects have been completed, while the new ones are yet to take off.

 Cement prices are now hovering at Rs 170 for a 50-kg bag in the state, which is higher than last year. Since winter is the boom period for construction, the industry is expecting a Rs 15-20 jump in retail prices.

 Industry experts feel north Bengal has strategic importance given its proximity to the northeastern states.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Flotation on Genpact menu

 SOHINI MOOKHERJEA

 Calcutta, Oct. 17: ITeS company Genpact, formerly GE Capital International Services, is exploring the possibility of an initial public offering (IPO) to fund its aggressive growth plans that envisages doubling of its workforce in India, at 17,000 now, by 2010.

 Though the company hopes to arrive at the price band for the offer quickly, by the end of the year, the issue will probably take more time to hit the market as the three principal shareholders of the company, General Atlantic, Oak Hill Capital Partners and General Electric, which holds one-third of the equity in Genpact, are expected to hold extensive parleys on the modalities of the IPO.

 Having opened outfits in the Philippines and Poland, each centre having a headcount of 200, Genpact is scouting for opportunities in South Africa and keen to expand further in East Europe. 

 Shantanu Ghosh, senior vice-president and business leader, finance and accounting, Genpact, said that the company was keen on expanding inorganically through partnerships and acquisitions in the financial domain. He said the size of the deals could be in the range of $25 million to $50 million, though the company has not arrived at a specific band in this regard. 

 Genpacts growth through the inorganic route is around 25 per cent to 28 per cent. The financial services and insurance verticals contributes almost 40 per cent to 45 per cent to Genpacts revenues. 

 Ghosh said Calcutta would emerge as one of the key centres for Genpact with the company investing Rs 15 crore to set up a 80,000 sq ft facility at the DLF IT park in Rajarhat.

 He said the number of employees in the city will go up to 5,000 in 2010 from 400. The company has a global workforce of 25,000. Genpact, which invests $8 million annually in employee training, is also the first ITeS company to target tier II cities by opening a centre in Jaipur.

 Genpact CEO Pramod Bhasin has targeted $1 billion revenues by the end of 2008. The company is expected to cross the $500-million mark this year; and of the remaining $500 million, $150 million will be through the inorganic route.

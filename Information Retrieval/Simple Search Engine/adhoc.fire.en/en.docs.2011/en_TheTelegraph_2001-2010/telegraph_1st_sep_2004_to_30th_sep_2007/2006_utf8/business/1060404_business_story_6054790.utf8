 Tea auction gets back flavour

 SOHINI MOOKHERJEA

 Calcutta, April 3: Tea is back in favour. At least, that?s what the demand and high prices at the auctions say ? the limited quantity of 8,500 packages sold like hot cake at rates higher by Rs 10-15 per kg across all varieties compared with last year, which had 6,100 packages on sale.

 In March, crops were down in lower Assam, Cachar, Dooars and almost drought like conditions prevailed in Darjeeling, which had resulted in a supply crunch. 

 Most of the CTC tea was sourced from Dooars in north Bengal. Plainer Dooars, small brokens and fannings fetched between Rs 65 and Rs 80 per kg. Medium ones fared better ? between Rs 85 and Rs 95, while the good Dooars variety fetched between Rs 95 and Rs 110 per kg. 

 The Dooars CTC was in high demand from local traders.

 The ailing tea industry had expected to cash in on the drought-like conditions in Kenya, which is the world?s largest exporter of CTC tea. The industry had hoped for more than a price correction this year. 

 The Kenyan tea production for January 2006 recorded a 47 per cent drop from 34.1 million kg in January 2005 to 17.9 million kg in January 2006, while the production for February 2006 registered a decline of 54 per cent over last year. 

 The exports for the combined period between January and February also went down by 3.3 million kg compared with the corresponding period last year.

 In India, Upper Assam received relatively better showers than the lower half and small quantities of Assam tea was also on offer. 

 According to J Thomas amp; Co?s figures, the price for the good Assam brokens were between Rs 100 and Rs 115, with the best ones fetching up to Rs 130 per kg. Good Assam fannings sold between Rs 95 and Rs 100 per kg, with the best ones fetching up to Rs 117.

 The buying pattern constituted support for Assam from western India dealers and some support from local counterparts as well.

 There was a very limited quantity of orthodox tea. India is not a traditional producer of orthodox tea with 80 to 90 million kg of annual produce.

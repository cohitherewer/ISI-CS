 A-I to take alliance flight

 Mumbai, June 30: Prodded by the increasing dominance of airline alliances in international civil aviation, Air-India has started exploring options of entering into one of the three existing airline alliance networks.

 The final call will be taken after the merger with Indian (earlier Indian Airlines), but it has more or less been decided that there is a need to become a part of some airline alliance to remain competitive. The entire process, however, will take from six months to one year to fructify, said a senior Air-India executive.

 As part of the process, Air-India is currently holding talks and workshops with the largest alliance formations, Star Alliance.

 The dialogue is in an exploratory stage and we are trying to find out what each has to offer the other. Negotiations have not begun yet though. We will also talk to the other alliances: OneWorld and Skyteam, before taking a final decision, said the source.

 The international alliance networks command between them over 80 per cent of global airline capacity.

 It certainly will be a win-win situation, both for our passengers, as well as for the company, said the official who is also a board member. 

 To start with, international passengers of the new entity formed after the merger of Air-India and Indian will get the advantage of seamless travel facilities besides better frequent-flyer services.

 The airline also gets to enjoy a higher passenger load factor. Passenger load factors of Star Alliance members, such as United, Air France, Delta, Singapore Airlines, American Airlines and Lufthansa range from 74-79 per cent, while those of non-alliance airlines, such as Southwest, Air-India, China Eastern and Saudi Arabian vary between 62 and 69 per cent. 

 In such a situation, A-I and Indian need to jointly bid for global partnership. Otherwise they will face isolation and marginalisation in the global market. Individually, the two bring negligible value to any global alliance, but together with integrated domestic and international networks, they become attractive. So we will be able to negotiate from a position of power after the merger, said another senior A-I official involved in the talks with Star Alliance.

 Methane hunt gets delayed

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Aug. 31: The government today deferred a decision on the award of 10 coal-bed methane (CBM) blocks, including the two that were disputed by the Anil Ambani group. 

 The government has sent back for review the report of the empowered committee of secretaries, which had probed the Anil Ambani groups allegation that it had been discriminated against in the current CBM round.

 The cabinet committee on economic affairs today decided that the report on Reliance Natural Resources (RNRL) needs to be seen again by a new empowered committee of secretaries.

 A senior government official said, The earlier empowered committee of secretaries had only one secretary-level officer. It will now be ensured that the new committee meeting is attended by three secretary-level officers.

 The Anil Ambani group had contested the evaluation of two of the three coal-bed methane blocks being recommended for Australias Arrow Energy. 

 The consortium led by the Anil Ambani group is a clear winner in four blocks, while British energy major BP Exploration is likely to get one block.

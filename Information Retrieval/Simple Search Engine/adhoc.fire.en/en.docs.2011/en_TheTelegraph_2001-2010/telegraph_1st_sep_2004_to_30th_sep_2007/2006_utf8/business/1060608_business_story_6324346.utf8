 Reliance Energy on fire

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 BIG BET

 Mumbai, June 7: Reliance Energy Ltd (REL) is getting ready to pour massive sums of money into the power sector. It will invest more than Rs 60,000 crore in generation alone even as the plan is to delve deeper into transmission and distribution as well.

 The ambitious plans include a foray into nuclear power generation.

 Anil Ambani told shareholders at the annual general meeting that REL would pursue generation projects aggregating to a total capacity of 16,000 mw with a projected investment outlay of Rs 60,000 crore ($13.3 billion) in gas-based, hydro and thermal power projects.

 Last year, Ambani had told shareholders that REL was keenly following developments regarding nuclear power generation. However, in the 77th AGM, he had more details.

 Reliance Energy has constituted an in-house core team. This team has been exploring the possibility of our entry into nuclear power generation. Our company has a wealth of experience in this newly emerging area of opportunity by virtue of its ongoing role as an EPC contractor for a number of nuclear power plants, and is ready to graduate to equity participation. We are aiming ? in our first endeavour in this sector ? to develop approximately 2,000 mw of nuclear power capacity, he added.

 Observers, however, say that the investment figures could be much more if RELs other plans took off. 

 Ambani said Reliance Energy will participate in the bid process for ultra mega power projects being developed by building 4,000 mw or more capacity at one location.

 The ultra mega power projects will entail investments to the tune of Rs 15,000 crore each. REL has already submitted requests for qualification for the ultra mega power projects that include the Sasan project in Madhya Pradesh and the Mundra coastal Gujarat project. It has also field expressions of interest for the Girye project in Maharashtra and Tadri ultra mega power project in Karnataka.

 Regarding the proposed 7,480-mw (5,600 mw in Phase-I) Dhirubhai Ambani Energy City (DAEC) at Dadri in UP, Ambani said that land for the project has been acquired and transferred to Reliance Energy Generation Ltd (REGL). Further, the international competitive bidding process to select the EPC contractor for the project has already been initiated.

 Further, the 4,000-mw power plant in Maharashtra is now in an advanced stage of development. The international competitive bidding process to select the EPC contractor for the project has also been initiated.

 On the hydel front, Reliance Energy is exploring the possibility of setting up hydel projects in Himachal Pradesh, another hydro resources rich state in the country and it has submitted bids for four large projects in March this year. 

 Company name 

 The Anil Ambani groups company, Reliance Communication Ventures Ltd, has changed its name to Reliance Communications Ltd following issue of new certificate by registrar of companies.

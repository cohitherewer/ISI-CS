 Raha reprise in extension bar on Gails Banerjee

 Banerjee: Exit path

 New Delhi, Aug 27: Gail (India) chairman and managing director Proshanto Banerjee has gone the Subir Raha way with the government refusing him an extension as his five-year term ended yesterday.

 Banerjee, who still had 14 months before retiring at 60, was expecting an extension.

 S.P. Rao, director (projects), has been made the acting CMD.

 Sources said Banerjee, like former ONGC chairman Raha, was perceived as an appointee of the Vajpayee government, and the political factor weighed heavily in both the cases.

 While Raha was known for his spats with the then petroleum minister, Mani Shankar Aiyar, Banerjee was not as high profile. But both were former Indian Oil men who had moved on to head different companies. 

 The petroleum ministry is believed to have prepared a strong case to deny Banerjee his extension. It has put on record that Banerjees performance leaves a lot to be desired. 

 Sources said Banerjee was denied an extension because of his style of functioning and alleged victimisation of officials, including a director of the company board. 

 His relationship with other organisations has come in the way of the companys growth, they added.

 While Gail has been performing well with profits rising during Banerjees tenure, the ministry has denied him this credit. 

 It has put on record that the profitability of the company is primarily due to its monopoly status in gas transmission and availability of cheap gas from ONGCs fields for its petrochemical and LPG plant.

 Banerjee had also been at the receiving end of the SC/ST commission, which indicted him for victimisation and harassment of Rao. He was accused of not forwarding Raos application for the post of MD of Petronet LNG.

 The delay in implementing the Dahej-Vijaipur pipeline project, where the government had to issue a presidential directive to implement the project, is also reported to have gone against him.

 Gail, however, expanded its pipeline network during Banerjees tenure and he had chalked out a plan to lay the national gas grid. 

 He opposed the ministry on allowing Reliance Industries to set up its own pipeline network and had said laying of inter-state pipelines should be left solely to Gail. 

 Banerjee had diversified Gails business and the company acquired a stake in the giant gas fields of Myanamar and also struck oil in Gujarat as part of a consortium.

 New Delhi, March 31: Finance minister P. Chidambaram today indicated that interest rates will remain stable for now and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) would take appropriate measures to maintain liquidity in the system.

 These (hardening or softening of interest rates) are value judgements. All I can say is that the rates will remain attractive for both depositors and borrowers, Chidambaram told newspersons on the sidelines of a Punjab National Bank (PNB) event.

 The rise in credit offtake reflects the growing demand in the economy and no one in the government can say rising need for credit is bad, he said.

 The supply side of the economy has to be addressed through enhanced credit and I am confident the RBI will address the issue, he said.

 The RBI, Chidambaram said, has taken the first step towards addressing the problem of liquidity by allowing banks to raise NRI deposit rates by 25 basis points (0.25 per cent) and RBI governor YV Reddy is the right person to tackle the issue of credit shortage.

 Earlier this week, the RBI had permitted banks to offer London inter-bank offered rates (Libor) on dollar deposits of NRIs, often referred to as foreign currency non-resident (FCNR) deposits.

 In a meeting with the finance minister last week, bankers had suggested various options to infuse liquidity into the system, including a cut in the cash reserve ratio from the existing 5 per cent. 

 Another option was to release the excess funds maintained under the statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) over and above the mandatory 25 per cent. At present, at an aggregate level, banks are maintaining an SLR of 31 per cent. The extra 6 per cent would release funds worth Rs 60,000 crore.

 The option of releasing funds from the RBIs market stabilisation scheme (MSS), which has a corpus of Rs 30,000 crore, was also discussed in the meeting. Banks have also suggested measures to make NRI deposits more attractive.

 Chidambaram today said a balance has to be struck between the demands of depositors and borrowers.

 Deposits have grown at the rate of 16 per cent this fiscal so far, while lending growth has been 30 per cent. He said this gap has to be covered with more investment so that a high growth rate continues.

 Chidambaram also asked banks to prepare for consolidation to reap the economies of sale. Why is the prospect of consolidation creating so much fear? If consolidation takes place, PNB will give SBI a run for its money, said the finance minister.

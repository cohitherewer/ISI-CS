 Blow to GE Ship plan

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, June 2: The demerger of the offshore services business of Great Eastern Shipping Co Ltd (GE Shipping) will be delayed. 

 This is because one of its clients has sought a performance guarantee that the company would be responsible for the services rendered by its demerged unit, a condition not accepted by GE Shipping.

 In September 2005, GE Shipping approved the de-merger of its offshore services business into a separate firm, Great Offshore Ltd. 

 The offshore business consists of drilling services, marine logistics, marine construction and terminal services. The demerger, effective from April 1, 2005, was initially supposed to be completed in a span of eight months.

 However, in what could be a major spanner in the works for the Sheths, a contractual party, meaning a customer, has sought a guarantee that the company would be responsible for the services of the demerged entity and for the execution and performance of the contract with that party. GE Shipping has not accepted this condition.

 Apart from seeking approval from the high court and shareholders for the demerger, firms also have to obtain a go-ahead from all contractual parties. As one customer has not approved, the merger has been delayed.

 Confirming the delay, GE Shipping informed stock exchanges that Bombay High Court has approved the scheme of arrangement between the company and Great Offshore Ltd.

 The scheme is to come into force only upon receipt of approvals of any contracting counter-party under a material contract, it said.

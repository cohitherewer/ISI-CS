 Top guns to act in ONGC Asom show

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Many suitors

 New Delhi, March 26: Sinopec of China, Kellogg Brown amp; Root of Singapore, Proteus and Leighton, both of Australia, Penang of Malaysia and Specialist Services of Dubai are among the 26 companies vying for ONGCs Rs 4,000-crore Asom oilfields renewal project. 

 The Indian companies in the race include ABB, Larsen amp; Toubro, Engineers India Ltd, Bhel, Gammon, Nicco, Honeywell, Essar Oil, Punj Lloyd and Afcons. 

 In the roadshow organised by ONGC, some eight foreign heavy engineering firms said they were interested in participating in the global bidding to be held in May. ONGCs onshore director A.K. Hazarika and technical director U.N. Bose hosted the roadshow. 

 According to ONGC officials, some companies may join hands to bid for this turnkey construction contract valued at around Rs 2,500 crore. ONGC will float a tender of Rs 2,000 crore for equipment and Rs 500 crore for laying a 1250-km pipeline. 

 Apart from the Rs 2,500-crore facility renewal plan, the Asom project also envisages a Rs 1,584-crore drilling programme, which takes the total investment of ONGC to more than Rs 4,000 crore to augment the production from its fields in the state.

 ONGC expects major vendors to participate in the contract on a turnkey basis. The objective of the company is to increase oil production in Asom from 1.4 million tonnes (mt) to 3 mt in four years. The increased production is expected to improve ONGCs contribution to the exchequer of Asom, through higher royalty and sales tax earnings, from Rs 360 crore per year to more than Rs 720 crore.

 ONGC presented an overview of its Asom assets, the details of equipment and pipelines, meteorological and geographic data, including the connectivity to the various installations.

 Salient features of the bid evaluation criteria and contract conditions, such as experience, financial criteria and payments were also presented.

 A senior company official said for the first time ONGC is using functional specifications of international standards for tendering. Under the tender system, ONGC will define the performance characteristics and the vendors are free to propose their designs to meet those characteristics.

 Modular pre-fabricated assemblies will be used while revamping the installations.

 Of the 786 million tonnes of oil reserves that have been cumulatively accreted by ONGC in its Asom fields till March 31, 2005, about 30 per cent is recoverable which works out 236 million tonnes.

 RIL cuts petrol, diesel prices by a rupee

 OUR BUREAU

 Mumbai, Oct. 1: Reliance Industries Ltd has slashed the retail prices of petrol and diesel by Re 1 per litre. Despite the cuts, its retail pumps will still be selling the products at higher prices than state-owned pumps.

 The price cut took effect at 6 a.m. today, the company said in a statement issued late on Saturday. RILs fuels will now retail at Rs 1.50 per litre higher than the nearest PSU outlet compared with Rs 2.50 per litre differential earlier, the company said.

 Reliance, which has 1,300 outlets, said the price cuts were being made as international crude prices had turned soft.

 International crude prices have softened to some extent recently. Therefore, RIL has decided to pass on the benefit to customers although it continues to suffer its under-recoveries, the company said in its statement. 

 US light crude soared to a record $78.40 a barrel in July, but traded below $63 a barrel on Friday. Reliance broke ranks with the industry in May and unilaterally raised petrol and diesel prices without waiting for a direction from the government.

 This led to a price differential that has remained till date and led to a sharp fall in sales from its petrol pumps.

 RILs market share plummeted to less than 2 per cent early this month from a high of 16 per cent in January.

 In June, when the government finally bit the bullet and permitted state-owned oil companies to raise petrol prices by 9.2 per cent and diesel prices by 6.6 per cent, Reliance followed suit. 

 The cut in petrol and diesel prices will bring partial respite to Reliances dealers who have been shutting shop due to unviable operations and reducing fuel sales at their pumps. 

 Reliance said it was forced to raise prices unilaterally because the government had refused to compensate it for the under-recoveries through the issue of oil bonds a dispensation that had been extended to the state-owned oil firms. 

 State-owned oil companies have also started to clamour for another rise in prices but the sudden slump in crude prices has dented their argument. With Reliance slashing its prices, their case for a price revision becomes a lot weaker.

 Reliance said it would continue to press its case for compensation by the government in the form of oil bonds. The demand was first raised last November but the government had refused to concede it.

 Court spanner in BSNL plan

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 2: Delhi High Court today issued an order restraining Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) from awarding a contract for its Rs 20,000-crore GSM network expansion project till November 16 the next date of hearing for the Motorola petition.

 Motorola, which was disqualified by BSNL on technical grounds from participating in the bidding process, had challenged BSNLs decision in the high court last month. 

 The court adjourned the matter till November 16 after Motorolas counsel A.S. Chandiok sought some time to go through the reply filed by BSNL.

 BSNL in its reply has contended that Motorola was not eligible as it failed to satisfy the techno-commercial aspect of the tender. Citing the evaluation report of Committee for Evaluation of Tender (CET), BSNL said: It is submitted that the petitioner failed to even meet the eligibility criteria laid down in the tender document.

 BSNL said Motorola also failed on financial parameters. According to bidding conditions, a company must be a profit-earning entity in the last two years but Motorola did not meet this criterion as it suffered a loss of almost Rs 37 crore in 2004-05.

 Swedish company Ericsson had emerged as the lowest bidder followed by Nokia of Finland.

 A BSNL official said the firm was free to process the order but could not formally award it to shortlisted winners Ericsson and Nokia until the date of the next hearing.

 The petition filed by Motorola, challenging BSNLs decision, was heard by a bench comprising acting Chief Justice Vijender Jain and Justice Kailash Gambhir. Motorola had approached the high court seeking further clarification and transparency in the bidding process.

 BSNL, on its part, has issued a statement, in which its director of finance, S.D. Saxena, said the company respects the directive of Delhi High Court but since the matter is subjudice, it cannot comment further.

 Last month, BSNL had opened the financial bids for the expansion of its GSM network by adding over 45 million lines over a period of three years at an estimated cost of about Rs 20,000 crore.

 If selected, Ericsson would supply 60 per cent of the line expansion project. Finnish firm Nokia which emerged as the second-lowest bidder would provide the remaining 40 per cent.

 According to sources, Ericsson had quoted a price of about $107 per line while Nokia had asked for $177.

 Jessop back on dividend track

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 12: Jessop amp; Co Ltd (JCL), the 218-year-old engineering firm now owned by the Ruia Group, has announced a dividend after a gap of three decades.

 The board today recommended a dividend of 8 per cent, which is subject to shareholders approval.

 The company has doubled its net profit to Rs 9.98 crore in 2005-06, from Rs 4.82 crore in 2004-05. Turnover, however, stood at Rs 78.76 crore, compared with Rs 77.95 crore last year.

 Jessop amp; Co was owned by the Centre before it was divested to Ruia in August 2003.

 Commenting on the development, chairman Pawan K. Ruia said, Its quintessentially a reflection of better cost control and effective outsourcing. We remain committed to generate more value for every stakeholder of JCL, be it employees, the government or shareholders.

 With an order book position of Rs 130 crore, the future looks brighter, he added. 

 The structurals division, which makes cranes, gates and wagons, put up an impressive performance this year, followed by the EMU division.

 Jessop was brought under the fold of public sector after Independence, but it suffered heavy losses in the first half of the nineties and came under the purview of the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR) in 1995. 

 In 2004-05 the company was back in black showing a net profit after a gap of 15 years. 

 On April 28, BIFR passed an order discharging JCL from its purview following a capital restructuring of the company, which made its net worth positive.

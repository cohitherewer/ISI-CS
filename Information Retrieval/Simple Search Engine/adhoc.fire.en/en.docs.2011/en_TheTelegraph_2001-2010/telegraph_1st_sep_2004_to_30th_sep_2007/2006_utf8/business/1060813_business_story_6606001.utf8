 Trio in pact to steal Toyota thunder

 New direction

 Traverse City, Michigan, Aug. 12 (Reuters): A research alliance consisting of General Motors, BMW and DaimlerChrysler plans to invest over $1 billion (530 million) in the development of a new hybrid transmission and related systems that backers say will leapfrog the market-leading technology now offered by Toyota Motor Corp. 

 The three automakers have about 500 engineers who have been working for the last 18 months on the joint development of the next-generation hybrid engine technology, which combines a battery-powered electric motor with a conventional gasoline combustion engine, company representatives said on Friday on the sidelines of an industry trade meeting.

 The so-called dual-mode hybrid technology that has been under development by the consortium includes an onboard fuel-optimisation computer that determines when and at what speed the two motors will be used for power and how the on-board battery will be recharged.

 Development of the transmission the core of the project is expected to cost about $300 million for the partners, said Andreas Truckenbrodt, executive director of DaimlerChryslers hybrid programmes. The remainder of the investment represents the cost of integrating the new hybrid system with other vehicle components, he said. 

 Whats often forgotten about the hybrid technology is that you have to put it into the car, Truckenbrodt told reporters. 

 The hybrid engine will be made available in two rear-wheel drive configurations or a front-wheel drive system, said representatives of the joint development project based in the Detroit suburb of Troy, Michigan.

 Depending on the requirements of the market and the automaker, the system can be adjusted to provide either improved value or high performance, they said. 

 We believe that our two-mode hybrid is the best of the hybrid systems, Truckenbrodt said. I think all three of us can say its truly amazing what you can get out of if you bring wild, dedicated engineers together.

 DaimlerChrysler plans to use the new hybrid system in its 2008 Dodge Durango sport utility vehicle. 

 GM will use the hybrid in versions of the Tahoe and Yukon SUVs it plans to make available at the end of 2007. 

 BMW has not committed to a timetable for using the new engine system, but has said that it will make vehicles available with the upcoming hybrid engine system over the next three to five years.

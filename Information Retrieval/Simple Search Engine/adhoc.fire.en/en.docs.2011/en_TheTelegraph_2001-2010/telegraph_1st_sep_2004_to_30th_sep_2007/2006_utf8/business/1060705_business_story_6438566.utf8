 Wake-up call for tax evaders

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 4: Beware, big brother is watching! Thats finance minister P. Chidambarams message to tax evaders. 

 People who make high-value purchases and yet do not file returns or file returns showing too low an income will have the tax department knocking on their doors soon. 

 Chidambaram today asked the income tax department to pursue every single person whose names are thrown up by the annual information returns (AIRs). 

 AIRs are information on high-value transactions made in the real estate market, stocks, credit cards and in banks, which have to be mandatorily reported by the authorities controlling these institutions. 

 Sooner or later they will be reached. My advice to all those who have made large transactions like buying property over Rs 30 lakh, investing over Rs 2 lakh in mutual funds in a year, or made credit card payments exceeding Rs 2 lakh annually, please file tax returns before the last date of July 31, Chidambaram said.

 The minister, who was talking to reporters after a meeting with income tax chief commissioners, said, These are not poor, lower middle-class or salaried people. These are high networth people. If not today, in three, six or nine months, income tax people will reach the parties.

 The government already has records of some 17.52 lakh high-value transactions. Interestingly, of some 6.6 lakh people who have made these transactions, a mere 1.84 lakh people have quoted their Permanent Account Numbers (PAN). This has lead to suspicions that many of these transactions may have involved black money. 

 The government will also tighten the issuance procedure for PAN cards to eliminate duplicate cards by the end of this fiscal. At present, it is estimated that some 23 lakh duplicate cards have been issued. However, Chidambaram said many of them are not bogus but merely duplicate cards. The government will soon be asking people to voluntarily surrender duplicate PAN cards, he said. Thereafter, a unique PAN card similar to a passport will be issued.

 Chidambaram said it is in the interest of these over six lakh people to file their returns before the due date of July 31. We have no interest in harassing anyone. We simply want people to become more tax compliant, he said.

 I think there are a lot of rich people who do not pay the taxes they should be paying ... The salaried class are obviously paying. But I think a large number of individuals who ought to be paying the correct taxes, are not complying, he added.

 The government will bring a new comprehensive income tax law before Parliament as the present law is too voluminous with repetitions and contradictions. 

 We have extended the time to draft the new bill to July 15. It will be surely drafted by this month end, he said. The new bill is aimed at making the tax law more user-friendly. It will also discard the current concept of previous year and assessment year and instead ask for returns for the current year.

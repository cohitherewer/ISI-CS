 Sales tax on telecom services ruled out

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 2: The Supreme Court today held that state governments could not levy sales tax on services provided by telecom operators to consumers.

 A bench comprising justices Ruma Pal, A.R. Lakshmanan and Dalveer Bhandari said a sales tax can be imposed only when there is a transfer of rights to use goods from one party to another.

 The court said services in the telecom sector cannot be equated with transfer of goods as goods do not include electromagnetic waves or signals.

 Though sales tax could not be levied on re-charge coupons according to the import of the judgment, the question of imposing sales tax on sim cards sold at a price has been left open to be decided by authorities in the light of this judgment. 

 In telecom services, a transfer of rights to use goods can be there only in handsets, the court said.

 The ruling came on a batch of petitions filed by telecom service providers who had challenged the imposition of a sales tax by several states. Several high courts had given conflicting verdicts on the issue. 

 The verdict has come as a relief to service providers, including Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd, which had been long contesting the levy.

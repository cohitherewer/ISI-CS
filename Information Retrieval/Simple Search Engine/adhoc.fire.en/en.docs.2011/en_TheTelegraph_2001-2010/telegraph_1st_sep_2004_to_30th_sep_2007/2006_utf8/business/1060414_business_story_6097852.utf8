 Stock prop for postal money

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 On the move

 New Delhi, April 13: The government has allowed the department of posts to invest up to Rs 10,000 crore from its life insurance schemes in equities, debt market and government bonds.

 The finance ministry has allowed the department to keep these funds of about Rs 10,000 crore in special deposits (government bonds), saying it must find outside investment opportunities, including those in stock markets, said U. Srinivasa Raghavan, secretary of the department of posts.

 Till now, the funds were part of the special deposit scheme run by the ministry of finance, which gives an annual return of 8 per cent.

 The finance ministry has made it clear that the special deposit rates on postal life insurance (PLI) and rural postal life insurance (RPLI) schemes will not be available after September 30.

 The department operates 12 schemes under PLI and RPLI, including two full endowment plans.

 It may, however, take a while before the funds can flow into stock markets. Moreover, the entire amount will not be invested in equities.

 Raghavan said the department has appointed global consultant AF Fergusson to look into investment options for the funds.

 We will take a decision only after careful examination and then adopt a strategy, which will have enough safeguards to ensure safety of investors funds, he said.

 This would also entail setting up an asset management company (AMC) on the lines of mutual funds to invest these funds prudently. The AMC may have to adhere to the norms mandated by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA).

 I am seeking a level-playing field for postal life insurance so that ordinary people in urban areas are allowed to opt for these schemes. Our premium is lower and bonus is higher, said Raghavan.

 Postal life insurance, which was started in 1884 as a welfare measure for the employees of the posts and telegraph department, is open to employees of government and public sector firms and local bodies.

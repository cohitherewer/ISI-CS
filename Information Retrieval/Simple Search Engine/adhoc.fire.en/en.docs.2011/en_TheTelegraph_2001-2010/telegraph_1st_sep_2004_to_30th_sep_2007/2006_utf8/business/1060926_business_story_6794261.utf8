 Visa group to ink deal for Orissa power plant

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 25: The Calcutta-based Visa group the owner of Visa Steel is now foraying into power.

 It has set up a special purpose vehicle, Visa Power Ltd, for the power venture.

 The new company will sign an MoU with the Orissa government tomorrow for this purpose.

 It proposes to set up a 1,000-megawatt power plant in Orissa where domestic coal will be used. It will have 4 x 250 mw units.

 The agreement for the plant will be signed between Orissa power secretary Asit Tripathy and Vikas Agarwal, managing director of Visa Power Limited.

 Incidentally, Visa Power is also planning to build another 1,000-mw power plant based on imported coal in Gujrat.

 The power project in Orissa will be located either at Choudwar in Cuttack district or at Bajrakot in Angul. 

 The decision to set up a plant in Orissa was based on the coal reserves and abundant water supply in the state. 

 Land acquisition for the project will start very soon and construction work is expected to commence from mid- 2007. 

 The total cost of the project would be approximately Rs 4,000 crore. Equity for the first phase of 500 mw will be brought in from VISA International Limited and through FDI from Visa Minmetal AG. 

 Twenty five per cent of the power generated will be sold to Gridco at the price notified by OERC.

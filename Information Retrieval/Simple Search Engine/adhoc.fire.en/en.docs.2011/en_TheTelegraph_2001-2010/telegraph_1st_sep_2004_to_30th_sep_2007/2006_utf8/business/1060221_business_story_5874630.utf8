 Top German drug firm pops buyback pill

 Positive outlook

 Berlin, Feb. 20 (Reuters): Germanys Schering AG announced its biggest share buyback programme to date and raised its profitability targets after a 30 per cent rise in quarterly earnings, driven by strong sales of key drugs.

 Schering, the worlds top maker of oral contraceptives, said on Monday it would buy back up to 500 million euros ($597 million) worth of its own shares by September. Since 1998, it has bought back shares worth 744 million euros.

 Schering stock rose 4 per cent to 58.81 euros, the top gainer on the DAX bluechip index.

 The Berlin-based firm is now pursuing a 20 per cent operating margin by 2008, up from 17.5 per cent last year, and higher than its target of 18 per cent by the end of 2006.

 Fourth-quarter operating profit was 218 million euros.

 The buyback is certainly a positive for the shares, and the profitability target of 20 per cent is not bad given that Scherings product portfolio does not have many new drugs with high margins, said Equinet analyst Martin Possienke.

 Chief executive Hubertus Erlen said the company had cash of 1.2 billion euros, and even after paying for the buybacks would have enough for acquisitions thanks to strong cashflow in 2006.

 Just in case of bigger M amp;A, it is easy for us to raise additional capital if we have a target in hand, he said, adding that Schering continued to screen possible acquisition targets.

 Sales rose 11 per cent to 1.41 billion euros, compared with 1.36 billion euros in the poll.

 Schering said it planned to buy all the property and equipment used by its US partner Chiron for making Scherings top product, multiple sclerosis treatment Betaseron.

 Currently Schering pays royalties and costs to Chiron for producing Betaseron equal to 22.5 per cent of US sales. The payments were $180 million in 2005. The renegotiation arose after Novartis said last year it would buy Chiron.

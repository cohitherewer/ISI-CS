 Robust results spur sensex

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Jan. 20: A string of better-than-expected quarterly numbers, hectic buying in bluechip stocks and a block deal in Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) ensured that the markets end the week on a positive note. Intra-day trades saw the benchmark BSE index gaining 116 points, but at the close of the day, the sensex added 71 points to the double century scored yesterday. 

 Brokers said market participants were enthused by robust numbers declared by big companies like ICICI Bank, Maruti Udyog and Indian Hotels. Their third-quarter performances showed that the India story is still going strong, said an analyst from a foreign mutual fund.

 In addition to the report cards from these companies, intense buying in heavyweights such as ONGC and HDFC contributed to the upswing. 

 Brokers said a massive block deal worth Rs 1000 crore was witnessed in the HDFC counter. Close to 84 lakh shares of the countrys largest housing finance company were transacted at an average price of around Rs 1213 apiece and the buyer is CLSA, they added.

 Investors were also enthused by the slow but steady return of foreign institutional investors (FIIs). With Wednesdays inflow of Rs 2.30 crore, FIIs have made a net investment of Rs 1,951 crore in the current month.

 The sensex opened the day firm at 9493.39 points against yesterdays close of 9449.84 and zoomed to an intra-day high of 9556.19. Later, it softened and finished at 9520.96, registering a gain of 0.75 per cent over its last close.

 ICICI Bank shares reacted positively to the 24 per cent rise in net profit for the third quarter ended December 31 and the Maruti scrip surged more than 7 per cent after it announced a 40 per cent rise in profits. Though Satyam Computers also announced a better-than-expected result, it saw profit booking along with other leading infotech companies. 

 Among other scrips, ABB, Bhel, Siemens, Tata Motors, Hero Honda and ITC gained sharply on heavy buying. The volume of business was remarkably high at Rs 4,205.34 crore compared with Rs 3629.00 crore yesterday.

 Siemens India shares were star performers, rising to a new peak of Rs 4146.55 before winding up at Rs 4102.80, revealing a gain of Rs 395.30.

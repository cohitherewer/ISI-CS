 Tata firms in captive power deal 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Nov. 22: Tata Power Company has signed a joint venture agreement with Tata Steel to set up captive power plants in Chhattisgarh, Orissa and Jharkhand.

 The joint venture is aimed at meeting the power and steam requirements to support the expansion plans of Tata Steel in the three states, Tata Power has informed the Bombay Stock Exchange. 

 Tata Power will hold 74 per cent equity in the venture and Tata Steel will own the rest.

 Tata Steel has lined up greenfield projects in Orissa, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Bangladesh and Iran. It is close to starting work on its first greenfield project at Kalinganagar in Orissa.

 Under this agreement, Tata Steel will consume power generated from these plants, meeting the requirements of captive plant norms stipulated by the Centres captive power plant policy. 

 As part of this initiative, a 120-mw captive plant will be set up for Tata Steel in Jamshedpur. Blast furnace and coke oven gases, which are waste gases from the steel making process, will be used in the plant. The project period is expected to be 26 months and is scheduled for commissioning by July 2008. 

 We are delighted to support the expansion plans of Tata Steel in Chhattisgarh, Orissa and Jharkhand. Our long-standing partnership at Jojobera, Jamshedpur has set various industry benchmarks in project execution and implementation. This joint initiative will help accelerate Tata Powers growth plans and strengthen its national footprint, Prasad Menon, MD of Tata Power said. 

 In an address to shareholders recently, Tata Steel chairman Ratan Tata said over the next 10 years, the company has committed to attain a global scale with output exceeding 30 million tonnes and a strong regional presence.

 Ranbaxy to counter probate punch

 Malvinder: Battle of wills

 New Delhi, May 23: Brothers Malvinder and Shivinder Singh, the owners of Ranbaxy Laboratories and Fortis, respectively, will challenge the probate filed by Analjit Singh, the major beneficiary of Bhai Mohan Singh?s will.

 Bhai Mohan Singh, the founder of the Ranbaxy group, died on March 27 this year. Under the terms of a will he drew up last August, he had bequeathed all his properties, including four palatial bungalows in Delhi?s tony Aurangazeb Road to his youngest son Analjit Singh, who runs the Max India group.

 Malvinder and Shivinder are the children of Bhai Mohan?s estranged eldest son Parvinder Singh who died in July 1999. 

 On Monday, Analjit Singh filed for probate of his father?s will in the Tis Hazari court in Delhi through Delhi-based law firm KR Chawla amp; Company.

 Sources close to Malvinder and Shivinder said, ?A notice has been issued by the Tis Hazari district courts. We will definitely challenge the petition.?

 They contended that when the case comes up for hearing on July 27, they will contest the will on two grounds: they intend to raise questions about the state of Bhai Mohan?s mental health when he framed the will in August 2005, and the undue influence Analjit Singh exercised over him.

 Bhai Mohan Singh lived with his youngest son in his last years.

 The most interesting aspect of this battle over Bhai Mohan?s last testament, which mirrors the spat between the Birlas and the Lodhas for the MP Birla estate, is a proviso that confers to Analjit the right to 25 lakh shares in Ranbaxy, which have been under litigation. Parvinder Singh had refused to register them in his father?s name, sparking a long legal battle with Bhai Mohan Singh.

 Bhai Mohan Singh had executed his last will on August 24, 2005 in the presence of Prem Sobti and Vipin Malik.

 While stating that the will dated August 24 was the last and final document of Bhai Mohan Singh, the petition said the executors were desirous of ?obtaining the probate in order to implement the last wishes of Bhai Mohan Singh?.

 Besides the properties on Aurangzeb Road, the will bequeathed to Analjit immovable properties in Chandigarh and Mumbai and shares of over 30 listed and unlisted companies.

 Meanwhile, Manjit Singh, the second son of Ranbaxy patriarch Bhai Mohan Singh, has said he too will lay claim to the properties of his parents.

 In the petition, Analjit Singh said his father had got the will registered at the sub registrar of Assurances III, New Delhi, on November 18, 2005 in the presence of Sandeep Budhiraja, who had also appended his signatures as an additional attesting witness.

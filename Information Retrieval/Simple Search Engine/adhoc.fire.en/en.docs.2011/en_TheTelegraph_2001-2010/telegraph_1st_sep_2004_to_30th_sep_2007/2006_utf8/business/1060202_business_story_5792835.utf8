 Mumbai, Feb. 1: TNT, the Dutch courier company, will invest close to 100 million euros in India over the next five years. 

 The company, which had so long been concentrating on international consignments from India, has recently commenced domestic services.

 Formally announcing its domestic foray, TNT said it would offer a gamut of ?first ever? services in the express segment. TNT also aims at becoming the leading integrated player in the Indian market by 2010. 

 This is expected to be attained by offering international and domestic services using an integrated air and road network. 

 As part of its expansion plan within the country, TNT has recently increased the number of offices from 17 to over 50. By the end of this year, the company plans to have more than 144 offices in the country. 

 TNT has also expanded its depot space from 80,000 sq ft to over 300,000 sq ft with a fleet of more than 1000 vehicles.

 Starting today, TNT India will offer air network solutions to customers. The road network services will commence by mid March 2006, as part of the company?s Phase II expansion plans.

 Commenting on the domestic foray, James McCormac, chief operating officer of TNTs Express division, said, ?India is a country we are all excited about. It has huge business potential and our expansion plan is clearly in line with our strategic intent to focus on and develop in emerging markets. We have been operating our international express services in India for the past 12 years. With this launch, we will be able to cater to a larger base of customers. Huge investments across manpower, infrastructure and IT have been made to ensure that the customer experiences the same international quality of service that has become the TNT hallmark.?

 According to TNT India managing director Abhik Mitra, surface transport has tremendous potential. 

 Mitra said its local network would offer an attractively priced, fast and reliable mode of service to its customers.

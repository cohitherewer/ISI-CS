 Q amp;A

 Missed the bus

 While any individual above 60 years can open a Senior Citizen Savings Scheme, persons who have taken a voluntary retirement can also join the scheme provided they are above 55 years and the account is opened within one month from receiving the VRS dues from their employer. But I have gathered from post office agents that now there is no restriction on VRS employees opening an SCSS account within one month from receiving the VRS dues. I was released on VRS in March 2003 and I am 56 years now. Can I join the SCSS?

 R. Singh, Calcutta 

 A person, who is below 60 years but about 55, can join the Senior Citizen Savings Scheme after taking a voluntary retirement. However, in this case, the account should be opened either with a post office or with a public sector bank within three months from taking the VRS. The time restriction has not been relaxed by any amendment, which means that you cant join the scheme now. 

 Limit to investment

 Is a deposit of Rs 1,00,000 in Public Provident Fund account allowed for income tax rebate during the financial year 2005-06? Does the amount in excess of Rs 70,000 in a PPF account earn an interest?

 Chakradhar Banerjee, Calcutta

 The maximum amount one can invest in a PPF account annually is Rs 70,000. Income tax rebate is allowed under section 80C on such investments. So, the question of investing more than Rs 70,000 in a PPF account does not arise.

 Accrued interest

 I want to know whether accrued interest on National Savings Certificates is exempt from total income within the limit of Rs 1 lakh under section 80C of the Income Tax Act?

 Pabitrananda Mukhopadhyay, Kalna

 Till March 2005, interest on NSC up to Rs 9,000 was tax deductible under section 80L. But, the section has been withdrawn from the current fiscal. However, investment in NSC up to a maximum Rs 1 lakh is allowed for tax deduction under section 80C. For non-matured accounts, the interest accrued on an NSC investment is considered as reinvestment and hence the interest income on NSC is tax deductible under section 80C now.

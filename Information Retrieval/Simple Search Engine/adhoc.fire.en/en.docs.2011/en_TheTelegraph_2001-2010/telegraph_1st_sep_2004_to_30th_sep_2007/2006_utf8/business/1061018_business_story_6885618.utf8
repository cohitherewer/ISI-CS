 LG profit plunges in third quarter

 Difficult times

 Seoul, Oct. 17 (AP): LG Electronics today said its third-quarter net profit has plunged as a hefty loss in its flat-panel unit erased profits from mobile phone sales.

 LG Electronics earned 22.7 billion won ($23.8 million) in the three months ended September 30, the company said in a statement, a drop of 85 per cent from the same period last year.

 LG Electronics is South Koreas largest home appliance manufacturer and the worlds fifth-largest mobile phone handset manufacturer by shipments.

 The result, however, was still better than expected. The average estimate of nine analysts surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires forecast that the company would post a net loss of seven billion won ($7.3 million).

 Sales during the quarter rose 0.6 per cent to 6.05 trillion won ($6.3 billion).

 Lg.Philips LCD Co, a joint venture between LG Electronics and Philips Electronics NV of the Netherlands, reported last week a third-quarter net loss of 321 billion won ($336 billion).

 Margins in LG Electronics handset division swung into the black, after posting losses the two preceding quarters, on robust sales of its trendy, higher-priced chocolate mobile phones.

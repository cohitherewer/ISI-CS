 Tatas bowl a Chinaman

 Mumbai, Aug. 7: The Tatas have a pointman in China: he is James Zhan who has been head hunted from Bechtel Enterprises.

 Zhan will oversee the conglomerates interest in the dragon nation with a new representative office being established in Beijing.

 The move is in line with the groups plan to establish a larger presence in China.

 Tata group officials were cagey when asked to comment on Zhans appointment. However, observers said it was not surprising considering the ambitious plans that the Tatas have in that nation.

 Overseas business contributes more than a quarter to the groups total turnover and the Tata group has been steadily enhancing its global footprint by enhancing the businesses of various group companies through the organic and inorganic routes.

 Companies like Tata Steel, Indian Hotels Company Ltd, Tata Chemicals, Tata Motors, Tata Tea and Tata Coffee have been in the news for their acquisitions in other countries.

 Just like other multinationals from developed nations, the Tatas have also been eyeing a greater presence in China over the past couple of years.

 Last year, the groups total business in the nation was around $200 million. Group companies such as Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Tata Steel, Tata International and Voltas have operations in China.

 But TCS is the one with the biggest stakeout in China. As the first Indian IT services company in China, TCS developed a strong presence in Hangzhou where it set up a delivery centre. In fact the importance given by China to TCS was evident last year when it was the only Indian software services company on the itinerary of Chinese Premier Wen Jiabaos visit to India.

 More recently, Tata Consultancy Services Asia-Pacific Pte, a subsidiary of TCS, announced the signing of a shareholder promoters agreement and other commercial documents with its three Chinese partners that include Beijing Zhongguancun Software Park Development Co, Uniware Co, and the Tianjin Huayuan Software Area Construction and Development Co to establish a software company.

 As part of the venture, TCS (China) will provide IT outsourcing services and solutions to the Chinese domestic market and the global market. Microsoft Corporation will also participate in the deal as a strategic investor. TCS will have the majority equity stake and management control of the company.

 The Chinese entity recently won an order from Huazia Bank to implement a core banking solution. While TCS has been steadily expanding its operations, it is learnt that other group companies like Tata Steel and Indian Hotels are eyeing a presence there.

 Last month, BusinessWeek listed two Tata companies TCS and Tata Motors among a group of 25 companies that it termed as the emerging giants who were threatening to change the global game.

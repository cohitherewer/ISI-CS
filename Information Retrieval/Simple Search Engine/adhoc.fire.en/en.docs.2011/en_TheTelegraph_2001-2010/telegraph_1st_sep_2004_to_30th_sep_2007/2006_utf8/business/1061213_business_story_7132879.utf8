 StanChart profit to rise

 On growth path

 London, Dec. 12 (Reuters): Asia-focused bank Standard Chartered said its operating profit is on track to meet analysts expectations and jump at least 20 per cent this year, but an acceleration in its cost growth knocked its shares. 

 The London-headquartered bank said on Tuesday it had accelerated the pace of its investment to take advantage of the fast-growing markets it operates in, and as a result costs are expected to rise broadly in line with the pace of income growth.

 Standard Chartered, which makes more than 75 per cent of its profit in Asia, said both its consumer and wholesale businesses show strong income momentum. Excluding businesses bought in Korea, Pakistan and Taiwan in the last two years, the rate of income growth for the full year is in line with the 15 per cent growth seen in the first-half, it said. 

 It said this years purchases in Pakistan and Taiwan were performing in line with expectations and consumer banking in Korea, India and West Asia were achieving good double-digit per cent income growth. 

 Mortgage income had been affected by rising interest rates and strong competition in some key markets, however, especially in Hong Kong, Singapore, India, West Asia, China and Indonesia. 

 Standard Chartered said it was comfortable with asset quality in both consumer and wholesale. It said as predicted there had been a sharp drop in the loan impairment charge in Taiwan, where impairments jumped to $203 million (103.6 million) in the first half from $23 million a year earlier, after banks were hit by an increase in defaults on unsecured loans.

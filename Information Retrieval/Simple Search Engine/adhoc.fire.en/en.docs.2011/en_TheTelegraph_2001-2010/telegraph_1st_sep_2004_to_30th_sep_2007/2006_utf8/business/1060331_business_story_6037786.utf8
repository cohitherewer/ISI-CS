 Ranbaxy buys second firm in two days

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 30: A day after acquiring Romanias Terapia, Ranbaxy Laboratories Limited has snapped up Ethimed NV, a Belgian generics drug company.

 The financial details of the deal are, however, not available.

 Ranbaxy intends to manage operations in the Benelux territories out of Ethimed in Belgium. The acquisition follows a similar strategy that Ranbaxy adopted in larger European markets. This deal will allow Ranbaxy to anticipate local market dynamics and capitalise on the changing business landscape in the Benelux countries, a Ranbaxy statement said.

Ethimed offers Ranbaxy a ready distribution 

network to exploit new product opportunities, said Peter Burema, president 

(Europe, CIS, Africa amp; Latin America) of Ranbaxy.

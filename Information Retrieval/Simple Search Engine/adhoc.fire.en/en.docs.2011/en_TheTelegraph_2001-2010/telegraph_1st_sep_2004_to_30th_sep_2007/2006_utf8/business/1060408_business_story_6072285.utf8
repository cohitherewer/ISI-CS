 Booster dose for aviation

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 7: The government plans to make India a major refuelling transit point for international airlines and will offer export incentives for air catering services too.

 Commerce minister Kamal Nath said, Supplies of stores ? food, beverages and other supplies ? and refuelling of long distance flights have emerged as big business opportunities. At present, most airlines on this route replenish supplies or refuel at Thailand, Malaysia or Singapore. 

 In India, these supplies were not treated as exports and suppliers could not obtain the duty neutralisation benefits available to other products. This made the store supplies from within the country uncompetitive.

 According to a new policy unveiled today, Such supplies are being brought on an equal footing with other exports and supplies of stores on board of the foreign going vessel or aircraft shall be treated as exports so that companies can avail of benefits under the various export promotion schemes. This will help India offer competitive fuel prices and attract mid-route stops of the international flights.

 Air catering service providers said the move would open up a major business area for the on-board food-and-beverages segment in India. 

 This is an extremely positive step. This would put Indian air catering services on an equal footing with international players, besides earning valuable foreign exchange for the country, a spokesperson of a Delhi-based air-catering services company said.

 The benefits to standalone restaurants, however, have been scaled down. They will be entitled to duty credit equivalent of 10 per cent ? down from 20 per cent ? of the foreign exchange earned by them in the preceding fiscal.

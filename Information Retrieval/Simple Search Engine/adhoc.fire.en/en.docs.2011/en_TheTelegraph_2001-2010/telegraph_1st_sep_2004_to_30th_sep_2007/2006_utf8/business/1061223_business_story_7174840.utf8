 Winter of content in travel

 GARIMA SINGH

 New Delhi, Dec. 22: Tourists, unfazed by soaring room rates and over-crowded holiday locations, have chosen to travel extensively both within the country and abroad this winter.

 Clubbing winter holidays with the festive season break, destinations such as Kerala, Goa, Rajasthan, Kashmir and Shimla have become hotspots.

 Goa is the eternal favourite for Christmas. But because of snowfall and aggressive marketing, locations such as Kashmir, Kullu and Manali have also caught peoples fancy this time, said Subhash Goyal, president of the Indian Association of Tour Operators (Iato).

 Overseas destinations like Greece, South Africa and Egypt are attracting a lot of tourist interst. Attractive packages for Singapore, Maldives, Bangkok, Colombo and Kathmandu are also available this season.

 Consider this. A three-night stay at a three-star hotel in Kathmandu comes for Rs 11,000 per person inclusive of airfare. Moreover, a five-day combined trip to Maldives and Colombo can be booked for Rs 25,000 per person.

 A three-day two-night stay at Bangkok-KualaLumpur or a Bangkok-Singapore packaged tour is available for anything between Rs 28,000-30,000.

 Winter is the best time to travel. Nearly 30-40 per cent of leisure travel takes place around this time. Bookings are done around two to three months in advance, said Praveen Chugh, vice-president of Travel Agents Federation of India.

 While Indians traditionally preferred travelling overseas more during summers than in winters, low airfares and cheap accommodations in places like Thailand, Colombo, Malaysia and Singapore are luring Indians to travel abroad in winter as well.

 While rooms in India are not available for less than $260-300 a night in a decent hotel, one can easily find rooms for $60-100 a night in Bangkok. So, why will tourists not prefer travelling abroad? Also, loads of shopping, which is a must on the itinerary, is taken care of, said Goyal.

 Reform string to state grants

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 MONEY MATTERS

 New Delhi, March 26: The Manmohan Singh government is weighing options to link good governance with the tens of thousands of crores of rupees in grants that the Centre gives to states every year. It also plans to arm panchayats with greater powers to independently take up projects and impose local taxes.

 The cabinet secretary will convene a meeting of the core group on administrative reforms to discuss proposals to link grants with a good governance index comprising parameters such as infant mortality rate, extent of immunisation, literacy rate of women, child-sex ratio, new jobs created, extent of early marriages among girls and, most interestingly, the number of officers booked for corruption.

 The meeting slated for Thursday is a follow-up to a directive from the National Advisory Council (NAC) just before Congress president Sonia Gandhi resigned as its chairperson. The council not only wants to link grants to good governance but also intends to hand over more powers to panchayats and bring in a fixed minimum tenure for civil servants at any given posting. 

 Grants to states are now given on the basis of a complex Gadgil formula that takes into account population size, economic development as well as criteria for fiscal prudence. Alteration in the formula could generate support from states which stand to gain as well as protests from those which could lose out. Experts feel a change in the formula will spur states to carry out more reforms. The NAC also elaborated on the criteria for good governance. Besides checking infant mortality and weeding out bureaucratic corruption, the directive also referred to other standards such as enforcing market wages for farm labour and ensuring safe drinking water in villages. 

 Officials said senior secretaries, who are members of the core group on administrative reforms, would attend the meeting. Their recommendations will be placed before the Union cabinet. 

 The NAC directive aims to provide not only greater autonomy to the panchayats but also hand over more powers by giving them the right to levy taxes. This may not go down well with most states which have always sought to increase their powers at the expense of the Centre, but have resisted devolution of power to villages.

 Hexaware mulls unit in east

 ARUNDHATI BAKSHI DIGHE 

 Nishar: Shifting focus

 Mumbai, Feb. 15: Hexaware Technologies, the mid-cap IT company, is planning its first campus in the eastern region.

 It will be a toss-up between Calcutta and Bhubaneswar for our next campus. We will be looking at close to 25 acres to set up the campus, Atul Nishar, chairman of Hexaware Technologies, told The Telegraph today. We are talking to the governments of both the states to help us locate a suitable plot.

 This will be Hexawares first campus in the eastern region. It already has presence in the north (Gurgaon), west ( Mumbai) and south. 

 With the opening up of the Chennai centre, we have considerably enhanced our presence across the country. The only region to go is the east. Calcutta has a large talent pool and will drive growth in the coming years, he added. 

 The centre in the eastern region will be second only to the 27-acre campus in Chennai, which the company plans to build in three phases. The company hopes to start with 1000 people and then expand as and when the need arises. 

 We have not decided about the actual number of people that we will hire, but as we add capacity in the eastern operations, we will keep on adding people, he said. 

 It is easier to get talent there (in the eastern region) because the market is not that saturated right now. The quality of manpower is also very high. This makes it an ideal location for us, Nishar said. 

 Although he refused to divulge any financial details, it is estimated that the company is looking at investing more than Rs 100 crore in the eastern region, primarily in Calcutta in a phased manner. Most of our UK-based clients will be serviced out of this centre in the east, he said. 

 Hexaware has recently announced that it would set up a centre in Chennai. It is expected to invest more than Rs 350 crore in this campus, its first in south India. The campus will span over 27 acres and will be completed in three phases spanning approximately five years. 

 The first phase will have a built-up area of 4.5 lakh square feet and is expected to be completed by January 2007.

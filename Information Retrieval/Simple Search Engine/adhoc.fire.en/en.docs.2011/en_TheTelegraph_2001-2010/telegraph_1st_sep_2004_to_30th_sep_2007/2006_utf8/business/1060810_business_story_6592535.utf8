 Sterlite keeps all in suspense

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 9: Sterlite Industries is reported to have filed a case in Delhi High Court seeking transfer of the 49 per cent residual stake in Balco from the government. 

 However, no official of the Vedanta Group, which owns Sterlite, was available to confirm the details. 

 Officials said Sterlite had already sent a cheque for Rs 1,100 crore to the government, but this has been kept in abeyance as the attorney-general had ruled against the sale. 

 Meanwhile, according to agencies, Delhi High Court has granted four weeks to the government and Sterlite to settle the sale of residual equity in Balco. Acting on the petition filed by Sterlite, Justice H.R. Malhotra has asked the Centre to negotiate with Sterlite on its claim for the 49 per cent share.

 Earlier, on the basis of the attorney-generals advice, the core group on disinvestment had decided not to sell the residual stake either to Sterlite or to the public through an IPO. Since Balco was an unlisted concern, the government believed that Sterlite was unlikely to co-operate in listing Balco during the IPO. This ruled out the IPO option. 

 The attorney-general had offered three options to the core group negotiate sale of the rump shares with Sterlite or any other third party based on market rate make an IPO; or opt out of sell-off if it is against public interest. 

 The core group then wrote to Sterlite, which controversially acquired a majority stake in Balco during the NDA regime, stating there was no breach of trust by the government and there was no question of redressal. 

 The letter also stressed two other points: first, the attorney-general has ruled that the shareholders agreement provisions on valuation date and the call option do not survive besides contravening the law. Sterlite made the call option on March 19, 2004. 

 Second, Sterlite should come forward for an amicable negotiation or conciliation or else settle for formal arbitration proceedings. 

 Officials said the attorney-generals opinion is quite clear. It says in view of sections within the Companies Act, 1956 and Indian Contract Act, 1872, the provision of valuation date and call option do not survive and consequently Sterlite cannot exercise option or bind the government of India to accept the same.

 Calcutta, May 1: Suzuki Motorcycle India Pvt Ltd will launch its urban motorcycle model, the Zeus (125 cc), this month.

 This will be Suzuki Motorcycles (SMIPL) second launch after the Heat (125cc), which was introduced recently. The Heat is for heavy use in semi-urban and rural areas.

 The launch was not delayed but we had to weigh options carefully and ensure support through volumes for the Zeus which would spearhead our entry into the competitive two-wheeler space, said Vipul Goel, manager-service, SMIPL.

 For the first year of its operations, the company plans to sell 1 lakh units of the Heat and Zeus in the market.

 Since we are just entering the market, we will be happy to do a lakh units in the first year. We are not looking at a definitive percentage of market share currently, Goel said.

 The Gurgaon factory, built on a 6.5-acre plot, can manufacture 1.2 lakh vehicles per annum. 

 SMIPL will expand the capacity in tune with market demands.

 The total manufacturing facility is spread across 37 acres. The rest of the land has been kept for future development.

 Both the models are indigenous barring a few parts which have been imported from the parent company, Suzuki Motor Corporation, Japan. Suzuki Motor holds a 74 per cent stake in the Indian subsidiary.

 The company is planning to launch models for the 150cc segment next fiscal.

 The plan is to start with mass market products and gradually expand the portfolio to include all segments.

 SMIPL plans to launch at least one to two models every year and has no immediate plans to start exports.

 In a two-wheeler market already crowded with Hero Honda, Bajaj Auto, Honda and TVS Motors, SMIPL plans to offer a slew of initiatives that will enhance the buying experience of consumers.

 The number of dealers will increase from 40 to 100 in the first year and the company will have 4000-5000 sq ft of showrooms and service stations for customer services across the country. Around Rs 200 crore has already been invested in the Indian operations.

 Suzuki Motor Corporation sells around 20 lakh bikes a year globally, including light weight super bikes, dirt bikes, street, motocross and fun bikes.

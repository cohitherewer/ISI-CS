 Calcutta, May 5: United Bank of India (UBI) is gearing up for an initial public offering. The cabinet has allowed the bank to write off Rs 278.44-crore in accumulated loss against its share capital of Rs 1810.87 crore and return Rs 700 crore equity from the adjusted capital to the government. 

 The bank can also convert a portion of the balance Rs 832.43-crore equity capital into preference capital.

 ?However, the amount of capital to be returned to the government and converted into preference shares will be decided according to the Reserve Bank guidelines, which we are yet to get,? UBI chairman and managing director P.K. Gupta today said while taking stock of the bank?s annual numbers for 2005-06.

 ?Thanks to the loss write-off, we could post a clean balance sheet for the first time,? Gupta said. The city-based public sector bank has, in turn, paid a dividend of Rs 45.97 crore after 14 years.

 UBI will start capital restructuring as soon as the Reserve Bank of India gives its nod, Gupta said. ?Our board members will soon meet to discuss the details of the exercise. However, an IPO appears to be the most suitable way to divest the government stake,? said Gupta.

 The bank reported a decline in its operating and net profit for the year ended March 2006. The profit from operations, on a total business (deposit plus credit) of Rs 45,213 crore, slipped to Rs 643.85 crore in 2005-06 from Rs 689.64 crore in the previous year. This was primarily due to a steep increase of Rs 113 crore in the wage bill and a 72 per cent fall in profit from investments.

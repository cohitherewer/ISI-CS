 Ford austerity drive

 New York, Aug. 18 (Reuters): Ford Motor Co is considering closing more factories and eliminating more management jobs to cut North American salary costs by another 10 per cent to 30 per cent, the Wall Street Journal reported on its web site on Thursday.

 Citing people familiar with the automakers plans, the newspaper said chairman and chief executive officer Bill Ford Jr is under pressure to speed up the companys restructuring plan, dubbed The Way Forward.

 That plan, unveiled in January, called for cutting Fords North American hourly workforce by 30,000 and closing 14 plants by 2012.

 The Journal said Ford executives were now considering plans to expand the Way Forward cuts, speed-up the closings and scale back benefits.

 It said one pressing issue for Ford is that sales of sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks are slumping and company officials believe demand for large and mid-size SUVs is decreasing.

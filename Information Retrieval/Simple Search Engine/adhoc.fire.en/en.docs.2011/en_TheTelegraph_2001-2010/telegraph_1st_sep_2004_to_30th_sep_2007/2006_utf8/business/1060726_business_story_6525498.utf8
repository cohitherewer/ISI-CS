 Trade talk date linked to US polls

 New Delhi, July 25: With the US politics casting a shadow over the WTO talks, Indian policymakers feel the right time to resume the multilateral trade negotiations would be after either the Congressional polls or the presidential elections in that country.

 A senior commerce ministry official told The Telegraph that talks could resume either after the Congressional polls in November or after the US presidential elections in 2008.

 The extreme position taken by US trade representative Susan Schwab at Geneva is being largely attributed to the need to appease the politically powerful farm lobby.

 A senior official said the small number of farmers, who enjoy the $19-billion annual subsidy, command a formidable political clout as they contribute huge amounts to election funds and this cannot be ignored with Congressional polls round the corner.

 After the elections are over, the future course of action will also depend on whether the Republicans or Democrats are in majority. The Democrats are known to be highly conservative on the subsidy issue and staunch supporters of the farm lobby and their coming to power would make things more difficult. 

 The special powers of the US President George Bush to negotiate on trade for his country will expire in mid-2007. The negotiation process would slow down after that and regular approvals would be required from time to time. Even if a similar law is put in force again, it would take some time.

 Commerce minister Kamal Nath, while blaming the US for the breakdown in the WTO talks, said there was no roadmap for resuming the talks at present.

 He said, While the EU had agreed to cut its farm subsidies by 75 per cent, the US had brought nothing to the negotiating table.

 The minister said, It was not only a question of bridging the gap in terms of numbers, but an issue of widely divergent mindsets. 

 The US has to change its mindset and realise that the Doha round is about correcting the existing trade flows in favour of the developing countries. It is not about providing market access to trade-distorting subsidised goods, he added.

 Nath said the G-20 and G-33 represent 90 per cent of the worlds farmers. But the US and the EU account for over 50 per cent of the global trade in agriculture with only 2 per cent of their population engaged in farming because they are backed by huge subsidies.

 The minister said the US had been totally alienated at the Geneva talks and even the EU had criticised it for taking such an extreme position.

 He, however, said the failure of the talks would not affect trade ties with the US, currently the largest trade partner. The talks are about incremental growth in trade, he added.

 Nath said the India-US trade policy forum set up at the Bush-Manmohan summit in Washington would take steps to promote bilateral trade between the two countries. He said Prime Minister Manmohan Singh would attend the India-EU summit at Helsinki in October and this would provide an opportunity to boost trade with European nations. 

 Senior commerce ministry officials, however, said with the collapse of the talks, the expected growth in the exports of textile and leather products would be lower as peak duties of advanced countries would remain in place.

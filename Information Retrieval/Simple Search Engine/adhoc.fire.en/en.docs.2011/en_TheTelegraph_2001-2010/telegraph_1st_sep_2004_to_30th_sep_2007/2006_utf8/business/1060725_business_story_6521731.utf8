 US drives last nail in trade coffin

 New Delhi, July 24: World trade talks collapsed in Geneva today with the US refusing to budge on the issue of slashing farm subsidies and the developing countries, represented by India and Brazil, standing firm on not throwing open their markets to the influx of cheap western goods.

 ?Talks have failed. All negotiations have been suspended,? commerce minister Kamal Nath said from Geneva. He said ?it could take anywhere from months to years,? for the multilateral trade talks to resume. 

 The minister is flying back to confer with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and finance minister P. Chidambaram on India?s future strategy. 

 Nath said, ?We cannot accept the opening up of our markets to subsidised agriculture products. Nor can India reduce duties on industrial products without adequate safeguards.? 

 He said the onus was on developed countries to break the deadlock and blamed the US for refusing to make substantial cuts in farm subsidies.

 In an oblique reference to the US, Nath said in a statement earlier at the meeting, ?Unfortunately one member is unable to make any effective reduction in trade distorting subsidies, but at the same time is insisting that developing countries open up their markets to provide access to their subsidised products.?

 EU trade commissioner Peter Mandelson also blamed the US for the breakdown in the multilateral trade talks.

 He said, ?The US was unwilling to accept or indeed acknowledge, the flexibility being shown by others in the room and, as a result, felt unable to show any flexibility on the issue of farm subsidies.?

 US trade representative Susan Schwab, however, said, ?The US remains committed to a robust, ambitious and balanced round; unfortunately our trading partners were more interested in the loopholes than in market access.?

 WTO chief Pascal Lamy had set another two days of talks for July 27 and 28. However, after the 14-hour marathon session today attended by the ministers of India, Brazil, Australia, the US, EU and Japan, another session seems unlikely so soon.

 The G-6 nations have played a leading role in the WTO negotiations as they together account for close to 75 per cent of world trade and represent a wide range of commercial interests covering both the developed and developing countries.

 The failure of the talks has jeopardised the future of the Doha round. The December 2006 deadline for concluding the round, which was launched in 2001, was fixed keeping in mind that the special powers of the US president to negotiate on trade for his country will expire in mid-2007. 

 ?I speak with sadness and a sense of loss. The development in the G-6 meeting have highlighted that there is little ground for convergence on the core issues of the Doha round as of now,? Nath said.

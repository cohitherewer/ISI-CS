 Tax, tax, more tax on Left wish list

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 2: The Congress-led coalition governments largest outside ally ? the Left parties ? today asked the government to bring back the long-term capital gains tax, inheritance tax and a new set of levies on luxuries.

 Left leaders presented a 13-page set of alternate proposals to increase revenues to finance minister P. Chidambaram which, they claimed, would help raise larger resources for social sector spending. 

 At their meeting with Chidambaram, the Left parties demanded that corporate taxes be raised, the scope of service tax widened and innovative measures to unearth black money discovered. Another meeting is scheduled later this month.

 Making out a special case for bringing back the long-term capital gains tax, CPM leader Prakash Karat said, Why should the capital market be given special preference? 

 He added that its abolition some time back discriminated against productive sectors of the economy. 

 The market ? which has been flirting with the magical 10000 peak ? will be frazzled by the Lefts suggestion. The Left also proposed an increase in the rate of the securities transaction tax.

 North Block officials feel there is little chance of the long-term capital gains tax and inheritance tax being brought back.

 However, the demand that inheritance tax be brought back for high net worth people in line with western countries is likely to be considered seriously. 

 Karat said, We dont say that whatever is inherited should be taxed. But over a limit, a tax should be imposed on inheritance.

 The Left also proposed imposition of tax on luxury consumption, which has increased in recent times, he added.

 Officials said the government was likely to look into the Lefts proposals on ways to ramp up the saving rate.

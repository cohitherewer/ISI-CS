 McLeod in the black

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 30: McLeod Russel India today reported a net profit of Rs 22.92 crore for the year 2005-06 against a net loss of Rs 19.75 crore during the previous year.

 The company posted a turnover of Rs 511.52 crore during the year, representing close to 60 per cent rise over the previous years turnover of Rs 320.24 crore.

 The companys export was 25 per cent of the total sales of Rs 110.67 crore.

 Other income included Rs 20.03 crore from the sale of real estate and profit from the sale of investments.

 The fourth-quarter period ended March 2006 registered a net loss of Rs 45.14 crore from sales of Rs 115.73 crore.

 During the year the company amalgamated Williamson Tea Assam Limited. However, shares were yet to be allotted to the shareholders. The company would issue 4,25,25,000 shares of Rs 5 each to shareholders of Williamson Tea Assam. 

 McLeod expects higher tea prices in the first three months of the current year to increase its operating margins.

 The current operating margins in plantation business for north Indian tea has been quite low, but the trend is set to witness a turnaround with tea prices increasing by Rs 10 per kg for McLeod in the first three months of 2006, said Kamal Baheti, director of McLeod Russel India Limited.

 We expect the trend to continue and prices should go up further from October 2006. The Kenyan drought impact, the off season scarcity and the increasing domestic demand should take the market to a new high. The impact is expected to continue for the next two years, he added.

 Baheti said the firms core competence is in plantations business. Only companies which own strong beverage brands are choosing to focus on brands rather than the plantation business.

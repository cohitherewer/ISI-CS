The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 State Bank to charge more for services

 SRIKUMAR BANERJEE AND SAMBIT SAHA

 Costly proposition

 Calcutta, Jan. 31: Banking with the country?s largest public sector bank will prove dearer from the month of February.

 The State Bank of India is increasing its service charges ? the fees it levies for various core and non-core banking services to account and non-account holders ? from February 1. 

 The steepest hike will be seen in the penalty charged for not maintaining a minimum average balance in an account. In case of savings accounts, the service charge has been hiked to Rs 300 annually from Rs 50. For current accounts, it will be Rs 750.

 Closing an account within a year of opening it will also attract a service charge of Rs 220.

 Charges for issuing demand drafts have been increased to Rs 30 from Rs 12.50 earlier for up to Rs 10,000. The bank will charge Rs 100 against Rs 20 earlier to issue a duplicate passbook.

 The free ATM-cum-debit cards for account holders will now attract an annual maintenance fees of Rs 50 and it will be levied at the beginning of the second year of the account.

 Charges for other services such as signature and photo attestation, duplicate records, cheque books and custody charges (for shares, ornaments) have also been steeply increased. 

 Senior SBI officials said the hike in service charges is in keeping with the bank?s renewed thrust on increasing its fee-based income. However, other bankers are taking it with a pinch of salt. ?It?s not quite understood as to why SBI had to increase its service charges so steeply,? said an official with a city-based scheduled bank. ?Increasing fee-based income could be one reason, the other could be that its (SBI?s) cost has increased,? he said. 

 SBI has posted a marginal 1.4 per cent increase in its third-quarter profit in the current fiscal.

 Britannia to ramp up capacity

 Calcutta, July 12: Britannia Industries Ltd, on a growth trajectory since April last year, will increase its existing capacity. It will look at greenfield projects in the next two years as well as keep a watch on possible buyouts that will compliment and expand its product portfolio.

 The company, which has grown by 23 per cent in the first half of 2006, recently gained a foothold in the premium market for cakes, breads and high-end ready-to-eat food and snacks by acquiring Daily Bread. It plans to gradually pick up a 50 per cent stake in the company.

 Currently, our wholly owned manufacturing facilities in New Delhi, Chennai, Uttaranchal and Calcutta are just about meeting demands. But if we have to sustain a growth rate of more than 20 per cent, the capacity has to be increased by 50 per cent, said Britannia CEO Vinita Bali.

 The companys current capacity is around 4,00,000 tonne. Last fiscal, Britannia invested Rs 60 crore to expand the capacity and Bali said the company would work upon the amount for this year.

 The company is open to expand the retail footprint of Daily Bread, which operates through its own and franchised retail outlets.

 Bali said since Daily Bread is a separate business it is too premature to decide whether Britannia would use the outlets to stock its own products.

 According to Bali, Britannia is a company of different brands and has always been on the look out for brands to add to its existing portfolio of biscuits, cakes, rusks and dairy businesses.

 Britannia is not interested in acquiring Modern Foods, she added.

 The eastern market, which was growing at 4-5 per cent last year, is currently growing at over 20 per cent.

 More than 80 per cent of the companys revenues come from biscuits.

 The organised branded domestic biscuit industry comprising national players is worth Rs 5,000 crore and is growing at the rate of 12 per cent. The real value of the market, including local players, will be many times more. The eastern region alone will have more than 300 local players, Bali said.

 Small telecom firms get breathing space

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 27: The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) today exempted service providers with turnover of less than Rs 25 crore from filing separate audited cost figures. The move is likely to benefit stand-alone service providers such as public mobile radio trunk services (PMRTS) and Internet service providers which have a turnover of less than Rs 25 crore.

 The reporting system on accounting separation regulations, 2004 is applicable to all telecom service providers and every year these service providers are required to prepare accounting separation reports on the basis of historical and replacement cost accounting.

 Some of the service providers wrote to Trai that the filing of accounting separation reports was not only difficult for them, as they were small and standalone operators providing single products and network services, but were also causing a heavy financial burden. 

 The main objective of the accounting separation reports was to provide audited cost figures for tariff setting. Since, most service providers with turnover of Rs 25 crore or below are providing services like PMRTS, internet, radio paging etc and for which tariffs are forborne, their accounting separation reports may not be required, said Trai in a statement.

 Moreover, low turnover generally represents under utilisation of network or smaller nature of the operation itself. The cost figures for such companies may not be very useful for tariff setting, said Trai.

 Further, Trai has also decided that service providers except national long distance, international long distance and access providers, will be exempt from preparing accounting separation reports based on replacement cost accounting as Trai has stopped regulating tariff of most of these services.

 Accounting separation regulations were framed keeping in mind the importance of replacement cost in cost of telecom services. However, over the years competition in many areas have matured and the authority has stopped regulating tariffs for most of the services, said Trai.

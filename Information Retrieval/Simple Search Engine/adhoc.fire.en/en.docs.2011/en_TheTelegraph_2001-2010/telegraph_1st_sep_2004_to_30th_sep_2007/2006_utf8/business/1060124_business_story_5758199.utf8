 New Delhi, Jan. 23: Japanese industry has sought improvement in infrastructure and regulatory processes in Indian markets.

 It is difficult to do business in Indian markets. There are a lot of regulatory and infrastructure gaps, Japanese ambassador to India Yasukuni Enoki said at a meeting of the Japan-India Business Co-operation Committee (JIBCC) organised by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci).

 He also called for opening up Indias retail sector.

 Department of industrial policy and promotion secretary Ajay Dua said the government was considering the merits and demerits of allowing foreign direct investment (FDI) in retail. The government will talk to all stakeholders before opening up the sector to FDI, he said.

 The impact on the traditional retail sector, which employs millions of people, has to be examined before taking a final stand, he added.

 The Left parties ? key allies of the United Progressive Alliance at the Centre ? are vehemently opposed to the idea of allowing FDI in retail.

 Finance minister P. Chidambaram had earlier said the government would decide on FDI in retail after examining different views.

 Meanwhile, officials said the increase in bilateral trade between the countries was an indication that India was opening up.

 Indo-Japan bilateral trade was $4.8 billion in 2004-05. Indian industry has called for increasing it to $10 billion in the next five years, according to Ficci president Saroj Kumar Poddar.

 The Comprehensive Economic Co-operation Agreement (CECA) between the two countries is expected to boost two-way trade.

 Dua also highlighted the huge scope for private investment in electricity and road sectors.

 The transmission sector is now fully open to foreign investment and power trading has been allowed so that distribution companies can sell power to any bulk consumer, he said.

 Japan is the third biggest investor in India, which is the largest recipient of the Japanese Official Development Assistance.

 The flow of investment to India is based on sound economic considerations and indicates that the country offers a safe and sound business environment, said Dua. Japanese companies in India increased from 230 in 2004 to 330 at present. This could go up several-fold if the Indian government goes in for further economic liberalisation, said Enoki.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Jet fuel prices gain height

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 1: Public sector oil companies today hiked jet fuel prices by 2.4 per cent for domestic airlines from Rs 4,6564.46 per kilo litre (KL) to Rs 4,7691.07 in Calcutta. 

 Jet fuel price for domestic airlines in Delhi rose Rs 1,063.93, or 2.5 per cent, to Rs 42,367.51 a kl, while that in Mumbai went up by 2.5 per cent to Rs 43,826.43 per kl from Rs 42,731.31 per kl.

 A senior Indian Oil official told The Telegraph that prices have been increased as part of a monthly exercise to bring domestic prices on a par with rising international rates of the fuel.

 These prices include the sales tax component that domestic airlines have to pay. 

 For international carriers, the price hike percentage works out to 1.8 per cent as they do not have to pay a sales tax. The price of aviation turbine fuel in Calcutta will be $721.53 per kl, which is $12.27 higher than the earlier price of $709.26 per kl. For Delhi, the price has been fixed at $697.58 per kl, up $12.17 from $685.41.

 Airlines are undecided on whether to react to the price rise with matching fare hikes. 

 Both Jet and Indian Airlines said they would study the situation and then take a decision.

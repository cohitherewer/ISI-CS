 Calcutta, Sept. 1: With the Centre preparing a blueprint to award coal blocks to private sector companies for other than captive use, Mumbai-based Atlanta Ltd has started scouting for joint venture partners to grab the business opportunity.

 We are in talks with a few US and Australian companies for a possible joint venture tie-up, said Rajhoo Bbarot, managing director of Atlanta Ltd, which today hit the market with a public issue of 43 lakh equity shares.

 Atlanta recently started contract mining for Mahanadi Coal Fields at two mines in Talcher, Orissa.

 The public issue, which closes on September 7, has a price band of Rs 130-150 and constitutes 26.38 per cent of the post-issue paid-up capital of the company.

 The proceeds of the issue will primarily be used for the special purpose vehicle Balaji Tollways Ltd that the company has formed a joint venture with Srei Infrastructure Finance Ltd for collecting toll at the Nagpur-Kondhali road project. The company is constructing the project on a build-own-transfer basis at an investment of Rs 226 crore and the toll collection will start from January.

 With an investment of Rs 42.9 crore from the Rs 64.5 crore the company aims to mop up from the IPO, Atlantas stakeholding in Balaji Tollways will go up to 76 per cent.

 The company plans to invest about Rs 13.5 crore to purchase machinery like surface miners and loaders and Rs 10 crore each towards debt repayment and working capital.

 Atlanta has clocked a total income of Rs 109.4 crore in 2005-06, and a net profit of Rs 15.5 crore.

 Of its total revenue, 89 per cent came from the construction and the remaining 11 per cent from mining business.

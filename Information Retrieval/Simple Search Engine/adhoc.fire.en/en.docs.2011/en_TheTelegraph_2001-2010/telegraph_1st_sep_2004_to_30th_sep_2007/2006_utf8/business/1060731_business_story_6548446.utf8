 IPO-bound Cairn in reserves tangle

 S.P.S. PANNU

 ON slippery ground

 New Delhi, July 30: Cairn Energy and the directorate general of hydrocarbons seem to differ over the estimated in-place oil reserves in the MNCs Rajasthan fields.

 Cairn Energy CEO Bill Gammel has claimed that the reserves could go up to 3.5 billion barrels, out of which one billion barrels would be recoverable.

 Sources said the directorate general of hydrocarbons, however, has certified the reserves to be at 1.16 billion barrels. Whether it will actually go up to 3.5 billion barrels is difficult to say at this point of time, said a senior ONGC official.

 Cairn owns a 70 per cent stake in the field and ONGC has 30 per cent, which it acquired after exercising the right to buy into the field.

 The issue is significant as Cairn plans to go in for an IPO to fund the development of the fields.

 The company has already signed an agreement with a consortium of foreign banks for a $1-billion loan, which it plans to repay in 18 months.

 It is planning to list on Bombay Stock Exchange either in the last quarter of this fiscal or in the first quarter of the next, subject to market conditions. Gammel said the company would start commercial production by the end of 2008, which would go up to a peak production of 150,000 barrels per day.

 The company will invest $4 billion to develop the Rajasthan fields. The prize is also huge, as 600 million barrels to be produced from the fields would work out to around $40 billion, he added.

 Gammel said Cairn has invested $450 million in Rajasthan for striking oil at 18 wells.

 Cairn plans to go in for a quick recovery, and Gammel said, The 150,000 barrels per day peak production would be maintained for at least 4-5 years given the present geological data.

 According to petroleum ministry sources, the output from the fields is expected to fall sharply after the five-year period. The life of the field is expected to last till 2020.

 ONGC is having second thoughts about setting up a refinery in Rajasthan, as the quantity of oil does not seem to be sufficient for a large well-head facility. ONGC acting chairman R.S. Sharma said the refinery would be set up only if it is commercially viable.

 Banks, FIs make a beeline for Maruti pie

 New Delhi, Jan. 4 (PTI): Twenty seven banks and seven financial institutions have submitted expressions of interest (EoIs) for acquiring an 8 per cent stake in Maruti Udyog Limited.

 All the 27 public sector banks, one financial institution and six insurance companies have submitted EoIs for acquiring shares in the car company, sources said.

 Today was the last day for submitting EoIs.

 The offer by the government to sell 8 per cent holding in Maruti has evoked strong interest among all the eligible public sector financial institutions and aggressive bidding is expected, sources added.

 The financial institutions see the offer of sale as an opportunity to acquire a large number of shares of a well performing company at an attractive price.

 If an institution would have tried to acquire bulk shares of Maruti from the market it would have jacked up the prices of the companys shares. They see it (the offer for sale) as a good opportunity to acquire a sizeable stake in the company, sources said. 

 The government wants the financial institutions to bid aggressively for a stake in Maruti. 

 If the bids are not up to the governments expectations and are above the indicative price, the government has reserved the right not to sell all the 2,31,12,804 equity shares on offer.

 Growth story whets appetite of foreigners

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Aug. 18: Foreign direct investment in the country has jumped 47 per cent in the first quarter of this fiscal to touch the $1.7-billion-mark. 

 FDI rose to $1.74 billion in April-June this year compared with $1.18 billion in the same period last fiscal, commerce minister Kamal Nath said here today.

 He said the equity component in FDI leapt 102 per cent in June to $534 million compared with $264 million a year ago.

 June has been a hot month for FDI flows... what is most important is that most of the flows were in manufacturing and were essentially first mile investments, he said, indicating higher investments for the fiscal.

 Nath said he was upbeat over the nature of funds they were not last mile investments, ensuring further inflows later. He was confident of achieving the target of $10 billion for 2006-07 compared with $7.7 billion last year.

 The marquee investments expected this year include $300 million from GM for its manufacturing facility in Maharashtra. Japans Nissan and Suzuki have announced investments of between $700 and $800 million in the next three years. Mitsubishi Chemicals has a $370-million expansion plan in Haldia and Honda will invest $200 million.

 Nath said the sectors to attract heavy FDI were electrical equipment, telecom, financial and non-financial services, transportation, fuels, chemicals, food processing, drugs and pharmaceuticals, cement and metallurgical industry.

 The top 10 investing countries were Mauritius, the US, Japan, Netherlands, the UK, Germany, Singapore, France, South Korea and Switzerland.

 Asked about Semindias plans to set up a facility near Hyderabad, Nath said the government was working on a policy to promote semiconductors. The climate in India is highly conducive to investment, particularly from Taiwan, (South) Korea and Singapore. Companies from these regions are looking at sites in India to locate their manufacturing facilities, he said.

 A business delegation would visit Taiwan later this month to attract investments in electronic hardware, textile machinery and leather goods, he added.

In June, Nath said, Mauritius-based Global Communication 

Service Holdings invested $278 million in Aircel, while Associated Financial Services 

Mauritius invested $120 million into Citi Consumer Finance.

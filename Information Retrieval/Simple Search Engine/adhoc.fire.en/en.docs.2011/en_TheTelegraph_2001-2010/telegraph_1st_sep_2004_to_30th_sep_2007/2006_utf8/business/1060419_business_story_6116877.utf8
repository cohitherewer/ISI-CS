 Calcutta, April 18: Primary dealers will soon be allowed to diversify into stockbroking and venture capital initiatives.

 The central bank has agreed to permit primary dealers to diversify their activities as considered appropriate, RBI governor Y.V. Reddy said during a video conference with reporters after announcing the monetary and credit policy for 2006-07.

 For quite some time, primary dealers have been seeking permission for stockbroking. The RBI has decided to permit primary dealers to trade in stocks and venture capital funds in addition to their core business of government securities, treasury bills and call money market, said Shyamala Gopinath, deputy governor (legal department) of the RBI.

 A committee has already been set up to look into the areas where primary dealers can diversify and decide on the limit, if any, to their exposure in these activities. The panel is expected to come out with its recommendations soon. On the basis of these recommendations, the RBI will frame its guidelines, she added.

 The apex bank has also set up a working committee to implement the suggestions of the high-level RH Patil committee on corporate debt market and debt securitisation. 

 Setting up a corporate debt market is RBIs top priority. We have, therefore, set up a working group to look into different aspects of implementing the RH Patil committee recommendations. It will also suggest the micro infrastructure required for setting up such a market, the RBI governor said.

 The panel will formulate the framework to set up a corporate debt market in association with all the other regulators involved ? the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) and the company law board, besides the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

 During my meeting with bankers this morning, we had discussions on action plans ? whether an efficient market for trading in corporate debt papers could be established within the existing institutional setup or do we need to set up a new one, Reddy said.

 Setting up a vibrant and efficient corporate debt market is our top priority because a large part of the proposed investment in the countrys infrastructure sector will come from here, the RBI governor added. A vibrant, secondary corporate debt market is important for the overall growth of the corporate sector as it provides firms with an alternative source of capital. But, in India, corporate debt papers are hardly traded on the bourses.

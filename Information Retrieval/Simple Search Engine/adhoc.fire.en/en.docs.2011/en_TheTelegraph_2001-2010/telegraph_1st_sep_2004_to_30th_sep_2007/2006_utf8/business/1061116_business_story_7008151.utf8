The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Port project runs aground

 S.P.S. PANNU 

 Sinking feeling

 New Delhi, Nov. 15: The Indian Ports Association (IPA) has raised the hackles of the shipping ministry for not taking its permission before initiating discussions with foreign authorities on collaborations between Indian and foreign ports as part of the twinning strategy.

 The ministry has ruled that henceforth no such discussions will take place without its express consent, sources said.

 IPA has initiated a programme of twinning Indian and foreign ports and has directed its members to identify a foreign port for such an arrangement. 

 IPA has been set up by the major ports of India to improve efficiency. The governing body comprises chairmen of the major ports. The secretariat with a managing director as the head operates from New Delhi.

 Incidentally, Calcutta wants a twinning arrangement with Shanghai as the two ports being riverine can collaborate in managing their common problems. The plan is for the Calcutta port to provide facilities to Chinese sailors and vice versa.

 However, it appears that IPA has overstepped the mark by not routing its deliberations through official diplomatic channels and not appropriately assessing the ramifications of its actions on different ministries, particularly on the issue of security.

 For instance, the association has not considered the impact of twinning on moves by the government to keep out Chinese companies from development of ports. Oil India, too, has been barred by the home ministry from employing Chinese workers for its projects in the Northeast as boundary disputes in Arunachal Pradesh continue to simmer.

 Acknowledging the necessity of government approvals, the Calcutta Port Trust (CPT), however, feels the framework of collaboration needs to be put in place through interaction among the ports prior to making any formal commitments.

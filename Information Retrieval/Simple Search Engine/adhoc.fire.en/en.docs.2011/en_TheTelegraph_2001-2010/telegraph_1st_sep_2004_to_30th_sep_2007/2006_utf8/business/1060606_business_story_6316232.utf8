 Gujarat NRE gifts 1:1 bonus

 A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta, June 5: Calcutta-based Gujarat NRE Coke has doled out a 1:1 bonus to its shareholders, its fourth in as many years.

 The company board, which met today, cleared the bonus proposal that would increase its paid up capital to Rs 240 crore.

 Gujarat NRE, the largest non-captive low-ash met coke manufacturer in India, offered a 1:2 bonus each in 2003 and 2004, followed by a 1:1 serving last year.

 ?We are confident of servicing the larger equity base. Our business model is strong. The company is now turning itself from a coke manufacturing player to an integrated resource company,? said Sumit Khetan, president of the company.

 The company today also announced the merger ratio with its subsidiary company FCGL Industries Ltd, where the shareholders will get one share of Gujarat NRE against every share held in FCGL.

 The board also recommended a final dividend of 5 per cent, taking the total pay out to 50 per cent for the extended 18-month financial year that ended on March 31, 2006.

 The company also decided to increase its authorised capital from Rs 250 crore Rs 1,500 crore.

 ?It will expand the company?s scope to raise debt in case it requires to fund its organic or inorganic growth plans,? an industry observer pointed out.

 The company is in the midst of expanding its met coke making capacity from 1 million tonne (mt) to 1.4 mt by the end of 2007. 

 The coking coal production from its Australian mine will also go up to 1 mt in a year and to 1.7 mt in two years.

 The company is also setting up a 20-mw co-generation power plant, which will start operating by the end of 2007.

 By venturing into coal mining in Australia and steel making as forward integration, Gujarat NRE is trying to become a fully integrated resource company.

 It recorded a turnover of Rs 553 crore in the last fiscal.

 Khetan said the year ahead seemed to augur well for the company since met coke prices have bounced back.

 After touching the low of $130 in November-December, it has bounced back in last the three months.

 ?We have raised its price by $20-a-tonne a couple of days back. It is now hovering at $180-190-a-tonne,? he added.

 Buoyed by the largesse, Gujarat NRE stock braved the bearish sentiment today and rose by 2 per cent to close at Rs 84.25 on BSE.

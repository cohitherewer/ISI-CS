 British Airways joins fare war

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 6: British Airways today joined the fare war on the India-London sector and announced return tickets for Rs 14,500 plus tax, which translates to about Rs 22,000 for flights to London from Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai.

 Flights have to be booked by February 28 and would be for journeys till May-end. However, sources said very few seats will be on offer in this basket per flight. 

 By paying an extra Rs 3,000 (plus taxes), one can also travel to any destination in the UK beyond London. Passenger can go on to Munich and Frankfurt by paying the extra sum. 

 One could also travel to the US for Rs 35,000. BA spokesperson Alok Sawhney said, Our intention is to offer maximum flexibility to our passengers and to offer as many options as possible to fly direct to London. 

 India is a very exciting market for British Airways. We have seen a lot of growth in the aviation sector and have always maintained that there is a huge potential in this country. We are committed to this market and will continue to innovate and offer premium services to our Indian customers, he added.

 BA officials said on offer was a special fare of Rs 40,000 (plus taxes) on travel between Delhi, Calcutta, Bangalore, Mumbai and Chennai to the UK and select destinations in Europe. 

 Earlier, Air Sahara had announced Delhi-London return tickets for Rs 10,000 plus taxes. Other airlines have not yet joined the fare war. 

 The India-UK route is a lucrative one but has recently seen the number of flights going up following a liberal air agreement between the two countries.

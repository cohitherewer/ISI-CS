 Course cheque

 More and more banks offer loans to help students pursue their dreams. Srikumar Bondyopadhyay considers the options

 Remember the commercial by a private 

 life insurance company: a girl tells her parents that she 

 has secured a US scholarship, but it will meet only half 

 of the overall costs. She moans she wont be able to study 

 abroad because theres no one who could finance the rest!

 The commercial goes on to encourage 

 parents to save regularly in the companys childrens education 

 plan. The ad plays upon parents fears that they will not 

 be able to afford the rising costs of education, be it at 

 home or abroad.

 There is, however, an easier way 

 out an education loan from banks. 

 Not so long ago, banks were offering 

 loans for professional courses that had immediate job prospects. 

 Loans for all

 But in August 2001, the government, 

 in consultation with the Reserve Bank (RBI) and the Indian 

 Banks Association (IBA), framed a comprehensive educational 

 loan scheme to ensure that no deserving student in the country 

 was denied higher education for want of finances. The new 

 scheme covers all types of courses, including vocational, 

 in schools and colleges at home and abroad and specifies 

 a maximum loan of Rs 7.5 lakh for studying in India and 

 Rs 15 lakh abroad. 

 The scheme also specified the 

 interest rates to be charged on an education loan. Accordingly, 

 public sector banks are charging loans up to Rs 4 lakh at 

 their respective prime lending rates (PLR) (which now varies 

 between 10.50 per cent and 11.25 per cent) and loans above 

 that at 1 per cent plus PLR.

 Even for toddlers!

 Parents can now avail of an education 

 loan for their childrens schooling, too. The Bank of Baroda, 

 for instance, now offers loans for nursery education as 

 well! Unlike its peers, it also offers a 1 per cent discount 

 on the interest rate for girl students. Andhra Bank offers 

 a discount of 0.5 per cent for girl students. 

 Far, far away

 Punjab National Bank has a no-frills 

 savings account called PNB Vidyarthi Savings Fund, which 

 is for students who stay away from their parents. Under 

 this scheme, the student account holder gets an overdraft 

 facility of up to Rs 10,000. However, the earning parents 

 or local guardians of the student would have to give an 

 undertaking to repay this overdraft if it is used.

 Besides, a one-year moratorium 

 is tacked on to the duration of the course after which the 

 student-borrower is expected to start repaying the loan 

 in equated monthly instalments. The banks charge a simple 

 interest rate for this period. 

 If the interest is paid within 

 the study period, the borrower gets a 1 per cent discount 

 on the rate. But if it is not paid within the period, the 

 interest is added to the principal amount.

 More on the platter

 Banks also provide group term 

 assurance with the loan to ensure that they get back the 

 money if the student-borrower is a defaulter. PNB levies 

 a 0.5 per cent term assurance premia for loans with repayment 

 period above three years. 

 Oriental Bank of Commerce offers 

 a free personal accident cover of Rs 15 lakh. 

 Allahabad Bank provides a term 

 life cover for the loan liability for a single premium ranging 

 between Rs 738 and Rs 1,086 per Rs 1 lakh of loan depending 

 on the loan tenure. 

 Default plan...

 However, the default rate for 

 education loans, particularly with public sector banks, 

 is still high despite the fact that the student-borrower 

 can claim tax deduction under section 80E on the full loan 

 and interest repaid over a period of eight years. 

 Banks now follow stringent norms, 

 especially for students who plan to study abroad. Students 

 studying abroad often change their address without informing 

 the bank and it becomes very difficult to track them down.

 ... dads gotta pay up

 The IBA has formed a working group 

 to look into how study loans can be turned into a viable 

 business. Based on the recommendations of the group, banks 

 have now made it mandatory for the students parents 

 or guardians to become co-borrowers. 

 Home check

 The working group has also suggested 

 that banks should disburse loans from branches close to 

 the permanent residence of the student-borrower. Many banks 

 sanction loans only after checking the parents residence.

 Fund cushion

 The IBA has also suggested setting 

 up a Rs 250-crore Credit Guarantee Fund, which would act 

 as a cushion against defaults and also serve as a group 

 insurance product. 

 The proposal is that the government 

 should fork out half of this fund and the banks should share 

 the rest.

 Once the fund is formed, students 

 can be charged an annual premium of between Rs 10 and Rs 

 15 per Rs 1 lakh borrowed. The bank can claim the insurance 

 if the student defaults. The RBI and the Union finance ministry 

 is considering the proposal.

 Education bank

 Last November, the government 

 introduced the Education Bank of India Bill 2005 in Parliament. 

 The bill envisages setting up an education bank by the Centre. 

 The bank will be headquartered in New Delhi and will have 

 branch offices in every state and Union territory. It will 

 give loans to students. 

 The bill also emphasised that 

 the loan must be disbursed within a month of application 

 and should be paid without any collateral and directly to 

 the educational institution instead of the student. 

 However, loans under the scheme 

 should be given to only those students whose parents cannot 

 afford the cost of education and whose annual income is 

 less than Rs 1 lakh. The loan shall be recovered with simple 

 interest at the rate of 3 per cent per annum. This is, however, 

 yet to come into effect.

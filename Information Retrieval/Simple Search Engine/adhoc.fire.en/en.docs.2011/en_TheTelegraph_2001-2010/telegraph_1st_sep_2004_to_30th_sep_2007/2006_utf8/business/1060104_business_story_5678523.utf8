 Glaxo in new-drug rush

 TESTING TIME

 London, Jan. 3 (Reuters): GlaxoSmithKline Plc aims to update investors on when it will file its Cervarix cervical cancer vaccine for approval in the United States in the near future, Europes biggest drug maker said on Tuesday.

 Glaxo ? whose product is lagging behind a rival shot from Merck amp; Co Inc ? had hoped to announce a timetable for filing Cervarix with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) before the end of 2005, but talks with the agency are still going on.

 Discussions with the FDA are progressing and we expect to be able to give an update soon, a spokesman said.

 Glaxo is due to publish full-year results on February 8 and will be under pressure to give guidance on Cervarix by then, if a filing date has still not been announced.

 Cervarix is viewed as one of the most important new medicines in Glaxos pipeline. However, it looks set to reach the market behind Mercks similar vaccine Gardasil, which has already been submitted for both US and European approval.

 Industry analysts have been expecting Glaxo to file in the US some time in 2006. Most say a first-half submission would be viewed as positive, a second-half filing in line and any delay into 2007 negative.

 Glaxo has said previously it intends to file Cervarix in Europe in the first half of 2006. The US market is expected to account for the bulk of revenues for both products.

 Both Gardasil and Cervarix have proved effective in clinical trials in preventing the most important strains of human papillomavirus, a sexually transmitted virus that causes most cases of cervical cancer, the second-biggest cancer killer in women.

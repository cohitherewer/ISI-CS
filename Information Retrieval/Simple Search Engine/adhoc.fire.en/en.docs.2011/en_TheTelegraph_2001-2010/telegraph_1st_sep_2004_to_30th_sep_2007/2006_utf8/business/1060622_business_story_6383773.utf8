 Hyundai cars to be dearer by Rs 15000

 OUR BUREAU

 Costly proposition

 June 21: Korean carmaker Hyundai Motor will raise prices by up to Rs 15,000 across all models from next month.

 The hike can be expected on all the models and it will be up to Rs 15,000, Hyundai India vice-president (marketing and sales) Arvind Saxena said today.

 In India, Hyundais offerings include small car Santro, premium hatchback Getz, midsize sedan Accent, luxury model Sonata Embera and sports utility vehicle Terracan. Saxena said the company was working out the exact quantum of hike on each model.

 Last week, Hyundai said the companys finances were under strain due to high raw material costs, which include plastic and rubber, and increase in freight charges.

 We have been absorbing the hike in production costs for some time. But it is too much to absorb and hence we will raise prices, HMIL managing director Heung Soo Lheem had said.

 Leading car manufacturer Maruti Udyog has also said it would consider raising prices after June 24 due to significant rise in input costs. The company said it was watching the situation closely.

 Mini-truck launch

 Hyundai Motor India is mulling over introducing its Korean mini-truck model, Porter, in the country and would also set up a manufacturing base for the same.

 The company will conduct a feasibility study on the scope of mini trucks in India, which would be completed in the next 6-8 months.

 We would be doing the survey internally. Porter is currently manufactured only in Korea and exported to countries, including South Africa and Australia, Saxena said.

 The mini truck will compete with the likes of Tata Ace.

 Hyundai will expand the manufacturing capacity at its 500-acre facility near Chennai to 600,000 units by 2007, which will be fully utilised.

 Saxena said if Hyundai rolls out Porter in India, manufacturing the vehicle locally would be more viable. Hence, the company would have to look for alternative locations, he added. There are no plans to phase out Accent and the company has been selling close to 3,500 units per month for the last 2-3 months.

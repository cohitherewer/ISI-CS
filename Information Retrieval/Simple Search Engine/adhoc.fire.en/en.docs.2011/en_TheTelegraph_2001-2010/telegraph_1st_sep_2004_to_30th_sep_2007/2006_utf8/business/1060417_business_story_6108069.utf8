 Apex court frees firms from levy by states

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 16: The Supreme Court has held that state governments cannot levy compensatory tax on any company without providing facilities commensurate to the amount charged.

 A five-judge bench headed by Justice Ruma Pal noted that if there was no direct or immediate benefit to the company, such a levy would amount to restriction on trade and commerce prohibited under Article 301 of the Constitution. The court, thereby, overruled an earlier judgement holding that even if there was some connection between the tax and the facilities provided by the state, the levy would not be unconstitutional.

 A compensatory tax is a reimbursement sought by states for the costs incurred for providing services to the company operating from the state, the court said. Unlike tax, there has to be a quantifiable and measurable benefit from a fee or compensatory tax, the court pointed out. 

 The court noted that Article 301 barred states from putting any restriction on free trade and commerce and taxing laws were no exception. 

 To facilitate free and unrestricted trade throughout the country, the constitution does not allow states to levy sales tax on inter-state sales. Only Parliament has the power to impose restrictions in public interest. The bench quoted with approval the ruling in the Atiabari Tea Company case in which it was held that even tax laws could amount to restriction on trade and commerce.

 Later, in the Automobile Transport case, the concept of compensatory tax was framed to allow states to get back money spent on providing facilities like roads. But the concept was widened in the Bhagatram case which abandoned the direct benefit theory and said even some link between the tax and the facilities was sufficient to justify the levy.

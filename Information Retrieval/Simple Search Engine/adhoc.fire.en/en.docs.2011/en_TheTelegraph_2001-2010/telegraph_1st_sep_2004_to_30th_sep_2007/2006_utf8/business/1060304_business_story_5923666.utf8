 Telecom firms asked to comply with FDI norms

 New Delhi, March 3 (PTI): Telecom service providers have been given four more months, starting tomorrow, to adhere to the 74 per cent FDI guidelines.

 The department of industrial policy and promotion today issued a fresh notification in this regard. All other norms on FDI in telecom remains the same as the original November 3 notification.

 This means no remote access shall be provided to any equipment manufacturer or any other agency outside the country for any maintenance/repairs by the licensee.

 A majority of directors on the board of the companies, including the chairman, managing director and chief executive officer shall be resident Indian citizens. The appointment to these positions shall be made in consultation with Indian investors.

 However, remote access may be allowed for catastrophic software failure (such as failure to boot up), which would lead to a major part of the network becoming non-functional for a prolonged period, subject to meeting the conditions where an identified government agency (intelligence bureau) will be notified when remote access is to be provided.

 The control of remote access activation, transfer of data and termination shall be within the country and not at a remote location abroad.

 This is the first extension granted to telecom companies after the government issued guidelines on raising the FDI to 74 per cent from 49 per cent, both direct and indirect, on November 3. They were then given a four-month compliance period to recast their pyramid structure, which, in some cases, exceeded 74 per cent.

 With the new time period, telecom firms will now have to comply with the 74 per cent FDI norm by July 3.

 The FDI notification of November 3 said the total composite foreign holding, including but not limited to investments by FIIs, NRIs, foreign currency convertible bonds, American depository receipts, global depository receipts, convertible preference shares, proportionate foreign investment in Indian promoters/investment companies, including their holding companies, herein after referred as FDI, will not exceed 74 per cent.

 Thus 74 per cent foreign investment can be made directly or indirectly in the operating firm or through a holding company. Hence, the remaining 26 per cent will be owned by resident Indian citizens or an Indian company.

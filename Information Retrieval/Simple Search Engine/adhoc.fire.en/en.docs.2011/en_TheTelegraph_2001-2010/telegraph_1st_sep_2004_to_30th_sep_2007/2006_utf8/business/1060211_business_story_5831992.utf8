 Sterlite double bonanza

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Feb. 10: The board of Sterlite Industries has proposed to issue bonus shares in the ratio of 1:1.

 The company has also decided to split the face value of its equity shares of Rs 5 each into Rs 2 per share.

 The proposals are subject to shareholders approval.

 The company had issued bonus shares to investors in the ratio of 1:1 in late 2003.

 Sterlite Industries is a part of Vedanta Resources, the London-listed metals and mining company with aluminium, copper and zinc operations in the UK, India and Australia.

 The stock price of the copper and aluminium maker today closed at Rs 1,443.1 against the previous close of Rs 1,446.7. It had touched an intra-day high of Rs 1,495.5 after opening at Rs 1,475. During the trading session, 1,62,160 shares changed hands with a total volume of Rs 23.78 crore transacted on the Bombay Stock Exchange.

 In July last year, Hindalco, another aluminium producing company, had split its shares with a face value of Rs 10 into shares of Re 1. The current face value of the Sterlite scrip is Rs 5.

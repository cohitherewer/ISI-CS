 ONGC set to beat Hazira schedule

 New Delhi, Aug. 16 (PTI): The Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) will restart its flood-hit Hazira gas plant in Gujarat on August 19 two days ahead of schedule to avert a fuel supply crisis, particularly for CNG operations here.

 The situation is better than anticipated. We think we will be able to restart the Hazira gas-processing complex earlier than the previously anticipated date. We hope the plant will come alive on August 18, ONGC chairman and managing director R.S. Sharma said after visiting the marooned facility.

 Sharma, who took a chartered flight from Dehradun to visit the plant as soon as the 18-21-feet-deep water receded, said Hazira would restart in phases, six million standard cubic metres per day (mmscmd) to begin with.

 The shutdown of the plant, which received 40.5 mmscmd gas from ONGCs Bassein and B-55 fields and ONGC-Reliance-BG operated Panna /Mukta and Tapti fields, cost ONGC Rs 21 crore in revenues and Rs 16-17 crore in profits per day.

 Preliminary estimates put the revenue loss during the entire shutdown period at about Rs 500 crore and profit loss at over Rs 200 crore, he said.

 The Hazira visit of Sharma, whose crisis management skills helped ONGC save hundreds of lives when a key facility in Mumbai high fields caught fire last July, infused new life in operations to restart the facility with over 650 employees and labourers working round-the-clock to remove 2-3 feet slug, repair 1,400 motors and replace digital control systems.

 Hazira, whose shutdown tripped half of Indias gas supplies, would be back just in time before stocks for CNG operations in Delhi and some power plants run out. 

 Sharma said the Hazira plant would resume its normal operations by the second or third week of September. Twenty teams have been created to attend to various repair, refurbishment and replacement jobs.

 According to ONGCs insurance policy for onshore facilities, insurers would pay for all repair, replacement and refurbishment after deducting $2-million (Rs 9.2 crore), he said. Sharma said his visit to Dehradun, where he had gone to attend the companys golden jubilee celebrations and Independence Day function, paid off the huge multiples. The employee morale is very high. Everybody wants to put the facility back to operation as soon as possible, he said.

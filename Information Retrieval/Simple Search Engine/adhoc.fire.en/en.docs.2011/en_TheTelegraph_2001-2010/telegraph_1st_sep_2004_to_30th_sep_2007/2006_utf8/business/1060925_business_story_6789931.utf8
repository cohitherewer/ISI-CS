 Yen power in rail corridor

 S.P.S. PANNU

 On track

 New Delhi, Sept. 24: The Japanese government, which is funding the dedicated railway freight corridor project between Delhi and Calcutta and Delhi and Mumbai, has decided to carry out its own feasibility study before extending the long-term loan.

 Sources said while Rail India Technical and Economic Services (RITES) is preparing a detailed feasibility report for the project, the Japanese government will not depend on its estimates but will go by the figures thrown up by its own study.

 The Japanese team has already started work on the dedicated multi-modal high-axle load freight corridors, which will be equipped with a computerised control system, a senior official told The Telegraph. The team is working at a hectic pace and have set an October 2007 deadline for completing the report, he said.

 The corridors between Delhi and Calcutta and Delhi and Mumbai are expected to cost around Rs 22,000 crore but the exact figures will be firmed up only after the detailed feasibility reports are ready.

 As much as 85 per cent of this expenditure is likely to be financed through a low-interest loan from Japan. According to current indications, the loan would carry a 0.4 per cent rate of interest and be payable over a 40-year period with a moratorium of 10 years. The government wants to complete the project in five years.

 The exact financing pattern for the project has not been finalised yet and the government is also keeping its options open to resort to budgetary support, internal generation and market borrowing.

 The Delhi-Calcutta corridor will extend up to Ludhiana in Punjab and will primarily be used for the movement of coal and steel from the east to the power plants and manufacturing units in the north.

 The Delhi-Mumbai corridor will cater to container movement to the ports.

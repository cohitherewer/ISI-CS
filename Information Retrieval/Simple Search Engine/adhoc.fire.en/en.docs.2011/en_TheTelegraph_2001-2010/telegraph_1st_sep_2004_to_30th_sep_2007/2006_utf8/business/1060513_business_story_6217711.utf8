 Singh-Deora meet on oil next week

 Singh: Tough call

 New Delhi, May 12: Petroleum minister Murli Deora is expected to meet Prime Minister Manmohan Singh next week to discuss a price hike of petroleum products.

 Deora will place many options like an alternative range of duty cuts and price increases and the possibility of raising petro bonds before Singh.

 The Prime Minister will have to balance between the need to raise prices to help oil companies, which are suffering losses because of soaring crude rates, and the need to keep a check on price rise so that the inflation rate does not spin out of control.

 Deora: Last hope

 Deora, who met finance minister P. Chidambaram yesterday, sought a re-alignment of duties to avoid any big hike in oil prices. However, the finance minister is willing to concede only a minor duty cut.

 Finance ministry officials said mild duty cuts were being considered, but the ministry was against any major rejig. ?The interest of the common man will be protected. A price shock will be avoided,? officials said.

 The finance ministry wants the price for petrol and diesel to be raised by Rs 5-10 and gas cylinders by Rs 50 at least. However the petroleum ministry, which is being backed by the Left parties, wants the price to be hiked by between Rs 2.50 and Rs 5 a litre. It also wants the customs duty on petrol and diesel to be brought down to 7.5 per cent from 10 per cent, besides a reduction in excise duties.

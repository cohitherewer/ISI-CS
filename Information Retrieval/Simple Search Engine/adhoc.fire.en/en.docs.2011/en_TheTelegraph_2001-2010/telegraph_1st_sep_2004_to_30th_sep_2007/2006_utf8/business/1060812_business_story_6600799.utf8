 Freight rate blow to crude import bill

 S.P.S. PANNU 

 In troubled waters

 New Delhi, Aug. 11: Indias shipping bill for importing crude oil and petroleum products has risen sharply during the current fiscal and even the freight rates did not fall during the summer months this year.

 While freight rates have firmed up all over the world, Indian rates have increased even higher. This is being attributed to the new shipping arrangements, under which Indian Oil Corporation is operating independently of the other oil companies.

 This has introduced an element of competition amongst Indian oil companies, which has resulted in a hike in the freight costs, according to sources.

 They added that while the LPG freight from the Persian Gulf to the Indian west coast was around $32-37 per tonne during last year, it has shot up to $47-51 per tonne in the current fiscal. Each ship brings in about 13,000 tonnes of LPG.

 The shipping cost of LPG from Malaysia to the Indian shores has doubled to $80 per tonne from $40 last year.

 Similarly, there have been instances of shipping costs for the import of crude oil from the Gulf shooting up by more than $100,000 per vessel at the last minute with Indian companies competing with each other.

 Apart from the Gulf, Indian companies are importing large quantities of high quality Bonny light crude from Nigeria on very large crude carriers (VLCCs). Chinese companies that also import crude from Nigeria are reportedly striking smarter deals with the shipping companies than their Indian counterparts.

 This is another aspect that needs to be looked into while formulating the future strategy to cut the freight costs of crude imports. 

 Sources pointed out that the increase in Indian freight rates has been sharper than in the other countries even though India has the flexibility to hire cheaper single hull ships.

 The petroleum ministry is looking into IOCs ship chartering exercise to ascertain how successful the current autonomy given to the Fortune 500 company has been.

 Sources said the government should seriously consider whether the current system is better than the earlier one, in which all the oil companies had a common shipping arrangement. 

 If all the oil companies can forge a united front, they get more bargaining power with the shipping companies to bring down freight rates.

 With crude prices skyrocketing, it is important to cut freight through prudent management of ship chartering in order to minimise costs. 

 IOC had last year made out a case to make its own shipping arrangement on the grounds that this would help to reduce its freight bill and improve refinery margins. Freight accounts for roughly 10 per cent of the value of imported crude.

 The decision had to be cleared by the cabinet as it involved a change in the countrys shipping policy, which provided for all shipping arrangements of public sector companies to be made by the shipping ministrys Transchart department.

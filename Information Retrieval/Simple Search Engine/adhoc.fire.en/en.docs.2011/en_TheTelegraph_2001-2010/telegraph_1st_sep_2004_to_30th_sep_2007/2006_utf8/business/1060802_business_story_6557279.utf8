 MphasiS profit dips 30%

 Mumbai, Aug. 1 (PTI): IT services provider MphasiS has reported a 29.74 per cent decline in net profit to Rs 10.65 crore for the quarter ended June 30 from Rs 15.16 crore a year ago. However, total income rose 28.36 per cent to Rs 111.37 crore for the reporting quarter from Rs 86.76 crore in the previous year.

 The group posted a consolidated net profit of Rs 15.16 crore compared with Rs 33.69 crore in the same period a year-ago.

 Consolidated total income of the group stood at Rs 263.65 crore against Rs 225.35 crore.

 This has been a challenging quarter for us with cost increases from salary hikes eroding our margins. This was aggravated by slowdowns at the front-end due to the long process around the open offer, the CEO Jerry Rao said.

 Microsoft puts up a brave front

 Brussels, March 31 (Reuters): Microsoft, sounding an optimistic note, resumed its last-ditch fight on Friday against antitrust fines of up to 2 million euros a day proposed by the European Commission.

 But its competitors, who have their say on the second and last day of the closed hearing, said the US software giants defence against the fines was not sufficient.

 Microsoft faces fines because the Commission says it has not complied fully with a 2004 decision that the company abused the dominance of its Windows operating system to muscle competitors out of the market and must change its business practices.

 In that decision, the Commission fined Microsoft almost half-a-billion euros and ordered it to share information with rivals so that they can make server software that runs as smoothly with Windows as Microsofts own software.

 We had a very constructive dialogue yesterday. In fact I wish we could have had had this type of dialogue sooner, Microsofts top lawyer, Brad Smith, told reporters before going into the hearing on Friday.

 As we head into the second day, I am more optimistic that we will be able to resolve this issue with the (European) Commission, Smith said.

 The EUs executive arm, Europes top competition regulator, has repeatedly said the information Microsoft provided to competitors was unclear or insufficient. An independent trustee in the case has called it totally useless. 

 Microsoft retorts that it has submitted 12,000 pages of documentation, will offer up parts of its vital source code for workgroup servers as well as 500 hours of free technical support from Microsoft engineers to software developers.

 It says it has done more than enough, and is willing to do more.

 Microsofts competitors, including IBM and Oracle, were to take the stand at the closed-door hearing on Friday to explain why they disagree.

 Philips snaps deal with Dell

 Amsterdam, Feb. 20 (Reuters): Philips Electronics said on Monday it had cancelled a global computer-management programme with US computer maker Dell which was estimated to be worth up to $700 million over five years.

 We concluded together that in the current form, it did not sufficiently guarantee success for completion, a Philips spokesman said.

 The companies decided that a global one size fits all approach was not ideal, the spokesman said.

 Dutch computer services firm Getronics NV, which worked as a Dell subcontractor, would not say how much business it lost as a consequence. Rabo Securities analysts said in a note to investors that Getronicss share was estimated at $80 million to $90 million for the five years when the contract was announced in December 2004.

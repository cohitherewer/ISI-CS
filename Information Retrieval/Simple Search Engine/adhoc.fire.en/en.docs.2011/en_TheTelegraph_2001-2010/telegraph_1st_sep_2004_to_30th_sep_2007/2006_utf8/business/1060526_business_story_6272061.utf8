 Guessing game on new ONGC boss

 S.P.S. PANNU 

 New Delhi, May 25: The petroleum ministry today handed over temporary charge of the post of ONGC chairman to the companys senior-most director R.S. Sharma. It also set the ball rolling for selecting a new man to replace Subir Raha.

 Raha, who did not get an extension after completing his five-year term yesterday, leaves behind a young team on the ONGC board who will be in the fray for the top job. Senior officials of Oil India Ltd (OIL) will also be in the running. In fact, Rahas predecessor B.C. Bohra was a former OIL man. 

 Subir Raha, who was formerly with downstream Indian Oil Corporation, got his first exposure in the upstream oil exploration and production sector when he was appointed the ONGC chief. 

 It is expected that senior officials from other state-run oil companies ? IOC, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum ? would also throw their hats into the ring for the ONGC top job.

 Since Proshanto Banerjee moved from Indian Oil to GAIL as the CMD, senior GAIL officials who were in the fray for the top job in their organisation are likely to apply for the ONGC post as well. 

 Rahas appointment five years ago had come as a surprise and caused much heartburn in ONGC. 

 I.N. Chatterjee, ONGCs director (finance), at the time, had resigned in protest and ONGC-Videsh (OVL) managing director Atul Chandra, who was a front-runner for the job, had also made his disappointment with the selection process quite clear. 

 The six directors on the ONGC board are in their mid-fifties and OVL managing director R.S. Butola, who is also in the race, is reported to be the youngest of the lot. 

 If any of them were to take over as the chairman-cum-managing director of ONGC, he would be able to complete the full five-year term.

 R.S. Sharma, director (finance), and A.K. Balyan, director (human resources), were appointed earlier, while the other directors ? N.K. Mitra (offshore), UN Bose (technical), AK Hazarika (onshore) and DK Pande (exploration) ? took over barely a year ago. 

 Interestingly, petroleum minister Murli Deora said today he ``deeply appreciated Rahas competence and leadership qualities, but he wanted a person with at least 3-4 years to the retirement age to pilot policies to achieve energy security for the nation. If this is the case, the government will wave a wide choice.

 However, political lobbying could also play a major role when the top job of the countrys richest corporate is involved. Raha himself was believed to have swung the job through the PMO when the BJP government was in power.

 It now remains to be seen whether the new CMD, who is expected to be appointed about three months down the line, is a seasoned upstream man or someone else.

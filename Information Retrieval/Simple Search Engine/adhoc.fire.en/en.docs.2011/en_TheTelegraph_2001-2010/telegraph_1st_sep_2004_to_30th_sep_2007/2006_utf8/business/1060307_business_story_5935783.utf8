 Mukesh makes a market move

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mukesh: Stock support

 Mumbai, March 6: Mukesh Ambani today took the first major step in the run-up towards a blockbuster initial public offering (IPO), when Reliance Petroleum Ltd (RPL), a wholly-owned subsidiary of group flagship Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), filed the draft prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) for an offering that could raise $1-1.3 billion.

 RPLs offering is likely to be the worlds largest IPO ever made for a greenfield project. Proceeds from the issue will be used to part-finance RPLs greenfield refinery project at Jamnagar, Gujarat. 

 The draft red herring prospectus (DRHP) was filed today with Sebi, RPL said in a statement. 

 The filing came on a day when Reliance Communication Ventures Ltd (RCoVL), the telecommunication company under younger brother Anil Ambanis control, made a smart debut on the stock exchanges.

 RPLs offer is likely to open for subscription in the second week of April. The company had recently mobilised Rs 6,750 crore through a syndicated loan deal. 

 The company is setting up a Rs 27,000-crore export-oriented refinery, with a capacity to process 580000 barrels of crude per day or and a 900000-tonne per annum polypropylene plant at a special economic zone in Jamnagar. 

 The total equity component of the project, inclusive of proceeds from the issue, will be in the range of Rs 11,250 crore to Rs 13,500 crore. The proposed issue is the largest public offer so far in 2006 and will see RILs holding in the company coming down to 80 per cent after the issue. 

 Sources said while the forthcoming refinery would be the sixth largest in the world, its completion will see Jamnagar possessing the worlds largest refinery assets. Products made at this refinery will largely be Euro IV equivalent. RPL therefore hopes to reap huge success in developed markets, including Europe and the US. The refinery will start functioning from December 2008.

 The RPL issue will mark the return of the Ambanis to the capital market after 12 years. It is expected that a part of the issue would be earmarked for Reliance Industries 3.3 million shareholders, though there would be no preferential pricing for them. 

 In 1993, Reliance Petroleum Ltd had raised Rs 2,172 crore to fund a greenfield refinery in Jamnagar with a capacity of 18 million tonnes. A series of expansions followed and the refinery now has a capacity of 33 million tonnes.

 Indian Oil dearer to ONGC than GAIL

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Raha: Looking for synergy

 New Delhi, March 3: Close on the heels of Indian Oil Corporation offloading half of its holding in GAIL (India) Ltd, the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation today said the company might sell its stake in GAIL but would prefer to retain its holding in Indian Oil Corporation.

 We dont have any plans to sell our stake in IOC, but we are certainly looking at GAIL, ONGC chairman and managing director Subir Raha told reporters here.

 ONGC was planning to sell its 4.08 per cent stake in GAIL, as it saw no synergy of operations in the shareholding.

 ONGC has a director on the board of IOC and similarly IOC has a director on ONGC board, which enabled the two companies to have a say in each others management. There is a synergy in their operations, which is mutually advantageous. 

 There is some degree of synergy in our holding shares in IOC, as we have a director on IOC board. GAIL has refused to give us a directorial position and therefore, we see no operational synergy, he said. 

 In GAIL, ONGCs shares represent a mere portfolio holding. 

 Yesterday, Indian Oil sold half of its crossholding in GAIL for Rs 561 crore to repay debt and raise money for expansion plans.

 Raha did not say if ONGC would sell its entire stake in GAIL in one instance or in phases. We are looking at options, he said indicating a sale was possible this month.

 Indian Oil also plans to sell one-fifth of its stock holdings in ONGC before March 31.

 ONGC has about 9.11 per cent stake in IOC and 4.83 per cent in GAIL.

 In turn, IOC owns 9.61 per cent, or 13.7 crore equity shares, in ONGC and 2.4 per cent, or 4.08 crore shares, in GAIL.

 Panna Mukta gas

 The government has allowed GAIL to continue selling gas from Panna/Mukta and Tapti fields for two more years, but will have to pay 20 per cent more price to ONGC-RIL-BG consortium.

 On the intervention of petroleum secretary M.S. Srinivasan, the consortium of Oil and Natural Gas Corp, BG Group of the UK and Reliance Industries has agreed to continue selling 6 million standard cubic meters per day of gas from the fields to GAIL till March 31, 2008 but it would charge $4.60 per million British thermal unit (BTU), sources said.

 GAIL, which currently pays $3.86 per million BTU to the consortium, would have paid $5.7 per million BTU for the gas if the formula prescribed in the field contract was implemented. 

 However, Srinivasan persuaded the consortium to sell the gas at the maximum price it was getting from selling the remaining 4.8 mmscmd of PMT gas.

 Meanwhile, Raha said the consortium was of the view that it did not need an intermediary to sell gas. The government changed the nominee for buying 10.8 mmscmd of PMT gas last year when it permitted the consortium to market gas. GAIL was allowed to sell 6 mmscmd gas to the power and fertiliser sectors for the interim year till March 31, he said.

 Paswan crack at Chiria jam

 Paswan: Stepping in

 New Delhi, July 10: Steel minister Ram Vilas Paswan is likely to intervene in the tussle over Chiria mines between Jharkhand and the Steel Authority of India (SAIL). 

 The iron ore reserves in Chiria are Asias largest and Jharkhand has gone on the overdrive to win back control of the mines from SAIL.

 Paswan, who is now in Japan, intends to fix up a meeting with Jharkhand chief minister Arjun Munda as soon as he comes back. 

 Officials expect the meeting to touch upon other points of conflict between the Centre and Jharkhand. The state is also unhappy with the Centre for ignoring its recommendations while leasing out coal mines. Jharkhand has been trying for long to regain Chiria ownership, which rests with SAIL following its acquisition of the Burnpur-based Indian Iron and Steel Company Ltd (IISCO), the original lease-holder. 

 Top officials said Paswan would try to convince Munda of the futility of indulging in a noisy legal battle. His argument is that SAIL is one of the biggest investors in Jharkhand and a leading employer. SAIL plans to make some Rs 6,000 crore of fresh investments in Bokaro Steel Plant and another Rs 2,000 crore in Chiria itself in the next three to five years. If the situation permits, the investments could go up by 20-25 per cent. 

 Jharkhand is also reportedly unhappy over the way the Centre has awarded coal blocks in its territory, at times ignoring its requests to give priority to investors who want to set up plants here.

 Though coal lease is outside Paswans purview, officials fear this may crop up at the meeting.

 The Centre recently leased out five coal blocks in the state, allocating two to the Jindals, to be mined under an arrangement with other steel companies, one to SAIL, another to Vishakapatnam-based RINL and the fifth to Rungta mines.

 The Jharkhand government had apparently recommended Tata Steel, which it considers a flagship investor in the state, along with a clutch of lesser-known steel makers for these mines.

 The Centres main concern is over repeated attempts by the state to wrest part of Chiria from SAIL and hand it over to private steel majors such as Mittal-Arcelor, Essar Steel and Tata Steel. An appellate tribunal has, however, not allowed this to take place.

 Goodyear feels recast pinch

 Chicago, Aug. 5 (Reuters): Goodyear Tire amp; Rubber Co on Friday posted quarterly results that topped Wall Streets expectations, even as a restructuring and rising raw materials prices lowered profit, sending shares up as much as 9 per cent. 

 Goodyear, the largest US tyre maker, said weak demand for replacement tyres in North America cut into overall sales volume, but revenue rose on higher prices and sales of more expensive tyres, a key part of its long-term strategy. 

 Chief executive Robert Keegan said Goodyear has made progress on its long-term plan to cut costs, but needs to do more and has raised the bar for 2008 cuts above the $1-billion target set last September. 

 North America is clearly struggling, but favourable end markets and cost-cutting actions seem to be keeping international profits relatively healthy, JP Morgan analyst Himanshu Patel said in a note. 

 Net income fell to $2 million, or 1 cent per share, in the second quarter, from $69 million, or 34 cents, a year earlier. Revenue rose about 3 per cent to $5.14 billion. 

 Excluding one-time restructuring items, Goodyear earned 37 cents per share. Analysts on average had expected 18 cents per share excluding items, and revenue of $5.16 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. 

 While the operating profit and cash flow were far from stellar, the stocks substantial decline in the past three months may suggest that some or all of this was priced in, Patel said. 

 Challenges remain

 Goodyear, which is in contract talks with the United Steelworkers in North America, must contend with escalating raw materials prices, high debt levels and pension liabilities.

 In a conference call with analysts, Keegan said Goodyears focus in the negotiations includes production, productivity, pension and health care costs.

 The company has focused on raising prices and selling more expensive tyres to support its key North American tyre operations, where low-cost imports have severely pressurised the lower end of the market. 

 Raw materials costs rose by $210 million, or about 16 per cent, in the quarter from a year earlier, Goodyear said. 

 Raw materials comprise about 35 per cent of the cost of goods sold and include natural rubber, synthetic rubbers derived from petroleum, carbon black, fabrics and steel cord.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Tide Water on ONGC buy list

 S.P.S. PANNU 

 Well oiled

 New Delhi, March 16: The Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) is ready to take over Calcutta-based Tide Water Oil on the basis of the due diligence it had carried out on the Andrew Yule group firm.

 ?The proposal has been submitted to the petroleum ministry and we are waiting for the government?s approval to go ahead with the takeover,? a senior ONGC official told The Telegraph.

 ?Since Tide Water Oil is under the administrative control of the ministry of heavy industries and ONGC comes under the petroleum ministry, an inter-ministerial meeting is scheduled for a smooth takeover,? he added.

 ONGC ?is keen on the opportunity? and expects the government permission soon. 

 The official, however, was tight-lipped over the financial appraisal and the valuation of the company. 

 Tide Water Oil, which is known for its Veedol brand of lubricants, is among the better performers of the loss-making Andrew Yule group. The government has decided to hive it off from the parent and sell it to a strategic investor.

 While Andrew Yule?s stake in the company is 28 per cent, financial institutions such as LIC and United India Insurance hold 14 per cent. The proceeds from the sale will help Andrew Yule turn around.

 The ministry of heavy industries and public enterprises has put Andrew Yule amp; Co on a revival path and plans to allow it to sell its surplus land for raising funds to nurse itself back to health.

 The ministry feels that two loss-making Calcutta-based public sector companies ? Andrew Yule and Braithwaite amp; Co ? should be allowed to sell a portion of their prime real estate on the same lines as National Textile Corporation?s (NTC) surplus land was sold in Mumbai. The proceeds should be ploughed back to the same company. 

 The sale of just five mills had enabled NTC to rake in more than Rs 2,000 crore. It requires Rs 4,697 crore to put itself back on the revival path. 

 Andrew Yule shells out over Rs 500 crore every year as salaries and wages and has an interest liability in excess of Rs 200 crore per annum.

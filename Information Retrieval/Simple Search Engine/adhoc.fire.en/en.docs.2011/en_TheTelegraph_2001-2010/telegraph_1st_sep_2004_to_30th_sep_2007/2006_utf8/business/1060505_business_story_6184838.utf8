 Second stay in IPO scam

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, May 4: Sebis ban against market manipulators involved in the IPO scam appears to be unravelling with Gujarat High Court today staying the directive that barred Saumil A. Bhavnagari ? one of the 85 financiers named in the interim report ? from all transactions in the capital market.

 The stay order is the second obtained by a person named in the report. On Tuesday, the Karvy group obtained a similar stay from Andhra Pradesh High Court.

 There was no word from Sebi on what it planned to do to stem a possible rash of stays against its ban on 24 key operators and the 84 financiers who cornered shares of companies that came to the market with first-time flotations since August 2003.

 The Sebi interim report says the 24 key operators, who cornered the retail portion of the initial public offers, have in turn made further off-market transfers to other entities. This indicates that the operators themselves must have acted as intermediaries for their financiers who appear to be the ultimate beneficiaries.

 Bhavnagari is among 85 such financiers identified by the Sebi report, which also includes Karvy Stock Broking Ltd.

 All these financiers of the master account holders have been directed by Sebi to stay away from the securities market. This means that they cannot buy, sell or deal in the market, including initial public offers, directly or indirectly, till further directions by the regulator.

 According to the details provided in the report, Bhavnagari was the key financier for Roopalben Nareshbhai Panchal for the initial public issues of Suzlon Energy, FCS Software and Sasken Commtech Ltd.

 The Suzlon Energy flotation hit the market in September 2005 and the Sebi report said it was the last one where the modus operandi of using fictitious demat accounts to corner shares was used. The key operators, including Panchal, Dhaval A. Mehta, Purshottam Budhwani, Manojdev Seksaria, Jhaveri Securities Pvt Ltd, Biren Kantilal Shah, Chandrakant Amratlal Parekh, Pratik Mafatlal Shah and Himani N, Patel used 21,692 afferent (or benami) accounts to corner 3,23,023 shares representing 3.74 per cent of the total number of shares allotted to retail individual investors.

 Other than Bhavnagari, other financiers for the issue were Jayesh P. Khandwala HUF, Rajan Vasudev Dapki, Umang R. Shah, Chirag Jayendrakumar Shah and Sheelu Lalwani.

 Meanwhile, Karvy officials said the stay order issued on Tuesday had not been signed by vacation judge Justice G. Raghuram or stamped by the registrar of the court.

 Andhra Pradesh High Court is closed for summer vacation from May 1 till June 2. However, in case of matters of urgency, a division bench consisting of Justice G. Raghuram will hold sittings on May 9. 

 Karvy group chairman C. Parthasarathy said, I am waiting to see the court papers. We will be receiving the stay order soon. Ideally, the judge always signs the order. The court is on vacation now. 

 We are fighting with our back towards the wall, he said. After the order, no retail investor has moved from Karvy but there is a lot of confusion among retail investors.

 Sebi had directed retail investors with demat accounts with Karvy Stockbroking Ltd and Pratik Stock Vision Pvt Ltd to shift their accounts to other depository participants within 15 days of the April 27 order. But there has been little clarity on whether the over 7-lakh Karvy demat clients will need to shift by May 12 now that Karvy has won a stay.

 There were rumours during the day that Sebi had filed a caveat in Bombay High Court but Sebi officials denied such a move.

 According to legal experts, all courts have concurrent and parallel jurisdiction. So, a case may be filed in any high court. The accused or defendants place of residence or business decides where he can file his case. Since Karvy is headquartered in Hyderabad, they have filed the case there, said a lawyer with Bombay High Court.

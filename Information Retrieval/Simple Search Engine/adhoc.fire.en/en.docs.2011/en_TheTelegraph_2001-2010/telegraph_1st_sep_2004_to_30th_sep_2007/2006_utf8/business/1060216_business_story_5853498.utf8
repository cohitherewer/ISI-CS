 New Delhi, Feb. 15: The highlights of this year?s railway budget would be the introduction of cheaper air-conditioned trains to link the metros and big cities and the launch of the first phase of the Rs 22,000-crore dedicated freight corridor project between Delhi-Calcutta and Delhi-Mumbai.

 Railway minister Lalu Prasad today said a number of ?Jan Sadharan? express trains are likely to be introduced to provide comfortable travel at affordable rates to the ?common man?. The fares would be cheaper than the current AC train tickets. 

 He was speaking at the launch of the superfast Delhi-Agra-Bhopal Shatabdi express, which will have a speed of 150 km per hour. The train will reduce travel time between Delhi and Agra from 2 hours 30 minutes to only 2 hours. 

 The new trains would be introduced as a follow up to the 15 ?Smark Kranti? express trains introduced last year. Lalu Prasad will present the rail budget for 2006-07 on February 24. 

 With a coalition government in power, Lalu will have to balance the pulls and pressures of various parties of the UPA alliance and the Left. 

 The ministry has already announced an ?automatic upgradation scheme? for passengers of all Rajdhani trains on a trial basis. This is expected to be extended to other trains too. 

 The move has been conceived in the wake of increased competition from low-cost airlines, which are weaning away AC passengers from the railways. The railways want to check any further increase in this trend.

 The minister said, ?We are already laying the third line between Delhi-Calcutta and Delhi-Mumbai to facilitate faster movement of goods in these sectors.? 

 The freight corridor will add to the infrastructure required for the increased movement of goods. Rites, a public sector undertaking under the railway ministry, has submitted its draft proposal to the ministry.

 The corridor will connect the metros and the major ports of the country.

 Work on the other sections ? Calcutta-Mumbai, Calcutta-Chennai, Chennai-Mumbai and Delhi-Chennai ? is scheduled for the second phase.

 The railway budget may also implement passenger-profile management schemes under which a bogie can be added or removed from trains depending upon passenger traffic.

 The minister may also announce a ?frequent traveller scheme? which would help frequent railway passenger get bonus points. 

 The railway budget is also likely to reduce freight rates to take on competition from road transport.

 It may embark on an ambitious scheme to increase the number of coaches from the existing 14 in most of the trains to 24 in at least 258, senior railway ministry officials said.

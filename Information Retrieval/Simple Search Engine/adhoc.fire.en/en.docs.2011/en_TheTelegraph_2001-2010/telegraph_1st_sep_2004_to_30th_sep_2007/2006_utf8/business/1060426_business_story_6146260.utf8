 Margin move triggers meltdown

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, April 25: The stock market melted today in its sharpest fall since April 12 as the bourse authorities ratcheted up margins in both cash and derivatives segments.

 The bellwether BSE sensex plunged 268.26 points, or 2.25 per cent, to close at 11646.78. It touched the days low at 11621.61. On April 12, the index had lost 307 points.

 The nifty ended at 3462.65, down 86.25 points, or 2.43 per cent. It touched an intra-day low of 3433.55.

 Given the huge outstanding positions in the market, an additional Rs 1,500-2,000 crore will be required in the immediate short-term to comply with the new margin norms, which led to the unwinding of positions in frontline stocks, said Manish Sonthalia, vice-president (equity strategy) of Motilal Oswal Securities.

 While the frontline indices have plunged by over 2 per cent, the mid-cap and smaller stocks have lost only about 1 per cent or so. This is due to the unwinding of big outstanding positions in the heavyweights, he added.

 Also, as the April contracts in the derivative segment are due to expire on Thursday, the operators and traders have reduced their exposure to escape the new margins, he said. The revised margins become applicable from April 28.

 High crude prices also weighed on the market for the second successive day as concerns about inflation rose. According to market observers, crude prices could be a big drag in the near term.

 The surge in crude prices has raised concerns about costs for companies, as India, which buys two-thirds of its oil, has not raised domestic fuel prices so far this year.

 However, we do not foresee a big plunge from here on as the quarterly numbers are in alignment with market expectations. It could witness a correction of about 1,000 points and settle at around 11,000 and then look up again, said Sonthalia.

 The frontline shares had run up too fast and too soon and now the valuation differences has widened significantly between the large and the mid-cap stocks. Now the action can come about in the mid-cap segment, he added.

 In all, the sensex lost 383 points in the first two trading sessions of the week and erased Rs 45,715 crore from market capitalisation.

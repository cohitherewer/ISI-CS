 British Petro pulls out of Bhatinda

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 23: British Petroleum today pulled out of the joint venture with Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) to construct the Rs 12,000- crore refinery at Bhatinda in Punjab. However, HPCL will press ahead with the work on the refinery, to be completed in 2010.

 BP had signed an MoU with HPCL in October last year to set up a 50:50 joint venture to build the refinery and market the products. The high refining margins at that time ? it was $6 per barrel ? influenced BPs decision to pick up a stake in the greenfield project. The oil giant also wanted to leverage HPCLs vast retail network. 

 However, rising prices of crude oil along with the fall in refining margins forced BP to have second thoughts on the project. BP feared that its margins would be inadequate as the government decided to put a lid on petrol and diesel prices.

 Analysts feel multinationals such as BP are interested only in big projects with high margins.

 The 9-million-tonne Bhatinda refinery was one among the 20 projects across the world picked by BP for its potential to generate high profits. The companys other projects are in regions that are flush with oil, giving the MNC an opportunity to make high profits.

 When in India to sign the MoU with BPCL, BP group CEO Lord Brown said he would bring world-class technology in India through the joint venture. 

 He said the marketing of petroleum products by the joint venture would be done under the HPCL brand. 

 BP was also expected to assist HPCL in arranging crude supplies not only for the Bhatinda refinery but also for the Vishakhapatnam and Mumbai refineries. BP has access to vast reserves of crude and gas, given its presence in 100 countries. 

 Though BP wanted to capitalise on the existing network of HPCL, the Indian company was more keen on expanding its retail operations with the money from BP.

 The MoU had provisions on preparing a joint marketing strategy that includes rolling out of retail service stations in tandem with the refinery going on stream in 2010. 

 HPCL is setting up the Bhatinda facility to cater to the north Indian market, which is dominated by Indian Oil. The company has no refinery in north India.

 The plan was to complete the refinery a year ahead of schedule by harnessing BPs technological strength and financial muscle. With BP pulling out of the venture, it appears the refinery will be completed according to its old schedule.

 Essar refinery

 Essar Oil will commission the first phase of its $2.2-billion oil refinery at Vadinar in Gujarat by July and will set up 1,500 petrol pumps for retailing fuel, a senior company executive said today.

 To begin with, the refinery will have a capacity of seven million tonnes, which will be increased to 10.5 mt by January 2007, Essar Oil chief executive Raj Varma said.

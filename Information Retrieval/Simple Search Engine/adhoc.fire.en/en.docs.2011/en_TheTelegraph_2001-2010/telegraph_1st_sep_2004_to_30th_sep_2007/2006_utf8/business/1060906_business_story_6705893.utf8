 Fiat set to shift Kurla operations

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Sept. 5: Fiat is shifting operations from Kurla to the new plant in the industrial development zone in Ranjangaon.

 The decision to shift our production activity from Kurla to Ranjagaon is based on the objective of achieving cost efficiencies by offsetting the locational disadvantages at Kurla, said Giovanni De Filippis, managing director of Fiat India. 

 The company had to discontinue production at its Kurla plant after torrential rains lashed Mumbai last year.

 Mumbai has locational deterrents like octroi and high flooding during monsoons. We also see clear advantages of being in an industrial development zone like Ranjangaon. This will improve Fiats position to penetrate the market even more competitively, added Filippis.

 The development activities at the Ranjangaon plant have gained momentum in infrastructure facilities, utilities services and logistics. The company has also started recruitment to staff the plant. 

 We have also carefully planned the shifting process in order to avoid disruption of supply of cars to its customers, said Filippis.

 The company, which had hit rock bottom in mid-2005, posted a 51 per cent jump in sales in the first quarter of the current fiscal largely due to a stronger service network after the Italian company started sharing dealers with Tata Motors.

 Fiat had sold 657 units in the first quarter against 435 in the corresponding period last year. It plans to introduce, among others, its premium cars for B and C segments, the Fiat Grande Punto and the new Fiat sedan, and its small diesel engine.

 ICICI to mop up Rs 6000 cr

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, July 31: ICICI Bank plans to raise up to Rs 6,000 crore through a combination of hybrid debt instruments and the traditional plain vanilla unsecured bonds. The bank submitted the draft prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Board of India today. 

 ICICI Bank will raise full or part of the amount as and when required, in one or more tranches. The issue will also have an option for over subscription. The bank will decide on the quantum of debt, the instruments through which the money will be raised and the terms before each tranche.

 It has identified six types of bonds ? rate choice, forever, pension, zero coupon, infrastructure and tax savings bonds. However, it may choose to issue more types of bonds after obtaining the necessary approvals. The initial three types of bonds will have the option of hybrid instruments as perpetual bonds for Tier I and above 15 years bonds as upper Tier II debt instruments.The banks capital adequacy as on June 30, 2006, was 12.5 per cent, which is above the Reserve Banks requirement of a total capital adequacy of 9 per cent.

 The banks unaudited capital adequacy estimated based on the RBIs draft guidelines issued in February 2005 on implementation of the revised capital adequacy framework under Basel II norms, would be about 12.8 per cent as on June 30, 2006.

 The countrys largest private sector bank has reported a 17 per cent growth in net profit at Rs 620 crore for the first quarter ended June 30 against Rs 530 crore in the same period last year. 

 Recently, UTI Bank also announced plans to raise close to Rs 1,770 crore through a combination of hybrid instruments and medium term notes. Last week, Dena Bank said it would raise about Rs 425 crore through innovative perpetual debt instruments in Tier I and upper Tier II bonds.

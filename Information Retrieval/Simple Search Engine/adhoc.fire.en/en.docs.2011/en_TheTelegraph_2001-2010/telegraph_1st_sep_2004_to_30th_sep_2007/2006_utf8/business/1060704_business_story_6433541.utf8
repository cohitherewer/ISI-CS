 New Delhi, July 3: Japans Honda Motor will invest Rs 3,000 crore over the next 10 years in India to boost the production capacity of its two-wheelers and cars. The company is also closely studying the small car segment.

 The Indian market is gaining more importance than China in Hondas scheme of affairs. In future, India will be a more important market for us than China, Honda Motor president and CEO Takeo Fukui told reporters here. 

 He listed rising population, high growth rates and democracy as factors that gave India an edge over China, although he expressed concerns over the labour issues in the country.

 The company is looking at consolidating its business here, Fukui said. It is also exploring the possibility of bringing in a new model, smaller than its City ZX.

 Honda is aiming at doubling its annual car production capacity by the end of 2007. Bullish on the growth prospects of Indias car market, Fukui said, Hondas sales in the country is expected to rise 48 per cent year-on-year to 62,000 units by the end of 2006. 

 The company is planning to ramp up the capacity to 1,00,000 units by next year, which will be further scaled up to 1,50,000 units by 2010. Demand is expected to increase further to 150,000 units by 2010, Fukui said.

 Honda will roll out the new Civic tomorrow. The model is expected to strengthen the companys presence in the Indian auto market. 

 Honda is also planning to introduce new models, including a small car.

 Among the worlds growing markets, India is an important business market for Honda and holds a high potential, Fukui said.

 Honda is seriously studying options to enter the biggest segment ? the small cars ? in India.

 We are studying and analysing the largest segment in India. I cannot give out the specific details, Fukui said. 

 If things work out, we will have a separate production unit for small cars, he added. 

 Honda operates four businesses in India. It has a 26 per cent stake Hero Honda, the countrys top bike maker, and 99.9 per cent in Honda SIEL Cars India Ltd. 

 Honda plans to bring down its stake in Honda Siel to 95 per cent by divesting some equity in favour of the joint venture partner. The total scale of Hondas four businesses in India, including power products, is one of the highest by any Japanese company in India, Fukui said.

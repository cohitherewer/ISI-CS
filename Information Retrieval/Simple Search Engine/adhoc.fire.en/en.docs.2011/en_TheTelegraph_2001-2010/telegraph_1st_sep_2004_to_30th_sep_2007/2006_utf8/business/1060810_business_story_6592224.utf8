 GE Ship keeps spin-off afloat

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Aug. 9: Great Eastern Shipping Company (GE Shipping) has sprang a surprise again. The companys board today decided to stick to the plan to spin off its offshore services division into a separate company. The directors today decided to extend the deadline for the demerger. Capital market sources had least expected the company to take this route.

 The board of GE Shipping, at its meeting held on August 9, has unanimously decided to apply to Bombay High Court for an extension of the timeline of the de-merger scheme, which had lapsed on August 2 in terms of the high court order, the company said in a late evening statement. 

 On August 2, despite excellent cooperation from all the contracting counter parties, the process of demerger could not be completed before the deadline lapsed, the company said. 

 At todays board meeting, the directors assessed other possibilities of restructuring the offshore services business and unanimously concluded that it was in the best interests of the shareholders to seek an extension of time from Bombay High Court. 

 The board believes it will be able to obtain the remaining approvals to complete the demerger process within the extension period. After the de-merger is effected, both the companies GE Shipping and Great Offshore will be headed by K.M. Sheth as chairman and will have identical promoters, the statement added.

 Analysts had listed three possibilities that the companys board could choose. Apart from the company not proceeding on its demerger plans, they speculated it could extend the demerger deadline or have the offshore division hived off into a separate subsidiary. However, it was largely felt that the company would not want to extend the demerger deadline. A leading brokerage had even said in a research report that GE Shipping will not visit the option again. 

 The company would rather prefer to turn the offshore services division into a subsidiary as a demerger would have left it to the cyclical vulnerability of the shipping industry.

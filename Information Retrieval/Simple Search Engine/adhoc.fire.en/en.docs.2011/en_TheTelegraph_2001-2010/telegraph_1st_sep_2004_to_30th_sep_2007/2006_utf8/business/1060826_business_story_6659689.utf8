 Troubled times

 New York, Aug 25 (Reuters): Automaker Ford Motor Co is in talks to sell some luxury-auto brands to an investment group led by its former chief executive officer Jacques Nasser, Bloomberg news service reported on its web site, citing four people familiar with the discussions.

 The discussions focus on Jaguar and Land Rover, Bloomberg cited one of the people as saying. The article said the talks are with JP Morgan Chase amp; Cos One Equity Partners LLC, where it said Nasser is senior partner for mergers and acquisition.

 The talks with Nasser, which could result in a joint venture rather than an outright acquisition, dont involve Volvo, the article said.

 Nasser was ousted from his position as Fords president and chief executive in October 2001, amid mounting troubles at the company at the time. His departure came shortly after the company reported a $692-million third-quarter loss on top of a loss in the previous quarter.

 JP Morgan and Ford were not immediately available for comment.

 Ford, based in Dearborn, Michigan, is under pressure to speed up cost-cutting efforts after a $254-million loss in the second quarter of 2006 and worse-than-expected US sales in July

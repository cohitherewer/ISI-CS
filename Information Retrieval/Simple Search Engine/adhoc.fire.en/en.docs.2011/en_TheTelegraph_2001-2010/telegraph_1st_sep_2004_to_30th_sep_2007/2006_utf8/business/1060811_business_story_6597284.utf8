 Rein on insurers to be relaxed in phases

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Aug. 10: The insurance regulator today tried to head off the possibility of an unbridled price war when it gives insurance companies the freedom to price their products from January 1. 

 The regulator unveiled a new set of guidelines that come into effect from September 30.

 The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) said even though price controls would be removed for the existing products from January 1, insurers would not have the freedom to change the scope of coverage and the terms and conditions of the cover till March 31, 2008.

 One of the biggest worries was that as soon as the insurers received the freedom to price their products, they would tweak the terms and conditions of their policy covers creating a lot of confusion in the minds of the consumers a lot like what happened in the world of telecom a few years ago when consumers had to choose from a myriad options.

 We have been clear from the beginning that while we are relaxing the pricing rules, the terms and conditions cannot be changed within 15 months of the launch of the new system. This is being done to avoid confusion at the initial stage, said IRDA chairman C.S. Rao. 

 It is important for an insured to understand the changes brought about by detariffication. If both the rates and the terms and conditions change at the same time, he will not be in a position to evaluate the policies, said Rao.

 Insurers may file, in due course, their proposals for altering the conditions and terms of the policy covers or the wording of the products to be sold after March 31.

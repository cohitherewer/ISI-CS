 RBI given mandate to ensure ample liquidity

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 4: Concerned about the possibility of inadequate credit throttling economic growth, finance minister P. Chidambaram today asked the Reserve Bank of India to ensure sufficient liquidity to the productive sectors.

 I requested the RBI board that there should be ample liquidity and nothing should be done to disturb the growth story, Chidambaram told reporters after the customary post-budget meeting with the RBI board here. I was assured that the RBI will provide ample liquidity to all productive sectors, he added.

 In India, bank credit at present contributes about 30 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP). An average annual economic growth rate of 7 per cent will require additional credit flow of about Rs 100,000 crore over the next five years.

 Chidambaram said the RBI would also work out a system for providing concessional short-term credit to farmers for the coming kharif season.

 The government has decided to provide short-term credit to farmers at 7 per cent up to a maximum of Rs 300,000. This would require a certain level of subvention to Nabard, which the finance minister said, would be given.

 Commercial banks have also been allowed to fix their prime lending rates (PLRs) and given the flexibility of extending credit at the sub-PLR rates. So far, the biggest beneficiary of this has been the housing sector, where the rates are much lower than the banks existing PLRs. 

 However, despite a consistently declining interest rate regime, the farming community had not had access to cheaper institutional short-term funds. Banks and other lending institutions had attributed this to the higher refinance rates. 

 Importantly, co-operatives and regional rural banks source as high as 40 per cent of their lendable resources through the refinance route extended by the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (Nabard). Nabard, in turn, takes recourse to the general line of credit of the RBI. 

 The budget had announced that farmers would be provided with crop loans at a concessional rate of 7 per cent to deal with the problem of indebtedness of small and marginal farmers, in particular. 

 Chidambaram said the RBI board appreciated the efforts unveiled by the government to improve the tax-GDP ratio. Our adherence and commitment to fiscal responsibility and budget management target in the budget was appreciated, so also the efforts to raise tax-GDP ratio to over 11 per cent, he said.

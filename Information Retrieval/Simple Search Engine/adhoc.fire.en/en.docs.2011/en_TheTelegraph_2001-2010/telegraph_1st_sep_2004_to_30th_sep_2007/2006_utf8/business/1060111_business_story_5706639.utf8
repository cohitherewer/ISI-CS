The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Panel prefers AAI for airport update job

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 10: The governments troubles over the privatisation of Mumbai and Delhi airports have increased. 

 An expert committee set up to review the bids has suggested that airports be developed by Airports Authority of India through a special purpose vehicle in which foreign airport developers could also participate. 

 The expert panel, headed by Delhi Metro chief E. Shreedharan, has re-evaluated the bid by Reliance-Mexico and has awarded the consortia lower marks on certain counts. It has, instead, sought to cut down time in developing the two gateway airports by getting AAI to do the work in partnership with foreign airport developers whom they would be free to chose.

 The report by the expert panel put the government in a spot and forced civil aviation minister Praful Patel to hold an emergency meeting with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. The model chosen for Delhi and Mumbai is likely to be followed in developing the Calcutta and Chennai airports.

 Sources close to Patel said the aviation ministry is not too keen on awarding the project to AAI. Instead, it might advise the group of ministers on airports, which is slated to meet on Thursday, to ask all unsuccessful bidders to bid again. 

 The ministry feels since the other successful bidder, GMR-Fraport, has not been re-evaluated, it remains successful. Other unsuccessful bidders, including Reliance, should be asked to bid again to help reach a final decision. However, sources said this may not be acceptable to other members of the GoM. 

 The Congress-led government would like to show some progress in developing these key airports. It is under pressure from the Left to scrap the controversial bidding process, which questions have been raised not only the evaluation process but also on the integrity of consultants to the bidding process.

 Sources point out that even the earlier high level government review committee (GRC) had clearly pointed out the criteria for selection was inherently subjective and there could be variations in findings. 

 The committee said inter-se marking across various bidders for the same criterion based on experience, expertise, commitments etc could be different.

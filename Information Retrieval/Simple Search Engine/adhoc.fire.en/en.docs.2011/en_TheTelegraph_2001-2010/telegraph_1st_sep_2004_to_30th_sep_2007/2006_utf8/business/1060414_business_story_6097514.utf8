 New Delhi, April 13: Riding high on motorcycle sales, the Indian automobile industry cruised to a 13 per cent rate of growth in 2005-06. Passenger car sales, however, dropped to 7.55 per cent against 17.7 per cent growth in 2004-05.

 According to the annual figures released by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM), 8,82,094 cars were sold during fiscal ended March 31, 2006, against 8,20,179 in 2004-05.

 SIAM said the industry recorded a single digit growth in car sales on a high base year. The sharp slide in passenger car sales has been due to the spiralling crude oil prices and the consequent rise in input costs.

 The outlook for the current year, however, appears to be bullish following the 8 per cent excise duty cut on small cars announced in the budget.

 This was also evident by the 23 per cent sales growth clocked by car companies in March as most of them had announced a price cut to pass on the excise duty benefit to consumers.

 Motorcycles sales surged 17.1 per cent to 58.15 lakh units against 49.64 lakh in 2004-05.

 Backed by the governments initiative on rural roads and better connectivity with major towns and cities, improved agricultural performance, upward trend of the purchasing power in the hands of the rural people, the two-wheeler segment continued to post a steady growth, SIAM said.

 Overall, the two-wheeler segment, including scooters and motorcycles, grew 13.6 per cent at 70,56,317 units against 62,09,765 in 2004-05.

 While the moped segment managed to grow 3.1 per cent at 3,32,741 units (3,22,584), the scooter-scooterettee segment saw a 1.5 per cent fall at 9,08,159 units against 9,22,428 in 2004-05.

 Gold, silver lose shine

 Mumbai, April 21: After scaling 25-year peaks, both gold and silver prices today went into a freefall on the bullion market. 

 In line with a weak global trend on profit taking, gold fell by Rs 330 per 10 gram to Rs 9,170, while silver dropped by Rs 3,345 per kilo to Rs 19,605. 

 The sharp fall in the bullion prices largely occurred because the New York Mercantile Exchange (Nymex) raised the margins for gold, silver and copper futures markets which have recently rocketed to all-time and over two-decade highs, bullion analyst Bhargava Vaidya said. 

 However, the sharp fall in silver shows that investors in the metal did not have any long-term commitment in the fundamentals of the metal and quit the market at the sign of a small correction, which snowballed into a major one, said Vaidya. 

 Though international prices of the silver have recovered from the low levels, it will only move forward sharply if there is any news about the exchange traded silver fund to be launched by Barclays, he added. 

 However, gold prices are on a much firmer footing and the correction should see the prices stabilising at these levels and should not dive sharply, he said. 

 Sensex flat

 A day after crossing the 12000-mark, the sensex today yo-yoed 242 points before ending on a flat note. In early trade, the sensex touched an all-time high of 12102.00. However, the index tanked to the days low of 11860.35 after Satyam announced a muted guidance for fiscal 2007. 

 The index ended the day with a loss of 9.25 points to settle at 12030.30, while the Nifty ended flat at 3573.05 against Thursdays closing of 3573.50. The volume of business also eased to Rs 5,050.29 crore from Thursdays Rs 5,296.79 crore.

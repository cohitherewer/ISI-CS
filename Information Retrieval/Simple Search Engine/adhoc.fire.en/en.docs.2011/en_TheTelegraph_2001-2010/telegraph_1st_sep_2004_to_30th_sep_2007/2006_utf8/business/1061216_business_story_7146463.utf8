 Cairn IPO sails through

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Dec. 15: The initial public offering (IPO) of Cairn India Ltd barely managed to get fully subscribed at the close of the issue today.

 The IPO of 32.88 crore shares, which was subscribed 1.3 times on the opening day on Monday, ended with about 36.41 crore bids or 1.1 times oversubscription after a host of investors sought to withdraw their bids apparently on concerns of production delay.

 Qualified institutional buyers bid for a little more than 44 crore shares against 19.72 crore reserved for them. A significant number of these shares were bid by foreign institutional investors.

 However, other investor classes were less enthusiastic about the issue. For instance, in the non-institutional investor category, only 9.62 lakh shares were bid for by companies and high net worth individuals against 3.28 crore shares allotted. Even retail investors bid for only 2.17 crore shares against 9.86 crore reserved for them.

 Investment bankers, however, said the numbers could improve late in the evening when more details arrive.

 They added that the IPO received more than 4 lakh applications in the last day itself.

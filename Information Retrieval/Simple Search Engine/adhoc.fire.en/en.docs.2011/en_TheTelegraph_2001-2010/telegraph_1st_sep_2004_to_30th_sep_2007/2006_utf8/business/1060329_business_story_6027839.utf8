 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, March 28: The Hindujas, promoters of Gokaldas Exports Ltd, are setting up a special economic zone (SEZ) for the textile and apparel industry in Karnataka.

 The Karnataka government, in its clearance committee meeting held on March 24, approved the plan for this 400-acre special economic zone where an apparel and textile park would be set up. 

 The SEZ, which will require an investment of Rs 1,250 crore, would house 50 factories and employ 50,000 workers. This will be the first dedicated apparel and textile SEZ in India.

 According to Gokaldas officials, the economic zone would also include a customs office, banks, an effluent treatment plant, dispensaries, a shopping area, restaurants, a container freight station and a truck yard. 

 The park will have an apparel training centre and a laboratory for testing fabrics and raw materials.

 The park will house accessories manufacturers to cater to the textile-related requirements that include threads, buttons, fasteners, labels and corrugated boxes.

 According to a press statement, the total export revenue from this proposed SEZ would be around Rs 2,500 crore. 

 The SEZ is expected to be ready within 18 to 24 months.

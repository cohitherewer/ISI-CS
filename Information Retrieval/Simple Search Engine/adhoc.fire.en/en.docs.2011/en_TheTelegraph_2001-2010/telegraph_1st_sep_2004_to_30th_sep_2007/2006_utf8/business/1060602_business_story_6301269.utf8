 Prime Focus does a Deccan

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, June 1: Only days after Deccan Aviation extended the date and lowered the price band of its initial public offering (IPO), another primary market issuer followed suit citing poor secondary market conditions. 

 Prime Focus Ltd, whose issue was to close on May 31, extended the date to June 3 and revised the price band downwards to Rs 417-475.

 The price band was earlier fixed at Rs 450 for the lower end and Rs 500 at the higher end. Prime Focus, which is offering 22.22 lakh shares to the public, is expanding both in India and overseas. It is planning to set up digital studios in Hyderabad, Los Angeles, London and Dubai in addition to a camera rental facility and a centre for visual effects and animation.

 The company extended the IPO date despite getting full subscription by May 31. Data from the stock exchanges shows that the issue was subscribed by more than 1.29 times on Thursday. 

 Bids received were to the tune of 28.72 lakh shares against an issue size of 22.22 lakh shares. 

 While retail investors bid for 13.52 lakh shares, a two-time over subscription over 6.66 lakh shares meant for that category, the qualified institutional buyers (QIB) bid for more than 13.53 lakh shares. Mutual funds only bid for 66,660 shares.

 Merchant banking circles associated with the issue said the date was extended following requests from investors. Many investors could not look at the issue due to the downturn in the secondary markets. They wanted more time to evaluate the issue. Therefore, the offer date was extended despite the book being fully subscribed. Sebi rules say that once the date is extended, pricing should also be revised, the source added.

 Reliance Capital, the Anil Ambani group company, has a 14.53 per cent stake in Prime Focus Ltd.

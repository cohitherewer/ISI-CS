 Aramco mulls new refinery

 Riyadh, May 23 (Reuters): Saudi Aramco and US oil firm ConocoPhillips are expected to sign a deal on Wednesday for a second new refinery in the Gulf state, industry sources said on Tuesday. 

 Aramco said it could not confirm the news, which was also reported by Saudi newspapers.

 The state oil firm on Sunday signed a deal with Total of France to build a 4,00,000-barrel-per-day (bpd) export-oriented refinery in Jubail on the kingdoms Gulf coast. Aramco officials have said they hope to sign a memorandum of understanding with ConocoPhillips for another 4,00,000-bpd refinery in Yanbu on the Red Sea coast by the end of May.

 Al Watan daily said the Yanbu project would be similar to that of Jubail, due for completion in 2011 and with 30 per cent of the project being offered to the Saudi public in the future.

 Aramco officials have said each of the refineries would cost around $6 billion.

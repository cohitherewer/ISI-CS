 Anil: Time to change

 Mumbai, May 24: Shareholders of Reliance Communications Ventures Ltd (RCoVL) will meet on June 3 to vote on a proposal to consolidate in its fold the nine units with the company, creating a megalith in which the promoters will have an unshakeable 63.88 per cent stake. The new giant would offer services that cover the entire information and communication value chain.

 To live up to its makeover from a communication venture enterprise to a fully integrated business provider, the Reliance-Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group will also seek permission to change the name of RCoVL to Reliance Communications Ltd ?offering a bouquet of services that span wireless and wireline telephony, international and domestic long distance telephony, voice, data, broadband, Internet and other value-added services.

 The nine companies proposed to be amalgamated with RCoVL are Reliance Infocomm (RIC), Reliance Communications Infrastructure (RCIL), Reliance Communications Solutions, Reliance Software Solutions, Reliance Communications Technologies, Ambani Enterprises Private Limited (AEPL), Reliance Business Management (RBM), Formax Commercial and Panther Consultants (PCPL).

 The share swap deal will raise promoters holding after the amalgamation from around 39 per cent to nearly 64 per cent.

 Promoters now hold 39.62 per cent of RCoVL: 38.27 per cent is held directly and another 1.35 per cent through persons acting in concert. The rest is held by domestic institutions, public and foreign institutional investors. After amalgamation, this holding will rise to 63.88 per cent with the direct stake of promoters being 63.07 per cent.

 RCoVL in a notice to shareholders said it holds less than 50 per cent in RIC, RCIL and Reliance Telecom. ?The ownership interests in these companies do not provide RCoVL with an ability to control all actions that require shareholders approval on account of substantial shareholding being controlled by AEPL, RBM and PCPL,? it said.

 RCoVL said the current structure of holding of Infocomm companies ? RIC, RCIL, and Formax ? is complex. ?The scheme is proposed to rationalise and simplify the structure of holding of Infocomm companies so that there would be an alignment of interests of all shareholders in a single listed entity,? the notice said. 

 The company said a simple and transparent ownership structure would emerge after the exercise, powering synergies among all facets of the telecommunications business. The amalgamation will also eliminate potential conflict of interest and ease considerably related party transactions.

 The new entity will have the ability to leverage on its large asset base, reserves, cash flows, and vast pool of intellectual capital to enhance shareholder value. The company said the amalgamation would offer some competitive advantages to exploit future growth opportunities. The merger would also generate cost savings and economies of scale that would significantly enhance its earnings potential.

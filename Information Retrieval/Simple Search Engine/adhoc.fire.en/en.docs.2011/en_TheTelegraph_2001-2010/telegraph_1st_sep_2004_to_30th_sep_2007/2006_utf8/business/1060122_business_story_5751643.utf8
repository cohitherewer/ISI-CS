 All eyes now on Disney board meet

 Get set, go

 Los Angeles, Jan. 21 (Reuters): Walt Disney Cos board of directors will meet on Monday amid speculation it may buy Pixar Animation Studios Inc in a deal that could revive Disney as the worlds dominant animation studio and give computer pioneer Steve Jobs a powerful new platform.

 Sources familiar with the talks said the meeting was a regularly scheduled board meeting. It was not clear whether the board was prepared to vote on a merger proposal.

 The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that Disney proposed to buy Pixar in a stock transaction worth more than $6.7 billion, making Pixar CEO Jobs its largest individual shareholder and possibly giving the man who also co-founded Apple Computer Inc. a seat on Disneys board.

 Disney, for decades the pre-eminent maker of such hand-drawn animated films as Cinderella and Lion King, has struggled in recent years to maintain its position in an industry that has embraced computer-generated (CG) films.

 The two companies were in the midst of renegotiating their distribution agreement, which expires in June with the release of Pixars Cars, when rumours of the purchase surfaced.

 Disney could not be reached for comment and a Pixar spokesman declined comment.

 Media industry watchers have speculated that the merger talk was driven by Disneys lack of confidence in its upcoming slate of animated films.

 Disneys first CG release, Chicken Little, released November 4, has performed respectably with worldwide box office sales of $279 million, but less than Pixars lowest-grossing film, A Bugs Life, which reaped $363 million worldwide.

 Disney is perhaps revealing a slight lack of confidence to want to mimic Pixars success internally, said Anant Sundaram, a professor at Dartmouth Colleges Tuck School of Business. If that assessment is true, then it is a somewhat unfortunate admission from a once-great company that fundamentally created, and defined this space.

 Analyst Rich Greenfield of Pali Research said in a note on Thursday that the potential deal could signal that Disney was increasingly concerned with its upcoming (internally generated) animated films.

 Disney chief executive Robert Iger pledged in the companys fourth-quarter conference call in November that animation is, and will remain, at the heart and soul of Disney.

 Although Disney has not produced a blockbuster animated film on its own in years, the six films Pixar and Disney made since the 1995 release of Toy Story, have grossed more than $3.2 billion.

 Pixar was on the verge of finding a new distributor for its films when Iger, who took over in October for longtime Disney CEO Michael Eisner, made a priority of smoothing over relations with Jobs, who had publicly clashed with Eisner.

 The Disney board also may approve a buyer for the companys ABC Radio assets, worth an estimated $2.6 billion to $2.9 billion, from among several bidders.

 Sources said on Friday that Disney was within a week or two of deciding on a buyer.

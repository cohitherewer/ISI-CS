LOOSE CHANGE

 Money transfer

 Western Union has launched a scheme for customers transferring money from 

Dubai to Kerala through the company. It has fixed a price of 15 dirham for transferring 

up to $3,000. Western Union is targeting non-resident Indians, especially those 

in the Gulf, who send money to their families in India. NRI remittances contribute 

about 3 per cent of the country's gross domestic product and it is a fast growing 

segment. Western Union's new pricing is valid for six months, from April to September 

this year. 

 New notes

 The Reserve Bank will soon issue new Rs 500 denomination notes. The notes 

will have an insertion of the letter 'L' in both the numbering panels in the Mahatma 

Gandhi series-2005. These notes will carry additional security features. Except 

for the change in the insert letter, the design of these notes will remain similar 

to the notes issued earlier in the Mahatma Gandhi series.

 UTI dividend

 UTI Mutual Fund has declared a tax-free dividend of 40 per cent, or Rs 4 per 

unit having a face value of Rs 10, under its auto sector fund. Unitholders registered 

under the dividend option of UTI-Auto Sector Fund as on April 20 will be eligible 

for the dividend.

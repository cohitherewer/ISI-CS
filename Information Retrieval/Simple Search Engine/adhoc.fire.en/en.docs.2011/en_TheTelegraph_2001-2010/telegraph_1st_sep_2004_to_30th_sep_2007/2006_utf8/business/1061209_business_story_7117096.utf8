 Calcutta, Dec. 8: GSM phones from China, web-based solutions from Bangladesh, software solution from Germany and intelligent electronic products from Taiwan technologies and developers from across the world have converged at Infocom 2006.

 India is a huge market and has a great potential. We want to explore this market and see if there are possibilities of forming partnerships with big local companies, said a representative of Shenzhen Vogue Industrial, a Chinese company dealing in GSM phones.

 Tie-ups and trade opportunities ruled the agenda of international participants from China, Taiwan, Bangladesh, Malaysia and Germany at the venue of the countrys biggest ICT exposition, which assumed a global form in its fifth edition. The international pavilion at the 100,000-sq-ft exhibition is bustling with enthusiasm and activities.

 While companies like Feitian Technologies and Hisense Import and Export are looking for prospective Indian partners, Malaysias Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC) is promoting Malaysia as an ICT investment location. 

 We knew that the Indian market has a huge potential and we have been overwhelmed by the response we have got so far. It was a pleasure talking to people who knew exactly what we were talking about, said Jordan Forssman, sales manager of Armorize Technologies.

 Armorize, which is using source code verification to deliver web applications security solutions, is planning to provide an option of securing the code over the web to suit the small and medium enterprises that are the majority in India to make it economically viable for them.

 We have had people coming in with specific queries, but we look forward to more people from the IT industry interested in software protection and information security during the weekend, said a representative at the Feitian Technologies stall in the international pavilion.

 Bengal sops for green vehicles

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 17: The Bengal government is encouraging people to run their vehicles on green fuel by offering sops. 

 We are offering subsidy to people buying vehicles that run on battery, said S.P. Gon Chaudhuri, special secretary to the state power ministry. However, this is a one-time incentive and we will offer this to 200 vehicles, including two-wheelers, three-wheeler commercial vehicles and private cars to start with, he said.

 People who buy a battery-run two-wheeler, made in India or imported, will get a cashback of Rs 5,000 from Bikalp Shakti Bhavan, the state governments alternative energy department. Three-wheeler buyers will get Rs 10,000, while car buyers will get Rs 15,000 back. The owner has to show the vehicle and its purchase bills and other documents to claim the benefit.

 A Siliguri-based manufacturer 

 is making two-wheelers using Chinese technology which run 

 on battery fuel. A company in Calcutta is also assembling 

 battery-run motorcycles and scooters imported from China. 

 These two-wheelers cost around Rs 27,000, Gon Chaudhuri 

 said.

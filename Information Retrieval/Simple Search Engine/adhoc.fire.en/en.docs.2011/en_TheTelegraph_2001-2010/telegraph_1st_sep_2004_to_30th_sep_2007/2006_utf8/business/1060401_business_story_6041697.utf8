 Pak shipping deal key to tea export 

 SOHINI MOOKHERJEA

 Calcutta, March 31: Indias tea exports to Pakistan will get a major boost once the new shipping agreement is signed between the two countries. The two neighbours have also agreed to help in greater interaction between the tea exporters and importers in order to tap the potential of the Pakistani market.

 Import figures released by the Pakistan Tea Association (PTA) show Kenya is a bigger exporter of tea to that country than India.

 During the recent Indo-Pak trade talks in Islamabad, tea was one of the major topics of discussion. It was emphasised at the meeting that the shipping agreement was crucial for tea trade between the two countries.

 Pakistani tea importers have said that in the absence of a shipping agreement, comparison of samples and procurement of consignments become time consuming.

 Privately bought tea from Mombasa takes three to four weeks to reach Karachi. When it is bought from India, especially Calcutta, it takes eight to nine weeks, said Fahim Khan, a senior official of Tapal Tea, which is one of the big importers of Pakistan.

 Pakistan has imported 4.78 million kg tea from Kenya in March this year while it has bought a meagre 0.79 million kg from India. In February, India exported 0.42 million kg, while Kenyas contribution was 6.82 million kg.

 January was a slightly better month for India when it exported 1.23 million kg tea to Pakistan against Kenyas 5.48 million kg.

 PTA chairman Mohammad Altaf told The Telegraph that a 14-member Pakistani tea delegation will visit India between April 15 and April 22. The team is scheduled to visit Calcutta and Connoor and meet officials of the Tea Board, Indian Tea Association and the United Planters Association of South India.

 Last year, Pakistan imported close to 9.29 million kg of Indian tea, which was just 7 per cent of the countrys total import of 133 million kg brought through legal channels, Altaf said.

 Washington, Nov. 21 (PTI): Kingfisher Airlines has signed a $500-million deal with American aircraft engine manufacturer Pratt and Whitney to power its new fleet of Airbus aircraft.

 The agreement was signed at a ceremony yesterday at the US department of commerce witnessed by commerce secretary Carlos Gutierrez and deputy chief of the Indian embassy Raminder Singh Jassal.

 After a very detailed analysis for all-engine offers for the A330, we decided that Pratt and Whitney gave us the best total solution and met all out technical requirements Vijay Mallya, chairman of Kingfisher Airlines, said.

 Pratt and Whitney was selected to power Kingfishers fleet of A320s/A319s, ATR 72s and A300s because of their ability to support our airlines vision to consistently deliver a safe, value-based and enjoyable travel experience to all our guests, he said. 

 The deal will include 10 PW 4000-100 installed engines, one spare and an optional for an additional 10 engines. Pratt and Whitney will also have a long-term fleet management programme to overhaul Kingfishers PW 4000 engines.

 The total transaction is valued at $300 million plus an additional $200 million if all options are exercised. 

 Pointing to the fact that the Indian economy is one of the fastest growing economies in the world, Gutierrez spoke of the accord being as another building block that will strengthen US-India relations, foster greater economic ties and enhance the ability of both countries to compete in the global economy.

 The commerce secretary said the two-way trade between the United States and India is around $26 billion with the third quarter of 2006 showing a rise in US exports by 24 per cent and a rise in imports by 19 per cent.

 Jassal noted that the agreement between Kingfisher and Pratt and Whitney is one contract but is reflective of a number of things in the bilateral relationship especially in the growth of trade between the two countries.

 The quarterly profits fell despite a 25.81 per cent rise in income (net of excise) during the period to Rs 578.93 crore from Rs 460.13 crore a year ago.

 For 2005-06, the company posted a net profit of Rs 186.78 crore, marginally up from Rs 173.48 crore in 2004-05. 

 The board has recommended a final dividend of 55 per cent, or Rs 5.50 per share having a face value of Rs 10 each. Earlier, Asian Paints had given an interim dividend of 45 per cent, or Rs 4.50 per share, which takes the total dividend payable to 100 per cent.

 The company also announced a special dividend of 25 per cent for 2005-06. The one-time special dividend will be given to shareholders to commemorate the 60th year of Asian Paintss incorporation, the company said in a statement.

 The groups net profit stood at Rs 212.14 crore in 2005-06 against Rs 174.09 crore in the previous year. Total income was Rs 3,053.06 crore compared with Rs 2,606.23 crore in 2004-05.

 The consolidated results for the current period are not comparable with the previous one as they do not include the figures of its subsidiaries, Berger Paints (Malta) Ltd and Asian Paints (Mauritius) Ltd, which were divested in May 2004 and March 2005, respectively.

 Asian Paints Ltd is betting big on the booming construction sector to sustain its sales and earnings growth.

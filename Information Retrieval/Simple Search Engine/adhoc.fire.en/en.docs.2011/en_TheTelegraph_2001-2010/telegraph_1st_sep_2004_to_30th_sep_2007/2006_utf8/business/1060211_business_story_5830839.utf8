 Sun okays demerger

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Feb. 10: Sun Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd will hive off its research and development (R amp;D) activities into a separate company. The Sun Pharma shareholders will receive one share of the demerged outfit for every one held. The face value of the shares of the new undertaking will be Re 1 apiece against Rs 5 of the parent.

 A board meeting on Thursday decided to demerge its R amp;D activities that include new chemical entities (NCEs) and novel drug delivery systems (NDDS).

 The new unit, headed by Dilip Shanghvi, will be listed on the BSE and the NSE after getting the requisite clearances. However, the new entity will not be a subsidiary of Sun Pharma. The demerger will be effected over the next five months.

 Explaining the reason for the demerger, Sun Pharma said over the last few years, it has made substantial investments in R amp;D activities. 

 These investments in innovative R amp;D carry higher risk and often generate higher returns, but over a longer term when compared with the generic pharmaceutical business. We believe that our innovative R amp;D business has a tremendous potential for growth and long-term profitability. After having nurtured it for these initial years, it has reached a stage where it requires a focused organisation. Hence, Sun Pharma intends to re-organise both the businesses and undertakings, a company statement said.

 Sun Pharma said the demerger would also allow independent collaboration and expansion without committing the existing organisation.

 The new company will have the same equity holding pattern as its parent. In addition to around 100 scientists running programmes in NCE and NDDS, assets, including cash and equipment, would be transferred to the demerged company. The board proposes April 1 as the effective date of the demerger.

 Hitachi faces hard times

 Long way to go

 Tokyo, Feb. 3 (Reuters): Hitachi Ltd has posted a 79.4 per cent slide in quarterly net profit on Friday, hit by loss-making hard disk drive operations and a lack of major one-off gains it enjoyed a year ago, but stood by a full-year outlook that exceeds market expectations.

 Hitachis struggling plasma display business, which competes with larger rivals such as Matsushita Electric Industrial. and LG Electronics, also weighed on earnings.

 Thanks to the launches of plasma TV models and a new advertising campaign, our market share sharply recovered in Japan, Hitachi senior vice-president Takashi Miyoshi said. But for overseas markets, there are a lot of areas we need to work on such as the speed and efficiency of the business.

 For the year to March, Japans Hitachi left unchanged its net profit forecast of 20 billion yen ($170 million).

 That would be down sharply from a profit of 51.5 billion yen a year earlier and compares with the average estimate of 18.1 billion yen from 16 analysts polled by Reuters Estimates.

 Hitachi bought International Business Machines Corp.s hard disk drive operations for $2.05 billion in 2002, and targeted the unit as one of its core businesses. But it has been plagued by losses in recent years, battered by low production yields and fierce competition with larger rival Seagate Technology and others.

 That makes for a sharp contrast with Fujitsu Ltd and Toshiba Corp, whose focus on smaller drives used in portable music players and other mobile devices has made the hard-disk drive business one of their profit drivers.

 Hitachi, however, said the hard disk drive units profitability is now on a recovery path, helped by strong sales of 2.5- and 3.5-inch drives, and it cut its full-year operating loss forecast for the unit to 27 billion yen from 36 billion yen.

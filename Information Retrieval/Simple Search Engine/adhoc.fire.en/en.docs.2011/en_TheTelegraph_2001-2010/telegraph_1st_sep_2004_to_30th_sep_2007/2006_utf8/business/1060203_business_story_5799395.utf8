 Cipla, Sterlite weigh bonus

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Feb. 2: Shareholders of Cipla and Sterlite Industries have reasons to cheer about.

 The Cipla board will meet on February 11 to consider a bonus issue, whereas a double bonanza is in the offing for the investors of Sterlite Industries as its directors will consider issuing bonus shares as well as splitting the stock in a meeting on February 10.

 The board of the pharmaceutical company will also consider issuing securities in the domestic or the international market to fund its capital expenditure plans.

 While the exact financial instrument will be decided on February 11, Cipla is weighing the option of either floating global depository receipts or issuing foreign currency convertible debentures. 

 A private placement of shares is also not ruled out. 

 As the news of the bonus issues and stock split trickled in, both the companies saw hectic activity on the bourses today. The Cipla scrip gained 11 per cent, or Rs 48.45, to close at Rs 490.30 after opening at Rs 482 and rising to an intra-day high of Rs 516.50. 

 Cipla was the second-most traded share on the BSE after the State Bank of India as 20.51 lakh shares were transacted, resulting in a turnover of Rs 99.95 crore. Its gain fuelled a rally in the BSE healthcare index, which topped other indices with a rise of around 74 points.

 The stock price of the copper and aluminium maker surged 6.7 per cent to close at Rs 1,397.70 against yesterdays Rs 1309.70. The scrip reached an intra-day high of Rs 1,424 while 320987 shares changed hands on the BSE. The current face value of the Sterlite scrip is Rs 5.

 Sterlite had issued bonus shares to its investors in the ratio of 1:1 in late 2003. Sterlite is a part of Vedanta Resources, the London-listed metals and mining company with aluminium, copper and zinc operations in the UK, India and Australia. 

 In 2004, Cipla had sub-divided the face value of its shares to Rs 2 apiece from Rs 10. Recently, the stock gained prominence due to its third-quarter performance. Net profit in the December quarter spurted to Rs 175.31 crore from Rs 125.67 crore in the corresponding period last year and the total income shot up to Rs 855.07 crore (Rs 637.32 crore).

 For the quarter ended December 31, Sterlite had posted a 74.5 per cent increase in its net profit to Rs 150.24 crore from Rs 86.08 crore achieved during the corresponding quarter previous fiscal.

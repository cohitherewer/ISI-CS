 Shukla: On profit path

 New Delhi, April 26: The Life Insurance Corporation of India today said its first-year premium income grew by 48 per cent to Rs 18,085 crore in 2005-06. 

 The company has reported a profit of Rs 5,800 crore for the period.

 Our surplus (profit) was Rs 5,800 crore in 2005-06, said A.K. Shukla, LIC chairman, on the sidelines of the inauguration of LIC Zindagi Express, an exhibition showcasing the insurers 50-year history on a train.

 LIC collected the record premium by selling 3.17 crore policies during the year ended March 2006 against Rs 12,170 crore collected by selling 2.39 crore policies in the previous year.

 Shukla said Life Insurance Corporations total investment in stocks is likely to increase to Rs 40,000 crore from Rs 34,000 crore at present. 

 The company invested Rs 14,000 crore in the stock market in 2005-06 compared with Rs 10,000 crore in 2004-05.

 Churnings keep on happening, but LICs focus is on building assets through long-term investment in stock markets, he said.

 LIC, which is celebrating its golden jubilee year, has introduced new products in life insurance, pension and annuity. It is planning to introduce a micro insurance product for the rural poor.

 The life insurer has sought the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authoritys approval for the micro insurance product, Shukla said and added that it would be launched soon.

 He said LIC has also requested the IRDA to allow it to partner with more than one general insurer for micro insurance due to the large scale of operations in the country.

 The insurer is talking to non-life insurers in the public sector for an alliance for the micro insurance product that would give a composite life and non-life insurance coverage of up to Rs 50,000.

 It is also planning to launch unit-linked insurance and pension products. 

 Shukla said LIC is targeting a 30-35 per cent year-on-year growth by selling more policies and introducing innovative products in the market.

 He said the company would open 50 new satellite offices this fiscal and recruit more than 3,000 class-II staff.

 The asset base of the insurance major is around 5 lakh crore at present and has 20 crore policy holders.

 London, Sept. 1: Goldman Sachs is seeking to raise $1 billion from its employees as part of the financing of a $10 billion private equity fund, The Times has learnt. 

 The fund, once financed, will put Goldmans on an equal footing with the worlds biggest buyout firms. 

 About a third of the money is expected to be raised from the bank and its employees, with the rest coming from investors in Asia, Europe and the US. The money-raising for the global fund is expected to be completed at the beginning of next year, and the first investments will made immediately after that. 

 The fund will be fifth-biggest raised, behind funds set up by KKR, Blackstone and Permira. The average size of the investments made by the fund will be between $300 million and $400 million. No more than 15 per cent of the fund will be put into a single company.

 Although the private equity division of Goldman Sachs will continue to co-invest with other private equity groups the bank does not want to lead deals the fund will re-ignite discussions about conflicts of interest at Goldman Sachs, which advises many of the worlds biggest companies on deals. Hank Paulson, the former chairman and chief executive, who is the US treasury secretary, delivered a rebuke to private equity bankers in Europe this year, warning them against making unsolicited bids.

 Trade-off twist to Asean talks

 New Delhi, Aug. 25: After a gruelling WTO session, its going to be another round of hard bargaining for India at the Asean free trade talks. At the heart of the matter is the need to shield the countrys own agricultural and industrial sectors from the influx of cheap foreign goods.

 The free trade agreement with Sri Lanka has been posing its own set of problems with the domestic vanaspati industry complaining about excessive duty-free imports flowing in from the island nation. 

 India has now proposed to Sri Lanka to adopt a voluntary export restraint policy for keeping its vanaspati exports at reasonable levels so that local players are not hit. 

 Similarly, the tea industry has been apprehensive about duty-free imports from Sri Lanka. The FTA with Sri Lanka has been criticised on the ground that it has resulted in inferior quality tea making its way into the Indian market for re-export. Apart from affecting domestic tea gardens, it has also damaged the countrys brand image in the international market. 

 Sri Lanka has been asked to check the misuse of the treaty as products such as copper wire (which is not produced on the island) were being routed through it to India from third countries.

 Cooking oil and tea also figure on the Asean list. India has offered fresh tariff concessions on black tea, palm oil and pepper to cover close to 95 per cent of its imports from the 10-member Asean group in an attempt to take forward the ongoing talks for reaching a free trade agreement (FTA). 

 According to G.K. Pillai, special secretary in the ministry of commerce, India had earlier offered tariff reductions for 69 per cent of the items and the offer has now been raised to 94.6 per cent. 

 India has offered to reduce the import duty of refined palm oil from 90 per cent to 60 per cent, crude palm oil from 80 per cent to 50 per cent, black tea from 100 per cent to 50 per cent and that of pepper from 70 per cent to 50 per cent. 

 It had earlier brought down the negative list of goods to 850 from 1,440 last year. Since Asean had protested that India had too many items on its exclusion list, this was trimmed to 560 in the latest round.

 Malaysia, a major palm oil producer, wants further tariff cuts on the product, but India feels this can only be at the cost of Indian farmers and industry. 

 Although the shortage of cooking oil in the country makes it necessary to import the commodity from Malaysia, domestic industry also has to be given a chance to develop its own capacity.

 The timelines for scaling down tariffs have been drawn up keeping this in mind, but Asean nations find the wait too long. It is here again that some tough bargaining is expected. 

 India Inc has advised the commerce ministry that it should not willy nilly rush into FTAs as these could prove harmful for the country. 

 The captains of industry are of the view that countries such as Japan, which produce complementary goods, should be chosen for FTAs instead of nations like China and Thailand, which could flood India with cheap goods that are already made here. This would only damage domestic industry, they added.

 Bids to stay within 535pence 

 VIVEK NAIR

 Mumbai, Dec. 11: How far will the Tatas go if a bidding war breaks out for Corus?

 The Tatas raised their offer price to 500 pence per share and were ruffed by Brazils Companhia Siderurgica Nacional (CSN) on Monday which stumped up 515 pence per share. There are no easy answers to the question, but the pundits reckon that the bidding wont go beyond 535 pence per share.

 At that price, Corus will be valued at little over 5 billion. But it is felt that the Tatas may not go beyond this point, as it could increase the payback period for the group from this investment. 

 Conservative estimates say a payback timeframe of four to five years to Tata Steel if it emerges successful in the war for Corus.

 Typically, the pay-back period ranges from four to five years though it depends on various factors. In this case, a price above 535 pence a share will not be that lucrative as the period may go on increasing, says Anant Katare, AVP, research, UTI Securities.

 Although there is no word from the Tata group as to how far will they go, sources have hinted in the recent past that Tata Steel is unlikely to go in for a protracted bidding war with Corus as it could impact its financials.

 However, a section of analysts disagree. Looking at the revised price announced by the Tata group, it seems that they are fairly serious on Corus. They also will not give up so easily as Corus seems imperative in their plans to be a global steel major, an analyst with a foreign brokerage said.

 In November, Standard amp; Poors Ratings Services (S amp;P) kept its BBB long-term corporate credit and senior unsecured bank loan ratings on Tata Steel on credit watch with negative implications.

 It pointed out that the size of the acquisition and the potential cash outflow that Tata Steel might experience from its existing or revised offer for Corus could have an adverse impact on its financial risk profile.

 However, the global rating agency added that a successful acquisition, can potentially improve the business risk profile of the merged entity.

 Speaking to The Telegraph over the line from Singapore, Anshukant Taneja, credit analyst, S amp;P, said there was no change in its view with Tata Steel upping its offer price for Corus to 500 pence a share.

 Analysts tracking the metal space, agree with the latter part of S amp;Ps view.

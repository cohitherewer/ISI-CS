 New Delhi, April 19: Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) expects the government to hike prices of petrol and diesel by May-end or early June. International crude oil rates touched $72 per barrel today. 

 We hope the government will intervene by May-end or June, considering the present increase in global oil prices and our under-recoveries, IOC chairman S. Behuria said here today. 

 Behuria was speaking at a launch of a loyalty programme for Maruti customers in partnership with IOC and Citibank.

 According to sources, a decision on raising fuel prices was likely after the Assembly elections in Bengal, Assam, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry in mid-May.

 However, while the oil companies are making out a case for a Rs 5-per-litre hike in the transport fuels, the government is expected to go in for a more modest increase of around Rs 1 to 2 per litre, fearing an adverse political fallout.

 Behuria said IOC was losing Rs 80 crore per day due to under-recoveries on petroleum products. 

 On the basis of the recommendations of the Rangarajan committee, we expect some price increase along with some subsidy sharing by ONGC and OIL, he added.

 Behuria said the retail price of petrol was Rs 4-5 per litre below the import parity level. In the case of diesel, the retail price was lower by Rs 7-8. The oil companies were also losing Rs 13 per litre on kerosene and Rs 190 per cylinder on domestic cooking gas.

 It is very early to assess the impact for the whole of 2006-07, but at the present level of crude prices, our under-recovery could be Rs 30,000 crore for the year, Behuria said. 

 This figure would go up to Rs 60,000 crore if the under-recoveries of Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum are also included. 

 Behuria said IOC was expected to maintain profits at the 2004-05 level. While India is still to take a decision on raising petrol and diesel prices, Sri Lanka, where IOC has a major presence through its subsidiary, has increased the price of all petroleum products by 8 Sri Lankan rupees per litre, which works out to Rs 4 per litre in Indian currency. 

 The Sri Lankan governments decision has come as a relief as it will reduce our under-recoveries, Behuria said, adding that talks were still on for working out a compensation formula.

 Lanka IOC has 170 retail outlets on the island country and has a 30 per cent share in the retail market with annual sales of 350,000 tonnes per annum. 

 Petroleum minister Murli Deora is likely to meet finance minister P. Chidambaram next week to discuss a package of tax measures to help loss-making oil refiners. 

 The new package is expected to be based on the recommendations of the Rangarajan committee to slash duties on petroleum products and raise retail prices to cut the losses of the public sector oil marketing companies.

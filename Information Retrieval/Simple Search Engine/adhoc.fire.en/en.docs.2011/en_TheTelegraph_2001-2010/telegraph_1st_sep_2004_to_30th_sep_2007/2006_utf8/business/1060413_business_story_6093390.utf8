 Reliance ropes in Chevron

 OUR BUREAU

 April 12: The oil titans of the East and the West brokered a deal today under which Chevron Corp, the San Ramon, California-based company, picked up a 5 per cent stake in Reliance Petroleum Ltd (RPL) for $300 million.

 The deal gives Chevron the right to raise its stake in RPL to 29 per cent on the conclusion of collaboration agreements between Chevron and Reliance Industries Ltd, RPLs parent.

 Sources said the agreements could be sewn up within a year and that Chevrons investment would then rise to around $2 billion, making it one of the biggest foreign direct investments (FDI) in the country.

 The deal was reached just a day before Reliance Petroleum comes out with a blockbuster flotation through which it will offer 45 crore shares to retail investors.

 Reliance Petroleum is setting up a greenfield refinery in Jamnagar with a 580,000 barrels per day crude refining capacity. The refinery is expected to begin operations in December 2008.

 We are very pleased to have forged this relationship with Reliance ? which has excelled in the execution of world class projects. This underscores the importance of Asia to Chevron generally, and India specifically. I look forward to working with Reliance in the development of the new refinery and jointly pursuing additional opportunities, Chevron chairman and CEO Dave Reilly said in a statement flagged on the companys website.

 Chevrons stake purchase in RPL has been made through a Singapore-based wholly-owned subsidiary, Chevron India Holdings Pte Ltd. The purchase is subject to approvals from the regulatory authorities, Reliance Industries said in its public announcement.

 If Chevron acquires additional equity, this will rank as one of the largest investments from any multinational company in a single project in India, the statement said.

 However, on paper at least, Poscos investment of $12 billion in its proposed steel project in Orissa will probably rank higher.

 Reliance and Chevron also signed two memoranda of understanding. The first MoU sets out the principles of the partnership under which RIL and Chevron plan to optimise the crude supply and product offtake and marketing of the RPL refinery.

 The agreement and MoUs between Chevron and Reliance will be the first step in establishing a strong partnership with one of the worlds largest and most respected companies. I am happy that Chevron has taken the significant first step in participating in the growth story of India as a refinery destination in the world, Mukesh Ambani, chairman and managing director of RIL, said.

 Sources said the deal with Chevron will help Reliance tie up its western markets with the possible sale of gasoline to the US and diesel to Europe. Under the MoU, RIL and Chevron will jointly evaluate the application of mutually selected refinery technology. 

 The second MoU between the two partners is pregnant with possibilities and envisages collaboration on a grander scale. The statement was pretty terse on the subject and merely said the two companies would collaborate in other areas in the energy value chain. 

 The government has just announced plans to offer 55 oil and exploration blocks under the sixth round of bidding under the new exploration licensing policy. It is widely expected that Chevron and Reliance Industries will bid for some of the blocks on offer.

 Earlier in the day, Reliance Petroleum held a pre-launch press conference in Delhi for its initial public offering (IPO). 

 The issue will open tomorrow and close on April 20. RPL shares will start trading on the bourses in the first week of May.

 RIL executive director Nikhil Meswani said the new 27 million tonnes per annum project along with RILs existing 33 MTPA refinery would make the Jamnagar complex in Gujarat the biggest refining facility in the world.

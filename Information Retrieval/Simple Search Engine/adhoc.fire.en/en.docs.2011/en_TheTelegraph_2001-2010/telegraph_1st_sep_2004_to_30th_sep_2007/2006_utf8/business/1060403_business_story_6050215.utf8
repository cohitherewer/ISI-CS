 Turnover peaks on commodity exchange

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, April 2: The Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) registered a record turnover of Rs 11,626.33 crore at the close of trading on March 30. A strong bullion market, which on the same day clocked business worth Rs 9,497.54 crore, helped the MCX reach the top. The commodity exchange had previously recorded a peak turnover of Rs 8,587.55 crore on January 20.

 A higher interest in gold saw 83.88 tonnes of the yellow metal traded on the exchange on March 30, with an open interest of 11.07 tonnes. The open interest position is reported on a daily basis, reflecting the increase in the quantity contracted.

 Another precious metal, silver, also saw an increased demand with 2206.44 tonnes of it traded on the same day on the MCX, which reported an open interest position of 469.16 tonnes. 

 The MCX has recently announced a strategic partnership with Bursa Malaysia Derivatives Berhad, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bursa Malaysia Berhad. The two exchanges have signed a memorandum of understanding to work together for developing the commodities market in both the countries, cross-listing products and exploring other business opportunities.

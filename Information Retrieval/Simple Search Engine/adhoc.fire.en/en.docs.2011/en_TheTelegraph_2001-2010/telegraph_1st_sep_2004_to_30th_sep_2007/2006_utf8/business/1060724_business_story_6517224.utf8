 Yen FDI set to rise three-fold

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, July 23: The government expects Japanese investment in the country to increase three-fold to touch the $600-million mark this year, up from $200 million last year. 

 We have strong indications from various Japanese firms that many of them are seriously looking at India to make financial commitments... We expect FDI investment in the country to step up to $600 million from $200 million, Ajay Dua, secretary of the department of industrial policy and promotion, said.

 He said about 21 firms have started making serious efforts to invest in the country and a few of them have already announced their investment plans.

 Talking to reporters after the inauguration of Japan External Trade Organisations (JETRO) business support centre here, Dua said in the next three years the FDI inflow from Japan will add up to about $2 billion.

 The government is planning to allow the setting up of Japanese townships in India to facilitate investments by small and medium enterprises from Japan.

 A memorandum of understanding was signed between the Rajasthan government and JETRO to set up an industrial township spread over 1,000-1,500 acres.

 Japanese company Mitsui has already consulted with Indian developers to set up such a city, Dua said.

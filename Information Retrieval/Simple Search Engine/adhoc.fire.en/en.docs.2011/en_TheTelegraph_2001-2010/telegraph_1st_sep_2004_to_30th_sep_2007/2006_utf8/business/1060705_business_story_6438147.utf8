 One more criminal case against Lodha

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 4: The Birla camp today made another criminal complaint against Rajendra Lodha in a city court, alleging forgery and falsification.

 The case was filed on behalf of Rameshwara Jute Mills Ltd, a company formerly managed by Lodha.

 The Lodha camp, however, said the case was filed under petty and frivolous grounds.

 Apart from Lodha, seven other senior officials from his key groups, including S.N. Prasad, S.K. Daga, Ramesh and Krishna Damani, were named in the com- plaint.

 After taking cognisance of the matter, chief metropolitan magistrate (CMM) Jaladhar Mandal issued summons and transferred the case to the court of 12th metropolitan magistrate. The next date of hearing has been fixed on August 7.

 Lodha aides had been accused under sections 120B (criminal conspiracy), 406, 409 (criminal breach of trust), 465, 467, 471 (forgery and using forged documents), 477 A (falsification of accounts) and 201 (causing disappearance of evidence) of the Indian Penal Code.

 They were accused of committing these crimes while acting at the behest of and for the ultimate benefit of Lodha, an argument his aides rejected.

 This is part of the Birla strategy to hassle and engage Lodha in a multi-pronged battle over the will of Priyamvada Birla, a Lodha confidant said.

 According to the Lodha camp, the case was filed on grounds like surrender of a one-table-space office taken on rent, discarding of a seven-year old computer and printer owned by the company, clerical mistakes in issuing cheques not more than Rs 10,000 and clerical mistakes in preparing vouchers.

 They said Lodha was neither a director nor did he hold any share in the company.

 The reins of Rameshwara Jute Mill were wrested by the Birlas from the MP Birla group, which had been under the control of Lodha since the death of Priyamvada Birla in June 2004.

 Appearing for the company, advocate-general Balai Roy submitted before CMM that the alleged offences had come to light after the present management took over the reins after the AGM on September 29, 2005.

 Almost two years ago, the bitter legal battle for the control of Rs 5,000 crore worth of assets of the MP Birla group started between the Birlas and the Lodhas. 

 At present, more than half-a-dozen cases, including a criminal case, are pending at various stages.

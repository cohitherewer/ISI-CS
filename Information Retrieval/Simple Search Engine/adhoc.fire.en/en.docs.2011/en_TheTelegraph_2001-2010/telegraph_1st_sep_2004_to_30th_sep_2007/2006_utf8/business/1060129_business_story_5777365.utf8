 Nilachal Ispat gasping for breath

 DEBABRATA MOHANTY 

 Bhubaneswar, Jan. 28: Production has come to a near halt at Nilachal Ispat Nigam Ltd after over 150 people blocked the three main gates of the steel company on Friday night, giving a new twist to the current industrial strife in Orissa.

 Nilachal Ispat is situated in the Kalinga Nagar industrial complex and these people, who lost farm land and homestead because of the project, are demanding jobs in the public sector steel company. 

 The 13000-acre industrial complex in Jajpur, housing about a dozen proposed steel units, including the ones by the Tatas and the Jindals, has been on boil since January 2 when 12 tribals were killed in police firing while opposing the land acquisition by Tata Steel. Since then the grieving tribals have blocked the Daitari-Paradip Expressway, choking Orissas mineral lifeline. 

 Taking a cue from them, over 150 people from 50 families displaced by the 1.2 MTPA pig iron unit of NINL came in droves around Friday midnight and squatted before the two main gates of the company demanding jobs in lieu of the loss of land. 

 By then the C-shift employees of the plant had joined their duties. The agitators didnt allow the 250-odd employees, who completed their duties in the morning, to leave the premises. The agitators also closed the only gate near the railway sidings through which the iron ore fines find their way into the plant. 

 The exasperated plant officials sought the help of the Jajpur district administration to remove the blockade, but it was of no avail. 

 The blockade effectively stopped all entry and exit to the plant while sounding the death knell for the doddering plant that is yet to graduate to a steel-making unit.

 NINL has about 2000 employees, including 800 outsourced people. When the blockade started yesterday night, there were about 250 employees inside. With a depleting workforce, the NINL management decided to cut production and switched off the sinter plant. 

 With talks between the officials and the agitators flopping, the NINL management is planning to switch off the blast furnace tonight. I am trying my best to run the plant for as many hours as possible. But if the blockade is not called off by 10 pm we would have no other way but to stop production, Nilachal Ispat MD S. K. Sarna told The Telegraph. Sarna is now in New Delhi to attend the NINL board meeting. 

 Though the plant has iron ore inventory for the next five days and coal for the next 25 days, Sarna said he would not be able to run the plant with only 250 people. 

 The NINL plant, built in the early nineties over 2500 acres had displaced 639 familes. The Rs 1400-crore plant, a joint venture between MMTC and the Orissa government had then signed a pact to provide one job to each of the displaced families. But the company management could give jobs to only 330 displaced people as the plant has very little money to run its day-to-day operations.

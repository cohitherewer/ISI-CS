The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 ITC ties up with Marubeni

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Dec. 25: ITC has joined hands with Japans Marubeni Corporation to develop agri businesses in India and abroad.

 Under the arrangement, the companies will jointly promote Indian agri products in select overseas markets and also export them in the short term.

 They will also consider building warehouse infrastructure such as silos and create logistics solution for food grains within India.

 S. Sivakumar, chief executive of the international business division of ITC, said the two companies would focus on grains, oilseeds and mango.

 Marubeni has a strong presence in far-eastern and Southeast Asian markets Japan, China, the Philippines and Vietnam.

 The companies will jointly promote Indian products in these areas, he told The Telegraph.

 Incidentally, ITC already has a strong relationship with Marubeni. The $27.7-billion Japanese powerhouse, with interests in trading to infrastructure, is one of the largest customer of ITCs international business division, which clocked a turnover of Rs 1,500 crore last year.

 The tie-up will further strengthen the relationship between the companies through joint promotion of local agri products abroad and exploring opportunities within India.

 The tieup may also open up a new export market for Bengals mango. ITC plans to carry out sample studies for mangoes procured from various parts of the country in Japan and start exporting too.

 The mango market in Japan opened up last year. We are keen to tap the opportunity, Sivakumar added. 

 Apart from Marubeni, US food company Cargill and Germanys Toepfer are some of ITCs bigger customers of agri products. It is to be seen whether there could be more such arrangements in future.

 The ITC-Marubeni agreement comes close on the heels of the visit of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to Japan earlier this month when he sought more investment from Asias largest economy.

 ITC exports soyameal, basmati and non basmati rice, wheat, pulses, coffee, black pepper, sesame seeds, groundnuts, castor oil, shrimps and prawns and processed foods, mango, papaya and guava products.

 ITCs strength in this business is the extensive backward linkages it has established with Indian farmers. 

 This networking with the farming community, mainly through the e-choupal system, has enabled ITC to build a cost effective procurement system. 

 ITCs agri business is about Rs 3,000 crore. Sivakumar said both companies would undertake a feasibility study for building logistic infrastructure and warehousing in India but it was not decided whether Marubeni would invest in them.

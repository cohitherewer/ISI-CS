 Reliance tag likely on Anil share outfits

 CHANDRALEKHA TULAL 

 Mumbai, March 19: The retail broking arm of the Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group (ADAG) plans to shed its original name, R Trade, and inherit the Reliance identity. 

 The commodities division of the firm has already changed its name from R Trade Commodities to Reliance Commodities on March 14. R Trade Securities and R Trade Financial Services, are waiting for the nod from regulatory authorities.

 We are doing this to align the image of the broking arm with the overall brand image of the group, Sudip Bandopadhyay, head of R Trade Securities, said. Promoted by Reliance Capital, R Trade Securities has Reliance Commodities and R Trade Financial Services under its fold. The retail broking outfit, which is expected to go onstream by June, is recruiting heavily and plans to have a team of 400 by May. 

 In the meantime, Reliance Commodities has tied up with M.S. Swaminathan Research Foundation to give real-time information on commodities in rural regions. 

 The agreement will enable Reliance Commodities to reach out to village resource centres (VRCs) and village knowledge centres (VKCs) in Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Orissa, Andhra Pradesh and Pondicherry. 

 R Trade has also joined hands with the global information company ? Dow Jones ? to outsource news and national and global business content. Clients will be able to access DJ news, which is a subscription-based service. 

 R Trade Securities trade on the Bombay Stock Exchange and the National Stock Exchange. It is also a member of the Central Depository Services. 

 The commodities broking firm has memberships of the National Commodities and Derivatives Exchange, Multi Commodity Exchange and National Muti Commodity Exchange. 

 R Trade Financial Services has registered itself with the Reserve Bank of India as a non-banking financial company.

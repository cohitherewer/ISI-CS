 Kokilabens stake in RIL quartet goes to Anil

 Calcutta, Feb. 7 (PTI): The Mukesh Ambani group today said it had transferred all the 12 per cent shares of mother Kokilaben in the four new companies carved out of Reliance Industries to the Anil Ambani group.

 The shares were transferred according to the power of attorneys given to the Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group under the settlement of ownership issues reached in June 2005, sources in Mukeshs group said.

 The transfer of shares came ahead of the meeting of the boards of the four companies ? Reliance Energy Ventures, Reliance Natural Resources, Reliance Communication Ventures and Reliance Capital Ventures ? for reconstitution and handing over the companies to Anils group.

 Kokilaben was in Porbander in Gujarat performing puja over the past few days.

 The Ambani brothers got engaged in a renewed battle over giving effect to the ownership settlement brokered by their mother last year. 

 The battle between the Ambani siblings started again when Mukesh and Anil along with mother Kokilaben were offering prayers at Bhai Ramesh Ojahs ashram on February 4, ashram officials in Porbander said. 

 Earlier, Anils group had questioned the delay in transfer of shares belonging to mother Kokilaben to the group. But Anils side admitted to receiving the quota of shares due to it.

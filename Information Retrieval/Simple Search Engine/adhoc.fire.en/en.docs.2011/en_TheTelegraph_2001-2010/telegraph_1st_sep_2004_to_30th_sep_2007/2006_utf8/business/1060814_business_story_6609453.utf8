 Jury still out on Posco port feasibility

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 13: Poscos plan to set up a port at Jatadhari is still not out of the woods as the shipping ministry is yet to receive a report on the possible environmental impact of the project.

 Shipping secretary A.K. Mahapatra told The Telegraph that the Centre would give its clearance only if the study on the environmental consequences of the proposed port rules out any adverse impact on the neighbouring Paradip port.

 Mahapatra said, The shipping ministry welcomes the creation of additional port capacity as it is required in the country. However, this cannot be at the cost of damaging the infrastructure that has already been built.

 At present, there are some apprehensions that there could be a negative impact on the Paradip port, he said. However, if a scientific study proves that there would be no adverse fallout, the government would clear the Posco port project, he added.

 The study being carried out by CWPRS was expected to be completed in July. However, owing to some delay, it will now be submitted some time this month.

 The breakwaters constructed for the Paradip port have led to oceanographic changes in its vicinity. The normal ocean currents appear to have been affected and there has been an erosion of the Orissa coastline north of the Pradip port. Soil accretion has taken place along the shore south of the port.

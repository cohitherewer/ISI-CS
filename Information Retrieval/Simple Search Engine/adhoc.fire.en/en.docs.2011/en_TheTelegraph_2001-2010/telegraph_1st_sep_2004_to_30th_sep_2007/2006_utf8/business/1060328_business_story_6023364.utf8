 Emkay ready to tap market for expansion

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 27: Mumbai-based Emkay Share and Stock Brokers Ltd will tap the capital market with its maiden public offering of 62,50,000 fresh shares. The proceeds will fund expansion at home and abroad and meet the working capital requirement.

 The issue, which opens on March 31 and closes on April 7, aims to mop up between Rs 62.50 crore and Rs 75 crore at a price band of Rs 100-120. While 21,17,500 shares have been set aside for retail investors, institutional investors and high networth individuals can buy up to 39,32,500 units.

 Emkay operates through 17 branches and 24 franchisee outlets and caters to institutional clients. It is now shifting its focus to retail investors for which the company plans to increase its branch/franchisee network to 100 in the next two years. It will also set up six regional offices.

 Besides, the brokerage house plans to open offices in Dubai and Singapore over the next two years to cater to more NRI clients, private equity and foreign institutional investors from the West and South Asian countries. 

 We will open one office in Dubai in 2006-07 and one in Singapore in 2007-08, said Krishna Kumar Karwa, managing director and promoter of Emkay Share and Stock Brokers.

 The branch expansion expenses have been estimated at Rs 15 crore, a part of which will be funded by the IPO proceeds.

 The company also proposes to invest Rs 25 crore in two subsidiaries incorporated recently. In January, it floated a wholly-owned subsidiary ? Emkay Commotrade Ltd ? to carry out broking activities in the MCX and NCDEX. The commodity broking is carried out by Emkay Corporate Services, another group company. Emkay Commotrade will either take over the brokerage membership from Emkay Corporate Services or will go in for a new one.

 The brokerage firm has also earmarked Rs 20 crore for investment in Emkay Fincap Ltd, its non-banking finance subsidiary formed last June for margin money financing in stock trading.

 Emkay Share and Stock Brokers requires Rs 42.35 crore more as the margin capital to carry out an increased volume of trade.

 Panel to seek legal advice on Balco

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 12: The core group on disinvestment, which met here today, will seek the law ministrys advice on the legal fallouts of accepting its earlier stand on Balco selloff.

 Some time back, Sterlite had sent a cheque for Rs 1,098.89 crore to the government, asking it to hand over the rump 49 per cent stake in Bharat Aluminium Company Ltd (Balco).

 The government had sought legal counsel and was told the shareholders agreement, which it had signed to sell the remaining 49 per cent to Sterlite, had no legal bindings under the companies act.

 Several ministries feel that under these circumstances, it would be better to go in for a public issue instead of a negotiated sale at prices that may be on the lower side.

 According to reports, Sterlite had sent a legal notice to the government seeking to implement the shareholders agreement signed when it had bought a 51 per cent stake in Balco for Rs 550 crore. The pact said the government would have to sell the shares to Sterlite after the lapse of a certain time period. 

 However, the original selloff, which was attacked in Parliament by Congress leaders as a typical case of a sell-out of a national asset at extremely low prices, raised a controversy.

 Earlier this year, the core group on disinvestment had asked the law ministry to certify the validity of the option being sought by Sterlite to buy Balco shares.

 SBI Caps had evaluated Balcos rump shares at Rs 101.65 a share with the help of Dalal Mott MacDonald (DMM). However, this price was considered too low by many within the core group, and questions were raised on DMM having worked on behalf of ABN Amro to fund Sterlites Korba operations. 

 Minister of mines Sis Ram Ola was also told the valuation was too low, especially as Sterlite Industries was quoting on the bourses at around Rs 1,400 a share. The Balco stock, therefore, should not cost less than Rs 1,000 a share. With aluminium futures ruling at all time high, Balco shares are expected to actually appreciate.

 To compound the problem for the Congress-led government, Left leaders have opposed the sale. With secretaries also divided on the issue, the selloff plans may go into cold storage.

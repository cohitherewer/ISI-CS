 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 1: Honda Motor India (HMI), Japanese carmaker Hondas 100 per cent subsidiary, today began its operations. The company will cater to spare part requirements of all Honda group companies.

 However, Hondas biggest joint venture subsidiary in India, Hero Honda, is not part of the arrangement at the moment.

 The company said, It will study the possibility of establishing a similar relationship with the fourth Honda company, Hero Honda Motors Limited, in the near future. 

 Hero Honda is a joint venture company, in which Honda and the Munjals hold 26 per cent stake each.

 HMI, which has started operations from its corporate office in Greater Noida (near Delhi), has invested Rs 15 crore. The company targets a turnover of Rs 180 crore for 2007-08.

 The plan to set up HMI was first announced in July this year by Takeo Fukui, president and CEO of Honda Motor Company, during his visit to the capital.

 HMI is part of the overall strategy to strengthen and integrate operations of Honda companies in India with respect to spare parts, an official release said.

 Twin steps to boost banking

Leeway for State Bank, RBI gets more teeth

 New Delhi, March 23: Giving a fillip to banking reforms, the Union cabinet today approved proposals that allow State Bank to raise more funds by selling stakes in associate banks and give more regulatory powers to the RBI.

 While the proposal to amend the State Bank of India (Subsidiary Banks) Act, 1959 will give greater financial autonomy to members of the SBI family, the one suggesting changes to the Banking Regulation (Amendment) Bill, 2005 will help the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to monitor reforms effectively.

 The amendments to the SBI act will allow the countrys number one bank to raise more funds by selling stake in its seven subsidiaries. The amendments also give the subsidiaries greater exposure to capital markets, by letting them do the decision-making as when to raise funds and facilitating greater liquidity in their shares on the bourses. SBI owns between 75 per cent and 100 per cent in its associate banks ? State Bank of Patiala, State Bank of Bikaner and Jaipur, State Bank of Hyderabad, State Bank of Travancore, State Bank of Mysore, State Bank of Indore and State Bank of Saurashtra.

 The provisions in the SBI (Subsidiary Banks) Act, 1959 do not offer any scope for uniformity in the authorised capital of the associates.

 However, the act allows SBI to authorise a subsidiary bank to increase or reduce its authorised capital. The bank must take prior RBI approval in this regard.

 The provisions also stipulate that the authorised capital of the subsidiaries shall be divided into shares of Rs 100 each, with individual investor holding a maximum of 200 shares.

 Analysts feel the amendments may raise this share limit, giving the subsidiaries more room to raise funds. The amendments will also raise the liquidity of the shares on the bourses. The analysts are also taking a call on the reduction in the face value of equity shares from Rs 100 to Rs 10 or less.

 The changes may pave the way for public offers by the seven subsidiary banks, of which four are unlisted ? State Bank of Hyderabad, State Bank of Indore, State Bank of Saurashtra and State Bank of Patiala.

 By divesting its stake in the subsidiaries, SBI will get the opportunity to raise capital to fund its expansion plans and meet provisioning requirements. 

 The amendment to the existing provisions will enable subsidiary banks of State Bank of India to attract a large number of small individual investors, a finance ministry official said.

Reserve Bank 

 The Cabinet today approved amendments to the Banking Regulation (Amendment) Bill, 2005, giving greater operational flexibility and regulatory powers to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

 After the Cabinet meeting, parliamentary affairs minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi said the provisions in the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 were inadequate vis-?-vis reforms in the financial sector. 

 The amendments to the act will let the RBI formulate policies and give directions to monitor reforms. A bill will now be introduced in Parliament

 The Banking Regulation (Amendment) Bill, 2005 was introduced in the Lok Sabha on May 13, 2005 after which it was referred to the standing committee of parliament on finance for its suggestions. 

 The cabinet also approved another amendment, allowing changes in the Reserve Bank of India (Amendment) Bill, 2005 to modify the definitions of repo and reverse repo and bring them in line with the usage of the two terms globally. 

 This amendment was based on the very first recommendation of the standing committee.

 Naik: High stakes

 Mumbai, June 7: Larsen amp; Toubro (L amp;T) today joined the bonus bash, declaring a 1:1 issue. 

 However, the companys scrip took a severe beating on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) today as equities were in a bear hug. The L amp;T scrip was one of the biggest losers on the bourse. The bonus announcement came after trading hours.

 L amp;T lost Rs 140.35, or 7 per cent, to close at Rs 1,988.30. The company announced on May 25 that its board would meet today to discuss the bonus issue. Institutional investors, comprising mutual funds and UTI, banks/financial institutions, insurance companies and FIIs, hold 55.47 per cent of the company, while minority shareholders have a 22.45 per cent stake. This apart, private corporate bodies own 2.64 per cent. The rest of the shareholding is split between L amp;Ts welfare foundation and others.

 L amp;T said shares that will be allotted on exercise of options granted under the Employees Stock Option Scheme and on conversion of outstanding foreign currency convertible bonds before the record date will be entitled to receive the bonus.

 The company added that it has also allotted more than 6 lakh shares to those employees who had exercised their options under the companys ESOP scheme. Owners of these shares will also get dividend for the year ended March 31, 2006.

 L amp;T recently informed the National Stock Exchange (NSE) that some of its directors were allotted shares under the ESOP scheme. These include chairman amp; managing director A.M. Naik, who acquired 50,000 equity shares on May 25. The shareholding of Naik after the acquisition is over 4.31 lakh, aggregating to 0.312 per cent of the total paid up capital of L amp;T. 

 The other directors who were allotted shares included J.P. Nayak, whole-time director, who acquired 27,500 equity shares; and Y.M. Deosthalee, whole-time director, who acquired 27,500 equity shares. The shareholding of Deosthalee after the acquisition rose to 2,38,168, aggregating to 0.172 per cent of the total paid-up capital.

 L amp;T recently declared a net profit of Rs 466.85 crore for the quarter ended March 31, 2006, a 40 per cent jump from Rs 333.68 crore in the corresponding period last year based on a strong order book. Total income of the company increased 8.70 per cent to Rs 4,744.97 crore from Rs 4,364.95 crore in the same period last year.

 The company, buoyed by the strong economic fundamentals and capacity creation prospects across all core sectors in the near term, expects a 20-25 per cent growth in its order book for the year. Revenues are also expected to grow in the same range.

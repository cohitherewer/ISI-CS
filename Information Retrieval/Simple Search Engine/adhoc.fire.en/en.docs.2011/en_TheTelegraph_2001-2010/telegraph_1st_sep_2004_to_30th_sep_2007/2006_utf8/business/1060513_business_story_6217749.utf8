 Aussie investors keen on Birla firm shares

 Melbourne, May 12 (PTI): Aditya Birla Minerals today flagged off its first initial public offering (IPO) in the overseas market generating $299 million (about Rs 1,400 crore) on the back of its two copper mines. 

 While it was only open to institutions and through specific brokers, investors poured into the new float of Aditya Birla Minerals, now ranked as Australias fourth biggest copper producer. 

 Birlas IPO generated $299 million on the back of its two copper mines?the Nifty mine in western Australia and the MT Gordon mine in Queensland.

 Shares in the offer were priced at $1.95 but opened at a much higher price of $3.66 when the company listed today. The shares closed at $3.19 and were the highest traded stock on the market with more than 55.75 million shares traded?nearly a third of its total issued capital.

 Managing director Sanjay Loyalka said the performance of the shares had been in line with his expectations given the current appetite for copper. These are exciting times, so it was very pleasing to see the result. Copper prices have been very strong in recent times ... In the last month the prices have gone up sharply, so I was expecting a premium to the offer price, said Loyalka.

 The Birlas had acquired the Nifty copper mine for $89.8 million from Straits Resources in March 2003?a time when copper price was significantly lower, the Sydney Morning Herald said in a report. 

 Loyalka said the mine was a good purchase in hindsight and would now underpin a forecast net profit of $45 million for 2006-07. 

 Copper prices have moved up and if they remain strong then the profit will accordingly change, he said. 

 Copper prices will hold at their historical highs for at least the near to medium-term, he said.

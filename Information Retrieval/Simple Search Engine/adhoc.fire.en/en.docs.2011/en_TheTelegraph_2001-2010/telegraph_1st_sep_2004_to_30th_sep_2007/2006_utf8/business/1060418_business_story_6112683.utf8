 Calcutta, April 17: India is keen to step up tea exports to Pakistan from the present 10 million kg per annum for which the domestic industry is jointly working on a number of initiatives with the Pakistan Tea Association (PTA).

 Tea Board chairman Basudeb Banerjee said there was scope for increasing exports to Pakistan, which mainly imports tea from Kenya.

 Of the 133 million kg imports by Pakistan per annum, 82 million kg were imported from Kenya alone. Indias share was 7 per cent.

 He said both PTA and the Indian Tea Association (ITA) would work with the respective governments to move towards zero duty.

 At present, Indian tea attracts a 10 per cent import duty in Pakistan. 

 Pakistan has already granted a zero-import-duty status to Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka.

 The industry would also urge the government to consider a direct rail link between Guwahati and Karachi, Aditya Khaitan, vice-chairman of ITA, said.

 Khaitan said although Pakistan mainly imported south Indian tea, the logic for a rail link from Guwahati was to facilitate supply of the Assam variety.

 He said since the Assam variety was superior in quality to the south Indian, there was scope for increasing the export of north Indian tea to Pakistan.

 Besides, the direct rail connectivity would also reduce cost of transportation.

 At a meeting of the associations held today, it was decided to jointly develop an India blend brand for marketing in Pakistan.

 Khaitan said a project report would be submitted to the Tea Board after working out the details.

 It could be launched by a select packer in Pakistan on a mutual basis with full support from the Tea Board in marketing and promotion initiatives, said Muhammad Altaf, chairman of Pakistan Tea Association.

 An Indian blend branded Nargis was prepared for the Russian market in 1996 by Warren Tea, Williamson Magor, Tata Tea, Rossell and Goodricke Group of Companies.

 The project for Pakistan would, however, entail more participation from the neighbouring country, said Gautam Bhalla, in-charge of Pakistan desk, Indian Tea Association.

 The delegation also went for a tea tasting session at J Thomas amp; Co.

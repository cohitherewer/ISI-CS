 Helping hand from China for Assam oil

 S.P.S. PANNU

 New Delhi, July 2: Chinese and Russian companies have expressed interest in revamping the infrastructure of ONGCs oilfields in Assam. Renovating the group oil gathering stations and the 20-year-old pipeline network are part of the Rs 3,300-crore plan of ONGC to double its output in the state to 3 million tonnes per year from 2009-10.

 ONGC director (onshore) A.K. Hazarika told The Telegraph that the company would float global tenders. 

 He said it was not possible to invite Indian companies to the tender as the job requires a level of technical proficiency that is absent in the country.

 Indian firms, however, would benefit from outsourcing opportunities. The Assam government will also earn more royalty from higher production.

 Hazarika brushed aside apprehensions of inadequate job opportunities for locals, generating resentment against ONGC. Even now, outputs of ONGC and OIL are below monthly targets, due to law and order problems arising out of local opposition to the PSUs. He said L amp;T was working on ONGC installations at Rudrasagar, and the locals were aware that such projects create jobs.

 The AASU leadership is pushing for the implementation of an old MoU with ONGC to absorb 250 locals on the rolls of the company. However, senior ONGC officials said the company plans to employ 1,000 to 1,200 Assamese youths to protect its installations. 

 Around 500 to 600 locals have already been recruited in Tripura on the companys security force. They will gradually replace the CISF.

 Tata has Idea selloff designs

 New Delhi April 7 (PTI): In the midst of a battle with joint venture partner AV Birla group, Tata group chairman Ratan Tata today said it would dilute stake in Idea Cellular at an appropriate time and value.

 Raising hopes of resolution of the months-long fight with the Birlas over the stakeholding in Idea, Tata told reporters, We have always indicated that we shall dilute stake in Idea at the right time and right price.

 The two partners had been at loggerheads for nearly two months, with the Birlas asking the government to direct their partner to exit from the joint venture ? a move contested by the Tatas, which in turn sent a termination notice to the Birlas and said they would instead buy them out.

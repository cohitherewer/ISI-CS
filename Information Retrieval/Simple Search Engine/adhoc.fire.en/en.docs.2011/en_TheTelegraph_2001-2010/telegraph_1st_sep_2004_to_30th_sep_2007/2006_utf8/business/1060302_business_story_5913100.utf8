 GM plan for profit run in Europe

 Geneva, March 1 (Reuters): General Motors Corp aims to stop losing money in Europe this year, snapping a string of losses since 1999, chief executive Rick Wagoner said on Wednesday.

 Our objective for 2006 in Europe is to break even or do better, he told reporters at the Geneva car show. He said this would be before restructuring charges, which he did not expect to be large.

 GM is cutting its European staff by around a fifth to address the losses. Wagoner said the restructuring program was on track but added it had to keep working on competitiveness.

 For the intermediate term, he said he wanted the worlds largest automaker to reach a 5 per cent profit margin in Europe.

 Including special items of $841 million, GM Europe lost $1.216 billion in 2005 versus a loss of $976 million in 2004, when it took $234 million in one-off charges.

 Wagoner declined to go into details on the status of negotiations to sell a stake in its GMAC financing arm, saying he did not want to speculate on the outcome of a complex deal.

 We continue to explore several options with regard to GMAC, he said, but stressed GM could easily move ahead without a quick sale. The liquidity position of the company is very strong, he said.

 GM said last October it was exploring the sale of a controlling stake in GMAC, which analysts said could fetch between $10 billion and $15 billion.

 Wagoner also said he hoped to wrap up an accord by the end of March on a negotiated settlement between GM, bankrupt Delphi Corp and Delphis unions, but he gave no further details on the talks.

 GMs largest supplier, Delphi has threatened to ask a court to void its contract with the United Auto Workers union if it cannot reach an agreement to lower labour costs.

 This could result in a strike, which could shut down plants and force GM to burn through billions of dollars, analysts say.

 Pep pill for ONGC

 New Delhi, July 17 (PTI): The government has asked Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) to drop its plans of selling petrol and diesel and focus on finding more oil and gas instead. However, the company has been permitted to complete the approved refinery projects.

 The petroleum ministry and the new management of the state-owned exploration and production giant reviewed its business initiatives, especially non-core ones, at a day-long business plan review meet in Gurgoan on Saturday.

 The message was very clear ? ONGC should not set up any more petrol pumps, a company official said.

 ONGC has one petrol pump in Mangalore and had identified 45 locations ? from Dehradun to Ahmedabad ? for retail outlets.

 ONGC and its subsidiary Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL) had plans to raise the number of outlets to 1,100 by 2008 as part of its plans to diversify into downstream and liquefied natural gas imports to become an integrated oil and gas company with a turnover of $50 billion within the next few years.

 We were told since fuel retailing is a loss-making proposition, ONGC should focus more on its core competence, the official said.

 However, the ministry, represented by secretary M.S. Srinivasan and two joint secretaries, allowed ONGC to complete the ongoing expansion of MRPL to 15 million tonnes at the meeting. The official said there was no word on the new refineries at Barmer in Rajasthan, Kakinada in Andhra Pradesh and a greenfield refinery adjacent to MRPL. 

 He said ONGC may scale down, if not fully abandon, its ambition to convert itself into an integrated player.

 Its non-core activities, including retail foray, development of special economic zones at Kakinada and Dahej and wind energy projects are likely to be put in the backburner.

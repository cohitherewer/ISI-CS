 Orissa green signal to 11 power projects

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, Sept. 20: Orissa today took a giant step to become the power hub of India. The state cleared 11 thermal power projects involving an investment of Rs 63,245 crore to produce 15,920 MW

 The high power project clearance authority of the state government, chaired by chief minister Naveen Patnaik, today cleared the proposals. Among those to get the green signal are Reliance Energy, CESC, Tata Power Company, Sterlite Energy, Essar Power, Visa Power, Jindal Photofilms and Lanco Group.

 Energy minister Suryo Patro said the MoUs will be signed at the state secretariat here on September 26. 

 Patro said the government has specified that financial closure for the projects should be reached within 18 months of signing of the MoUs.

 He said the MoUs are valid for three years and the government would not extend the agreement if the companies failed to make any substantial progress in the projects in these three years.

 Reliance Energy would set up a 4,000 MW plant at Hirma in Jharsuguda district at an investment of Rs 16,236 crore in the first phase. The MoU with Reliance Energy will have reference to the ongoing dispute between the company and the state government.

 CESC will invest Rs 4,042 crore in a 1000 MW plant at Neulapuri in Dhenkanal district.

 Tata Power will set up a Rs 4,348-crore unit of similar capacity at Naraj Marthapur in Cuttack district.

 Sterlite Energy will set up a 2,400 MW plant at Bharkhamunda in the coal-rich Jharsuguda district at an estimated cost of Rs 7,481 crore, while Bhusan Energy has proposed a 2,000 MW project in Angul district at an investment of Rs 8,483 crore. 

 The other projects cleared are Essar Power (1000 MW at an investment of Rs 4500 crore), Visa Power (1000 MW, Rs 3698 crore), Jindal Photofilms (1000 MW, Rs 4,525 crore), Lanco Group (1,320 MW, Rs 4,500 crore), KVK Nilachal Power (600 MW, Rs 2,580 crore) and Monnet Ispat amp; Energy (600 MW, Rs 2,852 crore).

 The government has specified that 25 per cent of the power be reserved for the state. A fee of 6 paise per unit will be levied on the power sent to other states. The projects will not only increase the power capacity of the state, but also generate revenue of Rs 2,400 crore. Patnaik said the projects would provide direct employment to 15,000 and indirect employment to another 30,000. 

 He said to mitigate the harmful consequences on the environment a massive green drive has been planned at the sites that involves planting new trees.

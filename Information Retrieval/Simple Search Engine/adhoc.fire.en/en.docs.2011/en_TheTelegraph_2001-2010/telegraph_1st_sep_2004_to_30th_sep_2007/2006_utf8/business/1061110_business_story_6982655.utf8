 Sebi watch on mutual trustees 

 Mumbai, Nov. 9 (PTI): To improve governance of asset management companies, market regulator Sebi is planning to debar a trustee in a mutual fund house to play the same role in another mutual fund.

 The regulator is also considering disallowing a director on the board of an asset management company from holding trusteeship in another mutual fund.

 These proposals are part of a consultation paper floated by Sebi to invite suggestions from various stakeholders.

 According to existing regulations, an independent trustee of a mutual fund is allowed to act as an independent director of other mutual funds. The regulations permit an AMC director (other than chairman) to act as a trustee of another mutual fund.

 In the consultation paper, Sebi said trustees have been made the first line regulators of mutual funds. Due diligence is the primary responsibility of trustees since they act as supervisors of mutual funds.

 AMCs are required to send periodical compliance reports to trustees, who in turn send them to Sebi.

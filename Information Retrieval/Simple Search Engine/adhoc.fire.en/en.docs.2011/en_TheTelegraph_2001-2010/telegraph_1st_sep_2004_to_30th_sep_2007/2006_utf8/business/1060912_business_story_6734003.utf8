 ING Vysya exits Bharat Overseas

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Sept. 11: ING Vysya Bank has sold its 14.66 per cent stake in Bharat Overseas Bank (BhoB) to Indian Overseas Bank (IOB) for Rs 35.80 crore.

 The Bangalore-based bank today informed the stock exchanges that it had sold 23,09,999 shares held by it in BhoB, being one share less than its holding of 23.10 lakh shares, at the rate of Rs 155 per share.

 IOB is now the main shareholder of the Chennai-based bank with a 44.66 per cent stake. IOB had picked up 30 per cent in the Chennai-based old private sector bank earlier this year. Its board in February had approved a takeover of BhoB and had pegged the cost of acquisition at Rs 170 crore.

 In addition to IOB, there are six banks with a shareholding in BhoB Bank of Rajasthan with 16 per cent stake, ING Vysya Bank (14.66 per cent), Federal Bank (10.67 per cent), Karur Vysya Bank (10 per cent), South Indian Bank (10 per cent) and Karnataka Bank at 8.67 per cent. The acquisition takes the number of IOB branches in the country to 1,600. 

 The RBI had recently slapped a penalty of Rs 20 lakh on the BhoB for alleged irregularities in the demat scam.

 BhoB was charged with giving loans to fictitious/benami individuals, funding intra-day margin money requirements of brokers and extending huge amounts to a group of accounts through fictitious/benami individuals that violated RBI norms on funding IPOs. RBI had inter-alia fixed a limit of Rs 10 lakh per individual.

 The banks internal control system not only failed to arrest these irregularities but also did not heed the warnings of its internal auditors. 

 BhoB also collected a/c payee cheques of individuals, who are not the customers of the bank, besides crediting the proceeds of the refund orders to accounts other than the accounts of the payees.

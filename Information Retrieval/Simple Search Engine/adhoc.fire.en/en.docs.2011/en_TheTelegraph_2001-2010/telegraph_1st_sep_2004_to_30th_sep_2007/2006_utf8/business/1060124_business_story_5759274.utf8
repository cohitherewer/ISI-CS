 Wider IPO probe ambit

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Jan. 23: Sebi chairman M. Damodaran today indicated that the market regulator is investigating all public issues since June 2005 to gauge the ramifications of the share allotment scam in initial public offerings (IPOs).

 We are looking into all the issues and our investigations are still on. We have not closed shop as yet, Damodaran told reporters on the sidelines of a seminar organised by the Bombay Management Association.

 A few investors in Ahmedabad have been charged with opening hundreds of fictitious demat accounts and cornering the shares in the Yes Bank issue. It is now believed that the manipulation may have extended to other issues as well.

 Damodaran, however, insisted that retail investors need not worry about the ongoing investigations as there are quite a few good IPOs still in the market. There are some good issues in the market right now that retail investors can take advantage of.

 The detection of multiple fictitious demat accounts has raised serious questions about the probity of share allotment procedures and the plight of genuine investors.

 The Securities and Exchange Board of India recently issued directions to market intermediaries to obtain sufficient information to identify persons who beneficially own or control demat accounts.

 The market regulator has directed the intermediaries to verify their customers identities using reliable, independent source documents, data or information. It also directed them to identify the beneficial ownership and control of securities.

 More than 50,000 multiple demat accounts were closed down recently after the regulator detected another allotment scam in the IDFC maiden offering.

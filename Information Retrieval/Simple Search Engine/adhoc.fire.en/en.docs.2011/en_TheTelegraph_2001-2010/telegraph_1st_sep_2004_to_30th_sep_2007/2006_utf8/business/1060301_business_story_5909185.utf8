 Duty cut to keep WTO pledge

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Feb. 28: Finance minister P. Chidambaram today reduced the peak rate of customs duties on non-agricultural products from 15 per cent to 12.5 per cent to bring them closer to the levels prevailing in southeast Asian countries as part of the countrys WTO commitments.

 However, a countervailing duty of 4 per cent has been imposed on most imports to provide a level playing field to Indian companies which have to pay local excise and sales tax.

 The only hike in customs duty has been in the case of vanaspati where an 80 per cent tariff has been introduced to protect domestic industry which is reeling under cheap imports. 

 With the reduction in the peak rate of customs duties, Chidambaram has scaled down customs duties on raw materials and intermediates in order to avoid an inverted duty structure.

 The duty on alloy steel and primary and secondary non-ferrous metals has been cut from 10 per cent to 7.5 per cent. Ferro alloys will also attract a duty of 7.5 per cent. 

 The finance minister has restored the 5 per cent duty on steel melting scrap that had been reduced to zero in the last budget as steel prices had shot up. 

 Now with prices of steel coming down, the government feels that the duty waiver is no longer required.

 The duty on mineral products, apart from a few exceptions, has been slashed from 15 per cent to 5 per cent while that on ores and concentrates has been lowered from 5 per cent to 2 per cent. 

 The customs tariff on all inputs required for manufacturing refractories has been reduced from 10 per cent to 7.5 per cent so that they are lower than the customs duty on refractories which is currently at 10 per cent.

 Since plastics are important raw materials, the duty on major bulk plastics such as PVC and LDPE has been slashed by half from 10 per cent to 5 per cent. The duties on styrene, EDC and VCM which are raw materials for plastics has been reduced to 2 per cent.

 The finance minister said the reduction in these duties would encourage more investment in the plastic-based industry which in turn would lead to the generation of more jobs.

 Similarly, the duty on packaging machines which serve a wide variety of industries, including food processing, has been cut from 15 per cent to 5 per cent.

 The duties on basic inorganic chemicals which serve as crucial raw materials has also been reduced from 15 per cent to 10 per cent.

 As part of a humanitarian gesture, the budget has reduced the customs duty on 10 anti-AIDS and 14 anti-cancer drugs to 5 per cent and slashed the customs tariff on certain life-saving drugs, kits and equipment from 15 per cent to 5 per cent. 

 The finance minister has identified the textiles industry for duty incentives as it is a growth-and-employment driver. The excise duty on all man-made fibre yarn and filament yarns has been reduced from 16 per cent to 8 per cent while the customs duty has been scaled down 15 per cent 10 per cent. 

 As a result the import duty on raw materials such as DMT, PTA and MEG has also been reduced from 15 per cent to 10 per cent.

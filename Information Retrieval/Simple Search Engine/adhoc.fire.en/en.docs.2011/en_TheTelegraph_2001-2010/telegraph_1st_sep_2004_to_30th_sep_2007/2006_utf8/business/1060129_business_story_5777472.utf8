 Stay cool note from Arcelor chief 

 Dolle: Unfazed by Mittal bid

 Paris, Jan. 28 (AFP): Arcelor chief executive Guy Dolle today called on employees of the European Steel Group to stay cool following a hostile takeover bid from the worlds biggest producer, Mittal Steel.

 Over the next few months, we must stay cool while remaining determined, said Dolle in a message to Arcelor associates that was received by AFP today. This is a hostile offer, made without any preliminary discussions with the management of Arcelor, he added. 

 Mittal Steel announced yesterday its $22.7-billion takeover bid for Arcelor, the second global steel producer. 

 The surprise bid touched off an anxious response from unions at Arcelor. The CFDT union declared it is not good news for employees of the group; it is not good news for jobs.

 The union said in a statement that back in 2000, the steel giant headed by Lakshmi Mittal, described as the sole leader of his empire, decided one day to close the company Ispat Ireland because its results did not meet the expectations of the Mittal group.

 In contrast CFDT said the corporate culture at Arcelor is one of dialogue and should be defended, adding that its analysis was largely shared by other European unions at arcelor.

 Mittal Steel said there was a billion euros of synergy (with Arcelor), which for us means closing installations and eliminating jobs, said a representative of the CGT union at Arcelor

 Belgian stand 

 Belgiums Walloon government called on Mittal Steel and Arcelor today to respect existing agreements with Belgian steel unions after the worlds no. 1 steel company launched a takeover bid for its closest rival.

 The regional government in southern Belgium said it would seek more commitments before it agreed to sell its 2.4 per cent stake in Arcelor. The company employs 15,000 people in the French-speaking region of Wallonia, which has been hard hit by steel job losses in recent years.

 The workers are worried, with good cause, said Elio di Rupo, the head of the Wallonia government. Their legitimate questions have to be answered.

 He said the government had contacted Mittal, Arcelor and trade unions to assess what a takeover would mean for the region.

 Once an industrial powerhouse, the city of Liege has seen employment in its steel mills fall from 40,000 to 5,000.

 Luxembourg-based Arce-lor said yesterday that Mittals takeover bid was hostile. Its directors will meet tomorrow to discuss the offer and are scheduled to make a public statement on Monday.

 Mittal had said the deal would create the worlds first 100-million tonne-plus steel producer, with a market capitalisation of $40 billion. It anticipated annual synergies of $1 billion.

 Slew of bids for CBM hunt

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, June 30: The government has received 54 bids for the 10 blocks it offered for exploration and production of coal bed methane (CBM). 

 ONGC, Reliance Industries, Reliance Energy, Essar Oil, OIL, GAIL, Jindal Steel, IOC and Coal India are among the Indian firms that participated in the bidding while Arrow Energy of Australia, CDX Gas and Coal Gas of the US, BP and GeoPetrol of France were among the foreign companies, which joined the bid.

 The estimated CBM resource worth in these 10 blocks is about 635 billion cubic metre.

 Director-general of hydrocarbons V.K. Sibal said, The fact that 54 bids have been submitted reflects the change in the perception of foreign companies about the presence of huge CBM resources here.

 While the first round of CBM hunt fetched 16 bids, in the second round, which offered eight blocks, just 14 bids were received.

 Calcutta, Aug. 18: A US trade mission, comprising 25 representatives from scrap-related industries, will visit Bengal in January. Meanwhile, a bigger business delegation of around 200 industrialists from the US will come to Mumbai in November and some of them will also visit Calcutta and Delhi.

 This was revealed by the newly-appointed principal commercial officer at the US consulate-general in Calcutta, Aileen Crowe Nandi, at an interactive session organised by the eastern regional council of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) here today.

 Nandi wished to promote US small and medium enterprises to increase exports to India and help narrow the widening trade deficit between the two countries.

 However, I have to be very careful when a company proposes to invest in India as there is a growing concern that the shift in investment to India and other countries is creating job losses in the US, Nandi said. 

 According to her, US companies want to explore opportunities in education, mining equipment, power and food processing in eastern India.

 Nandi said the US government was a little apprehensive about the recent development involving US soft drink giants Coca-Cola and Pepsi. Last week, the government (US) warned US investors that their investment in India may not be fully secured, she said. 

 The bilateral trade volume between India and US is $20 billion. Both the governments want the amount to double in the next three years.

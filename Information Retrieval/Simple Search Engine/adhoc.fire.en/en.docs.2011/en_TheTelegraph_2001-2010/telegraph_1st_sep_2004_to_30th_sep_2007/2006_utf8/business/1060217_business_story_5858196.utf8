The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 NIIT to hire more in Calcutta

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Feb. 16: NIIT Technologies is planning to raise its headcount in Calcutta.

 We will be recruiting about 100 more people in Calcutta, said Arvind Thakur, CEO of NIIT. We are also looking at the possibility of establishing a large campus in and around Delhi.

 NIIT today launched its services business to address the remote infrastructure management opportunity. 

 It is estimated that less than 5 per cent of the addressable management services market has been tapped till date, indicating a significant head room for growth, he said.

 NIIT will invest about $2 million in this business, as it perceives a significant growth opportunity here.

 It has a data centre in Thailand and is planning to set up more centres globally.

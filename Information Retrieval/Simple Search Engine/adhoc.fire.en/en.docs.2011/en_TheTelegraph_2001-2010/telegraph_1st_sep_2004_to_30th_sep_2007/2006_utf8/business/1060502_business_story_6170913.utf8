 NTPC lobbies for natural gas linkage

 S.P.S. PANNU

 New Delhi, May 1: The National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) has asked Delhi chief minister Shiela Dixit to discuss the availability of natural gas for its new power plant with petroleum minister Murli Deora. The plant is being set up to meet the increased demand for electricity required for projects linked with the 2010 Commonwealth games.

 Sources said NTPC is seeking 1.7 million standard cubic metres per day (MMSCMD) of natural gas for the 350-mw Pragati Power project, which is expected to go on stream from 2007-08.

 Natural gas is considered to be the ideal fuel for the power plant, which is being set up in the capital and has to be environment friendly.

 However, natural gas supply is falling short of even the allocations already made by the government.

 NTPC is banking on the fact that since the project is linked to the Commonwealth games, national prestige is involved and the government will be able to find a way out for making the gas available.

 The output of natural gas has been stepped up from the Panna-Mukta and Tapti fields and the gas required could come from here. At present, these two fields jointly produce about 10 MMSCMD of gas.

 However, these ONGC-discovered fields have been privatised and Reliance Industries and British Gas (BG) have a 30 per cent share each. ONGC holds a 40 per cent stake.

 Therefore, it is not easy for the government to ask them to come around as these companies are looking for the best price in the market.

 The ministry had to intervene and ask the joint venture to continue supplying 5 MMSCMD of gas to GAIL for another two years. The price of the gas was settled at $4.75 per million Btu for two years, which was higher than the $3.86 per million Btu that was paid last year.

 The new price, however, is inclusive of the royalty that is payable by the JV to the government.

 According to senior officials, in view of the national importance of the Commonwealth games the gas for the project could be diverted from ONGC fields as well.

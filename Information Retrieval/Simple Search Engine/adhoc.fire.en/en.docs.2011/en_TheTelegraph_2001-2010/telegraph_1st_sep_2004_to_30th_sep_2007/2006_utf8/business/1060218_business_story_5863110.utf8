 Fresh blow to Anil

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Feb. 17: Anil Ambani today suffered a second jolt in recent weeks when group company Reliance Energy was not among those short-listed for the Mumbai Trans-harbour Link project. Anil had earlier lost out in the race to bag contracts for privatisation of Delhi and Mumbai airports.

 Under the trans-harbour link project, a bridge connecting Sewri in south Mumbai and Nhava Sheva in Navi Mumbai will be built, which will reduce travel time for commuters drastically. 

 The Gammon India-L amp;T combine, SKIL Infrastructure-IL amp;FS and Iffco have been shortlisted for the project, which will be developed on a build-operate-transfer basis. Those dropped in the pre-qualification round included Reliance Energy and China Harbour. The pre-qualified bidders now need to submit their tenders in the next five months.

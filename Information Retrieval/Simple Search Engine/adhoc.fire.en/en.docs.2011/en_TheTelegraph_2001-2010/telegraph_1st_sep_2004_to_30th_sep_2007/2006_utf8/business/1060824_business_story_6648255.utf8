 Global funds for Essars ship buy plans

 Mumbai, Aug. 23: Essar Shipping and Logistics, the holding company formed by the Ruias, has raised $200 million from a few global banks for its ship acquisition plans. The proceeds will part-finance its $300-million ship acquisition programme.

 Essar Shipping and Logistics will hold stakes in Essar Shipping Ltd, Essar Logistics Ltd and Vadinar Oil Terminal Ltd. It will be a fully-owned subsidiary of Essar Global Ltd (EGL), which is the prime investment arm of the Ruias with interests in infrastructure, telecommunications and industrial construction.

 The funds come at a time when the shipping industry is in a bullish phase with freight rates rising. While many domestic companies have already announced plans to acquire ships, most of the shipyards are running to full capacity.

 The 10-year loan was fully underwritten by De Nationale Investeringsbank N.V. Inc at an interest rate of Libor plus 120 basis points. The debt was raised from a consortium of international banks, including Den Norske Bank, Norway; Nordea Bank; Deutsche Verkehrs Bank AG and Bank of Scotland.

 Essar Global had earlier announced the reorganisation of its businesses in shipping, terminals and logistics. The company formed Essar Shipping and Logistics, registered in Cyprus, to provide a sharper business focus and increase shareholder value.

 According to the re-organisation plan of the shipping business, the company will have three operating firms under its umbrella. These include Essar Shipping, in which the new company will have a 77 per cent stake, and two fully owned subsidiaries - Essar Logistics and Vadinar Oil. 

 Essar Logistics will carry out logistics management, trans-shipment and port services. Vadinar Oil will focus on ports and terminals. Vadinar Oil has set up a 32-million-tonne terminal facility at Vadinar in Gujarat, which will be operational by September-end.

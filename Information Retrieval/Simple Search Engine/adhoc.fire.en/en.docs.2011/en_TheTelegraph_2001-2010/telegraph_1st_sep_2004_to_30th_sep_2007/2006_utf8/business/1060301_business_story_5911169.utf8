The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 SECTOR SNAPSHOT 

 New Delhi: The government is planning 

 to open 15 new tourist destinations and circuits. The new 

 destinations and circuits include Agra-Mathura, Varanasi-Sarnath, 

 Hampi, Badami-Aihole-Patadakal, Hyderabad, Bodh Gaya-Rajgir- 

 Nalanda, Bhubaneswar-Puri-Konark, and Elephanta Caves.

 While that is good news for inbound tourists, those looking 

 to holiday abroad have reason to feel a little miffed.

 The finance minister has brought international air travel 

 (excluding economy class) and travel on cruise ships under 

 the service tax net. But the hoteliering business is happy 

 that the valuation for the calculation of the fringe benefit 

 tax on tours and travel has been scaled back to 5 per cent 

 from 20 per cent earlier. Chidambaram increased the budget 

 for tourism from Rs 786 crore to Rs 830 crore, giving priority 

 to development of tourist infrastructure.

 Calcutta: The jute sector is looking 

 forward to golden days following the finance minister's 

 commitment to set up the National Jute Board and create 

 a jute technology mission fund from 2006-07.

 Industry leaders expressed a sense of relief for continuance 

 of the excise duty exemption on jute mill machinery and 

 jute products. They are also hopeful of receiving a fresh 

 administrative impetus once the jute board is formed.

 New Delhi: The computer manufacturing 

 industry has received a shot in the arm with the finance 

 minister announcing greater access to funds under the viability 

 gap funding and other instruments of infrastructure financing.

 I propose to use the existing vehicles of viability 

 gap funding and the Indian Infrastructure Finance Company 

 Limited to create a window to provide equity participation 

 and/or viability gap funding to the new ventures, 

 said the finance minister.

 New Delhi: ONGC will take a hit of Rs 

 1,890 crore on the 27 million tonnes of crude that it produces, 

 while OIL will have to cough up an extra Rs 245 crore due 

 to the Rs 700 per tonne increase in cess on crude oil introduced 

 in today's budget. IOC, BPCL and HPCL will get some respite 

 as Chidambaram has extended the declared goods 

 status for LPG supplied for domestic use. Cooking gas will 

 now attract a uniform central sales tax of 4 per cent. 

 New Delhi: The government today decided 

 to constitute an expert body to study the potential of the 

 gems and jewellery industry. The body will study the prevalent 

 taxation practices in India and abroad and make its recommendations, 

 Chidambaram said today. This announcement will be welcomed 

 by non-resident Indians who are looking to India as a place 

 for future expansion and growth, an official said. 

 Calcutta: The government raised the customs 

 duty on vanaspati to 80 per cent from 30 per cent. The increased 

 rate is also applicable to crude palm oil. But the industry, 

 which operates at just about 20-25 per cent capacity, does 

 not expect its fortunes to change as import of vanaspati 

 from Nepal and Sri Lanka at zero duty has captured about 

 35 per cent of the market. Import from other countries, 

 where the customs duty is applicable, is insignificant

 New Delhi: Indias dream of manufacturing 

 semi-conductors and other high-tech IT products could well 

 become a reality, with the IT ministry set to announce a 

 policy shortly. 

 Condensed milk, ice cream, pasta and yeast exempted; duty 

 on ready-to-eat packaged foods and instant food mixes, like 

 dosa and idli mixes, cut to 8%

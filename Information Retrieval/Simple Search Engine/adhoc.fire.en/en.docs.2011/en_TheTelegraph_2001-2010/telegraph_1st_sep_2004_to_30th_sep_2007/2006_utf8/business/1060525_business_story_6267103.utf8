 New Nokia boss wants to reach brand summit 

 Olli-Pekka: Ambitious

 Helsinki, May 24 (Reuters): The incoming chief executive of the worlds top mobile phone maker has a clear target ? to make Finlands Nokia the worlds top brand ? and that doesnt mean just in mobile phones.

 The right ambition ... is to make Nokia the most loved and admired brand in the world, all industries included, Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo said at an investor meeting in the United States earlier this week. That is very much what I am pushing for, he added.

 The task is different from that of predecessor Jorma Ollila, who took the post in 1992 and had to turn a troubled, sprawling conglomerate to profitability. Nokias sales have since grown 11 times, and its shares have risen by 140 times.

 Kallasvuo has a good starting point. Nokia was already the highest-valued European brand last year, according to consultancy Interbrand. But it ranked sixth in the world behind US giants Coca-Cola, Microsoft, IBM, GE and Intel.

 Nokias direct handset rivals are valued lower, with Koreas Samsung on spot 20 and Motorola at 73rd.

 Nokia built its brand in the 1990s on easy-to-use, small phones with a long battery life.

 In recent years its competitors have improved their designs. With the slim RAZR, Motorola recovered the leading edge it used to have with its small Startec phones. With Walkman phones, Sony Ericsson has abandoned an image that the Swedish company itself described as boring Ericsson, while Samsung has grabbed consumer interest with its advanced flip phones and slim sliders.

 Nokia as a whole needs to become much more focused on marketing, in addition to products and technologies. By marketing I basically mean brand, design, marketing, said Kallasvuo.

 Kallasvuos own phone represents the change. He carries a black version of Nokias top model, the 8800, which is made for consumers willing to pay 1,000 euros just for design. By contrast, Ollila has usually been seen with a functional smartphone. 

 Kallasvuo has worked for years as the right-hand of Ollila, who is seen as a corporate hero in its homeland. Market followers expect little change in the companys overall direction when Kallasvuo takes the lead on June 1.

 He (Kallasvuo) will be the man to lead the revival of the Nokia brand, said Ben Wood, a director at Collins Consulting said, adding he expected the change to take 12 to 18 months.

 Kallasvuo stressed that closer focus on brand and marketing does not necessarily mean higher marketing costs and that the company was keeping a close eye on marketing spending.

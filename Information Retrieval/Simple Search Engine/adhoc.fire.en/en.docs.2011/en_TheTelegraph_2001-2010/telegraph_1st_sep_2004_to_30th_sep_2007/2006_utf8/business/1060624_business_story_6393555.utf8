 Calcutta, June 23: The government is considering an amendment to the Indian Telegraph Act to include mobile services in rural areas under basic telephony, according to Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) chairman Nripendra Misra.

 The matter is pending before a parliamentary committee for its approval, Misra said at a seminar organised by the Bengal National Chamber of Commerce here today. 

 This measure is being considered to increase rural teledensity, which is only 4 per cent compared with 37 per cent in urban areas and a national average of 14 per cent, he said.

 After mobile services are brought under basic telephony, cellular operators will be able to access the USO (universal service obligation) fund set up to finance telecom projects in rural areas. Besides, they will also get the government subsidy enjoyed by the basic telecom service providers in rural areas.

 The department of telecommunications is considering simplifying the Sacfa (Standing Committee for Frequency Allocation) clause for cellular operators for obtaining the transmission licence, Misra said.

 It usually takes six to eight months to get the Sacfa clearance, said a mobile service provider. 

 Misra also advised mobile service providers on ways to reduce network congestion and interconnectivity. 

 Service providers can identify at least one interconnect exchange in each state capital as a national interconnect exchange where anyone can plug in and connect like a pay-and-use dispenser. Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited with the largest footprint and interconnect exchanges all over the country can play a vital role in this, he said.

 Airport update in limbo

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 12: A meeting of the group of ministers on airport which was slated to take a final view on how to go about privatising Delhi and Mumbai airports ended in stalemate. 

 The group sought a host of clarifications from the Sreedharan panel, which suggested scrapping an earlier round of controversial bidding and reduced the marks given to the Reliance-Mexico Airports consortia in the bidding process relegating it to the losers list.

 Civil aviation minister Praful Patel said, We have asked for more clarifications from the committee. He, however, maintained that the January 31 deadline for clearing the project would be met, though he did not specify the time-limit given to the Sreedharan committee. 

 Sources said the two-hour meeting was not exactly smooth. They indicated that Patel had objected to Sreedharan reports plan that the two gateway airports be developed by state-run Airports Authority of India through a special purpose vehicle in which foreign airport developers too could participate. 

 It was suggested that scrapping the bidding would mean starting afresh, which would mean wastage of time. The alternative of re-bidding among unsuccessful bidders was also considered. 

 Ultimately it was decided to seek clarifications on a number of parameters and on its proposals from the expert panel. 

 The UPA government is keen to find a way out of the imbroglio as it needs to modernise the two airports ahead of the 2010 Commonwealth Games. But the Sreedharan committee was set up because serious objections to the bidding process were raised.

 Several key members of a governmental review panel as well as the Left parties raised objections to the way the bidding process had been conducted.

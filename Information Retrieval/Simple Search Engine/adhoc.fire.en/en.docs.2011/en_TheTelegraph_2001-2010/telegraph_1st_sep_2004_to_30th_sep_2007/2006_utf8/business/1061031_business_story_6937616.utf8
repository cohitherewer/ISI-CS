 Deora seeks Russian ties

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Deora: Upbeat

 New Delhi, Oct. 30: Petroleum minister Murli Deora today informed his Russian counterpart Victor Khristenko of ONGC-Videshs willingness to invest in future upstream projects in Sakhalin.

 A petroleum ministry statement said that the Russian energy minister assured Deora in Moscow today of OVL getting a favourable consideration in new projects.

 Deora also sounded out Khristenko on Indian Oil Corporations interest to join hands with Russian companies for downstream projects in both the countries. 

 The meeting is important, with Russia bringing its oil and gas assets under state control following the failure of the privatisation exercise in the early nineties.

 Deora also invited Khristenko to the function to be held in the first week of December at Mangalore to receive the first tanker of OVLs crude from Sakhalin. Khristenko has indicated his willingness to attend the event.

 Deora will address a global gathering of oil industry representatives at the Moscow Energy Week tomorrow.

 However, uppermost on his agenda, is promoting cooperation between Indian and Russian oil companies. 

 He is accompanied by Kanwal Sibal, Indian ambassador to Russia, Sarthak Behuria, chairman, Indian Oil Corporation and R.S. Butola, managing director, ONGC Videsh. 

 The visit precedes the arrival of Russian president Vladimir Putin for next years Republic Day celebrations where he will be the chief guest.

 After Sakhalin I, OVL is keen to participate in the exploration of Sakhalin 3, Severnaya Neft, Vankor and Pirazlomnoye oilfields. These are huge fields in the initial stages of development.

 However a stake in any if these oil fields will not come cheap, as happened in Sakhalin I when a cash-strapped Russia had to borrow from ONGC Videsh.

 Stake sale on BSE agenda

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Patel: Strategic point

 Mumbai, July 7: The Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) is planning a strategic sale of 26 per cent and has appointed Kotak Mahindra Capital Company as its financial adviser for the selloff.

 ?We are awaiting the final guidelines from Sebi on the demutualisation and corporatisation process. However, we have appointed Kotak to initiate the process,? said Rajnikant Patel, managing director and chief executive officer of BSE. 

 ?Kotak will guide us through the entire process, including the valuation exercise of the exchange based on the awaited Sebi guidelines,? said Patel. 

 ?The remaining 25 per cent will be offered through an initial public offering or an offer for sale,? said Patel.

 Patel announced this on the 132nd foundation day of the stock exchange. 

 Bourse authorities aren?t ruling out stake sale to a foreign bourse. ?We have been receiving queries from both foreign and domestic investors,? added Patel. 

 ?While the deadline for corporatisation has been extended till May 2007, we hope that the strategic sale will take place by December,? he said. 

 Worldwide, bourses have been looking at mergers and acquisitions. 

 ?All over the world, it is the emerging trend for the stock exchanges to get listed on the bourses and India cannot remain isolated from the phenomenon,? he explained. 

 The market regulator had formed a committee to study the issues involved in the divestment of shareholding on the exchanges and has sought public comments on the report submitted by the committee. 

 The report mentioned that though in order to increase the public shareholding, as required by the demutualisation scheme, stock exchanges might opt for the initial public offers route, all the exchanges might not wish to adopt the IPO route. Thus, it is necessary to allow the exchanges to induct strategic partners to aid development. 

 The committee has, however, put some restrictions on the shareholding pattern based on the investor. 

 In case a strategic partner is an exchange, multilateral agency, insurance company, bank, depository or clearing corporation, it would be allowed to hold up to a maximum of 26 per cent of the share capital and voting rights of the stock exchange either singly or collectively along with persons acting in concert. Any other entity, including foreign investors, will be permitted to hold less than 15 per cent.

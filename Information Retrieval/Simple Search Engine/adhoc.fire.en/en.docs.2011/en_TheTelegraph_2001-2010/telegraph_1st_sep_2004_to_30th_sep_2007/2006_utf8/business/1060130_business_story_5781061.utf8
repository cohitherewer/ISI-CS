 States levy high food tax

 Costly proposition

 New Delhi, Jan. 29: Several states are still levying a 12.5 per cent value-added tax on processed foods hampering the growth of a single common market in the country, said a survey done by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci).

 The empowered committee on value-added tax had recommended a 4 per cent VAT for the food processing industry as a whole. But some states such as Kerala, Himachal Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Sikkim, Nagaland, and Tripura have not yet brought processed fruits and vegetables under the new tax regime. As a result, processed food items continue to get taxed at 12.5 per cent in these states. 

 The survey also pointed out that even among those states which have classified processed vegetables under the 4 per cent category, Jammu amp; Kashmir and Mizoram have created separate entries in the 12.5 per cent residual category for certain ready-to-serve food like pickles, sauces, jams, savouries and chips.

 The study said a similar distorted taxation was also being levied on ghee. While some states such as Chhattishgarh, Assam, Orissa and Maharashtra have included ghee in the category of edible oil products liable to a 4 per cent VAT, others have been levying a 12.5 per cent tax on pure ghee.

 Ghee is edible oil and internationally known as butter oil. The VAT rate should be the same as edible oil and it should not be included in another category. There should be a uniformity in taxation to avoid unwarranted litigation and have an international practice in place, the study suggested.

 The lack of uniformity in the definition of the food processing industry in different states has led to this distorted taxation structure of processed food items, hampering the growth of a single common market, it added.

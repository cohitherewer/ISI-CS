 Oil firms to float open tenders for ethanol

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Deora: Firm stand

 New Delhi, Aug. 30: Petroleum minister Murli Deora has asked public sector oil companies to float open tenders for the purchase of ethanol from sugar mills instead of going through the negotiated price route.

 Sugar mills, which produce ethanol as a by-product and were paid Rs 18.75 a litre last year on a negotiated basis, were seeking Rs 27 per litre this year. However, since the move smacked of cartelisation, public sector oil companies did not agree to the sharp increase in price and instead insisted on a rate based on the calorific value of ethanol.

 A major supplier recently made a unilateral offer to supply 10 crore litres of ethanol at Rs 21.50 per litre for five years. While the oil companies were keen on the direct offer, the agriculture ministry also advocated direct negotiations with suppliers.

 Deora, however, rejected the suggestions of the agriculture ministry and has asked the oil companies to go in for the open bidding process in which all suppliers can participate so that the price can be arrived at in an open and fair manner, an official said.

 Oil firms need 58 crore litres of ethanol annually to sell 5 per cent ethanol-blended petrol in the nine sugarcane producing states. 

 The official said the Rs 21 per litre price for ethanol was about 35 per cent more than the price for equivalent calorific value fuel.

 Ethanol gives 44 per cent lower energy than petrol and according to international practices, like the one followed in the worlds largest ethanol-petrol blender country Brazil, it should have been priced at roughly 60 per cent of the manufacturing cost.

 The energy equivalent price of ethanol works out to Rs 15.60 a litre taking one-year peak petrol cost of Rs 26 per litre, but the Indian Sugar Manufacturers Association wanted ethanol price to be linked to international oil prices.

 The industry wants the present system of voluntary ethanol blending to continue till adequate ethanol availability on long-term basis is assured. The NDA government had introduced compulsory blending of ethanol but the scheme had to be scrapped in 2004, following lower availability due to drought.

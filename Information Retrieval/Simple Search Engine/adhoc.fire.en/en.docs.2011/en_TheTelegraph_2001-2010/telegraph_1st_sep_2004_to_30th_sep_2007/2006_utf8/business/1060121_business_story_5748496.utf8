The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 ITC profit at Rs 537 cr

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 20: Buoyed by cigarette sales and improved performance of the hotels and paper business, ITC Ltd has clocked a post-tax profit of Rs 536.83 crore and net sales of Rs 2556.04 crore for the three months ended December 31, 2005, its best-ever in any quarter.

 During the period, net sales and net profit grew 37.5 per cent and 15.02 per cent, respectively. However, viewed in the context of base effect (tax refund of Rs 33 crore in the same quarter last year), the growth in net profit is 24.8 per cent. 

 Gross turnover rose 28.5 per cent to Rs 4,190 crore, while profit before exceptional items stood at Rs 582.27 crore.

 Non-cigarette sales accounted for 49 per cent of the topline, a jump of 57 per cent over the same period last year. Cigarettes contributed Rs 692.87 crore.

 FMCG 

 During the quarter, branded packaged foods, lifestyle, retailing, greetings cards, stationery, agarbattis and safety matches continued to bleed. However, branded packaged food sales grew 85 per cent. The apparel business also had an impressive performance. 

 Hotels

 Segment revenue from the hotels business grew 31.4 per cent to Rs 219 crore. ITC Grand Central, ITCs second hotel in Mumbai, posted a profit at the pre-tax level in its first nine months of operations. 

 ITC Sonar Bangla consolidated its position as the market leader both in terms of Revpar (revenue per available room) and room revenues in Calcutta. 

 In keeping with the companys strategy to maximise its presence in key business locations, pre-project work in respect of the second property at Bangalore is under way. 

 Meanwhile, in the matches segment, the acquisition of WIMCO by the companys wholly owned subsidiary Russell Credit has begun to yield synergy advantages. After cigarettes, the paper, paperboard and packaging business were the star performer for the company.

 Bid to resolve Chiria dispute

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Ranchi, Aug. 7: The Centre has directed the Jharkhand government and the Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL) to amicably settle the dispute over the iron ore-rich Chiria mines and avoid long-drawn court battles.

 The direction came at a tripartite meeting of the mandarins from the Prime Ministers office, state government and SAIL in New Delhi today. 

 Jharkhand chief secretary M.K. Mandal and mines secretary S.K. Satpathy represented the state. Chairman S.K. Rungta led the team from SAIL.

 The PMO wants the warring parties to go in for an out-of-court settlement as resolving the issue through litigation would take a long time. It would not be in the interest of either party. The better option is to sit across the table and work out a solution, a source said.

 Chiria is home to one of the biggest mines in Asia with quality ore reserves. This mine, which was with Indian Iron and Steel Company (IISCO), is now with SAIL after IISCO was merged with it. 

 The Jharkhand government wants to give fresh lease to some private companies with which it has signed MoUs for steel plants. Steel baron L.N. Mittal is interested in the Chiria mines for his proposed 12-million-tonne plant in Jharkhand.

 A year ago, the Jharkhand government had cancelled the lease of three mining blocks of Chiria, alleging that IISCO had not only failed to apply for lease on time, but had also done nothing to undertake mining there. In protest, the company went to the central mines tribunal which directed the government to renew the lease. 

 The Jharkhand government has challenged the tribunals order at the high court in Ranchi. The matter is yet to be taken up for hearing.

 The government did not have any ulterior motive in cancelling the lease. It needs iron ore as investors with whom the state has signed MoUs require the raw material for their steel plants, the state team said at the meeting.

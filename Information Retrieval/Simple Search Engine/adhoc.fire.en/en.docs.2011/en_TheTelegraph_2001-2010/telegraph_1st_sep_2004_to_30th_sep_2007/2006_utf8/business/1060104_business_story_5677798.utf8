 UTI fund bets big on top firms

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Jan. 3: UTI Mutual Fund, with a portfolio of 55 domestic funds, today expanded its product profile by introducing a new equity-oriented scheme, UTI Leadership Equity Fund. It will invest in the leading stocks of various industries. 

 The fund will invest both in the existing leaders and in potential leaders of the economy, said U.K Sinha, CEO and managing director of UTI AMC.

 The new scheme will be open between January 9 and 30 and reopen for continuous purchase and redemption from February 28.

 It will invest in equity and equity-related instruments of leaders to the extent of 65-100 per cent and potential leaders to the extent of 0-35 per cent. It may also invest in debt and money market instruments to the extent of 0-10 per cent. Sinha said the mutual fund plans to add several new schemes to its product basket during this calendar year to satisfy the varied investment needs of investors. 

 We take our leadership role very seriously. We do not want to be a leader of a stagnant industry, he said. However, he also raised concerns about the low penetration of mutual funds in the country.

 A.K. Sridhar, chief investment officer of UTI AMC said leaders include companies with high market shares, strong brand equity, better operating efficiencies, better access to capital and significant competitive advantages.

 While it has been found that they do well in a rising market and protect the gains in a falling market, investments of the UTI Leadership Equity Fund will be restricted to the top five companies of an industry or a sector in terms of sales turnover or market share. 

 He said an industry or a sector that outperforms others will be selected by the fund manager and then the leading companies in that category will be chosen for investment. The fund will focus on 25-30 stocks.

 Overseas investors

 UTI Mutual Fund said investors from West Asia are eager to invest in the company and enter into partnership in areas like research, front and back-end office operations, adds PTI.

 Investors from West Asia want to enter into partnership with us in areas like research, back-end and front-office operations. However, it is too early to talk about the amount of investment, Sinha said.

 UTI MF had recently revealed its plans to acquire stakes in a technology company to create a platform to serve its customers better.

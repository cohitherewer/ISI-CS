 Package deals to spice up consumer durables

 New Delhi, Jan. 2: Slackening sales of consumer electronics and durable products are prompting manufacturers to introduce a battery of bundling schemes and easy finance options.

 With the industry registering a single-digit growth in 2005, companies say that such schemes and options not only help them increase sales but also benefit consumers.

 A lot of gift items and marriage purchase takes place during the festive season. A good combo package proves very economical and attractive for consumers. In the process, it also helps companies meet their sales target, says Girish Bapat, vice-president (marketing), LG Electronics India Limited. 

 He adds, In order to push up overall demand, all companies endeavour to introduce a variety of options. Earlier, a price cut was the only measure most companies resorted to, but now there are different ways to attract customers.

 R. Zutshi, deputy managing director, Samsung India, echoes the line of thought: Value-added offers, including specific promotional offers during festival season, finance schemes and innovative marketing offers like product bundling, certainly help in promoting sales. These schemes and offers are introduced keeping in mind factors such as the lifecycle of the product, festival period, etc., and are an integral part of the marketing calendar.

 However, companies admit that giving a free gift item with the purchase of almost every product also proves to be burdensome at times.

 The cost of a gift item is a loss of margin for us. Introduction of such offers only increases our marketing expenses by a minimum 2-3 per cent. But this is an industry trend, so everybody follows it, says Suresh Sukumaran, director (marketing), consumer electronics, Philips India Limited.

 The only way to off-set this incremental cost is by increasing their topline numbers and by aiming for a higher turnover, he adds.

 Manufacturers say consumers always look forward for price cuts. However, somewhere in the process, companies lose their image in the minds of the masses. Price cuts are attractive. People wait for this to happen. But it also creates a bad impression for the brand, says an official in National Panasonic India. 

 While combo offers virtually exist round the year, these schemes become more active during festive seasons. Many dealers also introduce certain schemes at their end. For instance, Delhi saw few LG dealers selling a combo offer of microwave and washing machine.

 GE bags big airline order

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Feb. 21: Air-India, Indian Airlines and Jet Airways have together placed engine orders worth $3 billion to power their new fleet. While Air-India and Jet Airways have placed orders for GE engines, Indian Airlines has inked a deal with CFM International, a 50:50 joint venture between Snecma of France and General Electric Company.

 Air-India will buy GE engines worth more than $2.2 billion at list price to power its new Boeing 777 and 787 fleet.

 The airlines have ordered eight 777-200LRs and 15 777-300ERs, all powered by the GE90-115B engine. It has also ordered 27 787-8 aircraft powered by the GEnx engine. 

 Delivery of the 777s is scheduled to begin in 2007, while the 787s would be delivered from 2008 onwards.

 Snecma, Avio SpA of Italy, and IHI of Japan are revenue-sharing participants in the GE90 programme.

 Testing on the GEnx engine is scheduled to start in early 2006, with engine certification planned for the third quarter of 2007. It will be used in the Boeing 787 from 2008.

 ?The order of 50 Boeing 777 and 787 aircraft powered by GE engines, along with the Boeing 737-800 aircraft for Air-India Express, the budget airline, is the largest so far in India. We expect to gain substantially from the fuel efficiency and performance of the GE engines,? said V. Thulasidas, chairman and managing director, Air-India.

 Jet Airways has placed orders for 20 GE CF6-80E1 engines to power its 10 Airbus A330-200 aircraft. The value of the engine order is more than $300 million.

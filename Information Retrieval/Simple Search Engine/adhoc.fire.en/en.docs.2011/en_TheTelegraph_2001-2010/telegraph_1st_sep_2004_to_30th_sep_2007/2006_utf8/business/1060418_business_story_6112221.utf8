 New Delhi, April 17: ICICI Prudential Life Insurance will redesign a majority of its unit-linked insurance plans (Ulip) to meet the guidelines set by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA).

 The guidelines will not have any major impact on our products since our schemes are long-term. We have 11-12 Ulips, which generate nearly 80 per cent of our sales. We will redesign at least seven or eight of these in the coming months, said Shikha Sharma, managing director of ICICI Prudential Life Insurance.

 The insurance watchdog has asked all insurance companies to adhere to Ulip guidelines from July 1.

 Under the guidelines, companies have to make provision for a fair insurance coverage, make disclosures to facilitate informed decision by policyholders and preserve the long-term nature of insurance products.

 Regarding capital infusion, Sharma said the company plans to infuse fresh capital in the next four to six months to fund its growth plans. A decision will be taken at the companys board meeting on April 26.

 ICICI Prudential, which has invested Rs 1,200 crore, will take a few years to break even, said Sharma. 

 The life insurer plans to launch both Ulips and health insurance plans this year.

 The company will also follow IRDA guidelines on money laundering, but they will not affect the companys products, Sharma added. IRDA has asked insurers to divide clients into two categories ? high-risk and low-risk ? to know the source of their funds.

 On the IRDA-appointed committees proposal to reduce the requirement of a minimum paid-up capital from Rs 100 crore to Rs 50 crore for health insurance, she said the suggestion, if implemented, will not affect the company as its health products are part of the life insurance business. We have no plans to float a separate subsidiary for health insurance products as of now, she added.

 ICICI Prudential manages assets worth Rs 8,600 crore, 40 per cent of which is invested in debt and 60 per cent in equity.

 Meanwhile, the company today launched a comprehensive health insurance scheme that will cover a cancer patients expenses starting from diagnosis to treatment.

 The product cancer care with a cover of Rs 5-25 lakh can be bought by healthy individuals. The premium paid is eligible for tax benefit under section 80D. The product will ensure cash payments to cover direct as well as incidental expenses associated with cancer treatment. The premium for cancer coverage is higher for women as they are more prone to the disease. The differential rate of premium is because of the higher risk level for women, who are more prone to breast and cervix cancer, said ICICI Pru chief actuary V. Rajagopalan.

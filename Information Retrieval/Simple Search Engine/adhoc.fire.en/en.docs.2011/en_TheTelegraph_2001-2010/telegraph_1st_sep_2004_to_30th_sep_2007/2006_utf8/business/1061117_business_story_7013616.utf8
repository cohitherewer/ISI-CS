 Holcim cements Ambuja ties

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Nov. 16: Holcim, the worlds second largest cement company, today strengthened its hold over Gujarat Ambuja Cements (GACL) when it acquired 5 crore shares, or 3.7 per cent, from entities controlled by GACLs founder promoters. The purchase took its holding to 18.5 per cent in the company. These shares were acquired from RKBK Fiscal Services and Radha Madhav Investments.

 According to data available from stock exchanges, 1.65 crore shares were bought by Holderind Investments at a price of Rs 137 per share. Another 3.35 crore shares were acquired from Radha Madhav at the same price. Holcim paid a consideration of Rs 685 crore. This deal price is 32 per cent higher than the Rs 105 per share that the Swiss company paid the Sekhsarias and Neotias when it bought 14.8 per cent in GACL earlier this year.

 The founder promoters had then sold 20 crore equity shares constituting around 14.8 per cent of the equity share capital of GACL and the price also included a non-compete fee of Rs 15 per share.

 After the sale, the founder promoters of GACL held around 9 per cent of GACLs equity. Although Holcim came out with an open offer later, it did not evoke an enthusiastic response from GACL shareholders.

 Holcims move to increase its stake in GACL has reinforced a belief among some observers that it is a prelude to the eventual merger of Associated Cement Companies (ACC) and GACL.

 However, sources close to GACL ruled out such a possibility. Last year, Holcim entered into a strategic alliance with GACL and took over the majority in Ambuja Cement India Ltd (ACIL). Through this local holding company, Holcim acquired a majority in Ambuja Cement Eastern Ltd (ACEL) and a substantial stake in ACC.

 Observers, who aver that Holcim is considering an eventual merger of GACL and ACC, point out that the company is creating the necessary building blocks in this regard. 

 For instance, ACEL will be amalgamated with GACL a move that will raise Holcims stake in the merged entity to around 23 per cent. Todays deal will, therefore, increase its stake in the entity to 27 per cent.

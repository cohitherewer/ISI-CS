 Nine months on, still lost on the fringe

 Chidambaram: Hard talk

 New Delhi, Jan. 1: Nine months after finance minister P. Chidambaram presented the first full budget of the UPA government, India Inc is still struggling to wade through the rigmarole surrounding the fringe benefit tax (FBT).

 The government had come out with the controversial 30 per cent tax on fringe benefits given by firms to employees in its last budget. However, howls of protest from companies as well as salaried taxpayers forced it to issue a series of notifications marginally diluting the tax regime but it still maintains that the tax is a necessity.

 The government, which has already collected Rs 1,750 crore from the FBT, intends to collect up to Rs 3,000 crore from this measure in 2005-06.

 The tax was conceived by the ministry as a means to curb companies, which were trying to pass on rewards to employees through non-taxable perks. However, critics point out that in the process, the government has gone about taxing legitimate corporate expenses such as entertainment and travel, besides employee morale boosting practices such as throwing parties for staff on festive occasions.

 The whole problem with this tax is that it leaves too much power in the hands of the income tax officer to decide which is a fringe benefit and which is not ... it means too much paper work as there is separate filing of returns on these supposed fringes. It also means firms have cut down on normal employee welfare and the tax burden is eventually being passed on to employees, said Sudatto Sen, a senior chartered accountant.

 The confusion has arisen from the definitional ambiguities of the tax itself. For one, it is not clear whether it is a tax on income or a tax on expenditure. The government notification dictates that if an employer incurs expenses under any of the 16 specified heads, he pays more tax.

 While technically it falls under the ambit of the income tax legislation, it is the spirit of execution that has come under serious question. For instance, while medical reimbursements attract FBT if it crosses the threshold limit of Rs 15,000, some perquisites such as employees stock option scheme are exempted.

 The rationale for exempting ESOPs is perhaps premised upon the current buoyancy in the capital markets.

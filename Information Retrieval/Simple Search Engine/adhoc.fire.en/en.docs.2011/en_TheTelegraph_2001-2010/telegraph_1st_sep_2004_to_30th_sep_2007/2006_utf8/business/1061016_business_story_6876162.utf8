 Metro Tyres mulls IPO

 GARIMA SINGH

 New Delhi, Oct. 15: Metro Tyres is considering an initial public offering to raise Rs 100 crore to fund its expansion plans and set up a greenfield project.

 We are planning to set up a greenfield project to manufacture tyres for scooters, motorcycles and three-wheelers. We have identified two locations at Himachal Pradesh and Uttaranchal. 

 Modalities are being worked out and a decision will be taken over the 15 days, said Rummy Chhabra, group managing director of the Rs 400-crore plus Metro group.

 The company is likely to make an investment of Rs 50-100 crore in this plant to manufacture two lakh tyres per month. We will expand the capacity by another two lakh units over the next three years, he said.

 To fund our expansion plans, we may go in for an IPO to raise around Rs 100 crore. Plans are, however, not finalised. A decision will be taken by early next month after our finance department submits the report, said Chhabra. 

 The need for a greenfield project was felt after the companys plans to acquire Bangalore-based two-wheeler tyre firm Falcon fell through.

 Falcon, which sells tyres under its flagship brand Dunlop is a leading manufacturer of motorcycle and scooter tyres with a production capacity of 4.5 lakh tyres per month.

 The two-wheeler market is currently pegged between Rs 1,200 crore and Rs 1,400 crore.

 Metro Tyres will also make an investment of Rs 10 crore to ramp up production of its existing manufacturing facility at Ludhiana. 

 The plant, which at present manufactures 50,000 motorcycle and scooter tyres per month, will be expanded to 100,000 over the next one year.

 About 15-20 per cent of the produce from the new greenfield facility will be taken by Continental AG, under the existing buy-back agreement. The remaining will be utilised by Metro Tyres for the domestic market.

 More than a year back, Metro Tyres had entered into an agreement with Continental AG of Germany to manufacture and market two-wheeler tyres in India with the technological support of the latter. 

 Continental AG now uses 25-30 per cent of Metro Tyres total production in Europe and America where it sells the tyres under the brand name of Continental.

 The remaining products are sold by Metro in the domestic and export markets, including Africa, Egypt and West Asia under the Metro brand name.

 The company, which clocked a turnover of Rs 325 crore last fiscal, is targeting Rs 400 crore this year, said Chhabra.

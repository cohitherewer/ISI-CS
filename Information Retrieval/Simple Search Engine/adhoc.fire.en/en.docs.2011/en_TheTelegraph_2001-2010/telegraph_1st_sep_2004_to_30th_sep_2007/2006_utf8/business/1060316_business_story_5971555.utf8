 Regional realtors in a rating rush

 Mumbai March 15: Real estate developers are making a beeline for credit rating agencies to showcase their abilities to foreign investors. The urge to get rated is more pressing among regional players, which are eager to partner foreign investors. 

 ?Major players like DLF may not need a rating as they are well established in the market. The enquiries are coming from regional players, many of whom are unknown,? a rating agency official said. 

 ?We are getting a large number of enquiries and proposals from regional players with strong credentials. There is a lot of interest shown among them to get corporatised,? said Akash Deep Jyoti, head-corporate and infrastructure sector ratings, Crisil. Sources said a rating not only showcases a developer?s abilities, it also assures the investor about the quality of the exposure in a sector characterised by high risks. 

 ?While there has been an all-round perception about uncertainty and high risk element in the real estate sector, a rating provides stability to the entire set-up,? Jyoti said. He said Crisil has received rating queries from Bangalore, Chennai, Pune, Calcutta, Jaipur and even Bhubaneswar.

 Realtors seeking a rating plan to develop properties in over 4-5 lakh square feet of area. They are not only looking at scaling up of real estate properties under development, but are also venturing into new centers. 

 ?There is a trend among real estate developers to move to new territories to reduce concentration risk. A rating can be of huge help in such times to rope in prospective investors,? sources noted. Till February, Crisil has given ratings to 12 developers, including Akruti Nirman, Ceebros Property Development, Prestige Estates Projects and South City Projects. 

 Crisil rates developers across eight grades. It gives DA1 and DA1+ ratings to excellent companies; DA2 and DA2+ ratings to very good companies; DA3 and DA3+ to good companies; D4 to unsatisfactory performers; and DA5 to poor companies.

 The methodology involves assessing a developers? past performance along with the organisational and financial risk profile. 

 When it evaluates a developers? past performance, Crisil assesses its track record in the areas of law, construction and market. 

 This apart, the rating also takes into account the organisational risk wherein various components of the organisation are analysed. This includes its systems, structure and strategy. 

 There is also the financial risk which is assessed to ascertain the developer?s ability to complete projects on time with adequate cash flows. Here, the developer?s financial profile and flexibility are analysed.

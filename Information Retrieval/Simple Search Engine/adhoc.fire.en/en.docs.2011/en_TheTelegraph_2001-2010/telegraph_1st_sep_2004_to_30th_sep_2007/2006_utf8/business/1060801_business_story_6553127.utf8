 Calcutta, July 31: The National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (Nabard) has drawn up a Rs 2,000-crore plan in collaboration with the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) for a 10-year milk project. 

 Speaking on the sidelines of the third banking conclave organised by the eastern council of Ficci here today, Nabard chairman Y.S.P. Thorat said, Under this programme, financial assistance will be extended to develop comprehensive animal husbandry projects, setting up of chilling plants and so on. 

 However, the project will be different from Operation Milk, a similar programme the government had launched some time ago. Operation Milk focussed on a few states. Our project will include all parts of the country, Thorat said.

 He added that the project would primarily be funded by Nabard and it would take off from the distressed districts of Andhra Pradesh where a number of farmers had recently committed suicide.

 If you closely look at these families, you will find they didnt have any supporting income other than agriculture. On the other hand, no one from the families having an animal husbandry business besides agriculture committed suicide. In a farmer household, generally the women look after the cattle farm and support the male members with an additional earning, Thorat said.

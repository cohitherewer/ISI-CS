 BoB to make best use of capital norms

 Mumbai, Jan. 9: Bank of Baroda (BoB) is confident of meeting its cash needs with the current capital raising norms for the next three years. The bank is unfazed at the likely restrictions that it will face in raising funds from the capital market after the government holding is lowered to 54 per cent following its public offer.

 BoB, which has lined up a follow-on issue of 7.1 crore shares, is optimistic of raising sufficient funds through the Tier-II route to maintain the capital adequacy ratio at over 12 per cent, said bank chairman and managing director Anil K. Khandelwal. The issue will open on January 16 and close on January 20. 

 BoB will gain from the Reserve Banks move to allow banks to treat the entire balance in the investment fluctuation reserve (IFR) as Tier I capital.

 The central bank had asked banks to create a 5 per cent IFR in five years from March 2002 from their profits to cushion interest rate risk for investment portfolios under the held for trading and available for sale categories. Banks were permitted to draw on their IFR to prevent any adverse impact of rising interest rates.

 Khandelwal said while more than Rs 1000 crore of IFR can be shifted to the banks Tier-I capital, it would give the bank lot of space to mobilise funds from the Tier-II category. According to the RBI regulations, the size of a banks Tier II capital can be as much as its Tier I.

 The chairman added that though there are no plans at present to raise funds from the Tier II route, the bank may do this if need be.

 After the issue, the government holding in BoB will come down to 53.81 per cent from 66.83 per cent. 

 Like BoB, there are other nationalised banks where the government holding is either at 51 per cent or will soon be close to this level after their follow-on offerings. These banks are eagerly awaiting the RBI guidelines on raising funds from new instruments such as preference shares or hybrid capital.

 The public offer will increase BoBs capital base to meet the future capital requirements arising from the implementation of Basel II standards. 

 BoB plans to venture into new lines of business such as life insurance and stock broking. 

 The bank plans to develop these businesses by entering into joint ventures and alliances with leading product and service suppliers and is also open to strategic acquisitions. 

 According to officials, the bank is interested in acquiring UTI Securities.

 Gas twins ink 15-yr agreement

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, July 7: The Oil and Natural Gas Corporation will supply gas to GAIL (India) Ltd for the next 15 years at the regulated price of $1.75 per million British thermal units (Btu) under an agreement signed by the duo here today.

 Prior to the execution of this agreement, the sale and purchase of gas between the two companies was pursuant to a memorandum of understanding executed in 1990 and extended further in 1999. 

 Given that gas sold from blocks held in joint venture is priced at $4.75 per million Btu and imported liquefied natural gas bought from spot markets costs over $9 million Btu, this deal will help GAIL supply gas at a cheaper rate.

 Under the new agreement, ONGC has committed to supply GAIL around 60 per cent of the gas produced from its fields in the western offshore, KG basin in Andhra Pradesh, Cauvery basin in Tamil Nadu, Tripura, Gujarat and Assam.

 Initially this would work out to about 60 million standard cubic metres per day of gas.

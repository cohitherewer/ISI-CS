 Hindustan Copper to invest in mines

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 11: Hindustan Copper Ltd, the state-owned primary copper producer, is planning to invest over Rs 1,000 crore to step up production from captive mines. It will help the city-based firm to reduce dependency on import and therefore improve profitability.

 HCL is the only integrated primary copper producer in the country with captive mines, which meets about 60 per cent of the feed for its smelters and the rest is imported. The other two copper producers, Hindalco and Sterlite Industries, have no mining operations in India and their smelters are fed by imports.

 The company is formulating its mine development plan at a time when copper prices have scaled an all-time high in the international market.

 Cashing in on the firm prices, HCL had returned to black in 2004-05 and followed it up with a stellar performance last year.

 However, it still has an accumulated loss of Rs 670 crore on its balance sheet, which could be wiped off through internal generation and government assistance, said Satish C. Gupta, chairman and managing director. Our target is to have a clean balance sheet by this fiscal so that financing the mining projects does not become a problem. 

 Capital recast plan

 HCL will submit a plan to BRPSE to restructure the balance sheet that includes writing down of equity capital and writing off government loans. The proposal is being made in consultation with the ministry of mines. It will also seek a budgetary support for mine development.

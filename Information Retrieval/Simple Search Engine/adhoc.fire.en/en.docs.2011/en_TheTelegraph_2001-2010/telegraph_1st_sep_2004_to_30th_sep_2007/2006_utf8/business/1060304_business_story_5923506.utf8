 New Delhi, March 3: US companies today pitched for further liberalisation in retail and financial sectors in India.

 We, as foreign investors, would like to see countries liberalise their markets more. India should reduce restrictions on foreign investment, especially in banking, insurance and retail, US India CEO Forum co-chair William Morrison said, adding that the speed of liberalising financial and retail sectors in India should be speeded up.

 Morrison said, Sooner than later this will have to be hastened. And we do understand that politics is a part of it.

 He was referring to the opposition of the Left parties to foreign investment in the retail sector. 

 American CEOs also said India needs to get rid of infrastructure bottlenecks and bureaucratic delays, in order to attract more investments from the United States.

 There are problems related to lack of infrastructure and bureaucracy ... this leads to lack of excitement about investing in India, quot; Morrison said. 

 Factors such as poor energy supply, roads, airports, ports, the core infrastructure and bureaucracy are acting as stumbling blocks. Its hard to get approvals and permits; the process is slow and cumbersome, and it takes a long time to settle disputes, added Morrison.

 Speaking on the occasion, Ratan Tata, co-chairman of US India Business Forum and the chairman of the Tata Group, said, Events which have happened in the last few days will help us create partnerships in future.

 Speaking on behalf of the Tata Group, Ratan Tata said, We would ourselves like to look for opportunities in software and hospitality in the US.

 The business forum, comprising select top CEOs from both the countries, has identified six priority initiatives for co-operation to be taken up by both the governments, as well as the private sector, to boost investments.

 These, among other things, include setting up a $5-billion infrastructure development fund to make Mumbai a financial hub and facilitate setting up large-scale special economic zones.

 JP morgan stance

 Investment bank JP Morgan today asked Indian regulators to bring in clarity in foreign institutional investment regulations and take a defined view on participatory notes.

 Sebi should take a defined attitude to participatory notes, JP Morgan India managing director Dominic Price said at a CII Indo-US round table on the financial sector. 

 DSP Merrill Lynch chairman Hemendra Kothari said India should encourage registration of international hedge funds here and one or two cases of money laundering should not spoil the market.

 He said FIIs have brought transparency and quality research to the Indian market.

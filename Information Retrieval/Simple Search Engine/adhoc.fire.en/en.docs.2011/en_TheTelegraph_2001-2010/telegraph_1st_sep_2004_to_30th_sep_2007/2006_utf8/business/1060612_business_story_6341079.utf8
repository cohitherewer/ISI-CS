 Spoilt for choice

 It?s time to file tax returns. Srikumar Bondyopadhyay sifts through a pile of assessment forms to provide clues

 If you are a salaried person, you are probably scratching your head trying to make some sense of the latest brouhaha over the new income tax form ? 2F ? that the government has just notified. Amid all the flak, finance minister P. Chidambaram has backed off from a little tax reform that didn?t go down well with political parties amid growing suspicion that tax sleuths were somehow trying to ferret out more information about how you spend your money than they have till now. 

 But the new form, which remains optional this year till July 31 ? and there?s just a possibility that the so-called draconian bits will be removed next year ? actually creates a bigger problem for an average salaried taxpayer. Until last year, a taxpayer had to choose from a small, confusing pile of forms ? Saral ITS 2, 2D, 3, and 2E ? while deciding to file the returns. 

 If that wasn?t bewildering enough, one now has another option with Form 2F. 

 Right form 

 Actually, you can take your pick from all of them. Let?s try to sift through the little pile of forms ourselves and help you identify which one suits you best. 

 An average salaried taxpayer has three options ? forms 2D, 3 and 2E. Of these, Form 3 is as lengthy and elaborate as the new Form 2F. However, it doesn?t require you to furnish cash flow or expenditure statement. Though Form 3 is lengthy, you don?t have to run to a professional tax expert to compute incomes under various heads, such as income from house property and capital gains arising out of selling a house. There are specific schedules and you can compute it yourself. 

 Not that simple

 Forms 2D and 2E consist of one page each with fewer entries. But this doesn?t mean that these forms are simpler. Though called Saral, these forms had never been easy to handle and ordinary assessees had to approach tax consultants or chartered accountants for help. Besides, they were also required to furnish a number of documents, such as proof of tax deduction at source, as annexures accompanying the Saral form, which were to be filled in duplicate.

 A single-page form cannot give a structured or guided format to compute income under different heads. An assessee must be well versed with different sections of the income tax act to compute the taxable income and tax payable if one has to fill up these forms (2D and 2E) on one?s own. In these forms, the itemwise computation of income is left to taxpayers themselves. Consequently, either the assessees were devising such statements of income that best suited them or seeking the help of professional tax experts who would charge them a fee.

 Capital gain pain 

 If you have made capital gains, short-term or long-term, you can neither use Form 2E nor 2F. You will have to use either Form 2D or 3. 

 In case you decide to use Form 2D, you will have to take the help of a professional tax expert because there is only one entry for capital gains, which means you will have to calculate the gain amount separately and then provide the figure in this column. 

 There is also one entry for income from house property in Form 2D. But to calculate income from house property, one will have to consider a host of other things such as taxes paid to municipal or other local authorities, rent received for the current year and the previous year and repair expenditure.

 For the professionals

 Though businessmen and professionals can file their returns using Form 2D, it is so concise that one always runs the risk of not providing enough information and incur the taxman?s wrath. This is a huge handicap.

 Form 2 (Saral ITS 2) can be used by businessmen, traders and professionals such as doctors and lawyers. However, this is a more elaborate form. 

 Pick and choose

 The question that arises is whether one should keep filing returns in one form. Not necessarily. If you are a salaried person and have no income from house property or made no capital gains, you can use Form 2E. But if in the next year you buy a house and put it on rent or sell a land that you had inherited, you can no longer use Form 2E. You will instead have to file your return either in Form 2D or in Form 3.

 Form 2F, if it is made available next year after some modifications, will be another option. Still, we won?t have a comprehensive form for filing income tax returns, because professionals and people having business income or capital gains or people owning more than one house cannot use this form. They will have to use Form 3, the most convenient form as of now.

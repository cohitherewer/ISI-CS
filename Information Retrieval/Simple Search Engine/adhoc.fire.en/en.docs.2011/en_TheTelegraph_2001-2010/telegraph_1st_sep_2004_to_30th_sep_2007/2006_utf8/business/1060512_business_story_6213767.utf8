 RPL hits a ton on listing

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, May 11: As the clock struck 9.55 am, Mukesh Ambani sounded the gong that heralded the beginning of the second innings of Reliance Petroleum Ltd (RPL) on the bourses. 

 RPL began with a bang on the Bombay Stock Exchange as it listed at Rs 101.95, which immediately put its market capitalisation at Rs 45,878 crore. 

 But the euphoria didnt last as the stock plunged within minutes to hit the days low of Rs 81.10 as sellers scrambled to scoop up gains. 

 When the selling pressure eased a bit, the stock settled in the range of Rs 86 to Rs 90 ? a nifty Rs 30 gain over the issue price of Rs 60 per share to retail investors in last months blockbuster flotation.

 The stock closed at Rs 85.45 on BSE with 7.27 crore shares traded today in a frenzied bout of trading. At the closing price, the company had a market capitalisation of Rs 38,454 crore. There are just about 19 companies with market cap of above Rs 38,000 crore with ONGC and Reliance Industries being the top two.

 On the National Stock Exchange, the stock hit an intra-day high of Rs 105 after listing at Rs 99.95. It closed the day at Rs 85.40 and hit an intra-day low of Rs 85. Over 31 crore RPL shares were traded on the NSE today.

 Dhirubhai Ambanis vision was to develop the Indian capital market so that the man on the street could participate in the progress and growth of the Indian corporate sector. To fulfil that vision, Reliance Industries Ltd hit the primary markets and got listed in 1977, said RIL chairman Mukesh Ambani. 

 We have added 12.6 lakh investors to the Reliance family with the RPL issue, which is the first initial public offer in the last 14 years to hit the primary market, Ambani added. 

 True to the Reliance groups traditions, the RPL issue has set records with the huge investor response it generated, said Nimesh Kampani, chairman, JM Morgan Stanley.

 The order book value of the offer was $32 billion, which is half of Chinas annual FDI amount and six times that of Indias, said Ambani. 

 Earlier, Reliance Petroleum was a part of RIL, which was spun off as a separate entity in 1993 when it came out with a public issue of triple option debentures to raise Rs 862 crore. However, in 2002, the company was merged with RIL. Again, in October 2005, RPL was incorporated as a 100 per cent subsidiary of RIL, to set up a grassroots petroleum refinery and polypropylene plant in the special economic zone at Jamnagar. 

 RPLs new refinery in Jamnagar will have a capacity of 5,80,000 barrels per day and a polypropylene unit with a capacity of 9,00,000 tonnes per annum. The estimated cost of the project is $6 billion, or Rs 27,000 crore, and it is expected to commence production only in December 2008. 

 After commencement, RPL will become the sixth largest refinery in the world and Jamnagar will become the worlds refining capital. One out of every 50 barrels, or 2 per cent of world crude, will be refined at Jamnagar, said Ambani.

 The listing ceremony of RPL saw the whos who of the Indian merchant banking community converging at the Asias oldest stock exchange.

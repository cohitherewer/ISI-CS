 Index to track industry trend

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, April 12: ABN Amro has teamed up with UK-based NTC Research to launch the ABN Amro India Purchasing Managers Index (PMI), which will indicate early trends in the Indian manufacturing sector. It is a composite indicator that will provide information on the health of the manufacturing sector.

 In addition, the survey will also track changes in output, new orders, employment, inventories, prices and supplier delivery times. Index readings above 50.0 signal expansion from the previous month and readings below 50.0 show contraction.

 The index will be announced in the first week of every month. ABN Amro said for March, the PMI showed a reading of 55.1, which signals a robust improvement in operating conditions. This is, however, lower than the level of 56.3 in February, indicating a modest easing in the rate of improvement in business conditions. The marginal fall in the PMI was primarily due to a drop in production and new orders, with the latter falling to a 12-month low. 

 Despite such a slowdown, the foreign bank added that the latest data continued to signal a strong growth in output during the month. 

 New export orders increased, although the rate of expansion eased to a four-month low and remained weaker than that of the total new order growth, the report pointed out.

 Abheek Barua, ABN Amros chief economist for India, said the index is based on data compiled from the monthly responses to questionnaires sent to purchasing executives in over 500 companies covering small, medium and large scale industries. 

 The responses reflect the change, if any, in the current month compared with the previous month based on the data collected by the middle of the month. NTC has been compiling the index since April 2005.

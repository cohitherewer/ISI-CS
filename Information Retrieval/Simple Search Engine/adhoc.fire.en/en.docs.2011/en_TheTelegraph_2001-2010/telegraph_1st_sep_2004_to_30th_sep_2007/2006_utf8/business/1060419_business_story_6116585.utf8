 Boeing plans to cut 900 US jobs

 Wichita, April 18 (AP): Citing defence budget cuts and delays, Boeing Co has announced it would restructure its Wichita operations and lay off about 900 workers, or about 25 per cent of its current work force at the plant.

 The Chicago-based company said its Wichita defence plant will focus on military 747 and wide-body aircraft modifications and upgrades. It also plans to continue its engineering centre, focusing its engineering work here on the B-52 Stratofortress and other defence and civil aviation related businesses.

 There has been much speculation about the future of Boeing in Wichita in the recent months, Derek McLuckey, general manager for Boeings integrated defence systems in Wichita, said in a news release yesterday.

 Today we are telling our employees that we must right size our operations for available work performed in Wichita. And we are telling them we now have to execute a revised business plan in order to ensure our future, he said.

 Boeing said it would issue 60-day layoff notices to 360 workers today. Additional 240 employees will lose their jobs by the end of July and 300 more jobs will be cut in mid-November, the company said.

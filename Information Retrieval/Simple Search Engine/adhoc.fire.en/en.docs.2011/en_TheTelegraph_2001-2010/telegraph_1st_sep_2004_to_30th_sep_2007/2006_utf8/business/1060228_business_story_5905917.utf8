The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Dutch firm likely to exit Century Enka

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Calcutta, Feb. 27: Dutch multinational Acordis is likely to exit Basant Kumar Birla-owned Century Enka Ltd.

 The company, which offloaded its 30 per cent holding through a buyback programme, has further diluted its stake in Century Enka.

 Acordis is going to sell its entire holding in the company. They will exit over a period of time, sources said.

 Today the company offloaded 4.45 per cent stake through an off-market transaction. 

 Century Enka chairman B.K. Birla said the Indian promoters did not buy from Acordis.

 Even though the identity of the buyer was not known, sources said it was an offshore deal with Acordis selling to overseas investors.

 It is quite evident that they would finally exit from the company. After paring 30 per cent holding, it makes little sense to hold on to the rest, sources added.

 Acordis entered the company six years ago following its acquisition of Akzo Nobel in December 2000. 

 Consequently, Sebi directed Acordis to make an open offer for an additional 20 per cent stake. But the company clarified that it viewed the acquisition of stake as purely an investment.

 Last year, Century Enka launched the buyback programme for the non-resident shareholder for Rs 122 a share and Acordis Overseas Investment BV exercised this option. 

 The Century stock today closed at Rs 183.90, up by Rs 6.40 or 3.6 per cent on the National Stock Exchange.

 The Dutch company, having interest in chemical, plastic and man made fibres, had a 38.36 per cent stake. After the buyback, its shareholding stood at 8.36 per cent. 

 With the extinguishment of shares, its shareholding rose to 11.94 per cent.

 With the latest transaction, its shareholding is now at 7.49 per cent.

 The foreign company has two directors on the board of Century. The octogenarian has said this company would go to his grandson Kumar Mangalam Birla in future.

 Century Enka has three plants: Century Enka at Pune, Konkan Synthetic Fibres at Mahad in Maharashtra and Rajashree Polyfil at Bharuch in Gujarat. It produces nylon and polyester filament, speciality and industrial yarns and tyre cord fabrics. 

 Last fiscal, the company recorded sales of Rs 955.13 crore and profit of Rs 52.56 crore. In the first nine months of this fiscal, it clocked sales of Rs 734.14 crore and a profit of Rs 13.93 crore.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Decision on Calcutta airport revamp soon

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Patel: Time to change

 New Delhi, Sept 16: Civil aviation minister Praful Patel today said talks were on with the Bengal and Tamil Nadu governments on plans to upgrade Calcutta and Chennai airports and a final decision would be taken within a month. 

 While the Bengal government wants the upgrade to be carried out by the Airports Authority of India, Tamil Nadu has a different view, he told reporters.

 Civil aviation ministry officials added that the upgrade plans for the two airports one using AAI and the other through the bidding route would be put up before the cabinet within this month.

 A decision to privatise Delhi and Mumbai airports earlier this year sparked nationwide strikes by airport workers who were supported by Left parties. The Delhi airport has been taken over by a consortium led by the GMR group which includes German airport operator Fraport and Eraman Malaysia. The contract to revamp Mumbai the busiest airport in the country was won by a consortium led by GVK and Airports Company of South Africa.

 The Airports Authority has, however, already started taking steps to modernise Calcutta airport. It has sought the help of Aeroport de Paris to design a revamp plan for Calcutta airport. 

 Some work on a two phased modernisation of the Calcutta International Airport has also started. This includes the completion of a fully-automated international cargo terminal, expansion and strengthening of both the runways to take on even bigger aircraft and a second module to be added to the domestic terminal.

 Once given the green light, AAI will invite a global bid for contractors to handle the bulk of expansion and modernisation of the airport.

 Patel also said his ministry will seek a review of the imposition of service tax on air travel and on tour and travel business. Both me and tourism minister Ambika Soni will talk to the finance minister P. Chidambaram and ask him to reconsider the decision to impose service tax on air travel, Patel said. 

 Service tax is now being charged 

 on flying Business Class and First Class on any airline. 

 It is proving to be a big hurdle in increasing the tourist 

 inflow and promoting the civil aviation industry. Hence, 

 we will ask the Finance Minister to review the decision 

 to impose service tax, Patel said.

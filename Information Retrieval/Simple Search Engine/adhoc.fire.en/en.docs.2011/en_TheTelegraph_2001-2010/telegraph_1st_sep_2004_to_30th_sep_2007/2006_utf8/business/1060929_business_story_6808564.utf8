 Green light for Posco SEZ in Orissa

 New Delhi, Sept. 28: An over Rs 53,000-crore proposal of Korean steel firm Posco to set up a multipurpose special economic zone (SEZ) in Jagatsinghpur district of Orissa was among the 33 proposals cleared by the commerce ministrys board of approvals today.

 At the meeting chaired by G.K. Pillai, special secretary, ministry of commerce and industry, and commerce secretary designate, 18 formal and 13 in-principle approvals for SEZs were granted.

 According to the ministry, state government representatives at the meeting confirmed that the zones would come up on waste or barren lands or single-crop plots only.

 The 18 proposals cleared today takes the total number of approvals for establishment of SEZs to 181.

 Meanwhile, commerce minister Kamal Nath has sought Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs intervention to ensure clarity in the SEZ policy in the wake of the Reserve Bank asking commercial banks to treat these zones as real estate projects while giving loans.

 The Prime Minister is looking at it. I have brought it to his notice, Nath said when asked whether the RBIs directive to commercial banks to treat exposure to SEZs as real estate projects would not deter prospective developers.

 Nath said the RBI, in its annual report, had praised the SEZ scheme and said the central bank must be consistent in its stand on SEZs.

 Although the RBIs annual report last month had praised the scheme, it had warned that revenue losses to the government on account of huge tax sops given to SEZ developers could be justified only if sufficient backward and forward linkages were created through the scheme.

 The central bank had directed all commercial banks to treat exposure to SEZs as lending to real estate projects a move that would increase the cost of lending and restrict the flow of funds to these zones.

 The RBI directive came as an embarrassment for the commerce ministry as critics of the SEZ policy had raised fears that these zones are mere real estate projects. They have argued that these zones would enable the promoters to make a killing through the hefty tax concessions that they would be eligible for.

 Nath challenged critics of the SEZ policy to an open debate and asserted that the government would not allow the scheme to be sabotaged.

I am willing to have an open debate on the issue, 

but nobody is coming forward. There are some real concerns, which the government 

will address. But there are some imaginary concerns also. SEZs are the engines 

of growth and the government will not allow the regime to be sabotaged, he said.

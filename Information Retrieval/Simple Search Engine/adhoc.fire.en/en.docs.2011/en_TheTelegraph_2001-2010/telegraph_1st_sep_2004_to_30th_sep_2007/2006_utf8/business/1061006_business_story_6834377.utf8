 Wireless wonder enthrals Intel

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Power-packed

 Mumbai, Oct. 5: Chipmaker Intel is placing big bets on Wi-Max and reckons that there is a great possibility that the cheap wireless alternative for broadband access will spark a brushfire of acceptance in India where tests have already begun.

 Lil Mohan, managing director for emerging market broadband wireless at Intel, says Wi-Max has caught on in a big way in Japan, Australia and Korea.

 Wi-Max will happen next year in India, China and the US, said Mohan, adding that several telecom equipment makers like Nortel and Motorola were also investing big bucks in Wi-Max which can ensure fast data downloads.

 It wont pose a challenge to GSM which will still be the technology of choice for voice traffic. But it will pose a serious threat to CDMA EV-DO, Mohan said while addressing participants at Telecomm India 2006 here today.

 CDMA EV-DO is the 3G technology developed by Qualcomm of the US that telecom companies like Reliance Communications and Tata Teleservices are expected to introduce in the country as soon as the government releases additional spectrum to them.

 Wi-Max can provide download speeds of up to 4 megabits per second and thats easily faster than anything that CDMA EV-DO can offer, said Mohan.

 Wi-Max can also use spectrum more efficiently than high-speed downlink packet access (HSDPA) which is being touted as the mobile telephony protocol of tomorrow with projected data transfer speeds of up to 14.4 Mbits per second.

 Wi-Max is a term coined to describe standard, interoperable implementations of IEEE 802.16 wireless networks. It works much like Wi-Fi but is more robust. In its original form it operated in the 10 to 66 GHz range. But with subsequent revisions, it now works in the 2 to 11 GHz range.

 But there are problems associated with Wi-Max. An Intel assessment of 40 nations found that WiMax is used in two major spectrum blocks 2.3 to 2.7 Ghz and 3.3 to 3.8 Ghz, said Mohan. What this means is that as in the case of 3G spectrum, there are at least two different bands that are widely in use and telecom equipment vendors need to develop dual-band products.

 For instance, US tends to use the 2.5 GHz spectrum while most Asian nations cluster around the 2.3 to 2.5 Ghz band. In India, the problem is that both the bands 2.5 Ghz and 3.5 Ghz are occupied by the department of space, said Mohan though the regulator had released a small block in the 3.4 Mhz for testing purposes.

 The launch of 3G has been similarly stalled because the band of choice for telecom operators the PCS 1900 spectrum is occupied by defence services and the regulator has therefore been forced to announce three bands for 3G: 450 Mhz, 850 Mhz and 2.1 Ghz. 

 BSNL plan

 State-owned Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd is planning a capital expenditure of Rs 17,000 crore this year in order to be able to meet its target of offering 9 million broadband connections in the next three years.

 It plans to nudge up rural teledensity which hovers around 2 against a national average of 11.75 per hundred. 

 The telephony major plans to offer broadband connectivity in 20,000 villages in the next two years and telephone connections in 5.4 lakh out of the 6 lakh villages in the country, said BSNL chairman cum managing director AK Sinha.

 In the case of broadband wireless access, the telecom regulator last week recommended the allocation of 200 Mhz of spectrum in the 3.3 to 3.4 GHz and 3.4 to 3.6 GHz bands to 13 operators in contiguous blocks of 15 MHz each.

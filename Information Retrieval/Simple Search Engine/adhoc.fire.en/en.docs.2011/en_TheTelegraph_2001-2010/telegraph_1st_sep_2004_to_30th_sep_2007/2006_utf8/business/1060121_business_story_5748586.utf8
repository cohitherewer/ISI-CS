 Air Sahara pilots welcome merger

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi/Mumbai, Jan. 20: Air Sahara pilots would keep the airline flying even as they formed a welfare association to protect their interests.

 Air Sahara pilots said they welcomed the merger with Jet Airways and would work with the new management to keep the airline flying, though we have not been informed by the Sahara top management about the change.

 Lets make it clear that nobody has resigned since the merger was announced, though there are enough job offers from rival airlines, a senior pilot said. The association has not elected its office bearers yet.

 However, 11 pilots had resigned since December and are waiting to get clearances from Air Sahara to join other airlines. These pilots were earlier told by Sahara that they will have to wait out a compulsory six months before taking on new jobs. However, they are now likely to be relieved earlier.

 The pilots are at their post and let me assure you all planes will fly as usual, said a founder member of the welfare body. 

 Air Sahara pilots are, however, worried about where Jet will place them in the seniority list. They do not wish to be made junior to Jet pilots who have put in less number of flying hours or years than them. Similarly, they would like their pay packets to be protected. Pilots said they are expecting the management of the two airlines to brief them on these issue soon.

 GoAir destinations

 GoAir, the low-cost carrier of the Wadia group, will add four new destinations ? Baroda, Kochi, Pune and Indore, and two sectors of Chennai-Pune and Pune-Ahmedabad from February. In the next nine months, namely from January to September, we would aggressively look at our route expansion in a progressive manner, GoAir managing director Jeh Wadia said.

 The new destinations and sectors increases GoAirs route strength to 14 cities and 30 flights per day in India.

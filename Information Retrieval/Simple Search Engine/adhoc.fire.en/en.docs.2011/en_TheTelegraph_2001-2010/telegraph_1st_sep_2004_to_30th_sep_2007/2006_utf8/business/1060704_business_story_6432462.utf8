 Alcoa now a takeover target

 Losing Sheen

 Sydney, July 3 (Reuters): Underperforming US aluminium giant Alcoa is ripe for takeover, and analysts see Australian resource companies BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto as likely predators. 

 Either company could manage the funding of a takeover of Alcoa Inc and Alcoas 60 per cent-owned Alumina Ltd in Australia, which broker JP Morgan estimates will cost between $46 billion and $57 billion via a combination of debt and shares. 

 Both Rio and BHP have the capacity to acquire both AWC and Alcoa simultaneously, JP Morgan said in a report. 

 Other analysts said BHP Billiton, with the added benefit of oil and gas assets in Europe, Australia and the Gulf of Mexico, could use cash to buy the companies. 

 Rio Tinto is more likely to employ its script to avert a potential liquidity crunch, according to the analysts. 

 Neither company would comment about the speculation. 

 A takeover of Alcoa and Alumina will dwarf last years $7 billion-plus acquisition of WMC Resources by BHP Billiton and place it among this years big acquisitions in the sector. 

 Arizona copper-belt miner Phelps Dodge Corp wants to acquire Canadas Inco Ltd and Falconbridge Ltd for about $40 billion in a blockbuster deal to assemble the worlds top nickel miner and publicly listed copper producer. 

 That offer surpasses a bid by Teck Cominco Ltd for Inco and one by Xstrata for Falconbridge, underscoring the perceived need among mines to consolidate, analysts said. 

 In steel, Mittal Steel is set to pay $32 billion for European rival Arcelor. 

 Rio at this stage, even more than BHP, needs new blood and Alcoa and alumina are natural fits, said Constellation Capital management analyst Peter Chilton. 

 Shares in Alcoa, which has struggled with its downstream and aerospace divisions in recent years, are little changed from two years ago, despite a 57 per cent rise in world aluminium prices set by the London Metal Exchange. 

 Shares in the much smaller Alumina have faired a bit better, rising 30 per cent since May 2004. 

 Thanks to a boom in demand for nickel, iron ore, copper and other mineral commodities, BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto export en masse to fast-industrialising but resource-starved China. BHP Billitons shares over the same period are up 140 per cent and Rio Tinto shares are 122 per cent higher. 

 But the one thing China does not need is aluminium, said UBS Warburg analyst Glyn Lawcock. 

 Alcoa has been a dog of a performer, considering the rest of the industry has been going ballistic over the last two years, he said. 

 Rising demand for aluminium could come from a range of countries, including India and Southeast Asia to West Asia, South Africa and Eastern Europe.

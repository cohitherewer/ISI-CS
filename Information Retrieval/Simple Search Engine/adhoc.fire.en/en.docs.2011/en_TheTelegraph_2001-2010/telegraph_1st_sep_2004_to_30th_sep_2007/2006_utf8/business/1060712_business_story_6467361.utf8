 Govt frowns at Anils gas buy plan 

 New Delhi, July 11 (PTI): The Anil Ambani groups plan to buy natural gas from Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) at less than half the market price is being opposed by the oil ministry. In an internal note the ministry noted that such a price may lead to a huge financial loss to the government in the form of lower royalty and lower profit petroleum.

 The note prepared for oil minister Murli Deora says RILs sale price of $2.34 per million British thermal unit (Btu) was significantly lower than the $4.75 per million Btu charged for Panna/Mukta and Tapti field gas, where RIL is the joint operator. Highly placed sources said RIL has claimed $2.34 per million Btu sale price of gas produced from its KG basin field to Anil Ambanis Reliance Natural Resources Ltd (RNRL) was the same price it had bid successfully for the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) tender.

 However, the directorate general of hydrocarbons (DGH), the countrys top nodal agency, said, The reference gas price quoted by RIL to NTPC has not yet been finalised between the two sides and is stated to be sub-judice.

 Besides, RILs proposal had not been approved by the field operating and management committees, where the companys minority partners, DGH and Canada-based Niko Resources, are members, the note said quoting DGH.

 The agreement between RIL and RNRL (for sale of KG basin field gas), which is a part of their demerger agreement and the gas supply master agreement (GSMA), was signed between them when RNRL was a subsidiary of RIL. Hence, the GSMA does not appear to meet the production sharing contract (PSC) criteria of arms-length competitive price discovery for sale of gas, the note said.

 The price formula proposed by RIL will adversely impact the government share of profit in petroleum and royalty, it added.

 According to the PSC entered into by oil and gas field operators, the government as the owner of the fields is entitled for a share in production called profit petroleum and royalty.

 The DGH has mentioned that price/formula proposed by RIL would adversely affect the governments interest by reducing royalty and profit petroleum, the note said.

 DGH added, It is estimated that gas price above $4 per million Btu will enable the government to reach 85 per cent share in profit petroleum from the (RIL) block.

 RIL had, in April, sought approval for selling gas to RNRL at a delivered price of $3.18 per million Btu, with the well-head price being $2.34 per million Btu.

 In its letter to the ministry, RIL had said it would sell 28 million standard cubic metres of natural gas from its Bay of Bengal fields to RNRLs 5,600-mw Dadri power project in Uttar Pradesh for $2.34 per million Btu. Added to this, would be $0.12 per million Btu marketing cost and another $0.72 per million Btu cost of transporting it from Kakinada in Andhra Pradesh to Dadri.

 RIL, in its April 14 letter to the ministry, said the contract price was the same as the price bid by RIL in an international competitive bidding process for supply of gas to state-run NTPC for the proposed expansion of its Kawas and Gandhar power plants in Gujarat.

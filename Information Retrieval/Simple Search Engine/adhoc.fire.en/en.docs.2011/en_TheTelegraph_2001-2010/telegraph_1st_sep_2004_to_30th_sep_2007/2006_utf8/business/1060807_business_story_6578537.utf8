The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 To diversify or not is the dilemma in tea

 Calcutta, Aug. 6: The tea industry is divided on the merits of the proposal to diversify into other crops.

 Tata Tea, which favours diversification, is experimenting with multi-cropping in two gardens in the Northeast, Borjan and Hatikuli.

 Tata Tea managing director Percy Siganporia had said cultivating spices and vegetables would yield better profit.

 But McLeod Russel, with an annual production of 70 million kg, prefers to focus only on tea.

 We are growing jatropha on an experimental basis but have no plans of diversifying formally. We prefer to focus on producing world-class tea and not diversify, said Aditya Khaitan, managing director of McLeod Russel.

 Tea covers around 60 to 70 per cent of the plantation land, with the remaining in forestry, labour housing and factories. Besides, there is some fallow land.

 Camellia Group, which has a majority stake in Goodricke, wants to explore diversification opportunities . 

 We are on the lookout for diversification activities in India. It could be in wine and macadamia nuts where the group already has a presence through different companies and operations, said Peter A. Leggatt, chairman of Lawrie Plantation Services, Camellia Group.

 Duncans Goenka Group, which has set a target of 15 million kg this year, has diversified on a small scale into other crops.

 G.P. Goenka, group chairman of Duncans Goenka Group, said the company was planning to open its Runglee guest house to tourists but is having second thoughts because of the costs in promoting tourism and building infrastructure such as roads.

 A new crop requires a different set of labour skills. Plantations need to train existing workers or hire more, Goenka added.

 In Bengal, the state government is yet to give a blanket approval on using plantation land for activities other than tourism.

 In Dooars plantations, ginger and honey provide other sources of income besides tourism.

 Sometimes the plantation management sets up the business, the cost of which is then deducted from the workers salary, but the ultimate proceeds go to them. The activities are also managed by the workers, said Shiv K. Saria, chairman of the Siliguri Tea Auction Committee.

 Most companies are cautious as tea like any other commodity has its own cycle.

 Diversification to jatropha cultivation, which helps the cause of bio-fuel, would be given special emphasis in the Eleventh Five-Year Plan, Tea Board chairman Basudeb Banerjee said.

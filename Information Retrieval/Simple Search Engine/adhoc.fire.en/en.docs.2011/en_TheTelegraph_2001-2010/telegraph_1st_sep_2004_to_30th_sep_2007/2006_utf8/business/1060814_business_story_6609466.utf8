 CPT to set up port at petrochem hub

 SAMBIT SAHA

 New horizon

 Calcutta, Aug. 13: Calcutta Port Trust (CPT) is planning to set up a port at the proposed chemical hub in east Midnapur.

 The port is acquiring land at Jellingham in Nandigram where the hub will be developed. CPT chairman A.K. Chanda said the new facility would cater to the chemical and petrochemical industries that are expected to come up there.

 The chemical hub featured prominently in the agreement that the Bengal government signed on July 31 with the Salim group of Indonesia and its Indian partners to develop a host of infrastructure projects in the state.

 According to the plan, a chemical estate, including a special economic zone (SEZ), will be developed on 10,000 acres at Nandigram in a 50:50 joint venture with West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation (WBIDC).

 The port also aims to acquire 10,000 acres there to build facilities to handle chemical, petrochemical and hazardous cargo.

 The draft at Jellingham, which is also the navigational channel for Haldia Dock Complex, is about 9 metres.

 CPT will first fill up the land with silt scooped up during regular dredging operations that the port undertakes to keep the river navigable. The silt is now dumped into the river itself.

 Chanda said 2,500 acres would be taken up for this work alone at present.

 The port has earmarked Rs 50 crore for acquiring land and is in talks with the state government for the purpose. It will initially acquire 1,100 acres there.

 The operations at Nandigram could be an extension of Haldia. 

 The agreement with the Salim group also includes building a four-lane road bridge over Haldi river to link the chemical hub and Haldia port.

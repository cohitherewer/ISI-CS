 Calcutta, Jan. 29: LG Electronics India Pvt Ltd is set to manufacture CDMA handsets by the second half of this year. It is also working on two models with the global positioning system (GPS), which will be launched through a service provider in the second quarter of the calendar year.

 The scheduled date for the GPS service will depend on the governments directives on the spectrum policy for a 3G network, which is likely to come between June and July.

 The seven CDMA handsets bundled with Reliance were imported from Korea. However, after LG has set up its greenfield manufacturing unit at Pune at an investment of Rs 7-8 crore, the sets will be indigenously manufactured, said H.S. Bhatia, national product group head, GSM mobile phones.

 The Pune facility will have an installed capacity of 2 crore phones annually, which LG plans to achieve by 2010.

 The company will focus on the GSM business in 2006. This business had registered a turnover of Rs 220 crore last calendar year and is set to contribute Rs 600 crore this year to the companys turnover of Rs 9,000 crore.

 LGs strategy is to penetrate the market by launching models with attractive features and pricing, increase the dealer network from 11,000 to 20,000 for GSM phones by December and undertake innovative marketing and promotional activities.

 In India, there are 54 million cellphone connections, of which 25 per cent are on the CDMA platform and 75 per cent on GSM. The CDMA user base grew at 34 per cent last fiscal and is fast gaining grounds due to attractive schemes, which GSM operators are trying to match.

 A key factor has been the drop in the price of colour handsets offered with connections, said Bhatia.

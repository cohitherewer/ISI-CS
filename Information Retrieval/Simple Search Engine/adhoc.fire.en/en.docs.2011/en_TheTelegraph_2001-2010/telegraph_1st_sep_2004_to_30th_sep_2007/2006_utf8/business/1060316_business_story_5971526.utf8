 Small firms to propel Microsoft revenue

 Seattle, March 15 (Reuters): Microsoft Corp said on Tuesday it aims to boost annual sales to small businesses by more than 9 per cent, outpacing the overall increase in technology spending by companies with fewer than 50 workers.

 Speaking on the sidelines of Microsofts Small Business Summit, the companys new chief operating officer, Kevin Turner, said there are seven million small businesses in the United States and more cropping up in China and India.

 Turner, who joined Microsoft last year from Wal-Mart Stores Inc, said overall technology spending by small businesses is growing at 9 percent a year.

 So we better do more than that, because I think we have a big opportunity, said Turner, stressing that the target was an aspiration and not a financial projection.

 Microsoft does not break out sales to small businesses.

 Targeting up to 30 million businesses worldwide with 10 or fewer employees, Microsoft ? along with Oracle Corp, SAP and IBM ? are trying to soften the blow of slower IT spending by large corporations.

 Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft announced plans to lower the minimum financing available to small business owners for technology products to $3,000 from $10,000.

 It has aggressively marketed its small business accounting software and offered rebates to lure customers away from rival Intuit Incs popular QuickBooks software.

 It is also testing Office Live, a set of applications and services to help small businesses to create and manage Web sites, maintain corporate e-mail accounts.

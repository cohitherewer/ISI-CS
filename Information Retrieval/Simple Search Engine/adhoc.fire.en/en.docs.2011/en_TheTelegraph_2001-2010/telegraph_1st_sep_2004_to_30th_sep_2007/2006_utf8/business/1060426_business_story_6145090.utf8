 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Bitter-sweet

 Mumbai, April 25: Three leading pharmaceutical companies ? Wockhardt, Cipla and Nicholas Piramal ? today declared their quarterly numbers, which ranged from robust to disappointing.

 While Wockhardt reported an 87 per cent drop in earnings to Rs 4.9 crore for its first quarter ended March 31, 2006, Cipla posted an 81 per cent rise in net profit at Rs 190.77 crore during the same quarter, which was its fourth.

 Ciplas total sales increased 61 per cent to Rs 876.15 crore for the quarter ended March 31 from Rs 545.21 crore a year ago. 

 Last fiscal, it reported earnings of Rs 600.08 crore (Rs 409.61 crore) on total sales of Rs 3,020.89 crore (Rs 2,327.61 crore).

 Nicholas Piramal (NPIL) reported a net profit of Rs 37.59 crore for the fourth quarter ended March, 2006 against a loss of Rs 12.48 crore in the same period last year.

 Net sales posted a 57.3 per cent growth at Rs 330 crore.

 Nicholass domestic formulations business reported a robust performance during the quarter with sales of Rs 230 crore compared with Rs 130 crore a year ago.

 For Wockhardt, it was not only the stand-alone results that were disappointing. On a consolidated basis, the company reported a loss of Rs 3.7 crore during the period compared with a net profit of Rs 41.7 crore a year ago. 

 Wockhardt said the loss was due to one-time write-offs and expenses towards inorganic initiatives amounting to Rs 23 crore. 

 Further, the company had to provide Rs 38 crore for discounts given at various levels of the pharmaceutical chain in the US that affected its sales.

 While it is learnt that these discounts were spread over a period of three years, Wockhardt said appropriate systems have been implemented to ensure that such expenses are properly accounted for on a timely basis.

 The company said total income during the quarter rose to Rs 264.7 crore from Rs 212.10 crore last year. On a consolidated basis, the groups total income rose to Rs 354.3 crore from Rs 318.7 crore last year. 

 Our operations during the quarter resulted in a 44 per cent growth in operating profits. Our core operations continue to do well. However, we took a hit on net profit during the quarter because of one-time write-offs. I take this as a part of our US business learning curve, said Habil Khorakiwala, Wockhardt chairman.

 Oil officers fume, stick to strike plan

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 4: Ignoring a last-minute appeal by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and his assurance that a pay revision committee would be set up, officers of state-owned oil firms tonight decided to go on an indefinite strike from tomorrow after marathon talks with the government failed.

 The strike is on, despite the Prime Ministers appeal, Ashok Singh, president of the Oil Sector Officers Association (OSOA), said.

 The association had two rounds of meetings with petroleum minister Murli Deora, lasting about four-and-half hours, after which Singhal told reporters that the strike was on because nothing came out of the meeting. The Prime Minister, who was apprised by Deora of the talks he had with the association, agreed in principle to set up a panel to review wages of the oil PSUs as also other central undertakings and appealed to them to desist from striking work.

 While there were fears that jet fuel supply could be hit immediately, domestic and international carriers said their operations would not be affected in the short run.

 The adamant stand of OSOA prompted the government to enlist the support of the army and the airforce to handle critical operations. If required, the army will help out at oil installations, while airforce personnel will assist in refuelling passenger aircraft.

 The oil companies have drawn up contingency plans for the critical operations, to avoid hardship to consumers.

 A senior IOC official told The Telegraph that 8,000 officers in the middle-rung of the oil companies will go on strike. He said junior officers as well as those above the rank of deputy general manager, numbering around 22,000, will be deployed to man key facilities such as oil depots, LPG bottling plants and aviation refilling stations. 

 Officials said retired personnel have also been called up for assistance.

 The man who connects the jet fuel hose to the aircraft will be working as will the men who handle the LPG cylinders at the bottling plant. The duties of senior officers have been assigned to the key areas required to keep operations running, he remarked 

 However, OSOA president Ashok Singh claimed all flights would be hit and motorists would also face trouble in a day or two as all the officers would be striking work since the talks have failed. The refineries would also start cooling off. 

 Breaking protocol, Deora today went to the Indian Oil headquarters to meet the OSOA leaders. However, his assurances on the petroleum ministry being sympathetic to the demands and the governments willingness to consider the case for a hike failed to mollify the union.

 OSOA insists that the government has reneged on its commitments made way back in 2000. 

 The association represents middle-level level officers of all PSU oil companies Indian Oil. Bharat Petroleum, Hindustan Petroleum, IBP, ONGC and OIL. 

 Demanding the implementation of the Jagdish Mohan committees proposals on pay hike, OSOA is seeking a merger of 50 per cent of DA with their salaries and a share in the profits of the oil companies.

 The petroleum ministry is reportedly sympathetic to these demands but wants the issues to be settled by the department of public enterprises. 

 The government is treading the fine line in this issue. The department of public enterprises feels officers of other PSUs will follow suit in claiming a pay hike if the government agrees to meet the demands of the oil sector officials.

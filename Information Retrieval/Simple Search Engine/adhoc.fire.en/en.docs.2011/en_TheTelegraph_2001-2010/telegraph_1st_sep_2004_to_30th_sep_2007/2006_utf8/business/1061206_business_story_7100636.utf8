 FDI flow to soar in air cargo

 Our Special Correspondent

 Ready for take-off

 New Delhi, Dec. 5: The government plans to increase foreign direct investment ceiling in air cargo and helicopter businesses from 49 per cent to 74 per cent soon.

 The government might consider the move in the aircraft chartering business as well, civil aviation minister Praful Patel said here today.

 The government is deliberating on the matter ... while we have an overall FDI cap of 49 per cent in the aviation sector, we have to liberalise areas like air cargo, helicopters and sea-planes and the cap could reasonably be put at 74 per cent, he said at a cargo conference of the International Air Transport Association. 

 The country will need 500 freighters within 10 years, Patel said. Our cargo requirements are going to grow exponentially, he added. India is poised for a retail revolution and, therefore, there is great optimism for cargo in the country.

 The government has set a target of 20 per cent increase in exports and expects liberalising air cargo FDI rules will help improve the airline infrastructure needed to ship out this increased cargo. 

 The country now has only one specialised domestic cargo airline, Blue Dart Express Ltd, which is controlled by Deutsche Post AGs DHL Worldwide Express.

 However, Indian Airlines, Air-India and low-cost carrier Deccan Aviation are planning to set up cargo carriers. 

 Congestion fee opposed

 New Delhi, Dec. 5: The government will ask airlines to desist from charging a air traffic congestion surcharge of Rs 150 per passenger. I do not accept this position. I will, in fact, ask all airlines not to impose this surcharge, Patel said.

 Last week, Kingfisher, Jet Airways and Air Sahara decided to impose a congestion surcharge of Rs 150 per ticket.

 The minister said while airlines were free to raise fares if they so wished, surcharges of this sort could not be raised. If they want to raise fares, they can do it because the government does not interfere in fixation of fares, he said.

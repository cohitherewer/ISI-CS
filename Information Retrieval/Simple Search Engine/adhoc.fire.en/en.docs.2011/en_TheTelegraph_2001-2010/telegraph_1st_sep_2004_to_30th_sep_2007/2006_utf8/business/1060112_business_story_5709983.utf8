The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Beeyu set to form JV with Tata Coffee

 Calcutta, Jan. 11: Beeyu Overseas Ltd is close to finalising a marketing joint venture, exclusively for the export market, with Tata Coffee Ltd, the second largest exporter of coffee in the country.

 Beeyu executive chairman B.P. Singh said his company would hold a majority stake in the venture, which is likely to be named Alliance Coffee Ltd (ACL).

 The new unit will start operating from April 1. The entire exports of Tata Coffee will be carried out through this venture, Singh added.

 Beeyu acts as the marketing agent for Tata Coffee in Russia. Around 80 per cent of Tata Coffees exports are headed towards Russia.

 Tata Coffee, a Tata Tea subsidiary, hardly sells its produce in the domestic market. Of the 6,000 tonnes exported, it sells 5,000 tonnes to Russia and the CIS countries.

 Tata Coffee managing director M.H. Ashraff said the marketing venture could be finalised in the next couple of months.

 We are working out the details of the joint venture. A final decision is yet to be taken, Ashraff told The Telegraph. The joint venture could clock a Rs 100-crore turnover in a short period of time, said Singh. 

 India exports 22,000 tonnes of instant coffee with Nestle topping the chart, followed by Tata Coffee, Continental and Hindustan Lever, in that order.

 The country exports almost three times more than it consumes locally. Instant coffee consumption in India stands at 8,000 tonnes.

 Singh said Beeyu will hold an 80 per cent stake in the marketing company and it would have a majority on the board. The equity capital will not be more than Rs 1 crore to begin with.

 Tea business

 At present, coffee contributes 50 per cent of Beeyus turnover, which is set to be Rs 40 crore this fiscal. Once the marketing company is formed, the coffee business will go to the new venture leading to a sharp drop in turnover.

 In order to arrest this downfall, BOL is expanding the tea business by 2.5 times from 4,000 tonnes to 10,000 tonnes. As a consequence, the turnover will likely to be Rs 50 crore in the next fiscal.

 At present, it produces 2,000 tonnes of tea in the south and buys the same quantity from the market.

 Going forward, it intends to produce 8,000 tonnes from south India and another 2,000 tonnes from Bengal.

 The company is making fresh investment to ramp up production to touch 30,000 tonnes in three years, Singh said. With the spurt in domestic consumption of tea, bulk tea prices is set to rule firm in the near future.

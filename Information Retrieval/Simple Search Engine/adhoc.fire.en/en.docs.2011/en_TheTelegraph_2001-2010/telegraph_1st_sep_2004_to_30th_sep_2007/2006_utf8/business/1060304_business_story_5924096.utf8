 Pact on cyber security 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 3: The India-US Cyber Security Forum (IUSCSF) will shortly sign a memorandum of understanding (MoU) formalising the roadmap for co-operation on information security issues.

 The MoU, expected to be signed in the next few months, will formalise the contours of co-operation on various issues, including exchange of technical documentation, information security audit tools and cyber forensic trading between the two countries, said Arvind Gupta, joint secretary, National Security Council Secretariat (NSCS).

 Two additional areas of co-operation ? transportation and financial sectors ? are being discussed to be included in the scope of IUSCSF ? and safeguards for sub-outsourcing by India are also under discussion, said Gupta while speaking at a conference on Indo-US economic co-operation organised by the CII and Indo-US Business Council here.

 A draft protocol on cyber security, between NSCS and the state department is also under discussion. The India-US Cyber Security Forum was established in 2001. The forum focuses on cyber-security, cyber-forensics and related research and works towards enhancing co-operation among law enforcement agencies on both sides in dealing with cyber crime. 

 It has been agreed that the law enforcement agencies ? Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In) under the department of information technology and US National Cyber Security Division ? would share expertise in analysis of trace viruses, software worms and network traffic analysis. 

 As part of counter-terrorism efforts, India and the US on Thursday agreed to enhance co-operation between law enforcement agencies of the two countries in tackling cyber crimes. Gupta said the MoU would envisage greater interaction between the defence services of the two nations through sharing of experiences in organisational, technological and procedural aspects. 

 It has also been decided that co-operation between the two countries will be stepped up in sharing of expertise in analysis of traces of virus and worm software, also known as artifact analysis, network traffic analysis, and exchange of information. 

 Infosys MD Nandan Nilekani called for a totalisation agreement between India and the US that allows an employee to be covered under the social security system of only one country, usually the home country.

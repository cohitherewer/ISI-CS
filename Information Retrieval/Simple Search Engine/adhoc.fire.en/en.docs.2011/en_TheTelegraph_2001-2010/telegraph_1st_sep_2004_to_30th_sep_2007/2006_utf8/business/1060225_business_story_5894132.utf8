 State Bank to go hunting for funds

 Purwar: Money matters

 Mumbai, Feb. 24: The State Bank of India (SBI) plans to raise close to Rs 2,000 crore through a subordinated debt issue early next fiscal to meet the strong credit demand. Subordinated debt is a long-term instrument used by banks to raise additional capital.

 SBI is also looking at raising resources through new instruments such as hybrid capital, which is likely to be floated by the end of 2006-07, bank chairman A.K. Purwar said today.

 The bank raised close to Rs 3,300 crore through a subordinated debt issue last December to meet the robust credit demand. However, it has been forced to look at raising additional capital as the requirement for funds from companies and other sectors continue to rise.

 ?It is for the first time that I am seeing all the sectors of the economy ? rural, agriculture, infrastructure, corporate, retail and small and medium enterprises ? doing well. If the demand for credit continues in the same way as before, we will require additional capital. The bank has headroom for subordinated debt and we plan to raise a couple of thousand crores,? Purwar said.

 SBI was also studying the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) guidelines on raising funds through innovative instruments such as hybrid capital, he added. The bank is likely to tap this source by the end of next fiscal or in the beginning of 2007-08.

 In January, the RBI announced detailed guidelines to enable banks to raise funds by issuing additional instruments such as Innovative Perpetual Debt Instruments (IPDI) that can be treated as Tier 1 capital and debt capital instruments, which can be included under Upper Tier II capital. These funds will meet both the increasing business requirements and the Basel II norms that will be implemented from March 2007. 

 SBI has networked 10000 branches of its group banks. It had partnered with Datacraft India, an IT solutions and services company, to complete the project that involved high technological complexity and has a wide reach.

 The SBI chief admitted that the bank was looking at acquiring a bank in Bangladesh, even as it is keen to establish a presence in Pakistan. The bank would look at acquiring small and medium-sized banks to grow through the inorganic route, he said adding that SBI was even willing to spend up to $100 million on a single deal.

 He also said there was an upward pressure on interest rates and liquidity in the banking system was tight. While SBI had recently raised interest rates on housing loans, Purwar said the bank would take a call on interest rates after the Union Budget. Purwar, however, ruled out the prospect of interest rates on retail loans touching the same levels as seen a few years ago (over 13 per cent).

 According to the SBI chairman, customers have increasingly been banking through other channels like ATMs and Internet banking instead of coming to a branch. In the case of the SBI group, ATM transactions has shot up from 60 lakh per month in March 2004 to over 3 crore in January this year and the amount withdrawn has breached Rs 5000 crore.

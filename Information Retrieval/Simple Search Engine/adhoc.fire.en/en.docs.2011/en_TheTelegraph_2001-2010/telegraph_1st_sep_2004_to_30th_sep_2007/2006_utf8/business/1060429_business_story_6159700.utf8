 New Delhi, April 28: Agriculture minister Sharad Pawar has said the government may allow millers and bread makers to import wheat directly under the open general licence (OGL) system.

 Pawar, however, ruled out the possibility of the government importing more than 3.5 million tonnes of wheat in the current year.

 The government wheat import will not exceed 3.5 million tonnes this year. We have to import only to bridge the shortfall of stocks for the public distribution system and not necessarily because of an availability crunch, Pawar said on the sidelines of a meeting organised by the National Co-Operatives Development Council.

 There are suggestions to allow flour mills and bread and biscuit makers to import wheat under OGL at a reduced duty. We are seriously considering allowing actual users to import under OGL, said Pawar. 

 The countrys total foodgrain production this year is expected to be 209.32 million tonnes, 4.71 million tonnes more than in 2004-05.

 Pawar said tenders for procuring additional 3 million tonnes of wheat would be issued immediately.

 He said the level of wheat procurement this year was low because the prevailing market prices were high compared with previous year.

 The government decided to import wheat after official procurement agencies were unable to buy sufficient stocks from farmers according to the buffer stock norms.

 Meanwhile, the government has managed to procure sufficient stocks of rice thanks to better production in Chhattisgarh, Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Haryana. 

 Pawar was guarded on the forecast of the meteorological department about deficient rainfall this monsoon season.

 We will have to see how the monsoon actually shapes up. The situation is not as bad as has been projected, he said.

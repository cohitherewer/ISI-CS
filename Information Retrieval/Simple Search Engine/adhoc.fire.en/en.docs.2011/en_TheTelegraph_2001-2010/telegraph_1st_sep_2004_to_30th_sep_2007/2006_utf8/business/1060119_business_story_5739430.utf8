 REL net rises 22%

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Jan. 18: Reliance Energy (REL), a group company of Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Enterprises (ADAE), has posted a 22.22 per cent year-on-year rise in net profit for the third quarter of the current financial year. 

 The utility major clocked a net profit of Rs 165 crore for the three months ended December 31 compared with Rs 135 crore in the corresponding period of the previous fiscal.

 The rise in earnings was powered by a growth in its core income from electricity sale, even as the contribution from other income, including that from engineering procurement and construction division (EPC) and contracts, declined during the quarter compared with the same period last year.

 While income from EPC and contracts came down to Rs 173.07 crore during the October-December period last year from Rs 190.74 crore in the previous corresponding period, the other income declined to Rs 149.28 crore from Rs 205.62 crore. 

 With the net sales from electrical energy standing higher at Rs 815.28 crore (Rs 738.39 crore), the total income during the period increased marginally to Rs 1137.63 crore from Rs 1134.75 crore in the year-ago period.

 For the nine months ended December 31, the earnings of Reliance Energy, however, stood 31.24 per cent up at Rs 481 crore from Rs 366 crore in the corresponding previous period. The total income during the period grew 13 per cent to Rs 3,383 crore from Rs 3,003 crore.

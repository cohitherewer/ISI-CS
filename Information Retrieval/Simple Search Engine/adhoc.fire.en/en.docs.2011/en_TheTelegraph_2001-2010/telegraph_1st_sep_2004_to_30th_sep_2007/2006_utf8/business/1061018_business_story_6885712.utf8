 Jet loss gains height in second quarter

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Trying times

 Mumbai, Oct. 17: Jet Airways, the countrys largest airline in terms of market share, has gone into a deep nosedive and reported a loss of Rs 55.1 crore in the second quarter ended September 30.

 The figure is a lot worse than what the street expected with analysts projecting a loss of Rs 25 crore. They were expecting the airline to claw back a bit from the first quarter loss of Rs 45 crore. But its only got worse and the first signs of jitters are beginning to be felt across the airline industry.

 In the second quarter of 2005, the airline had posted a profit of Rs 68.6 crore.

 The revenues of the airline grew by 38 per cent to Rs 1,820 crore for the quarter from Rs 1,324.2 crore achieved during the same period last fiscal. 

 The loss before tax amounted to Rs 72.5 crore, which includes sale-leaseback compared with profit before tax of Rs 110.8 crore achieved during the same period last year. 

 Domestic operations of the airline accounted for 83 per cent of total revenues for the quarter against 88 per cent last year quarter. 

 Reflecting the pinch felt from the increasing number of airlines, the seat factor for the quarter was lower at 65.6 per cent against 71.8 per cent for the same period last year. 

 The company generated a pre-tax profit of Rs 38.9 crore on its domestic operations against Rs 139.1 crore during the same period last year. This includes a profit of Rs 161.7 crore on the sale and subsequent lease-back of three Boeing 737 aircraft in the second quarter of this year. 

 But what is really worrying is that if we exclude the sale-leaseback, the domestic operations generated a pre-tax loss of Rs 122.6 crore. 

 Back in the first quarter, the airline had attributed its Rs 45 crore loss on international operations. Clearly, the domestic operations are not providing much comfort either.

 According to the company, continued expansion of industry capacity, fare-induced demand growth and increase in fuel and other operating costs resulted in mounting losses in domestic operations.

 International operations accounted for 17 per cent of revenues in the second quarter compared with 12 per cent during the same period last year. 

 The airline generated a pre-tax loss in its international operations of Rs 111.4 crore against a pre-tax loss of Rs 28.3 crore during the same period last year. 

 Jets poor showing throws into stark relief the problems that all domestic airlines are currently facing and explains why they have now decided to form a federation to lobby for a set of fiscal incentives from the government in order to ensure they dont spiral into losses.

 The 10 scheduled airline companies of the country has decided to form Federation of Indian Airlines to address the problems ailing the aviation industry and seek solutions.

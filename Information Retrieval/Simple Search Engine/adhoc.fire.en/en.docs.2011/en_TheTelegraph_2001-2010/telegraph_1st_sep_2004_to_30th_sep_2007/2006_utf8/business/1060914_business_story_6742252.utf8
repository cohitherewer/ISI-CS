 Marico finds its Fiancee

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Sept. 13: Marico Ltd has acquired Egypt-based Ready groups hair care brand Fiancee. 

 The deal, the size of which Marico did not divulge, involves the acquisition of the brand and direct investment in Egypt along with a non-compete clause with the Ready group. 

 This footprint in Egypt will help us widen our stride in the international hair care market, said Ready group chairman Sayed El Ready.

 The consideration for the deal will be paid over the next six months in two tranches based on the brands performance, the company said in a statement. Marico, using a short-term loan facility, has already paid one. 

 Marico will take a fresh look at its financing pattern and will modulate the debt and equity mix suitably. The shareholders of Marico have already approved a financing plan that envisaged funds of up to Rs 500 crore being raised by way of debt and/or equity. 

 Fiancee commands a 20 per cent share of the Rs 17-crore Egyptian hair care market. The brand is a market leader in key segments such as gels and gel creams. Maricos acquisition of the brand gives it access to the manufacturing and sales infrastructure nurtured by the Ready group over the past 15 years or so. 

 Maricos international business turnover during 2006 was Rs 117 crore, almost 10 per cent of the groups revenues. This buyout is expected to provide a fillip to Maricos international operations. Some of the companys recent acquisitions include Camellia and Aromatic two Bangladeshi soap brands; Manjal, a regional brand in Kerala and Nihar, Hindustan Levers coconut oil. Snapping up Nihar, a Rs 120-crore brand, from HLL was a major pick for the company. These brands also have a distribution reach that complements Maricos network.

 This acquisition, our fifth in 18 months, will enhance shareholder value. The diversity, which Fiancee brings to our portfolio, will also help us moderate the share of our flagships in turnover and profits, said Milind Sarwate, CFO of Marico.

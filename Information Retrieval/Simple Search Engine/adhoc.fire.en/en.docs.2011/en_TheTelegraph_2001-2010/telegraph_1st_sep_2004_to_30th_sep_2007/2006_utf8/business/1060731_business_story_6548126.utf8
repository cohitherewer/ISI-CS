 Time to run to bank, again

 If the stock market turbulence troubles you, put your funds in banks. 

 While equity market experts are now revising downward their forecast about annual returns from investment in stocks, at least for the next one year, because of spiralling oil prices and surging interest rates, bank deposits for a year have become lucrative, assuring an annual return of 8 per cent.

 Taking a cue from the recent round of rate hike by the Reserve Bank, a number of banks have raised their deposits rates, particularly for one-year fixed deposits. 

 First on the block was Yes Bank, which is offering an interest rate of 8 per cent for fixed deposits between nine months one day and one year, 8.1 per cent for one year one day to two years, and 8.15 per cent for two years one day to three years. 

 Then came ICICI Bank with its 8 per cent interest offer on deposits for 390 days. However, the ICICI Bank offer comes with a rider that the minimum investment must be Rs 10,000. 

 ABN Amro already has a scheme offering 8 per cent interest rate on fixed deposits for 400 days. But the minimum investment eligible for this offer is quite high. Kotak Mahindra Bank followed it up with a promotional offer. The bank is offering a rate of 8 per cent on a 290-day deposit made on or before August 31. 

 Considering the quarterly compounding of interest on these deposits, the annual return works out to be 8.24 per cent. And, mind you, this is assured. These are, however, special deposits in the sense that banks are offering lower interest rates for fixed deposits having a higher or a lower tenor than these ? at least 175 basis points lower.

 These special deposits not only entail a higher interest rate, but also a renewable facility after maturity. However, the bank is at liberty to reset the interest rate after the term of the deposit.

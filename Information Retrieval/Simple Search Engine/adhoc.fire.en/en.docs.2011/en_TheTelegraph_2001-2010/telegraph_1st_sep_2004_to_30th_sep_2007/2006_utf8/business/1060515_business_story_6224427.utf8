The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 US wheat set to dock on Indian shore

Chicago, May 14 (Reuters): The US agriculture department is working quickly to pave the way for the sale of US wheat to India, but strict conditions have exporters wary of bidding on the $400-million-plus worth of business, officials and traders said this week.

 For the first time in six years, India is seeking to import duty-free wheat from a variety of countries after a shortfall in wheat production for the second straight year and spiralling domestic prices.

 US wheat export sales have been sluggish due to high prices and exporters are eagerly eyeing Indias tender for 3 million tonnes of optional-origin wheat.

 Bids are due Thursday and the wheat would be shipped starting in July, shortly after the start of the US wheat harvest. The business could be worth $400 million to $600 million, excluding shipping costs, US traders said.

 Its a big deal and you want to try to make it work, said a US wheat trader.

 USDA representatives visited India in early May to encourage officials to tender based on generally accepted terms in the international community, said USDA spokesman Ed Lloyd.

 Its something were very aggressively involved in, he said. What weve been trying to do is open more markets for US agricultural products and wheat in India is a very important market.

 Any offers to sell US wheat to India will likely include large risk premiums, traders said.

 Australia is having ongoing trouble with a sale of 500,000 tonnes of wheat to India.

 Several cargoes due to leave Australian ports were put on hold due to Indias concerns about quality. Earlier, Indian officials held up unloading the first shipments of Australian wheat over pesticide levels. Indian officials later determined that pesticide levels were within acceptable limits.

 Tender terms

 Traders are grappling with everything from the type of chemicals India requires for fumigation to shipping requirements that will likely drive up costs.

 India is requiring the wheat be fumigated with methyl bromide. The United States and many other countries use methyl phosphate.

 Methyl bromide is pretty much banned, said a US wheat trader. Its a hang-up.

 India is also requiring the wheat be shipped in cargoes of 30,000 to 50,000 tonnes, instead of the usual 50,000 to 80,000 tonnes.

 One of the other major issues is the requirement for zero tolerance on exotic weed seeds, said an employee with USDAs foreign agricultural services.

 India initially had zero tolerance for ergot and karnal bunt, two fungal diseases, but India will now accept wheat that is substantially free of those diseases, traders said.

 USDA has paved the way for wheat sales to several countries, most recently Mexico. The United States is the worlds largest exporter of wheat.

 USDA said on Friday that Mexico lifted a 10-year ban on wheat shipments from California due to karnal bunt, or TCK fungus. Mexico is the third-largest export market for US wheat.

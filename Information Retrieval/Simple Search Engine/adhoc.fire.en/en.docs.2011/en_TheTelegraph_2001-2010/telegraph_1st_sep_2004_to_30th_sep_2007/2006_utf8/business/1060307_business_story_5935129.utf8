 Taiwan keen to invest in India

 Taipei, March 6 (Bloomberg): The government of Taiwan will invite more than 100 local manufacturers to join a trade delegation to India in May in an effort to encourage investment in the Indian sub-continent and reduce the countrys emphasis on China.

 Taiwans economy has become increasingly reliant on China, the islands biggest export market. Taiwanese businesses and individuals have invested about $100 billion there.

 The aim of the India delegation is to help reduce the risk of focusing investment on one country, Taiwans ministry of economic affairs said in a statement.

 Taiwan President Chen Shui-Bian reminded the public of Chinas ambition to annex the island, and said in a speech on January 1 that his administrations new approach to future cross-strait economic and trade policies was active management, effective opening, rather than active opening, effective management practised since 2001.

 The government must proactively take on responsibility of management in order to effectively reduce the risks of liberalisation toward China, Chen said. We should not lock in our economic lifeline and all our bargaining chips in China, he added.

 The Taiwanese delegation is scheduled to visit India from May 7 to May 18 and the trip is aimed at helping Taiwanese manufacturers facilitate their global investment to upgrade competitiveness, a government statement said. The delegation will also visit Bangladesh.

 The ministry said it was also planning to hold an investment forum around March and April in Taipei to help Taiwanese manufacturers make the right investment decisions in India, focusing on industries such as information technology, communications, auto parts, food processing, textile, tourism and venture capital.

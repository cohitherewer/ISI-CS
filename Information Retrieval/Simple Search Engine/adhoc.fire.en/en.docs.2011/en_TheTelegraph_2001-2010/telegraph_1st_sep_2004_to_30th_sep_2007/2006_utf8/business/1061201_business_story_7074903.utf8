 Private cellular firms face cartel rap

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Call jam

 New Delhi, Nov. 30: The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) today accused private GSM operators of acting as a cartel against MTNL and BSNL and charging higher tariffs from customers for calls terminating in the networks of the two state-run companies.

 Trais contention came before the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) on the case of differential tariffs being charged by GSM operators for calls in four networks, which provide direct connectivity.

 The GSM operators are acting as a cartel against the state-owned MTNL and BSNL ... and are accusing BSNL of having a monopolistic attitude, the Trai counsel said.

 However, GSM operators, represented by the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), said, They do not have direct connectivity between their networks. Therefore, calls had to be routed like STD calls. This led to higher tariffs.

 If our calling charges are different from BSNL, in such a scenario, we should not be held responsible, said COAIs counsel during the proceedings before TDSAT.

 We have to pay more money for our call if it originates from our network and terminates in that of BSNLs or MTNLs, said COAI, adding that the nature of call becomes different if it terminates in BSNLs network.

 BSNL contract

 Delhi High Court has extended the stay on award of contract by BSNL for its GSM network till December 14. 

 A bench comprising acting Chief Justice M.K. Sharma and Justice Hima Kohli granted a weeks time to Motorola to file its reply on the response filed by BSNL.

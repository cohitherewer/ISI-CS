 All eyes on carry trades

 Skys the limit

 The crash in global markets in May was preceded by an unwinding of carry trades. Simply put, carry trades involve buying in currencies with low interest rates and investing in currencies and assets that offer higher yields. One such high-yielding currency is the Icelandic krona. These trades had supported the currencies of countries with large current account deficits such as Iceland, Hungary and Turkey.

 When worries about a spike in US interest rates (that would push up borrowing costs for traders) started raising their heads early this year, traders dumped their holdings of assets in these countries, sparking a crisis in their currencies. The Icelandic krona was the first of these to collapse, falling 7 per cent in two days in February. Bears had at the time warned that this was the first sign of the long-awaited unravelling of the carry trade. They were proved right in May. With the benefit of hindsight, analysts said at the time that the Icelandic krona was the proverbial canary in the coal mine, warning of dangers ahead. 

 This time too, the krona has been slipping since last Monday, when a rating agency confirmed its negative outlook for the currency. The krona slipped by 3.9 per cent against the dollar in two days. That has sparked off fresh concerns about a repeat unwinding of carry trades. But this time its different. The US Fed, for one, has stopped raising rates and the talk is now all about a rate cut. There has been no effect on other vulnerable currencies. As a matter of fact, all the indicators point to a slowdown of growth in the US, without affecting growth too much in the rest of the world. Forecasts about growth in Europe are actually higher, in spite of slowing US growth. Also, while the deceleration of the worlds largest economy will certainly have some impact, other regions will grow much faster than the US. 

 HSBC calculates, for example, that if the US economy slows to 1.9 per cent in 2007, growth in Asia will come down to 6 per cent in 2007. According to Goldman Sachs, Chinas economy would grow by 8 per cent in 2007 even if US economic growth dropped to zero in 2007. Higher consumer spending in China, India and Japan should help keep global growth rates up. 

 In such a scenario, funds should continue to flow into non-US assets, which is precisely what is happening. 

 Flows into global funds, Europe and emerging market funds continue to be strong, while there have been net outflows from US funds. So the worries about a sudden drying up of liquidity arent there now. Moreover, with US interest rates having topped out and other parts of the world powering ahead, the gap between US and European and Japanese or emerging market rates should narrow in future. That should lead to a decline in the dollar, which in turn should lead to more demand for non-dollar assets. That is why its unlikely that the fall in the krona this time is a leading indicator of trouble ahead for high-yield assets.

 More cash with funds

 There are several key takeaways from Merrill Lynchs survey of global fund managers for November. For the first time since 2004, more fund managers believe that equities are overvalued rather than undervalued. Thats a consequence of the resurgence of liquidity that has led to higher valuations and whetted the appetite for more risk-taking. The net balance of investors reporting higher-than-normal levels of risk has risen from minus 32 per cent in August to minus 14 per cent in November. The good news, from the point of view of liquidity support for the markets, is that average cash balances with funds have risen to 4.1 per cent from 3.8 per cent in October. Thats a sure sign that there will be buyers at every fall in the market.

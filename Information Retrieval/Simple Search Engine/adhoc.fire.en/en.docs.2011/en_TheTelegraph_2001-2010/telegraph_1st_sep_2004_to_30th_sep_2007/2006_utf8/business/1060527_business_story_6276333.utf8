 Tribunal raps VSNL, FLAG wins

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, May 26: Tatas-owned Videsh Sanchar Nigam Ltd (VSNL) suffered a setback today when an arbitration tribunal of the International Chamber of Commerce directed it to grant Reliance Infocomm-owned FLAG Telecom Group access to its landing station in Mumbai.

 VSNL had been blocking FLAGs access to the landing station, restricting Reliance networks ability to receive overseas calls routed through the FLAG network.

 The battle between VSNL and FLAG Telecom has been raging for a few years and has been cited as one of the reasons for the high international bandwidth prices in India.

 FLAG Telecom claims the ruling will enable it to reduce international bandwidth prices, which is crucial for BPO operations and other international telephony services.

 International bandwidth enables the carriage of data and voice services across countries. 

 Business process outsourcing and ITeS firms, small and medium enterprises and large companies are some of the major customers for international bandwidth.

 The price of international bandwidth depends on factors like number of competitors, demand and supply. There are six major cable systems that land in India today. 

 VSNL has often been accused of monopolising the international bandwidth when it is believed that less than 35 per cent of submarine design capacity passes through the landing station controlled by VSNL.

 Lit bandwidth capacity, which is the capacity available for sale, in the country is at least 500 Gbps. Only about 10 per cent of this capacity is currently utilised. 

 Last year, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) effected a 70 per cent reduction in international private leased line circuits (IPLC).

 In its notice to the Bombay Stock Exchange, VSNL said, The tribunal by majority decision has ordered the company to grant FLAG access to the Mumbai cable landing station of the FEA cable system for the purposes of installation, inspection, testing, training and other functions so as to equip capacity of the FEA cable system to any level.

 About two years back Reliance had alleged that VSNL was blocking access to FLAG Europe Asia (FEA) cable at the latters Mumbai landing station.

 In order to exercise its rights, FLAG has been forced to initiate arbitration proceedings under the provisions of the construction and maintenance agreement (C amp;MA), FLAG Telecom had said.

 The arbitration was to uphold FLAGs right to access the available capacity on FEA cable and carry out an upgrade on the cable at the Mumbai landing station, which is controlled by VSNL.

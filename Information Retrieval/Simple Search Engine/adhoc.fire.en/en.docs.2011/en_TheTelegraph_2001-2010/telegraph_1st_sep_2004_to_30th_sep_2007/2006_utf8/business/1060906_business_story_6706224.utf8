The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Oil cop is not amused

 S.P.S PANNU 

 New Delhi, Sept. 5: The directorate general of hydrocarbons (DGH), the regulator for the upstream oil and gas sector, is piqued by the claims of Cairn Energy that the company is sitting on oil reserves of 3.5 billion barrels in Rajasthan. 

 DGH V.K. Sibal told The Telegraph that what Cairn did was illegal as it failed to inform the DGH about the reserves prior to the public announcement. Sibal said Cairns was bound by its production sharing contract with the government to first inform the DGH about the reserves and then the public.

 He said Cairn has not submitted to him the assessment of the reserves made by independent valuer D amp;M, though it went public with the D amp;M estimate of 3.4 billion barrels in Rajasthan. DGH estimates the Cairn reserves in Rajasthan at 1.16 billion barrels.

 Cairn today in London revealed the estimates by Degloyer and McNaughton (D amp;M) and announced it would do the India IPO in December. The developments are unlikely to go down well with market regulator Sebi, which is opposed to oil companies jumping the gun in announcing the estimates of their gas or oil discoveries.

 While Cairn Energy has a 70 per cent stake in the Rajasthan fields, ONGC has a 30 per cent stake. ONGC wants its subsidiary, Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd, to pick up the crude. 

 The Rajasthan crude of Cairn has a high wax content and needs special pipelines with provisions for heating to transport the oil across 400 kms from Barmer district in Rajasthan to the Mundra port in Gujarat for shipment to Mangalore. 

 ONGC wants a discount on the crude to compensate it for the estimated Rs 2,000 crore required to construct the specialised pipeline to bring the crude till Mundra. 

 The crude reportedly has little or no LPG potential, while the naphtha yield has been pegged at less than two per cent. This reduces the incentive for ONGC to set up a refinery in Rajasthan. 

 Before ONGC, Indian Oil was asked to examine the possibility of setting up a refinery in Rajasthan; IOC too considered the venture unviable.

 ONGC also feels that a refinery is not feasible in Rajasthan to service the crude produced by Cairn. It decided against the refinery estimates peg the cost of the refinery at Rs 8,000 crore as the reserves were not sufficient to set up a refinery large enough to exploit the economies of scale. 

 Besides Cairn wants to exhaust 

 the reserves quickly; a large part of the crude would have 

 been disposed of before the refinery got commissioned. Cairn 

 estimates the peak production of 150,000 barrels to last 

 for four to five years.

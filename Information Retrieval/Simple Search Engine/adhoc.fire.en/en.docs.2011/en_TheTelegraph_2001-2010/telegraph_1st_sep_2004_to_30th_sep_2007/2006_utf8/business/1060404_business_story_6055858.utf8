 Group of six launches VNU bid

 Amsterdam, April 3 (Reuters): A group of six private equity firms has officially launched its 7.5-billion-euro ($9.1 billion) bid agreed last month for market research firm VNU NV. 

 The acceptance period for the offer lasts from April 4 to May 5, VNU said in a statement on Monday, although many analysts say the bid is too low and might fail. 

 The Valcon Acquisition BV consortium ? AlpInvest Partners, The Blackstone Group, The Carlyle Group, Hellman amp; Friedman, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts amp; Co and Thomas H. Lee Partners ? has bid 28.75 euros per share for the Netherlands-based company. VNU has recommended that shareholders accept the offer, but several large stakeholders, including Fidelity International, have said they would not accept any buyout offer at that price because it undervalues the company. VNU began talking with interested buyers after it failed to convince shareholders Fidelity, Templeton Global Advisors and Knight Vinke ? which together control 40 per cent ? of the merits of buying US healthcare data firm IMS Health last year. 

 The offer is conditional on 95 per cent approval and will be discussed on April 18 at the annual shareholders meeting. But Valcon can waive the 95 per cent clause if less than 60 per cent of shares are tendered and complete its purchase, according to the offer memorandum. 

 VNU said on March 8 it had considered selling the company in parts, which some investors still believe is the best option, but that it found no takers and that it would lose hundreds of millions of euros in tax benefits.

 VNU reiterated in a letter to its shareholders, included in the memorandum, that no buyers were interested in its media measurement and information unit or its marketing information division. 

 It said the price offered by the consortium was fair and cited two opinions written by VNUs financial advisers, investment banks Credit Suisse and Rothschild. 

 Credit Suisse values the firm at 29.60 euros per share on a stand-alone basis and between 25.90 and 29.35 euros in the case of a break-up. Rothschild sees a sum-of the-parts valuation in a range of 26 to 29.50 euros and a range of 29.90 to 35.80 euros per share if VNU stays independent and restructures its units.

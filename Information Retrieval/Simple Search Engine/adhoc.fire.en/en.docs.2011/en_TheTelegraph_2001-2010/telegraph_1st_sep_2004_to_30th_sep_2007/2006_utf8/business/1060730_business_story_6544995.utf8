 Allahabad Bank net declines

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 29: Allahabad Banks net profit for April-June quarter slid to Rs 128.25 crore from Rs 150.49 crore in the January-March period.

 Decline in earnings was more compared with the April-June quarter last year. 

 The bank had posted a net profit of Rs 162.98 crore in the first quarter of 2005-06 against Rs 128.25 crore in this financial year, recording a 21.31 per cent drop.

 The banks operating profit also suffered a setback following a steep decline in its other incomes, including profits on investments. It dropped to Rs 81.35 crore from Rs 172.35 crore in the previous quarter. 

 This was reflected sharply in the banks operating profit, which came down to Rs 207.43 crore from Rs 334.14 crore in the preceding quarter.

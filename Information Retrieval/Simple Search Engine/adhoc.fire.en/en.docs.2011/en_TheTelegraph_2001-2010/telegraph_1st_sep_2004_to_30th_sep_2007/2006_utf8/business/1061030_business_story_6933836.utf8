 Caveat on trade in tea futures

 Plucking time

 Calcutta, Oct. 29: The Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) is set to complete the feasibility study on the Rs 3,000-crore tea industry on its prospects in future trade in the next three to four months, which could pave the way for its trade on the bourses.

 MCX has prepared the report under an arrangement with the United Planters Association of South India (Upasi) and the exchange will discuss its recommendations both with the Upasi and the Tea Board.

 MCX managing director Jignesh Shah said the exchange always makes an assessment of a commodity before deciding to offer a platform to trade the commodity. The study is the standard procedure which we have followed for the 73 commodities listed on our exchange, Shah said. 

 Tea is a very complex industry which requires this kind of research after which we will be able to decide on a commonly accepted variety for trading, the rate of premium and discount and the high and low grade required to commence trading, he said. 

 While the Tea Board is optimistic of the potential of tea in the futures market, since there is an organised sport market for the transactions, the exchanges are wary of the absence of scientific procedures to test its quality. 

 The quality of tea is ascertained by tea tasters whose subjective judgements could prove to be a stumbling block as the exchanges prefer objective criteria for quality check. 

 The whole trade chain including tendering, delivery, storage and even spot market is not completely standardised. This coupled with a wide variety, differing tastes across individuals and regions require in-depth research, said Kailash Gupta, managing director and CEO, National Multi Commodity Exchange of India Limited.

 Gupta said this research requires huge investment, while it takes time to design a contract and a trading unit to be finalised. Besides, exchanges will also have to ensure that once listed the transaction takes place smoothly without creating any confusion or arising credibility problems.

 Upasi had earlier said that it will become a trading and a clearing member and the contract will be launched on a national commodity exchange platform. 

 Tea Board had earlier given a grant to Upasi to create a grade guarantee fund, while withholding a sanction of Rs 50 lakh for capacity building activities.

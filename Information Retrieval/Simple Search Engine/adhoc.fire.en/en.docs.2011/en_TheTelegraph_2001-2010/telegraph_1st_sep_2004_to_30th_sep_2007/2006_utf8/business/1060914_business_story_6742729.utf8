 Phillips Carbon Black in cash hunt

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Goenka: Money matters

 Calcutta, Sept. 13: Phillips Carbon Black Ltd (PCBL) is making a preferential equity issue to raise Rs 49.5 crore.

 The board of the RPG Enterprise group company today decided to place shares and warrants to the promoters Goenkas and to ICICI Bank along with a clutch of private equity investors.

 The money will be used to build a co-generation power plant at Durgapur at an investment of Rs 115 crore.

 Sanjiv Goenka, chairman of PCBL, said the captive power plant would help the company cut cost and boost its bottomline.

 The plant will have a 30-megwatt capacity and would be ready in 18 months.

 At present, the company is flaring up waste gas. After the plant is ready, it will be used as feedstock. 

 The operating cost of the plant would come down drastically. PCBL now pays Rs 3.5-4 crore every year as power bill.

 Of the Rs 49.5 crore being raised through the issue, Rs 40 crore will be invested in the project and the balance will be kept as working capital, Sudhir Sahgal, managing director of the company, said.

 It will also tie up loans worth Rs 75 crore for the power plant.

 PCBL has already set up a 12-megawatt co-generation facility at its Baroda unit.

 The shares and warrants will be issued at Rs 66 apiece. In case of warrants, the warrant holder would have the option to subscribe to one equity share per warrant within 18 months of the issue.

 The PCBL stock ended 4.99 per cent or Rs 3.75 up to close at Rs 78.90 on the Bombay Stock Exchange on Wednesday.

 A notice sent to the bourses by PCBL says promoters, promoters group, their friends and associates will be offered 30,00,000 warrants. 

 An entity called Land Lease Company India Ltd will be offered 10,00,000 warrants. 

 Moreover, ICICI Bank, along with Meenakshi Mercantile, Anjana Projects, Silvercross Marketing and Pathik Food Pvt Ltd, will be offered 35,00,000 shares on a preferential basis.

 Promoters hold a 54.46 per cent stake in the company. 

 PCBL has suffered a loss for the first time in its history of 45 years as its raw material prices, which is linked to global crude oil prices, soared. 

 The company could only partially pass on the increased cost to consumers.

 Goenka said he expected a better performance this fiscal.

 PCBL made a marginal profit in the first quarter and the second quarter is expected to be even better.

 Calcutta, Aug. 24: The State Bank of Hyderabad (SBH) may issue bonus shares to its principal bank, the State Bank of India, before it goes public. The bank is considering an initial public offering (IPO) by the third week of December.

 I am told that the State Bank of India (Subsidiary Banks) Amendment Bill 2006 will be passed by Parliament during the current session. If that happens, we will take another 10-12 weeks to carry out all due diligence and road shows for the IPO. I expect that by the third week of December, our IPO will hit the market, SBH managing director Amitabha Guha said here today. 

 The bonus issue may be in the ratio of 1:2 or 1:3, but we are yet to decide on that, he added. 

 The banks total business in the first quarter is Rs 57,300 crore and net profit is Rs 78 crore. We are targeting a total business of Rs 65,000 crore and a net profit of Rs 450 crore by March next year, Guha said.

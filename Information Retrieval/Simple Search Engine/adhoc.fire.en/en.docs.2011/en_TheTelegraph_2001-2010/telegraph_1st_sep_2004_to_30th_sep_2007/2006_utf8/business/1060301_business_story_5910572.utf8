The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 A benefit 

confined to the 

fringe

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 28: Amitabh Bachchan, Shahrukh Khan and Sachin Tendulkar can breathe easy: their endorsement contracts will keep rolling in.

 The government today decided not to levy the fringe benefit tax (FBT) on companies that fork out large sums to celebrity endorsers. 

 The fringe benefit tax was imposed on companies last year and sparked howls of protest. Corporate India wanted the tax to be abolished but Chidambaram stood firm. Let me remind everyone concerned once again that FBT is justified on the principles of horizontal equity and vertical equity.

 Chidambarams position left the industry clearly unhappy. We were expecting a lot more on FBT. Removal of FBT on brand endorsement will not make a major difference to us, said Girish Bapat, vice-president, marketing at LG Electronics India Ltd.

 LG India has just one brand ambassador ? rising star Abhishek Bachchan. Since the company has already roped in the junior Bachchan, the removal of FBT on brand endorsers will only be partial.

 Sam Balsara, CEO of Madisson, who manages the endorsements of Bollywood actor Akshay Kumar, also said the FBT relaxations would have a negligible impact.

 FBT is calculated on the number of transactions. In the case of celebrity endorsements, there are very few in a particular year. If one were to leave aside the commercials done by models and only consider Bollywood actors and cricketers, there would be about 20 to 30 transactions a year, said Balsara.

 In any given year, there would be seven to eight cricketers and a similar number of cinestars who would be signing up new brand endorsements. Nevertheless, it is a good token gesture on part of the finance minister for the advertising industry, whose size is only about Rs 1,200 crore, said Balsara.

 Chidambaram gave some relief on FBT to industry by lowering the taxable value of the benefit in the case of tour and travel to 5 per cent from 20 per cent. He also excluded the expenses on free samples of medicines and of medical equipment distributed to doctors.

 Chidambaram prescribed a threshold of Rs 1 lakh under section 115WB (1) (C) so that only contribution by an employer to an approved superannuation fund in excess of Rs 1 lakh a year per employee will attract FBT. Under section 80C, there is already an exemption of upto Rs 1 lakh for contribution by an employee to an approved superannuation fund.

 Serono focus on buyouts

 Sereno CEO Ernesto Bertarelli: On the prowl

 Zurich, April 10 (Reuters): Swiss biotech firm Serono SA has called off a five-month search for a suitor and launched a quest for acquisitions instead, the company announced on Monday, sending its share price plummeting.

 The Geneva-based firm said it would seek acquisitions or even a merger in order to boost growth rather than hold out for a buyer willing to pay enough to please the family that controls the firm, headed by chief executive Ernesto Bertarelli.

 It is safe to say the focus at this time is on acquisitions but we would not preclude a merger either, chief financial officer Stuart Grant said.

 Serono hired Goldman Sachs in November to help it explore its strategic options, sending its shares higher amid hopes that a larger pharmaceuticals firm could be tempted to bid.

 Shares in the firm slipped over 9 per cent in to 835 Swiss francs, shaving 1.2 billion francs from the market value of the firm to make it worth less than before Serono said it was up for sale.

 After a fruitless search in January for a buyer willing to pay up to $15 billion, Serono lowered its sights to between $11-$12 billion, but a second-round auction at the lower price also failed to attract a bidder.

 Novartis was seen as a frontrunner in the initial bidding round while UK firm GlaxoSmithKline had considered but was unlikely to make a cut-price bid for the company, sources familiar with the situation said last month.

 Last month Serono also announced surprise plans to raise around $5.6 billion through a share offering but analysts fear that the new acquisition strategy could prove dilutive.

 If it comes to one or more acquisitions of smaller firms it remains to be seen if they are worth their price and not diluting out the value of the shares to be issued, said Olav Zilian, an analyst at Helvea.

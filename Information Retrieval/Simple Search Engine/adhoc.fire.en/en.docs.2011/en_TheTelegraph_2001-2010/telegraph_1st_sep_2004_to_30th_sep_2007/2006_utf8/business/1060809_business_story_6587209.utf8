 Aviation cop back on govt radar

 New Delhi, Aug. 8: With a number of airports under private management, the government is again considering framing a draft legislation to set up an independent regulator.

 Senior officials said the concept had been nearly finalised earlier, but eventually put on hold some time back. However, with several airports, including Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad and Bangalore, under private management, many sections within the government favour setting up an independent regulator.

 Currently, director-general for civil aviation (DGCA) regulates the entire civil aviation sector. The Naresh Chandra committee had recommended setting up an economic regulator for the aviation sector, which would take over all of DGCAs activities and also function as a quasi-judicial body like the US Federal Aviation Administration.

 While the government is still toying with the idea, sources said it may eventually decide to set up an airport regulator instead. Officials said several ministries and the Planning Commission still supported the idea of a sector-wide economic regulator but others felt that such a regulator would only be a duplication of the DGCA.

 Instead, a new airport regulator could be set up immediately to resolve any dispute that may arise between airports or between new airports and the government. Sources said even this scaled-down version of an airport regulator was being opposed by a section of the government.

 Besides checking that price cartels or oligopolistic behaviour patterns do not emerge in fixing airport fees, the regulator would be expected to act as an arbitrator on disputes relating to abuse of monopoly, prescribe and enforce minimum standards for all agencies and ensure a level-playing field.

 It would also be expected to see that there is no discrimination between different airports in allotting capacity to foreign and Indian-run international airlines. 

 This has been a cause for much heartburn earlier with state governments often alleging step-motherly treatment by the Centre in prompting foreign airlines to fly to certain cities and not to others.

 Such a regulator would also need to work out a well-defined transparent mechanism for allocation of slots at airports to avoid disputes between airlines. Airlines often complain that rivals have been given time slots which they consider more favourable, ignoring their claims.

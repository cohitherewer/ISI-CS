 London model for Hind Lever operations

 Baillie: The unifier

 Mumbai, Aug. 2: Douglas Baillie has been in the job for just five months but hes already started pulling all the strings together as he tries to knit an overarching concept of One HLL (Hindustan Lever Ltd), which is modelled closely on its London-based parents One Unilever plan.

 Hindustan Levers new chief executive its first expatriate head honcho in over 40 years is cutting the companys ties with the past by shifting lock, stock and barrel to a new corporate headquarters in the suburbs of Mumbai that will house all the divisions of the company and its top honchos. 

 The shift has been speculated about for sometime but executives have always been coy about commenting on speculative talk. 

 On Wednesday, the company finally confirmed that it would relocate base and the move will begin by shifting the foods division from Bangalore to the Mumbai head office by January 1, 2007. 

 In the next phase, the Mumbai head office and training centre will move into the spanking new office in Andheri during 2008, company sources said. 

 The Andheri site measures 12.6 acres and the new campus will have a built-up area of over 5 lakh square feet. 

 The decision raised questions about the fate of the six-storey property that HLL owns at Backbay Reclamation in Mumbais tony business district. According to latest estimates, the current rate at the area is about Rs 20,000 to Rs 25,000 per square feet, which will value the approximately one-lakh-square-feet property at about Rs 200 to Rs 250 crore. 

 Executives refused to spell out whether the company intended to hawk the building in a booming real estate market. However, real estate sources say HLL has started inviting agents to tot up its valuation.

 Sources added that following the valuation process, the sale should ideally be conducted through an auction over the net, as is the normal practice these days. The company has already sold some of their office flats in South Mumbai, they said. 

 The sale, if it happens at all, is still two years away and much will depend on how smoothly the relocation takes place. HLL has 230 staff in Bangalore and 700 in Mumbai.

 Some hiccups are clearly expected and HLL seemed to acknowledge as much in a notice it sent to the BSE today.

 For those employees who choose not to relocate on account of any personal reasons, our commitment is to ensure their appropriate resettlement, the notice says.

 Mukesh: Pitching in 

 New Delhi, June 19: When Mukesh Ambani meets Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee at Writers? Buildings on Wednesday, the Reliance boss is expected to make a pitch for an equity stake in Haldia Petrochemcials, a company jointly owned by The Chatterjee Group and the Bengal government.

 During his visit, sources said, Mukesh would also try to win the Bengal government?s approval for a Rs 3,500-crore food-and-vegetable store chain.

 Sources said if Reliance manages to clinch the HPL deal, it may also consider investing in the chemical hub that is being planned around Haldia.

 Incidentally, Reliance?s interest in HPL coincides with Indian Oil?s declared interest in expanding its role in HPL. Indian Oil, which holds a 7.5 per cent stake in HPL, wants to progressively increase its stake and eventually take over the management of HPL. It has said if it were to expand the capacity of its Haldia refinery, as the state government wants it to, it needs to have a bigger role in HPL.

 HPL notched up a net profit of Rs 310 core on a gross turnover of Rs 6925 crore in the last financial year.

 Indian Oil is also prepared to become the ?anchor investor? in the Haldia chemical hub.

 By throwing its hat into the ring, Reliance will certainly cause some confusion in officialdom. The state government will begin to wonder which is the better suitor ? IOC or Reliance. Before any of this can happen, it has to sort out the dispute with Purnendu Chatterjee.

 The proposed Haldia chemical hub will be one of the three in the country. One such region will be in Gujarat where Reliance will be the biggest investor. It seems Mukesh Ambani wants to play a similar role in the eastern region too. 

 With the takeover of Indian Petrochemicals Corporation Ltd, Reliance Industries has built up a near-monopoly in the petrochemicals sector. Indian Oil was also keen on IPCL. But being a public sector company it was not allowed to bid.

 Having lost out to Reliance, Indian Oil initiated a move to get into petrochemicals to move up the value chain. Its investment in the Panipat refinery and the move to acquire Haldia Petrochemicals were part of this initiative. 

 Since Reliance is based in west, IOC has switched its focus to the north and eastern parts of the country. 

 Petroleum experts said Reliance?s current move appears to be aimed at pre-empting IOC from emerging as a major rival in the petrochemcials business.

 During his meeting with Bhattacharjee, the elder Ambani brother is also expected to explain in detail his plans to set up a model farm to store fruits and vegetables. 

 The Ambanis want around 500-1,000 acres spread over 10-15 locations that will act as rural hubs. Reliance will buy farm produce and sell farm inputs, set up vet centres and cold storages at these hubs, which will feed a chain of Reliance-owned fruit and vegetable stores modelled on UKs Tesco and US-based WholeFoods.

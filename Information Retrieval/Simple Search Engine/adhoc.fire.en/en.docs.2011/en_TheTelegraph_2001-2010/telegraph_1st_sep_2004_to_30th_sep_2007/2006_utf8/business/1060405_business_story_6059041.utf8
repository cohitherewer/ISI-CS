 Reliance Mutual grabs top slot

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, April 4: Reliance Mutual Fund has bagged the numero uno position among private mutual funds with assets under management rising to Rs 24,669 crore in March. 

 It has jumped three positions in one go, overtaking Prudential ICICI, HDFC and Franklin Templeton which have assets of Rs 23,502 crore, Rs 21,549 crore and Rs 18,826 crore respectively. 

 The last one year saw the fund house grow by over 100 per cent from Rs 9,542 crore in March 2005. It has added Rs 7,810 crore to its kitty last month.

 The hefty jump has been brought about by the recently concluded new fund offer of Reliance Equity Fund, which collected Rs 5,759 crore from over 9.29 lakh applications across the country. 

 Reliance Mutual Fund has seen a significant jump in its equity portfolio, at over Rs 15,010 crore. It had recently declared 75 per cent dividend under Reliance Vision and Reliance Growth funds, the two top performing funds from its stable. The fund house had also declared a 50 per cent dividend for its Reliance Banking fund.

 Total assets under management (AUM) for the mutual fund industry has grown by almost 7 per cent in the last one month. In terms of AUM, private mutual funds have been witnessing a lot of churn in rankings over the last couple of years.

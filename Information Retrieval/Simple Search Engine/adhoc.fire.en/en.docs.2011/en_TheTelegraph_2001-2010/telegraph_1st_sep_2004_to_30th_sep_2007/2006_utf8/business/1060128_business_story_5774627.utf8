The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Local titans tight-lipped

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 27: Indias steelmakers are wary of the 100-million-tonne-a-year behemoth that Lakshmi Niwas Mittal is out to create with his $23-billion unsolicited bid for Luxembourg-based Arcelor, but dont want to speculate just yet about its fallout on the countrys steel scenario. 

 SAIL, the state-owned steelmaker, declined to comment about the development. Its chairman might make a statement in a day or two once a clear picture emerges.

 Tata Steel, the worlds cheapest steelmaker and second largest steelworks in India, also refused to comment.

 The company has a technical arrangement with Arcelor for making automotive steel.

 When asked if its association with Arcelor would continue after this development, Tata Steel officials said it was too premature to comment on this.

 In 2002, Nippon Steel and Arcelor had entered into a tieup with Tata Steel for providing effective steel solutions to the Indian automotive industry.

 In 2003, Arcelor granted Tata Steel a technology licence for hot dip galvanized (HDG) products for the automotive industry. The agreement covers both pure zinc HDG and galvannealed products. 

 The technology agreement may now come under cloud since Mittal Steel and Tata Steel do not have the best of relations. Mittals decision to set up a 12-million-tonne steel plant has queered the pitch for domestic players.

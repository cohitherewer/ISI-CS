 Satyam gets a slice of GM deal

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Feb. 3: Satyam Computer Services Ltd has bagged a $150-million deal from CapGemini and HP. These are two of the six software companies, including Wipro, to win the $15-billion contract from General Motors (GM) yesterday.

 Satyam will team up with CapGemini and HP for the GM contract, said an official from the Hyderabad-based firm.

 The contract, spread over five years, will include maintenance and support work for GM. GM is a strategic global account for Satyam for the last four to five years in product development, sales, marketing and supply chain, said Subu D. Subramanian, director and senior vice-president of Satyams manufacturing and automotive businesses.

 Subu, however, did not reveal the revenue that Satyam gets from GM at present. Satyam hopes to get a sustained cash flow for the next five years along with an opportunity to generate additional revenues. 

 Most of the work will be done from Satyams centre in Chennai. We are already adding capacity to our centre and we expect to ramp up fast. We will also do some work at our newly-opened centre for excellence in Detroit, but a majority of the work will be done from Chennai, Subu added. The revenues from the deal will reflect on Satyams balance sheet from the first quarter of 2006-07. 

 The company has, however, not revealed any details on the capacity addition or the break-up of the revenue in the next five years.

 The domestic IT industry has recently seen a spate of big deals, starting with that clinched by HCL Tech. The deal size was $335 million. Other prominent deals include those between TCS and ABN Amro ($240 million), Infosys and ABN Amro ($140 million) and Patni and GE ($100 million). Analysts feel that the IT industry will see more of such deals where although the bigger chunk will go to Tier I firms like Infosys, TCS or Wipro, a part of the work will get outsourced to mid-cap and small IT firms.

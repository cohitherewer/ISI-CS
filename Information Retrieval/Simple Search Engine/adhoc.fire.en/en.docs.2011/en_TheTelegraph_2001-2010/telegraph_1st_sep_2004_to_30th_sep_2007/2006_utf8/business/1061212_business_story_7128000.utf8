 New Delhi, Dec. 11: LG Electronics India (LGEIL) will start assembling flat panel display televisions from next year and will invest $100 million in its Pune facility over the next five years.

 By the first half of 2007, we will assemble flat panel display (FPD) televisions in our facility at Ranjangaon in Pune. However, the level of localisation will initially not be more than 20 per cent, said Moon Bum Shin, deputy managing director of LGEIL.

 The company now imports the entire range of LCD and plasma televisions from its Korean facility.

 Anticipating a huge growth in the FPD segment, LGEIL expects to clock Rs 1,140 crore of the Rs 9,000-crore turnover targeted in 2007. The company expects to corner Rs 150 crore this year with a sales turnover of Rs 7,500 crore.

 The current market size of FPDs is estimated to be around 1.3 lakh units. Of this, LG claims to have a 40 per cent market share in plasma TVs and 25 per cent in LCDs.

 The market for FPDs is likely to touch 5 lakh units in 2007. LG expects to sell approximately 2.7 lakh flat panels next year, said Prashant K. Das, national product group head, FPD-retail, LGEIL.

 On manufacturing of FPDs, Shin said, We would like to do that but volumes dont support.

 Though consumer electronic companies are suffering overall losses in FPD sales, they have been slashing prices over the last six months because of price wars in the industry.

 The attempt is to popularise the product among masses. Yes, we have suffered losses between 5 and 7 per cent in this product segment but we try and even out sales in other product categories. This is a company strategy, said Das.

 According to industry estimates, while prices of plasma TVs have dropped by 20 per cent, that of LCDs have come down by 25 per cent. In the next three months, we expect prices of both these categories to come down again by 10-15 per cent, said Das.

 Meanwhile, the company today launched a flat panel television with a built-in-recorder, called the Time Machine TV. It is priced between Rs 1.15 lakh for a 37-inch LCD TV and Rs 2.4 lakh for a 50-inch plasma.

 The television allows the user to record a programme while watching another live show.

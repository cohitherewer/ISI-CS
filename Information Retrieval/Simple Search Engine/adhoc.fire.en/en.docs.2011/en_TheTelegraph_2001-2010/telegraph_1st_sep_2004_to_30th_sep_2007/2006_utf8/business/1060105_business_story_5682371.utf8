 Airport bid report soon 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 4: The Shreedharan committee, set up by the central government to look into the controversial bidding process for Delhi and Mumbai airports, will submit its report by January 10.

 Even as the committee tries to sift through the papers related to the bidding process, several questions are being raised by the ministries and departments concerned over the parameters used for the evaluation of bids and even the drafting of the bid documents. 

 Top civil aviation ministry officials pointed out that the criteria for selection spelt out by the earlier high-level government review committee (GRC) was inherently subjective and there could be variations in findings. The GRC recorded in its findings that the inter-se marking across various bidders for the same criteria based on experience, expertise and commitments could be different. 

 In fact, the committee noted that the report markings and its conclusion were based on a subjective analysis of the bid documents by the evaluation team and a review of the same by another team might yield different results. The evaluation by the merchant banker and the technical consultant had awarded highest marks to Reliance-ASA Mexico and GMR-Fraport. 

 The GRC also pointed out that no independent search of any kind has been undertaken or conducted to check whether the documents or information given by the various bidders were authentic, reliable or even true. 

 Neither ABN Amro nor Airplan Australia tried to check the authenticity of the documents submitted. 

 It is learnt that the group of ministers (GoM), which finally decided to order a revaluation after protests by the Left alleging lack of transparency, has also suggested that the technical parameters for the bidding process could be simplified. 

 The GoM is of the opinion that such a move will make the process less expensive and more transparent. It also feels the cost-plus tariff structure for the successful airport bidder should be replaced by user charges set beforehand as this would make the airports more affordable.

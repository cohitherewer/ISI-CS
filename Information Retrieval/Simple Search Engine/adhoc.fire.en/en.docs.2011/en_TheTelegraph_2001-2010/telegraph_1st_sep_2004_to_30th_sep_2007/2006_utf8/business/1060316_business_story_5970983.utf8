 New Delhi, March 15: If you thought, its only the cellular phone industry that is promising big-time growth, think again. The camcorder market is also expected to take a giant leap this year. 

 While the overall size of the Indian market for camcorders is likely to grow 30-40 per cent this year, the digital camcorder market may grow even faster and overtake the analogue market.

 A camcorder is a portable television camera and videocassette recorder. The size of the camcorder market in India, which was 190000 units according to last years figures, is estimated to sell more than 270000 units during 2006.

 According to industry estimates, the digital camcorder segment, which constituted about 55 per cent of the total official camcorder market last year, is likely to grow 65 per cent this year. 

 Industry experts feel that increasing availability of digital cameras in the official photographic and consumer electronics channel, reduction in the price gap between digital and analogue camcorders and the growing need as well as consumer acceptance of digital products have contributed to the rapid growth of the digital camcorder market. 

 Many companies are launching their range of digital camcorders. 

 Samsung, which offers a range of 10 digital camcorders, plans to launch six models in 2006 starting from April. We plan to introduce this line-up in order to strengthen our current range. DVD camcorders would be a part of that launch, said R. Zutshi, Samsung Indias deputy managing director.

 Screen size of 2.7 inches wide, high optical zoom, 16:9 aspect ratio LCD screen, higher resolution are contributing to the popularity of digital camcorders, Zutshi said. 

 The companys digital camcorders are priced between Rs 21,990 and Rs 49,000. 

 The market trends indicate growing acceptance of alternative high-end technology that delivers both performance and price advantage, said George Van Der Merwe, chief operating officer, Sahara Computers and Electronics Ltd. 

 Sahara Computers also added two new models of digital camera with 8.0 and 6.0 mega pixels in its range of lifestyle products. 

 In 2004, the size of the digital segment was a mere 30 per cent of the total official camcorder market. 

 The growth of the official market in India is keeping pace with the growth of the digital market. 

 The official market is expected to virtually double from 95000 units last year to around 177000 this year.

 BoB takes lead in rate hike

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, July 31: Bank of Baroda (BoB) has raised the benchmark prime lending rate (BPLR) by 50 basis points to 11.5 per cent with effect from August 1. As a result, interest rates on housing loans will rise, while deposits will yield better returns. 

 BoB?s hike comes on a day when state-run Punjab National Bank indicated that it could raise lending rates across the board within a day or two. ?There will be a hike in lending rates,? PNB chairman S.C. Gupta said while announcing the bank?s first quarter results in the capital. Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) is also considering a rate hike. 

 With the cost of funds rising after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) raised short term rates in its quarterly review of the monetary policy last week, the bank has to revise the lending rates, including for home, personal and other retail loans, the PNB chief said. ?We have taken a view on (raising) interest rates, which we will announce in the next couple of days,? he said. 

 BoB and PNB will be the first banks to raise rates after the central bank increased the reverse repo and repo rate by 25 basis points in its credit policy last week. 

 BoB has informed the exchanges that while the BPLR will stand revised to 11.5 per cent, it will also revise upwards the deposit rates across various maturities. Though officials from the bank were not available for comments, sources said the hike could be 25-50 basis points in both housing loans and deposits. Sub-PLR loans made to the corporate houses are also expected to become dearer. BoB currently offers an interest rate of 3.50 per cent on deposits having a maturity of 2-14 days and it stands at 7 per cent for deposits having a tenure of 5 years to 10 years. 

 In April, BoB became the first nationalised bank to raise rates when it increased the BPLR by half a per cent to 11 per cent. Deposit rates were raised by the same margin. 

 BoB made its floating home loan rates dearer by 50 basis points. This came after the central bank raised the provisioning on residential housing loans beyond Rs 20 lakh to 1.0 per cent from 0.40 per cent. 

 However, senior officials of the bank had then explained that the rate hike was done to be on a par with its counterparts in the private sector.

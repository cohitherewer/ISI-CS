 Revenue before tax sops

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

New Delhi, Dec. 19: The government, in its mid-year review of the economy, has proposed the weeding out of exemptions and concessions in taxes to boost revenues.

 Stoking a debate with Budget 2007 less than three months away, the review, released today, said exemptions and incentives in the tax structure distorted resource allocation and hindered productivity.

 They (exemptions and concessions) also result in a multiplicity of tax rates, legal complexities, classification disputes, litigation, higher cost of tax compliance and administration, the review said.

 According to the review, such exemptions were justified on the grounds of promoting balanced growth, dispersing industries across many regions, neutralising the disadvantages of a small firm vis--vis a bigger rivals and promoting priority sectors.

 The review suggested a sunset clause in the exemptions would thwart pressure groups that emerge to lobby for the continuity of such reliefs.

 It advised the government not to veer away from fiscal consolidation and fiscal reforms and warned against fiscal profligacy in the rush to enhance public investment.

 It said that despite slippages at the half-way mark, the government was confident of meeting the performance benchmarks of the fiscal responsibility and budget management (FRBM) act for the full fiscal through expenditure management and meeting the tax targets of the last budget.

 The report suggested by meeting the fiscal deficit target for the year and budgeting for a target of 3.4 per cent of the GDP for 2007-08, India would send a strong signal on its commitment to the FRBM targets.

 Asking the states to share the burden of development with the Centre, the report opposed grants and subsidies to schemes that are in the state list and said states should take responsibility of schemes by making a financial contribution and assuming ownership of programmes.

 A greater state role in development has become more urgent as the recommendations of the 12th Finance Commission and VAT have considerably improved state finances.

 The report says the Achilles heel of the economy is infrastructure which requires investments of as much as Rs 14,50,000 crore ($320 billion) in the Eleventh Plan.

 The report said it was not possible for the Centre to raise this sum for infrastructure and urged the involvement of private sector on its own or through the principal of public-private partnership.

 The pricing principle must be one of user must pay which has been successful in telecom.

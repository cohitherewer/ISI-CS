 Calcutta, Nov. 16: Coal India Limited (CIL) plans to invest Rs 15,600 crore in the 11th Five-Year Plan to raise output by 170 million tonnes (mt) to 520 mt at the end of the plan period from 363 mt projected for this fiscal.

 The investment target is based on projected demand of the power sector, which consumes three-fourth of the coal produced by CIL. The PSU also factored in reduced yields from its existing mines in its plans.

 The projected increase in output of 170 mt is ambitious, since the PSU raised output by 84 mt over the whole of the 10th plan (2002-06).

 CIL chairman Partha S. Bhattacharyya said the PSU will outsource a part of the mining work to the private sector.

 We would have to invest Rs 20,000 crore at todays price to reach the target. Since we will outsource a part of it, the investment will be less, Bhattacharyya said.

 Having regained financial fitness, CIL will generate the proceeds for investment internally. The PSU recorded a profit after tax of Rs 5,200 crore in the last fiscal.

 In addition to the power sector, CIL will sell coal to other segments through e-auctions.

 After selling 20 mt in the last fiscal, CIL has fixed a target of 36 mt sales this fiscal through e-auctions. The public sector coal major plans to take this up to 72 mt, or 20 per cent of its production, in the next few years.

 Though online prices are higher than sales through other channels, the prices will fall when volumes pick up, Bhattacharyya said at a meeting organised by the Merchants Chamber of Commerce (MCC) here today.

 To improve quality, CIL has plans for many big and small washeries with the participation of the private sector. 

 The company is also scouting for coking coal reserves overseas.

 The PSU will tie up with the Steel Authority India Ltd (SAIL) and Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Ltd (RINL) in this regard.

 There are opportunities in the US, Canada and South Africa, Bhattacharyya said.

 A special purpose vehicle may be set up to carry out such acquisitions, he added.

 Q amp;A

 Home alone

 Our family consists of six sisters, two brothers and our parents. I am a widow and a working woman. My father has given his entire property, including the house, to his two sons through a registered will. Can I claim a portion in the same property?

 Sujata Das, Calcutta

 ce your father has given his property to his sons through a registered will, you cannot do anything about it. However, since he is alive you can request him to make necessary changes in the will so that you can also be a beneficiary.

 Land for sale

 I am 62 years old and a widow. I get a pension of about Rs 70,000 a year. I have a piece of land which I want to sell. Please tell me the tax implications of such a sale.

 J. Mandole, Calcutta

 If you are holding the piece of land for more than three years, its sale will attract long-term capital gains tax at the rate of 20 per cent without cost inflation indexation or 10 per cent with cost inflation indexation. The indices for various years are regularly published by the income-tax department. However, you can claim tax relief under section 24F by investing the net proceeds in a new house within six months of the transfer of the asset or in capital gains bonds of the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) and Rural Electrification Corporation Ltd (RECL) or in a capital gains account with public sector banks. 

 Twin posers

 Is the interest income from IDBI infrastructure bonds exempted from calculation of annual income for tax purposes? I had purchased Bima Nivesh 2001 with a single premium. The policy will mature this year. Is the maturity value exempted from tax?

 M. L. Dutta, Calcutta

 IDBI bonds are not listed in the official gazette for income-tax exemption under section 10(15). Hence, the interest income from these bonds must be taken into account for arriving at the gross annual income. The maturity value of a life insurance policy is tax-free. However, a premature surrender of the policy will attract income tax.

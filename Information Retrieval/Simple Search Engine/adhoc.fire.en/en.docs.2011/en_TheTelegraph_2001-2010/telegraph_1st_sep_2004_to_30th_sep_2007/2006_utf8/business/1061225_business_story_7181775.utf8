 FMCG firms to take giant rural strides

 New Delhi, Dec. 24: The fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) sector is likely to grow from Rs 70,000 crore to Rs 1,23,363 crore by 2012, as it penetrates the semi-urban and rural markets.

 As much as 60 per cent of the growth will be fuelled by demand from semi-urban and rural India, according to a study conducted by industry chamber Assocham.

 However, the study also points out that low disposable incomes, large number of daily wage earners, acute dependence on the vagaries of the monsoon, seasonal consumption linked with harvests and festivals, poor roads and power crisis are some of the challenges the manufacturers have to tackle.

 It also reveals that the urban population the major consumers of FMCG products will undergo a transformation in their consumption behaviour over the next four to five years.

 The consumption pattern will largely shift to organic products to maintain good health, the study says.

 Rural markets are increasingly accepting products such as toothpaste, skin and hair wash, talcum powder, branded atta, instant coffee, ketchup, deodorants and jams.

 The per capita income of the rural and semi-urban populace will increase as economic activities grow in this region due to rapid industrialisation, said the study.

 However, the study said cut-throat competition in these two sectors will severely pressurise the margins of big brands such as Nirma, Hindustan Lever, Dabur, ITC, Godrej, Britannia, Coca-Cola and Pepsi.

 According to industry estimates, while per capita income of the semi-urban people is around Rs 14-15,000 per annum, it is almost half for people living in rural regions.

 However, both segments are expected to see a tremendous increase in their income levels by 2012. While incomes in the semi-urban region are expected to double during the period, the rural sector will also witness reasonable hike. 

 Approximately 70 per cent of the households in India are in the rural regions. The number is expected to rise from 135 million in 2001-02 to 153 million in 2009-10. This presents the largest potential market in the world, says the study.

 Bangalore, March 20: Michael S. Dell, founder and chairman of Dell Inc, today said his company would double its headcount to 20,000 in India over the next three years. The world?s largest PC maker is aiming at maintaining a 40 per cent rate of growth here. 

 The company also plans to double the size of its India-based product development team from 300 to 600 within the next one year, Dell said.

 The R amp;D team develops solutions for servers and storage equipment. ?We found that the R amp;D team was designing stuff, which could be patented. So we decided to extend its scope from software to hardware,? Dell told reporters. Last year alone, the centre had filed for 145 patents, he added. 

 Dell has four contact centres in India and is in the process of building its own campus at various locations in a bid to expand operations. 

 India produced 2,00,000 engineering graduates in 2005. ?We see this as a fantastic opportunity for us to attract some of the best and bright engineers for our software and hardware activities,? Dell said.

 In India, the company will continue to invest in R amp;D, focus on hiring engineering talent to support its global operations and expand customer contact centres and sales and support staff.

 Currently, the $56-billion Dell employs 9,000 people at its customer contact centres in Bangalore, Hyderabad and Chandigarh, which are part of the 30-site global customer contact network of the corporation. A new contact centre is coming up at Gurgaon in Haryana with nearly 1,000 seats by this year-end. 

 The company also plans to set up a manufacturing plant for PCs in India and is negotiating incentives and infrastructure guarantees for the same with various state governments. 

 The proposed unit, where it would initially start assembly operation, would first seek to ?satisfy local demand and then look to exports,? he added.

 In India, Dell?s PC and server sales are concentrated in the enterprise segment. In the server space, Dell ranks third in the sub-continent with a 14 per cent market share. 

 ?Except in the US, only 15 per cent of our revenues come from consumers,? said Dell. ?Our focus will continue to be on the enterprise segment in India.? 

 The focus might change once the manufacturing facility is built, he added. It will enable Dell to cater to customers at all price points and not just those wanting bare-bone computers. With PC sales spurting from 3 million to 5 million units last year, Dell has set a target to increase its market share in India to 10 per cent from 4.5 per cent. The company has a share of 10 per cent in Asia and 18 per cent worldwide, he said.

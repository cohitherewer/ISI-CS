 Capital control recast gains pace in China

 Windfall

 Shanghai, April 14 (Reuters): China relaxed its capital controls on Friday to make it much easier for individuals and companies to buy foreign currencies and invest abroad. 

 The move will permit President Hu Jintao to tell President George Bush when they meet next Thursday that China has made another notable move toward a market-driven exchange rate.

 The deregulation is a concrete step fulfiling the central banks commitment to gradually ease Chinas capital controls, said Li Yang, an economics professor who is a former member of the central banks monetary policy committee.

 Under rules announced by the central bank and the foreign exchange regulator, Chinese banks will be allowed to pool yuan deposits and convert them into foreign currencies for investment in overseas bonds.

 Fund management firms may invest individuals and companies existing foreign exchange holdings in overseas bonds or shares, while insurers will be permitted to invest in foreign fixed-income assets and money market paper.

 Individuals will be allowed to buy $20,000 a year, up from $8,000, and firms will be allowed to hold more foreign exchange.

 By creating demand for dollars, the steps should ease pressure for a further rise in the yuan generated by Chinas record trade surplus and investment inflows.

 Beijing said on Friday that its forex reserves, which had already overtaken Japans in February to become the worlds largest, grew to $875.1 billion at the end of March, fuelled by foreign direct investment in the first three months of $14.25 billion and a first-quarter trade surplus of $23 billion.

 An outflow of foreign currencies can ease pressure for further yuan appreciation. This offers a good argument before President Hus US visit to show the Americans Chinas commitment to further currency reform and ease the US clamour for a firmer yuan, said economist Yi Xianrong. Like Li Yang, Yi works at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. 

 In practice, though, economists say the initial impact will be muted because of a widespread view that the yuan, which has risen just 1.16 per cent since it was revalued and unhooked from a decade-old dollar peg in July, is a one-way bet to rise further.

 Capital flight will occur if there are expectations of yuan depreciation, as people will seek to send money overseas. But in the short term, the latest measures will not have a significant effect given expectations of a yuan appreciation, said Gao Shanwen, an economist at China Everbright Securities in Shanghai.

 Whats more, the authorities have not said how much money they will allow to be invested overseas.

 Still, analysts said China had taken a step toward making the yuan convertible for purely financial purposes instead of just for trade and direct investment deals, as is the case now.

 It follows a series of other moves to build a two-way market for foreign exchange. These include the introduction of a system of market-makers, who constantly stand ready to buy or sell the yuan, and the development of derivatives so banks and firms can hedge new-found currency risk.

 Just as central bank officials have been saying, what really counts is reform of the foreign exchange formation mechanism rather than the level of the exchange rate. This move is a vital part of that reform, said economist Yi.

 Underscoring the reform drive, China said on Friday it would launch interbank trading in currency swaps on April 24. Depending on the pace of liberalisation, the easier foreign exchange rules provide a juicy business opportunity for Chinese banks and money managers.

 Youre giving banks a huge opportunity. They already have a huge depositor base, so marketing is going to be very easy, said economist Stephen Green with Standard Chartered Bank in Shanghai.

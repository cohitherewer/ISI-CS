 CII sees 8% growth

 New Delhi, Feb. 26 (PTI): The Confederation of Indian Industry sees the economy growing at over 8 per cent this fiscal in line with quick estimates by the Central Statistical Organisation due to a good monsoon and impressive growth in the services sector.

 However, fiscal and revenue deficit targets are likely to be missed, the chamber said in its latest state of the economy report. Both exports and imports have registered a decline in the first three quarters of the current fiscal. The report said the major challenge lay in increasing the export growth as bringing down the imports growth may not be advisable in view of the capital-intensive nature of imports and high oil prices.

 The chamber also said the fear of rupee getting weak does not hold water at the moment since the real effective exchange rate assumed a rising trend during the first nine months of this fiscal.

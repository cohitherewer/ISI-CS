 Insurance regulator wants tougher rules

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Rao: Looking ahead

 New Delhi, Feb. 6: The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) has proposed major amendments in the Insurance Act, 1938 including setting up of an appellate authority to settle disputes and strict punitive measures for breach of contract by insurers.

 IRDA has proposed the amendments based on the recommendations made by the Law Commission and K. P. Narasimhan Committee for updating insurance laws. 

 IRDA chairman, C. S. Rao said the two committees had many points of consensus and some differences in opinion. Based on the feedback of two panels, the regulator will finalise the amendments required in the Insurance Act by the end of this month.

 According to Rao, the Law Commission has proposed to set up a grievance redressal authority and an insurance appellate authority, while the Narasimhan panel has favoured continuing with the existing system of ombudsman and making use of the securities appellate tribunal.

 It is agreed that we should have a revision of the Insurance Act, 1938. We will submit our report to the government by this month end, Rao said here in a seminar organised by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci).

 Todays interaction with the stakeholders of the insurance industry would be the last official opportunity for the insurers to express their views and concerns about the road ahead, he added.

 K. N. Chaturvedi, member-secretary, Law Commission of India, said the law of insurance is a technical area of private law in which areas for review include issues such as non-disclosure, breach of warranty, doctrine of insurable interest, definition of insurance, agency and insurance.

 The regulator is likely to suggest modifications in the Insurance Act to stipulate hefty penalties for insurers in case of breach of contract. Sections 45 and 38 of the Insurance Act deals with the penalty provisions.

 Motor insurance

 Insurers will be free to peg their motor insurance premium and run their business profitably from January next year, according to the IRDA chairman. Rao said, Motor insurance will be detariffed from January 2007 and insurers are commissioning under-writers.

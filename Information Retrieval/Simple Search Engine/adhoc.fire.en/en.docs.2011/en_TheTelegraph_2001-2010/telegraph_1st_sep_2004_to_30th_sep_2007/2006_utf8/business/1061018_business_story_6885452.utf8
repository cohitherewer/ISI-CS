 Calcutta, Oct. 17: Nortel has lined up a mix of voice and data solutions for small and medium businesses (SMB). In the next three years, the company expects to garner 25-30 per cent of the SMB market and feels the segment will contribute 25 per cent to the companys overall turnover.

 The company has priced its offerings from Rs 20,000 onwards and plans to increase the number of channel partners in the eastern region from 50 to 250 by March 2007.

 This is the first time that Nortel is entering the SMB segment through simple, scalable and easy-to-use products. The existing market in India is fragmented and offers either voice or data solutions while we offer a combination of both. Through our cluster approach, we expect to garner a sizeable market share in the years to come, said E.R. Ashok Kumar, director-SMB, Nortel India.

 The solutions could cater to businesses with even three to five employees.

 The company has divided the business into 32 clusters and each region comprises eight clusters.

 Clusters include regions and industries in the SMB segment which are specific to that particular region. In the east, it includes Howrah, Calcutta, Jamshedpur and Guwahati.

 The company expects the eastern region to contribute a significant portion of SMB revenues as there are a number of units in leather, electric appliances, hosiery and power equipment and transformers in Calcutta and steel rolling mills, battery and lock manufacturers, foundry and imitation jewellery makers in Howrah.

 There is also a round-the-clock call centre for SMBs to address queries and problems in pre-and post-sales support in Chennai.

 Nortel has a dedicated team to look after each region and will deploy 12 service engineers in the city to cater to the SMB requirements.

 Freight corridor key to Calcutta port

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Troubled waters

 Calcutta, March 5: Calcutta port may lose a significant volume of container cargo in the near future if the proposed freight corridor is not extended up to Bengal.

 In the absence of world class infrastructure, the twin ports at Calcutta and Haldia will be in a disadvantageous position vis-?-vis Jawaharlal Nehru Port, even though it is on the west coast.

 The development comes at a time when Calcutta port is desperately trying to woo the north Indian cargo heading for ASEAN countries, the reason being that the city port will lose one-fourth of its cargo in one go from the next fiscal.

 Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) will commission a pipeline to carry oil cargo from Paradip to Haldia and thereby knocking off 12-million tonne parcel from 52 mt Calcutta port will carry this year.

 Calcutta Port Trust officials fear that their efforts to win traffic to Calcutta and Haldia ports, which are geographically much closer to far eastern and ASEAN countries, could be severely undermined now and in future.

 Absence of a freight corridor could be even bigger than the oil shock in terms of future potential, a senior port official pointed out.

 JNPT still gets larger chunk of cargo from north India because of superior connectivity.

 However, Container Corporation of India (Concor) has set up a container terminal at Calcutta port and it plans to run fixed scheduled service between the city and Tughlaqabad in north India soon. 

 This twin development is expected to boost the container movement through this port. But once the freight corridor ? promises to be a dedicated multi-modal high-axle load facility with computerised control ? is developed, Calcutta will not be able to compete with JNPT.

 Calcutta ports share in cargo handling would be limited further if feeder lines are connected to any other eastern ports in Orissa.

 The concept of hinterland is fast becoming obsolete. Now, the cost of business determines everything. So, Calcutta can aspire to take cargo from the northern region provided the deal is cheaper to the client. The port can do its bit but the support infrastructure has to be matching, the official explained. This year the port is hoping to carry 5 mt of container cargo, up by 10 per cent over last year. It has been rising steadily. 

 Container is seen as the future of ocean trade and every port today is eager to attract container cargo.

 The proposed freight corridor on the western and eastern routes will be developed at a cost of Rs 22,000 crore. In the first phase of the eastern corridor project, a separate freight corridor will be built from Ludhiana to Sonnagar via Ambala, Saharanpur, Khurja and Allahabad. 

 The primary feeder routes from Sonnagar to Durgapur via Gomoh, Sonnagar to Tatanagar via Garhwa Road and Barkakana to Bokaro via Chandrapura will be upgraded in order to carry heavier trains of coal and steel traffic. 

 The western corridor will start from JNPT and will be routed via Vadodara, Ahmedabad, Palanpur, Jaipur and Rewari to Tuglakabad and Dadri. Both the corridors will be connected by a link between Dadri and Khurja. The feeder routes of the western corridor connecting ports of Gujarat will also be upgraded.

 Small units in awe of the Red Land

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, April 12: It looks like the neighbour across the great wall has been giving some sleepless nights to owners of small and medium businesses across India.

 Close to 48 per cent of Indias small and medium enterprises (SMEs) believe that China will remain the biggest growth story in Asia and India will lag behind. Close to 90 per cent of Indian SMEs believe that India will never surpass China. According to the findings of the Second Asian Business Monitor carried out by UPS, close to 57 per cent of Indian businessmen believe that their country will not equal China ever. 

 However, the Chinese are no longer perceived as a major threat. According to the study, only 18 per cent businessmen here view China as a threat and an overwhelming 62 per cent believe that China can actually help boost the regional economy. 

 But, alls not a bed of roses across the great wall. Chinese SMEs face a tough challenge in getting trained manpower. An overwhelming 90 per cent businessmen feel that lack of trained manpower followed by lack of innovation, IT adoption and lack of supply-chain efficiencies have an adverse effect on their growth. However, qualified staff is rated as more readily available in India compared with other markets.

 Asias SMEs are bullish on the regions prospects. Indian SMEs are the most optimistic in the region for their current business prospects as well as economic growth in India. Seventy seven per cent of SMEs in India have said the business prospects are better. 

 So what are some of the areas of concern for the Indian SMEs? This year, 70 per cent of SMEs have said their companies have credit and finance needs on an ongoing basis.

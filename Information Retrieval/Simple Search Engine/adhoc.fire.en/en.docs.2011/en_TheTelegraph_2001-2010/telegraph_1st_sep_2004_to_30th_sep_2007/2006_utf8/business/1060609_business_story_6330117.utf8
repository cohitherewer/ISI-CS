 Mittal launches Arcelor bid in US

 June 7 (Agencies): Mittal Steel today said its takeover offer to shareholders in European steelmaker Arcelor has officially begun in the US and would last until July 5.

 The offer, which was launched two weeks after the start of proceedings in Europe, was launched with similar conditions, Mittal said.

 Mittal Steel, the worlds biggest steelmaker, had begun its offer to Arcelor shareholders in Luxembourg, France and Belgium on May 18, despite opposition to the deal from the management of Arcelor.

 Arcelor has said executives from both companies would meet for the first time between now and the weekend to discuss the unsolicited takeover attempt.

 Mittal Steel said the Canadian competition bureau has confirmed it would not challenge the companys bid to acquire Arcelor. The clearance is unconditional, a Mittal Steel release said.

 Meanwhile, the war of words between Arcelor and Mittal Steel shifted to full-page newspaper advertisements today as both tried to win over Arcelor shareholders ahead of key meetings later this month.

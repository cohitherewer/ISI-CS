 Mahindras to invest Rs 1000 cr

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 8: Mahindra amp; Mahindra will invest Rs 1,000 crore in capacity expansion in the next three years. The company is also planning to set up completely-knocked-down assembly units in Russia and Malaysia.

 We are looking at investing Rs 1,000 crore in capacity expansion, which includes development of Ingenio at an investment of Rs 550 crore and engine development for Rs 100 crore. The remaining funds will be used for capacity expansion at the Uttaranchal plant, said Pawan Goenka, president (automotive sector), M amp;M.

 Goenka said the company will soon start operations at an assembly unit in Egypt. Production will start by March 2007. This unit will make 5,000-6,000 Scorpios every year. It will be sold in West Asia.

 Depending on demand from the market, we may scale up production later, he added. We are planning assembly units for the Scorpio in Russia and the Scorpio Pick-Up in Malaysia. A final decision on both is expected by December this year, Goenka said.

 The company is also working on hybrid vehicles. A hybrid Scorpio is expected to hit Indian roads by end-2008.

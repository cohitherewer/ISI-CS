 Fresh Birla-Lodha clash

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 14: The Birlas and the Lodhas today locked horns over the observations made in the May 19 judgment of Justice Kalyan Jyoti Sengupta. While the Birla camp held a press meet today and quoted from the ruling and claimed that it described R.S. Lodha as a tainted person who should not be allowed to manage or handle the estate, the rival party retorted back saying this might tantamount to contempt of court.

 Justice Senguptas ruling was on the appointment of administrators for MP Birla group of companies.

 Lodha sources claimed the appeal court of Justice P.C. Ghose and Justice T. K. Dutt, made it clear yesterday that no effect should be given to the single bench order of Justice Sengupta till they hear out the appeal made by Lodha.

 The act of Birla counsel ? to hold a press meet and provide photocopy of the stayed order and thereby influence public at large and the judiciary ? could constitute as criminal contempt of the court, sources added.

 On May 19, Lodhas counsel had moved the appeal court challenging the terms set by Justice Sengupta in his ruling.

 Sengupta had granted three weeks relief before the appointment of administrators with a condition that Lodha could not act as chairman or director of the MP Birla group of companies on the strength of the shareholding of late Priyamvada Birla. The division bench had stayed the conditions but asked Lodha not to take any policy decision on the estate of Priyamvada till the disposal of his appeal against the conditions imposed by the trial court.

 The division bench yesterday took up the appeal of Lodha for hearing and extended the stay till the disposal of the appeal against the conditions. Justice Senguptas order, however, is quite damaging for Lodha, claimant of the Rs 5,000-crore MP Birla empire. For instance, it said the act and conduct of Lodha after the death of Priyamvada ? the way he mutated or registered his name in various group firms on the strength of the unprobated will ? was not appreciated by the court. Moreover, the judgment raised doubt about how Lodha is meeting litigation expenses ? whether it has been spent out of the estate impressed with him as an executor or from his own account.

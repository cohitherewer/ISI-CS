 MRPL update 

kitty ready

 Time to rise

 New Delhi, March 5: The Oil and Natural Gas Corporation has approved a Rs 8000-crore proposal to upgrade Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd. 

 The integrated refinery upgradation project will raise the capacity of Mangalore Refinery (MRPL) to 15 million tonnes from 9.69 million tonnes at present. 

 The project, expected to be completed in three-and-a-half-years time, will make MRPL one of the largest PSU refinery investments at a single location in the country. It will enhance MRPLs value in the refinery business, ONGC said in a statement.

 The distillate yield from each barrel of crude will improve significantly, minimising the bottom-end products where realisation is lower.

 The project envisages production of high value products like propylene and Euro III and Euro IV compliant petrol and diesel, which have a high demand in the international market. The coastal location of the refinery gives it an edge for exports. 

 The new refinery configuration, as envisaged in the upgradation project, would allow processing of higher proportion of low-cost sour and heavy crude leading to a better margin. 

 Under the project, MRPL will build a 250000-tonnes per annum lube production facility, which will help the company enter the high-priced lube oil market. It will produce high-end group I and group II lube oils. 

 MRPL chairman Subir Raha said this is the first of a series of major projects planned at Mangalore. The integrated upgradation project will further improve the cost-efficiency of the refinery. 

 ONGC has turned around MRPL after it bought the AV Birla groups stake in the loss-making joint venture with Hindustan Petroleum.

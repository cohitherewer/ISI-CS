 Higher output target set for ONGC

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Raha: Plainspeak

 New Delhi, April 10: The government has fixed a target of 27.35 million tonnes of crude for ONGC during the current fiscal, which is 2.76 per cent higher than last years target of 26.61 million tonnes.

 The target for gas production for the year at 21.97 billion cubic metres (bcm) is 2.65 per cent higher than last years target of 21.41 bcm. In addition, the company is expected to produce 2.9 million tonnes of value-added products such as LPG during the year.

 The memorandum of understanding (MoU) was signed today between petroleum secretary M.S. Srinivasan and ONGC chairman Subir Raha.

 Srinivasan told reporters that Rs 12,947 crore has been fixed as ONGCs targeted net profit for 2006-07 on a turnover of Rs 46,025 crore. The MoU expects the oil firm to rake in a gross profit of Rs 18,705 crore during the year.

 Last fiscal (2005-06), ONGCs crude oil production declined due to an accident in which an offshore supply vessel had hit the BHN platform in Mumbai High triggering a major fire and had gutted the entire platform. The company had produced around 25 million tonnes of crude, which was 9 per cent less than the target for the year. 

 ONGC is confident of meeting the higher crude oil production target agreed in the MoU for 2006-07, the company said.

 ONGC expects to restore the output at Mumbai High to normalcy by July this year with the installation of a floating production system in the next few months.

 In the MoU, the performance of ONGCs subsidiaries ? ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL) and Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Limited (MRPL) ? has been included with an assigned weightage of 2 per cent. Each of these companies will have a 1 per cent weight in the overall MoU.

 In sharp contrast to last year, when there had been a major controversy over the signing of the MoU between ONGC and the petroleum ministry, the matter has sailed through smoothly this year. 

 The ONGC chairman had refused to accept the ministrys target of over 30 million tonnes for crude oil production that was initially fixed for last year. Raha had argued that this would result in flogging the countrys oilfields.

 Similarly, there were sharp differences over the oil production target for ONGC-Videsh Ltd, which the ministry wanted to fix.

 Raha said since OVL had only a small share in some of its overseas fields and was not the operator of those fields, there was no way of ensuring that the target would be met. 

 The matter had to be referred to a task force set up by the department of public enterprises. This year both the issues have been settled after factoring in ONGCs views. 

 Raha said ONGC would sign performance agreements with OVL and MRPL, which is in tune with the DPE guidelines.

 Gas sales commitment, employee training and motivation are the other parameters mentioned in the MoU, as there is a renewed focus on customer satisfaction and improving employees performance.

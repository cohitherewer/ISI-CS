 Sebi hikes fee for foreign funds

 OUR BUREAU

 Mumbai, July 13: The Securities and Exchange Board of India today revised the registration fees of foreign institutional investors (FIIs) to $10,000 from $5,000 previously. The fee would have retrospective effect from June 26, a Sebi notification said.

 The market regulator has also revised the registration validity period for FIIs from five years to three years, it added.

 Further, Sebi revised the registration fees for sub-accounts maintained by FIIs to $2,000 from $1,000.

 At present, there are over 900 FIIs operating in the country.

 Recently, the finance ministry has asked Sebi to do away with the practice of allocating debt investment limits for an individual FII. Cumulatively, FIIs can invest $3.5 billion in government securities and corporate paper in India.

 Meanwhile, the market regulator has asked all stock exchanges to make permanent account number (PAN) mandatory for all entities/persons trading in the cash market with effect from October.

 Stock exchanges have been asked to collect copies of PAN cards issued to their existing as well as new clients and maintain the same in their record, a Sebi circular said today.

 Earlier, PAN was made mandatory for transacting in the futures and options market as well as for operating a beneficiary owner (BO) account in the depository system.

 The stock exchanges shall ensure that with effect from October 1, 2006, transactions in the cash market are executed only in respect of clients whose PAN details have been collected, the market regulator said.

 SOHINI MOOKHERJEA

 Calcutta, Dec. 8: Exports from the Software Technology Parks of India (STPI) is set to grow by 30 per cent this fiscal over last years Rs 100,809 crore.

 Exports from Bengal are expected to go up from Rs 2,500 crore in 2005-06 to Rs 3,500 crore in 2006-07.

 Bengal, which ranks eighth in terms of exports by registered STP units, currently comprises around 2.5 per cent of the nations exports. This is because the state was a late starter. But the proactive state government, along with STPI, is making efforts to make up this lag. We hope that it will bear fruit in the years to come, said S.N. Zindal, director-general of STPI.

 Karnataka comprises around 30 per cent of the exports at Rs 37,000 crore, a growth of 34 per cent from Rs 27,600 crore in 2004-05. Exports from Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu stand at Rs 15,500 crore and Rs 13,960 crore respectively.

 The software technology park at Haldia is set to become operational within the next two months.

 The facility can house over 20 units for which expressions of interest are coming in from various parts of the country. Only two units are set to start operations.

 The companies for Haldia include a BPO from Haldia and one from Calcutta which will commence operations shortly. The cost has been shared by STPI and the state government, Zindal added.

 While the state government has provided three plots for the complex and sponsored part of the built-up space, Rs 3 to Rs 4 crore has been provided by STPI.

 Considerable improvement has been made in connectivity and infrastructure, Zindal said. A lot more needs to be done, he added.

 The cable landing station at Haldia will provide the much-needed boost.

 Besides the STPI complex in Haldia, Bengal has another three at Durgapur, Kharagpur and Siliguri. 

 Two units each have set up operations in Durgapur and Siliguri, while at Kharagpur, companies are yet to come and lease space.

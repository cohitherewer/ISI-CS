 BoB charts plan to expand abroad

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, March 1: Bank of Baroda (BoB) plans to enhance its overseas presence and expects to start operations in Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, New Zealand and Canada soon.

 We have sought permissions for setting up operations in these countries and while we have received approvals from the Reserve Bank of India, we are awaiting clearance from the host countries, said BoB chairman A. K. Khandelwal. The bank today entered into a distribution alliance with UTI Mutual Fund. 

 Overseas operations contribute around 20 per cent of our total revenues and we expect a growth of 30 per cent in these markets over the coming period, said Khandelwal. 

 The bank is also keen on expanding its presence, particularly in Gulf countries like Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Yemen. 

 In the Gulf, where it has six branches in the UAE and three in Oman, the bank is keen to expand operations to other countries to better serve not only the large expatriate Indian population, which is estimated to be around 5 million, but also the growing trade and investment flow. 

 We are also focussing on the Caribbean countries as it has great trade and investment potential. We plan to open an office in Trinidad and Tobago, for which we are awaiting final approvals, Khandelwal added. 

 We are focussing on Africa and plan to expand operations in Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Arusha, Botswana, Frances Town and Mozambique, he added.

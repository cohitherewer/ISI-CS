 New blip on Anil screen

 Ambani: Forging ahead

 Mumbai, March 22: The race to introduce Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) has moved to a faster track. Telecommunication equipment maker Motorola said it was close to a tieup with Reliance Infocomm to provide set-top boxes for the company?s IPTV rollout in the country. 

 IPTV is an interactive system that enables you to use your PC to surf the Net, watch TV or make phone calls.

 ?We have a set-top model that is fully compliant with the requirements specified in the Reliance tender, in particular that it should be compatible with Microsoft,? said Pat Canavan, senior vice-president of global marketing and portfolio management, Motorola. 

 Earlier this month, Reliance Communications Ventures (RCoVL) chairman Anil Ambani had said his company would roll out the IPTV service by the end of 2006. 

 Reliance Infocomm is a subsidiary of RCoVL and is due to be merged with the parent. 

 ?We are hoping to start with a subscription base of around 5 million connections,? an RCoVL source said. 

 Motorola officials indicated that they might receive an order ranging anywhere between 3 million to 5 million set-top boxes from Reliance.

 Motorola is also in talks with other players ? Tata Indicom, Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd, Bharat Sanchar Nigam and Bharti Airtel ? that have thrown their hat in the race to bring IPTV to India.

 But Reliance seems to be the fastest runner at this stage. Other than Reliance, nobody has openly spoken about their plans for IPTV yet.

 ?The fibre optic cable for IPTV launch in India has been laid. What now remains to be finalised is last-mile connectivity from the kerb to the consumer?s home,? said a Motorola source involved in the negotiations. 

 RCoVL sources said the company was banking heavily on the IPTV business. 

 ?If that turns out to be a hit, the way we perceive it, it can do wonders for our stock. Microsoft will be the software provider for the venture,? said a senior RCOVL source. 

 The scrip has already scaled up to almost a 52-week high today and is hovering around Rs 317 to Rs 318. ?The effect on the entire expense part on the balance sheet, liabilities, income and on all the secured loans will be positive,? said Gaurang Shah of Geojit Financial Services.

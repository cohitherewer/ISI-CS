 Yours, mine amp; ours

 How should a couple operate their bank accounts? Srikumar Banerjee looks at the options

 Money is the next big issue after sex that drives partners apart. Many joint families have disintegrated fighting over it. Yet, money matters are hard to talk about because of our cultural conditioning.

 In a male-dominated society, family finances are generally the prerogative of the head of the family or the husband.

 This not only leads to a skewed and improper planning of family finances but also creates a sense of discontent and disintegration.

Reality of money

 Dealing with the reality of money is important. Financial responsibilities have undergone a sea change with nuclear families becoming the norm. The goal should be to create stronger family ties with greater financial responsibilities on both the partners.

 To achieve this, one can use joint or separate accounts or a mix of both for savings and investments depending on the personality of the partners and the degree of independence each wants to enjoy in financial matters.

 While in a single holder account, only the account holder can transact, a joint account imparts a sense of togetherness and greater responsibility in managing family finances. 

 Separate accounts are undesirable unless both the partners are extremely independent-minded and have a very clear understanding and communication between them. 

 Still, if you want to use separate accounts for personal savings and investments, it is always advisable to have ?yours?, ?mine? and ?ours? account. 

It?s a pool

 The partners can contribute equally to the joint account every month. This pool can be used to meet the monthly expenditure of the family, while for personal needs, each partner can draw upon their individual accounts. Thus by using a mix of separate and joint accounts, people can equally share the financial responsibilities towards the family and still retain their individual independence. 

 How much each partner should contribute to the joint account can be worked out as follows. Calculate the average monthly expenditure of the family for the last three months. Provide for a contingency allowance depending on the arrival of guests to your house, medical and other emergency needs. Now divide the total between the two of you. 

Nominate

 In the individual accounts, each partner should name the spouse a nominee . A nomination facility helps smooth transfer of ownership of assets to the nominee in case some misfortune befalls the account holder. Moreover, the nomination facility doesnt interfere in the mode of operation of the account. 

 The account holder still enjoys the absolute right to transact on the account.

 When one member is not working, a joint account can be opened with the working spouse as the first applicant and the non-working partner as the second. 

 It gives the non-working spouse a greater financial responsibility to save more and spend less.

Either or survivor

 Transactions in a joint account can be done jointly or by either of the account holders. If there are more than two persons jointly holding an account, the ?anyone-or-survivor? option can be chosen. 

 If the mode of account operation is chosen as ?jointly?, for every transaction all the account holders? consent will be required. This may create problems when one of them is not available but a transaction needs to be done urgently.

 A better option is ?either or survivor?. This mandate simply tells that the benefits of the account ? principal plus the accrued interest or returns ? will be given to the survivor if the other account holder dies. Under this mandate, the account can be operated by any of the individuals.

 ?Anyone or survivor? also has similar implications. But this mandate is given when there are more than two individuals jointly holding the account. 

Lockers, property...

 From savings bank deposits to bank lockers to share holding or a house property, every financial instrument can be held in a separate or joint account with a nomination. 

Mode matters

 People should take care of the sequence of names in which different assets are held. If a company?s shares or bank fixed deposits are held in joint names with A as the first applicant and B as the second, the bank account should also be held in that order. Otherwise, there will be a lot of problems.

 However, clear instructions should be given regarding the mode of operation while opening a joint account. Otherwise transactions have to be jointly authorised by all holders.

 In case any dispute arises between the holders and the same is notified to the bank by any one of them, the mandate will stand revoked automatically and the account should be operated jointly by all until a fresh mandate, signed by all the account holders, is furnished with the bank again.

Old is gold

 An account under the Senior Citizens Savings Scheme can be opened jointly with the spouse. However, there is no age limit for the second applicant (or the spouse).

 Pensioners can take heart as the government has allowed pension credit to a joint account from last year. But such an account must be held by the pensioner and the spouse. 

 For credit of the pension to such a joint account, the pensioner must give an authorisation in favour of the spouse in the Pension Payment Order. 

 A joint account for pension can be operated either by ?former or survivor? or ?either or survivor? basis.

 Infy staff get cash gift for silver show

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mysore, July 30: Infosys today kicked off the companys silver-jubilee celebrations here by announcing a bonanza of Rs 126 crore for its employees from the corpus of the Infosys Employees Welfare Trust.

 Chief mentor N.R. Narayana Murthy conveyed this while addressing the celebrations at the Mysore leadership training centre.

 Today, the trust has decided that all employees will receive money from the fund. Of course, the amount will depend on how long they have been with the company, he said. Infosys is known to create wealth and distribute knowledge. 

 Finance minister P. Chidambaram, who was also present, said infosys has placed India among the worlds frontline nations. India needed to replicate the success of Infosys, he said. We can be giants not just in IT, but steel, petroleum or any other area. 

 Nasdaq honour

 Infosys board members will ring the Nasdaq opening bell on Monday via a remote control device from the Mysore facility. It will not just be an honour for the company but also a momentous occasion for Nasdaq, as Infosys was the first Indian company to be listed on the Nasdaq in 1999. 

 Nasdaq president and CEO Robert Greifeld and Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia will also be present on the occasion.

 Nasdaq, which lists 85 per cent of the infotech firms in the world, had set up an Indian representative office in Bangalore in 2000. Nasdaq representative Ghanshyam Dass told The Telegraph that it was an honour for Nasdaq to be part of the IT bellwethers silver-jubilee celebrations.

 Currently, seven Indian firms are listed on the Nasdaq. Out of these, Infosys, Sify and Rediff are based in India while Syntel, Cognizant, Kanbay and Covansys are domiciled in the US but are essentially Indian companies, as over 80 per cent of their revenues are generated here, Dass said. 

 The seven Indian firms on the Nasdaq account for a total market capitalisation of $29,303,096,7000. 

 Dass said the bourse is also talking to other Indian firms and at least three firms are likely to list by the year end. We are also talking to NYSE listed Indian firms to consider dual listing on the Nasdaq, he added.

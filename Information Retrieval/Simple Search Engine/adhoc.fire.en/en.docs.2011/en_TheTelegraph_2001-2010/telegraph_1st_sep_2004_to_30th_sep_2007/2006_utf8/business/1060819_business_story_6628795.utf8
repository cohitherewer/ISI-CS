 RyanAir raises voice against security drill

 Mumbai, Aug. 18: RyanAir, the no-frills airline in Britain, has threatened to hit the Blair government with a tab to compensate it for the losses it is suffering because of the heightened security measures at British airports after Scotland Yard busted a terrorist plot to blow up planes in mid-air.

 The airline has written to the UKs secretary of state for transport Douglas Alexander asking him to immediately restore the security measures at Britains airports to the IATA normal standards in order to get Britains airports and airlines moving again.

 If the government restores the security at British airports to normal IATA levels within the next seven days, then it (RyanAir Holdings) will not make any claim for compensation, which it is entitled to, under the provisions of Section 93 of the Transport Act 2000, the airline said.

 Ryanair is clearly frustrated with the stepped-up security measures and the way they have started hurting its operations. It is the first airline that expressed its disapproval with the continued frisking of passengers and the new baggage rules that have led to flight delays in British airports.

 The only way to prove to the terrorists that they cannot disrupt British life is to return the airport security requirements to their safe pre-9 August levels, RyanAir said.

 At the same time, the airline lobbied the government to relax its absurd baggage rules and stop the frenzied body searches at British airports.

 It demanded that the government restore the hand luggage allowance for passengers leaving British airports to the normal IATA dimensions of a small wheelie case, which is just 20 per cent larger than the current restriction of a large briefcase dimension. There is no difference in security whatsoever between a large briefcase and a small carry-on wheelie bag, the airline said.

 It also wanted the passenger body searches reduced from the current one in two to the normal one in four.

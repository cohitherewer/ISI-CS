 National Iron takeover to come in handy for SAIL

 AMIT CHAKRABORTY

 Calcutta, March 31: The Steel Authority of India (SAIL) has decided to take over the ailing National Iron and Steel Company located at Belur.

 The Belur unit, spread over 121 acres, will operate as a greenfield downstream facility for Durgapur Steel Plant and Indian Iron and Steel Company (IISCO), which was recently amalgamated with SAIL.

 The takeover has been cleared on a clean slate basis, which means the company does not carry over any liabilities. The state government has agreed to waive all internal dues, which constitute a major portion of the companys liabilities.

 Confirming the move, executive director V. Shyam Sundar told The Telegraph the acquisition of NISCO would be treated as a greenfield project linked to DSP and IISCO, both of which make a lot of semis. Shyam Sundar added that the facility would also be used for making thermo-mechanically treated (TMT) bars and rods. 

 A senior official of the department of public enterprises and industrial reconstruction said there was no problem in handing over NISCO to SAIL on a clean slate basis. 

 The bulk of NISCOs liability of over Rs 160 crore is state governments, which could be waived, the official said.

 Overlooking the historical Belur station, NISCO was set up as a downstream unit for Tata Steel and IISCO in the mid-1930s by the N.D. Agarwal family. 

 The unit gradually became a fully-integrated mini steel plant with a capacity to produce 30000 tonnes of steel products per annum.

 Apart from two electric arc furnaces, it had a foundry, steel melting shop, machine shop and rolling mill. But the company went downhill in the sixties as a host of other engineering units became victims of excess workers, labour unrest, shrunk market and poor managerial capabilities.

 The Centre took over the company in 1979 and handed it over to Bengal in 1984. Both the Centre and the state tried to protect the jobs of over 1200 workers and continued to pay their salaries. However, the company did not receive any working capital finance or other inputs to revive it.

 Things deteriorated fast and NISCO was reduced to a conversion unit for private steel traders making high-speed deformed (HSD) bars, a senior state government official said. 

 The employee strength dropped to 400 as recruitment was stopped since the government takeover. An official said 215 people had also opted for a voluntary separation scheme. So when SAIL formally takes it over, the worker strength would be less than 200. However, the state government will request SAIL to recruit the remaining labourers in its new unit.

 A senior SAIL official, who visited the plant as a member of the high-level team on a pre-takeover study, said an internal committee has been formed to prepare a techno-economic feasibility study to help the 70-year old facility make a fresh start. Our assessment is that the plant should concentrate on long products specially bars and rods used for construction and fabrication purposes, the official said.

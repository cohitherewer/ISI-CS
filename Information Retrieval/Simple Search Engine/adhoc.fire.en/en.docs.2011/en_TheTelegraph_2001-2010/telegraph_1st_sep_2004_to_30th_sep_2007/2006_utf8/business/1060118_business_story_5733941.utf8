 New Delhi, Jan. 17: Even as India is gradually becoming a hub of global auto majors, the Chinese component industry is making silent inroads, raising concerns about possible dumping of spare parts in the country.

 More than 50 large and small auto component manufacturers from different parts of China have participated in this years auto expo, primarily to explore opportunities in the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) segment as well as in the growing replacement market. More and more Indian automobile companies are also reaching out to China to source components and spare parts as it offers them a significant price differential.

 An official of a domestic car company said in some instances, Chinese spare parts offer a price advantage of up to 40 per cent vis-?-vis the domestic OEM market.

 Industry analysts said auto companies benefit from the prices set by Chinese manufacturers even after taking into consideration the prevailing customs duty of 15 per cent.

 Component imports from China have showed a steady increase over the last few years. For instance, import of wheel and rims and steering suspension systems from China has increased to Rs 189 crore till August 2005 from Rs 91 crore in 2003-04.

 Sources said the government has agreed to undertake a detailed study to find out whether Chinese components have been dumped in India. The Automobile Component Manufacturers Association (ACMA) has asked the government to adopt appropriate measures.

 The Chinese firms that have participated in the expo are Ruli Automobile Hydraulic Parts Company, which manufacturers luxury and power steering parts, Xintian Group Company ? a manufacturer of radiators and fan blades ? and Xiamen Powerlink Trading, which manufactures roller and ball bearings.

 Global attention is visible from the size of new entrants such as China and Iran, D.K. Jain, ACMA chairman, said.

 Double treat for RPL on a single day

 Mumbai, April 20: Chevron Corporation of the US has been formally roped in as a co-promoter of Reliance Petroleum even as the blockbuster IPO closed today with an over-subscription of more than 50 times.

 Chevron, which has the option to scale up its stake to 29 per cent, will no longer be seen as a mere financial investor and strengthens its ties with the Mukesh Ambani group company.

 ?Chevron coming as a co-promoter means that both these groups will now be working more closely. They will work in a collaborative fashion in India and abroad. For Chevron, it is a major entry into India while Reliance could now learn a lot from the relationship. For instance, in oil and gas exploration alone, Reliance is a 10-year old baby when compared to the decades old existence of Chevron in this area,? sources said.

 Meanwhile, a new record was established in the county?s primary capital market with Reliance Petroleum receiving 13 lakh applications from retail investors till 5 pm. While the National Thermal Power Corporation Ltd had received the highest number of retail applications ever at over 14.2 lakh, this record was on the verge of being broken.

 Data emanating from both the exchanges showed that as against the total issue size of 45 crore shares, the RPL issue received bids for 2,261 crore shares.

 Sources said the book size was over Rs 1,36,000 crore ? making it the largest ever in the Indian capital market history. Even the company was surprised by the response and sources indicated that the internal target had been set at Rs 1 lakh crore, which has been exceeded. Over 19 lakh retail applications have been received.

 The ONGC book size was the largest till date at around Rs 73,000 crore ? and it does seem as though the RPL book will be twice as big. This is the first time that a greenfield project ? which will not provide any yields for the next two years ? is raking in such a large amount of money and bears testimony to the faith that investors repose in the Ambani name.

 On April 11, Chevron had signed an agreement with Reliance Industries Ltd to pick up a 5 per cent stake in RPL for $300 million. A Chevron nominee will also join the RPL board. 

 It is possible that Chevron?s board representation will rise when it raises its stake in RPL to 29 per cent. 

 Reports say the Reliance group headed by Mukesh Ambani and Chevron could join hands on many fronts, including crude supply, product offtake and marketing of the RPL refinery that is being set up at Jamnagar in Gujarat.

 There is a speculation that Chevron will pick up a stake in RIL?s Krishna-Godavari basin. The two partners are expected to bid jointly for fresh oil exploration projects in the country.

 New-age bank debt tool off CRR leash

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, July 21: In a major boost to commercial banks, particularly the nationalised ones planning to raise resources through the issue of innovative perpetual debt instruments (IPDI), the Reserve Bank today exempted the amount raised through such instruments from the purview of the cash reserve ratio (CRR).

 The central bank has also kept the investments made by foreign institutional investors (FIIs) in these instruments outside the limit of the $1.5-billion ceiling fixed for corporate debt instruments.

 Earlier, the RBI permitted banks to raise funds through IPDIs and debt capital instruments for meeting business requirements as well as fulfilling Basel II norms, which would be implemented from March next year.

 In its notification, the RBI has also allowed commercial banks to raise IPDIs in foreign currency without its approval.

 Banks can raise funds through the IPDI up to 15 per cent of its tier I capital (the core capital that primarily consists of equity and reserves). 

 While IPDI forms part of a banks tier I capital, the RBI said banks might increase their capital funds through the issue of IPDI in foreign currency up to 49 per cent of the eligible amount.

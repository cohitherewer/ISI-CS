 Cars speed past bikes in local sales

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi, Dec. 8: Buoyed by strong demand, car sales in the country continued to show strong growth in November, accelerating 28.5 per cent. On the other hand, growth in demand for motorcycles was relatively sluggish at 15 per cent. 

 Healthy economic growth, rising pay packages, new model launches and hefty discounts have largely spurred the demand for cars.

 According to figures released by Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM), car sales in the domestic market was 88,473 units in November against 68,841 units in the same month last year.

 Taking cumulative sales into account, car sales in the eight months of this fiscal were up 22.6 per cent to 6,84,105 units from 5,57,929 units a year ago, said the SIAM report. 

 The commercial vehicle segment also grew 35.5 per cent for the first eight months of this fiscal to 2,85,087 units from 2,10,403 in April-November 2005.

 Eight of the 11 car manufacturers, including market leader Maruti Udyog Ltd, Hyundai India, Tata Motors, Honda and Ford, saw a healthy jump in sales. Fiat India, suffering from a slump in its fortunes, also saw rise in sales, even though overall sales were in low three figures. 

 Exceptions to the upward spiral were Hindustan Motors, SkodaAuto and Toyota Kirloskar.

 Among the two-wheelers, motorcycles maintained steady growth momentum as sales jumped 15 per cent to 5,56,612 units in November from 4,83,957 in the same month last year, said SIAM.

 Despite selling high numbers in November, growth rate for motorcycles remained far less than for cars.

 Even in the eight months of the fiscal, bike sales have risen 17.2 per cent to 44,67,576 units from 38,11,855 units in April-November 2005. 

 According to the growth shown by segment leaders Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India (HMSI) and TVS Motors, scooter sales in November was 88,831 units, growing 16 per cent over 76,406 units sold in the same month last year. Overall two-wheeler sales, comprising bikes, scooters and mopeds, grew 14.7 per cent in the month to 6,74,692 units from 5,87,938 units in November 2005.

 Total two-wheeler sales in the April-November 2006 period were up 14.4 per cent to 53,08,718 units from 46,39,105 units in the same period last fiscal.

 Bus and truck or commercial vehicle sales were up a healthy 43.1 per cent in November to 40,317 units from 28,174 units in the same month last year, SIAM said.

 Sale of medium and heavy-commercial vehicles were 22,862 units against 16,514 units a year ago, the increased infrastructure development projects spurring the demand.

 On the other hand, light commercial vehicles demand in the month was up almost 50 per cent as sales stood at 17,455 units against 11,660 units in November 2005.

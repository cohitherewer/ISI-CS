 Arcelor directors take stock

 Luxembourg, June 11 (Reuters): Arcelors board met on Sunday to prepare a response to shareholders unhappy with its white knight deal to save the steelmaker from Mittal Steels unsolicited 22-billion-euro ($27.9 billion) bid.

 I arrive with a very positive state of mind, board member Fernand Wagner told reporters on his way into the meeting at Arcelor headquarters at 1300 GMT.

 A source close to the company said any announcement on the outcome of the board meeting was unlikely before Monday. Arcelors directors are expected to rebuff Mittals advances formally for a second time and reject its offer at the meeting. But more difficult for Arcelor is how to handle a revolt by some shareholders, who are angry they have had little say in the companys plans to merge with Russias Severstal.

 Their calls for a special shareholder meeting to vote on the Severstal deal may give Mittal a decisive advantage due to timetable technicalities.

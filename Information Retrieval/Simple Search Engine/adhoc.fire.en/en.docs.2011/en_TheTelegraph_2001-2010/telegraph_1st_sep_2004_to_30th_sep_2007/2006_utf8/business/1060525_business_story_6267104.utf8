 IMF for inflation vigilance 

 Kuala Lumpur, May 24 (Reuters): Rises in global interest rates are healthy and policy makers and central banks need to keep a watchful eye on inflation, the chief of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said on Wednesday.

 But the global economy is not headed for a long spell of high inflation and credit costs, Rodrigo Rato told Reuters in an interview in the Malaysian capital.

 The world economy has strong prospects of growth in this year and the next, the IMFs managing director said.

 In many economies, the path of recovery is very strong and many economies are working at capacity, he added. 

 That, of course, also puts strains on inflationary pressures, so inflationary pressures should be a source of vigilance, he said

 Rato had said in Vienna on Monday that the Federal Reserve may need to keep raising interest rates depending on how US economic conditions evolved. 

 His comments stoked fears that led to a tumble in Latin American stocks and currencies.

 Calcutta, April 21: Uco Bank plans to tap the market this fiscal to raise Rs 3,600 crore tier-II capital. 

 Of this, Rs 600 crore will be raised via upper tier II bonds and the remaining Rs 3,000 crore through ordinary subordinated bonds, said V. Sridar, chairman-cum-managing director of Uco Bank.

 The fund will be raised in tranches and the first offering will be made in another two weeks, Sridar added.

 This is the second time in this calendar year that the city-based bank will mobilise its capital by issuing upper tier II bonds ? a hybrid of equity and debt. Uco Bank had raised Rs 200 crore via the hybrid debt instrument in March. It was the first bank to do so after the Reserve Bank of India permitted commercial banks in January to issue upper tier II bonds.

 The banks business in 2005-06 has grown 19 per cent year-on-year to Rs 92,500 crore, Sridar said, adding the credit business during the fiscal surged by 34 per cent to Rs 38,000 crore, while deposits grew 10.4 per cent to Rs 54,500 crore.

 Uco Bank will soon raise its retail lending rates, according to the banks chairman. The management will soon meet to decide on the extent by which we should raise our rates, Sridar said. 

 However, we are definitely going to charge differential rates depending on the margins kept by a borrower. The apex banks directive says banks should provide for a 100 per cent risk weight for loans where a borrowers margin is less than 25 per cent. This means that a borrower who wants up to 75 per cent of the value of his/her purchase to be financed will have to pay a lower interest rate than a person who wants 100 per cent financing, he added. 

 This has never been the practice. However, it is going to be a norm now, Sridar said.

 Meanwhile, Uco Bank today tied up with Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Company to provide personal accident cover for its Kisan Credit Cards. 

 Earlier, the bank used to provide the cover in association with the four public sector non-life insurers. 

 But following the tie-up with Bajaj Allianz, Uco Bank will not only be able to lower the insurance cost for its farmer borrowers it will also be able to save a few lakhs of rupees. 

 The public sector insurers were charging Rs 15 for a personal accident cover of Rs 50,000. Each KCC holder was paying Rs 10 per year, while the bank contributed Rs 5 towards the insurance cost. But Bajaj Allianz will charge Rs 11. Thus a cardholder will now have to pay Rs 8 and the bank Rs 3 for the same amount of cover, said a senior Uco Bank official.

 The bank has so far issued Kisan Credit Cards to 1,02,318 farmers and the total disbursement of loans through these cards stood at Rs 415.77 crore.

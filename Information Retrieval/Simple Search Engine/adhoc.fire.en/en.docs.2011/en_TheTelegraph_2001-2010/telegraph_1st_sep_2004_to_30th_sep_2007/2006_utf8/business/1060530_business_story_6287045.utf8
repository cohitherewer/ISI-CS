 Mumbai, May 29: Mahindra amp; Mahindra (M amp;M), the utility vehicle and tractor manufacturer, is working on a new multipurpose vehicle (MPV) platform christened Ingenio, which is scheduled for launch in 2008. The initiative is part of a larger plan to straddle the automobile space. 

 Apart from its sport utility vehicle Scorpio, M amp;M is now scheduled to bring in the Logan sedan through a venture with Frances Renault. It also has a joint venture with Navistar Incs International Truck and Engine Corporation to manufacture medium and heavy trucks.

 While the automotive segment now contributes close to 64 per cent of the companys topline on a stand-alone basis, the top management at M amp;M is gung-ho about the new platform.

 Anand Mahindra, vice chairman amp; managing director of M amp;M, today said even as Ingenio has created a lot of excitement within the company, what is more promising are the individual aggregates that would go into the new project. 

 Without giving further details, Mahindra hinted that the styling of Ingenio would be a lot more superior. 

 The top management of M amp;M were interacting with the media after the company announced its annual numbers for the year ended March 31. 

 Replying to various queries, Pawan Goenka, president of automotive sector, M amp;M, revealed that marketing of Logan would be according to schedule. M amp;M plans to launch the vehicle by the first half of 2007. The manufacturing capacity during first year of operations is expected to be around 40,000 units.

 Marketing of trucks from its venture with International Truck and Engine Corporation will begin in early 2008.

 M amp;Ms net profit on a stand-alone basis jumped 110 per cent to Rs 321.17 crore in the quarter ended March 31 from Rs 152.66 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year. This came after the company made a one-time gain of Rs 168 crore from the sale of shares in Mahindra amp; Mahindra Financial Services Ltd.

 The quarter saw raw material expenses rising to Rs 1,467 crore from Rs 1,287 crore last year. At the topline, net sales of the company were placed at Rs 2,288.83 crore (Rs 1,910.68 crore).

 For the full year ended March 31, 2006, net profit jumped to Rs 857.10 crore from Rs 512.67 crore in the previous fiscal. Net sales of the company stood at Rs 8,222.68 crore compared with Rs 6,660.55 crore in 2004-05.

 It is not in the automotive segment alone where the firm has ambitious plans. In farm equipment, M amp;M is planning to bring in tractors of less than 30 hp from its Jianling facility in China. M amp;M is of the opinion that a large market exists for such tractors, since many farmers still do not own a tractor.

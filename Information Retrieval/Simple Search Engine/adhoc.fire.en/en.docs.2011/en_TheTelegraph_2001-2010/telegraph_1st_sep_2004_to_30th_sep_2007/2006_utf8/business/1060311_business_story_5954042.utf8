 Reddy gives cash crunch warning

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Reddy: Watchful

 Mumbai, March 10: Reserve Bank governor Yaga Venugopal Reddy today acknowledged that the banking system could face a liquidity crunch around the middle of this month due to advance tax outflows. 

 However, the central bank will ensure adequate liquidity through various instruments under its arsenal to achieve stability.

 Liquidity conditions in the system have became tighter from the middle of December due to redemption of $7.1 billion India Millennium Deposits (IMD) and sustained credit growth of both corporate and retail segments.

 While the liquidity impact of the IMD redemption is put at about Rs 32,000 crore, the RBI has been injecting cash into the system by way of liquidity adjustment facility done through repo and reverse repo windows. 

 At the same time, the central bank has not issued any new auctions, thus saving vital liquidity. 

 In addition, the RBI has been providing daily refinance to banks to the tune of Rs 2,208 crore. It has also injected liquidity through forex operations by buying dollars, even as the government has made a private placement of bonds with the apex bank.

 Speaking at the eighth Global Conference of Actuaries, Reddy said, ?I recognise some pressure on liquidity, though it has improved.? 

 Transient factors such as advance tax outflows are affecting the market liquidity.

 He, however, added that such liquidity pressures could be managed through the refinance or the repo window, thus indicating that the central bank may sell bonds to inject liquidity. 

 ?The Reserve Bank will continue to undertake money market operations consistent with the interest rate regime. It has a range of instruments to manage liquidity in line with the monetary policy,? he said.

 According to the governor, liquidity could also improve as banks manage to raise the deposit growth.

 Although Reddy expressed caution over liquidity, he was optimistic with the current macroeconomic scenario. 

 ?Low growth accompanied by high inflation is a nightmare for a central banker. High growth coupled with low inflation is indeed a central banker?s dream. I have reasons to be happy, considering the growth and inflation numbers in India now.?

 However, he anticipated possible risks in the form of global imbalances and high oil prices. 

 Cautioning the domestic financial markets against such risks, Reddy said, ?Most market participants seem to sense these risks, but this sentiment does not appear in the pricing of risks.? 

 This statement impacted the government security prices, which took a hit. 

 Many market participants felt that this statement indicated the central bank will continue with its policy of fighting inflation and there will not be a cut in the cash reserve ratio (CRR), which is now at 5 per cent. 

 Cash reserve ratio is that portion of a bank?s deposits, which it has to maintain with the Reserve Bank.

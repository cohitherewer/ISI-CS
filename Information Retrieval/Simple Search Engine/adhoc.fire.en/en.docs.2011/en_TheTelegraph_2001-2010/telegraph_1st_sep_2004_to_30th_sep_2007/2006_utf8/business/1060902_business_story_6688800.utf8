 Global trend blunts steel price edge

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Rate riddle

 Mumbai, Sept. 1: Domestic producers of steel today dropped prices of hot rolled coils by Rs 750 to Rs 1,000 per tonne in response to softening trend in overseas markets. 

 Lean demand internationally coupled with exports from China have been blamed as the major reasons for lower prices abroad. This is the second time in this year that steel producers are bringing down prices since March.

 While the average price of hot rolled coils prior to the reduction stood at Rs 28,000 per tonne, all domestic producers, which included SAIL, Tata Steel, Essar Steel, JSW Steel and Ispat cut spot prices of the commodity for September.

 Industry circles expect hot rolled coil prices to remain soft till October. 

 We should see prices of the commodity again firming up from the month of November. Generally, this is the lean period. Demand should perk up in a couple of months, said a spokesperson from one of the domestic steel companies.

 He added that one of the main factors that has led to this situation lies in China where surplus domestic production has resulted in the country becoming a net exporter. However, the consolation here is that Chinese producers cannot bring down prices significantly in the marketplace as their input costs remain at high levels.

 Industry circles added that though the prices of hot rolled coils have been brought down, the prices of value-added items like galvanised steel remain the same. 

 However, there is an optimistic outlook here that robust demand coupled with firm zinc prices will result in higher prices.

 Despite the across-the-board reduction in hot rolled coil prices, analysts believe steel prices will rule firm in the long run. Industry observers said they have not altered projections for leading companies like Tata Steel, which are not dependent on the spot market and instead rely on long term contracts.

 Indias largest private sector steel company has also been concentrating heavily on value-added items over the past couple of years, thereby insulating it from any such price movements.

 A recent research report from JM Morgan Stanley said though steel makers could reduce prices by 2 to 4 per cent for the month of September to maintain the attractiveness of domestic prices vis--vis imports, its earnings projections for SAIL and Tisco remain unchanged.

 We have already modelled for these minor fluctuations in our projections, and accordingly maintain our overweight rating on these stocks, the report said. 

 JM Morgan Stanley added that after the reduction, shipments should improve further in the domestic market.

 We maintain our attractive industry view for the Indian steel sector. The domestic steel market will remain favourable for the steel makers in the coming nine months, notwithstanding some volatility, and hence we would view this negative news item as a good opportunity to add to positions in stocks like SAIL and Tisco that are leveraging their widening raw materials advantage to log in strong volume growth, it noted.

 Nothing official about RIL oil

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Whats in store?

 New Delhi, April 20: The directorate-general of hydrocarbons (DGH) has yet to endorse the oil struck by Reliance Industries in the Krishna-Godavari basin. The DGH said it was too early to assess the commercial viability of the reserves.

 The oil find in the deep sea Krishna-Godavari block is yet to be declared commercial. So I cannot say anything on the reserves it holds, director general of hydrocarbons V.K. Sibal said today.

 He said it would be premature to estimate the reserves and an assessment of commercial viability of the discovery can only be made once the find was tested.

 Sibal said more appraisal wells would be drilled to estimate the reserves and that it takes four to five years to start commercial production after the first strike. He said Reliance struck oil five months back, and the company has not reported any new find since then.

 The DGH was reacting to a report that said Reliance has found 55 million tonnes (mt) of reserves. The report did not quote any company officials. Also, Reliance is yet to go official on the find.

 As a regulator of the oil and gas sector, it is mandatory for all companies to inform the DGH of their discovery. The DGH monitors exploration activities and has the last word on the worth of the reserves.

 Before seeking ratification from the DGH, the oil company does its own assessment and then engages a reputed global consultant to pass judgement on the find. 

 The DGH assessment is based on the data of the company. Companies are not allowed to announce their discovery until the DGH gives its verdict.

 Sebi is in favour of the DGH issuing guidelines for announcing oil and gas discoveries as these tend to influence share prices.

 A case in point is ONGC, which is yet to go public with its discoveries in the last fiscal. The company found oil and gas in nine blocks and is still appraising the find.

 ONGC chairman Subir Raha said the company would make a formal announcement after completing the formal procedures comprising an in-house assessment, a certificate from a global expert and, finally, the DGH judgement.

 Lower prices eat into SAIL profit

 OUR BUREAU

 Jan. 27: Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) today reported a 54.7 per cent decline in net profit at Rs 684.59 crore in the third quarter ended December 2005 against Rs 1514.24 crore in the corresponding period a year ago. However, SAILs board of directors has approved an interim dividend of 12.5 per cent for the current fiscal.

 The state-run steel giants total income plummeted 18.3 per cent during the reporting quarter. Total income of the company decreased to Rs 6443.39 crore from Rs 7889.2 crore in the same period last fiscal.

 The lower profitability was essentially due to lower prices which had gone down by nearly 30 per cent, implying an outright burden of Rs 800 crore on us, said SAIL chairman V.S. Jain. This was followed by a rise in input costs, especially of coking coal, which alone put an additional burden of Rs 1,000 crore during April- December 2005, he added.

 The international market is witnessing an overcapacity situation as China became a net exporter, resulting in pressure on steel prices. However, the market is now stable and is expected that prices of imported coking coal might decline, Singh said. The indicators received and analysed so far do not point at any volatility in steel prices and so chances of rise in steel prices are slim, he added.

 SAILs profit after tax for the first nine months of 2005-06 was Rs 2935 crore compared with Rs 4139 crore in the corresponding period last year. The company, however, improved its average capacity utilisation to the level of 107 per cent from 104 per cent in the last fiscal.

 The public sector behemoth clocked a turnover of Rs 21,330 crore for the April-December period and it reduced its borrowings by Rs 1,240 crore and the interest charges by Rs 98 crore during the period.

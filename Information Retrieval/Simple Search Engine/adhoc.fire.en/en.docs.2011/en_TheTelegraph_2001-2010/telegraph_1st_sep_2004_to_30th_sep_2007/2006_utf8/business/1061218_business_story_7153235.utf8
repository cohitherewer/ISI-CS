 Ministries at odds over textile fund

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Weaving A way

 Mumbai, Dec. 17: The Technology Upgradation Fund Scheme (TUFS) has become a sparring point between the ministries of finance and textiles. The finance ministry is in favour of dismantling the scheme next year, while its textile counterpart is demanding an extension of another three years. 

 TUFS, launched in 1999, provides 5 per cent reimbursement on the interest charged by the identified financial institutions on the modernisation and technological upgradation projects in the textile sector for which loans have been disbursed. The Centre undertakes this reimbursement. 

 The government reviews the functioning of this scheme through a technical advisory-cum-monitoring committee and an inter-ministerial steering committee. 

 A recent evaluation of TUFS submitted by KSA Technopak (India) found that there was an increase in productivity, reduction in cost and improvement in unit value realisation. As on September 30, more than 5,600 applications have been sanctioned, with project costs exceeding Rs 47,000 crore. 

 However, impressive results notwithstanding, indications are that North Block is not in favour of extending the scheme when it expires on March 31, 2007. Reports say even the Prime Ministers Office and the Planning Commission are not in favour of its extension. 

 The finance ministry is more worried about the implications of the subsidy. They cannot keep giving such subsidies to an industry that has progressed over the last couple of years, a source said. 

 Although figures are not available, it is estimated that the scheme results in a burden of Rs 1,500-2,000 crore to the exchequer. 

 Moreover, it is also said that the benefits of the scheme has been felt more in segments where a lot of investments have already taken place, the source added. 

 However, moves to terminate TUFS are being resisted both by the textile industry and the textile ministry.

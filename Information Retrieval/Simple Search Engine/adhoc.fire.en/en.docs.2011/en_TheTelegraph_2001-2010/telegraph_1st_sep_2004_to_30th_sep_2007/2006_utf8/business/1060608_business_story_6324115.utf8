 Great promise for chip parts

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, June 7: The demand for semiconductor components in India will reach $40 billion by 2015, according to Union communications minister Dayanidhi Maran.

 The demand has been fuelled by global electronic majors, who have set up production centres in the country in the last two years. The global demand for semiconductor components is expected to touch $350 billion by then. 

 The demand for semiconductors has forced the government to initiate steps to set up core component supply facilities, Maran said while laying the foundation stone for the $3-billion Fab City project of SemIndia Fab Pvt Ltd here today.

 The semiconductor industry has the potential to provide 9 million jobs, he added.

 SemIndia chairman and CEO Vinod Agarwal said in the first phase of the project a chip assembly and testing plant would come up at an investment of $100 million. The plant, set up by promoters, will be operational within 12 months, he added.

 The second phase will be started by the end of this calendar year at an investment of $1 billion. 

 The third phase will start after two years and the investment will be to the tune of $2 billion.

 We are eagerly waiting for guidelines and policy announcements for the semiconductor industry to fully launch the Fab City project, Agarwal said.

 BOC Gasses Pte Ltd and SemIndia Inc have signed a letter of intent. Under the agreement, BOC will invest Rs 120 crore to provide industrial and electronic gases and chemicals for SemIndias advanced manufacturing business units.

 BOC managing director Sanjiv Lamba said it would also set up a gas manufacturing plant in Hyderabad at an investment of Rs 40 crore to provide gases and vacuum products and services to Fab City.

 BOC is not picking up any equity in SemIndia Fab Pvt Ltd. It is only investing in the infrastructure to supply gas to the Fab City project.

 We will invest towards setting up efficient delivery models for Fab units in the SemIndia Fab complex, Lamba said.

 After AMD and Flextronics, BOC Gases is the third global company to enter into strategic alliance with SemIndia in the project.

 Maran said the Tamil Nadu government lost the Fab City project as the then AIADMK government did not show adequate interest.

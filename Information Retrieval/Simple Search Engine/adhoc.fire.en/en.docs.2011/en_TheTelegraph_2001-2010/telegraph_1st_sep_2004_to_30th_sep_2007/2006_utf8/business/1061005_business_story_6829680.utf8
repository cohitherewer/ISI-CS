 Jindal Stainless eyes mill abroad

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 Steel will

 New Delhi, Oct. 4: Jindal Stainless Steel is in the fray to acquire a cold rolling mill in Southeast Asia. 

 The company is holding preliminary talks to buy a 6-lakh tonne facility in the Thailand-Malaysia region, sources said. 

 Jindal Stainless already has a foothold in the Southeast Asian market where it had bought, some time back, another stainless steel cold rolling plant in Indonesia from Maspion Stainless Steel. 

 The company had bought the Indonesia plant, having a capacity of 50,000 tonnes per annum, for around $30-35 million.

 If the Jindals buy the plant, it will be the second-largest Indian acquisition in steel in Southeast Asia after the takeover by the Tatas of Singapores Natsteel. Analysts estimated that the Jindals will have to fork out around Rs 500 crore for the 6-lakh-tonne plant.

 Before zeroing in on Southeast Asia, sources said the Jindals were weighing options in East Europe.

 Meanwhile, to raise funds for its proposed Rs 2,200-crore steel plant in Orissa, the promoters of Jindal Stainless Ratan Jindal and Jindal Overseas Holding have informed the BSE of plans to increase their stake in the company by 8.39 per cent to 48.7 per cent from 40.31 per cent over a period of 18 months.

 The company will make a preferential allotment of 21.5 million equity warrants to the promoter group, subject to the approval of the shareholders at the extraordinary general meeting of the company scheduled on October 20.

 The allotment will enable the company to have a debt-equity ratio that will make it eligible for loans from a SBI-led consortia.

 Jindal Stainless has a 4-lakh-tonne stainless steel facility at Hissar in Haryana. It plans to invest up to Rs 1,800 crore in this financial year itself in expanding the Haryana facility and commencing work in Orissa. 

 The company will invest 25 per cent of the money in Haryana and the rest in Orissa where the company proposes to make hot rolled stainless steel of 1.6 mt capacity at a cost of Rs 2,200 crore. The Orissa greenfield project includes a ferro chrome unit, coke oven plant and a captive power plant.

 JSPL plans

 The construction of the proposed 6-million-tonne per annum mega steel plant by Jindal Steel and Power Ltd (JSPL) in Orissa will begin next year after the land allotted for it is acquired within the next six months.

 We are very satisfied with the progress of the project. The Orissa government as well as the local population have been supportive to us. We hope to start construction next year, JSPL executive vice- president and managing director Naveen Jindal told reporters in Bhubaneswar.

 Jindal was in Orissa to follow up the companys proposed integrated steel and power project to be set up at an estimated investment of Rs 15,000 crore. The company had signed a memorandum of understanding with the Orissa government in November last year and sought 5,750 acres near Angul.

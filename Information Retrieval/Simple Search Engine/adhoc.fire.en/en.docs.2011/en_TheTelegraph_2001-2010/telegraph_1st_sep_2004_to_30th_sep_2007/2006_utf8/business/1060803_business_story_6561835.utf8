 Calcutta, Aug. 2: The Engineering Export Promotion Council (EEPC) has set an export target of $23 billion for this fiscal.

 The amount could go up by another $1 billion if the existing 292 miscellaneous items are brought under the engineering fold from this fiscal, as promised by the Directorate General of Commercial Intelligence and Statistics (DGCI amp;S).

 Last fiscal, exports of engineering items stood at $19.18 billion, excluding the $700-million which could have come from these miscellaneous items.

 The first quarter of this year has registered a 20 per cent growth over last year at $5.5-$6 billion. In April, we clocked about $2 billion in exports, which is a growth of 35.6 per cent over last fiscal. Our exports are in line with the $125-billion target for overall merchandise exports, and the first quarter is an indication that we are heading in the right direction, said EEPC chairman Rakesh Shah.

 The target, which is 20 per cent more than last year, will enable engineering items to maintain 18 to 19 per cent share in the countrys exports basket.

 Exports of engineering services last fiscal are estimated at around Rs 1,280 crore ($289 million), a growth of 16 per cent over 2004-05.

 However, an area of concern is the prevalence of incorrect and distorted data with a difference of 60 per cent between data from export organisations and the DGCI amp;S. 

 The EEPC has conducted seminars and recommended training of clearing house agents as well as an appraisal of their performance by the customs authority, especially under the EDI mechanism.

 For the first time, the domestic engineering industry will be showcased in New Delhi, called the India Engineering Meet, from January 22 to 25. During the meet, a buyers and sellers meet will be organised where 450 international buyers are likely to participate.

 We are expecting three delegations from Mexico, Germany and Egypt over and above this attendance, Shah added.

 The Indian engineering industry will be showcased abroad in Egypt this year, from November 23 to 26.

 The council said in order to improve exports, issues like service tax on inland haulage when sea and airfreight are excluded should be resolved.

 Other issues include the need for greater inter ministerial and departmental co-ordination, VAT refund on lines of what is being done in Punjab, the absence of a raw material policy and levy of service tax on export promotion councils.

 It has also sought clarity from the ministry of external affairs on the provision that all foreign delegations need approval from the ministry.

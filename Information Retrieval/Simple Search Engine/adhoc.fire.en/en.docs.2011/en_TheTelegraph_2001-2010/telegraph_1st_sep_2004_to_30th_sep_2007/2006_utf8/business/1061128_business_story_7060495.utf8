 Airline merger on long-haul flight

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Nov. 27: The group of ministers, led by external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee, today decided to refer all the issues relating to the merger of Air-India with domestic public sector airline Indian to a committee of secretaries chaired by the cabinet secretary.

 The secretaries will discuss all aspects of the merger and report back to the group of ministers. 

 The civil aviation ministry wants to merge the two airlines into a single carrier with a fleet strength of about 130. The aim is to consolidate the assets of the national carriers through the merger.

 Civil aviation minister Praful Patel said, It is an absolutely logical proposal to consolidate and optimise the use of the assets of the two public sector sector airlines.

 Patel expects cabinet nod for the merger to come in this fiscal itself. The airlines are now trying to attain synergies in their operations.

 The merger proposal is significant in the context of a consolidation wave in the global aviation industry. Big ticket mergers include that of KLM and Air France and Lufthansa and Swissair.

 The merger will also help the combined entity take on major global players like Singapore Airlines and Emirates.

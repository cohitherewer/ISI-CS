The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Writer pens Rs 500-cr growth plan

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 17: Writer Corporation, the information management and logistics firm, will invest Rs 500 crore during the next five years to fund its expansion plans, including a foray into the lifestyle business through Wellness Resorts. It is also planning to acquire a Southeast Asian company with a pan Asian as well as a global footprint.

 Writer is a debt-free company and expects to close the current fiscal with a turnover of Rs 150 crore, which the company expects would go up to Rs 450-500 crore in the next five years. The earnings before income depreciation, tax and amortisation is also likely to go up from Rs 45 crore to Rs 150 crore during the period. 

 The funds will be mainly generated through internal accruals and partially borrowed from banks, said Yazdi Desai, director, Writer Corporation.

 It will invest Rs 150 crore towards relocations, logistics, information and cash management. Of this, Rs 25 crore will be spent in the next 3-5 years for the new facility in Calcutta. Writer is looking for a 4-5 acre plot in the city, which will house a facility of 250,000 boxes. The organised market for information storage and management in India, which includes storage of documents in various formats, outsourced especially by private banks, is worth one-million boxes with each having an area of 2.68 cubic feet, Desai said. 

 The value of the organised market is Rs 40-50 crore, which is only 5 per cent of the potential of the market, he added. 

 The market is expected to grow exponentially when public sector banks like State Bank of India outsource their document storage completely. Writer is currently talking to State Bank. 

 Cash management is another area where Writer is focussing. It is a business of transferring cash to various ATMs of private banks. Currently, Writer moves cash worth Rs 50-100 crore per day across the country at ATMs of its private bank clients.

 In Bengal, the company is talking to Calcutta Port Trust, private sector banks and government departments for its information management business. 

 The bankers for funding Writers overseas acquisition have been finalised.

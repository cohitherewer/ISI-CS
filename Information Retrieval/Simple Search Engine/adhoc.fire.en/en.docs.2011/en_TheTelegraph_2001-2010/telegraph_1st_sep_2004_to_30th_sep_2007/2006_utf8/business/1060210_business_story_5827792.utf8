 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 9: In a major organisational restructuring of its overseas operations, Coca-Cola has appointed Glenn Jordan as president of the East, South Asia and Pacific Rim group.

 Jordan, currently executive vice-president and director of operations for the Latin America group, will succeed Patrick Siewert. Jordan will also be a member of the companys executive committee. 

 Muhtar Kent, president of Coca-Cola International, the overseas operations arm of the company, said the restructuring is designed to spur growth in the rapidly developing markets of the East, South Asia and Pacific Rim group, while focusing on critical markets in China, Japan, Russia and Europe.

 Siewert will take on a senior consulting role, reporting to Kent, and will focus on significant strategic projects, leveraging his broad-based experience in Asia.

 Jordan has been with the company for 28 years and, most recently, he headed an advisory council chartered by the executive committee, to institutionalise revenue growth management company-wide and create the leadership experience.

 Prior to his current position, Jordan served as president of the South Latin America division, comprising Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Ecuador, Paraguay, Peru and Uruguay, stewarding the territory through a challenging period of economic instability.

 Glenns long and successful career with the Coca-Cola Company gives him the skills, knowledge and commitment to accelerate growth for the Coca-Cola system across this important group, said Kent.

 Three divisions of the North Asia, Eurasia amp; Middle East group ? China, Japan, Eurasia and West Asia ? will continue to report directly to Kent. The China and Japan divisions will continue to be led by Paul Etchells and Masahiko Uotani, respectively.

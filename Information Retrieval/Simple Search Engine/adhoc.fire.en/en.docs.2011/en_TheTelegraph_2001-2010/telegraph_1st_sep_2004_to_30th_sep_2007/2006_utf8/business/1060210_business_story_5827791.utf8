 Mumbai, Feb. 9: Tata Motors will develop new platforms to make buses for emerging countries by leveraging its presence in South Korea and Spain and its existing setup in India.

 The firm had acquired Daewoo Commercial Vehicles Company, Koreas second largest truck maker, in 2004. Subsequently, it had acquired a 21 per cent stake in Hispano Carrocera, a reputed Spanish bus and coach manufacturer, with an option to acquire the remaining stake as well.

 Even as 16 per cent of the consolidated revenue during the nine-month period ended December 31 was raked in by the companys international business, Tata Motors now wants to go a step further from merely selling vehicles in these countries.

 Tata Motors managing director Ravi Kant said the company is looking at new platforms for buses through a collaborative effort among its Indian, South Korean and Spanish operations. While these buses can be sold in different countries, they can cater to different segments as well.

 Meanwhile, the company has unveiled better-than-expected results for the third quarter of the year ended December 31.

 Kant said the Spanish operations would enable the company to venture into North Africa as Hispano has won an order to revamp the entire transport system of Casablanca. It is also expanding its bus and coach manufacturing capacity in Morocco.

 During the nine-month period ended December 31, the total exports of Tata Motors grew 81 per cent. Exports to Turkey, South Africa, South Asia and parts of Europe mainly contributed to the growth.

 Tata Motors has posted a 45.55 per cent rise in net profit for the third quarter of the year ended December 31. Net profit shot up to Rs 460.23 crore against Rs 316.21 crore in the corresponding period last year.

 Revenues grew 16.31 per cent to Rs 5,074.55 crore from Rs 4,362.82 crore in the same period last year.

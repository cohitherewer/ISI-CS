 Monster founder quits as chief executive

 McKelvey: Exit mode

 Chicago, Oct. 10 (Reuters): Monster Worldwide Inc. founder Andrew McKelvey resigned on Monday as chairman and chief executive, saying he could no longer dedicate the number of hours required for the companys review of its stock options grants.

 The parent of Monster.com, a web site for job seekers, said president and chief operating officer William Pastore, 58, was promoted to CEO and named to the board, effective immediately.

 Investors were encouraged by the news, sending shares up as much as 2 per cent.

 Monster earns revenue from the placement of job postings on its web sites, access to its resume databases and other career-related services. It also earns fees from advertising.

 Citigroup analyst Mark Mahaney pointed to Pastores tenure with the company and operational background, including his role in helping Monsters European business become profitable.

 Mahaney added in a research note that Monster also may have a more disciplined acquisition strategy under Pastore, and the change may help put the options review behind the company.

 Paul Foster, options strategist at web financial-information site flyonthewall.com in Chicago agreed: This brings positive perceptions resulting in new long-term investors having buying interest in the stock. quot;

 McKelvey, 71, the companys largest individual shareholder, was elected chairman emeritus and will remain on the board.

 Ryan Beck amp; Co. analyst James Janesky said Pastore has been handling the day-to-day operations for some time. Any near-term pressure on the stock due to the options review and CEO change would not alter his quot;market perform quot; rating or a $40 price target for the stock.

 quot;While the news of a CEO resignation is always disconcerting, especially during Monsters current stock option investigation, we believe that the transition to the new CEO will be seamless, Janesky said in a research note.

 In July, Monster said it might restate financial results for the year ended December 31, 2005 and prior years to record additional non-cash charges for stock-based compensation expenses relating to various stock option grants.

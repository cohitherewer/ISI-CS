 Hurdles to Tata Metaliks steel plant 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 19: Tata Metaliks is yet to get land for its proposed 0.5-million-tonne steel plant in Bengal. 

 Tata Metaliks had announced its intention to diversify in February 2005 at Kharagpur in the presence of chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and industry minister Nirupam Sen.

 The company had asked for 300 acres, even though it had initially hinted at a requirement of 500 acres.

 West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation (WBIDC) was entrusted with the job of acquiring the land and handing it over to the company. 

 Till now, WBIDC has managed to acquire only 60 acres.

 As a result, the company has not begun work though it has finalised the project. However, the management is yet to take a call if it plans to relocate.

 The state government is actively working on this. It is indeed difficult to acquire land, T. Mukherjee, chairman of Tata Metaliks, said.

 After announcing its annual result for 2005-06, he said a 0.5-million-tonne billet caster plant and a blast furnace would come up in Kharagpur.

 Subsequently, the company will supply to Tata Steels recent overseas acquisitions NatSteel and Millennium Steel as feedstock.

 This integration will reduce the cost of production in those units, Mukherjee said.

 However, he did not spell out the investment. No estimate can be made unless we get the land, he added. 

 Tata Metaliks has been making advance payment for the land WBIDC procures. Owners are getting Rs 3 lakh per acre for this single-crop land. State government sources indicated that acquisition would step up after the polls.

 Meanwhile, the company has crossed Rs 500-crore turnover for the first time.

 However, increase in raw material prices and a lowering of pig iron rates have eroded its profitability. It has posted a net profit of Rs 45.91 crore in 2005-06 compared with Rs 64 crore in the previous year. During the same time, turnover has grown by 62 per cent.

 The board has declared a 60 per cent dividend for 2005-06.

 Calcutta, Jan. 6: In a bid to bring IT closer to the people, hardware firm Hewlett-Packard (HP) is recasting its marketing strategy in India.

 With hundreds of malls to dot the retail space in the near future, the company plans to strengthen its presence in malls.

 At present, HP has 200 shops in the country. It intends to set up new shops in malls as well as transfer some of the existing ones there.

 The company has opened five shops in malls, one being in Calcutta.

 In the future, it will concentrate in malls and high-traffic areas, as HP believes that stand-alone shops will have the challenge to attract consumers.

 So far, 30 per cent of HP?s sales are coming from such retail outlets.

 ?Retail is mandatory for making IT products survive in India. It needs to be a part of the shopping experience to make it grow,? said V. Krishnan, general manager (consumer sales) at HP.

 The company believes that personal computers (PCs), printers, scanners, laptops should be put in the same category with consumer electronics and durables to reach more homes.

 Given the rapid penetration of television and mobile phones in the country, PCs have lagged behind in India, although sales were growing at a scorching pace of 35-40 per cent.

 The consumer psyche, while buying IT products, is entirely different from buying other consumer durables.

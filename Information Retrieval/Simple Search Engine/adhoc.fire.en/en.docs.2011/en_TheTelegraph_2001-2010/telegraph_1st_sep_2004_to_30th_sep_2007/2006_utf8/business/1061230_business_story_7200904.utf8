The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Tea fund set to enliven gardens

 S.P.S. PANNU 

 Heady brew

 New Delhi, Dec 29: The government has cleared the decks to invest Rs 4,761 crore in replanting and rejuvenating old tea gardens over the next 15 years.

 It has allocated 74 per cent, or Rs 3,523 crore, of this sum to Assam and Bengal.

 Minister of state for commerce Jairam Ramesh told The Telegraph that the share of Bengal would be Rs 1,333 crore and Assam, which has a larger acreage under tea, Rs 2,190 crore. The rest will be disbursed among the growers in Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. 

 Ramesh said 25 per cent of the sum would be subsidy by the Centre, another 25 percent matching contribution of growers and the rest long-term loans.

 We will start unrolling this special purpose tea fund (SPTF) from March, 2007. A full-time professional CEO will be appointed to implement the project, he said.

 Ramesh will soon be in Calcutta to discuss the scheme with the Tea Board and start the process of selecting the CEO. SBI Caps has been roped in as consultants. 

 The internal rate of return, taking into consideration the subsidy, is 13.33 per cent for the gardens in Assam and 12.89 per cent in Bengal.

 As a cover against defaults by borrowers, the escrow mechanism commits borrowers to sell tea equivalent to 200 per cent of their annual debt servicing liability through the auctions. 

 Ramesh said the government would borrow from banks and financial institutions at 1 percentage point above the government securities rate and lend the money to growers at 0.5 percentage point over the borrowing rate. 

 Loans will be payable in eight equal instalments from the sixth year of sanction with a moratorium of five years on the payment of principal.

 Ramesh said the loans by banks are of a duration of seven to 10 years, whereas an ailing plantation needs at least a loan of 13 years along with a moratorium of five years on the repayment of principal.

 He said the SPTF would bridge this funding gap to revive the fortunes of the industry, which is labour-intensive and where the workers lack the skill and education to take on alternative occupations.

 He said replanting of bushes would increase six-fold under the scheme, which will also increase the area under replantation every year to 11,359 hectares from 1,789 hectares.

 New Delhi, Jan. 10: Finance minister P. Chidambaram today said some value-added agricultural products could come under the tax net even as farmers demanded a hike in remunerative prices and improvement in irrigation facilities.

 At the customary pre-budget meeting, Chidambaram is understood to have assured agriculturists that this years annual financial exercise would contain adequate measures for the growth of the farm economy.

 We had a good interactive session with the finance minister and discussed many points, Cargill India chairman and managing director Hardeep Singh told newspersons after the meeting.

 Vankata Rao Nadagouda, who is the chairman of the Federation of Oilseeds Co-operative Growers of India, said the finance minister had indicated that certain value-added products could be brought under the tax net.

 On the issue of water scracity, Nadagouda urged the government to formulate an appropriate incentive mechanism that would enable farmers to set up and manage their own tanks. A personal tank is more efficient as an individual farmer can plan his own irrigation needs, he said.

 This could be done through a 50 per cent subsidy from the government, coupled with soft loans from banks. Nadagouda said Chidambaram has assured to look into the demand.

 There was also the need to take appropriate measures to protect the interests of domestic oil seeds farmers. For this, a close monitoring of the import of edible oils into the country was needed.

 Nadagouda suggested that the government should not be averse to imposing a reasonable level of customs duty to provide domestic commodity producers a level playing field.

 Chidambaram is understood to have told the farmers representatives that agriculture would be given very high importance in this years budget. The policy matrix would also include measures for the growth of the food processing sector besides strengthening irrigation and other infrastructural facilities for the rural economy.

 The representatives of the farmers have asked the finance minister to roll out ways and means to ensure that subsidies actually reached the targeted farmers.

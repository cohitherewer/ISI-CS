 Sen: Sops galore

 Calcutta, Jan. 20: The West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation (WBIDC) ?Bengal?s nodal agency to promote industry ? has declared a maiden dividend, underlining the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government?s claim of a resurgence of trade and industry in the state.

 Nirupam Sen, state industry minister, today announced that WBIDC has declared an interim dividend on the basis of its nine-month performance. 

 The operating profit of WBIDC grew 25 per cent at Rs 15.19 crore against Rs 11.03 crore last fiscal.

 ?We believe there will be sufficient surplus for the full financial year,? Sen said.

 It will pay Rs 57.58 lakh as an interim dividend, which is 0.25 per cent of the Rs 230-crore capital of WBIDC.

 ?The dividend payout indicates coming of age for WBIDC,? said Sabyasachi Sen, state industry secretary.

 In the first nine months, sanctions rose from Rs 130.34 crore to Rs 138.04 crore on a like-to-like basis, while disbursements went up from Rs 49.93 crore to Rs 66.09 crore.

 Recovery also grew healthily at Rs 69.71 crore against Rs 50.93 crore in the same period last year.

 Venture capital fund

 WBIDC is looking at setting up a venture capital fund (VCF) in order to provide equity support to start-up firms. The VCF will have a seed capital of about Rs 250-300 crore and it hopes to rope in other financial institutions for this, Sen said. WBIDC has reduced providing equity assistance to firms over the years and step up loan exposure. ?We have not been able to properly assess and evaluate the equity exposure in the past. As a result, some of them went bad,? he said.

 Garments park

 To boost the textile sector, WBIDC is setting up a textile park on an 8.7-acre plot at Beliaghata in the city. It will invest Rs 45 crore for this. In the first phase, 70 units can be accommodated, which will go up to 100 in the second, employing about 8,000 people.

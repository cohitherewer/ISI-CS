 Oil dear, Reliance oil dearer

 New Delhi, June 8: Reliance Industries Ltd has raised the prices of petrol and diesel for the second time in a month following the price hike announced by public sector oil companies on Monday.

 The hike will make petrol and diesel from Reliance outlets dearer by Rs 2.50 per litre compared with its PSU counterparts.

 Admitting that sales of petrol and diesel may take a hit, a Reliance official said the company had no other option as it would have incurred more losses. ?The choice was between keeping prices steady and posting losses or pruning the losses,? he said.

 Unlike the oil PSUs, Reliance cannot take recourse to oil bonds or crude oil at special rates, he added. ?They get crude oil at cheaper rates. However, we have to buy at market rates,? he said.

 Sources said the private sector company would prefer to sell less fuel rather than sell at low prices at a loss. 

 Reliance, however, gives cash discounts to its regular customers. The private sector oil company has a 4 per cent share in the petrol market and 9 per cent in diesel, as its fuels are mostly sold on the highways. Its retail outlets are mainly in Gujarat and the adjoining areas of Maharashtra.

 As Reliance is a private sector company, it is free to fix its own prices unlike the PSUs, which have to wait for government approval. 

 Reliance is also expected to take a small hit on the LPG and kerosene sales to the public sector oil companies as the new formula calls for a switch to trade-parity pricing. Earlier, prices were fixed on an import-parity basis, which included notional shipping costs, port charges and customs duty. While imports will get an 80 per cent weightage, the price will be a little lower as a 20 per cent weight will be given to export prices to arrive at the final price.

 The diesel and petrol prices announced on Monday correspond to a cost of $54.5 per barrel for the Indian basket of crude imports. With the decision to issue bonds of Rs 28,000 crore, lower customs duty and switch to trade-parity pricing, the government has created a sufficient cushion for the state-run oil companies to continue with the current prices till the Indian basket touches $75 per barrel.

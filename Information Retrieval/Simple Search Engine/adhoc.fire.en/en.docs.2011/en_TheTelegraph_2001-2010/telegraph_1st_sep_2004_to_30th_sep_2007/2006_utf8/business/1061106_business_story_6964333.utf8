 Big plans

 Nov. 5: The Tatas have hunkered down for discussions with Bengal government officials on a second big-ticket investment in the state, as the day nears for hand over of land in Singur for their small-car project. 

 Telco Construction Equipment Company (Telcon), the 60:40 joint venture between Tata Motors and Hitachi Construction Machinery Company Ltd, plans to establish a manufacturing plant in Kharagpur at an investment of Rs 275 crore. Tata Motors managing director Ravi Kant said, Work on the project shall commence as per schedule by the end of this year. 

 The state government has confirmed the allotment of land at Kharagpur by the end of this month. After commencement, the plant will be operational within 18 months, said Praveen P Kadle, executive director (finance and corporate affairs), Tata Motors. 

 However, Bengal industry secretary Sabyasachi Sen said the government would hand over the entire land required by Telcon by the end of this year. This project is equally important. We have started work on land acquisition there too, he said.

 The plant will be spread over an area of 60 hectares, with additional facilites for a vendor park, said Kadle. The new plant will generate employment for about 500 people, including both direct and indirect jobs. 

 The Kharagpur plant will manufacture backhoe loaders, midi excavators, off-highway dump trucks, wheel loaders and large mining shovels. 

 As in Singur for the small car project, West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation (WBIDC) will acquire the land and lease it out to Telcon. 

 Meanwhile, Tata Metaliks expansion project which requires 350 acres has been stalled because of difficulty in obtaining land.

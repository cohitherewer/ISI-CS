 Expo stays in slow lane

 New Delhi, Jan. 17: If a feeling of deja vu hung over Pragati Maidan at the Auto Expo 2006 with just a handful of model launches and a small boycott by top makers like Hyundai, GM and DaimlerChrysler, a combination of gals, gameshows, gigs and glitz tried very hard to dissipate the mood.

 Before the expo began last Wednesday, the big buzz was that the carmakers would launch 30 new models this year; yet less than a dozen were showcased at the biennial bash which gives one some idea about the sense of disappointment that the thronging crowds felt.

 The people had come in to gawk at cars, but they only got to goggle at the showgirls in tights and slinky cutaway outfits at the shimmer-and-shake shows laced with pulsating music that Ford, Honda, Tata Motors and TVS put out.

 The gals themselves were soldiering on bravely: a vacant look, a fixed smile, a languorous twirl or an impatient toss of silky hair ? but clearly their heart was not in it. Some were not particularly thrilled about what they were doing, while the others were totally indifferent.

 Louche louts lingered over the lissome lasses draped provocatively over the models: they had done this last time too and before that in 2002.

 Milly, the 24-year old who showcased Fords Mustang GT in a shimmering black dress, said here feet hurt after standing for nearly 10 hours every day. I feel totally frustrated with the way people look at me. Its wiped out all the smile and the enthusiasm from me. While I do plan to go in for modelling, I dont think I will ever participate in any more auto shows.

 Milly, who is pursuing a course in psychology at one of Delhis top colleges, earns anywhere between Rs 8,000 to Rs 10,000 a day. Shruti Sethi, the 19-year old journalism student who wants to participate in the Miss India pageant, said she wanted to become a professional model. She puts it candidly, I know people come here and click me more than the model I am displaying. My job is to model and I do it to the best of my ability. 

 The expo also saw variety of gameshows and contests that drew large crowds.

 But it was the gigs by local bands like the one at Tata Motor and the Volvo pavilions that really set the feet stomping. The Tatas set the stage on fire with a fusion dance in laser lights. 

 Volvo unveiled its models to the sounds of A.R. Rehmans big time hit Maa tujhe salaam.

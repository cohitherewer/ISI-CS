 Private players happy

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 10: The new STD regime announced by BSNL and MTNL today may force private operators into some serious thinking even as they welcomed the initiative as simple and revolutionary.

 Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) director-general T.V. Ramachandran said, The initiative would lead to an explosion in long-distance traffic as it had made STD calls affordable.

 Ramachandran, however, said necessary corrections need to be made in the access deficit charge (ADC) norms. 

 I hope the revenue-share regime for ADC would be introduced before the OneIndia tariffs came into effect on March 1, he said.

 Ramachandran said, OneIndia is a brilliant culmination of an exercise initiated by the minister in May 2005 to demolish entry barriers for long-distance calls within the country.

 Starting with the integration of the four states of Maharashtra, Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh, going on to lowering the NLD entry barrier by over 90 per cent and then finally the introduction of a simple, single STD rate all across the country, IndiaOne will make death of distance a reality.

 Echoing the same sentiments, secretary general of Unified Service Providers S.C. Khanna said, The plan would be popular and have many takers. It would help achieve the target of 250 million phones as set by the government by December 2007.

 Idea Cellular CEO Vikram Mehmi echoed similar views. We have always supported the initiative of the governments OneIndia plan. We are happy that it has become a reality. However, we are awaiting the removal of floor rates of carriage charge to pass on the benefits to the customers, Mehmi said.

 Both BSNL and MTNL said there would be no revenue loss and the tariffs complied with interconnect usage and access deficit charges as prescribed by Trai, the telecom regulator. 

 Under the existing interconnect usage charge (IUC) regime, an operator has to pay 30 paise each for origination and termination as ADC and up to Rs 1.10 towards carriage charge (depending on the distance).

 An executive of a private telecom operator said under the existing ADC and IUC regimes, STD call rates cannot be lowered below Rs 1.85 for a distance between 200-500 km and Rs 2 a minute for calls beyond 500 km. 

 But most operators believe a new ADC and revenue-share regime would be announced soon by Trai.

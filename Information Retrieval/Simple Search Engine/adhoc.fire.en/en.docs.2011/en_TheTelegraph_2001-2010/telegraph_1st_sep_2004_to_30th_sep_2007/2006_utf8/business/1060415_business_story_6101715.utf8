 Pai prefers to make way for junior

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Pai: More room

 Mumbai, April 14: When NR Narayana Murthy handed over the baton to managing director Nandan Nilekani back in 2002, he signalled both a change of guard and a change of mindset where people do not cling to positions of power and have the grace to make way for younger talent.

 On Friday, this was evident once again when TV Mohandas Pai, member of the Infosys board and chief financial officer (CFO), stepped aside in favour of V. Balakrishnan, senior vice president-finance and company secretary.

 It was in March 2002 that Nandan M. Nilekani was appointed chief executive officer of the IT services company. This came after Murthy relinquished the CEOs post to become chief mentor of Infosys. There is the famous episode of how another founding member ? S Gopalakrishnan ? declined the post in favour of Nilekani. Prior to assuming his current position, Nilekani, who is one of the founders of Infosys, held the post of managing director, president and chief operating officer.

 Infosys today announced that Pai would continue to be a member of the board and will be responsible for human resources development (HRD), education amp; research (E amp;R), and administration.

 Commenting on the appointment, Murthy said, Mohan, one of the finest finance professionals of the country, has been responsible for several pioneering initiatives in finance at Infosys, including the Nasdaq listings. He has led his team in setting new standards in financial reporting, corporate governance and compliance. 

 A multi-faceted personality and a top performer, he has created and managed a high- quality financial model underpinning our growth. In keeping with his belief that younger people should get strategic opportunities early enough to shape this company, he has voluntarily given up his CFO position. 

 As we continue to scale up, the major challenges for Infosys will be in the HRD and E amp;R areas. I am glad we have Mohan handling these critical functions. 

 I welcome our new chief financial officer , Balakrishnan, another extraordinary finance professional, who has been part of Mohans team for many years. With his high intellect, passion and accomplishments, he is the right person to take over from Mohan. quot;

 An interesting highlight of todays change is that unlike in the past where one of the youngest founders was appointed to the board, this time a professional now figures in the management reshuffle.

 FII whispers rock sensex

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, April 7: The sensex see-sawed by over 365 points as panic gripped an overheated market after a brushfire of rumours that the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) had suspended 11 foreign institutional investors. It was the second-largest intra day swing since May 18, 2004 when the UPA government stormed to power.

 After starting on a high note, the BSE sensitive index rose to an all-time high of 11930.66, but later crumpled under huge selling pressure to the days low of 11564.99. It ended with a loss of 157.46 points or 1.3 per cent to settle at 11589.44, while the S amp;P CNX Nifty plunged 56.10 points or 1.6 per cent to settle at 3454.80. 

 Sebi denied the rumours that it barred some foreign institutional investors and the regulator sought details about the days trading pattern from the stock exchanges to examine the sharp gyrations. 

 quot;The markets started on a high note after Infosys announced that its board would meet on April 14 to consider a bonus issue. However, the knee jerk reaction came after reports swirled that Sebi had barred 11 FIIs from the market. Since the markets are at such high levels and a correction has been pending for some time, people reacted to the news sharply and started getting out, quot; said V. K. Sharma of Anagram Stock Broking.

 Market players said todays upheaval was a panic reaction and the market needed the correction after a strong rally of 467 points or 4.14 per cent in the first three days of the week. 

 Whenever markets open on a high note, but fall sharply during the intra day session, the technical charts get spoilt, which prompt many investors to go to the sidelines. Till we hit the psychological mark of 12000, we might see investors staying away from the markets, quot; Sharma added. 

 Banking, FMCG, pharmaceutical, automobile and oil stocks stumbled during the day. However, the market breadth was positive with 1052 shares reporting advances even though 1461 others declined and 43 shares remained unchanged. The turnover at Rs 6,633 crore was higher than Wednesdays Rs 4,808 crore.

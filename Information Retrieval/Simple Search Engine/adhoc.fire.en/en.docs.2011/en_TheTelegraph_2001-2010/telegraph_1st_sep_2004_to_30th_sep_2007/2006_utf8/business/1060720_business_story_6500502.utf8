 Calcutta, July 19: Ashok Leyland, the Hinduja Group flagship, today announced its first overseas acquisition. The company will set foot in the European Union by acquiring the truck business unit of Czech based AVIA a.s., part of the Odien Group Company.

 We are in the process of acquiring the truck business of AVIA a.s., which specialises in light and medium commercial vehicles between six and 12 tonnes. The formalities will be over in the next couple of months and before that I cannot comment on the size of the deal, said R. Seshasayee, managing director, Ashok Leyland.

 Ashok Leyland has floated a special purpose vehicle (SPV) to conduct the transaction, which will be completed by the end of August. The SPV will be wholly owned by Ashok Leyland and it will be a shell company. The deal will be in cash.

 The acquisition is in line with Ashok Leylands inorganic growth policy and will give it a foothold in eastern Europe. It will also significantly improve Ashok Leylands exports. The company currently exports 6,000 units of medium-to-heavy commercial vehicles per annum.

 The company has a presence in Sri Lanka and Egypt.

 Seshasayee said the acquisition would open markets in Turkey, Iran, Russia, South Africa, West Asia and east Europe. The strategic location of the Czech firm opens up possibilities of using its facilities as an assembly and marketing base for some of Leylands future products.

 The company plans to introduce AVIAs products in India at a later date.

 The AVIA range of products includes the state-of-the-art, Euro III and IV compliant trucks and the Indian market is not yet ready for these. We would introduce their products in a phased manner, Seshasayee said.

 AVIA manufactures D line trucks in the 6T, 7.5T and 9T range. In June, it introduced 12T (D120), 11T (D110) and 10T(D100) models and markets it to countries like Hungary, the UK, Ireland, Italy, Slovakia and Spain with an annual production capacity of 20,000 vehicles.

 The company had fallen in bad times when Daewoo Motor Corporation went bankrupt in 2000. Daewoo had acquired a 50.2 per cent stake in AVIA in 1995. 

 However, after AVIA was taken over by SGM International in 2005, an aggressive restructuring and investment programme brought it back on track and expanded its product range to 12 tonnes.

 SGM International is a subsidiary of Odien Capital Partners L.P.

 The acquisition, which will expand Leylands portfolio, is expected to generate returns in 2-3 years.

 The planned scale-up of AVIAs operations will absorb the current strength of 275 employees and also induct new Ashok Leyland products in AVIAs portfolio.

 Ashok Leyland plans to ramp up its existing capacity of 78,000 trucks per annum to 100,000 by next year.

 The company is likely to scout for new locations to expand the capacity beyond its six units ? one in Ennore near Chennai, two in Hosur and one each in Alwar and Bhandara.

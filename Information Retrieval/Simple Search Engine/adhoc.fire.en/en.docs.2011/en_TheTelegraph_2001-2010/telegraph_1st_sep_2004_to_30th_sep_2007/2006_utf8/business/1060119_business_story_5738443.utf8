 Reliance wireless liable to pay ADC

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 18: The Telecom Dispute Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) has ruled that fixed wireless phone services offered by Reliance Infocomm was similar to mobile services and, therefore, liable to pay the access deficit charge.

 According to TDSAT, there is hardly any difference between the service provided by the petitioner in petition 45 (C) of 2005 (filed by Tata Teleservices Ltd and Maharashtra Teleservices Ltd against BSNL) and the present petitioner (Reliance Infocomm).

 The findings of the tribunal recorded previously will also hold good regarding contentions raised in this petition and, since the matter is already subjudice before the Supreme Court, we do not think it necessary to enter into an investigation beyond what is stated herein, TDSAT chairman Justice Santosh Hegde said. The tribunal has ruled,Since it is held that the instrument supplied by the petitioner (Reliance Infocomm) is also capable of being used outside the premises and the choice of use is left to the subscriber, it loses its categorisation as a fixed-line phone.

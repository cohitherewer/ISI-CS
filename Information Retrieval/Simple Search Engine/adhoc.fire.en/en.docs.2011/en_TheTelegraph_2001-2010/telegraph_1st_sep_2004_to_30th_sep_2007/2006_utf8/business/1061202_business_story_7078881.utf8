 Bharti defends retail deal

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 1: The Bharti group today said its tie-up with Wal-Mart meets all foreign direct investment guidelines and the US giant will only handle back-end operations. 

 Bharti will manage the front-end 100 per cent, while Wal-Mart will provide support at the back-end, logistics and supply chain. The deal is according to the (government) guidelines, Bharti Enterprises joint managing director Rajan Bharti Mittal said on the sidelines of a Ficci function here.

 Mittals remark comes in the wake of objections raised by the Left parties against the proposed entry of the US retail behemoth. Bowing to the Left pressure, commerce minister Kamal Nath promised to check out whether the proposed joint venture conforms to the existing FDI rules. 

 Asked if the deal provided a backdoor entry for Wal-Mart in the Indian retail market, he said it was not the case and Wal-Mart would do the same as other global retailers like Germanys Metro Cash amp; Carry was doing in the country.

 Mittal, however, declined to comment on the reaction of the Left parties to the Bharti-Wal-Mart deal.

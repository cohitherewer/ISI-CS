 Grip of yellow fever

 Gold is a safe investment but returns have been low. Srikumar Bondyopadhyay explains why it has India in thrall

 Kalyan Mukherjee, a resident of Jamalpur village in Burdwan district, 100 kilometres from Calcutta, worries only about two things in life: his crop and capital.

 Whenever he reaps a good harvest and generates a large surplus, he buys land. When the surplus is small, he buys gold.

 There are few post offices and fewer bank branches offering small savings schemes, such as PPF, in seven neighbouring villages with a total population of a little over 18,000. 

 But farmers and farm workers in any case prefer buying gold to queuing up at the post office or bank counters for hours together to deposit or withdraw money. 

 With experience, they have learnt that bullion is a perfect hedge against inflation and gold can be sold anytime. Gold for most of these villagers is an asset that is sold as a last resort. 

 Villagers go for bars

 What is more interesting is that most of rural India buys more gold coins and bars than investors in cities. Urban investors mostly buy gold jewellery. 

 A gold coin doesnt create the kind of emotional attachment that jewellery does. So people can buy gold coins today and sell them tomorrow without any misgivings later. 

 Religious connection

 The recognition of gold as an asset class goes back into the past. Indians have a strong religious association with the precious metal. 

 The thirteenth dark night of Ashwin month, popularly known as Dhaantrayodashi or Dhanteras, marks an auspicious day for buying gold and welcoming the goddess of prosperity, Devi Lakshmi. This is the eve of a new Samvat year and the beginning of a harvest season. 

 Gold as asset

 Gold has a cultural and religious thrall over Indian investors who want to hoard the precious metal rather than look upon it as an instrument of portfolio investment such as stocks. 

 Inflation deflator

 However, one should look at gold as part of ones overall investment portfolio for more than one reasons. Inflation entails the greatest erosion to investment. Hence, small investors should particularly provide for some hedge to their investments to ensure a stable return commensurate with their future financial needs. 

 Gold provides a better hedge than other monetary assets. With the existing method of calculation of the rate of inflation, which is basically based on lagged data, and obsession with wholesale price index, the monetary authorities and market regulators often tend to be late in reaching to the impending price spiral.

 Unlike in developed countries, there are no inflation-linked investment instruments (such as inflation protected treasuries in the US or index-linked gilts in the UK or real rate bonds in Canada) in the country. Gold provides the only alternative to protect a fixed-income investment portfolio against inflation. 

 Price point

 Another important finding is that gold prices fared well when stocks went down. 

 But available researches show that gold prices have little correlation with stocks, bonds and other commodities. However, empirical data suggests that the price of gold varies directly with that of crude oil. This means that investors in gold should be well acquainted with international developments. 

 The rise in gold prices since the last three years, the fear of potential inflation fuelled by oil prices and the need to diversify portfolio risks, especially to bonds and shares, and an overall strong economic growth leading to higher disposable income and hence a higher demand for jewellery have pushed up the demand for gold this year in India, said Sanjiv Aggarwal, managing director, WGC India.

 And experts believe this trend will continue for some time because the demand for the metal in the worlds largest gold consuming country will grow following rising per capita income. 

 Exchange trade

 With the commencement of commodity exchanges in India, investment in bullion as part of ones overall asset portfolio has started to pick up. The total volume in gold trade through the Multi-Commodity Exchange rose to over 2,000 kg in October this year from 10 kg in 2002-03. However, most of this remained confined to high net worth individuals.

 Retail role

 Commodity exchanges have also paved the way for retail participation in gold trading by making the minimum contract size 100 gm compared with 1 kg earlier. 

 By paying a margin of just 5 per cent, retail investors can now trade in 100-gm contracts (of gold).

 Pure for sure

 With the private and public sector banks of the country now selling hallmarked gold coins and bars in weights beginning from 2 grams to 100 grams, the fear of buying adulterated gold coins and bars is also gone. Commercial banks are selling gold coins and bars in tamper-proof packs along with purity certification. 

 However, banks dont buy back the gold coins and bars. You will have to approach a jeweller if you want to sell your coins and bars.

 Besides, the purchase price of gold coins and bars from banks is higher than the market rate. 

 This is because the gold that banks sell to you is imported and the import duty is passed on to customers. 

 Banks also add value-added tax and a profit margin to arrive at the sale price. But you get the guarantee of purity. 

 Buying gold from banks is also safer than buying it from anywhere else.

 Indian hotels let out brand tag

 Mumbai, April 23: In line with the global trend, the domestic hotel industry is increasingly moving towards management contracts rather than building assets. Globally, Starwood Hotels and Hilton Hotels have been more oriented towards management contracts. The trend seems to have touched the Indian shores too.

 Getting into a management contract helps us because this way we are able to participate in the development of the property without having any equity involvement, Raymond Bickson, managing director of Indian Hotels Co Ltd, had said recently.

 Most hotel chains in India are looking at expanding within the country as well as overseas. But they require huge investments for this.

 With real estate prices going through the roof and an all-time high investment cost, a management contract is the easiest way out.

 A number of Indian players are looking at management contracts as a way to grow. These include groups like ITC, Taj and Oberoi to name a few, said an analyst with a leading brokerage firm in Mumbai. 

 To set up a five-star property, it costs around Rs 1.5 crore per room on an average, excluding the land cost. Add another Rs 50 lakh to this for infrastructure and maintenance. Total construction time can go up to two to two-and-half-years. Add to this an average of four to five years in metros and seven to eight years in non-metros as a breakeven period.

 The total cost and the break-even period are too long. Going in for a management contract thus makes more sense, the analyst said. 

 A management contract gives hotel chains an opportunity to spread their wings without actually taking on the risk of equity participation. They can just participate in managing the hotel for a fee or on a profit sharing basis, depending on the arrangement with the group. This lowers the risk of actually owning and running the property, said another analyst. 

 Leela Kempinski has recently entered into management contracts for its Gurgaon-based property. LeelaVenture Ltd has signed an operations and management ( amp;M) agreement with Ambience Infrastructure Pvt Ltd to manage the 319-room property.

 The Delhi operations will be managed by us, but we dont own the property, Peter Leitgeb, president, Leela Kempinski, had said recently. 

 Under an amp;M plan, Leela will sign a 10-year contract with the owner of the hotel to operate and manage it for a fee.

 Similarly, Indian Hotels has entered into a 10-year management contract with Dubai-based property developer ETA Star for a luxury hotel and residential apartment complex in Dubai.

 Tesco beats forecast

 Firm grip

 London, Oct. 3 (Reuters): Tesco topped analysts average forecast with a 12.5 per cent rise in underlying first-half profit on Tuesday and said its plans to expand in non-food business and the United States were on track. 

 Chief executive Terry Leahy said improved service and ranges in its nearly 1,900 British stores helped account for the record profits, alongside 30 per cent growth in its organic food sales and a 12.6 per cent rise in non-food revenues.

 Clothing and electronics sales surged 19 per cent and 36 per cent respectively, Leahy said. Because of that, we have been able to attract more customers and they have spent more, he said in a telephone interview. Internationally, it continues its rapid development with sales of almost 18 per cent at constant currency rates and a strong profit performance as well. The countrys biggest supermarket group said underlying profit before tax was 1.15 billion in the 26 weeks to August 26. 

 The average forecast of analysts in a Reuters poll was 1.122 billion, within a range of 1.06 billion to 1.15 billion. 

 Sales including VAT (value added tax) were up 12.7 per cent at 22.7 billion. Excluding VAT they were up 12.6 per cent at 20.7 billion. 

 Analysts at brokerage Numis said Tescos sales in Britain and internationally were strong. 

 The performance in the UK was very strong ... the second quarter number was boosted by the hot summer and the World Cup, so we could not expect this rate of growth to be maintained into the second half, Numis said in a note. Core UK sales were up 10.2 per cent, international sales were up 21.3 per cent and tesco.com sales were up 28.7 per cent.

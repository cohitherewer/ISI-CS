 Russian bank buys stake in EADS

 Munich, Sept. 11 (Reuters): A Russian state bank has bought a 5 per cent stake in European aerospace and defence giant EADS. 

 A spokesman for EADS, one of Europes biggest flagship companies, said Russian state bank Vneshtorgbank (VTB), the former Soviet foreign trade bank, had bought 5.02 per cent in EADS. 

 A Russian newspaper had already reported at the end of August VTBs purchase, on which EADS and the Russian bank had then declined to comment.

 The report had lifted EADS shares and sent tremors round financial markets as analysts weighed the uncertain political impact against potential business wins for EADS in Russia. 

 The EADS spokesman said VTBs move would not affect the structure of core French and German shareholders controlling the firm, the worlds second-largest aerospace group after US rival Boeing. 

 EADS, the leading European aerospace group, is run along careful power-sharing lines enshrined in a shareholder pact between the founding industrial partners and the French state.

 The spokesman said VTB was one among several shareholders owning a similar size of the firms free-float stock. 

 EADS, whose products range from the worlds largest passenger jet, the A380, to combat helicopters and participation in major European fighter and missile programmes, is keen to expand in Russia.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Tea party in South Africa

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Oct. 5: After vitamin and fruit water, its time for some South African Rooibos tea. Tata Tea is all set to lay its hands on the famed African brand. A definitive agreement to acquire a 33 per cent stake in Joekels Tea Packers, South Africas third largest tea company, would give Tata Tea access to Rooibos tea through Joekels Rooibos Laager brand.

 Rooibos is used to make tisane or herbal, caffeine-free and low-in-tannin tea and is indigenous to South Africa. This tea can also heal allergies, asthma and insomnia.

 The acquisition would be funded by Tata Tea subsidiary Tetley.

 This acquisition is yet another development in our plan to grow the Tata Groups tea business around the world. This will pave the way for Tetley in South Africa and some of the neighbouring countries, said Ken Pringle, executive vice-chairman and chief executive officer of the Tetley group and director of Tata Tea.

 Joekels has a 5 per cent market share in South Africa and a turnover of $5 million.

 The South African companys portfolio includes mainstream brands like Phendula Tips and Rooibos Lager. The economy range comprises Tea Time, Tea4kidz, a special blend for children, and a variant of Rooibos iced tea called San Aqua.

 There was an intellectual property rights issue between the US Patent and Trademark Office and South Africas department of trade and industry for Rooibos tea and its extracts, the uses of which are as varied as hair dye and meat tenderiser.

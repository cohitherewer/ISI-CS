 Govt focus on PSU idle cash

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 New Delhi, July 24: The government is concerned over the tendency of public sector units to keep a large portion of their reserves in idle financial investments instead of utilising them for expansion.

 Top officials estimate that PSUs are sitting on Rs 1,50,000 crore of savings and have plans to invest just a third of this huge sum.

 Last year, the government had forced PSUs without any investment plans to cough up money through special dividends. 

 The intention this time is to have a quiet word in the fourth quarter on a special dividend of about 20-30 per cent, if there are no expansion plans till then to utilise the reserves.

 The PSUs may also be asked to issue bonus shares, the officials added.

 Last year, the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation paid a record dividend of 250 per cent to the government, aggregating Rs 3,568 crore. Bhel too had declared an all-time high interim equity dividend of 40 per cent for fiscal 2005-06.

 The aim is not to milk PSUs but to see to it that they do not grow complacent with profits. Especially as in some cases it comes because of their near monopoly status, officials said. 

 The governments strategy is to nudge PSUs to come out with concrete plans for expansion. 

 However, a section of the government is also toying with the idea of letting PSUs invest in each other through limited issues. 

 Worried by the bear phase on the bourses, the government has already put on hold a number of PSU public offers. Large initial public offerings like those of Indian Airlines and Air-India as well as that of State Bank of Hyderabad and Rural Electrification Corporation have been pushed back.

 If the policy of cross-holdings gets the nod, PSUs keen on public offers can access funds without sucking out too much money from financial institutions and banks who can invest in other productive areas.

 In all, the PSUs are expected to pick up some Rs 5,000-6,000 crore through their offerings this year.

 The finance ministry feels large PSU offerings crowd out other issues. 

 Though PSU public offers lend depth to the market and bring in small investors, there is a need to see that others do not lose out in the process.

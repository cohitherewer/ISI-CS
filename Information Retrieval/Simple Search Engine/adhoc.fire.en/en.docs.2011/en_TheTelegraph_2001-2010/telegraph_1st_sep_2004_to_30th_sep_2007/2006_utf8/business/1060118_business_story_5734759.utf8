The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Boards of non-listed firms to be recast

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 Gupta: Tough stand

 New Delhi, Jan. 17: The draft companies bill, which the cabinet is likely to clear this month, will insist that boards of all non-listed companies, including public sector units, should have at least one third independent directors. 

 Under the current listing norms stipulated by market regulator Sebi, listed companies need to have 50 per cent independent directors. 

 The new move for non-listed companies is likely to be fiercely protested, but it seems the government is firm on seeing it through. 

 The minister of state for company affairs, P.C. Gupta, told The Telegraph that he would be taking the bill to Cabinet this month. ?We will not issue an ordinance, we are in no haste ... we will go through the parliamentary route and take into account suggestions made by MPs.?

 The change in company law on independent directors will be omnibus and cover all corporations but since a higher quota already exists for limited companies ?its impact will really be on non-limited companies, including our own PSUs,? he said. 

 The number of non-listed companies is far more than the number of listed corporations in the country and analysts believe this move will put huge numbers of individuals, who have never before served in similar capacities, on company boards. 

 Gupta, however, said in a country like India with its huge pool of trained manpower, corporate houses should not have trouble in finding qualified, non-partisan persons capable of contributing to running companies. 

 Business chambers and individual business leaders are against the move, claiming that there was a shortage of trained individuals. They argued that there was also the possibility of company secrets being leaked out by outsiders. 

 Gupta, however, made it clear that there would be no dilution of norms. ?We have talked to all stakeholders and we feel this is a good move ... we will of course welcome any debate on any of the clauses in Parliament.? 

 ?The government always follows a model code and PSUs are likely to start implementing the recommendations, including those on independent directors, even before the law is actually passed,? top officials said. 

 The company affairs minister said the DCA was also keeping track of corporate shenanigans within the ambit of the company law.

 TCS to hire more in China

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Chandrasekaran: Red carpet

 Mumbai, June 19: Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) is planning to raise its headcount in China.

 China is one of the two global delivery centres for the company and there are close to 400 people employed there at present.

 ?I should ideally be looking at close to 1,000 people in China,? N. Chandrasekaran, executive vice-president and global head of sales amp; operations, TCS, said here today. 

 Other IT companies like Infosys and Wipro are also planning to raise the number of employees at their Chinese operations.

 TCS is planning to recruit more in the Latin American market. ?For the financial year ended March 31, 2005, we had about 648 people in Latin America. Today, the number stands at 2,532, including the 1,200 people that we absorbed due to the acquisition of Comicrom. In Brazil, we are just under 700 people and will be adding another 800, hoping to be close to 1,500 by December,? he added.

 In November 2005, TCS had acquired Comicrom, the largest BPO firm in Chile, with 1,200 employees and over 100 clients to jumpstart its BPO business in the region.

 The company today said its integrated IT and BPO offerings are gaining in the Latin American market. In 2006-07, TCS acquired two new key customers in the region with a total deal value of over $30 million.

 ?In the BPO space, we expect lot more deals in that region. One of the leading telecom providers in Columbia has engaged TCS recently and we are also expecting a large deal from the ministry of finance in Colombia. We are looking at fairly sizeable double-digit million-dollar deals,? Chandrasekaran said. He, however, refused to spell out how big these deals would be.

 TCS has also secured a five-year contract with a leading banking and financial group to manage the entire back-office operations for the bank?s loan and credit business in Chile.

 On revenues from the Latin America, he said, ?Last fiscal, we closed with revenues of $50 million. We are expecting close to $100 million in revenue from the region this fiscal.?

 He said the deals work under similar margins in the Latin American region as in North America but operational costs are a little higher. Regarding competition in the Latin American market, he said there were a few leading local players present in addition to US-based systems integrators.

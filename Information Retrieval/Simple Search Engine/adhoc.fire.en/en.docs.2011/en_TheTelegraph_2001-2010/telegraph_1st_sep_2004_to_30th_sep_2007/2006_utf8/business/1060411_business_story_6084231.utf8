The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Dunlop Ambattur unit starts rolling

 SAMBIT SAHA 

 Ruia: Aiming high

 Ambattur (Chennai), April 10: A day after the final agreement was signed in Calcutta to reopen the Sahagunj factory, Dunlop?s new owner Pawan Ruia was in Chennai to flag off the maintenance work at the Ambattur unit.

 Ruis is optimistic that the tyre-maker will achieve operational break-even within three months from the start of production. 

 Ruia announced the commencement of work at the factory as hundreds of Dunlop employees gathered at the factory premises to witness a significant moment in their lives. 

 He said initial response from the market was very encouraging and the company would have no problems selling its products when it returns after five years. 

 Both the Chennai and Bengal works are likely to start production by September. ?I am expecting a turnover of Rs 400 crore during this financial year and close to Rs 900-1,000 crore in the next fiscal,? he added. 

 The margins in the regular tyre segment have gone for a tailspin following a phenomenal rise in natural rubber prices. However, Dunlop is hoping to achieve a better profitability thorough a judicious product mix. It will set up an industrial rubber products plant at Ambattur where only truck and bus tyre were produced. 

 The company has an industrial products division at Sahagunj. The unit can also produce a range of tyres. According to preliminary estimates, the new industrial product division at Ambattur would cost Rs 20-25 crore. The new production line would take at least six months to be installed. 

 ?There is a substantial demand for industrial products, which includes a range of industrial belts. So we are planning to set up an industrial products division here,? Ruia said. 

 P.K. Shukla, the newly appointed senior vice-president (marketing) of Dunlop, said this range has a margin of 15-20 per cent. 

 Dunlop has already placed orders for two new boilers at a cost of Rs 4-6 crore each for Ambattur. 

 In Sahagung, the company will look at the OTR (off the road) segment, which gives a margin of 10-12 per cent. 

 In contrast, the tyre industry operates at a 3-4 per cent margin only. The OTR segment is used in the infrastructure sector. Shukla said Dunlop would roll out steel radial tyres by the end of the year. 

 ?We will target the OEM, replacement and export markets,? he added. 

 Ambattur works ? where 277 people are being offered an early retirement scheme ? will be back in business ahead of Sahagunj. The new management led by Ruia is putting in Rs 450 crore as fresh investment and to settle dues. 

 Ruia said Rs 350 crore has been tied up with various banks as loan.

 Rupee hits high note

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Jan. 3: The rupee bounced to a 11-week high of 44.91 against the dollar but gave up some of those gains when a rush for the US unit weighed it down to 45.04.

 Even at the finish, it was four paise stronger than Mondays closing of 45.09. The rally has been fuelled by robust FII inflows into the booming equity markets as well as a dollar weakening against other currencies.

 Rising crude oil prices, however, halted the runaway rise in the value of the rupee towards the close of todays session in the inter-bank forex market.

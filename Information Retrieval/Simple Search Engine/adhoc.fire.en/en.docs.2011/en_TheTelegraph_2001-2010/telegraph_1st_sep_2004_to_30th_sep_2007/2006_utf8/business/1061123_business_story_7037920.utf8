 New Delhi, Nov. 22: Dominos Pizza India Ltd is rolling the dough for expansion and innovation with an investment of Rs 78 crore for 2006-07. The company is set to open five outlets by December this year and add another 35 by the next.

 The pizza company has 125 stores in 30 cities across the country and plans to increase the number to 140 by March 2007. 

 We will open around 20 outlets in tier-I metros such as Calcutta and Delhi and 15 in non-metro cities such as Aurangabad and Mysore by the end of 2007, said Dev Amritesh, marketing chief of Dominos.

 Dominos holds a market share of around 35 per cent of the organised pizza market and is looking at various innovation techniques such as its latest cheese burst pizza to increase growth figures in the coming years. 

 The pizza chain has earmarked a total marketing budget of Rs 28 crore for the next year, of which Rs 6 crore will be invested in promoting the new pizza. 

 The campaign will feature Bollywood star Arshad Warsi, who has been signed on as the companys new brand ambassador. 

 Industry analysts said while the Rs 500-crore domestic pizza industry which comprises MNC chains and big brands grew at an annual rate of 30 per cent, Dominos recorded a 50 per cent growth rate over the last year. 

 We have been consistently outperforming the market, and plan to drive consumption through new product innovations, interesting combo-offers and affordability of products, said Amritesh. Our target is to achieve a 40 per cent market share by the end of 2007.

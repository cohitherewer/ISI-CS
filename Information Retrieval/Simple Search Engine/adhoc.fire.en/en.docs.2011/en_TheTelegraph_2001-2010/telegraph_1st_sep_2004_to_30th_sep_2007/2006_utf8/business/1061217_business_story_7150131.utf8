 India lobbies for strategic oil storage

 Deora: Far-sighted

 Beijing, Dec. 16 (PTI): India today proposed building of strategic storage of oil by Asian countries as a cushion against supply disruptions and a three-tier cooperation mechanism to ensure a sustainable global hydrocarbon economy.

 I am of the opinion that developing Asian countries should seriously consider building strategic storage of oil, minister for petroleum and natural gas, Murli Deora, said at the first meeting of energy ministers of India, China, the US, Japan and South Korea here.

 The prevailing high oil prices make oil inventory-carrying costs prohibitive, particularly for developing countries, he said in his keynote address on Major Challenges and Priorities of International Cooperation. 

 The need for maintaining strategic stocks and judicious inventory management are measures developing countries in Asia must seriously consider, Deora said at the one-day conference organised by Chinas top planning body The National Development Reform Commission (NDRC).

 We recognise that achieving sustained economic growth rates of over 8 per cent in the future calls for commensurate energy availability. Indias dependence on import of oil and gas renders economic progress vulnerable to international oil market developments. Hence, effective management of oil security assumes urgency, Deora said.

 India has plans to construct tankage with a capacity to store 15 million tonnes (mt) of oil in the long term, with five mt of storage capacity expected in the first phase, he said. 

 Inventories are an integral part of the supply chain and provide a cushion to the oil market from the adverse impact of temporary supply disruptions, Deora noted. India has been championing the cause of international cooperation to ensure a sustainable global hydrocarbon economy and has held two very successful round table conferences of Asian producing and consuming countries in New Delhi in January 2005 and November 2005, he said.

 In todays world of energy interdependence, we believe that hydrocarbon producing and consuming nations have shared interests in ensuring stability, security and sustainability of the global hydrocarbon economy, he said.

 While the Beijing round table focuses on the concerns of consuming nations, India believes it is integral to the framework of global producer-consumer dialogue, Deora said.

 A reasonable and affordable price of oil remains a contentious issue and generates considerable debate, he noted.

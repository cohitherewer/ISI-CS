 Mumbai, July 23: Standard Chartered Mutual Fund is believed to be on the block.

 Temasek, ABN Amro and ING Vysya are reportedly in the race to acquire the Rs 9,550-crore assets of the foreign fund house.

 Others in the race include fund houses that have been late entrants into the mutual fund space in India and have assets of less than Rs 5,000 crore.

 Globally, Standard Chartered is not into active funds management and its presence in the business in India is a result of its takeover of Grindlays Bank in the country.

 According to sources, the bank has now adopted a strategy to exit the mutual fund business globally. However, Naval Bir Kumar, managing director of the fund house, refused to comment on the issue.

 It is believed that the fund house will start the valuation process and invite bids within a fortnight. The valuation of a fund asset is based on cash, debt and equity. The balanced fund assets are valued as equity since their income streams are the same as equity funds, said Dhirendra Kumar of Value Research. 

 Normally, if the proportion of debt and liquid assets are higher, the valuation is in the range of 4-5 per cent, while for a higher equity base, it is around 6-7 per cent, Kumar said. Since equity constitutes less than 30 per cent of the total assets of the fund house, the valuation should be around 4.5 per cent, Kumar added .

 The bank has a fund management division globally, which offers institutional liquidity, in dollars, through a money market fund. It also offers structured credit investments managed by Whistlejacket Capital Ltd, an investment vehicle, which issues commercial paper and medium term notes and investment grade sub-debt. 

 The Indian arm operated as a specialised debt fund manager for a substantial time and made a foray into equity assets management in 2005 with the launch of the Classic Equity Fund. The fund has posted a negative return of 7.21 per cent in the last six months. The fund house has also launched the Premier Equity Fund, Imperial Equity Fund and recently Enterprise Equity Fund. Grindlays Super Saver Income Fund (Medium Term), a debt plan, has given returns of 5.74 per cent in the last one year.

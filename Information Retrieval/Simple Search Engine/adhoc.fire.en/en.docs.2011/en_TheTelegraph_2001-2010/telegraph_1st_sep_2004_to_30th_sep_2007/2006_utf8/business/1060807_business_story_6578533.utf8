 North Block, RBI on collision path

 What could be more bizarre than the finance ministry asking public sector banks not to follow the policy of the countrys central bank? Yet, the ministrys diktat to public sector banks to take the approval of their boards before raising interest rates is, in practice, nothing more than an attempt to negate the consequences of the RBI raising its policy rate in the recent credit policy. Its the latest salvo in its attempt to ensure that interest rates dont go up. The FMs antipathy towards higher interest rates is well-known before every credit policy announcement, the finance minister makes it a point to publicly air his views that inflation is well-contained and interest rates are at their optimal levels. Now that the RBI has refused to take the hint and has raised its policy rates, the ministry is trying to ensure that the banks dont follow the RBIs policy. This is weird. What it means is that that the finance ministry is now working directly at cross-purposes with the RBI. So much for the independence of the central bank.

 Finance minister P. Chidambaram has defended his decision by pointing out that the government is the largest shareholder in public sector banks and its views must be heard. The government is now treating the public sector banks like oil companies, where the interests of these companies is being sacrificed, ostensibly in the larger public interest. Small wonder that the BSE bankex took a sharp knock on Friday, Government risk is one reason why the PSU banks trade at such low multiples.

 Why is the finance ministry so paranoid about rising interest rates? Chidambaram is probably worried about a repeat of what happened in the mid-nineties, when rate hikes by the RBI led to a credit crunch and to a significant downturn in the economy. He was the finance minister at that time.

 But arent things different now? There isnt any Asian crisis, companies have not gone overboard in setting up new capacities and corporate finances are much more robust. At the same time, however, households are probably much more leveraged, thanks to the revolution in retail credit, and rising interest rates could, therefore, have a strong impact on consumer spending and growth. The problem is, as RBI officials have never tired of pointing out, that if rates are not hiked now, the economy will overheat and rates will have to be increased much more sharply later. In short, the risks of a hard landing increase.

 The finance ministers worry seems premature. Credit growth, for instance, is rising at a y-o-y rate of 31.8 per cent, well above the 30.5 per cent in mid-May and higher than 29.9 per cent at March-end. Even in January this year, y-o-y credit growth was 30.8 per cent. In other words, the RBI needs to tighten more, which is precisely what it has done. 

 Indian stocks in US

 How popular are Indian stocks with US retail investors? One indication of that can be found in traded closed-ended funds like the India fund. This fund quotes at a 15.5 per cent to its net asset value, which is an indication of the demand for the fund. Of course, the premium was over 30 per cent in May, but even at 15 per cent the premium is pretty substantial. The other ETF, Morgan Stanleys India Investment Fund, quotes at a premium of 3.8 per cent, down from 13.9 per cent at June-end.

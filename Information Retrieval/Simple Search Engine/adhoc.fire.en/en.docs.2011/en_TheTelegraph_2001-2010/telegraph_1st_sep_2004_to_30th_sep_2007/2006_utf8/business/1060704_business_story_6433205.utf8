 Cairn ties up $1bn loan for Rajasthan 

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, July 3: Cairn Energy of the UK has secured a $1-billion loan to fund its oil and gas field development plans in Rajasthan.

 The International Finance Corporation, the private sector arm of the World Bank, has extended $150 million loan to Cairn Energy in the form of a 9-year term loan and a group of international commercial banks will give $850 million five-year term loan.

 The loan will be used to develop Mangala, Aishwariya, Saraswati and Raageshwari fields at block RJ-ON-90/1 in Rajasthan.

 The government has also approved the development plans of the four fields.

 The Mangala, Bhagyam and Aishwariya fields are expected to yield combined proven and probable reserves of 514 million barrels of oil, with up to 685 million barrels of crude ultimately flowing if enhanced oil recovery is implemented.

 As part of the project, IFC and Cairn will help small, local firms provide support services such as food, transportation and security to the oil and gas operations. They will also work with farmers in developing co-operative dairy ventures.

 Cairn is planning to launch an initial public offering either in the fourth quarter of this fiscal or first quarter of the next.

 The IPO is well underway and on track to allow the company to meet its aim of listing on the Bombay Stock Exchange in the last quarter of 2006 or early 2007 subject to market conditions, Cairn said.

 Cairn said it would bring Mangala field on stream by the fourth quarter of 2008, followed by Bhagyam and Aishwariya a year later.

 The first commercial production from Saraswati and Raageshwari fields is planned for the fourth quarter of 2006. The initial combined target plateau rate of between 2,000 and 3,000 barrels of oils per day will be constrained by having to export the produced oil via road tanker, it said.

 However, once the Mangala export infrastructure is installed, it is planned, subject to capacity, that the Saraswati and Raageshwari fields, as well as other southern discoveries, will be tied into the export system.

 Cairn said under the terms of the production sharing contract, the construction of the export system is the responsibility of the government through its nominated buyer, MRPL, a subsidiary of ONGC.

 Facilities and engineering design for Mangala is being undertaken with a specialist team from Cairn working alongside the contractors in Mustang in Houston, the company said.

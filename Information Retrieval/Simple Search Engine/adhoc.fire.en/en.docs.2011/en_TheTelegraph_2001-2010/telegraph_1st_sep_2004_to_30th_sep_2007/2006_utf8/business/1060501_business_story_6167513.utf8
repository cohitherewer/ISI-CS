 IPO scam reveals chink in Sebi armour

 Close vigil

 The IPO scam is rather small compared with others that have shaken the markets, in spite of hogging the headlines. The total profit made by the key players in the scam, according to Sebi?s calculations, is a mere Rs 72.38 crore. That?s roughly the amount estimated by the income tax department as well ? I-T sleuths put the total money made by these operators at Rs 60.62 crore between January 1, 2004 and October 14, 2005. What?s more, they?ve even paid a tax of Rs 14.66 crore on their gains. No wonder the stock market brushed off the Sebi order so nonchalantly.

 Sure, some small investors may have lost out on allotments because Roopalben and gang cornered the market. But how much of the retail allotment did they manage to corner? They got 2.37 per cent of the TV Today issue?s retail allotment, 2.71 per cent of Patni Computers, 2.09 per cent of TCS, 1.3 per cent of NTPC, 0.5 per cent of Jet Airways and 3.74 per cent of Suzlon. The loss to each individual applicant isn?t much.

 But if the amount of the scam is small, that?s merely due to good fortune and it?s a wonder why other operators didn?t join in the scam. The Sebi order is a long list of the sins of omission and commission of practically every institution involved in the IPO process. Thousands of benami and fictitious accounts were opened, IPO financing was done at ridiculously low margins, thousands of demat and bank account holders had the same address, many of the addresses were patently wrong. One gentleman had as many as 286 savings bank accounts with one bank, many bank accounts had the same signatures but different names, inspections by depositories were shoddy, the fines imposed were laughable and so on. In other words, the scam was waiting to happen.

 As usual, it didn?t take long for Sebi to have egg all over its face. It had to suspend its order against Indiabulls when the latter argued that the customers? shares deposited in the account were meant as margin money. It?s also difficult to understand where was the need for Sebi to rush through with the order without giving an opportunity to the institutions to explain their actions. Such mistakes chip away at the reputation of the regulator.

 Numerous studies in markets across the world have shown that the book-building method of price discovery leads to severe underpricing of IPOs. 

 The reason is pretty simple: while a merchant banker undoubtedly wants the best deal for the client (the company whose IPO one is selling), one wants an even better deal for the large institutional investors with whom one places an issue. That?s because the banker will have to deal with the investor cronies again and again, for every issue that the person manages. The banker?s relations with the issuer, on the other hand, are not so frequent. Given the prevalence of underpricing and the huge listing gains that can be made, the system is naturally prone to abuse, whether it?s by Roopalben in India or a big investment bank like Salomon Smith Barney in the US.

 One way out of the problem will be to spend a lot of time and money to ensure that multiple applications are weeded out, but they haven?t been able to do that all these years. 

 The other option is to remove preferential allotment for the so-called small investors altogether and let them either bid for their shares just like everybody else or invest through the mutual fund route. Standard Chartered?s new Enterprise Equity Fund is the first fund to specifically target IPOs and flip them on listing.

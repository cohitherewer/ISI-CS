The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Priority to clinical trials

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Dec. 8: India is becoming a favourite destination for clinical trials and this segment of health business will generate over $1 billion by 2010. 

 Greater opportunities in the health sector as mentioned in a McKinsey projection was the crux of the session on information, communication and technology in healthcare at Infocom 2006.

 According to estimates, drug manufacturing companies spent $70 million on clinical trials in India in 2002 and the projected spending in 2007 is $200 million. 

 Reasons like huge population suffering from a number of diseases, divergent ethnic groups and low infrastructure cost will bring in more investments in clinical trials in the country, said Chanchal Goswami, medical director of B.P. Poddar Hospital and Medical Research. 

 Less stringent rules compared to the Western world and cheap labour are the other factors favouring India. Out of around half a million clinicians in the country, nearly 250 are trained in clinical trial practice. 

 But only 150 general hospitals in the country have adequate infrastructure to conduct the trials, added Goswami. 

 Growing importance of IT in healthcare system was the main focus of the session on health, addition to this years Infocom. Speaking on telemedicine for patient centric healthcare, Subra Sripada, director, healthcare advisory services, PriceWaterhouse Coopers said the traditional role of telemedicine is undergoing a sea change. 

 The traditional view is it served the rural and under-served communities lacking direct access to physicians. But telemedicine is used in urban areas with focus on providing care in a cost effective manner, he said. Telemedicine is proving convenient for patients with chronic diseases requiring regular monitoring and feedback, said T. K. Udairam, CEO, Changi General Hospital, Singapore.

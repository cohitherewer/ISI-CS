 Calcutta, July 31: The shareholders of wire rope major Usha Martin today approved the boards proposal to raise $75 million to fund its expansion plans.

 The company plans to raise its speciality steel making capacity to 1 million tonnes in the next four years at an investment of Rs 1,200 crore.

 Usha Martins present capacity is about 350,000 tonnes, which is being enhanced to 500,000 tonnes. The ongoing expansion will be part of the bigger plan, chairman B.K. Jhawar told the companys 20th annual general meeting today.

 The capital expenditure will be funded through a mix of debt, equity and internal accrual. The company has already raised Rs 200-crore equity through GDR and preferential allotment to promoters, while another Rs 500 crore is expected to be generated by cash flows in the next four years.

 Even though the balance amount could be pure debt, the enabling resolution will give us the flexibility to use other instruments like foreign currency convertible bonds, Prashant Jhawar, vice-chairman of the company, said during the AGM.

 When its speciality steel making capacity goes up to 1 mt, Usha Martin will use 400,000 tonnes to make wire and wire ropes and other value-added products. The rest will be sold to auto component makers.

 Anxious moments for oil trio as crude boils

 S.P.S. PANNU

 Boiling point

 New Delhi, July 3: Public sector oil companies are yet to get the carte blanche on fuel prices, though global crude is simmering near the $70-level which should be the trigger for another round of hikes.

 When fuel prices were raised last month, the government had indicated that oil retailers ? Indian Oil, HPCL and BPCL ? would be allowed to raise prices of diesel and petrol whenever the Indian basket of crude crosses $70 in international markets.

 And with the reference basket ruling at $69.5 levels since June 30, judgement day may not be that far away.

 Political compulsions clearly outweigh economic reasoning in fuel pricing, and the government, facing heavy Left artillery over its policies, has no means to summon the wills to push through a hike.

 The Indian basket of crude comprises 55 per cent Gulf and 45 per cent Brent. The relatively cheaper Gulf crude has a high-sulphur content, while the Brent is of the sweet variety. The basket is $3 cheaper than Brent and $5 less than the New York light variety. 

 India imports 70 per cent of its crude, which comprises 90 per cent of the production cost of oil companies, giving them little leeway if global prices shoot up.

 With the oil companies losing money on the sale of kerosene and LPG, the government has issued them interest bearing bonds worth Rs 28,000 crore as partial compensation. The bonds are IOU slips from the government, which the oil companies can encash in the market. 

 The bonds are also incorporated in the balance sheets of oil companies, saving them from plunging into the red. 

 The government has also directed ONGC, OIL and GAIL to share the subsidy burden on cooking fuels. The trio is expected to shell out Rs 24,000 crore in the current fiscal.

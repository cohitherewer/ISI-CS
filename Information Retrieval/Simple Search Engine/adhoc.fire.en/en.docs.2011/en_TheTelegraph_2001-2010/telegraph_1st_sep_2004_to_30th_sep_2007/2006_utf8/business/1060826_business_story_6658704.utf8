 Tata Motors arm for car financing

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 25: Tata Motors Limited has set up a 100 per cent subsidiary, TML Financial Services Limited, to support and increase the companys vehicle financing operations.

 According to a release issued by Tata Motors to the Bombay Stock Exchange today, the new entity will function as a non-banking finance company, for which it has received the necessary approval from the Reserve Bank.

 TML Financial Services (TMLFSL) will support and enhance the vehicle financing activities of Tata Motorfinance. TMLFSL will help Tata Motorfinance, which handled a total business of Rs 5,500 crore last year mainly by financing Tata Motors vehicles, tap the opportunities that arise when the new Rs 1 lakh car is launched in 2008.

 Sources say Tata Motors expects its small car sales to cross 1 million within a few years of its launch. The potential for this segment is expected to be 3.5 million by 2011.

 The new subsidiary also gains significance as the Tata group had sometime back closed down Tata Finance, its beleaguered NBFC arm, which had a huge capital market exposure.

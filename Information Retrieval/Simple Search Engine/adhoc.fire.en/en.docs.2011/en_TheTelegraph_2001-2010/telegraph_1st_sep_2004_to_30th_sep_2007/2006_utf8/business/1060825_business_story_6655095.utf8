 Home comfort for senior citizens

 JAYATI GHOSE

 Safe haven

 New Delhi, Aug. 24: The government is considering a novel banking product that will allow senior citizens to mortgage their homes and receive fat monthly cheques for a fixed number of years. After they expire, the banks will take over their homes, sell it and recover the dues and turn over the rest to their natural heirs.

 The concept may sound a little weird, but it could prove a boon for elderly people without sufficient pension incomes or support to lead the kind of life they are used to.

 It works on the principle of a reverse mortgage scheme and is being framed by the state-run National Housing Bank (NHB). The scheme has been sent to the Reserve Bank of India for approval, which is expected to come through pretty soon. NHB plans to market its reverse mortgage through retail banks and housing finance companies. This product ensures greater financial security to the elderly, said S. Sridhar, chairman and managing director of National Housing Bank. 

 A reverse mortgage is a loan against your home that you do not have to pay back for as long as you live in that house, said Sridhar. 

 The concept of reverse mortgage seeks to enable house-owning senior citizens to meet their expenses without selling their house. 

 In a conventional mortgage, the borrower makes monthly payments to the lender. But in a reverse mortgage, a lender makes payments to the borrower.

 Heres how the process works: the person interested in pledging his house through a reverse mortgage scheme will first have to approach a housing finance company or a bank, which will then assess the value of the house. 

 Depending on the valuation, the individuals age and the prevailing interest rate, the bank will fix a monthly or quarterly sum that will be paid to him or her. The value of the house will be determined by independent valuers who will follow the generally accepted property valuation methodology in the industry.

 There will be a provision for periodic re-valuation and consequent re-calculation of payments. Banks will be asked to re-evaluate every five years, said Sridhar. 

 The recommendations that NHB has sent to the RBI sets the minimum age of the borrower at 62 years and fixes the tenure at 15 years.

 So, what happens after 15 years? The payments stop but the senior citizen continues to live in the house until his death. Although the payments made to the borrower would stop after 15 years, the interest would keep accumulating. It is after the death of the borrower that the bank moves in to take control of the house, sells it and recover its dues and then defrays the remaining amount among the heirs.

 If the property appreciates in the interim period, any amount over and above the loan amount that the bank recovers on the sale of property would be returned to the heirs of the borrower, said Sridhar. 

 There have been recommendations to lower the age to 60 as people usually retire at that age. The primary lenders shall have the discretion to consider a shorter/longer tenure, Sridhar added. 

 With the property market booming, this could mean better income streams with every re-valuation. Analysts believe such a clause could prove to be an inflation buster for most retired persons. They, however, warn that the critical factor in deciding the loan amount would be age.

 The older the borrower, the higher the chances of getting a bigger loan value. This is because the lender will have to typically provide the loan for a fewer number of years, said Sridhar. 

 The interest rate at which the loan will be given will be similar to the home loan rate. There will also be a choice between a fixed and floating rate, said Sridhar.

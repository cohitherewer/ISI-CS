 Nagpur set to house air cargo complex 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Patel: Sops galore

 New Delhi, April 11: The government will set up an integrated air-cargo complex in Nagpur spread across 5000 hectares.

 We are looking at giving concessions on landing and parking fee for those air-cargo services operating out of the proposed hub in Nagpur, civil aviation minister Praful Patel said today.

 He said the state government of Maharashtra would be co-opted in the development of the proposed complex.

 The minister said plans were afoot to re-activate all airports and airfields in the country. 

 For the development of the airports and airfields, the government can partner with the respective state governments or rope in a private firm.

 He said it was a necessity to revisit the existing policy of not allowing a second airport to be built within a 150 km radius of the existing one.

 Civil aviation secretary Ajay Prasad said cities like New York and London have more than one airport. Smaller airports could also come up in or around Delhi to cater to the domestic or low-cost air operations, he added. 

 However, the proposed second airport in Mumbai could be bigger than the existing one, he said. 

 Patel said the government has decided to merge Air-India with Indian Airlines in the current year but so far no decision has been taken on floating a single IPO for the merged entity.

 He said the new civil aviation policy, which is on the anvil, would recommend steps to encourage regional and intra-state operations from a single metro.

 The policy is expected to contain detailed safety regulations and guidelines and redefine the role of the directorate general of civil aviation.

 The minister said the aviation sector requires a massive overdose of restructuring and investment. 

 Prasad echoed similar views and said a staggering Rs 30,000 crore would be required to upgrade and modernise 35 airports in the country. Participation from the private sector was required, as the entire burden could not be borne by the public exchequer, he added.

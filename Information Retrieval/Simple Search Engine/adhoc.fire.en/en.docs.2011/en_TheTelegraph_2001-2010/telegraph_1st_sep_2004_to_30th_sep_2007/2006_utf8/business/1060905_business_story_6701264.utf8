 Chidambaram: Giving hints

 Chennai, Sept. 4: Union finance minister P. Chidambaram today said the future of the Indian banking industry lay in consolidation, either through acquisitions or mergers, but ruled out any government role in it. 

 The history of banks world-over bear ample testimony to the fact that banks had grown through the consolidation route, but our job in the government is to only tell the PSU banks where their future lies, Chidambaram said after the inauguration of the centenary celebrations of Indian Bank.

 We do not want to impose anything on any PSU bank, he said. It is up to the management and union of the bank to approach the government with a merger proposals. 

 Chidambaram said he expected such voluntary initiatives on the part of bank managements and unions in the next two to three years. 

 He recalled Indian Banks miraculous turnaround in the last 10 years, from a very critical stage in 1996, when Chidambaram was the finance minister in the United Front government. He added that now Indian Bank was out of that major crisis and progressing well as a strong public sector bank. 

 Chidambaram is proud of the fact that his maternal grandfather was among the founders of the Indian Bank, founded on August 15, 1907. Since the 1996 crisis, the banks turnaround had been truly remarkable, he said. 

 The finance minister told Indian Bank chairman K. Chakrabarty that he would make it an uncommon bank to the common man. The business turnover of Indian Bank today was about Rs.65,000 crore, he said.

 The finance minister went on to say that Indias PSU banks were now on a very strong wicket. Collectively their deposits had touched Rs 16,19,478 crore, advances Rs 10,94,180 crore, while their net non-performing assets have slid to just 1.30 per cent. The PSU banks have collectively lent Rs 21,835 crore to the farm sector, Rs 1,51,549 crore to small-scale industry and Rs 10,005 crore towards educational loans, he said.

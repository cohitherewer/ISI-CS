 Morgan predicts dark days

 New Delhi, June 11 (PTI): Morgan Stanley said in a report today that the downslide across the world markets is not just another correction and the global liquidity bubble might be bursting.

 Morgan Stanleys economist Andy Xie said in a latest report on the Asia-Pacific region that the US federal reserve and other central banks across the world are turning to fight inflationary pressure and further rate hikes are necessary to stop inflation. Morgan Stanleys India-based analysts Chetan Ahya and Mihir Sheth said in a separate report today that the US federal reserve would continue to hike the rates and the RBI was likely to keep pace with the Fed. 

 The RBI is likely to raise the reverse repo rate by another 50 basis points to 6.25 per cent by the year-end, the report said. However, if the Fed hikes its benchmark rate beyond the current forecast of 5.5 per cent, the RBI would have to follow with larger rate hikes than current expectations, it added. Morgan Stanleys London-based economist Stephen Jen said interest rates were more relevant measures of global liquidity and rising interest rates.

 Star Paper Mills set to double capacity

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Goenka: Looking ahead

 Calcutta, Sept. 6: The board of Star Paper Mills Ltd has approved in principle its Rs 500-crore expansion plan, which will double the companys capacity to 150,000 tonnes per annum from around 80,000 tonnes.

 The company will finalise funding options with the help of a consultant and is open to all kinds of possibilities, including raising funds from the market.

 We are looking at formalising the idea and will prepare a detailed project report (DPR) in the next couple of months. The expansion will take two years to complete. We will utilise the companys existing facility and are not looking at other locations, said G.P. Goenka, chairman and director of Star Paper Mills.

 The plan also includes tackling problems such as lack of bleaching capacity, revamping old production units, which date back to the forties and produce only 40 to 50 tonnes per day and changing the product mix for higher value-added products.

 The company will be commissioning its second 5-mw steam turbine to combat rising input costs, which will help reduce energy expenditure by December 2006.

 Star would require another 4-mw turbine, which would be considered in the next phase.

 It will also set up a Rs 30-crore bagasse pulping plant of 100-tonnes-per-day capacity at its existing location.

 The company will raise the funds through debt and internal accrual.

 Star reduced its finished goods inventory by 603 million tonnes (mt), which helped offset its production loss partially.

 Average price realisations increased 7.47 per cent to Rs 27,583 per mt on account of price hikes and product mix improvement to value-added varieties of industrial and cultural paper.

 The demand for paper in India is projected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.10 per cent to an estimated 7.4 million tonnes in 2008-09. Industrial paper, which comprises almost 60 per cent of the market, has a CAGR of 6.7 per cent and writing and printing paper 5.5 per cent.

 Star had produced 55 per cent industrial and 45 per cent cultural paper in 2005-06.

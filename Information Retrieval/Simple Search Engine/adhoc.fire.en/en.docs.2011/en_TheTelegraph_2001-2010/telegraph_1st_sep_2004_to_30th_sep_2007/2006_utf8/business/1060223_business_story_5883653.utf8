 Tata Coffee taste for tourism

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Feb. 22: Tata Coffee Limited (TCL) has decided to foray into tourism business. To start with, it will develop three bungalows in the Coorg estates and plans to add up to 50 to 60 rooms in the next one year subject to market response.

 The company has 17 estates in the south in Coorg, Hassan and Chickmagalur districts of Karnataka with 12 plantation bungalows.

 We are considering starting with three bungalows with rooms ranging from three to five in each. We will then do up the remaining nine in the next four to five months, Tata Coffee managing director M.H. Ashraff said.

 Tata Coffee also has 30 roast and ground coffee outlets in south India and plans to extend the chain to central India, New Delhi and the other metros in the latter half of the year.

 Though coffee prices have moved up significantly in the last six months, times are such that businesses should look beyond single commodities and try to contribute positively to the topline and bottomline growth by diversifying portfolios and focusing on value additions, Ashraff said.

 Tata Coffee expects to produce 9400 mt of coffee this fiscal against around 8000 mt in 2004-05.

 Ashraff refused to comment on the exact amount invested in the tourism venture. 

 He only said the investment was substantial as the bungalows ? the original estate homes occupied by the Tata Coffee planters ? and the facilities would be done up according to international standards.

 The Plantation Trail Holiday Homes, priced between Rs 2,500 and Rs 3,500 per double room (taxes as applicable) and including breakfast, will cater to international and domestic travellers. There will be additional attractions like jeep drives, biking, fishing and golfing at the companys own course.

 We have not tied up with any hospitality company to manage the properties. Instead, a unique model has been devised, which involves the wives of estate managers, to manage and operate the properties, Ashraff said.

 Tata Coffee had a turnover of Rs 205 crore last fiscal and expects to end this fiscal with the same amount.

 The company had exported the highest quantity of 5000 mt of instant coffee last fiscal. 

 It plans to focus on value-addition in coffee as a corporate policy and is the third largest coffee vending company in the country.

 In addition to this endeavour in eco-tourism, which is increasingly gaining popularity in the country, Tata Coffee has also forayed into bi-cropping like vanilla and medicinal crops.

 The company will cultivate vanilla across 500 hectares in the next two years while the medicinal crop cultivation has just started this year.

 Tata Coffee had also purchased six tea estates from Tata Tea six months back and plans to produce tea-related value-added products and extracts.

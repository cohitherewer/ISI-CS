 Calcutta, Nov. 13: Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Ltd (RINL), popularly known as Vizag Steel Plant, has sought land from the Andhra Pradesh government for a special economic zone (SEZ).

 Y. Siva Sagar Rao, chairman and managing director of RINL, said the company wants 2,500 acres for the SEZ.

 We want to develop this zone for the downstream steel industry with a focus on automobile and forging, Rao added.

 After the state government gives its consent for the land, the management will seek board approval for the plan.

 The company has sought land adjacent to its existing integrated plant.

 It is yet to be seen whether the government agrees to provide such a large tract for this SEZ as land has been a hotly debated issue now.

 RINL will not take part in the downstream project. Instead, it will develop infrastructure and allocate plots to prospective players.

 Since it does not have the requisite experience, RINL may float a special purpose vehicle (SPV) to execute the job.

 For the SPV, we may take a partner who is qualified for the job, he added.

 RINLs expansion plan is on schedule, Rao said at an interactive session with the Merchant Chamber of Commerce (MCC) here today.

 RINL is increasing its capacity to 6.3 million tonnes (mt) per annum from 3 mt per annum. The project has been approved by all government authorities.

 In the first phase of three years, RINL would expand hot metal production facility, steel making facility, sinter plant, wire rod and seamless tube mill.

 In the second phase, a special bar mill and a structural mill would be added.

 The total project cost is about Rs 9,000 crore.

 Once the expanded capacity starts production, the proposed SEZ will come handy.

 Export-oriented units located within the SEZ will save on logistic cost. They do not have to bring semi-finished products long distance and a port being close by, the cost of sending finished product is also limited.

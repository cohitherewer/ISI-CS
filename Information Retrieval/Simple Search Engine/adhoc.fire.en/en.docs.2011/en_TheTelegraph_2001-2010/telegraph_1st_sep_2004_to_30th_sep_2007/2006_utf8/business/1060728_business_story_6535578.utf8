 Hutch clears govt hurdle

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Call forward

 New Delhi, July 27: The government today approved an increase in foreign equity holding in Hutchison Telecom to 68 per cent from 49 per cent.

 The proposal was one among 14 FDIs cleared by finance minister P. Chidambaram today.

 The Hutch proposal did not involve any fresh inflow of foreign investment, officials said.

 Earlier this month, the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) gave its nod to a 68 per cent foreign shareholding in Hutchison Essar, including the 10 per cent indirect stake held by Egyptian telecom operator Orascom. However, the Ruias, the Indian partner with a 33 per cent stake in the cellular joint venture, had requested for a deferment of the proposal.

 The Orascom proposal was earlier cleared by the department of telecommunications on the grounds that transfer of shares took place outside India and that does not breach the overall 74 per cent FDI ceiling in telecom. 

 The FIPB also approved the Orascom stake in Hutchison Essar on similar grounds. 

 The FIPB clearance came after Hutchison approached the board as FDI in the joint venture company had crossed 49 per cent. 

 Current guidelines stipulate that FDI between 49 and 74 per cent in a telecom venture needs to be cleared by the FIPB. The FIPB clearance came in the midst of a debate on the issue of an indirect equity shareholding of Orascom.

 Last December, Orascom Telecom of Egypt picked up a 19.3 per cent in Hutchison Telecommunications International (HTIL) for $1.3 billion and, thereby, acquired an indirect stake of a little over 10 per cent in Hutchison Essar. The deal also gave Orascom the option of raising its stake in HTIL by another 3.69 per cent and, therefore, its stake in the Indian telecom giant. 

 The Ruias were hugely upset with the sale of the indirect stake in Hutchison Essar to Orascom which not only gave the Egyptian company a 10 per cent stake but also entitled it to a board seat.

 Entry rules for expats

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 New Delhi, Sept. 3: The Congress government will consider framing uniform rules relating to employment of foreign nationals in sensitive industries as part of a new legislation enveloping the security issues linked to foreign direct investment (FDI). 

 The government is also mulling exchange of intelligence with major economic partners in select cases of FDI proposals from transnationals who may have been barred elsewhere. This will be done by intelligence agencies and not be an official policy or part of the new legislation covering security aspects of foreign direct investment. 

 Top government sources said the idea behind the move is that if a transnational has been rejected by a foreign power, India will try and find out what went wrong.

 We already have a system of screening investments in sensitive areas by taking the help of intelligence agencies. These agencies are also regularly exchanging intelligence on a host of matters with their counterparts abroad. We need to extend that cooperation to economic intelligence as this has a major bearing on national security, officials said. 

 The issue of foreign nationals being employed in critical positions in sensitive areas such as telecom and airports have often been raised inside and outside Parliament. It cropped up last year when the government was framing guidelines on allowing 74 per cent foreign stake in telecom companies.

 A section within the government argued that in companies where the foreign stakeholders do not have a controlling interest, foreign nationals should be allowed to occupy critical positions. However, in the companies where the foreign investor had a controlling stake, the government should insist that only Indian personnel should be at the helm of affairs. 

 We plan to have a single set of rules for all firms in sensitive areas on employing foreign nationals and on taking security clearances for them, officials said. This will be in the form of security standards for foreigners in sensitive positions. Most OECD countries follow a similar path, officials said. 

 The framing of the new rules will mean potential investors will know where they stand while making an investment application without having to wait for several years with their application neither being rejected nor accepted.

 The new legislation will not only cover investment through the Foreign Investment Promotion Board route but also those termed automatic approval cases where the Reserve Bank has simply to be notified.

 Tug-of-war over fuel price hike

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, July 5: Petroleum minister Murli Deora today ruled out raising petrol and diesel prices even if the Indian basket of crude imports shoots past the $70-per-barrel mark.

 There is no question of revising prices again even if crude rises above $70 per barrel, Deora said.

 However, a senior Indian Oil official claimed that the government has agreed to revise petrol and diesel prices at the end of the month if the average price of crude in July is more than $70 per barrel.

 According to the official, the government has said oil companies can review the situation on the last day of each month, and if the Indian basket of crude averaged above $70 a barrel, we can raise the retail prices of automobile fuels.

 The official added that the Indian basket of crude is likely to cross $70 per barrel in July as it is averaging over $70.95 a barrel in the last few days, which is higher than $66.95 average in June and $67.29 in May.

 But Deora was emphatic that no hike in transport fuels was on the cards. 

 The flip-flop could be due to political considerations as the UPAs Left allies are already on the warpath over the price rise issue.

 Deora said the government has asked oil companies to import more kerosene and build a buffer stock to meet the current shortage of cooking fuel in the country.

 Earlier, oil companies were allowed to review the impact of global price trends on a fortnightly basis.

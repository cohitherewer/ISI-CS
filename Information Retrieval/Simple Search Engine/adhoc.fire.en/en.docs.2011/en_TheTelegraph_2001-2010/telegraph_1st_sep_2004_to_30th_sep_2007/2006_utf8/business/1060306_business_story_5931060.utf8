 Buzz gets louder on Anil telecom firm

 Ambani: Big plans

 Mumbai, March 5: When Reliance-ADAG chairman Anil Dhirubhai Ambani strikes the gong at the rotunda of the Bombay Stock Exchange on Monday, he will be heralding the start of what could well go down as the Year of Telecom on the bourses.

 The gong will mark the ceremonial start of Mondays trading and the formal listing of Anil Ambanis Reliance Communication Ventures Ltd (RCoVL). But it will also mark the end of an anxious wait for many investors and analysts who have been speculating on what RCoVLs listing price will be.

 RCoVL has caused a buzz on the market even before it lists on Monday. There have been dabba or grey market deals, and reputed analysts have been crunching numbers to assign a value to the company, predicting its listing price and the premia that investors of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) can hope to get over the so-called imputed value. The markets interest is not confined to RCoVL alone.

 Last week, the Anil Ambani group company piqued huge investor interest at the telecom counters and tangential gains flowed to Bharti Tele-Ventures Ltd and Tata Teleservices (Maharashtra) Ltd. The market capital of Bharti Tele-Ventures soared over Rs 4,000 crore in four trading sessions as its scrip gained by more than 13 per cent. The other telecom services counter ? Tata Teleservices Maharashtra ? has also seen its market cap rising to over Rs 3,817 crore, a rise of around Rs 70 crore.

 Bharti Tele-Ventures is now the largest listed telecom company in the country with a market capitalisation of Rs 27,000 crore (on the basis of floating stock). After RCoVL lists, investors will be all agog over the third telecom blockbuster issue ? Hutchison Essar Ltd (HEL) ? which is slated for later this year.

 Analysts have already began to talk about an IPO price of Rs 800 per share for HEL, thus giving it a market capitalisation of over Rs 50,000 crore (on a non-floating stock basis) compared with Rs 77,000 crore enjoyed by Bharti today.

 Just last week, Kotak Mahindra Bank sold an 8.33 per cent stake in HEL to Analjit Singh of Max India for Rs 1,019 crore. This gave the company a rough valuation of $6 billion.

 With two big-ticket listings this year, 2006 could well be dubbed as the Year of Telecom. The board of Tata Teleservices Maharashtra put off a meeting last Friday to decide on a rights issue. An unlisted group company, Tata Teleservices, is looking at roping in strategic investors. Clearly, the telecom space is buzzing.

 Cut to RCoVL: Analysts and market circles look forward to a listing price of anywhere between Rs 260 to Rs 300 per share. 

 The cheery optimists are pitching it higher at Rs 320. RCoVL will get a market capitalisation of around Rs 37,000 crore if it lists at a price of Rs 300 per share. RIL shareholders, therefore, will have reasons to be happy as listing of RCoVL even at the lower end of market expectations, is a premium to the imputed value put at Rs 170.

 While RCoVL holds shares in Reliance Infocomm Ltd and Reliance Telecom Ltd among other entities, analysts say Bharti had better watch its back because its perch could be under threat from the Anil Ambani company as it vies to notch up the largest market capitalisation among listed telecom companies.

 There are many triggers that could lead to an upside in RCoVL. First, there is the possibility of a merger among the entities in which the company holds shares. Then, the group could go in for a reverse merger with Reliance Infocomm. Thereafter, Reliance Infocomm could go looking for a strategic investor. RCoVL is also talking about an international listing. All this shows that not only will the company list at a premium, but it will also generate a lot of interest on the stock exchanges, a broker said.

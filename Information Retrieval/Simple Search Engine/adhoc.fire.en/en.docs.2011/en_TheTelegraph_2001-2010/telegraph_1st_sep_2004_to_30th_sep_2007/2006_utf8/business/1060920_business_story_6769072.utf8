 Toyota bets on Lexus

 Tokyo, Sept.19 (Reuters): Toyota Motor Corporation, Japans top automaker, is targeting global sales of at least 5,00,000 units for its luxury Lexus brand, helped by the new flagship LS sedan, its president said on Tuesday.

 We are discussing the sales target for next year internally, but I would like to sell at least 5,00,000 units next year, president Katsuaki Watanabe told a news conference to launch the Lexus LS460 sedan.

 Sales for this year is likely to total 470,000 units globally, he added. In 2005, Toyota sold 396,200 Lexus vehicles worldwide, of which just 10,000 were in Japan, where Mercedes-Benz and BMW dominate the premium sedan segment.

 Despite being the top-selling luxury brand in the US, Lexus has fallen short of Toyotas initial sales expectations in Japan since its launch in August 2005. But Watanabe said he expected the new LS460, packed with world-first features such as an eight-speed automatic transmission and advanced safety technology, to spur a boost in Lexus sales at home and globally.

 In 2006, Toyota expects to sell 20,000 units of the new LS460 sedan globally half of that in Japan. The model will be launched in North America next month, followed by other markets. A hybrid version of the car, the LS600h, featuring a newly developed hybrid system and 5.0-litre V8 engine, will be rolled out next spring.

 Competition in the Japanese luxury-car market is set to grow tougher, with domestic rival Honda Motor Company scheduled to bring out its high-end Acura brand in 2008. 

 Nissan Motor Company is also considering a domestic launch of the Infiniti marquee.

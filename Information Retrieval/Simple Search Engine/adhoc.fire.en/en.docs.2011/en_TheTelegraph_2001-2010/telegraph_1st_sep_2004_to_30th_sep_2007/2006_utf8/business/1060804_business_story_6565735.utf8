 Bharat Forge eyes Bengal

 Kalyani: Forging ahead

 Calcutta, Aug. 3: Bharat Forge worlds second largest forging company that supplies auto component parts to BMW, DaimlerChrysler and GM will set up a plant in Bengal.

 Baba N. Kalyani, chairman of the company, today met chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and industry minister Nirupam Sen and unveiled his plan.

 I am happy to be here, Kalyani said after meeting the chief minister.

 Even though he did not spell out the investment plan, sources said the new unit could cost Rs 600 crore.

 It does not make sense for a company like us to come all the way from Pune (its headquarters) to do something small here, Kalyani said.

 Bharat Forge is an Indian multinational with manufacturing facilities spread over nine locations in six countries two in India, three in Germany, one in Sweden, one in Scotland, one in North America and one in China. Bengal could be its tenth location.

 The company is sending a team in two weeks to carry out a feasibility study, which will be completed in September. Kalyani said the decision would be taken by October.

 The team is looking at a location close to the port as it will focus on exports to mainly China and Southeast Asia.

 Sen said Bharat Forge officials would be shown a few places like Durgapur where the unit may come up.

 They have decided to set up a plant. They will let us know about the land requirement shortly, Sen said.

 Even though auto component contributes to 85 per cent of Bharat Forges business, it will not focus on the capital goods sector here since the automobile industry is yet to mature.

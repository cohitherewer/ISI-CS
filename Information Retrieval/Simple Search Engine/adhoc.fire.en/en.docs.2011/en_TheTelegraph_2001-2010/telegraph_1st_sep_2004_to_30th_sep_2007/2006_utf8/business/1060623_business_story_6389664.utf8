 Nalco, Neyveli to be milked

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Time is now

 New Delhi, June 22: The cabinet committee on economic affairs today cleared the proposal to sell 10 per cent of the government?s stake both in Nalco and Neyveli Lignite Corporation. The government plans to mop up Rs 2,500 crore from this exercise.

 After the selloff, the government?s equity in Nalco will come down to 77.15 per cent from 87.15 per cent and NLC to 83.56 per cent from 93.56 per cent.

 Finance minister P. Chidambaram said the government would sell the shares by book-building and fix the price after consulting the lead managers.

 The selloff had its fair share of hurdles, with the Left erecting ideological barriers and mines minister Sis Ram Ola arguing against the dilution of stake in Nalco. Even on Tuesday, Ola told newspersons that ?we will agree to it only if the money from stake sale is made available to Nalco for its expansion.?

 However, Chidambaram said the divestment did not deviate from the consensus reached with the Left last November. The government had then said it would steer clear of navratnas and sell stakes in some profit-making companies. 

 ?We are not touching navratna companies and the divestment in non-navratnas is a continuation of the earlier decision,? he said.

 The proceeds will be parked in the National Investment Fund, which will be used for sick PSUs and social sector development. On current valuation, the government will earn Rs 1,400 crore from the sale in Nalco and Rs 1,100 crore from Neyveli. North Block had planned to split the shares of Nalco to make it more attractive to retail investors. 

 Power to DGCA

 The government today decided to amend the aircraft act of 1934, vesting more powers on the Director-General of Civil Aviation to regulate critical operations such as air traffic management and activities of foreign-registered aircraft in India.

 Chidambaram said the law ministry was in the final stages of drafting the amendments which will then be introduced in Parliament. 

 The new law will empower the DGCA to set standards at airports for the tools used in communication, navigation and surveillance as well as in air traffic management. It will also control air transport services, prohibit flights over specified areas and ban slaughter of animals within a 10-km radius of airports.

 TCG okay with Bengal stake in HPL

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, July 5: The Chatterjee Group (TCG) today said it was not averse to the West Bengal government holding on to its equity shares in Haldia Petrochemicals Ltd (HPL).

 TCGs counsel, in its submission before the Company Law Board (CLB), said, So far as the governments shares are concerned, this is not a case where two private parties are in joint management. We have no objection to the government holding on to its shares. 

 West Bengal government may continue as a partner in HPL. We will remain a categorical partner in HPL, TCG contended. The hearing will continue tomorrow at the CLB.

 The West Bengal government had earlier this year made an all-or-none offer to TCG asking it to either buy the entire stake of HPL at Rs 28.80 or above per share and become the sole owner of the company or else sell all its shares at this price to the state government and exit from the company. 

 Consequently, TCG had called for an independent valuation of the HPLs share price at the CLB.

 Goodricke falls for African wine

 David: Spirited venture

 Calcutta, Aug. 7: Goodricke Group of Companies has moved a step closer towards diversification. The company is sending K.S. David, the newly appointed managing director diversification, to South Africa to take a look at wine operations of holding company Camellia plc.

 Wine is a possible diversification options, along with rubber, livestock, macadamia nuts, citrus fruits and rubber.

 Linton Park is the wholly owned subsidiary of Camellia plc in South Africa that looks after wines.

 Linton Park has thousands of hectares under vineyard operations in South Africa and makes wines such as Cabernet Sauvignon, Shiraz, Merlot, Chardonney Sauvignon and Chenin Blanc.

 Camellia also produces edible nuts, table grapes, wine grapes and wine citrus in South Africa.

 In India, the holding company is interested only on those areas in which it has prior presence. Wine, therefore, emerges as a strong contender.

 Peter A. Leggatt, chairman of Lawrie Plantation Services Limited and a Goodricke board member, told The Telegraph from London, We have diversified into rubber, orchids, insurance and leasing in Bangladesh. In India, we are looking at different options and have kept an experienced person in charge of diversification. Lawrie Plantation Services is a subsidiary of Camellia.

 Camellias chairman M.C. Perkins was also in the city last week discussing strategies and appointing managing directors for the three divisions diversification, operations and finance.

 Leggatt also said the company usually carried out its diversification activities through a separate company in which Camellia held a majority stake. The same model is followed in South Africa.

 In Africa too, Camellia operates through separate companies. In Kenya, it has companies for pineapple, avocados, forestry and livestock, besides tea.

 The company has not yet decided on the amount to be invested in its diversification activities.

 Goodricke exports instant tea to the Philippines and Malaysia.

 Goodricke is looking at product development in green tea.

 The company is also planning to develop flavoured tea, flavoured powder, boutique tea customised for buyers and other variations like tablets and paste.

 Camellia, which operates in Bangladesh, Kenya, Malawi, the UK, the US and Brazil, has lost around 2 to 3 million kg tea because of the Kenyan drought and its production in Kenya is down by 20 per cent.

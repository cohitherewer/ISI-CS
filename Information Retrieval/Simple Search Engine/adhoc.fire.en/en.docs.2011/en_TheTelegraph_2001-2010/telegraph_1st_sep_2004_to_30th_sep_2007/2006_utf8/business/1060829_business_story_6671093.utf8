 Air Sahara to buy 10 Boeing aircraft

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 28: Air Sahara today placed orders worth $700 million for 10 Boeing 737-800 aeroplanes with the US aircraft company, which sees a $72-billion market in India over the next 20 years.

 The delivery of these aircraft will start by the middle of 2009 and will be completed in the following two years, Air Sahara president Alok Sharma said.

 Regarding the financing plans, Sharma said, There are enough options and instruments available for financing the aircraft purchase. The US exim bank provides loans.

 He said these aircraft were meant for both domestic and international operations of Air Sahara, which is eyeing a 20 per cent market share in the next five years.

 Sharma said the airline, which currently has a market share of about 8 per cent, planned to increase it to 12-13 per cent by December.

 Air Sahara also received its 19th Boeing 737-400 today and would get the 20th one next month.

 The 10 737-800s would be fitted with blended winglets to improve fuel efficiency.

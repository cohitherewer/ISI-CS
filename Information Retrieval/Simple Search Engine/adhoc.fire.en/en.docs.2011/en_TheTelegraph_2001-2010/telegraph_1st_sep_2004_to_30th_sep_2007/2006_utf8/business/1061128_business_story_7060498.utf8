 New Delhi, Nov. 27: Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) today said its city gas would be 33 per cent cheaper than the LPG of public sector oil companies.

 Our gas will cost one-third less than LPG, RIL chairman Mukesh Ambani told journalists on the sidelines of the CII-sponsored India Economic Summit here today.

 He said the gas business would contribute significantly to RILs revenues from 2009-10.

 The company is going full throttle in its city gas venture, applying for a licence to cater to 100 cities, as it waits for the government to put in place the city gas distribution policy. 

 With great demand for gas in cities and expected rise in supply following major discoveries by Reliance and GSPC, the Centre is preparing a policy for gas pipelines and distribution.

 Reliance, which submitted its revised plan to the directorate general of hydrocarbons the upstream regulator early this month, also said it would start production from July 1, 2008.

 RIL plans to invest $5.2 billion to produce 80 million standard cubic meters per day (mmscmd) of gas from the D6 block in Bay of Bengal. The D6 block has in-place reserves of 50 trillion cubic feet.

 Initial output, in July 2008, is pegged at 40 mmscmd, which will go up to 50 mmscmd by December 2008, 60 mmscmd by March 1, 2009 and 80 mmscmd by December 2009. 

 The life of the field is around 15 years, and the yield will diminish after seven-eight years.

 Ambani said the company drilled 32-33 wells and discovered potential gas reserves in almost 25 of them.

 There are large quantities of gas in the KG basin and India is likely to find more natural gas than oil in future, he said. The company has doubled the estimated annual output of gas from this field from 40 mmscmd to 80 mmscmd. 

 Ambani said the expansion programme of the Jamnagar refinery is on track and will be completed by mid-2008. All our projects are on track and the refinery expansion will be completed by middle of 2008, he said. 

 Ambani also called for rationalisation of taxes in the oil sector. He said the taxation impact of petroleum products needs to be alleviated. There is a need for a new mould of taxation structure as seen in other sectors who have benefited due to low taxation, he said. 

 Turnover tax

 The government is likely to issue bonds to reimburse the turnover tax paid by Reliance Industries. The company has claimed compensation on the tax amounting to Rs 80.65 crore for the administered pricing mechanism period up to March 2002.

 Reliance chief Mukesh Ambani today met finance minister P. Chidambaram presumably to take up the issue of compensation of the turnover tax.

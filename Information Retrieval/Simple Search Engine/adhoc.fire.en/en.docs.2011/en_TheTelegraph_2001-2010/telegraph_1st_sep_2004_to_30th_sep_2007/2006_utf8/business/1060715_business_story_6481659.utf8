 Japan ends six-year hiatus

 Tokyo, July 14 (Reuters): Japans central bank raised interest rates for the first time in six years on Friday, lifting its key rate to 0.25 per cent from zero and affirming the end of a long era of deflation and economic stagnation.

 The Bank of Japan joined central banks in the United States and Europe that have already embarked on a credit-tightening cycle, although Japanese interest rates remain minuscule and are likely to stay low for a long time yet.

 We will adjust interest rates gradually while carefully checking the economy and prices, said BoJ governor Toshihiko Fukui.

 The BoJ does not intend to carry out consecutive rate hikes such as those implemented by the US Federal Reserve, he added. 

 In a statement, the BoJ said keeping interest rates at zero might have caused disruptive swings in the economy and prices. But it added that very low rates will probably be maintained for some time.

 Markets had largely factored in the rise in the overnight call rate, but the yen fell on confirmation that it would be a while yet before Japans interest rates caught up to those in the rest of the world.

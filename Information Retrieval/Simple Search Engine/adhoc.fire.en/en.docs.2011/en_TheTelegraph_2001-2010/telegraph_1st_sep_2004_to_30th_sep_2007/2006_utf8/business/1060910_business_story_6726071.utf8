 Jerky debut for potato futures

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 9: The futures trading in Bengal potato, which the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) started today, kicked off with a jerk. The trading had to be stopped mid-session because the price of futures contracts of Potato Tarakeswar the symbol of the Kufri Jyoti variety of Hooghly potato that has been chosen for trading on the MCX platform from today twice broke the upper circuit limit.

 Within the first 15 minutes, Rs 12 crore worth of contracts were traded, said an MCX official. 

 The demand was so high that the futures price (of Tarakeswar potato) hit the circuit breaker twice at 4 per cent. After that, the trading was suspended for the day, he added. 

 MCX expects an annual turnover of Rs 4,000 crore in potato futures trading in Bengal.

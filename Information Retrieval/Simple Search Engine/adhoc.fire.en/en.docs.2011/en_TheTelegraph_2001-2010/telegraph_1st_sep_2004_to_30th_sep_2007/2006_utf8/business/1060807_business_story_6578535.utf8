 Anil rues ministry rejection of gas deal

 Anil: Price blow

 New Delhi, Aug. 6 (PTI): Terming as premature and unfortunate the governments rejection of the gas price agreement between Reliance Industries Ltd and Reliance Natural Resources Ltd, Anil Ambani today said the petroleum ministry should have referred the issue to an expert committee for evaluation.

 Rejection of RIL-RNRL gas price by the petroleum ministry is premature and unfortunate, Ambani said in a statement, while committing himself to the completion of the Rs 25,000-crore gas-based power project at Dadri in Uttar Pradesh.

 Ambani said the gas supply agreement was arrived at in 2004 between the two companies, a claim disputed by RIL, headed by his elder brother Mukesh.

 Apart from the arrangement made in January, no other agreement on gas sale from the Krishna Godavari basin has been entered into between RIL and RNRL at any time, RIL said in a statement.

 Ambanis statement on the gas supply deal comes within days of his unsuccessful attempt for a review of the price proposal was rejected by petroleum minister Murli Deora, whom he met last week.

 Ambani also said the gas supply arrangement was not part of the family settlement of 2005, an issue based on which the petroleum ministry had rejected RILs proposal.

 Last month, the petroleum ministry rejected RILs proposed selling price of gas to RNRL based on the de-merger agreement between the Ambani brothers.

 Rejecting the proposed price of $2.34 per million Btu as significantly lower than the prevailing market price, the ministry said, The transaction between RIL and RNRL is part of their de-merger agreement and therefore, does not meet the production sharing contract (PSC) criteria of arms-length sales. Ambani said the gas contract with RIL was fully compliant with the PSC of the ministry of petroleum and mirrored the RIL-NTPC deal arrived through international competitive bidding and was arms length.

 Opec set to cut output this week

 Algiers, Oct. 15 (AFP): The Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) is set to announce a cut in its production by one million barrels of oil a day to check the slide in global prices, Algerias energy minister Chakib Khelil said today.

 The reduction will be announced during the next meeting of Opec scheduled for Doha from October 18 to 21, he said.

 All the member countries have reached an agreement to reduce Opec production by a million barrels a day, he said, adding that the move would certainly have a direct impact on the market.

 New York crude fell last week to its lowest price this year before recovering slightly on Friday.

 New Yorks main contract, light sweet crude for delivery in November, closed on Friday up 71 cents at $58.57 per barrel, but off earlier highs.

 Brent North Sea crude for November delivery settled up 76 cents at $59.52 per barrel in London on Friday, also off earlier highs.

 Since striking record high points earlier this year, crude futures have crashed on fading geopolitical tensions in the west Asia, an uneventful US Atlantic hurricane season, and bulging US energy stockpiles.

 Khelils announcement today is the latest indication that Opec is planning to prop up prices in response to falls of some 25 per cent from record highs earlier this year.

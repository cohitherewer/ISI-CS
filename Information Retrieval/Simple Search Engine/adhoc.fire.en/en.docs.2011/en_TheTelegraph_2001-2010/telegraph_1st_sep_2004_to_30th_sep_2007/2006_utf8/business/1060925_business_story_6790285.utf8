 Q amp;A

 Saving grace

 Is it mandatory that the money invested for tax savings under section 80C in a particular financial instrument must come from the annual income of that year or can I use a maturity payment of a Kisan Vikash Patra in that year to invest under section 80C?

 Basudeb Sarkar, Konnagar

 It is not mandatory that your tax saving investments in a particular financial year must be made out of your annual income in that year. It was proposed in the budget this year when the finance minister introduced the umbrella section. Later on, the clause was withdrawn. Now you can make tax saving investments in a particular year from your past savings and claim the tax deduction thereon.

 Long-term player

 Two years ago, I opened a demat account and purchased equity shares from the stock market. Now I want to sell these shares. But I do not have any documents, such as bill, source of money for the share purchase, except for the demat account. Is income tax payable on the gains from selling the shares this year?

 Haradhan Mondal, Calcutta

 Since you are selling the shares after two years of 

 their purchase, you dont have to pay any income 

 tax. The capital gains from the sale of those shares 

 being long-term in nature would be tax-free.

 Unlimited NSC

 My investment in NSC (Rs 1,50,000) will mature in this financial year. I have been showing the investment in my tax returns. If I want to re-invest the maturity amount in NSC, will it be taxable again? What will be the tax implication if I keep it in a savings bank account? This year, I will have an income of Rs 2,00,000 in addition to the NSC amount. Can I make more investment in NSC in a separate account?

 Amit K. Saha, Dum Dum

 You can reinvest your maturity amount in NSC. If you have been showing the interest income on the investment every year as other income in your income tax return, you dont have to pay any tax on maturity. You can buy as many National Savings Certificates as you want. There is no upper limit for NSC investment.

 Diamonds in the dust

 A contrarian looks for stocks that no one wants. Srikumar Bondyopadhyay explains why 

 Conventional wisdom suggests that you ought not to buy into stocks when the market?s main barometer ? the 30-share sensitive index of the Bombay Stock Exchange ? is poised at a lifetime high of 10500.

 But there are others ? the contrarian investors ? who believe that money can be made on stocks that are currently out of investors? favour, but have strong financial fundamentals, good management practices and sound business models.

 Sounds Greek?

 ?At any given point of time, there are stocks in the market which are outperformers and there are underperformers,? says Sanjiv Guha, a fund manager with the country?s largest mutual fund house, UTI Mutual Fund. ?The contrarian investment strategy envisages handpicking these out-of-favour companies, since the potential of a swift and steep price rise in such stocks is higher than that in outperformer stocks. Contrarily, if the market falls from a crest, the decline in prices is less in case of worse performers in a high market than those in outperformers.?

 However, Guha cautions against a blind selection of any worse performer in a buoyant equity market. ?Some of these could be basically a good company with strong financial fundamentals but, for some reason or the other, are out of investors? favour, while some could be just junk companies,? Guha explains. 

 So, weeding out the junks, one can still make a good portfolio comprising the bad performers that have a ?contrarian value? either in the short-term or in the long term. 

 A stock acquires a contrarian value ? the potential of a price rise when there is a decline in the broader market ?owing to the irrational behaviour of investors. 

 Investors in stock markets have a herd mentality. This explains why demand for shares increases when there is a rise in prices ? contrary to the law of demand one reads in the books of economics. 

 Following the herd, investors often dump, though temporarily, some fundamentally sound companies which have been hit by bad news ?economic or non-economic. For instance, pharmaceutical behemoth Ranbaxy caught the disgrace of investors when a British court ruled against it over Pfizer?s patented drug Lipitor. Ranbaxy shares lost more than 17 per cent on the bourses. 

 Reliance shares had a similar plight. When the two Ambani scions came out in the open to wage a bruising battle against each other, Reliance Industries shares took a beating.

 However, Ranbaxy and Reliance both gained the lost ground later on. A contrarian investor would have bought in the beaten down stocks and gained more than investors who bypassed them.

 Others? folly is the contrarians? gains. And these gains, which may take longer to come by, could outperform the market index returns handsomely. 

 A study by UTI Mutual Fund tracking the average annual returns of 12 worst performing stocks of BSE 100 in a given year over the next two years between 1992 and 2003 shows that only on two occasions have they underperformed BSE 100. However, the contra stocks gave an average return of 33 per cent for the 12-year period from 1992 to 2003, against the average return of 15 per cent by the index (see table). And this is factoring in both the bad and good times of the market. 

 If the holding period is increased to three years from two years, the contra stocks outperform the index by almost double the margin. 

 This has attracted SBI Mutual Fund, Tata Mutual Fund, Kotak Mutual Fund and Chola Mutual Fund to launch their contra funds. The latest to join the bandwagon is UTI Mutual Fund. 

 However, company research could be difficult for ordinary investors. They can instead pick only from those stocks that comprise the indices ? for example, BSE 100, BSE 200, Nifty 50, BSE 500 and so on. Index stocks include companies with significant market capitalisation, proven track record and established brand value. So there is slim chance of these becoming junk companies soon. 

 There is another advantage in selecting index stocks. These are generally high dividend paying companies. So the dividend income during a sleeping period further lowers the cost of acquisition, thereby increasing the prospect of higher gains.

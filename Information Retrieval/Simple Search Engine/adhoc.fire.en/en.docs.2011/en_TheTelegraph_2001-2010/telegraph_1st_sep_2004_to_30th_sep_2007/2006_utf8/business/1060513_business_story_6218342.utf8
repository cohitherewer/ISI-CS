 Calcutta, May 12: Texmaco, a K K Birla group company, has reported best ever results for fiscal 2005-06.

 Backed by a strong performance of its divisions, the company has achieved a 29 per cent growth in turnover and a 21 per cent jump in net profit.

 Turnover rose to Rs 392.17 crore from Rs 303.72 crore in the previous year and net profit grew to Rs 19.01 crore from Rs 15.66 crore on a like-to-like basis.

 However, the company had a tax liability of Rs 9.05 crore compared with Rs 1.7 crore in the previous year. Thus, its profit before tax reported a 63 per cent growth.

 The wagon division continues to be its flagship business.

 The company is bullish over the public-private partnership initiative floated by the Indian Railways. It has received substantial orders and several enquiries from industrial users under the Wagon Investment Scheme (WIS). The dedicated freight corridor will also boost demand.

 The steel foundry division has performed well this year. The new foundry set up by the company is expected to be commissioned by July and contribute significantly to Texmacos bottomline and topline.

 Its hydro-mechanical equipment division is executing various orders from NHPC.

 The companys 3-mw mini hydel power project on river Neora in Darjeeling through the joint venture, Neora Hydro Ltd, has been commissioned successfully. So far, this is the first mini hydel power project undertaken by a private company in the eastern region.

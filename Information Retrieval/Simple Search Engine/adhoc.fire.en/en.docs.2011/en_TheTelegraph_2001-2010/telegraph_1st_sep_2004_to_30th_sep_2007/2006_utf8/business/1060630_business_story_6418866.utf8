 East Europe on TCS menu

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, June 29: Tata Consultancy Services Limited (TCS), the first billion-dollar domestic IT company, is eyeing a piece of the eastern European market. At its second annual general meeting held here, TCS chairman Ratan Tata said the company was looking at an extension of IT services to the eastern European market.

 There has to be a critical mass for us to go there. We are looking at the eastern European market, he said.

 The companys integrated IT and BPO offerings are already gaining strong traction in the Latin American market. In 2006-07, TCS has acquired two key customers in the region with a total deal value of over $30 million.

 While the companys maximum revenue still comes from the US, Tata said the percentage of dependence on that market has come down from 80 per cent to 60 per cent now. We are looking at a more global spread, he said. He is also looking at growing TCS into a $10-billion company by 2010.

 Our billing rates are comfortable and there is no dramatic depreciation of margins, he said. The company has 50 subsidiaries and local offices all over the world and 37 of them are profitable. They include offices in Latin America, Japan and South America.

 Tata said he hopes that the first quarter of 2006-07 will be better than last year.

 Our capital expenditure for this year is close to Rs 1,300 crore. Of this, Rs 1,000 crore is for investment in real estate, he added. TCS plans to open campuses in different places and a bulk of the Rs 1,000 crore will go into it.

 Life sciences, telecom and biotechnology are some of the growing verticals, he said. 

 The companys research and development lab in Pune has developed a low-cost water filter for rural areas which uses rice husk as filter.

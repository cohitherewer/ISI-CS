The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Winter chill grips local stocks

 Year 2006 has been another great year for the markets, the fourth year of the current bull run. This rally has been built on a huge build-up of global liquidity that has persisted in spite of considerable tightening by central banks. 

 This liquidity surge has buoyed all asset classes. The Economist commodity price index is up 29.6 per cent in dollar terms this year (till December 15). The metal index is up 50 per cent. Even if the commodity index is computed in euros, a currency that has appreciated sharply against the dollar this year, its still higher by 17.7 per cent. The price of gold is higher by 24.2 per cent since the beginning of the year and crude oil is up 9.5 per cent.

 Back home, after setting a scorching pace since June, the rally seems to be running out of steam. The MSCI India index is in negative territory this month and India has been one of the laggards among emerging markets in the current quarter. Clearly, the high valuations are taking their toll. The nervousness in the market was in full display last week, when, although the other Asian markets recovered quickly from the Thai shock, the rebound in the sensex has been tentative. In contrast, in December last year, the sensex had gained 6.6 per cent.

 Market performance is a combination of two factors corporate performance and liquidity. The high valuations in the Indian market are the result of solid growth in corporate earnings. Left to itself, its quite probable that corporate growth will continue to be very strong going forward. But the RBI has clearly indicated that it wants to slow growth. With elections in several states round the corner, the finance ministry too has started making clucking noises about inflation.

 The latest RBI data show that the year-on-year rate of credit growth is 29.1 per cent, almost the same as it was two months ago. As on December 8, the latest date for which data is available, year-on-year growth in money supply was a very high 20.2 per cent. 

 The deceleration in industrial production in October too appears to have been a blip, with non-oil imports, up 28 per cent in October, accelerating to a growth rate of 40 per cent in November. Inflation continues to be perilously close to the RBIs upper limit of 5.5 per cent. In short, so far there are no signs of a slowdown and the RBI may very well tighten further.

 If it succeeds in slowing growth, it may be difficult to justify Indias high valuations. As a recent Merrill Lynch report points out, the Indian market is trading at a 30 per cent premium to the region.

 Of course, all bets will be off if the US has a hard landing, but the Fed will cut interest rates well before that, adding to liquidity. In fact, global liquidity may well continue to surprise on the upside. The US Fed is done with tightening and the Bank of Japan shows no signs of being in a hurry to raise rates. And if Kamal Nath is right and the Japanese pumping in $10 billion next year, that should ensure that this market continues to rise, despite the RBI.

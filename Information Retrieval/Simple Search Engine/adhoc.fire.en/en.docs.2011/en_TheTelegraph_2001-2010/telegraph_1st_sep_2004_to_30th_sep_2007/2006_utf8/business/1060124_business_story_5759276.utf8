 Fresh hurdle to airport flight path

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Yet to take off

 New Delhi, Jan. 23: The Left parties have sought the intervention of the President and the Prime Minister on the ticklish issue of airport modernisation. The fresh Left offensive came a day before the group of ministers is set to take a final call on the privatisation of Delhi and Mumbai airports.

 The UPAs principal ally wants the job to be given to a special purpose vehicle, which will have the Airports Authority of India and a team of foreign experts on airport development as partners. 

 The latest in a series of Left missives started by the CPM, is a letter from RSP, which supports the original recommendation of the Sreedharan Committee ? modernisation of Delhi and Mumbai airports through an SPV, where AAI and foreign airports could do the job jointly. 

 CPM leader Nilotpal Basu has already made it clear that while his party favours AAI for modernising the existing Delhi and Mumbai airports, the proposed greenfield airports for these two cities could be put up for bidding. 

 The committee of secretaries (CoS), too, has asked the government to consider the SPV-route for airport upgrades. However, it has also suggested allotting the development of the Delhi airport to GMR-Fraport and rebidding for the Mumbai airport.

 Although there are several options offered by the Shreedharan Committee and the CoS, the group of ministers will have a tough job taking a final decision since the Left seems to have decided to challenge if AAI is totally ignored. 

 Left leaders feel that the entire bidding process is skewed, as the AAI has not been allowed to make any presentations on the project. 

 Basu said if developers with no experience in airport building and management could be allowed to team up with foreign airports to bid, there is no reason why AAI with vast experience should not be allowed to access foreign know-how and capital to do the work.

 However, sources said the CoS believes the government should go ahead with the privatisation of the Delhi airport as the Sreedharan Committee has not objected to the selection of GMR-Fraport combine through the competitive bidding process for developing Palam airport.

 New Delhi, Sept. 21: The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) today approved budgetary support of about Rs 395 crore to clear the arrears in Hindustan Steelworks Construction (HSCL) and Bharat Refractories.

 A spokesperson said the support would mitigate the hardship of the employees and motivate them towards the goal of reviving the companies.

 The CCEA also gave the nod for the support of Rs 314.10 crore to ITI to clear the salary backlog and pay off statutory dues.

 The employees of ITI will be able to receive the salary before the Dussheras. ITI will also be able to pay statutory dues, the spokesperson said.

PowerGrid project

 A Power Grid Corporation project to upgrade the transmission facilities in the eastern and the northeastern region at an investment of Rs 975.96 crore was approved by the Cabinet. The spokesperson said there was a component of interest during construction of Rs 45.72 crore in the sum sanctioned by the government. The project will be completed in 36 months.

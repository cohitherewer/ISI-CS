The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 McLeod sells 2.7% stake to prune debt

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Khaitan: Confident

 Calcutta, Sept. 15: McLeod Russel has placed a 2.7 per cent stake with a foreign institutional investor (FII) to reduce debt on its books.

 The move is part of the companys plan to pay off debt worth Rs 200 crore by this fiscal and another Rs 100 crore in 2007-08.

 Todays placement is part of the second tranche McLeod made in as many months. In July, Capital International the FII bought 25 lakh shares at Rs 100 apiece.

 The two deals, that managed to raise Rs 58 crore, come ahead of the Rs 130-crore placement McLeod is planning in October.

 McLeod Russel managing director Aditya Khaitan said the target is to pay debt worth Rs 200 crore by March 31, 2007.

 We will be left with another Rs 100 crore term debt in the next fiscal. That will be paid off from internal generation itself, Khaitan told The Telegraph. Khaitans confidence stems from the fact that tea prices are ruling stronger this season vis--vis last year.

 We have got Rs 9 more per kilo of tea till date from April compared with the same period last year. However, now we are getting Rs 10-11 per kg more than last year, he added.

 Khaitan said the year could end with Rs 10 a kg more on an average.

 According to him, the industry might be staring at a demand-supply mismatch of 30 million kg this year even on a conservative estimate.

 There is likely to be a production shortfall of 10 million kg whereas an increase in consumption would lead to an additional demand.

 As a consequence, next season is expected to start on a strong note.

 Analysts said a good show by the industry might help McLeod get a better price for its placement with qualified institutional bidders (QIB) next month, provided the stock market sentiment remains buoyant as well.

 For instance, the company got a better price in the second tranche of placement with Capital. McLeods stock price hovered around Rs 100 in July compared with Rs 120-130 in September.

Today, the companys stock closed at Rs 125.10 on 

the BSE, Rs 0.70 or 0.56 per cent higher than its previous close.

 Mumbai, Sept. 18: Wockhardt Ltd is joining hands with Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) to set up a special economic zone (SEZ) in Aurangabad. Around Rs 700 crore will be invested over the next four years to set up the SEZ.

 This will be the second SEZ for the pharmaceutical and biotech industry in Maharashtra. Earlier, Serum Institute of India, a leading exporter of vaccines, had announced an investment of Rs 1,200 crore in its biotech SEZ at Pune. The developers Serum Biopharma Park would raise funds through internal accruals and external borrowings from financial institutions.

 A number of pharma SEZs have been given approvals in Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh. Some of the companies that plan to set up SEZs are the Ahmedabad-based Torrent Pharma, Ajanta Pharma, Cadila, Dishma Pharma, Ramky Pharma and Hetero Drugs. The Bangalore-based Biocon will also set up a Rs 650-crore SEZ called Biocon Park.

 An MoU was today signed by Rajiv Jalota, MIDC chief executive officer and Huzaifa Khorakiwala, Wockhardt executive director, in the presence of Maharashtra chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh.

 The SEZ will be spread over 107 hectares leased by MIDC at Shendra. The Wockhardt group will set up a pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical manufacturing and research facility at the SEZ. It will provide employment to an estimated 2,000 people. 

 This SEZ will provide the base for a new thrust in international markets that will drive Wockhardts growth in the coming years, Wockhardt chairman Habil Khorakiwala said. It will make Aurangabad a hub for pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, he added.

 The SEZ will house manufacturing facilities for active pharmaceutical ingredients and biopharmaceuticals, a research and development centre, an effluent treatment plant, a corporate office, warehouse and a residential and recreational complex. 

 Wockhardt has 10 manufacturing facilities, including one in the UK, most of them certified by international regulatory bodies like the US FDA.

 Calcutta, May 27: Foreign direct investment in the country is likely to cross the $12-billion-mark in the current fiscal. 

 During the year ended March 2006, foreign direct investment in the country grew by a whopping 60 per cent to $8.5 billion from $5.3 billion in 2004-05. This may go up to $12 billion in the current financial year, said Ajay Dua, secretary in the department of industrial policy and promotion.

 The government is also shifting its focus to Asian countries such as Singapore, Taiwan and Japan to attract more foreign direct investment into the country. 

 At present, Mauritius has the largest share in the total FDI in India, followed by the US, the European Union, Japan and the Netherlands. This equation, however, may change soon, Dua said. The government is expecting a big jump in foreign direct investment from Singapore, Taiwan, Japan and South Korea. 

 We have a comprehensive treaty with Singapore. The government is launching promotional events in Tokyo to attract investments from Japan, Dua said.

 In the recent past five to six major delegations from Japan have visited India. 

 According to Dua, Taiwan is also taking more interest in the country. Taiwanese shoemaker Apache is setting up a manufacturing facility in Chennai. Foxcon, a telephone handset manufacturer, has proposed to set up a $300-million plant near Chennai. 

 We are also expecting huge investments by Taiwanese companies in our computer hardware industry, Dua said. 

 We will focus on sector-specific and country-specific FDI policy approach, he added. 

 Another interesting aspect of the FDI growth in India is that the share of fresh equity capital in the overall capital flow has been increasing at a faster pace. 

 Foreign direct investments have three components ? fresh equity investment, reinvestment of profits or a part of it instead of repatriating the same, and investments brought in for paying the workmens compensation for relocation and other such purposes not related to equity investment, said Dua. 

 Among the three components, equity investments have increased to $5.4 billion in 2005-06 from $3.1 billion in the previous year. We are expecting it to grow to around $8 billion in the current financial year, he added.

 As much as 70 per cent of the overall foreign direct investment in the country went to the manufacturing sector. 

 To foster foreign direct investment in the country, the government is also simplifying procedures and regulatory framework. The industry ministry has assigned C-DAC to implement an electronic system, called e-biz, for providing a single-window delivery for all government approvals and clearances required to set up business in India. 

 It requires at least 15 different approvals from the central government (from different departments and ministries) and seven state government clearances. Through e-biz, one needs to provide information only once and does not need to run from one department to another. The approvals will also be delivered electronically, Dua explained. 

 According to him, C-DAC will implement e-biz by March 2007 in consortia with a few other information technology companies, including Microsoft and Reliance. As of now four state government have signed up for the e-biz project. These include Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Haryana and Andhra Pradesh, Dua said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Trying luck at job fair

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Dec. 9: Test of IQ was the main stay on Day IV of Infocom 2006 at the 100,000 sq-ft exhibition arena at the Helipad grounds in the Salt Lake Stadium. 

 As thousands of young people trooped into the tech expo, some put their minds to win prizes at the Quizzit 06, others aimed at employment opportunities, up for grabs at The Telegraph Job Mart.

 Over 3,000 aspirants registered on the first day of two-day Job Mart, a special attraction of Infocom 2006. HR representatives from companies like Google and Genpact had tough time dealing with the flow of prospective candidates. 

 Initially, we had planned to conduct interviews here. But because of the rush, we are doing initial screenings and will continue with the final interviews later, said a representative at the Genpact stall. 

 The jobs up for grab at Job Mart range from customer care and sales in Dell, advertisement executive in Google and technical support and IT services in Genpact.

 If it was serious Q amp;A at the Job Mart, the venue for Quizzit 06 was full of fun and frolic. Over 1,300 people came in to participate in general rounds of the quiz, said an organiser. 

 The grand finale of the CTS quiz, in association with Greycaps and the International Group, will be held on Sunday.

 I am visiting the stalls which are offering IT jobs to look for the ideal placement, said Pamela Ghosh, fourth year B-Tech student, Techno India.

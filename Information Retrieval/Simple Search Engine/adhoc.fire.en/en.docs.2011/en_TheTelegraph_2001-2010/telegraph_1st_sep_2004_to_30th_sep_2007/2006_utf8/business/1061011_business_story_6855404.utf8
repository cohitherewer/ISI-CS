 Three on Bharti retail ally list

 Mittal: Showing the way

 Oct. 10: Bharti Enterprises is close to finalising a foreign partner for its grocery retail chain. Negotiations are on with Wal-Mart of the US, Carrefour of France and Tesco of Britain.

 Britains top retailer Tesco, with non-food sourcing operations in Bangalore, is reportedly the frontrunner in the deal.

 We are in the final stages of choosing a partner, Bharti chairman Sunil Bharti Mittal said at a conference in London.

 Tesco is on the list of companies being considered, said company officials.

 If the deal is struck, the Bharti-Tesco venture could witness an initial investment of about Rs 460 crore which could increase to Rs 9,200 crore over the next five years, sources said.

 The Bharti-Tesco venture is expected to be spearheaded by Tesco veteran Gary Sargent, sources added.

 Bharti already has a presence in the agriculture sector with FieldFresh Foods, a joint venture with the Rothschild group; Tesco already uses FieldFresh as a supplier for fresh products in its own supermarkets all over the world.

 This makes Tesco an extremely suitable candidate for the proposed joint venture, said industry analysts.

 The countrys retail industry is estimated at about Rs 1.3 lakh crore and is forecast to grow to Rs 2 lakh crore by 2010 and Rs 3 lakh crore by 2015.

 The government has so far allowed only single-brand foreign companies to own 51 per cent of retail joint ventures.

 Multiple-branded companies like Wal-Mart and Tesco are still barred at the retail level though not in the wholesale segment.

 The only way that global firms can open stores is through franchises and licensees, or a cash-and-carry model, chosen by Metro AG and Shoprite Holdings.

 Tesco, plans to open a chain of supermarkets in India, similar to Tesco supermarkets across the globe in terms of size and product portfolio, stocking fresh fruits and vegetables.

 The company said it aimed to have 60 per cent of its group space outside Britain by the end of this year. 

 But, for now, Tesco is very clearly focusing on building up capabilities in the country and preparing for a strong presence in the Indian market until the FDI rules in retail are relaxed, said company officials.

 Ficci secretary-general Amit Mitra told reporters in London that Tesco should expand into cash and carry wholesale in order to crack the multi-billion-dollar Indian market.

 Vodafone stake

 Bharti Enterprises said on Tuesday it was not keen on selling a further stake in its telecom business to Britain-based mobile phone giant Vodafone. There is nothing on sale, Mittal said.

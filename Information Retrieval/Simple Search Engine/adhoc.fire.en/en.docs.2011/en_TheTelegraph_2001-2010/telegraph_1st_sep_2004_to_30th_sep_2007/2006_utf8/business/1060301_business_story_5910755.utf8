 Cigarette firms suffer burns

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Feb. 28: A puff 

 will cost more after the budget.

 The woe of the cigarette industry continues with the finance minister proposing to raise the excise duty by another 5 per cent while leaving out all other forms of tobacco consumption.

 As a result, cigarette, which already attracts 130 per cent excise duty on the ex-factory price, would further be taxed while bidi, gutka, snuff and pan masala would dodge the net.

 Reacting to the budget proposal, Y.C. Deveshwar, chairman of ITC Ltd, pointed out only cigarette has been singled out.

 All forms of tobacco consumption should be brought under excise duty, Deveshwar said.

 The cigarette industry contributed over Rs 7,000 crore in excise revenue last year.

 Back-of-the-envelop calculation says this increase would swell the governments kitty by another Rs 350 crore.

 Even though cigarette manufacturers are yet to take a call, it is almost certain that the retail prices will increase, going by past experience.

 The hike would be brand-specific, depending on the strategy taken by individual companies. 

 Udayan Lal, director of Tobacco Institute of India (TII), said the effort would not meet the social objective of the government to curb consumption of tobacco.

 Historical records say there has been increase in tobacco consumption whenever duties were increased following the hike in excise duty. 

 Cigarette accounts for 14 per cent of total tobacco consumed, it contributes to 84 per cent of the revenue from the sector.

 According to a recent study carried out by the institute, consumption of cigarettes has gone down by 20 per cent in the last 15 years.

 The rise in excise duty would also result in increase in consumption of a form of tobacco (bidi) which was revenue inefficient, Lal added

 Biri sells about 8 times more than cigarette.

 The budget proposal shows duty on filter cigarette (less than 70 mm length) will be increased by Rs 40 per 1,000 sticks.

 Likewise, in case of sticks between 70 mm and 75 mm, the rate will go up by Rs 60; for 75-85 mm, the increase is Rs 80, while for others, the increase is Rs 100.

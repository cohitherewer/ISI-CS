 Tinplate expansion in the works

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 11: The Tinplate Co of India Ltd is considering setting up a cold rolling mill (CRM) at an investment of Rs 400-450 crore.

 The Tata Steel subsidiary is carrying out a due diligence and a decision could be taken in six months, managing director B.L. Raina said after the 87th annual general meeting of the company. 

 The CRM plant would be in line with the companys strategy to fully integrate operations, he added.

 Tinplate is expanding its tinplate capacity to 180,000 tonnes per annum this fiscal. It would then set up another tinning line of 200,000 tonnes by April 2008 at Jamshedpur, taking the total capacity to 380,000 tonnes.

 As a result, the company needs to ramp up the production of tin mill black plate, which is derived from cold rolling mills.

 Since the production of tin mill black plate is limited, producers do charge a little more. If we have the setup, it will save us from extra cost, Raina said.

 The company could set up a production line of 150,000 tonnes for tin mill black plate.

 Tinplate procures hot-rolled coil from Tata Steel and then cold rolls it.

 Tinplate chairman B. Muthuraman said the company would focus on retaining market share by getting closer to consumers.

 To achieve this, it has set up a Solution Centre equipped with state-of-the-art printing and lacquering facilities.

 The company is taking these initiatives at a time when it has came back on the dividend list after almost 10 years. The board has recommended a 12.5 per cent payout for 2005-06.

 The company has a 40 per cent share in the Indian tinplate market. After the expansion, its share will go up to 60 per cent.

 In 2005-06, Tinplate posted its best ever results with profit after tax going up to Rs 48.96 crore from a turnover of Rs 415 crore.

 Tinplate has posted a 23 per cent growth in profit before tax at Rs 39.5 crore in 2005-06 compared with Rs 32.13 crore in the previous year. 

 The Tata Steel subsidiarys topline grew by 58 per cent to Rs 415.39 crore from Rs 263.48 crore in the previous year.

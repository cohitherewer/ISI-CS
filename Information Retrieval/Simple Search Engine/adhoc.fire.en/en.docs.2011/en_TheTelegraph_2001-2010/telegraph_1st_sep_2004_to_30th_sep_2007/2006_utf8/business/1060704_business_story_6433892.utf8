 July date for airport hearing 

 New Delhi, July 3 (PTI): The Supreme Court today fixed July 18 for hearing a petition filed by Anil Ambani Groups Reliance Airport Developers, which has challenged a Delhi High Court order upholding the governments decision to allot modernisation works of Mumbai and Delhi airports to rival bidders GMR and GVK-led consortia.

 A bench headed by Chief Justice Y.K. Sabharwal fixed the date after the parties agreed to it.

 Reliance counsel Manali Singhal requested the court for an early hearing as the rival consortia were already proceeding with the construction work at the airports.

 The court would look into various issues, including the allegations about lowering of standards and giving choice to the rival bidder to pick an airport for modernisation after the financial bids were opened.

 Merc jams brakes on local S350

 GARIMA SINGH

 Road rage

 Mumbai, June 20: Mercedes is getting ready to roll out its spanking new, home-built S350 ? but if you have been waiting for one, tough luck, you?ll have to wait some more.

 Reason: the company has slammed shut its booking window even before it handed over the keys of its first locally-built S350 to a customer. The window will not open until early next year. 

 The S-350 was launched in January and was initially imported as a completely built unit (CBU). The petrol version of the model carries a sticker price of between Rs 75 lakh and Rs 78 lakh. The locally produced model ? which will be manufactured at DaimlerChrysler India?s Pimpri plant ? is expected to sport a price tag ranging between Rs 72 lakh and Rs 75 lakh.

 The S350 appears set to revive interest in the teutonic badge, which had flagged somewhat in the face of competition from other marques, notably BMW.

 ?Production started nearly two months back and about 20 to 25 units of the S350 have already rolled out from the factory. The response is tremendous and we have received a lot of enquiries. However, we don?t plan to take any more bookings until the beginning of next year,? said a company official. 

 The production of the old S350, which sold 144 units last year, has stopped. 

 In January this year, DCI launched two versions of its flagship model, the Mercedes S-Class ? S350 and S500. Since then, the company has sold 28 units of S350 CBUs and 16 units of S500 CBUs. 

 Globally, the S-class model series has sold 500,000 units. 

 Meanwhile, DaimlerChrsyler India is hoping to complete the homologation process for the M Class vehicle shortly.

 DCI is also aiming to target mining companies with its latest offering ? the Actros. The company is in the process of scouting for dealers. Till it finds some, it will sell the trucks on its own.

 ?It is a new category we are entering into and are extremely positive about it. In India, we see huge potential and growing demand for this vehicle. There are a lot of companies that have expressed a great deal of interest in purchasing them. However, it will be difficult to project annual sales just yet,? said Suhas Kadlaskar, head of corporate affairs and finance, DCI. 

 The Indian truck market, which is dominated by Tata Motors in value terms, is estimated at $3 billion (Rs 13,500 crore) at present. 

 The entry of Actros in the market assumes significance since DaimlerChrysler?s arch rival MAN has plans to make India a manufacturing base for local markets and exports. 

 MAN has tied up with its local partner Force Motors to set up a facility for manufacturing trucks at Pithampur in Madhya Pradesh. DCI, which sold 2,019 units in the last calendar year, sold 876 units during January to May. This includes the C, E and S class of vehicles and the CBUs.

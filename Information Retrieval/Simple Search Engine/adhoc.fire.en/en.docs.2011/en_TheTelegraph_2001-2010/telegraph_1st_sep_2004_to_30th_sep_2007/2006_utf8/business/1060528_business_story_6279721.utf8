 Anil Ambani group gets new identity

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, May 27: Less than six months after a new group was carved out of the mighty business empire that Dhirubhai Ambani built, younger son Anil today gave a new corporate identity to his conglomerate with a new logo and a signature tune that reflect the ambitious plans he has across various business lines.

 The new logo ? which reportedly has taken nine months to fashion ? will replace the ubiquitous R symbol that represents the Reliance group. Sources said though the Reliance-Anil Dhirubhai Ambani group had the right to use this symbol under the demerger agreement, they decided to go in for a new look.

 The new symbol consists of the word Reliance and spells out its lineage ? Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group ? in a combination of red and blue colours. This new symbol will be launched across Anil Ambanis group companies from tomorrow. It will be initially visible in six major metros of the country.

 On the eve of the launch of the new corporate identity, an exercise that may see the group spending over Rs 400 crore, chairman Anil Ambani urged the groups employees, through a webcast, to celebrate the spirit of teamwork that lies at the heart of it.

 Starting today, we will have opportunity to get closer to our new identity, to reflect on the philosophy behind it. While embarking on this truly momentous journey, I look forward to working with each one of you ? as we give life, body and soul to our new identity, our new vision ? together, he said. 

 Ambani termed the new symbol as Reliance Apex, which he said, is an embodiment of hope, optimism and success. According to him, while the Reliance typeface is a unique combination of upper and lower case characters representing the groups essential openness and accessibility, the colours of blue and red convey values of integrity, confidence, optimism, energy and passion.

 Surface couriers are M amp;A targets

 Out of the box

 Mumbai, Oct. 25: Mergers and acquisitions in the domestic express courier industry are gaining ground with new players scouting for potential targets in the surface transport space. DHLs acquisition of Blue Dart Express, Anil Ambanis 44 per cent stake in DTDC Courier and Cargo or the recent deal involving TNT and Speedage Express Cargo Services is not the end of the road for mergers and acquisitions in this industry.

 While Federal Express (Fedex) and Exel belonging to the DHL house are looking for fresh targets, the focus of attention has now shifted. As many of the domestic companies have already ramped up their infrastructure on the aerial front by bringing their own cargo aircraft, they are now setting their sights on completing the infrastructure setup by having a good road network as well.

 The multinationals, who seem to have taken the lead as far as consolidation goes, have much better infrastructure when it comes to cargo aircraft. However, they suffer on the surface side. It is this deficiency that they now want to correct. Over the next few months, we may find express companies having an excellent road network being courted by the big MNCs, says an industry insider. He adds that the road-based express segment in India is projected to more than quadruple in the coming decade.

 The trend may have already begun. Sources say the acquisition of Speedage Express Cargo Services by TNT in February only goes to show this new trend. The acquisition will add 514 depots, 26 transit hubs, and 1,195 employees to TNTs existing resources. It will also add 730 vehicles to its fleet, enabling the Dutch postal company to offer a comprehensive network covering all parts of India. 

 The buzz is that Anil Ambanis Reliance ADAG, through its private equity arm, is in talks to acquire a significant stake in Patel Roadways. This will be the groups second major investment in logistics.

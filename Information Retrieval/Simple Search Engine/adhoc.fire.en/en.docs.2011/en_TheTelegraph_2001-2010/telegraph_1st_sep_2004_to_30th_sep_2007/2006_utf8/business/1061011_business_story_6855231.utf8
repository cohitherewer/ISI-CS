 Mumbai, Oct. 10: Trent Ltd, the retail venture of the Tatas, informed stock exchanges today that it is planning to raise up to Rs 285 crore through a preferential issue of equity shares with attached warrants to the promoters and thereafter a rights issue to all shareholders. 

 In a statement today, the company said, the earlier proposal to have a simultaneous but unlinked rights issue of non-convertible bonds with warrants has been dropped. 

 The quantum of the preferential issue of equity shares will not exceed 5 per cent of the existing equity share capital. The quantum of warrants to be issued on preferential basis will also not exceed 5 per cent of the existing share capital, it added. 

 While the preferential issue will be allotted during the current financial year, the warrants will have the right to subscribe only in the next fiscal. The total amount mopped up through this issue is expected to be between Rs 100 crore and Rs 120 crore over the two financial years. 

 Immediately after the preferential issue to the promoters, it has been decided to issue equity shares on a rights basis to the existing shareholders in the ratio of 1:5 at a price of Rs 500 per share, the company said. The issue size is estimated to range between Rs 152 crore and Rs 165 crore. 

 In July 2005, the company had made a rights issue of partly convertible debentures with detachable warrants. These warrants have a right to subscribe to equity shares on payment of Rs 650 per share after completion of 54 months from the date of allotment.

 The terms of the earlier issue also provided that in the event the company makes a further issue of shares on rights basis, the warrant holder will have an option to exercise his right to subscribe to shares prior to the new rights Issue. 

 Shares of Trent, a retailer that operates a chain of stores under the brand name Westside, closed at Rs 861.45, up 0.12 per cent on the BSE.

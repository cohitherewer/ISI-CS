The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Bengal offers Boeing landing strip

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Long haul

 Mumbai, Jan. 31: Bengal is making a strong pitch to persuade Boeing, the Seattle-based aerospace giant, to locate its proposed aircraft maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) facility in Calcutta.

 Calcutta is one of the destinations that Boeing is assessing for its facility that will involve an investment of at least $100 million.

 Dinesh A. Keskar, senior vice-president (sales) of Boeing Commercial Aircraft, said the Bengal government had approached the company with a request to locate the facility there. Six states, including Maharashtra, Kerala and Delhi, have expressed interest in the project. 

 ?We have shown interest in the project. The civil aviation ministry has set up a committee for the project and we have approached Boeing. However, we are yet to get in touch with Boeing officials and make a detailed presentation,? Bengal industry secretary Sabyasachi Sen said.

 The state is ready to provide all the required incentives to the project, including the 100-150 acres of land required near the airport. 

 ?We will know their detailed requirements once we meet the company officials. Nevertheless, we are prepared to give them whatever it takes to woo them. We are aware that the project will require a huge tract of land. We can provide them the same near our airport,? Sen said. 

 The MRO facility is a part of the concessions given by Boeing during its negotiations for Air-Indias order of 68 aircraft worth $10.7 billion.

 In addition to monetary concessions of over Rs 1,000 crore, Boeing had committed $205 million worth of investment, which includes four training simulators costing $75 million, MRO facilities for Boeing planes up to $100 million, training and other civil aviation requirements worth $10 million. 

 Maharashtra chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh had made a presentation to the company officials in Seattle and invited them to invest in Maharashtra. Boeing officials have already visited Nagpur to explore the possibility of setting up the MRO facility at the proposed Multimodal International Hub Airport. 

 ?We are weighing all the options and should take a final decision by April based on the incentives that would be offered by each state for the infrastructure,? Keskar said. 

 Boeing is also exploring the possibilities of including joint venture partners for the project.

 ?We could take local airlines as potential partners. We have also been approached by major infrastructure companies and other overseas players for the project,? he added.

 Boeing expects close to 500 commercial aircraft orders valued at $36 billion from India over the next 20 years, Keskar said.

 ?Boeing expects India to place an order for 492 civilian aircraft over the next 20 years... The order size would be around $36 billion,? he told reporters.

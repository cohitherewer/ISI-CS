 Koutons tailors growth 

 New Delhi, July 23 (PTI): Bullish on the domestic demand, garment manufacturer Koutons Retail India Ltd expects its topline to cross Rs 1,000 crore in the next two years and is mulling a foray into readymade womens wear.

 Last year, we clocked a turnover of Rs 160 crore and for the current fiscal we have a target of Rs 400 crore. In the next two years, we are poised to achieve a turnover Rs 1,000 crore, executive vice-president H.S. Sidhu said.

 The company has experienced a CAGR growth of 130 per cent in the last three years and there was every possibility that the Rs 1,000 target would be achieved, he said.

 The mens apparel manufacturer plans to invest Rs 75 crore during the current fiscal to expand the capacity to 1 crore garments from 30 lakh at present.

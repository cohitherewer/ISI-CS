The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Arcelor-Mittal deal in the works

 AMIT ROY 

 London, June 23: The board of Arcelor will meet on Sunday to discuss a merger with Mittal Steel, a spokesperson for the Luxembourg-based steel company said in London today. 

 What the outcome will be is hard to predict but Lakshmi Mittal himself told The Telegraph last night: I am confident. 

 The Arcelor spokesperson would not be drawn any further than to say: The Arcelor board will meet on Sunday to discuss whatever is on the table. Mittal Steel have said they are engaged in constructive talks and they are taking the lead on this one. We are continuing to talk with Mittal Steel. 

 For his part, Mittal confided that he had been encouraged by the support from India and that was especially grateful to Kamal Nath who was the first minister to support me. 

 I felt very confident after that, he commented. With Arcelor there is a corporate battle being waged. 

 There was speculation in London today that the talks between the two steel giants may or may not lead to an agreed offer. 

 Some sources have said Mittal is likely to raise its 23.2 billion euro ($29.19 billion) offer to win support from Arcelors board, which is meeting on Sunday to decide between Mittals bid and a deal to acquire Russias Severstal. 

 Another source suggested that Mittal might accept taking a minority stake in the merged group. It was also said that Mittal might be prepared to make concessions on the industrial plan in addition to governance. 

 Meanwhile, Bloomberg, the business news agency, quoted Sudhir Maheshwari, Mittals managing director for business development and treasury, as saying some parts of the offer in principle have been agreed. 

 Arcelor chief Guy Dolle, after five months of resistance, is moving closer to Mittal as shareholders object to a defence strategy that includes an agreement to combine with Russias Severstal, Bloomberg also reported. 

 Todays Financial Times said Mittal might increase his offer by 3 billion euros. Dolle said in New York he wants a higher offer from Mittal, signalling he may yet recommend an agreement, according to the Financial Times. 

 Mittal is now offering to give Arcelor shareholders more than half the new companys shares and keep Dolle as CEO, according to the Wall Street Journal. 

 Meanwhile, the French daily la Tribune said price was the only outstanding issue. A price of 43 euros per share is now on the table, la Tribune said without identifying its sources.

 Meanwhile, Mittal Steel said shares representing 0.2 per cent of Arcelor were tendered to its hostile $30 billion takeover bid as of June 22, according to Bloomberg.

 Reliance Petro in $1.5-bn loan hunt

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Aug. 11: Reliance Petroleum (RPL) will raise $1.5 billion through a syndicated loan from the international market. The proceeds will be used to finance RPLs 580,000 barrels-per-day refinery and a 0.9-million-tonne-per-annum polypropylene unit at Jamnagar in Gujarat. 

 RPL today said the loan comprises a $950-million, 7.5-year tranche and a $550-million, 10-year tranche. 

 This fund is the largest offshore syndicated loan being raised by India Inc and the 10-year maturity is the longest duration for an overseas corporate term debt issue. 

 The loan tenor of 10 years is expected to open a new window for corporate houses since the duration of offshore syndicated loans is usually between five and seven years. The loan will help Reliance attain quick financial closure for the new refinery. 

 The size and tenor of the transaction demonstrates the confidence of the international banking community in Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) and its impressive track record for the timely execution of large complex projects, a company release said.

 A group of 14 lead arrangers will manage the issue. These include ABN Amro, Bank of America, Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi, BNP Paribas, Calyon, Citigroup Global Singapore Markets, DBS Bank, ICICI Bank, Standard Chartered Bank, State Bank of India, HSBC and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation. 

 Under syndication that started today, the lead arrangers will invite banks to participate in the fund raising of the borrower. The process will end in early October.

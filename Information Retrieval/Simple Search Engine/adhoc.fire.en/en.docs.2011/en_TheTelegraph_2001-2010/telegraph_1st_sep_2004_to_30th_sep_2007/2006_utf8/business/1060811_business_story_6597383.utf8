 Govt ready for big fight over Balco

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 10: The government is game for a round of sparring with Anil Agarwal before the arbitration panel on the sale of residual shares of Bharat Aluminium (Balco) to Sterlite which is now part of Agarwals Vedanta Group.

 Top officials said, We want to go before a panel, partly because that is provided for in the agreement we entered into with Sterlite when shares were sold to it. And partly because we are sure that we will win. No pact can supercede Indian law as it stands and that is what the attorney-general has ruled.

 Sterlite had recently sent a cheque of Rs 1,100 crore to the government to buy out the remaining 49 per cent stake in Balco, invoking the shareholders agreement that allowed it the right to place a call option after a certain period of time. Sterlite had earlier acquired 51 per cent of Balco from the government in a controversial deal with the previous NDA government.

 Sterlites persistent attempts to buy the rump Balco holdings were rebuffed by the attorney-general who ruled the call option was untenable under Indian laws and made adverse comments on the mode of fixing the price of the residual shares.

 The attorney-general had categorically stated that from the Companies Act 1956 and the Indian Contract Act 1872 it can be said the provision of valuation date and call option do not survive and consequently M/s Sterlite cannot exercise option or bind the government of India to accept the same.

 The attorney-general had said it would not be in public interest to sell the shares at a price determined by SBI Caps as it entails a loss to the exchequer. 

 To reiterate, it is imperative and advisable for the government to obtain a fair valuation on a current date to ensure that the best price is secured for the shares, if at all the government decides to divest, the attorney-general said.

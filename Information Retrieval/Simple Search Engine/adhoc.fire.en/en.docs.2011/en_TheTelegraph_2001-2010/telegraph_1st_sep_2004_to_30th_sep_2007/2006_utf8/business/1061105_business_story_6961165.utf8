 S Kumars sees scope abroad

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Nov. 4: After venturing into home textiles through its brand Carmichael House, S Kumars Nationwide is looking overseas to ramp up its presence in this segment. 

 The textile company today announced that its board will meet on November 9 to consider and discuss acquiring a US firm in the home textiles space. 

 Although S Kumars did not reveal further details, it is understood that the company is focussing on American Pacific, a home furnishing firm that supplies products to brands such as Nautica and Liz Claiborne. While reports peg the acquisition price at over Rs 450 crore, it comes after the companys promoter sold his stake to a private equity fund, Genstar. S Kumars will now purchase this stake. 

 Apart from enlarging its product basket in home textile, the acquisition will provide S Kumars an entry into retail stores in the US. 

 Last month, the company board had approved an issue of equity shares, fully convertible debentures/partly convertible debentures or securities other than warrants which are convertible into or exchangeable with shares to qualified institutional buyers for up to Rs 300 crore to fund acquisitions and expansion. As the home textiles segment has been one of the best performers since quotas were done away with last year, S Kumars has been concentrating on the segment for the past few months. 

 The company has unveiled plans to increase capacity by setting up a manufacturing plant in Gujarat next year, with an investment of Rs 450 crore. The unit will produce 30 million metres of home textiles such as bed linen, bath linen, table and kitchen linen, curtains and upholstery. On the other hand, for Carmaichael House, which was launched in August this year, the plan is to have a chain of 24 stores.

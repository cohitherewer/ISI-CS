 ONGC gets ready for methane hunt

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 18: The ONGC board of directors has approved an investment of Rs 950 crore for exploration and development of six coal bed methane blocks in Bengal and Jharkhand.

 The countdown for the first commercial production of coal bed methane in the country has now begun with the gas being scheduled for production in June 2007. An estimated peak production of 7.84 lakh cubic metres of gas per day is being targeted from the proposed wells.

 A sum of Rs 557 crore of the projected expenditure has been earmarked for the development of early coal bed methane (CBM) production in Central Parbatpur area of the Jharia block.

 An investment of Rs 392 crore has been approved for drilling, completion and testing of 22 pilot wells in Jharia, Bokaro and North Karanpura CBM blocks, scheduled to be completed in 31 months.

 Coal bed methane is a low-pressure gas that is normally not transported over long distances but used in the local area in which it is produced. Like natural gas, it can be used for generating power and as a feedstock for producing fertilisers.

 The Jharia CBM block is located within the Jharia coalfield, around 25 km east of Bokaro steel city. The total area of the Jharia block is 84.5 square km, out of which the Parbatpur area comprises 18 square km, and the area under the present production scheme is 6 square km.

 ONGC plans to deploy advanced drilling technology, which involves horizontal-inseam-multilateral drilling technique for the first time in India, after its proven success by CBM operators in Australia and the US.

 The Jharia block is jointly held by ONGC with a 74 per cent stake and Coal India (CIL) holding the remaining 26 per cent. The Raniganj block in Bengal in which ONGC has a 90 per cent stake and CIL 10 per cent is also included in the exploration and development plan.

 The other blocks included in the plan are ? Bokaro (ONGC 80 per cent, Indian Oil 20 per cent) and North Karanpura (ONGC 80 per cent, Indian Oil 20 per cent), South Karanpura and North Karanpura-West in Jharkhand in which ONGC has a 100 per cent stake.

 So far, ONGC has secured nine out of the 16 blocks awarded by the government.

 Different operators of CBM use different proprietary techniques for CBM drilling. ONGC chose the horizontal-inseam-multilateral technique after discussions with global operators.

 A comparative analysis of various drilling techniques like the Z-Pinnet technology, radial-horizontal-multilateral technology and dimaxian-horizontal drilling technology, revealed that in poor-permeability coal, horizontal-inseam-multilateral drilling has the capability to enhance the CBM production by 10-20 times, in comparison to drilling conventional vertical wells.

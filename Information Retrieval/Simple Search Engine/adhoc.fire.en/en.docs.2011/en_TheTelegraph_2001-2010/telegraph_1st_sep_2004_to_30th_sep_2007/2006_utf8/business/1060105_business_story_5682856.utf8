 Dye cast for BASF in bid for US pigment company

 RIGHT CHEMISTRY 

 Frankfurt/New York, Jan. 4 (Reuters): BASF AG has made a $4.9-billion hostile, all-cash offer for US pigment and chemicals maker Engelhard Corp, aiming to become the worlds leading producer of pollution control materials, the German chemicals company said on Tuesday.

 BASF said its $37 a share offer ? at nearly a 23 per cent premium over Engelhards December 30 closing price ? was unlikely to meet any significant regulatory hurdles.

 A bellwether for the industry and the worlds top chemical company by sales, BASF said it had sufficient cash and financing flexibility to fund the acquisition.

 However, BASF told an investors call that Engelhard has a poison pill plan that could allow the company to block the acquisition.

 Later in the day, Engelhard issued a statement confirming BASFs offer and asking its shareholders not to take action in response to the unsolicited takeover bid.

 The company said its board of directors would consider the German chemical makers proposal and then make a recommendation to shareholders.

 By acquiring the Iselin, New Jersey company, BASF will gain a leader in the growing area of catalysts used to cut car emissions and help chemical plants and refineries run more efficiently.

 Engelhard notched sales of $3.3 billion during the first nine months of 2005 and has a strong research pipeline, BASF said, adding that tightening pollution standards and a booming energy market could make Engelhard products very lucrative.

 We view this market as being highly attractive, with significant growth potential, BASF chief executive Juergen Hambrecht told investors in a call following the announcement.

 Automotive catalysts alone are a $2.5-billion global market with 4 per cent annual growth over the last five years, BASF noted. In addition, it said taking over Engelhard would reduce the cyclical nature of BASFs earnings.

 Still, shares in BASF ended down 1.4 per cent at 63.90 euros in Frankfurt compared with a 0.2 per cent gain by the broader DAX index. 

 It will be tough to explain the deal to investors, a trader said. The short-term share price reaction will be negative.

 Meanwhile, Engelhards shares soared 26 per cent to close at $38 on the New York Stock Exchange.

 BASF, which had a friendly offer rebuffed, said it was prepared to raise its bid if Engelhard could show that there was more value in the companys business than was discernible from publicly available information.

 That might enable BASF to increase the price it proposes to pay for Engelhard by $1 per share, BASF said.

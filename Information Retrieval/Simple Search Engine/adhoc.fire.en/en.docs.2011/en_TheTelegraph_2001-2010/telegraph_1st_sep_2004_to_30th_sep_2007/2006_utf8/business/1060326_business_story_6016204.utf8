 Honda honcho to step down

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 25: Rajive Saharia, marketing head of Honda Siel Cars India Limited (HSCIL), will quit the company by the month-end.

 Saharias decision comes a day after another automobile honcho B.V.R Subbu decided to quit Hyundai Motors. 

 Saharia, who plans to manufacture auto components in association with a European company, said ?it is something that I have always wanted to do. A feasibility study is on. It will take another three to four months for all details to crystallise.?

 He, however, declined to divulge details on how soon the venture will take off and the level of investment involved.

 Saharia said his decision was a ?well-thought? one, after having served the Honda group for nearly 14-15 years. 

 ?My journey with the Honda group has been a fabulous one. I look back at it with a lot of satisfaction. Honda has been a great place to work and has provided me a huge opportunity to learn and to perform. The work culture and environment here has been extremely conducive,? Saharia told The Telegraph. 

 Before joining HSCIL in 1997, he served Honda for four years in West Asia and two years in Japan.

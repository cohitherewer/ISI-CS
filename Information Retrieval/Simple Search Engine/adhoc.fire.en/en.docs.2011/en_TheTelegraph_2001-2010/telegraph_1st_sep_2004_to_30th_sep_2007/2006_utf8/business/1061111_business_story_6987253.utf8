 Govt mulls Hind Zinc rump stake sale

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 10: The Centre seems set to revive its divestment agenda by exploring the possibility of selling its residual shares in Hindustan Zinc Limited.

 Foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee has been vested with the responsibility of reviving the process, which was put on hold last September after the Congress and the DMK opposed the divestment of government shares in Nalco and Neyveli Lignite. A formal order authorising Mukherjee is likely to be issued shortly.

 Hindustan Zinc was chosen because it is considered a non-controversial venture and 26 per cent of the governments equity was offloaded in March 2002 by the erstwhile NDA government in favour of Sterlite Opportunities and Ventures Ltd and Sterlite Optical Technologies Ltd. The shares were sold for Rs 445 crore at Rs 40 to 50 per share.

 Today, each share of this company is valued at Rs 964.60 on the Bombay Stock Exchange.

 The government is keen to sell off its residual shares in the company. If necessary, Mukherjee will speak to the Left parties.

 Sources said the government would try and go about the exercise cautiously without provoking adverse reactions from the Left or other UPA constituents.

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has already told Congress president Sonia Gandhi that if the government was to mop up funds for the various social sector programmes, divestment was inevitable.

 Pharmacy gulps growth pill 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Booster dose

 Mumbai, April 6: Medicine Shoppe, the chain of pharmacy stores which forms part of the $75-billion Cardinal Health Inc, wants to ramp up its presence in India from 100 stores to 700 by 2010. The company also plans to introduce some over-the-counter (OTC) products in the country, as the operations here reach a critical mass.

 Medicine Shoppe, which follows a franchisee model, has set an immediate target of becoming a 200 plus pharmacy chain by the year-end. The blue-print of 700 stores would encompass a presence in rural areas as well. The firm is forecasting a strong boom in organised pharmacy retailing over the next five years as baby boomers start ageing and the consumption of chronic and preventive medications shoot up.

 Medicine Shoppe India is managed by master licensee Melrose Trading Co Pvt Ltd. Though it is pitted against the might of more than 8 lakh chemists in the country, the company is optimistic of capturing the customer attention as India is likely to go the way of the western world. 

 Medicine Shoppe is also banking on the government giving its permission to foreign direct investment in retail. According to the company, while it is now the preferred pharmacy chain for all major supermarkets, the numbers will swell as more retail chains are allowed by the government.

 Announcing its growth plans for the country today, Bruce Burnett, vice-president and international business head, Medicine Shoppe, said the company also plans to introduce some OTC products (cough syrup, aspirin) over the course of next few months. These products, which carries its own label, will be sourced from other companies. 

 This apart, there are plans to open more super specialty pharmacy stores in the country, which will hawk medicines for cancer, organ transplant, HIV, hepatitis, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, cardiac problems and other critical illness. Recently, Medicine Shoppe India opened its first super specialty pharmacy in Mumbai and the plan is to add five more cities that include Delhi, Bangalore, Pune, Hyderabad and Chennai during this fiscal.

 Medicine Shoppe India (managed by Melrose), is looking at bringing in another financial partner. Actis, had earlier invested close to $ 1 million in the company and this was followed by an infusion of $ 1.4 million by APIDVC. Viraj Gandhi, CEO, Medicine Shoppe India, said while the company is now engaged in discussions with various institutional investors, the money raised will be used for investing in back-end infrastructure.

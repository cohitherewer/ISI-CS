 Peerless Affinity for credit card 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 31: Peerless General Finance amp; Investment Company Ltd has launched its maiden credit card in partnership with ICICI Bank. Called Peerless-ICICI Bank Affinity Credit Card, it comes without any joining or renewal fee.

 The interest rate on outstanding credit and the eligibility criteria for joining the programme are the same as those for the silver and gold credit cards of ICICI Bank. 

 The Peerless-ICICI Bank credit card will come in the silver and gold versions. The cards will use the payment gateway system of Visa International. The card also has a host of insurance benefits. 

 This initiative is in consonance with the companys plan to emerge as a financial super-market in the private sector for retail distribution of all kinds of financial products under one umbrella, Peerless MD S.K. Roy said.

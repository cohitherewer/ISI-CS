 Acquisitions key to SBI overseas growth

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Feb. 8: The State Bank of India (SBI) will explore all possibilities, including acquiring small banks in foreign countries, to increase its overseas presence. 

 The countrys largest commercial bank had recently acquired Indian Ocean International Bank in Mauritius and another bank in Kenya. 

 We will go for more such acquisitions, some of which are already in the pipeline, said SBI managing director T.S. Bhattacharya while inaugurating a branch at Rajarhat here today. At present, SBI has operations in 62 cities in 35 countries. We plan to increase our points of presence in 125 locations overseas, Bhattacharya said. 

 Finance minister P. Chidambaram told the top brass of the bank in a recent meeting that he wanted SBI to be present in all those countries with which India has trade relations. We would like to spread to all those countries. But when and how SBI will spread its wings cant be said at the moment. It will all depend on the evolving situations and opportunities, said a senior official of the bank.

 The bank has also decided to plough back its earnings from overseas operations in acquisitions and expansions abroad.

 The money to fund the acquisitions (abroad) will come from the earnings of the banks overseas operations, Bhattacharya added. We will not bring back the profits from our foreign operations and will rather use it to fund the banks global acquisitions and expansion, he said. The SBI expects to log around Rs 400 crore profit from its overseas operations in the current financial year.

 On the domestic front, the banks net profit for the nine months ended December 2005 rose marginally by 9.86 per cent to Rs 3553.38 crore from Rs 3239.64 crore during the same period last year. The bank is targeting the mid-sized corporate borrowers. The banks lending to this segment has increased 46 per cent on a year-on-year basis, said a bank official.

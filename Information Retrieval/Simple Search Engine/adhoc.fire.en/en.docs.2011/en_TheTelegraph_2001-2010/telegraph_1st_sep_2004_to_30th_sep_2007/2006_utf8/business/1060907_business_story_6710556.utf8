 Calcutta, Sept. 6: Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) is drawing up a strategy to foray into bio-diesel.

 A core group has been set up by the Fortune 500 company to prepare a roadmap.

 IOC chairman Sarthak Behuria said a final decision on the venture would be taken in six months on the basis of the recommendations of the group.

 Speaking at the sideline of the 98th annual general meeting of IBP in Calcutta today, Behuria said the company would be involved in all the stages of the business, from the cultivation of jatropha the tree which provides basic ingredients for bio-diesel to production and marketing of the product. 

 The move by Indias largest oil marketing company is important since the country meets 70 per cent of its petroleum requirement from imports. 

 Behuria said IOC would approach the government for large tracts of land to cultivate jatropha. The company preferred to take the land on lease, he added.

 The government has identified 98 million acres for jatropha cultivation. The aim is to meet 20 per cent of the demand for diesel through bio-diesel that will help in achieving energy security.

 Merger with IBP

 The merger of IBP with parent Indian Oil would be completed in the current financial year, IBP managing director VC Agarwal said at the annual general meeting.

 Agarwal told shareholders that the merger, in its final stages, would benefit both IBP and IOC as the merged entity will realise the synergies in petroleum marketing. 

 The merger ratio stipulates 110 equity shares of IOC for 100 shares of IBP. Agarwal said the IBP brand would stay after the merger, adding that a decision would be taken later on whether to continue with the brand.

 Q amp;A

 NRI income

 My son is in the US and enjoying NRI status. He files his income tax returns in the US and this includes his income from India as well. He has a PAN and I am also filing his return with the international division of the income tax department here. This year he has transferred some money to his bank account here. Will this remittance be treated as income? 

 S.R. Mundhra, Calcutta

 The remittance will have no tax implication here provided your son has already paid tax on it in the US. India has a double taxation avoidance treaty with the US. However, if this income is arising out of interest or royalty received in the US, he will have to pay some tax. Otherwise, the remittance could simply be shown as a money transfer.

 Capital gains tax

 I inherited some immovable property 15 years ago. If I sell it now, will there be any capital gains tax and at what rate? Can I avoid capital gains tax by investing in capital gains bonds? Where can I get these bonds? If I reinvest the capital gains in another house, how long would I have to hold the new property before reselling to avoid capital gains tax?

 D. Gomes, Calcutta

 Calculate your capital gains tax at 20 per cent. You can avoid paying the tax if you reinvest the money in another house within three years. However, you will have to pay capital gains tax long-term or short-term depending on the period of holding on the resale of the new property. 

 Tax forms

 I am 61 years old and receive an annual pension of Rs 1 lakh. I have other interest income from deposits in banks and post offices of about Rs 1 lakh per annum. I have also earned Rs 25,000 as short-term capital gains from shares. Which form should I use for filing personal income tax return for the assessment year 2007-08? 

 Falguni Mohanty, Durgapur

 The government had introduced Form 2F for filing returns for the assessment year 2006-07. From September this year, this form has been made mandatory for filing returns. Meanwhile, the government has also said it could modify Form 2F to make it more user friendly. But no announcement has come in so far. You have time to file your personal income tax, including short-term capital gains tax. Hold on till the government announces another form for filing personal income tax returns.

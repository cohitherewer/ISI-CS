 Calcutta, Nov. 4: Trade unions willing, the government may allow the Employees Provident Fund to invest in equities to provide higher returns to members of the fund, Union labour and employment minister Oscar Fernandes said here today.

 He was speaking at a seminar on Impact of Finance Act, 2006 on PF Trusts Alternative Investment Avenues and Labour Reforms, organised by the Merchants Chamber of Commerce. 

 In 2005, the finance ministry had allowed non-government provident funds, superannuation and gratuity funds to invest up to 5 per cent of the total corpus in equities of companies. However, the labour ministry is yet to allow EPF to invest in shares of companies. 

 The labour ministry has to notify a revised investment guideline under Para 52 of the EPF scheme 1952 to allow the authority to invest in equities. However, the Central Board of Trustees of EPF has already reached a consensus on investment in equities to shore up the returns and bridge the yawning gap between returns on investment and actual payout under the EPF scheme.

 The minister said the Central Board of Trustees would consider the proposal of allowing multiple fund managers for EPF when the board meets on November 7. As of now, the State Bank of India manages the investments of EPF. 

 Meanwhile, UTI and other mutual fund houses have evinced interest in managing investments of the EPF, provided the government allows equity investment by the EPF. 

 Under the current investment guidelines, EPF is allowed to invest a maximum of 40 per cent in central and state government securities, 30 per cent in bonds and securities of public sector units and another 30 per cent in any of the above. While an investment in these defined avenues yield a return of about 8 per cent at the current rate, the EPF gives an 8.5 per cent interest to member contributors of the fund. This translates into a loss of 0.5 per cent every year.

 However, calculations show that if an investment limit of 5 per cent in equity is allowed, EPF will be able to generate a 9 per cent return at the current rate.

 If we consider the return of the BSE sensex during the last 25 years, it works out to 19.14 per cent compounded annually, said U.K. Sinha, chairman and managing director, UTI Asset Management Company Pvt Ltd, which manages the countrys largest mutual fund. Equity returns in India over the last 100 years is also higher at 12.24 per cent, he noted.

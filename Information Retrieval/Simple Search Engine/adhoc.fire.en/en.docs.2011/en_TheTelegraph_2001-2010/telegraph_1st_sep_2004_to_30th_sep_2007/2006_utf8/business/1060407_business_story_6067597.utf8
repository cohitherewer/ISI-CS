 Amar Ujala gets CLB nod

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, April 6: The Company Law Board has approved the Zee groups funding, which has been arranged by the Aggarwal family, to buy the majority shares held by the Maheswari family in Hindi newspaper Amar Ujala.

 There is nothing in the consent order which prevents the petitioners from raising funds in any manner as long as the letter and spirit of the order that management and control of the company should not be handed over to an outsider for a period of three years is ensured, said CLB bench chairman S. Balasubramanian.

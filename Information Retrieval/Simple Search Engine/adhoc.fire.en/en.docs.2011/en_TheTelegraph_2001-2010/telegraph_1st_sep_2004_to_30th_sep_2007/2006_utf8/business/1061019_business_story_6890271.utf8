The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Analysts see no synergy

 OUR BUREAU

 Mumbai, Oct. 18: Tata Steel may be salivating at the prospect of taking over Corus Steel but credit and financial analysts are walking around with furrowed brows. 

 Standard amp; Poors has already put Tata Steels BBB long-term corporate credit rating and foreign currency rating on the companys senior unsecured bank loans of $750 million and $500 million on a rating watch with negative implications. 

 In S amp;Ps view, the size of the acquisition and the potential cash outflow of $10 billion that Tata Steel may make in its offer to Corus could have an adverse impact on its financial risk profile, quot; said Anshukant Taneja, S amp;P credit analyst. 

 Moodys Investors Service, another rating agency, said that it has placed the BAA2 corporate family rating of Tata Steel on review for possible downgrade.

 A DSP Merrill Lynch report says the acquisition does not offer cost synergies or a growing market. We do not see any cost synergies possible in the next few years... the earliest this is likely is in 2010, when the first phase of Orissas 6 million tonne capacity is commissioned, said Vandana Luthra, research analyst.

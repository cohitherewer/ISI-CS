 External debt falls to $119 bn

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 31: The external debt of the country has fallen by 4 per cent to $119.2 billion in the quarter ended December 31, the government said today. The decline is attributable primarily to the redemption of India Millennium Deposit bonds (by banks), which had matured last year, and a contraction in foreign institutional investment in Indian debt papers. 

 However, the short-term external debt had gone up 6.8 per cent, the government report said. The increase was mainly because of a rise in trade credits on account of larger import growth. The report said short-term debt rose by $533 million to $8.9 billion by December-end, while long-term debt fell by $5.4 billion to $110.26 billion.

 The governments position paper on external debt released here today also said the composition of debt has changed significantly over the last five years. The share of private corporate debt has shot up from just 39.9 per cent in 1995 to 62.6 per cent as on December 31, 2005. 

 Finance ministry officials said this was a natural corollary to the growing strength of the domestic corporate sector. However, they added, the trend needed to be monitored closely as the quality of Indian debt had to be maintained. Otherwise any corporate default can reflect on Indias sovereign debt rating, the officials pointed out.

 Indias external debt, which stood at $59.5 billion in 1995, has come down to $44.57 billion in 2005. The ratio of external debt to GDP has also dropped to 17.3 per cent as of March 2005 from 17.8 per cent in year before. 

 On the contrary, the proportion of short-term debt in total debt as well as the ratio of short-term debt to foreign current assets rose to 7.5 per cent and 6.8 per cent, respectively in December 2005.

 Within the long-term debt portfolio, multilateral debt increased by $370 million to $31.79 billion in December from $31.42 billion in the previous quarter. However, this was offset by a decline in bilateral credits by $322 million. Bilateral debt stood at $15.55 billion.

 Export credit outstanding at $5.16 billion, however, showed no significant change during the October-December quarter. External commercial borrowings stood at $22.43 billion, lower by $5.88 billion.

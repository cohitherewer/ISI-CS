 Share scam prompts auction suggestion

 Whats the price?

 New Delhi, Feb. 27: Concerned about the recent scams in allotment of shares in public issues, the Economic Survey has called for introducing an auction method for retail investors instead of the existing system of allotment at merchant bankers discretion.

 Underlining the need for improving the securities market architecture, the survey said the growth of the securities market would depend on a variety of factors, including the removal of the problem of multiple bids by individuals.

 The problem of multiple bids by individuals seeking to profit from the quota for retail investors at the discretion of merchant bankers or the government can be removed by considering a pure auction for price discovery at the IPO, in much the same manner as the secondary market functions, said the survey.

 The survey also called for improving disclosure, trading technology and policies on derivatives trading to narrow the gap in the secondary market liquidity between the largest 100 companies and the rest.

 It has also called for strengthening the investigation and surveillance process to have a steady stream of success in enforcing rules, and punishing wrongdoers, with well-prepared and well-argued cases that are upheld by the courts.

 How far securities markets will support investment, and hence how far investment will be stepped up in the coming months and years will also depend on further improvements that will be made in the securities market architecture, said the survey.

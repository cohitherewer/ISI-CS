 Tarun Das rejects TCG allegation

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, July 21: Haldia Petrochemicals chairman Tarun Das has rejected allegations of mismanagement that The Chatterjee Group has levelled against him.

 At a hearing of the Company Law Board here today, Dass counsel said it was Purnendu Chatterjee who had requested Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattachajee to intervene in the affairs of the refinery.

 The chief minister intervened only after Purnendu Chatterjee met him and requested him to negotiate the terms and conditions of Indian Oil Corporations (IOC) investment, the counsel said.

 The Chatterjee Group had accused Das of mismanagement, conspiracy, malafide and breach of trust under sections 397 and 398 of the Companies Act.

 The HPL board had agreed to bring in portfolio investors to control the spiralling losses of the refinery under the pressure from investors who had lent up to Rs 3,500 crore.

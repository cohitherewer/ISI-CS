 Shyam Tele gets licence in UK 

 New Delhi, May 15 (PTI): Rajasthan-based telecom company Shyam Telecom is expanding its footprint in Britain after having bagged a licence to offer GSM services there.

 The UK-based subsidiary Shyam Telecom UK Ltd has been awarded the licence and the company would be providing GSM networks in office buildings or campuses to offer seamless coverage, company officials said. The licence is initially for a 10-year period and extendable at the discretion of Ofcom (the equivalent of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India).

 The other leading companies, which have won the licence are British Telecom, Cable amp; Wireless UK, O2 Ltd, PLDT Ltd, Opal Telecom, Colt Mobile Telecommunications and Spring Mobil AB among others.

 The licences are for 6.6 mhz of spectrum, which will be operated on a low-power basis. Multiple licences were awarded to maximise the alternative uses of the spectrum. With regard to outdoor coverage, Ofcom has restricted the maximum height of outdoor antenna up to 10 metres, the officials said.

 Commenting on the development, Rajiv Mehrotra, chairman of Shyam Telecom, said: The services offered by Shyam would be true fixed mobile convergent solution, since Shyam will offer GSM services at tariffs similar to fixed line tariffs inside the building and campuses.

 The company has initiated the process to start services there, the officials said but declined to give details about the project.

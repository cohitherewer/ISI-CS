 ONGC-Videsh in pact with PetroEcuador

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, July 19: ONGC-Videsh (OVL) today signed an MoU with PetroEcuador, the national oil company of Ecuador, in a bid to hunt for oil in the hydrocarbon-rich South American nation. 

 Ecuadors external relations minister Francisco Carrion Mena, who presided over the function, said OVL was being considered for developing the ITT oilfield, which has a potential 5 billion barrels of in-place reserves. The recoverable reserves work out to 1 billion barrels.

 ITT is an onland field located on the far eastern side of Ecuador bordering Peru and requires a large investment to start producing oil. Given the rich potential of the field, it is considered a good prospect.

 What goes in OVLs favour is that Ecuador is looking for a government-owned company to develop the field. However, state-owned companies of other countries such as Venezuela and Mexico are also interested in the field and Ecuador will go in for the best deal, Mena said. 

 OVL is banking on the tie-up with PetroEcuador to tip the scales in its favour, said managing director R.S. Butola.

 Mena said the next round of bidding for oil exploration blocks would come up in January. OVL is expected to bid for these blocks in partnership with PetroEcuador. 

 Ecuador has also offered to sell 2 million barrels of oil per month to India. The oil can be picked up either by Indian Oil or MRPL and is to be considered cost-effective, as Reliance Industries is already importing oil from Ecuador.

 Ecuador is also looking for investment in the downstream refinery sector. The country has three refineries, which need to be modernised. Since the refineries are functioning much below their capacity, the country is importing petroleum products to meet its demand. 

 Butola said while OVL is interested in oil exploration and production, the downstream ventures on offer could be taken up either by MRPL, Indian Oil or Hindustan Petroleum.

 New Delhi, Sept. 20: LG Electronics India (LGEIL), the consumer electronics and durable company, is aiming at a Rs 10,000 crore turnover next year on the back of a drive to increase high-end product sales.

 The company expects to clock a turnover of about Rs 8,500-9,000 crore this year and we hope to cross the Rs 10,000-crore mark by 2007, said Girish V. Rao, vice-president-sales and marketing of LGEIL.

 The company had posted a Rs 7,500 crore turnover last year, with exports at $100 million. This year, LG has targeted to double export earnings, adding new destinations such as South America and Europe.

 Rao said LGEIL is expecting growth from its flat panel display systems. Rao, who expects the segment to contribute in a major way, said, We hope to corner 45 per cent market share in this segment by the end of the year.

 LGEIL enjoys a 36 per cent market share in this segment. The flat panel display includes both LCD and plasma televisions. 

 However, the company has no plans to start production of flat panels. The volumes dont support it. There is no possibility of starting production until sales reach a minimum of a million units, Rao said.

 Sales of flat panels stands at a total of 1.5 lakh units at present. According to industry estimates, it is expected to double next year.

 LGs colour television sales accounted for 32 per cent of its turnover in India. Refrigerators contributed 10 per cent, air conditioners 15-20 per cent, washing machines 8 per cent and IT (computers and GSM mobiles) about 10 per cent.

 The company kicked off its festive season offer with the launch of 11 models of the latest flat panel range, priced between Rs 30,000 and Rs 2.5 lakh.

 LG is expecting a turnover of Rs 2,500 crore during this festive season and it plans to spend Rs 1,000 crore on marketing. It is starting joint promotional campaigns with Cartoon Network.

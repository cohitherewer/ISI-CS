 HDFC joins rate-hike bandwagon

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 High rise

 Mumbai, May 1: Following in the footsteps of commercial banks, the Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) has raised home loan rates by 50 basis points across the board. The new rates will come into effect from tomorrow. 

 While HDFC has raised its prime lending rate (PLR) by half a percentage point to 11.75 per cent, sources from the corporation said both fixed and floating home loans will now become dearer by 50 basis points. The company is also set to raise interest rates on its deposits. 

 Officials blamed the rising cost of funds behind the move to raise home loan rates. 

 In January this year, HDFC had raised the interest rate on home loans by half a percentage point. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) later increased the reverse repo rate (through which it mops liquidity from banks) by 25 basis points in its monetary policy. HDFC, in turn, raised its PLR to 11.25 per cent from 10.75 per cent. The interest rates on a loan for a tenure of 15 years was raised to 8 per cent in the case of floating rate and to 9.25 per cent for fixed rates. These will now be raised by half a percentage point. 

 HDFC is one of the bigger players in the housing finance segment with cumulative home loan approvals at over Rs 100,000 crore. Its move to hike interest rates virtually completes the present cycle of a northward trend in home loans. 

 ICICI Bank is among the few who are yet to raise housing loan rates. The bank had a volume of Rs 25,740 crore in mortgages for the financial year ended March 31, 2006. 

 This constituted almost 31 per cent of the total industry volumes of Rs 82,500 crore for the year. 

 Last weekend, senior officials said the bank had not yet taken any decision on raising home loan rates. However, industry circles say it is only a matter of time before the bank follows suit. 

 Last Saturday, State Bank of India (SBI) raised interest rates on both fixed and floating housing loans. While interest rate on floating rate home loans up to a period of five years was revised to 8.75 per cent from 8.5 per cent, the fixed rate for the same period was revised to 9.5 per cent. Similarly, floating loans above 5 years and up to 10 years was raised to 9.25 per cent from 8.75 per cent. 

 Loans above 10 years and up to 15 years where only floating option is available, will bear an interest of 9.25 per cent, a rise of 25 basis points, while those above 15 years and up to 20 years, will have an interest rate of 9.75 per cent as against 9.25 per cent earlier. 

 SBI followed Bank of Baroda (BoB) who was first off the block in raising interest rates.

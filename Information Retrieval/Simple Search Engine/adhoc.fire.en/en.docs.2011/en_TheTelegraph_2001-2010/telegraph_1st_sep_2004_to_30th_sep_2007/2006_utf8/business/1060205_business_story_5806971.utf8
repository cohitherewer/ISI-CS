 Jet seeks go-ahead to tap market

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Feb. 4: Jet Airways India has sought shareholders approval for raising $800 million either from the overseas or from the domestic market.

 The company has informed the stock exchanges that an extra ordinary general meeting has been called on February 28 to seek the shareholders approval.

 The airline is considering issuing equity shares in the domestic market or floating global and American depository receipts or foreign currency convertible bonds.

 Jet Airways, which last month announced a deal to acquire rival Air Sahara for $500 million in cash, has embarked on a $3-billion fleet expansion programme. It also plans to enhance the investment limits of foreign institutional investors, including their sub-accounts, in the company from the current 24 per cent to an aggregate limit of 49 per cent of its paid-up share capital.

 Sensex march minus the beat

 CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA

 Mumbai, Feb. 6: The sensex doesnt like loud bands from Lalbaug. Last Monday, the Mahesh Dilip Nasik Baja Band from Lalbaug in the city had parked itself in front of the Bombay Stock Exchange. 

 The four members of the band ? hired by stockbrokers to cheer the big moment when the 30-scrip sensitive index would stop being a tease and finally touch the 10K mark ? would come in the morning, sit under the shade of shops on Dalal Street, then shift to the entrance of the BSE building, and then come back again.

 But the sensex clung to levels far below the magical mark. Twice it came tantalisingly close, but not enough for the band to get up and beat its drums ? one metal, and three dholaks. So the four remained under the shop shades, ate their vada pav, yawned, stretched ? and sometimes did worse. 

 Kabhi kabhi to woh log so bhi jate the, (Sometimes they would even fall asleep), said Sunil, a panipuri walla, one of the numerous food vendors near the BSE.

 They came every morning from Monday to Friday. But tired with the wait, they gave up and didnt turn up today when the sensex stunned everyone by scaling the peak just 15 minutes before close.

 The band came here everyday last week. The sensex made it today because the band didnt turn up, said a happy stockbroker with a tika on his head, huddled with others near his car. 

 Like the band, the stockbrokers were caught napping, too. There was no party as such, said stockbroker Giridhari Khaitan. At least not in the afternoon, not in the BSE building. The BSE was rather quiet for such a landmark event. Some firecrackers were burst, but a little away, said a paanwala opposite the entrance. Dalal Street was little more crowded, but it was because of the flood of media persons, he said.

 I think its reason enough to celebrate, but I am going to attend a lecture by investment guru Marc Faber, said leading stockbroker Rakesh Jhunjhunwala. If the sensex dodged the Mahesh-Dilip Nasik band, the historical value of the event dodged some others very close to the BSE.

 A pavement newspaper vendor who sits right opposite the BSE entrance was dismissive. Kuchh dus hazaar hua hai. But it will not make any difference to my papers. Anything in the stock market doesnt make any difference to my life, he said. His neighbour, another newspaper vendor, nodded in agreement.

 A little away, an old tea seller with a wizened face, said something had happened. But I dont know what. Everyday something or the other keeps happening in the stock exchange. It doesnt change my life, he added.

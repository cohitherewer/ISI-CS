 NCAER index finds economy in fine form

 New Delhi, April 15 (PTI): The growth momentum of the business confidence index (BCI) slowed down to 1.7 per cent in the last quarter of 2005-06 compared with 3.7 per cent in the previous quarter, despite index surging ahead to reach 154 points from 151.4 during the same period.

 Nevertheless, BCI during January-March 2006 is at the highest level since November 1994 (159.4), economic think tank National Council for Applied Economic Research (NCAER) said in its latest report.

 Increase in business sentiments and retardation in pace of growth of BCI was in line with the growth trend of industrial production and manufacturing sector GDP, it added.

 The index of industrial production (IIP) growth momentum, which started from the middle of 2001-02, is continuing with some exceptions, it said.

 IIP general grew by 8 per cent during April-January 2005-06 despite the lower growth in November and December 2005. The manufacturing sector grew by full one percentage point higher than the IIP growth.

 Despite the hardening of global and domestic interest rates and uncertain oil prices, performance of the industrial sector is indeed commendable, NCAER said, though admitting that the above factors were affecting both topline and bottomline of the corporate sector.

 In line with the trend of IIP growth, the capital goods sector was the flag bearer of upbeat sentiments and contributed the maximum towards the gain in BCI, it said.

 However, consumer durables and services sector firms turned bearish this quarter. The capital goods sector saw the maximum gain in sentiments of 7.7 per cent, followed by intermediate goods sector (2.2 per cent). Sentiments expressed by different sectors are more or less in line with the growth pattern of the IIP, the think tank said.

 The relatively lower IIP growth of the consumer durables sector this year compared with last year could be one of the reasons for bearish sentiments from the consumer goods sector, it said.

 However, NCAER found it puzzling that despite a sharp decline in IIP growth this year and bearish sentiment of services sector firms, there was a bullish sentiment from intermediates goods sector.

 The rating of both macro indicators ? overall economic conditions and investment climate ? increased by 2.5 per cent and 2.2 per cent respectively, while the rating for firm level (micro) indicators ? the financial position of the firm ? fell by 0.7 per cent.

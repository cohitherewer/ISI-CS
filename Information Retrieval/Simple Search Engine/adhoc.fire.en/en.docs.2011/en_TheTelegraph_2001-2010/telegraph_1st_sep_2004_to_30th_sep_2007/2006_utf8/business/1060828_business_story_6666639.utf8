 FM douses deficit fears

 Bangalore, Aug. 27 (PTI): Finance minister P. Chidambaram today said front-loading of expenditure was responsible for higher deficit numbers in the first quarter, but was confident of meeting the fiscal and revenue deficit targets for the fiscal.

 The expenditure is being front-loaded because there are two major programmes, where 50 per cent of the funds to be devolved upon states are given in April, he said on the sidelines of a function here.

 I am absolutely confident that, as of present, we will meet the fiscal deficit target as well as the revenue deficit target, he said. 

 According to the finance ministrys quarterly review of government finances tabled in Parliament on Friday, the gross fiscal deficit during April-June 2006, at Rs 77,740 crore, was 42.6 per cent higher than Rs 54,517 crore in the same period of the previous fiscal.

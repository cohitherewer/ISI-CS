 Bank strike in October

 Bhubaneswar, Sept. 9 (PTI): The countrys 10 lakh bank employees, under the umbrella organisation of United Forum of Bank Unions (UFBU), will go on a nationwide token strike on October 27 against the uncompromising attitude of the government and management towards their various concerns.

 The programme will commence with centralised demonstrations in state capitals on October 5 and a delegation of UFBU leaders will meet Indian Banks Association the same day, UFBU convenor Prafulla Kumar Patnaik said. 

 This would be followed by dharna at all state capitals on October 18. 

 The UFBU demands include introduction of second option on pension scheme, ban on outsourcing core functions of banks and filling up vacancies, while it opposed merger and acquisition of public sector banks.

 Patnaik, who recently took over the leadership of UFBU, said the forum had been demanding one more option for pension for those employees and officers who could not exercise their option earlier.

 Though the IBA refused to consider the demand for a long time, it agreed to discuss the alternatives with UFBU to resolve the issue, he said.

 Although IBA held out specific assurances to settle the issue amicably, it had recently forwarded a proposal to all member banks advising them to explore possibilities of introducing the scheme when the issue is still under discussion with UFBU, Patnaik said.

 We strongly oppose the unilateral decision of IBA to introduce any alternative scheme, he said, adding, we urge the IBA to withdraw the instructions issued to banks.

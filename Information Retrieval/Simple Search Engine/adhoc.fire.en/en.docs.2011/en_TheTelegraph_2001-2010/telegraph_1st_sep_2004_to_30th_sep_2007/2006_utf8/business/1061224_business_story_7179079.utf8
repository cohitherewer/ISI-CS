 Rivals fate follows Hutch network

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Dec. 23: The race for Hutchison Essar has left its mark on the investor wealth of three major telecom companies in the country. 

 Reliance Communication (R-Com) has witnessed a surge in market capitalisation over the last fortnight, so has Tata Teleservices. However, Bharti Airtels fortunes took a wrong turn since the news of Hutch-Essar bids first hit the market on December 8. 

 Except for the last few days, the market had not reacted sharply to the news. Therefore, there have not been such a significant run up in the prices of the telecom scrips. Also, the correction and the subsequent volatility in the markets affected the overall stock universe, said Avinash Gorakshakar, head of research, Emkay Shares and Stockbrokers. 

 However, lately the implications for the bids have started getting factored into the prices. The Reliance scrip saw some positive movement, said Gorakshakar. 

 R-Com, which closed at Rs 447.30 on December 8, called it a day on Friday at Rs 468.35. Macquarie Research has put an outperform tag on the scrip with a target price of Rs 500. Market capitalisation rose 5 per cent from Rs 91,588.53 crore to Rs 95,769.77 crore during this period. 

 A report by Emkay Shares on the Hutch-Essar buyout says, We believe the buyout is synergistic for R-Com, Maxis, and Vodafone. If Reliance Communications can buy out Hutch, it would be catapulted to Indias largest wireless operator with a share of 36.3 per cent. Hutchison Essar is the countrys third largest GSM operator with a 15.9 per cent share. 

 Tata Teleservices gathered a 7 per cent increase in investor wealth since December 8 to add up to Rs 3,365.66 crore at Fridays closing of Rs 18.60. The scrip had closed at Rs 17.35 on December 8 with a market capitalisation of Rs 3,139.48 crore. Bharti Airtel has lost ground with a 3 per cent slip in market capitalisation. The scrip ended at Rs 611.45 on Friday against the Rs 633.20 on December 8.

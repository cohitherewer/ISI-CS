 Srinivasan: Talking point

 New Delhi, May 4: Petroleum secretary M.S. Srinivasan is expected to begin talks with his finance counterpart next week on the proposed price hike of petroleum goods and duty cuts to bail out oil companies as the Indian basket of crude imports hovers around $70 per barrel.

 However, the final decision will be taken by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh after discussions with the Left parties and coalition partners of the government. The exercise is expected to continue till the month-end.

 Petroleum minister Murli Deora today said no decision has yet been taken on increasing the prices of petrol, diesel and possibly LPG and ?consultations in this regard have not commenced?. 

 ?Consultation is yet to begin and it will take some time for this process to be completed and therefore, any report of a price hike in the meantime is purely speculative in nature and is baseless,? Deora said.

 Srinivasan will meet finance secretary Adarsh Kishore on May 8 to set the ball rolling on the issue. The petroleum ministry will bank on the recommendations of the Rangarajan committee to push the case for a price hike and duty cuts to save the oil companies from plunging into the red.

 However, given the political compulsions of the government, the increase in petrol and diesel prices is not expected to exceed Rs 2 to 3 per litre. 

 The oil companies, however, claim that they are losing around Rs 10 per litre by selling these transport fuels.

 The petroleum ministry is expected to recommend a Rs 15 to 20 increase per cylinder of cooking gas as the oil companies are losing close to Rs 220 per LPG cylinder. Kerosene is being sold at a loss of Rs 16.78 per litre.

 Currently, under-recoveries of Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum are expected to be around Rs 75,000 crore during 2006-07. These companies claim that together they have suffered losses worth Rs 4,722 crore in revenues in April. During 2005-06, the oil companies had gross under-recoveries to the tune of Rs 39,600 crore.

 Indian Oil, which controls roughly half of the fuel market, lost Rs 2,450 crore on fuel sales in April and is projecting a loss of Rs 1,560 crore in the first fortnight of May if prices remained unchanged, officials said.

 Finance minister P. Chidambaram has said any decision on raising petroleum prices could be taken only after consulting the UPA allies.

 Black gold eludes ONGC Videsh in Libya

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Pack-up time

 New Delhi, May 7: ONGC-Videshs oil hunt in Libya seems to have hit a rough patch. The first two wells drilled in that country have turned out to be dry, and the companys plans to spud the third has run into a red tape. 

 Sources said OVL was waiting for almost a year to get the governments approval. Managing director R.S. Butola said the company was ready to drill the third well, but there has been no word from the government.

 OVL had high hopes of discovering oil from Libya, which is rich in hydro-carbons, but things have turned out quite the opposite.

 The company also failed to strike oil in Australia and has abandoned the effort. OVL had invested $7.2 million in Block WA in Australia for a 55 per cent share; Antrim Energy Inc with a 32.5 per cent share was the operator. 

 Similarly, OVL had earlier acquired a stake in a gas block in the US offshore, which it handed over to Oil India Ltd. But this venture had to be given up as no oil or gas was struck in the course of the drilling.

 This shows the risks in oil and gas exploration, and a stake in an exploration block does not necessarily lead to an oil find.

 OVL has been awarded two exploration blocks in Libya, while the Oil India-Indian Oil combine has one block.

 Butola said OVL was targeting discovered and semi-discovered oilfields where the risk was less. These assets, however, cost more and their price has been shooting up as crude prices have soared over the last year. 

 OVL has committed an expenditure of over $350 million for exploring overseas oil blocks that it recently acquired in Sudan, Ivory Coast, Egypt, Qatar, Libya and Australia.

 According to senior officials this is the minimum committed expenditure. In case there is a major oil or gas find, the investment will be stepped up.

 The highest expenditure of $269 million has been earmarked for block 5A in Sudan in which OVL has a 24 per cent stake. This block is operated by Malaysian oil firm Petronas, which has a 68.9 per cent stake.

 Similarly, OVL will invest $26 million in block 5B in Sudan, which is also operated by Petronas.

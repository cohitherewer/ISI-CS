 TV firms aghast at levy bid

 New Delhi, June 5: Television manufacturers are up in arms against a government proposal to introduce a licence fee on the purchase of television sets to fund public broadcaster Prasar Bharti.

 Opposing the proposal vehemently, the industry said it would affect sales as well as proposed investments in the sector. This will hurt the television industry badly and put it under severe pressure, said Anoop Kumar, president of Consumer Electronics and TV Manufacturers Association (Cetma).

 According to the industry body, any additional burden will result in a major slowdown of the television industry, which is already reeling under heavy taxes.

 This will also clearly encourage sales in the grey market, and no one will benefit from this development, neither us (organised players) nor the government, said Gulu Mirchanadani, chairman and managing director of Mirc Electronics Limited, the makers of Onida TV. The industry is accusing the government of making industry players bear the brunt to turn the cash-strapped public broadcaster Prasar Bharti viable.

 Of the various proposals being considered, Cetma said one includes the levy of a licence fee of 10-15 per cent ad-valorem on purchase price.

 Meanwhile, the body has also asked the government to address the issue of high taxes in the local market, as televisions are included in the early harvest scheme of the free-trade agreement (FTA) with Thailand, which means no duty on imports from September this year.

 Against India, where total taxes on televisions is about 35 per cent, the total level of taxes in Thailand is about 7 per cent and unlike India, there is no import duty on all inputs for TV sets. This makes manufacturing in India an expensive proposition and is hurting domestic makers, added Mirchandani.

 If imports are cheaper than manufacturing locally, it will literally kill the industry and force small manufacturers to shut shop, said Ravinder Zutshi, deputy managing director of Samsung Electronics.

 Los Angeles, April 6: As fuel prices soar once again, DaimlerChrysler said in 2008 it would sell its first gasoline-electric hybrid, a version of the Dodge Durango sport utility vehicle.

 The automaker said the hybrid system, fitted to a 5.7-litre V-8 engine, would improve the midsize trucks fuel economy by up to 25 per cent, from no more than 19 miles per gallon now, according to a government estimate.

 Hybrids save fuel with an electric motor that helps to propel the vehicle, augmenting and, in some cases, taking over for the gasoline or diesel engine. Twelve such hybrids are available in the United States, produced by Toyota, Honda and Ford; two more, both General Motors pickups, have a hybrid-like engine-shutdown feature when stopped in traffic.

 Americans bought more than 200,000 hybrids last year, more than half of them Toyota Priuses. The total accounted for only about 1 per cent of all new vehicles. Analysts at J.D. Power and Associates forecast sales of almost 800,000 hybrids a year by 2012, or about 4 per cent of all new vehicle sales.

 Toyotas luxury Lexus division plans to unveil a hybrid version of its Lexus LS sedan at next weeks New York International Auto Show, where Ford and Mitsubishi plan to exhibit experimental hybrids.

 A hybrid variant of the popular Toyota Camry is to go on sale next month. Similar variants of the Saturn Vue SUV are due in summer, followed next year by a hybrid Chevrolet Malibu. GM also has promised hybrid versions of the Chevrolet Tahoe and Yukon SUVs late next year as 2008 models. Ford Motor Co has promised hybrid variants of the Mazda Tribute SUV next year, the Fusion, and Milan midsize sedans in 2008 and, by 2010, hybrid Ford Edges and Lincoln MKX SUVs and the Ford Five Hundred and Mercury Montego sedans.

 DaimlerChrysler had previously announced plans for a Durango hybrid without setting a sale date. We havent determined the exact timing in 2008, Daimler spokesman Colin McBean said.

 No price has been set for the Durango hybrid.

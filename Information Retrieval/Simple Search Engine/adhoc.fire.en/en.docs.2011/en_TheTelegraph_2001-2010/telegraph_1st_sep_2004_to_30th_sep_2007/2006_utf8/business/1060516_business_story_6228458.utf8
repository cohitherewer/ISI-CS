 Nova Scotia in gold rush

 Golden stock 

 Mumbai, May 15 (Reuters): Canadas Bank of Nova Scotia is targeting Indias retail bullion market, hoping to replicate its strength in the wholesale market, a senior bank official said on Monday.

 Soaring gold prices have stoked peoples interest in gold as an investment product as opposed to jewellery, the traditional ? but pricier ? way to hold gold.

 Nova Scotia is a big player in the bullion market: Last year it imported 225 tonnes of gold out of Indias total imports of 724 tonnes, according to Rajan Venkatesh, the banks marketing director for India bullion.

 But it is a relative newcomer to the crowded retail market.

 We are making a gradual but firm entry into Indias retail market, Venkatesh told Reuters in an interview. A suite of products for the retail segment is on the cards.

 Nova Scotias bullion division, better known as ScotiaMocatta, is set to launch gold coin products in up to 12 cities before the year ends as more and more Indians take to buying gold as a financial asset, Venkatesh said.

 Last month, it began selling gold coins of five and eight grams in Chennai, Coimbatore and Bangalore during the Akshaya Trithiai festival.

 In the next few weeks, the imported, Scotia-branded coins will be glittering in the windows of jewellery shops in New Delhi, Ahmedabad and Calcutta.

 quot;If it becomes a success, it could have the potential to contribute substantially to our India revenues in two years, Venkatesh said.

 Nova Scotia entered India in 1984 targeting corporate and commercial banking clients, but became a well-known supplier of bullion after the government allowed banks to import gold in 1997.

 As part of its retail thrust, the bank is also looking to launch gold certificates and a gold accumulation plan that would give investors physical gold or its equivalent in cash upon redemption.

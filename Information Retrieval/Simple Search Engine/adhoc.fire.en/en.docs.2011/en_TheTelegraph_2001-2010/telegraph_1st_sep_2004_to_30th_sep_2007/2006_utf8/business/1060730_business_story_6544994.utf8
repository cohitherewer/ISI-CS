 Jet Airways suffers loss in first quarter

 Ground reality

 Mumbai, July 29: Jet Airways has slipped into the red during the first quarter of the current fiscal on account of higher employee costs and fuel expenses. 

 The leading private carrier has suffered a loss of Rs 44.98 crore in the quarter against a profit of Rs 95.34 crore achieved in the corresponding period a year ago. 

 The airline has, however, reported a profit before tax of Rs 11.8 crore in its domestic operations. A loss of Rs 71.3 crore has resulted in an overall loss before tax of Rs 59.5 crore for the quarter. 

 Total revenues grew 25 per cent to Rs 1,678.76 crore from Rs 1,345.36 crore for the same quarter in the previous year. 

 On the other hand, total expenditure increased 54 per cent to Rs 1,585.29 crore from Rs 1,031.43 crore last year. 

 According to the company, the financial performance for the quarter was affected by factors that included continuing yield pressure in domestic and international operations and an increase in fuel and other input costs. 

 Although the domestic passenger yield, or average revenue per passenger was higher than the industry, it was 9 per cent lower for the quarter. Taking into account the fuel surcharge introduced on May 1, 2006, gross yield was lower by 6 per cent. 

 The employees remuneration and benefits have escalated 106 per cent to Rs 229.08 crore from Rs 110.94 crore in the corresponding quarter last year. 

 Aircraft fuel expenses have also gone up 68 per cent to Rs 585.85 crore from Rs 347.84 crore last year. 

 Operating costs increased 54 per cent to Rs 564.37 crore from Rs 365.31 crore due to the increase in the level of operations. 

 The company gave a difficult business outlook despite growth in domestic and international passenger traffic and strong underlying economic growth. 

 The domestic industry capacity of the airlines, measured by seats offered per day, was 48 per cent higher in the first quarter against the same period previous year, with a capacity increase of about 20 per cent over the period. 

 Meanwhile, the number of domestic passengers grew at an estimated 52 per cent during this period, a significant portion of which was induced by fare discounting.

 Bharat Forge

 Bharat Forge has posted a 5.31 per cent rise in net profit at Rs 51.51 crore for the quarter ended June 30 compared with Rs 48.91 crore for the same quarter in 2005-06.

 Crude shadow on foreign capital inflow

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 On slippery ground

 New Delhi, Feb. 27: High crude oil prices continue to shroud the global economic outlook and could eventually lead to a reduction in foreign capital inflows into the country, according to the Economic Survey.

 This could have a destabilising effect on the economy as the current account deficit has soared over the last two years with exports failing to keep pace with imports.

 Surging foreign capital inflows have filled the gap and enabled the country to come through with a positive balance of payments and an increase of $6.4 billion in the foreign exchange reserves during April-September 2005. This is only marginally lower than the accretion of $6.9 billion during April-September 2004.

 The survey points out that if crude oil prices continue to remain high, the adverse effects on global activity are likely to follow from higher production costs and lower investor and consumer confidence. Energy price-induced inflationary expectations can also raise global interest rates and affect global capital flows especially to emerging markets.

 It highlights the fact that much of the strengthening of Indias capital account has emanated from foreign investment, particularly foreign institutional investor inflows.

 During the current financial year, FII inflows were more than 11 times higher than such inflows during April-September 2004. The bulk of this investment occurred during July-September 2005 in response to the rising buoyancy in the stock markets. The period also witnessed an increase in inflows of commercial borrowings and short-term credits on account of lower interest rate spreads on external borrowings and higher import financing requirements.

 Increased remittances from Indians working abroad and the buoyancy in export of software services saw the flow of the invisibles category in the current account go up by 31 per cent during 2005-06.

 However, this could not cover up for the trade deficit, which shot up by 114 per cent in largely because the value of crude imports increased by close to 50 per cent.

 While the trade deficit had reached a high of $28.6 billion in 2004-05, this was surpassed by a record $33.8 billion in the 10-month period April-January of 2005-06 itself.

 The survey draws some solace from the fact that the increase in imports is also due to the import of capital goods, which results in increased production and export-related imports which, in turn, lead to more exports.

 The survey says if domestic industry continues to remain upbeat, the sustained industrial demand for imports might increase the size of the deficit as a proportion of GDP in the remaining months of 2005-06.

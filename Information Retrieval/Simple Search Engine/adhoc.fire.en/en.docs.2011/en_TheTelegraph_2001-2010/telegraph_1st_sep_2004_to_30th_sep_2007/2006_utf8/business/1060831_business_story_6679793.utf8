 Sky is the limit

 New Delhi, Aug. 30: Air Sahara today unveiled an attractive scheme for frequent flyers, which offers a Rs 699-a-day unlimited flight scheme. The airline is targeting a market share of 12 per cent by December. 

 Under the Fly Unlimited package deal, one can fly Air Sahara unlimited to any domestic destination throughout the year for a lump-sum payment of Rs 2,55,000. The same scheme is applicable to international flights for an extra payment of Rs 100. Business class travel will, however, cost 50 per cent more. 

 The airline is also offering such a package for 90 days at the rate of Rs 799 each day, for 60 days at Rs 899 and for 30 days at Rs 999, airline President Alok Sharma said. 

 The concept of charging per day is an innovation in the Indian aviation sector. This ensures reduction in travel cost, reduction in hotel accommodation expenditure, increase in time-spend with family for the passenger and committed business for the airline. We are confident that frequent flyers will benefit from them, he added. 

 He said the scheme would help the airline in getting committed business passengers. 

 Passengers, however, will have to pay the taxes for travel on tickets booked under the scheme. Bookings for the new scheme open tomorrow for travel from September 4. Indian Airlines on the other hand has geared up for increased traffic demand during the coming festive season with new flights to some destinations and increased frequency to others, particularly in the North-East. With low fares and bumper bonanzas, Indian is trying to woo the tourist on the move. 

 A new flight to the temple town of Khajuraho and Varanasi from Delhi would start from September 15, along with increased frequency on several routes.

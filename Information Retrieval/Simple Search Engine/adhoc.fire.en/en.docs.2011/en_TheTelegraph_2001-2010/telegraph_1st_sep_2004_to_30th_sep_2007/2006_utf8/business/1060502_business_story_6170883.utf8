 Reliance Comm posts 30% rise in net profit

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, May 1: Reliance Communication Ventures Ltd (RCoVL), the Anil Dhirubhai Ambani group company, today reported a 30 per cent rise in net profit for the quarter ended March 31, 2006. RCoVLs earnings rose to Rs 403 crore from Rs 310 crore in the preceding period.

 The comparable figures for the corresponding period in 2004-05 was not available as the year consisted of nine months and it ended on December 31, 2005. This is the first quarterly results of RCoVL since it was listed on March 6.

 On a consolidated basis, while profits stood at Rs 403 crore (after extraordinary items) for the quarter, total revenues were placed at Rs 2,970 crore against Rs 2,991 crore in the preceding quarter.

 Prior to extraordinary items, which includes employee restructuring cost of Rs 37 crore, the net profit was placed at Rs 440 crore, a 42 per cent rise over Rs 310 crore for quarter ended December 31, 2005.

 RCoVLs strong bottomline growth was aided by a reduction in operating expenses, which came down to Rs 1,928 crore over Rs 2,143 crore for the period ended December 31, 2005.

 Around 71 per cent of the companys revenues came from its wireless business, which contributed Rs 2,120 crore (Rs 1,981 crore) to the revenue. Global business was next, chipping in Rs 1,415 crore (Rs 1,391 crore) and that from the broadband business, where RCoVL is now engaged in scaling up its capacities, stood at Rs 195 crore (Rs 127 crore).

 The consolidated financial results relate to RCoVL and its operating companies, including Reliance Infocomm (RIC), Reliance Communications Infrastructure (RCIL), Reliance Telecom (RTL), and FLAG Telecom (FLAG). 

 While RCoVL said these numbers are based on a prudent and conservative accounting methodology, whereby revenues during the quarter from lifetime free incoming plans have been deferred over a period of 46 to 65 months, it did not give the detailed break-up of the performance of the investee companies (RIC, RCIL, RTL) where it holds less than 50 per cent.

 Anil Ambani, chairman of RCoVL, said, Reliance Communications, Indias youngest, fastest, largest communications company, maintained its market leadership, with product offerings best suited to the requirements of millions of customers across all segments.

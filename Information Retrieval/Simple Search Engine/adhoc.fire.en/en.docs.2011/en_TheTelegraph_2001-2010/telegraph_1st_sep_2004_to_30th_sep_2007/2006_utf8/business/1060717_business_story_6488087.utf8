 Bangla reopens Tata file

 Dhaka, July 16 (PTI): The Tata Groups $3-billion investment proposal in Bangladesh will be sent to the ministerial committee within this month, Mahmudur Rahman, head of the board of investment and also a state minister, said here today.

 He said the secretary-level committee has submitted an evaluation report on the project, which would be forwarded to a ministerial panel headed by industries minister Matiur Rahman Nizami in this month.

 The secretary-level committee found Tatas revised proposal given in April as logical, a local TV channel reported.

 The Tatas might have suspended the investment plan, (but) we are working on it. The Tatas have said they would talk when the government invites them, Rahman said.

 Bangladeshs business community was critical over delays in clearing the Tata project, saying it would send a wrong signal to prospective foreign investors.

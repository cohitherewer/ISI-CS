 Q amp;A

 Share bounty

 Im a housewife. I had purchased some shares 10-12 years ago by selling my gifted ornaments. I got a dividend of Rs 7,300 from those shares in 2005-06. Will I have to pay income tax on this dividend income? I had also sold my shares for Rs 1,30,000 last fiscal. Do I have to take the sale proceeds into account while calculating income tax? Is interest earned on savings bank accounts taxable?

 Rekha Ghosh, Calcutta

 The company announcing the dividend pays a dividend distribution tax under section 115- of the income tax act. So, a dividend income arising out of holding equity shares is not taxed at the hand of the shareholders. And one doesnt need to include such income while calculating the total annual income for income tax purposes. 

 The profit made by selling shares after holding it for more than 12 months qualifies for long-term capital gains, and there is no tax on long-term capital gains from equity shares. 

 terest income from savings bank deposits is, however, taxable and the tax is deducted at source unless the depositor provides the banker Form 15F or 15H declaring that he or she is a taxpayer. In such a case, there will be no TDS on the interest paid by the bank. But the depositor will have to show the interest income as income from other sources while computing the total annual income for tax purposes.

 Retirement solutions

 I am a 45-year-old salaried person. Besides life insurance plans, what other types of savings at this age is suitable to ensure a secured post-retirement life? What are the specified ELSS with a three-year lock-in period?

 Swapan Kumar Mandal, Howrah 

 Life insurance plans are meant to give financial protection to your family when you will not be there. These are not exactly retirement plans. Hence the survival benefits in life insurance plans are very low compared with other investment instruments. 

 However, life insurers these days are selling unit-linked policies where the survival benefits are likely to be higher than those in traditional plans. For retirement savings, there are quite a few instruments ? PPF, pension plans of life insurance companies and ELSS of mutual funds. An ELSS is a tax saving scheme of mutual funds. However, if you want to avail of the tax benefit, you cant sell the units within three years of purchase.

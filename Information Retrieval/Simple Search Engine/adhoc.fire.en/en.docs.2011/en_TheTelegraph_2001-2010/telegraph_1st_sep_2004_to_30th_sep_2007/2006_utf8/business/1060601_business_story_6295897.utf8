The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Future looks bleak for Lyons Range

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, May 31: The 100-year-old Calcutta Stock Exchange may soon become extinct if its members fail to approve an amendment to the memorandum and articles of association (MoA) at the extraordinary general meeting on June 7.

 A Sebi committee on regional stock exchanges had recommended that the regulator had the right to de-recognise any regional stock exchange if demutualisation scheme had not been implemented within a specified time frame. For Lyons Range, the last date is June 17.

 T.K. Das, CSE administrator, today convened a meeting to discuss the consequences if the MoA is not cleared within the stipulated time. The thinly-attended meeting ended in a furore as brokers raised objections to the notice and demanded that payment of interest and dividend on their deposits with the bourse be resolved before the EGM.

 A peaceful resolution of the amendments to the articles of association seems far-fetched and the threat of de-recognition looms large on the CSE, which has about 945 brokers and 120 employees on its rolls.

 The EGM agenda includes raising the authorised capital from Rs 3 lakh to Rs 10 crore.

 The Calcutta Stock Exchange Association Ltd has been functioning as a no profit, no loss organisation under section 11 of the companies act. After demutualisation, the association will become a corporate entity and will have to amend its articles of association according to section 31. 

 These amendments will have to comply with Sebis scheme, which stipulates that a 51 per cent stake in the stock exchange will have to be divested to a non-broker, non-trading entity.

 The CSE has an authorised capital of Rs 3 lakh divided into 1,200 equity shares of Rs 250 each, which has been proposed (by its administrator) to be increased to Rs 10 crore divided into 4 lakh equity shares. This means the exchange will have to create 3,98,000 shares more. 

 According to the Sebi scheme, 51 per cent of the equity capital of an exchange has to be divested to the public who are not trading members of the exchange.

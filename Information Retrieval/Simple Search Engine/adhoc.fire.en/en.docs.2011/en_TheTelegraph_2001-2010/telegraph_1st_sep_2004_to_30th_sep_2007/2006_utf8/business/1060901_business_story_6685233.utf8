 Oil bonds set to lose sheen

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Dry day

 New Delhi, Aug. 31: The Centre has denied SLR status to oil bonds, a partial insurance to oil PSUs against losses on the sale of petroleum products. 

 The move is expected to erode the value of these bonds to the oil companies which are struggling to remain afloat. 

 Shorn of the SLR status, the bonds are unlikely to be a viable investment option for banks which have earlier been the biggest buyers of such paper. Without bank support, the oil PSUs will find it hard to bridge the losses caused by their inability to price the goods on a par with the global price of crude.

 We are not giving SLR (statutory liquidity ratio) status to oil bonds. There is no decision to give SLR status to oil bonds, finance minister P. Chidambaram said here today. It is mandatory for commercial banks to park 25 per cent of their deposits in SLR.

 The government is set to issue bonds worth Rs 14,150 crore to oil companies in the third quarter to help them cut losses caused by the government cap on retail fuel prices. The plan is to issue Rs 28,000 crore of bonds in the current fiscal as partial compensation for the subsidy on LPG and kerosene and the under-recoveries on petrol and diesel. 

 The oil bonds are essentially IOU slips of the government which the oil companies can encash at a discount to tide over any liquidity crunch. Oil firms will have to offer much bigger discounts if the banks are loath to buy the bonds. 

 Chidambaram also said the governments borrowing programme in early September is on schedule. The government will sell two bonds worth Rs 9,000 crore between September 4 and 12. The minister said he expected the economy to grow close to 8 per cent this year, and the government was confident of reaching its target for indirect taxes. 

 Customs duty increased 33.5 per cent year-on-year in the first four months of the current fiscal, while excise duties rose 8.8 per cent and service taxes 63.9 per cent.

 Orthodox gap stirs bitter brew in tea export

 Hard at work

 Calcutta, July 2: Indian tea is ceding the ground to rivals due to high packing duties, freight rates and lower production of the orthodox variety which is in demand globally.

 Sri Lanka, which produces the orthodox variety, caters to the CIS, West Asia and Europe.

 Between January and November 2005, Sri Lanka exported 47.8 million kg to Russia alone, while Indian exports during the whole of 2005-06 to Russia and CIS were 41.9 million kg.

 In the same period, the UAE was the second largest buyer of Sri Lankan tea at 33.3 million kg. India, however, exported only around 26.03 million kg in 2005-06.

 The difference is particularly striking for Iran. While Sri Lanka sold 22.7 million kg to Iran, India exported only 5.27 million kg.

 Indias domestic market consumption has been growing at 3 per cent. The country can produce both the CTC and the orthodox. However, since consumption pattern determines the manufacturing policy, the orthodox production is insignificant in a CTC-dominant domestic market. As a result, India loses out on these orthodox markets, said Bharath Arya, CEO of JV Gokal amp; Co Pvt Ltd and past president of Calcutta Tea Traders Association.

 In 2005, while Kenya exported 77.9 million kg of the CTC to Egypt, India sold only 0.69 million kg. In the same period, Pakistan imported 98.3 million kg from Kenya and 10.57 million kg from India.

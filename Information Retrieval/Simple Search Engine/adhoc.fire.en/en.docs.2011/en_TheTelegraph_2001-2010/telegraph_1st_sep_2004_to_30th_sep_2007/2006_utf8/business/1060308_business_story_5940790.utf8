 Cisco in $51-m deal

 New York, March 7 (Reuters): Communications equipment maker Cisco Systems Inc on Tuesday said it will buy privately held video surveillance company SyPixx Networks Inc for $51 million in cash and stock options.

 The Waterbury, Connecticut-based company makes technology that allows companies to connect their older security video systems to Internet-based networks without having to replace them, a Cisco executive said.

 Many of the traditional video surveillance systems are analog... Everything is put on videotapes, said Marthin De Beer, vice-president of Ciscos Emerging Markets Technologies Group. If you have to go back and (resolve) a problem or an investigation, its a very time-consuming process.

 Cisco expects to close the acquisition during the third quarter of its financial year.

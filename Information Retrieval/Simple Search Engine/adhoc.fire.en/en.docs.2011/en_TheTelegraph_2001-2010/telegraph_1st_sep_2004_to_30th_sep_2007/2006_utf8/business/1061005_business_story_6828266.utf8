 Banks in queue to raise funds

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Money matters

 Calcutta, Oct. 4: With six months to go before the Basel II standards become mandatory, domestic banks are gearing up to raise money from the market to provide for the stringent capital adequacy requirements. In the new regime, banks will have to provide for adequate capital against credit and operational risks as well as interest rate and market risks. Moreover, they will have to set aside more capital to support increased lending.

 The State Bank of India will raise Rs 1,350 crore through upper tier II bonds. With this, the banks total upper tier II capital mobilisation will be Rs 6,000 crore.

 The bank is also raising Rs 5,800 crore through lower tier II bonds. Moreover, it has chalked out a certificate of deposit programme that aims at raising Rs 3,000 crore.

 Uco Bank has revised its borrowing programme, which initially aimed at raising Rs 5,000 crore through a certificate of deposit (CoD). The revised programme aims at raising Rs 6,000 crore.

 Besides the CoD, the bank also plans to raise Rs 450 crore through innovative perpetual debt instruments qualifying for tier I capital.

 Uco Bank is also raising Rs 800 crore through upper tier II bonds and another Rs 700 crore in lower tier II capital. 

 In the last week of September, Allahabad Bank also issued unsecured, redeemable, subordinated bonds in the nature of promissory notes to raise its tier II capital. The issue aimed at raising Rs 600 crore, including a greenshoe option (retaining oversubscription) of Rs 300 crore. Another public sector bank, namely Dena Bank, has drawn up a plan to borrow Rs 300 crore by issuing upper tier II bonds. 

 Many other banks have recently raised hefty sums under their upper tier II, lower tier II and tier I funds. 

 UTI Bank has raised Rs 214 by issuing unsecured subordinated bonds in the nature of debentures for inclusion in its tier I capital. 

 While the banks are queuing up to raise their tier II capital, their cost of mobilising such funds varied widely over the last couple of months. For example, UTI Bank could mobilise Rs 214 crore by issuing 10-year bonds at a coupon interest rate of 10.05 per cent, Allahabad Bank raised its funds (Rs 561.90 crore) by issuing bonds of the same tenure, i.e., 10 years, at 8.85 per cent only.

 Experts believe that banks, which are planning to tap the market with their tier II bonds now would be able to raise funds at a lower cost than those which tapped the market a couple of months ago.

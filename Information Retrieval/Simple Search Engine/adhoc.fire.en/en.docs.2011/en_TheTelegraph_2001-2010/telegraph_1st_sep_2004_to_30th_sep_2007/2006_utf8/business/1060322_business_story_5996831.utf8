 Tata Sponge set to spend Rs 700 cr on twin plans

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 21: Tata Sponge Ltd, the Tata Steel subsidiary, will invest Rs 700 crore to develop a coal mine and set up a power plant. 

 The company has been allotted a couple of coal blocks with a proven reserve of 200 million tonne.

 It will spend Rs 300 crore to develop the mine and a washery, while the rest of the fund will be deployed for a 100-megawatt thermal power plant.

 The mine has to be developed within three years, as stipulated by the coal ministry, although the company is hopeful of completing the job before that.

 With Tata Sponges current 4-lakh tonne sponge iron making capacity located at Joda and Keonjhor in Orissa, it requires over 6-lakh tonne coal annually.

 The backward integration will not only provide a captive source of the raw material but also bring down the cost of coal.

 As compared with Rs 2,400-3,000 a tonne market price, the captive cost would be less than Rs 1,000 a tonne in the long run, sources said.

 However, the company will continue to buy high-grade coal since the captive coal block allocated to it is of high ash content.

 While Tata Sponge uses coal with 24 per cent ash content, the block has 35-40 per cent ash.

 The washing would throw up middlings, which would be used to generate power. The plant will be developed at the pit head, 300 kilometer away from the plant at Joda.

 The company will sell the entire power to utilities. As a result, the effective cost of coal will be lower.

 Tata Sponge hopes to step up the sponge iron capacity to 1 million tonne. 

 In the second phase of its expansion, the company plans to diversify into steel making. All these will significantly increase its coal requirement in the future.

 A lot will, however, depend on market conditions.

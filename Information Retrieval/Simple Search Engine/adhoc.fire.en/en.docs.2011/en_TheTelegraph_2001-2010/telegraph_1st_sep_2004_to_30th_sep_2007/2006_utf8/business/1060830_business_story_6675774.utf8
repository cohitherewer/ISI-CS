 Bayer to revamp agrochemicals unit

 Rejig pill

 Frankfurt, Aug. 29 (Reuters): German drugs and chemicals group Bayer unveiled a revamp at its agrochemicals unit after strong healthcare earnings helped the company post a 14 per cent rise in second-quarter operating profit on Tuesday. 

 Earnings before interest, tax and special items from continuing operations rose to 928 million euros ($1.19 billion), better than the average forecast of 875 million euros in a Reuters poll of 15 analysts. 

 Bayer said it would cut 1,500 jobs and close or restructure factories at its CropScience unit in a plan designed to save 300 million euros a year. 

 CropScience, which vies with Switzerlands Syngenta for the top spot in the agrochemicals market, posted a higher-than-expected rise in earnings due to cost cuts. 

 Bayer shares rose as much as 1.2 per cent but were nearly flat at 39.47 euros at 0804 GMT, in line with the DAX bluechip index.

 Its a mixed picture HealthCare has been strong as expected, CropScience better than estimated, and MaterialScience somewhat disappointing, said Sal Oppenheim analyst Ludger Mues. 

 At MaterialScience, theres price pressure on polycarbonate, and the unit is feeling the first impact of new capacities, he said. 

 Analysts say a chemical sector upswing that has boosted profitability for the past two years is fading amid capacity increases, a slowdown in demand and high raw material costs. 

 In recent quarters, the upswing has benefited Bayers MaterialScience unit, which makes plastics and chemicals. 

 Mues downgraded Bayer to neutral from buy, citing doubts about the chemical sectors prospects, poor profitability at CropScience and slight setbacks to its drugs unit in the recent past, such as generic competition and pipeline problems. 

 Bayer, which has bought rival drugmaker Schering for around 17 billion euros, said it expected underlying earnings from continuing operations before interest and tax to rise this year, even excluding Schering. Sales rose 5.8 per cent to 7.07 billion euros in the quarter, compared with the 7.207 billion-euro average from the poll. 

 Healthcare boost

 During the quarter, Bayer captured control of Schering in the biggest deal of its 143-year history and announced the surprise sale of its diagnostics unit to Siemens for 4.2 billion euros. It also plans to sell its HC Starck and Wolff Walsrode chemicals units. 

 Given the fact that all business units will be heavily restructured and integrated over the next two years, reported numbers will contain higher uncertainties, said Kepler Equities analyst Lutz Grueten. 

 Underlying earnings before interest and tax rose 24 per cent in the quarter at its HealthCare unit, 23 per cent at CropScience and by less than 5 per cent at its MaterialScience unit.

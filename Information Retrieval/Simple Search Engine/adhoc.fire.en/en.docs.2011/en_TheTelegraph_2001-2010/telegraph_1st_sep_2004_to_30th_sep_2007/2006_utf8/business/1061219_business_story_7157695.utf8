 Move to jam Airtel line

 Mittal: Not welcome

 Mumbai, Dec. 18: Sunil Mittal may have tossed his hat into the ring as the predators circle Hutch, but he may find himself locked out of the bidding process by a raft of regulations that bar the creation of monopolies.

 The rules could also force him to cede precious spectrum. 

 Rivals have started circulating a report to explain just why Airtel cant snap up Hutch. The mergers and acquisitions conditions of the licence policy have ruled out Sunil Mittal from the race, says the note.

 The argument is based on the premise that under the guidelines for mergers framed in February 2004, no merged entity can hold more than 15 Mhz of spectrum in a licence area.

 If Airtel and Hutch merge, the merged entity will have to vacate spectrum in at least eight circles where they together hold over 15 Mhz, says the note. It does, however, concede that Mittal will have the discretion to decide in which band he wishes to surrender the spectrum.

 But there are other problems as well. Under the merger rules, the duration of the licence of the merged entity is equal to the duration of the licence of the acquiring company. 

 This condition could pose problems in the seven circles where Hutch has just secured licences. The new licences of Hutch would either have to be returned or else their duration would come down by as much as eight years in some circles, it adds.

 There is one way out: Airtel could try a reverse merger with Hutchison Essar in order to extend the duration of the licences. But this is also fraught with problems since it could face severe resistance from Bhartis shareholders and would require significant legal and regulatory compliances from the exchanges and Sebi, says the note.

 But the biggest problem is that it would create a telecom titan that would create a monopoly situation in several circles. The merged entity would exceed 67 per cent marketshare and that would be in breach of the mergers and acquisitions guidelines under the licence conditions, the note adds.

 Monopoly market situation is defined as a market share of 67 per cent or above within a given service area, as on the last day of the previous month. Subscriber base shall be the criteria for computing the market share, the note said.

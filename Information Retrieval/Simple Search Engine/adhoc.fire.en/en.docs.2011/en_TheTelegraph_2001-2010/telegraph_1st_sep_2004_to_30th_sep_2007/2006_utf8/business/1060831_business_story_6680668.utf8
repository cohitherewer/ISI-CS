 Sterlite on cabinet agenda

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 New Delhi, Aug. 30: The cabinet will take up tomorrow the proposal to return the cheque for Rs 1,098.89 crore that Sterlite Industries had sent to the government to buy out the remaining stake in aluminium firm Bharat Aluminium Company Ltd (Balco) through a call option. 

 The cabinet may also decide on the setting up of the arbitration panel to settle the dispute. The likely members of the panel are: secretary (legal affairs) along with the secretaries for divestment and mines.

 The manoeuvres put the government in direct confrontation with the Anil Agarwal-controlled Sterlite Industries and come on the heels of the report by the comptroller and auditor-general that criticised the sell-off when the NDA government was in power.

 Sterlite said it has the rights to the remaining equity in Balco in which it bought a majority stake. To cement its right, the company sent an unsolicited cheque for the remaining shares to the government.

 The government, however, is abiding by the decision of attorney-general Milon Banerjee who ruled that put and call options in buyouts are not valid in India. Banerjee also made adverse comments on the manner in which the residual share sale price was fixed by SBI Caps.

 The cabinet will also weigh the stand that we need not sell the shares to Sterlite at all, officials said. An arbitration panel was part of the shareholders agreement which was signed four years ago when a 51 per cent stake in Balco was sold to Sterlite for a mere Rs 550 crore. The Congress, which was in the Opposition then, had criticised the deal. 

 The cabinet note, circulated to the ministries concerned, says that the government should accept the advice of the attorney-general. 

 In its written opinion, Banerjee said in view of sections within the Companies Act 1956 and Indian Contract Act 1872, the provision of valuation date and call option do not survive and consequently Sterlite cannot exercise option or bind the government of India to accept the same.

 The attorney-general has also made it clear that the government has three options to choose from freely negotiate sale of the rump shares with Sterlite or any other third party based on market rate, go in for a public issue or decide not to sell the shares at all if it feels that would be in public interest and profitable for Balco.

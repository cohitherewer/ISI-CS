 Mumbai, March 6: If all goes well, Fiat of Italy will market Tata Motors? Indica cars through its outlets in Europe ? reciprocating a distribution alliance that was cemented here today under which 44 Tata Motors outlets across the country will sell both Tata and Fiat cars.

 ?The two companies will explore various options while deciding on areas of co-operation. We will also explore the possibility of distributing Tata Motors? cars in the European market as part of the overall business plan,? said Giovanni de Filippis, managing director, Fiat India Pvt Ltd. 

 ?Discussions are on to explore other areas of co-operation in passenger cars, on which specific announcements can be expected once their feasibility is established,? said Rajiv Dube, senior vice-president (manufacturing and commercial passenger cars), Tata Motors. 

 Fiat and the Tatas have signed a memorandum of understanding under which they intend to explore the feasibility of development, manufacturing, sourcing and distribution of products, aggregates and components across various markets. 

 Tata Motors had entered into an agreement with MG Rover group to market Indica cars under the City Rover brand in the UK and Europe. However, the arrangement collapsed when the Rover group plunged into a crisis. Ever since, Tata Motors has been selling Indica cars in these countries on its own. 

 Tata Motors recently unveiled a new multi-utility lifestyle concept vehicle, called the Cliffrider, at the Geneva Auto Show. 

 On the occasion, the company?s managing director Ravi Kant said Tata Motors was looking at various options to reconnect with the UK and European markets. 

 Tata Motors exported 4,257 vehicles in February compared with 3,290 vehicles in the same month last year, representing an increase of 29.4 per cent. The cumulative sales from exports in the current period amounted to 44,031 vehicles, a growth of 66 per cent over the corresponding period in the previous year. 

 The Tatas and Fiat Motors plan to expand the dealership network in India which now covers 11 cities and addresses 70 per cent of the market that Fiat is present in, said Filippis.

 Fiat has a plant in Kurla, a Mumbai suburb, with an installed capacity of 60,000 cars a year and a second plant in Ranjangaon, also in Maharashtra. ?We have restarted our Kurla plant and the decision to ramp up production will depend on the increase in demand from the new dealership network,? said Filippis. 

 Tata Motors has also taken over the marketing of Fiat cars in India. Leo Burnett will handle the advertising of all Fiat cars, while Starcom India will look after the media planning and buying.

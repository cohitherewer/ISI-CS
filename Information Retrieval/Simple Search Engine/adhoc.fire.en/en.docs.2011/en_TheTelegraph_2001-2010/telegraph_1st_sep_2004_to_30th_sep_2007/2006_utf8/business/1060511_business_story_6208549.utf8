 Toyota earnings rise 53%

 Tokyo, May 10 (Reuters): Toyota Motor Corp, the worlds most profitable car maker, booked a 53 per cent rise in quarterly operating profit on Wednesday on healthy sales, cost cuts and a weaker yen, and predicted more growth this year despite currency headwinds and a spike in capital outlays.

 Riding a reputation for making good, reasonably priced cars, Japans top auto maker has won over customers around the globe, adding half-a-million cars to its annual sales for the past five years. It expects to build more than 9 million vehicles in 2006.

 Toyota, whose market capitalisation of $217 billion values it higher than the South African economy, has cranked up profits to record levels even as it faced soaring raw materials prices and cut-throat competition and spent more on facilities and vehicle development.

 Compiling group-based earnings forecasts for the first time, the leading maker of fuel-sipping hybrid cars projected a modest 1.2 per cent rise in operating profit to 1.9 trillion yen ($17 billion) in the year to end-March 2007.

 The conservative estimates are understandable given that (Detroits) Big Three are not doing so well, said Kazuhide Hayashi, a fund manager at Norinchukin Zenkyoren Asset Management.

 A survey of 21 brokers put the profit figure at a more bullish 2.013 trillion yen for 2006-07. The growth would come despite a rise in anticipated capital expenditure to a record 1.55 trillion yen this year from 1.5288 trillion yen spent last year, with new capacity coming online in China, North America and Russia over the next few years.

 We want to further strengthen the momentum of rising revenue and profits, president Katsuaki Watanabe told a news conference.

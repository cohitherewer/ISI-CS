 TGIF develops taste for Calcutta

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 29: TGI Friday, the popular American restaurant chain, is coming to Calcutta.

 The global restaurant chain, known as Thank God Its Friday, has bought a 25.1 per cent stake in its Indian franchisee, Bistro Hospitality Pvt Ltd, for an undisclosed amount and plans to open 25 restaurants in the next three to four years. Our purpose for investing together is to create a catalyst for growth. We aim to treble our investment and number of restaurants in the next three to four years, said Rajan Jetley, chairman, Bistro Hospitality.

 The chain plans to open 25 restaurants in Calcutta, Chandigarh, Jaipur, Pune, Hyderabad and Chennai, besides a few more in Delhi and Mumbai. The chain has chalked out an investment of approximately Rs 100 crore, he said.

 TGI Friday, including the upcoming project in Delhi, has six restaurants in the country and a turnover of Rs 25 crore.

 Depending on the locality, each restaurant would cost anywhere between Rs 3 crore and Rs 4 crore. The cost of land is not included in this, said Jetley, adding that investments would be managed through internal accruals and debt, if need be.

 TGI Friday, owned by US-based Carlson Restaurants, has a presence in 55 countries and about 920 food joints worldwide. The group is looking at rapidly growing in India, said Richard T. Snead, president, Carlson Restaurants Worldwide. Indias growing economy, sizeable emerging middle class and high interest in American goods and services make it an important market for us, he said.

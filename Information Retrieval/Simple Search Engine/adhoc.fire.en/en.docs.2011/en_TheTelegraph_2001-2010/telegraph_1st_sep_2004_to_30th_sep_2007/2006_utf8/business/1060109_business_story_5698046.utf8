 Andhra Bank scrip beats offer drag

 The announcement of a fresh issue of shares is normally the signal for a stock to start falling, as worries about earnings dilution rear their head. Not so with Andhra Bank, whose follow-on issue has led to a sharp rise in the price of the stock, up over 15 per cent in a week, well above the rise in the BSE bankex. Hopefully, the management will not let this rally influence the pricing.

 In 2005, the scrip has actually underperformed the bankex, rising by only about 20 per cent compared with the 70 per cent rise in the bankex. Thats probably because Andhra Banks net profit growth in the first half of the year has been negative, with the operating profit falling sharply. But thats entirely due to much lower profits on sale of investments. The fall in net profits is less steep, because of lower provisions on account of lower NPAs and transfer of investments to the held-to-maturity category. Since net NPAs are down to 0.26 per cent, provisions should be low going forward, boosting profits.

 Net interest income is up 4 per cent year-on-year in the first half of the year, fee-based revenues are up sharply and advances increased by 32 per cent.

 The issue will dilute capital by 21.25 per cent. The bank has been able to grow EPS by 21 per cent in the second quarter. If it can maintain that, and it is very likely that with extra funds growth too will rise, the increase in capital should be earnings-accretive within a year.

 Nalco forecast

 Nalco chairman C.R. Pradhan has said his companys profits this fiscal will beat his target of Rs 1,245 crore because of strong aluminium prices. Thats hardly a revelation, since analysts profit estimates for the year are already much higher. Whats interesting, however, is the reported plan of the company to increase the proportion of the alumina it sells on a spot basis. Spot alumina prices are very high, and the move will help prop up margins, under pressure from rising power costs.

 The companys position as one of the worlds low-cost producers of aluminium and alumina will help it reap good returns from a market that continues to be very tight, and is likely to be so for the next few years. The Chinese government has doubled the tax on aluminium exports, and there has been a rebound for demand in the US. Capacities are closing in the US and in Europe and smelters are under pressure in China. The upshot: higher aluminium prices, as announced by the Indian aluminium companies this month. 

 The Nalco chairman also said hell be able to squeeze out higher volumes through efficiencies. In short, the company is in a sweet spot.

 Shy about acquisitions

 Why are companies so shy of letting their shareholders know how much they have paid for acquisitions? India Inc is on a takeover spree abroad but, faced with the reluctance of company management to disclose the financials of the companies acquired and the costs of the deal, shareholders have no idea whether the deal will be a good one. And its well known that not all M amp;A deals add value. Recent examples of management coyness: M amp;Ms takeover of Stokes, Bharat Forges takeover of FAW Forging. Its high time that Sebi sits up and forces public companies to disclose all relevant details of M amp;A deals, to enable shareholders to form an opinion about them.

 New Delhi, April 30: Could Moser Baers entry into the photovoltaic cells market clubbed with the demand for its DVD-R products, which industry pundits believe will double this fiscal, result in a financial turnaround for Indias largest and the worlds third largest optical storage device company?

 If the financial results of the last two quarters of 2005-06, are any indicators, Moser Baer, after reporting heavy losses in 2004-05, seems to be on an upsurge. 

 The company is optimistic about maintaining a positive growth rate. 

 Moser Baer India, executive director, Ratul Puri, attributed the losses to structural problems and rising raw material cost. Well, what happened in the last 12-18 months was a result of a structural problem, which resulted due to excessive investments over 3-4 years, he told The Telegraph.

 The company had last year announced plans to get into the solar cells market. Moser Baer intends to put the revenues it draws from the production of the photovoltaic cells back into the business.

 Report on full float keeps all guessing

 Mumbai, July 31: A committee headed by S.S. Tarapore, the former deputy governor of Reserve Bank of India (RBI), today submitted a report setting a new roadmap for full convertibility of the rupee amid speculation that the panel may not call for a fast pace to attain this much discussed economic reform. 

 No details were available on the committees recommendations, though the central bank said it would place the report in the public domain over the next few days. 

 This is the second roadmap that is being drawn up by Tarapore. Back in July 1997, he had drawn up a three-stage process for full convertibility but it ran into the ground after the Asian currency meltdown later in the year. 

 The issue was never re-visited until March this year when Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said the countrys economic condition both internally and externally had become comfortable. 

 It was after this statement that the committee was appointed by the central bank in consultation with the Union government.

 While the mandate was to set out a framework for fuller capital account convertibility, Tarapore chaired the committee with most of the other members largely remaining the same. The other members in this committee include M.G. Bhide, R.H. Patil, Surjit Bhalla, A.V. Rajwade and Ajit Ranade.

 Though there is no formal definition of capital account convertibility (CAC), the Tarapore committee in 1997 defined it as the freedom to convert local financial assets into foreign financial assets and vice versa at market determined rates of exchange. This means that full capital account convertibility would enable all to move from local currency into foreign currency and back without any restrictions.

 Then, the committee had laid down a three-year road-map ending 1999-2000 for CAC.

 It cautioned that this time-frame could be speeded up or delayed depending on the success achieved in establishing certain pre-conditions that included strengthening of the financial system, fiscal consolidation and having a mandated rate of inflation.

 Some pre-requirement criteria that Tarapore had suggested the first time round may sound laughable now: for example, he said then the country should have forex reserves of $22 billion. Last week, the RBI reported reserves of close to $163.34 billion.

 Tarapore had also said the country should be able to fully meet its debt service payments. While he then stipulated that short-term debt and FII investments should be less than 60 per cent of the countrys forex reserves, this now stands at 37 per cent. 

 The only major pillar where the pre-condition has not yet been met by quite a mile relates to the fiscal situation. Here, the committee had stipulated a gross fiscal deficit of 0.5 per cent by 1999-2000. This is now at over 4 per cent. The issue of non-performing assets (NPAs) is also another area where the requirement is falling short. Against the mandated stipulation of 5 per cent gross NPAs, it is now at 5.2 per cent.

 The Tarapore committee had then mooted fixing of an average inflation target of 3 to 5 per cent. Though such a figure has not yet been fixed, the central bank has voluntarily put a target of 5 per cent over the medium term.

 Even as the second report from Tarapore is keenly awaited, the years gone by has seen the central bank gradually lifting controls, though there are limits fixed.

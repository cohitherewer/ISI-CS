 April 13: Investors today gave a rousing reception to the Ambanis who returned to the capital markets with a public issue after a gap of 12 years.

 The initial public offering of Reliance Petroleum Ltd (RPL), a Mukesh Ambani group company, was oversubscribed 7.5 times on the opening day itself ? an indication that the Ambani tag still holds a thrall over the capital markets.

 RPL is offering 45 crore shares through the book-building route with an indicative price band of Rs 57 to 62 per share. At the upper end of the price band, today?s subscription placed the total demand at roughly Rs 21,000 crore, the highest ever recorded on the first day of an IPO.

 A strong indicator of the confidence that investors have in the older Ambani scion and his new refinery project was evident from the fact that it came on a day when foreign institutional investors relentlessly sold shares on the bourses that sent the sensex skidding by another 119 points.

 Sources associated with the RPL issue said the response came from a wide range of investors. The issue was fully subscribed within 10 minutes of its opening. Within three hours, the IPO was subscribed by more than five times.

 Cumulative data available from both the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and the National Stock Exchange (NSE) late in the evening showed that against an issue size of 45 crore shares, bids were received for over 338 crore shares. This indicated a subscription figure of around 7.5 times.

 At the upper end of the price band, RPL will be valued at around Rs 28,000 crore as it will have a total equity of 450 crore shares. Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) yesterday made a payment of Rs 5,580 crore as it subscribed to 90 crore shares at a price of Rs 62 per share. Banks and financial institutions have also subscribed to shares that were offered to them before the IPO opened.

 Brokers said investors? confidence was also boosted by Wednesday?s announcement that Chevron Corporation of the US had picked up 5 per cent in RPL for $300 million. The US oil giant has the option to acquire an additional 24 per cent in RPL.

 Earlier in the day, Reliance Industries officials told reporters at a roadshow for the RPL issue in Calcutta that Chevron Corporation would help Reliance procure extra heavy crude for processing at the proposed export-oriented refinery in Jamnagar.

 The US company has assets across the globe. ?The extra heavy crude is generally found in Latin America and west Africa,? Nikhil R. Meswani, executive director of RIL, said. Meswani said Chevron would also help the company market its refined product in the North American and European markets.

 Trade plan to open job gates

 Trade truths

 New Delhi, April 6: Commerce minister Kamal Nath will focus on creating more jobs in his annual supplement to the foreign trade policy to be unveiled here tomorrow. 

 Sources said the thrust of the policy would be to promote certain products and develop specific markets through budgetary support to infrastructure and in marketing. These measures will be implemented in a WTO compatible manner. 

 The thrust on creating more employment through exports will put the spotlight on agriculture, as it has the highest potential for generating jobs. Similarly, marine exports are also expected to figure as an important commodity group. 

 The government is keen to develop a cold chain to store agricultural goods and give a fillip to the food processing industry so that exports pick up and generate more income for the politically sensitive farm sector. 

 Most of the current incentives to boost exports will continue, as the commerce ministry feels its strategy has been successful in promoting exports. 

 Sources said the export promotion capital goods (EPCG) scheme is likely to be liberalised, so that exporters get more time to fulfil their obligations under the scheme. The scheme allows exporters to import capital equipment at 5 per cent customs duty, provided for over 10 years they fulfil an export obligation that is eight times the duty saved.

 The government has been stuck in long drawn litigation in several cases for recovering the duty and the commerce ministry feels that if the repaying time is increased by about two years it will be easier for exporters to fulfil their obligation. 

 The new exim policy is also expected to simplify procedures further so that the ministry is seen more as an enabling ministry for promoting double digit export growth on a sustainable basis, a senior official said. 

 The government has already extended the export incentive duty entitlement passbook (DEPB) scheme by one year till March 2007.

 The DEPB scheme neutralises customs duty on the import content of products exported. It is the most popular scheme among exporters covering about 50 per cent of the countys merchandise exports. 

 It was decided to scrap the scheme as it was not WTO compatible and replace it with a new one that will provide incentives to exporters.

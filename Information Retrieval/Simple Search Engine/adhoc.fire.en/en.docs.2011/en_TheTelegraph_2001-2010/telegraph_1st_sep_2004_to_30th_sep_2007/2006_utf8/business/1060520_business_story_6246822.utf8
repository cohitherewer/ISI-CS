 Bajaj Auto focus on overseas markets

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, May 19: Bajaj Auto will ramp up its exports this fiscal. It is focussing on Indonesia, Brazil, Argentina, Iran and Nigeria.

 The company has closed a deal with its manufacturing partner in Jakarta and is all set to roll out its two-wheelers there by June. 

 It will enter Brazil through a partnership, while an investment kitty has been readied for Argentina, said Sanjiv Bajaj, executive director, Bajaj Auto Ltd. We are looking at entering Brazil through a partnership for our two and three wheelers. Also, we are planning to invest in Argentina. 

 Bajaj has already re-entered Iran and sold a few units of Pulsar there. By July-August, we will start selling in Iran in a big way, targeting almost half-a-million bikes by the end of the year, he said. 

 The auto major is setting up an assembly plant for bikes in Nigeria. We are test marketing our bikes in Nigeria and will start selling our products by September. 

 Talking about the companys plans of entering the four-wheeler market, Bajaj said, Right now, we are evaluating our entry. It will take 2-4 years to finalise. We have to finalise the design and investment. 

 Riding a sales of 2.28 million units of two and three-wheelers and 1.91 million motorcycles, Bajaj Auto has reported a net profit of Rs 321.79 crore for the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2006, against Rs 239.68 crore in the corresponding previous period.

 Net sales stood at Rs 2,165.8 crore compared with Rs 1,634.61 crore a year ago. 

 For 2005-06, net profit grew 47 per cent at Rs 1,123 crore. Turnover posted a year-on-year growth of 28 per cent at Rs 8,106 crore. 

 The company has announced a dividend of Rs 40 per share. 

 However, the robust earnings could not help the company on the bourses today, as the market continued to bleed for the second day. The stock closed lower at Rs 2,949.80, a loss of 2.07 per cent.

 Talking about the rising fuel prices, Bajaj said small hikes in fuel prices actually help the company, as it gives a boost to the replacement market. 

 The rise in metal prices have not affected us so far. But in the long run, if there are big hikes in metal prices, they may affect us. Sharp hikes in both fuel prices and interest rates can hurt us too, he added.

 Mumbai flood hits Oriental profit

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, June 20: Mumbai floods eroded Oriental Insurances bottomline last year. High payouts following the flood brought down the companys net profit to Rs 283.91 crore in 2005-06 from Rs 330.52 crore in the previous fiscal, a 14.1 per cent drop.

 The board has proposed a 50 per cent dividend on a Rs 10 share that would involve an outgo of Rs 50 crore. 

 The drop in net has been attributed to large claims in Mumbai following the floods last year, increase in expenses on account of a salary hike and a large provision for an income tax case that is under litigation.

 However, Orientals financial adviser, R.G. Viswanathan said the saving grace was an almost 20 per cent cut in the claims ratio of the companys motor insurance portfolio.

 Motor insurance comprises about 45 per cent of Orientals total portfolio. He said every year the losses in this section are between Rs 400 and Rs 500 crore on an average. 

 Orientals net incurred claims ratio in the motor insurance portfolio in 2005-06 was 92.64 per cent, lower than the preceding years claims ratio of 112.52 per cent. 

 The fall in the ratio was primarily due to higher disputes on motor claims that the company has been able to settle. 

 In fiscal 2006, the company settled 86,427 cases against 78,124 in the previous year. 

 Orientals gross premium last year was Rs 3,609.77 crore, up 16.8 per cent from the previous years Rs 3,090.55 crore.

 Premium rates

 Oriental Insurance is in the process of hiking premium rates for its individual mediclaim policy by up to 30 per cent for people in the higher age group. 

 We will relaunch the individual mediclaim policy by repacakaging it, chairman M. Ramadoss said.

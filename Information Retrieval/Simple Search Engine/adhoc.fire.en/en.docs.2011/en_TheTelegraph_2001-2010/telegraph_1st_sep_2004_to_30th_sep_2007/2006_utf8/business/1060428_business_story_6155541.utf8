 Jet first to slap fuel levy on fares

 Mumbai, April 27: Just when the action in the sky had started to hot up, high crude prices proved to be the party pooper. 

 When most airlines are falling over each other to reduce base fares on the domestic sectors, Jet Airways today announced the levy of a fuel surcharge of Rs 300 on all types of fare levels for both Club Premier and economy class tickets on all domestic routes. 

 The surcharge will be effective from May 1. 

 ?Fuel surcharge is levied by all the international airlines and we also charge it on our international sectors. However, we will be doing so for the first time on the domestic sectors,? said Saroj Dutta, executive director of Jet Airways. 

 The surcharge has been necessitated by the continued escalation in fuel prices (ATF). 

 ATF prices have shot through the roof in line with the sharp rise in global crude prices and have moved up 16 per cent from $521.95 per kilo litre in April 2005 to $604.23 per kilo litre now. 

 And thanks to high taxes, ATF prices in India are almost double that in other countries. Consequently, ATF has come to account for as much as 30 per cent of the operational costs of Indian carriers, against 15 per cent for airlines in other countries. 

 Other airlines are also re-assessing their positions to determine whether or not to follow Jet?s example and slap a fuel surcharge.

 ?We will take a call after evaluating the impact on our pricing,? said Ajay Singh of Spicejet. 

 The low cost airlines pitch their airfares against the first and second class train fares. The price hike will increase the differential between the fare classes, with train fares remaining at their levels. 

 Will this affect the no-frill airlines? ?We will continue to have a bucket of fares targeted at these customers, which will be comparable with rail fares,? added Singh. 

 Indian, the public sector carrier, has also adopted a wait-and-watch policy. Airlines officials say that no decision has been taken yet on a fare hike. 

 Jet will levy the surcharge on all tickets purchased within and outside India for both rupee and dollar tariffs. For tickets issued outside India, the same will be converted into local currency by using the applicable exchange rate. 

 The surcharge, which is non-commissionable, will be applicable on all domestic sectors irrespective of the point of sale or point of ticketing. It is also applicable on all domestic segments, even if the domestic segment is part of an international journey.

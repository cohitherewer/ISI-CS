 Whampoa clause rings hang-up alarm for Hutch brand name

 SAUMITRA DASGUPTA

 Mumbai, July 5: Five telecom companies within the Hutch India stable stand in real danger of losing the right to use the Hutch brand name if Hong Kong billionaire Li Kashings Hutchison Whampoa decides to activate a little-known proviso in the brand licensing agreement.

 If Li Kashing presses the button, only Mumbai would be able to use the Hutch brand name and even that could technically end if and when Hutchison Essar Ltd ? the countrys third largest mobile telephony company with a subscriber base of 11.4 million ? signs a brand name licensing deal with the Hong Kong-based conglomerate.

 The threat appears in the form of what is styled as change control provisions in the brand name licensing agreements that the five telecom companies ? Hutchison Essar Mobile Services Ltd, Hutchison Telecom East Ltd, Hutchison Essar South Ltd, Fascel Ltd and Aircel Digilink India Ltd ? have signed with Hutchison 3G Enterprises, a Hutchison group subsidiary. 

 Cayman Island-registered Hutchison Telecom International Ltd (HTIL) is the parent of Hutchison Essar and holds a 69.9 per cent stake in the Indian telecom company after last weeks acquisition of a 5.11 per cent stake from the Hindujas. In turn, Hutchison Whampoa holds approximately 49.8 per cent in Hutchison Telecom International (HTIL).

 The Indian telecom operations account for 41 per cent of HTIL overall revenues.

 Under the licence agreements between Hutchison 3G Enterprises S.? r.., or Hutchison 3G Enterprises, and our Hutch India operating companies, if the aggregate direct and indirect shareholding of Hutchison Whampoa or any one or more subsidiaries of Hutchison Whampoa in a licensee falls below threshold levels of 45 per cent, 40 per cent, 30 per cent and 20 per cent, then upon falling below each such threshold, Hutchison 3G Enterprises is entitled, for a period of 12 months, to terminate the brand licence, says Hutchison Telecom International Ltd in a July 1 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission of the US.

 Following the sale on December 21, 2005 of approximately 19.3 per cent of our shares by the Hutchison Whampoa group to Orascom Holding, Hutchison Whampoas aggregate direct and indirect shareholding in Hutch Indias operating companies fell below 40 per cent, thus entitling Hutchison 3G Enterprises to terminate the licence agreements with the Hutch India operating companies at any time prior to December 21, 2006. As of the date of this annual report, we have not received any notice of termination from Hutchison 3G Enterprises, although we cannot assure you that Hutchison 3G Enterprises will not issue such a notice, says the Form 20-F filing on June 29 with the SEC. This is the first time that the Hutchison group has articulated the existence of such a change control provision in any of its SEC filings and in such explicit terms.

 Hutchison Telecom East provides services in Calcutta. Hutchison Essar Mobile Services holds the licence for Delhi, while Hutchison Essar South provides services in Chennai, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh (West), and Bengal.

 Fascel provides cellular services in Gujarat. Aircel Digilink India is a 100 per cent subsidiary of Hutchison Telecom East and provides services in Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh (East).

 The proviso doesnt hurt Hutchison Essar ? the Mumbai service provider ? as yet because it still hasnt signed a brand licensing agreement. Hutchison Essar has a 49 per cent stake in Hutchison Essar South and owns 100 per cent in both Hutchison Essar Mobile Services Ltd and Fascel.

 There seems to be no apparent danger that Hutchison Whampoa will push the button but it could choose to do so if the Ruias, the 33.01 per cent minority partner in Hutchison Essar, cut up rough or if the government decides to frame rules that in some way hurt the interests of Hutchison Whampoa.

 We cannot assure you that the fees and terms of use will be commercially acceptable to us if we have to renegotiate these arrangements, the SEC filing added.

 The intellectual property rights to the Hutch brand name belongs to Hutchison Whampoa. HTIL has arrangements with the Hutchison Whampoa group to use 3, Hutch and Hutchison Telecom and other trademarks that include the word Hutchison or its derivations. 

 These are licensed to members within the Hutchison fraternity, including the Indian telecom companies on a royalty-free basis until the relevant change of control provisions as may be agreed between the relevant members of our group and the Hutchison Whampoa group are triggered, says the SEC filing.

 If the change control proviso is activated, the companies in the Hutch India stable could lose their royalty-free status and end up paying a hefty amount to use the brand name.

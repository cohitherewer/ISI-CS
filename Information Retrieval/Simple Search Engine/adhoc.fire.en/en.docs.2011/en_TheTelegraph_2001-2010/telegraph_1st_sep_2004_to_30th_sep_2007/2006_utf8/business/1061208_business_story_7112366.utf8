 Cheaper calls from US with Bharti card

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 7: Bharti Airtel today launched callhome a calling card service targeting over 2.5 million non-resident Indians (NRIs) based in the US.

 The new service will enable the US-based NRIs to call their family and friends in India at a nominal price of 7.9 cents per minute or Rs 3.52 per minute, said Manoj Kohli, president, Bharti Airtel.

 This makes callhome 40 per cent cheaper than most similar services offered by other telecom operators.

 The card offers uniform rates, whether to any Airtel mobile or landline or any other mobile or landline.

 Bharti is the second Indian telecom player, after Reliance Communications, to venture into the US. Reliance has a presence in the US, Canada, the UK and Australia through its Reliance India call service.

 The users of the Bharti callhome service have to create a personal account and download the calling service online. Thereafter, it works like an ordinary calling card whereby a customer dials the access number, gets ones identification verified and then calls the destination number. 

 It is currently available as a prepaid option with the card denominations ranging between $5 and $200. 

 Bharti, which added 1.65 million wireless users in November, expects the callhome service to get good response from expatriate Indians.

 With more than 2 million people making over 450 million minutes of calls a month to their families and friends in India using calling cards, we think callhome will be a big success, said Kohli. 

 The service would also be made available in the UK, West Asia and the Far East by the first quarter of 2007.

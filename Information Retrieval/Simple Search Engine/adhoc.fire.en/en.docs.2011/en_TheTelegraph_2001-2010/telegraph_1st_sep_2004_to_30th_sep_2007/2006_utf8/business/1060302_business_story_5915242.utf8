 New Delhi, March 1: A comprehensive bill to reform the insurance sector will be tabled in Parliament by the end of the budget session, Union finance minister P. Chidambram said today.

 The industry feels that the bill, which seeks to amend various provisions of the Insurance Act, 1938 and IRDA Act, 1999 now stands archaic.

 According to ICICI Prudential Life Insurance managing director Shikha Sharma, the bill will give more power to the insurance regulator and increase flexibility in operational issues.

 Insurance companies also want the FDI cap in the sector to be hiked to 49 per cent from the current 26 per cent. But this may be difficult as the Left is opposed to the move.

 In his budget speech yesterday, Chidambaram said the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) is examining the Narasimhan committee report on a comprehensive law for the sector.

 The finance minister also said there was a broad consensus on the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) legislation, barring disagreement on two issues with the Left parties.

 If I am able to resolve these issues with the allies, there are good chances of tabling the PFRDA bill in the current session of Parliament, he told industry during his post-budget interaction.

 For the PFRDA bill, a parliamentary committee has recommended a similar FDI cap for the pension and insurance sectors.

 Pointing that states have surplus funds and their loans amounting to Rs 1,03,710 crore has been consolidated, Chidambaram urged industry to ask states to improve infrastructure like roads.

 Regarding farm sector growth, he said the government has set a growth target of 4 per cent in 2006-07.

 We talk of a 10 per cent growth rate. Unless agriculture grows at 4 per cent, whatever combination and permutation we may try, we can not attain a 10 per cent growth, he told India Inc.

 The services sector also needs to witness a double-digit growth, he said. If it has any issue, I am willing to address that too, he added.

 Pointing out that the budget tackled the crucial issue of infrastructure in agriculture, Chidambaram said the corpus of the Rural Infrastructure Fund has been raised to Rs 10,000 crore, besides focusing on irrigation programmes and restoration of water bodies.

 Industry meet

 Chidambaram will meet industry captains on May 1 to discuss the removal of fiscal obstructions that come in the way of the governments target to achieve high growth in key sectors.

 Chidambaram: New strategy

 New Delhi, July 3: Finance minister P. Chidambaram will meet chief commissioners and director-generals of the income tax department tomorrow to work out ways to expand the taxpayer base and recover the arrears in collection.

 Revenue officials said the finance minister wanted the department to aim for a 15 per cent increase in the tax base over last year. There were 2.64 crore income tax assessees who filed returns last year.

 This year, the government expects the number of people filing returns to go up as a result of its two-pronged strategy.

 According to the strategy, the department will ask all companies and partnership firms to file returns regardless of whether they post profits or suffer losses. This will help plug tax loopholes.

 It will also insist that all men earning more than Rs 1 lakh and women earning over Rs 1.35 lakh file returns, regardless of the amount of tax paid. Senior citizens, who earn more than Rs 1.85 lakh, will similarly have to file returns.

 To help small tax payers file returns, the government is setting up around 321 help centres across the country.

 There would be at least one help centre under every direct tax commissionerate and the centres are being set up outside income tax offices, chambers of commerce and offices of chartered accountants, said CBDT chairperson M.H. Kherawala. ?All information will be provided free. No fee will be charged by the centres for helping file tax returns,? she said.

 These centres have started functioning from June 15. The facility will be available till August 15 and then for one month from March 1-31, she said.

 The help centres were first started last year. The last date for filing returns is July 31.

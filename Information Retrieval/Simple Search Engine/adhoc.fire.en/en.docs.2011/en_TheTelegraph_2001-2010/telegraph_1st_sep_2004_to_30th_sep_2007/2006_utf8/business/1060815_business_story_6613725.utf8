 Sebi slaps penalty on Citigroup

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Aug. 14: The Securities and Exchange Board of India today slapped a penalty of Rs 1 crore on Citigroup for violating FII regulations. 

 The market regulator had conducted an investigation into the issue of offshore derivative instruments by Citigroup Global Markets Holdings (CGMH), an affiliate of Citigroup Global Markets (Mauritius), to Magnus Capital Corporation (MCCL), an overseas corporate body (OCB). 

 Citigroup Global Markets (Mauritius) is a Sebi-registered sub-account of Citigroup Global Markets, the registered foreign institutional investor (FII). 

 Under the regulations, every FII is required to submit any information on its activities as and when required by Sebi or the Reserve Bank of India. And as sub-accounts are deemed to be FIIs, they are also governed by these rules. 

 Under these rules, Sebi had issued a circular dated August 8, 2003, whereby FIIs, along with its associates and clients, had to submit an undertaking that they would not issue, subscribe or purchase any offshore derivative instruments directly or indirectly to or from Indian residents or non-resident Indians, persons of Indian origins and overseas corporate bodies. 

 Sebi said, With regard to the above, Citigroup Global Markets (Mauritius) Ltd filed a statement and it is alleged that despite issuance of off-shore derivative instruments to an OCB, namely Magnus Capital Corporation, they gave an undertaking which was not true. 

 Citigroup had submitted the declaration to Sebi in the fortnightly statement on the issue of offshore derivative instruments on August 15, 2003. 

 However, it had mentioned that in relation to the instruments above, which constitute bilateral contracts, we represent that, to the best of our knowledge, none of the counter-parties are Indian residents or non-resident Indians, persons of Indian origins or OCBs.

 Citigroup also argued that as the offshore derivative instruments (ODI) were issued by CGMH and not by Citigroup Global Markets, which is the FII or its sub-account Citigroup Global Markets (Mauritius), it did not form part of the ODI report. 

 Sebi said since CGMH is an affiliate of CGMML, which is again a sub-account of CGML, the FII, it is established that Citigroup necessarily consists of all three entities. 

 Further, Sebi dismissed Citigroups claim that it was under the impression that MCCL was not an OCB as any registered entity cannot change the prescribed format of an undertaking as and when it desired. 

 Moreover, a communication from the Reserve Bank of India establishes MCCL as an OCB and a professionally managed global group like Citi cannot plead ignorance on such grounds. 

 Citigroup has been slammed by several regulators around the world. Its most serious indictment came two years ago when Japanese financial authorities ordered Citigroup Inc. to suspend its private-banking operations for because of a long list of quot;serious violations of laws and regulations quot; and quot;extremely inappropriate transactions. quot; 

 In 2003, Citigroup agreed to pay $120 million to Settle SEC allegations that it had helped Enron commit fraud.

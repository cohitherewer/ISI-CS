 CAG picks holes in selloffs

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 25: In a report on the probe into divestment deals conducted by the NDA government, the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) has pointed out flaws in most divestments, including those of VSNL, IPCL and Balco.

 The CAG has criticised the Balco and VSNL deals on grounds that they were undervalued. It also picked holes in the manner global advisers were selected and said no benchmark was fixed to shortlist bidders for opening of financial bids.

 Audit examination reveal instances of far too conservative assumptions made by the global advisers in seven out of nine PSUs... The assumptions had the potential of adversely impacting the business valuation, based on which the reserve price was fixed for divestment, CAG said in the report on divestment during 1999-2003.

 The report said the exercise of asset valuation did not appear to have been undertaken with due seriousness. CAG has pointed out inconsistencies in computation of equity value of almost all the companies that were divested.

 The methodology followed for asset valuation did not appear to be beneficial as the valuation was done without adequately considering all properties.

 In the case of Balco, the report said the valuation exercise never took into account assets like leasehold land on which the aluminium companys plant and housing colony stood, nor the railway sliding in Korba or accommodation in the SCOPE complex in the heart of New Delhi. Moreover, Balcos enhanced installed capacity of 1.31 lakh mt was also never taken into consideration and the valuation was based on the old capacity of 91,000 mt.

 Audit noticed a general trend in the divestment of PSUs that majority of bidders, who had initially submitted expressions of interest, withdrew during the process during due diligence, limiting the competition, the report tabled in Parliament today said.

 The CAG attributed the lack of interest among the prospective investors to the failure of global advisers to generate adequate competition at the bidding stage.

 It also came down heavily on the way the government changed goalposts at a later stage. The ministry of disinvestment became aware that if a clarification directing the two sister PSUs BSNL and MTNL was made to route their international calls through VSNL at least for some length of time after disinvestment, it would have enhanced the attractiveness of the offer. The decision on this actually came on January 29, 2002, two days before the receipt of financial bids.

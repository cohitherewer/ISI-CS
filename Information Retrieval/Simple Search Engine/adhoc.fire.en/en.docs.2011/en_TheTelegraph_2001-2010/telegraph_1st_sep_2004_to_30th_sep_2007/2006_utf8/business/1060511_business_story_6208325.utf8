 Govt stirs aid potion for tea growers

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Glad tidings

 Calcutta, May 10: The government will provide an assistance of Rs 74.41 lakh to over 14,883 tea growers in the current year from the price stabilisation fund.

 This fund provides financial relief to rubber, coffee and tea growers. The aid amount for a particular year is determined from a price band, which is calculated from the average domestic price of the commodity and its international rates.

 If the average annual domestic prices are within the price band, it is a normal year, if they are higher, its a boom and if they are lower, it signifies a distress year, Tea Board chairman Basudeb Banerjee said.

 In 2005, the annual average domestic price for tea was Rs 56.5 per kg. 

 It was Rs 53.65 per kg for coffee-robusta, Rs 104.34 per kg for coffee-arabica and Rs 60.68 per kg for natural rubber.

 Tea prices this year are expected to rise because of the Kenyan droughts causing a global shortage of CTC tea.

 In a normal year, the government and the grower contribute equally to the fund. The growers may withdraw their contribution during a distress year, whereas during a boom, only growers contribute. 

 Rubber, coffee robusta and coffee arabica had a boom year in 2005, whereas it was normal for tea.

 The price stabilisation fund trust was set up in April 2003 to regulate the prices of tea, coffee, natural rubber and tobacco when they fall below a specified level.

 The fund operates like a bank account wherein the grower puts in an initial amount and the government contributes Rs 500.

 The fund is under the aegis of the ministry of commerce.

 Sources said the minister of state for commerce, Jairam Ramesh, wants this scheme to be extended to include insurance for small growers. 

 A committee has been formed, which includes the minister for agriculture, to explore the possibilities of helping small growers tide over years of distress.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 The wait is over, steel prices go up

 - A day after the budget, companies are busy reading the fine print

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 1: A day after the Union budget was presented, domestic steel companies raised prices across the board. 

 The steel industry had expected finance minister P. Chidambaram to increase customs duty on imported steel. However, it did not come through. 

 ?Industry was waiting for budget proposals to finalise its course. It had a wish list that included increasing the duty to curb cheap import. But that did not materialise,? said an industry expert.

 Also, international prices of steel firmed up. Coupled with this, low inventory have led the companies increase prices.

 Tata Steel, Essar, JSW Steel and Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Ltd have effected an 8-10 per cent increase in hot rolled coil. In price terms, it would mean a hike of Rs 1,800-2,000 a tonne.

 The prices of long products will also go up by Rs 700-1,000 a tonne. 

 ?There is a robust demand in the market. The inventory level was down as people were expecting international prices to slide further. But that has not happened,? said Y. Sivasagar Rao, chairman and managing director of RINL.

 One of the reasons steel became cheaper last year was high inventory as traders piled up stocks fearing further escalation of prices.

 Last time, Indian steel companies raised prices marginally was in September.

 With the focus on infrastructure, the demand for long products would surely go up, Rao said.

 Tata Steel explained the hike as a ?market reality?. ?We have increased the prices of both HR and galvanised plain products for non-contract customers,? a company spokesperson said.

 Steel Authority of India Ltd, the country?s largest steel producers, also raised prices of both flat and long products by Rs 1,000-1,500.

 While internationally Indian steel is still cheaper, JSW Steel said the company plans to bridge this gap by further raising prices.

 One of the reasons that fuelled the price-rise was increase in truck freight rates, which have gone up by 30 per cent recently following a directive on overloading.

 Industry sources have confirmed that both Essar Steel and Ispat have increased prices. 

 Indian steel industry is estimated to be close to 40 million tonnes, growing by 8 per cent.

 Hindalco cuts price

 While steel prices have firmed up, aluminium firm Hindalco has cut prices by Rs 5,000 per tonne. The budget has proposed to reduce customs duty on primary and secondary non-ferrous metals like aluminium from 10 per cent to 7.5 per cent.

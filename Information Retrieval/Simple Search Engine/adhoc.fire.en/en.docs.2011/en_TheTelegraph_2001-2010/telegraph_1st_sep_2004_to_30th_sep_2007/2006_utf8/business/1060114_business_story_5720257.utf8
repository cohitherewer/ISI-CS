 Jets second market trip

 New Delhi, Jan. 13: Jet Airways today informed the Bombay Stock Exchange of its plans to tap the capital market again. 

 The airline is currently in talks for a possible takeover of or equity investment in Air Sahara.

 The Mumbai-based Jet Airways said it would hold a board meeting on January 21 to discuss raising external/internal resources through equity placement or debt.

 Jet Airways could go in for a depository receipt float to raise about Rs 2,500-3,000 crore, sources said.

 According to the market buzz, Jet Airways may use the issue proceeds to buy a stake worth Rs 3,000-3,500 crore in Air Sahara. Jet Airways chief Naresh Goyal and Sahara group head Subroto Roy are likely to meet over the weekend to discuss the issue, sources said.

 But Jet Airways may also use the proceeds to purchase some 40 aircraft it is trying to acquire. A bulk of the amount for aircraft purchase would come from loans, but shoring up equity would help leverage bigger and cheaper loans.

 The Jet Airways board is also likely to decide on the need to convene an extraordinary general meeting (EGM). An EGM is needed if Jet Airways and Air Sahara decide to go in for a strategic tie-up. The two sides have already confirmed that they are in talks, but added that there is no deal yet.

 In its notice to the bourses, Jet Airways said the board meeting would consider whether the company should make an equity or debt-related offering in India and/or overseas through a primary and/or secondary issue. The offering might comprise American depository receipts, global depository receipts, foreign currency convertible bonds or any other securities.

 Left spanner

 Meanwhile, one of the Left allies of the UPA government has alleged that the Air Sahara acquisition deal, along with a strategic alliance between Jet Airways and Air Deccan, would result in one cartel controlling around 60 per cent of the domestic aviation market.

 In a letter to finance minister P. Chidambaram and law minister H.R. Bharadwaj, RSP leader Abani Roy said they should intervene in this monopolistic attempt to capture the Indian skies, which would not only be anti-competitive but also anti-consumer.

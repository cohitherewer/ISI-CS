 Calcutta, Feb. 17: Tally Solutions is looking at closing this fiscal with a turnover of Rs 250 crore and expects overseas sales to go up from less than 10 per cent to 15 per cent in 2006-07. It also hopes to garner an additional revenue of Rs 150 to Rs 170 crore next fiscal with a new multilingual product.

 Small and medium enterprises, the fastest growing segment, contribute to around 60 per cent of the turnover. The company also plans to set up overseas subsidiaries in the near future. It has sent a sales team to explore north African markets and hopes to set up an office in May-June 2006.

 In a recent restructuring exercise, the SME, large enterprise and education divisions of the company have been merged and the business has been geographically divided into South Asia, West Asia, Asia Pacific and North Africa.

 The turnover for the last fiscal was Rs 200 crore, said Vinod P. John, executive vice-president, head-South Asia business, Tally Solutions.

 Tally will also set up 15 operational-cum-sales offices in 11 different locations around the country and the ones in the eastern region will be in Ranchi and Guwahati, besides Calcutta. After restructuring, Tally has set up a government systems group to cater to government accounting procedures, especially in panchayats, municipal corporations and self-help groups. 

 Tally Solutions had also acquired Vedha Automation in the past three months and is currently integrating its software titled Shopper with the recently launched Tally version 8.1, John said.

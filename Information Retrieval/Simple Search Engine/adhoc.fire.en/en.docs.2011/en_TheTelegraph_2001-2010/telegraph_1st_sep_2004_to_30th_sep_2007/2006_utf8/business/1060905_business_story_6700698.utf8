 Private wheat import offered duty sops

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Crash crop

 New Delhi, Sept. 4: The government will remove all duties on wheat imported by private traders to keep prices low.

 It had earlier reduced the duty on wheat imported by private traders to 5 per cent and that by state-run agencies to zero.

 As of today, there is no duty on imports of wheat, agriculture minister Sharad Pawar said. This facility will be available for the next 4-5 months, may be till December or January. The decision has already been taken and the orders will be issued soon, he added.

 Pawar said the measures should help overcome shortages and bring down wheat prices, which have been ruling high for about eight months now. However, the move is not likely to bring in a flood of wheat into Indian ports as the landed cost of wheat at the south or east Indian ports is at least $250 or Rs 11,250 a tonne compared with local prices ranging between Rs 9,500 and Rs 11,500.

 Traders importing wheat to southern ports for consumption mostly in the north will actually end up getting wheat for something like Rs 13,000 a tonne, said Surjit Singh, a commodity market analyst.

 The government wants to keep a gate open to bring in wheat and dampen prices, in case local traders again try to hike rates. Wheat prices have shot up by nearly 40 per cent year-on-year on the back of a poor crop.

 The announcement comes a day before the State Trading Corporation opens tenders for about 17 lakh tonnes of wheat imports. Analysts said the corporation was a little puzzled regarding the time of the declaration.

 The announcement comes after private traders, who have contracted to import about half-a-million tonnes, demanded they be placed on an equal footing with state agencies vis-a-vis import duties.

 State Trading Corporation has till now contracted imports of 3.8 million tonnes of wheat. Pawar himself said the government itself may not need to import any more wheat.

 Now we are encouraging private sector imports. So I dont think any more will be necessary, but we are open and if required, we will import, he said. The countrys wheat output in the last crop was about 69.48 mt against a target of 75.5 mt.

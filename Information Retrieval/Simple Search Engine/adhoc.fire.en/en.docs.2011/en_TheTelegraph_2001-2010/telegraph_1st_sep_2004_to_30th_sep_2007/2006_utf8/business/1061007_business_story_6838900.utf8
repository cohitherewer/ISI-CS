 Grant for Mexico power unit

 Washington, Oct.6 (Reuters): The World Bank granted Mexico $49 million on Thursday for a solar-thermal power plant and bought over $6 million in carbon emission reductions with the Dutch government from six small hydropower projects in India.

 Mexico, the worlds No. 9 greenhouse gas producer, plans to build a solar field tying into a large conventional thermal facility near the US border that should cut 391,270 tonnes of carbon dioxide over the 25-year life of the power plant.

 By developing sources of renewable energy that take advantage of the countrys strategic geographical position, Mexico will benefit both the local economy and the global environment, World Bank project manager Gabriela Azuela said.

 Also its private sector arm, the International Finance Corp, will use Dutch government funds to buy Indian hydro reductions which Amsterdam will then use to buy certified emissions reductions to comply with its Kyoto targets.

 Both initiatives are part of a broader push by the World Bank to spur carbon trading markets and cleaner energy.

 I welcome this agreement, which will open the door for hydropower projects to access the commercial carbon finance market and improve their returns on risk capital, IFC environment director Rachel Kyte said.

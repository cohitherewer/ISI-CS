 Kinetic to issue bonds to Citicorp

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, June 21: Kinetic Motor Company will issue non-convertible and fully convertible debentures and warrants to Citicorp Finance (India) Limited.

 The board has approved the issue of up to 80 lakh 9.5 per cent secured redeemable non-convertible debentures of face value of Rs 100 each and up to 21.5 lakh secured redeemable fully convertible debentures of a face value of Rs 65 each convertible into fully paid-up shares at the end of 12 months from the date of allotment.

 The company has also approved the issue of 15 lakh warrants convertible into equity shares within 18 months from the date of issue.

 These will, however, be subject to shareholders and other necessary approvals.

 The proceeds of the proposed issue will be used to finance the companys capital expenditure and meet its long-term working capital requirements, said Sulajja Firodia Motwani, managing director of Kinetic Motor Company. 

 In the coming months, we plan to introduce a range of Italian scooters and manufacture SYM scooter models with the latest advanced technology, she added.

 Kinetic Motor Company, the scooter manufacturing arm of Kinetic Group, plans to revamp its scooter business. The company has acquired a range of scooter models from Italjet Spa of Italy and is now introducing them in a phased manner.

 Kinetic Motor Company had also entered into an agreement earlier this year with the Taiwanese San Yang Motor Industry Company (SYM) for technical collaboration and manufacturing of SYM models in India. We believe Kinetic Motors with its new range of products is well positioned to address the growing opportunities in the domestic and international scooter markets. The financial instruments have been structured to provide the much-needed capital for growth while maintaining a healthy balance sheet structure, said Varun Batra, director of Citigroup.

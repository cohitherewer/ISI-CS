The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Williamson buy a drag on McLeod 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Khaitan: Trying times

 Calcutta, Jan. 31: McLeod Russel India Ltd slid deeper into the red for the third quarter ended December. It has suffered a net loss of Rs 9.31 crore, higher than the net loss of Rs 7.4 crore posted in the same period last fiscal.

 The loss before tax stood at Rs 9.12 crore for the period under review against Rs 7.4 crore a year ago. Net sales, however, increased to Rs 118.87 crore against Rs 95.16 crore last year.

 Announcing the third-quarter numbers, vice-chairman Deepak Khaitan said the negative result was mainly due to the impact of acquiring Williamson Tea from London-based Magors at a cost of nearly Rs 169 crore.

 The interest pay-out during the quarter was Rs 9.77 crore (Rs 7.24 crore).

 The company has also shown Rs 4.18 crore outgo on account of exchange fluctuations. McLeods average selling price also dropped by Rs 5 from last year.

 Close on the heels of acquiring Williamson Tea, McLeod also bought Doom Dooma Tea Co from Hindustan Lever for nearly Rs 69 crore last month. Following the takeover of Doom Dooma Tea, there will be restructuring of plantations, modernisation of facilities, food and adulteration certification combined with quality improvement provisions to improve exports, Khaitan said.

 The legal formalities regarding the merger with Williamson Tea Assam will be completed by March and the merged entity will come into existence from April.

 The combined production of the three entities will touch 70 million kg by March and the company is targeting 100 million kg in the near future.

 The combined entities will export 20 million kg of tea and Khaitan expects it to go up to 25 million kg to countries like Europe, the US, Australia and Pakistan, which usually imports from Kenya. Kenya is facing a drought.

 The board may consider Doom Dooma merger in the next financial year. 

 Williamson Tea

 Williamson Tea Assam Ltd has recorded a higher profit before tax at Rs 10.18 crore for the quarter ended December compared with Rs 4.19 crore in the year-ago period.

 Gross sales have declined to Rs 64.62 crore (Rs 66.28 crore).

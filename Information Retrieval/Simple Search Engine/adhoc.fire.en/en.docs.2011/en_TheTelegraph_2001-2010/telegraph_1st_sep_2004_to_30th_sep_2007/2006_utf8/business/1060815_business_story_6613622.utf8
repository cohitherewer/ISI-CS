 HSBC to hire more in China

 Bank on me

 Shanghai, Aug. 14 (Reuters): The countrys largest bank, HSBC Holdings, said on Monday that it planned to hire about 2,000 new staff in China by the end of 2007 as it expands its local network. 

 HSBC, which owns nearly 20 per cent of Chinas fifth-largest lender Bank of Communications, recently received approval to open a representative office for private banking services in Shanghai, its country head said. 

 We look forward to the full market opening by the end of this year, and have made further investments in people and the network, HSBCs China chief executive Richard Yorke told a media briefing. 

 Yorke expects HSBC to have over 30 business outlets around China by the end of this year compared to 24 at present. 

 The bank plans to focus on the mainlands four richest cities Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Shanghai and Beijing as its main retail banking markets. 

 HSBC plans to recruit about 1,000 staff in 2006 and the same number in 2007 to boost its total number of staff in local banking operations to 4,400, 95 per cent of them local hires, Yorke said. 

 Last week, HSBC launched products in nine Chinese cities permitting Chinese clients to invest in overseas markets. It obtained a $500 million (265 million) quota to do so under Chinas Qualified Domestic Institutional Investor programme. 

 Yorke said HSBCs private banking representative office would be mainly to study the market and to make preparations, as Beijing has so far not offered foreign banks licences to conduct private banking businesses in China. 

 However, Beijing has pledged to allow foreign players to offer local yuan banking services to individual Chinese customers in December, as part of its commitment to the World Trade Organisation when China joined in 2001. 

 The year 2007 will be an important for our retail banking business, as we will be permitted to expand our renminbi services to domestic individuals, Yorke said. 

 We are paving the way for this to be an important area of HSBCs business in China.

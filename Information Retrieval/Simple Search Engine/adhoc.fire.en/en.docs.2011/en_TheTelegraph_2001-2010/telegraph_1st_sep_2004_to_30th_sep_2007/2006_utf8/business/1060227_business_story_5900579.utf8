 Q amp;A

 Kids stuff

 Under sectin 80C, savings of Rs 1 lakh can be deducted from the taxable income, irrespective of income limits. Does this hold good for childrens tuition fees also? I spend Rs 20,000 on each of my two children. Can I deduct the full amount? 

 Damodar Agarwal, Guwahati 

 Yes, the sub-limit on childrens education fees has been removed under section 80C. Thus you can claim the full amount (up to Rs 1 lakh) as deduction However, it includes only tuition fees for full-time courses at institutions situated within India and does not include any development fee or donations or payments of similar nature. 

 My dear daughter

 I had taken a life insurance policy for my daughter who got married this year. I shall continue to pay the premium on her policy. Shall I be able to claim tax benefits on the same? 

 Jayanta Mitra, Calcutta

 Yes, you will be eligible to claim tax benefits on the premium amount for the life insurance of your married daughter. 

 Recurring problem

 I have been investing Rs 1000 per month in the five-year post office recurring deposit scheme for the last two years. Shall I get income tax deduction for this investment under section 80C for the financial year 2005-06? 

 Dr. Rajkumar Banerjee, Siliguri

 vestment in post office recurring deposit is not eligible for income tax deduction under section 80C.

 Not in the best interest

 I am a retired person. I have opened a joint account with my wife in a post office monthly income scheme with the provident fund amount I had received at the time of retirement. Will the interest amount be included in my taxable income?

 Samir Roy, by e-mail

 vestment in post office monthly income scheme account and interest received therefrom are no longer eligible for any tax benefits. The interest income is now taxable and is added to the total income of an individual for tax calculation.

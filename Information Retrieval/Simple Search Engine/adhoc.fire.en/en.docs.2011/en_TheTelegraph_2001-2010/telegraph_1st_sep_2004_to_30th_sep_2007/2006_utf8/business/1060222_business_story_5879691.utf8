 S amp;N beats Europe blues to post profit

 Froggatt: Tough job

 London, Feb. 21 (Reuters): British brewer Scottish amp; Newcastle reported a 9.5 percent increase in profits on Tuesday amid tough trading in France and said it hoped the 2006 World Cup would boost beer consumption.

 But its shares fell, the third biggest decliner in the FTSE 100 index, after it warned freezing January weather in Russia had hit sales and the outlook for France remained uncertain. Profit before tax rose to ?392 million in 2005 from ?358 million a year earlier, said S amp;N, which tops the French market with Kronenbourg lager, Britain with Fosters and Portugal with Sagres.

 Trading in the first weeks of 2006 has been in line with recent trends, with the exception of Russia, where the unusually cold weather had an adverse impact, S amp;N said in a statement. After the disappointing market dynamics in 2005, we expect to see slight volume growth in 2006, largely due to the football World Cup, it added.

 Difficult markets in mainland Europe contributed to a 4.3 per cent fall in operating profit in 2005. But S amp;N said it hoped to offset this by reorganising its French sales team, selling its Champigneulles brewery and focusing on the launch of Kronenbourg Blanc and Super Chilled lagers.

 Finance director Ian McHoul said beer sales could be boosted in a number of countries by the World Cup.

 Id be misleading you if I said the English performance had nothing to do with it, so well be keeping our fingers crossed, he said. 

 But weve got businesses in other countries that are playing, including Portugal, where Sagres sponsors the national team, he added.

 CEO Tony Froggatt said S amp;N would apply lessons it learned from Irelands smoking ban to its operations in the UK, where smoking will be banned in pubs and bars from mid-2007. Its not going to be easy, he said.

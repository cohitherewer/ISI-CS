 Oil firms brace for crude shock

 S.P.S. PANNU

 New Delhi, Feb. 3: The third quarter of the current financial year was bad for national oil marketing companies. But it seems the fourth quarter will be worse with the average price of the Indian basket of crude imports shooting past $60.5 per barrel in January. The January price is over $5 higher than that in December.

 ?The January surge has brought us down to our knees and unless the government takes drastic steps to redress the situation, the oil marketing companies will turn sick,? A senior Indian Oil official told The Telegraph.

 Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum, Hindustan Petroleum and IBP have suffered a combined loss of Rs 2,898 crore during the April-December period this fiscal and these losses are mounting further. The same companies had clocked a profit of Rs 5,223 crore during the corresponding period of the previous fiscal.

 Upstream oil companies ONGC and OIL and gas firm GAIL have already forked out Rs 9,751 crore as subsidy.

 Soaring international prices of crude and the failure to recover the cost of production from domestic sales of petroleum products have sent the cash-strapped oil marketing companies on a borrowing spree to meet their working capital requirements. The government has added to the liquidity crunch by not issuing the promised oil bonds to these companies. 

 The total borrowings of IOC have shot up to Rs 22,000 crore between April and December. The company had borrowed only Rs 14,000 crore in the whole of last fiscal.

 The average price of crude during the current fiscal works out at $25 per barrel higher than the previous year. However, the domestic prices of petroleum products, especially LPG and kerosene, do not reflect this rise.

 IOC officials said under-recovery for LPG has soared to Rs 200 per cylinder while that for kerosene is hovering at around Rs 13 per litre. The under-recoveries on diesel and petrol were around Rs 1.50 per litre.

 The sharp rise in LPG prices is partly because of the sudden purchases made by Indian companies to tide over the crisis in the winter months caused by unplanned shutdowns of some indigenous refineries.

 The situation on the oil front has become so delicate that any decision to increase prices has to be taken at the level of the Prime Minister.

 During the last round of price hikes in September, while the Prime Minister had convinced the Left parties of the need to increase LPG and kerosene prices, the decision could not be pushed through as Lalu Prasad had put his foot down. For him, the Bihar elections were considered far more important than the bottomlines of oil companies. 

 Such political considerations will continue to dominate the decision-making process. Unless international prices fall to lower levels, the oil companies will continue to face tough times as any increase in the prices of petroleum products can only be modest. 

 The Ranganthan committee has been set up to evolve a pricing system for the petroleum sector and rework the distorted tax structure. However, such a formula can only work if international prices settle down to reasonable levels and the need to increase or decrease prices is limited to a narrow band.

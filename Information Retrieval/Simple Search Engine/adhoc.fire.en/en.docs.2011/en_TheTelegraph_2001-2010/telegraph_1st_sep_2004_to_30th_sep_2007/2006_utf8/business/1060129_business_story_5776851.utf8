 Airport takeoff hinges on Monday meet

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Jan. 28: The empowered group of ministers (GoM), headed by defence minister Pranab Mukherjee, is expected to meet on Monday to push forward the modernisation of Mumbai and Delhi airports.

 The empowered group will also study the legal implications of awarding the contracts for the Rs 5,400-crore project to avoid court cases from competing companies.

 While civil aviation minister Praful Patel has been maintaining that the government has set a January 31 deadline for awarding the contracts, the move has run into stiff resistance from the Left parties and the staff of the Airports Authority of India.

 The governments attempt to open the financial bids yesterday was stalled by strong protests from the agitating AAI staff backed by the Left parties. Before the meeting of the ministers on Monday, Patel is likely to have a discussion with AAI union leaders who have threatened to go on strike if the modernisation work at both the airports are not awarded to AAI and the government goes ahead with the privatisation.

 Civil aviation secretary Ajay Prasad has assured the union leaders that the AAI plan for modernising the airports would also be considered. 

 Patels attempt to push through the privatisation had earlier received a setback after the Sreedharan committee found that the selection criteria had favoured the Reliance consortium, which did not deserve the high marks awarded to it on technical considerations. The expert committee had revised the scores and given the highest marks to GMR-Fraport. 

 The GoM is believed to have decided to broaden the competition by lowering the technical eligibility criteria from the current 80 per cent. Only GMR-Fraport combine had fulfilled the 80 per cent criterion.

 Ahead of Mondays meeting, the committee of secretaries is also understood to have favoured giving one project to GMR-led consortium, after asking it to match the highest financial bid.

 Parliamentarian Dipankar Mukherjee, who is a CPM member, felt that the privatisation of airports would slash AAIs income by half.

 He had, in a letter to prime minister Manmohan Singh, described the bidding process as a game of musical chair of committees to influence the bidding..., ostensibly to stick to a self-imposed deadline of privatisation, throwing canons of all tendering norms to the wind.

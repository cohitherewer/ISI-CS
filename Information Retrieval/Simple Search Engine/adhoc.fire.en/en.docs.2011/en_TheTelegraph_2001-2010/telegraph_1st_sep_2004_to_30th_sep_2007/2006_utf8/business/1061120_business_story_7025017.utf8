 Building that nest egg

 Retirement planning sounds daunting but can be easy, says Srikumar Bondyopadhyay

 Blessings of social security after retirement are confined to just the salaried in India. These are in the form of employees provident fund, pension schemes and gratuity. Provident funds give a politically administered interest rate in the form of assured returns on investments. 

 But if you are not salaried, you will have to make your own post-retirement provisions and without a matching contribution from anyone: employers contribute an amount equivalent to the employees to the provident fund.

 So, while wage-earners can plan their investments with little concern about post-retirement savings, non-salaried people dont have this luxury. Saving for the twilight years should guide their overall financial planning and investments.

 Long horizon

 Retirement planning is a little tricky because the investment horizon is longer compared with financial planning for childrens education or a daughters marriage or building a house. Moreover, the return on investments needs to be high to beat inflation over a long period. A steady return on investment presupposes a well diversified portfolio across low, medium and high-risk assets. 

 A low-risk asset gives a low return and a high-risk one yields a high return. The retirement investment portfolio of a person should have a judicial mix of assets across different risk-return categories. 

 The asset allocation should be monitored and altered depending on the ruling economic situations and age of the investor. The portfolio of a younger person should contain more of high risk-high return assets such as equity. As the investment horizon narrows, more funds should be allocated to low risk-low return assets such as bank deposits. 

 How much do you need?

 Before chalking out an investment plan for retirement, one should have an idea of the amount one would require at the time of retirement so that the annuity or interest income can sustain the present standard of living. While calculating the monthly income one would require post-retirement, one should take into account the fact that many of the current expenditures would not be there, while there would be some additional expenses, such as medical, instead. Once you have arrived at that figure, calculate what would be the future value of that sum at the time of your retirement, factoring in the rate of inflation. Assume you are 30 years old and you want to retire at the age of 60 and post-retirement you would require a monthly expenditure whose present value is Rs 10,000. Considering an annual inflation rate of 5 per cent for 30 years, Rs 10,000 will be equivalent to Rs 43,219. If the rate of inflation is lower at, say, 3 per cent, it is Rs 24,273. 

 If you think the average inflation rate over the next 30 years will be at 3 per cent, to earn a monthly interest income of Rs 24,273 at an interest rate of, say 8 per cent, you need to build a retirement corpus of Rs 36,40,950.

 Simple mathematics

 Now find out how much you can invest every month from now on. Suppose, you save Rs 5,000 a month. Without assuming any annual increment in income, an investment of Rs 5,000 can build a corpus of roughly Rs 40,00,000 if the annual rate of return is 10 per cent over these 30 years.

 A crucial assumption in this calculation is the rate of inflation. If inflation is higher, you will have to build a higher corpus. If your monthly investments are fixed, you will have to earn a higher rate of return on them. 

 When inflation rises, the real return from fixed income assets such as bank deposits, NSC and PPF comes down. Investors should then switch from fixed income assets to equity or commodity. 

 Performance meter

 Over a longer period, equities give better returns than any other asset class. Since late 1973, when the BSE sensex was constructed, the index has given a cumulative annual return of more than 18 per cent. 

 In between fixed income assets (low-risk, low-return) and stocks (high-risk, high-return), there are commodities such as bullion, which are giving an annualised return of over 15 per cent. But the commodities markets in India are not yet mature due to imperfections in the spot markets and back-end logistics. 

 If you are not a savvy investor, you can opt for a mix of fixed income assets bank deposits, NSC, PPF and debt schemes of mutual funds and equity investm ents shares of companies or diversified equity schemes of mutual funds. A return of 12 per cent plus per annum is not difficult.

 Banks breathe easy on stock sojourn rules

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Mumbai, Dec. 15: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) today gave banks more time to comply with its capital market guidelines that were issued last month. With a view to ensuring smooth transition, the revised guidelines will come into effect from April 1, 2007 against the earlier date of January 1.

 Last month, the RBI announced detailed guidelines for banks exposure to capital markets wherein the central bank ruled that it will be linked to their net worth against the earlier procedure of indexing against advances.

 The guidelines, which also cover bank lending to borrowers for subscribing to IPOs, then said the aggregate exposure of a bank to capital markets in all forms (both fund-based and non-fund based) should not exceed 40 per cent of its net worth as on March 31 of the previous year. The RBI had also suggested that loans/advances to any single borrower from the entire banking system for subscribing to IPOs should not exceed Rs 10 lakh.

 However, market circles were worried over the new stipulation which said the cap on IPO loans will apply to the banking system as a whole. Under the earlier rules, each bank could grant IPO finance to an individual of up to Rs 10 lakh. 

 Big-ticket investors were also disappointed as the central bank suggested that the entire banking sector could lend only up to Rs 20 lakh to such borrowers.

 In its revised guidelines, the RBI reiterated that loans to any individual against security of shares, convertible bonds and debentures, units of equity mutual funds and PSU bonds should not exceed Rs 10 lakh for subscribing to IPOs.

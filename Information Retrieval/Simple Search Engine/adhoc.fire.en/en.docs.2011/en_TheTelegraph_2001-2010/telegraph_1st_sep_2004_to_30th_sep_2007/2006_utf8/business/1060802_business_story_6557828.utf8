 Assam oilfield sale part of ONGC asset recast drill

 New Delhi, Aug. 1: ONGC may transfer all its oilfields in Assam to Oil India Ltd as part of a major asset restructuring exercise. The move is expected to benefit both the companies and boost the nations crude output.

 Sources said the government is considering a proposal that would allow ONGC to sell its northeastern fields to OIL at the prevailing market price. ONGCs main oilfields, which include Geleki, Rudrasagar and Lakwa, are located in upper Assam. Besides these three large fields, ONGC owns smaller Borholla and Khoraghat fields. The proposal envisages the sale of all these oilfields to OIL. 

 Since both the companies are owned by the government, the possibility of opposition from political parties is less. 

 OIL has been doing better than ONGC in the Northeast as the company has been much closer in meeting its output targets. OIL, with its headquarters in Duliajan, is seen as having a more Assamese character which enables it to handle operations with relatively greater ease in the prevailing socio-political conditions of the state.

 ONGC used to produce around 3 million tonnes of crude in Assam during the early nineties but the output has fallen to 1.5 million tonnes now. It also produces 470 million standard cubic metres of gas every year.

 While the increasing age of the fields is an important reason for the decline in output, the numerous bandhs and protests in the state have hamstrung the oil giant and prevented it from realising the full potential.

 ONGC is ready with a Rs 3,300-crore war chest to double its crude oil output in Assam during the next three years. However, the law and order situation in the state will determine whether these funds actually flow in.

 According to the restructuring proposal, the sale of oilfields would fetch ONGC a hefty amount and the public sector oil major would channelise the funds it proposes to invest in Assam to other exploration and production operations in the country where it has a stronger presence. Besides, its foreign arm ONGC-Videsh is on the lookout for overseas assets where the funds could be invested. 

 An ONGC director told The Telegraph recently that the oil major was facing pressure from local elements while awarding contracts in Assam. Even if proper equipment or expertise is not available within the state it is difficult to award contracts to outside companies. 

 We cannot proceed with our work plans in such an environment, he had said.

 While ONGC contracts in Gujarat were given on the basis of global tenders, this was not being permitted in Assam. The ONGC management had also taken up the issue with the Assam government.

 Official figures reveal there have been periods when ONGC had been able to achieve only 82 per cent of its targeted output. The company has constantly been citing frequent bandhs and strikes that disrupt production as major factors for this shortfall.

 It is not that OIL has been entirely free of these problems but the ground realities show that it has not been hit as badly as ONGC. 

 Senior ONGC officials have been complaining that the security provided by the Assam government to the oil major is not adequate, particularly in areas adjoining Nagaland and the oilfields in upper Assam.

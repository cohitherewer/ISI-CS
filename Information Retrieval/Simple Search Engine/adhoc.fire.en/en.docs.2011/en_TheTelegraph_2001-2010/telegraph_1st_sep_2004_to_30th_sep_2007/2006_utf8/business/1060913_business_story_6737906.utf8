 Wipro plans training facility in Orissa

 PRABUDDHA S. JAGADEB

 Premji: Glad tidings

 Bhubaneswar, Sept. 12: On his visit to Orissa on September 23, Wipro chairman Azim Premji would not only monitor the progress of his proposed software development units but would also announce the setting up of a national training school for its software managers.

 In 2004, the New York Stock Exchange-listed company had signed an MoU with the state government to set up its software development centre at a proposed investment of about Rs 200 crore. It had been allotted 27 acres of land in Infocity just opposite the Infosys centre.

 The construction of the development centre has already started and is expected to be over by 2008. The centre would have three units with each employing between 1,200 and 1,500 people. Premji would monitor the progress, said Vishal Dev, director of Orissa Computer Application Centre (OCAC), the nodal body supervising investments in IT.

 Dev said Wipro has also shown interest in setting up a national training facility in the state. The facility is supposed to conduct management development programmes for its managers and senior executives of the company. Premji is likely to ask land for the centre at Puri or Bhubaneswar as companies prefer to train their personnel away from metros, he said.

 However, the details will be known only after his visit, he said.

 But before the development centre is built at Infocity, the software firm would get going from a rented premise in the city like TCS, which opened its 265-seater centre last week at the Fortune Towers complex. They have taken up two standard-design factory sheds of 16,000 square feet adjacent to their 27-acre plot on rent from Idco. The centre is expected to be launched soon with around 150 personnel, said A.K. Panda, head of IT promotion cell of OCAC.

 Wipro is among the four major companies Hexaware, Mindtree, Wipro and TCS for whom a 130-acre special economic zone is being carved out of the 350 acre Infocity I, Dev said. The SEZ proposal is now pending with the Centre for approval, but we are positive it will come through, he added.

 Wipros request for a direct flight to Bangalore from Bhubaneswar has not been fulfilled. We have talked to some airlines and hope they will commence a direct flight by next year, said state IT and tourism minister Surya Narayan Patro.

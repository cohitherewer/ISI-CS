 Mumbai, July 3: Welspun India has acquired an 85 per cent stake in Christy, one of UK?s leading home textile brands, for Rs 132.6 crore.

 The latest acquisition underscores the fact that home textiles is now all the rage and Indian players are scrambling to snap up overseas players in an effort to open marketing beachheads abroad.

 The Welspun acquisition follows two similar deals that GHCL signed in the past year.

 The company will have the option to buy the remaining 15 per cent stake in Christy, which will be held by the existing management, from April 1, 2009.

 Rajesh Mandawewala, joint managing director of Welspun, has been appointed as the chairman of Christy by the Welspun board.

 Founded in 1851, Christy is the world?s oldest towel manufacturer with an annual turnover of Rs 300 crore.

 ?The acquisition of Christy is in line with Welspun?s strategy of emerging as one of the largest global home textiles company by 2008 with a strong brand portfolio,? said B.K. Goenka, vice-chairman and managing director, Welspun Group.

 The acquisition will give Welspun access to the UK and the European markets and premium retail stores, including Marks and Spencer, John Lewis, House of Fraser, Selfridges and Debenhams.

 ?We will also be able to leverage Christy?s presence in the premium US retail segment via Bloomingdales,? Goenka said.

 Christy is also available in Lane Crawford in Hong Kong and Karstadt in Germany. The brand has been successfully extended into bed linen and bathrobes and has recently entered into licensing agreements in Australia and the US.

 Welspun currently exports terry towels to stores like JC Penny, Wal-Mart, Kohl?s, Target and Costco.

 Last month, GHCL, the Dalmia-owned textiles and soda ash maker, acquired 100 per cent of Rosebys, a leading retail home textiles chain in the UK, for Rs 180 crore ($40 million). Rosebys has a turnover of around 115 million euros and a strong presence in bedding, curtains and kids garments with over 300 retail outlets across the UK.

 Last year, GHCL had acquired the US-based Dan River Inc, which gave the company access to a large sales and distribution network within the US catering to large retailers like Linens ?n Things and Bed Bath amp; Beyond.

 According to KSA Technopak, with manufacturing facilities closing down in the West, international retailers are stepping up their sourcing of home textiles from countries such as China and India.

 The retailing consultancy expects India?s home textile exports to grow from the current $1.2 billion to $5 billion by 2010.

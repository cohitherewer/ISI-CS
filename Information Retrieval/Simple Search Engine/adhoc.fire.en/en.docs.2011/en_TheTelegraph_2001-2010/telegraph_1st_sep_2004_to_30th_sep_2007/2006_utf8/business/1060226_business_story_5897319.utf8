 We are witnessing a record growth in the number of telephone subscribers in the last few months and this needs to be continuously fuelled. Public sector companies, BSNL and Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd (MTNL), are extremely aggressive.

 Of the 60 million lines, 30 per cent order (18 million lines) will go to another public sector equipment supplier ITI, which has a technical tie-up with French equipment manufacturer Alcatel under reserve quota.

 Complementing the two PSUs for announcing IndiaOne tariff plan, which enables subscribers to make domestic long distance call (STD) throughout the country for Re 1 a minute, the minister said, Wait for March 1, more than 90 per cent of the telecom operators or may be all of them, will join the bandwagon and announce similar tariff plans.

 The minister added that IndiaOne was just a beginning and there was lot more competition to come in the telecom sector in the next few months.

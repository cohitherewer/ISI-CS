 Calcutta, Oct. 20: United Bank of India today reported a 56.14 per cent increase in net profit to Rs 162.08 crore for the first six months of this fiscal against Rs 103.8 crore during April-September in 2005-06.

 On a like-to-like basis, the banks net profit for the three months ended September 30 jumped 130 per cent to Rs 91.73 crore from Rs 70.35 crore in the same period last year.

 However, the gross profit of the public sector bank for the April-September period this year declined 16 per cent to Rs 301.24 crore from Rs 358.72 crore a year ago. 

 This is primarily because we suffered a loss in treasury income during the reporting period, said P.K. Gupta, chairman cum managing director of United Bank.

 The bank sold some of its investments in government securities at a loss to avoid interest rate risks of being locked in a loss-making investment. However, the loss was only Rs 2.49 crore. 

 This was in addition to a provisioning of Rs 53 crore, which is, however, lower than the Rs 83 crore provided during the first six months of 2005-06 for notional investment loss.

 We had, in fact, sold our loss making investments and allocated the funds to lending, which earned a higher return, Gupta said. 

 The banks yield on advances improved to 8.68 per cent as in September this year from 8.06 per cent in March following the hardening of interest rates in the past few months. However, the banks cost of deposits also increased to 4.94 per cent from 4.89 per cent during the same period, resulting in a net interest margin of 3.74 per cent.

 The city-based bank has been able to improve its operational efficiency quite significantly and this is reflected in the banks return on assets (RoA) a measure for how effectively the assets of the banks business are working. 

 Our RoA, as on September 30, stands at 0.92 per cent compared with 0.62 per cent on March 31, Gupta said. 

 The average RoA of all banks in the country taken together is 1 per cent, while that for nationalised banks is 0.88 per cent. 

 The bank has also been able to reduce its gross and net non-performing assets to 4.37 per cent and 1.83 per cent respectively riding on a high credit-deposit ratio, which stood at 61.6 per cent as on September 30 compared with 51.8 per cent as on March 31.

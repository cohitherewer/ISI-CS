 Yangon talks tough on gas

 S.P.S. PANNU

 New Delhi, Oct. 18: The Myanmar government has informed GAIL (India) Ltd that it wants to sell the 5 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of gas from its offshore A1 block to a single buyer. Myanmar does not want the stakeholders in the field to take their share of the profit in kind.

 The Yangon authorities have found the earlier bids put in both by GAIL and China to be too low and has refused to accept them.

 Sources said while the GAIL bid was higher than Chinas, it did not satisfy the Myanmar authorities as they wanted a higher price for the gas. Thailand has also shown an interest in buying the gas but the price is the key issue.

 Some hard bargaining appears to be on the cards before a deal is clinched.

 However, with Myanmar deciding to sell the entire 5 tcf of gas as a single parcel, its evacuation through the shipping route can be ruled out as the quantity is too large.

 Evacuating the gas through an inter-country pipeline is the only way out. According to industry sources, buyers want to factor in the high cost of the pipeline while the Myanmar authorities are not making adequate allowances for this fact.

 India has submitted a detailed feasibility report (DFR) to the Myanmar government to lay a gas pipeline from the Sitwe port in the Southeast Asian country directly through Aizwal in Mizoram and bypassing Bangladesh.

 The proposed pipeline would then go on to Silchar and Guwahati in Assam, before turning west towards Siliguri in North Bengal and finally link up with the Haldia-Jagdishpur oil pipeline at Gaya.

 Officials said there would be two tap-off points for the proposed pipeline. The first would be in Tripura, 260 km from the border, and the second in Assam, 650 km from the border.

 While Myanmar was initially in talks only with India to export the gas through a pipeline, it had later signed an MoU with Chinese company PetroChina as well to sell the gas.

 With China entering the picture, Myanmar has strengthened its bargaining power vis-a-vis India. Myanmar has indicated that it has enough gas for both India and China as the adjoining A3 block also has huge reserves.

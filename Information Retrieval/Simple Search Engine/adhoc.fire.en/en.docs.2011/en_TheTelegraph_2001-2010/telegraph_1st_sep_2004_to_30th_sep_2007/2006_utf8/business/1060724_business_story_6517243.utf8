 Depression urge strong on bourses

 Close vigil

 There is a complete lack of conviction in the markets. That?s the message coming out strong and clear not only from the low volumes, lack of breadth and the huge volatility in the Indian market but also from the latest global survey of fund managers by Merrill Lynch. A net 60 per cent of those surveyed in July said the world economy would grow weaker over the next 12 months, compared with just 5 per cent, who were bearish three months ago. Surprisingly, this level of pessimism was last seen in the aftermath of 9/11.

 What does the survey say for emerging markets? A net 27 per cent of those surveyed said they are now taking ?lower than normal? risks, up from 3 per cent in April. Clearly, risk aversion has risen sharply, which is negative for emerging markets.

 On the credit side, only 21 per cent believe that world stock markets will be lower in six months and a net 17 per cent believe world markets are overvalued. Among Asia-Pacific fund managers, to the question ?Thinking about country rotations in the next 12 months, which equity market would you overweight and which would you underweight?? 11 per cent said they would underweight India. But that?s a big improvement from the 32 per cent who said they would underweight India in June, and it?s better than the 15 per cent in April, before the market fell. That indicates the support coming in for the Indian market at lower levels.

 The overall message coming out of the survey, however, is pessimistic. Contrarians will say that?s a very good sign. For the shorter-term, the high level of cash that fund managers are sitting on is a sign of comfort. Not only will it cushion the downside but, given some optimistic news, such as a cease-fire in Lebanon, it is likely to lead to a rally. Indian mutual funds too are sitting on large amounts of cash.

 Oil prices amp; interest rates

 With Nymex crude prices going well above $70 a barrel, thanks to the tension in West Asia, the spotlight is on how much rising oil prices will impact the economy and the rupee. ABN Amro?s Singapore team has brought out a report analysing which countries in Asia will be the most affected. According to the study, oil imports now account for 31.3 per cent of total Indian imports. It says Korea and India are the most vulnerable to high oil prices with India being in a worse position it has a current account deficit and it imports oil for domestic consumption unlike Korea, which can pass it on to those who buy its exports.

 The consequence: higher inflation and higher interest rates. The report says, ?For those countries with high subsidies (India and Malaysia), the need for further rate hikes would be greater and would extend into 2007.?

 The Reserve Bank of India needs to take note of these perceptions about potential inflation, rather than listen to the finance minister?s soothing utterances about inflation, delivered on the eve of every credit policy statement. On July 25, when the RBI reviews the credit policy, it should meet the market?s expectations of a further hike in interest rates. If they don?t do that, the RBI will be seen to be behind the curve when it comes to fighting inflation and the downward pressure on the rupee will increase.

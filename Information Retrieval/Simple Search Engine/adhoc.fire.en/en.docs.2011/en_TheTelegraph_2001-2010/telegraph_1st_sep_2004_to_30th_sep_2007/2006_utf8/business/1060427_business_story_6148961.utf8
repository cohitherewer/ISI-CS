 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hyderabad, April 26: GMR Industries Ltd, the flagship company of the GMR group, has reported an 85 per cent rise in net profit at Rs 34.52 crore for fiscal 2005-06.

 GMR Industries managing director K. Narayana Rao said the company phased out its trading activities during the year resulting in a decrease in turnover from Rs 310 crore during 2004-05 to Rs 268 crore last year.

 GMR Industries has declared a dividend of 25 per cent for last fiscal.

 The manufacturing unit of the group has interests in sugar, co-generation, distillery and ferro-alloys.

 Our products in sugar, ethanol and rectified spirits are largely sold in Bengal and Orissa, Rao said.

 The company plans to invest Rs 263 crore on expansion projects, which include increasing the sugar cane crushing capacity to 5000 TCD and co-generation of power at 24 mw, he added. 

 It will also set up a distillery with 45-kl capacity in Karnataka.

 Apart from these, the company proposes to set up an integrated dairy unit, a bio-diesel and wet maize processing unit, the managing director added.

 Essel profit down

 Essel Propack, a speciality packaging company, has posted a profit after tax (PAT) of Rs 18.70 crore in the first quarter of 2006, down 4.5 per cent over last years figures.

 The net global sales in the quarter, however, rose to Rs 212.1 crore from Rs 190.5 crore in the same period in 2005.

 The seasonal and cyclical swing in volumes and revenue has been anticipated, Essel vice-chairman and managing director Ashok Goel said.

 Revenues in 2006 are expected to grow at 15-18 per cent along with PAT on similar lines.

 Juggling options on kiddy plans

 Buying cover for your child? Srikumar Bondyopadhyay has a better option

Has your insurance agent convinced you to go for that life insurance policy for your kid even when you have got enough for yourself? If you have bought his spiel, you can?t be blamed. After all, securing the children?s future is on top of every parent?s mind. Insurance agents often play on this emotional chord when they want to sell policies either to fulfil their sales target or to increase their commission income.

 But parents, beware! Neither insurance agents nor insurance companies will tell you a few things about children?s life insurance plans.

 There are two types of plans for children: One, where a parent is the proposer of the insurance plan and the child is the beneficiary. This is the most common type and, in such plans, the life of the parent (who is the proposer of the plan) is insured and the benefits accruing in the plan, such as money back, bonus, sum assured and loyalty addition, are given to the child.

 The second type of plan is where the life of the child is insured, but not the parents. These are called juvenile policies. Insurers sell both types under the ?children?s life insurance? tag.

Why children?s plan?

 Generally, the minimum age at which one can buy a life insurance policy is 18 years, that is, when one attains adulthood. However, some life insurers such as the Life Insurance Corporation and Max New York Life have policies where the entry age is 12 years.

 It is believed that life insurance per se (financial cover against death) is not needed for people below this age. ?Parents really do not need the insurance money if their two-year-old child dies. But a child needs money when the breadwinner of the family dies,? said Ashok Shah, LIC zonal manager.

 True. Which is why the first type of insurance plan, where one of the parents is the proposer, has become more popular than juvenile plans. But these are no different from any other money-back or endowment plans for adults with the child as the nominee.

Illusory cover

 When you buy children?s life insurance of the first type, you essentially buy a cover for yourself with the child as nominee.

 You can, of course, buy a juvenile policy for your prince or princess. Insurers are selling their juvenile products with a minimum entry age of 30 days. But, in such a policy the ?risk cover usually commences from the second policy anniversary or on attaining seven years of age, whichever is later.? This means the life of your kid is not insured till he or she turns seven.

 The child mortality rate in the country is much higher than that of adults. While the child mortality rate in India has for the first time fallen below 60 per 1,000 lives (it is 58 at present), the adult mortality rate stands between 10 and 12 per 1,000. Juvenile life insurance plans would be a loss-making proposition for insurers if they had to provide life risk from the time a policy commenced. 

Better alternative

 A child?s future could be better secured by investing the money elsewhere. Consider, for example, LIC?s CDA Endowment 18, a children?s money-back policy. 

 The child starts getting part of the sum when it attains the age of 18. Under this plan, the annual premium for a two-year-old child is Rs 10,064 on a sum assured of Rs 5 lakh and a policy term of 30 years. The premium is Rs 38,332 under the corporation?s most popular children?s endowment plan, Komal Jeevan. 

 However, here the policy term is 17 years. While the life risk cover under the CDA 18 commences after the child turns 18, under the Komal Jeevan policy, it starts when the child is seven.

 Now, consider this. Instead of buying a CDA 18 plan, you invest Rs 10,064 every year in a public provident fund for 15 years. Guess how much will you accumulate in the PPF account (that gives an 8 per cent rate of interest cumulative annually) when your child becomes 17 years ? it?s Rs 3,83,974.50. 

 Gift this money to your child and deposit it in a post office monthly savings scheme. The annual interest income will be Rs 30,717.96.

 With the interest income you can buy an endowment assurance or any other policy from LIC for your child, who is now 17 years old. The annual premium for a Rs 5-lakh sum assured for a 25-year policy term is Rs 18,682 under the endowment assurance plan. 

 The remaining (Rs 30,717.96 ? Rs 18,682 =) Rs 12,035.96 you can spend every year on your child?s education or save it for his or her marriage. 

 You had spent Rs 1,50,960 (= Rs 10,064 x 15), accumulated a corpus of Rs 3.84 lakh and got a life coverage of Rs 5 lakh for free ? the insurance premium is funded from the interest income.

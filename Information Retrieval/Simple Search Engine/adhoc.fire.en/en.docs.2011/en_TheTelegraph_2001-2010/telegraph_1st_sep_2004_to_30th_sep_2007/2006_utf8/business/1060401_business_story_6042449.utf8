 New Delhi, March 31: A consortium, comprising GAIL, Videocon, Hindustan Petroleum, Bharat Petroleum and Oilex of Australia, has been awarded an onshore oil and gas exploration block in Oman.

 GAIL, Oilex and Videocon each has a 25 per cent participating interest in the consortium, while BPCL and HPCL together have the remaining 25 per cent. Oilex will carry out the drilling required for oil and gas. Block number 56, which has been awarded to the consortium, is located in the South Oman salt basin area and covers an area of 5,809 sq km.

 The development comes close on the heels of the Myanmar government approving an agreement signed between Daewoo International Corporation and GAIL, under which the gas major will hold a 10 per cent stake in the countrys A-3 block. The block was awarded to Daewoo of Korea in 2004.

 Drilling of the first exploratory well in block A-3 has been completed recently, resulting in a gas discovery. Appraisal of the discovered prospect and more exploratory drilling in the block will be done by the year-end.

 The A-3 block, measuring 6,780 sq km, is situated adjacent to the A-1 block where commercial gas discoveries have already been made.

 GAIL is a consortium partner with a 10 per cent stake in A-1 block as well and, together with ONGC, has a 30 per cent participating interest. GAIL is also the preferred buyer for the gas produced from the A-1 block. The company has been given a similar status in the A-3 block deal as well. 

 GAIL now holds a participating interest in 16 exploration blocks at home and abroad. Of these, seven are on-land blocks and nine are offshore. Its different consortium partners in the 16 blocks include ONGC, GSPC, Gazprom, OIL, IOC, Hardy Exploration amp; Production, ENI, Daewoo and Korea Gas. GAILs participating interests in these blocks vary between 10 per cent and 80 per cent.

 Nelp roadshow

 The country stepped up its efforts to get top US energy firms to join the domestic oil and gas hunt after petroleum minister Murli Deora promised a level-playing field in the latest tender for 55 exploration blocks.

 Kicking-off the roadshow to attract 

 bids for the latest offering under the sixth round of the 

 New Exploration Licensing Policy in Houston, Deora said 

 despite the 30 finds, which established more than four billion 

 barrels of oil and oil equivalent gas reserves, India remained 

 poorly explored.

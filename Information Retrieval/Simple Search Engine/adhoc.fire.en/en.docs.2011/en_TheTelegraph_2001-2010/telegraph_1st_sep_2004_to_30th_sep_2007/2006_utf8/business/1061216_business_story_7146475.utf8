 Calcutta, Dec. 15: Small and medium enterprises (SMEs), which form the backbone of the German economy, are keen on forging closer ties with their counterparts in India. 

 A 300-strong delegation from German SMEs will be in India in March to strengthen relationships. 

 The delegation will split on the lines of the industry they represent and hold the meetings in India. The city is also in their itinerary.

 At an interactive session of the Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry here today, German ambassador to India Bernd Mtzelburg said that only two-three delegations of the 12 from his country that were in India last month, including some from the SME sector, had come to the state. He said more awareness among German companies needs to be taken by the state to attract investments, adding that the team coming in March will have representatives of SMEs in manufacturing, textiles, automobile, food processing and pharmaceutical sectors.

 Mtzelburg said there were 106 German companies in Pune but less than half that number in the city which is located strategically and holds the edge in manpower. 

 During the first seven months of the current financial year (April-October 2006), trade between India and Germany registered an all-time high growth of over 35 per cent compared with the same period of last year. Exports from India rose 32 per cent, while German imports increased 40 per cent.

 Trade between the two countries in 2005-06 crossed Euro 7.5 billion, registering an increase of 22 per cent over the previous year, according to statistics of the ministry of commerce and industry.

 Aloke Mookherjea, president, Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said a recent joint committee report had shown that 80 per cent of German companies were aware about India, 30 per cent were planning to come to India and 65 per cent already had some kind of presence in the country.

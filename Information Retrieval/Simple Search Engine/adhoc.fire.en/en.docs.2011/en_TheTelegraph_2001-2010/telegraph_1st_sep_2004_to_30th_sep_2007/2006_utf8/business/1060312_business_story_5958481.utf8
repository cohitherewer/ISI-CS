 Nath talks tough at trade meet

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Nath: Aggressive

 New Delhi, March 11: Commerce minister Kamal Nath told the developed countries today at the G-6 meeting that we might as well wind up the talks and go home if the concerns of developing countries in the area of market access under the WTO negotiations are not met. 

 The G-6 meeting at London is being attended by the European Union (EU), the United States, Brazil, India, Japan and Australia to discuss issues relating to the ongoing Doha round of multilateral trade negotiations under the World Trade Organisation.

 According to an official statement issued by the commerce ministry, the minister turned the tables on the developed countries through a fresh interpretation of para 24 of the Hong Kong ministerial declaration. 

 He strongly underlined the need for a special and differential treatment for developing countries by insisting that the level of ambition in the negotiations should first be done in percentage terms rather than in terms of coefficients. 

 According to reports reaching here from London, the talks are at a standstill and expectations for a solution by April 30 are dim.

 Developed countries were caught unawares by Indias insistence on describing ambitions in percentage terms and not in terms of coefficients. 

 The commerce minister is reported to have said, the developed countries should first declare their level of ambition in agriculture, and whatever they were willing to do, developing countries would do two-thirds of that. Whatever developed countries were willing to do in agriculture, developing countries could be willing to match in non-agricultural market access (NAMA), but here also developed countries must do at least 10 per cent more. 

 Nath pointed out that while the European Union and the US were unwilling to move in agricultural market access and the heavy farm subsidies, both have been pressurising countries such as India and Brazil to provide more market access in the industrial sector through coefficients for tariff cuts. 

 At the time of the Hong Kong ministerial, the linkage between agriculture and NAMA was established in para 24 of the ministerial declaration and this is being seen in some quarters as detrimental to developing countries. 

 But now at the G-6 meeting, India has used the same clause to the advantage of the developing countries. India has put them on the mat by saying that developing countries are willing to match in NAMA what developed countries do in agriculture, the commerce ministry said.

 Engineering in growth groove

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, July 30: Higher growth rate in major sectors including coal, electric, oil amp; gas, crude oil, steel and aluminium in the current financial year is expected to translate into improved performance for a range of industries in the engineering, non-engineering and services sectors. 

 Industry chamber Ficci projects higher growth rate in these sectors compared with last fiscal.

 However, the survey highlights some key issues, specific to each sector, which need to be addressed by the government in order to attain the projected growth rates or higher.

 Some of these issues relate to inverted duty structure, anomalous import tariff, rising prices of basic raw materials with inadequate availability. Inadequate power and power cuts, poor quality of coal and unstable supply are major hurdles for user industries in the core sector.

 The survey stresses on a need for pro-active government action for helping the industry to achieve lower cost, improved quality and better performance in the competitive environment.

 The study also points out that some of the issues and constraints relate to slow pace of implementation or non-implementation of sectoral packages for a number of items. 

 The survey emphasises on the need to improve the financial health of the state electricity boards (SEBs) and for increased investment and higher allocation and other measures for improving infrastructure facilities. 

 The core sector survey reveals that the coal sector is likely to grow between 6.5-7 per cent in April-March 2006-07 compared with a growth of 6.4 per cent during the corresponding period of the previous year.

 Chevron eyes Russia projectbig plans

 Big Plans 

 Moscow, March 1 (Reuters): Chevron is hoping to win as much as a quarter of Russias huge Shtokman gas project when Gazprom picks partners in April, the US oil majors head in Russia said on Wednesday. Chevron is one of five firms shortlisted by Gazprom for the project, which involves developing the Shtokman gas field in the remote and iceberg-strewn Barents Sea to produce liquefied natural gas (LNG) for sale to the US market.

 Each contender hopes to take part ownership of the vast field, which contains around 3.5 trillion cubic meters of gas.

 We dont expect more than 25 per cent, Trem Smith, president of Chevron Neftegaz Inc, told reporters on the margins of a business conference in Moscow.

 We would like as much as possible.

 He declined to discuss what Chevron was offering Gazprom in return for a share, but said its experience in offshore projects and LNG made it a strong contender, as did Gazproms plan to sell Shtokman LNG in North America, Chevrons home market.

 Gazprom has said it will pick two or three partners from the shortlist, which also includes French oil major Total, Norways Statoil and Hydro and US ConocoPhillips.

 Russias Kommersant newspaper said last week that Gazprom plans to sell two stakes of 24.5 per cent each, while retaining a controlling 51 per cent stake. It said all the contenders could participate if they clubbed together into two consortiums.

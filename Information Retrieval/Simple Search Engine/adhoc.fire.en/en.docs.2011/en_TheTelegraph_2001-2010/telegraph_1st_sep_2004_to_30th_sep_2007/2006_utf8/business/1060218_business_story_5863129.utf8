 Caution flickers on Dell screen

 DAMON DARLIN

 Rollins: Looking forward

 New York, Feb. 17: Dell has reported revenue growth of 13 per cent in the fourth quarter, but analysts warned that it was not performing like in the past. 

 Dell, based in Round Rock, Texas, reported profit of $1.01 billion, or 43 cents a share, a 51 per cent increase over its $667 million, or 26 cents a share, a year earlier. 

 Revenue in the period, which ended February 3, increased to $15.2 billion from $13.5 billion. However, the double-digit growth rate does not portend a return to high growth for the company, the worlds largest seller of PCs. This years quarter had one extra week, which Dell said added about $400 million, or 2 percentage points to 3 percentage points of revenue growth. The extra week gave us a little bit of a pop, chief executive Kevin B. Rollins said. 

 He also said he still expected revenue in the current quarter of $14.2 billion to $14.6 billion, an increase of 6 per cent to 9 per cent from the previous year. The conservative forecast for revenue growth dimmed analysts enthusiasm. It was really a mixed bag, said William Shope, an analyst with JP Morgan. Impressive revenue growth came with a degradation of margins. Dells gross profit margin was 17.8 per cent, the lowest since 2002, said Shope. 

 The slowing growth and deteriorating margins could mean that 2006 will be a more challenging year than 2005 was, said Brent Bracelin, an analyst with Pacific Crest Securities in Portland, Ore. 

 Despite the slower revenue growth projections, the company predicts strong profit growth. Dell said it expected net income per share of 39 cents to 41 cents in its fiscal first quarter, up from 27 cents a year earlier. We dont see an economic slowdown, Rollins said. 

 Rollins pointed to the companys growth in shipments of notebook computers, up 47 per cent worldwide. 

 We grew faster than the market and we took share, he said. Growth in the PC business grew in all areas of the world; Asia Pacific stood out with 21 percent growth. 

 Rollins said the companys success in China, where it sells computers in 2,000 cities, is proof that the direct-sales model works well overseas. It expects the same result in India, where it plans to begin manufacturing and add sales employees. 

 Rollins said he also expected that the introduction of Microsofts new operating system, Vista, later this year would be a quot;very powerful catalyst quot; for sales of new computers as consumers and businesses upgrade. But it may not affect business customers until 2007, analysts said, as companies wait for Microsoft to work all the bugs out of the software. 

 Several analysts said the companys printer business was a disappointment despite a 17 per cent growth in revenue because they suspect that shipments did not grow significantly. quot;Dells grand ambition in printing has been ratcheted back, quot; said Shope. 

 Rollins told analysts that he expected the company would cut the prices of some of its printers and spend more on marketing to fight rivals. He also said it was focused on selling its more profitable laser printers. 

 The earnings report, made after the markets closed, was 2 cents a share better than analysts had predicted. Nevertheless, in after-hours trading, Dells stock declined 25 cents to $31.71 a share. 

 The company, with $11.7 billion in cash, said it planned to buy back $1.2 billion of its stock this quarter. It spent $2 billion to buy back shares in the fourth quarter and spent a total of $7.2 billion in fiscal 2005 buying back shares.

 Mid-sized firms find India best

 London, Jan. 6 (Reuters): India topped a global survey of business confidence among mid-sized companies leaving the United States and Britain languishing, according to a survey by the accounting firm, Grant Thornton.

 The company said on Friday that the findings supported the view that the centre of global economic power may be shifting, with Indias fellow emerging economic heavyweight China coming in fourth.

 Business confidence in previous high-flyers Britain and the United States dropped particularly sharply in the survey of over 7,000 business chiefs across 30 countries.

 India boasted 93 per cent of respondents who were positive about 2006 prospects, compared to 88 per cent last year.

 The economy continues to be extremely buoyant, the stock market is breaking all time highs on a weekly basis, foreign direct investment has increased substantially, said Vishesh Chandiok, Grant Thorntons director of international business, India.

 The growing reliance on the private sector and trade liberalisation ? just like in China ? is proving fruitful here for medium-sized enterprises who are taking full advantage, he said.

 Britain has been one of Europes strongest economies over the recent years but finance minister Gordon Brown last month halved his 2005 growth forecast to 1.75 per cent.

 The Grant Thornton survey showed the UK business confidence at its lowest in four years.

 Business confidence in UK is dramatically down, said Graeme Forbes, a partner at Grant Thornton, UK, who cited problems of high fuel and travel costs, combined with profit squeezes because of high consumer debt.

 Its all going the wrong way ... margins are being reduced and overheads going up in a squeezing effect. Thats true in a lot of sectors at the moment.

 The drop in confidence in Britain was mirrored by a slide in the United States.

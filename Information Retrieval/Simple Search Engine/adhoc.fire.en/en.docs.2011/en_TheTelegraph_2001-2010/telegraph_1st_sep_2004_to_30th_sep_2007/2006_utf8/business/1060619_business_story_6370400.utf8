 Royalty fire at CDMA don

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 18: Telecom operators providing CDMA services are keeping their fingers crossed on a possible royalty cut announcement by Qualcomm Inc chief executive Paul Jacob during his visit here this week.

 The industry has to discover new price points and cost structure to achieve targets, a source said. Players using the code division multiple access (CDMA) technology are likely to raise concerns over the high royalty charges during Jacobs visit.

 Sources said while the royalty issue was not on the Qualcomm chiefs agenda earlier, it acquired priority following reports of Reliance expanding to the GSM arena. Reliance is the biggest CDMA service provider in the country.

 Jacob is coming to announce the setting up of a development centre in Chennai.

 Senior officials of Qualcomm, the US-based CDMA mobile chipmaker, have been quoted as saying that the royalty fee structure has been wrongly written about in the press.

 Service providers do not pay the royalty. The CDMA handset manufacturers, who are licensees of Qualcomm in India, pay the amount, said a Qualcomm official.

 CDMA players, however, said, We are only asking for a fair and equal treatment. In any case, the royalty fee gets padded in the handset cost.

 An industry source said, Of course, one has to pay for the technology we use, but it has to be rational. While Qualcomm charges 7 per cent as royalty on each handset in India, it takes 2 per cent in China and 3 per cent in Korea.

 Government officials said the Qualcomm chief may not be able to meet IT and communications minister Dayanidhi Maran, who is abroad, to present the companys case.

 Qualcomm has not sought an appointment with department of telecommunications officials to discuss the issue, sources said.

 While officials said Reliance had no plans to completely switch over to the GSM technology at the moment, the royalty issue is believed to be one of the main reasons for the company planning to offer GSM services in Delhi and Mumbai.

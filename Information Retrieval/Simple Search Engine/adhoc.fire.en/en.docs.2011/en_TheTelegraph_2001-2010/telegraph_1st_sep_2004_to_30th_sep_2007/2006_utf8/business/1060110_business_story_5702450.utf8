 Price knock for Maruti buyers

 New Delhi, Jan. 9: Maruti Udyog today raised prices by Rs 1,500 to Rs 15,000 on all models in a decision effective from today.

 The country?s biggest carmaker, which had announced its last hike in October, attributed the new round of increases to rising oil prices and higher input costs.

 Maruti 800 and the popular Alto will be costlier by Rs 3,000, Swift?s base models will cost Rs 3,500 more, while the mid and top-end variants will be dearer by Rs 10,000. The prices of Zen and WagonR have been raised by Rs 5,000. Grand Vitara, Maruti?s sports-utility vehicle, will become expensive by Rs 15,000.

 Mid-size Baleno and Esteem will be costlier by Rs 3,000, while multi-purpose vehicle Versa will see a price-rise of Rs 12,000. The Omni van will be dearer by Rs 1,500, while its LPG variant will be expensive by more than Rs 3,000.

 ?The price increase was due to a rise in input and freight costs, which went up following the rise in crude rates,? the company said in a statement.

 Maruti had passed on only a part of the freight and other input costs to customers in the October price revision. It had provided indications about another increase in early 2006.

 The government is planning to mop up around Rs 1,432 crore by selling its residual 8 per cent stake in Maruti.

 An empowered group of ministers recently fixed Rs 620 as the floor-price for the stake-sale.

 The last date is January 11 for submission of bids, which will be opened a day later. The sale is open only to state-owned financial institutions. Close to 36 contenders are in the fray.

 The shares have a lock-in period of six months and the minimum bid size has been kept at Rs 10 crore.

 However, the government has reserved the right not to sell the entire slice of equity in the carmaker if it does not approve the would-be buyers.

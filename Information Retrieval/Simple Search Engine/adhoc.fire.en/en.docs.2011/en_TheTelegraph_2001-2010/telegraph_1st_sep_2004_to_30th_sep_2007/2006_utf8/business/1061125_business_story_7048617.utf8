 Rival bid before Dec 4

 London, Nov. 24 (Agencies): Companhia Siderurgica Nacional (CSN) of Brazil wants to make a rival bid for Corus before the Anglo-Dutch groups shareholders meet on December 4 to consider an offer from Tata Steel, a report said.

 CSN announced on November 11 that it had made an informal bid approach to Corus, setting the stage for a bidding war and throwing Tata Steels agreed takeover into jeopardy.

 CSNs offer of 475 pence per share for Corus topped Tatas bid of 455 pence, which would value the firm at 5.3 billion, including debt.

 Benjamin Steinbruch, chairman, chief executive and 45-per cent owner of CSN, told Financial Times that Corus was being fair and professional as a special team from the Brazilian firm met in London to study its accounts.

 We are confident that we will be able to move to a formal bid, Steinbruch was quoted as saying.

 Depending on the quality of the information, discussions will be finalised at the end of this week. We would like to be prepared before the Corus EGM, he said.

 The extraordinary general meeting with shareholders is set for December 4.

 More shares

 Corus Group Plc will list 46.8 million additional equity shares on the London Stock Exchange.

 The Anglo-Dutch steel firm has applied to the UK Listing Authority and the London Stock Exchange for a block listing, totalling 46,871,000 ordinary shares of 50 pence each to trade on LSE, according to information available on Coruss website.

 The block listing consists of shares to be issued on conversion of 3 per cent guaranteed unsubordinated bonds due in 2007, it said.

 However, this additional share issue would not have any implication on the proposed takeover of the company, as this was taken into account by Tata Steel.

 Shares of the company were trading at 505 pence, down 1 per cent, on the London Stock Exchange today. 

 In June, there were some 891,787,432 Corus shares in issue, which are traded on the London and Amsterdam stock exchanges.

 Corus has around 1,58,000 registered shareholders and institutional investors, who account for around 90 per cent of total shareholders, while remaining 10 per cent mainly represents private individual investors.

 Govt against NPA law tweak

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 6: The Centre is not in favour of making any major changes in laws dealing with non-performing assets in public sector banks and financial institutions as it could result in borrowers switching over to private sector and foreign banks.

 The finance ministry, which was directed by the apex court to consider some suggestions by NGO Common Cause, has rejected most of them saying management of non-performing assets is too complex to have simplistic solutions.

 Moreover, the solutions were neither in accord with best international practices nor were relevant in the present banking scenario in India.

 The NGO had suggested that it should be made mandatory for banks to seek personal guarantee of the promoter of the borrowing company. 

 Rejecting the proposal, the ministry said in its affidavit before the court, Such a guarantee would act as a dampener to the borrowing company and may result in some of them shifting their accounts from public sector banks to private and foreign banks.

 On disclosure of details of proceedings pertaining to defaulters, the affidavit said the ministry, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and public sector banks felt that implementation of the suggestion could reduce competitiveness of the public sector banks. 

 The NGO had filed a PIL seeking binding guidelines to check NPAs.

 Representatives from the ministry, RBI and public sector banks, who held a meeting with the NGO, also rejected the suggestion that the list on the Credit and Information Bureau website should contain the names of not only the defaulters against whom civil suits had been filed but also that of all wilful defaulters. 

 The affidavit said the RBI Act, which allowed collection of credit information on borrowers, prohibited publication of the information collected by the RBI from various banks and financial institutions. 

 However, there was no prohibition on publication of names of borrowers against whom recovery suits had been filed. 

 The suggestion for enlarging the definition of a wilful defaulter in the RBI guidelines was, however, accepted by the group. 

 It agreed to incorporate a clause to include a defaulting unit, which disposes of moveable or immovable pledged for securing a loan, in the list of wilful defaulters, who are not entitled to several facilities given by financial institutions.

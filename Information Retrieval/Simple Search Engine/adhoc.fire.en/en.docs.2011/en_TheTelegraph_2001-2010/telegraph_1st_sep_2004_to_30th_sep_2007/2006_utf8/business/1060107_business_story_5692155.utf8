 AT amp;T mulls EchoStar acquisition

 AT your service

 Philadelphia, Jan. 6 (Reuters): AT amp;T Inc may be weighing a $13-billion bet to expand its television services and stymie competition from cable operators with a potential purchase of EchoStar Communications Corp, analysts have said.

 Industry rumours resurfaced this week at the Consumer Electronics Show, an industry trade show in Las Vegas, that AT amp;T may buy EchoStar outright rather than merely reselling the satellite television companys service, analysts said.

 If AT amp;T acquires EchoStar, they could continue to offer satellite television to their customers, plus theyd own a provider of services to the rest of the Baby Bells (local telephone companies), said independent telecommunications analyst Jeffrey Kagan.

 This could be a growth opportunity for AT amp;T with a quicker payoff, Kagan said.

 The new AT amp;T, created by the recent purchase of AT amp;T Inc by SBC Communications Inc, declined to comment. EchoStar, which has a market capitalisation of about $12.9 billion, could not be immediately reached for comment.

 Shares of EchoStar have risen 8.7 per cent since December 15, a rise Janco Partners Inc analyst Matthew Harrigan attributed to stock-market chatter that a potential deal with AT amp;T could emerge. Still, EchoStar is down 15.1 per cent from its 52-week high of $33.52 in January 2005.

 On Wednesday, EchoStar said it had 12 million customers as of late December. Analysts attributed that subscriber growth, in part, to SBC strengthening its efforts to market the companies co-branded satellite TV service.

 Kagan said EchoStar would give AT amp;T a quick fix while it still pursued other efforts to offer video services to customers. Through its DISH Network, EchoStar provides more than 500 channels, including sports, audio, entertainment and international programming.

 I think an acquisition of a satellite TV provider would fit an immediate need, and they would continue to invest in their networks to offer network-based services, Kagan said.

 Yet Harrigan said buying Echostar would run counter to the long-term strategy of phone companies to offer voice, data and video services over one network.

 Buying EchoStar would leave video in an entirely independent silo, rather than combining services on one network, Harrigan said.

 Edward Whitacre, chairman and chief executive of the new AT amp;T, had considered buying a different satellite television operator while at the helm of SBC.

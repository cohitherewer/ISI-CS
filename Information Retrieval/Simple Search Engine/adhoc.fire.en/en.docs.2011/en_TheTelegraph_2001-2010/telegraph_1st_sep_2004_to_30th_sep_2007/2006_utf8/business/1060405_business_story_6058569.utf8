 Tinplate lines up expansion plans

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 4: Tinplate Company of India Limited, a Tata Steel subsidiary, is planning to double its capacity at an investment of over Rs 200 crore.

 After the Rs 57-crore ongoing expansion is completed, the existing capacity of 170,000 tonnes will increase to 180,000 tonnes, Tinplate Company managing director Bushen L. Raina said on the sidelines of a Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) seminar here today.

 The capacity of the company will then be doubled at an investment of more than Rs 200 crore.

 Boston Consulting Group has devised a capacity expansion strategy and submitted its recommendations to the company.

 The recommendations, along with the proposal for expansion, would be tabled at the board meeting by the month-end. 

 The details would be available by May.

 We have been discussing this expansion drive for the past eight to nine months and it will be formalised soon, Raina said.

 Earlier, the company had said it would take four to five months to fix the mode of financing for doubling the capacity. 

 Raina, however, ruled out the public issue route for raising funds. 

 The company had also said the capacity hike would mark its entry in the beverage can business.

 Tinplate Company is expecting a turnover of around Rs 400 crore this fiscal against Rs 258.9 crore last year.

 The market share of the company has grown from 18 per cent in 1998 to 38 per cent at present.

 Regarding the possible nature of expansion and whether Tinplate Company would be looking at acquisitions, Raina said the expansion would be through organic growth.

 At present, Tinplate Company exports 25 per cent of its products to 12 countries in Southeast and West Asia.

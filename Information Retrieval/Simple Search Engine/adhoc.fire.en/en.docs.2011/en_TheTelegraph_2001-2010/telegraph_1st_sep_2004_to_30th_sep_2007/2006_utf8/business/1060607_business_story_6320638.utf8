 Big pharma scare over drug price rule

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 What?s in it?

 Mumbai, June 6: The pharmaceutical industry is apprehensive of the drug pricing policy to be announced by Ram Vilas Paswan, the minister of chemicals and fertilisers. The move to bring 354 essential medicines under control will raise the percentage of such drugs to 40.

 The industry feels that the new policy will severely constrain the freedom to price products that are not under control. This will effectively bring almost 70 per cent of the drugs under some form of check.

 This, they say, will eat into the funds set aside by national companies for research and development and penetration into global generics market.

 It is likely that while the 74 bulk drugs that are now under the Drug Price Control Order (DPCO), 1995, will continue to remain controlled, they will be subject to a price freeze of one year. It is not known what will happen after this period. 

 The industry is more worried about Paswan?s move to bring most of the 354 ?essential drugs? under cost-based price control with some exemptions for hospital products (like vaccines) and anti-cancer drugs.

 The 74 bulk drugs whose prices are controlled comprise 32 per cent of the market. The 354 drugs that are now being added cover around 8 per cent, thereby taking the total coverage to 40 per cent.

 Pharmaceutical circles feel pricing of close to 70 per cent of the medicines will be impacted. ?Say for example a 5 mg tablet is under price control and a 10 mg tablet is not, then the consumer will prefer two tablets of 5 mg, indirectly impacting the pricing of the other drug,? sources said.

 ?The policy is a recipe for disaster,? said D.G. Shah of the Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance. The policy is reminiscent of Drugs (Prices Control) Order, 1979, which controlled prices of 350 drugs resulting in widespread shortages of medicines and encouraged manufacture of spurious and counterfeit drugs, he added. 

 ?This could seriously jeopardise the potential of the industry and also drive foreign investments away,? he said.

 DPCO empowers the government to fix a maximum sale price of a bulk drug to make it available at a fair price. 

 The government calculates the retail price of a drug in accordance with a formula that includes material cost, conversion cost, cost of packing material, packing charges and MAPE or the maximum allowable post-manufacturing expenses. MAPE includes all costs incurred by the manufacturer from the stage of ex-factory cost to retailing and includes trade margin.

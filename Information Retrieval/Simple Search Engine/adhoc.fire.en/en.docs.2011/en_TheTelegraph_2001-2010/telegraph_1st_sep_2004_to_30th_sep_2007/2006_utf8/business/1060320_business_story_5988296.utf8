 Good times

 Calcutta, March 19: Job seekers in the state have a reason to smile. A majority of employers in the eastern region are planning to hire more in the second quarter of 2006, according to a recruitment survey by Manpower India. 

 The Manpower Outlook Survey for the second quarter of 2006 reveals brisk hiring prospects with a +37 per cent Net Employment Outlook for the region. 

 ?The Net Employment Outlook figure is derived by subtracting the percentage of employers expecting a decline in employment at their individual establishments from the percentage of employers expecting an increase in hiring people,? explained Soumen Basu, executive chairman, Manpower India, which has been conducting the survey globally for 40 years. 

 Of the 802 employers surveyed in the eastern region, 39 per cent expected an increase in the hiring prospects, two per cent a decline. The survey showed 49 per cent expected a status quo, while 10 per cent were unsure about their hiring plans.

 This takes the eastern region?s Net Employment Outlook for the April-June period to +37 per cent, which is on a par with the northern region.

 ?The employment scenario in the eastern states has been steadily improving,? the survey said. 

 ?The Net Employment Outlook for the third quarter of 2005 was at 25 per cent which jumped to 32 per cent in the fourth quarter of the last calendar, but dipped marginally to 31 per cent for the first three months of this year,? Basu explained. 

 ?With the index notching up six percentage points for the second quarter of the current calendar, the employment opportunities in this part of the country seem to be increasing,? he added.

 The southern region leads the employment outlook tally with a figure of 46 per cent followed by the western region at 39 per cent. However, the increase over the last quarter has been phenomenal in the western states which gained 21 percentage points. 

 For the southern and northern regions, the indices increased by 18 percentage points and five percentage points, respectively.

 The survey covered various sectors, including finance, insurance, real estate, manufacturing, mining and construction, public administration, education, services, transportation, utilities and wholesale and retail trade.

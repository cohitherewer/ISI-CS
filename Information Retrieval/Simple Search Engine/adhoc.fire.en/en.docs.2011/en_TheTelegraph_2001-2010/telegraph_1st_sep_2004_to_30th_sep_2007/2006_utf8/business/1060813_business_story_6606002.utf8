 Merger mania grips mining firms

 Takeover time

 New York, Aug. 12 (Reuters): It all started with Canadian mining company Inco Ltd saying that it wanted to acquire nickel miner Falconbridge Ltd. 

 Then Teck Cominco stepped in to make a play for Inco and was soon followed by Swiss-based Xstrata with a bid for Falconbridge. 

 Making the scenario more interesting, US-based Phelps Dodge proposed a three-way with Inco and Falconbridge to form a North American mining powerhouse. That failed but Phelps said it still wanted Inco. 

 Now, Brazils CVRD has also set its sights on Inco. 

 And market speculation has Phelps Dodge possibly becoming an acquisition target and that a Grupo Mexico executive was in New York this week for exploratory talks about that company. 

 The rumour drove up Phelps Dodge stock 4 per cent on Thursday when other mining stocks were down, and it prompted Grupo Mexico to deny that its chief financial officer was even in New York. 

 After 10 months of a numbing merger free-for-all in the mining industry, only one transaction so far looks like a done deal Falconbridges board has recommended its shareholders accept the Xstrata offer. 

 All the excitement is a stunning turnaround for an industry that was anaemic just three years ago. The catalyst has been China and its industrial growth, driving demand and prices for copper and other metals. Copper, for example, is selling for roughly five times what it went for in 2003. 

 One company gets in play and everyone wants in, said Peter Schiff, president of broker-dealer Euro Pacific Capital, in Darien, Connecticut. Everyone always wants to get bigger.

 These resources are valuable, so theres good reason to acquire them, he said. If you can pay cash, rather than diluting your shares, thats better. This sector is where the growth will be.

 Asked how long the consolidation might continue, Schiff said it depended on how long metals prices stay high. 

 There is no end in sight. Some prices will get to ridiculous levels, but we are not anywhere near that yet, he said. 

 Frank Holmes, chief executive of US Global Investors, a $5-billion fund, agreed that soaring prices were fuelling the merger madness. 

 The thing is, there is no major new copper discovery, or gold, Holmes said. 

 The big opportunities are in poor countries where the policymakers are unsophisticated. So miners are turning to each other, he said.

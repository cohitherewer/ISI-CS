 New Delhi, Oct. 3: The Mahindra-Renault joint venture is mulling the option of launching derivatives of the Logan even before the much-hyped car hits Indian roads.

 The seven and five-seater estate model of the Logan is what we are evaluating at the moment for the Indian market. However, nothing has been finalised yet. We are only studying the possibilities, said Rajesh Jejurikar, executive vice-president (marketing and sales), automotive sector, Mahindra amp; Mahindra.

 It is the estate model of the Logan which was showcased at the Paris Motor show last month. 

 The joint venture between French car manufacturer Renault and home-grown Mahindra amp; Mahindra is slated to launch the four-door sedan in the first half of 2007. 

 Sources say the car will be available in both petrol and diesel engines. 

 It is learnt that Renault is toying with the idea of launching at least five derivatives of the Logan by 2009. 

 All these are only in the concept stage. No one knows which one will be launched in which part of the world. Whether India is part of the strategy, we need to clearly wait and watch, said Jejurikar. 

 Meanwhile, the 51:49 per cent joint venture is planning to make India its export hub to serve the right-hand drive markets. This would include the South African market, where M amp;M is already present.

 A senior company official said, Anything thats right- hand drive will be from India. It could be completely-knocked-down parts or fully- built vehicles.

 There are 80 to 100 parts necessary to convert the left- hand drive Logan to a right- hand drive version. 

 The joint venture, which has a capacity to produce about 50,000 units a year, will manufacture the Logan at Mahindras facility at Nasik. This production will be entirely meant to serve the domestic market, said Jejurikar.

 The investment in the project is estimated to be Rs 700 crore.

 The launch of the Logan will be a win-win situation for both M amp;M and Renault. While it will signal Mahindras entry in the passenger car segment, it will meet the latters objective of expanding and boosting sales beyond the European market.

 Patrick Pelata, executive vice-president, product and strategic planning, Renault is quoted to have said, We are looking at selling 800,000 more cars by 2009. India will have a specific place in this plan. We want to increase volumes of sales outside Europe from 27 per cent to 37 per cent.

 Responding to a query on whether M amp;M is looking at any models from Renaults stable, Jejurikar said there are no plans yet.

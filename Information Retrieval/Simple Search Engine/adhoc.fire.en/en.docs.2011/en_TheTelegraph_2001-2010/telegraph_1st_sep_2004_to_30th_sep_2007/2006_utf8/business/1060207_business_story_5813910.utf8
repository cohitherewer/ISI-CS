 Banks want tax-free interest on deposits

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 6: Banks have urged the government to grant tax exemption on interests on fixed deposits and treat them on a par with other savings instruments such as National Savings Certificates and life insurance.

 In a pre-budget discussion with finance minister P. Chidambaram, bankers also asked for relaxation in the fringe benefit tax on superannuation schemes and other benefits given to employees.

 Analysts said banks were seeking tax exemption as they wanted to shore up their deposits. The growth rates of deposits were lagging behind the rate of credit offtake leading to tight liquidity situation and pressure on lending rates. 

 The spurt in the equity markets in the recent months also appear to have affected banks deposit growth as investors prefer stocks to bank deposits to park their funds. 

 Banks have also sought a reduction in the cash reserve ratio and release of funds under the market stabilisation scheme to enhance liquidity and lendable resources. 

 SBI chairman A.K. Purwar said the bank was reviewing its interest rates (including home loans) and will take a view in a couple of days.

 Punjab National Bank chairman S.C. Gupta believes soft interest rates would continue. But to meet the credit demand, we need the governments support as liquidity is not enough, he said. According to Bank of Baroda chairman A.K. Khandelwal, the bank will soon take a call on reviewing its lending rates.

 Insurance companies also sought exemptions of life insurance policies and pension annuities fund out of the ambit of EET (Exempt-Exempt-Tax) scheme.

 They argued group superannuation schemes should be freed from the fringe benefit tax. If complete exemption is difficult, then the tax could be imposed on 20-30 per cent of the value of the superannuation benefit, S.V. Mony, who heads the Life Insurance Council, said. HDFC Standard Life CEO Deepak Satwalekar said the EET model should not be applied to life insurance policies.

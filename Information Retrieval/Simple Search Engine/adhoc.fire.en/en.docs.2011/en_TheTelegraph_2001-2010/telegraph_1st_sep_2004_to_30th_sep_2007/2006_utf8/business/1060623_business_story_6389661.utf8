 Market keeps climbing

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, June 22: The bulls found the stock market in their grip again today. However, profit booking took away some of the gains at close. After opening firm at 10093.38, the sensex moved in a range of 10362.74 and 10093.38 before ending the day with a gain of 235.74 points, or 2.35 per cent, at 10275.88. 

 The index had closed at 10040.14 yesterday, above 10000 after 19 trading sessions. Nifty rose 71.30 points, or 2.4 per cent, to settle at 2994.75. 

 From a low of 8929.44 struck on June 14, the sensex has risen 1346.44 points or 15 per cent in the past six trading sessions to todays 10275.88. From a lifetime closing high of 12612.38 on May 10, the sensex had plunged 29 per cent to a low of 8929.44 on June 14. 

 Bargain-hunting after a sharp setback in prices since mid-May 2006, and a recovery in global markets aided the rebound. Firm global markets boosted sentiments on the domestic bourses. However, the recent spurt in the share prices led to some profit-taking towards the end, the brokers said. 

 According to market watchers, another positive factor in todays market was an increase in volumes. BSE clocked a turnover of Rs 3,254 crore, higher than yesterdays Rs 2,826 crore. Also, the market-breadth was strong. While 1,996 stocks rose on the BSE, 482 declined and 33 shares were unchanged. 

 Metal shares surged following a recovery in prices on the London Metal Exchange.

 Reliance Comm chases yen

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, May 5: The Anil Ambani-promoted Reliance Communication Ventures Limited (RCoVL) is set to tap the international market. RCoVL plans to raise Rs 4,500 crore through its maiden ADR/GDR issue. The company board today cleared the proposal. The issue enables existing shareholders to offer their shares to strategic international investors and retail/institutional investors in Japan. 

 A large number of Japanese investors have apparently evinced interest in Reliance Infocomm. As a result, the company has already made a provision in its proposed sponsored GDRs/ADRs for the same. The offering will be at a premium to the domestic market price and will be in one or more tranches, as may be appropriate, said a company statement. 

 The proposed programme relates only to existing shares and will not result in any increase in the outstanding share capital. In effect, this means that the company will not issue any new shares, but it will give an option to the existing shareholders in RCoVL. 

 The equity share capital of RCoVL after the already announced reorganisation, will remain unchanged at Rs 1,022 crore, comprising approximately 204 crore shares of Rs 5 each. 

 RCoVL has posted a net profit of Rs 403 crore on revenues of Rs 2,970 crore in the first quarter ended March 31, 2006. RCoVL had informed the stock exchanges that fiscal 2006-07 would be for 15 months from January 1, 2006 to March 31, 2007.

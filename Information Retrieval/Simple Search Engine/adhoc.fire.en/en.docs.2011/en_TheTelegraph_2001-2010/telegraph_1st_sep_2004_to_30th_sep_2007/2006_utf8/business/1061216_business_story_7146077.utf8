 Calcutta, Dec. 15: Indian Banks profitability in the current financial year will be affected by ICAIs revised accounting standard, which requires business enterprises to account for employee benefits both short-term and long-term in their balance sheets from 2006-07.

 The public sector bank has not mentioned the extent of the impact in the draft red herring prospectus filed before market regulator Sebi for its maiden public issue of 8.595 crore shares, accounting for 20 per cent of the banks post-issue equity. However, chairman and managing director K.C. Chakrabarty today said its profitability during the current financial year would be affected as it would now have to make provisions for future liabilities of employee benefits, such as pension. 

 Though we have never suppressed our profit figures and paid less pension to our staff, we will now have to make provisions for these liabilities in terms specified under the AS 15 (Revised 2005), Chakrabarty said. Every bank that pays pension to its employees will see its profitability affected by the new accounting standard, he added. We could not give the extent of the impact in our DRHP as it is still being studied at the bank, he said.

 The bank is expected to tap the market by January-end if the Sebi approval comes through.

 Under the AS 15 (Revised 2005), business entities are required to get the actuarial valuation done on long-term employee benefits, such as pension and gratuity, and make provisioning for these every year in their balance sheets, which is touted to be the international standard accounting practice for calculating employee benefits in balance sheets, 

 According to the clauses in the revised accounting standard, these liabilities should be charged to the profit and loss account of the employer.

 The Indian Bank chairman also said the bank would not immediately increase the interest rates on deposits and advances following the 50-basis-point hike in the cash reserve ratio by the Reserve Bank of India.

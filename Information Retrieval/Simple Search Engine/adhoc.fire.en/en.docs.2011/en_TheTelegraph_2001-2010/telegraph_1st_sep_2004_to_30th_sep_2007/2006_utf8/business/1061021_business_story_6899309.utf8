The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 A meeting of minds

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Oct. 20: What prompted Corus Group Plc, the eighth largest steel maker in the world, to sell out to a minnow like Tata Steel, the 56th in the pecking order?

 The clue possibly is in the future growth options available to the industry.

 Both the companies believe the present paradigm in steel business, of mining ore and producing steel at the same location, that has been the practice for the past 150 years, is passe.

 A company like Corus, having manufacturing bases in western Europe, in the UK and the Netherlands, needs to set up plants in regions where it can produce cheap steel.

 Tata Steel is inclined to a strategy of undertaking production of primary steel and finished steel at separate locations. They would prefer to make primary steel close to the location of raw materials and finished steel close to markets. The views of Tata Steel managing director B Muthuraman at the press meet in London today to announce the takeover of Corus were along these lines as he said the acquisition fits well with the new business model of the company.

 Though Muthuraman opposed export of iron ore from India, he hinted that Tata Steel was looking for iron ore mines abroad to feed Coruss plants in Europe.

 Moreover, Tata Steel will manufacture primary steel products such as slabs and billets in India and then export them to UK and the Netherlands for finishing. This involves huge logistics and the recent tieup between the Tatas and NYK of Japan will rein in shipping costs.

 Apart from the operational synergy, the cultural fit between the two companies also spurred the acquisition.

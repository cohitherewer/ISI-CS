 Nicholas buys Pfizer unit

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, June 15: Nicholas Piramal India (NPIL) will acquire a UK manufacturing facility of Pfizer for an undisclosed sum.

 The company has informed the bourses that its 100 per cent UK subsidiary, NPIL Pharmaceuticals (UK) Ltd (earlier Avecia Pharmaceuticals, UK), has entered into an agreement to acquire the Morpeth facility on an asset purchase basis. However, the company did not disclose the financial details of the agreement.

 NPIL said the deal amount and the incremental working capital would be funded from internal accruals. NPIL anticipates funding the total consideration and any needed incremental net current assets from its projected pre-acquisition internal accruals of 2006-07, it added.

 The completion of this transaction is subject to required regulatory and other approvals, which are expected by June 19.

 The unit at Morpeth, Northumberland, UK is one of Pfizers global, integrated facilities with end-to-end production and supply chain capabilities that cover active pharmaceutical ingredients, finished dosage, packaging and distribution. Morpeth is a supply hub for certain Pfizer products to the US, Europe and Japan.

 NPIL said the purchase would expand its global footprint, particularly in the finished API, packaging and supply chain areas.

 It is expected that with the acquisition of Morpeth, NPIL will become the biggest supplier (in terms of spend) within Pfizers global contract manufacturing network.

 NPIL chairman Ajay Piramal said, This acquisition again demonstrates NPILs commitment to provide an across-the-life-cycle and across-the-value-chain service to pharmaceutical companies. We are proud to have the highly respected Morpeth team aboard. Morpeth has a long tradition of excellence in manufacturing and supply chain.

 This is NPILs third acquisition in the UK after it bought Rhodias inhalation anaesthetics business in December 2004 and Avecias custom manufacturing business in December 2005.

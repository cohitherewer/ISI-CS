 Norway ready to take OVL on board

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Nov. 2: Norwegian oil company Norsk Hydro has agreed to give ONGC-Videsh a share in its oil exploration block in Angola and the Aranan field in Iran.

 Norsk Hydro has a 50 per cent stake in each of these two ventures, of which it will give OVL a participating share. 

 OVL had also offered Norsk Hydro a share in two exploratory deep water blocks in Cuba, petroleum minister Murli Deora said at the end of the Indo-Norwegian talks.

 Norsk Hydro has also agreed to provide complete technology support to develop ONGCs oil rim at Vasai East and Bassein fields in the western offshore region.

 The Norwegian company has also agreed to provide assistance to develop ONGCs fields in the eastern offshore KG basin on service contract basis.

 Deora said Norway is the third largest exporter of oil and gas in the world and India has signed a protocol of intent and five MoUs with the country for greater co-operation in the hydrocarbon sector. 

 Norwegian companies possess cutting-edge technology in deep sea oil exploration that the Indian companies are keen to acquire as they have not been able to make a major oil find despite heavy investments. The current thinking is that Norwegian technical knowhow could provide the necessary breakthrough. 

 The Indian companies are also keen on a tie-up with the Norwegian companies to jointly scout for oil and gas exploration opportunities in Africa, Latin America, Russia and the Caspian region.

 Indian Oil was keen to offer Norwegian companies a stake in the Paradip refinery to get foreign direct investment in the downstream sector. However, Norsk Hydro and Statoil have decided to stay away from the downstream sector and focus on the upstream oil exploration and production segment.

 Deora said the MoUs signed with Norway last year for cooperation in the hydrocarbon sector were bearing fruit at the ground level and both the countries would benefit as a result. He also invited the Norwegian companies to invest in the Nelp rounds of oil exploration in India.

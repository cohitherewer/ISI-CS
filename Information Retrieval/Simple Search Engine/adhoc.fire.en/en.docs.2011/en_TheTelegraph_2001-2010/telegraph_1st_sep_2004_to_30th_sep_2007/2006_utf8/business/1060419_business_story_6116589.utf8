 Lenovo, Microsoft formalise pact

 Redmond, Washington, April 18 (Reuters): Lenovo Group Ltd and Microsoft Corp on Monday formally signed a November agreement to pre-install the Windows operating system on Lenovos computers made in China.

 The agreement is expected to result in $1.2 billion in sales of Microsofts Windows operating system software over the next 12 months, Lenovo said.

 In November, Lenovo, Chinas largest PC maker, became the first personal computer manufacturer to pre-install Windows in all of its product lines for the China market, where software piracy is rampant.

 Lenovo chairman Yang Yuanqing said the percentage of customers who chose to buy a Lenovo PC pre-installed with Windows XP rose from 10 per cent before November to more than 70 per cent now.

 The partnership we sign today will further increase our co-operation in this area, as well as extending our partnership to include high-end PC product development and joint marketing in new emerging markets, Yang said at a ceremony, attended by Microsoft chairman Bill Gates, Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer and Chinese government officials.

 The formal signing of the November agreement at Microsofts headquarters in Redmond, Washington, comes a day before China President Hu Jintao arrives in Seattle and tours the software giants headquarters and has dinner at the Gates residence.

 Aside from Lenovo, three Chinese PC manufacturers have announced plans to buy a total of over $400 million worth of Windows operating system software.

 The agreements follow a Chinese government decree that requires all PCs made in China to have a licensed operating software installed before leaving the factory as part of the governments efforts to crack down on piracy.

 Lenovo, the worlds third-largest PC manufacturer, last year bought International Business Machines Corps PC assets for $1.25 billion.

 Shares of Microsoft closed down 23 cents at $26.84.

 Big bang IPO from China bank

 Beijing, Sept. 5 (AP): Chinas biggest commercial bank plans to raise up to $19 billion with an initial public offering this year, possibly breaking the record for the worlds biggest IPO, a news report said today.

 Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) plans to sell shares simultaneously on the Hong Kong and Shanghai exchanges before the end of October, Dow Jones Newswires said, citing documents submitted to Chinese securities regulators.

 An ICBC spokesman, who would give only his surname, Xie, wouldnt confirm the report or give other information.

 The China banking regulatory commission said in July that ICBC was approved for an IPO but didnt say when or how large it would be. Phone calls to the commission werent answered.

 Earlier reports by Hong Kong newspapers put the size of the planned ICBC offering in the $14-18 billion range. The mainland offering would raise up to $7.5 billion with the rest coming from Hong Kong, Dow Jones said.

 The biggest IPO to date is the $18.4 billion raised by Japans NTT Mobile Communications Network in 1998.

 Chinas state-owned commercial banks are in the midst of a flurry of IPOs on foreign stock exchanges. They are raising billions of dollars to modernise operations as Beijing prepares to meet a December deadline for fully opening their market to foreign competitors under its WTO commitments.

 The countrys second-biggest lender, Bank of China, raised $11.2 billion in May with an IPO in Hong Kong that was the fourth-largest ever in the world.

 UltraTech profit at Rs 24 cr

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Jan. 21: UltraTech Cement, the AV Birla group company, has posted a net profit of Rs 24 crore for the third quarter ended December 31, 2005 against a loss of Rs 11 crore in the corresponding previous period.

 After providing for freight and trading sales impact, the companys net sales grew by 5 per cent to Rs 783 crore from Rs 660 crore in the year-ago period. The topline growth, though marginal, came despite a decline in sales volume, reflecting that the price realisation by the company from both the domestic and export markets had improved.

 During the reporting quarter, Ultratech produced 31.27 lakh tonnes of clinker, up from 28.13 lakh tonnes in the October-December period in 2004. However, its cement production was lower at 30.70 lakh tonnes from 31.04 lakh tonnes. Clinker capacity utilisation stood at 96 per cent compared with 80 per cent in the same quarter during the previous year. 

 The effective cement capacity utilisation, the company said, was lower at 87 per cent against 97 per cent in 2004, consequent to a lower clinker export and restricted despatches from the companys plant at Andhra Pradesh and Arrakonam. Aggregate sales stood at 38.04 lakh tonnes, down from 40.86 lakh tonnes in the corresponding previous period.

 According to the company, its power and fuel costs rose by 6 per cent during the quarter mainly due to the increase in petroleum prices.

 Last month, UltraTechs board of directors approved a proposal for amalgamation of its subsidiary, Narmada Cement Company Ltd (NCCL), with the company. After the merger, Ultratech Cements aggregate production capacity will go up to 17 million tonnes.

 FMCG major Godrej Consumer Products Ltd has posted a 38.81 per cent rise in net profit at Rs 36.12 crore for the quarter ended December 31, 2005 compared with Rs 26.02 crore in the year-ago period.

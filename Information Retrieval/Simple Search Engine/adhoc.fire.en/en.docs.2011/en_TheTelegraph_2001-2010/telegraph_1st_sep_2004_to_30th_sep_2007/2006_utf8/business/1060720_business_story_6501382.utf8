 Enough wheat stock to meet demand

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, July 19: Food and agriculture minister Sharad Pawar today ruled out the possibility of a rise in wheat prices as stocks were sufficient to meet the current demand.

 There is no problem of stock availability and the prices of wheat are now stable, the minister said. 

 Spot prices fell to Rs 864 a quintal this month from Rs 922 in February, he said. 

 Estimated output for 2005-06 of 69.48 million tonnes (mt) will fall short of the target by 6 mt. However, it is more than last years level of 68.64 million tonnes.

 Pawar said there was no proposal to import additional wheat to meet the governments social commitments. The private sector has been allowed to import wheat at 5 per cent duty.

 Earlier, STC had floated tenders to import 35 lakh tonnes, of which more than one lakh tonne has arrived in south India. Pawar said the rise in temperatures 15 days prior to harvest caused output to be less than what has been targeted.

 I had feared that the wheat production could be affected as the wheat crops were deprived of winter conditions for about 15 crucial days in January, he said, adding that he had apprised scientists and officials of the situation.

 That is the reason for bringing down the estimates from over 71 mt to 69.48 mt, Pawar said. 

 Wheat, along with pulses and sugar, are politically sensitive commodities as they are used by most Indians. High prices in the past have seen several state governments being voted out of power. 

 The government has already fully exempted pulses from customs duty. The exemption is available up to March 31 next year. 

 More import decisions are likely in coming months as well as monetary and fiscal measures if prices continue to rise, government officials said. The countrys annual inflation rate has already topped 5.5 per cent.

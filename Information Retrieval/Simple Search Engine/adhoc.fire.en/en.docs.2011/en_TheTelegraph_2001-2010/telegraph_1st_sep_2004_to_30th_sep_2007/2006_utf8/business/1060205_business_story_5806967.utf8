 Arcelor yet to make up mind

 AMIT ROY

 London, Feb. 4: There was confusion today about whether Arcelor chief executive Guy Dolle was willing to hold talks with Lakshmi Mittal about a possible takeover.

 Yesterday, in Paris, where both Dolle and Lakshmi Mittal, the chairman of Mittal Steel, were present at an industry conference, the former appeared to be saying he was open to negotiations but later contradicted himself.

 What has slightly moderated the attitude of the French government, which had initially expressed hostility to the idea of a Mittal takeover, has been a warning from Kamal Nath, Indias commerce minister, that India will be watching this very carefully.

 With the French president Jacques Chirac due to visit India on February 20 and 21, this statement appeared to be a signal to the French government that if Mittal was deemed unsuitable because of his Indian origins, French companies may encounter difficulties making inroads into India.

 French finance minister Thierry Breton, for example, who had met Mittal, toned down his stance on Thursday, saying the final decision was up to Arcelors shareholders.

 Many analysts expect Mittal to raise its bid or offer more cash although he has said he will not.

 I think Mittal will succeed, predicted Jean-Noel Vieille, fund manager at KBL France Gestion in Paris, who has been cutting his exposure to Arcelor in recent days. 

 Id imagine that Mittal, in order to increase the pressure on Arcelor, could increase the price. Its probably what the market is playing.

 Todays Financial Times appeared to be implying that Arcelor was preparing the ground for a climb down. However, a closer reading of what Dolle actually said suggests that the newspaper may be jumping the gun somewhat.

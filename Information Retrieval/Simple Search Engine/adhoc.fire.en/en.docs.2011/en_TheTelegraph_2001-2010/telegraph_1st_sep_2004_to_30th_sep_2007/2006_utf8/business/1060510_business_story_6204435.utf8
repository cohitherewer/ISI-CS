 Radico Khaitan on the prowl

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, May 9: Radico Khaitan is eyeing acquisitions and joint venture partners in both domestic and international markets. 

 We are expecting a growth of 20-25 per cent in sales based on our expansion plans. We also expect our profit after tax to go up by around 30-35 per cent during the year, said managing director Abhishek Khaitan. 

 The company had appointed Rabo India Securities to identify suitable acquisition and joint venture targets. We will take a decision based on the potential and the scale of operations of the company, said Khaitan. 

 Radico Khaitan registered a 17 per cent rise in sales turnover for the fiscal 2005-06 at Rs 1,135.39 crore against Rs 973.59 crore in the previous fiscal. Its profit after tax stood at Rs 45.16 crore, up 26 per cent from Rs 35.85 crore in the previous year. 

 The company sold 12 million cases during 2005-06, a growth of 20 per cent against 10.02 million cases in the previous fiscal. 

 We are keen on enhancing our exposure in the overseas market and aim for a 200 per cent increase in our exports turnover, said Khaitan. 

 We plan to do so by opening up new global markets and also increasing our market share in the existing markets, he added. The company had achieved a 266 per cent growth in exports in the last fiscal.

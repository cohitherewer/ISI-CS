 Great growth show fuels uptrend

 Big leap

 The excellent GDP numbers for April-June clearly justify the rebound in the market. True, the overall 8.9 per cent growth is a bit lower than the sizzling 9.3 per cent rate notched up in the January-March quarter. But manufacturing growth has accelerated to 11.3 per cent compared with 8.9 per cent in the previous quarter. Thats whats important for the market. Lower growth in agriculture and in some services dragged down the overall growth rate. 

 In short, the confidence of investors has been strengthened. New ammunition has been provided to those who argue that Indias high rate of growth deserves the high valuations in its market. No wonder the sensex is once again near its record highs. No wonder foreign portfolio inflows into India continue at a time when money is being taken out of emerging markets. And if the Indian economy can do well at a time when oil prices were so high, it should do even better if oil prices continue to be at their current relatively low levels.

 The other piece of data that came out on Friday wasnt so good the current account deficit for the April-June quarter rose to $6 billion from a surplus of $1.8 billion in the January-March quarter. That was along expected lines as it was obvious that high oil prices would take their toll.

 Compared with the January-March quarter, the pace of growth in exports slowed, while import growth was more robust. Merchandise export grew at a year-on-year rate of 17 per cent during April-June compared with a 22.9 per cent growth in January-March. Year-on-year import growth in April-June was 23.8 per cent during April-June compared with a more moderate 20.1 per cent during January-March. The combination of slowing exports and expanding imports bloated the trade deficit. Net invisibles too were higher in the January-March period. The upshot: the current account deficit has shot up.

 How was the deficit funded? As expected, portfolio flows during April-June were a negative $527 million, compared with a huge inflow of $4.3 billion in the January-March quarter. FDI too was slightly lower. External commercial borrowings were slightly higher in the April-June quarter, but the main difference was on account of banking capital, which went up to a net $5 billion compared with a negative $427 million during January-March. The RBI says thats because of a drawdown of foreign assets of commercial banks. This kind of funding is not sustainable and neither is the substitution of equity flows by debt.

 However, the data had little impact on the rupee, primarily because currently low oil prices suggest that things will change for the better. Also, portfolio flows have picked up and the robust April-June GDP numbers suggest that they are likely to accelerate. Going forward, if oil prices stay where they are, the BoP should look better.

 The worry, however, is the RBI. The GDP numbers show that so far its attempts to cool the economy have had no impact that calls for higher interest rates, especially because credit growth remains above 30 per cent and money supply growth at 19.6 per cent.

 How should the market perform in the context of a slowing US economy and high domestic growth? This is what Credit Suisses debut report on the Indian markets has to say: In the past, economies with their own independent drivers have normally had outperforming markets at times of US slowdowns. Fundamentally, Indias growth story remains almost completely domestic. Yes, there could be pressure on its valuations from any global market turmoil, but it would prove temporary as long as Indias own growth story remains intact. For the domestic story, inflation and interest rates remain the prime risks, which perversely mitigate if the global economy cools.

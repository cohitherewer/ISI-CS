 Calcutta, July 7: Tata Teleservices Limited (TTSL) plans to spend bulk of the Rs 110 crore lined up for Calcutta this fiscal on upgrading its network. It will increase the number of cell sites in the city from 250 to 350 and add two switches.

 The eastern region would also have a 1,700-km optical fibre network.

 We have over six lakh customers in Calcutta till June-end. We have started operations here around 17 months back. Our investments this fiscal will take the total amount spent for Calcutta to Rs 450 crore. We hope to reach a 10-lakh customer base by the end of the fiscal, said Abhijit Pal, chief operating officer, Calcutta, TTSL.

 Of the six lakh users, 1.75 lakh are Indicom Walky subscribers and the remaining have mobile CDMA connections.

 For the last two months, the company has an over 60 per cent market share in the fixed wireless segment.

 The net additions for CDMA mobile connections have been increasing steadily from 30,000 in April, 36,000 in May to 39,000 in June.

 However, the net additions for Walky have been declining from 7,000 in April to 5,000 in May and 3,200 in June.

 In the next three months, the company would add 40 cell sites.

 The implementation of the plan to share cell sites with other operators will determine the companys network expansion roadmap.

 TTSL would invest Rs 600 crore for the eastern region, including Bengal, Calcutta, Orissa, and Bihar circles.

 TTSL also plans to expand coverage to 488 towns in the east from the existing 206 by March 2007 and to 1,246 base station towers (BTS) from 727.

 The Northeast operations will begin this year and the investment would be over and above Rs 600 crore. TTSL is currently analysing the economic viability of operations in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.

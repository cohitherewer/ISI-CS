 Sage Group snaps up US finance company

 London, Jan. 9 (Reuters): Sage Group, the business software firm, broadened its portfolio beyond accounting products on Monday as it announced the purchase of US payment-processing company Verus Financial Management.

 Britains largest listed software firm said it was buying Verus for ?184 million ($323 million) in cash, including debt, from privately-owned Financial Technology Ventures and other shareholders.

 The Nashville, Tennessee-based firm specialises in credit-card and cheque processing for 101,000 small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the United States, such as restaurants, petrol stations and property managers.

 Finance director Paul Harrison said Verus would complement Sages existing payroll services operation in the United States, where the company supports over 1 million SMEs. Weve been trialing merchanting services to SMEs for some time and seen theres been quite a strong interest in the US, Harrison said. 

 Verus made underlying operating profits of ?12 million last year ? a threefold increase on 2004 ? on revenues of ?36 million. Shares in Sage had risen 1 per cent to 260 pence, following a mixed reaction from analysts.

 UBS described the acquisition as an expensive step out of Sages core competency. However, Cazenove was more positive.

 We view this as a smart move into a growing market, and one which provides significant cross selling opportunities in both directions, Cazenove said in a research note.

 Despite the size of the deal, Sages biggest since buying US peer Interact in 2001, Harrison said the firm would still consider share buybacks and further acquisitions, in payment processing and other areas.

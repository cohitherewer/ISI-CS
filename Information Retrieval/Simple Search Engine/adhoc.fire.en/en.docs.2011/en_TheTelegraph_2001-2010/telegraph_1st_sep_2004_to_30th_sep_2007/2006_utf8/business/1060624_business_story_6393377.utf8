 Daimler trucks hit Indian roads

 CHANDRALEKHA TULAL

 Pune, June 23: Daimler Chrysler has entered the Indian commercial vehicles market with the Mercedes Benz Actros, its heavy-duty application trucks.

 We are focusing on mining applications in the country and targeting the medium to heavy duty truck segment, said Wilfried G. Aulbur, managing director and chief executive officer of Daimler Chrysler India. 

 The truck has two variants ? the Actros 4040K, which comes with a price tag of Rs 55 lakh, and the Actros 4840K at Rs 65 lakh.

 The Actros has a 12-litre engine with a delivery output of about 400 horse power at an RPM as low as 1,800 and is available as a completely built imported chassis. This makes it the most powerful engine across the tipper segment of the domestic commercial vehicles industry, said Aurlbur.

 While the total market size for trucks is about 85,000 units per year, the size for the segment we are targeting is about 800-900. However, compared with the overall market, which is growing at about 4-5 per cent a year, this segment is growing at above 15 per cent, said Gert Nissler, director (commercial vehicles) of Daimler Chrysler India.

 We are also evaluating the options to introduce tractor trailers, said Nissler.

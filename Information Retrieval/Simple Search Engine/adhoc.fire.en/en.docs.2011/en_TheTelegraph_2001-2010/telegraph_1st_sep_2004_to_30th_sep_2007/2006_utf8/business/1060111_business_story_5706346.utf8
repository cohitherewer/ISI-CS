 Sanyang picks up 11% in Kinetic Motor 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Motwani: Optimistic

 Mumbai, Jan. 10: Taiwanese automaker Sanyang Industry Company will pick up an 11.12 per cent stake in Kinetic Motor Company Limited for Rs 13.63 crore. 

 Kinetic Motor will issue 20.65 lakh fresh equity shares of Rs 10 each on a preferential basis to Sanyang Industry at Rs 66 per share, the company informed the Bombay Stock Exchange. 

 Post issue, the paid-up capital of Kinetic Motor will go up from Rs 16.51 crore to Rs 18.57 crore. Sanyang will hold 11.12 per cent in the increased capital, while Kinetic will continue to have a majority stake of 56.76 per cent. 

 Our main interest in the preferential issue is the financial backup and the technical strength that will be brought into the company, Sulajja Firodia Motwani, joint managing director of Kinetic Motor, said. 

 Sanyang is a billion-dollar auto giant and possesses advanced next generation technological expertise. We have an exclusive technology purchase agreement with them and will incorporate them in launching newer models, Motwani added. 

 The first model to be manufactured with their technical assistance will be rolled out in the next 12 months. While the mother brand will remain Kinetic, we might also consider sub-branding with the SYM brand, she added.

 India is a huge market for Sanyang and this will mark their entry into India. They will gain a strong foothold in the country, whereby the more we sell, the more they earn as royalty for their technical tie-up, she said.

 Following that, they might also consider using India as a low-cost base for manufacturing and supplying auto components to both Kinetic Motor and other associated companies including Kinetic Engineering, Motwani said. 

 Currently, Sanyang has no exposure in Kinetic and is neither a promoter nor a person acting in concert with the promoter. 

 We have offered them a minority stake in the company and there will not be any change in the control of the company subsequent to the preferential allotment, Motwani explained. 

 Kinetic Motor will hold an extra ordinary general meeting of shareholders on February 7 for the preferential issue.

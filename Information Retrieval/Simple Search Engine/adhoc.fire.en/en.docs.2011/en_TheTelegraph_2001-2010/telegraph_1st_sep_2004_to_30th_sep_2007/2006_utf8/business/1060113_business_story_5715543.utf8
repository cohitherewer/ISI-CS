 New Delhi, Jan. 12: Yamaha Motors India (YMI), the Japanese motorcycle major, today said it would invest Rs 300 crore in India over the next two years. Yamaha, which plans to launch at least three models this year, will invest in product development and expansion.

 T. Ishikawa, new CEO of Yamaha Motors India, said, ?India is one of the fastest emerging two-wheeler markets in the world and we want to double our market share by the end of 2010.?

 Ishikawa said the company would now focus on strengthening the Yamaha brand in India.

 Yamaha Motors India, which has a market share of about 5 per cent, has adopted a three-pronged business strategy for the next two years.

 ?Our new products will target the young urban customers as well as the rural youth and we plan to revamp the marketing network by opening lifestyle outlets in urban centres and commuter shops in the rural market,? Ishikawa said.

 The company?s dealer network would be upgraded and expanded to 450 outlets by the end of this year. In India, Yamaha?s product range includes Fazer DX in the deluxe segment, G5 in the standard segment and Crux and Crix S in the basic segment.

 The company today showcased its concept bike Gladiator for the bike lovers at the Auto Expo 2006. ?It is in the conceptual stage. It will be kept in our showrooms for display. Depending on the feedback, we will decide when to launch it in India?, said Rajiv Pruthi, general manager, sales and marketing, YMI.

 Yamaha officials say that if the bike is launched here, the company will manufacture it at the Greater Noida (near Delhi) facility.

 Other bikes on display included Fazer 250 cc, a Brazilian model, Fazer 600 cc, Fazer FZ-6, and the Roadliner (big cruiser bike).

 For Fazer 250 cc, Pruthi said ?we will take a decision in the next 3-6 months to finalise whether we should launch this model in India?.

 YMI has also showcased its R series big bikes, R1 and R6, which currently sells in Europe, Japan and the US.

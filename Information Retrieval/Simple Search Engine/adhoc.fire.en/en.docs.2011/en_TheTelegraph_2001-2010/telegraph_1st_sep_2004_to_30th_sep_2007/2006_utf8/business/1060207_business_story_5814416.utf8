 Singapore firm to weigh P amp; bid

 Singapore, Feb. 6 (Reuters): Singapores PSA is expected to decide by the end of this week on its next move in the $7-billion-dollar (?3.9 billion) bidding war for ports and ferries group P amp;, a person familiar with the situation said on Monday.

 State-owned groups PSA and Dubai Ports World are battling to take over P amp;, which owns valuable container ports in India, China and Australia.

 All options are being explored. The door is not closed but it has to be commercially viable (for PSA), the person said on condition of anonymity.

 Quoting unnamed sources, Singapores Business Times reported on Monday that PSA, which is owned by state investment group Temasek was close to throwing in the towel.

 A spokesman for PSA declined to comment on the report.

 P amp; shareholders are scheduled to meet on February 13 to vote on Dubai Ports Worlds bid of 520 pence per share, which was recommended by P amp;s management. The bid values the firm at ?3.9 billion and tops PSAs initial offer of 470 pence a share.

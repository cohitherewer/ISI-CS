 Patent rules made more transparent

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, May 11: The government has notified the new Patents (Amendment) Rules 2006 and all patent-related activities can now be performed by the patent offices at Calcutta, Chennai, Delhi and Mumbai. 

 Earlier applications related to certain sections of the patents rules could be filed only at the head office in Calcutta. Now these sections have been deleted and all applications can be filed at any patent office in the four metros.

 Commerce minister Kamal Nath said today the thrust of the patents rules is to introduce transparency, decentralise the functioning of the patent offices, simplify procedures and to make them user-friendly. 

 With the new rules coming into force, patent applications are now to be mandatorily published within one month after expiry of the statutory period of 18 months and, in case of request for an early publication, the application is to be published within one month from the date of request. 

 This step will introduce an element of certainty regarding the date of publication, which was hitherto not available.

 India had come under fire at the WTO over its intellectual property rights laws. The reverse engineering by the domestic pharmceutical companies had come in for severe criticism in the western countries. 

 With a view to enforcing transparency and ensuring time-bound disposal of patent applications, definitive time frames have been prescribed for various activities by the patent offices under the new norms.

 A patent application now has to be referred to an examiner within one month of a request for its examination. Further, the controller will now be required to take a decision on the report of the examiner within one month of its submission and the first examination report has to be issued within six months of the date of request for examination of a patent application. The time for granting permission to file patents abroad has also been reduced to just 21 days.

 To make the system user-friendly, timelines available for applicants and the public have also been extended. 

 Accordingly, the timeframe for making a request for examination has been extended from 36 to 48 months and the time for filing a pre-grant opposition extended from 3 to 6 months.

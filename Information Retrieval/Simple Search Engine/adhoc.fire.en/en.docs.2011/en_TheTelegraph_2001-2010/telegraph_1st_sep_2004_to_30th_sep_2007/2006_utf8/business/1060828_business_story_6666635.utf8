 Cash reward for Ambattur employees

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Ruia: Sops galore

 Chennai, Aug. 27: Dunlop chairman Pawan Ruia will reward the employees of the companys Ambattur unit for opening the plant ahead of schedule, sending strong signals to their more militant counterparts at the companys Sahagunj unit in Bengal.

 Ruia has announced an ad hoc payment of Rs 2,500 for the 350 workers who revived the plant within five months of starting maintenance.

 Ruia also declared a one-time payment of Rs 1,000 to another 850 employees who would join work in phases.

 It is a gesture of appreciation of the tremendous work you have put in to bring the plant back to life today, he said to a jubilant crowd at a function to mark the commercial production of Dunlop after five years.

 The Bengal plant at Hooghlys Sahagunj is still two months away from commencing work as labour unrest delayed maintenance.

 Settling workers dues was seen as the biggest challenge for Ruia to revive Dunlop, who took over the company last December from the Chhabria family.

 The revival was difficult in Bengal. While the relation between the new management, workers and unions remained cordial, the atmosphere of mistrust lingered longer at Sahagunj.

 Maintenance had to be stopped because of the unrest. 

 Ruia said Sahagunj workers could also expect such rewards and much more. 

 However, that would be linked to their performance. 

 The Sahagunj factory is 78 years old while Ambattur is only 30. Moreover, machine parts were stolen from Sahagunj, causing severe damages.

 The president of the Dunlop union at Ambattur and member of Parliament, A. Krishnaswamy, today called Ruia a hero, to the cheering of the workers.

 The mood, however, was never so euphoric at Sahagunj but Ruia hopes to bury the past.

 He has till now spent Rs 110 crore for different purpose like workers dues and paying creditors.

 He is also in the process of tying up Rs 400-450 crore to deploy at Dunlop.

 This is the right time to come back in the market. The margin has improved in the last few months and the demand is buoyant, he said. 

 The Ambattur factory will initially produce truck and bus tyres. Production will be raised to the optimum 130 tonnes a day by the year-end.

 Ruia expects Dunlop to break even by March 2007, when Sahagunj is likely to reach the optimum production capacity of 130 tonnes a day.

 The new tagline of Dunlop reads the leader is back. Only time will tell if the leader is Bengal or Tamil Nadu.

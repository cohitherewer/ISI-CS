 Assam Company to take up core projects

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 25: After tea and oil exploration, Calcutta-based Assam Company Limited (ACL) is now venturing into infrastructure.

 It has formed a 50:50 joint venture with Italys leading civil construction company, Torno Internazionale Spa.

 The new company will pursue infrastructure projects dams, power plants, highways, tunnels, underground metro in India.

 Two immediate sectors that excite us are metro rail and ultra mega power projects, Abhay Chawdhry, chief financial officer (CFO) of Assam Company, said.

 Incidentally, Torno has already been technically shortlisted for the metro rail extension project in Delhi. If it gets the job, the new company could be the vehicle for executing it.

 The new entity has been forged by Assam Companys wholly owned subsidiary, Duncan Macneill Natural Resources Limited, UK and Torno Investments Ltd, a group company of Torno Internazionale Spa.

 Duncan Macneill Torno Infrastructure Limited (DMTIL) as the company will be called will have two board of directors from each side.

 Initially, the chairman will be appointed by Torno for a term of one year. Thereafter, Duncan Macneill Natural Resources will appoint a chairman for an equal term. Subsequently, the post will alternate between the parties.

 Assam Company has used the UK subsidiary to raise cheap funds from the London market to execute projects in future.

 Assam Company is the flagship company of the Duncan Macneill Group and one of the oldest tea companies in India. Of late, it has forayed into oil exploration. 

 Established in 1929, Tornos core specialisation has been in construction of large dams and hydroelectric power plants. 

 Currently, the activities of the company cover multiple disciplines of civil engineering, comprising roads, railways, airports, harbours, underground constructions, sewerage systems, water supply, and construction of traditional hydroelectric and nuclear power plants.

 Torno has successfully implemented a number of projects in Europe Africa and Asia.

 It is now focusing on concession contracts, BOT contracts and project financing. 

 Given that India is set to invest $150 billion in infrastructure, Tornos entry is well timed, say experts tracking the sector.

 Calcutta, Oct. 15: The interest rate on the special purpose tea fund (SPTF) is likely to be fixed at 9 per cent.

 Tea Board chairman Basudeb Banerjee said, We had discussions with bank officials in Mumbai and it seems the rate of interest would possibly hover at around 9 per cent. However, this is the initial picture and the complete one will emerge as we draw close to the disbursement period.

 The last meeting of the working committee on SPTF, comprising representatives from the industry, the Tea Board and the Reserve Bank of India, was held in September.

 Banerjee said the disbursal of funds might get delayed beyond the original deadline of November 1 since the proposal was yet to receive the permission of the cabinet, and it takes a month from cabinet approval to disburse the funds.

 The disbursement is likely to be later in November, and the cabinet approval was expected anytime.

 The rate of 9 per cent, recommended after the study of SBI Capital Markets, will ensure better servicing of the loan, Monojit Dasgupta, secretary, Indian Tea Association, said.

 While the board wants a rate of 9 per cent or less, banks want the rate to be linked to either the prime lending rate (PLR) or government securities, given that the loan was a long-term one.

 A bank official said, Government securities rates have been firming up while interest rates are also on the upswing. In such a scenario, going by the nature of the industry for the past six years or so, the rates should be such that it covers the long term risk and cost. a rate between 10.75 and 11.25 per cent would be advisable.

 Industry officials are opposed to loans at the commercial rate of interest, arguing for treatment on a par with infrastructure loans.

 North Bengal will be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the fund. 

 The region expects to receive around Rs 1,400 crore of the Rs 4,500 crore-fund set up by the Centre to improve productivity of the bushes in the next 15 years.

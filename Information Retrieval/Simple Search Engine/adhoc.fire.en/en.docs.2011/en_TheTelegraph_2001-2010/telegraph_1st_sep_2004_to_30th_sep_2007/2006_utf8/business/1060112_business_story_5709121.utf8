 Chinas trade surplus trebles

 Growth guns

 Beijing, Jan. 11 (Reuters): Chinas trade surplus more than tripled to $102 billion in 2005, data showed on Wednesday, but December figures also reinforced a more recent trend of weakening export growth.

 Critics, particularly from the United States, charge that Chinas ballooning trade surplus is a major source of global economic imbalances, but the latest data supports the view that the gap is narrowing slowly as Beijing promotes greater domestic consumption.

 China is gradually becoming a more positive force for global growth as its policies are adjusted toward boosting domestic demand, Goldman Sachs economists said in a report.

 Chinas December exports rose 18.2 per cent from a year earlier to $75.41 billion, according to precise figures posted on the website (www.customs.gov.cn) of the General Administration of Customs.

 Approximate figures had been calculated from other data earlier this week.

 Imports, up 22.2 per cent at $64.4 billion, rose faster than exports for the second consecutive month, pulling in the trade surplus to $11 billion from $11.1 billion a year earlier.

 Economists polled by Reuters had expected a surplus of $10.3 billion.

 The latest trade figures showed a steady slowdown in the growth of the trade surplus last year. A first-quarter gap of about $25 billion over a year earlier narrowed to only about $5 billion in the fourth quarter.

 That means the full-year surplus of $102 billion, compared with $32 billion in 2004, largely reflects gains posted earlier in the year.

 Goldman Sachs said net exports had become a much less important driver of economic growth as a result of adjustments to macroeconomic policy following the July 21 revaluation of the yuan.

 In addition, major data revisions showing that the services sector was much bigger than previously thought have eased concerns that Chinas growth is too reliant on exports, economists have said. 

 Currency pressure 

 Grace Ng, greater China economist with JP Morgan, said in a research note that she expected Chinas annual export growth to moderate in 2006 to around 15 to 20 percent.

 The National Development and Reform Commissions Academy of Macroeconomic Research, a think-tank with the national planning authority, expected 2006 exports to rise 15 per cent and imports to increase 18 per cent.

 Some economists forecast the trade surplus would narrow in 2006 to about $100 billion, slightly smaller than 2005s gap but still big enough to spell continued US pressure for Beijing to let the yuan rise more quickly.

 It is in Chinas own interest to further adjust the exchange rate of the (yuan) to help shift the growth driver away from the external sector, Goldman Sachs said.

 Chinese policy makers have made a priority of increasing the role of domestic consumption as a driver of growth, instead of relying so heavily on investment and exports.

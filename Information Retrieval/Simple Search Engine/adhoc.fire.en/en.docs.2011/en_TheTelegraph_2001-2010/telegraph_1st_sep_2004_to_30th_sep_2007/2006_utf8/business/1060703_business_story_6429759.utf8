 Monsoon bonanza for Anil fixed wireless

 Ambani: Big plans

 Mumbai, July 2: After last year?s hit with the Monsoon Hungama scheme, Reliance Communications is planning a similar offer in fixed wireless phones this season.

 Sources said the company plans to cut tariff by offering fixed wireless calls at local call rates. Details of the plan are, however, sketchy at this stage.

 The company is believed to have recently received a consignment of around half-a-million fixed wireless phones. From June 1 MTNL is offering local rates on fixed calls between Mumbai and Delhi.

 The Anil Ambani-controlled Reliance Communications plans to harness the potential of the fixed wireless segment, where it estimates a subscriber base of 6 million by the year-end, sources added. The company has 4 million fixed wireless subscribers.

 A Reliance Communications spokesperson said, ?We are committed to provide the best and competitive services to our millions of customers.? The spokesperson, however, refused to confirm or deny the development.

 According to industry estimates, the top 10 cities contribute close to 45 per cent of the 20-billion-minute long-distance traffic in the country. Reliance Communications wants to have a 40 per cent market share through the local call tariff plan on its network under Reliance Hello that will be unveiled soon, sources said.

 Reliance Communications offers eight schemes under its Reliance Hello plan. With monthly commitments from Rs 150 to Rs 1,100, the call charges vary from 40 paise per minute to Rs 1.20 per minute.

 The company, which has recently applied for GSM spectrum in Delhi and Mumbai, is believed to be looking at a two-pronged technology strategy. While its CDMA network would be deployed for high-end ARPU subscribers requiring 3G and fixed wireless services, the proposed GSM network would serve users whose requirements are limited to voice and SMS.

 Last July, the company unveiled its Monsoon Hungama offer for mobile phones at an upfront payment of Rs 501 against the then entry fee of Rs 3,300 for limited mobility services.

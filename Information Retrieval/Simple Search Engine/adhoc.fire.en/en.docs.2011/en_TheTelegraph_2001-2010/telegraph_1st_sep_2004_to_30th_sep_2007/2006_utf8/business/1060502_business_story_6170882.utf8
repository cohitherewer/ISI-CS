 IOC go-slow on retail expansion

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Behuria: Wait and watch

 Calcutta, May 1: Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) has slammed the brakes on retail expansion this year because of spiralling losses from under-recoveries on petrol and diesel sales, coupled with falling per pump sales due to stiff competition from private retailers.

 The company, which put up over 1,500 retail outlets in 2005-06, now wants to consolidate its position rather than add new ones.

 Throughput per pump has fallen from 240 kilolitre four years back to 140-145 kilolitre now.

 In the same period, IOC has put up over 5,000 outlets. But diesel sales, which contributes 80 per cent of the total fuel sold by the company, has not grown. Last fiscal, it remained flat while petrol sales grew by 6 per cent.

 Sarthak Behuria, chairman and managing director of IOC, said the strategy would now be to consolidate the urban and highway sectors.

 ?We will add some more (retail outlets) in the rural area which offers big opportunity,? he added.

 The company has created a new format for rural outlets.

 A dealer gets 51 paise and 80 paise by selling a litre of diesel and petrol, respectively. In the last few years, dealers? profitability has eroded.

 The company is worried that such a situation might prompt dealers to resort to adulteration.

 One of the ways to tackle this problem is to step up non-fuel sales. Moreover, it is rolling out branded fuels, which come with higher margin for dealers.

 In a consolidation move in the urban market, it has decided to set up 1,000 Extra Care retail outlets this fiscal. It will be a concept store with bank ATMs, a convenience store, and facilities for communications and healthcare. These outlets will be fully automated.

 Moreover, the company is promoting branded fuels like Extra Premium (petrol) and Extra Mile (diesel). 

 N.G. Kannan, director (marketing) of IOC, said the company would provide Extra Power to 7,500 outlets. Branded fuels now contribute 25-35 per cent of sales in the outlets.

 ?Our plan is to make more people use branded products,? he added.

 IOC is also focusing on loyalty programmes like Extra Power, the fleet card facilitating cashless transactions.

 Kannan said the company has set a target to sell 20 per cent of its diesel through Extra Power. In 2005-06, it sold 9 per cent of its diesel through this payment mechanism. But in March this year, sales worth Rs 20 crore are taking place through this method.

 Indian Oil has a 34 per cent market share in petrol and 43.4 per cent in diesel.

 The company has 12,000 outlets and some 3,500 IBP pumps.

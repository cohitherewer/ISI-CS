 Calcutta, Dec. 9: Motorola India is in talks with Bengal for partnering in its e-governance ventures. The company has implemented its patented technology in providing low-cost wireless connectivity to Panchayats in Rajasthan. Talks are on with other governments for similar projects.

 We would be glad to partner Bengal in any such initiative where we bring in global expertise through this particular technology and adapt it to Indian conditions. The steps the state has taken for e-governance implementation, though a late start, have been impressive, said Firdose Vandrevala, chairman of Motorola India and corporate vice-president of Motorola Inc.

 Bengal IT principal secretary Siddharth also confirmed that a number of companies have approached the state for partnerships.

 However we would like these companies to come up with concrete proposals instead of limiting it to discussions so that we could either accept or reject them, Siddharth said.

 On his recommendations for Bengal, Vandrevala said the state needs to form an independent company for project decision and implementation for e-governance projects.

 Bengal will provide BT Infotech with 10,000 sq ft to operate from. The firm will provide IT companies in the state with seamless connectivity, said Debanjan Dutta, managing director of Webel.

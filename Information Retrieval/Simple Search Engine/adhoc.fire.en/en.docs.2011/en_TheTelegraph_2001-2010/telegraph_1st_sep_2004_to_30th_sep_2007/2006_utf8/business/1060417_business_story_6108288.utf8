 Dunlop to take BSE to court on trade ban

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Ruia: Tough stand

 Calcutta, April 16: Pawan Ruia controlled-Dunlop is planning to move court against Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) for not lifting the ban on trading of its shares. BSE has suspended trading on Dunlop shares since February 2003 due to non-payment of listing fees.

 The shares were last traded on April 15, 2002 and was quoted at Rs 6.60, below the par value of Rs 10.

 Before selling the company, the erstwhile promoter of Dunlop, the Chhabria-owned Jumbo Group, had initiated the process of lifting the suspension. 

 Abiding by the terms of the share purchase agreement on Dunlop with Ruia, the Chhabrias had furnished all the relevant documents before the BSE and even cleared the arrears on account of non-payment of listing fees. These procedures were completed even before the Ruia group bought the entire tyre business of Jumbo in December 2005.

 However, the BSE refused to allow trading on Dunlop shares, saying the company has been referred to the Appellate Authority of Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (AAIFR). The listing committee of the exchange unanimously decided to wait till the AAIFR issued its final order before taking any decision in this regard. 

 ?We are exploring the legal option against the BSE decision. Since trading was suspended due to non-payment, the exchange should now allow trading as listing fees have been paid and all formalities completed,? Ruia told The Telegraph.

 He said the BSE did not discuss the Dunlop case with AAIFR when it decided to bar the company, though the company had already been referred to the appellate authority at that time. By inference, Ruia argued, there was no reason for the BSE to wait for the AAIFR verdict before it lifts the ban on the company. BSE officials declined to comment on the issue.

 Dunlop India has 35,000 retail investors. Originally in the B-1 category, the company?s scrip is now in the Z-group, denoting lack of regulatory compliance by firms.

 The stock was listed on Calcutta, Delhi, Chennai and Ahmedabad bourses along with the BSE.

 When the company approached the other exchanges, they decided to follow the BSE.

 Depository participants, like National Securities Depository Ltd and Central Depository Services (India) Ltd, have also turned down the plea to dematerialise Dunlop stocks, arguing that the BSE must lift suspension on trading before they take any decision in this regard.

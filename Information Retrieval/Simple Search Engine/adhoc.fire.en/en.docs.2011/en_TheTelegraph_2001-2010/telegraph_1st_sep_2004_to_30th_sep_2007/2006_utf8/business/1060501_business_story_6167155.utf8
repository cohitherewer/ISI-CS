 Tea export zone deal after Assembly polls

 Calcutta, April 30: The memorandum of understanding between the Bengal government, Agriculture and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) and Tea Board for the Rs 212.65-crore agri-export zone (AEZ) for tea in the state is expected to be signed after the Assembly elections.

 The agri export zones will be set up with assistance from APEDA, which, in conjunction with various state governments and private agencies, have set up 60 such AEZs in 20 states across the country. Bengal has five AEZs, which are at various stages of development for mangoes, potatoes, litchis, pineapple and vegetables.

 Though the AEZ for tea was sanctioned way back in September 2004 by the steering committee of the ministry of commerce, there were a lot of procedural delays, including the role of various agencies involved in the process. The formal MoU is expected to be signed post elections, said Tea Board chairman Basudeb Banerjee.

 The APEDA had requested for a notification, which is still pending with the director general of foreign trade (DGFT).

 According to industry experts, unlike special economic zones, a AEZ does not comprise a physically defined area, but is an amalgamation of various schemes of the central and state governments for a particular commodity. Though this provides a lot of flexibility and advantages, it takes a bit of time to shape up as a lot of agency roles have to be defined and resolved.

 In the original proposal, the tea AEZ would entail an investment of Rs 212.65 crore, of which Rs 51.77 crore would flow from various central government agencies and Rs 4.45 crore from the state government, with the likely private sector investment placed at Rs 156.42 crore.

 Banerjee said since the Tea Board would be the nodal agency and was the steering body for the tea industry, it would provide part of the initial funding.

 On behalf of the state government, the operating agency would in all likelihood be the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation (WBIDC).

 A lot of the existing schemes and projects of the Tea Board could be brought under the AEZ scheme once it kicks off.

 Upgrading a Darjeeling tea research and development laboratory in Kurseong is among the projects, said Banerjee.

 Other initiatives include rejuvenating and pruning the tea bushes in the state where replantation, requiring an investment of Rs 60-70 lakh, is not always possible, developing geographical indication for Darjeeling tea under the Intellectual Property Rights processes and also genetic engineering initiatives for the Darjeeling aroma possibly through an institute like the Indian Institute of Molecular Biology.

 The proposal had also estimated that the tea AEZ during the first five years would have exports worth Rs 673.75 crore and more than 5,000 farmers are likely to be benefited from this zone.

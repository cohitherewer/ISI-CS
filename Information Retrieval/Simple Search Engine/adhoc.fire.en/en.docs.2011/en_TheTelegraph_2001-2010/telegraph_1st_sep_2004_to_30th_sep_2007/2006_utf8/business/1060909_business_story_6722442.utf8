 Goldman Sachs fined Rs 1 crore

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Sept. 8: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has slapped a penalty of Rs 1 crore on Goldman Sachs Investment (Mauritius) Ltd for issuing participatory notes or off-shore derivative instruments (ODIs) to an overseas corporate body (OCB) Magnus Capital Corporation Ltd (MCCL). 

 Goldman Sachs was charged with violating the declaration/undertaking to furnish fortnightly statement on issue of PNs to Sebi under FII regulations, Sebi adjudicating officer Amit Pradhan said in an order issued here today.

 The FII, registered with Sebi, failed to report the issuance of PNs to MCCL. This was in violation of its earlier declaration that the FII and its affiliates had not issued PNs, Sebi said. Current laws bar OCBs from investing in Indian securities.

 Goldman Sachs will have to pay the fine within 45 days of receipt of the order.

 Explaining the details of the case, the market regulator said according to provisions of Regulation 20 of the FII Regulation, FIIs or their sub-accounts must provide information to the board. This has to be done through two annexures, which an FII has to submit before Sebi. According to Annexure A, an undertaking was to be given by the FII/sub-account stating, We undertake that we/ associates/ clients have not issued/ subscribed/ purchased any of the offshore derivative instruments directly or indirectly to/ from Indian residents/ NRIs/ PIOs/ OCBs.

 Sebi said in compliance with this circular, Goldman Sachs filed a statement which did not contain the clause of the undertaking as prescribed in Annexure A. Later, however, Goldman Sachs gave an undertaking and declaration, which was not true. According to Sebi, Goldman Sachs submitted that it has not entered into any offshore derivatives with Indian residents, NRIs or OCBs.

 From the bare perusal of the undertaking given by the noticee, it is made out that the undertaking was not at all in the format prescribed by Sebi, Pradhan said.

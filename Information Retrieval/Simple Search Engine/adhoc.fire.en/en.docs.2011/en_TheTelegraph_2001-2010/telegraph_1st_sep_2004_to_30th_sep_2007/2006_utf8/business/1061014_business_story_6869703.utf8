 Cairn gets the jitters over pipeline delay

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Oct. 13: Cairn India Ltd, a subsidiary of the Edinburgh-based exploration giant Cairn Energy Plc, is spooked by the thought that its plans to start commercial production from its oil and gas fields in Rajasthan by 2009 could be wrecked if Mangalore Refineries and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL) doesnt lay a pipeline to transport the crude oil by then.

 Cairn is now mulling the possibility of getting involved with MRPL in building the 500-km pipeline, which is designed to transport crude oil generated from the Mangala field in Rajasthan to the Kandla-Mundra ports in the northwestern coast of the country. Any delay on the pipeline front could have a direct bearing on production from the Mangala field.

 In its draft red herring prospectus that was submitted to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) on Thursday, Cairn said it has received no word from MRPL on the progress on its pipeline studies and it was, therefore, examining the possibility of getting involved in the pipeline project even as they examine other mid-stream options.

 The development of the Mangala, Aishwariya, Bhagyam and Shakti fields in the Rajasthan Block is crucial in Cairns current exploration activities in India. While Cairn views these fields as the current principal strategic focus, a sum of Rs 3,960 crore will be spent on developing them. Of this, Rs 2,760 crore will be spent by Cairn India and Rs 240 crore had already been invested.

 We have based our estimated production forecasts on the assumption that the necessary pipeline infrastructure of sufficient capacity will be developed in time for the commencement of crude oil production during 2009 from the Mangala field by the government nominee, currently MRPL, the prospectus said.

 Since the responsibility for the construction of the pipeline was that of the nominee, Cairn said, it has no control over the construction or operation and there is a risk that MRPL may not construct the pipeline in time for the commencement of crude oil production from the Mangala field or may not operate the pipeline successfully once it is constructed.

 In view of our assessment of the lack of progress by MRPL towards construction of the pipeline, it is appropriate for us to investigate the possibility of becoming directly involved in the pipeline or the development of other midstream options to ensure proper integration of the upstream development and midstream facilities, Cairn noted.

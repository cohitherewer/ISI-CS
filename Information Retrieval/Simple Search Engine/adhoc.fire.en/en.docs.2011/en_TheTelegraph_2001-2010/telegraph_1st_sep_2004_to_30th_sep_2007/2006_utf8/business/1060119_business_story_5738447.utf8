 Hydrogen auto fuel blueprint in place

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Jan. 18: The Ratan Tata-led steering groups roadmap for introducing hydrogen as an auto fuel will be forwarded to the cabinet for its approval within the next 15 days, minister for non-conventional energy resources Vilas Muttemar said today. 

 In November, the group had prepared a roadmap to launch one million hydrogen-fuelled vehicles on Indian roads by 2020 and generate 1,000 mw of power through hydrogen-based plants. The plan entails an investment of Rs 25,000 crore. 

 The hydrogen roadmap for green initiative for future transport plans to develop and demonstrate hydrogen-powered engines and duel-cell-based vehicles, which include small two-wheelers, cars, vans and buses, through the different phases of development. 

 The accompanying green initiative for power generation envisages developing and demonstrating hydrogen-powered turbines and fuel-cell-based decentralised power generating systems of 1,000-mw aggregate capacity by 2020. 

 The roadmap has estimated an investment of Rs 25,000 crore for the project. While Rs 1,000 crore will be required for R amp;D, Rs 24,000 crore will be spent on creating the infrastructure for hydrogen production, storage, transportation and distribution.

 It has recommended a strong public-private partnership for implementing the entire hydrogen energy system. 

 Muttemar said his ministry would also focus on 93 large municipal corporations in the country to set up waste-based power plants. 

 He said since technologies for such plants require large capital investments, yield low returns and have higher levels of risk, a scheme with attractive incentives would be unveiled soon.

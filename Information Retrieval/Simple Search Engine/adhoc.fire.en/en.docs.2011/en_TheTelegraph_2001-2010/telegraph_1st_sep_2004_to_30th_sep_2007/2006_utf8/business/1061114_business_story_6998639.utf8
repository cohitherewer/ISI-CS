 Hitachi-GE venture to tap nuke power

 Tokyo, Nov. 13 (Reuters): Japans Hitachi Ltd and US group General Electric Co said on Monday they would set up joint ventures in Japan and the United States to combine their nuclear power operations and capture more contracts. 

 The partnership would help Hitachi, Japans biggest electronics conglomerate, turn its nuclear power business around and help it get more boiling water reactor contracts abroad, the company said. 

 Hitachi president Kazuo Furukawa said the company aimed to win contracts to build at least a third of the 25 nuclear power plants the US Department of Energy aims to have built by 2020. 

 Hitachi, which had sales of 160 billion yen ($1.4 billion) from its nuclear power business in Japan last year, will transfer its 2,000-person nuclear power division to a joint venture in Japan. 

 Hitachi will hold an 80 per cent stake in the company, while GE will hold 20 per cent. 

 GE will own 60 per cent of the venture in the United States, with Hitachi holding 40 per cent, the two companies said. GE has roughly 1,500 employees involved in its $1-billion nuclear power business, GE said. 

 The move comes a month after Frances Areva, the worlds largest maker of nuclear reactors, and Japans Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd said they would cooperate in this sector, while Japans Toshiba Corp completed a $4.2-billion deal to take control of Westinghouse, the US power plant unit of British Nuclear Fuels. We are not doing this in response to the competition, Rudolph Villa, president of GEs nuclear energy in Asia unit, said.

 This partnership is to better meet growing demand. Hitachi is very much experienced in building new plants. 

 GE also is a partner with Hitachi rival Toshiba. GE will not create similar joint ventures with Toshiba, but Toshiba will continue to be a supplier, Villa said. 

 Hitachis deal with GE, to be signed by June 2007, comes as market watchers worry about Hitachis ability to secure overseas contracts, after its faulty turbines caused nuclear power units to close down at Japanese utilities Chubu Electric Power Co and Hokuriku Electric Power Co in the summer. 

 Hitachi expects a group net loss of 55 billion yen for the year to March, after factoring in an expected cost of 38 billion yen fix the turbines, plus cost overruns at its US thermal power plants. 

 Nuclear power has come back into favour on concerns about crude oil price rises among fuel-hungry countries such as the United States and China. 

 GE and Hitachi won a $5.2-billion contract in June to build nuclear facilities starting in 2009 for US power company NRG Energy Inc, in Hitachis first major contract abroad. 

 The two companies have been involved in the building of 63 of the 95 boiling water reactor business now in operation worldwide.

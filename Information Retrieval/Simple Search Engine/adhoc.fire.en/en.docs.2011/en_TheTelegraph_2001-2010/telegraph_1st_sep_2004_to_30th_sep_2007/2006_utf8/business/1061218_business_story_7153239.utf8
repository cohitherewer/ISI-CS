 India, China ink oil pact

 New Delhi, Dec. 17 (PTI): India and China today signed a memorandum of understanding for strategic cooperation in oil exploration and production (E amp;P) activities in third world countries.

 The MoU was signed by petroleum minister Murli Deora and Ma Kai, chairman of National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) of China, in Beijing.

 Deora expects this MoU to give a fillip to joint E amp;P efforts and pave way for the Indian and Chinese oil firms to successfully bid for overseas assets.

 Such cooperation is significant and mutually beneficial, as both countries are facing increasing hydrocarbon requirements to fuel their rapidly expanding economies, an official release said.

 Deora was accompanied by petroleum secretary M.S. Srinivasan, OVL managing director R.S. Butola, joint secretary (refineries) Prabh Das and other government officials.

 Deora is on a visit to Beijing to attend a meeting with energy ministers of other major oil importing countries the US, China, Japan and Korea. 

 Consumer lobby

 The worlds five top oil consumers, including India, have established a formal mechanism to safeguard their interests against spiralling crude prices, which impaired energy security and economic growth.

 The decision was taken at the first-ever conclave of energy ministers of India, China, the US, Japan and South Korea which consume up to 50 per cent of the global oil production here yesterday. 

 Speaking about the decision, Deora asserted that the formation of the group was not a cartel of major oil consuming nations against the oil exporting nations but an arrangement to safeguard the interests of major oil importing nations.

 The five major oil consumers have decided to institutionalise their cooperation, which is a landmark decision, he said.

 This is the first time an energy conference is organised to look at the interest of consumers, he added.

 Apart from Deora, the in-camera meeting was attended by Ma Kai, US secretary of energy Samuel Bodman, Japanese economy, trade and industry minister Amari Akira and South Korean minister of commerce, industry and energy Chung Sye Kyun.

 SkyePharma appoints new CEO

 London, Feb. 6 (Reuters): Drug delivery firm SkyePharma named a new chief executive and chief operating officer on Monday and called on rebel shareholders to drop attempts to install their own candidate on the board.

 The firm named Frank Condella, a former head of European operations at pharmaceutical group Ivax Corp, as its CEO, and Ken Cunningham, a former CEO of British biotechnology group Arakis, as chief operating officer.

 SkyePharma last week defied rebel shareholders led by activist investor North Atlantic Value by appointing Jerry Karabelas as chairman.

 The rebels, who successfully lobbied for the removal of previous chairman and founder Ian Gowrie-Smith, had wanted to install Bob Thian, chairman of laboratory supplies group Whatman, to the post.

 I hope that the appointment of Frank and Ken will prompt recognition amongst shareholders who have called for an EGM that they are the best possible team to lead SkyePharma, Karabelas said in a statement.

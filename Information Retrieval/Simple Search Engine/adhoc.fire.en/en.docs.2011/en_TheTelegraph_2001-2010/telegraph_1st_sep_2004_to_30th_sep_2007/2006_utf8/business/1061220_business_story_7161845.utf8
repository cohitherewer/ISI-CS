 Sinha: Fundraiser

 Mumbai, Dec. 19: Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) plans to raise Rs 1,000-crore in 2007 through an initial public offering (IPO) and an issue to strategic investors to fund its greenfield Bina refinery project that will cost Rs 10,378-crore. 

 The funds would be raised by the joint venture company Bharat Oman Refineries Ltd (BORL) and the size of the IPO fixed only after allotting the shares to the private investors, Ashok Sinha, chairman, BPCL, told newsmen after the annual general meeting. 

 He said the Rs 6,387-crore debt component of the project would be funded by an SBI-led consortium. The remaining project cost comprises equities with BPCL holding 50 per cent and Oman Refineries, strategic investors and shareholders, from the IPO, the rest.

 Sinha said that the company has already invested Rs 3,000-crore in the project, which will start from end-2009.

 The company, however, will not do the IPO in a haste as it does not want to mobilise funds in excess of requirements. It has given itself a year for the IPO.

 The six-million tonnes refinery will produce Euro IV compliant products. 

 BPCLs stake after the IPO will be 50 per cent, Oman Refineries two per cent and the public and institutional investors the rest 48 per cent.

 Sinha said company has already brought reactors from Chinese companies. 

 The refining capacity of the company will be 30 mt after the Bina refinery goes on stream and expansion work is over at the Kochi refinery.

 The 1000-km pipeline from Bina to Vadinar, that between Mumbai and Delhi and a smaller one from Kota to the Mumbai-Delhi pipeline will also be completed soon.

 Sinha said after the Bina refinery, the company will explore the possibility of a refinery in Uttar Pradesh. 

 BPCL is also focussed on retailing non-fuel products from its 300 In amp; Out Convenience Stores 

 Senior officials said that the company was in negotiations with retailers like Pantaloon and Trent to look after the logistics for the stores. Moreover, BPCL is also planning to offer other services like travel bookings.

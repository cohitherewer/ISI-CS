 Ispat to hike capacity to 5 mt in two years

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 29: Ispat Industries plans to scale up its steel-making capacity to about 5 million tonnes in the next two years.

 The Pramod and Vinod Mittal-controlled company, with a plant at Dolvi near Mumbai, has a 3-million-tonne capacity. This would go up to 3.6 million tonnes through a de-bottlenecking exercise in the next few months.

 Ispat chairman P.K. Mittal said the company would commission another electric arc furnace to hike capacity.

 This would increase Ispats installed capacity to 4.8 million tonnes.

 However, it may not be possible for the company to reach that level of production without putting in place the necessary forward and backward integration.

 It is now working on the details of the plants and machinery required for processing the steel and also the raw material linkage to produce it. Investment in the entire project is also being worked out.

 As a step towards that, Ispat is planning to set up a pellet plant on the east coast.

 Speaking on the sidelines of the annual general meeting of the company in the city today, Mittal, younger brother of steel baron Laxmi Niwas Mittal, said the pellet plant would have a 3-million-tonne capacity.

 It would be located in Vishakhapatnam to take advantage of the port facility. The investment in the project could be Rs 800 crore and completed within 30 months from the zero date.

 In the absence of any captive mines, pelletisation helps reign in the cost of production.

 To make pellets, which go into steel making, ore fines are used instead of lumps, which are costlier among the two.

 Ispat will bring pellets from there to its plant near Mumbai through coastal ships or rail.

 Ispat group, part of Global Steel, which has a 14 mt capacity worldwide, will take a partner for the pellet plant.

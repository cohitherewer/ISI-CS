 New Delhi, July 11: Domestic car sales accelerated by 24.5 per cent in June, fuelled by higher demand for vehicles from Maruti Udyog, Hyundai and Tata Motors. Motorcycles also continued their strong run with a 26.9 per cent rise in sales.

 According to the figures released by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM), 80,283 cars were sold in June compared with 64,470 in the same month a year ago.

 SIAM figures also revealed that sales were up for seven of the 11 car manufacturers. Those that recorded a slump in sales included Honda Siel, Toyota Kirloskar Motors, Hindustan Motors and DaimlerChrysler.

 Maruti recorded a 13 per cent rise in sales at 37,704 while Hyundai sold 16,989 cars, up 58.3 per cent. The sales of Tata Motors were up 30.2 per cent at 15,156 units.

 Growth in domestic passenger car sales was propelled by special schemes offered by manufacturers as well as fears of a probable price rise in the coming months, analysts said.

 Car sales in the first quarter of this fiscal were up 23.7 per cent at 2,43,633 units against 1,96,921 in the April-June period last year.

 Two-wheeler sales in the April-June period were up 18.5 per cent at 19,06,275 vehicles against 16,08,657 in the same period last year.

 Bike sales in the first quarter of this fiscal were up 22.7 per cent at 16,08,820 vehicles against 13,10,488 in the corresponding period last year.

 Motorcycle sales were up at 5,27,434 units in June against 4,15,598 in the corresponding month last year.

 While Hero Honda and Bajaj Auto witnessed a healthy demand, others like TVS Motors, Yamaha and Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India also posted higher sales, SIAM said.

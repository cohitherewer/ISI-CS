 Allied ICD depot in Durgapur

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 4: Allied ICD Services Ltd has set up the first inland container depot at Durgapur. The project was sanctioned by the Union ministry of commerce and industry.

 The depot, spread over six acres, would be able to keep 2,000 20 ft long containers at a time.

 Being located on the National Highway 2, it would be useful for exporters in the Durgapur-Asansol region.

 The depot will also house a customs office with a full-time team for fast clearance of goods.

 Exporters would no longer have to stand in a long queue at the port, resulting in faster loading on the ship and lower cost.

 Calcutta Port officials said the depot would reduce congestion within the port area. Our endeavour has been to reduce non-port operations within the port area, the official added.

 The company is planning to expand the operations of the depot.

 Two faces of foreign funds

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, July 24: Fund flows from abroad have shown a mixed trend this fiscal with foreign direct investment on the up and foreign institutional investors (FIIs) beating a retreat from bourses, according to the RBI.

 In its report, Macroeconomic and Monetary Developments-First Quarter Review 2006-07, the RBI said the weakness in domestic equities was in line with the trends in international markets. 

 The stock market witnessed a correction beginning from May 11, mainly due to net sales by FIIs, fears of rising global interest rates, sharp fall in metal prices and fears of higher domestic inflation amidst weak trends in major international equity markets, the report said.

 However, mutual funds made net investments of Rs 8,311 crore in the fiscal (till July 14), substantially higher than the Rs 2,231 crore of net investments a year ago. 

 According to data from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), FIIs invested Rs 522 crore in April, but turned net sellers in May to the extent of Rs 7,354 crore. 

 Though the FIIs invested Rs 480 crore in June, they remained net sellers by Rs 6,127 crore in the first quarter compared with Rs 7,366 crore of net purchases a year ago.

 FDI, on the other hand, in April and May was Rs 1,199 crore against Rs 922 crore a year ago.

 In addition to higher FDI, the report said net inflows under various non-resident deposit schemes in April and May were $816 million against outflows a year ago, reflecting higher interest rates.

 Mumbai, Sept. 18: Suzlon Energy Limited has bagged a Rs 1,190-crore order from the US-based John Deere Wind Energy to supply 247 mw of wind turbine capacity. With this order, John Deere nearly doubles its capacity from Suzlon turbines, crossing 500 mw in just two years.

 The order, comprising 30 units of the S64-1.25 mw turbine and 100 units of the S88-2.1 mw turbine, will be delivered in 2007. 

 We are confident that our investment in the US, along with our customer-focused approach, has contributed to repeat orders, said Tulsi R. Tanti, CMD of Suzlon Energy. Suzlon is honoured to continue its relationship with John Deere, he added.

 This is the third repeat order from the same client. Suzlons relationship with John Deere began in 2003 with its investment in several Minnesota wind power projects and quickly expanding to Texas and recently to Missouri. 

 John Deere had placed an order for 238 mw of capacity in early 2006. With this order, John Deere will have a Suzlon wind turbine portfolio exceeding 530 mw in capacity. 

 Suzlons total order book is seen at Rs 5,777 crore. The companys US order book is at 727 mw and valued at Rs 3,500 crore. Its Euro order book is 61 mw, valued at Rs 345 crore; China order book 140 mw, valued at Rs 486 crore; and Australia order book 95 mw, valued at Rs 646 crore. 

 Andris Cukurs, CEO of Suzlon Wind Energy Corporation, said, We view this latest agreement as a reaffirmation of our belief and investment in the US market, and our manufacturing strategy. John Deeres commitment to purchasing these turbines further confirms our long-term strategy to focus on partnerships and production capabilities. 

 In May, Suzlon had announced plans to raise Rs 2,250 crore through foreign currency convertible bonds (FCCB). The company has incurred a debt after the takeover of Belgium-based Hansen Transmission. It plans to raise Rs 5,000 crore to repay the debt and expand capacity of domestic manufacturing facilities. Suzlon is also looking at ADRs / GDRs to raise the balance amount.

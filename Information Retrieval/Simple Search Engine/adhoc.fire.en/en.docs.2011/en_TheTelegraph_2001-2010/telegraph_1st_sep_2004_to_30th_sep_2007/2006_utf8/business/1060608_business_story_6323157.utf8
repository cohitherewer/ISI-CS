 Coal supply hits CESC Haldia plan

 SAMBIT SAHA

 INPUT crunch 

 Calcutta, June 7: CESC has run into rough weather with its proposed Rs 8,000-crore thermal power project in Haldia over uncertainty in coal supply.

 The RPG Enterprise company applied for coal blocks six months ago but is still to get any response from the Centre.

 CESC also took up the issue with the Bengal government so that it could push the case at the Centre where the Left is a key ally of the United Progressive Alliance.

 A senior state government official had written to the Centre to expedite the process. However, nothing has materialised till now.

 The state government has identified the land for the 2,000-mega watt project in the port town, and CESC has already made an initial payment.

 Unless the coal block is allotted, we cannot go ahead with the project, said Sumantra Banerjee, managing director of CESC.

 The company is eyeing coal blocks having reserves of 700 million tonne for its projects.

 CESC has also signed a MoU with the Jharkhand government to generate 2,000 mw power.

 Normally 140 million tonne coal reserves is required to run a 1,000 mw plant for 30 years. The mining leases are generally offered for this period.

 CESC obtains 50 per cent of its requirement from captive blocks in Ranigunj in the Asansol. The rest is secured through established coal linkages.

 The companys coal requirement would increase as the third unit of Budge Budge with a 250-mw capacity is coming up.

 CESC had applied for coal mining blocks for the Bengal plants way back in 2003. We have got nothing so far, Banerjee said.

 CESC, which has the licence to supply power in Calcutta, is expected to wheel 700-800 mw from generating stations outside the city by 2015.

 Due to strict environment norms and paucity of idle land, the company has to expand outside its existing power generating facilities.

 Haldia is an ideal location in this regard.

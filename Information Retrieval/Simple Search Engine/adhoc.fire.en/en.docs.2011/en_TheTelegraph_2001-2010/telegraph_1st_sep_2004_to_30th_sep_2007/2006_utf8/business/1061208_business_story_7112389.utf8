 Open sky to handle air traffic

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 7: The minister for civil aviation today informed Parliament that a limited open sky policy has been declared to handle additional traffic at airports during the peak winter season.

 To take care of the additional traffic demand and heavy congestion during peak winter season, a limited open sky policy has been declared for the period between December 15 to January 31, said civil aviation minister Praful Patel.

 The minister added that long term solutions are being undertaken by the government to deal with heavy traffic congestion at Delhi and Mumbai airports during peak hours.

 Under the limited open sky policy all designated foreign airlines are permitted to mount as many services as they wish to their available points of call, said Patel. 

 Besides they are also permitted to upgrade equipment at their discretion on existing frequencies between November 15 and February 28.

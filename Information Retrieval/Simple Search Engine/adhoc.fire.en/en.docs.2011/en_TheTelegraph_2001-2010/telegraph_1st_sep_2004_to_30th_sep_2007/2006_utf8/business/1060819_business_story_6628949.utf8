 Fresh bid to win over Asean

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 18: India today made a fresh effort to revive talks on a free trade pact with Asean through a new proposal that covers tariff rebates on over 90 per cent imports from the 10-member trading bloc, even as a panel chaired by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh gave the go-ahead to carry the talks forward.

 The trade and economic relations committee (TERC), chaired by Singh, gave the green signal this evening to take negotiations forward, signalling New Delhis willingness to move ahead in concluding the free trade agreement by the end of this year.

 Commerce minister Kamal Nath will participate in a ministerial-level meeting in Kuala Lumpur next week to accelerate the slow moving Indo-Asean FTA talks.

 The TERC nod came even as senior commerce ministry officials presented a new offer in Kuala Lumpur early today to kick-start the negotiations.

 Earlier, we had offered tariff reductions for 69 per cent of the items and now it has been raised to 94.6 per cent, G.K. Pillai, special secretary, ministry of commerce and industry, said in Kuala Lumpur after talking to Asean officials.

 He said India has offered to substantially reduce import duty on some highly sensitive products that were of significant export interest to certain Asean members.

 Duties on refined palm oil was reduced from 90 per cent to 60 per cent, on crude palm oil from 80 per cent to 50 per cent, on black tea from 100 per cent to 50 per cent and on pepper from 70 per cent to 50 per cent.

 India said its revised offer provided preferential market access for 95 per cent to 100 per cent of imports from seven Asean members and for 85 per cent or more for the other three members.

 However, the timeframe that India has drawn up to scale down these duties is considered too long by Malaysia, which was looking for immediate results.

 However, Asean is yet to table details of its liberalisation proposal under the Indo-Asean FTA. It has also not given us any country-wise offer list, Pillai said.

 He hoped that this would be done as soon as possible. If our offers today do not kick-start the FTA, we dont know what will, Pillai said.

 With the new offer, India has trimmed down its list of items that it wants excluded from the pact to 560 goods covering only 5.4 per cent of Aseans exports.

 India is hesitant to bring down tariffs on these sensitive commodities as it could hit domestic farmers who are dependent on these crops as a source of livelihood. This would have an adverse political fallout as all free trade agreements have come in for criticism as they have the potential to expose Indian industry and agriculture to competition from cheap foreign goods.

 The FTA with Sri Lanka, for instance, has been criticised as it has resulted in inferior quality tea making its way to the Indian market for re-export. Apart from affecting domestic gardens, it has also damaged the countrys brand image globally.

 India had trimmed its exclusion list to 850 items from 1,440 last year. Asean had protested that India had too many items on the list.

 Pillai said, The Asean countries welcomed Indias forward movement. However, some countries wanted India to be more liberal in tariff cuts. Malaysia, a major palm oil producer, wanted further tariff cuts on palm oil against the 50 per cent India has proposed.

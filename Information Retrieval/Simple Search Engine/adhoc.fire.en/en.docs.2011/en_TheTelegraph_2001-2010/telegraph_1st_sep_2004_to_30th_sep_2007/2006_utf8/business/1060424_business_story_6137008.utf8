 Modicare revamps product range

 URVASHI KAUL

 Makeover

 New Delhi, April 23: Direct sales company Modicare Ltd is revamping and rebranding its entire personal, skin and home care products. 

 Modicare, a KK Modi Group firm, is also looking at introducing new products in these categories through a series of launches lined up during this year. 

 This industry is fast moving. We want to be in sync with the market trends and that is why we are looking at diversifying the range of Modicare products, said Hemant Singh, chief operating officer of Modicare Ltd.

 The company aims to retain its market share and attract new customers by diversifying offerings, he added. 

 We are trying to identify gaps in our present range of products, and doing extensive research and development on the new product range at the moment, said Singh. 

 The companys personal and skin care range comprises UV moisturisers, scrubs, cleansers, toners, body, oral, skin and hair care products and deodorants. 

 While existing products like shampoos will have newer ingredients added to them, soaps and body wash will be repackaged and upgraded. 

 The products the brand would launch this year include hair nourisher (a hair styling product), fairness and blemish removing cream and new lipstick and nail paint shades. 

 With the launch of the fairness cream, the company would enter the speciality skin care segment.

 The company also intends to step into the fragrance market by introducing five perfumes, three for women and two for men. 

 The perfumes would come at a competitive price, under Rs 1000, said Singh. They are expected to be launched by July-August this year. 

 The personal, home and skin care products, which are the biggest categories for Modicare, constitute about 37 per cent, 12 per cent and 10 per cent of its business respectively.

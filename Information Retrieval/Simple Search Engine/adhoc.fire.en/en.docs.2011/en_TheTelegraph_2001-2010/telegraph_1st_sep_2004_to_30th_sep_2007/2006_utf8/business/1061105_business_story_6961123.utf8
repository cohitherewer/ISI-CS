 VAT revenue grows 32%

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Nov. 4: States that have implemented value-added tax (VAT) have recorded a 32 per cent growth in collection to Rs 34,019.46 crore during the first half of this fiscal compared with the corresponding previous period.

 In terms of tax collection on all items, including non-VAT, the tax revenue growth of these states stood at Rs 54,616.57 crore during the first six months of the current fiscal, up 27.3 per cent over Rs 42,913.60 crore recorded in the same period last year, VAT panel chairman Asim Dasgupta told reporters.

 Dasgupta attributed the buoyancy in tax revenue collections to the inherent nature of VAT and growing consciousness of states to plug leakages in tax collection.

 So far, all states and Union territories except Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh and Pondicherry have implemented VAT.

 While, Tamil Nadu has shown its intention to implement VAT from January next year, Pondicherry is expected to decide on the issue soon, he said, adding that Uttar Pradesh may take a few more months to switch over to the new tax regime.

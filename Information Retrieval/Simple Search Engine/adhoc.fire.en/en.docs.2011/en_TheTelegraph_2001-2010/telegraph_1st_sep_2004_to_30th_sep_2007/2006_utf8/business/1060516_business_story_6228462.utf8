 Hummer H1 rides into sunset

 Washington, May 15 (AFP): Faced with fewer buyers and soaring oil prices, General Motors Corp has decided after a 14-year run to drive its gargantuan Hummer Alpha 4x4 into the sunset and shutter its production.

 GM announced on Friday that production of the giant 4x4, known as the H1, based on a vehicle designed for the US army, would cease in June.

 The US automaker cited a decline in high-end customers willing to shell out up to $150,000 for the huge four-door Hummer, which weighs up to 3.7 tonnes, packs a 6.6-litre engine and has a 7.8-metre turning circle.

 The company, however, will continue to produce and sell its smaller range of Hummers, which are also more fuel-efficient.

 Since 1999, the Hummer Alpha has been constructed and marketed in a collaboration between General Motors and AM General Llc, which constructs the military model.

 Unfortunately, in recent years, the production and actual retail sale of the Hummer H1 have fallen to a level between 200 and 300 vehicles per year, James Armour, the president and chief executive officer of AM General, said on Friday while announcing the H1s official retirement from Americas highways.

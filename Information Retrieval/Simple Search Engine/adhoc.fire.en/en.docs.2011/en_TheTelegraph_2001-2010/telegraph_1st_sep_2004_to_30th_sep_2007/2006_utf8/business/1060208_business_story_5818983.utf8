 Loss-making firm doles out loans

 SAUMITRA DASGUPTA

 Mumbai, Feb. 6: Reliance Natural Resources Ltd (RNRL) ? which has been at the centre of a raging battle between the Ambani brothers ? is not a new company at all as one might have been led to believe. It is actually a five-year-old company with a share capital of Rs 5 lakh, saddled with a loss of almost Rs 3 crore, and has given out interest-free loans worth over Rs 211 crore! 

 The company is something of a chameleon: it has altered its name six times in five years. It was originally incorporated on March 24, 2000 and carried the moniker Reliance Platforms Communica-tions.com. It then morphed into a Reliance Wattage Private Ltd. On July 25, 2005 ? a week after the Ambani brothers reached a settlement ? the company changed from a private limited company to a public limited company and became known as Reliance Wattage Ltd.

 But the rechristening didnt stop there: on August 3, it changed its name to Reliance Fuel Management Ltd. A week later, it became known as Global Fuel Management Services Ltd, which was the name that everyone knew it by when the demerger details first came out last November. But two months later ? on January 9 this year ? it was renamed Reliance Natural Resources Ltd.

 RNRL has been dragged into controversy after it signed a gas supply agreement with Mukesh Ambani-run Reliance Industries Ltd. The Anil camp had objected to significant deviations in the agreement which had been reached with an entity that had Mukeshs men. The three-member board of directors had two people representing the Mukesh side ? Sandeep Tandon and L.V. Merchant, while J.P. Chalasani belonged to the Anil camp. Chalasani had objected to the changes in the gas supply agreement which was signed on January 12.

 But the most intriguing aspect is the interest-free, unsecured loans and advances that the company has made. The biggest chunk of Rs 199.69 crore has been made to Reliance Ventures Ltd ? an investment company within the Mukesh fold. RNRLs annual report for the period April 1 to December 31, 2005 (a copy of which is now available with The Telegraph) shows under Schedule 4 that this advance is recoverable in cash or in kind. It is not clear whether in kind means gas under the deal signed with Reliance Industries. Reliance Ventures is a subsidiary of Reliance Industries.

 The other loan that the company has given out is to Reliance Patalganga Power Ltd ? an Anil-controlled company that is due to establish a 447 mw power project. This is for a much smaller amount: Rs 12.29 crore.

 RNRL had an income of just Rs 8688 in the nine months to December 31, 2005 but its expenditure totalled Rs 4.38 crore. Depreciation accounted for Rs 3.99 crore but it had also incurred expenditure of Rs 8.03 lakh on helicopter hiring and Rs 26.16 lakh on vehicle expenses, which may seem downright profligate.

 The losses look even more stark: the net loss has ballooned from Rs 8,558 during the year ended March 31, 2005 to Rs 2.91 crore during the nine-months ended December 31 the same year. 

 RNRL has a share capital of Rs 5 lakh that has been provided by Reliance Industries. The share capital will swell to Rs 611.56 crore after the demerger. Once the new shares are allotted (as they have now been), the current share capital of Rs 5 lakh shall stand cancelled and the company shall cease to be the subsidiary of RIL, says the annual report of the company.

 Move to clear air on Mittal buyout bid

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 28: Luxembourgs foreign trade minister Jeannot Krecke today said the countrys new takeover law, likely to be introduced in May, was not aimed at scuttling L.N. Mittals bid to acquire Arcelor.

 The government will have no role in impeding the bid. We intend to introduce the takeover bill in May to include the best international practices in our economy, Krecke said. He made it clear that the government did not intend to meddle with Mittals bid.

 The Luxembourg government, which owns a 5.6 per cent stake in Arcelor, has been opposing Mittals $23-billion unsolicited bid.

 Krecke said, The bill is intended to secure the interests of shareholders ? both majority and minority.

 The bill, which Luxembourg will bring in May, would have to be brought in by 25 EU nations too, he added. Separate bills would be introduced by the EU nations to air their views on takeovers.

 Mittal had met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on the eve of French President Jacques Chiracs visit to the capital and apprised him of the issue. Singh had then discussed the matter with Chirac. Chirac had denied that Mittals attempt was being blocked on account of racism.

 Commerce minister Kamal Nath had earlier taken up the issue with EU trade commissioner Peter Mandelson. Nath had stated that attempts to thwart the bid violated EUs commitment to the WTO accord, which provides for national treatment to cross-border investment.

 The bid has sparked objections from the governments of France, Luxembourg and Spain. Labour unions, who are worried about job losses, have also protested. 

 Mittal, however, has said no worker would lose job and claimed none of his operations in other countries have caused retrenchment.

 Arcelor CEO Guy Dolle has also questioned Mittals track record and said the takeover bid was not in the interest of Arcelor. The takeover, if successful, would create a steel company with an output three times higher than its three nearest rivals combined.

 HPL power saver

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Bhowmik: New trail

 Calcutta, Nov. 24: Haldia Petrochemicals Ltd (HPL) is planning a coal-fired captive power plant to reduce cost.

 Swapan Bhowmik, managing director of the company, said the unit would be of 90 megawatt (mw) capacity and help the company save Rs 200 crore annually.

 HPL draws power from the plant of HPL Cogeneration, a joint venture with Larsen amp; Toubro, which runs on naphtha.

 The estimated cost of the new unit is around Rs 360-400 crore, but Bhowmik declined to comment on the investment. He said a study would be done to determine the amount. 

 The company will need 90 mw, up from 70-80 mw now, when its expansion plan to raise capacity by 28 per cent is over in March 2008.

 The cost of power using naphtha has shot up with the flare-up in the price of crude, with naphtha prices jumping to $508 a tonne from $250 in just two years.

 It is not clear whether HPL will continue to use the power produced from naphtha. Bhowmik said it was too premature to comment. 

 HPL Cogeneration is a 51:49 joint venture between L amp;T and HPL, with a capacity to produce 116 mw. In 2005-06, the company had a profit after tax of Rs 97.07 crore on revenues of Rs 171.37 crore.

 Besides power, the plant also sells steam to HPL. HPL Cogeneration Ltd runs the plant on a build-operate and own basis.

 If the new power plant is set up, HPL Cogeneration may supply just steam to HPL and offer power only in emergency. However, it is to be seen if L amp;T agrees to this deal.

 In the meantime, the HPL board approved the preparation of a detailed feasibility study for another expansion plan. The study would be ready in a year, Bhowmik said.

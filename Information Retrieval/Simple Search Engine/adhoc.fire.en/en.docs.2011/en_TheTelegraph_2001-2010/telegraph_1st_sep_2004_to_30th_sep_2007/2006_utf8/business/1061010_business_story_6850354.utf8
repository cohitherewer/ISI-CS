 Oct. 9: US Exim Bank has agreed to extend guarantee for a $6.2-billion loan to finance Air-Indias fleet expansion plan. The national carrier plans to replenish its fleet with 68 new aircraft from Boeing.

 The first of the lot will be delivered next month to its low cost carrier, Air-India Express.

 Air-India Express will start six flights a week from Chennai to Singapore and Kuala Lumpur, subject to regulatory approval, an Air-India spokesperson said.

 The total cost of buying new aircraft will be $7.2 billion. While 85 per cent of the amount will be guaranteed by US Exim Bank, Air-India will meet the remaining 15 per cent of the cost of acquisition through commercial loans from State Bank of India and ICICI Bank.

 ABN Amro is the lead financier for the loan guaranteed by US Exim Bank. While the US Exim Bank-guranteed loan would be at sub-libor rates, the commercial borrowings would be at above-libor rates.

 This clearance, however, entails a final commitment of $1.4 billion for 17 aircraft and engines to be delivered from November this year to December 2007.

 This guarantee represents one of the largest transactions in the aviation industry supported by the US Exim Bank.

 Of the 68 aircraft to be acquired from Boeing, 18 would be 737-800 for Air-India Express, now operating mainly to the Gulf region, fifteen 777 300 ER (extended range), eight 777 LR (long range) and twenty-seven 777 for medium range.

 With the acquisition of the new aircraft, Air-India proposes to start flights to new destinations, including Washington, Houston, Beijing, San Francisco, Taipei, Melbourne and Sydney.

 Seven of the Boeing 777 aircraft three 777 LR and four 777 ER would be delivered during February-June 2007, enabling Air-India to start non-stop flights to United States and Australia.

 Calcutta, Nov. 25: Union commerce minister Kamal Nath today allayed fears that the proposed tax concessions to special economic zones will entail a revenue loss to the national exchequer. 

 North Block recently voiced the apprehension that tax breaks to SEZs will lead to a Rs 1,00,000-crore loss by 2009-10.

 Describing finance ministrys estimate as a notional method of calculation, Nath emphasised that besides creating huge job opportunities, SEZs will generate an export income of Rs 11,40,000 crore in the same period. 

 Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of a function at Manikanchan, the countrys first sector-specific SEZ for gems and jewellery, Nath said, The SEZ act is now in place. They (the finance ministry) should have told this before.

 Minister of state for finance S. S. Palanimanickam told Parliament on Friday that the exchequer would lose an estimated revenue of Rs 1,02,621 crore by 2009-10 because of several tax concessions given to companies operating in SEZs.

 Palanimanickam added that the loss of revenue on account of direct taxes was estimated to be Rs 53,740 crore and on account of indirect taxes Rs 48,881 crore.

 Yeh haqiquat nehi hai (T his is not true), Nath said when asked about the finance ministrys apprehension. This fear has no basis. Export income as of now is free from tax till 2009-10 and SEZs are meant for 100 per cent exports. Besides, SEZs will generate additional employment and income, he added.

 Nath, however, denied that there was any dispute between the commerce and finance ministries on the issue.

 Under the SEZ act, exporters need not pay direct taxes till 2009-10. Moreover, they are given significant concessions on customs and excise while purchasing capital goods from other units within as well as outside the country.

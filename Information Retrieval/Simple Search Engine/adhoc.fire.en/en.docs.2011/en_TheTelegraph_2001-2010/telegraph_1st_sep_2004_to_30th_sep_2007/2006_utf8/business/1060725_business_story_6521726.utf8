 Mumbai, July 24: TCS, the country?s largest software company, today signed a joint venture agreement with the Chinese government to establish the first industrial scale software company in that country. 

 TCS is forming the venture with three Chinese entities ? Beijing Zhingguancun Software Park and Development, Uniware Co and the Tianjin Huayaun Software Area Construction and Development Co. 

 TCS will be the majority equity shareholder with an initial stake of 72.22 per cent while the three Chinese entities will together have a 27.78 per cent stake. At a later stage, Microsoft will join in and will have close to 10 per cent stake.

 The venture will increase TCS?s visibility in China and enable it to bid for large local projects.

 ?After Microsoft joins in, our stake will come down to 65 per cent and the three Chinese entities will together have 25 per cent. We will be applying for a business licence tomorrow and will start operations from September, 2006,? S. Ramadorai, CEO and managing director of TCS, said here today.

 TCS will invest close to $15 million in the entity. 

 ?We will start with an investment of $12.6 million in the first year and will take it all the way up to $14.7 million,? S. Mahalingam, CFO of TCS, said. The project will be located in Beijing?s Zhingguancun Software Park . 

 ?We are looking at building a long-term business presence in the country. By the fourth year, we hope to have close to 5,000 people in this particular entity,? Ramadorai added.

 Most of the people hired will be locals and that is where TCS hopes to enlist the help of the Chinese entities. ?They will help us in recruiting from local universities as they have a better understanding of the local market,? Ramadorai said. The local partners will also help TCS with infrastructure and government liaison work while Microsoft will bring in technology. 

 TCS already has a 100 per cent subsidiary in China and around 500 people are employed there. The company is looking at merging this subsidiary with the new joint venture within a year. 

 ?The wholly owned subsidiary is still treated as a foreign enterprise in China. As a result, there are quite a few restrictions on it. This model (the JV) will give us more access,? Ramadorai said. The company will be bidding more for opportunities in the banking, telecom, financial services and the regulatory services space. 

 Although the emphasis is on the domestic market, some export-oriented projects could be expected. However, the company refused to spell out the exact ratio. 

 ?We could also be looking at a listing,? Mahalingam said without giving further details.

 Meanwhile, TCS has bagged a $33-million contract from Saudi Telecom to provide end-to-end billing and customer care solutions over an 18-month period.

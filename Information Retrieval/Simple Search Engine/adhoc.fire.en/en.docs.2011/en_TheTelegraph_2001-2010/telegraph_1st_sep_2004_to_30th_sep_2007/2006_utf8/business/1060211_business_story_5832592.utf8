 TCS gets rating pat from Moodys

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Feb. 10: Moodys Investors Service has assigned an A3 issuer rating and a Baa1 indicative foreign currency debt rating to Tata Consultancy Services (TCS). This is the first time that Moodys has rated the company. Baa1 is the rating that would be assigned to any foreign currency bonds sold under foreign law. 

 However, at present, Moodys has not assigned this rating to a specific debt issue.

 The ratings outlook was stable, reflecting the expectation that TCS would continue to execute its business model and maintain competitiveness against global peers, while preserving its sound financial profile with a net cash position.

 As TCS participates in large and complex long-term business engagement in the international market, we felt there is a strong need for an external assessment of our inherent financial strength. We are delighted that Moodys has given TCS the highest rating for a private sector firm in the country, company CFO S. Mahalingam said. 

 Moodys said the companys four credit strengths include a dominant domestic market position and a major global presence as well as a favourable long-term IT industry trend, which involves off-shoring and BPO.

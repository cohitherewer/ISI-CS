 Refined response to crude fall

 S.P.S PANNU 

 New Delhi, Sept. 21: The national oil companies are cautiously exuberant over the fall in the Indian basket of crude oil in the international markets to $57.82 per barrel yesterday from a peak of $75.2 on August 8.

 The companies, however, are still keeping their fingers crossed on the downtrend as crude prices are volatile and prone to rapid changes.

 The average price of the Indian basket of crude is $62.54 per barrel this month, which is $8 less than $70.84 in August, according to official sources.

 A senior official of Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) said the company was playing a waiting game since it was still too early to say whether prices will rise or fall later. The financial position of the oil companies will improve only if the current trend continues over a longer period.

 The official said the stock of crude with the companies the companies have reserves of 45 days was bought when crude prices were high.

 The companies would benefit if prices remained low when stocks get replenished.

 The Indian basket is a mix of cheap Gulf crude and the expensive Brent. The former comprises 55 per cent of the basket.

 The fall in prices relieves the government of the pressure to bail out the companies by raising prices of oil products and risking a political backlash. 

 The government has earlier failed to live up to its assertions on prices going up if the price of the Indian basket crosses $70 per barrel.

 Oil companies have little room for manoeuvre if crude prices go up globally. Not only do they meet 70 per cent of their requirements through imports but also crude is the principal ingredient in refining, comprising 90 per cent of the cost of production.

 The oil companies are also losing money on the sale of kerosene and LPG.

 The government will issue the companies interest bearing bonds worth Rs 28,000 crore as partial compensation. These are IOU slips from the government, which the companies can encash in the market. The bonds are also part of the balance sheets of the companies and have prevented them from plunging into the red. 

 Upstream oil companies ONGC and OIL and gas firm GAIL have also been asked to share the burden of the subsidy on the cooking fuels. They are expected to shell out Rs 24,000 crore during the current fiscal. 

 ONGC chairman R.S. Sharma is also relieved at the falling prices. ONGC does not benefit when prices rise and ends up in compensating the oil marketing companies for their losses.

 Sharma said as much as 90 per cent of the hike in crude prices that ONGC was supposed to get has been passed on to the downstream companies.

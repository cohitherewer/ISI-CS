 Kotler caution note on brand blogs

 Kotler: Tips to excel

 Mumbai, July 21: He is not called the worlds foremost expert on the strategic practice of marketing for nothing.

 Immaculately turned out in a dark suit and a navy blue shirt, the 75-year-old clean-shaven SC Johnson amp; Son distinguished professor of international marketing at the Northwestern University Kellogg School of Management, Dr Philip Kotler did not mince words today in expressing his feelings towards blogging as a media for advertising.

 Internet is a great medium for the marketers, he said, but immediately put in a word of caution. There has to be some form of monitoring when it comes to blogs.

 Why? Kotler says there are two implications: first, someone can just write on and on about a brand and then it could be a case of brand overkill; second, in a more likely scenario, bloggers can trash a brand.

 Although Kotler did not spell out what form of monitoring was required, he urged companies to keep a watch on what was being written about their brands.

 The Internet is a great medium, but marketers are not yet able to use it to its full extent, he said during his almost one-and-a-half hour interaction with the media here.

 The writer of the most authoritative textbook on marketing called Marketing Management, which is now in its 12th edition, Kotler is on a whirlwind lecture tour of the country visiting Chennai, Bangalore and Mumbai.

 The management strategy guru said the IT sector in India was the most prominent vertical and has the potential to produce some of the most global brands. But, I will not name the company, he said with a twinkle in his eyes and a smile at the many cameraphones and cameras clicking at him.

 A consultant to US majors like IBM, Bank Of America, GE and Motorola, Kotler had a word or two for Indian businesses too. 

 The Indian retail sector has a huge potential of growth. Laws have kept some retailers out at the moment. But you (the market) are growing. You will get more hypermarkets, shopping malls and may be a Wal-Mart. The prices are going to get lower, and there will be larger choice. There will be some effect on the Mom and Pop shops. The ones which have maintained a personal relationship with their clients will survive, the others will perish, he said adding that allowing large retailers to come into any market has always been beneficial to the market. 

 Garments, fabrics, handicrafts and chips are some of the key industries that India should focus on when it comes to modern trade, he said. By sarees I dont mean that you export the saree as it is; have an Italian designer to design a new form of it and then put it out in the export market, he added. 

 The author of textbooks that have sold more than 3 million copies in 20 languages and are read as the marketing gospel in 58 countries, Kotler cleverly injected his answers to the media with preludes to his future projects like an article soon to be published in the Harvard Business Review on ending the war between Marketing and Sales. The article speaks about how marketing and sales are constantly at war at each other, which ends up in a loss for both, he said, adding that marketing and sales have to co-exist.

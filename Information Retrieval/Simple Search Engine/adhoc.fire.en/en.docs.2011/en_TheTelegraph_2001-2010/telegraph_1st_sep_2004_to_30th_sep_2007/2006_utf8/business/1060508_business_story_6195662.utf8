 Calcutta, May 7: State Bank of Hyderabad, the largest associate bank in the State Bank of India group, is planning an initial public offering (IPO) by the second week of August.

 The timing of the initial public offering (IPO), however, depends on whether the Union cabinet clears the proposed amendments to the State Bank of India (Subsidiary Bank ) Act, 1959, in the forthcoming monsoon session of Parliament, said Amitabh Guha, managing director, State Bank of Hyderabad.

 The bank is consulting three to four investment bankers, including JP Morgan, Enam Financials and DSP Merrill Lynch, on the value of its shares and to manage the public issue. However, we have not yet appointed one, said Guha, adding that a decision is likely when the board meets on Tuesday. The meeting will also take stock of the banks performance in 2005-06. 

 Three of the seven associate banks of the State Bank of India (SBI) are now listed on the bourses. The non-listed subsidiary banks are the State Bank of Hyderabad (SBH), State Bank of Patiala (SBP), State Bank of Indore and State Bank of Saurashtra (SBS). SBI holds a 100 per cent stake each in the State Bank of Hyderabad, Patiala and Saurashtra and 90 per cent in Indore.

 In March, the cabinet decided to amend the State Bank of India (Subsidiary Bank) Act, which will give SBIs associate banks more room to increase their capital base and raise money from the market to meet capital requirements under Basel II norms and increase business growth. This proposal is expected to be approved by Parliament during the monsoon session.

 The SBI (Subsidiary Bank) Act has no provisions for uniformity in authorised capital of associate banks. However, it stipulates that the equity shares of the SBI associate banks should be Rs 100 each and no individual can hold more than 200 shares in any of these banks. 

 The proposed amendments seek to remove the cap on individual shareholding in any of the associate banks, change the face value of shares from Rs 100 each to Rs 10, raise the authorised capital to Rs 500 crore and reduce SBIs holding to 55-51 per cent, Guha said. SBH has an authorised capital of Rs 50 crore and a paid-up capital of Rs 17.25 crore. 

 We have three options for diluting SBIs 100 per cent stake in SBH ? by issuing fresh equity shares, or by selling shares held by SBI in the bank, or a mix of both, Guha said.

 Roam rates get drop call 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Worldly wise

 New Delhi, June 16: The telecom regulator today made a first stab at slashing the exorbitant cost of international roaming.

 The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) attempted to do this by hurling a curve ball at telecom operators. It suggested that the telecom operators could consider the prospect of sharing revenues more equitably from the bloated call charge that cellphone users have to pay.

 The idea is to work out a fair revenue sharing arrangement between the home network, visiting network and the terminating network for roaming calls. 

 Roaming enables a cellular subscriber to automatically make and receive voice and data calls and also access other services while travelling outside the geographical coverage area of the home network, by plugging into a visiting network.

 If that sounds like a lot of gobbledygook, lets simplify it. The suggestion seems to be that if an Airtel customer goes abroad and makes a call to a Hutch subscriber, why should only Airtel rake in the moolah? Ought Airtel to share a part of the extra revenue with Hutch and any other operator that helps patch through the call?

 Revenue sharing is a loathsome word for the telecom industry and could be a sure-fire way of forcing international roaming call charges down. At present, international roaming is under forbearance ? which means that telecom operators have the full freedom to price the call without having to seek regulatory approval.

 The regulator has sought the views of service providers, consumers and corporate users, consumer organisations and other interested parties on a consultation paper on the subject which it released today.

 At present, the revenue sharing between home and visiting network is normally decided by mutual agreement between service providers. 

 Senior BSNL officials said, We are examining the papers and would not like to comment. CDMA operators body AUSPI also said it would prefer to wait for its members to react before commenting on it.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 PCs pasta, dosa and the less palatable dishes

 The following are excerpts from the finance ministers speech:

 I shall begin with my proposals on indirect taxes. First, customs duties.

 In line with the governments policy of reducing customs duties, I propose to reduce the peak rate for non-agricultural products from 15 per cent to 12.5 per cent. I believe that we are now only a short distance away from East Asian rates.

 Steel duty

 The duty on primary steel is at 5 per cent. I propose to reduce the duty on alloy steel and primary and secondary non-ferrous metals from 10 per cent to 7.5 per cent. This will also be the rate of duty for ferro alloys.

 In 2004-05, in view of the high international prices of steel, I had reduced the import duty on steel melting scrap to zero. With prices of steel coming down, I propose to restore the duty to 5 per cent and bring it on par with primary steel.

 Import duty

 Honourable members would recall that last year I had taken the power to impose a countervailing duty on all imports to compensate for state-level taxes. This levy was applied only to imports of ITA-bound items and their inputs, except IT software. After the introduction of VAT in most states, I have received representations from trade and industry that this levy should be extended to all imports. The argument is persuasive, and I propose to impose a CVD of 4 per cent on all imports with a few exceptions. Full credit of this duty will be allowed to manufacturers of excisable goods.

 Soft drinks

 There are only two items ? aerated drinks and cars ? that still attract the higher rate of 24 per cent. I propose to correct this substantially. I propose to reduce the excise duty on aerated drinks to 16 per cent.

 Small cars 

 On cars, I propose to reduce the excise duty to 16 per cent, but only for small cars. A small car, for this purpose, will mean a car of length not exceeding 4,000 mm and with an engine capacity not exceeding 1,500 cc for diesel cars and not exceeding 1,200 cc for petrol cars. I am confident that industry will seize the opportunity to make India a hub for the manufacture of small and fuel-efficient cars.

 Software amp; DVD drives

 I propose to impose an 8 per cent excise duty on packaged software sold over the counter. Customised software and software packages downloaded from the Internet will be exempt from this levy.

 I propose to fully exempt from excise duty DVD drives, flash drives and combo drives.

 Processed food

 Many food items, including packaged items, attract nil excise duty. With a view to giving a fillip to the food processing industry, I propose to fully exempt from excise duty condensed milk, ice cream, preparations of meat, fish and poultry, pectins, pasta and yeast.

 Excise duty on ready-to-eat packaged foods and instant food mixes, like dosa and idli mixes, will be reduced from 16 per cent to 8 per cent.

 Footwear

 Since leather and footwear are thrust sectors, I propose to exempt from excise duty two vegetable tanning extracts, namely, quebracho and chestnut. Footwear carrying a retail sale price up to Rs 250 is already exempt from excise duty. I propose to reduce excise duty on footwear with a retail sale price between Rs 250 and Rs 750 from 16 per cent to 8 per cent.

 Paper

 Paper finds widespread use in education as well as in packaging. In order to encourage capacity addition, I propose to reduce excise duty on specified printing, writing and packing paper from 16 per cent to 12 per cent.

 Computers

 There are two requests from trade and industry. I had exempted computers from excise duty in order to boost the use of computers. That purpose has been largely served. Domestic manufacturers have sought re-imposition of excise duty at 12 per cent in order to enable them to take Cenvat credit as well as to face competition from imports. I propose to accept the request. Since the 12 per cent excise duty will be eligible for full input tax credit, there should not be any impact on price.

 Cigarettes

 To round off, I would be failing in my duty if I did not raise the excise duty on cigarettes. Hence, I propose to increase the excise duty on cigarettes by about 5 per cent.

 Service tax

 In 2005-06, the services sector is estimated to contribute 54 per cent of GDP. Naturally, it should also contribute significantly to the exchequer. Continuing in the direction followed in the last few years, I propose to bring more services under the service tax net. 

 The new services to be covered include ATM operations, maintenance and management; registrars, share transfer agents and bankers to an issue; sale of space or time, other than in the print media, for advertisements; sponsorship of events, other than sports events, by companies; international air travel, excluding economy class passengers; container services on rail, excluding the railway freight charges; business support services; auctioneering; recovery agents; ship management services; travel on cruise ships; and public relations management services.

 I also propose to expand the coverage of certain services now subject to service tax. The details are available in the budget papers.

 The leasing and hire purchase industry has faced some difficulty owing to the levy of service tax on all components of payments, including interest. Interest and instalments of the principal amount will be abated in calculating the value of the service.

 Income-tax

 The good news is that there will be no change in the rates of personal income-tax or corporate income-tax. The other piece of good news is that no new taxes are being imposed.

 The one-by-six scheme under the Income-Tax Act obliging certain categories of persons to file returns will stand abolished.

 I propose to marginally revise certain tax rates in the quest for equity. While the corporate tax rate is 30 per cent, the rate under minimum alternate tax (MAT) is only 7.5 per cent of book profits. I propose to increase the rate to 10 per cent, which is still only one-third of the normal rate. I also propose to include long-term capital gains arising out of securities in calculating book profits. I have already allowed MAT-paying companies to take credit for MAT over five years. I propose to extend the period to seven years as well as adjust MAT credit while calculating interest liability.

 Securities tax

 The rates for the securities transaction tax (STT) were fixed when prices of securities were much lower. Reflecting the increase in implicit capital gains in securities transactions, I propose an increase of 25 per cent, across the board, on all rates of STT.

 Fixed deposit relief

 There is a demand that fixed deposits of certain tenure should qualify for tax exemption. I propose to include investments in fixed deposits in scheduled banks for a term of not less than five years in section 80C of the Income-Tax Act. I also propose to remove the limit of Rs 10,000 in respect of contribution to certain pension funds in section 80 CCC, subject to the overall ceiling of Rs 100,000.

 I propose to align the definition of open-ended equity-oriented schemes of mutual funds in the Income-Tax Act with the definition adopted by Sebi. I also propose to treat open-ended equity-oriented schemes and close-ended equity-oriented schemes on par for exemption from dividend distribution tax.

 I propose to remove the exemption under section 10(23G) which is not relevant when interest rates are moderate.

 Tax shelters

 Section 54EC and section 54ED are tax shelters. I propose to restrict the scope of section 54EC to two institutions, viz., NHAI and REC. For Nabard, Sidbi and NHB, which are banks, we have already opened the route of zero coupon bonds to raise low cost funds. I also propose to withdraw the benefit of section 54ED, which has become virtually redundant, with effect from April 1, 2006.

 Charitable institutions

 I propose that anonymous or pseudonymous donations to wholly charitable institutions will be taxed at the highest marginal rate. Such donations to partly religious and partly charitable institutions/trusts will be taxed only if the donation is specifically for an educational or medical purpose.

 However, I make it clear that such donations to wholly religious institutions and religious trusts will not be covered by the new provision.

 Members of state legislatures have complained that their constituency allowances are taxed differently from the constituency allowance received by members of Parliament. I propose to remove the discrimination.

 PAN

 The permanent account number is the critical element in capturing incomes and expenditures. Scrutiny of annual information returns (AIR) on high-value transactions reveals that 60 per cent of the transactions are without quoting PAN. Hence, I propose to take the power to issue PAN suo motu in certain cases. I also propose to take the power to direct persons to apply for PAN in certain cases.

 Withdrawal tax

 Last year, I introduced two new taxes. The banking cash transaction tax (BCTT) has turned out to be a boon, not for the modest revenues it brought which was never its purpose, but for the remarkable trails that it has helped establish.

 I propose to continue the BCTT for some more time until the AIR system is able to capture all significant financial transactions.

 Fringe benefit tax

 Fringe benefit tax (FBT) was introduced as a revenue raising measure. FBT can be justified on the principles of horizontal equity and vertical equity. Nevertheless, I have reviewed it with an open mind. I have also taken on board the views expressed by the apex chambers of commerce. I propose to make the following changes in chapter XII-H of the Income-Tax Act:

 Value the benefit in the form of tour and travel at 5 per cent instead of 20 per cent;

 Value the benefit in the form of hospitality and use of hotel boarding and lodging facilities, in the case of airline companies and shipping industry, at 5 per cent instead of 20 per cent;

 Exclude the expenses on free samples of medicines and of medical equipment distributed to doctors;

 Exclude the expenses incurred on brand ambassador and celebrity endorsement; 

 Prescribe a threshold of Rs 100,000 under section 115WB(1)(c) so that only a contribution by an employer to an approved superannuation fund in excess of Rs 100,000 per year per employee will attract FBT. Under section 80C, there is already an exemption up to Rs 100,000 for contribution by an employee to an approved superannuation fund. Honourable members will note that, under these two provisions, there can now be a tax-exempt contribution up to Rs 200,000 per year for the benefit of an employee.

 Bengal in Danish wireless loop

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Nov. 6: Bengal is set to become a hub for research in wireless mobile communications with Denmark- based Wireless Innovation Platform (WIP) setting up a centre at an initial investment of Rs 200 crore to develop patented products in the wireless space.

 WIP is a joint venture between two Danish companies, Sabita Holdings and Xfon Holdings.

 They had been in discussions with us for some time now and have taken 20 acres opposite Vedic Village (Rajarhat) to set up the centre, Debesh Das, Bengals minister for information technology, said here today.

 Das said WIP would invest Rs 200 crore in the first phase of the project spanning two years. 

 WIP will make the centre a leading knowledge hub for fourth generation wireless technology. The company aims to create a platform to facilitate convergence in telecom. 

 WIP will also seek investments and forge partnerships, involving both Indian and foreign firms, to widen its product range.

 The company would commence operations in February 2007 from temporary premises, Das added.

 The centre will start work on the existing 15 patents and five technological concepts of WIP. 

 By the end of the first year, the lab will be set up. The lab will also offer consultancy to mobile companies.

 The company is keen to develop products for the rural markets, where the telecom infrastructure is inadequate to meet the demands of the rural population.

 WIP wants to develop innovative solutions in the areas of healthcare, education, and entertainment for the rural market.

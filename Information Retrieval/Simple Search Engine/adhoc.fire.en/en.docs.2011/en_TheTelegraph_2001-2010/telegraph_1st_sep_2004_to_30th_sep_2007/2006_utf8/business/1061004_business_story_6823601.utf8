 LPG terminal at Ennore for Rs 400 cr

 Behuria: Big plans

 New Delhi, Oct. 3: Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) and Malaysian oil company Petronas will invest about Rs 400 crore to build an LPG import terminal at Ennore near Chennai.

 Indian Oil Petronas, the joint venture company floated by IOC and Petronas, will build a 600,000-tonne-a-year LPG import terminal at Ennore, an IOC official said.

 The joint venture, which currently operates a similar terminal at Haldia, plans to build two cryogenic storage tanks of 10,000 and 15,000 tonnes to store LPG at -42 degrees centigrade.

 Indian Oil Petronas plans to begin construction of the terminal early next year and commission the facility in the first half of 2009. The joint venture has appointed Triune as the project management consultant.

 Petronas has committed to supply 300,000 tonnes of LPG to Ennore, reducing dependence on the Mangalore import terminal from where Tamil Nadu is being fed. With the fast growing demand for the cooking fuel, a new terminal for Tamil Nadu has become necessary.

 In Andhra Pradesh, Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) has tied up with Total of France and would spend Rs 300 crore to set up an LPG import terminal and an underground storage facility at Visakhapatnam.

 HPCL, which currently moves LPG to Andhra Pradesh from Mangalore via a 900-km pipeline, plans to commission the Visakhapatnam facility by the second quarter of 2007, sources said.

 Refining capacity

 IOC plans to almost double its crude oil refining capacity to 80 million tonnes by 2011-12, the year by when it is targeting to scale $60-billion in turnover.

 This was revealed by IOC chairman Sarthak Behuria while presenting a dividend cheque of Rs 1197.60 crore for 2005-06 to petroleum minister Murli Deora.

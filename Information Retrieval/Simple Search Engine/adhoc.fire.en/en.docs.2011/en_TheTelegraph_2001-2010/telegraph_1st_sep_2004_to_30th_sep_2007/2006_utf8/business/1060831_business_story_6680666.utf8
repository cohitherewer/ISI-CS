 Retail investors come back

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Aug. 30: The retail investors are finally streaming back into the stock markets a place they deserted after burning their fingers when the Ketan Parekh scam wrung stock valuations and paper fortunes.

 Data put out in the RBI annual report shows that 4.9 per cent of household savings in 2005-06 were ploughed into shares and debentures. This is a level that has not been seen since 2000 when the Ketan Parekh scam erupted. 

 Compare this with the figures in the last two years: it was 1.1 per cent in 2004-05 and barely 0.1 per cent in 2003-04.

 In absolute terms, Rs 29,008 crore out of the overall household savings of Rs 35,31,451 crore was pumped into shares and debentures in 2005-06. 

 In 2004-05, only Rs 4,967 crore went into these instruments. And in 2003-04, it was just a piffle at Rs 492 crore.

 The stock markets have been surging all through 2005 but its only now that the retail investor has worked up enough courage to commit his money into the stock markets.

 The figures also show that most of this money is being routed through mutual funds (other than UTI) Rs 21,139 crore (or 3.6 per cent). In 2004-05, only Rs 1,550 crore of household savings went into mutual funds. This would also suggest that in that year, investors preferred to invest in the stocks themselves as only 32 per cent of the total amount invested in shares and debentures went through the MF route.

 That has changed this year and this could be attributed to the stock market gyrations since April. Almost 72.8 per cent of all funds committed to shares and debentures went through the MFs.

 Resource mobilisation from the primary market through public issues (excluding offers for sale) increased by 23.1 per cent to Rs 26,940 crore during 2005-06, the RBI report says.

 Private sector companies continued to dominate the public issue market, mobilising 78.5 per cent of the total money raised during 2005-06 compared with 61.6 per cent during 2004-05.

 Banks were the major issuers during the year in view of their requirement for capital adequacy. Banks and financial institutions, both in public and private sectors, mobilised 48.8 per cent of resources in 2005-06. Six public sector banks raised equity worth Rs 5,413 crore through public issues, accounting for about 20.1 per cent of the resources raised during 2005-06.

 Net resources mobilised by mutual funds increased sharply during 2005-06 led by higher inflows under equity-oriented schemes, reflecting investor interest due to attractive returns in a buoyant secondary market. Net assets of mutual funds also increased considerably by 55.0 per cent during 2005-06 compared with 7.2 per cent during 2004-05 on account of increase in the market value of their equity portfolio. Net assets of mutual funds, thus, increased from 4.8 per cent of GDP on March 31, 2005 to 6.6 per cent of GDP at March-end 2006.

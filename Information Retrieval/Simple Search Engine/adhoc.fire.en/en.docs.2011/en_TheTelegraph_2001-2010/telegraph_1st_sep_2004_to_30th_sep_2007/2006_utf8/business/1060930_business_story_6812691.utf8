 Labour pain in job survey

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Sept. 29: More than half of the countrys employable population was without regular jobs during 2004-05, with most of the unemployed in urban India, according to the National Sample Survey Organisation (NSS) data released today.

 The survey made a stunning revelation about unemployment when its findings showed that only 42 per cent of the employable population was usually employed during 2004-05. This means the remaining 58 per cent was either working part-time or had no jobs. The unemployment rate among the educated was higher than among those who studied up to the secondary level, the survey said.

 Between 1999-2000 and 2004-05, in rural areas, work participation rate in the usual status increased by a meagre 2 percentage points for males and by about 3 percentage points for females. In urban areas, the rates increased by about 3 percentage points for both males and females. 

 The all-India survey covered 79,306 households in 7,999 villages and 45,374 households in 4,602 urban blocks.

 There were three different approaches to measure employment and unemployment: usual status with a reference period of one year, current weekly status with one week reference period and current daily status based on daily activity pursued during each day of the reference week.

 In urban India, 28 per cent of the usually employed males was in trade, hotel and restaurant, 24 per cent in manufacturing and 21 per cent in services. In case of urban females, 36 per cent of them are employed in the services sector, 28 per cent in manufacturing and 18 per cent in agriculture.

 The number of persons unemployed per 1000 of the labour force (the unemployment rate) according to usual status was 17 in the rural areas and 45 in the urban locations.

 The unemployment rate among females is higher with the rate highest among urban females. 

 About four per cent of the rural households and eight per cent of the urban households had no usually employed member.

 The unemployment rate in terms of the usual status between 1999-2000 and 2004-05 remained almost the same for rural males and decreased by one percentage point for urban males. It increased by about one percentage point for females in both the rural and urban areas. About 11 per cent of households in both the rural and urban areas have women as their head.

 The data also highlights the poor rate of literacy in the country. In as many as 26 per cent of the households in the rural areas and eight per cent in the urban areas, there was not a single member in the age group of 15 years and above and who could read and write a simple message clearly.

 In the rural areas during 2004-05, about 64 per cent of males and 45 per cent of the females were literate. The corresponding proportions, in the urban areas, were 81 per cent and 69 per cent.

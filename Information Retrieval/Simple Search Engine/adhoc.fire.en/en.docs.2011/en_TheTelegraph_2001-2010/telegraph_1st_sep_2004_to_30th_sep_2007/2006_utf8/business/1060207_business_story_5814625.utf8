 Govt retains say in choice of PSU bosses

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 Singh: Old order returns

 New Delhi, Feb. 6: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has issued orders to the Public Enterprises Selection Board to follow its earlier practice of sending two names for every top PSU position for which it conducted interviews.

 Singh took this step after steel minister Ram Vilas Paswan and other cabinet colleagues expressed their dissatisfaction at the earlier order that required the board to send only one candidate?s name for a particular job.

 Paswan said this turned him and other ministers into mere postmen who had no say in the selection of the chief executives of PSUs that their ministries controlled.

 After amending the earlier selection orders, the board has sent a second panel of names for the Steel Authority of India?s (SAIL) plant managing directors. The officers, who had been selected earlier, will remain on the panel at the number one position, but each will be joined by another officer at number two. 

 The steel minister will go through the list and can opt for the second candidate for a particular post if he so desires. However, he will have to provide a convincing reason for his selection.

 Under the new practice, V.K. Gulati, who had earlier been selected as the managing director of Durgapur Steel Plant, will now be joined by V. Shyam Sundar, executive director at the corporate headquarters, on the selection panel.

 V.K. Srivastava, who is ED (works) at Bokaro and had been selected to head the Chhattisgarh-based plant, will now be joined on the panel by R.P. Rawat, the executive director of coal imports.

 Similarly, B.N.Singh, who was initially selected as the executive director (mines) for Rourkela Steel Plant, has been joined by R. Ramaraju, executive director of Bhilai. However, Ramaraju is also being considered as the head of the Bhilai plant. 

 G. Ojha of Bhilai Steel Plant, who was selected for the director personnel?s job, will now be joined by Raman Kumar, another executive director based at the corporate head office in New Delhi.

 But two executive directors ? M. Roy, who is believed to be close to the steel minister, and P.K. Dutta of IISCO, who is not supported by any lobby ? do not find a place on the list.

 The row over the posts of plant MDs is likely to be a prelude to the real battle for which Paswan is gearing up ? that for the post of the chairman of SAIL. The board had earlier selected S.K. Rungta, SAIL?s current director personnel, for the post of the chairman of the steel behemoth.

 But Paswan has never seen eye to eye with Rungta and had earlier set up a committee to probe coal purchases he had ordered as the marketing head of SAIL.

 Rungta fell foul of Paswan after several MPs wrote letters to the steel minister raising queries on the spot coal purchases made last year by SAIL after its Australian suppliers cried off claiming their mines had been flooded.

 The Australian mine crisis had seen severe coal shortages in the SAIL plants, forcing the steel company to resort to rationing till it booked coal through spot purchases.

 A committee comprising Rungta, other SAIL directors and joint secretaries from the ministry decided to make the spot purchases. 

 However, when a probe was ordered by Paswan on the basis of the letters received from MPs, Rungta alone went on leave as he was the principal functionary.

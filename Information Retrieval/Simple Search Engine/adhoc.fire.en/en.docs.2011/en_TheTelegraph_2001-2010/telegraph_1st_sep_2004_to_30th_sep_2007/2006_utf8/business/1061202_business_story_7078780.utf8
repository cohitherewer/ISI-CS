 RBI sees little room for more tax cut

 Mumbai, Dec. 1 (PTI): Reserve Bank deputy governor Rakesh Mohan today asked industry chambers to refrain from demanding tax rate cuts, saying the rates were already moderate by international standards.

 I was surprised by the chambers asking for more tax reductions while also asking for more expenditure on infrastructure, he said at a book release function at the Indian Merchants Chamber here.

 Finance minister P. Chidambaram, however, hinted at further moderation of tax rates himself at the economic editors conference last month, but added that this depended on greater tax compliance.

 I have not put any timeframe on moderation of tax rates, Chidambaram said here yesterday regarding when the rates would be rationalised.

 According to Mohan, there was a need now for an efficient and automatic system to collect taxes. He highlighted the model of tax deducted at source (TDS) as an ideal way to collect taxes.

 Mohan described TDS as a painless method of collecting taxes and urged industry chambers to devise methods on the lines of TDS for collection. According to him, it is always painful to pay taxes after the money comes into ones bank account, but it is less so if deducted before being credited to ones account (as in the case of TDS).

 Mohan described the large number of tax exemptions as frightening and said this was not good. He said not enough attention was being paid to tax administration.

 He, however, said much progress had been made in indirect tax reforms with the number of excise rates coming down from 22 to three, while the number for customs duties have been reduced from 22 to four. 

 He highlighted the issue of tax compliance by saying while tax rates had been lowered, the issue of compliance needed to be addressed.

 Earlier, V.S. Krishnan, the central excise commissioner of Pune III, whose book Mohan released, said the Indian tax scenario comprised a narrow base and emphasised on the need for its widening.

 Pine Cask to set up lounge bars

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 19: Pine Cask Beverages India Pvt Ltd is setting up a chain of lounge bars and restaurants. It plans to open 100 such outlets in the next seven to eight years across the country at an investment of Rs 400 crore.

 On the Rocks, the first outlet spread across 2000 sq m has already started its operations in Goa from early February. The next one will come up in Pune in April on a 1500-sq-m plot.

 We are looking at opening the third outlet in Calcutta as the company has its origins in the eastern region. We are talking to real estate developers. We would prefer a location in Salt Lake as the project requires a substantial space, said Karan Rekhi, executive director of Pine Cask.

 Calcutta, May 15: Singapore-based DIC Asia Pacific Pte Ltd will pump more capital into its Indian operations, DIC India Ltd, to expand the printing ink manufacturing capacity. 

 DIC Asia Pacific, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the world?s leading printing ink manufacturer, Dianippon Ink and Chemicals of Japan, had acquired a 65.76 per cent controlling stake in Coates of India Ltd two years back, following which Coates was renamed as DIC India Ltd. 

 ?We are expecting an annual cumulative growth rate of 10-15 per cent in printing and graphic ink business here. At present, DIC India has seven manufacturing facilities. We want to increase the production capacity, which includes setting up new units as well as expanding the existing ones,? DIC Asia Pacific head M. Saito said on the sidelines of DIC India?s annual general meeting here today. 

 However, he declined to divulge the quantum of investment the Japanese parent was planning for its Indian operations. 

 ?The investments will be made soon. It could be a one-time investment or spread over the next few years. A decision is yet to be taken,? he said.

 DIC India disappointed shareholders with a 35 per cent dividend. They had demanded a higher payout.

 The company is betting big on newspaper and publishing industry for the growth of its printing ink business ? the mainstay of DIC India?s total sales.

 ?Printing ink, both black and colour, are going to be our primary focus. However, we will keep changing our product-mix in line with the market demand. For example, we have started manufacturing lamination adhesives for the top-end segment,? said DIC India managing director P.K. Dutt. 

 The company is planning to expand and modernise its Noida and Calcutta factories. 

 ?While Noida will be the main facility to manufacture newspaper printing ink, the Calcutta facility will be developed for exports,? Dutt said.

 New Delhi, Dec. 14: Sunil Bharti Mittal today said Bharti Enterprises had no intention of selling any further stake to Vodafone of the UK but added a twist to all the telecom tattle this week by saying he might be interested in buying out the Ruias stake in Hutch Essar.

 Rumours have swirled for months that Vodadone, which owns 10 per cent in the Mittal telecom venture, is looking to raise its stake.

 We will not sell any further stake in our telecom venture, said Mittal, who is the chairman and managing director of Bharti Enterprises.

 However, at the India Telecom 2006 summit, where Bharti chose to make the statement, the buzz was that Essar itself was trying to buy out Hutchison Telecom Internationals 67 per cent stake in the joint venture.

 Hutchison Essar managing director Asim Ghosh firmly capped all the speculation surrounding the joint venture by telling reporters, When there are no sellers, how can buyers exist?

 Ghosh further said that the quoted value of Hutch floating around in the market Hutch has been valued at more than $15 billion was very low. No party is big enough to buy out Hutch, he added.

 Essar officials themselves chose to remain mum.

 Britains Vodafone Group Plc had lately been showing an interest in raising its stake in Bharti Airtel in order to build a stronger foothold in the lucrative Indian telecom space. 

 Mittal said, We are delighted that Vodafone recognises Bharti Airtels competence as a leading telecom player and wants to increase its stake in the venture. It is an expression of their confidence in India.

 They are most welcome to do so. However we are not ready to dilute our shares at present, Mittal added.

 In October last year, Vodafone had picked up a 10 per cent stake in Bharti Airtel for Rs 6,700 crore. 

 The acquisition gave Vodafone a presence in India. While Vodafone holds 10 per cent in Bharti Airtel, Singapore Telecom (Singtel) has a 31 per cent stake in the venture.

 SingTel, which invested in Bharti in 2001, is also known to have shown interest in increasing investments in India, saying they would evaluate opportunities as and when they arise.

 The SingTel spokesperson was not available for comments.

 Mittal, however, said Bharti Enterprises was interested in buying part of Hutchisons stake in Hutchison Essar Limited, its Indian joint venture, but only if approached by the Essar Group.

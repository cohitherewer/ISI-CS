 Calcutta, July 10: Godrej Properties Ltd is in talks with international realty funds to develop several projects in the country.

 Pirojsha Godrej, manager (corporate development) of the company, said the association with these funds would be project-specific.

 The real estate firm of the Godrej group is developing properties spanning 11 million sq ft in four cities. It has completed many of these projects.

 In Calcutta, Godrej Properties is developing two IT parks and a mall. This is the company?s first mall in India, which it is developing along with RPG Enterprise.

 However, it aims to invest heavily in other cities too in future. 

 Even as many realty companies are entering the capital market to raise resources, Godrej Properties has ruled out any such plan at the moment.

 ?We are not looking at diluting equity through IPO. Neither will we offload to realty funds but will work with them on a case-to-case basis,? he added.

 Godrej Industries, the listed entity, owns 80 per cent of Godrej Properties.

 The company has posted a net profit of Rs 20 crore on a turnover of Rs 100 crore last financial year.

 Even as all its projects in Calcutta are in the commercial space, the company intends to focus on residential projects.

 Pirojsha said they were looking at opportunities in the residential sector in Calcutta as well. ?We are open to work with the government,? he added.

 Godrej Properties is undertaking projects worth Rs 300-400 crore in the city with the mall contributing Rs 70-80 crore.

 CESC, the RPG group flagship, and Godrej have appointed RTKL, the UK-based architecture, engineering and planning firm for the mall at Park Circus.

 John Robertson, an associate with RTKL, was in Calcutta today to hold talks with RPG Enterprise vice-chairman Sanjiv Goenka, Pirojsha and Parmeshwar Godrej of Godrej Properties.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Monday mourning after Friday fun

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, June 12: Weak overseas markets and unloading by mutual funds today hammered down the sensex by 334 points, deflating the bullish expectations generated by the market bellwethers 500-point rise on Friday.

 The wave of selling started with the heavyweights and spread across most of the counters. Reliance Industries, Housing Development Finance Corporation, ICICI Bank, ITC and many other big guns slipped under the pressure.

 Brokers said negative vibes pervaded from the onset of trading as the overseas markets were in a torpor. 

 Though the 30-share sensex opened marginally higher at 9858.47 from Fridays close of 9810.46, it was not long before the sellers started thumping on the counters. 

 Later in the day the shares attempted a comeback only to be swept aside in the last 30 minutes of trading. The sensex finally ended at 9476.15, from an intra-day high of 9859.38, a loss of 334.31 points.

 The market took heart from the renewed interest of FIIs who were reportedly net buyers today. The FIIs have been net buyers in the past few sessions as well, according to Sebi. On Friday, they were net buyers to the tune of $112 million.

 The BSE bankex ? a performance indicator for bank stocks ? was the worst hit among the sectoral indices as the repo manoeuvres by the RBI sent all the wrong signals. Though the mid-cap and the small-cap indices also tanked, some shares were on the green due to value buying.

 However, it was the poor performance of new issues that was the highlight of the day. 

 The market trampled over Deccan Aviation Ltd and Unity Infraprojects Ltd which debuted today. 

 Shares of both the companies ended at a steep discount of over 30 per cent against their issue price.

 Deccan Aviation, which had a difficult time in getting its issue subscribed, was the worst hit. The company, which runs the low-cost airline, Air Deccan, had to reduce its price band to Rs 146-175 per share from Rs 150-175 during book building. The company then fixed an issue price of Rs 148.

 Deccan debuted at Rs 148.05, sunk to a low of Rs 97.05 before closing at Rs 98.85, a discount of 33.20 per cent to its offer price. The counter saw 36,400 trades with 43.69 lakh shares changing hands.

 Shares of the construction firm, Unity Infraprojects, opened at Rs 650 and fell to a days low of Rs 462.10. It finished at Rs 471.70, a 30 per cent discount to its offer price of Rs 675.

 Investors who had been allotted shares at the IPO may be indeed ruing their decision. This is a warning call to many who are planning new issues. There is a market for good issues, but they will have to be made at the right pricing, said an analyst.

 Such a discount is not limited to these two issues alone. Many IPOs and follow on offerings are now trading well below their offer price.

 Among the blue chip stocks, Reliance Industries fell by Rs 19.30 to Rs 902.80, SBI by Rs 26.10 to Rs 745.35, ICICI Bank by Rs 24.75 to Rs 475.25, HDFC by Rs 82.95 to Rs 1,124.90, Grasim by Rs 109.45 to Rs 1,666.10, Bhel by Rs 129.75 to Rs 1,743.90 and Tata Steel by Rs 29.55 to Rs 426.70.

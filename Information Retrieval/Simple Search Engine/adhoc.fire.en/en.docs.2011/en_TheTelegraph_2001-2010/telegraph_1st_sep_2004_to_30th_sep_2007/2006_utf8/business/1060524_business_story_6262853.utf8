 Fuel meet with PM on Thursday

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Deora: Talk time

 New Delhi, May 23: The government is trying to spare cooking gas and kerosene even as it grapples with the options on fuel price hike.

 Petroleum minister Murli Deora said today, We are trying to see that in some areas like kerosene and LPG, we dont increase prices.

 The minister said he would meet Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Thursday to discuss options available to the government. A final decision on the extent of the hike in the prices of petrol and diesel will be taken by the Cabinet.

 Although oil companies have been demanding a hike in the region of Rs 9-10 per litre in the prices of petrol and diesel, the government is expected to settle for a modest rise of Rs 2-3 per litre.

 The low prices of cooking gas and kerosene have created a greater havoc on the bottomlines of oil companies, but there is little possibility of a hike as the government fears a backlash if these politically sensitive items become dearer.

 The dilemma over prices was also discussed at the UPA meeting today that was attended by the Left.

 The petroleum ministry is confronted by a tradeoff between higher prices and a cut in excise and customs duties ? the higher the duty cut the lower will be the rise in prices and vice-versa. The under-recoveries of oil PSUs at current prices are projected at Rs 73,512 crore for 2006-07.

 The government can also offer oil bonds as in the last fiscal when it issued Rs 15,000 crore of the paper.

 The petroleum ministry prefers an allocation in the budget for LPG and kerosene subsidy, similar to the allotments for fertiliser and food. 

 The ministry is also keen to tap the cess on crude oil that was raised in the budget.

 Deora had said yesterday he would again meet the Prime Minister, finance minister, Left parties and his party colleagues to reach a consensus.

 The prices of petrol and diesel were revised in September 2005. The move to raise LPG prices was scuppered by Lalu Prasad Yadav fearing a voter backlash at the Bihar assembly elections.

 The Left Parties have vehemently opposed any rise, preferring a cut in duty rates, and Deora is leveraging their adamant stand in his tussle with the finance ministry to cut duty rates.

 The duty is based mainly on the value of the products. As the prices of crude or petroleum products go up, taxes rise as well. This acts as a double whammy for the oil companies and the consumers while the government rakes in extra money. 

 Oil companies have demanded that prices of petrol be raised by Rs 9.33 a litre, that of diesel by Rs 10.43 a litre, kerosene by Rs 17.16 per litre and LPG by Rs 114.45 a cylinder.

 June date for first series of oil bonds

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 7: The petroleum ministry expects the first tranche of oil bonds to be released by the end of the first quarter of the current fiscal that is June.

 The government has decided to issue interest-bearing bonds to Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum, and Hindustan Petroleum, aggregating Rs 28,000 crore.

 A petroleum ministry official said bonds worth Rs 7,000 crore were expected to be issued by the end of the first quarter. While Indian Oil is expected to get Rs 3,500 crore, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum will be given around Rs 1,700 crore each. 

 The oil companies are keen to liquidate the bonds as they have incurred heavy debts to run their operations because of shortage of liquidity due to the huge under-recoveries.

 The bonds are IOU slips from the government and can be sold at a discount in the market. Meanwhile, IOC has successfully liquidated 7.07 per cent oil bonds worth Rs 835 crore (including Rs 70 crore for IBP) maturing in March 2009 in the secondary market. These bonds were issued during the last fiscal.

 A senior IOC official said the secondary market liquidation of these bonds concluded today through the book building route.

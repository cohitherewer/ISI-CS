 Carlsberg stir in beer mug

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Cheers!

 Mumbai, Dec. 7: The froth is expected to fly in Indias hugely competitive beer market with Carlsberg, the worlds sixth biggest brewer, today announcing plans to build a brewery in Rajasthan in a joint venture with other investors. 

 The brewery will have an annual capacity of 450,000 hectolitres and will be operational in the first quarter of 2008. The main office of the joint venture will be in Delhi. 

 Carlsberg will hold 45 per cent in the joint venture named South Asia Breweries Limited, while Industrialisation Fund for Developing Countries will hold 10 per cent. The remaining stake of 45 per cent will be owned by a group of investors, led by Carlsbergs partner in Sri Lanka, The Lion Brewery Ceylon Ltd. 

 However, the parties have agreed not to disclose the total investment in the joint venture. 

 The site for the project is in the industrial estate established by Rajasthan State Industrial Development and Investment Corporation Ltd (RIICO) in the Alwar district, which is located 150 km south-west of Delhi. 

 In a statement available on its website, Carlsberg said the potential for growth in the Indian beer market was significant. 

 The annual beer consumption per capita is among the lowest in Asia, at only about 0.7 litres per year, and the annual GDP growth rate is more than 9 per cent. 

 The total beer market in India is approximately 8 million hectolitres. However, it is currently among the top three markets in Asia in terms of expected growth rates.

 The total beer consumption in 2005 in Rajasthan and the three neighbouring states of Delhi, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh was 1.7 million hectolitres with a population base of 250 million. 

 According to analysts, India has a consolidated beer market, with United Breweries Limited controlling about 45 per cent of the market and Kingfisher being the countrys largest selling beer. 

 London-headquartered SABMiller has a 35 per cent share of the Indian beer market.

 Diageo set to meet target

 In high spirits

 London, Oct. 17 (Reuters): Diageo Plc, the worlds No 1 alcoholic drinks group, said it was on track with its full-year target for underlying operating profit to grow by at least 7 per cent after the first quarter of this fiscal.

 The British maker of Smirnoff vodka, Johnnie Walker whisky and Guinness beer said on Tuesday it had gained market share in the North American market in the July-September period.

 Trading in Europe was mixed, however, with a double-digit percentage rise in Russian sales offset by a weaker market in Spain and slower sales of Guinness in Ireland and Britain.

 Diageo was issuing a trading statement to accompany its annual shareholder meeting. 

 At 1110 GMT, the firms shares were up 0.6 per cent at 958-1/2 pence, down from around 962 pence when the trading update was released and valuing the business at about 26 billion ($48.5 billion). 

 Diageo shares have outperformed the DJ Stoxx European food and drinks index by around 5 per cent since the start of the year and trade at 17.1 times forecast earnings compared with 16.9 for rival Pernod, according to Reuters data.

 Earlier on Tuesday, Chinese distiller Sichuan Swellfun Co Ltd said trading in its shares had been halted after reports it might be bought by Diageo.

 Diageo has said it is keen to expand its footprint in China, but a spokeswoman declined to comment on the recent reports in Chinese media.

 Manpower earnings

 Staffing company Manpower Inc on Tuesday said quarterly earnings rose 32 per cent on strong demand for workers in Europe and a weaker US dollar, and said fourth-quarter earnings will be higher than analysts expect.

 Manpower earned $100.6 million, or $1.16 per share, compared with $76.3 million, or 87 cents per share, a year earlier.

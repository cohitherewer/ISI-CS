 Security hurdle to BSNL plan 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 7: Bharat Sanchar Nigams foray into international long distance has been delayed further as it has failed to get the security clearance for the monitoring equipment to be installed in the ILD network. 

 The state-run telecom giant has not got the security clearance from the intelligence bureau (IB).

 Senior officials said the monitoring equipment that BSNL installed did not match IBs standards as it did not have certain functionality. 

 BSNL got the equipment through TCIL, they added. 

 Following the IBs objection, the PSU is in the process of installing fresh equipment that would meet the standards.

 Seven months ago, BSNL was pulled up by the department of telecom for failing to install the designated monitoring equipment for its ILD services. 

 In order to adhere to the security norms, all ILD operators are required to install a lawful interception and monitoring equipment for ILD Network.

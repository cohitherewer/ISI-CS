 Mutuals yet to reap gains from rally

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Oct. 30: The sensex has posted a 65 per cent increase year-on-year from 7892.32 on October 31, 2005 to 13024.26 today but the mutual fund investors arent really cock-a-hoop over this rollicking ride. Almost all the broad category funds are trailing the returns on the sensex. 

 A look at the one-year returns posted by various types of mutual funds will reveal that index funds have been the top grosser in terms of average returns of 57.4 per cent. 

 In sharp contrast, the diversified and tax-planning funds, which have been the multi-baggers since the beginning of the current bull run, have been left behind this year. 

 While the average returns posted by diversified funds have been 49.47 per cent, it has been even lower for the tax-planning schemes at 43.39 per cent. 

 According to Dhirendra Kumar of Value Research, Mutual funds might not have been major beneficiaries as the recent rally has mostly been confined to large-cap stocks. 

 However, a close look at the returns will reveal that the funds have been able to regain most of their lost ground and some schemes have actually beaten the index, said Kumar. 

 This includes schemes like Sundaram Select Midcap, which has posted a one-year return of 80.36 per cent, Pru ICICI Infrastructure with 76.35 per cent and Tata Infrastructure with 75.66 per cent.

 Kumar says, The funds have definitely been able to add value to retail investors, who would have been in the junkyard had they tried to ride the roller coaster index. 

 Most of the retail investors accumulate the momentum stocks, which fall as fast as they rise. However, mutual funds with their screening and quality focus choose the scrips which will not be susceptible to such ups and downs, he added. 

 Once the rally extends to the mid-cap and small-cap stocks, the mutual funds will be able to get the desired effect on their holdings, said Kumar. 

 All the good news have been factored in the sensex and nifty stocks and now the next movement should come in the quality mid-cap stocks, said Manish Sonthalia, vice-president (equity strategy), Motilal Oswal. 

 Analysts say the robust corporate numbers and positive feel in the market will see the mutual funds pumping money into stocks. Mutual funds have been net sellers in the equity market so far this month with purchases of shares worth about Rs 6,777 crore and sale of about Rs 7,161 crore. 

 Mutual funds have made net purchase of shares worth over Rs 10,000 crore in this fiscal. In contrast, FIIs have purchased shares worth more than Rs 30,000 crore so far in October. However, FIIs have also sold shares worth more than Rs 25,000 crore, bringing their net inflow to nearly Rs 5,000 crore in the month.

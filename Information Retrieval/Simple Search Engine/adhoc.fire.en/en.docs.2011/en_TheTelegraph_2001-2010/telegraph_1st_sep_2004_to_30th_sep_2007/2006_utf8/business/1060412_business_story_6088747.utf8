 Wockhardt gets US rap for Waluj act

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Bitter pill

 Mumbai, April 11: The US Food and Drugs Administration has warned Wockhardt that its applications for new drugs stand the risk of getting cancelled if its procedures for keeping records continue to deviate from the specified norms. The charges relate to Wockhardt?s Waluj manufacturing facility in Aurangabad, Maharashtra.

 In a letter to Wockhardt, the US department of health amp; human services said its inspection of the Waluj facilities in November last year had revealed ?significant deviations from US Current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMP) in the manufacturing of drug products and active pharmaceutical ingredients.? The letter was written to the company vice-president Raju Krishna Swamy on February 21. 

 Though these deviations were listed immediately after the inspection, still a lot more needs to be done: the letter said Wockhardt has to make more comprehensive corrections in deficiencies relating to written production and process control procedures. 

 ?Written production and process control procedures were not always followed and documented at the time of performance,? it said, adding that proper documentation is a control, which raises assurance on product quality.

 Deeming inadequate documentation as a case of serious violation, the letter reiterated the FDA?s concern that the two previous inspections also noted failure to maintain complete records, and that ?your firm (Wockhardt) may not have taken this type of discrepancy seriously?. The letter mentioned that at a meeting on May 7, 2004, Wockhardt had indicated that there were cases of inappropriate documentation at Waluj.

 ?Failure to correct these deficiencies may result in FDA denying entry of articles manufactured by your firm into the US,? the department said. The department has given Wockhardt 30 days to respond. 

 Wockhardt, however, said the observations would not affect its operations. Wockhardt has two facilities in Aurangabad, at Chikalthana and Waluj. The Chikalthana plant was inspected and approved by FDA in February this year.

 ?The Chikalthana plant accounts for almost all the existing US business of Wockhardt. As such, the FDA observations will not have any impact on Wockhardts business,? the company said. Wockhardt said the Waluj plant, which makes sterile cephalosporin injectables, is yet to commercialise production for the US market.

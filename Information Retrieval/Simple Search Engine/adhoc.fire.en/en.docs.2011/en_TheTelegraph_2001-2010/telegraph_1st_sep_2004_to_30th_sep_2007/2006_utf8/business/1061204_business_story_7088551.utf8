 Building jobs boom in 11th Plan

 Mumbai, Dec. 3 (PTI): The countrys buoyant construction sector, which is on the threshold of an unprecedented boom, will throw up immense employment opportunities during the Eleventh Five Year plan period starting next year.

 The construction industry alone will create more than 17 lakh employment opportunities during the Eleventh Plan period, Rajeeva Ratna Shah, member-secretary of Planning Commission, said here.

 The Planning Commission estimates seven million job opportunities during the Eleventh Plan period and at least 20 to 25 per cent of that will come from the construction sector alone, Shah said.

 The country will require investments to the tune of $320 billion over a period of five to seven years to meet the demands of this sector, he added.

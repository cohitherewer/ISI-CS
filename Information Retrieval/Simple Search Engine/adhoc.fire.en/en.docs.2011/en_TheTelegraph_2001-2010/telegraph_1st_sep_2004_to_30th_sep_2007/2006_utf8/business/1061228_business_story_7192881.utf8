 Big Mac to invest Rs 400cr in India

 New Delhi, Dec. 27 (PTI): Fast foods chain McDonalds today said it is planning to invest about Rs 400 crore in India in the next three years to expand its presence in the country, which includes setting up outlets at railway stations and domestic airports. The company would set up outlets in McExpress and kiosk formats and is looking at tieups with Indian Railways and Airports Authority of India, McDonalds said in a statement here.

 After making its presence felt in petrol pumps via strategic oil alliances, this phase of expansion will witness McDonalds further venturing into unexplored destinations such as the domestic airport in Delhi and look at tieups with the Indian Railways, the statement said. 

 Nearly 70 per cent of the investments would be toward the expansion of the brands presence and introduction of new formats while 30 per cent of the amount will be spent in strengthening back-end operations, the statement said.

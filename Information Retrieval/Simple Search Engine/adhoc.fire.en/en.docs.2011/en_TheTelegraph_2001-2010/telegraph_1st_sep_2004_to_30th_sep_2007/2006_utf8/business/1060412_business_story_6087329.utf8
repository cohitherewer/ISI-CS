 Bigger role for states in roads

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 11: The Centre is planning to involve state governments in the road transport sector under the fourth phase of the national highway development project (NHDP-IV) as part of the initiative to attract more investment and accelerate growth.

 The roads sector requires an investment of Rs 2,20,000 crore by 2015. The NHDP-IV would have 20,000 km of two-lane roads and we seriously feel states should contribute in this phase, road transport secretary L.K. Joshi said here today.

 State governments have realised the importance of adequate transport network and some states such as Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar have set up agencies to focus on road development, he said. 

 However, the states have been complaining of lack of funds as the main sources of taxation are with the Centre. In fact most state governments have been asking for several state highways to be transferred to the national highway category so that they can be built with central government funds.

 Although the Centre has included some state highways in the national highway list for development it has been refusing most such requests on the ground that it already has its hands full and does not have the resources to take up any projects. 

 Joshi said the Indian road network is the second largest in the world but the sector needed to grow at a rapid rate to meet the demands of the economy. 

 He said while the golden quadrilateral project comprising about 6,000 km linking the four metro cities in the country is almost complete, work is also going on in other projects such as the north-south corridor, the east-west corridor and roads to improve port connectivity.

 The government is also planning to set up a commissionerate of road safety and a dedicated road safety fund to minimise accidents, he said. 

 As many as 85 per cent of all road accident deaths occur in developing countries and India accounts for 10 per cent of such fatalities worldwide. 

 The poor condition of roads, bad driving habits and lack of proper road signs are among the reasons that lead to road accidents. Inadequate trauma handling facilities is yet another factor that leads to higher deaths in developing countries such as India.

 There is a need to set up such facilities as proper care in the first few hours after an accident are considered crucial in ensuring the survival of victims.

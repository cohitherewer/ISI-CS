 UTI Bank goes shopping for funds

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, July 29: UTI Bank plans to raise close to Rs 1,770 crore through a combination of hybrid instruments and medium term notes (MTN).

 The banks board today decided to launch two separate foreign currency MTN programmes under which it will raise Rs 205.96 crore and Rs 700.54 crore each. It will also borrow up to Rs 214.3 crore under Hybrid Tier I in one or more tranches and Rs 652.4 crore under Upper Tier II in one or more phases.

 The fund-raising programme is expected to push up its capital adequacy ratio, which came down to 10.28 per cent in June compared with 11.74 per cent during the same period last year. The funds will also sponsor the banks business growth, including overseas expansion. 

 Earlier this year, chairman and managing director P.J. Nayak had said the bank would raise up to $1 billion through MTNs to fund its overseas expansion plan, which will see the establishment of a branch in Singapore.

 UTI Bank has been strong on the retail front. Retail advances registered a significant jump, moving from Rs 4,320 crore in June 2005 to Rs 7,842 crore in June this year, a growth of 82 per cent. Retail advances accounted for 30 per cent of the total advances of the bank for the first quarter of this year.

 Earlier this week, Dena Bank said it is planning to raise close to Rs 425 crore through innovative perpetual debt instruments (Tier I) and upper Tier II debt instruments.

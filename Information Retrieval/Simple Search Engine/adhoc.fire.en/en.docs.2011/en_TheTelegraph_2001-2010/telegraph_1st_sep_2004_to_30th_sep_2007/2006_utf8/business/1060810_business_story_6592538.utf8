 Govt starts drill for crude swap

 New Delhi, Aug. 9: The government has asked ONGC-Videsh (OVL) to explore the possibility of swapping its share of crude in the Sakhalin-1 field in Russia to save on freight costs.

 The oil ministry feels the crude could be offered to countries in the vicinity of the offshore Sakhalin field for oil that these countries pick up, for instance, from the Gulf. This would enable both the countries to save on transport costs.

 Sources said the government has also asked OVL to consider other options, such as ship-to-ship transfers, so that the country can get its share of crude on a non-commercial basis.

 OVL planned to bring crude from Sakhalin on a pilot basis by the end of the year. However, given the high freight cost, this is not the best option. 

 The ministry appears to be keen on a swap as it allows the crude to be sold at a discount to public sector refiners.

 However, senior oil company officials feel that the ministry is taking a narrow view of energy security by emphasising on bartering OVLs output.

 They suggest sale of the Sakhalin oil and use of the proceeds to purchase crude at a lower price from the international market. Confining the company to barter trade may not be the best way out, a senior oil company official said. 

 The officials said OVL should try to sell the gas from Sakhalin to China which has raised its offer price to match global LNG prices. 

 OVL is considering the option to bring the natural gas from Sakhalin to India and take the assistance of Russian giant Gazprom to set up facilities to convert the gas into liquefied natural gas (LNG). 

 However, if the LNG goes to Japan, OVL has the option of a swap deal with the Japanese buyers. 

 The Chinese have reportedly raised their offer to bring it on a par with the prices of the Japanese buyers for LNG.

 OVLs share of oil and gas was expected to be higher in the initial years as the loan taken by Russian oil company Rosneft for developing the Sakhalin field was to be paid in kind. However, with Rosneft having pre-paid the loan the extra share of oil and gas will not be made available. 

 Rosneft had taken the loan at a time when it was hard pressed for cash. However, the company has acquired more oilfields since then, in a reversal of the earlier policy of privatisation in Russia. The boom in oil prices has transformed it into a cash-rich company.

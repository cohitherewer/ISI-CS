 Court rejects Lodha plea

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, March 17: Calcutta High Court today dismissed the three separate writ petitions filed by chartered accountant R.S. Lodha and his two sons A.V. Lodha and H.V. Lodha, seeking a directive from the court to the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) for hearing petitions filed by them.

 In its petitions to the ICAI, the Lodhas, who are partners of Lodha and Company which is a member of BDO International, had prayed for rejection of complaints filed against it by three ICAI chartered accountants, namely .P. Agarwal, Shashi Agarwal and S.K. Sharma.

 Lodha, engaged in a bitter legal battle with the Birlas for the control of the Rs 5,000-crore estate of the MP Birla group, had filed the petition seeking that ICAI hear his petition before taking up the complaints against him and his sons.

 After hearing the submissions of counsel of respective parties, Justice Jayanta Biswas rejected the applications by R.S. Lodha and his sons as the statute and regulations of ICAI have no provision for such rejection petitions. The petitions could not be considered due to this, Justice Biswas observed while passing the order. 

 Dismissing the writ petitions the court expressed its view that the applicants could now approach the ICAI for extension of time to file their written statement.

 Last October, Lodha contended before the ICAI that the accusations levelled by the three chartered accountants against him and his sons were malafide and motivated. 

 A noted chartered accountant himself, R.S. Lodha has been accused of professional malpractice by Shashi Agarwal, .P. Agarwal and Suresh K. Sharma. Lodha alleged that the complainants had been set up by the Birlas. 

 The complainants had alleged before the ICAI that despite being statutory auditors for the MP Birla group, the Lodhas were also on the boards of several companies of the group and were actively involved in the management of these companies. 

 The complainants stated that such acts displayed conflict of interests and professional misconduct and that these were violative of ICAI rules.

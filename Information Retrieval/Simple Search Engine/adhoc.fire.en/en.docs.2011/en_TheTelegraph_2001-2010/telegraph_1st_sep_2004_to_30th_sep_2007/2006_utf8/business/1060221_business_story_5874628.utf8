 New Fed chief hints at shift in fiscal policy

 Bernanke: Playing safe 

 Washington, Feb. 20 (Reuters): New Federal Reserve chief Ben Bernanke last week used his first congressional appearance to pledge continuity with the Greenspan Fed, but broke with his famous predecessor by refusing to offer fiscal policy advice.

 Alan Greenspans frequent forays into budget matters had drawn fire from both political and economic circles, most prominently from democrats incensed with the verbal succour the former Fed chief provided for hefty tax cuts in 2001.

 Bernanke made clear he would take a new tack.

 There is a deficit; Id like to see it lowered, Bernanke told a House of Representatives panel on Wednesday. But its up to Congress to decide whether that should be done by higher taxes, lower spending or some combination.

 Its not up to me to decide what the size of the government is, he said.

 In contrast, Greenspan had always voiced a preference for narrowing budget gaps by cutting spending. In the view of Massachusetts representative Barney Frank, a democrat, Greenspan injected his ideology into it.

 Bernanke, a top adviser to US President George W. Bush until he was sworn in as Fed chairman on February 1, had already promised to focus strictly on areas pertaining to the central banks dual missions of economic and financial stability.

 I think that it is his decision to make, said Rep. Jim Saxton, a New Jersey republican who chairs the congressional Joint Economic Committee. His reluctance to wade into every controversy in tax and budget policy is certainly very understandable.

 Not everyone, however, applauds Bernankes choice.

 You are our number one economist. You are the person that we all look to for that advice. You cant just sit there and say, Im not going to, said Georgia Democratic Rep. David Scott, voicing disappointment that Bernanke could not be drawn out to criticise Bushs call to make tax cuts permanent.

 But Scott is not alone in wishing Bernanke did not define his mission so narrowly.

 Senate Banking Committee chairman Richard Shelby, an Alabama republican, also believes the Fed chief should have a big portfolio.

 Greg Valliere, chief strategist at the Stanford Washington Research Group, views Bernankes decision as a strategic move to preserve strength as he consolidates power.

 I think hes really going to play it straight for at least a year to establish his credibility, not just within the markets, but within the Fed, he said.

 Valliere likened Bernankes approach to that of former first lady Hillary Clinton, who initially kept a low profile after winning a US Senate seat.

 I think Bernanke has the same strategy: Lets establish a solid reputation before I go voicing my opinion on every subject in the world, he said.

 Despite an effort to stick to his knitting, Bernanke may have nonetheless offered fodder for the political grist mill.

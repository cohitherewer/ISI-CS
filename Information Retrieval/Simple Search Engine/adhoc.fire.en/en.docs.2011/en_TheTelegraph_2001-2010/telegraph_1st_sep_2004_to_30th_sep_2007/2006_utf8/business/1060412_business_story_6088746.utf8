 Calcutta outshines others in gold price

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Rock solid

 Calcutta, April 11: Gold prices breached the Rs 8,900-level in the city today, the highest recorded in the country. The prices here rose by Rs 160 to touch an all-time high of Rs 8,905 per 10 gram, led by a strong global sentiment. 

 In the international market, the yellow metal touched a 25-year high, topping $600 influenced by spiralling crude oil prices and weakening dollar against the euro and other major currencies.

 While the spike was sharpest in Calcutta, gold gained Rs 105 in Mumbai, touching a peak of Rs 8,810 per 10 gram.

 There was no trading in Chennai as the market was closed for Mahavir Jayanti. In the Delhi market, which was closed during the day, there were some off-market deals in which gold rose by Rs 80 to Rs 8,850 per 10 gram, a level never seen before, as stockists enlarged their holdings ahead of official opening tomorrow morning.

 Traders said aggressive buying by stockists sparked the rally. Traders are expecting a further upside in the stock, they pointed out. 

 For instance, a cue came from Bank of France, which said whether to sell gold at the moment was a judgement on market trends. The bank sold 161 tonnes of gold last year. 

 Dealers said France gold sale could be delayed if the bank anticipated prices would go up further.

 Gold closed at Hong Kong at $601.60 an ounce, higher by $5.10 an ounce from yesterdays close of $596.50. It last hit $600 in 1980. 

 Gold hit an all-time high of $873 in January 1980 and was quoted at just $250 in 2001.

 Silver broke the $13-an-ounce-mark for the first time in 20 years, buoyed by the expected launch of a silver-backed exchange fund.

 The bullion markets are ruling firm since last week as retail customers were buying for the coming marriage season beginning from Baisakhi on April 14.

 Investors buy gold as a protection against inflation at a time of advancing oil prices and falling dollar against other leading currencies.

 Gold is rising too fast, but as long as silver keeps going, its hard to say when it will come down, dealers said.

 Gold dealers said volatility across all commodities markets had principally driven investors to gold. 

 Gold is being bought as a hedge against rising oil and commodity prices, they added.

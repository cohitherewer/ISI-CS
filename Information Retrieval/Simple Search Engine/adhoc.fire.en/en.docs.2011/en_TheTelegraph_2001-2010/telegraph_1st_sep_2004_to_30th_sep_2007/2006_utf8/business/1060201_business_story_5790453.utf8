 Snub and slap for Mittal

 Brussels, Jan. 31 (AP): Mittal Steels surprise $22.5-billion offer for Arcelor SA drew scathing criticism from French officials today and an outright rejection from the Luxembourg government ? Arcelors largest shareholder. 

 European Union antitrust chief Neelie Kroes, meanwhile, said she was not in principle opposed to a large steel merger and would meet steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal this week. 

 Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker said today that his government backed Arcelors strategic plan and did not share Mittals view that the combined company could form a European industrial champion.

 We say no to the public offer launched by Mittal for Arcelor, Juncker said. He told the principalitys Parliament that the government, which holds a 5.6 per cent stake in the steelmaker, would not sell its shares to Mittal ? though he did concede that he recognised the bid offered opportunities and he would stay in contact with the company. 

 Mittal told Dow Jones newswires he thought the meeting had been very constructive and he hoped Juncker was softening his opposition to the bid. 

 However, Juncker said the meeting did not convince him to set aside worries about the impact a takeover could have on Arcelor and on Luxembourg where it is based and has 6,000 workers, making it the countrys largest employer.

 He is set to discuss the bid with French President Jacques Chirac tomorrow, but said French and Belgian leaders shared his views. 

 Frances finance minister Thierry Breton disparaged Mittals offer, telling Parliament today that he has never seen such a badly prepared takeover attempt. I have seen many operations like that in my life, said Breton, a former chief executive of France Telecom. But I want to tell you that it is the first time that I have seen one that seems so badly prepared. 

 The takeover bid would create a new behemoth with a nearly 10 per cent share of global steel production and a market capitalisation close to $40 billion. 

 Arcelor, created in 2002 from a merger of French, Luxembourg, Belgian and Spanish steel interests, has warned against its predators irregular profitability, pledging to consider all options to foil the hostile bid. 

 Belgian and Luxembourg leaders meet tomorrow to discuss the deal, but there are no plans to meet Mittal, the Belgian federal government said.

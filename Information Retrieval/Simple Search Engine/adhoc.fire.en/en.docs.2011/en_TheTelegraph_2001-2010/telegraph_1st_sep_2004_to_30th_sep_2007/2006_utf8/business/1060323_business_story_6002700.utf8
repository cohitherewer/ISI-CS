The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Retirement deal signed

 Detroit, March 22 (AFP): GM said today it had reached a deal with its main union in the US to offer an early retirement package to its hourly workers as part of a plan to eliminate 30,000 jobs by 2008.

 The deal was part of an agreement it reached during talks over the restructuring of its bankrupt former parts subsidiary, Delphi Corp and is subject to court approval.

 Under the plan eligible union members at both General Motors and Delphi will be offered a lump sum of $35,000 to take early retirement.

 GM will assume responsibility for the payment to Delphi workers and will also hire about 5,000 Delphi workers who are not eligible.

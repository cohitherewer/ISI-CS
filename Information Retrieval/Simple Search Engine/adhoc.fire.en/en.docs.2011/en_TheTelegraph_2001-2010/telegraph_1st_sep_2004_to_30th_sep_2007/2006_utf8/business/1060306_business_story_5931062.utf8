 GM to sell 20% stake in Suzuki

 EXIT MODE

 Tokyo, March 5 (Reuters): General Motors Corp is planning to sell its 20 per cent stake in Japanese compact car maker Suzuki Motor Corp, the economic daily Nihon Keizai Shimbun (Nikkei) reported on Sunday.

 Suzuki said in a statement that GM and Suzuki will not completely dissolve their capital alliance, adding that the two partners would continue their strong operational co-operation.

 A Suzuki spokesman declined to elaborate on whether that was a denial of the report or whether it could signal a partial dissolution of their tie-up.

 Sources quoted by the Kyodo news agency said it was not immediately clear whether GM planned to sell the entire stake or to whom it planned to sell the shares.

 Analysts have speculated GM might sell its stake in Suzuki as part of a wider asset restructuring by GM, which sold its stake in Fuji Heavy Industries in October.

 According to the Nikkei, which said GMs decision had been conveyed to Suzuki by Saturday, the price of the sale would be some 270 billion yen ($2.33 billion).

 Last month, Suzuki posted a 5.5 per cent rise in quarterly operating profit on brisk vehicle sales worldwide, and reiterated its forecast for higher full-year earnings.

 For the year to March 31, the maker of the Swift compact car stood by its projection for an operating profit of 108 billion yen, which would be 0.4 per cent better than last year and would mark the sixth straight year of record profits.

 Shares in Suzuki, which has been boosting sales of motorcycles and cars in Asia and Europe, rose 4 per cent during the three months to December.

 Earlier, chief executive Rick Wagoner had said General Motors Corp aims to stop losing money in Europe this year, snapping a string of losses since 1999.

 Our objective for 2006 in Europe is to break even or do better, he had said at the Geneva car show. He said this would be before restructuring charges, which he did not expect to be large.

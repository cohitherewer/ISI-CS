The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Jot down the numbers

 It?s surprising how much you can save 

 if you are a bit methodical, says Srikumar Bondyopadhyay 

 For many of us, the money coming 

 in never seems to match the money going out. So, every time 

 the government presents its budget, there?s a deep sense 

 of foreboding and everyone tries to divine the true import 

 of the new tax proposals: will it curb their disposable 

 income, will new excise levies or sales tax jack up the 

 prices of commodities and services of general use? After 

 all, family finances are the biggest source of discontent, 

 disagreement and aggravation at home.

 Family budgeting

 Spend less and save more: it sounds 

 so simple but it?s the most difficult axiom to practise. 

 While trying to gain a measure 

 of control over family finance, you need to do a lot more 

 than just curb that fiendish desire to spend. 

 One also needs to get a fix on 

 one?s short-term and long-term goals ? and gain control 

 over the present to prepare for the future.

 This can best be done by working 

 on a family budget, focusing on how to get the most value 

 out of what you own or buy and save money thereon. And while 

 doing so map a plan for the future. 

 It?s important to jot down all 

 expenses but the paperwork can get so dreary. But it is 

 the only way you can keep an account of the money flows. 

 That?s the most important starting point for any kind of 

 family budgeting.

 Getting started

 Although everybody?s situation 

 is different, a family budgeting exercise should involve 

 all the members of the family, including the teens, and 

 it usually results in an additional 10 to 20 per cent savings 

 on household expenditure. 

 The amount may appear small, but 

 when put away in some interest-bearing instruments, such 

 as a recurring deposit in a bank, a provident fund or a 

 pension fund, it swells into a handsome post-retirement 

 kitty.

 Now, the question is where to 

 start?

 Begin by figuring out the average 

 monthly inflow of cash. Once you get a picture of the cash 

 flows, turn to money outflow.

 Add up the regular and non-discretionary 

 monthly expenses such as electricity bills, telephone bills, 

 groceries, payments for water and sewerage and house rents 

 or mortgage loan payments for the past few months. Arrive 

 at the monthly average figure by dividing the total with 

 the number of months. 

 Follow the same procedure to find 

 out the monthly average discretionary expenses, such as 

 family entertainment, guests and travelling. You can provide 

 for another 5 to 10 per cent for emergencies.

 Summing up these two categories 

 of expenditure you get a fair idea of how much money is 

 likely to go out every month.

 Control exercise

 The task is now to look for expenditure 

 heads where the money outgo can be reduced. 

 At this point, it is advisable 

 to involve all family members, including the children. They 

 can play a big role in deciding on the expenditure that 

 can be reduced. 

 More often than not, children 

 come up with useful contributions. For example, if we can 

 make our children understand that wasting electricity and 

 water every month can be as costly as two comic books, they 

 will always remember to switch off the fan or the light 

 whenever they are going out of the room. You can buy them 

 a comic book as an incentive!

 By involving children in the process 

 of family budgeting, you also inculcate financial responsibility 

 in them since childhood. It makes them financially disciplined 

 in their own lives. 

 Elders can eliminate wastage by 

 not putting large sums in things that are rarely used. 

 Cash count

 Money can be saved by paying for 

 articles in cash. 

 By making payments in cash, you 

 can always bargain for a discount. Credit card payments 

 not only add to your debt and interest outgo, it often entails 

 a service charge by the card issuer. 

 Though debit card payments don?t 

 have the debt component, but too many withdrawals from your 

 savings account with the plastic can attract a service charge.

 Make good use of discount coupons, 

 promotional offers and lean period exchange offers while 

 going in for household purchases. 

 It may sound silly, but these 

 save money. 

 With the healthcare cost increasing 

 by leaps and bounds, make sure that you get a medical insurance 

 for yourself and your family. 

 A low-cost medical insurance gives 

 financial protection from huge unforeseen medical expenses.

 Budget allocation

 At the beginning of every month, 

 earmark a sum equivalent to the average monthly expenditure 

 you have arrived at before. 

 Pay the bills for nondiscretionary 

 items first and write down the payment amount against each 

 bill. 

 While paying for nondiscretionary 

 items, try to get a discount by paying in cash. Accounts 

 for these payments must also be maintained. 

 At the end of the month, you not 

 only get the picture of your total household expenses for 

 the past 30 days but also you and your family can see for 

 yourselves which expenses can be reduced next month. 

 In the process, you will soon 

 find your family expenditure account still has some cash 

 left over at the end of every month. 

 That?s your savings.

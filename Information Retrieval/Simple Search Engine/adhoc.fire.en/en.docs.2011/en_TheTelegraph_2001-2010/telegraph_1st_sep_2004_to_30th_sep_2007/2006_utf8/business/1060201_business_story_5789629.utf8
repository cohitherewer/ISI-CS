 New Delhi, Jan. 31: Samsung India has set a 20 per cent growth target for its flat panel televisions, digital media products and home appliances business during the calendar year 2006.

 Year 2006 will mark a consolidation phase and we will focus on these three segments in a big way, said Ravinder Zutshi, deputy managing director, Samsung India.

 The company, which clocked a revenue of Rs 4,900 crore in 2004, is eyeing a 30 per cent growth in 2005.

 Samsung India, which sold 1.5 million colour televisions (CTVs) last year and recorded a 100 per cent jump in flat TV sales last year, aims to sell 1.8 million CTVs this year.

 Accordingly, the company plans to enhance its SlimFit line-up by starting the production at its Noida facility by the end of February. The SlimFit range, which is available in 32 inch and 29 inch, will also have 21-inch sets.

 Meanwhile, Samsung India today launched six LCD models in the screen sizes between 20 inch and 46 inch.

 The company plans to increase its market share in Flat TVs from 22.5 per cent to 30 per cent by 2006 end and in case of Flat Panel TVs to 50 per cent by the year end, said Zutshi.

 With the introduction of the new range, Samsung LCD TVs will be available at a price tag ranging between Rs 44,990 to Rs 3,99,000.

 The company also plans to strengthen its focus on air-conditioners and washing machines in 2006.

 Last week, it launched 19 models of ACs across window, split and tower categories. The company has invested $5 million in moulds for the new AC range. Samsung aims to increase its market share in ACs from 20 per cent in 2005 to 28 per cent in 2006.

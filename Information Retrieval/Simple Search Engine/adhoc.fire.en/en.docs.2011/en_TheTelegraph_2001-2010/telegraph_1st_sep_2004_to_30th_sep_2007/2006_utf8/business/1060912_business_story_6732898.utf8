 New Delhi, Sept. 11: The automobile industry saw a double-digit growth in passenger car sales at 16.01 per cent in August, even as motorcycle sales hit the slow lane, growing by only 3.43 per cent.

 Figures released by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam) showed 83,844 passenger cars were sold in August against 72,272 in the same month last year.

 Tata Motors clocked a 25.6 per cent growth by selling 14,090 vehicles against 11,218 in the year-ago period.

 Maruti Udyog Limited had the largest sales volume at 41,728 cars in August against 31,117 in the corresponding period last year, registering a growth of 15.55 per cent.

 Korean car firm Hyundai Motor India also registered a growth of 8.51 per cent during the month at 16,067 vehicles compared with 14,806 in the corresponding period last year.

 Motorcycle sales growth, however, skidded to 3.43 per cent during the month at 4,70,955 units. In contrast, motorcycle sales grew by 13.4 per cent in July this year from the same month last year.

 The drop in growth was mainly on account of Hero Honda, whose sales during the month declined by 15.91 per cent to 2,00,208 motorcycles from 2,38,104 in the same month last year.

 Around 72,391 scooters were sold in August compared with 76,426 in the same period last year, down 5.27 per cent. The dip in sales was mainly on account of Bajaj Auto, which sold just 1,442 units during August compared with 14,351 in the same month last year.

 Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India maintained its positive growth trend at 38,094 scooters compared with 31,905 in the year-ago period, up 19.39 per cent.

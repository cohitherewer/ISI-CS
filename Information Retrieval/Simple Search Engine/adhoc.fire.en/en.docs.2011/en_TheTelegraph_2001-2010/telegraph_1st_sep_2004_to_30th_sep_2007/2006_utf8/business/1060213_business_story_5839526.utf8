 STC lines up retail food foray

 SHOPPER'S DELIGHT

 Calcutta, Feb. 12: The State Trading Corporation of India (STC) is gearing up to market retail food products in a big way next fiscal as part of its golden jubilee celebrations.

 STC branded products would be so competitively priced that other players would be forced to bring down their rates, said B.R. Meena, chief general manager, retail marketing.

 Initially, items like iodised salt, edible oil, rice, pulses and Madhya Pradesh-grown sarbati wheat will be introduced.

 We will operate on a thin margin to uphold the social objective of the public sector. We expect to gross a turnover of Rs 500 crore at the end of the first year of retail operations, Meena told The Telegraph.

 Meena said marketing companies procure raw salt at 10 paise a kg and after processing, packaging and transporting, sell the finished product at Rs 5 to 10 per kg. But STC will price its branded salt at Rs 3 per kg. A similar pricing policy would be adopted for all other branded products, he said.

 The public-sector outfit created in 1956 primarily for overseas marketing ? both importing and exporting essential and restricted commodities, has registered the STC logo and brand for marketing a host of edible items in the domestic market.

 The company has already registered about 1700 retailers from its 2000 employees, who have retired or took voluntary retirement, to market these products. Other young entrepreneurs would also be encouraged to partner STC for selling its products on a cash-and-carry basis.

 Meena said STC has tied up with a financial institution to provide vehicles to its retailers on easy terms. It will set up central stores in various cities from where products will be delivered to retailers, who will then directly sell to the customers at a margin to be fixed by STC.

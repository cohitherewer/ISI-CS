 China has lot to complain about

 Beijing, March 16 (PTI): China today charged India with raising trade obstacles, including slapping of over 90 anti-dumping duties on Chinese goods and not granting market economy status to the worlds third largest trading nation.

 The major problems in Sino-Indian bilateral economic and trade co-operation are Indias frequent probe into our products, such as anti-dumping investigations and examination of safeguard and special safeguard measures, spokesman for the Chinese ministry of commerce Chong Quan said.

 India has initiated over 90 anti-dumping investigations into Chinese products, two on safeguard measures and one on special safeguard measures, with an involved value of $720 million, Chong said.

 His comments came as Chinese commerce minister Bo Xilai held talks with his Indian counterpart Kamal Nath in New Delhi.

 This is Bos first delegation visit to a foreign country in 2006. Choosing India as the destination country indicates that China attaches great importance to the Sino-Indian bilateral economic and trade cooperation, the spokesman said. India has also not granted market economy status to China, which joined the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in 2001, he noted. 

 Chong said Chinese enterprises have faced hurdles in India, despite Beijing encouraging Chinese companies to do business in India. He said Chinese enterprises are active in developing the Indian market and expanding the scope of economic and trade co-operation between the two countries.

 Chinese enterprises have a lot of complaints, especially about the difficult application for a visa to India and permission to trade with India, Chong said.

 He said Chinese nationals find it difficult to obtain a visa. It takes too long to get a work visa, while a business visa is issued for a short duration with no provisions for extension.

 Chong said trade with India has maintained a strong growth momentum, with China matching Indias edge in information technology (IT) with its manufacturing capabilities. 

 He said India is more competitive in minerals, steel and gold products, jewels, pharmaceuticals and chemicals, while China scores high in the areas of machinery and electronic products, communication items and computers.

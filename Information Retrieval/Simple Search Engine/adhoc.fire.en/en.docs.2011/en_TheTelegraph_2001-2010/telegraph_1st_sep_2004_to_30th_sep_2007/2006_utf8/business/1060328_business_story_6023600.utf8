 Fed gears up for rate hike

 Washington, March 27 (Reuters): Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke leads his first policy meeting this week.

 The meeting, which is certain to end with another US interest-rate increase and perhaps a suggestion of a 21-month run of credit tightening, is almost over.

 Analysts expect the Federal Open Market Committee, gathering in Washington on Monday and Tuesday, to lift the benchmark federal funds rate to 4.75 per cent.

 This would mark a 15th straight quarter-point hike since June 2004, when the US central bank began a gradual campaign to boost interest rates from an ultra-low one per cent to keep inflation from flaring up.

 Policy-makers may also tweak their accompanying policy statement, due at 2:15 p.m. on Tuesday, to signal a halt in rate hikes around mid-year, some economists say.

 Some analysts fear the cumulative increase in borrowing costs is already weighing on the US economy and Tuesdays hike would be the last in the campaign.

 I think we are very close to seeing the end, said Lynn Reaser, chief economist at Bank of America Capital Management in Boston.

 But market players see a bit more ahead. Financial futures prices show a better-than-even chance of a federal funds rate of five per cent by May and give even shorter odds of rates at this level by July. Either way, the cycle looks nearly done.

 They are likely to acknowledge the firmer (economic) data since the January meeting ... If they only do that, its likely to be taken as a pretty hawkish statement, said Dean Maki, chief US economist at Barclays Capital in New York.

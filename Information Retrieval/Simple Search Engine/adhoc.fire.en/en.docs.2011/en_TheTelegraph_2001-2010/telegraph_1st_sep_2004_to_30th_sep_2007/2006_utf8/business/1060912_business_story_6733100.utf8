 Trai stand on roaming calls

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 11: The telecom regulator has refused to allow an additional revenue sharing arrangement between visiting and terminating network service providers for roaming calls on national and international networks. 

 There is no justification for a revenue sharing arrangement among operators for roaming calls (national amp; international). The terminating operator should get only the termination charge as prescribed in the IUC regulation, said the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai). 

 Permitting revenue share between visiting and terminating network service providers would distort the market and could lead to a hike in roaming tariff for the end consumer, it added. 

 At present, while on roaming, the customer is outside the home network, and the terminating network gets 30 paise per minute. 

 For instance, when a Delhi Hutch subscriber roams in Mumbai on Airtel, the revenue from the calls the user makes is earned by the Mumbai operator on whose network one is roaming, while the Delhi operator gets only terminating charges. 

 In this case, Hutch, which is the termination network service provider gets 30 paise per minute for the call, and Airtel, which is the visiting network service provider, gets the pre-determined normal roaming charges. 

 Earlier, PSUs Bharat Sanchar Nigam and Mahanagar Telephone Nigam had called for revenue sharing between operators for roaming customers, over and above the fixed 30-paise-per-minute charge.

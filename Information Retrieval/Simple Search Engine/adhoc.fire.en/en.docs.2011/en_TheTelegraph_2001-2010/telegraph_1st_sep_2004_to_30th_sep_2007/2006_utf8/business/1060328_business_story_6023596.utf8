 Goldman mulls AB Port bid

 London, March 27 (Reuters): A consortium, including Goldman Sachs and investment groups from Canada and Singapore, is considering a bid for Associated British Ports, sending shares in UKs biggest ports group to new highs. 

 Goldman Sachs said on Monday it was working with partners on a possible bid that analysts said could value the owner of 21 UK ports at more than ?2 billion, but there was no certainty an offer would be made. 

 The US Investment Bank said it had teamed up with Borealis, the investment vehicle of Ontario pension fund OMERS, and GIC Special Investments, the private equity arm of the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation. 

 The potential bid follows last years $6.8-billion (?3.9 billion) takeover of P amp; and a string of mergers and acquisitions in Europes ports industry as shipping markets bask in a three-year boom on the back of growth in Chinese demand. Analysts believe rival bids for AB Ports could emerge. 

 Given its No.1 market position in the UK, strong cash flow, available financial headroom and further potential to exploit the significant property holdings, we believe the assets are attractive to third parties, Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein told clients in a note. 

 Earlier on Monday, the City A.M. newspaper quoted an unidentified high-level source as saying the consortium was working on a 740-pence-a-share bid for AB Ports worth at about ?2.3 billion. 

 Analysts were split on how much AB Ports would benefit from budget measures announced last week to put property assets into a tax-saving real estate investment trust (REIT). JP Morgan said AB Ports had sold most of the property it owned that could have fitted into that category. 

 A source familiar with the situation said AB Ports was still working out how much it could benefit from the measures. 

 It has 21 UK ports, including Hull and Plymouth. It also has four port operations in the US. The firm said on Monday it had not received a bid proposal but noted Goldman Sachs announcement. 

 The consortiums considerations are at a preliminary stage, and there can be no assurance that any offer will be made, Goldman Sachs said earlier in a statement. 

 JP Morgan said a 740p bid would give AB Ports an enterprise value of 13.7 times its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA), compared with 13.4 for the P amp; bid. 

 Panmure Gordon analysts said AB Ports could be worth more to investors as a quoted company if it could take advantage of the REITs proposals, which are expected to come into force in January.

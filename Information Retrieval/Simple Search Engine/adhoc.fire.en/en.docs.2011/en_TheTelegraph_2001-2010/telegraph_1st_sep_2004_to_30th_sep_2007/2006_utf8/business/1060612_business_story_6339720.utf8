 Cognizant to up staff strength

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Job opportunity

 Calcutta, June 11: With around 50 per cent growth in the last 10 quarters, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation plans to recruit 700 professionals in Calcutta in the next eight months. It has booked an additional 100,000-sq-ft plug and play facility at Sector V in Salt Lake. The company has 2,500 employees at its city development centres.

 The rise in headcount will be in keeping with Cognizants plan to become a 35,000-strong company internationally by the end of 2006, said Lakshmi Narayanan, president and CEO.

 The company had recruited 2,400 people in the quarter ended March 2006 to take its global headcount to 26,750.

 Cognizant operates from a 200,000-sq-ft office and intends to move some of its projects to the 100,000-sq-ft facility in July. It will then have the option to take on an additional 50,000-sq-ft office space.

 Cognizant plans to become a billion-dollar-company by the end of the year with a revised full-year revenue guidance of at least $1.3 billion, indicating a 47 per cent growth over 2005. 

 As Cognizant recruits more than 85 per cent of its employees from India, this could translate into the recruitment of approximately 7,000 professionals in the next eight months across its seven development centres in Chennai, Calcutta, Pune, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Mumbai and Coimbatore.

 There are three primary growth drivers, telecom, media and entertainment and new technology, Narayanan said. Also, we are witnessing a strong demand for strategic applications development initiatives.

 The company posted a revenue of $285.5 million in the first quarter of 2006, up 11 per cent from $256.9 million in the year-ago period.

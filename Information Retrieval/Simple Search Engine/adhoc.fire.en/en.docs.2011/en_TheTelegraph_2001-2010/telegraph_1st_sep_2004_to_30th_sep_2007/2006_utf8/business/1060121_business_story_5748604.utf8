 Grand airline alliance in the air

 Mumbai, Jan. 20 (PTI): Close on the heels of Jet Airwayss acquisition of Air Sahara, four low-cost airlines ? Air Deccan, GoAir, Indigo and Kingfisher ? are exploring the possibility of using a common platform to reduce operating costs by sharing the infrastructure. 

 We have met and discussed the possibility of forming some sort of alliance...But it is not called a forum or union or something...It is a kind of code-sharing on how we can utilise manpower, infrastructure and cut cost, Kingfisher Airlines chief Vijay Mallya said. 

 Air Deccan managing director Captain Gopinath said the four low-cost players have mooted the idea of coming on a single platform to share views as well as find solutions to similar problems of the trade.

 On January 17, Gopinath had refuted that any such alliance was in the making and expressed the need for a Nasscom-like body to confront the change in market dynamics. 

 Meanwhile, Mallya has registered a company called Kingfisher International in the US and aims to start operations by mid-2007.

 We have registered a company in the name of Kingfisher International in the US and we will be flying to India and other international destinations, provided we get all necessary approvals at the right time, Mallya told reporters here.

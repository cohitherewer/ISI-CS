 Rules ready for banks to sell assets

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Finding a way

 Mumbai, Feb. 2: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) today announced detailed guidelines that will enable banks to sell their retail performing assets such as housing, automobile or consumer durable loans to third-party investors.

 This process is known as securitisation in industry parlance.

 The central bank has stipulated that commercial banks entering into such deals will have to maintain a distance with the special purpose vehicle (SPV), the entity specifically created for this purpose. The investors in an SPV are principally mutual funds, insurance companies and, in some cases, banks.

 According to the RBI?s securitisation guidelines, the originators of the securitisation ? banks that are spinning off the loans from their books ? will not hold any beneficial or economic interest in the asset after its sale to the SPV.

 Securitisation is a process through which performing assets are packaged, converted into tradable securities and sold to third-party investors. On the other hand, an SPV is an entity specifically created for the securitisation deal. While securitisation has come a long way in India, bankers were keenly waiting for the RBI to frame the relevant guidelines.

 Securitisation has so far been the domain of private sector and foreign banks with nationalised banks largely staying away. Of late, leading PSU banks like the State Bank of India (SBI) have indicated their interest in resorting to securitisation.

 Banks love securitisation as it frees them from the obligation of locking up vital capital. At present, according to RBI regulations, banks have to make a provision of 0.40 per cent on standard assets. Therefore, after a bank undertakes securitisation, it will not be required to maintain any capital against the value of assets that are transferred.

 Announcing the detailed guidelines today, the RBI specified that the SPV should be ?bankruptcy remote?. This means the entity is unlikely to be subjected to voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy proceedings by the originator or its creditors.

 The RBI said the isolation of assets from the originator to the SPV is an ?essential prerequisite? so that the transferred assets are removed from the balance sheet of the originator (bank) in a securitisation structure.

 Detailing the criteria for the true sale of assets, the central bank said the sale should result in immediate legal separation of the originator from the assets which are sold to the new owner (SPV).

 New Delhi, Jan. 13: Suzuki Motorcycles today unveiled two bikes ? the Heat and the Zeus ? for the mass market in India and said it would leverage Maruti Udyogs dealer and communications network to shore up sales.

 The company also announced its intentions to enter the scooter market in India.

 The relationship between MUL and Suzuki Motorcycles is like a tunnel. Customers who enter at one end will be captured by Maruti at the other and it wont let them go anywhere. Both Maruti and we are committed to enhancing the brand nework, said Satya Sheel, managing director of Suzuki Motorcycles India Private Limited (SMIPL).

 We will use the vendor network of Maruti. We are both Suzuki companies and will certainly use the marketing and information network of Maruti, said Sheel.

 The two 125-cc motorcycles would be commercially launched in India by March this year. While the Heat is targeted at the rural and semi-urban market, the Zeus is for young college students and executives.

 The motorcycles, which the company says will have outstanding fuel efficiency, will be available in three colours and will have features such as round crank shaft, aluminium cylinder head, five-gear transmission and bigger brake drums.

 While the Heat has been tentatively priced at Rs 37,893 (ex-showroom Delhi), Sheel said the Zeus would be competitively priced.

 The company has already invested about Rs 200 crore at its Gurgaon facility with a production capacity of about one lakh units on a single shift basis. The company will also appoint 70 dealers covering 300 towns.

 The capacity can be ramped up significantly as demand picks up, Sheel said and added that the first set of motorcycles was expected to be booked across key cities in the country as the dealer network was already in place.

 The re-entry of Suzuki to sell bikes in India after it parted ways with Indian partner TVS in 2001 will offer more option to customers.

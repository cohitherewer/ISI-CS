 Court blow to Anil

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, April 21: Delhi High Court has ruled in favour of the government in its choice of private partners to modernise Delhi and Mumbai airports. 

 A division bench, comprising Justice Tirath Singh Thakur and Justice B.N. Chaturvedi, has dismissed the petition of Anil Ambanis Reliance Airport Developers as there was no merit in the charge that the tender process was arbitrary.

 Reliance Airport was given two weeks to file an appeal against the ruling before the Supreme Court. Officials from Reliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group did not react to the order. However, sources said the company may move the Supreme Court.

 We welcome and will abide by the judgment of the high court, civil aviation minister Praful Patel said. Reliance Airport alleged that the tenders were changed arbitrarily at the last moment without any prior notice.

 The government said there was no room for complaint as the company itself got into fray after the rules were relaxed. The government also denied charges of favouritism by Reliance Airport.

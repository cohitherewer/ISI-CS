 Tea auction snarl stains MNCs

 Calcutta, May 21: IT titans IBM and Accenture are partly responsible for the failure of the e-auction system in tea, minister of state for commerce and industry Jairam Ramesh said at the Tea Board meeting here today.

 If the contract permitted, I would have loved to take legal action against these two IT majors. The software development has been a complete disaster. Their failure has cost us a year and made us go back on the whole e-auction process which has to be redesigned and will take another year to do so, Ramesh said.

 He said the job to develop the software has now been assigned to NSE.IT Limited ? the third vendor to get the mandate after IBM and Accenture. The minister expects the system to be up and running in about a year.

 Tea Board chairman Basudeb Banerjee said the board had revoked the bank guarantee of IBM and made only a part payment to Accenture.

 The board envisaged linking the six auction centres of the country ? Calcutta, Siliguri, Guwahati, Conoor, Coimbatore and Kochi ? through the electronic auction system by March 2005, which has proved to be elusive.

 Calcutta has turned out to be a laggard in implementing the system. Even the 200 laptops assigned to the city auction centre is lying packed. Ramesh said he would come back on June 20 and make sure the cases have been unpacked and the laptops at least have been made operational. The plan is to start working on the off-line aspects of the process at that time. 

 The minister said disbursements under the special purpose tea fund would start from November. About 50 per cent of the proceeds will be allocated to Assam, while Bengal and South India will get 25 per cent each.

 The export target for this fiscal is 200 million kg compared with 181 million kg last year. 

 The focus areas are Pakistan, Iran and Egypt, the minister said.

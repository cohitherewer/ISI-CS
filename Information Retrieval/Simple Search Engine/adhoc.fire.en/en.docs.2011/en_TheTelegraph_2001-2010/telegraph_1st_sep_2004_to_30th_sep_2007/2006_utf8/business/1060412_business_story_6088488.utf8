 JD Power ranks MRF as best in tyres

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 11: JD Power Asia Pacific has awarded MRF the top spot in its tyre customer satisfaction index study for 2006.

 The study, now in its sixth year, has ranked MRF first four times. The report analyses perceptions of new-vehicle buyers in five areas: appearance of tyre, durability, ride quality, traction and handling.

 MRFs comeback to the top position is supported by industry benchmark performance on all five factors evaluated in the study, said Mohit Arora, India director at J.D. Power Asia Pacific in Singapore.

 As a result, MRF has the industrys highest proportion (60 per cent) of customers indicating that they would definitely repurchase the same brand when the time comes for replacing their original tyres, he added.

 According to the report, the 2006 industry average score of 789 index points (on a 1,000-point scale) is an improvement of 18 points from 2005. This is largely based on gains for MRF and JK Tyre, which together account for more than two-fifths of the total industry.

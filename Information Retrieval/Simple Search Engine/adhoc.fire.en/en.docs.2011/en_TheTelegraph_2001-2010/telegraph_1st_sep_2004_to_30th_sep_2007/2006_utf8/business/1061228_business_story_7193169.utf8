 Mumbai, Dec. 27: As the year draws to close, the sensex shows all the signs of clambering to its highest peak rounding off an incredible journey with returns in excess of 44 per cent for the year.

 The close of 2006 should see the sensex and the Nifty at their peaks of 14000 and 4000 respectively, said a fund manager.

 The sensex had crossed the 14,000 mark on December 5 and hit an all-time intra-day peak of 14028.47, while Nifty had breached the 4000 mark on December 1 to hit an intra-day at 4001.30.

 Beginning the day on a strong note, the bellwether index today settled 151.35 points, or 1.10 per cent, higher at 13859.69 from yesterdays close of 13708.34 . It breached the 13900 level during the session and hit a high of 13911.59 in the late afternoon session.

 After yesterdays surge of 237 points, the sensex today opened with an upward gap of 13734.01 and closed at its two-week high on renewed buying riding on firm global advices and high expectations about third quarter results. 

 From a close of 13340.21 on December 20, the bellwether index has gained 519.48 points in the four straight sessions.

 The Nifty also winched gradually closer to the 4000 level and ended 33.75 points or 0.86 per cent higher at 3974.25 from previous close of 3940.50.

 Brokers attributed todays rally to short-covering ahead of the expiry of December futures contracts though they expect some volatility tomorrow when the contracts expires. Domestic mutual funds were believed to be heavy buyers at the prevailing levels. They pumped in Rs 1,101 crore last week.

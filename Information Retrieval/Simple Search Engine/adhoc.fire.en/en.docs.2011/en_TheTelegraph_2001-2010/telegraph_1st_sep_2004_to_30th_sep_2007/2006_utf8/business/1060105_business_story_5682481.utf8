 RBI readies bond bait for retail investors

 OUR BUREAU

 Close watch

 Mumbai, Jan. 4: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) today decided to earmark 5 per cent in select issues of government bonds for retail investors under a non-competitive bidding facility.

 The facility has been devised to encourage wider participation of retail holding of government securities, the RBI said in a notification issued today.

 Retail investors who do not put in a single bid valued at over Rs 2 crore (face value) per auction will be eligible to bid under this facility. They must not maintain a current account (CA) or subsidiary general ledger (SGL) account with the Reserve Bank of India. They will have to submit their bids indirectly through any bank or primary dealer (PD) offering this scheme.

 Participation on a non-competitive basis will be open to any person, including firms, companies, corporate bodies, institutions, provident funds, trusts and any other entity as may be prescribed by the RBI. The minimum amount for bidding will be Rs 10,000 (face value) and thereafter in multiples in Rs 10,000.

 An investor will be allowed to make only a single bid under this scheme. An undertaking to this effect will have to be obtained and kept on record by the bank or PD.

 Each bank or PD, on the basis of firm orders received from their constituents, may submit application-wise bids through the negotiated dealing system (NDS). The firm orders received from others (i.e. non-constituents) may be submitted in physical application forms to the public debt office (PDO). The physical application may be a single bid for the aggregate amount of all customers. Particulars of individual customers and amount must be provided as an annexure to the bid.

 Allotment under the non-competitive segment to the bank or PD will be at the weighted average rate of yield/price that will emerge in the auction on the basis of the competitive bidding. The securities will be issued to the bank or PD against payment on the date of issue, irrespective of whether the bank or PD has received payment from their clients.

 In case the aggregate amount of bid is more than the reserved amount (5 per cent of notified amount), pro rata allotment will be made. In case of partial allotments, it will be the responsibility of the bank or PD to appropriately allocate securities to their clients in a transparent manner. In case the aggregate amount of bids is less than the reserved amount, the shortfall will be taken to competitive portion. The bank or the PD will have to pass on the securities to their clients. 

 The bank or PD will be allowed to recover up to six paise per Rs 100 as brokerage/ commission/service charges for this service to their clients. Such costs may be built into the sale price or recovered separately from the clients. 

 The facility will open on January 9 when the RBI intends to re-issue two gilt issues: the 10-year 9.39 per cent government stock 2011 for an aggregate amount of Rs 6000 crore, and the 7.4 per cent government stock 2035 for Rs 4000 crore.

 Apollo scraps public offer

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 4: The board of Apollo Tyres today decided to abandon a planned rights-cum-public issue. The company now plans to raise funds to the tune of Rs 365 crore through placements to qualified institutional buyers (QIBs) and a preferential allotment to the promoters.

 The promoters currently hold about 39.25 per cent in the company.

 The money raised will be used to fund expansion and to beef up the operations of the recently-acquired Dunlop South Africa. 

 In May this year, Apollo Tyres had decided to come out with a 1:6 rights issue but deferred it in July.

 In a statement issued today, the company said the board, on the recommendations of lead managers, decided in favour of QIBs in accordance with Sebi guidelines issued in May 2006. This option allows access to capital markets through a simpler and quicker process.

 However, the company will not raise an amount exceeding Rs 250 crore through private placement to qualified institutional placements. 

 The tyre major will also issue 40 lakh warrants to the promoters through a preferential allotment.

 The board also approved the formation of a committee of directors and company officials, who will be responsible for selling Apollo Tyres tube manufacturing facility in Ranjangaon, Pune.

 The shareholders gave approval to the sale of this unit last year after the board took a decision to consolidate its core strength of manufacturing tyres.

 Apollo Tyres recently announced its plans to set up a Rs 520-crore automobile tyre manufacturing plant near Chennai. The company has entered into an agreement with the Tamil Nadu government to set up the project, which would generate employment for over 2,000 persons.

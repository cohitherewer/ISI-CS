 Vanaspati import to be regulated

 New Delhi, June 3 (PTI): The government has decided to regulate imports of vanaspati oil from Sri Lanka and has appointed agri co-operative NAFED as the sole agency for such imports.

 Import of vanaspati under the Indo-Sri Lanka free trade agreement shall be made only by the National Agricultural Co-operative Marketing Federation of India Ltd, the directorate-general of foreign trade said in a notification.

 The import of vanaspati (hydrogenated vegetable oil) also includes bakery shortening and margarine. 

 The decision follows demands from domestic manufacturers that zero duty imports from the island country was hampering the local industry.

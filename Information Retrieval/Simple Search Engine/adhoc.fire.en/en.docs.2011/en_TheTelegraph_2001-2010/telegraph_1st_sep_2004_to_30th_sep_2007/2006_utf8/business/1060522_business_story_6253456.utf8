 Interest cost to pierce cash bubble

 Market woes

 This isn?t the first time in the three-year rally that the markets have been badly bruised. It happened in May 2004, in January and March 2005, while the last time it crashed was in October last year. Each time, the fall was global, although it was, as in the May 2004 crash, exacerbated by local factors. This time, the Indonesian market declined almost as much as the sensex in the last week, while commodity-heavy markets such as Russia have been hit even harder. The worry boiled down to one overriding factor ? whether rising interest rates would burst the global liquidity bubble. This time too, the story is no different. The income tax department may have handled the capital gains issue ineptly, the Left may have shot off its mouth indiscreetly but at bottom this has nothing to do with the fall in stock prices. The trigger this time came from a sharp sell-off in metals as copper and aluminium prices tumbled dragging down commodity stocks with them. And since all asset markets are now interlinked, selling in any one of them has a cascading effect on all markets.

 Many FIIs in India run their own proprietary trading books where they use their own funds for taking positions. They saw an opportunity for making money when local punters pushed up the price of futures so that they were trading at a sizeable premium over the cash market. This led to a risk-free opportunity for making money by buying cash and selling futures. At a later date, all they had to do was unwind the earlier trade by selling in the cash market and buying the futures. This is precisely what happened.

 Global liquidity during the three-year bull run is the result of central banks pumping in money into their economies and keeping interest rates extraordinarily low. That cycle has certainly turned. The yield on the US 10-year treasury note is around 5.06 per cent. That?s well above the earlier bouts of stock market volatility that occurred whenever the 10-year rate went above 4.5 per cent, as in October last year. More significantly, for the last four years the Bank of Japan has been injecting 35 trillion yen ($420 billion) into the monetary system per day. That has now come down to about 14 trillion a day and the bank has signalled its intention to lower it further. In short, significant sources of global liquidity are drying up. At the same time, the Japanese economy is picking up steam, which means that the liquidity will be used in the real economy, leaving even less for the markets.

 The consensus view so far has been that globalisation, by integrating countries such as India, China and Russia into the world economy, has created new sources of cheap supply which will keep labour and finished goods products down, while at the same time adding new demand. This was expected to keep a lid on inflation, in spite of rising commodity prices caused by the new demand. Similar benign situations have occurred before, notably in the late nineteenth century, as the US developed and expanded westwards.

 The trouble is that the excesses of the past few years have led to valuations going sky-high. At the slightest hint of panic, risk aversion returns ? JP Morgan?s Emerging Markets Bond Index Plus (EMBI+) seen as a key gauge of investors? aversion to risk ? widened more than 30 basis points during six out of the past seven sessions. Another worry is that the US housing market, which has been the source of the wealth effect among US consumers, has started to cool off.

 Asset markets had moved higher over the last few months not because global liquidity was rising but because the overhang of previously created liquidity was still in the system. The correction has been sharp and markets in the West have already shown signs of reaching a bottom. But any bounce back will have to contend, sooner or later, with the ebb tide of global liquidity.

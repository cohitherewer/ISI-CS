 Samsung-Sony unit to produce more flat TVs 

 Big show

 Seoul, April 10 (Reuters): South Koreas Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Japans Sony Corp have agreed to a $2-billion expansion of a liquid crystal display (LCD) plant, seeking a greater share of the booming flat-screen TV sales.

 The companies already run a $2-billion joint venture, S-LCD Corp, in South Korea to produce the panels.

 The expansion allows Samsung, the worlds second-biggest maker of large-sized LCD last year, to use Sonys brand power to expand the market for larger television panels.

 Analysts also have been expecting Sony, Japans second-largest consumer electronics maker after Matsushita Electric Industrial Co, to invest in new production capacity to secure panels for its new line-up of Bravia brand LCD TVs, which have made big strides in grabbing market share in the United States and Japan.

 Panel supply was a key reason behind Sonys rise to the top spot in LCD TVs in the fourth quarter of 2005.

 Samsung and Sony have seen lots of benefits by co-operating, creating the market together and enjoying higher margins in 40-inch TV panels, said Lee Min-hee, an analyst at CJ Investment amp; Securities. They want to do it again for the bigger-sized panels through the new deal.

 The move comes after Taiwans AU Optronics Corp, the third-biggest LCD maker, announced on Friday it would acquire smaller local rival Quanta Display Inc.

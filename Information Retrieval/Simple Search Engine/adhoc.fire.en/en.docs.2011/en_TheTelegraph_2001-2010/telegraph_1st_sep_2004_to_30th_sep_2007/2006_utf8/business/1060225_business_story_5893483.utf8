 Chambers praise Lalu sops

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 24: India Inc today said the railway budget for 2006-07 will not only help garner more revenue but also attract huge traffic for the railways. Terming the railway budget as pragmatic and user-friendly, industry associations said it stands out as an instrument for overall regeneration through modernisation and technological upgradation.

 The budget is based on sound and forward-looking economic principles. With the operating ratio expected to be 84.3 per cent in 2006-07 against 90.8 per cent in 2005-06, the financial health of Indian Railways is expected to improve, said S.K. Poddar, president of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci).

 A reduction in passenger fares in air conditioned classes will equip the railways to compete with the low budget airlines, he added.

 The industry also felt that railway minister Lalu Prasad has adopted a pragmatic freight policy by lowering the number of classes of commodities and introducing non-peak traffic discounts.

 A substantial increase in freight traffic to 668 metric tonnes (mt) from 600 mt shows a growing industry confidence, the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) said.

 New initiatives such as freight and loyalty discount schemes and non-peak season freight discount will make the railways more competitive, CII said. The chamber hoped against any increase in freight rates during the fiscal as such a raise has been noticed in the past.

 India Inc also welcomed the dedicated multi-modal high-axle freight corridors. These would have a computerised freight movement. The project on completion should be able to metamorphose the Indian railway system, CII said.

 The freight corridor, which would be developed in two phases with an investment of Rs 22,000 crore, would add a new dimension to the freight movement by the railways in the country, said the chamber.

 Meanwhile, industry welcomed the new targets set this year to complete 1100 km of gauge conversion and double the 435 km of track. This would enhance the carrying capacity of the railways.

 The Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry in India (Assocham) said the growth from Rs 250 crore in 2001 to Rs 11,000 crore in 2005 in railway finances is a major turnaround.

 Anil K. Agarwal, president, Assocham hailed the privatisation of container services from April 1, private participation in railway services and a long-term freight discount.

 The Indian industry also welcomed the reduction in fares of AC first class by 18 per cent and AC second class by 10 per cent.

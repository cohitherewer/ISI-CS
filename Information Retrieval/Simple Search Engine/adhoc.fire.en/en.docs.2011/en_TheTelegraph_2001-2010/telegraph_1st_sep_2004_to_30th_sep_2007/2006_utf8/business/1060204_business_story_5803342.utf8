 Global Binary in China pact

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Feb. 3: Global Binary Concept Public Ltd, a city-based information technology company, has signed an agreement with Chinese firm TXYCO Ltd, which has interests in textiles, minerals and IT, for setting up a hardware manufacturing and training unit in the city in 2008 at an investment of Rs 500 crore.

 Global Binary was registered in 1992. The management was recast two years back with TXYCO holding a 50 per cent stake.

 Under the agreement, a TXYCO director will join Global Binarys board.

 In the first phase, TXYCO will send hardware from China that will be assembled here by Global, said Basab DasGupta, director, operations, Global Binary.

 We have set ourselves a modest target of assembling 50,000 computers in 2006-07, which will be scaled up to 1 lakh pieces by 2007-08, DasGupta added.

 The same pieces, when exported from China to Latin American countries like Mexico, charges a duty of 800 per cent, while the duty is much lower in India, he said.

 The investment for the first phase will be Rs 50 crore and Rs 450 crore will be pumped in the course of the next five years.

 The Chinese company will invest 50 per cent of the amount, while Global will approach financial institutions as well as raise funds from the capital market by allotting equity shares for putting in its share of the pie.

 The faculty for the hardware-training institute will come from China arranged by TXYCO.

 TXYCO Ltds annual turnover in textiles only was around $500 million.

 Global has also tied up with the Chinese Industry and Trade Promotion Council, which has organised trade fairs in New Delhi and Mumbai, to bring the event in Calcutta in August.

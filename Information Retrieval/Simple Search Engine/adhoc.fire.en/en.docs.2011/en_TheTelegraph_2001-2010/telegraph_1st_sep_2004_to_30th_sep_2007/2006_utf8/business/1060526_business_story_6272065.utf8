 Tribunal shocks Tata Power

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, May 25: In a setback to Tata Power, the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity has barred the company from supplying electricity to retail customers in the distribution area of Reliance Energy Ltd.

 The order came following an appeal made by the Reliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani group company. Sources said the tribunal upheld the appeal. However, Tata Power can supply electricity to bulk licensees like Bombay Electric Supply and Transport undertaking (BEST) and REL.

 Reliance officials were not available for comments. Sources said the company made an appeal to the tribunal that TPC was supplying power to retail customers in its distribution area. Following the order, close to 18,000 high-end customers of REL will come back to its fold, they added.

 In a statement, TPC admitted that it has been told not to do retail sales in the area of Reliance Energy. 

 It also said Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission, in its order in July 2003, had ruled that TPC has the licence to distribute power in the suburban areas served by Reliance Energy. However, there was a temporary restraint that TPC should not serve a customer below 1000 KVA till they establish a level playing field.

 The company is studying the tribunals order and will take necessary steps accordingly, it added. 

 Tata Power sells over 10,850 MUs to BEST, Reliance Energy and its direct customers in Mumbai license area and the retail sales covered by this order is estimated to be around 450 MUs, the statement said. 

 Also, Reliance Energy buys its entire requirement from TPC. RELs Dahanu plant generates 500 MW.

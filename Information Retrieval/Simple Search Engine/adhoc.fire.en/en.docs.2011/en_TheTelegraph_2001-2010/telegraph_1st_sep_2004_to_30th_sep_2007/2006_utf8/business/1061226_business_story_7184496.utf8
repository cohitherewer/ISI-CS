 One law for direct taxes

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

New Delhi, Dec. 25: The government plans to combine existing laws on income tax, wealth tax and fringe benefit tax under a proposed direct taxes code bill by 2008. 

 The new law will be a simpler version of the existing voluminous laws governing these direct taxes. The government wants to table the new taxation bill in the coming year, for debate in the Parliament, and pass it by April 2008.

 The bill will reduce the number of exemptions and bring in the concept of EET or exempt, exempt, tax in fuller measure. Under EET, savings in select instruments such as pension funds are not taxed. Interest income on these savings are also exempt from tax. Income tax has to be paid only when the money is withdrawn or at maturity. 

 The measure has already been introduced in some schemes. However, officials said savings made before the EET tax is brought in will not be covered by it. 

 The government may also impose differential taxes on savings when it finally brings in EET. This would be done to discourage people from withdrawing their savings too early. 

 Officials said investments in tax saving instruments of a longer duration, like pension funds, provident funds or long term infrastructure bonds will attract a lower rate of tax, which would be similar to the lowest tax slab in place. 

 The difference will be introduced to induce people to save for longer periods. Long term investments are normally channelled into infrastructure, which the government is keen to promote.

 In all cases, only new savings and fresh investments in recurring savings like PF or pension will be taxable when withdrawn. Older investments, made before the law is passed, will remain exempt from tax.

 The new tax code will also use simpler language, remove redundant provisions and inconsistencies to get people to declare their income. The law may also cut down on exemptions to charities and educational institutions. 

 By bringing in a new code along with better data mining, the government expects tax collections to rise along with coverage.

 FM rules out stake sale in healthy PSUs

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 12: Finance minister P. Chidambaram today told the Upper House that the government was unlikely to sell equity in any of the profitable state-run companies in the near future.

 Some months ago, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh put divestment on hold pending more consultations. I do not expect any money to flow into the National Investment Fund (NIF) in the immediate future, he said replying to a question in the Rajya Sabha.

 In November 2005, the government constituted the NIF into which the proceeds from divestment of equity in central public sector enterprises would be placed to fund rehabilitation of sick PSUs and social welfare schemes.

 Till date, no funds have accrued to the NIF, the minister said. Since there was no consensus (on divestment in profit-making PSUs), the Prime Minister had put the process on hold.

 Later in the day, the finance minister assured the Lower House that fiscal prudence would be maintained while seeking an excess grant of Rs 21,823.92 crore to meet expenses relating to fertiliser subsidy, interest relief to farmers and transfers to states.

 Despite the cash outgo of over Rs 11,700 crore, we will be able to meet the fiscal deficit and revenue deficit targets for the current year, Chidambaram said in the Lok Sabha while presenting the Demands for Excess Grants (General) for 2004-05 and 2006-07.

 He said the reasons for the cash outgo included an additional amount of Rs 3,700 crore for fertiliser subsidy. This was primarily because of the need to import 50 lakh metric tonnes of urea to meet the rise in consumption.

 The cash outgo also included central assistance to states for their plans, for reforms in the Jammu and Kashmir power sector and the National Social Assistance programme, especially for the hike in pensions.

 Chidambaram said earlier Rs 500 crore had been given to Jammu and Kashmir to develop the power sector and now an additional Rs 436 crore was being given to the state.

 Maruti 800, Alto become costlier

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 1: Maruti Udyog Limited (MUL) today raised prices of certain models, including the Maruti 800 and the Alto, because of increase in input and freight costs. The hike will range between Rs 500 and Rs 5,000.

 Prices, however, will remain unchanged for the Swift, the Zen, the Baleno (Vxi) and the WagonR (Petrol).

 In percentage terms, the increase, which has been brought to effect from today, varies from 0.17 per cent to 1.47 per cent.

 The price hike is in line with Marutis strategy to share the burden of increase in input costs. 

 A company statement said while it had absorbed a portion of the increased costs, it decided to pass on a part of this to customers. 

 Last month, managing director Jagdish Khattar cautioned against the possibility of an increase in prices.

 The hike of the newly-launched WagonR LPG is the highest at Rs 5,000, while all the variants of mid-size sedan Esteem will be costlier by Rs 1,000.

 The company will also hike prices of the Omni across all variants by Rs 500-3,000.

 Last month, Marutis nearest rival Hyundai Motors India also hiked prices of its models, including the Santro.

 Meanwhile, Maruti has reported a 10.1 per cent increase in domestic sales in July at 44,653 cars against 40,553 in the same month last year. Exports, however, were down 58.2 per cent at 1,755 cars against 4,203 in July last year.

 Century plans mill in Gujarat

 Birla: New plans

 Calcutta, May 9: Century Textiles has decided to set up a new cotton textile mill in Gujarat at an investment of Rs 500 crore. Chairman B.K. Birla said the new unit would come up within a year-and-a-half from now.

 The company will raise the money through debt and internal accruals. There is no plan to issue fresh equity at present, Birla told The Telegraph.

 The company has applied for land for the unit, which will do the spinning, weaving, dyeing and printing.

 It will churn out top-of-the-line cotton fabric, part of which Century Textile will use to make readymade garments. The focus will be on quality than quantity, Birla said.

 Century also plans to set up a captive power plant there.

 The new mill in Gujarat is coming up at a time when the company has decided to close down the mill in Mumbai in a phased manner. Century has truncated the operation there by reducing the number of looms from 1,200 to 500.

 Birla said the operation would be closed in 2-3 years.

 The mill is on a precious land. We are yet to decide how to develop it. It is still some time away now. I have not applied my mind to it, he added.

 Century also forayed into readymade garments through the brand, Cottons by Century.

 The company is in the process of expanding exclusive retail outlets. Last fiscal, it recorded a turnover of Rs 20 crore and has set a target for Rs 40 crore this year.

 Century started its journey way back in 1897 as Cotton Textile Mills.

 Today, it has diversified into three divisions ? textile, cement and pulp and paper.

 The textile (cotton) units are located in Mumbai and Satrati in Madhya Pradesh. The rayon unit is at Kalyan in Maharashtra.

 Cement capacity

 In 1974, the company diversified into cement by setting up a unit at Rajpur in Chattisgarh. Today, it has four units in three states totalling a capacity of 6.3 million tonne.

 CII sees hiring high in growth of 7% 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 1: The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) has projected a 7 per cent growth in the current financial year.

 Most of the respondents of a business outlook survey conducted by the chamber expect the GDP growth for 2005-06 to be more than 7 per cent. This reflects a significant increase in confidence when measured against growth expectations revealed six months ago, it added.

 Earlier this year, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had pitched for an even higher figure ? 8-10 per cent.

 Corporate India also plans to step up investments and recruit more in 2006. Companies will use 100 per cent of their capacities by March, the survey said.

 The chamber said manufacturing, which has catapulted industrial growth to a near double-digit figure, will see further gains.

 Eighty per cent of the respondents plan to increase investments during the second half of the current financial year. Capacity utilisation across the board has increased to approximately 60 per cent. It will go up to 100 per cent by end of 2005-06, the survey said.

 The survey shows the value of production is expected to increase in the next six months. Further increase in production is seen because of a rise in new orders. Seventy eight per cent of the respondents see more exports in the second half of this year. This could go hand in hand with an increase in employment.

 The CII surveys theme was also echoed today by finance minister P. Chidambaram, who said he saw growth of over 7 per cent in 2006, adds PTI.

 In 2005, India received significant international recognition as a global economic powerhouse. I hope in 2006, it will make substantial progress in realising that potential, Chidambaram said in his message for the new year.

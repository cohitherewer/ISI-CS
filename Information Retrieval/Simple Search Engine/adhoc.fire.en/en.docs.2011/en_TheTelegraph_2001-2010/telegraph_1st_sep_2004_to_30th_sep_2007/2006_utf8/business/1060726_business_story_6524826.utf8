 Pak curbs on Saarc agenda

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, July 25: Commerce 

 minister Kamal Nath will take up the issue of import restrictions 

 by Pakistan at the Saarc ministerial meeting in Dhaka on 

 August 1.

 Pakistan has restricted imports from India to 773 items even after signing the Safta accord without any reservations.

 The notification of the government of Pakistan is against the letter and spirit of the South Asian free trade agreement (Safta), which has come into force from July 1, Nath told the Lok Sabha today.

 He expressed his surprise over the Pakistani customs notification for tariff liberalisation programme, which has been issued with the rider that it would be subject to its earlier import policy order.

 Nath said the emergency meeting of the Safta ministerial council will discuss this important matter as it was not within the groups legal framework.

 India had requested the secretary-general of the South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation (Saarc) on July 7 to hold an urgent meeting of the seven member states.

 Meanwhile, the 10-member Asean has suspended free trade area talks with India, Malaysian trade and industry minister Rafidah Aziz said in Kuala Lumpur today.

 The decision was taken because of Indias reluctance to open up its markets to the Southeast Asian countries, she said.

 India had initially put on the table 1,400 items that are considered sensitive and on which imports would not be reduced.

 Although, the list has now been reduced to 856 items, Asean members claim these products still account for only 30 per cent of their exports to India.

 However, India is worried about the livelihood concerns of its farmers and the interests of its developing industries.

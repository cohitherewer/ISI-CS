 Satyam research hub in Singapore

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Oct. 4: Satyam Computer Services has become the first domestic IT company to set up a global innovation hub for research and development in Singapore.

 The hub will enable the company to develop and test applications with its technology partners and global clients.

 In this era of constant change, organisations must innovate while insulating themselves from volatility that can hinder their performance and customer service, said Virender Aggarwal, the companys director amp; senior vice-president of Asia-Pacific region and MEIA.

 The hub will house two centres of expertise in advanced telecom and business intelligence technologies.

 The mobile applications centre will design solutions for telecom carriers and devices. The centre would leverage on Singapores infrastructure facilities and the opportunity to strike alliance with leading players in the region.

 The centre for business intelligence analytics will focus on business performance R amp;D, statistical and mining techniques, and analytical frameworks in a variety of industries and business processes, including telecom banking and supply chain management. 

 Its activities will include customer data integration, real-time locational analytics and a revenue assurance framework.

 The Singapore Economic Development Board would help Satyam recruit personnel for the hub and help with recruitment of participants at relevant forums, conventions and exhibitions.

 There are two reasons for zeroing in on Singapore.

 The first being the presence of several top-grade technical institutes and universities that would provide a string foundation for the hubs human resources and the presence of important global companies in the vicinity to help create new customers and test products for worldwide deployment, Aggarwal added.

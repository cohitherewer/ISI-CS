The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 State Bank sibling posts 70% rise in net

 OUR BUREAU

 May 11: The State Bank of Hyderabad, which is planning to launch a maiden public offering this year, has reported a significant growth in business and earnings for financial year ended March 31, 2006. 

 Riding a 24.43 per cent growth in total business, the bank has reported a 70.21 per cent jump in net profit to Rs 427.04 crore in 2005-06.

 However, the growth in net profit is not a true reflection of the banks profitability as it includes an extraordinary item of Rs 100 crore. 

 The Reserve Bank has permitted banks to add their inter-branch net credit outstanding to the profit and loss account. We added Rs 100 crore on this account to our profits, said managing director Amitabh Guha.

 Even if Rs 100 crore was taken out from the net profit calculation, the banks earnings were still 30 per cent higher than that in 2004-05, he added. 

 SBHs total deposits and advances grew to Rs 56,738.10 crore last fiscal from Rs 45,629.73 crore in 2004-05. Of this, aggregate deposits grew by 19.50 per cent to Rs 35,474.46 crore, while total advances increased by 32.88 per cent to Rs 21,263.64 crore. 

 This has jacked up our credit-deposit ratio to nearly 62 per cent, Guha said. 

 We, however, restored our capital adequacy ratio to 12.08 per cent by diluting our holdings in government securities under the statutory legal liquidity ratio (SLR) to 34 per cent from 40 per cent, he added. 

 The bank still has a headroom for diluting its SLR holdings by another 9 per cent while complying with the statutory requirement of 25 per cent. 

 The banks interest income from advances and interest expenditure on deposits grew in tandem with the growth in aggregate credit and deposits. While its income from interest on advances rose 34 per cent to Rs 1,486 crore, the interest outgo was up by 20 per cent at Rs 1,566 crore. However, the banks total income increased to Rs 3,338 crore from Rs 2,746 crore on the back of an interest income of Rs 1,182 crore from investment, Rs 33 crore from treasury profit and Rs 90 crore from trading profit. 

 Most other banks struggled with their treasury investments following an increase in the interest rate and their profitability took a beating. But our operating profit increased by 21.71 per cent to Rs 868 crore even after providing for a one-time expenditure of Rs 96 crore on account of wage arrears, Guha said.

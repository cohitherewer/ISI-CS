 ABN Amro ups stake in IFCI

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Dec. 12: ABN Amro Bank NV has upped its holding in IFCI Ltd. The Dutch banks stake in IFCI has risen over 5 per cent through the acquisition of over 17 lakh shares of the Delhi-based financial institution during this month.

 According to a disclosure made by IFCI to the stock exchanges today, while ABN Amro held 3.08 crore shares before the acquisition, the secondary market purchase resulted in its stake rising to 5.09 per cent. The share purchase was done by its London branch, IDFC added.

 Though ABN Amro officials were not available for comments, sources said the investment was purely of a financial nature. IFCI, which was in difficult times few years ago, has been in a turnaround mode over the past few months. It posted a net profit of Rs 115.89 crore for the quarter ended September 30 against a loss of Rs 99 crore in the corresponding period last year. IFCI was saddled with huge non-performing assets (NPAs). Earlier this year, it pruned its gross NPAs by more than Rs 2,000 crore.

 Amid such a turnaround, the IFCI scrip has witnessed hectic activity in the bourses. Retail and other investors have been accumulating the share, a broker said.

 ABN Amro, which has established banking operations in India, has often been the subject of speculation vis--vis some of the private sector banks. Few months ago, there were reports that the Dutch bank was close to pick up 5 per cent in IndusInd Bank. However, in September, Ashok Leyland offloaded close to 2.9 per cent of its holding in IndusInd Bank to comply with Reserve Bank of India (RBI) guidelines. Ashok Leyland held 12.89 per cent of IndusInds equity and RBI regulations state that a company must not hold more than 10 per cent in a bank. The shares were picked up by Credo Capital Plc, a UK-based wealth management group.

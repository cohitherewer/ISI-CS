The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Zenith Birla board berth for Patton boss

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Budhia: Glad tidings

 Calcutta, Oct. 3: City-based industrialist Sanjay Budhia has got a board berth in Zenith Birla (India) Ltd.

 Budhia has a 14.8 per cent stake in the Yash Birla group company, which makes steel pipes and tools.

 However, the board membership did not come just because he is the second largest shareholder in the company where promoters hold around 33 per cent. 

 Yash Birla himself wrote a letter to Budhia on September 27 inviting him to join the board.

 I am honoured and delighted by this offer, an elated Budhia, who owns engineering firm Patton, said. 

 His company is a big buyer of steel pipes and tubes that go in the making of electrical steel fittings Patton exports.

 The company has big expansion plans and will make value-added products for the auto component sector. The future is bright, he said.

 The Budhia family is known for picking up large stakes in various small and mid-cap companies.

 For instance, it has about 11 per cent in Tata Tinplate and 4.8 per cent in Tata Metaliks.

 Budhias other investments include Premier Ltd (9.5 per cent), Graphite India (2.6 per cent) and Dhanalaxmi Bank (4.9 per cent).

 He entered these counters at a time when they were poised for a turnaround.

 I am a long-term investor. I never want to destabilise the management. I have full faith in all these companies, he said.

 Budhias board berth comes at a time when Zenith is planning to make a follow-on public offer to raise about Rs 100 crore from the market to fund expansion plans.

 It will diversify into manufacturing of auto components and pipes for the oil and gas sector. Currently, it has three factories.

 The Zenith stock ended flat at todays trade on the bourses. It closed at Rs 70.10, up by Rs 0.25 on the Bombay Stock Exchange.

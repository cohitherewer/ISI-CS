 Calcutta, Feb. 7: Siemens Limited will consider scaling up operations at the Kharagpur manufacturing facility of Flender Limited, which makes industrial gear boxes and related accessories. The Siemens board has approved a 50 per cent stake acquisition in Flender Limited.

 The manufacturing unit at Kharagpur was built in the seventies and currently employs around 315 people.

 Flender Limited is a 50:50 joint venture between Flender AG and Babcock Borsing. Flender AG, was globally acquired by Siemens AG in August 2005. Siemens Limited will buy Babcock Borsings 50 per cent share in Flender Limited.

 We are no longer interested in growing in Bangalore as there is a strain on infrastructure, but Calcutta definitely figures in our growth plans, Siemens Limited managing director Juergen Schubert said.

 The Kharagpur facility will be the first attempt of Siemens globally in industrial gearbox manufacturing, Schubert said. This will expand the companys drive technology portfolio and strengthen the automation and drives division.

 The deal is in the price-discussion stage and would be wrapped up in the next two to three weeks. 

 A similar timeframe will be required to acquire the isolator business of the Pune-based Elpro in Hyderabad. Elpro is a transmission and transport company.

 A success in Kharagpur might also entail scaling up the companys Salt Lake facility, Schubert said.

 The companys software applications division in the city, which employs about 200 people, will focus on industrial software.

 The eastern region contributes 16 per cent to the companys turnover.

 Siemens employs about 500 people in the state.

 While the business volumes for the company has doubled in the last two years, the turnover for the last fiscal was Rs 376 crore, which includes exports worth 15 per cent to Bangladesh and Qatar. Siemens also plans to retain the export growth.

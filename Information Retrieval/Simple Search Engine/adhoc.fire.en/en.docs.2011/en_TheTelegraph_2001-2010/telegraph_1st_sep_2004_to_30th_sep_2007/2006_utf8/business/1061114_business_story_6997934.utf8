 Blue Dart to stay listed 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Nov. 13: DHL Express Singapore has stalled its open offer to the shareholders of Blue Dart Express as the price of Rs 950 discovered from the reverse book-building process was not acceptable to the company. Blue Dart will, therefore, continue to be listed on the bourses.

 DHL Express announced the open offer on October 23 to acquire close to 19 per cent of Blue Darts equity at a floor price of Rs 510.94 per share. DHL holds a little over 81 per cent of Blue Darts equity and the offer was part of its plan to fully own the company and integrate it with its global operations.

 While DHL said it would adopt the reverse book-building process to acquire these shares, it added that a maximum price of up to Rs 550 per share would be offered to shareholders. In September, Blue Dart shareholders approved delisting of its shares from the BSE and NSE in an extraordinary general meeting.

 In a notice to the bourses today, Ambit Corporate Finance Pvt Ltd, on behalf of DHL, said the reverse book-building process, during which shareholders tendered their shares to the acquirer, started on November 6 and ended on November 10 and the discovered price was Rs 950 per share.

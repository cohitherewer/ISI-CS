 Sensex gets back to winning ways

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, May 17: The sensex today created a distance from the intense mood swings seen yesterday and the breakdown on Monday to notch up a triple-ton gain.

 The market bellwether was a winner from the beginning, kicking off 89 points above yesterdays close and advancing throughout the day on broad-based buying. 

 The sensex finally settled at 12217.81, up 344.08 points or 2.9 per cent. 

 The nifty also surged 112 points, or 3.17 per cent, to close at 3635.10. 

 The 30-scrip sensex has recovered 396 points, or 3.35 per cent, in two sessions after ending at 11822.20 on May 15. 

 Earlier, the sensex lost 790 points, or 6.70 per cent, in three sessions from a close of 12612.38 on May 10. 

 Analysts attributed the gains to the base metals regaining its shine on the LME and the recovery in Asian markets. 

 The breadth of the market was positive with 2,089 shares advancing and 479 declining. Only 36 shares remained unchanged. 

 The small and mid-cap counters were also in a buoyant mood. The BSE mid-cap index rose 3.36 per cent, while the small-cap index was up 3.83 per cent. 

 However, turnover fell to Rs 4,089 crore from Rs 5,277 crore yesterday. 

 After the reverses of the past few days, metal stocks surged today as prices firmed up on the LME. 

 Nalco took cue from Hindalco, which raised prices yesterday, to increase rates by Rs 8,000 per tonne.

 The BSE Metal index surged 5.19 per cent, or 494.40 points, on strong buying. Tata Steel gained 6.80 per cent to Rs 612.25, with 27.44 lakh shares changing hands on the BSE.

 Banking stocks were also in the limelight with the Lok Sabha passing the RBI amendment bill that allows the central bank greater freedom in determining the cash reserve ratio (CRR). 

 State Bank of India was the biggest gainer, up 7.24 per cent to Rs 990.35 on volumes of 6.12 lakh shares on the BSE. 

 While the latest data shows FIIs to be sellers, strong buying support from domestic mutual funds has sustained the markets. 

 FIIs sold Rs 533.40 crore of shares yesterday and Rs 728.40 crore on Black Monday, when the sensex plunged 463 points. Mutual funds bought shares worth a net Rs 794 crore on the day. 

 Key indices in Australia, Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Japan were up between 0.06-1.1 per cent. The Nikkei average gained 0.92 per cent at Wednesdays close, snapping a six-day losing streak.

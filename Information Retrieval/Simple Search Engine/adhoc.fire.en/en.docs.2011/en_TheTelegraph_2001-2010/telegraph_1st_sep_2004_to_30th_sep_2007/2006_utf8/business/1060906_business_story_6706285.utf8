 French firm buys Veritas for $3.1 bn

 Paris/New York, Sept. 5 (Reuters): French oilfield services group Compagnie Generale de Geophysique is to buy Texas-based Veritas DGC in a $3.1-billion deal to merge their seismic businesses, the companies said on Tuesday. 

 The acquisition, coming after Geophysique last year acquired Norways Exploration Resources, makes the French firm the worlds largest geophysical services firm by annual sales as it seeks to boost its presence to tap rising demand for seismic surveys, particularly in the oil sector. 

 CGG said it would buy Veritas, provider of geophysical information and services to the petroleum industry, in cash and shares at a premium of 34.7 per cent over Veritass 30-day average closing price of $55.69 up to August 29. 

 The takeover should lift CGG-Veritass 2008 earnings per share by a single-digit percentage and yield annual synergies of $65 million, to be achieved for the first time in 2008 while two thirds would be achieved in 2007, chairman and chief executive Robert Brunck told a conference call. 

 Once the merger is completed, pending shareholder and regulatory approvals, 65 per cent of CGG-Veritas will be owned by CGG shareholders and 35 per cent by Veritass stockholders. 

 This move is very positive ... given the strong complementarities between the two companies, CM-CIC Securities said in a research note, rating Geophysique shares buy.

 Nevertheless, the price is high when looking at CGGs current multiples. 

 The $75 cash part of CSG bid is 26.25 times Veritass expected 2007 earnings per share. Veritas trades at 21.7 times estimated 2007 EPS and CSG at 14.6 times. 

 The fact that CSG is active in the concentration of the sector should be appreciated by the market. In addition, this operations underlines the managements confidence in the longevity of the seismic sectors top cycle, Natexis Bleichroeder analyst Baptiste Lebacq said in a note. 

 The new geophysical services group will have 7,000 staffs and will be listed on the Paris and New York stock exchanges. 

 CGG-Veritas will be a leading global seismic company and the only pure-play listed investment opportunity of this scale in the seismic sector, Brunck said.

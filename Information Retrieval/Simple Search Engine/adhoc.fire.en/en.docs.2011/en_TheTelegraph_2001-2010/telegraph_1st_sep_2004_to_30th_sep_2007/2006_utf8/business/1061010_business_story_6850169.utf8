 Tata trucks dearer

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Oct. 9: Rising input costs, particularly of steel and tyres, have forced Tata Motors Ltd to raise prices of commercial vehicles by 2 per cent. 

 The company has, however, not changed the prices of its cars. 

 Sources who are close to the company confirmed the price hike and said it would only partially compensate the rising costs. Tata Motors, which has a dominant share in the countrys commercial vehicle market, recently reported that bus sales rose 39.5 per cent in September. Sales of commercial vehicles in the domestic market during the month stood at 26,627 compared with 19,087 a year ago. 

 While medium and heavy commercial vehicles sales were 15,193, a growth of 34.1 per cent over the corresponding month in the previous year, that of light commercial vehicles were 11,434, a growth of 47.4 per cent. 

 Cumulative sales of commercial vehicles in the domestic market for the fiscal were 1,34,372, an increase of 53.8 per cent. Cumulative medium and heavy commercial vehicles (M amp;HCV) sales stood at 77,394, a 48.7 per cent rise.

 Nike chief steps down

 New York, Jan. 23 (Reuters): Nike Inc chief executive William Perez has resigned following disagreements with founder and chairman Philip Knight over how to lead the worlds largest athletic shoe company, Nike said on Monday.

 The company said Nike brand co-president Mark Parker will take over from Perez, who steps down after just 13 months with the company.

 Investors and analysts have shown concern over increased competition to Nike from the pending merger between Adidas-Salomon and Reebok International Ltd and over tough market conditions in Europe and Japan.

 Nike, based Beaverton, Oregon, said its board and Perez mutually agreed to end his relationship. Shares of Nike, down about 1.8 per cent in the last year, last traded on Friday at $84.70 on the Nasdaq.

 Succession at any company is challenging, and unfortunately the expectations that Bill and I and others had when he joined the company a year ago didnt play out as we had hoped, Knight said in a statement.

 Nike is still enjoying robust demand within the US for its shoes and apparel, and it posted a 15 per cent jump in latest quarterly profits.

 While Perez joined Nike in December 2004 after a long career with consumer products company S.C. Johnson amp; Sons, worries over his lack of experience in the athletic shoe business have trailed him.

 In a statement, Perez said he and Knight werent entirely aligned on some aspects of how to best lead the companys long-term growth.

 He added, It became obvious to me that the long-term interests of the company would be best served by my resignation.

 Parker, 50, who joined Nike in 1979, will also succeed Perez on the companys board. A company insider and ally of Knight, Parker is known for his work on the Nike Air franchise, among others.

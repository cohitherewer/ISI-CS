 New Delhi, Sept. 4: Spice Communications is looking at an investment of $2.5 billion, nearly Rs 11,250 crore, to be raised through debt, equity and promoter funding to fund its proposed national footprint.

 In the first phase, the company will make an initial public offering of about $200-300 million, or Rs 900-1,300 crore, next December. It will come out with a follow-on public offer of $350 million before December 2008. Around $550-650 million debt will also be raised from the market. The rest will be funded by internal accruals.

 Spice plans to start operations in 21 circles in the country, for which it has already applied for NLD and ILD licences.

 We expect to raise $200-300 million in the first round of the IPO by December, depending on market conditions, said Dilip Modi, vice-chairman and president, Spice Communications.

 Within the next two years, depending on the availability and allocation of spectrum, a second round of public offering would be made to raise another $350 million, he added.

 Spice plans to invest $2 billion in the new circles and about $500 million in the existing circles of Karnataka and Punjab, where it is a leading player. The investments, to be made over a period of 2-3 years, would be sourced through an equal ratio of debt and equity. The company is looking for long-term debt as well as vendor credit, together with equity capital and promoter investments. 

 The company plans to create a strong and extensive pan-India distribution network to capture the emerging 130-200 million new customers in the next few years.

 This growth plan is largely based on the partnership approach wherein infrastructure providers would establish a quality network, while Spice would concentrate on providing the highest quality service. For this, Spice has developed strategic partnerships with Chinese infrastructure providers like ZTE for electronic equipment.

 The company also plans to use advanced wireless broadband technologies like WiFi and WiMax to achieve leadership in a highly competitive environment.

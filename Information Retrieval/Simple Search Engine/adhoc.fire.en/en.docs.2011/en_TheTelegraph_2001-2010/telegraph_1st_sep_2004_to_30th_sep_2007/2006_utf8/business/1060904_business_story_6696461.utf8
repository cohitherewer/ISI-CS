The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Numbers game to cheer up the cuppa

 SOHINI MOOKHERJEA

 Calcutta, Sept. 3: The Tea Board is planning to rate companies. The proposal may figure in the Eleventh Five-Year Plan. The board may discuss the modalities of the rating at its next working committee meeting. 

 This issue had been strongly discussed way back in 2002 and a system to rate exports was devised based on a mid-term report by Accenture but no further headway was made regarding a general system. In my opinion, such a system would be immensely beneficial to group and categorise the tea gardens and improve transparency, board chairman Basudeb Banerjee said.

 The ratings may be based on production quality, exports, social welfare programmes and global accreditions such as hazard analysis and critical control points (HACCP), an international food safety standard.

 If we have to give that extra thrust to our exports, such a system would be good to discipline producers. As a company, we have HACCP, fair trade and various other international certificates for all our gardens, so we believe very strongly in quality production. Such a system, if implemented nationally, would help more international buyers have a standardised referral system, said Aditya Khaitan, managing director of McLeod Russel India Limited, one of the worlds largest tea producers.

 The Sri Lankan tea board has also introduced a star rating system for private factory owners recently. 

 Darjeeling move 

 The Darjeeling Tea Association has joined hands with the Geneva-based Institute of Marketology, an international leader in trade chain integrity audit operating from Bangalore, which will analyse the whole process of the trade.

 The preliminary report of such an audit based on a pilot programme has been submitted and the final report is expected in the next few weeks. We will consult the Tea Board after that, said Sanjay Bansal, chairman of the association.

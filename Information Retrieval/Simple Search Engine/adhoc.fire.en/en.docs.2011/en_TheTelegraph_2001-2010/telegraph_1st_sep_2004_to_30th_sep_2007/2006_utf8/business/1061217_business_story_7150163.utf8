 Closed-end funds under watch

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Dec. 16: The benefit of cost amortisation that closed-end mutual fund schemes enjoy while coming out with new fund offers may soon be taken away. Cost amortisation is the process through which a fund house spreads the expenses incurred on new issues.

 The open-ended funds also enjoyed this benefit, which was subsequently withdrawn by the Securities and Exchange Board of India. The market regulator has taken note of the fact that after this benefit was withdrawn, mutual funds have been going slow on open-ended schemes.

 Fund houses have found a smarter way out in closed-end schemes where they can amortise (or spread) the initial issue expense over a period of five years. As a result, there has been a spate of closed-end schemes in the recent past.

 Mutual funds were asked to charge their initial issue expenses in open-ended schemes during the new fund offer period itself to put a cap on churning by large investors in such schemes, said G. Sethu, officer on special duty, National Institute of Capital Markets.

 As of October this year, the total asset under management of the mutual funds was Rs 3,10,170 crore. But during that period, total redemption of units was Rs 10,45,370 crore while mutual funds sold units worth Rs 10,98,149 crore. These figures indicate that there has been huge churning of funds, he explained.

 Sebi has taken note of the trend that mutual funds are now launching closed-end schemes to take advantage of the cost amortisation benefit and some actions are being contemplated, said Sebi whole time director T.C. Nair. 

 He, however, declined to elaborate on whether the market regulator would make similar restrictions for closed-end schemes on initial cost amortisation as it had done for open-ended schemes. 

 Self-regulation

 Sebi is in favour of promoting a combined self-regulatory organisation (SRO) rather than multiple smaller SROs to regulate the distributors of mutual funds. 

 We want an SRO in place by 2007, chairman M. Damodaran said.

 Jindal Steel gets a toehold in Jharkhand

 VIVEK NAIR

 Mumbai, Sept. 19: Jindal Steel amp; Power Ltd, an OP Jindal group company, has purchased assets and the 600-acre plot of Bihar Steel and Alloys, a sick company that has a rolling mill, forging and alloys plant in Jharkhand.

 While Jindal Steel was the highest bidder for this company, the investment is considered crucial in its plans to build a 5-million-tonne integrated steel plant at Jharkhand. We will get a toehold in Jharkhand through this investment. It is also a sign that we are serious about our plans to set up a steel plant in the state, Sushil K. Maroo, director, finance, Jindal Steel told The Telegraph. 

 Sources said Bihar Steel Alloys has a rolling mill capacity of 1 lakh tonnes. It was earlier an MP Birla group company, which was later acquired by Usha Martin. As it suffered losses, a liquidator was appointed by Jharkhand High Court to sell its assets. Jindal Steel emerged as the highest bidder with a bid of over Rs 108 crore.

 Maroo said Jindal Steel would now look to enhance its rolling mill capacity. Since a rolling mill is a vital component in a steel plant, industry circles said this would be a perfect fit for Jindal Steel which last year indicated that it may initially set up a 2-million-tonne integrated steel plant in the first phase. Another 3 million tonnes will be added in the second phase. 

 Jindal Steel had earmarked an investment of over Rs 10,000 crore for the steel plant, of which over Rs 4,000 crore was invested in the first phase.

 Analysts said for Jindal Steel, the acquisition of Bihar Steel Alloys would also put it on a better footing with the state government, which has been wooing investments. With an investment already in place, they could ask the government for coal and iron ore mines apart from other concessions, sources said. 

 It is, however, not known as to what impact will this development have on Jindal Steels plan for setting up a steel unit in Orissa as well. It was in 2004 that the company signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Orissa government to set up 2-million-tonne steel plant, 80,000-tonne ferro alloys plant and 200-mw captive power plant in Keonjhar district of Orissa at an estimated investment of Rs 3,850 crore. 

 Jindal Steel, which is the largest coal-based sponge iron producer, was selected by the Bolivian government to develop the El Mutun iron ore mines in the country. 

 It now plans to invest $2.3 billion in developing the mines and set up a sponge iron and steel plant there. It would be the biggest foreign investment in the country.

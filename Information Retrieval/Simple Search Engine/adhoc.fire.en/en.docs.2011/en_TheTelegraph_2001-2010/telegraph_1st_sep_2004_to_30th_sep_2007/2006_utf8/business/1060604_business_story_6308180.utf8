 Bayer not keen on Pfizer unit

 Frankfurt, June 3 (Reuters): German drugs and chemicals group Bayer is not currently considering a bid for Pfizers consumer healthcare business, an industry source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Saturday. 

 They got the documents, but are not planning to go for it, he said. The source said Bayer was preoccupied with its 16.5-billion-euro bid for rival German drugs group Schering. 

 A Bayer spokesman declined to comment. 

 Bayer, which bought the over-the-counter drugs business of Swiss drugmaker Roche in 2004, was also in the running for the consumer business of Boots last year, an auction eventually won by Reckitt Benckiser. 

 Bayer has said in the past that it aims for a leading position in the global OTC drugs market, and was thought to have kept its options open on the Pfizer unit. 

 People familiar with the situation said on Friday that British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline Plc was to bid more than $15 billion for the Pfizer business. 

 Final bids for the division are due on June 6. 

 GlaxoSmithKlines move raises the bar in the auction for Pfizers $3.88-billion-a-year over-the-counter (OTC) medicines unit, whose top-selling brands include Listerine mouthwash, Sudafed decongestant and Rolaids antacid. 

 Previously, analysts had estimated the business would sell for around $14 billion, or 3.6 times 2005 sales, similar to the multiple paid by Reckitt Benckiser for Boots Healthcare International last year.

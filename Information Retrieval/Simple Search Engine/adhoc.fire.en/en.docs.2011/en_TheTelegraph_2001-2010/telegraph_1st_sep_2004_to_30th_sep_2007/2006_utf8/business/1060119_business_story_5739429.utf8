 Bitter profit pill for new Ranbaxy boss

 Singh: Stock taking

 New Delhi, Jan. 18: Ranbaxy Laboratories has registered a 56.16 per cent fall in net profit in the last quarter of 2005, even as the promoter family regained control of the company, appointing Malvinder Singh as the chief executive officer.

 The company has recorded a net profit of Rs 68.6 crore in the quarter ended December 31 against Rs 156.5 crore for the corresponding quarter last fiscal.

 The consolidated total income of the group decreased marginally to Rs 1,431.3 crore from Rs 1,437.5 crore in the year-ago period.

 In the domestic market, the company has recorded a growth of 9 per cent in 2005, registering sales of around Rs 1,056 crore. Sales for the fourth quarter were up 14 per cent at Rs 266.46 crore.

 Ranbaxys sales in the US during the fourth quarter touched $93 million (approximately Rs 418 crore).

 Despite falling sales in the US, where the company has lost a major patent litigation against Pfizer on its anti-cholesterol drug Lipitor, the company has recorded a 13 per cent growth in sales in non-US markets.

 Malvinder, a grandson of Bhai Mohan Singh ? the founder-promoter of Ranbaxy, takes control seven years after his father Parvinder Singh and the Ranbaxy board appointed a professional as head of the firm.

 Malvinders younger brother Shivinder Mohan Singh has also been appointed as a director of the board. He is currently the managing director of Escorts Heart Institute and the joint managing director of Fortis Healthcare.

 The companys current CEO and MD, Brian Tempest, will take charge as the chief mentor and executive vice-president of the board. Malvinder, who was president (pharmaceuticals) and executive director of the company, will continue to report to Tempest but at the same time assume complete operational responsibility and will be focused on spearheading Ranbaxys growth to its target of achieving $5 billion of global sales by 2012.

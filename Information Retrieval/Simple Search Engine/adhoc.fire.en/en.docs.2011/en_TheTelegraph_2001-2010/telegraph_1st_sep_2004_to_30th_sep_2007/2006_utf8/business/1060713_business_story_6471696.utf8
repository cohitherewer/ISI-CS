 Texas research centre in Chennai

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 12: Texas Instruments will set up a new R amp;D centre in Chennai.

 The US-based wireless semi-conductor company said it wants to help India reach its goal of 500 million mobile phone subscribers by 2010 by increasing its wireless designs present in India. 

 Mobile phone growth in India is nothing short of a phenomenon. We have a R amp;D centre in Bangalore and expanding our presence with the Chennai centre, said Texas Instruments senior vice-president Gilles Delfassy, who met IT and communications minister Dayanidhi Maran today.

 Delfassy did not disclose the details about the companys plan regarding the second centre, but said the mobile single-chip solution ? Locosto ? developed by Texas would drive down the handset costs, which will accelerate wireless penetration in India. Five handset manufacturers are already planning to roll out handsets based on Locosto.

 Low-cost handsets based on the Locosto platform are expected in the Indian market this year, he said.

 Maran said the government is pursuing with the manufacturers to develop low-cost phones and the first one to respond was Motorola, when it announced a sub-$40 phone and later a sub-$30 one.

 Now we have an opportunity for a sub-$20 phone, which will lower the cost of phones to less than Rs 1,000. The initiative taken by Texas Instruments or other firms like Motorola is important as it will bring in the Rs 1,000 phone. To increase the tele-density of rural India, an entry-level phone at Rs 1,000 will make a big difference, he said.

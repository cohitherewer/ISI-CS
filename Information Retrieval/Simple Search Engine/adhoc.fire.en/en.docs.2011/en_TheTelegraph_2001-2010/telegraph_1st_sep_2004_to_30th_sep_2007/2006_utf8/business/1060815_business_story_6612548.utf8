 Exim Bank helpline for small entities

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Aug. 14: The Export-Import Bank of India and the Geneva-based International Trade Centre, promoted by the UNCTAD and the WTO, have developed a model for small and medium enterprises (SMEs), to be tested in India.

 The model aims to make small and medium enterprises across a range of industry segments more competitive and improve their credit worthiness.

 India was chosen as the destination to test this model due to the sheer diversity of industrial segment. This model is the first of its kind, as it is not limited to SMEs of a particular industrial segment but would involve issues facing such units from different industrial segments. It makes the model more complex as every segment has its issues and problem specific to them, said Jogender Singh, chief manager and resident representative, Export-Import Bank of India, on the sidelines of a CII conference.

 The Exim Bank has created a corpus of Rs 60 crore for around 60 select companies. SMEs across industry segments often have to suffer as not much attention is offered due to the small amounts of investment involved as compared to bigger projects, Singh said.

 The selection of SMEs is in progress, and the bank has already received 50 applications with more pouring in daily. The applications will be scrutinised and the selected candidates will be given loans in the range of Rs 5 lakh to Rs 1 crore.

 The project would make the units more competitive and help them mobilise more funds.

 The disbursement will be made in the last week of September and the first week of October.

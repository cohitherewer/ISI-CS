 Calcutta, March 17: Vodka distillers are raising a toast to Bengal.

 The state has now about 10 per cent share of the national vodka market along with a compounded annual growth rate of 54 per cent in the last three years. 

 Even in eastern India, tipplers are swearing by the vodka: around 20 per cent of the spirit?s sales are from this region compared with the regional share of whisky which is about 10-12 per cent and growing at a rate of 9-10 per cent.

 Vodka sales in India have increased to 16.94 lakh cases in 2004-05 from 7.92 lakh cases in 2002-03. In Bengal, sales touched 1.69 lakh cases in 2004-05, with the growth rate forecast for 2005-06 being 54 per cent.

 Strong growth prospects have enticed liquor giant Radico Khaitan to foray into the vodka market under the Magic Moments brand. Priced at Rs 260 for a 750 ml bottle, Radico expects to have a market share of 10-15 per cent within the year in this price segment.

 ?We have studied the white spirits market extensively. While gin is experiencing a downturn, vodka ? like in other parts of the world ? is seeing jump in sales in the country and especially in states like Bengal by leaps and bounds,? said R. Vaziraney, president sales and marketing, Radico Khaitan Limited. The company has invested Rs 85 crore to set up a grain distillery at Rampur in Uttar Pradesh with an annual capacity of 27 million litres.

 Diageo India too is pleased as Punch with vodka sales in Bengal, where the white spirit fares well across all price segments. 

 The company counts the state as one of the top five markets in India in terms of sales for its premium brand Smirnoff, according to Santosh Kanekar, director ? marketing, Diageo India.

 He said surveys in the state indicate that vodka is the preferred spirit among the new drinkers whose numbers swell by as much as 25 million a year.

 Kanekar attributed the sales spurt to a stable licence regime in the state and to the drinking habits of its youth, who are ever willing to try out new spirits.

 Radico will launch Magic Moments first in the city and then in Mumbai. The company has 28 bottling tie-ups in the city. Both Radico and Diageo plan innovative marketing strategies to attract the younger urban customers.

 Radico clocked a turnover of Rs 995 crore in the last fiscal and expects 22 per cent to 25 per cent year-on-year growth over the next two fiscals.

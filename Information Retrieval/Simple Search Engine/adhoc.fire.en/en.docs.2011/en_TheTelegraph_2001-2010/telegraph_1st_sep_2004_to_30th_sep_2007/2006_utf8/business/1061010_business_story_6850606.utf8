 ABP inks media content deal

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 9: Bobby Bedi-promoted film production company Kaleidoscope Entertainment Pvt Ltd and the ABP Group have formed a strategic partnership. 

 The ABP Group which publishes The Telegraph will shell out Rs 20 crore to help Kaleidoscope Entertainment produce programmes for television and media content for Internet and cellphones.

 For the ABP Group, the partnership marks an entry into filmed entertainment.

 Kaleidoscope Entertainment has produced a handful of television serials in the past. These include the 39-part soap Rajdhani and William Dalrymple-presented Stones of the Raj. However, its focus has been films.

 It has produced critically acclaimed films like Bandit Queen, Electric Moon, Saathiya, Maqbool and Mangal Pandey - The Rising. At least three more movies are in the pipeline over the next couple of years.

 The ABP-Kaleidoscope partnership will capitalise on both the companies strengths to create original content across media by producing high quality content for filmed entertainment, TV, mobile and Internet, a press statement said.

 Bedi said the new media and digital content segment was growing rapidly and the tie-up will leverage the best resources and expertise of both the companies.

 The paradigm of entertainment today has evolved beyond conventional definitions, he said.

 ABP chief executive officer Pramath Raj Sinha called the deal a win-win partnership for both the companies.

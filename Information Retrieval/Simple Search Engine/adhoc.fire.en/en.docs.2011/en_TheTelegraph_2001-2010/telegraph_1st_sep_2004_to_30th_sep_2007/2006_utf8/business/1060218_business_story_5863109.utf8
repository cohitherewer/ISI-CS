 Sensex drops below 10000

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Feb. 17: The sensex today slipped below the 10000-mark, its biggest one-day decline in nearly five weeks, due to profit booking by cautious investors who did not want to take up fresh positions ahead of the Union budget.

 The index fell 143.19 points, or 1.4 per cent, to 9981.11, its biggest drop since January 10. After opening marginally higher at 10168.55 and rising to an intra-day high of 10184.04, the sensex met with heavy selling and nose-dived to a low of 9970.00. The index had closed below the 10000-mark on February 6 at 9980.42.

 Broking circles say few more such corrections are likely over the next few days, before the indices consolidate before the budget. 

 The current rally in the stock market has made investors cautious. Many feel that the markets are over-heated at this point of time. While this has led to the correction, there are a lot of expectations from the budget as well. If P. Chidambarams budget does not live up to these expectations, we may be in for a major fall, cautioned a broker. 

 The sensex has climbed 37 per cent in 2005, making it the third-best performer in Asia. During this year, it has gained more than 6 per cent. There was selling across the board and losers led gainers by nearly three to one. On the BSE, the ratio stood at 1899 to 624.

 Nearly all indices finished in the red and BSE FMCG index led the losers. FMCG scrips have been the star performers in recent times boosted by better-than-expected numbers from HLL. The index slumped 2.66 per cent as HLL scrip fell by Rs 6.85 to Rs 231.55 and ITC by Rs 5.05 to Rs 161.65.

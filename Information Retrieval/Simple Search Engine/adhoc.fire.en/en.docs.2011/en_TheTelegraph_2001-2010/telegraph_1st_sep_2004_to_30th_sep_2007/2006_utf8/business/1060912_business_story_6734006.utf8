 Opec unfazed by price fall 

 Vienna, Sept. 11 (Reuters): Opec will keep its oil output near a 25-year high despite a $13 fall in crude prices since mid-July, ministers said on Monday, but the group left the door open to a supply cut before the end of the year.

 Ministers said before the meeting they were unlikely to tamper with the 28-million-barrels-per-day ceiling for now, with peak winter demand closing in and supply worries ever present.

 For a year, Opec has been pumping close to its fastest rate for 25 years to guard against price shocks and ease pressure on consumer economies. Prices have sunk from a record $78.40 a barrel on July 14 to a five-month low below $66 on Monday.

 Saudi oil minister Ali al-Naimi Naimi, Opecs most influential voice, took the recent price fall in his stride. Market fundamentals are very sound. We are beginning to see a slight decrease in economic growth, very slight ... It is nothing alarming.

 Forecasts suggesting demand for Opec oil will decline in 2007 are worrying some in the group that pumps a third of the worlds crude. Opec empowered the groups president, Nigerias oil minister Edmund Daukoru, to call an extraordinary meeting before the next scheduled gathering in December if needed.

 We have been producing more or less regardless of the call on Opec, Daukoru said ahead of the talks.

But Opec saw no need for an immediate production cut 

 oil is still up $5 this year and three times the price at the start of 2002, 

the beginning of a four and a half year rally.

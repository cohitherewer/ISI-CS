 Nestle stirs heady profit concoction

 The way AHEAD

 Zurich, Aug. 23 (Reuters): Nestle, the worlds largest food company, reported an 11.4 per cent rise in first-half net profit as hedging efforts and price increases offset higher input and energy costs, boosting profitability.

 The maker of Nescafe coffee and Smarties chocolates posted on Wednesday a net profit of 4.151 billion Swiss francs ($3.39 billion) in the first six months of 2006, meeting expectations and sending the companys shares higher.

 Swiss-based Nestle also said it expected full-year sales growth to hit the higher end of its target range and that it would continue to improve profitability and pass on higher costs to customers.

 Nestle is confident it can continue to price for cost inflation, finance chief Paul Polman told Reuters in an interview.

 Despite higher prices for commodities such as coffee, sugar and oil, Nestle boosted its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margin, a key profitability yardstick, by 40 basis points to 12.8 per cent in the first half.

 The figure topped most analysts expectations.

 These numbers confirm that Nestle performs clearly better than Cadbury and Unilever in terms of organic growth, said analyst Rene Weber, at Swiss bank Vontobel, who rates the stock sector outperform.

 The margin increase in the first half of 2006 of 40 basis points is ahead of the peer group.

 Nestle said it had limited the impact of higher raw material costs through hedging and efficiency programmes and economies of scale.

 Our costs for the full year of 2006 are already fixed and there should be no surprises, chief executive officer Peter Brabeck said. Nestle, which also bottles Perrier water, raised its prices by 1.6 per cent in the first six months, while a stronger dollar also helped boost earnings. 

 An excellent set of figures with the companys cost savings and hedging strategy offsetting higher input costs. The US and Asia were strong while Europe is obviously experiencing a recovery, said Kepler Equities analyst Jon Cox.

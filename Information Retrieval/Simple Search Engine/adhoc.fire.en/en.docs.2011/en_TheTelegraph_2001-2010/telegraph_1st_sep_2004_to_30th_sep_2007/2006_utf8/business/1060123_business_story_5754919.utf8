 Insure that loan risk

 A life insurance cover on a home loan product makes eminent sense. Srikumar Bondyopadhyay finds out why 

 Corporation Bank?s chief manager (north zone) N. Subramanian can?t give the percentage of borrowers who are buying the life insurance cover his bank is selling with its home loan product. Instead, he narrates incidents he has encountered in real life. 

 ?I was a branch manager in Ahmedabad,? he begins. ?One day, a 28-year-old, newly married man came to the bank for a home loan. He was working with a public sector company and took a loan of Rs 8 lakh. Two years later, his widow and mother-in-law came to me and requested that the tenure of the loan be extended so that they could repay it. They did but only by selling whatever jewellery they had,? says Subramanian.

 ?Some years later, I was transferred to our Rajkot branch,? he said. ?There I recounted the Ahmedabad incident to a 40-year-old customer who had become a friend of mine. 

 ?He bought the Corp Griha Surakha life cover we offer (in association with the Life Insurance Corporation of India) along with a Rs 10 lakh loan. Unfortunately, this man also met with an accident and died before he could repay the home loan. But his family didn?t have to sell their belongings to repay the loan. LIC paid us.?

 Why do we need it?

 The point that Subramanians stories drive home is that proper insurance planning should be an integral part of ones overall investment planning. Most of us buy life insurance for other than the basic insurance needs ? for tax savings or simply for investment. 

 Insurance must be bought for the sake of insurance: to provide financial protection to immediate dependants against any misfortune that may happen to you; investment is designed to accumulate more capital. 

 But we often forget this basic proposition and end up exposing our dependants to greater financial risks. For example, when we buy a house or a car with a loan, we do it with an aim to create wealth for our family. But making such a huge financial commitment without a life cover, at least to the extent of the credit outstanding, means exposing the family to greater financial risks if anything unforeseen happens to the breadwinner.

 Pick and choose

 Life insurers are offering level-term loan cover plans and mortgage-reducing term assurance plans both on a stand-alone basis as well as a group insurance product. In a level-term loan cover plan, the sum insured remains constant over the loan tenure and hence the premium cost in such plans is high. 

 In a mortgage-reducing term assurance plan, the sum insured diminishes with every repayment of the loan and, hence, the premium is low. Both plans are pure risk products and, therefore, the premium cost is much lower than traditional life insurance plans such as endowment, money-back and whole-life insurance. 

 Further, a group insurance plan comes cheaper than its stand-alone variant. It is better to go in for a mortgage-reducing term assurance plan in a group scheme. 

 Each one, take one

 Recently, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance entered into a strategic alliance with Bank of India to offer a mortgage-reducing term assurance (group insurance) on the bank?s home loan product, HomeAssure. 

 SBI Life Insurance Company is offering a similar insurance product to Federal Bank customers. Union Bank of India has a tieup with Birla Sun Life, HDFC Bank with HDFC Standard Life. 

 In fact, most banks offer a life insurance cover with their home loan products. But they don?t hardsell it, despite the fact that their loans get more secured with the insurers promising to repay it.

 Premium cost

 Home loan borrowers between 18 and 60 years can enter the insurance scheme by paying a very low premium. The premium cost will, however, depend on the age of the borrower, loan tenure and the amount outstanding. But it can be as low as Rs 25 per month for a 30-year old borrower who has taken a Rs 1 lakh loan for 10 years. The total premium cost can be paid as a single payment or can be spread over the entire loan tenure by clubbing with EMIs for the home loan. 

 Banks often offer a loan to pay the insurance premium. But since the premium cost is very small compared with the EMI, one should avoid it. The premium differs from insurer to insurer. However, a home loan borrower with a life cover can claim tax deduction under section 80C for the premium.

 MTNL cuts rates

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 27: State-run Mahanagar Telephone Nigam today slashed rentals on its One India plan to Rs 180 per month from Rs 299 a month, even as the company reported a 25.53 per cent dip in its net profit for quarter ended September 2006.

 MTNL has posted a net profit of Rs 121.02 crore in the second quarter of 2006 compared with Rs 162.53 crore in the corresponding quarter last year. Total income was down 5 per cent to Rs 1,376.76 crore from Rs 1,444.05 crore in the year-ago period. 

 When asked why the One India plan rental was cut despite a loss in revenue, MTNL chairman R.S.P. Sinha said, The move is aimed at restricting the number of subscribers who switch to other telecom service providers.

 Analysts said the move reflects the competition among the two telecom PSUs MTNL and BSNL to increase their subscription base substantially. 

 BSNL had recently revamped its One India plan tariff and reduced rentals to Rs 180 per month from Rs 225.

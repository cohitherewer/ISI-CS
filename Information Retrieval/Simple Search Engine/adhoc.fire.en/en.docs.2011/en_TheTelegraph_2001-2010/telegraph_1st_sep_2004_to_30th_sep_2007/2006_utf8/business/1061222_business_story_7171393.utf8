 Panel to draft omnibusact on insurance

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 21: The Union cabinet today decided that the responsibility of creating an omnibus insurance act by amending various insurance laws that include raising the FDI cap should be handed over to a group of ministers.

 The raising of foreign direct investment (FDI) cap, from 26 per cent to 49 per cent, which will be part of the comprehensive amendment has been a bone of contention within the cabinet as well as with Congresss Left allies. 

 It (insurance law amendment) is a beginning we have made today ... Our insurance laws are antiquated and need to be revamped, said finance minister P. Chidambaram.

 Chidambaram said the GoM would not take more than two sittings to give its views on the matter. It (GoM) should not take much time as the K.P. Narasimhan Committees report and the views of the law ministry are there. It should not take more than two sittings, he said. 

 Chidambaram also said the bill seeking to amend insurance laws could be introduced in Parliament in the budget session itself.

 Apart from raising the FDI cap in insurance from 26 per cent to 49 per cent, changes proposed by the bill include amendments to the Insurance Act (1938), LIC Act (1956), General Insurance Business Nationalisation or GIBNA Act and the IRDA Act (1999).

 The UPA government had first proposed to raise the limit of FDI to 49 per cent in its maiden budget of 2004-05. 

 However, no decision could be taken so far in view of the opposition by the Left. 

 Multinational insurance companies as well as chambers of commerce like Assocham and CII have long been lobbying for a hike in insurance FDI.

 In the draft amendment bill, the government, in consultation with the law ministry, has pruned sections of the act that is no longer relevant to the insurance sector. 

 The law commission had emphasised on the need for a modern insurance law to give a boost to the sector.

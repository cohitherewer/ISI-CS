 Hint of rate rise to curb inflation

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, April 17: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has not finished with its monetary tightening measures. A day before unveiling the annual policy statement, the central bank hinted that it may also have to raise interest rates like other central banks in the world to contain inflation and inflationary expectations.

 The signal was given in a document titled Macroeconomic and Monetary Developments in 2005-06 which traditionally precedes the RBIs quarterly policy review.

 Interestingly, the RBIs comments came despite inflation remaining well below the RBIs target of 5.0 to 5.5 per cent for fiscal 2005-06.

 Although the year-on-year wholesale price inflation was 3.5 per cent on April 1 compared with 5.7 per cent a year ago, the RBI is worried that a significant part of the increase in international crude oil prices is increasingly being viewed as somewhat permanent.

 Back in January, the RBI had raised the reverse repo rate ? an instrument through which it mops up liquidity by banks ? by a quarter of a percentage point to 5.50 per cent to contain inflationary expectations. The big question now is whether it will again hike this short-term rate in tomorrows policy.

 Observers who support this view point towards the RBIs comments in todays report where the central bank talked about its counterparts resorting to monetary tightening to control inflation which still remains at elevated levels.

 Analysts, who expect Y.V. Reddy to raise the reverse repo rate to 5.75 per cent on Tuesday, aver that the RBI will err on the side of caution and again do a pre-emptive tightening.

 However, this view is contradicted by others who feel that the central bank is unlikely to touch interest rates tomorrow. Analysts here are drawing comfort from the RBIs comments in the report that headline inflation in the country remained well contained in 2005-06.

 According to the RBI report, the Indian economy exhibited strong performance during 2005-06, led by sustained growth in the industry and the services sectors. Advance estimates made by the Central Statistical Organisation (CSO) put the real GDP growth at 8.1 per cent in 2005-06 from 7.5 per cent in 2004-05. During the year, aggregate deposits accelerated, led by both demand and time components. However, mobilisation under small savings schemes have decelerated. 

 Credit demand was also strong during the year. Demand for bank credit was broad-based led by agriculture, industry and personal loans (housing, credit cards, education) sectors. Data showed that 26 per cent of the incremental non-food credit during April-January 2006, went to the industrial sector, while 15 per cent was on account of housing loans and another 11 per cent was absorbed by the agriculture sector.

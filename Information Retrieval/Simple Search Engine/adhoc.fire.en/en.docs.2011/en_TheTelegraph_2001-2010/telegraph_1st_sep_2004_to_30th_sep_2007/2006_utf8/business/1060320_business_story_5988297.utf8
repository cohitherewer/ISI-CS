 Calcutta, March 19: Nortel Networks (India) Private Limited and state-owned Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd (TCIL) have almost completed a Rs 22-crore mobile radio communications project for the Eastern Railways. 

 The Eastern Railways is the first organisation outside the European Union to adopt such a project.

 Nortel Networks is the sole provider of this digital wireless network. The Global System for Mobile Communications for Railways (GSM-R) project will modernise operations, reduce operational costs, improve safety and enable new services for passengers and employees.

 The project will be ready in a record time. This European Union-sponsored wireless technology is now gradually being deployed in Europe and Asia, said Rajan Mehta, vice-president of Nortel Networks (India).

 The GSM-R technology, in which Nortel Networks has 10 years of global experience, was used to deploy a mobile radio communication network for the 261-km, 24-station railway tracks running between the Eastern Railway headquarters in Howrah and Pradhankunta at a cost of Rs 22.24 crore.

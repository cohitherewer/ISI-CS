 Couriers board dream flight

 Sky is the limit

 Mumbai, April 25: The skies are going to get a lot more crowded ? and don?t blame it all on airline companies.

 A host of domestic express companies that usually depend on airlines or other modes of transport to despatch goods from one part of the country to another are now planning to buy their own cargo aircraft. At present, Blue Dart Aviation ? which has five Boeing 737-200 freighters ? is the lone jet cargo aviation company that operates and connects major metros in the country. But that will change soon.

 If industry circles are to be believed, several players in the express business are on the verge of bringing in their own freighters to reduce their dependence on third-party transporters and service their customers better.

 Some of the names that are doing the rounds include DTDC Courier and Cargo Ltd, the Subhasish Chakraborty-promoted firm in which Anil D. Ambani?s Reliance Capital Ltd (RCL) has a 44 per cent stake, apart from First Flight Couriers, Gati Ltd and AFL Pvt Ltd. 

 Blue Dart is planning to add two new Boeing 757-200s freighter to its existing fleet. With the addition of these two Boeings, which the company expects to take on lease, its carrying capacity will rise by 250 tonnes. 

 Mukesh D. Ambani, who is now spearheading an aggressive retail foray, is also buying cargo freighters. Reports say that Ambani?s Reliance Retail will have a fleet of 40 planes to feed various items to his retail chain in the country. 

 First Flight Couriers, a Rs 203-crore company, that has a network of 721 branches in the country covering 1,800 destinations, has signed long term leases with BAE Systems Regional Aircraft for three freighters for its domestic operations. 

 Industry sources say the first aircraft will be delivered by July this year. 

 It is expected that others in the industry will have their flying machines ready for take off later this year. 

 Sources close to AFL Pvt Ltd confirmed that the company will have its own fleet of aircraft. 

 ?By having their own aircraft, the express companies can offer a better level of service to customers,? said a senior official from one of the leading firms.

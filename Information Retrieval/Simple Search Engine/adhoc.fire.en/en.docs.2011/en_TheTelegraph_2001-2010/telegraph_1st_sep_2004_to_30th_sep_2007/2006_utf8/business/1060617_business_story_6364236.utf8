 Exide stock energiser ready

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Ganguly: Game plan

 Calcutta, June 16: Exide Industries is planning a stock split.

 The board will seek shareholders? approval at the company?s annual general meeting on July 21. The plan is to split the shares of Rs 10 face value into 10 shares of Re 1 face value. 

 ?The current trading volumes of the company are not up to the mark. This split, if approved by shareholders, is expected to add liquidity to Exide?s shares in the stock market, enabling more people to become a part of the Exide shareholders? family,? said S.B. Ganguly, executive chairman and chief operation officer of Exide Industries.

 The split will raise the number of Exide shares by 10 times, offering better float and liquidity in the stock market.

 However, the change in the face value from Rs 10 to Re 1 will not affect its total share capital of Rs 75 crore.

 The company was recently in the news for becoming the first battery maker to charge up the proposed Rs 1-lakh-car by Tata Motors.

 The Exide plant in Haldia, which has been operational for the last 20 years, would manufacture these batteries. Besides making automotive, industrial batteries, the plant also makes batteries for submarines.

 The company posted a 30.34 per cent rise in net profit at Rs 100.73 crore and also registered a sales of Rs 1,761.08 crore, an increase of 18.76 per cent, for the financial year ended March 31, 2006.

 The industrial battery segment of Exide Industries showed an impressive 18 per cent revenue growth during the year and a market share of more than 50 per cent. 

 The company had more than 75 per cent share in the branded replacement market.

 In the original equipment business for automotive batteries, Exide has a market share of over 80 per cent.

 The company?s industrial battery export grew by more than 33 per cent in Korea, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and the Netherlands. 

 The Exide share closed at Rs 245.95 on the BSE today, up Rs 40.9, or 19.95 per cent, from Thursday?s close of Rs 205.05.

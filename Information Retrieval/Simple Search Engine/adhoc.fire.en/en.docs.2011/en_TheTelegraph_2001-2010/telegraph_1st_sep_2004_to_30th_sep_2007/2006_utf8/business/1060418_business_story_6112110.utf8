 General Electric in race for BAA

 Bidding game

 London, April 17 (Reuters): General Electric has emerged as a surprise participant in the battle to buy British airports operator BAA Plc, the Daily Telegraph newspaper reported on Monday.

 BAA, which is fending off an ?8.75 billion ($15.33 billion) hostile takeover bid from Spanish construction firm Grupo Ferrovial, said on Sunday it had also spurned a ?9.4-billion approach from a consortium led by US investment bank Goldman Sachs.

 The report, citing UK government sources, said General Electrics name was not in Goldmans consortium at this stage but that they were expecting it to get involved.

 The newspaper also said separate sources had told it that GE, whose businesses range from credit card financing to servicing jet engines, had expressed interest in BAA several weeks ago.

 GE and BAA declined to comment.

 Representatives of Goldman Sachs could not be reached when contacted by Reuters.

 European airports have been drawing investors attracted by a highly visible, long-term outlook predicting traffic in Europe will double by 2020 to 2 billion passengers.

 BAA fought off Germanys Hochtief in December to buy control of Hungarys Budapest airport from the state for $2.2 billion. 

 BAA is the latest in a string of British firms to attract foreign bidders amid a global boom in takeover activity.

 Earlier this month, Spanish construction firm Grupo Ferrovial had launched a 8.75-billion hostile bid for BAA as it tried to bulk up in the booming European airports sector. BAA, which runs Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports, rejected the 810-pence-a-share cash offer from Ferrovials bidding consortium.

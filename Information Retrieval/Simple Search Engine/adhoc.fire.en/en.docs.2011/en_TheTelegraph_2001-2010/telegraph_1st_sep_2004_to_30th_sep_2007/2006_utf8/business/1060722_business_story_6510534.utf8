 Calcutta, July 21: CESC has posted a 34.14 per cent jump in profit after tax in the first quarter of 2006-07.

 The company has posted a PAT of Rs 55 crore in the April-June quarter, compared with Rs 41 crore a year ago. Despite a drop in average tariff rates, higher efficiency and reduced depreciation cost helped the company achieve these numbers.

 Total income increased only 1.01 per cent to Rs 695 crore for the quarter ended June 30 from Rs 688 crore in the corresponding previous quarter. The reduction in tariff was made up by higher sales.

 Vice-chairman Sanjiv Goenka said the performance was commendable in the light of the reduced tariff.

 The new average tariff of 374 paise/unit is even lower than the tariff of 381 paise/unit, which prevailed almost six years ago, Goenka said.

 However, the company is still willing to make an investment of Rs 20,000 crore for power generation in next six years.

 Bengal will receive almost half of this investment with CESC planning a 2,000-megawatt power plant in Haldia. The company is also pursuing projects in coal pit-head regions of Orissa and Chhattisgarh, Goenka said.

 Incidentally, CESC has also bid for one of the ultra mega power projects mooted by the Centre.

 Coal linkage is all important for these projects to take off. We have applied for coal blocks, he added.

 He added that Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had taken up the coal linkage issue and the matter was progressing satisfactorily.

 We would prefer to be independent of any external agency in our supply of coal. As a matter of policy, CESC would not move ahead with any new project till the government allots coal blocks, he added.

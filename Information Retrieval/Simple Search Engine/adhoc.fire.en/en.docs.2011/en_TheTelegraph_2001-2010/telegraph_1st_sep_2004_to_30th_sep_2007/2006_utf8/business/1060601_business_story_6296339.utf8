 RBI in rupee rescue act

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, May 31: The rupee remained under pressure against the dollar on apprehensions of falling FII inflows. 

 The rupee today hit a three-year low against the greenback, only to be rescued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). It ended at 46.36 per dollar, a nine-month low. 

 Apart from concerns over the pullout by foreign institutional investors (FIIs), the slide was caused by higher demand from corporate houses for dollars ? the demand goes up at the end of the month ? and firm crude oil prices. 

 However, the intervention by the RBI has sent strong signals on the central banks willingness to prevent a major depreciation. 

 Analysts felt the rupee would also benefit from the strong GDP numbers. The economy recorded an 8.4 per cent GDP growth in 2005-06, more than the earlier estimate of 8.1 per cent.

 The GDP numbers released today is certainly a bullish sign, said Vishal Singhi, a senior analyst at Mecklai.

 The local currency opened distinctly weak at 46.44 per dollar in volatile trade at the interbank forex market. It fell to a three-year low of 46.57 intra-day as dollar supplies receded amid high demand. 

 Nationalised banks then started selling dollars on behalf of the RBI and the rupee bounced back to 46.27 before settling at 46.36, a loss of six paise from Tuesdays close of 46.30. 

 The rupee, thus, depreciated by nearly 48 paise in three consecutive sessions. The fall augurs well for exporters, though it generated mixed feelings among the software service companies many of whom after hedging against a depreciating rupee at 46.50 are now feeling the heat of the currency falling below the benchmark. 

 The volatility also spoilt the tempo of ushering in a regime of full convertibility. The government has indicated that safeguards to check volatility would first be in place before allowing a free float.

 Industry on an upswing

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Aug. 30: Worried about a slowdown? Perish the thought. The industrial sector is in its longest boom phase and seems to be showing no signs of letting up.

 The current phase of industrial resurgence started in the second quarter of 2002, and it has been buoyed by a sharp rise in the production of capital goods, non-oil imports, higher level of manufacturing exports spurred by global recovery, and higher domestic demand for consumer durables in an environment of softer interest rate regime, says the RBI in its annual report.

 Industrial recovery also benefited from growing efficiency and competitiveness of domestic production, emanating from various policy reforms and restructuring of the industrial sector since the early 1990s. The current cyclical upturn remains one of the longest in the last decade as it has continued for four years, the report says.

 The growth in the IIP reached a peak in the second quarter of 2005. Although some signs of slowdown were visible in the third and fourth quarters of 2005, industrial activity recovered in the first quarter of 2006. The upbeat phase came after a slight hiccup: there was a contraction in industrial activity during the third and the fourth quarters of 2005 which seemed to suggest that industrial growth might lose some of its momentum in the ensuing quarters, says the report. But that wasnt to be. The phenomenal growth of capital goods, coupled with its imports and increased capacity additions, suggest a buoyant investment climate, the RBI said.

 Arcelor to check out new Mittal bid

 Luxembourg, May 21 (Reuters): Arcelor is willing to study Mittal Steels improved takeover offer and its business plan to create a global steel giant, Arcelor said on Sunday, opening the door to possible talks with its suitor.

 The board of directors will examine the contents of Mittal Steels revised offer as soon as it shall have been approved by the CSSF (Luxembourgs financial regulator), Arcelor chairman Joseph Kinsch told reporters after a meeting of Arcelors board.

 Until Sunday, Luxembourg-based Arcelor, the worlds No.2 steelmaker, had firmly rejected the advances by global sector leader Mittal.

 The slight softening of its stance comes after Mittal raised its hostile cash-and-equity bid by a third on Friday and dropped a key demand for family control over the combined global steel giant, just one day after the bid was formally launched.

 Mittals revised offer was worth 25.8 billion euros (around $33 billion) at Fridays market close.

 The board of directors expressed its wish to examine Mittal Steels business plan ... in order to be able to assess the industrial merits as well as the value of the Mittal Steel shares offered in exchange, Kinsch said.

 But Kinsch, reading from a statement, gave no indication as to whether Arcelors board would accept or reject the new offer. The board of directors also reiterated the management boards mandate to present it with all options which are in the interests of all stakeholders, he said.

 Mittals move on Friday came after the value of its initial offer fell more than 10 percent behind the market worth of Arcelor, as Arcelor announced a buyback of its own shares at above-market prices to ward off Mittal.

 Mittal Steel, 87 per cent owned by the family of chief executive Lakshmi Mittal, aims to create a producer of 100 million tonnes of steel per year ? more than three times the size of its closest rival ? by combining the largest and second largest companies in the fragmented steel industry.

 But its ambitions had been fiercely resisted by Arcelor. The two have traded verbal blows since Mittals takeover plan was launched on January 27, while European governments, fearing job losses, have expressed reservations.

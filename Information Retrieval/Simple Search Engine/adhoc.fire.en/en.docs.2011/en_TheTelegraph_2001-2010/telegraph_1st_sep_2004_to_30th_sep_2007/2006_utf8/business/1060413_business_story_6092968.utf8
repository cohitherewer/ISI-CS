 Back to Basics 

 Mumbai, April 12: The Associated Cement Companies Limited (ACC), the countrys second largest cement maker, has undertaken a reorganisation of its company to focus more on marketing activities, with greater focus on the customer and the end user. 

 ACC today announced that Ashok Jain, a whole-time director who was so far supervising cement marketing, will now be the whole-time director responsible for the cement makers ready mixed concrete business.

 The companys ready mixed concrete (RMX) business maintained the growth trend witnessed in the last few years with the turnover growing by 27 per cent in the nine months ended December 31, 2005. 

 ACC, like all other cement companies, has also raised its prices per bag as cement prices continue to harden across India.

 ACC today also announced a profit after provision for taxation and exceptional items of Rs 235.48 crore for the quarter ended March 31, 2006 compared with Rs 165.52 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year.

 Total income stood at Rs 1381.22 crore for the quarter ended March 31, 2006 against Rs 1155.02 crore during the same quarter in the previous year.

 The company has informed the National Stock Exchange (NSE) that it has sold real estate worth Rs 140 crore and the gains would be reflected in its April- June earnings. 

 However, the company also said the results of the current quarter are not comparable with the same period last year as they include figures of erstwhile Bargarh Cement Ltd and Damodhar Cement and Slag Ltd which were merged with the company from April 1, 2005 and also because ACC had divested its refractory business on September 30, 2005. 

 On a consolidated basis, the group posted a profit after tax (PAT) of Rs 231.34 crore for the quarter ended March 31, 2006 against Rs 182.24 crore in the year-ago period.

 Demand for cement has grown by 10 per cent during the period, April 2005-January 2006, against a growth of 8.7 per cent in the corresponding period of the previous year, it said in its statement. 

 During 2005, the cement industry has produced and supplied over 136 million tonnes of cement, including export of 9 million tonnes of cement and clinker. 

 The annual capacity of the domestic cement indus- try has risen to 160 mill- ion tonnes. 

 During the year, we made notable progress in exiting from our non-core non-cement business. We divested the refractory business in September 2005 to ACE Refractories. The sale of this unit earned us a profit of Rs 174.05 crore. Similarly, we exited from Everest Industries which ceased to be a subsidiary of the company. We hope to divest our balance non-core subsidiaries during 2006, the company has informed the Bombay Stock Exchange.

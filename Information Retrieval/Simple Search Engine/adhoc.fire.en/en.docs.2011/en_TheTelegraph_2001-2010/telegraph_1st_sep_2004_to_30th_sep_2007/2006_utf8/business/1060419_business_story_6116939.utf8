 Sensex rally puts TCS in big league

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, April 18: After yesterday?s stunning bonus announcement, software giant TCS today broke into the charmed club of companies with a market capitalisation of over Rs 1 lakh crore ? only to drop out of it at the close of trading.

 TCS became only the sixth company to join the big league when its stock soared to an all-time high of Rs 2,099, on a day the sensex soared 281 points to end at 11821.57. But by the close of trading, TCS? market capitalisation fell to Rs 98,481.41 crore as its stock fell.

 TCS had jumped 5.60 per cent at Rs 2,009.50 at the start. Also, news that the company was expecting to clinch a $500-million deal provided the ballast to the stock. 

 There are only three companies which still remain members of the club: ONGC, RIL and NTPC. Two others ? Infosys and Wipro ? became members of the club in the bull run of 2000 but have since melted away.

 ONGC has the largest market capitalisation at Rs 1,86,447.48 crore, followed by RIL with Rs 1,24,196.58 crore and NTPC with Rs 1,15,065.39 crore. TCS in the fourth position is followed by Infosys and Wipro. 

 The stock market continued its upward journey today and finished at an all-time high with investors lapping up technology, cement and banking stocks. 

 The bellwether BSE sensex moved in a range of about 150 points and ended the day at 11821.57 points, registering a spurt of 281.89 points or 2.45 per cent. The Nifty closed with a gain of 93 points or 2.71 per cent at 3518.10. 

 With todays rise, the sensex has gained 584.34 points or 5.2 per cent in the last two trading sessions after plunging 425 points in two trading sessions before the rally. 

 The better-than-expected results posted by TCS coupled with the surprise bonus issue coming on back of the strong guidance by Infosys saw the BSE IT index gaining the highest at 3.77 per cent amongst the sectoral indices. 

 Banking stocks also hogged the limelight with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) leaving the key short-term interest rate unchanged. The BSE Bankex rose 1.43 per cent. 

 Amongst the PSU bank stocks, State Bank of India, Corporation Bank, Syndicate Bank and Punjab National Bank were up, while UTI bank, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and IndusInd bank were the major gainers in the private sector. 

 Oil prices surged to a record high above $72 on concerns that Irans nuclear stand-off with the West could cut oil exports from the worlds fourth-largest crude exporter. In London, North Sea Brent crude oil jumped 74 cents to an all-time high of $72.20 a barrel. While refinery shares such as HPCL and BPCL lost, ONGC surged 4.65 per cent to Rs 1,301.10. 

 Bajaj Auto was the biggest gainer, up 8.55 per cent to Rs 3,004 and hit a new all-time high of Rs 3,023.75. The total turnover on BSE amounted to Rs 4,640 crore, higher than yesterday. The market breadth was positive with 1,464 shares advancing and 1,052 declining, while 67 shares remained unchanged. 

 However, the mood forward is cautious, according to the marketmen. Says Arun Kejriwal, director, KRIS, quot;Coming as a surprise in the prevalent negative mood of the market, the better than expected results of Infosys, TCS and Gujarat Ambuja created euphoria amongst investors. But, now the benchmark has been set, further upside would have to be backed by even better numbers from other corporates. quot; 

 There may also be overhang of huge IPO pipeline as this would curtail money available in the secondary market. An estimated Rs 45,000 crore would be raised by corporates in fiscal 2007 from the primary market. 

 However, the latest data shows that in contrast to the recent heavy sell-off, the FIIs have resumed buying. They bought shares worth a net of Rs 252.90 crore on April 17, much higher than the provisional net inflow figure of Rs 92.78 crore for that day released by stock exchanges after trading hours on Monday. 

 The US markets had ended in the negative on Monday, as crude oil and gold prices scaled record peaks.

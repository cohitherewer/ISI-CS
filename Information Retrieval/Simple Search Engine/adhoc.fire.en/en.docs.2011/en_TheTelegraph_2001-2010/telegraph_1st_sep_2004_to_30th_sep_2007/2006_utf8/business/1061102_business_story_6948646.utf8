The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Stage set for joint oil hunt with Norway

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 1: ONGC and OIL were in a huddle throughout the day with Norwegian state-owned companies Statoil and Norsk Hydro to pave the way for an agreement on joint exploration activities.

 Senior government officials from both sides also participated in the discussions. 

 A memorandum of understanding for the hydrocarbon sector is expected to be signed tomorrow in the presence of petroleum minister Murli Deora, his Norwegian counterpart and the crown prince of Norway.

 Norwegian companies have cutting-edge technology in deep-sea oil exploration, which the Indian firms are keen to tap as they have not been able to strike a major oil find despite heavy investments. They feel that Norwegian technical knowhow could provide the necessary breakthrough.

 The Oil India-Indian Oil combine and ONGC are looking at tie-ups with Statoil and Norsk Hydro for technical collaboration and joint ventures in the upstream sector.

 The Indian companies are also keen on jointly scouting for oil and gas in Africa, Latin America, Russia and the Caspian region.

 ONGC has already roped in Norsk Hydro in a joint venture for oil exploration in the deep-sea areas of Cuba. Although Norsk Hydro has a small share in equity, it is the technical expertise of the company that ONGC is banking on for a breakthrough.

 Cairn IPO

 Cairn Energy of UK will raise at least $1.8 billion from the proposed initial public offering (IPO) of its Indian operations in December.

 Part of the proceeds, which would be $1.9 billion if an over-allotment option is exercised in full, would be used to fund its ongoing business while the balance would be returned to shareholders, Cairn said.

 Of the total proceeds from the sale of 538.47 million shares of Cairn India Ltd, the Indian subsidiary would retain only Rs 2,700 crore ($600 million) and the remaining funds may go to shareholders of the UK firm.

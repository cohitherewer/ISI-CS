 Rs 1200-cr Bilt prop for capacity hike 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Paper plenty

 New Delhi, Aug 22: Ballarpur Industries Ltd (Bilt) will infuse approximately Rs 1,200 crore to expand the capacities of both its domestic and overseas units.

 The leading paper manufacturer is eyeing one-million-tonne capacity by 2008 to be figured amongst the top 10 producers in Asia.

 For the domestic units, Rs 900 crore will be invested in the next two years, which will see our capacity increase by 2.5 lakh tonnes by June 2008, said B. Hariharan, Bilt group finance director. 

 As for overseas expansion, the company has chalked out plans to invest approximately Rs 276 crore in the next three years on the pulp capacity expansion of Sabah Forest Industries in Malaysia, which it had acquired recently. 

 The pulp capacity of Sabah will go up by one lakh tonne from the current 1.2 lakh tonnes, while the paper production capacity is expected to increase by about 25,000 tonnes from the current 1.4 lakh tonnes through de-bottlenecking, he added.

 With this, Bilts capacity will touch the one-million-tonne mark, which will put it among the top 10 producers in Asia, he said, adding that it would propel the company to gain the slot of top 50 producers globally. 

 Meanwhile, announcing its annual results, the company today posted an increase of 67.72 per cent in net profit after taxation to Rs 67.88 crore for the quarter ended June 30 from Rs 40.47 crore for the same quarter in 2005-06.

 The total income (net of excise) increased 11.07 per cent to Rs 529.69 crore for the fourth quarter ended June 30, from Rs 476.86 crore for the corresponding quarter a year ago, the company informed the Bombay Stock Exchange.

 The board at its meeting today recommended a final dividend of 27.5 per cent on equity shares.

 Bilt posted a net profit after taxation of Rs 212 crore for the year ended June 30 compared with Rs 168.09 crore a year ago. Total income (net of excise) increased to Rs 1,880.37 crore for the year ended June 30 from Rs 1,800.29 crore in 2005-06.

 With the increasing input costs, especially that of pulp, the company is also looking at revising the prices of its products. We are looking at increasing the prices of coated paper by about Rs 750 per tonne with effect from September, Bilt joint managing director R.R. Vederah said. 

 The company had in July increased the prices of coated paper by Rs 1,000 per tonne and that of uncoated paper by Rs 600.

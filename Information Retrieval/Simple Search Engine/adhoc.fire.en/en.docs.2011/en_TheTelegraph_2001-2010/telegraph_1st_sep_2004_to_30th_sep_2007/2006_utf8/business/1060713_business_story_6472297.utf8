 Industry maintains growth momentum

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, July 12: A good show by the manufacturing sector in May helped the country maintain its double-digit industrial growth for the month. The sector retained its growth momentum of 11.3 per cent in May compared with the year-ago month, the Central Statistical Organisation said today. 

 However, due to poor performance by the mining and power sectors, the industrial growth rate at 10 per cent was lower than 10.8 per cent in the same month of last fiscal. 

 Mining growth declined to 3 per cent from 5.2 per cent in May 2005, while electricity plunged to a mere 4.7 per cent growth from a strong 10.5 per cent in May 2005. 

 The strong performance in the manufacturing sector pulled the overall index of industrial production marginally up to 9.8 per cent during April-May of the current fiscal compared with 9.5 per cent in the corresponding period of 2005-06. 

 In April-May 2006-07, manufacturing shot up by 10.9 per cent from 10.3 per cent last fiscal. Electricity growth was lower at 5.3 per cent compared with 6.7 per cent and mining production rose only 3.2 per cent against 4 per cent in the same period last fiscal. 

 Analysts see the growth in the manufacturing sector as a healthy sign as it has the potential of generating employment and signifies a growth in goods produced in the country.

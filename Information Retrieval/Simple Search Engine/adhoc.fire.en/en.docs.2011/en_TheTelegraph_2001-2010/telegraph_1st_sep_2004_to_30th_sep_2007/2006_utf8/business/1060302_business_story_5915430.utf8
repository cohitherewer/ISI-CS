 Morgan buys stake in real estate firm

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, March 1: The booming real estate business in the country got another boost today when Morgan Stanley infused $68 million into the Bangalore-based Mantri Developers Private Ltd. 

 Mantri Developers is into residential, commercial and retail space development in and around Bangalore. 

 This is Morgan Stanleys first foray into the Indian real estate market. 

 After the relaxation of foreign direct investment limit last year, India has emerged as a global investment destination for real estate. 

 Quite a few real estate developers from West Asia and Southeast Asia have already invested in the country. Some US-based funds like AIG, GE, Hines have also infused money into various projects all over India. A steady increase in demand from the end user has fuelled rapid growth in the residential and commercial space.

 We were looking at going beyond Bangalore and exploring other cities in South India. That is where the investment by Morgan Stanley will help us, Sushil Mantri, managing director of Mantri Developers said talking to The Telegraph from Bangalore. The company is 100 per cent owned by the Mantri family. 

 We have diluted a minority stake in the company to Morgan Stanley, but the family is still the major stake holder, he said refusing to give the size of the stake sold. 

 Mantri Developers is planning to use the fund to spread its wings across south India. 

 We are looking at expanding our operations to Hyderabad, Chennai and Cochin. Part of the money will also help us in our ongoing project in Bangalore, he said. The company has close to six million square feet area under construction in Bangalore. 

 Fund remittance has already taken place, he added. 

 India presents an extremely compelling investment story and expect to be a long-term investor in the real estate sector, Sonny Kalsi, Morgan Stanleys global head of real estate investment, said in a statement. 

 This investment shows the confidence that the global funds have on the Indian realty story, said Anuj Puri, MD, Trammell CrowMeghraj, a real estate consulting firm. According to him, the demand in the market is fuelled by the end-consumer and in order to fulfil the demand, there is room for supply. An increase in demand will definitely lead to more investment to fund supply, Puri added. 

 Morgan Stanley has acquired $73.1 billion of property assets worldwide. In Asia, the bank has concentrated on Japan and China, where it owns 55 per cent of a joint venture that bought $340 million of distressed property assets from China Construction Bank.

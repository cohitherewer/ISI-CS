 More SEZs only after review

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Nath: Wait and watch

 New Delhi, Aug. 23: The government will consider proposals for setting up more SEZs only after an empowered group of ministers inspects the zones that are already operational, commerce minister Kamal Nath said today.

 Talking to reporters after a meeting of the empowered group of ministers here, Nath said the group would meet to decide on more zones after 75 of the 150 SEZs that have been approved become operational in the next 5-6 months.

 There is no limit on the number of SEZs that can be approved, he added.

 The decision will, at least for the time being, put on hold approvals for new SEZs, including those proposed by Korean steel major Posco in Orissa and Vedantas aluminium project in Orissa.

 On the Lefts demand to review the entire SEZ policy, he said Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had written to him on the need for setting up more such zones.

 The meeting was held to consider raising the cap of 150 SEZs in the country as another 200 proposals are pending with the board. The EGoM, headed by defence minister Pranab Mukherjee, met today to take a decision as there are sharp differences between the commerce and finance ministries over SEZs.

 While the commerce ministry wanted the cap to be raised to at least 300, the finance ministry said the present cap of 150 should be retained. The finance ministry feels that more SEZs could lead to a huge drain of revenue with almost all new manufacturing units coming up only in these zones to take advantage of tax breaks.

 The EGoM, in which both commerce minister Kamal Nath and finance minister P. Chidambaram are members, met after Nath had written a letter to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on the need to review the cap.

 He had said the pending proposals 

 could bring in an additional $5 billion investment besides 

 employment to 15 lakh people.

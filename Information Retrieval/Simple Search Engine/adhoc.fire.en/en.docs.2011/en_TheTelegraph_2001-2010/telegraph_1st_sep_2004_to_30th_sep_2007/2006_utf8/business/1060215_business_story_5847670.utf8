 Small units to step up infotech spend

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Feb. 14: Small and medium businesses (SMBs) across the subcontinent will spend $7.7 billion on upgrading infotech infrastructure. This is 26 per cent more than the amount spent last year.

 The study was conducted by the New York-based AMI-Partners, which shows one-third of the SMBs in India anticipated a 20 per cent increase in their annual revenues and are, therefore, willing to increase their IT spending.

 Companies like Hewlett-Packard India have about 1.5 lakh SMB customers and are adding around 20000 every quarter, said Ashok Pamidi, director commercial accounts and base business, Hewlett-Packard India.

 With an increasingly competitive market and globalisation challenges, medium businesses are emphasising on upgrading their IT infrastructure to get a competitive edge, said Partha Sarathi Sengupta, research analyst of AMI-Partners.

 Hewlett-Packard India is also focusing on the mid-market segment of the SMB that caters to 500 to 1000 users, Pamidi said.

 The study said a majority of the Indian medium businesses are in the second stage of IT adoption while several have moved to the third stage and are competing with large infotech firms.

 A part of the responsibilities of the Indian arm of Sun Microsystems Global Financing Services (SMGFS) would be to cater to the SMBs with easy-financing options for Suns server and storage products. Multi-client funding models will be chalked out by Rentworks, GE Capital and UTI Bank with which Sun has revenue-sharing agreements.

 According to the survey, medium businesses will focus on networking.

 Sengupta said a number of such businesses are looking at increasing workforce and expanding, entailing more connectivity and networking.

 Storage is another sector where the expenditure is expected to grow to 44 per cent this year. The firms will focus on capabilities to handle greater data volumes and data security.

 According to statistics for storage revenue from July 2004 to June 2005 by International Data Corporation, a market research company, Sun is the largest storage player with a growth rate of 178 per cent. The Indian small business market comprises 7.5 million setups, of which 21 per cent currently utilises personal computers. The study reveals that 40 per cent of the non-PC small businesses plan to purchase 1.4 desktops on an average next year.

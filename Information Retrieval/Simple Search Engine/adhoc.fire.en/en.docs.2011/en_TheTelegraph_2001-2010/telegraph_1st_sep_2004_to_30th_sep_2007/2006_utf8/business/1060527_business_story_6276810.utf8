 Hind Lever sells Quest stake to ICI for Rs 54 cr

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, May 26: Hindustan Lever Limited has divested its 49 per cent stake in Quest International India to ICI India for Rs 54 crore. 

 Quest International, previously a joint venture with HLL, will now be wholly-owned by paints major ICI India.

 ICI India had acquired a majority stake (51 per cent) in Quest International, engaged in the fragrances, flavours and food ingredients business, in 2001 for a consideration of Rs 152 crore.

 Quest International had been formed under the joint venture arrangement between HLL, ICI India and Quest International BV, where ICI India and Quest International BV held 51 per cent and the balance 49 per cent was with HLL.

 HLL held 14,11,200 shares of the total 28,80,000 equity shares of Quest. 

 The joint venture arrangement between ICI and HLL was for a period of five years, which expired in March 2006 and after that ICI had the right to buy the remaining shareholding in Quest. 

 ICI had earlier expressed the interest to buy the shareholding from HLL as flavours and fragrances are core business areas for the company. 

 According to analysts, HLL has been exiting its non-core businesses, and an exit from this segment too is in line with that strategy. HLL had recently sold off its coconut oil brand Nihar to Marico. 

 In keeping with its new strategy to focus on its core businesses, FMCG major Hindustan Lever Ltd today announced the divestment of its nickel catalyst business to ICI India Ltd for a consideration of Rs 21 crore. 

 The nickel catalyst business, a sub-unit of the speciality chemicals division of HLLs chemicals and agri operations, is being sold on a going-concern basis, amp;apos; the company said. 

 An HLL statement said ICI will take over the manufacturing facilities of its nickel catalyst operations that forms part of the Taloja Factory near Mumbai. The plants 17 employees will also be transferred to ICI, it added. 

 The transfer of the business, to be concluded after completion of certain regulatory and other formalities, will result in a profit of around Rs 12.5 crore for HLL. The company added the transfer of its nickel catalyst operations, which has an annual turnover of around Rs 20 crore, to ICI, will secure the future of the business and related employees. 

 The Unilever subsidiary had, on a previous occasion, tied up with ICI, when it concluded a tripartite venture with ICI and Quest International - maker of fragrances and flowers - where ICI and Quest together held 51 per cent and HLL had 49 per cent. The 51 per cent stake was valued approximately at Rs 155 crore, including a premium for management control.

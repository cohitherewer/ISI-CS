 Hurdles to SAIL-Neelachal merger

 DEBABRATA MOHANTY

 Bhubaneswar, April 22: The proposed merger of Orissa-based Neelachal Ispat Nigam with the Steel Authority of India Limited may get delayed as the companies are yet to decide on the merchant bankers who would assess NINL.

 SAIL has raised some doubts about Srei Caps and Allianz Securities ? the two merchant bankers who have submitted their bids ? and is keen to appoint SBI Caps and Ernst amp; Young, who missed the bid deadline, as merchant bankers.

 Last month, SAIL had floated a tender for a merchant banker who will determine the shares/business value of the 1.2-million-tonne pig iron-maker based in Kalinganagar industrial complex of Jajpur district. Last year, the Centre had decided to merge NINL, promoted jointly by MMTC and the Orissa government, with SAIL.

 By April 6, the last date for submission of bids, only two firms ? Delhi-based Allianz Securities and Calcutta-based Srei Caps ? had put in their bids. 

 Bidders were to be assessed by their experience in valuation of businesses and shares for the purpose of mergers and acquisitions and their experience of the manufacturing sector. The four-member selection committee, comprising two members from NINL and two from SAIL, would evaluate the bidders based on their presentation.

 However, Ernst amp; Young and SBI Caps submitted their bids after the due date. Though the two should ideally be disqualified according to the bid conditions, SAIL officials are keen on getting one of them as bankers. 

 While the Orissa government officials are happy with Srei Caps and Allianz Securities, SAIL is not too keen on these two and is instead interested in SBI Caps and Ernst amp;Young, who have handled some of their issues in the past.

 There is now a confusion over opening of bids. Unless SAIL asks me to open the two bids, I cant do so. I am waiting for their instructions, said a member of the committee. 

 With the selection of the merchant banker getting delayed, the whole process of merger is likely to be stalled for now. The merchant banker would take two months to assess NINLs assets, while the process of merger may take up anything between 8 to 10 months, said NINL managing director S.K. Sarna.

Official sources said Srei Caps and Allianz Securities, 

the two who bid within the due date, have adequate experience in assessing state-run 

utilities. Sources said SAIL authorities are apprehensive of the two quoting a 

higher price for NINL shares, which would raise the price of the merger.

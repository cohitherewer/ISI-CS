 Panel to vet free trade with Europe 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 1: India and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), comprising Switzerland, Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland, will set up a joint study group to explore the possibility of entering into a broad-based trade and investment agreement.

 The agreement to set up the joint study group was signed today at a meeting of the EFTA council in Geneva in the presence of commerce minister Kamal Nath, EFTA council chairperson Doris Leuthard and ministers from all other member countries.

 Nath said: We share a warm and friendly relationship with EFTA states. There cannot be any better way to strengthen these relationships than by talking about enhancing trade and investment flows. We are looking forward to a deeper economic engagement with EFTA.

 The study would examine all aspects of the existing bilateral economic relationship between India and the EFTA and recommend measures to deepen economic engagement by expanding two-way trade and investment flows.

 The first meeting of the joint study group is scheduled to be held in February 2007. The proposed agreement will cover trade in goods and services, investment, trade facilitation, technical standards, intellectual property rights and dispute settlement.

 EFTA was founded in 1960 to achieve growth and prosperity among its member states as well as promote closer economic cooperation between western European nations.

 Bilateral trade between India and EFTA in 2005-06 was $7.4 billion, comprising exports of $623.11 million and imports of $6852.25 million.

 The study group would be co-chaired by Rahul Khullar, additional secretary (Europe division) in the department of commerce, from the Indian side, and an official to be designated by the EFTA.

 The study group will meet alternatively in New Delhi and Geneva and has been asked to give its report within a year. 

 Nath said, India and the EFTA states have strong complementarities between economies. 

 Harnessing these complementarities will result in widening and deepening our trade basket. The strong technology orientation of EFTA states can be gainfully coupled with the huge skilled human resources base of India to yield rich dividends on both sides.

 Calcutta, Jan. 28: Usha Martin Ltd, the second largest wire and wire rope manufacturer in the world, is exploring the possibility of entering into China, the worlds largest market for wire and wire ropes.

 It is a very large market and also a complex market. We are studying what could be the best route to cater to this market, B.K. Jhawar, chairman of Usha Martin Ltd, said today. 

 Usha Martin may either set up its own manufacturing unit there or develop a marketing tie-up, P. Bhattacharya, joint managing director of the company, added.

 The consumption of wire and wire ropes in China is estimated at 350,000 tonnes annually, but a significant part of it consists of low grade products which UML is not keen to cater to.

 We will only look at the high value-added segment, Bhattacharya said.

 While Usha Martins China foray is still at a discussion stage, the company is set to start production at its US facility by the end of this year.

 The construction work at the Houston plant has already started and the first phase of the 6,000-tonne unit would be fully operational by early 2007.

 Usha Martin, which has floated a wholly owned subsidiary for its US operations, will invest Rs 46 crore in the facility which will have a total capacity of 25,000 tonnes.

 The US plant will cater to the high-end market in that country and is expected to generate an annual revenue of Rs 100 crore for the company. 

 Usha Martin currently has operations in the UK, Thailand and Dubai and it produces a total of 75,000 tonnes of wire ropes.

 Third-quarter result

 Usha Martin has posted an after-tax profit of Rs 16.50 crore for the third quarter ended December 31, 2005. This quarterly profit is 83 per cent more than the previous corresponding figure.

 Gross sales of the company for the quarter was reported at Rs 353.42 crore, while net sales was Rs 315.80 crore.

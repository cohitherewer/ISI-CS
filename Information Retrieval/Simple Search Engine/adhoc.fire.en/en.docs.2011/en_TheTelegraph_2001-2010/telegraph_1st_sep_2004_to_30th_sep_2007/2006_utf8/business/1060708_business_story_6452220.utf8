 Big plans for Nigeria

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, July 7: If the ONGC-Mittal combine strikes oil in the two Nigerian blocks, it is ready to invest $6 billion in downstream projects and related infrastructure such as power plants and railway lines.

 The duo has paid a signature bonus of $50 million for one block and $65 million for the other. (Signature bonus is an upfront fee to a country before initiating exploration.)

 The two deepwater blocks were picked up for exploration after a seismic survey revealed their potential.

 Lakshmi Mittal said today that he was very happy with progress made in Nigeria, merely a year of joining hands with ONGC-Videsh.

 He said the investments in the power, railways and downstream refinery sector have been calibrated with the prospective returns from the oilfields. 

 The blocks are in the Gulf of Guinea, reportedly an oil-rich deepwater region where four major discoveries have been made in the last eight years.

 As much as 25 per cent of the Nigerias reserves are in the deepwater area off the countrys coast. Nigeria is a focus region of the worlds leading oil companies, including Chevron, Texaco, British Gas, ExxonMobil, Shell, Total of France and Petrobas of Brazil.

 ONGC Mittal Energy (Omel), the joint venture company of Mittal Steel and ONGC, has recently won blocks OPL 209 and OPL 212 in the Nigeria 2006 mini bid round. 

 The recoverable reserves potential estimated from a few clearly delineated prospects in the blocks are expected to be over one billion barrels of oil and oil equivalent gas.

 ONGC Mittal Energy is registered in Cyprus. ONGC Videsh, the overseas arm of ONGC, holds 49.98 per cent equity and Mittal Investment Sarl holds 48.02 per cent. The balance 2 per cent is with SBI Caps.

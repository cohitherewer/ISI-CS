 Delivery of A380 on schedule

 Singapore, Feb. 20 (AP): Airbus today said the first delivery of the worlds largest commercial jet, the A380, would not be affected by the failure of the jets wing in a stress test last week. Its not a big problem at all. We hope and expect it to be relatively minor, said John Leahy, Airbuss chief operating officer, on the sidelines of a briefing ahead of the Asian Aerospace Exhibition.

 Before certifying an airliner for commercial service, aviation authorities set its limit loads ? the maximum strain each part is likely to be placed under during extreme turbulence or hard landings. New planes are required to resist loads of 1.5 times the limit.

 The A380 wing had ruptured sooner than expected during ground testing in Toulouse last Tuesday, reaching only 1.45 times its limit load before breaking ? 3.3 per cent short of target. The wing had been bent upward by 24.3 feet at the tip. Leahy said there should not be any major modifications to the design of the plane.

 Fitch rating tribute to fiscal health

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Aug. 1: The countrys strong fundamentals have prompted Fitch Ratings to upgrade the sovereign debt rating to investment grade. 

 The long-term foreign and local currency issuer default ratings (IDRs) were upgraded to BBB- from BB+, with both getting stable outlooks. 

 The short-term foreign currency IDR was raised to F3 from B and the country ceiling upgraded to BBB- from BB+.

 This upgrade reflects Fitchs view that fiscal consolidation is at last taking hold in India, reinforced by the impressive growth story and strong external balance sheet, said Paul Rawkins, senior director in Fitchs sovereign team in London.

 Rawkins noted that public finances were still weak but were no longer an insuperable constraint. 

 Moodys Investors Services had earlier assigned an investment grade to Indias debt. It had raised the countrys long-term foreign currency rating to investment grade Baa3, taking into consideration the reduction in external vulnerability, rise in foreign investment and a vibrant economy. 

 However, Standard amp; Poors assigned a rating that was a notch lower than Moodys.

 The upgrade by Fitch has generated expectations of S amp;P re-rating India. 

 Analysts said the Fitch upgrade could prop up the rupee on rising foreign investments.

 Fitch said since it started rating from 2001, it perceived for the first time a near universal commitment among the Centre and the states on fiscal consolidation. This change in attitude along with a more concrete programme of fiscal consolidation have mitigated fears of weak public finances impairing Indias strong external financial position.

 Although still high, revised data show the general government deficit declining to 7.7 per cent in 2005-06 from 10.1 per cent of GDP in fiscal year 2001-02, the agency said. 

 The lower deficit is an outcome of not only higher growth and lower interest rates but also improved tax administration and widening of the tax net. 

 Modest tightening at the Centre has been matched by parallel progress among Indias 25 states and Union Territories, many of which have introduced value-added tax and enacted fiscal responsibility legislation over the past year, Fitch said. 

 It said the country has shown it was capable of sustaining a much higher debt than many of its peers. The strengths are an established track record of macroeconomic stability, low inflation and a high domestic savings rate coupled with a deep domestic capital market and external capital controls, it said.

 The strategy of structural reforms in a phased manner is bearing fruit with the economy growing at 8.5 per cent per annum since 2003-04, notwithstanding the oil shock, an earlier precursor of which brought the economy to its knees in the early 1990s.

 New Delhi, Nov. 28: Italian carrier Eurofly will launch direct flights from New Delhi to Rome from January 15 to cater to the growing demand of overseas travellers. It also aims to increase passenger traffic by at least 10 per cent in two years.

 The company will fly 256-seater Airbus A330s between the two capitals three times a week each way. A round-trip economy class ticket will cost Rs 20,000 plus taxes and a business class ticket will come for Rs 79,000 plus taxes, said Armando Brunini, executive vice-president of Eurofly.

 We are filling a gap ... And (would) mainly cater to tourist traffic between the two countries, Brunini said.

 With aggressive pricing, coupled with Indian cuisine and in-flight entertainment, the company hopes to stimulate traffic to Rome by 10 per cent in the next two years, he said. Initially, the airline sees 60 per cent of passenger revenue coming from traffic originating from Italy, with the scenario getting reversed in two years. The private airline is in talks with more than one Indian company for infrastructure and re-fuelling and for providing linkage to domestic destinations. He, however, refused to divulge the details.

 We are in talks with more than one Indian company and the deal should be through soon, Brunini said.

 Indias travel and tourism industry is the third fastest growing globally after China and Montenegro. It is currently worth $38.8 billion, said Mario Mendio, director (marketing amp; business development) of Eurofly.

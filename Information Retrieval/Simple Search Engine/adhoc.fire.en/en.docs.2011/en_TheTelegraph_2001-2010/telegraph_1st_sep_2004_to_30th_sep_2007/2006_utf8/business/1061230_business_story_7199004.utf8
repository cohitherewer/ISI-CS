 Stake sale move to revive Alitalia

 Getting ready to take off

 Milan, Dec. 29 (Reuters): Italy opened the bidding process for state-controlled Alitalia on Friday, hoping private investors will succeed in reviving the unprofitable carrier after repeated injections of state aid failed to do so.

 Italy has invited offers of interest for at least 30.1 per cent of Alitalias shares, and as much as the entire Treasury stake of 49.9 percent, until January 29, 2007, the Treasury said.

 In setting the terms of the bidding process, the Treasury said the buyers must keep a stake of at least 30.1 per cent in Alitalia until they met the targets of their industrial plan, as well as maintain the carriers national identity.

 Under Italian law, a buyer of more than 30 per cent of a company must make a public offer for the rest of the outstanding shares.

 Alitalia must change and that means not tying investors hands, cutting in half the staff, choosing between the two hubs of Milan and Rome, finding an industrial partner for the high growth routes to the Far East, said Claudio Morsenchio, a fund manager at Banco Emiliano Romagnolo in Bologna, Italy.

 Its a challenge. Its a question of being willing to change. Otherwise theyll continue with the strikes and with one flight out of two being late.

 Alitalia, which has a market capitalisation of 1.37 billion euros, has not made an operating profit in the last 5 years. The last time it posted a net profit was in 2002, and that only after Dutch carrier KLM paid it 200 million euros to break an alliance.

 Since his appointment in 2004, chief executive officer Giancarlo Cimoli repeatedly clashed with the carriers 10 unions as he cut a fifth of the workforce and split the carrier into two, putting the services and maintenance units into a separate company called AZ Servizi with the aim of selling them.

 Yet Alitalia remains unprofitable. Due to a legacy of purchasing choices made for political purposes, it operates five different types of aircraft built by as many manufacturers, multiplying maintenance and pilot-training costs.

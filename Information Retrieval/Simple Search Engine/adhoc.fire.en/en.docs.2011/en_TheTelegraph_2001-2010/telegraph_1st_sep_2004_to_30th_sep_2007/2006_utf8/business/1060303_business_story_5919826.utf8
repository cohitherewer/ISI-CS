 Cola firms pocket the change

 Comes at a cost

 New Delhi, March 2: Cola prices aren?t going to go down after the 8 per cent reduction in excise duty in Tuesday?s budget ? and you can blame it all on the hassle of doling out loose change at retail points.

 The number crunchers at the cola giants ? Coke and Pepsi ? have worked out that the proposal to scrap the 8 per cent special excise duty on aerated water and bring down the excise levy to a flat 16 per cent will translate into a benefit of 23 to 28 paise per 300 ml bottle.

 So, the cola giants have decided to keep the change ? thank you very much.

 ?This is too small a difference to pass on to the consumers,? sources said.

 Rajeev Bakshi, chairman of PepsiCo India Ltd, said, ?We are grateful that the soft drink industry has been given a level-playing field. This should release the resources for us and our Indian bottling partners to make the required investments in cooling infrastructure and distribution, which are the major drivers of growth in our sector.?

 But there?s a niggling question of ethics: should companies pocket duty benefits and use the money to invest in their retail infrastructure?

 The aerated drink makers had been lobbying hard for the removal of the special excise duty, arguing that it was discriminatory since it was the only food product that had to bear the levy.

 The Indian Soft Drinks Manufacturers? Association said the removal of the special excise duty (SED) had brought the soft drinks industry on a par with other items in the food processing sector. 

 Beverage industry officials pointed out that the prices of soft drinks have either remained stable or have fallen since 1999 while the costs have gone up by 60 per cent. 

 ?With the removal of SED, a long-standing anomaly has been corrected since the soft drinks have now been brought on a par with other processed food items. This is also in keeping with the finance minister?s mission of bringing the indirect tax rates on a par with the Cenvat rate of 16 per cent,? said a senior executive with Coca Cola.

 The industry is hoping that the removal of the levy will spur consumption. The per capita consumption of aerated waters in the country is around 9 bottles per year, which is about half the level in countries like Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Thailand.

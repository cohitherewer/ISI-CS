 Boston Scientific in Guidant final offer

 SCAN IT CLOSE

 Chicago/Philadelphia, Jan. 9 (Reuters): Boston Scientific Corp on Sunday formalised its $25-billion cash and stock offer to acquire Guidant Corp in a move to woo the medical-device maker away from its existing merger partner, Johnson amp; Johnson.

 The purchase of Guidant would give Boston Scientific access to the $10-billion market for pacemakers and defibrillators, devices that help regulate heart beats and the main drivers in J amp;Js bid for Guidant.

 The price of Boston Scientifics definitive offer is the same as the preliminary proposal it made last month, but it is 12 per cent higher than J amp;Js $22.3 billion agreement to buy Guidant. Boston Scientifics bid also includes protection against a fluctuation in its stock price.

 Guidants board will probably take its sweet time with the offer and if the board endorses it, itll be the death knell for J amp;Js offer, said WBB Securities analyst Steve Brozak.

 Boston Scientific also forged a side deal to sell two Guidant units to Abbott Laboratories Inc for $4.3 billion to help ease regulatory review of the deal.

 The sale of those units is conditional on Boston Scientific completing the purchase of Guidant. 

 Under the agreement, Abbott would pay $3.8 billion upfront, plus two instalments of $250 million each upon regulatory approval of certain products.

 Boston Scientific, which makes cardiovascular devices and products used in oncology and urology, set a January 19 deadline for Guidant to respond to the definitive offer. Guidant, based in Indianapolis, said its board would evaluate all aspects of the offer.

 The door for a rival suitor opened after J amp;J slashed the price of its takeover offer in November following safety concerns and litigation over Guidants heart products.

 Health-care conglomerate J amp;J, based in New Brunswick, New Jersey, said it still expects to close its purchase of Guidant. It said the deal has received regulatory approval and Guidants shareholders are scheduled to vote on the agreement on January 31.

 Brozak said he expects Boston Scientifics bid to win.

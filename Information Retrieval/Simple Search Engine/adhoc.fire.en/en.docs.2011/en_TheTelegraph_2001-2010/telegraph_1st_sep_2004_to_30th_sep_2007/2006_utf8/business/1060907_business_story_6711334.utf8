 New Delhi, Sept. 6: The government has no problem if Suzuki Motor of Japan decides to pick Nissan as the partner for Marutis new plant at Manesar near Gurgaon. 

 Heavy industries minister Santosh Mohan Dev today communicated this to Osamu Suzuki, chairman of Suzuki Motor, which owns a majority stake in Maruti.

 Dev told reporters that we want to attract more companies to India. Talking about Nissans planned entry, the minister said, The more, the merrier.

 Suzuki is believed to have briefed the minister about the companys $1.5-billion plan to set up a new car plant. During the 30-minute meeting, Suzuki said the company would need the governments help to gain smooth access to a suitable port with good rail or road connectivity so that the company could export its cars. 

 Dev said he had assured the Suzuki chairman that his ministry would take up the issue with the authorities concerned and facilitate the companys export plans.

 The minister said the new Suzuki plant would produce cars for both the domestic and the export markets. 

 The Suzuki Motor boss told Dev that the company was studying the international market and, depending on the emerging demand pattern, would require suitable port facilities to ship out its products.

 The top management of Maruti, including managing director Jagdish Khattar, was present during the meeting.

 At present, Hyundai is ahead of Maruti as it has established a good export market for the Santro. Maruti, which has lower export volumes, would like to compete in this segment as well. 

 While Suzuki is a big player in small cars, Nissan has a sizeable presence in the big car segment. The two have decided to compliment each other globally. Nissan and Suzuki plan to start manufacturing collaboration in new emerging markets by sharing their respective manufacturing facilities.

 Dev reiterated that the government would go ahead with the sale of its residual stake in Maruti once the finance ministry decides on the time when the equity would be offloaded. Chidambaram is the boss, he will decide on the timing of the sale, the minister said.

 The Maruti stake sale does not come under the disinvestment category as the car major is not a public sector enterprise, he added.

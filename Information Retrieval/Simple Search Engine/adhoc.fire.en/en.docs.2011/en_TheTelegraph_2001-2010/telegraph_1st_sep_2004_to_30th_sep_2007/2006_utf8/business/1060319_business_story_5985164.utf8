 Wal-Marts renewed bid to gain entry

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 18: Wal-Mart Stores of the US has stepped up its lobbying for an entry into the fast growing Indian retail market with a top company executive arriving here. 

 Sources said Wal-Marts vice-chairman and head of international operations Mike Duke arrived here and met top government officials making a case for the worlds leading retail chain to set up shop in India.

 Wal-Mart is trying to impress upon senior government officials that it would help modernise Indias inefficient supply chain and provide quality jobs if it were permitted to open stores here.

 Duke is reported to have assured government officials that Wal-Mart would also source goods from Indian farmers and thereby generate income and employment. 

 The retail chain has come under severe criticism even in the US for driving competitors into bankruptcy. Critics allege that Wal-Mart has been paying low wages to its workers to reduce its operational costs and this has forced Wal-Mart employees to fall back on public aid for health care. 

 Dukes is the second high profile Wal-Mart executive visiting India after John Menzer, who manages the companys business, came here last May.

 Although the government has not yet allowed foreign retailers a direct entry into domestic retail market, Wal-Mart hopes that sooner than later the country will gradually open its doors to foreign retailers. It has sought permission to open a liaison office in Bangalore to study the consumer behaviour in the country.

 Foreign direct investment in retail has been the bone of contention for quite some time as several quarters, both political and industrial, expressed apprehensions that this would throw small corner stores out of business.

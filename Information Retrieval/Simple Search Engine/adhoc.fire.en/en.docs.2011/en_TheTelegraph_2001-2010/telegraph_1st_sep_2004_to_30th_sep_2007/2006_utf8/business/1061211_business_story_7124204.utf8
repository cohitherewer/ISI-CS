 US sales of Nintendo console beat PS3

 Fun and frolic

 Los Angeles, Dec. 10 (Reuters): Nintendo Co Ltd sold 476,000 units of its new Wii video game console in the United States in November, more than twice the number of PlayStation 3s sold by rival Sony Corp, as the two consoles debuted mid-month, research group NPD said. Sonys PS3 sales came in at 197,000. Microsoft Corp sold 511,000 units of its Xbox 360 in November, according to NPD.

 The console, released just over a year ago, is locked in a three-way battle with the PlayStation 3 and Wii, which were released in mid-November amid speculation over whether Sony can maintain its dominance over the global console market after selling more than 106 million PlayStation 2 units globally.

 The Japanese electronic product maker had said it would ship 400,000 PS3s into the United States for its launch, but there has been broad industry speculation that the company had fallen far short of its initial goal.

 Nintendo has said it expects to ship 4 million Wiis worldwide by December 31, double the number of PS3s promised by Sony. Late last month, Nintendo said it sold 600,000 Wiis in the first eight days after its November 19 debut. Microsoft, which gets most of its sales from North America, is targeting 10 million global Xbox 360 shipments by the year-end.

 Nintendos Wii retails for $250, Sonys top-line PS3 retails for $600; and Microsofts Xbox 360 retails for $400.

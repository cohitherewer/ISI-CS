 Thin rise in Tata Steel net

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Oct. 30: Tata Steel today reported a 5.36 per cent rise in net profit for the second quarter of the year ended September 30. Net profit rose to Rs 1,101.49 crore compared with Rs 1,045.42 crore in the corresponding period of last year. 

 Although this growth seems modest when compared with the spectacular performance recorded by the company in the recent past, managing director B. Muthuraman said Tata Steel was one of the few steel companies in the world which has seen profits rise during the quarter. 

 Softening steel prices during the quarter has affected the optimistic projections of many in the industry. 

 During the quarter, on a standalone basis, net sales rose to Rs 4,185.75 crore from Rs 3,884.42 crore in the same period last year. While steel production rose to 12.27 lakh tonnes (12.08 lakh tonnes), sales were placed at 11.83 lakh tonnes (11.79 lakh tonnes).

 On a consolidated basis, net profit during the quarter stood at Rs 1,137.51 crore (Rs 1,112.60 crore). 

 He added there were several factors that contributed to such a strong performance at a time when prices remained soft. These included a superior product mix, focus on cost control and a stress on branding. For instance, Tata Steel consumed less raw material per tonne of steel than it did a year earlier. The situation was the same for other heads such as power. Moreover, Tata Steel also saw higher sales to the automobile industry where margins are higher.

 The Indian auto industry is growing, its not easy to supply high-quality product and such product development is not available with all steel companies, he said, while adding that in this industry, Tata Steel has a market share of 44 per cent. 

 Muthuraman also indicated that various projects announced by the company would not suffer because of the proposed alliance with the Corus group. 

 While Tata Steel is looking at a steel capacity of over 30 million tonnes by 2015 from the existing 4 million tonnes, Muthuraman said it could even touch 50 million tonnes by this date. 

 As part of the companys plan to build a strong base in India, the capacity at the Jamshedpur plant is proposed to be expanded to 10 million tonnes from 5 million tonnes. 

 The company has also lined up plans to set up ventures in countries like Iran and Bangladesh.

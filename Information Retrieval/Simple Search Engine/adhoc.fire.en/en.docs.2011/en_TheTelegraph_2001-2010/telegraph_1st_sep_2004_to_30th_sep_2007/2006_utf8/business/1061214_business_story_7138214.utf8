 Reliance steps on the gas

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Big catch

 Mumbai, Dec. 13: Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) today said that the directorate general of hydrocarbons (DGH) has approved the modified plan to develop the KG-D6 oil block in the Krishna-Godavari basin off the Andhra coast.

 The capital expenditure on the block will be $5.2 billion for 80 million metric standard cubic metre per day (mmscmd) of gas.

 Initially, RIL planned to produce 40 mmscmd from the Dhirubhai-1 and Dhirubhai-3 blocks. The proposal to DGH was submitted in May 2004 and got the approval in November that year.

 RIL, however, did more exploratory work to assess the hydrocarbon potential and the recoverable reserves. Additional 3D seismic data was collected and exploratory wells drilled, leading to 13 more discoveries.

 The company obtained independent assessment for the Dhirubhai-1 and Dhirubhai-3 blocks and applied to DGH to increase production rate to 80mmscmd from 40 mmscmd and permission to build more facilities for production, collection, evacuation and handling of gas, both onshore and offshore. 

 The development plan envisages delivery of gas from the second half of 2008-09.

 The deepwater block KG-6 was awarded to RIL and Canadas Niko Resources under the Nelp-1 bidding round. 

 RIL, as the operator, holds 90 per cent of the participating interest in the block, and Niko the rest.

 In the meantime, Reliance announced last week it has bagged two blocks in Yemen along with Hood Oil and is expected to sign the production sharing contract (PSC) next month. 

 The Reliance scrip today gained Rs 30.05, or 2.49 per cent, to close at Rs 1,238.10 against yesterdays Rs 1,208.05.

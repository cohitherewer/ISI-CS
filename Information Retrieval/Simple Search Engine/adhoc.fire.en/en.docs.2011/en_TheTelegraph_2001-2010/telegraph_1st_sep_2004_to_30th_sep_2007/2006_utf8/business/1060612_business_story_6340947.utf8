 Funds make beeline for US market

 What next?

 Last week, several central banks raised interest rates. Apart from the Reserve Bank of India, which caught the debt market off-guard by announcing a 25-basis-point rise in the repo and reverse repo rates, the central banks of Turkey, Thailand, South Korea, South Africa and the European Union all raised their rates. Most of them, including the RBI, cited inflationary pressures as the reason. But there?s another big reason: the dollar is strengthening and the last few weeks have seen capital flight from many emerging markets.

 Consider the data put out by Emerging Portfolio Fund Research (EPFR). During the three weeks to June 8, emerging market funds saw outflows of $8.36 billion. Over the same period, Europe funds saw an outflow of $2.8 billion. In contrast, US equity funds saw inflows of $3 billion in the week to June 8. Global bond funds saw net inflows during that week. Simply put, these are signs of increasing risk aversion and a flight to safety, with investors flocking to the US and to bonds.

 And if interest rates are rising across the world, global growth will slow, which in turn will pull down the price of commodities. That?s why it is still too early to talk about markets stabilising, in spite of the smart rally in the sensex and in Asia markets on Friday. The prices of metals and gold continue to be under pressure. Data from the US showed that import prices (apart from fuel) have been rising sharply, which increases the probability of the US Federal Reserve tightening interest rates. Data from Japan shows robust growth in bank lending, which is another sign that the Bank of Japan is about to end its five-year-old policy of having zero interest rates. In short, the world?s central banks are now reversing direction. After flooding the markets with liquidity in the last five years and driving interest rates down to rock bottom, the tide has well and truly turned.

 True, there have been a few false warnings. In May 2004, for example, global markets were rocked when the US first started raising interest rates. But long-term yields remained low, providing comfort that the debt-fuelled US economy would continue to grow. That cushion is no longer available ? US 10-year yields are now around 5 per cent and the housing market, a main driver of US consumption, is rapidly cooling. Even more importantly, Japanese money supply has contracted, tightening liquidity and jolting the yen ?carry trade? ? borrowing in cheap yen to fund assets all over the world.

 In short, there are just too many concerns at the moment for the markets to stabilise. A look at the Latin American stocks indices on Friday indicates that the bounce in the Asian markets is unlikely to signal an uptrend. The Mexican index was down 2.79 per cent while Brazil?s Bovespa fell 1 per cent. The good news is that FIIs have started buying in the local market, which indicates that they are seeing value at these prices.

 This is what Brad Durham, a managing director of EPFR had to say: ?A correction in global equity markets was widely expected, but I think the severity of the downturn has been surprising. To know what to expect for the future I think it is instructive to look at May 2004 when inflation and interest rate fears resulted in even sharper outflows from emerging markets and other global equity funds for a three- week period. And the damage done to investor sentiment was reflected in outflows that persisted until the beginning of November, when a major rally in fund flows and market performance began.?

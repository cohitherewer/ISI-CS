 Calcutta, May 4: Uco Banks profitability in the current fiscal may continue to be stressed because of rising interest rates, according to bank chairman V. Sridar. However, there will be no pressure on operating profits, he added.

 The city-based bank has posted a net profit of Rs 197 crore for 2005-06 compared with Rs 346 crore in the previous fiscal. However, its operating profit during the same period rose to Rs 852 crore from Rs 838 crore.

 To bolster its bottomline, Uco Bank is focusing more on increasing its fee-based income by selling third-party products such as mutual funds and insurance. For the year ended March 31, 2006, our income from mutual fund sales stood at Rs 51.50 lakh while income from sales of insurance products (both life and non-life) was Rs 9 crore. We are targeting a fee income of Rs 20 crore from these products in 2006-07, Sridar said.

 The bank today signed an agreement with Birla Sun Life Asset Management Company to sell its mutual fund products through different branches. It has already been selling mutual fund schemes of Reliance Mutual Fund, UTI Mutual Fund, ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund and Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund.

 Following an almost 100-basis-point (one percentage point) rise in interest rates between January and March, the last quarter of 2005-06, Uco Bank had to make a higher provisioning of around Rs 115 crore for depreciation and amortisation towards investments. 

 As a result, the banks net profit for 2005-06 slipped to Rs 197 crore from Rs 346 crore in the previous fiscal.

 Besides, raising deposits to fund credit growth became costlier, Sridar added. So, we deliberately went slow on deposit growth and instead sold investments and went in for market borrowings (Rs 600-700 crore), he said. 

 In the current fiscal, the bank will increase the share of low-cost deposits (current account deposits) from retail depositors such as traders and service providers.

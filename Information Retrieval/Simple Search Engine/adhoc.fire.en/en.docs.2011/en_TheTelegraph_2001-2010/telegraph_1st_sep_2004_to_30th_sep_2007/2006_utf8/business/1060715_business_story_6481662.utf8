 Crude boils, buying freedom in pipeline

 S.P.S. PANNU 

 Barrel bill

 New Delhi, July 14: The petroleum ministry is exploring the possibility of greater autonomy to public sector oil companies to buy crude. 

 The ministry wants the companies to buy cheaper varieties from new markets. This has assumed importance as international prices have skyrocketed to $78 a barrel. 

 Sources said the petroleum ministry has directed the oil companies to buy high sulphur crudes as the new refineries can process these cheaper varieties. This will raise margins which are under great strain as international crude prices have soared while domestic prices of petroleum products have not been allowed to move in tandem. 

 The ministry has also proposed a brainstorming session with the chiefs of the public sector oil companies on the issue of more autonomy to buy crude. 

 Petroleum ministry officials now attend the weekly meetings of the oil companies that decide on imports. 

 The presence of ministry officials at such meetings has been questioned as their absence would cut red-tape and facilitate quick decisions.

 While Indian Oil is based in Delhi, the brass of Hindustan Petroleum and Bharat Petroleum is in Mumbai, making it difficult to sustain a co-ordination mechanism with the ministry. 

 Until recently the ministry interacted only with IOC, which was the canalising agency for crude imports for all the companies. But with HPCL and BPCL now going in for their own imports, separate meetings have to be held for them. The flip side is that crude purchases involve huge amounts of money and the presence of ministry officials forms part of the checks and balances that have been introduced by the government.

 It remains to be seen whether such a system can be dispensed with given the delicate nature of the issue.

 Some oil company executives feel the petroleum ministry officials play a positive role in the purchases. 

 They are aware of the purchases of all the three companies as a result of which they can give a vital feedback to one company about the experience of the other, they said.

 While the three companies are making their crude purchases independently of each other, officials admit that there can be a huge saving in transport costs if there is closer co-ordination and joint buying.

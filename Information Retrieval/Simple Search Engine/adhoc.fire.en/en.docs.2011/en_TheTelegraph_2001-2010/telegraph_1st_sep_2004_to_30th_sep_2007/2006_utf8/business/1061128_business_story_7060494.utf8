 Accor in alliance for budget hotels

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi, Nov. 27: European hospitality player Accor and real estate firm Emaar MGF have formed a joint venture to develop 100 budget hotels across India in the next 10 years at an investment of $300 million. 

 The tie-up will roll out 100 hotels for budget travellers with 10,000 rooms over the next 10 years, said Mohamed Ali Alabbar, chairman of Emaar, the largest Arab real estate company by market value.

 Emaar MGF is a 50:50 joint venture between Dubai-based Emaar Properties and Delhi-based MGF Developments. The joint venture has so far brought in almost a billion dollars in FDI to develop projects spread across India, said Shravan Gupta, managing director of Emaar MGF. The unit may float an initial public offering of 5-10 per cent of its equity next year, Gupta added.

 The new venture, Budget Hotels India, will bring the Formule 1 brand of budget hotels to India.

 Accor Asia Pacific CEO David Zalmon Baffsky said: Its a 50:50 JV and we are contributing in the equity equally.

 Emaar MGF has land in India and we will identify from that which is suitable for the Formule 1 brand, he said. At present, Emaar MGF has 20 sites for developing budget hotels.

 Starting with metros, the company is looking at developing 50 hotels in the first five years of its operations, while the remaining 50 will be developed in the second phase.

 It will have a substantial impact on Indias tourism, Baffsky said.

 Alongside master-planned residential communities and special economic zones, we regard the hospitality sector as integral in our growth strategy for India, said Alabbar.

 Emaar MGF selected the budget hotel segment as a potential area for high growth as this category has only 16 per cent planned addition so far out of 50,000 branded hotel rooms in 10 cities by 2011, Gupta added.

 The Formule 1 product is ideally suited for Indias rapidly growing tourism market. India has one of the worlds most dynamic economies and there is currently a vast undersupply of quality accommodation, Accor director and CEO Gilles Pellison said. 

 Accor entered the Indian hotel market in 2004, when it signed a joint venture agreement with tourism company Interglobe, creating Interglobe Hotels.

 Accor now plans to invest $35 million as equity towards its joint venture with Interglobe. The investment could go up to $50 million, Baffsky said.

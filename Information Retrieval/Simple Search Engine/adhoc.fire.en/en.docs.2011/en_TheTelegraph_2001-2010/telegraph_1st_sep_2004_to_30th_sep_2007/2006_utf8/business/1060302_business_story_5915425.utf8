 Power gets tax break

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Lights on

 Mumbai, March 1: The power sector may have switched off its light after the budget speech yesterday, complaining lack of any serious initiative by the finance minister, but the fine print throws light on a lot that have been missed. 

 To begin with, P. Chidambaram has extended the tax holiday for this sector up to 2010. 

 Power companies that began generating electricity from April 1, 1993 had enjoyed tax benefits under Section 80IA of the income tax act. This period was supposed to have ended on March 31, 2006. However, the benefit has been extended to March 31, 2010. 

 It applies to companies that start transmission or distribution by laying a new network between April 1, 1999 and March 31, 2006. 

 Even companies undertaking substantial renovation and modernisation of the existing network of transmission lines at any time between April 1, 2004 and March 31, 2006 are eligible for deduction, said the budget note.

 The amendment will take effect from April 1, 2007 and will be applicable from 2007-08 onwards.

 In fact, the new budget also outlines projects that will benefit the sector enormously.

 The ministry of power has invited bids for five ultra-mega-power projects of 4000-mw each. Of this, two will be pit-head in Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh and three will be coastal in Gujarat, Karnataka and Maharashtra. It is our intention to award these projects before December 31, 2006, Chidambaram said in his speech. 

 He has also laid emphasis on an enabling environment for power sector reforms. 

 In order to do so, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh will establish an empowered committee of chief ministers and power ministers to look into issues affecting the sector. 

 The government also plans to give incentives for the rural electrification programme. 

 All states have signed an MoU to implement the Rajiv Gandhi Grameen Vidyutikaran Yojana. More than 10,000 villages will be electrified in the current year and, in 2006-07, 40,000 more villages will be electrified.

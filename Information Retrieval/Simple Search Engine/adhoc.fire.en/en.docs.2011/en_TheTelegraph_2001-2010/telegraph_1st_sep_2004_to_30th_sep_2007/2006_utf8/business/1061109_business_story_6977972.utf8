 VVF to buy Colgates Kansas City unit

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Nov. 8: VVF, the manufacturer of Doy and Doycare branded soaps for babies, is acquiring Colgate-Palmolives soap manufacturing facility in Kansas City for $12 million.

 Mumbai-based VVF, which has been looking for a manufacturing unit in North America for some time now, has submitted its letter-of-intent to buy the Colgate-Palmolive facility that the latter was planning to close before the end of this year. 

 In an application sent to the government of Kansas City in September, Colgate sought permission for closing down the unit by December this year. According to the rule of the state, Colgate could shut its plant within 60 days after filing all relevant applications and papers.

 Colgate-Palmolive had earlier announced its plans to close a number of its manufacturing plants across the globe and trim its manpower to reduce cost and circumvent competition.

 Colgate reportedly has agreed to the VVF offer and will sell the plant that has been producing more than 50 crore bars of soap every year.

 This will be our first manufacturing base in the US, though we have a plant in Canada. We will make it our headquarters for North America, said Piyush Jindal, vice-president of VVF Ltd. This development is significant for our global expansion, he added. 

 VVF is also the contract manufacturer of oleochemicals, soap and personal care products for leading companies in the world such as Johnson amp; Johnson, Reckitt Benckiser, Henkel, JL Morrison, Cussons, Clariant, BASF, Huntsman and Pfizer. 

 VVF will spend another $6 million on upgrading and reopening the plant next year, Jindal said.

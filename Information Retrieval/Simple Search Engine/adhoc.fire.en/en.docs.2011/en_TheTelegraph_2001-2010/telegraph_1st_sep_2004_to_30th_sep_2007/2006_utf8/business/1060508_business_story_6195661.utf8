 Independent director to join Mittals

 London, May 7 (PTI): Steel tycoon Lakshmi Mittal is likely to unveil a new heavyweight British non-executive director at the companys annual meeting in Rotterdam tomorrow, a clear attempt by the company to head off some of the criticisms of its structure.

 Whatever we do at present complies with the requirements of the New York Stock Exchange and the Amsterdam exchange (where Mittal Steel shares are listed), Mittal told The Sunday Times.

 And weve done nothing that is detrimental to shareholder interests. We will reduce the super-voting rights, and we will consider reducing them further after this transaction is completed. Arcelor has been criticising our corporate governance, but we are on an upward path, Mittal said.

 The report said even now, three-and-a-half months after the 20-billion-euro hostile bid (?13.9 billion) was announced, no offer document has been published.

 It has taken a lot longer than I thought, said Mittal.

 CSN ends recce of Corus, bid 

this week 

 London, Dec. 5 (Reuters): Brazilian steelmaker Companhia Siderurgica Nacional (CSN) has completed due diligence on its UK target Corus Group Plc but has yet to reach agreement with the steelmakers pension trustees, sources familiar with the matter said.

 CSN could table a firm offer for Corus as early as late this week, said the sources on Monday, adding that if it reaches agreement with Coruss pension trustees its board can approve a firm price. 

 Corus shareholders voted on Monday to adjourn a meeting to vote on an agreed 4.3 billion ($8.51 billion) takeover offer from Tata Steel to December 20.

 Tata made its 455 pence per share offer for Corus in October in a deal which would create the worlds fifth-largest steelmaker. 

 However, CSN has since proposed making a higher bid worth 475 pence per share and has been conducting due diligence with the help of senior Corus management before making a firm offer at that price. 

 It is also in talks with Corus pension trustees to try and match Tatas proposal to inject 126 million into the pension plan and increase pension contributions.

 CSN has said its proposal would also create a top-five steelmaker with an initial annual production capacity of 24 million tonnes (mt). 

 Output would surge to about 50 million tonnes a year due to expansion projects already underway in Brazil.

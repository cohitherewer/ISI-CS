 A STAFF REPORTER

 Jajodia: In search of black gold

 Calcutta, May 15: A strategic investor from the US has entered the oil exploration foray with one third working interest of the prospect Australian block as part of Austin Exploration Limited, which was formed following a strategic alliance between Assam Company Limited and DMS Exploration from Austin.

 This strategic US based investor would also shell out two thirds of the cost of initial exploration at the Yorketown prospect in Australia which amounts to $3.2 million while the rest would be borne by Austin Explorations.

 ?Assam Company through its holding concern the Duncan MacNeill Group holds 16.67 per cent of working interest in the Yorketown prospect which has a potential independently estimated at one billion barrels with an estimated recoverable potential of 788 million barrels of oil and 315 billion cubic feet of gas. It is the largest out of the four blocks co-owned by Austin Explorations,? A.K. Jajodia, managing director, Assam Company Limited, said.

 The other Australian block is located in the Cooper basin of south Australia called Tirrawarra prospect and has an estimated recoverable potential of 5 million barrels of oil and 25 billion cubic feet of gas. Austin Exploration has one third of the working interest of this prospect.

 The remaining two prospects are located in the US: St Gabriel in Iberville, Louisana has a potential of 5 million barrels of oil and 36 billion cubic feet of gas and Polecat Creek Prospect in Texas with recoverable potential of 180,000 barrels of oil and 180,000 million cubic feet of gas.

 By 2006, Jajodia said Austin expects to drill at least one well in each of its four blocks in the US and Australia. Austin plans to freeze on the bigger work programme by June.

 Duncan MacNeill Group, comprising Assam Company, the Mauritius based holding company Cromwell Securities and other group companies, have acquired 50 per cent shareholding in Austin Explorations Limited. The rest is with David M Schuette of Texas and his associates ? the DMS Exploration.

 Assam Company through its UK based holding company Duncan Macneill Group has paid $1.5 million to DMS Exploration as a package fee for being a joint venture partner in all their exploration projects initially for the US, Australia and India. The fee also covers exclusive rights to use their aerial micro magnetic technology in India and the Saarc countries. 

 This technology would be the first in India to be deployed through an unmanned aircraft to scan and analyse magnetic fields.

 Assam Company has commissioned a 3D study spread over 70 sq km to be completed by the end of August for Amguri oilfield and a 2D study for AN07 to be done by the end of next month. While a group gathering station (GGS) is being constructed within the next few months.

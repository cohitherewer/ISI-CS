 Kotak Securities beats Anil outfit Flat out

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Broke-rage

 Mumbai, Aug 7: Kotak Securities today appeared to have upstaged Anil Ambanis brokerage outfit R-Trade by becoming the first in the country to introduce a fixed fee-based per trade brokerage charge.

 The leading brokerage has introduced Kotak Flat, which will offer a flat fee of Rs 9 per trade.

 Kotak appears to have stolen some of Ambanis thunder. R-Trade was planning to introduce the discount brokerage concept in the country.

 For the first time in the country, we have introduced a fixed fee-based brokerage model for retail investors. Anybody can trade in shares through us by paying a flat fee of Rs 9 as brokerage charges, said Narayan SA, managing director of Kotak Securities. 

 This will simplify the brokerage structure and add substantial value to a consumer, he added.

 Kotak Flat is available to customers across the country and is available only on the Kotak Securities online trading platform. The brokerage firm also have service offices in 249 cities and a central customer service desk based in Mumbai. 

 The product, targeted towards retail investors, has various slabs and customers trading in a particular slab will pay a fixed fee as brokerage charges. 

 Internationally, fixed fee per trading transaction is a norm and we feel that our move will set the trend for the Indian brokerage market, said D. Kannan, chief operating officer of Kotak Securities. 

 We have introduced the product in the Indian market based on consumer feedback and the need for an easy-to-understand product, added Kannan. 

 The online trading platform makes investments simple for customers and gives the option to buy all initial public offers and mutual funds free of cost.

 Based on last six months data, the brokerage house had a market share of over 8.5 per cent with over 2.45 lakh customers and had a portfolio management service (PMS) asset base of over Rs 2,600 crore on March 31. 

 The brokerage industry has been rife with speculation over the entry of R-Trade. 

 R-Trade, which expected to open its doors for business within a month, plans to kickstart a discount brokerage model in India. 

 There are serious apprehensions in the market over R-Trades expected aggressive pricing strategies and with its scale of operations and deep pockets, it may slash the fees indiscriminately. It will make the going tough for numerous small brokers, said a leading broker. 

 The model, when pioneered by Charles Schwab in the US on May 1, 1975, had precipitated a shakeout on the Wall Street.

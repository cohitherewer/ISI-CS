 Port slaps illegal notice on pipeline

 SAMBIT SAHA

 In troubled waters

 Calcutta, May 14: Thundering back at Indian Oil Corporation over its remonstrations on wharfage charges, the Calcutta Port Trust has claimed that the oil major?s pipeline below the Hooghly was an unauthorised structure.

 The port said IOC did not take formal permission to lay the pipeline, and, in the absence of an approval, the construction was an unauthorised one. The pipeline connecting IOC?s Budge Budge terminal with Sankrail was commissioned in 1999.

 The CPT had demanded Rs 17 crore from IOC as wharfage charge for allowing the pipeline under the Hooghly, citing provisions of the Major Port Trust Act. 

 Indian Oil has refused to pay the sum.

 The two PSUs have been bickering over the last six years on this issue. To break the deadlock, a high level meeting has been called in Delhi on May 17.

 The petroleum and shipping secretaries, along with the chiefs of CPT and IOC, will attend the meeting.

 This is the seventh attempt by the two entities in the last one-and-a-half months to resolve the issue. The previous six meetings did not materialise due to various reasons.

 When contacted, Calcutta Port chairman A.K. Chanda declined to comment, citing an urgent meeting.

 The CPT granted an in-principle permission to IOC to build the pipeline in 1995. The oil major had undertaken the construction on this basis.

 IOC, which has a refinery in Haldia, despatches the products to its Budge Budge terminal in vessels over the Hooghly. After the pipeline was built, despatch through vessels went down, causing a loss of revenue to CPT.

 By 2005-06, IOC has sent 3 million tonnes of petroleum products through the pipeline, leading to substantial savings for the oil major. In a feasibility report, the oil PSU said by investing Rs 40 crore on the pipeline, it stands to gain Rs 319 crore over a period of 15 years.

 CPT said IOC was liable to payments both under Indian Ports Act and Major Port Trust Act. 

 The Act gives CPT the authority to permit construction activities and charge fees and impose other conditions.

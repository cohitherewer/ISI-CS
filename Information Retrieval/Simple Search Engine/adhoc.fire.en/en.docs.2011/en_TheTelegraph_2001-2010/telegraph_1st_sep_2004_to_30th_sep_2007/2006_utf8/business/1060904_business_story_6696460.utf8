 US murkies WTO waters

 S.P.S. PANNU 

 New Delhi, Sept. 3: India plans to get into a huddle with Brazil and South Africa to thwart the latest US attempts to split the developing nations on the WTO negotiations.

 The commerce ministry is miffed by US trade representative Susan Schwab telling China to cut its reliance on India and Brazil in advocating its interests at the forthcoming G-6 meetings.

 Commerce ministry officials see this as a move to split the developing countries so that the US can have its way at the WTO. Both India and China have to protect their farmers from the onslaught of cheap western exports. The two countries together present a formidable front, which the US would like to weaken.

 India, Brazil and South Africa represent the interests of the developing countries at the G-6 meetings, in which the US and the European Union (EU) also participate to discuss WTO issues. The US is feeling cornered by the united stand of the developing countries. 

 Indian officials have found Schwab far less conciliatory in her approach than her predecessor, Rob Portman.

 The collapse of the latest round of talks, where Schwab replaced Portman, completely isolated the US at Geneva.

 Even Peter Mandelson of the EU held the US responsible for the breakdown of the Geneva talks.

 Schwab, during her visit to Beijing last week, is believed to have said she was surprised that China was letting India and Brazil represent its position at the crucial G-6 meetings.

 India and Brazil have been emphasising that the Doha round of talks is about development issues and not market access as the US and the EU are seeking. 

 While earlier attempts by the US to split the developing countries by enticing the poor African countries away has failed, it is now trying to play the China card. 

 This is the second salvo that Schwab has fired at India and Brazil. Last month, she announced that the US has decided to review the duty-free benefit that it extends to a range of goods imported under the generalised system of preferences (GSP).

 RBI move to curb risky real estate loans

 Mumbai, March 2: Alarmed at the surge in loans to the real estate sector, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has asked banks to curb ?excessively risky lending? by being selective and strengthening the loan approval process.

 While vetting real estate proposals, the RBI has asked banks to ensure that the borrowers have prior permission for the project from government/local governments or other authorities.

 To avoid hampering the loan approval process, banks can sanction the proposals in normal course, but ?the disbursements should be made only after the borrower has obtained requisite clearances from the government authorities?, the RBI said in a notification to chief executives of all commercial banks on Wednesday.

 The RBI move comes only days after the Economic Survey revealed that banks? lending to sensitive sectors such as real estate has been rising over the past few years. The survey said real estate witnessed the maximum rise of 90 per cent in loan disbursals among all the sectors till October last year. 

 In October 2005, banks lent Rs 20,148 crore to builders and private developers compared with over Rs 8,200 crore in fiscal 2004.

 As on March 31, 2005, RBI figures show that close to 63 per cent of commercial bank lending to sensitive sectors was accounted for by real estate at Rs 24,690 crore.

 The central bank is worried at the pace in which the loan amounts are growing over the past year. Last July, the RBI raised the risk weightage on all outstanding real estate exposures of banks to 125 per cent from 100 per cent. The increase was on all exposures secured by mortgages on commercial real estate and investments in mortgage-backed securities and other instruments.

 In the past, the Reserve Bank has asked banks to have a sound risk management system in place to contain risks involved in this sector.

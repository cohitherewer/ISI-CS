 States want cover for revenue loss

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 17: The states today asked the Centre to formulate a comprehensive compensation package for the estimated Rs 9,000-crore revenue loss on account of the proposed cut in central sales tax from 4 per cent to 2 per cent next fiscal.

 Since the empowered committee has decided that CST will be reduced from 4 per cent to 2 per cent from April this year, there is a pre-condition that the Centre should provide full compensation. We discussed ways of how the loss of states could be compensated, chairman of the empowered committee and West Bengal finance minister Asim Dasgupta said after a meeting with finance minister P. Chidambaram.

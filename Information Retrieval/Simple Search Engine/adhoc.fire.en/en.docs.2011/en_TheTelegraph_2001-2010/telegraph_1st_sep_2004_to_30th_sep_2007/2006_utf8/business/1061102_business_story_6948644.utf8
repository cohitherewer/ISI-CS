 Gas-hungry RIL begins cash drill

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Nov. 1: Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) is pumping more money into its exploration efforts at the Krishna-Godavari (KG-D6) block as it intends to double production to 80 million metric standard cubic metre per day (mmscmd). 

 As RIL will incur a capital expenditure of $5.2 billion due to this enhanced production, it is planning to raise funds of up to $2 billion from international markets. 

 Target $2 billion

 In a notice issued to stock exchanges today, the company said its board of directors would meet on November 9 to consider and approve raising of $2 billion by way of syndicated loan/bonds/ foreign currency convertible bonds towards investment in projects of oil and gas exploration and production business. 

 This came on a day when the company filed an amendment to the initial development plan for the Deepwater Block KG-DWN-98/3 (KG-D6), with the directorate general of hydrocarbons for approval. The block was awarded under NELP-1 bidding round and RIL, as operator of the block, holds 90 per cent of the participating interest and Niko Resources Ltd, Canada, holds the remaining 10 per cent.

 Original plan

 Based on the initial reserves estimates of the block, RIL had prepared an initial plan to develop two discoveries Dhirubhai-1 and Dhirubhai-3 in the block. The original plan envisaged a production plateau of 40 mmscmd. The plan was submitted to the DGH in May 2004 and was approved in November 2004.

 According to RIL, subsequent to the approval of the initial plan, exploratory work has been done in the block to assess the overall hydrocarbon potential and the recoverable reserves in these fields. This included acquisition of additional 3D seismic data, drilling of additional exploratory wells resulting in 13 discoveries and extensive boring of two development wells. 

 RIL also obtained independent assessment for the Dhirubhai-1 and Dhirubhai-3 gas discoveries at 11.3 TCF, which is almost double of the earlier estimates.

 Raising the bar

 However, in view of the large projected deficit of gas demand in the country, coupled with the significantly higher hydrocarbon potential, it sought an approval to increase the production rate from 40 mmscmd to 80 mmscmd and enhanced facilities for production, collection, evacuation and handling of gas, both onshore and offshore.

 The project is on schedule for first gas by the second half of 2008-09 despite the increase in production rate. This is the first deepwater gas development project in India and on commissioning, would be among the largest and most complex deepwater gas production system in the world. This project will be completed in about six years from the first discovery, making it among the fastest deepwater gas developments in the world, the statement issued by RIL added.

 More energy

 According to the petrochemicals firm, gas production from KG-D6 fortifies its commitment to provide India greater energy security in view of the existing energy deficit. 

 The increased production would double the current indigenous gas availability in the country and the production rate of 80 mmscmd is equivalent to 450,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which is about 25 per cent of the current oil import in the country. It is also expected to improve the balance of payment situation that is worsening on account of oil imports.

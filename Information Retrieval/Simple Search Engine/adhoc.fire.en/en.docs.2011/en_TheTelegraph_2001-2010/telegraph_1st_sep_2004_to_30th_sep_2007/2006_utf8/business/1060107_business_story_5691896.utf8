 Fab Four to give auto expo a miss

 GARIMA SINGH

 Show stoppers

 New Delhi, Jan. 6: Top automakers like Hyundai, DaimlerChrysler, General Motors and Toyota are skipping the Auto Expo this year either because they have no new models to showcase or they don?t want to be lost in the crowd.

 However, players like Ford India, Honda Siel and Mahindra amp; Mahindra are raring to return to the fair. They feel the expo is the best venue to interact with car enthusiasts. These manufacturers believe it is the right place to introduce new technology and get meaningful feedback. 

 But DaimlerChrysler, which makes and markets cars for the well-heeled, feels it would benefit more by organising roadshows in three cities for its latest models.

 Roadshows would be cheaper and also reach the target customer more effectively, the company said. 

 DaimlerChrysler India feels it makes more sense to host direct customer contact programmes rather than participate in the auto expo.

 The carmaker is undertaking a major cost reduction exercise and feels that brand shows are more effective than auto fairs. It is now in the process of finalising its model line-up for the brand show to be held in Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai in 2006.

 General Motors India is also planning a slew of launches after the auto expo gets over this month. 

 ?We are busy with the launch of three cars. We were not present even in the last show and we never planned to participate this year too,? said P. Balendran, vice-president, corporate affairs, GM India. 

 Meanwhile, Hyundai Motors has started roadshows with special packages in 34 cities.

 The Korean automobile firm is showcasing its luxury sedan Azera and sports coupe Tuscani in these roadshows.

 A senior Hyundai Motor official said, ?We would rather organise our own roadshows and gain mileage than be lost in a crowd.?

 Officials from Toyota Kirloskar Motor Limited said they saw no reason to participate in the forthcoming auto show since there are no new models to showcase.

 However, Ford India, which skipped the last expo, promises to showcase one of the company?s most sought- after sedan at the show.

 V. Sivaramakrishnan, vice- president (sales and marketing) of Ford India, said, ?There are two principle reasons to participate. It is an opportunity to showcase new products and technology and spread awareness about our brand. Second, it helps us connect with our customers in the biggest market.?

 Ford India will showcase a red Mustang ? the sports sedan is running a waiting list of six to eight months in the US, and the re-designed Fiesta.

 Honda Siel Cars India Limited, which is returning to the expo after 1998, expects the expo to do wonders. 

 Rajive Saharia, general manager-marketing of HSCIL, said, ?Over the last few years, market dynamics in India has changed completely. It is relevant to be present in a market which is expected to double in the next five years.?

 HSCIL will showcase Insight, Honda?s Formula One car at the show.

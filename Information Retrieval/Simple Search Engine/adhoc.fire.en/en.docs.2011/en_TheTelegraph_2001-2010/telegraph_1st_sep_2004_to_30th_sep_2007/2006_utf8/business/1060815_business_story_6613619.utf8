 Michael Page profit up 30%

 London, Aug. 14 (Reuters): Recruitment firm Michael Page International reported a 30 per cent rise in first-half gross profit on Monday and gave an upbeat 2006 outlook, but its shares fell on poor results in Australia. 

 The outlook remains positive and we remain confident of sustained progress into the second half of the year, the company, which focuses on speciality recruitment services such as finance, accounting and engineering, said in a statement. 

 Michael Page said gross profit, or turnover minus cost of sales, rose to 166.6 million in the six months to end-June, helped by strong performances in Europe and the Americas. 

 Pretax profit rose 48 per cent to 45.2 million on a revenue of 312 million, up 24.6 per cent. 

 But shares in the company, which outperformed the UK support services sector by 19 per cent over the past six months, dropped 6 per cent to a four-week low of 307-3/4 pence by 10:40 am, valuing the group at around 1 billion. 

 Disappointing numbers from Australia and the lack of a clear guide to the second half was likely to weaken the shares, Bridgewell Securities said in a note. 

 We still believe that the market for professional service staff globally is robust, Bridgewell Securities added. 

 Chief Executive Steve Ingham said the company was comfortable with meeting a market mean forecast of 93 million in annual pretax profit on a revenue of 639 million, as it sees steady growth from the Americas and Europe. 

 It said sharp growth from permanent placements lifted its proportion of gross profit against temporary placements to 75 per cent from 73 per cent a year ago.

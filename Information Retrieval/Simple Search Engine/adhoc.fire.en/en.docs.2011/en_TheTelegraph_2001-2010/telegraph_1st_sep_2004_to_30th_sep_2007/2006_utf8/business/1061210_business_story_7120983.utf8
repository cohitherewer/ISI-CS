 Relief for loan-saddled states

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Dec. 9: The National Development Council (NDC) today worked out a Rs 6000-crore relief for states reeling under the burden of high-cost loans.

 The relief was recommended by an NDC-appointed sub-committee and would be provided from the national small savings fund (NSSF).

 The sub-committee, chaired by finance minister P. Chidambaram, has recommended that interest rates on loans taken by state governments from NSSF from 1999-2000 to 2002-03 be lowered to 10.5 per cent from 13.5 per cent at present. The reduced rate would come into effect from the next financial year.

 The sub-committee has also recommended that the interest rate on current NSSF loans should continue at 9.5 per cent.

 The interest on NSSF loans has come down from 13.5 per cent in 1999-2000 to 9.5 per cent in 2003-04.

 State governments mobilise small savings from the people and the collections go to NSSF created in 1999. The Centre acts as a trustee of the fund.

 All collections to the fund are currently transferred to the states, which have been complaining that they have accumulated high-cost debts.

 State governments have been demanding that all collections in NSSF should not be transferred to states and interest rate on past and current high cost NSSF loans be reduced.

 The committee further recommended that small savings collections should be shared between states and the Centre in the ratio of 80:20 from the next financial year with the option for the states to take up to 100 per cent of the collections. The revised sharing pattern will be effective from April 1, 2007. 

 According to the committee, requests of state governments for additional open market borrowing to enable them to repay non-NSSF loans will be considered on a case-to-case basis. 

 Requests of state governments for prepayment of NSSF loans contracted up to 2002-03 will also be considered on a case-to-case basis within the approved borrowing ceilings.

 Apart from the finance minister, Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia and representatives from the RBI and finance ministry as well as finance ministers of some states are members of the sub-committee.

 New Delhi, Jan. 12: Japans Honda Motors is willing to divest its stake in its joint venture Honda Siel Cars India Limited.

 We are in talks with the Siel group for a positive collaboration, Honda Siel president and CEO M. Takedagawa said at the auto expo, which began in the capital today.

 At present, Honda has a 99 per cent stake in the joint venture, while Sidharth Shriram-promoted Siel Limited owns 1 per cent. 

 Earlier, Siel Limited had a 5 per cent stake in Honda Siel.

 Meanwhile, the carmaker showcased the Honda Civic and other two high-tech cars ? the hybrid vehicle, Insight, and the fuel-cell powered FCX ? at the expo.

 The company claims to be the first to display these technologies in the Indian car market.

 The Civic, which will be launched later this year will bridge the gap between Hondas two existing models ? the City and the Accord.

 The Civic will be positioned between the C and D segments.

 We are assessing our vendor base, manufacturing capacity and seasonality of demand. We will launch the Civic after all the details are worked out, Honda Siel general manager-marketing Rajive Saharia said.

 Honda officials said the Civic, which has already been launched in the UK and Japan, will be competitively priced in the Indian market. Initially, the company plans to produce about 10,000 units annually.

 The company also showcased the Formula one racer at the expo.

 According to Honda Siel officials, the carmaker is also looking at entering the small car segment, which dominates nearly 80 per cent of passenger car sales in India.

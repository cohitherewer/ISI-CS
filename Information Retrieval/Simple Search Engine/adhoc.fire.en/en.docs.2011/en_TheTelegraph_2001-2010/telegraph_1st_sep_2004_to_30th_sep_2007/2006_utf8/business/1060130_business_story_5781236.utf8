 Sweetened offer for Myanmar gas

 S.P.S. PANNU 

 Well OILed

 New Delhi, Jan. 29: India has informed Myanmar that it is ready to buy natural gas from the offshore Shwe fields on a take or pay basis in a bid to offer a better deal than the Chinese.

 A senior petroleum ministry official told The Telegraph that although Myanmar has signed a memorandum of understanding with China, there was no agreement as yet on the quantity of the gas that would be supplied or the commercial terms of the deal.

 However, he admitted that with China entering the picture, Myanmar has strengthened its bargaining power vis-?-vis India. 

 The take-or-pay clause that India is willing to include in the deal will give Myanmar guaranteed earnings for the gas every year, even if India is not able to pick up the gas due to some reason.

 The percentage of gas to which the take-or-pay clause will be applicable is expected to be worked out during further talks with Myanmar. 

 Although Myanmar had informed the Indian delegation in August that they would forward a draft heads of agreement covering the terms and conditions pertaining to the proposed gas supplies to India through the pipeline by October, it has still not come. Instead, Myanmar has signed an MoU with China for the sale of natural gas. 

 Myanmar seems to be keen on getting a better price for the gas through increased competition among buyers rather than shutting India out of the deal. 

 As the gas fields are situated south of Myanmar, they are more or less the same distance from India or China. As a result, China does not have an edge over India to offer a better price due to a lower transport cost, the official said.

 The shortest pipeline route from Myanmar to Bengal through Bangladesh is 290 km and it will cost $1 billion.

 However, since Bangladesh has been posing problems, an alternative land route from Myanmar to India through the North-east states has also been chalked out.

 Myanmar has favoured this 600-odd km route, as it will not have to deal with an unpredictable Bangladesh.

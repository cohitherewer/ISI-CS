 Legal hitch in Delhi land sale

 URVASHI KAUL

 New Delhi, May 4: Indiabulls and DLFs prized realty catch in the capital has got entangled in a legal logjam with Delhi High Court issuing a notice on the validity of the change in land use.

 The respondents are the urban development ministry, the Delhi government, the Municipal Corporation of Delhi and the Delhi Development Authority (DDA). They have been asked to file a reply by May 18, which is the next date of hearing on the case. 

 With the issue moving to court, the future of DDAs first project within the public-private partnership framework now hangs in balance.

 The DLF-Indiabulls combine has acquired the 35.8-acre plot for Rs 450 crore. It plans to build a complex of 750 premium apartments along with 3,500 resettlement homes for the poor.

 Challenging the sale of land at Tehkhand village, the petitioners said the respondents did not heed their numerous representations on the change in the master plan as they went ahead with the auction on April 26. The winning bid was made by Kenneth Builders and Developers, a 50:50 venture between Indiabulls Infrastructure and DLF Universal. Indiabulls had informed the BSE after emerging the highest bidder with DLF. 

 For DLF, which is set to go public, legal obstacles appear to have slowed down its break-neck expansion plans.

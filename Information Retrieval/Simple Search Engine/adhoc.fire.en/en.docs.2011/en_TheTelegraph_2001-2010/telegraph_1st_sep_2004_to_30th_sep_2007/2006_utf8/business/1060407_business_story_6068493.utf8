 India Cements plans price hike

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, April 6: India Cements, one of the largest producers of cement in South India, is planning to raise prices once again.

 Industry sources say the company is looking at raising prices up to Rs 20 per bag in the next month. The hike may not be all at one go but in tranches. 

 N. Srinivasan, MD of India Cements, told The Telegraph, quot;I will not comment specifically on this issue, but its true that prices are hardening and can go up further. quot; 

 The idea behind the price hike, industry sources say, is the fact that the cement prices per bag down South is far lower than that in Mumbai where prices are hovering around Rs 235 per bag.

 With the southern states expecting a construction boom and most cement producers having huge capacities, the hike in prices seems to be imminent. 

 Cement prices have moved up in all markets in the last three months. Large scale construction work and real estate development have fuelled huge demand for cement. The cement industry has also shown a double digit growth in the last three months. Mid-cap cement companies stocks have been doing very well in the market. ACC, one of the bigger players, has already raised prices by close to Rs 7 per bag recently. 

 When the stock markets closed yesterday, cement stocks were the top gainers. The India Cement stock rose to Rs 182.05, up 6.84 per cent, Birla Corp ended at Rs 368.95, up 6.31 per cent, ACC shares rose to Rs 838.15, up 5.35 per cent, and Gujarat Ambuja closed at Rs 106.90, almost an 1.86 per cent gain from previous day.

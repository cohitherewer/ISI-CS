 Mittal Steel profit rises 50%

 Mittal: Fortunes galore

 Aug. 2 (Reuters): Mittal Steel, the worlds biggest steelmaker, which is buying its closest rival, Arcelor, said on Wednesday its second-quarter operating profit rose nearly 50 per cent from the previous period.

 Operating profit rose to $1.52 billion on sales of $9.23 billion, Mittal Steel said in a statement.

 Second quarter net profit rose 34.7 per cent from the previous period to $1 billion.

 On July 26, Mittal Steel said it had secured 92 per cent of shares in Arcelor, as it moves towards completing its 26-billion-euro takeover.

 Mittal also said at the time it would reopen its offer for Arcelor until August 17 to give shareholders who have not yet tendered their shares another chance to accept the bid.

 Arcelor Brasil

 Brazils securities regulator CVM said today Mittal Steel must offer to buy the stake of minority shareholders in Arcelor Brasil, a unit of Arcelor. The regulator said Mittal Steel had the legal obligation to hold a public offer for the minority shareholders of Arcelor Brasil. The CVM said the decision could be appealed.

 Arcelor Brasil shares rose nearly 4 per cent on the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange after the Wall Street Journal reported that such a ruling by the CVM could increase the cost of Mittal Steels planned purchase of Arcelor by as much as $6.38 billion.

 Mittal last week published a statement saying its planned acquisition of Arcelor did not require it to make an offer for shares of its Brazilian units. Arcelor Brasil declined to comment. The company was to announce second-quarter results and hold a press conference on Wednesday.

 US approval

 US antitrust authorities has approved Mittal Steels planned purchase of Arcelor after requiring Mittal to sell some North American assets. The justice department said it would not oppose the deal provided Mittal divests one of its three North American tin mills.

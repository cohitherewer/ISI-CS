investment mistakes

 New Delhi, March 26: The Comptroller and Auditor-General (CAG) of India has put the Calcutta Port Trust (CPT) in the dock for investing its provident funds in the US-64 scheme. CAG said CPT violated government directives and suffered a capital loss of Rs 8.07 crore.

 In its latest report, CAG said the government has barred the investment of provident funds by public sector undertakings and port trusts in equity-based mutual funds.

 The report said CPT invested Rs 22.25 crore in the US-64 scheme till July 2000.

 In July 1998, UTI announced that the reserves of the scheme had turned negative by Rs 1,098 crore. This was followed by a redemption of US-64 units worth Rs 1,500 crore in the first six months of the fiscal ended June 1999. However, CPT retained its investment in the scheme. In July 2000, the dividend declared was 13.75 per cent, which fell to 10 per cent in July 2001. UTI also suspended the sale and purchase of its US-64 units and no dividend was declared subsequently.

 According to the report, CPT invested its provident fund in other deposits and bonds and earned an interest rate of 13 per cent and 14 per cent respectively. 

 However, CPT did not consider redeploying its balance in the UTI scheme in such deposits despite the declining trend of the return and erosion of its reserves. This switch in portfolio could have averted the loss. In March 2003, the UTI had intimated CPT that it had decided to terminate the scheme from June 2003. Consequently, CPT redeemed all the units in May 2003 for Rs 14.18 crore.

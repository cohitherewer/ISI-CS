 Fresh Sahara petition

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, July 4: Sahara group chief Subroto Roy today moved a Lucknow district court pleading for a stay on refund of Rs 500 crore to Jet and freeze on the Rs 1,500-crore escrow account. 

 Roys petition is being seen as a move to stop Jet Airways from shifting the hearing of the cases related to the Jet-Sahara deal to Mumbai.

 Jet Airways had approached Bombay High Court recently for a refund of the Rs-500-crore advance. It had moved the Supreme Court seeking a transfer of all related litigation from Lucknow to Bombay High Court.

 Air Sahara, ICICI Bank ? the escrow agent ? and Jet Airways have been made respondents in todays petition.

 The fresh petition was made by Sahara India Limited with Subroto Roy, the group chairman, J.B. Roy and Vandana Bhargava, the company secretary, as other plaintiffs. The earlier petition had been filed by Sahara India Commercial Corporation Limited (SICCL) with .P. Srivastava as the other plaintiff.

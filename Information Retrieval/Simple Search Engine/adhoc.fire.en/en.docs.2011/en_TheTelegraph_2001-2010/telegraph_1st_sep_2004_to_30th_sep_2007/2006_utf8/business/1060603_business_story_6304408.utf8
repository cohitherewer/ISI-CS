 Rebates eat into Mangalore net profit

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, June 2: Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd today reported a 58 per cent drop in earnings at Rs 371.6 crore for the fiscal ended March 31, 2006.

 The ONGC downstream subsidiary had clocked an impressive net profit of Rs 880 crore in 2004-05. 

 Accordingly, the dividend was slashed to 7 per cent from 10 per cent the company had doled out in the previous year. The payout will absorb Rs 122.7 crore, excluding Rs 17.21 crore as tax on dividend. 

 The sharp decline in profit is attributed to discounts on petrol, diesel, kerosene and LPG that MRPL had to offer to Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum.

 There was also a reduction in refining margins in line with the global trend, as crude oil prices skyrocketed and petroleum product prices did not rise in the same proportion.

 National oil firms bought 10 per cent less products last year, which also led to the decline in profit, as the company had to sell more in the cheaper overseas market. Product offtake in the domestic market yields higher margins.

 However, MRPLs capacity utilisation was more than 125 per cent during the year. The refinery processed its highest-ever crude throughput at 12.12 million tonnes, up 3.98 per cent against 11.85 million tonnes last year.

 Turnover was up 36.49 per cent at Rs 28,243 crore against Rs 20,693 crore in the previous fiscal. Exports, at Rs 11,917 crore, registered a 94.48 per cent jump compared with Rs 6,191 crore in 2004-05. 

 The company has been able to reduce the debt-equity ratio to 0.82:1 during the year.

 The board has approved the refinery upgradation project, which will enhance its refining capacity to 15 million tonnes per annum from the current 9.69 million tonnes per annum.

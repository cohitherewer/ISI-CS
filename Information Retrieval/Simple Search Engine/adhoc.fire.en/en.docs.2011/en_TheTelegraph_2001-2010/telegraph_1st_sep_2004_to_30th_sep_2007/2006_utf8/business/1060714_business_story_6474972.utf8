 Calcutta, July 13: LG Electronics India will launch its portable media players during the forthcoming festival season. 

 ?By September-October, we will introduce our portable media player,? said Rishi Tandon, product group head (digital audio/video division), LG Electronics India. 

 The Korean company today launched a clutch of digital home audio/video systems, which are compatible with both DivX and MPEG4 technology. DivX is a video compression technology similar to MPEG 4, but unlike the latter, it is not an open platform. DivX Inc of the US is the patent holder of the technology and hence the name DivX. Using either technology, one can compress four to six movies in a standard compact disc that would otherwise contain only one movie.

 Other players like Sony and Philips also have DivX DVDs and audio systems. However, they have not promoted these as DivX Inc didn?t introduce its technology in India. 

 ?However, the US company is now talking to a number of leading production houses in Bollywood for encoding their movies in its video compression technology. We expect DivX will come to India soon,? said Tandon. UTV in India has got the DivX mandate for negotiating deals on its behalf with movie production houses here.

 One can download DivX-encoded Hollywood movies from the Internet onto personal computers or on a compact disc by paying a fee for using the DivX converter. But one cannot play a DivX CD on any DVD player, for which a DivX DVD player is needed. 

 LGEIL is offering one DivX disc containing six movies with its new range of DivX/MPEG4 DVD players, which cost between Rs 3,490 and Rs 4,490.

 Naphtha sales take a hit

 S.P.S. PANNU 

 Natural choice

 New Delhi, June 14: Higher import of liquefied natural gas by GAIL and Petronet is having a negative impact on naphtha sales of public sector oil firms.

 According to petroleum ministry sources, naphtha sales dropped by more than 5 per cent to 8,54,000 million tonnes in May from 9,00,000 million tonnes a year ago. 

 Natural gas works out to be much cheaper than naphtha for power plants that use it as a fuel and fertiliser units that require it as a feedstock.

 To get rid of the surplus stock, oil companies will now have to export more, although international prices of naphtha are lower than in the domestic market.

 Higher export of naphtha will entitle firms to import a small portion of crude oil duty free, a senior official with an oil company told The Telegraph.

 In the long run, oil companies are planning to set up petrochemical units, which will use naphtha as an input. This will also enable them to move up the value chain.

 At present, Reliance has a near-monopoly in the petrochemicals market after taking over state-owned IPCL.

 Indian Oil is setting up a petrochemicals plant at its Panipat refinery and also chalking out big plans for the east. However, the units at Paradip and Haldia will take time to come up. 

 Petronet imports 5 million tonnes of LNG per annum from Qatar under a 25-year deal at a f.o.b. price of $2.53 per million British thermal unit (Btu). It has also stepped into the spot market to increase imports. 

 Petronet has contracted a 62,000-tonne cargo from Egypt at an ex-ship price of $7.60 per million Btu. 

 This is reportedly cheaper than current rates.

 The cargo will be shipped from the Idku terminal of Egyptian LNG owned by UK?s BG Group and Malaysia?s Petronas.

 Last month, GAIL imported 135,000 cubic meters of LNG from Algeria at an ex-shipment price of $9.28 per million Btu. 

 The gas was sold to NTPC, Delhi Vidyut Board, Birla Copper among others. 

 In April, Shell imported 135,000 tonnes of LNG from Oman at its Hazira terminal. The company is believed to have paid a CIF price of $8 per million Btu. 

 The regassified-LNG was sold to Essar and Gujarat State Petroleum.

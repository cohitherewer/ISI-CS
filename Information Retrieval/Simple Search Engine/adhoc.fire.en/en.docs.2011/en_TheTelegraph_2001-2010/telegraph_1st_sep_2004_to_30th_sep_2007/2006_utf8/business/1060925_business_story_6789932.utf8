 Many a slip in capital cover MF

 CHANDRALEKHA TULAL

 Money power

 Mumbai, Sept. 24: Several mutual funds are preparing to launch capital protection schemes but investors are warned of a semantic tripwire that lurks in the fine print.

 Franklin Templeton and Reliance Mutual have submitted their draft offer documents for their capital protection schemes to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi).

 The starting point

 Back in August, the capital market regulator had issued guidelines that permitted mutual funds to offer schemes that were oriented towards protection of capital but they couldnt promise guaranteed returns.

 The phrase capital protection is pretty straight forward: the investor is basically assured that the money one invests wont go down the chute even if it doesnt earn one any returns should the market turn on its head.

 In simple terms, it means that no matter how tough the going gets, these funds will protect the sum that was initially invested.

 But just trawl through the documents that have been filed with Sebi and you realise that maybe you cant take this for granted either.

 Word play 

 While listing the general risk factors of these schemes, the documents say that since mutual funds and securities investments are subject to market risks, there is no assurance or guarantee that the objectives of the scheme will be achieved.

 This raises a question: are these mutual funds then selling a misnomer to a bunch of gullible investors?

 Doesnt that sound kind of familiar? It is rather like those fixed rate home loans that come loaded with a disclaimer that the rates might actually vary depending on market variations.

 Cut through the verbiage and 

 what does all this actually mean?

 Says Dhirendra Kumar, chief executive at Value Research, the independent agency that tracks the mutual fund industry: Sebi has carefully tip-toed around the word guarantee and without quite stepping into it.

 No safety net

 The Sebi guidelines drive home that these plans will endeavour to protect the capital invested in them by adopting a certain portfolio structure. In other words, these schemes will merely make a stab at protecting capital, but there is no guarantee that they will. Unlike other markets, there is no safety net in the form of guarantees or insurance covers.

 The guidelines say that these schemes will be rated by a credit rating agency that will examine whether the portfolio structure is good enough to ensure protection of the capital invested. Do note that we are only talking about an effort to protect capital; no one has said anything about the effort actually having to succeed, says Kumar.

 Kumar sounds a caveat for investors: in the past, several company deposit schemes had been assigned top credit ratings, but they bit the dust at the first hint of trouble.

 There have been numerous cases where a deposit scheme has been given a high rating in the beginning, but the rating was suddenly downgraded just before maturity. What happens to the investors then, asks Kumar. The rating agency will claim that it has fulfilled its duties and duly downgraded the securities or the schemes. But the investors will be stuck with a dud closed-end scheme with no exit option, adds Kumar.

 So, will these capital protection 

 schemes work?

 When a fund salesman comes to you to sell these schemes, he will orally refer to it as a guaranteed scheme. When you ask him why the document doesnt specifically say it is guaranteed, he will launch into spiel of how the government prevented them from using the word guarantee, while in reality they are just as good as being guaranteed. Most of us will then end up buying into these schemes, says Kumar.

 Kumar says while most of these funds wont actually lose money, they will not earn much either as the portfolios will be conservatively structured.

 Fresh mutual fund inflows to boost market mood

 The stock market is likely to get another booster shot as the Rs 9000 crore or so mopped up from the spate of new fund offers gets invested.

 This fiscal, domestic funds have been net sellers in the equity market only in June, December, January and in the current month so far.

 However, it?s very likely that they will turn net buyers soon. In fact, the main reason why MFs turned net sellers in the last couple of months was because money mopped up by new schemes had fallen. 

 Data compiled by the Association of Mutual Funds in India show that there were net redemptions from growth schemes in January, after a small inflow of Rs 557 crore in December. In contrast, net inflows into growth schemes amounted to Rs 9,472 crore during August to October, a period during which they pumped in a net Rs 8,333 crore into the stock market. New fund offerings took in Rs 8,478 crore in these three months. Simply put, sales from existing schemes and redemptions more or less balance each other out and its the dale of new fund offerings that makes the difference. 

 In contrast to the Rs 8,478 mopped up by new fund offerings in growth schemes from August to October, the period between November and January saw offerings of only Rs 3,327 crore, leading to MFs turning sellers to meet redemptions.

 With money flowing into MFs once again, that picture will change.

 Market valuation

 One of the bulls? favourite arguments is that valuations are not stretched even at these high levels, because the market is nowhere near the price-earnings ratios that it had reached during previous highs. What were these peaks? 

 In April 1992, at the height of the Harshad Mehta scam, the sensex PE was a stratospheric 52. Even after the scam, it remained above 30 through 1993, moving up to 51.9 in June 1994. By March 1995 it was at 30, declining thereafter to around 15 by December, before moving up again to 20 in June 1996 before falling off sharply. 

 The sensex PE went up again during the tech boom, moving up to 29 by June 2000 before falling. Then it moved up again as the current rally got under way, and it was as high as 19.3 in April 2004.

 Does this mean that at its current PE of 18.4 the sensex is still undervalued?

 First, we must leave aside the Harshad Mehta years and the tech boom as aberrations. We are then left with high valuations in 1993-96 and in 2004. 

 In 1993-94 and 94-95, according to CMIE data, manufacturing companies net profits grew 109 per cent and 100 per cent respectively. 

 In 2003-04 they grew 60 per cent. In 2004-05, however, that growth came down to 30 per cent and its likely to slow further this year. The point is that the high valuations in 1993-95 and in 2004 were justified by the huge growth in profits. Current valuations are not.

 Calcutta, Oct. 10: Assam Company Limited, which has a major presence in oil and gas and tea in eastern India, has prepared ambitious expansion plans for both the businesses.

 The company will invest $100 million (Rs 450 crore) in its oil and gas business over the next two and a half years and Rs 22 crore in packet tea.

 The company has bid for two oil blocks under the sixth round of the new exploration licencing policy in Assam with the Canada-based Canoro Resources. The bids are being assessed by the directorate general of hydrocarbons, the regulator for the oil and gas sector.

 Abhay Chawdhry, chief financial officer, Assam Company Limited said the company had raised $40 million of the $100 million through private placement and planned to mop up the remaining $50-60 million through foreign currency convertible bonds (FCCBs).

 He said the company had recently received a licence from the Nagaland government for prospecting in an exploration block which is spread over 319 square kilometre with Canoro as the partner. 

 Chawdhry said the company operates three wells in Amguri, Assam, which are referred as Well 5, Well 6 and Well 8A. Well 5 generates a daily revenue of Rs 2 lakh, while the earning from Well 6 is Rs 2.5 lakh a day, to be enhanced by drilling at two more spots as directional wells for Well 6 that have been detected by a 3D survey.

 He said the company also possessed three marginal fields at Laxmijan, Bihubar and Barsilla. Rig deployment would start at Laxmijan in February 2007, to be followed by operations at the other two fields, Chawdhry added.

 Tea business

 The company is all set to re-enter the packet tea business with an investment of Rs 22 crore.

 Mukundan Raman, vice-president, marketing, Assam Company said the company planned to launch the Jumbo brand at a price of Rs 130 per kg and the Cheetah for Rs 120.

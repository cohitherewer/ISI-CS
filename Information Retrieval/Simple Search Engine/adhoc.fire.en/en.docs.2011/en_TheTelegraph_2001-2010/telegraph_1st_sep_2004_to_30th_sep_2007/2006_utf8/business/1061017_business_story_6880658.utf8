 Govt offers oil bonds at 8.13%

 New Delhi, Oct. 16 (PTI) The government today issued the first tranche of bonds worth Rs 5,000 crore to oil marketing companies to help them offset losses due to high international crude prices. The bonds (GOI Special Bond, 2021) carry a coupon rate of 8.13 per cent and have a tenure of 15 years.

 Indian Oil Corporation, including IBP, have been issued bonds worth Rs 2,838 crore, BPCL Rs 1,135 crore and HPCL Rs 1,027 crore.

 The investment in the bonds will not be considered as an eligible investment by bank and insurance companies for their statutory requirements, but will be treated as eligible investment by a provident fund, gratuity fund and superannuation fund. 

 The government had in June decided to issue bonds worth Rs 28,300 crore to state-run oil marketing companies to compensate them for the losses incurred due to selling petrol products below the production cost.

 International crude prices, which had touched a high of $70 a barrel, have since come down to below $60-a-barrel levels. The average for the Indian basket of crude oil during October was around $58 a barrel and that of the July-September quarter was $67.71 a barrel.

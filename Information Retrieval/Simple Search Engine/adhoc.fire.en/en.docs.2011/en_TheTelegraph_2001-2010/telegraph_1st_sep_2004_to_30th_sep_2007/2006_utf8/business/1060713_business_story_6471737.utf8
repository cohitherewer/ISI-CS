 EU slaps $357m penalty on Microsoft 

 Troubled times

 Brussels, July 12 (Agencies): The European Union (EU) fined Microsoft Corp 280.5 million euros ($357 million) on Wednesday for failing to obey its 2004 antitrust order to share program code with rivals. 

 If the company fails to comply with the Commission ruling by July 31, it would face a maximum possible fine of 3 million euros per day. Microsoft said it would appeal against the fine, claiming the hefty amount was unfair.

 The EU said the new fines would take effect later this year unless the company supplies complete and accurate technical information to developers to help them make software that works smoothly with its ubiquitous Windows operating system.

 I regret that more than two years after the decision ... Microsoft has still not put an end to its illegal conduct, said EU competition commissioner Neelie Kroes. I have no alternative but to levy penalty payments for this continued compliance. No company is above the law.

 Microsoft general counsel Brad Smith said the company would ask the courts if the unprecedented fine was fair, claiming that the EU had never been clear about what it wanted.

 We do not believe this fine is justified, he said in a statement. We have great respect for the Commission and this process, but we do not believe any fine, let alone a fine of this magnitude, is appropriate given the lack of clarity in the Commissions original decision and our good-faith efforts over the last two years.

 The EU imposed daily fines of 1.5 million euros ($1.91 million), below a maximum of 2 million euros ($2.55 million)-a-day, from December 15 to June 20 when it decided Microsoft was still violating the EU law.

 In comparison, Microsoft earned 2.4 billion euros ($2.98 billion) in the quarter ended March 31 on revenues of 8.78 billion euros ($10.9 billion).

 The EU had already levied a record 497-million-euros ($613 million) fine on Microsoft in 2004 and ordered it to hand over communications code to rivals, saying it had deliberately tried to cripple them as it won control of the market.

 Kroes also said she had warned Microsoft that it had to take care to avoid antitrust problems with its new operating system Vista, which will include an Internet search and a PDF-type document reader that could pose problems for current rivals.

 Microsoft is aware of it, she said. Hopefully it will be in a shape ... that all those items are taken into account.

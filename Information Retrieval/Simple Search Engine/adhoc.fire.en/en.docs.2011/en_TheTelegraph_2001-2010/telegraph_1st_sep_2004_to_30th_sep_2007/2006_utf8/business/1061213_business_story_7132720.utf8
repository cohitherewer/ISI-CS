 New Delhi, Dec. 12: DaimlerChrysler is set to increase its component sourcing from India.

 DaimlerChrysler India said it would buy more components from the domestic market for its operations in other countries such as Japan, Germany and the US. DaimlerChrysler sources about 20 per cent of its total components from the Indian market.

 The company said it is relying on the domestic industrys high product quality and low price. Our sourcing from India has witnessed a compounded annual growth rate of 20 per cent over the years and it will significantly go up in the coming years, said Wilfried Aulbur, CEO and managing director of DCI.

 Of the total sourcing from the country at present, components account for 70 per cent with the rest being services, he said.

 Serving major markets through a group of Indian component manufacturers, DaimlerChrysler is looking at developing its vendor base in India.

 Component sourcing from India is already the largest in south and Southeast Asia and will grow higher than the current level of 20 per cent, he said.

 Aulbur said buoyant GDP growth rate is also expected to increase the market for high-end products in the country.

 India is expected to reach a 9 per cent GDP growth rate in the Eleventh Five-Year Plan, which will start next year.

 The growth provides us with opportunities for increased business in India and we have reacted to it by introducing our range of trucks here, Aulbur said. On plans to introduce buses in the country, he said the company has taken no decision on it yet. 

 The company expects its sales to grow at 15-20 per cent over the next few years.

 Meanwhile, refusing to reveal any investment plans for its second manufacturing facility in Pune, senior company officials said the plant would be operational by 2008.

 Sources said the new facility is likely to be three to four times bigger than the existing plant at Pimpri. This will also allow the company to expand operations in the country as DCI expects the market for high-end products to grow in near future.

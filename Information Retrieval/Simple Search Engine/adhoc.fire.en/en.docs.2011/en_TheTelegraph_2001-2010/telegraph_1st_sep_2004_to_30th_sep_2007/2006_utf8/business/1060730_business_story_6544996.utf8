 Grasim turns on cash tap

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, July 29: Grasim Industries has decided to invest in cement and viscose stable fibre (VSF) businesses. The company has earmarked an investment of Rs 4,550 crore over the next two years in these two areas for capacity expansion and modernisation. 

 It has set aside Rs 3,641 crore for cement alone. Of the total amount, about Rs 2,475 crore will be spent on augmenting the cement capacity by 8 million tonnes and setting up thermal power plants. This involves setting up a greenfield cement plant at Kotputli, Rajasthan, with a split grinding unit at Panipat in Haryana with a total capacity of 4 million tonnes. Moreover, the capacity at the Shambhupura plant in Rajasthan will be raised to 4 million tonnes.

 While this would enable Grasim to cater to the increasing demand in the northern region, the company is also investing Rs 1,166 crore over the next two years in modernising and de-bottlenecking captive power plants and setting up a grinding unit at Dadri. 

 Moreover, a Rs 2,700-crore capital expansion is planned at UltraTech of which Rs 1,275 crore will be spent on the capacity expansion of its Tadpatri plant by 4 million tonnes. 

 D.D. Rathi, whole-time director of Grasim Industries, said the company was putting in Rs 617 crore for capacity expansion and modernisation of the VSF business. 

 According to Rathi, Grasim is not only expanding its VSF capacity by 25 per cent over the next few months, but is also focussing on aspects like rayon grade wood pulp, which is a critical raw material. Grasim has a pulp plantation in Laos and there will soon be a pulp plant there. It has made an acquisition in Canada also. According to Rathi, these capital expansion plans will be financed through a mix of debt, internal accruals, cash and cash equivalents. 

 Though Grasim is in a position to mobilise debt at competitive rates, sources said it might go in for foreign currency debt.

 Rathi spoke to newspersons after the Grasim board met to consider its first quarterly numbers. On a consolidated basis, Grasim saw a 47 per cent rise in net profit at Rs 435.3 crore against Rs 296.1 crore in the corresponding period in the last year. 

 Net revenue shot up 29.2 per cent to Rs 3,195.9 crore from Rs 2,473.7 crore a year ago. On a stand-alone basis, net profit gained 24.3 per cent to Rs 311.9 crore from Rs 250.9 crore in the same quarter of the previous year, while net revenue was placed at Rs 1,877 crore against Rs 1,553 crore a year ago.

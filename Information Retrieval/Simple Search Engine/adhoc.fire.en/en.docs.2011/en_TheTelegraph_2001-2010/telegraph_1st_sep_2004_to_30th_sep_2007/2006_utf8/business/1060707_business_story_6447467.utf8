 TCG view on Haldia irks Bengal

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, July 6: The West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation (WBIDC) today told The Chatterjee Group (TCG) that it cannot pick and choose clauses from the composite contract to suit its case. 

 The Bengal governments counsel submitted before the Company Law Board (CLB) that under the composite contract on the sale of entire shares of WBIDC, there were reciprocal promises that both parties needed to comply with.

 The Chatterjee Group yesterday staked claim on some Rs 155 crore worth of shares, while contending that it can coexist with the WBIDC in HPL. These shares are being disputed with both the promoters claiming it. 

 The counsel claimed that according to the composite contract, TCG had to bring in more than Rs 500 crore of equity, as well as ensure financial restructuring and bring out an IPO. It cannot pick and choose clauses to suit itself, the counsel said. 

 The counsel said the CLB was not the forum to enforce a composite contract which has been reached between two private parties. 

 The management control that they are harping on would have followed after they finished their obligations, said the WBIDCs counsel.

 The counsel alleged that the demand on 155 crore shares was not in the petition TCG filed with the CLB. 

 They contended that the shares are in the physical form with the WBIDC. TCG has to give its case so far as the 155 crore shares are concerned, it contended.

 The governments counsel also alleged that the TCGs are basing its entire case on gaining management control on legitimate expectation. 

 Everything has to be done to give them control, contended the state governments counsel. The counsel submitted that legitimate expectation has no role in the Indian law.

 RINL eyes four-fold hike in capacity

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Nov. 14: Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Ltd (RINL) aims to expand capacity by over four times to 16 million tonnes by 2020, even as a lack of captive mines plagues the company.

 Popularly known as Vizag Steel, the company currently has a capacity of 3.6 mt.

 Chairman and managing director Y. Siva Sagar Rao said an investment of Rs 25,000 crore, at current prices, would be required to attain the desired capacity.

 The Centre has approved expansion up to 6.8 mt, which the steel PSU plans to complete by 2008-09.

 The National Steel Policy envisages 110 mt capacity by 2020 against the present level of 42 mt. RINLs expansion plans will help it raise its share in the total capacity.

 While it is drawing a roadmap to attain this target, RINL still faces high iron ore and coal prices.

 The company does not have a captive mine for either iron ore or coal, which are the raw materials for steel.

 As a result, it pays four times more for iron ore than its competitors who have captive mines.

 In the first half of this year, it has reported a profit after tax of Rs 540 crore. But the good show comes during the upturn in the global steel industry, helping it tide over difficult times and wiping out accumulated losses.

 Rao said the company was considering possibilities of acquiring mining leases within India and abroad.

 It is also open to the idea of setting up greenfield plants in Orissa and Chhattisgarh in lieu of iron ore mining leases there.

 It has applied for blocks in two states but nothing came of it.

 Rao said RINL was looking at acquiring iron ore and coal mines abroad as well.

 It may start off with a limestone mine in Oman.

 It is also exploring the possibility of acquiring iron ore mines in Brazil, South Africa and other African countries.

 It has also identified a few coal blocks in Australia and America.

 RINL spent Rs 700 crore every year to procure iron ore, while the companys annual coal bill was around Rs 1,400 crore.

 NMDC Ltd, which supplied iron ore to RINL, had effected a 120 per cent hike in prices in the last four years and sold iron ore at international prices, which adversely hit the companys bottomline.

 RINLs annual requirement of iron ore would go up to 10 million tonnes from 6.5 million tonnes after the expansion of Vizag Steel is completed by 2008-09.

 Ficci wary of FTA with Japan

 New Delhi, Dec. 10 (PTI): Complex regulatory and distribution channels, problems in entering Japanese market and lack of direct travel links act as impediments to India-Japan economic ties, industry chamber Ficci has said.

 Problems in obtaining visa for on-site work and perception among Japanese buyers that Indian products are of low quality also add to reasons for low trade between the two countries, a Ficci study has said.

 Trade statistics reveal that from 1993-94 to 2003-04, Japan has slid from being Indias third largest trading partner to its sixth export destination and seventh import source, a Ficci statement said.

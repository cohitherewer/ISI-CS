 Dalal Street din on Lyons Range

 A STAFF REPORTER

 New lease of life

 Calcutta, July 21: Lyons Range is ready to roar again.

 After going into a virtual torpor several years ago, the 100-year-old stock exchange is seeking a new lease of life with its member-brokers agreeing to plug into a Bombay Stock Exchange terminal.

 After a great debate, the brokers? association has approved amendments to the association of articles of the stock exchange to pave way for its demutualisation. They have also accepted a BSE proposal to clamber on to its trading platform. Earlier, NSE had offered CSE brokers to join its trading platform, but it was turned down. 

 BSE has offered to lend a trading terminal to CSE through which the latter?s member brokers will be able to trade in shares listed on BSE. For this terminal connection CSE member brokers would have to pay a one-time fee of Rs 10 crore. However, member brokers of CSE will be able to trade in shares as sub-brokers on the BSE terminal and not as a BSE broker.

 ?The member brokers of Calcutta Stock Exchange Association have also agreed to pay the one-time fee of Rs 10 crore,? said a CSE official.

 Earlier, market regulator Sebi had directed regional stock exchanges to corporatise themselves in order to survive. Most of the stocks are now traded on National Stock Exchange and Bombay Stock Exchange, leaving the 26 regional stock exchanges, including Calcutta Stock Exchange, struggling to stay afloat.

 However, the demutualisation of Calcutta Stock Exchange was held up as a number of member brokers (CSE had about 1,200 member brokers on its register) were up in arms against Sebi-appointed administrator T.K. Das. 

 Das was appointed by Sebi as an independent administrator of Calcutta Stock Exchange after a scam was unearthed in 2003. 

 Demanding a refund of their money (about Rs 4.3 crore) kept in the settlement guarantee Fund, they stalled the proceedings for amendments in the articles of association of CSE several times, bringing the market to a halt.

 However, on June 9, they approved the amendment to raise the authorised capital of the stock exchange to Rs 10 lakh from Rs 3 lakh at present by creating 2,800 fresh equity shares of Rs 250 each.

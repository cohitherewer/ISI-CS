 One India now on RIL landlines

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Jan. 9: Reliance Infocomm today formally extended its One India tariff scheme to the fixed wireless segment.

 Under the new plan, fixed wireless customers will be able to make calls to anywhere in the country for Re 1 per minute, the company said.

 But the STD calls across the country would be available at Re 1 per minute under a particular scheme with a fixed monthly rental of Rs 499.

 Meanwhile, the new scheme hiked the local call charges from Reliance to other networks by 2.5 times.

 The current fixed phone STD charges varies from Rs 1.80 to Rs 2.40 per minute.

 Reliance Infocomm also announced a new zero rental, life time incoming free scheme for its fixed wireless customers. Under the scheme, for a one-time payment of Rs 2999, Reliance customers will get life time incoming free on their fixed phones.

 The tariff will be Rs 1.20 per pulse for local calls, with the 3-minute pulse to local fixed phones and Reliance phones and 45-second pulse for mobiles in non-metros and 60-second pulse applicable for mobiles in metros. Existing Reliance fixed wireless customers can also enrol for this lifetime free incoming offer by paying one time charge of Rs 1999.

 We would like to revolutionise fixed wireless phone tariffs with these two plans, said S.P. Shukla, president, wireless, Reliance Infocomm.

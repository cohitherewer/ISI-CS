 Aiyar booster for GAIL network 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Aiyar: Look-east policy

 New Delhi, Jan. 6: Petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar is in favour of giving more independence to GAIL for expanding its pipeline network to Bengal and other states in the eastern region.

 Bay of Bengal is fast emerging as the North Sea of South Asia and given the huge reserves in Myanmar, there is a need for a pipeline network in the eastern states, he said while inaugurating GAILs hi-tech national gas management centre in Noida today.

 The countrys oil and gas reserves are national assets and the huge gas reserves in the KG basin should not be limited for consumption in Andhra Pradesh but brought to Bengal as well, he added. 

 The minister said some excessive restrictions on GAIL, like ensuring supply sources and tying up demand before planning to lay gas pipelines, need to be relaxed in view of the changing dynamics of the hydrocarbon sector.

 Aiyar said while gas discoveries are continuing in the KG basin, oil companies have drawn a blank in the Mahanadi basin last year. However, drilling operations are continuing in the basin and I am optimistic that we will make some finds this year. 

 He said GAIL and its Russian partner, Gazprom, are drilling off the Bengal shoreline, while an ONGC rig is exploring oil and gas in the Sunderbans. 

 These are the areas from where next finds may come, he added. 

 The minister said it is becoming increasingly clear that the growth in natural gas production would outstrip oil in the coming years and GAIL should be allowed to gear up for the eventuality.

 He said Bangladesh was not coming forward on the Myanmar-Bangladesh-India pipeline proposal due to political reasons, although the participating countries will gain economically from this venture. Dhaka has not moved forward on the proposal since the last meeting held in Yangon a year ago, he added. 

 Meanwhile, the minister has asked GAIL to provide the small additional quantity of gas to the bangle makers of Agra and the adjoining Ferozabad area. 

 He said these are small, family-run enterprises and GAIL should be able to arrange for the extra 0.3 million standard cubic metres of gas per day as part of its corporate social responsibility.

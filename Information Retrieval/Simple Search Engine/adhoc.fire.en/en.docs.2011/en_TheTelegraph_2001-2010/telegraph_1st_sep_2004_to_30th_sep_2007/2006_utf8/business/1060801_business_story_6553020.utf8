 Selloff spares IOC the blushes

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Behuria: Unhappy

 New Delhi, July 31: A fat cheque of Rs 3,225 crore from its sale of ONGC shares helped IOC paper over a Rs 1,444-crore operating loss with a net profit of Rs 1,781 crore in the first quarter.

 IOC chairman Sarthak Behuria, however, said the financial situation of the company is horrendous as it is losing around Rs 100 crore per day on the sale of LPG, kerosene, petrol, and diesel. 

 He said the earnings from the sale of 20 per cent of its stake in ONGC give a distorted picture of its finances. It is only a one-time earning that will not be able to bail out the company during the rest of the fiscal. The government will have to do something.

 He said the under-recoveries on petrol and diesel were Rs 6.31 per litre and Rs 8.25 per litre, respectively. The company was also losing Rs 18.69 per litre on kerosene and Rs 166 per cylinder on domestic cooking gas. 

 The under-realisation from these four petroleum products, at Rs 4,898 crore during the first quarter, caused the operational loss. 

 A year ago, the under-recoveries were lower at Rs 3,194 crore and net loss was Rs 58 crore.

 The balance sheet has incorporated Rs 2,987 crore from ONGC for the subsidy on LPG and kerosene but not the oil bonds as these are yet to be issued by the government. 

 Behuria said IOC was expecting the government to issue interest-bearing bonds worth Rs 7,000 crore towards the end of the second quarter. The bonds would be in the balance sheet when the company receives them, Behuria said. 

 Net borrowings at the end of June was Rs 22,539 crore and the debt-equity ratio was 0.73 :1. 

 Behuria said the 26 per cent rise in sales turnover to Rs 53,164 crore from Rs 42,340 crore did not work to the companys advantage as the products were being sold at a loss.

 IOC exported 0.8 million tonnes of products, of which naphtha accounted for 0.3 million tonnes. Export turnover was Rs 1,294 crore, almost the same as last year. 

 The seven refineries generated a throughput of 10.03 million tonnes against 9.88 million tonnes a year ago. 

 The output of the companys Haldia, Gujarat, Mathura and Panipat refineries went up during this fiscal with a gross profit margin of $6.70 per barrel.

 Behuria said IOC would be bidding for oil blocks with upstream companies, such as OIL. He said IOC was open to tie-ups for convenience stores both with global retail giants such as Walmart and with domestic majors such as Pantaloon. The proposal could take shape in the long run as pushing up sales of petroleum products now was a losing proposition, he added.

 Kingfisher First takes off

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, April 15: Kingfisher Airlines today launched a premium first class service on its flights. Christened Kingfisher First, the service seeks to redefine business class flying in the country.

 With this launch, Vijay Mallya, who heads the airline, is going back on his initial plan. Mallya had launched the airline in May last year with a single-class configuration. The airline, with 174 seats, had promised air travellers an experience that combined business class comfort with economy.

 However, with the economy on a roll and consumers willing to splurge on premium products, Kingfisher Airlines has knocked 60 of these seats to make space for 20 first class seats. The new configuration in some of its flights will now include 20 first class seats and 104 economy class seats.

 Despite the reduction in the number of seats, the airline is offering air travellers an experience, which Mallya claims, is unique in India. On offer in Kingfisher First is the plushest Sleeperette seats with a 48-inch pitch, 125-degree recline, adjustable headrests and fully extendable footrests. 

I am proud to introduce Kingfisher First to 

the world. I have personally taken care of each and every detail and am very happy 

that the discerning Indian business travellers will now have an option that they 

truly deserve. Kingfisher First is truly a first class experience and is all set 

to redefine business class flying in the country, Mallya said.

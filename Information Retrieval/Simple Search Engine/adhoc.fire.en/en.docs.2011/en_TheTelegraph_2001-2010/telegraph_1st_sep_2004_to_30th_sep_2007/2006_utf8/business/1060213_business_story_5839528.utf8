 Sun Micro to raise user base in east 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Feb. 12: Sun Microsystems India is keen to increase its user base in the eastern region.

 The company has an office in the city with a staff strength of six to seven people, said K.P. Unnikrishnan, marketing director, Sun Microsystems India. It also has an engineering centre in Bangalore which employs around 1200 people and is the largest such centre outside the US.

 Sun Microsystems currently employs 1400 people in the country, which includes the staff from recent acquisitions like See Beyond and Storage Tek. 

 The industrial resurgence in the east has led to an increased awareness about the region which Sun intends to leverage, especially by improving the technology awareness for small and medium businesses, said Unnikrishnan.

 The firm is also organising product launches, partner programmes and dealer meets as Sun has old customers from the region, Unnikrishnan said. Sun has launched its UltraSPARC T1 Niagara platform server in the city.

 Globally servers account for 70 per cent of the companys earnings, while in India, Sun is growing much higher than the industry growth rate of 20.7 per cent, said Unnikrishnan.

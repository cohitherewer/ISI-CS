 Spotlight on farm reforms

 Calcutta, May 5: The domestic farm sector needs to be opened up to ward off competition from developed countries that dole out huge subsidies in agriculture.

 Agriculture is a bone of contention at WTOs Doha round of multilateral negotiations. Developing countries are demanding a reduction in subsidies that make their farm products uncompetitive in the international market.

 We must reform our farm sector, abolish archaic laws and make more investment. In the next 10-15 years, Indian farm sector should become more competitive, S.N. Menon, Union commerce secretary, said in Calcutta today.

 Menon called for more investment in farm infrastructure such as cold storages and cold chains. He also said the laws on protection to farmers need to be liberalised.

 Speaking at a discussion organised by the Bengal National Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Menon said the successful completion of the Doha round would benefit India.

 Those who said WTO did not help in doing away with the subsidies given by the developed countries in agriculture, were not realistic. If WTO was not there, farm subsidies could have been at very high levels. At least, they have been brought down, but not to the extent of satisfaction of the developing nations, he said.

 He warned if the present deadlock in negotiations was not resolved by July, the deadline to end the current negotiation by the end of this year would be missed.

 The major cause for concern was that the developed countries were not showing interest in multi-lateral agreements. 

 He said their growing preference to shift to bilateral talks would definitely put pressure on developing countries. 

 Menon said under the circumstances, the overall picture did not look promising for completing the Doha round in time.

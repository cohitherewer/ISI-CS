 South African buyout tonic for Ranbaxy

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Malvinder: Going places

 Mumbai, Dec. 1: Ranbaxy Laboratories has acquired South African drug firm Be-Tabs Pharmaceuticals (Pty) Ltd for $70 million.

 The acquisition of Be-Tabs results in considerable synergies and strengthens Ranbaxys foothold in South Africa. It reinforces our position by expanding our portfolio in a market with strong growth potential, Ranbaxy CEO amp; managing director Malvinder Mohan Singh said.

 The company would utilise Be-Tabss manufacturing facility in Johannesburg to produce drugs, including anti-retrovirals, not only for the South African market but also to cater to the African continent, he added.

 Ranbaxy would fund the transaction from the $440-million FCCB it had raised earlier this year. The company said the transaction is valued at 2.2 times of sales and 7.7 times of EBITDA multiples of Be-Tabs.

 With sales of about $30 million, Be-Tabs is the fifth largest generic company in South Africa and one of the most profitable companies in the market. Singh said the combined sales of Ranbaxy and Be-Tabs would be around $55 million in South Africa.

 The deal, however, has to be approved by South Africas Competition Council authority and is expected to be completed in the first quarter of the next calendar year.

 The acquisition will help us provide effective disease management solutions in support of the governments objective to make healthcare affordable to a wider cross-section of the population, Singh said.

 Be-Tabs is the fifth largest generic player and the largest penicillin manufacturer in South Africa. It has a strong over-the-counter (OTC) portfolio with significant brand recognition, Singh said.

 South Africa is the largest pharma market in Africa, valued at close to $2 billion with a high potential for generic growth. Ranbaxy South Africa commenced its commercial operations in 1996, and it caters to acute, chronic and over-the-counter (OTC) therapeutic segments.

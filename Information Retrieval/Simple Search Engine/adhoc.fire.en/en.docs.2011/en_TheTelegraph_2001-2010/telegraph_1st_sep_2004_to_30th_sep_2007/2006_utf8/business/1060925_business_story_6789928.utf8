 Workers call off strike at Honda

 New Delhi, Sept. 24 (PTI): The six-day long strike by contract workers of Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India (HMSI), demanding regularisation of their jobs, has been called off after an agreement was reached between the labourers and their contractor early this morning, the company said today.

 The strike is over as an agreement has been reached between the workers and their contractor, HMSI vice-president, general affairs, H.S. Shekhawat said.

 He said the workers would resume their duties from tomorrow.

 They have withdrawn all their demands and have agreed to join work from Monday, he said. He, however, added that the details of the agreement were awaited as it was reached between the contractors and the casual workers and the management was not a part of it. The agreement follows an order by a civil court in Gurgaon.

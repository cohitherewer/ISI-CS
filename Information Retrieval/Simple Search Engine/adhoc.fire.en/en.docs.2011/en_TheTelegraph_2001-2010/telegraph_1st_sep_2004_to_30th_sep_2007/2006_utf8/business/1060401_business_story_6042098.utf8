 Mumbai, March 31: Aiming to position itself as the number three brand in the sports lifestyle sector in the Indian market, German company Puma today said it would open exclusive stores in the country starting from the second quarter of 2006.

 Our primary aim would be to establish the presence of our brand in India and then look into financial performances, said Martin Bowen, who is Pumas general manager in charge of eastern Europe, West Asia and Africa.

 However, he declined to divulge the market share it aimed to grab. 

 Puma would try to establish itself as the most desirable sport lifestyle company in India, in sync with its global ambition, he said.

 The company would open exclusive retail stores in the country, initially in the five cities of Bangalore, Chennai, Mumbai, Hyderabad and Delhi.

 The first store, he said, could be opened either in Bangalore or Chennai.

 Bowen added the company would lay equal emphasis on all the three ranges ? apparel, footwear and accessories ? for the Indian market.

 With rapid growth in demand for brands, a burgeoning affluent middle class and future economic reform, India is poised to be one of the most exciting and rewarding places for a dynamic sports lifestyle brand, he added.

 Puma will set up a fully owned subsidiary for the West Asian region. The subsidiary will be based in Dubai and will co-ordinate the companys efforts across the region. 

 Asked about the governments recent move to allow 51 per cent FDI in single brand retailing, Puma said there was lack of clarity in the policy and there had to be more effort from the government to encourage single brand retail stores.

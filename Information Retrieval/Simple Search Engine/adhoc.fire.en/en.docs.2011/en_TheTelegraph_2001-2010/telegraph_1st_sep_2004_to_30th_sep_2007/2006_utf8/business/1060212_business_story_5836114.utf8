 Oracle sticks to estimates, cuts jobs 

 San Francisco, Feb. 11 (Reuters): Oracle Corp has cut 2,000 jobs in connection with its acquisition of rival software maker Siebel Systems and issued a profit outlook for the remainder of the year roughly in line with Wall Street estimates.

 Adam Holt, an analyst at JP Morgan, said the company also gave Wall Street a positive surprise by effectively raising its outlook for license revenue for the third quarter and outlining a fourth-quarter range that exceeded analysts expectations.

 The database and applications areas are doing better, he said.

 Oracle chief executive Larry Ellison said a smooth integration of PeopleSoft and market acceptance of Oracles Fusion package, which is aimed at tying together products acquired in recent takeovers, were helping to drive growth. Oracle plans to deliver Fusion in 2008.

 There were some uncertainties as to what we were going to do with our applications business after we bought PeopleSoft, and I think those questions have been answered, Ellison told investors on a conference call.

 Both the applications business and the technology business look very strong for the third quarter, he added.

 The financial forecast comes a little more than a week after Oracle closed its $5.85-billion acquisition of Siebel in a deal giving the business software maker a stronger foothold as it challenges industry leader SAP AG of Germany.

 In the past two years, Oracle has spent some $19 billion buying up rivals to grab a bigger share of the market for software aimed at big businesses that helps automate everything from human resources to accounting to inventory management.

 Even with the buying spree, a recent $5.75 billion debt offering to help finance the Siebel deal and planned stock buybacks, Oracle executives said there was still room for more acquisitions.

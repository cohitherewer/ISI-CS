 Sebi tweaks NAV norms for mutuals

 Mumbai, Oct. 11 (PTI): In a move that could protect the interest of small investors and discourage the discriminatory practices benefiting corporate and institutional investors, market regulator Sebi today issued guidelines on uniform cut-off timing for net asset values of the mutual funds.

 According to the latest guidelines Sebi issued today, every mutual fund should reckon the cut-off timings for all its schemes and plans and these should be uniformly implemented for all its investors.

 Moreover, all MFs have been asked to deposit each payment instrument for subscription or purchase of units in the bank, the regulator said. 

 Industry experts said the guidelines should discourage discriminatory practices among corporate and institutional investors taking advantage of the absence of a strict cut-off timing of net asset value of mutual funds. 

 Sebi said it was approached by the Association of Mutual Funds in India (Amfi) seeking some modifications to the previous circular on uniform cut-off timings for applicability of net asset value of MF schemes/plans. The market regulator said the proposal was considered and accordingly the following guidelines were issued.

 The new guidelines will be effective from October 16 and are aimed at protecting the interests of investors in securities and to promote the development of and to regulate the securities market, Sebi said. 

 The substance of these guidelines should also be disclosed to investors in the offer document or in any addendum thereto, it added. 

 It added that the status of compliance with these guidelines should be reported to it in all the bi-monthly compliance reports of the asset management company and the half-yearly trustee reports.

 According to the guidelines specifying the cut-off timings for purchase of units in liquid fund schemes, the closing NAV of the day immediately preceding the day of receipt of application should be applicable for those received by 12.00 noon. For applications received later than that, the closing NAV of the day immediately preceding the next business day would be applicable.

 Irrespective of the time of receipt of application, where the funds are not available for utilisation on the day of the application, the closing NAV of the day immediately preceding the day on which the funds are available for utilisation would be applicable, the guidelines added.

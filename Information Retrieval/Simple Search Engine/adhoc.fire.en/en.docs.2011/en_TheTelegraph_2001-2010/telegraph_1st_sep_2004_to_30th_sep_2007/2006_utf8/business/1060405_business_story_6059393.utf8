 New policy this month

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 4: A new civil aviation policy has been sent for cabinet approval and will be unveiled this month. The policy is expected to contain safety regulations and guidelines and redefine the role of the directorate general of civil aviation (DGCA).

 The new civil aviation policy has been sent to the cabinet secretariat. So far as the ministry is concerned, all discussions in this respect is over. We expect the policy to be in place this month, said civil aviation minister Praful Patel.

 Patel added that the government was open to the idea of creating multiple airports in bigger cities such as Delhi and Mumbai. We are not averse to the idea of creating multiple airports in metropolitan cities, the minister said.

 On the merger and acquisition guidelines recommended recently by the aircraft acquisition committee, he said: It is not for the government to decide who buys whom or who merges with whom. The only thing that has to be seen is whether the entities are security cleared or not and whether they adhere to the rules and guidelines of the DGCA.

 Meanwhile, the committee on review and restructuring of DGCA today recommended a series of measures, including notifying DGCA as sole apex body for safety and economic regulation of the sector.

 It (DGCA) should also act as a catalyst for the growth of the manufacturing sector in civil aviation, said the report.

 The committee, however, suggested that there is no need to convert it into an authority. This might make it commercial in outlook and lower its effectiveness in performing the sovereign function of regulation, the report said.

 The seven-member committee, headed by former union secretary M.K. Kaw, which submitted its report to civil aviation minister Praful Patel today, also suggested introduction of an Indian civil aviation service for these personnel.

 The committee said a policy should be drafted for route rationalisation to make full use of the reciprocal gains in the bilateral and multilateral agreements.

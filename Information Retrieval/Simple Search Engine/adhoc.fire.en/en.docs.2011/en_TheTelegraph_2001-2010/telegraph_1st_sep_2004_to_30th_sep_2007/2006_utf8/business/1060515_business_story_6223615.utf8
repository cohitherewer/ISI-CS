 Q amp;A

 In your interest 

 Does the annual accrued interest on National Savings Certificates purchased before and after 2005-06 qualify for deduction from income under section 80C in the assessment year 2006-07? Do I have to pay any tax at the time of maturity of these National Savings Certificates?

 A.K.Dutt, Calcutta 

 Yes, the interest income on National Savings Certificates qualify for deduction from income under section 80C till the maturity. On maturity, the whole amount, that is, principal plus accrued interest is taxable. 

 The accrued interest on National Saving Certificates is not paid out to the investor every year. It is reinvested. The interest amount accrued in one year earns an interest income in the next year ? this is called cumulative interest. The annual interest income is thus considered as reinvestment and qualifies for section 80C benefit.

 Income from MIS

 Does the interest on postal monthly income scheme held by my wife (first holder) and me jointly add to my income while calculating income tax? The investment was made from my retirement benefits.

 Ranjit Roy, Chinsura

 You didnt mention whether your wife is working or non-working. If we assume that she is a housewife and you are a joint holder of the account, the interest you receive thereon has to be added to your total annual income for the purpose of tax calculation. 

 Bonds exempt

 I am a taxpayer. I had bought IDBI infrastructure bonds for tax saving purposes. Is the interest income from these bonds exempted from income tax under section 10(15)?

 Ruma Nandy, Chandannagar

 The interest income from infrastructure bonds, including IDBI Flexibonds, is exempted from the calculation of annual income of a taxpayer under section 10(15). So, you need not take into account the interest income from these bonds while calculating your annual income.

 Innovative Uco tools to raise money

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Feb. 24: Calcutta-based Uco Bank will soon issue innovative financial instruments, such as perpetual and upper tier II bonds, a month after the Reserve Bank allowed banks to raise funds through this route. It will be the first bank in the country to issue such hybrid instruments.

 Uco is planning to raise close to Rs 500 crore through a Rs-200-crore tier I perpetual debt issue and Rs-300-crore upper tier II bond issue.

 Last month, the central bank allowed banks to issue innovative perpetual debt instruments that is eligible for inclusion as tier 1 capital and debt capital instruments eligible for inclusion as upper tier II capital. It will help banks fund capital expenditure as well as meet Basel II norms, which will come into force from March 2007.

 Banks, particularly the nationalised ones, have been pressing the RBI and government to allow them to issue such instruments as their ability to raise funds through the capital markets is nearly exhausted with the Centres holding in many cases approaching 51 per cent. The government has said it would not prune its holding in public sector banks to below 51 per cent.

 Rating agency Crisil today assigned a AA/stable rating to Ucos innovative instruments, the first rating assigned on any hybrid instrument in the country. The rating is seen as a milestone in the evolution of the countrys financial markets.

 Among the two instruments, the tenure of a perpetual debt issue is permanent and the bank pays either a fixed or a floating rate of interest. 

 The RBI has allowed banks to exercise a call option after a period of 10 years from the launch of the issue. Sources said since this is the first time that a bank is issuing a perpetual bond, specific details such as interest rates are yet to be worked out. 

 It is for the first time that we are seeing the issuance of such a paper. It will be a test case as the bank will have to find a benchmark vis-?-vis the interest rate, said sources at Crisil.

 The target investors for this issue will largely be those having a long-term perspective such as provident funds and insurance companies.

 An upper tier II bond issue, whose tenure is 15 years, is different from the normal subordinated debt issue (also known as lower tier II bonds). 

 For the upper tier II bond, the RBI has put a rule that the bank can pay an interest only if its capital adequacy ratio is above 9 per cent. The lower tier II bonds typically have a tenure of 10 years.

 Tier I capital refers to the core capital of a bank and it consists of capital, statutory reserves, revenues and other reserves. Tier II comprises of revaluation reserve, undisclosed reserves, hybrid capital apart from subordinated debts.

 Crisil expects the central governments support and Ucos adequate liquidity to continue to offset its low capitalisation and average asset quality. The government holds a 74.98 per cent stake in the bank. Uco had a total deposit base of Rs 49,470 crore and advances of Rs 2,76,56 crore as on March 31, 2005.

 Calcutta, April 6: The Small Industries Development Bank of India (Sidbi) will focus more on lending to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) directly and reduce its refinancing activities. The move has been encouraged by a significant growth in its direct financing business.

 ?We shifted our focus from refinancing to direct financing of SMEs two-and-a-half years ago and launched a number of loan products, including a credit guarantee scheme for micro enterprises. The business (direct financing) has grown significantly at the national level and in the eastern region last fiscal.? Sidbi executive director V. Chandrasekaran said on the sidelines of a CII-organised seminar here on banking for inclusive growth.

 Sidbi?s loan outstanding in the eastern region last fiscal stood at Rs 1,100 crore, representing a growth of 25 per cent over the previous year. At the all India level, the financial institution had Rs 10,000-crore loan outstanding to the SME sector till 2004-05.

 Sidbi expects to clock a higher growth rate in 2005-06 on the back of an increased demand for credit and reach the Rs 14,000-crore mark. 

 Ahead of a board meeting, Chandrasekaran declined to confirm or decline whether Sidbi is considering a move to take over some other financial institution to grow its business. ?I won?t comment on this ahead of a board meeting,? he said. He, however, added that the institution is entering into tie-ups with state finance corporations to widen its reach.

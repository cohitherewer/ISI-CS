 Higher service tax nets 15 more

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi, Feb. 28 : Finance minister P. Chidambaram today cast the service tax net high and wide, raising its rate from 10 per cent to 12 per cent and bringing 15 new services like ATM operations and Internet telephony within its ambit.

 The new services brought under the tax net also include services of share transfer agents and registrars.

 Sale of space for advertisements other than in print media, sponsorship of events, except those of sports, international air travel other than economy class, public relations services and Internet telephony will also invite the tax.

 Bankers, however, noted that the incidence of taxation on ATM operations will lie with those managing ATM services for the banks and the service tax payable will be based on the total payment made by the banks to these companies and not on transactions carried out by customers at ATM machines.

 Chidambaram has also lifted the exemption of the tax to six services, including call centres, re-insurance premium received from both domestic and overseas sources and catering services provided in academic institutions and medical establishments by outdoor caterers.

 He has also removed the exemption granted to medical transcription centres, railway catering services by outside caterers and services provided by a chartered accountant other than auditing and accounting services. The tax on these would come into effect from tomorrow. 

 Internet telephony, which offers low cost options for international calls, will also invite a 12 per cent tax. 

 Sponsored entertainment events, other than sports events, will also fall in the net, as will ship management services and cruise ship transporters.

 Credit card, debit card and other card-related services are also in the tax net.

 The finance minister has clarified that service provided by a banker to a public issue will invite service tax as will clinical testings for drugs and formulations.

 Chidambaram, however, has exempted all taxable services provided by the Reserve Bank of India from the tax liability. 

 Pointing out that the service sector contributed as much as 54 per cent of the GDP, Chidambaram proposed to raise the rate from 10 per cent to 12 to double the collections to Rs 34,500 crore in 2006-07. 

 During 2005-06, the gove-rnment is likely to collect Rs 23,000 crore (revised estimates) against the budget estimate of Rs 17,500 crore. 

 The increased tax rate would be applicable from the date of enactment of the Finance Bill, 2006, he said in his 2006-07 budget presentation.

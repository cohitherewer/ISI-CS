 Govt set to cap pension FDI at 26%

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 30: The government will cap foreign investment for the pension sector at 26 per cent and also give licence preference to funds that guarantee fixed returns.

 This is likely to force private pension funds to give subscribers the option of parking their savings in government securities against risking them in the stock or debt markets. It would also help the government garner funds. 

 Though the draft pension regulatory bill does not yet have any specific clause on capping the FDI, finance ministry officials said this was likely to be weaved in to pacify the Left. 

 The Left parties are against allowing FDI caps to be determined by government notifications in sensitive sectors like insurance and pension. They want Parliament to take the decision.

 The Lefts argument is that insurance and pension can soak up huge funds needed for the countrys infrastructure development and will always play a pivotal role in its economy. It is estimated that these two sectors could command resources running into huge sums. Hence, control of such sectors should remain with Parliament. 

 Some time ago, when the Congress tried to hike the FDI cap in insurance, the Left had threatened to join hands with the BJP in scuttling any amendments to the Insurance Regulatory Authority Act seeking to hike the FDI.

 However, the government will not agree with the Lefts demand of not allowing FDI at all in the pension sector, officials said.

 It is stressing that FDI in this sector should be allowed due to domestic requirement. The finance ministry has pointed out that Indias foreign exchange reserves, which has been rising in recent times, are dangerously tilted towards hot money ? NRI deposits and FII investments in stock markets ? which can be pulled out in a short period of time.

 Six pension funds, including five private funds and one state-run fund, which will be given the permission to enter the sector under the proposed law, will be allowed to invest in stock, debt and gilt markets.

 All pension players will have to offer a basic fixed-income scheme. If the player launches separate pension schemes, each will have to be separately managed. 

 The government will work out a separate system of cross-subsidisation between various schemes and players so as to make the basic scheme for the poorer section attractive and low cost. 

 The base pension scheme, which is expected to have a monthly contribution of as low as Rs 100, is likely to attract at least 20 million participants in the initial years, building up a corpus of over Rs 10,000 crore within five years. 

 For the base scheme, pension players will act as trusts responsible for collection, records, investment management and pay-outs.

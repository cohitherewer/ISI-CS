 Parsvanath flotation soon 

 URVASHI KAUL

 New Delhi, May 16: The Rs 1600-crore initial public offering of Parsvanath Developers is likely to hit the capital market on May 29. The 3.3-crore shares on offer are likely to be priced at Rs 480 apiece with a face value of Rs 10. 

 This will be the first real estate issue, where foreign institutional investors will be able to invest after rules governing FII investment in real estate was changed recently.

 The FII participation is going to be a positive development. Also, the demand for infrastructure will open up newer avenues, said a real estate consultant with Cushman and Wakefield.

 FII participation in the Indian real estate market is going to set a trend. However, real estate issues will anyway have over-subscriptions with or without FIIs, said a real estate consultant with Real Tech. Real estate firms will diversify into infrastructure, as there is a huge demand there, and this is just the beginning, he added. 

 JP Morgan Stanley, DSP Merrill Lynch, Enam Financial Consultants are the book running lead managers for the issue. The company had filed the draft red herring prospectus with the Sebi last month. 

 Parsvanath plans to use the proceeds for its real estate projects in various parts of the country. 

 Real estate consultants believe the Parsvanath issue is unlikely to have any influence on the final pricing of the DLF IPO.

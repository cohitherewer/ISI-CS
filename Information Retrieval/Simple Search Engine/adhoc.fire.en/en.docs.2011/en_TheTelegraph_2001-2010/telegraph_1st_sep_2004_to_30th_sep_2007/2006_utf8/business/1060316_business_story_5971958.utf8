 FDI row trapped in captive mines

 New Delhi, March 15: Captive mining of iron ore and coal can become the latest area of conflict between the Congress-led government and the Left parties on foreign direct investment.

 While the UPA government wants to allow up to 100 per cent FDI in captive iron ore and coal mining, the Left parties do not see much merit in this decision. 

 An inter-ministerial group, which has reviewed the National Mineral Policy, wants amendments to the Mines and Minerals Development and Regulation (MMDR) Act, 1957 to allow FDI in captive coal and iron ore mining. 

 Multinationals keen to enter the lucrative sector say globally steel and power companies do not mine coal or iron ore and depend on specialised companies for this purpose.

 In India, captive mines are however, given to those companies which set up steel mills or power plants. 

 Top officials said steel majors like Mittal Steel and Posco want 100 per cent FDI in both iron ore and captive coal mining and would like to rope in global mining partners.

 There is, however, a difference of opinion within the bureaucracy over the FDI limit that should be allowed.

 While existing domestic majors like the Tatas and SAIL have not voiced opposition to the relaxation of rules for captive mining, they have made presentations to the government against the export of scarce resources like high-grade iron ore. 

 Domestic steel makers have long been sore about cheap export of high-grade iron ore to Japan. Their point is that the domestic steel industry is expanding and will need high-class ore and this should not be exported. 

 While their point is being accepted and an export ceiling of 4 million tones of ore a year, with a ceiling of 62 per cent on the iron content, is likely to be imposed, the larger issue of allowing FDI in captive mining is likely to be pushed through despite the Left opposition.

 Officials said they had taken the decision to lower the cap on ore exports as China has reduced the export of coking coal since it wants to reserve the scare resource for a fast-expanding steel industry in that country. 

 A contest over scarce raw materials is emerging. We cant just go ahead and give away our strategic reserves of high-class ore even as others are doing the opposite, say senior officials in the Planning Commission. 

 The two scarce resources now being sought after in the global commodities market are high-grade iron ore and high-class coal needed to make steel. India and Brazil are the only nations with such ore with iron content of 60-65 per cent. 

 The commission has, in fact, been pushing for the adoption of a policy to encourage those who wish to import ore to set up steel making capacity here. 

 The aim should be to encourage value-added exports ... let them convert ore into steel for their car-making or other needs here itself, officials said. 

 It is this thinking which has led to the tentative policy of allowing 100 per cent FDI in captive mining. 

 The Lefts reading of the situation is, however, different. It feels that Indian companies should get priority over Indian resources. The Left point of view is that when the Tatas, SAIL and the Jindals are planning massive expansion, iron ore should not only be kept reserved for them but they should also be given preference over the MNCs.

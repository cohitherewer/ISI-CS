 New Delhi, April 4: Singapore-based Flextronics today picked up a minority stake in SemIndia Incs $3-billion project for setting up a chip manufacturing facility in Hyderabad. 

 Flextronics, an electronics manufacturing services provider, did not disclose the quantum of its investment in the project. 

 With the government pumping in $250 million, the project, divided into three phases, will see $500 million raised through private equity. 

 The project has a 2:1 debt equity ratio where $1 billion is being raised as equity and $2 billion will be taken in as debt, SemIndia chairman Vinod K. Agarwal said.

 Under the agreement, Flextronics will manufacture electronic products for SemIndia, which, in turn, will manufacture semiconductor chips for the various product categories that Flextronics manufactures in India. 

 The product categories include cell phone chips, set-top boxes and personal computers. SemIndia had earlier announced plans to manufacture advanced semiconductor chips for PCs, cell phones, set-top boxes and broadband. The new facility would be located in Hyderabad.

 After being made in Hyderabad, the chips would be sent to Chennai for use in end products. The factory operation is scheduled to start in July. 

 Flextronics is a $15.9-billion revenues company, spread over a network of 30 countries. The company employs nearly 4,000 people at its three units in New Delhi, Bangalore and Chennai.

 We want to make a global world-class manufacturing base in India, company managing director Peter Tan said. 

 In November last year SemIndia had said US-based Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD) will provide technology for making the chips.

 Agarwal said, This partnership will successfully manage to bring together all components of the ecosystem in India ? chip designing, embedded software, logistics, access, information system, hardware manufacturing and R amp;D. 

 According to the Indian Semiconductor Association and the Frost amp; Sullivan report, the market for semiconductors in India is expected to cross the $40-billion mark by 2015.

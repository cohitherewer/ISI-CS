 LSE hawks AIM trade platform

 Mumbai, Nov. 5 (PTI): London Stock Exchange (LSE) is wooing Indian companies to tap much broader investor base by getting listed in the exchange-regulated AIM platform, its international market for small and growing companies.

 In a recent roadshow in India, LSE officials met the management of 30 prospective companies across the sectors for entry in AIM.

 There is an increasing interest from India, China and Russia to get listed in AIM, said LSEs head of company services (UK and international) Tracey Pierce, who is on a visit to India.

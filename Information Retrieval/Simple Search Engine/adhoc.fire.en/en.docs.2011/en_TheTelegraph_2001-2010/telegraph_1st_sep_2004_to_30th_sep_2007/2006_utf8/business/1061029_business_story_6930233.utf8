 New vistas

 Tokyo, Oct. 28 (Reuters): Toyota Motor Corp will build two assembly plants in North America, Japans Mainichi newspaper reported on Saturday. 

 Toyota is considering building a plant in the northern part of Midwest to assemble Yaris compact cars, which are selling well, the Japanese daily said.

 The plant, with annual production capacity of 200,000 units, was expected to be operational in 2009, it said.

 Toyota will also build another plant in North America to start producing sport utility vehicles around 2010, it said.

 Toyota will decide where to build the assembly plants by the end of this year, the daily said.

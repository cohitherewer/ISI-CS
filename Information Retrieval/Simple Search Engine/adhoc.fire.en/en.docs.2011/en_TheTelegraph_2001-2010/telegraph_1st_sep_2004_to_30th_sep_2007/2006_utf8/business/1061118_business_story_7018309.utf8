 $1-billion GSPC float in pipeline

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Nov. 17: It could be the next mega initial public offering by an oil company in the domestic market after Cairn India. Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation (GSPC) is considering a $1-billion (Rs 4,500 crore) offer next year to part-finance its expansion plans in exploration amp; production.

 Cairn India, a subsidiary of Edinburgh-based Cairn Energy, has already filed a draft red herring prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) and it is estimated that the company could raise up to $2 billion from the IPO.

 Confirming that GSPC could enter the capital market next year, senior officials told The Telegraph from Gandhinagar that nothing concrete has been finalised so far. 

 Discussions are already on and the groundwork for the IPO has started. However, the details are yet to be finalised, they said. 

 GSPC managing director D. Jagatheesa Pandian was not available for comment. 

 GSPC may also raise around $1 billion by selling up to 30 per cent from its natural gas block in the Krishna Godavari basin. BP Plc, British Gas and a couple of other firms are reported to be vying for the stake.

 In June this year, GSPC had said its consortium had struck oil and natural gas again in the KG-17 well. This came a year after GSPC estimated that KG-8 well had a reserve of 20 trillion cubic feet (TCF) natural gas.

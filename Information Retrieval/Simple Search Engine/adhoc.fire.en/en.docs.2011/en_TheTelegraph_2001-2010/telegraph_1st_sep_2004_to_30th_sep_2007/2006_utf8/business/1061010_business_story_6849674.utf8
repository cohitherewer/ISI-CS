The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 ITC sows seeds of farm retail

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Calcutta, Oct. 9: ITC Ltd is planning to kick off its agri-retail business in the city by the middle of 2007. The company will take on the likes of Reliance and Spencers which are planning similar ventures in the city.

 ITC, the cigarette-to-hotels conglomerate based in the city, has started laying the groundwork for the project through market research and value chain analysis.

 The company will next interact with farmers to procure fruits and vegetables. 

 ITC plans to expand its operations from Calcutta to other cities of Bengal as well.

 The rollout in the state is part of a plan for 140 stores in 54 cities across the country under the Choupal Fresh brand.

 The company is now scouting for suitable properties for the stores and the terminal markets where farmers will bring their produce for primary sorting and grading.

 Given the unique model of Choupal-Fresh, we have to select the locations in such a way that it has to be accessible to both retail and wholesale, S Sivakumar, chief executive of ITC agri-business, told The Telegraph. 

 The Choupal Fresh outlets will double up as wholesale stores as well. The stores will service wholesale customers small retailers, push cart vendors and institutions between 5 and 7 in the morning. For the rest of the day, it will service retail customers.

 As a result, the stores will be stand-alone shops and not be inside malls. 

 The terminal markets will be spread over 20 acres and the stores will have two halves a 3,000-5,000 square foot space for the customers and 7,000 square foot space to store the produce. 

 The project ushers in ITCs famed e-Choupal network in the state. The backward linkages for Choupal Fresh is the e-Choupal format. e-Choupal is a chain of computer kiosks in rural India from where the company buys as well as sells farm produce. 

 ITC will buy crops from the farmers and put them in end-to-end climate control facilities such as pre-coolers at farm, cold stores, ripening chambers and refrigerated transport.

 The partners for the cold chain infrastructure are Ingersoll Rand, which is a global leader in climate control technology, and Snowman, an associate of Mitsubishi and also a market leader in cold chain logistics.

 Sivakumar said the backward linkage processes in e-Choupal was unique to the companys operations in agri-retail, giving it an edge over its rivals. ITC will compete with RPG Enterprises Spencers and Reliance Retail in this segment.

 Spencers is planning seven stores in the city and one in Durgapur. Reliances ambitions are, however, much bigger and will not just be restricted to farm commodities as is with Choupal Fresh.

 The agri-retail market in the country is estimated at Rs 9.9 lakh crore and the organised retail business is expected to grow 10 times in the next five years to touch Rs 100,000 crore in 2011.

 Choupal Fresh will be ITCs first initiative into agri-retail in urban India. 

 The company had entered branded retail in cities through garment chains Wills Lifestyle and John Players.

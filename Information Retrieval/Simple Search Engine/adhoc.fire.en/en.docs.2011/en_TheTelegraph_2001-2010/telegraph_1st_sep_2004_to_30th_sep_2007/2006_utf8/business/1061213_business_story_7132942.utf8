 Nasdaq launches 2.7bn hostile bid for London bourse

 The chosen one

 London, Dec. 12 (Reuters): Nasdaq launched its 2.7-billion ($5.3 billion) hostile bid for the London Stock Exchange on Tuesday, needing just over a fifth of LSE shareholders to accept for it to take control of the bourse. 

 The US exchange is appealing directly to LSE investors with a 1,243-pence-per-share bid after being spurned twice in the past nine months by Europes biggest stock market. 

 Nasdaq Stock Markets, which already owns 28.75 per cent of LSE, has lowered the level of shareholders it needs to agree to its bid to 50 per cent, leaving just 21.3 per cent of LSE investors required to vote in favour before it can take control of the exchange. 

 The offer of 1,243p per ordinary share represents a full and fair value for LSE shareholders, taking into account both the successes of the business, but also the new competitive threats the LSE will face in 2007 and beyond, said Nasdaqs chief executive Robert Greifeld. 

 The US exchange said it was seeking acceptances from LSE shareholders by January 11. 

 The LSE reiterated its rejection of Nasdaqs bid. The board unanimously rejects Nasdaqs offer as it substantially undervalues the exchange and fails to reflect its unique strategic position and the powerful earnings and operational momentum of the business, it said in a statement. 

 Under the UK takeover code, Nasdaq can raise its offer under two conditions: if the LSE board recommends the bid to shareholders, or if a rival bidder comes forward. 

 No one should think that Nasdaq is so desperate that it will kill itself to take over the LSE, said a source familiar with the matter.

 Some analysts believe the LSE may be running out of options after British financial markets broker ICAP decided not to pursue fresh merger talks. 

 The New York Stock Exchanges owner NYSE Group Inc long considered a potential partner for the LSE is pursuing a merger with pan-European exchange Euronext, while the LSEs past suitors such as Deutsche Boerse, Australias Macquarie Bank and Euronext itself were all interested when LSE shares were trading at much lower levels. 

 Hedge fund investors, led by Samuel Heyman, have bought stakes in the UK exchange through the derivatives market at prices higher than Nasdaqs offer on speculation the bid will be sweetened. 

 Although some of these stakes are held through derivatives, such as contracts for difference (CFD), which do not have voting rights as ordinary shares do, it is relatively easy to turn the CFD into a voting share by paying the CFD seller a fee to buy the underlying stock. 

 The source familiar with the matter said that now the offer document was out, those hedge funds were likely to begin a dialogue with Nasdaq over its bid.

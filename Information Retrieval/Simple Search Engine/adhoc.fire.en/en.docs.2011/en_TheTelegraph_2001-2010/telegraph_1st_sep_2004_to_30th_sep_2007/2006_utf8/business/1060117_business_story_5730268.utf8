 RBI recipe for better governance

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Showing the way

 Mumbai, Jan. 16: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) today initiated a move to plug the growing conflicts of interest in Indias financial sector as banks and other financial intermediaries expand their businesses and venture into new areas.

 While releasing a 180-page discussion paper on conflict of interests in the financial sector, a group, set up by the central bank, asked the industry to suggest ways to deal with the dharma sankat that bankers and financial intermediaries now face.

 According to the group, conflict of interests, fundamentally, represents a dharma sankat ? an ethical dilemma ? and it arises in any situation in which an interest interferes, or has the potential to interfere, with a person, organisation or institutions ability to act in accordance with the interest of another party.

 The group examined the various situations where conflicts of interest arise and provided an integrated framework of forward-looking measures to mitigate and prevent such situations. 

 It suggested that in public sector enterprises, governance could be improved by transferring the actual functions from the administrative ministries concerned to the boards, specialised agencies (trusts and SPVs) formed for the purposes. Further, the appointment process of directors should be professionalised and streamlined, besides suitable rejig of the compensation and remuneration structures. 

 For the private sector, it recommended that control structures and disclosure practices should be consistent with the interests of all stake holders. It is often seen that in the private sector control is exercised through a complex pattern of cross-holdings involving subsidiaries, investment companies and others, with the added dimension of investments by institutions incorporated abroad. 

 Suggesting the development of a conflict management policy by each institution, it said the government had a crucial role in ensuring that the politico-judicial reforms are calibrated to meet the enhanced needs of an increasingly complex financial sector. 

 Suggesting that financial services are too crucial to be left solely in the hands of institutions and regulators, the group said an enlightened public are the best safeguard for ensuring non-exploitation of conflicts of interest by financial intermediaries.

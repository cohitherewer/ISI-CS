 Govt bets on rupee vigour

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 Money matters

 New Delhi, Aug. 3: The finance ministry expects the rupee to bounce back against the dollar. North Block officials feel the meltdown on the bourses is over and higher domestic interest rates will lure the greenback. They expect forex reserves to rise by $6 billion to $170 billion in the next three months. 

 Higher reserves prop up the rupee as it eases the search for cash to finance oil imports.

 The upbeat mood on the rupee is based on an analysis of currency trends by the government think-tank, the Institute of Economic Growth. 

 The institute has said: Although the narrowing interest rate differentials and high global oil prices have resulted in a marginal outflow of forex assets in June, the recent hike in policy interest rates by the RBI might lead to further accumulation of forex reserves in coming months. 

 The rupee, up 14 paise to 46.57 against the dollar today, is slowly gaining ground after plunging to a three-year low, easing concerns in the North Block, which broke into a sweat over depreciation losses of as much as Rs 3,500 crore on oil imports over and above the actual rise in the price of crude.

 In addition to flare-up in oil prices, the rupee was also scalded by the rising current account deficit which is slated to be at around 1.5 per cent of GDP this year. The lowering of the gap in interest rate with the US and expectations on hikes by the Fed have led to firms sucking out dollars from Asia in favour of the US. 

 The government had deliberately allowed the rupee to decline to help exporters to thwart competition from South East Asia and east Asia. However, the continuous fall is creating unease and a feeling that too much of a good thing is actually bad. 

 FIIs had cushioned the rupee from a fall for most of the last fiscal, but with bourses taking a tumble in recent months, they have turned sellers.

 Bourses attracted nearly $5 billion in net investment from FIIs between January and early May, but the amount has nearly halved since the meltdown. 

 Similarly, with oil prices rising, the dollar demand is expected to go up. The net result is that the rupee is expected to lose out further.

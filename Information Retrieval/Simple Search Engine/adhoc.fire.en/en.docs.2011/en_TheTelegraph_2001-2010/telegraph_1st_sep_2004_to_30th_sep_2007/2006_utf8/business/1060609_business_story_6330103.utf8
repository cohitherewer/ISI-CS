 Wipro to venture into Finland

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, June 8: Wipros hunger for acquisitions does not seem to have sated.

 Since December 2005, when it acquired Austria-based NewLogic for $56 million in cash, the company has acquired close to six small firms across different niche segments globally. 

 On Thursday, it acquired Saraware, a Finland-based wireless design services company. Wipro Technologies today announced that it has signed an agreement to acquire the Saraware Oy in an all-cash deal. The consideration of 25 million euros includes upfront cash payment and debt takeover. In addition, there are earn-outs on achieving targeted financial conditions over an 18-month period.

 Such acquisitions help Wipro as they add to its top line growth, said Rajeev Ramchandani, research analyst with Religare Securities.

 Lalu raps bosses for slow work

 Lalu Prasad: Means business

 New Delhi, Dec. 17: Railway minister Lalu Prasad has pulled up the general managers (GMs) of all railway divisions for executing projects slowly. 

 The minister has shot off a letter to the GMs pointing out that many major unloading terminals handling more than 10 rakes per month lack basic infrastructure facilities for full rake placement and round-the-clock working like appropriate illumination, full length platforms and access to roads.

 All such terminals should be upgraded in the next two years keeping in view the specific requirements of our customers in cement, steel, fertilisers and other industries, the letter states.

 The minister said till September 2006, only 23 per cent of the targeted expenditure has been incurred on traffic facility and this is not in consonance with our emphasis on low-cost, short gestation, rapid payback and high return works.

 Lalu Prasad has expressed concern over the fact that most major projects on broad gauge (BG) lines and traffic are running behind schedule. He said, Against the target of 2,600 km of BG lines and 228 traffic facility works, we have been able to complete only 310 km of BG lines and 23 traffic facility works till October 2006. 

 He said the bigger projects coming under the Eleventh Five-Year Plan would call for a paradigm shift in project execution through capacity building and empowerment of construction units in zonal railways as project implementation on this scale is far above our past achievements.

 His letter states that the size for the Eleventh Five-Year Plan (2007-12) may be four times higher than the tenth. With the increase in allocations and higher targets for the Eleventh Plan, we would have to do doubling (of railway lines) at the rate of 1000-1500 km, gauge conversion at the rate of 2,500 km and electrification at the rate of 600 km per annum.

 The minister has asked the GMs to personally monitor the progress of targets for the current year to ensure that projects are completed on time. 

 The minister said all ongoing traffic facility, gauge conversion and other last-mile works should be completed within two years. A three-year deadline has been set for completing doubling of railway lines, electrification and other projects. 

 According to the minister, funds are not likely to be a constraint for the completion of priority projects. 

 He has also asked GMs to identify and take timely measures to sort out possible bottlenecks like land acquisition and forest clearance for projects.

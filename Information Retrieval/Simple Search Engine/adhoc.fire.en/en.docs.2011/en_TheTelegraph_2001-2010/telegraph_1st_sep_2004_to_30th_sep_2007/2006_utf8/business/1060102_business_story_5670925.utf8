 Mobilisation shrinks in new-issue record

 CHANDRALEKHA TULAL

 Calcutta, Jan. 1: The bulls led the charge in the secondary market but in the primary section, where yields have been one of the highest in years, cash mobilised in 2005 has declined over the previous year.

 Total money raised from new issues ? called the primary market ? was 25 per cent less at Rs 22,753.64 crore compared with Rs 30,510.83 crore in 2004, according to the data released by equity research firm Prime Database. 

 However, the number of issues increased by 111.76 per cent to 72 compared with 34 in the previous year.

 The significant mobilisation in 2004 was mostly due to the huge PSU divestments, which have also resulted in large mop-up in 2005. However, in 2005 the PSU divestments in the pipeline did not come through, explained Prithvi Haldea, managing director, Prime Database. 

 In 2004, PSU divestments accounted for Rs 16,819 crore, while there was not a single such issue in 2005. Nevertheless, the capital mobilisation through public issues in 2005 remains the second highest in the history of the Indian capital market. 

 There are about 400 issues lined up for 2006 aiming to raise Rs 80,000 crore, said Haldea. However, all of them may not hit the stands during the year. We expect about 125-150 issues hitting the market in 2006 raising around Rs 40,000 crore, including PSU divestments, he added. 

 Also, era of small size issues are gone, he added. In 2005, there were only two issues below Rs 10 crore compared with five in the previous year.

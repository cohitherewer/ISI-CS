 Monday meet on tyre price

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 16: Union commerce minister Kamal Nath will meet tyre dealers on Monday to discuss complaints about arbitrary price hikes by domestic tyre manufacturers.

 Dealers have been complaining that tyre prices have risen 20-31 per cent over nine months, even as prices of natural rubber have come down from the peak level of Rs 115 per Kg to Rs 82 per Kg in the past two months.

 The All India Tyre Dealers Federation will seek a rollback of tyre prices to the level that prevailed in January this year.

 The federation will seek abolition 

 of 16 per cent countervailing duty (CVD) on import of tyres 

 and tubes to have a level playing field for tyres sold in 

 the domestic market. The domestic industry has a levy of 

 16 per cent excise duty, while imported tyres have 37.1 

 per cent multiple import duty, including 16 per cent CVD.

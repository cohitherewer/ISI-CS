 Calcutta, Feb. 28: Theyre women of the new millennium. Most are housewives, a few are employed, but the cause is common ? they want to understand the economy of a growing India, and to contribute to the country.

 Millennium Mams is the organisations name, empowering women is the aim.

 It was the unlikeliest bunch listening to the budget speech with rapt attention, jotting down notes. 

 For the third year in a row, the organisation has held a live viewing of the budget to a full house, comprising members as well as the women who are students of the course on economics and the capital market that Millennium Mams conducts.

 To set the right mood, a senior student of the course dressed as P. Chidambaram ? complete with crisp white veshti ? gave a short speech.

 For Neelu Agarwal, a first-year student of the two-year course, being able to talk knowledgeably is her greatest achievement. My husband is happy, because he can now talk to me about his work and I can follow what he says, she smiles.

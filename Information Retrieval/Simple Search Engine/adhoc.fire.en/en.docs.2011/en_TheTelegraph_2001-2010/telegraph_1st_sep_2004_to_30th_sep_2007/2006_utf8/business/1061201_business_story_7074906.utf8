 Rise and shine

 New Delhi, Nov. 30: India has once again reported the highest average salary increase in Asia at 13.8 per cent in the current year. And the good news is that the figure will vary between 12.3 per cent and 15 per cent for 2007.

 In contrast, salaries in China for the same period rose 8 per cent against 8.3 per cent last year. The Philippines saw an increase of 8.2 per cent, Singapore 4.6 per cent, Thailand 6.5 per cent and Malaysia 6.2 per cent.

 According to the seventh annual Asia-Pacific salary increase survey conducted by Hewitt Associates, the Asian markets have maintained a steady growth last year, which led to stabilisation of salary increases in most markets during the current year.

 Though employers are reporting pay increases, the hikes are modest in comparison to previous years. This trend is set to continue in 2007 as well.

 The findings about India revealed that none of the participating companies a total of 169 organisations were surveyed reported a salary freeze for the current year. The situation is expected to be the same next year.

 Employees at professional/ supervisor/ and at technical level received the highest average increase of 15 per cent and are expected to get so next year as well.

 The survey further states that at 19.5 per cent, senior and top managements have the highest percentage of variable pay in total cash compensation. This is expected to rise to 20.7 per cent next year.

 Around 31 per cent of the participating companies offered fixed bonuses to their employees this year. Stock options remained the most popular form of long-term incentive among participating companies. 

 While organisations are being driven to increase their spend on compensation as a result of the ongoing attraction and retention challenges, many companies are reassessing their human resource strategies and broader business goals to ensure they are getting the most out of their talent and increasing productivity, said Nishchae Suri, head of Hewitts Talent and Organisation Consulting Analytics practice in Asia. 

 Hewitt surveyed more than 1,400 foreign, locally owned and joint-venture companies covering 11 markets. These include India, China, Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, The Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand. 

 The study states that with the pressure to retain key talent growing, an increasing number of organisations are ensuring their pay is competitive by closely monitoring market movements.

 Bharti net rises 48% in first quarter

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 26: A robust growth in subscriber base and ongoing expansion of its network helped Bharti Airtel post a 48 per cent rise in net profit at Rs 755 crore for the first quarter ended June 30, 2006.

 Total revenue grew 53 per cent year-on-year at Rs 3,856 crore.

 The cellular service providers earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) margin rose to 39 per cent in the June quarter, up from 37.4 per cent in the same quarter last year. Ebitda stood at Rs 1,502 crore, up 60 per cent year-on-year. 

 Chief financial officer Akhil Gupta attributed the rise in margins to economies of scale and expansion of Bhartis networks. Higher Ebitda margins give a strong picture of the company at its operating level. 

 We have to live with price pressure. However, with the economies of scale, expansion of networks and new circles giving us better results, we expect to improve margins in the next quarter, he added. 

 Mobile telephony, with a 11-million subscriber base in June, continues to spearhead the countrys growth in telecom.

 The company has started the new financial year well with strong operational and financial performance under the new management structure. We are confident that the growth momentum will be sustained going forward, he added. 

 Bharti Axa plans

 Bharti Axa Life Insurance Co, the 74:26 insurance joint venture between Sunil Mittals Bharti Group and global insurance major Axa, is planning to begin operations next month.

 We have received a licence for our insurance venture from the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) recently and plan to go for a soft launch in August, said Rajan Mittal, joint managing director, Bharti Group.

 However, the company is still awaiting the regulators approval for its products.

 Bharti Axa plans to invest around Rs 500 crore in the initial 3-4 years of operation.

 In India, the joint venture will leverage on Bharti Airtels distribution network and Axas expertise in global insurance.

 Axa, with more than $1 trillion funds under management worldwide, has 10 years of experience in India through its business process outsourcing units in Pune and Bangalore.

 Bharti is the second telecom company after Reliance to foray into the insurance business. However, both life and general insurance businesses of Reliance do not have a foreign equity partner. At present, foreign equity stake in domestic insurance companies is capped at 26 per cent.

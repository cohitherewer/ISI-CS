 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, March 13: Its 

 the shimmering, fresh, exquisite Green Kiwi colour thats 

 going to be all around you in 2006. Well, thats what 

 ICI Dulux paints ColourFutures 2006 has predicted.

 Its this colour, which is likely to define international interior designing trends for this year. 

 We have come up with these results after a world-wide colour trend research done by our global ColourFutures expert team, who are also actively involved in paint formulation and art and science of colours, said ICI Dulux global marketing head Nicky Burton. 

 ICI had launched the concept of ColourFutures in 2003. 

 The company invests about a million dollars in the research and development of the ColourFutures concept, which helps it forecast the international colour trends in paints every year.

 In India, ICI has a market share between 12 and 13 per cent in paints. 

 The company has reported a turnover of Rs 567 crore in 2004-05 and a net profit of Rs 32 crore. 

 We have been reporting an 18 per cent growth rate every quarter for three years and we expect to do that this fiscal too, said Hina Nagarajan, general manager of ICI India Ltd. 

 The company will show case its report card for 2005-06 on March 31. 

 In India, ICI has three manufacturing units in Mumbai, Hyderabad and Mohali. 

 As part of its growth strategy, ICI India is not looking at increasing investments but focusing on debottlenecking the capacity, increasing channel partners, improving technology and offering better quality services and solution to customers, Nagarajan said. 

 It also rolled out the new Fanbook with 2016 colour shades that will help customers choose colour schemes easily.

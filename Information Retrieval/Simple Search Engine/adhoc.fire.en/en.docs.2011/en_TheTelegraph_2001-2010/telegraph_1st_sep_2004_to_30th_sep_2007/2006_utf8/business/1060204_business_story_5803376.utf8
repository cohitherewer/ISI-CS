 Mumbai, Feb. 3: Siemens Ltd is setting up a greenfield industrial steam turbine factory at Vadodara in Gujarat at an investment of Rs 30 crore. 

 ?We are setting up this plant to manufacture industrial steam turbines up to 45 mega-watt. All the components of these turbines will also be manufactured at this facility,? said J. Schubert, managing director, Siemens Limited. 

 The plant will manufacture key components for steam turbine up to 150 mw. ?This will enable us to close our portfolio gap in the small turbine segment. The plant is expected to go on stream by December 2006,? Schubert added. 

 ?The plant will cater to the domestic market of steel turbines of below 150 mw. It will also supply turbine components to Siemens? manufacturing facilities abroad,? he said. The project would provide direct employment to about 220 persons. 

 ?This is the plan for the first phase. In the second phase, we may double the capacity and plan other areas of expansion. Currently, the plant will manufacture an average of 30-40 machines annually depending upon the capacities of the turbines,? Schubert mentioned. 

 Siemens expects an average annual business of Rs 500 crore over the next three years. 

 The total market size for industrial turbines in the country is around Rs 1,200-1,400 crore at present. 

 The board of Siemens Limited has recently approved the company?s stock split in the ratio of 1:5, whereby each equity share having a face value of Rs 10 will be split into five shares of Rs 2 each. 

 The board has also approved a proposal to acquire a 50 per cent stake in Flender Limited, a joint venture between Flender AG and Babcock Borsig India Limited. 

 For the first quarter ended December 2005, Siemens has recorded a 56 per cent jump in after-tax profit at Rs 49 crore versus Rs 31.4 crore in the same period last fiscal. 

 The sales turnover of the company increased by 69 per cent to Rs 851.1 crore from Rs 503.1 crore in the previous corresponding period. 

 The company has bagged new orders worth Rs 4,162.3 crore during the reporting quarter compared with Rs 817.1 crore in the year-ago period.

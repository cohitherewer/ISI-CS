 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 15: The cabinet today cleared the introduction of a bill seeking limited amendments to the companies act to enable the implementation of the e-governance project.

 Code-MCA 21, the project seeks to provide public and corporate entities and others easy and secure online access to company affairs services, including filing of documents and public access to corporate information, required to be in the public domain under the statute, at any time and from anywhere.

 This would result in efficiency in provision of professional services and statutory supervision of corporate processes through the use of modern information technology and computers 

 The amendment bill ? Companies (amendment) Bill, 2006 ? will be introduced in the coming session of Parliament. Some of the major changes envisaged through the proposed bill are allotment of director identification number (DIN) to any individual intending to be appointed as a director of a company. 

 The amendments, once passed, would ensure secure e-filing and authentication.

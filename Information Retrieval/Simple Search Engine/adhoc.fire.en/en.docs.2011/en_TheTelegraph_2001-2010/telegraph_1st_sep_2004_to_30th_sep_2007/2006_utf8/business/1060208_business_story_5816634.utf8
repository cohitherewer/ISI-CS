 Windfall for MTNL 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 7: Mahanagar Telephone Nigam (MTNL) will soon reap a windfall as the income tax department has been asked to return a whopping Rs 1,233 crore to the public sector telecom company. The Income Tax Appellate Tribunal has ruled in MTNLs favour in a tax refund case.

 MTNL could use the money to meet all its investments, especially its proposed expansion of GSM operations.

 The income tax appellate tribunal has directed the income tax department to refund to MTNL Rs 956 crore as tax and Rs 277 as interest on it, MTNL director Anita Soni said. The company had been pursuing a fierce battle against the income tax department before the appellate tribunal on allowing licence fee as an expense for running the business, as MTNL cannot provide telecom services without paying fee for the licence.

 MTNLs net profit last year stood at Rs 940 crore and the figure for the first nine months in the current financial year was Rs 480 crore. Refund of Rs 1,233 crore would give the company a major boost, Soni said.

 Asked when the refund was expected and how it would be utilised, Soni said, We expect to get the amount in the current financial year.

 As far as utilisation is concerned, I am looking at various options... We have 16.3 lakh GSM subscribers and the segment is expanding very fast and requires lots of funds, Soni added. 

 Soni said the logic of treating licence fee as a business expense has been accepted by income tax authorities for all telecom operators as well as for BSNL, but the same was denied only to MTNL. The tribunal while passing a consolidated order for four assessment years (1998-99, 1999-00, 2000-01 and 2002-03) held licence fee as allowable business expenditure under section 37 of the Income Tax Act.

 MTNL was the only operator which was not allowed to treat licence fee as an expense whereas all other private players have been doing so, Soni said.

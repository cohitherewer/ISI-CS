 Calcutta, Sept. 13: LG Electronics India is targeting a turnover of Rs 9,000 crore this year, including an export revenue of $350 million.

 We have started commercial production of optical storage devices, such as DVD writers and CD writers, from our Pune facility two months ago to cater primarily to the export market. The Pune plant is currently producing one million units per month. We expect these products to contribute a major part of our export revenue this year itself, said LGEIL vice- president (marketing) Girish Rao while launching five LCD and plasma televisions here today. 

 The colour television models are priced between Rs 29,990 and Rs 20 lakh.

 According to him, the Korean parent of the consumer electronics manufacturer is also keen to develop the Pune facility as the export hub for optical storage devices.

 The company will focus on flat panel TV sales. LGEIL has clocked a revenue of Rs 31 crore from flat panel TV sales last year. It aims to achieve a turnover of Rs 150 crore this year. 

 Our focus this year will be to consolidate in the flat panel television segment where we have a 34 per cent market share after Samsung (40 per cent), LGEIL consumer electronics business head Amitabh Tiwari said. 

 The Indian flat panel TV market is estimated to grow to 2,90,000 units in 2007 from 1,50,000 now. LGEIL sells about 4,500 units at present. 

 The company is also planning to introduce six to seven GSM handset models this year, taking its total portfolio to 12 to 13 models. 

 As of now, it imports semi-knocked down GSM handsets from Korea and assembles them at its Pune facility. We have a software development centre, called LG Soft, in Bangalore for mobile handsets, Rao said.

 LGEIL is in talks with GSM telecom service providers to sell its handsets. 

 We are in talks with Hutch and Idea. In Delhi, we have signed up Airtel to sell our handsets to its prospective customers, Rao said. 

 He added that LG supplies 5 million CDMA handsets to Reliance Telecom and Tata Telecom. 

 These handsets are completely imported from Korea. 

 LG Korea plans to manufacture CDMA handsets here after the volume goes up. At present, CDMA handset sales are on contract basis and hence bulk shipments of a predetermined quantity of handsets from Korea are more economical for the company than manufacturing them here. However, once CDMA users are allowed to change their handsets from the open market, it will be a different equation, Rao said.

 He also said LGEIL plans to introduce home theatres and portable music storage systems and move away from regular audio products business.

 Govt puts June date for Iran pipeline

 Srinivasan: Hopeful

 Mumbai, April 30 (PTI): The government today said it expects to sign the final agreement for the $7.4-billion Iran-Pakistan-India gas pipeline project by June at a ministerial meeting in Tehran.

 The Iranian deputy oil minister is visiting New Delhi tomorrow. Many issues related with the drafting of the agreement will be discussed during his meeting with the petroleum minister, petroleum secretary M.S. Srinivasan told reporters here.

 He said technical experts from the three countries are meeting in the third week of May for finalising a framework agreement on the implementation of the gas pipeline project, which would be later signed in Tehran. Iranian deputy oil minister Mohammad Hadi Nejad Hosseinian, who is now in Pakistan, held talks with Pakistani petroleum secretary Ahmad Waqar on the project yesterday.

 Hosseinian, who had asked Pakistan to push the project for an early implementation, discussed a pricing formula and technical details with Waqar. About the implementation of the project, Srinivasan said the government expects to start work on the project within a span of six to nine months after all stakeholders sign the draft agreement.

 The 2,670-km pipeline will cover around 1,115 km in Iran, 705 km in Pakistan and 850 km in India.

 UN sanction

 The proposed gas pipeline will not be affected if the United Nations imposes sanctions on Tehran over its controversial nuclear programme, Hosseinian said.

 I dont think anybody could put sanctions on the oil and gas industry, Hosseinian told a press conference in Islamabad today after three days of talks on the project.

 Due to the sensitivity of the oil market, any action like that will raise the oil prices and I believe the UN or any other body will not put any sanction on oil or the oil industry, Hosseinian said when asked about the future of the project if sanctions were imposed.

 The 2,600-km pipeline from Irans southern Pars field is estimated to cost more than $7 billion. Talks between India, Iran and Pakistan on the project ended in March in Tehran without any agreement.

 The US objects to the project and is pushing for another pipeline to south Asian countries from Turkmenistan via Afghanistan.

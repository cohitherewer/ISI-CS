 Indian Bank issue in January

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Oct. 16: The Chennai-based Indian Bank is all set to tap the capital market in January with a public issue of 8.9 crore shares.

 A merchant banker for the initial public offering will be appointed by the month-end. We have a board meeting on October 30 and the appointment of the merchant banker could be announced then, K.C. Chakrabarty, chairman and managing director of Indian Bank, said here today.

 According to our plan, the IPO will hit the market sometime in January. We need at least three months to prepare and file the draft red herring prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Board of India and get its approval, he added.

 Last month, the public sector bank converted Rs 400 crore of its Rs 743.82 crore paid-up capital into non-cumulative preference shares and gave it back to the government at a coupon rate of 8 per cent per annum. Following this capital restructuring, the banks paid-up capital now stands at Rs 343.82 crore, which is entirely owned by the government.

 We are looking at diluting a 25 per cent stake through the public issue. This is about 8.9 crore shares, Chakrabarty said. After the issue, the governments stake in the bank will come down to 75 per cent. 

 In March, the Union cabinet wrote off the accumulated losses of three public sector banks United Bank of India, Indian Bank and Central Bank against their respective equity capital. Last month, it approved the capital restructuring and public issue plans of Indian Bank and Central Bank, while that of city-based United Bank of India is still awaiting a go-ahead.

 However, Central Bank has not yet disclosed its IPO plan. But industry experts believe that Central Bank may also hit the capital market early next year. 

 Meanwhile, Indian Bank today signed an MoU with Oriental Bank of Commerce, Corporation Bank and India Infrastructure Finance Company Ltd for jointly financing infrastructure projects. This is an extension of the arrangement we had entered into for sharing each others infrastructure for growth, Chakrabarty said.

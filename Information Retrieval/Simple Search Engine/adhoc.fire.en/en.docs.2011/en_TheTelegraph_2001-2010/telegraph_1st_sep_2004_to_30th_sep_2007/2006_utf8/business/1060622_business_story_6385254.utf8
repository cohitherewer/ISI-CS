 Fair value half the Jet offer

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, June 21: Brokerages are putting the fair value of Air Sahara in a range between $200 million and $250 million ? which is at about half the price Jet Airways bid for the airline in January.

 Looking at the operations of Air Sahara, their valuation should be on a par with Deccan Aviation and, thus, we feel it should be around $200 to 250 million, said Nikhil Garg, aviation sector analyst with Edelweiss Capital. 

 The valuation is also far lower than the $400-million bid that Kingfisher Airlines had made over six months ago.

 Last year, when the Roys decided to put the airline on the block, Ernst and Young had estimated its value at between $750 million and $1 billion.

 To be fair, the consultancies and the brokerages use different methodologies to determine the enterprise valuation and these are not strictly comparable. But such a huge disparity between the numbers raises questions about the true value of the airline just when Jet Airways appears to try and extricate itself from an unhappy deal.

 The breakdown of the deal will positively affect the valuations of Jet Airways, but Air Sahara will run into rough weather, says Garg. 

 At this juncture, the options available to Air Sahara would be to scout for another possible taker or to raise finance. While the only other taker would be Kingfisher Airlines, it will also be difficult for the company to raise money, said Garg. 

 The high acquisition price would have adversely affected Jets balance sheet and funding plans for organic capital expenditure. If the deal falls through, it will act as a positive trigger for the Jet Airways stock since the value reported to be paid was highly inflated. 

 Sahara has been losing Rs 100 crore per month since March. It lost Rs 220 crore in 2006, said SSKI, another brokerage. 

 If talks fail, we think it is positive for Jet as airline valuations have shrunk across the region. Jet trades at six times the fiscal 2007 earnings, in line with regional airlines, attractive at these levels and offers downside protection given the higher growth in India, said another leading brokerage house. 

 JP Morgan had recently cut the price target for Jet Airways. As the scrip recently reached our previous price target of Rs 750, we now set a new June 2007 price target of Rs 550. We expect the stock to move lower on further multiple contraction for the industry as excessive discounting and high oil prices continue to pressure earnings for the sector, said the valuation report.

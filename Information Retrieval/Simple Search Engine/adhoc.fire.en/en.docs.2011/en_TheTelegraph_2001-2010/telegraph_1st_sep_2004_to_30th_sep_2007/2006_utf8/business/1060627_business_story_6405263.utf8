 J amp;J buys Pfizer unit for $16.6 bn

 Pop goes the pill

 June 26 (Agencies): Johnson amp; Johnson (J amp;J) today agreed to buy Pfizer Incs consumer healthcare business for $16.6 billion in cash to increase its lead in the market for non-prescription health products. 

 The agreement completes a review of the strategic options Pfizer initiated in February for the unit, whose brands include Listerine mouthwash, Sudafed decongestant and Nicorette smoking cessation products. 

 People familiar with the situation said J amp;Js offer topped rival bids from British groups GlaxoSmithKline and Reckitt Benckiser. 

 But the price was higher than the analysts had expected, and J amp;J shares fell 2.2 per cent to $60 in pre-market dealings on the Inet electronic brokerage system. 

 The deal will consolidate J amp;Js position as the worlds largest supplier of consumer healthcare and over-the-counter medicines. J amp;Js existing brands include painkiller Tylenol, Neutrogena skin products and Johnsons baby shampoo. 

 Pfizers India subsidiary said it was evaluating the impact of the sale of global consumer healthcare business by its parent to Johnson and Johnson.

 At the moment we are in the process of evaluating how the deal would impact operations in India, a Pfizer India spokesperson said.

 J amp;J predicted the deal would boost earnings per share on a cash basis in 2009 as it takes advantage of big opportunities to leverage the sales, administration and supply chain of both organisations. 

 Pfizer said it expected to repurchase up to $7 billion of its common stock in 2006 and up to $10 billion in 2007 so that the Pfizer Consumer Healthcare (PCH) divestiture would not hurt earnings in 2007 and would add to them in 2008. 

 The worlds biggest drugmaker will have to pay tax on the disposal and expects to book around $13.5 billion in after-tax proceeds. The deal is expected to close by the year-end. 

 Industry sources said Johnson amp; Johnson had been anxious to win the sale, especially after losing out in January to Boston Scientific Corp in the battle for medical devices group Guidant Corp. 

 The price tag of $16.6 billion equates to nearly 4.3 times last years PCH sales of $3.9 billion, a rich valuation compared with past deals in the sector. 

 Reckitt paid 3.6 times sales for Boots Healthcare International last year, while Bayer AG paid 2.4 times sales for Roche Holdings AGs consumer health unit in 2004. 

 If you are in consumer health, you have to make acquisitions like this, said Paul Diggle, an industry analyst at stockbroker Nomura Code in London, pointing to the benefits from economies of scale. 

 Shares in Reckitt rose 1.8 per cent by mid-session in London on relief it would not embark on a deal that would have stretched it financially, while Glaxo eased 0.4 per cent in a flat overall London market. 

 J amp;J chief executive William Weldon said the sector offered good growth prospects in markets around the world.

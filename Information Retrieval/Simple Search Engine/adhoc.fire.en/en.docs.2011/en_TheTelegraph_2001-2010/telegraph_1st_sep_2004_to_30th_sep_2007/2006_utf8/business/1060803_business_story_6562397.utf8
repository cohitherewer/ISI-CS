 SAP to spend $1 bn on upgrade

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Aug. 2 : German software maker SAP today unveiled a $1-billion investment plan to expand its operations in India over the next five years. Around 30 million euros ($38.4 million) has been earmarked for research and development facilities. SAP will also increase its headcount in India from 2,750 to 3,500 by the year-end. It plans to have a 5,500-strong workforce in five years.

 SAP chief executive Henning Kagermann said at a news conference that India continues to grow in its importance as one of our top eight strategic markets and now a strategic hub in the region. We are seeing a phenomenal growth in demand for our solutions from Indian enterprises.

 SAP, based in the German town of Walldorf, has been in India for more than a decade. It has invested $500 million and has more than 1,000 clients here. It aims to raise its customer base to 15,000 by 2010.

 By the end of 2006, India is expected to account for 20 per cent of the firms global research and product development as well as its services and support business.

 SAP employs more than 34,000 staff globally with an almost equal number of customers in 120 countries. Earlier in July, SAP reported weaker-than-expected second-quarter results, which were blamed on delayed deals and accounting technicalities that meant some orders could not translate into revenue.

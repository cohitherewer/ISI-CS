 Chrysler cost cut

 Beijing, Nov. 18 (Reuters): The head of the Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler said on Saturday the company will target cost cuts of $1,000 per vehicle through increased outsourcing outside of North America and other savings. 

 We are willing to import, with the focus on being competitive, Chrysler head Tom LaSorda said at the Beijing International Automotive Exhibition. 

 He said over the next six to 12 months, the company would identify cost reductions averaging $1,000 per vehicle, with part of that coming from outsourcing. 

 He did not specify where the outsourcing would be done, saying, We are going to source where we can get good low-cost components and high quality.

 Calcutta, July 30: MCA-21, the pet project of the ministry of company affairs, was launched all across the country today, except Jammu.

 MCA-21 will be launched in Jammu next week. From August, all the 20 offices of the Registrar of Companies will go live on MCA-21, Union company affairs minister Prem Chand Gupta said while launching the Rs 345-crore project in Bengal. 

 Bengal was slated to plug into the MCA-21 platform in March. However, due to some technical problems, as well as assembly elections in a few states, including Bengal, it was held back for a while.

 MCA-21 will not only dispense with the paper-based documentation and physical interaction with MCA offices, it will also reduce the time taken for setting up an industry, Gupta said.

 TCS is implementing the project under a public-private-partnership and on build-own-operate-transfer mode.

 Rahas missive stokes the slow-burning ONGC fire

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 29: Subir Raha didnt go down without a fight. 

 As the nerve-wracking countdown began to his last day in office and hopes of an extension of his tenure started to recede, the former chairman of the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) fired off a letter to petroleum minister Murli Deora making an impassioned plea to give him a hearing to clear the air over a barrage of insinuations and adverse comments that his biggest bugbear ? former petroleum secretary S.C. Tripathi ? had made against him.

 Raha didnt eventually get that opportunity to clear the air because the letter that he wrote on May 23, the penultimate day of his term in office, wasnt delivered to the petroleum ministers office until May 25, a day after his tenure expired.

 In his letter to Deora, Raha says, In the interest of fair play and justice, any assessment of ONGC and/or any appraisal of C amp;MD ONGC by them needs to be seen as prejudiced and personalised... you be the judge.

 Raha slams Tripathi for authorising several illegal and biased actions during the latters one-and-a-half-year tenure ending on December 31, 2005.

 Raha tried to buttress his argument that the bureaucrats in the petroleum ministry were deeply prejudiced against him by recalling the abortive move to appoint additional directors on the board of directors of ONGC flouting existing norms. Raha was able to thwart the move that was seen as an attempt to severely restrict his authority. 

 He said Tripathi pushed for the appointment of two additional government directors, on top of the three already present, on the ONGC board in violation of listing agreement/corporate governance and insisted on nominating the director general for hydrocarbons (DGH), the sector regulator, on the board in unquestionable conflict of interest.

 He also blamed Tripathi for the delay in signing the annual performance memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the ministry. The bureaucrats in the ministry had charged Raha with dithering on the issue.

 Raha charged Tripathi with trying to intimidate him in order to comply with these orders, especially the nomination of the DGH. 

 The former ONGC boss could not be contacted for his comments on the latest twist in the raging controversy surrounding the company.

 Calcutta, Feb. 9: The Coal India management is in favour of diluting around 5 per cent equity in the market to raise about Rs 3,000 crore.

 CIL chairman Shashi Kumar said the company felt this was the right time to hit the market if the government gave its nod.

 ?We have a triple A rating from Crisil. Moreover, the finances are in good shape,? Kumar said adding that he had written to the government in this regard.

 He said the final decision was to be taken by the government, which owned the company. 

 ?We think this is the right time (IPO) if it (government) at all considers a partial stake dilution,? Kumar said on the sidelines of a seminar on coal in Calcutta organised by Coaljunction.

 This year the company has managed to turn around all its subsidiaries, including the perennially loss-making Eastern Coalfields Limited (ECL). Coal India has nine wholly-owned subsidiaries.

 The other loss-making unit, Bharat Coking Coal Ltd, also turned around this fiscal.

 Kumar said raising Rs 3,000 crore, which almost works out to an offer price of Rs 100 a share, was possible given its strong fundamentals. It has an equity base of Rs 6,315 crore. Coal India is expected to close the year with a revenue of Rs 32,000 crore and over Rs 5,000-crore profit. The production would stand at about 345 million tonnes.

 Coal Videsh

 Kumar said Coal Videsh would be a division under Coal India for the time being even though there was a proposal to create a separate corporate entity under the model of ONGC Videsh Ltd. ?The proposal is under active consideration of the government,? he said.

 The company is scouting for opportunities abroad. It has identified a property in Zimbabwe.

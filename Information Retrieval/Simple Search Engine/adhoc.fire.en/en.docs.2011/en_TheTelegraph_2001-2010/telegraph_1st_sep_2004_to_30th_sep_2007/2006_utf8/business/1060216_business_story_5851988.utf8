 Supply crunch hits tea auction

 SOHINI MOOKHERJEA

 Trying times

 Calcutta, Feb. 15: Three North Indian tea auction centres in Calcutta, Siliguri and Guwahati will not hold auctions in February and March as the supply from North India has depleted and the centres have nothing to carry forward in the new season. 

 The Indian tea market is also starting to feel the effects of a global shortage in production. 

 The South Indian markets show an upward trend in prices with a dramatic increase every week. The bottom of the market has doubled itself in terms of pricing in the last four weeks. 

 North India, which is awaiting the cropping season in March, is also expected to receive strong demand at buoyant price levels. 

 In Sri Lanka, prices are also moving upwards. Droughts in Kenya and Malawi and dry spells in Tanzania and Uganda could result in a major shortfall with a world spot shortage in the CTC market. 

 India, according to major tea auctioneering companies like Carritt Moran and J Thomas, is set to become the direct beneficiary of such an effect. 

 January to March are among the three highest cropping months, which have been experiencing a dry spell globally and the effect is unlikely to rectify itself for the greater part of the year. 

 The Indian tea market is likely to emerge from years of depression with prices seeing more than a correction, aver auction houses like J Thomas and Carritt Moran. 

 The average auction price for 2005 closing was between Rs 58 and Rs 59 per kg. 

 Some industry experts say the price correction could revert back to the peak period of 1998-1999 when Kenya had experienced a similar drought, which had resulted in a shortfall of 45 million kg. 

 The current Kenyan crisis is expected to result in a shortfall of 30 to 40 million kg. 

 The average closing price for 1999 was Rs 78, which had been steadily declining over the years. 

 The new season, which starts off in April 2006, should start on a stronger note, auction houses said.

 Small tea growers eat into share of big units

 SOHINI MOOKHERJEA

 Calcutta, Oct. 1: Small tea growers, who fall short on quality and labour welfare, are mushrooming in north India at the expense of plantations. 

 In north India, total production in the organised sector fell to 530 million kg in 2004 from 641 million kg in 1998. Production in bought leaf factories and small co-operatives, the domain of the small growers, however, increased 28 per cent to 131 million kg from 30 million kg during the period.

 Small growers contribute around 21 per cent to the countrys production. 

 In south India, too, production in the organised sector during this period declined to 132 million kg from 142 million kg, while output of small growers at BLFs and co-operatives was up to 99 million kg from 61 million kg. In south India, small growers and BLFs have been gradually growing over the years, while the north has witnessed a spurt from 1993-94. Recognising the employment potential, we are trying to popularise a host of initiatives to upgrade small growers and make them more economically viable, Tea Board chairman Basudeb Banerjee said.

 In 2004, small growers in north India with holdings of up to 10.12 hectares owned 59,368 estates over an area of 61,999 hectares compared with 1,962 estates over 3,138 hectares in 1994. In south India, there were 31,534 small growers owning 21,996 hectares in 1994 which increased to 67,998 estates and 48,788 hectares in 2004.

 The problem of small growers was discussed at the recent AGM of the Indian Tea Association (ITA). 

 ITA chairman Percy Siganporia said the plantations were finding it difficult to compete with small growers who can offer cheap tea since they are not encumbered by regulations and social obligations.

 Companies such as Tata Tea encourage small growers by helping them upgrade their produce and offering fair prices. 

 Small growers foster local employment and entrepreneurship. We are setting up cooperative processing factories and helping them with skill upgradation, which will lead to better products and a bigger market, said Jairam Ramesh, minister of state for commerce and industry.

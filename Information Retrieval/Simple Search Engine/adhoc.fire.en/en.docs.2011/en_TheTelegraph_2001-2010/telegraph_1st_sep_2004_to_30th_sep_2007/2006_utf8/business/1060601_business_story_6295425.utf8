 Its not end of the road for jute

 AMIT CHAKRABORTY

 Ghatal (Paschim Medinipur), May 31: A pilot project that started here today to use jute cloth in rural road construction could turn out to be a multi-crore business for the ailing industry.

 Experts said use of this non-conventional material ? called jute geo-textile in technical parlance ? could save Rs 72,000 per km while constructing rural roads.

 The Jute Manufactures Development Council (JMDC) is looking at bagging orders worth Rs 6,000 crore for using jute geo-textile under the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY). This is just about 10 per cent of the Rs 60,000-crore earmarked for PMGSY over the next 10 years.

 Under the pilot project, bituminous jute cloth will be used on 4.8 km of the Natuk-Dingal road, a highly flood prone area in Ghatal subdivision. Senior officials from the Union rural development ministry and Central Road Research Institute (CRRI) were present when the project was flagged off.

 JMDC secretary Arun Bal said the project could cut road construction cost to a large extent and rake in revenues for the jute industry.

 According to Bal, jute geo-textile has been used to build many rural and semi-urban roads. But no technical evaluation was done on these projects. The material is now being used in a pilot project following a presentation by the JMDC before the rural development ministry, he said.

 To standardise road-specific application of jute geo-textile under the PMGSY, ten pilot projects have been taken up in five states for 47.84 km. The rural development ministry has agreed to provide Rs 17.83 crore for two roads each in five states ? Assam, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa and Bengal. The other project in Bengal is located in Hooghly district.

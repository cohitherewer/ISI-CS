 UBS buys ADB stake in IDFC for Rs 269 cr

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Sept. 13: Asian Development Bank (ADB) has exited the Infrastructure Development and Finance Corporation (IDFC). The Manila-based bank today sold its holdings in IDFC to UBS Securities Asia for Rs 269 crore.

 ADB sold 4.27 crore shares, constituting 3.8 per cent of IDFCs equity, in a block deal struck on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) at a price of Rs 63 per share. 

 Data available from the BSE showed that UBS has picked up another 10.69 lakh shares of IDFC. However, the identity of the seller could not be established.

 This is the second major block deal in the IDFC counter in recent weeks. On August 18, Goldman Sachs picked up less than a 4 per cent stake in IDFC when ICICI Bank sold its entire 4.20 crore shares for Rs 60 per share. The transaction was worth Rs 252 crore. 

 The other major shareholders in IDFC, which finances large projects such as roads, power, ports and bridges, include State Bank of India and International Finance Corporation. 

 The Union government is the largest shareholder with a 23.29 per cent holding, though the company is run by professionals. For the period ended June 30 this year, the other entities which held shares in IDFC included CDC Investment Holdings Ltd, IDBI, Morgan Stanley, HSBC and others.

IDFC was recently in the news when it announced that 

an amount of up to Rs 35 crore will be invested by way of equity in United Western 

Bank Limited (UWB). The investment was to be made by IDFC, along with HDFC and 

its subsidiaries/associates, Sicom and the Maharashtra government. This proposal 

was, however, not accepted by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), which selected 

IDBI as the bank to run UWB.

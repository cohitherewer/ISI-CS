 New Delhi, Nov. 17: The government will provide a favourable tax regime to fuel growth in IT hardware manufacturing.

 Our ministry has been proactively supporting the growth of IT and ITeS firms through positive changes in the tax regime. We have appealed to the finance ministry to extend the current tax holiday enjoyed by units registered with the Software Technology Parks of India (STPI) beyond March 2009, said IT and communications minister Dayanidhi Maran.

 According to the minister, such tax incentives would strengthen the IT hardware manufacturing industry, making it globally competitive and attracting more foreign direct investment.

 The country has generated about Rs 38,640 crore export revenues in ITeS in 2005-06, which is almost four times that generated in 2001-02, said Maran.

 According to industry analysts, the global IT and ITeS segment is estimated to reach $3,400 billion by 2012, he said. 

 An extension of the tax holiday could make STP schemes more attractive than SEZs as the parks will enjoy 100 per cent tax holidays for 10 years. SEZs, however, enjoy 100 per cent tax holidays on exports only for five years.

 The minister also said infotech needs to be used as a powerful tool to spread literacy, to convert normal governance to smart governance and to provide employment to millions of people through various IT amp; ITeS businesses.

 Speaking at the inauguration of Dells fourth customer contact centre in Gurgaon, Maran urged Dell India to play an active role to fuel the IT revolution in the country.

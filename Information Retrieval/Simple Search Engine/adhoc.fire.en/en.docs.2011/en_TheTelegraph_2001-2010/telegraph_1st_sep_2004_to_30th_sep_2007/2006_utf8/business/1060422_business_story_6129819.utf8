 Calcutta port feels Nepal heat

 AMIT CHAKRABORTY

 Calcutta, April 21: The political turmoil in Nepal is having a spinoff effect on the operations at the Calcutta port.

 For the last two weeks, about 160 Nepal-bound containers at the Calcutta port are waiting to be despatched. If tension continues in the Himalayan kingdom, it may soon become impossible for the Calcutta terminal to handle the containers. 

 Being a land-locked country, Nepals import from the international market are routed through the Calcutta port.

 The Container Corporation of India (Concor) has a dedicated fleet of three rakes for ferrying containers to Nepal. The public sector company has now been forced to divert two of these rakes for carrying local goods.

 When contacted by The Telegraph, Nepalese consul general Gobind Prasad Kusum said he was aware of the issues and had contacted the Calcutta port authorities. There was hardly any major complaint, he added.

 On the Indian side there are three points through which goods enter Nepal. They are, Naxalbari, Raxaul and Jogabani.

 According to I.K. Ghosh, a leading clearing agent serving Nepalese clients, Indian authorities had virtually made the sensitive Naxalbari check post non-functional. For the last two weeks, no cargo had been sent from this point. The cargo from Naxalbari enters Nepal through Kakrabitta on the other side. A large number of trucks had been stranded on the Indian side because of the stalemate, Ghosh said.

 At Raxaul, unloading of cargo is taking place according to the sweet wish of the Nepalese importers. The cargo from Raxaul find its way into Nepal through the Birganj border.

 The situation is no better at the Jogabani checkpost in Bihar. This is the point from where containers are despatched to Nepals Biratnagar, one of the largest industrial hub of that country.

 The Jogabani border, according to Ghosh, is choked with trucks carrying containers from the Calcutta port.

 Ajay Behera, who is Concors general manager for the eastern region, said the warehouse of the companys agent, Himalaya Terminal Private Ltd, at Birganj in Nepal was full and was unable to unload any more cargo from the containers.

 According to Ghosh, Nepalese importers have failed to make any payment for the last two weeks. This has also put us off, Ghosh said.

 Concor operates a fleet of three rakes to ferry goods to Nepal. Each rake can carry 70 to 80 containers. Each container has a carrying capacity of 20 tonnes. While one rake is held up at the Nepal border two rakes had been diverted for domestic use, Behera said.

 According to Gautam Gupta, who is the container terminal manager at the Calcutta port, average monthly despatch to Nepal was between 1,700 and 2,100 containers. But in the last one week only one rake had been despatched by Concor. As a result, about 160 containers are now waiting at the Calcutta port to be despatched to Nepal.

 AIG net income doubles 

 New York, Nov. 10 (Reuters): American International Group Inc (AIG), the worlds largest insurer by market value, said on Thursday its net income more than doubled in the third quarter, making it the latest insurer to benefit from the absence of hurricanes this year. 

 The company also beat analysts expectations by 10 cents a share, sending its shares higher in aftermarket trading. 

 AIG rode the same wave as the rest of the property casualty industry, said Donald Light, an analyst with Celent LLC. 

 One of AIGs four major lines of business is property casualty, where the company suffered $1.6 billion in losses last year as Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma devastated the US Gulf Coast. This year, there were no significant catastrophes, the company said. 

 AIG said net income was $4.22 billion, or $1.61 a share, in the third quarter, up from $1.75 billion, or 66 cents a share, in the year earlier quarter. 

 AIG doesnt disappoint very much, said Matt Nellans, an insurance analyst with Morningstar. 

 Its ratio of premiums to losses and expenses for the first nine months improved by 4 percentage points, even without including the negative effect of the hurricanes in the year ago period. Life insurance premium income rose 7.5 per cent in the third quarter. Life insurance policyholder contracts were $7 billion in the first nine months of the year, a steady source of fee income, Nellans said. 

 Ford Motor

 Ford Motor Co said it was delaying the filing of its quarterly report with the Securities and Exchange Commission while the company completes a restatement of past results.

 Ford said last month it would restate results from 2001 to the second quarter of this year because of an accounting change related to interest-rate swaps that were taken out to hedge against the companys long-term debt.

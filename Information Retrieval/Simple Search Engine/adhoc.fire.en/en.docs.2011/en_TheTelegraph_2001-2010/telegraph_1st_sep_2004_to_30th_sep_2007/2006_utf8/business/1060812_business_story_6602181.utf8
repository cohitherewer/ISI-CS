 Brazil miner to bid for Canadian Inco

 Ground plan

 New York, Aug. 11 (Reuters): Brazilian mining company Companhia Vale do Rio Doce is set to launch an all-cash, $15.1 billion bid for Canadian nickel miner Inco, The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday, citing a person familiar with the matter. 

 CVRD is expected to offer C$86 per share of Inco, the report said. 

 Representatives for CVRD and Inco were not immediately available to comment on the report. A bid from CVRD would be a blow to Canadian miner Teck Cominco whose cash-and-stock offer was valued on Thursday at just above C$86, the report said. 

 On Thursday, Teck said it was confident its C$18.7 billion bid for Inco Ltd would succeed, but warned the battle was not over. 

 The Teck Cominco offer, competing against a friendly bid from US copper producer Phelps Dodge Corp, is due to close on August 16. Teck has said it does not intend to raise its bid. 

 Analysts say that Tecks bid offers investors greater certainty, because it contains nearly double the cash portion that Phelps is offering. 

 Inco said on Monday its board had authorised the companys senior management and its advisers to hold talks with Teck, which later said it had no plans to enter discussions. 

 Teck Cominco is the worlds biggest zinc miner and is seeking to drive growth as a diversified mining company as it spreads its risk. Its commodities also include coking coal, gold and copper. 

 A bid from CVRD would cap an extremely busy summer of merger activity in the global mining sector. 

 On July 28, Inco conceded its bid for Canadian miner Falconbridge after not enough shares were tendered. At the time, Inco said it would concentrate on its planned merge with Phelps Dodge. 

 Phelps Dodge had financially backed Inco in its takeover battle for Falconbridge with Swiss based Xstrata. On Tuesday, Falconbridges board of directors recommended shareholders tender to a takeover bid by Xstrata.

 Makeover move 

 New Delhi, April 5: The cabinet today approved the national urban transport policy that will establish integrated multi-modal public transport systems and set up effective regulatory mechanisms.

 The policy calls for offering central financial assistance to promote the use of public transport and non-motorised modes.

 It also talks of raising finances through innovative mechanisms that tap land as a resource for investments in urban transport infrastructure.

 The policy envisages encouraging integrated land use and transport planning in all cities so that distances are minimised and access to livelihoods, education and other social needs, especially for the marginal segments of the urban population, is improved.

 The policy aims at improving access of business to markets and will focus on bringing about a more equitable allocation of road space with people, rather than vehicles.

 It mentions setting up of regulatory and enforcement mechanisms, which will bring in a level playing field for all operators of transport services and enhance safety for users.

 The policy calls for introducing intelligent transport systems for traffic management and addressing concerns of road safety and trauma response.

 Regarding pollution, it calls for changes in travelling practices, stricter norms, better enforcement of the norms and technological improvements.

 The policy envisages building capacity, both institutional and manpower, for sustainable urban transport systems.

 It also mentions about knowledge management systems that would service the needs of professionals like planners, researchers, teachers and students.

 Highway project

 The government has approved the development of a six-lane highway between Vadodara and Surat as part of the golden quadrilateral project on a build, operate and transfer (BOT) basis.

 An upfront negative grant of Rs 975 crore has already been offered in a competitive bidding procedure, defence minister Pranab Mukherjee told reporters after a meeting of the cabinet committee on economic affairs (CCEA).

 The cabinet committee has approved incurring of pre-construction expenditure for fulfiling the obligations of the employer under the concession agreement estimated at Rs 55.46 crore, he added.

 The project benefits include improved traffic safety, faster movement of vehicles with improved riding quality and less time for travel, he said, adding this would lead to a significant reduction in vehicle operating cost and fuel consumption.

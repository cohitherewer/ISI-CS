 Bhubaneswar, June 21: A year after signing the country?s biggest foreign direct investment with the Orissa government for a 12-million tonne steel mill, Korean steelmaker Posco today threatened to call off the deal if it does not get the lease for captive mines assured to it. 

 On the eve of its first anniversary of the MoU signing ceremony today, Posco India chairman-cum-managing director Soung Sik-Cho said without the captive mining lease, there is no point in building the steel plant in Orissa.

 ?It?s pointless,? he said, a few hours before chief minister Naveen Patnaik tried to assure that all was well with the project. ?The Posco project is the biggest FDI in the country and we shall do our best to facilitate its completion,? he said.

 He expected ?small problems? like land acquisition and mining lease grants to be sorted out soon and added that the company has modified the plant layout 60 times to minimise the displacement of locals. 

 ?The last one year has been full of challenges and new experiences for us,? said Cho admitting that the project has been running behind schedule.

 The Rs 51000-crore deal has been facing opposition from day one. First, the Left and the state BJP president Juel Oram were against it over the iron ore export issue. 

 Also, the company has not been able to acquire the land for constructing the plant at Jagatsinghpur district due to stiff opposition from the local people. The Kalinga Nagar firing incident early this year added to its woes.

 The company is getting jittery over the fate of its application for captive iron ore mines in Keonjhar and Sundargarh districts, the reason Posco ventured out of Korea. 

 It currently sources most of the ore from Brazil for its steel plants back home, but at a higher cost.

 Under the deal, Posco was assured of mining leases of 600 million tonnes of iron ore over 30 years, the normal period of an Indian mining lease. 

 In September last, the company submitted its application for the prospective licence to the Orissa government, but is yet to get it.

 The state government is waiting for the Anwarul Hoda committee report that will decide the allocation of captive mines to steelmakers and help formulate a new mining and mineral policy. 

 Posco?s application for developing a captive port and granting of a SEZ status to its project is yet to be heard by the government.

 Chief minister Naveen Patnaik, however, has expressed satisfaction over the progress of the project. 

 He has appointed a senior IAS officer as the nodal officer and three other officers to look into the rehabilitation aspect. He also formed a Rehabilitation and Periphery Development Advisory Committee headed by the revenue divisional commissioner (central division).

 Posco will require around 4,004 acres for the steel project, out of which 3,569 acres belong to the government. A major chunk of this land has been encroached by locals. The land acquisition notice under section 4 (1) of the Land Acquisition Act has been published in newspapers, but the government has not been able to move into its own areas.

 Anil scripts a turnaround tale

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Clear call

 Mumbai, Feb. 21: Anil Ambani has won a lot of monikers in the past two years ? marathon man, pugnacious fighter, whistleblower, angry young scion. He has now got himself a new one: turnaround artist.

 The Anil camp today came out with the financial results for the first three quarters of Reliance Communications Ventures Ltd (RCoVL), which reveal that the company has stormed into the black after a disastrous first quarter when it had suffered a loss of Rs 250 crore.

 By the third quarter (Oct-December 2005), it had cranked up a profit of Rs 310 crore on total revenues of Rs 3,327 crore. There were no clear answers to the incredible story in RCoVL since the break-up of the consolidated figures was not available.

 The Anil camp said it was issuing the consolidated results for RCoVL in the interests of transparent corporate governance when it was not really required to do so. His group also took pains to point out that the poor results in the first quarter occurred when it didnt have control over the company. On Monday, two operating companies under RCoVL ? Reliance Infocomm and Reliance Communications Infrastructure Ltd ? wrote off bad debt worth Rs 4,500 crore to clean up their books.

 While market circles say this exercise may have been undertaken to raise the valuations of RCoVL ahead of its listing, they are waiting for more details on its financial performance. This will become clear after the company files an information memorandum with the stock exchanges. The Anil camp had earlier announced that RCoVL is likely to be listed in the week beginning March 6.

 Announcing the third-quarter proforma consolidated financials, RCoVL said apart from total revenues of Rs 3,327 crore posted during the quarter, RCoVL recorded a cash profit of Rs 720 crore. 

 These proforma numbers are based on financial performance of all companies in the RCoVL group, including Reliance Infocomm Ltd, Reliance Communications Infrastructure Ltd, FLAG Telecom and Reliance Telecom, it said.

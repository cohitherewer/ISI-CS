 Philips finds core strength is not enough

 Picture perfect?

 Amsterdam, April 18 (Reuters): Dutch Philips Electronics missed analysts forecasts for first-quarter net profit on Tuesday due to a one-off charge at an affiliate company, but its core units performed well as it sold more flat TVs, lamps and medical equipment.

 Philips net profit came in at 160 million euros ($193.6 million) compared with an average forecast of 221 million euros by 21 analysts polled by Reuters. Net profit in the year-ago period was 117 million euros.

 A charge of 45 million euros at its bankrupt television and monitor tubes display joint venture LG.Philips Displays dragged the result of unconsolidated companies to a loss of 36 million euros, versus an average analyst expectation of a 26 million euro profit.

 Revenues of the TVs to hospital equipment maker rose faster than expected to 7.37 billion euros from 6.64 billion a year earlier, and compared with an average analyst forecast of 7.03 billion euros.

 Adjusted for takeovers, divestments and currency fluctuations, revenues rose 10 percent, outperforming the companys own targets of 5 to 6 per cent sales growth thanks to strong demand for its new shavers, flat TVs, medical equipment, wireless chips and LED lamps in all regions of the world.

 This Q1 (sales growth) is ahead of what we expected. Sales grew at a lowest level of 8 per cent at medical systems to as much as 16 per cent at consumer electronics. The key driver for it is innovation, Chief Financial Officer Pierre-Jean Sivignon said in a conference call.

 In 2005, 49 per cent of Philips sales was generated by products less than two years old and the company ?the worlds biggest lighting maker ? is aiming for 54 per cent in 2006.

 There is a charge for the LG.Philips Displays business of 45 million. If you take that out, it fits with expectations. If you look at revenues they are significantly better, said analyst Eric de Graaf at broker Petercam.

 Income from operations from its core business units came in at 335 million euros against an average analyst expectation of 334 million and a year-ago profit of 207 million. The margin improved to 4.5 per cent of sales from 3.2 per cent in 2005.

 Were pleased that were keeping our momentum, with strong growth and solid performance across all our main divisions, Chief Executive Gerard Kleisterlee said in a statement.

 Philips is on track to achieve its medium-term sales growth target of 5 to 6 per cent per year and operating income margin target of between 7 and 10 per cent of revenues, Sivignon said.

 Philips shares had slipped 1.5 per cent to 26.45 euros by 0715 GMT, versus a 0.8 per cent lower Eurotech index.

 The shares are up 1 per cent this year, underperforming the FTSE European 100 which is up 7 per cent as well as technology peers which are up 9 per cent, mainly due to weakness at LG.Philips LCD which represents 3.5 euros of Philips share price.

 The first quarter result was boosted by a sharp upturn in the semiconductor division which increased its income from operations to 89 million euros from 14 million a year ago. Analysts had expected a 99.4 million euro operating profit.

 The chips unit is benefiting from additional restructuring and an improving product portfolio designed to power growth sectors such as cell phones, mobile TV, flat digital televisions, high definition TV set top boxes and personal video recorders.

 Philips has said the chips unit, the worlds 9th biggest with 4.6 billion euros of 2005 sales, will be made independent and prepared for a merger that will help it increase scale. The units manager Frans van Houten needs higher sales to justify massive research and development for new microchips.

 Philips said it was on track to separating its chips unit by the end of the third quarter.

 Philips is Europes biggest consumer electronics maker and also the worlds biggest electric shavers maker.

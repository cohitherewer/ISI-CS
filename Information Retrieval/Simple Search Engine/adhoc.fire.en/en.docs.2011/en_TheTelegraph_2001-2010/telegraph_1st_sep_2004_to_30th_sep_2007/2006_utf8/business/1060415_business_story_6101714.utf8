 Mumbai, April 14: Stock markets were closed today and didnt get to instantly react to Infosyss strong financial results on Friday ? but the pundits are divided on which way the sagging sensex will move when the markets open on Monday.

 The market mavens are divided because Infosys came out with fourth-quarter results for 2005-06 along with numbers for the full year, which fell short of expectations. However, the Infosys management gave a strong guidance for the first quarter of 2006-07 and the full year ? and this will play on the investors minds when the market reopens.

 You may find two sets of people, one who are disappointed with Infosys numbers and the others who are happy with its guidance. The markets are likely to open lower, said a broker. He added that the companys proposal to announce a 1:1 bonus would not cut much ice with markets as it had already been discounted. 

 Others, however, reckon that the strong Infosys guidance will bring a fresh lease of life to the benchmark index that has lost more than 400 points over the last couple of sessions. 

 The Infosys stock, like many others in the sector, has underperformed in the recent past due to several concerns. However, Infosys has put to rest many of these concerns. We should see the sector coming to the forefront again. The markets is likely to react positively on Monday, said an official from one of the dealing rooms.

 Infosys reported a net profit of Rs 673 crore for the fourth quarter ended March 31, up 21 per cent from Rs 558 crore in the corresponding period last year. But this was lower than the street estimates of Rs 680 crore for the quarter. Observers said this performance reflected the fact that worries about lower margins for the entire sector was not unfounded.

 Margins for the infotech sector have been under pressure as the pricing environment is not showing any signs of significant improvement. At the same time, the rupees appreciation and rising wages have been clipping profit margins. It was only last week that CLSA, the FII brokerage, downgraded the entire Indian IT industry as the margin of safety was receding. The brokerage downgraded Infosys from buy to outperform. 

 Although a section of the analysts were disgruntled with the net profit numbers, there are many who reacted positively to the guidance given by Infosys for the quarter ending June 30 and fiscal 2006-07. Although the fourth quarter results have been below expectations, the guidance given out by Infosys is encouraging and it is above our estimates, said Dipen Shah, AVP, Kotak Securities. Shah was optimistic about Infosys management comments on the growth prospects for the industry and outsourcing in particular. Their comments went to show that overall IT spend is gaining traction, he said.

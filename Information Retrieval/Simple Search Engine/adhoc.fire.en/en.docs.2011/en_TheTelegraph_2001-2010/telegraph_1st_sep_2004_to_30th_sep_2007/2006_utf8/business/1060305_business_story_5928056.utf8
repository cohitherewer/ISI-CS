 Air pact with Australia approved

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, March 4: The Union cabinet today approved a revised air services agreement between India and Australia for designating more than one airlines to fly between the two nations, a day ahead of Australian premier John Howards visit.

 The agreement will throw open destinations Down Under to private airlines like Jet Airways. 

 Parliamentary affairs minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi told reporters after the cabinet meeting, Under the new agreement, both the countries will have the right to designate as many airlines as they wish. The minister said the agreement was revised during the bilateral civil aviation consultations in September 2004 and it would lead to the opening up of the sky between the two nations and enhancing the number of air services to a significant extent.

 The designated airlines of each side would introduce an agreed number of services and on agreed routes between the two countries as would be decided from time to time.

 The agreement would terminate after one year of the date of receipt of notice by the other party, unless the notice is withdrawn by mutual consent of the parties before the end of the period, Dasmunsi said.

 The revised agreement, the minister said, signified an important landmark in civil aviation relations between India and Australia.

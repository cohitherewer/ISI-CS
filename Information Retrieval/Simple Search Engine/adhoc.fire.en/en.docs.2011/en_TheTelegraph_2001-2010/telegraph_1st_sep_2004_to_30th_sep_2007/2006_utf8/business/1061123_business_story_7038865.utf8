 Swiss fragrance for Quest

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Nov. 22: ICI India today announced the sale of its entire stake in its wholly-owned subsidiary, Quest International India Ltd (Quest India), to Swiss flavours and fragrances maker Givaudan Group for a total consideration of not less than Rs 390 crore. 

 This follows the global acquisition of Quest International by Givaudan from ICI Plc for 2.8 billion Swiss francs ($2.25 billion).

 Givaudan, the worlds largest maker of scents for fragrances and consumer products and supplier to world renowned brands like Calvin Klein and Burberry, will extend its lead in the high-margin business, while ICI will pay off debt and pension liabilities. 

 The global acquisition, financed by debt and the issuing of up to 1 billion francs in equity, will increase Givaudans expertise in research and development and accelerate expansion in emerging markets. 

 Analysts say, at the same time, it will affect the companys margins over the next three years as it absorbs the less-profitable Quest. Payment to ICI will be in cash. 

 The company expects costs from the acquisition to total 230 million francs annually for the next three years. Is there going to be another big acquisition like this one in the next three or four years? Well thats not necessarily realistic, Gilles Andrier, CEO, Givaudan reportedly said. 

 The Netherlands-headquartered Quest is the fifth-largest player in the global flavour and fragrances market, with a turnover of about 1.3 billion francs in 2005. 

 Quest India was established in 2001 as a joint venture between the ICI Group and Hindustan Lever Ltd (HLL), with ICI India holding the controlling interest. As provided in the joint venture agreement, ICI India acquired HLLs 49 per cent shareholding in May 2006. 

 ICI India subsequently acquired the remaining 1 per cent of the share capital held by a group company of ICI Plc making Quest India as its wholly-owned subsidiary. The total investment made by ICI India in the shares of Quest India is about Rs 209 crore. 

 Quest India reported net sales of Rs 116 crore and a PAT of Rs 7.8 crore for the year ended March 31, 2006. It is headquartered in Mumbai and has its manufacturing sites in Daman, with about 100 employees on its rolls.

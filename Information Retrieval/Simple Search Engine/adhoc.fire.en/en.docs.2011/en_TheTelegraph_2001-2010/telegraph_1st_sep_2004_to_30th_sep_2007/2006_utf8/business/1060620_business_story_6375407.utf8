 Orascom to raise stake in Hutchison 

 Cairo, June 19 (Bloomberg): Orascom Telecom Holding, West Asias largest mobile-phone operator by subscriptions, may boost its stake in Hutchison Telecommunications International by 3.3 per cent, Orascom CEO Naguib Sawiris said.

 We are currently building our reserves for a possible increase in our stake in Hutchison, Sawiris said here today. 

 Orascom, which agreed in December to buy a 19.3 per cent stake in Hutchison for $1.3 billion, wants to merge with the Asian telecommunications company, he said, reiterating previous comments.

 Sawiris is seeking to expand in Asia and Africa to make Cairo-based Orascom one of the worlds 10 largest telecom companies.

 Orascom has the option to buy a further 3.7 per cent stake in Hutchison in the next 12 months at no less than Hong Kong $11 ($1.4) per share, the company had said in December.

 Earlier this year, Orascom Telecom bought Hutchison Telecom Internationals 917,759,712 shares, which represented a 19.3 per cent stake in the company. Orascom was to pay Hong Hong $11 ($1.42) per share which valued the deal at $1.3 billion. The payment was to be made by February 28.

 Orascom and Hutchison Telecom jointly operate in 15 countries and had more than 40 million combined customers as of September 30. 

 The tie-up with Hutchison allows Orascom Telecom to expand in Asia, in countries such as India, Indonesia and Vietnam.

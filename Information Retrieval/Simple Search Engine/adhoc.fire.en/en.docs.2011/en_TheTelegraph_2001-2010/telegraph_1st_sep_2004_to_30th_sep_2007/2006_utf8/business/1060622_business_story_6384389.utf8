 Mahindra firms make beeline for market

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, June 21: The Mahindra group companies are ready to hit the market to raise cash through public offers, undeterred by the volatility in the secondary market and the weak response to maiden issues after they are listed on the bourses.

 After Tech Mahindra decided to enter the market, Mahindra Gesco Developers, the Mahindra Groups listed real estate development company, has decided to tap the market again. 

 In a notice to the Bombay Stock Exchange, Mahindra Gesco Developers said the company was planning to raise funds by issuing about 65 lakh equity shares and 37.8 lakh warrants to promoters on a preferential allotment basis. The Mahindras hold 55 per cent in the company.

 The company plans to raise Rs 500-600 crore through the issue of fresh equity. 

 Mahindra Gesco is looking at an equity dilution of 30 per cent.

 Arun Nanda, vice chairman of Mahindra Gesco, has reportedly said the company plans to raise Rs 400 crore from qualified institutional participants (QIPs) and Rs 200 crore from the promoters. The money raised will be used to finance SEZs. 

 The company has signed up for two SEZs, one in Jaipur and the other in Pune. 

 Part of the IPO proceeds will be used to finance the capital required for these two SEZs. The total market capital of Mahindra Gesco as on June 21 stood at Rs 1,829.84 crore. The company ended the day at a 6.54 per cent high of Rs 589.70, up from the previous close of Rs 553.50 yesterday. The total traded quantity of the company stood at 14.37 lakh. 

 The board of directors of the company has approved the proposal at its meeting on Monday. Neither of the Mahindra Group companies has finalised a date for the IPO. 

 Mahindra Gesco has signed an MoU with the Maharashtra government to set up a special economic zone in Pune. 

 This SEZ will be located off the Mumbai-Pune highway and is expected to be spread over 3,000 acres. The project is expected to generate an investment in excess of $2 billion and will create 75,000 jobs.

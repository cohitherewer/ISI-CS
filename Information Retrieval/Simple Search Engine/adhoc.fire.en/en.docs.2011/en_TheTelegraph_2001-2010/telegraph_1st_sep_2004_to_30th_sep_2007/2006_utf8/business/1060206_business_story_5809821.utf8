 LOOSE CHANGE

 ING Vysya Mutual Fund has launched an open-ended diversified equity scheme called Against the Market Fund, which will invest in stocks that are less favoured in the current bull phase of the market. The fund house has identified 300 such shares and 40 per cent of them qualify as contra stocks. The new scheme will close for subscription on February 20 and takes BSE 100 as the benchmark index. The minimum amount of investment is Rs 5,000.

 HSBC has launched MyHome, a home loan product that allows the borrower to decide his equated monthly instalments (EMIs). Depending on their annual cash flows, borrowers can choose to either increase or decrease their EMIs up to 15 per cent. In other words, MyHome is a two-in-one plan that entails both the step-up and step-down payment facilities. The EMI payment flexibility can be exercised from the first year of taking the loan and can be extended up to the second-last year of the loan tenure. 

 Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund has declared a dividend of 3.5 per cent to 6.5 per cent for its five income funds. The fund house has also announced bonus units in the ratio of 2:1000 for two of its income plans and 5:1000 for monthly income plan.

 London, May 9: The war at the top of the worlds larger steel companies ignited again today as Luxembourg-based Mittal Steel said it was prepared to increase its bid and consider fundamental board changes in exchange for a friendly merger with French-based Arcelor.

 The two have been fighting for almost five months.

 Mittals bid is currently valued at 20 billion euros (?13.9 billion). Arcelor shares jumped just under 2.5 per cent on the Euronext Paris exchange today to 35.85 euros.

 Arcelor chief executive Guy Dolle has suggested that the company might consider Mittals approach if there were a cash offer that recognised the value of Arcelor.

 He has suggested a value of between 34 billion euros and 41 billion euros.

 Lakshmi Mittal, the UKs richest man and head of Mittal Steel, told investors he was prepared to discuss the price but was still being given the cold shoulder by the Arcelor management.

 Mittal said discussions had been initiated with Arcelor. However, other sources said there had been no contact between Mittal and Joseph Kinsch, Arcelors chairman.

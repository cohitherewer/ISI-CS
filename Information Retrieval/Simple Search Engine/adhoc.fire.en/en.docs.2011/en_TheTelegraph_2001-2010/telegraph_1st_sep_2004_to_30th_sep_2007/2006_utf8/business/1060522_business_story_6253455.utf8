 ONGC takes refinery call on reserve site

 S.P.S. PANNU 

 New Delhi, May 21: The site for the country?s strategic crude oil reserve project at Mangalore has turned into a source of dispute with ONGC staking a claim to the land for its mega petrochemical project.

 Sources said the Indian Strategic Petroleum Reserve Ltd (ISPL) that will build the storage facility has picked the same site where ONGC wants to locate its ambitious Rs 35,000-crore petrochemicals complex as part of the oil giant?s expansion programme for Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL).

 The Karnataka government is also keen to hand over the plot to ONGC as it wants this huge investment to flow into the state. 

 However, Engineers India Ltd, which has been picked by ISPL to test the geological validity of the site, has declared that the land was ideal for the storage facility as the rocky terrain can be blasted to carve out the storage space. 

 The facility is being modelled on similar underground facilities in South Korea. The EIL team visited several countries before adapting the Korean system.

 Senior petroleum ministry officials feel the strategic reserve facility is a prestigious project and must get precedence over the petrochemicals zone. 

 ?The petrochemicals zone can come up at some other place along the coast, but the strategic reserve requires this rocky strata,? a senior petroleum ministry official said. 

 ONGC officials fear the heavy blasting at the site by EIL could affect the foundation structure of the Mangalore refinery. 

 The petroleum ministry had asked EIL to carry out underground test blasts in the region and explore the impact on the Mangalore refinery.

 However, ONGC officials aver that the small test blasts of EIL are barely comparable to the large scale explosions necessary to set up the strategic storage. They fear bigger blasts will affect the structure of the refinery; to prevent this a more distant site needs to be identified for the facility.

 EIL and Indian Oil Corporation, which was earlier entrusted with the task of drawing up a feasibility report for the project, had selected the site about a year ago.

 Crude spike hurdle to price policing

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 27: The government expects to put the lid on inflation ? but the only uncertain factor is an unexpected surge in world oil prices.

 Given sufficient forex reserves and commitment to further trade and tariff reforms, strict fiscal prudence, monetary discipline and orderly movement of the exchange rate of rupee, the annual inflation rates in terms of both wholesale and consumer price indices are likely to witness a declining trend in the medium-term and remain within tolerable limits, says the Economic Survey.

 It said the overall wholesale price rise in most part of 2005-06 remained below 5 per cent and is likely to remain around 5 per cent at the end of March 2006, thanks to sound macro-economic management along with effective management of supply and demand for essential items. The wholesale price index (WPI) inflation averaged 6.5 per cent in the previous fiscal.

 Higher fuel prices was the main contributor to inflation this fiscal, followed by primary and manufactured products.

 The survey pointed out that procurement higher than the offtake had resulted in a build-up of excessive stocks of foodgrains during the two successive years ? 2001-02 and 2002-03.

 Stocks of foodgrains at 19 million tonnes in December 2005 though lower than the stocks of 21.8 million tonnes in December 2004, were higher than the buffer stock norms. The main reason for a decline of total stocks was due to a lower stock of wheat.

 The survey said 2004-05 was a normal agriculture year with good procurement of foodgrains. Rice procurement during kharif marketing season 2004-05 at 24.7 million tonnes was higher by around 2 million tonnes over 2003-04.

 However, wheat procurement during the rabi marketing season 2005-06 was 14.8 million tonnes, down by 2 million tonnes compared with 2004-05.

 According to the survey, offtake of foodgrains from central pool at 265.7 lakh tonnes during April-November 2005 was marginally higher by 1.50 lakh tonnes over the corresponding period of fiscal 2004-05.

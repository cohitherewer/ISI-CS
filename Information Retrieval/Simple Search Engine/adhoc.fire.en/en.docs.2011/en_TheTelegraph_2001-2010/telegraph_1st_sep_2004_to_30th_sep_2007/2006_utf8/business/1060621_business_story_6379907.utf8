 Birlas close Idea stake buy

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, June 20: The Aditya Birla group today concluded the acquisition of the Tata groups 48.14 per cent stake in Idea Cellular for Rs 4,406 crore. With this, the combined holding of the Aditya Birla group in Idea has gone up to 98.3 per cent. 

 Four AV Birla group firms will hold the stake ? Aditya Birla Nuvo 35.7 per cent, Birla TMT Holdings 44.9 per cent, Grasim Industries 7.6 per cent and Hindalco Industries close to 10.1 per cent.

 The Idea name has come to stand for value and innovation in the eyes of its millions of subscribers, said Aditya Birla group chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla. We will raise the bar and aim that Idea represents the very best across all product and service categories, he added.

 Market analysts say the Tata-Birla deal puts the value of Idea at an estimated Rs 9,200 crore. The conclusion of the deal brings to an end the nearly four-month battle between the two giants over Idea. 

 Differences between the two business houses cropped up after the Aditya Birla group wrote to the department of telecom, asking it to direct the Tatas to exit Idea Cellular or reduce its stake in the venture to below 10 per cent.

 The Birlas said the Tata group, which held stake in Idea and Tata Teleservices, was violating the licence conditions. A series of correspondence followed between the two groups and the government.

 The Tatas had even issued a notice to the Birlas, saying it had breached the shareholders agreement by revealing confidential information on Idea Cellular.

 However, in the first week of April, both the groups reached an agreement and the Birlas decided to buy the entire 48.14 per cent Tata stake in Idea for Rs 4,406 crore.

 Railways spoil Texmaco party

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 21: Texmaco?s financials suffered a setback during the third quarter ended December 31, 2005. For the reporting quarter, the company posted an overall decline vis-?-vis the corresponding period in the previous year. 

 The company?s gross sales for the October-December period last year stood at Rs 74.23 crore, down from Rs 86.65 crore in the year-ago period.

 Gross profit also declined to Rs 7.64 crore for the quarter from Rs 8.37 crore a year ago. The net profit slipped to Rs 4.46 crore from Rs 6.01 crore. 

 The unprecedented delay of over nine months in the release of wagon orders by the Indian Railways for 2005-06 had affected the company?s quarterly results.

 The orders have since been released for delivery to be effected up to June 2006 and the production would be reflected in the coming months, a company communique said.

 While this has heavily impacted the working results of Texmaco?s heavy engineering division, its steel foundry registered improved performance during the three months period. 

 The gross sales of the heavy engineering division net of excise duty fell to Rs 46.48 crore from Rs 62.63 crore. But the steel foundry division recorded a rise in income from Rs 17.98 crore to 21.94 crore over the same period.

 Calcutta, Sept. 4: Ramsarup Industries has earmarked Rs 775 crore for capital expenditure during the next three to four years.

 Of this, Rs 150 crore will be set aside for acquisitions in India and abroad and another Rs 150 crore for setting up a special economic zone in Durgapur, Ramsarup Industries chairman and managing director Ashish Jhunjhunwala said on the sidelines of the companys annual general meeting here today.

 The company is already setting up a 30,000-tonne low relaxation prestressed concrete (LRPC) wire manufacturing plant in Durgapur. 

 We have already deployed an Italian company for the plant and machinery. Construction will start from December this year. Production from this plant will commence from December next year, Jhunjhunwala said. LRPC wires are used in prestressed concrete girders for construction of roads, bridges, domes, slabs, hangars and railway slippers. 

 We are also planning to set up a special economic zone in Durgapur. We are talking to the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation for some land there. However, these are at a nascent stage, he added. 

 Ramsarup has earmarked Rs 150 crore for developing the SEZ. 

 Ramsarup Industries, which also manufactures TMT bars, is focussing more on consolidating its iron and steel wire manufacturing business. We have earmarked Rs 150 crore for acquiring a company with a capacity between 30,000 and 50,000 tonnes per annum, Jhunjhunwala said. 

 Ramsarup is looking for a company in the southern and western regions of the country and 3-4 proposals were already under negotiations. We are also looking for acquisitions abroad, he said. 

 Value additions and margins are more in wires than in TMT bars and thats precisely why we want to focus on consolidating in the iron and steel wire industry, Jhunjhunwala elaborated. The company is also spending Rs 24 crore for increasing the capacity of its Kalyani plant to 2,24,000 tonnes per annum and Rs 29 crore for expanding the capacity at its Shyamnagar plant to 1,67,000 tonnes a year. 

 Besides, the power transmission and distribution sector offers a huge opportunity for the company. This sector alone will require an investment of Rs 4 lakh crore by 2010. Of this, the demand for wires is estimated to be around Rs 1 lakh crore. 

 To grab this emerging business opportunity, Ramsarup Industries has set up separate business unit, Ramsarup Infrastructure, to cater to the infrastructure and power transmission sector. 

 Our order book stands at Rs 330 crore, of which Rs 227 crore is for manufacturing and Rs 103 crore for infrastructure, Jhunjhunwala said.

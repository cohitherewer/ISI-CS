 Bankers get ready for action

 - Worried banks look for way out as RBI raises general provisioning requirement on loans

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, April 18: Interest rates on housing loans, personal loans and credit for investment in the capital market are set to rise following the Reserve Banks move to raise their provisioning requirement.

 A host of banks led by Bank of India (BoI) and Bank of Baroda (BoB) are mulling a hike in interest rates on these advances to pass on the setback that would otherwise hit their bottomlines.

 In the lean season credit policy, RBI governor Y.V. Reddy has increased the general provisioning requirement on standard advances to personal loans, loans and advances qualifying as capital market exposures, housing loans beyond Rs 20 lakh and commercial real estate loans to 1 per cent. The move means that banks will have to provide more money in their balancesheets for such loans.

 Admitting that BoI is looking at raising interest rates on these advances, chairman and managing director S. Balachandran said the banks asset liability committee would soon take a decision on this. 

 We will increase the lending rates for these segments, he said.

 He, however, did not disclose whether the bank would raise housing loan rates across the board. 

 Officials at BoB said the bank would take a decision on interest rates later this month.

 It is largely felt that those banks who have not raised interest rates on housing loans recently, may now make these loans dearer by 25-50 basis points.

 According to Keki Mistry, managing director of Housing Development Finance Corporation Ltd, the increase in risk weight and the enhanced provisions on standard assets reflect the RBIs concern on rising property prices.

 The increased provisioning on sector-specific standard assets, particularly housing loans above Rs 20 lakh and commercial real estate loans, is a sharp measure. However, in the case of HDFC, the provisions have always been significantly higher than the regulatory requirements, he said.

 Although such an announcement puts borrowers on tenterhooks, senior bankers like M.V. Nair, chairman and managing director of Union Bank of India, felt that the measure reflects the RBIs focus on credit quality.

 By increasing the provisioning requirement on sensitive sectors such as real estate, he is giving a message to bankers that they must proceed with caution, he said.

 Praise for Reddy

 The industry and merchant chambers hailed the annual monetary and credit policy for 2006-07. 

 RBI governor Y.V. Reddy deserves accolades for presenting a well-founded monetary policy, which attempts to provide a congenial interest rate regime to support growth momentum with price stability, said Santosh Rungta, president of Bharat Chamber of Commerce.

 Merchants Chamber of Commerce president Santosh Saraf said, It is good to see that the RBI has left the bank rate, repo and reverse repo rates and the cash reserve ratio unchanged in its annual policy statement. This has been done to ease the pressure on market liquidity and avert wide fluctuations in market rates.

 The move to constitute a working group to assist farmers with financial counselling and introduction of a Specific Credit Guarantee Scheme is welcome, Rungta said. 

 However, both the chambers lamented the governors failure to take measures to reduce the cost of fund for trade and industry. 

 The spiralling crude prices, rising asset prices and geo-political risks have not been addressed properly and these will continue to pose a threat to the countrys financial stability, Saraf said.

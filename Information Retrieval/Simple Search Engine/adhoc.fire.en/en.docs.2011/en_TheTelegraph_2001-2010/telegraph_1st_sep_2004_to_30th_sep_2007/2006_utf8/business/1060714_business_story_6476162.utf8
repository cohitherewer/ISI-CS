 Calcutta, July 13: Ahmad Tea of London, which buys 3 million kg of the CTC from India annually, plans to strike long-term contracts with producers to source 1.5 million kg of the orthodox as well. It buys 20 million kg tea globally.

 The company is also looking at buyouts in Indian specialty tea. Moreover, Ahmad Tea wants to promote the Darjeeling and the Assam orthodox in Russia.

 ?There is a grave misconception in India that the Russian market is for cheap tea. On the contrary, even before the formation of the CIS, Russia has been a strong orthodox market. About 10 million kg of our tea are sold in Russia, Belarus and Ukraine combined,? said Rahim Afshar, managing director of Ahmad Tea.

 The company said the long-term contracts would only be feasible if it gets a steady supply of the orthodox on a par with the prices in Sri Lanka at $2.80 per kg.

 Indian exports to CIS/Russia have been decreasing over the years. The total exports to CIS countries, including Russia, decreased from 51.9 million kg in 2004-05 to 41.94 million kg in 2005-06.

 ?India?s domestic consumption has been growing at 3 per cent. The country has the capability to produce both CTC and orthodox varieties. But orthodox production is insignificant in a market dominated by the CTC as consumption pattern determines manufacturing policy. As a result, India loses out on orthodox markets,? said Bharath Arya, CEO of JV Gokal amp; Co Pvt. For four years, JV Gokal has a packaging tie-up with Ahmad Tea.

 The Tea Board has doled out Rs 20 crore till date in subsidy to various orthodox growers, said board chairman Basudeb Banerjee.

 The Russian market, estimated to be more than 100 million kg, is dominated by the orthodox. Afshar said Ahmad Tea, which is a big player in Russia with an office in Moscow, is willing to help promote the Darjeeling and Assam orthodox in the Russian and CIS markets. 

 The company, which sources from Williamson Magor, Goodricke and Assam Company, will also look at packaging opportunities in India.

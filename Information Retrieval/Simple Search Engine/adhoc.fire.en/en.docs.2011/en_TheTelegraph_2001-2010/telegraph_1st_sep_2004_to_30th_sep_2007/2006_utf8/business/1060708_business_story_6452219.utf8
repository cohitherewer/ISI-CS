 LNM denies hostile bid

 OUR BUREAU

 July 7: Lakshmi Niwas Mittal today denied that he was planning to mount a hostile bid for Tata Steel.

 I have seen the recent reports in the newspapers. Why should Tata Steel feel vulnerable, Mittal said when asked to comment on speculation that he was stalking Indias largest private sector steel maker, prompting the Tatas to announce their decision to raise their stake in the company through a preferential issue of stock to ward off the threat.

 Son Aditya Mittal, flanking his father at the press conference, was even more categorical. We are looking only at greenfield investments in India, he said.

 Aditya said there was huge potential for investing in steel projects in India as the installed capacity was small and the scope for growth very large. Compared with the US and China, the consumption of steel in India is very low and there was tremendous scope to raise production levels, he added.

 Mittal said in the long run only big companies were likely to survive in India as small companies all over the world had closed down as they were not efficient enough to compete with their bigger rivals. Small companies also spark higher levels of pollution and have, therefore, been unable to meet stringent emission standards in several countries.

 Meanwhile, Ratan Tata, who was also in Delhi to attend a meeting of the Investment Commission, said the group would consolidate its holdings in all group companies over time but refused to elaborate.

 Asked to comment on Mittals big ticket investment plans in India, Tata said, The market is big enough for everybody.

 But Mittals aggressive foray into India and the talk about acquisitions hasnt fazed other private steelmakers since they have a comfortable stake in the operations they manage. 

 Tata Steel, the countrys largest private steel maker and the second largest after the government owned Steel Authority of India (SAIL), is most vulnerable to any hostile takeover threat with the promoters stake at 26.79 per cent at present. 

 The governments stake in SAIL is 85.82 per cent and it is the most secure. The Ruias of Essar Steel have a 74.64 per cent holding, while the Jindals have 44.93 per cent in JSW Steel. Ispat Industries, owned by L.N. Mittals brothers, has a promoter stake of 51.5 per cent.

 In fiscal 2006, Tata Steel produced 5 million tonnes of steel and expects to reach 7.5 million tonnes by 2008. The company has announced a capital expenditure of Rs 70,000 crore over the next 10 years to make it a 30-million tonnes per annum company. 

 Tata Steel is the most efficient steelmaker in the country and that makes it a potential target for Mittal, said a metals analyst.

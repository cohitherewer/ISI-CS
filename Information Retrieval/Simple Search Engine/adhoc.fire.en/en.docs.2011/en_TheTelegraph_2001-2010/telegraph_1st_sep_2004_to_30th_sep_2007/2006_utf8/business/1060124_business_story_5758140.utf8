 CLB reserves order on Haldia Petro

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 23: The company law board (CLB) today reserved an order on the issue of allotting 135 crore shares to IDBI by The Chatterjee Group (TCG) in the Haldia Petrochemicals Limited (HPL) case.

 The chairman of the board reserved an order after considering the submissions made by Chatterjee Petroleum Mauritius Company (CPMC). CPMC said with further allotment of shares to IDBI according to the corporate debt restructuring package, the company would become a minority stakeholder.

 The CPMC counsel argued that the matter of allotment of shares to IDBI cannot be taken in isolation because it would have a direct bearing on the shareholding and nature of ownership of the company.

 The structure of the company will change and HPL will become a government company. CPMC will become a minority stakeholder if the allotment of shares is made to IDBI. This will amount to backdoor nationalisation, argued the counsel.

 IDBI is the principal lender of the consortium of 52 institutions who had lent money to the company. The companys total debt currently stands at around Rs 3,000 crore.

 IDBI, through its counsel, sought to vacate the injunction order issued on August 4 last year, which had stayed the allotment of shares to the financial institution.

 The IDBI counsel contended that according to the CDR agreement and subsequent resolution of the company, the financial institution should be allotted shares and the injunction was unfair.

 The counsel also said Chatterjee Petroleum has not placed all the documents pertaining to the CDR and the subsequent company resolutions before the company law board.

 HPL was billed as a dream project for Bengal. Commissioned in April 2000, it involved a total project cost of Rs 5,600 crore, the company today has an accumulated debt of over Rs 3,000 crore.

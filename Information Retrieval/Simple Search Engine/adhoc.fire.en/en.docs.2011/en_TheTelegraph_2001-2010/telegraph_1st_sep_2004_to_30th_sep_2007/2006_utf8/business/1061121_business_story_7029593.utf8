 Bank bonhomie busts block in ties with Singapore

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Nov. 20: India and Singapore have broken a 15-month gridlock in their relations with both deciding to comply with a quid pro quo arrangement under which two Indian banks State Bank of India and ICICI Bank would be granted full banking licences in the island nation. Moreover, state-owned investment entities in Singapore would be allowed to raise their stakes in Indian banks.

 The arrangement was spelt out in the Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) that India and Singapore signed in August 2005.

 The standoff began after the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) demurred when the two Indian banks applied for full licences, prompting the Reserve Bank of India to stall on granting permission to Government of Singapore Investment Corp (GIC) and Temasek Holdings to raise their stakes in Indian banks.

 The Indian government has now decided to treat GIC and Temasek Holdings as two separate entities, paving the way for both to buy up to 10 per cent each in domestic private sector banks.

 Banking circles now expect both GIC and Temasek to raise their stake in ICICI Bank. Incidentally, GIC, which manages the city states foreign exchange reserves, has long made its intentions clear. Its managing director, Ng Kok Song, said on August 31 that it would seek to raise the stake in ICICI Bank. During the period ended September 30, GIC held 2.3 per cent in Indias largest private sector bank.

 The impasse came when the RBI had barred GIC and Temasek from raising their stake to 10 per cent each during its public issue last year because it treated the Singapore state companies as a single entity. Temasek had a 7.4 per cent stake and GIC owned 2.3 per cent.

 Commerce minister Kamal Nath today announced in the capital that the government has decided to allow Temasek Holdings and GIC to raise their stake in ICICI Bank.

 When the CECA was signed in 2005, India had assured the city state that both GIC and Temasek would be treated as distinct investment entities.

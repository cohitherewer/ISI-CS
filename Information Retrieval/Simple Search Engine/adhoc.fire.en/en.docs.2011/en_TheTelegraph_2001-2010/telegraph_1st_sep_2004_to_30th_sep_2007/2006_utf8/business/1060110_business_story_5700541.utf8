 Calcutta, Jan. 9: UTI Mutual Fund hopes to mop up Rs 5,000 crore this year from new funds.

 The fund today launched UTI Leadership Equity Fund, an equity scheme, which will be open for subscription till January 30. 

 You can expect another new fund in a month and 3-4 more over the next six months, said D.R.S. Murthy, executive director of UTI Asset Management Company.

 The countrys largest mutual fund was converted into a private mutual fund after its four sponsors ? State Bank of India, Life Insurance Corporation of India, Bank of Baroda and Punjab National Bank ? paid over Rs 1,230 crore to the government last year to pick up 25 per cent each in the Fund. 

 In 2005, UTI Mutual Fund had launched only one fund ? UTI Dividend Yield ? mobilising a little over Rs 500 crore. 

 We concentrated on consolidating our portfolio, following which five schemes (Liquid Advantage, Bond Advantage, Gilt Advantage and Index Advantage- nifty and sensex) were wound up. Five more (Primary Equity Plan, Unit Scheme 92, Master Equity Plan 98, MEP 99 and Grandmaster Euity Scheme) were merged into a single entity called UTI Opportunities Fund, Murthy said. 

 This year, we will focus on new fund offerings which will have an altogether different investment theme, he added.

 To start with, the investment portfolio of UTI Leadership Equity Fund will consist of 25-30 stocks, said fund manager Sanjay Dongre. 

 Around 75-80 per cent of these stocks will comprise leading companies in their respective sectors or sub-sectors, while the remaining 20-25 per cent stocks will be of companies that are potential leaders in their sectors, he added. 

 UTI Mutual Fund has filed a draft offer letter with the Securities amp; Exchange Board of India for UTI Contra Fund. It is also planning an arbitrage fund soon. 

 It also plans to launch a slew of debt, income and liquid funds this year alongside the equity funds.

 However, there is another reason for UTIMF to bank on new funds in 2006. 

 UTI AMCs income from investment management fees dropped significantly for the year ended March 31, 2005 to Rs 307.72 crore from Rs 375.10 crore in the year-ago period. 

 During the same time erstwhile Unit Trust of India was split into UTI-I and UTI-II, which became UTI Asset Management Company. 

 Investment management fees is a percentage of net asset value of funds and varies with the movements of the market. During most of 2004, the market was sombre. This may change in 2005-06 as the market is in an upbeat mood, Murthy explanied. 

 To attract investors, the fund house has initiated different customer-friendly measures. It has tied-up with UTI Bank so that the banks customers, who are also UTIMFs unitholders, can purchase and redeem their units from UTI Bank ATMs. 

 Besides, we have also made inter-register transfer from one plan to another easy for investors, said Murthy. Earlier, one would have to apply to UTI, send the unit certificates, get the pay cheque and then buy the units of the plan. This cumbersome process is gone now, he added.

 The Fund also plans to acquire a technology firm and a distribution firm. 

 UTI AMC chairman U.K. Sinha last month said, The acquisition will help us serve our customers better.

 Number quibble dogs rogue hunt

 Trade monitor

 Chairman M. Damodaran has trashed the report of the expert committee that Sebi had set up to re-examine the issues relating to the Market Participants and Investors? Identification Numbers. To begin with, only those, whose transaction values are over Rs 5 lakh, will have to go in for biometric impressions, code for fingerprinting. For the rest of us, PAN cards will do, but the Rs 5-lakh limit will be progressively reduced. This is what the Sebi committee said about biometric identification: ?A simple biometric identification limited only to the capital market may not establish identity and ensure audit trail of transactions of a person.? 

 It felt that a system based on existing information resources, which would have led to lower costs for investors and recommended instead a system based on a special software, called dedupe software.

 Rattled by the recent IPO multiple applications scam, however, Sebi doesn?t want to take chances. But how many trades are above Rs 5 lakh? The committee pointed out that during January-February 2005, there were only 1.62 lakh investors on the NSE and 0.76 lakh investors on the BSE whose single order entry was Rs 1 lakh. For trades above Rs 5 lakh, the number would be far smaller. 

 In effect, therefore, Sebi is relying on the PAN card to establish the identity of genuine investors. If so, then why not save all the trouble and continue to keep PAN cards as the base of a system that will create a Unique Identity Number for all investors?

 The root cause of putting in multiple applications during an IPO lies in the special reservations for small investors. Why not have the book-building system followed all around the world, where institutional investors build the book and are allotted the shares, which they then distribute?

 Short-selling scope

 Sebi now proposes to allow institutions to sell short. Short selling by retail investors is already permitted but there has been little of it because of the difficulty of borrowing stocks. 

 Simply put, if you want to sell short, you have to borrow the shares you want to short before you can sell them. Later, when you buy back the shares (hopefully at a lower price) you can return them to the lender. So the market needs to have a good stock lending and borrowing mechanism before short-selling will work. Now that institutional players will also be allowed to go short, they will need to borrow stocks. Since lending to institutions is less risky than lending to retail investors, hopefully the stock lending and borrowing market will get a boost.

 Stock lending will enable investors to earn a return from the stocks they hold. Short-selling in the cash market will allow institutions to take advantage of a discount in futures, by buying futures and selling in the cash market to correct the anomaly. That will also make for better price discovery, correcting the current long only bias of the cash market.

 Perhaps the best institutions that can push stock lending are the clearing corporations. They are in any case supposed to guarantee the counter-party risk, and they anyway have to lend and borrow securities to meet settlement shortages.

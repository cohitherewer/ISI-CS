 Reliance on Aramco ally shortlist

 OUR BUREAU

 Who is the chosen one?

 May 10: Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) is one of the four companies shortlisted by Saudi Aramco to set up a $8-billion petrochemical plant in Saudi Arabia.

 Others in the fray are Dow Chemicals, Exxon-Mobil and Sabic. The project will be located at the Ras Tanura refinery complex in the Juaymah industrial area. 

 Though RIL officials declined to comment on the issue, sources said the company would place its bid before Saudi Aramco.

 The Saudi Arabian oil giant had signed MoUs with several companies for the project. The MoU with Reliance was signed in January when a Saudi Arabian delegation, led by its King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, visited India. 

 According to the website of Saudi Aramco, the upstream project will use the feedstock from the Ras Tanura refinery as an input. The refinery has a hydrocracking facility with a capacity of 325,000 barrels per day (bpd) and a 200,000 bpd condensate splitter. 

 The petrochemical complex will have an ethane or naphtha-based cracker unit, an aromatics recovery complex and complementary downstream derivative units to produce new secondary petrochemicals. 

 Reliances Saudi adventure coincides with associate company Reliance Petroleums plan to set up a 27 million-tonne refinery and a petrochemical complex in Jamnagar. 

 Saudi Aramco has the basic ingredient that is to be processed to make petrochemical products. Whoever wins the bid will have assured raw material supply. Moreover, the logistic cost will be minimal being in the same location as with the refinery, analysts said.

 The ambitious bid fits in with Reliance promoter Mukesh Ambanis acumen to handle complex projects within a strict time schedule. If Reliance clinches the deal, it would be the largest overseas investment by any Indian company.

 Reliance also has an opportunity to be associated with a company ? Saudi Aramco ? that sits on some of the largest oil reserves in the world. The Saudi company is in a position to leverage its dominant position as nations continue to rely on West Asia for their hydrofuel requirements.

 Mukesh Ambani-controlled Reliance is the countrys leading player in the petrochem arena. With subsidiary IPCL, it has its presence in 70 per cent of Indias petrochem business. The Ras Tanura and Juaymah project is in line with the Rabigh project of Aramco that started in May 2004. 

 Saudi Aramco and Sumitomo Chemical of Japan is developing the existing 400,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) Rabigh Refinery into an integrated refinery/petrochemical complex.

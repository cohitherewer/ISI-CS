 Amrita Patel on Tata Tea board

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 4: Tata Tea has appointed Amrita Patel, chairperson of the National Dairy Development Board, as a part-time independent director of the company. 

 The move to induct an expert in dairy development on the board is being seen as a step towards a possible diversification into the dairy business.

 Patel has been working in areas like co-operatives, rural management, animal husbandry and ecology and environment and is also the chairman of Mother Dairy Fruit amp; Vegetable Limited.

 Tata Tea officials refused to comment on the implications of the appointment. Patel was travelling and could not be contacted at the NDDB office in Ahmedabad.

 The company, buoyed by recent acquisitions abroad, is reportedly busy implementing its plans for alternative revenue streams like dairy business, food products and fisheries.

 Tata Tea had appointed consultancy firm Globally Managed Services to evaluate its prospects in non-agro alternative revenue streams.

 Tata Tea was earlier trying to balance its domestic growth and long-term sustainability of the plantations business through a foray into vegetables, floriculture and herbs and medicinal plants.

 However no estimate could be made as to the impact of such forays on the topline and bottomline growth. Managing director Percy Siganporia had said the alternative revenue model business would be more profitable than the tea business, which is on the upward curve like in Assam.

 Tata Tea was also looking at offloading stake in its north Indian plantation operations (NIPO).

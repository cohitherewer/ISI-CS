 Reliance grounds GMR claim

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 13: Reliance Airport Developers today accused GMR of misleading the government while bagging the Delhi airport modernisation contract as it concealed its tainted international track record at the time of bidding.

 Reliance counsel Mukul Rohtagi told Delhi High Court that the GMR-Fraport combine made a false disclosure at the time of the bidding that the consortium was not involved in any criminal misconduct or fraud.

 He maintained before a bench comprising Justice T. Thakur and Justice B.N. Chaturvedi that the GMR-Fraport was accorded the highest technical ratings by the evaluation committee based on the expertise claimed by Fraport in the construction of the Manila and Frankfurt airports.

 However, Reliance submitted in the court certain materials claiming that the Supreme Court of Manila had annulled the contract awarded to Fraport for the construction of the Manila international airport.

 It was stated that the contract for Manila airport was annulled on the allegations that Fraport was involved in various irregularities.

 Similarly, it was alleged that Fraport was facing criminal proceedings with regard to the construction of the Uzbekistan airport.

 Rohtagi also alleged that the chief executive officer of Fraport was facing criminal cases in Germany for bribery and financial misconduct.

 Rohtagi pointed out that the combine got the highest technical points from the technical evaluation committee based on the claim made for the construction of the two international airports

 It was contended that the additional 0.5 points awarded to the consortium on the claim of the previous expertise eventually resulted in the combine bagging the contracts.

 However, at this stage, Justice Thakur intervened and wondered whether the arguments were sustainable since Reliance, too, was accused of financial irregularities on various issues.

 Rohtagi also argued that the two-member group of eminent technical experts, which awarded the final technical points, was also not competent to judge the issue.

 Earlier, additional solicitor-general Gopal Subramaniam submitted in the court the Centres reply to the petition filed by Reliance Limited.

 The arguments would continue tomorrow.

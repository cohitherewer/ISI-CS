 OneIndia users to gain from ISD rate cut

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 8: State-owned telecom behemoth Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) today pruned its international long distance (ISD) call rates to Rs 6 per minute with a pulse rate of 10 seconds.

 However, the rates are applicable to the subscribers of BSNLs OneIndia tariff plan.

 The public sector telecom service provider said under the new tariffs, ISD calls to the US, the UK and Canada would cost Rs 6 a minute against Rs 7.20 per minute under its other plans. 

 The rates for Europe (other than the UK), Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and Hong Kong will now be cheaper by Rs 1.60 a minute. The new rate is Rs 8 a minute with 7.5 seconds pulse, down from the existing Rs 9.60 per minute. 

 Making calls to other parts of the world under BSNLs OneIndia tariff plan also becomes cheaper by Rs 2 ? to Rs 10 per minute with six seconds pulse from Rs 12 earlier. 

 The new ISD rates are effective from March 1. The ISD rates under OneIndia tariff plan are 17 per cent lower than the rates under BSNLs other tariff plans in both the fixed and mobile segments, a company statement said. 

 The company also claimed that the rates are the lowest in the market. It said the international long distance call rates offered by other operators are calculated on a per-minute pulse and thus works out to be 20-25 per cent higher than BSNLs.

 BSNL has also revised the pulse rates for its dial-up Internet connection for subscribers under the OneIndia plan. The pulse rates during off-peak hours ? between 10.30 pm and 7.30 am ? has been brought down to 750 seconds from the existing 900 seconds, while the peak hour rates have been brought down to 375 seconds from the existing 450 seconds.

 Meanwhile, the surge in new telecom subscribers number continued during February with an addition of 4.55 million phones, taking the total connections in the country to 135.5 million. This translates into a teledensity of 12.1 per cent.

 Almost the entire growth is attributable to the mobile telephone segment, with GSM contributing 3.17 million and CDMA accounting for 1.13 million. The additions in the fixed-line segment has been 0.25 million. The maximum growth in the GSM segment has been in the Northeast (16.47 per cent), followed by Assam (9.65 per cent), Bengal (9.43 per cent), Orissa (9.4 per cent), Bihar (8.52 per cent), Rajasthan (8.3 per cent) and Andhra Pradesh (8.03 per cent).

 However, the growth of subscriber base in the CDMA segment was lower at 5.08 per cent with a net addition of 1.35 million subscribers. Delhi, Mumbai, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Karnataka are the major contributors.

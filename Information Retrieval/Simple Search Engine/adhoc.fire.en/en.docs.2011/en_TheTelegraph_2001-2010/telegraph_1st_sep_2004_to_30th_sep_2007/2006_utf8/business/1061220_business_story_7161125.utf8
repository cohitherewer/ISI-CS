 BPCL ready to take on Indian Oil 

 S.P.S PANNU 

 Hard at work

 New Delhi, Dec. 19: Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL), with the completion of its product pipeline to Delhi, has strengthened its sinews to take on Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) in the lucrative northern market. 

 The 775-km pipeline has cost the company Rs 807 crore and will enable it to transport 2.2 million tonnes of petrol, diesel and jet fuel a year directly to Delhi from its Mumbai refinery. 

 BPCL had, until now, been dependent on IOC for lifting these transport fuels to its petrol pumps in the north.

 IOC, which has refineries at Mathura and Panipat, supplies both BPCL and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL)-owned filling stations in the northern region.

 This is part of the nation-wide product exchange arrangement the public sector companies have among themselves, which entitles them to lift products from each others refineries to feed their retail outlets. 

 However, both HPCL and BPCL have been complaining that IOC gives first preference to its own retail outlets. This tends to put HPCL and BPCL at a relative disadvantage vis--vis IOC, especially when there is fierce competition in the retail market. 

 While IOC, along with its subsidiary, sells a little more then half the petroleum products sold by the public sector companies, the rest of the market is shared more or less equally between HPCL and BPCL.

 Although the product sharing arrangement has by and large been working well, fierce competition to increase their market share is making these companies look for greater efficiencies.

 With the introduction of premium petrol and diesel brands, BPCL will find it easier to market its product with access to its own refinery.

 BPCL was one of the first public sector companies off the block with innovative marketing schemes that had seen an increase in its market share in the retail segment. 

 The pure for sure slogan and its cash card schemes had made the company popular even in the north, although it does not have any refinery in the region.

 Reliance Industries, which has mainly concentrated its retail network to market petrol and diesel in Gujarat and Maharashtra, was also keen to spread its outlets to the north through the use of depots of public sector oil companies. 

 However, the government-owned companies did not want a private firm complicating their arrangements.

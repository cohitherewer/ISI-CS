 New connection

 Calcutta, Dec. 3: MobileNXT Teleservices Pvt Ltd is set to launch the first organised retail format for mobile telephony in India. The format will comprise a range of solutions including sales, servicing, exchange and value-added services. The company will open 170 stores by the end of next year in 114 cities across the country.

 The company already has 16 outlets in Gurgaon, Mangalore, Ahmedabd, Calcutta, Hyderabad, Mumbai, Hubli, Bangalore, Mysore and Ghaziabad.

 Around 8 per cent of a persons wallet is spent on connectivity and we want to expand our offering portfolio to be able to provide services at every juncture. We will follow three retail models to spread our stores all over the country. The first would be MobileNXT stores owned and managed by us. We have already made alliances with leading retail chains such as the Tatas Star India Bazaar and Shoppers Stop and are discussing with the other leading players for shop in shop formats. We are likely to surpass our target of 31 stores across the country by the end of March 2007, said Romy Juneja, co-founder and chief operating officer of MobileNXT Teleservices. 

 The company, which was formed in March this year, is expecting a turnover of Rs 45 crore for the first fiscal and expects to become a Rs 250-crore firm with around 200 stores by early 2008. Backed by a consortium of investors, the company is also looking at raising $8 million through private equity players for retail expansion.

 We have spoken informally to a couple of them and they are excited about the model and the results of the first nine months. There will be formal meetings in the coming weeks and we should formalise the exact amount and the name of the player within the next month, Juneja said.

 MobileNXT will also be the first to set up stores within corporate offices.

 New Delhi, Jan. 4: Financial service provider IDBI has drawn up a major diversification plan to test uncharted territories. The financial institution is planning to foray into commodity futures trading, dealing in debt instruments and retail asset management.

 We are setting up a separate subsidiary for the commodity futures trading. The companys board has already approved the plan and we are awaiting the nod from the Reserve Bank, said S. Muhnot, CEO of IDBI Capital.

 Muhnot said the IDBI subsidiary would facilitate commodities trading both for proprietary and retail investors.

 The issue of allowing banks, mutual funds and foreign institutional investors to trade in the commodity futures markets is under consideration of the government and the RBI. The commodities futures market is expected to get a major boost with the government planning to amend the Forward Contract (Regulation) Act. The amendment bill contains proposals for setting up of a Forward Markets Appellate Tribunal on the lines of Security Appellate Tribunal set up under the Sebi Act. 

 It will also pave the way for the creation of an options market for commodities. 

 Commodity futures trading has increased manifold, especially after the setting up of the three national multi-commodity exchanges. Commodity futures trade value has increased from Rs 34,495 crore in 2001-02 to Rs 7,80,000 crore at the end of September last year.

 IDBI has also applied to RBI and Sebi for setting up a separate asset management company and is hopeful that the AMC would be operational by mid-2006.

 IDBI Capital, the merchant banking arm of IDBI, today launched an online investment portal, www.idbipaisabuilder.in, to provide information, analysis and tips to retail investors to help them invest in initial public offers, equities and mutual funds. 

 Idbipaisabuilder.in is for the retail investors who have missed out the stock market boom. The site will concentrate on helping them in right decision making by minimising risk involved in equity investment, said Muhnot.

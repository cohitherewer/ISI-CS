 Hyundai slips on sales target

 Gearing up

 Seoul, Dec. 29 (Reuters): Hyundai Motor Co missed its sales target for this year, hit by unionised workers strikes, Kim Dong-jin, the companys vice-chairman and CEO said.

 Hyundai sold an estimated 2.5 million cars this year, lower than the companys target of 2.69 million, according to Jake Jang, a Hyundai spokesman. Kim said strikes in 2006 cost the company about 115,000 vehicles or 1.5 trillion won ($1.61 billion) in lost output.

 Although sales missed the companys target, Hyundais sales in 2006 are seen up 5.35 per cent to 28.85 trillion won, according to 27 analysts polled by Reuters Estimates.

 But Hyundais net profit for the year is expected to fall by more than a third to 1.52 trillion from 2.31 trillion won in 2005.

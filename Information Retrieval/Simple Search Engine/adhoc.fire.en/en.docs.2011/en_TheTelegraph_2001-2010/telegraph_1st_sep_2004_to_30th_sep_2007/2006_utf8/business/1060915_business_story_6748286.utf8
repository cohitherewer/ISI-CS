 Duncan on sickbed 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Goenka: Worried

 Calcutta, Sept. 14: Duncan Industries has been referred to the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR) after the GP Goenka group flagship eroded its entire net worth.

 The company suffered a blow of Rs 446.95 crore during the last fiscal following the Supreme Courts adverse judgment on a case related to fertiliser subsidy and its net loss stood at Rs 954.41 crore as on March 31, 2006.

 The companys balance sheet showed a negative net current asset of Rs 239.39 crore on March 31, 2006 after it suffered a loss of Rs 798.9 crore in the last fiscal over a turnover of Rs 173.36 crore.

 After the board of directors decided to refer the company to the BIFR, the Board was approached at the end of August, Duncan chairman G.P. Goenka said at the companys annual general meeting today.

 Duncan has two divisions tea and fertiliser.

 The fertiliser division, which, contributed three-fourth of Duncans business, is closed since March 2002 following shortage of working capital.

 Duncan was claiming subsidy worth Rs 446.95 crore from the Centre under the retention price subsidy scheme. It moved a special leave petition in the Supreme Court after losing the case at Allahabad High Court. However, the apex court disallowed its petition in February.

 I think we had a good case. But dont know what went wrong, Goenka said.

 BIFR will now appoint an operating agency for the company. The Duncan management will have to prepare a revival scheme and submit it to the agency.

 Incidentally, the company is now in the midst of a financial restructuring under the corporate debt restructuring (CDR) mechanism. Under the scheme, Duncan will issue cumulative redeemable preference shares to its lenders. 

 Goenka, however, expressed doubt whether it would be possible to implement the CDR scheme since the companys mainstay the fertiliser division is closed.

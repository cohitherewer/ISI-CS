 Calcutta, March 27: Ningbo Bird Company Ltd, Chinas largest mobile phone manufacturing firm, is open to the idea of setting up a manufacturing base in Bengal.

 A trade delegation from the Ningbo Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation Bureau, accompanied by officials from the Indian Chamber of Commerce, has held discussions with the Bengal industry secretary in this regard.

 Since Ningbo is the base for Bird Company, we also spoke about improving business with Bird during our discussions. It could initially facilitate the existing trade relations and the ultimate aim for Bird would be to set up a manufacturing base in the state, Li Xinhua, vice-director of Ningbo Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation Bureau, said here today.

 Now that the delegation has visited Calcutta, Xinhua said it provide inputs to Bird Companys officials.

 The delegation from Ningbo also discussed the possibility of setting up an environment-friendly battery-operated motorbike unit here. Such bikes are very popular in Ningbo and the city has years of experience and expertise in this sector.

 We feel that a rapidly developing city like Calcutta requires such motorbikes to keep pollution in check, Xinhua said.

 In recent times, Bengal has witnessed a slew of investments in the two-wheeler segment ? Guangzhou Motors Company and Indonesias Salim Group have already committed to invest in the state.

 The bilateral trade figures between India and Ningbo stood at $654 million last year with imports from India aggregating $376 million and exports to India at $278 million.

 India exports iron ore, steel and plastics, while Ningbos strength lies in garments, home appliances, electronic items and has one of the largest manufacturing facility for liquid crystal display (LCD) screens.

 This trade delegations visit is a follow-up to industry minister Nirupam Sens trip to China, which included Ningbo in the itinerary. 

 Other than Calcutta, the Chinese delegation has visited New Delhi and would now be travelling to Karachi.

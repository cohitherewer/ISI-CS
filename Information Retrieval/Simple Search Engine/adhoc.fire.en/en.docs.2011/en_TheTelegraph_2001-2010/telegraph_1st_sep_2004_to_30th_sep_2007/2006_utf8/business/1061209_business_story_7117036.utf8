 Oracle ready to pay more for i-flex shares

 OUR BUREAU

 Dec. 8: Oracle Corp, the California-based database and application software company, has raised its offer price for i-flex shares by 42 per cent to Rs 2,100 per share. Oracle intends to purchase up to 28.39 lakh shares for Rs 5,961 crore. The revised offer is for close to 34 per cent of i-flexs equity.

 Back in September, Oracle had come out with an open offer to acquire 20 per cent of the company at a price of Rs 1,475 per share. It then held 55 per cent in i-flex. The revised offer will close on December 23.

 The offer came only a month after i-flex announced that it would be issuing 4.447 million shares to Oracle Global (Mauritius) on a preferential basis at a price of Rs 1,307.50 per share aggregating Rs 581.4 crore. This was to finance i-flexs acquisition of Mantas Inc, a provider of anti-money laundering compliance software and services. 

 The company acquired Mantas Inc of the US in an all-cash deal worth $122.6 million through wholly-owned US subsidiary i-flex America Inc.

 Prior to the preferential issue, Oracle held 52.5 per cent in i-flex. In August last year, Oracle announced the acquisition of a 41 per cent stake from Citigroup and in December concluded the deal for over $900 million.

 In a public announcement issued today, DSP Merrill Lynch on behalf of Oracle Global (Mauritius) and Oracle Corp said the revised offer is for the acquisition of up to 28.39 lakh shares. It includes an offer price of Rs 2,084 each, along with an interest of Rs 16 per share for the delay in the offer, which translates into a total of Rs 2,100 per share.

 The revised offer from Oracle resulted in i-flex shares hitting a over three-year high on the bourses today. On the BSE, the scrip closed at Rs 2,048.80, a massive gain of 17.01 per cent or Rs 297.80 from its previous close.

 Oracle today said the price of Rs 2,100 per share is the highest to be paid by it. CEO Larry Ellison said, There will not be another open offer and Oracle will not undertake a delisting for at least the next five years unless i-flex shares are selling at a significantly lower prices than they are today.

 Calcutta, Aug. 29: With a marginally better outlook on tea exports in 2006, India is banking heavily on Iran, Egypt and Pakistan.

 A delegation will visit Egypt and Iran between September 8 and 14, 2006.

 We would be accompanied by representatives from Tata Tea, Harrisons Malayalam and many other companies on our visit to Iran and Egypt. We will also discuss the opening of tea marketing centres in Cairo and Tehran, Tea Board chairman Basudeb Banerjee said.

 However, the dates for the Pakistan visit have not been finalised.

 A delegation from the Iran Tea Association, which visited the city in July, said the Iranian health ministry plans to implement a plant master file system to check the credentials of exporters and good manufacturing practices.

 The delegation has advised Indian exporters to submit details at the earliest so as not to be barred from exports. Banerjee said the delegation would also discuss issues related to the plant master file system.

 The Iranian government is planning a new import policy, which would reduce duty but would require the importer to blend the imported tea with a minimum amount of the indigenous variety.

 The Indian Tea Association (ITA) has written to the embassies and would also hold talks with prospective local partners, who will take on the responsibility of the centres in Tehran and Cairo.

 The ITA has forecast exports of 195 million kg in 2006. Around 192 million kg were exported in 2005.

 Around 5.3 million kg were exported between January and November 2005 against 4.51 million kg during the same period in 2004.

 The unit price, however, decreased from Rs 117.41 per kg to Rs 107.43 per kg.

 Exports to Egypt have improved during the same period from 0.10 million kg to 0.18 million kg. The unit price has also significantly increased from Rs 34 per kg to Rs 51.11 per kg.

 The ITA status paper has also forecast an increase in domestic consumption from 780 million kg in 2005 to 805 million kg in 2006.

 Calcutta, July 19: The Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) is willing to offer sops to win over the Jharkhand government and resolve the conflict over Chiria mines.

 The company has offered to set up a committee with representatives from Jharkhand for community development programmes in the state, especially around the mines.

 ?We want them (Jharkhand) to tell what they want from us,? SAIL chairman V.S. Jain said.

 The company is locked in a battle with the state government over Chiria iron ore mines, which have high-quality deposits.

 SAIL has six blocks with reserves of 1.4 billion tonnes from its merger with erstwhile Indian Iron and Steel Company Ltd (IISCO).

 Jharkhand did not want to renew the lease of two of the blocks and threatened criminal proceedings against the company.

 It is believed that the state wants to distribute some of the blocks to private players like Mittal Steel and Tata Steel, who want to set up new plants in Jharkhand.

 To placate the state government, SAIL has announced a big-buck investment for a 5-million-tonne greenfield plant in Bokaro. The steel firm already has a plant there.

 The company now wants to take up social initiatives ? school and hospitals ? to woo the government.

 ?Earlier, we thought of building infrastructure for our employees only. Now we are considering extending these facilities to others as well,? he said.

 Jain made it clear that SAIL would not give up the control of Chiria.

 ?Chiria is important for us. SAIL is a national company with plants across the country. The existing and future requirements should be kept in mind by all,? Jain added.

 Chiria mines, located in the west Singhbhum district, are important for SAIL plants in Bokaro, Durgapur and Burnpur.

 SAIL has earmarked an investment of Rs 1,800 crore for the first phase of Chiria.

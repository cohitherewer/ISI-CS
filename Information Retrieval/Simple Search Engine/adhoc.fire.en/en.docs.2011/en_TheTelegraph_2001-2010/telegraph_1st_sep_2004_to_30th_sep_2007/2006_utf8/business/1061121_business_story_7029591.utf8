 London says no to Nasdaq

 Hard to get

 London, Nov. 20 (Reuters): US stock exchange Nasdaq today launched a 2.7-billion ($5.1 billion) offer for the London Stock Exchange to create a trans-Atlantic market, but the bid was rejected as inadequate.

 Nasdaq said the deal would create the worlds biggest exchange by number of listings, including over 6,400 companies with a market value of $11.8 trillion, as well as the most active exchange with an average daily volume of 7.4 billion shares traded. 

 Nasdaq, which had built up a 25 per cent stake after a previous bid was rebuffed, said it was offering 1,243 pence a share in cash for the rest of the company, Europes biggest stock market. 

 The second-biggest US stock exchange also said it had increased its stake to 28.75 per cent by buying a further 7 million LSE shares at 1,243 pence apiece, at a cost of 87.8 million, strengthening its hand against any possible counter-bid. 

 The LSE rejected Nasdaqs latest offer, its second since March. 

 Nasdaqs final offer fails to recognise the outstanding growth record and prospects of our group on a standalone basis let alone the exchanges unique global position, chief executive Clara Furse said in a statement. 

 The move comes as the worlds stock markets are rushing to consolidate, under pressure from customers to cut fees and offer global services, and a group of banks added to the pressure last week by announcing plans to create their own pan-European equity trading platform next year. 

 Competition between established exchanges and alternative platforms would be made possible by the European Unions Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID), which comes into effect next year. 

 The banks initiative has undermined the LSEs value and Nasdaq is using this weakness to strike a deal, said one analyst who declined to be named. 

 Shares in the LSE were up 6.2 per cent at 1,293 pence in midday trade, valuing it at around 3.2 billion. 

 Dealers said the shares were rising on expectations that the LSE may find a white knight to rival Nasdaqs offer or that the LSE board may agree to a higher offer now that increased competition to its exchange is on the cards. 

 Clara Furse (the LSEs chief executive) will be rushing around to find a white knight, maybe OMX or Deutsche Boerse. Or maybe the board will agree to a higher offer, say around 1,300 pence, said one senior dealer in London. 

 The LSE declined to comment but is expected to release a statement via the Regulatory News Service later on Monday. 

 Trans-Atlantic race 

 The race has been on to create the first trans-Atlantic stock exchange. Both Nasdaq and arch-rival NYSE Group Inc, the worlds largest stock exchange, have been pushing for overseas expansion in an effort to boost their product offerings and geographical reach in an increasingly competitive and commoditised industry. 

 While Nasdaq has been building its stake in the LSE, NYSE has been pursuing Paris-based exchange Euronext, a deal it had struck earlier this year, which is awaiting shareholders approval. 

 A source familiar with the matter said Nasdaq took advantage of recent falls in the LSEs valuation to make an offer today.

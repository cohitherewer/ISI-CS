 Deficiencies remain the core problem

 New Delhi, Feb. 27: The Economic Survey highlights the fact that infrastructural inadequacies continue to constrain the countrys full potential for industrial resurgence, attracting more investment and boosting exports.

 Lamenting that infrastructure deficit continues to haunt India, the survey says, The power scenario in the country continues to be a matter of concern. A lack of reliable power supply dampens the growth impulses in different sectors of the economy, it adds. 

 The survey points out that with better management of coal and gas supplies to power plants and implementing the ongoing reforms, electricity generation could improve.

 It observes that the growth of power generation in April-December 2005 at 4.7 per cent was lower than the annual target as well as the 6.5 per cent growth achieved during the same period of the previous year.

 The survey says while progress continued in attracting private investment into infrastructure of telecommunications, ports and airports and there was an increase in the budgetary outlay on roads, the overall investment continued to be far below the required amount.

 The survey projects a dismal picture of power utilities of the states as resources foregone through high losses and poor returns continued to be very large.

 The total commercial losses of state utilities are estimated at a huge Rs 22,569 crore with a negative rate of return of 26.13 per cent in 2005-06. This is, however, less than the losses of Rs 23,558 crore and a rate of return of a negative 31.94 per cent last fiscal.

 Gross subsidy on sales to agriculture, domestic consumers and other states is projected to be Rs 35,632 crore, slightly less than Rs 36,187 crore in 2004-05.

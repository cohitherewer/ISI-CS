 Court landing for airline dispute

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, June 28: The dispute over the failed acquisition of Air Sahara today landed in Supreme Court, with Jet Airways seeking transfer of related litigation in a Lucknow court to Bombay High Court citing jurisdiction issues.

 Apprehending such a move, Air Sahara had already filed a caveat before the apex court yesterday to ensure that it was heard before the court passed any order on the petition by Jet. Let nothing be done in the aforesaid matter without notice to the undersigned, said a caveat filed by advocate E.C. Agrawala for Sahara. 

 Meanwhile, the government today hit back at Jet for blaming it for delays in granting clearances and putting in place related policies. 

 Civil aviation minister Praful Patel said, The policy cannot be tailor-made to suit any particular airline. If someone is dissatisfied, we cannot be held responsible... They are free to approach the government for clarification but the government is not answerable to anyone.

 In its transfer petition, filed by law firm Gagrat and Company, Jet has prayed for a stay on the proceedings of the case filed against it by Sahara in the Lucknow district court till the case is pending. 

 It also raised the issue of jurisdiction, saying the agreement provided for Mumbai as the seat of arbitration between the two parties. 

 Jet also sought to set aside the interim order by the district court restraining it from withdrawing Rs 500 crore from the escrow account. 

 Jet had transferred Rs 500 crore to the escrow account as advance towards the Rs 2,300 crore deal.

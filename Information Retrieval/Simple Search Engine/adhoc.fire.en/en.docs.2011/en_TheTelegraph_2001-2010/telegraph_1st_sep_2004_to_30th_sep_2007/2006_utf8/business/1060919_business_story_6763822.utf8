 Arbitration route for Hutch-Essar dispute

 Mumbai, Sept. 18: The dispute between Hutchison Essar Ltd and the Essar group over BPL Mobile Communications is headed towards arbitration. Both the parties have failed to reach a settlement within a 30-day period given by Bombay High Court.

 While the stipulated deadline for arriving at a settlement ended today, sources close to the development said no proposal was received by either parties to resolve the issue. 

 So far, there has been a status quo. Even on the last day, a proposal has not been received and, therefore, it seems that the matter is headed towards arbitration, sources added.

 They said if the dispute invites arbitration, the tribunal will have three members. While one member each will be appointed by Hutchison Essar and the Essar group, the third member would be selected by both the companies. The tribunal will consider and verify whether the injunction order, restraining Essar from selling BPLs Mumbai circle to a third-party, was valid. 

 On August 10, Justice Nishita Mhatre of Bombay High Court accepted the plea of Hutch for an injunction on the sale of BPL Mobile Communications Ltd (BMCL) shares even as it directed that an arbitration tribunal be set up to resolve the tangle. But the high court today rejected its appeal to grant a stay on the Ruias terminating the sale of BPL (Mumbai) circle. 

 Giving its order on the petition served by Hutchison Essar Ltd (HEL) seeking to restrain the Essar group from selling BPL Mobile to a third-party, Justice Mhatre directed that an arbitration tribunal be set up within 30 days for the settlement of disputes between the Essar group and Hutch.

 The dispute arose after the Ruias terminated the sale of BPL Mobile to HEL. On August 1, the Essar group had called off the deal to sell BPL Mumbai circle to HEL citing absence of necessary government approvals. 

 Bombay High Court had ruled that both the parties can apply to a tribunal within the period of four weeks to continue, modify or vacate the order. 

 Once the arbitration tribunal is set up, it should consider and verify whether the injunction order of restraining Essar from selling BPL Mumbai to a third-party is valid. 

 The share purchase agreement (SPA) did provide for setting up of the tribunal within a period of 30 days from the date of any dispute.

 Bid to cut fertiliser subsidy

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 New Delhi, Aug. 9: The government wants all urea plants to use gas as their raw material within two to five years as subsidy payouts to gas-based units is the lowest. The plants currently use naphtha or fuel oil as their raw material.

 This will help the government cut down the burgeoning fertiliser subsidy bill, for which it had to place a demand for extra grants before Parliament.

 The department of fertiliser wants urea plants on HBJ pipeline to convert to gas as raw material from naphtha within two years. The plants that are away from the pipeline can make the switch within three years and those using fuel oil as raw material can change within five years.

 However, the finance ministry wants to complete the process in two to three years as it feels the mounting fertiliser bill cannot be paid any more. The difficulty lies in tying up gas supplies, especially given the constraints in getting gas from either Iran or Myanmar.

 However, there are apprehensions that the five-year conversion time limit will not be met. Officials said the government will be laying down strict guidelines under which urea companies that are unable to convert to natural gas/LNG within their given time frame will only get the import parity price.

 Import price currently works out to be around Rs 12,000-13,000 a tonne. The domestic cost of making urea from naphtha is around Rs 21,000 a tonne and fuel oil costs about Rs 12,000 a tonne.

 Urea is currently sold at about Rs 4,850 a tonne and the difference between the production cost and sale price is paid as subsidy. If the plants get only the difference between import cost and sale price, plants using naphtha as raw material will lose out significantly.

 The cost of making urea from gas is just about Rs 5,000-6,000 a tonne. As a way out of this mess, the finance ministry and the Planning Commission have long been advocating a flat rate of subsidy for all fertiliser manufacturers. When this happens, it would mean a far lower subsidy bill than the estimated payout of Rs 30,000 crore this fiscal.

 However, urea makers have told the government that it would cost them about Rs 400 crore to switch from fuel oil to gas as feedstock and Rs 100 crore to convert from naphtha to gas. A section of the government is in favour of giving some sops to help them meet this cost.

 Wake-up call for operators

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 17: The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) today asked telecom firms to improve junction connectivity and cautioned against an increase in call drop rates because of network congestion.

 With the exponential increase in the subscriber base every month, the congestion level at the points of interconnect (PoI) in inter-operator networks continues to be a major reason for poor quality of service in mobile networks, Trai said in its report.

 According to the existing norms, the benchmark for PoI congestion should be less than 0.5 per cent. This will restrict the congestion problem to only one call of the 200 made between two operators.

 But it is observed that the performance of all mobile operators with respect to congestion of PoIs has deteriorated, Trai said.

 Congestion in the network occurs due to inadequate junctions between networks, leading to frequent blocking of calls and poor quality of service to subscribers. The report shows that at 404 PoIs, the level of congestion is more than the benchmark 0.5 per cent.

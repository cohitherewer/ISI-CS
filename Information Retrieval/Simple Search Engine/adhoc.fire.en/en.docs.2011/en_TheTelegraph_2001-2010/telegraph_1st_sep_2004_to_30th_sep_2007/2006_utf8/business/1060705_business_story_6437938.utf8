 Calcutta, July 4: The ministry of company affairs will introduce the limited liability partnership bill during the monsoon session of Parliament.

 Announcing this at a seminar organised by the Indian Chamber of Commerce here today, company affairs minister Prem Chand Gupta said, However, the Companies (Amendment) Bill 2006 will be introduced only during the winter session and we expect to implement the new, simplified companies act by the middle of 2007. 

 The revised companies act will have less than 400 provisions against 786 now. However, it will implement the Irani Committees recommendation on independent directors on the boards of companies, Gupta said.

 The Irani Committee has recommended that one-third members on a companys board should be independent, while the Sebi is insisting on 50 per cent independent directors according to Clause 49 of the listing agreement.

 He also said there was no disharmony between the Sebi and the department of company affairs as they operate in separate domains. Sebi deals with listed companies, while DCA with unlisted firms.

 Talking about the limited liability partnership bill, Gupta said, It would benefit small and medium scale enterprises more than large companies because a partnership would help them reap the benefits enjoyed by private limited companies.

 The ministry would go slow on implementing its landmark MCA-21 project, a corporate e-governance project for filing documents, as technical and domain-related problems have surfaced during its pilot-run in Delhi last March, Gupta added.

 Though the ministry has already implemented the project at 12 out of 20 offices of the Registrar of Companies, further implementation will be on hold for some time.

 Tata Consultancy Services has been appointed to implement, manage and operate the MCA-21 for a period of six years.

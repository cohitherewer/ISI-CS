Mumbai, Dec. 21: The race for Hutchison Essar Ltd (HEL) could escalate into a full-fledged bidding war. 

 UK-based Vodafone Group Plc, the worlds biggest telecom company, is set to make a $14-billion bid for Hutchisons 67 per cent in Hutchison Essar. 

 Vodafones manoeuvres come as Reliance Communications along with Blackstone plan to mount a $17-billion pitch for Hutch-Essar, while Maxis Communications Bhd of Malaysia separately finalises a proposal.

 Chances of a Vodafone bid improved with reports of a possible board meeting today in London over the offer that is estimated to be $13.5-14 billion. Vodafone will not buy 100 per cent of Hutch Essar as regulations bar a foreign company from picking up more than 74 per cent.

 The Reliance-Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group (R-ADAG) is also going full throttle. 

 While Reliance Communications is understood to have formally informed both Hutchison and the Essar group about its bid for 100 per cent of Hutch-Essar, unconfirmed reports also said the Reliance-Blackstone combine has asked banks to lend almost $15 billion for the purchase.

 Reliance Communications officials, however, said they had no knowledge of such a formal bid.

 The other contender is Maxis Communications. 

 Sources said the Malaysian company, which owns 75 per cent of Indias Aircel Ltd, will table its formal bid in the next few days.

 Maxis had earlier made an unsuccessful $13.5-billion bid for Hutch-Essar along with US private equity firm Texas Pacific Group. 

 It is now learnt that the company has appointed a leading foreign bank as its adviser and that its offer could be in the region of $14 billion.

 There are also speculations of Maxis teaming up with Reliance Communications for Hutch-Essar. The process could involve the merger of Aircel with Reliance Communications, with Maxis getting shares in Reliance. 

 Observers said the entry of Vodafone could make it tougher for Anil Ambani. The group has deep pockets and it wants a larger say in Indias telecom story rather than be content with the 10 per cent stake in Bharti, an analyst said.

 Vodafone had last year picked up 10 per cent in Bharti Airtel. It bought 4.39 per cent in the company through Bharti Enterprises Pvt Ltd and a 5.61 per cent direct stake from Warburg Pincus LLC.

 However, when contacted, Ben Padovan, a spokesperson of Vodafone, told The Telegraph from London that the group will not comment on whether its board is meeting to decide on a possible bid for Hutch-Essar. 

 However, the buzz is that Vodafone could make a formal announcement early next week.

 Analysts add that it will not be smooth going for Vodafone either, as there is a non-compete clause with Bharti Enterprises which prevents investment in a competing company. 

 However, it is unlikely that Sunil Mittal, who heads the Bharti group, will object to Vodafones plans.

 Brokerage CLSA has in a report said a bid of $13.5-14 billion from Vodafone could value Hutchison Essar at a 24 per cent premium to Bharti, which has a market capitalisation of $ 25.7 billion.

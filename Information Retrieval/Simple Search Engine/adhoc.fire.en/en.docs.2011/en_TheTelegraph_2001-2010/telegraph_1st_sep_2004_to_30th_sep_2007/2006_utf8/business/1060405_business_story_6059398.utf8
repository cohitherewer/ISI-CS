 Oil, bank join sensex party

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, April 4: Energised by FIIs and mutual funds, the sensex today hurled past the 11700-mark in intra-day trade. Analysts said the sensex was set to mount an assault on peak 12000.

 Though profit-taking did cut gains, the bellwether index closed at an all-time high of 11638.01.

 The spirited buying, that came after investors booked profits at higher levels, took place in bank and oil stocks. The two sectors did not figure in the recent bull surge. Brokers said the positive finish indicated that there was still a lot of steam in the market. 

 While profit-taking did lead to some concern that a major correction is on the anvil, the buying in banking and oil counters shows that investors are rotating their portfolios, an analyst added.

 The market is now waiting for the sensex to cross the 12000-mark. Though analysts are hesitant in predicting the day, they are certain the sensex will hit 12000. What caused the index to touch 11500, the same thing will take it to 12000, a portfolio manager said. 

 An end to the bull run was unlikely since FIIs were still hooked to the India growth story, while mutual funds were turning more aggressive, the portfolio manager said. 

 After opening on a positive note at 11599.80, the 30-share BSE sensex touched a new intra-day peak of 11710.69. It, however, slipped to a low of 11570.11, a fall of 141 points, before buying in banking and oil counters lifted the key index to close at 11638.01, a net gain of 73.65 points or 0.64 per cent over yesterdays close.

 The buoyant mood in other parts of Asia also rubbed off on the sensex: Japans Nikkei touched a six-year high; Hong Kongs Hang Seng hit a five-year peak, while the China Shanghai index clambered to a 16-month high. The sentiment got an extra lift on expectations of high profit earnings from market movers such as Infosys, RIL, ICICI Bank, ITC and State Bank of India.

 HDFC Bank was the star performer as it notched up a huge gain of 8 per cent to end at Rs 831.30. Other bank counters that prospered were Indian Overseas Bank and Bank of Maharashtra. In the oil pack, both HPCL and BPCL gained by around 5 per cent.

Rupee turns weak

 The rupee today turned weak against the greenback due to heavy dollar demand from oil companies and importers after a fresh rise in world crude prices. The Indian currency settled at 44.72 per dollar. Steady foreign portfolio investment inflow into the Indian stock markets continued today.

 At the Interbank Foreign Exchange market, the Indian unit started the day firm at 44.57 per dollar on sustained inflow. However, it turned sharply weak towards the end and closed at Rs 44.71/72 per dollar, sharply lower than the previous close of 44.60.

 World oil prices rose above the $67 per barrel as the light sweet crude for May delivery settled 11 cents higher at $66.74 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange yesterday.

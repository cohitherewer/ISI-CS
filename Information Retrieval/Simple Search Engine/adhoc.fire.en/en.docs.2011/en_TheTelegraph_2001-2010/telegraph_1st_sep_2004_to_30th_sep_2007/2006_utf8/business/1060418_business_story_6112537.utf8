 Oil trio in a fix over Reliance overture

 S.P.S. PANNU 

 Refill factor

 New Delhi, April 17: Public sector oil companies are in a bind over Reliance?s proposal to join their product-sharing network that lets them access each other?s refineries for supplying petrol, diesel and lubricants to their petrol pumps.

 The three PSU majors ? Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum ? have petrol pumps spread across the country but their refineries are located only in some regions.

 Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum, which have no refineries in north India, pick up petroleum products from IOC?s refineries at Mathura and Panipat for their retail outlets in the north.

 In the west, Indian Oil picks up products from Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum?s refineries in Mumbai, while in the south Hindustan Petroleum?s Vizag refinery, IOC?s Chennai refinery and Bharat Petroleum?s Kochi refinery cater to all the petrol pumps in the region.

 Since all the three companies are owned by the government, it is not difficult to sustain the network as they share a common vision. Not so for Reliance Industries, which is a private concern with different aims and objectives.

 Public sector oil industry executives feel entering into a product-sharing arrangement with Reliance will result in falling sales from their own outlets.

 To feed its expanding chain, Reliance is looking beyond its limited product-sharing arrangement with the PSUs and is keen to access more products from the three companies. At present, Reliance has only one refinery of 33 million tonnes (mt) at Jamnagar in Gujarat.

 IOC has a quid pro quo agreement with Reliance based on the ?tonne for tonne? principal ? the PSU picks up one tonne of petroleum from Reliance for every tonne accessed by Reliance. 

 However, Indian Oil has a refinery at Koyali in Gujarat so its requirements from Reliance is not significant.

 Reliance, on the other hand, wants much more for its outlets. It claims that it is also supplying the public sector oil companies with LPG and kerosene and, therefore, should be allowed to pick up more petrol and diesel. 

 The limited arrangement was reached following a meeting at the petroleum ministry between the four companies. 

 Senior petroleum ministry officials feel the PSU companies should arrive at a decision based on their own commercial considerations.

 The PSU majors have efficiently exploited the economies of scale in the product-sharing agreement that has made them a formidable force in petroleum marketing. This agreement has even proved to be a deterrent to multinationals like Shell to enter the market as they are apprehensive of their ability to compete with the network.

 New Delhi, July 9: The country?s top realty players are keen on joint ventures with foreign partners to speed up the process of implementing their plans.

 DLF Universal Ltd, which is venturing into special economic zones and the hospitality business, is negotiating a tie-up with a leading player from the US, said a senior official. ?Nothing has been finalised yet, but a lot depends on what each player brings to the table,? he said. DLF seems to have ruled out joint ventures in its existing line of business.

 The company has joined hands with Liang O?Rourke to raise up to $1.5 billion for its residential, retail and commercial businesses.

 The Delhi-based firm has acquired 24 hotel sites and is in parleys with possible partners to operate as well as pick up stakes in the business, officials said.

 DLF has prepared a $2-2.5-billion budget to foray into the hospitality segment. It is also negotiating to set up around 20 more hotels.

 Industry sources said global players are also interested in the booming realty market. Many US and European firms, including Black Stone and HRO, are in search for a local partner.

 Sources said US real estate developer and investor Tishman Speyer ? the owner of New York Times Building and Rockefeller Center ? is aggressively pursuing its India plans.

 Tishman Speyer and the private venture arm of ICICI Banking Corp had announced a joint venture in January to invest more than $1 billion over the next 3-5 years. The investments would focus on both office and residential properties, sources said.

 Apollo Real Estate Advisors LP is raising $500 million to invest in Indian properties.

 International players are raising funds along with local players, said sources.

 Another Delhi-based real estate player, Parsvnath Developers, is trying to forge links with foreign partners to generate funds and get technology for its residential, commercial and office projects.

 A senior Parsvnath official said, ?Real-estate investors worldwide are searching for ways to diversify their holdings and boost returns, and therefore are increasingly looking at India. Real estate is a local business. We have the local expertise. We require to push our cash flow and the technology know-how.?

 Industry sources said Unitech Ltd and a foreign player are negotiating for a tie-up and an announcement is expected in the next 3-4 months. However, a Unitech spokesperson declined to comment.

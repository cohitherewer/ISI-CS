 Market regulator relaxes PAN rules

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, July 20: The Securities and Exchange Board of India today relaxed the mandatory requirement of permanent account number (PAN) for certain categories of entities operating in the equity market on operational grounds.

 All entities registered with Sebi and having some difficulty in producing PAN card for verification at the time of opening the beneficiary owner (BO) account can now open such accounts without producing a PAN card.

 However, such entities have been asked to submit the PAN card to the depository participants (DPs) within a period of 30 days from the date of opening of the BO account for verification. If this is not done, the DPs shall freeze such accounts as suspended for debit till the PAN card is produced.

 In case non-resident Indians and persons of Indian origin are unable to obtain a PAN card and hold securities in physical form, Sebi has permitted them to open a limited purpose BO account without PAN. These accounts can remain operational only for six months from the date of opening the account.

 For Hindu undivided family, association of persons, partnership firms and unregistered trusts, though the BO account would be in the name of natural persons, PAN of the respective entities shall be obtained, Sebi said.

 As regards registered trusts, corporate bodies and minors, Sebi stated that PAN of the respective entities should be obtained when accounts are opened in their respective names.

 For investors residing in Sikkim, the PAN is exempted as a mandatory requirement subject to depository participants verifying that the investors are residents of Sikkim by collecting sufficient documentary evidence in support of their address.

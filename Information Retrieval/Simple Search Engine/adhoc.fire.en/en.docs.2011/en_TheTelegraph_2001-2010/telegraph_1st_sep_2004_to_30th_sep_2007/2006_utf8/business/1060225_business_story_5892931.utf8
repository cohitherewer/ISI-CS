 Posco promotes Orissa helmsmen

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, Feb. 24: Posco today promoted two of its senior officials in-charge of setting up the 12-million-tonne steel plant in Jagatsinghpur, reflecting the significance it accords to the project. The company, however, continues to face opposition to the project. 

 At the end of its 38th shareholders meeting held at the Posco Centre in Seoul, the management announced the appointment of Posco India managing director Soung-Sik Cho as a standing director on the board of Posco. Cho, who joined Posco in 1974, has also been promoted as a senior executive vice-president of the company. 

 Tae-Hyun Jeong, deputy managing director of Posco-India, has been promoted as a vice-president of Posco.

 This is the first time in Poscos history that the head of an overseas subsidiary has been appointed as a board member, a move that reflects the significance of the Orissa project, said Ryu Ho Chan, senior general manager of Posco India.

 On Thursday, hundreds of women activists locked the Revenue Inspectors office at Nuagaon Circle, demanding cancellation of the memorandum of understanding signed with Posco.

 On Wednesday, too, thousands of women held demonstrations at the Gadakujanga village when panchayatiraj minister and local MLA Damodar Rout and revenue minister Manmohan Samal were conducting an awareness campaign in support of Posco.

 Posco said the steel plant in Orissa would have an economic impact of a whopping Rs 12,33,208 crore, if taxes and royalty incomes for the central as well as state governments are taken into account.

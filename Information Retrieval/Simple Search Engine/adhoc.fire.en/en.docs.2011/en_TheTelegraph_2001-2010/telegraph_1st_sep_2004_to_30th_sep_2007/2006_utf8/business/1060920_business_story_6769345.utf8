 Govt move to exit Hind Zinc

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 19: The government may sell its rump shareholding in Hindustan Zinc to the public. 

 The government holds about 29.53 per cent equity in Hind Zinc and the estimated price of this holding is believed to be about Rs 7,000 crore. The management control of this zinc firm was sold in two tranches to Sterlite in 2002 and 2003 and it can exercise the call option next year. 

 The governments hurry to sell the rump stake in Hindustan Zinc stems from attorney-generals ruling that any call or put option inserted in sale agreements entered into by the government was in accordance with the letter of the countrys company law.

 The AGs ruling had come in the case of Sterlite trying to buy the governments rump holdings in Bharat Aluminium Company Ltd. 

 The government clearly wants to avoid the embarrassment of companies calling upon it, seeking to buy out rump shares. A section within the government feels that the only way to avoid such a situation is to sell the rump shares before the call option date. However, others feel, since the option itself is illegal, there is no need for the government to sell, unless it is required for a specific purpose. 

 The Congress government has already decided to stall the sale of its remaining 49 per cent stake in Bharat Aluminium Company to Sterlite Industries and return a cheque for Rs 1,098.89 crore which the company had sent to the government seeking to buy out shares. 

 The decision to return the cheque to Sterlite was taken at a meeting of the cabinet committee on economic affairs (CCEA) and was based on a report of the comptroller and auditor general which stated that the original sale of a controlling interest in Balco for Rs 550 crore was undervalued. The entire matter is now caught in a web of litigation. 

 However, any move by the government to prevent Sterlite from buying further into HZL may not really impact the metals firm as it already controls 64 per cent in the former public sector unit.

 Mumbai, May 10: There should be an open auction of the newly vacated spectrum, according to Darryl Green, CEO of Tata Teleservices Ltd (TTSL). 

 Earlier, Tata Group chairman Ratan Tata had said he was not in favour of spectrum allocation based on subscriber figures as it benefited telecom companies which started early. 

 Why should they give away spectrum (without fee)? An open auction of spectrum will enable payment to the people who are vacating it (example: the defence forces), Green said.

 Green feels the government should inform service providers about the amount of spectrum that would be allocated to them. This will enable them to utilise the available spectrum better.

 Maximum spectrum in the country is still held by the defence forces. As and when they vacate the spectrum, the government can allocate the same to other players who need it.

 The government allots additional spectrum based on a subscriber-linked criteria, keeping in mind the optimal use of this resource and taking into account all relevant aspects such as technology requirements, traffic guidelines and the number of base stations.

 Meanwhile, TTSL has announced a plan to allow free outgoing calls across the state to any Tata Indicom phone for two years or a maximum of 3,600 minutes without recharging. The plan, called the Dont Stop Mobile, is available for pre-paid users and will give an initial talktime of Rs 10 for calls to other phones. 

 A new subscriber can avail of a handset bundled offer with the new scheme. These include the Indicom Ace priced at Rs 2,299, Haier D1000 at Rs 2,499, Kyocera Prisma at Rs 2,799 and Indicom Star at Rs 3,749.

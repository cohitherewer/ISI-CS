 Private equity firms plans worry clients

 Money matters

 New York, Dec. 17 (Reuters): The massive funds raised by private equity firms and the faster-than-expected speed with which theyre spending them are stretching some of their investors thin, causing concern that there wont be enough money to go around in 2007. 

 The crunch on institutional investors is being fuelled by a 32 per cent drop in the number of sales by private equity firms, known as exits, in the last two years, while the number of buyouts has skyrocketed. What is worrying institutional investors is that funds are coming back to them too quickly for money, without a track record from their prior fund. 

 A drying up of institutional capital would be a major setback to private equity firms raising funds next year and would likely prompt a slowdown in the torrid pace of deals sparked by the sector in the last two years. 

 Feeding such concerns are reports that firms such as Bain Capital, which raised $10 billion last year, may return to the fund-raising trail next year. The Carlyle group and Warburg Pincus Llc are also expected to raise $10-billion-plus funds next year a relatively short turnaround time from their prior funds. 

 Signs that the Blackstone group is having a hard time raising the last chunk of the industrys largest-ever buyout fund, according to sources, are also helping stoke fund-raising worries. Blackstone closed a $15.6-billion fund earlier this year, and reportedly is seeking to reopen and lift it to $20 billion. 

 Private equity firms buy and sell companies using money raised from institutional investors such as state pension funds and college endowments. 

 So-called buyout firms used to take four to five years to spend their funds, allowing investors to receive returns gained from the sale of assets over that time. 

 These institutional investors, known as limited partners (LPs), had money going out and money coming in. Right now, the money is mainly going out. Indeed, so many big funds are spending money, and so fast, that it is sucking demand from investors. 

 If private equity firms keep buying into companies at a pace that far exceeds their exits, the LP spigot could go from a steady stream to a slow trickle. 

 And no wonder. Last year, the US buyout funds raised around $150 billion, a 50 per cent increase from the year before, according to Thomson Financial, and roughly $50 billion was raised by overseas funds. This year, funds expect to raise $300 billion, according to private equity experts. 

 LPs are spending more on buyout funds because their returns are so impressive, especially from the largest funds. In the 12 months through June 2006, investments in private equity firms returned 22.5 per cent against 6.6 per cent for the S amp;P 500, according to Thomson. 

 Buyout firms success has been fuelled in part by smart deals, favourable debt markets and an absence of corporate buyers. 

 Private equity firms accounted for 22 per cent of global M amp;A volume in the first nine months of the year, hitting a record $570.1 billion in deals. Thats up from around 5 per cent a few years ago. 

 A restriction in institutional capital next year could dampen activity, but it could also broaden the investor base for private equity firms. For example, smaller LPs or international investors seeking a slice of the action may be hit by more buyout funds. 

 Still, a cautious base of large investors would probably lead to mega-funds getting smaller. There are a lot of fears at the back of LPs minds that private equity firms are writing checks like crazy, said Kelly DePonte of Probitas Partners, a private equity fund-raising firm. With another fund raising wave incoming in 2007, a lot of LPs are beginning to feel tapped out. Theyre thinking this may be a great time to sell companies, not a great time to buy.

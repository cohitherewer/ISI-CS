 Power trade bar on Gridco

 SUBRAT DAS

 Bhubaneswar, Dec. 5: The appellate tribunal for electricity has directed state-owned power utility Gridco to stop inter-state trading and refund profits of around Rs 300 crore.

 The state government will carry out the tribunals order to stop power trading. However, it will not refund the profit amount and challenge the tribunals order to this effect, Orissa energy minister Surya Narayan Patra told The Telegraph today.

 We will move the Supreme Court against the tribunal order, said Patra, after chairing a high-level meeting this afternoon.

 Gridco has been selling surplus power to several northern and western states, including Delhi, Punjab, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh, since 2003 through Adani Export, NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam and Power Trading Corporation. It has earned an estimated Rs 300 crore profit from the power trading, official sources said.

 Gajendra Haldia, an IAS officer, had filed a case with the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) challenging the legal authority of Gridco for inter-state trading. Quoting the provisions of the Electricity Act, 2003, he argued that Gridco is not empowered to retain profit margin beyond 5 paise per unit in case of inter-state power trading.

 Gridco, however, said it has traded power through Adani Export, NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam and Power TradingCorporation, and not directly to other states.

 The commission accepted Gridcos plea that as an intra-state trader, it can retain profit beyond 4 paise margin per unit. The petitioner then moved the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity challenging the CERC order.

 Recently, the tribunal delivered its judgment that Gridco cannot carry out inter-state power trade and if it does so, it cannot retain profit beyond 4 paise margin per unit. It, therefore, directed Gridco to refund the profit, deducting 4 paise per unit.

 A.C. Mallick, director (commerce) of Gridco, said the profit it earned from power trading was passed on to consumers as retail tariff has not been hiked since the last six years. If Gridco is made to refund the profit to other states, as directed by the tribunal, it will put heavy burden on the consumers of Orissa.

 Meanwhile, the state government had sought the legal opinion of solicitor-general Gulam-e-Vahanvati, who has advised the state government to go to the Supreme Court challenging the tribunal order. Accordingly, both the state government and Gridco will move the apex court against the tribunal order, Patra said.

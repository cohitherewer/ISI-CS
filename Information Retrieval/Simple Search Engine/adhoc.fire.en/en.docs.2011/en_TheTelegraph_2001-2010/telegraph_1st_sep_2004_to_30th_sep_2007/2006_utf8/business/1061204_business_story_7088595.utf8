 DoT for foreign CEOs in telecom

 Call connect

 New Delhi, Dec. 3 (PTI): Telecom firms having foreign CEOs or CFOs may get to retainthem, as the department of telecommunications (DoT) is understood to have convinced security agencies that foreign officials were no threat to the country.

 DoT, which held extensive discussions with security agencies, may also have found a practical solution to allowing companies remote access to haul telecom traffic outside India, sources said.

 It has suggested that remote access may be allowed on the condition that the companies ultimately set up network operation centres in India, over a specified period of time.

 Until then, remote access could be allowed with proper checking by intelligence agencies.

 The DoT, which has defended its decision to allow up to 74 per cent foreign direct investment in telecom sector, is in the process of approaching the cabinet in the second week of this month with a note which, among others, proposes appointment of foreigners to key positions and remote access.

 If the cabinet approves the DoTs views, companies such as Tata Teleservices, which has a foreign CEO (Darryl Green), can get to retain them.

 The government has extended the deadline on a number of occasions to meet the conditions of having only Indians in top management positions and adhering to norms on remote access. Telecom companies now have time till January 2, 2007.

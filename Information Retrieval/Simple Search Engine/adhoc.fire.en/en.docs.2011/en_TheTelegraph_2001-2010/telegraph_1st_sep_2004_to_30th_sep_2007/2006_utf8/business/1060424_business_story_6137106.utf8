 Mortgage trade for select few

 New Delhi, April 23: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) wants to arm itself with more powers to regulate the proposed trading in mortgaged-backed securities. The regulator has also suggested that only institutional investors be allowed to carry out such trades initially.

 In a memorandum submitted to the government, Sebi said the minimum value of such securities, which an investor may trade on the stock market, should be clearly specified. 

 This restriction should be on the lines of the restriction applicable to derivatives transactions in the stock exchanges where the investor cannot enter into a transaction whose value is less than Rs 2 lakh, it said.

 The regulator said this restriction was necessary in the initial stages of development of the market for such securities. Based on experience gained during the course of time, it may be reviewed whether the small investor ought to be permitted to invest in such securities, it said.

 Securitisation is the conversion of illiquid assets into marketable securities. The government has proposed several amendments in the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Amendment Bill, 2005 to enable such transactions.

 The transaction involves assignment and transfer of a pool of housing loans along with the underlying mortgages from lending institutions to a special purpose vehicle (SPV). On acquiring the pool, the SPV designs instruments of securitisation, such as pass residential mortgage backed securities, which may be in the form of pass through certificates, debt obligations or any other form.

 Sebi wants more regulatory powers not only for specifying disclosures and attributes to the instruments but also for procedural requirements of making a public issue.

 This would enable Sebi to address, through suitable provisions, the concern that public issue of instruments based on securitisation of impaired financial assets would not be advisable, it said.

 Sebi has also sought certain changes in disclosure provisions.

 IPO rating

 The market regulator, in consultation with stock exchanges, will put in place a mechanism for rating of public issues of companies.

 A pilot project will run for a year, which will be financed through the investment protection fund in stock exchanges, a finance ministry official said.

 The ratings would be optional for companies.

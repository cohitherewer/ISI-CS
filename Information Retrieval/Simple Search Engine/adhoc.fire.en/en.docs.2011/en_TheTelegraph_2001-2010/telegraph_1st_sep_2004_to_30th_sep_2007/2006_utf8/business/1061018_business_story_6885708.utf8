 Rethink on airline merger

 Ground reality

 New Delhi, Oct. 17: A section of the government is considering a review of the merger plans drawn up by management consultants for the two state-run carriers Air-India and Indian Airlines. It wants to run the two airlines as separate strategic business units and merge their engineering wings into a separate unit. All the units will be under one holding firm.

 Officials said the plans submitted by the consultants needed to be converted into a more do-able format as these proposed forming six strategic business units under a holding company, which is considered by some as too unwieldy. The consultants have alternatively suggested messy mergers of Indian Airlines into Air-India or vice versa. 

 An inter-ministerial group is studying the proposals and will soon take a final view on the merger.

 Merger of one with another could create too much confusion ... it is much simpler to do what a civil aviation ministry study had suggested long back form three SBUs Air-India, Indian Airlines and an engineering maintenance and repair firm under one umbrella holding company. This company would look after policy, finances and plane allocations, officials said. The low-cost versions of both Indian Airlines and Air-India could be merged into a separate entity, also under the holding company.

 Merging one airline with the other is considered troublesome as questions of pay and seniority parity will crop up. Air-India managers earn far more than those of Indian Airlines. Already, officials of the two airlines have started lobbying the government to protect their ranks and privileges.

 Officials said by keeping financial management, policy issues like joint ticketing, seamless transfers and plane allocations under one holding firm, rivalry and bickering, which are blighting attempts at joint functioning, could be avoided. If Air-India was suffering from a lack of planes while Indian Airlines had excess capacity, planes with similar attributes could be simply switched from one to the other, which is not possible now, they added.

 The new entity may come out with a public issue next year if the merger proposal goes through this year. The two airlines need the extra equity as they can garner cheap loans by leveraging these shares. They will use the money to complete aircraft buy orders placed in the global market.

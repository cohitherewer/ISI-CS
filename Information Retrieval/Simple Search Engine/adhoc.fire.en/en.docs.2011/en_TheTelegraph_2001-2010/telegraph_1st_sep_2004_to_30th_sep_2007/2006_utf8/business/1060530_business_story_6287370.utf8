 Calcutta, May 29 (PTI): State-run Andrew Yules revival package would be placed before the cabinet for its approval soon. The revival plan has been cleared by the Board for Reconstruction of Public Sector Enterprises. 

 Heavy industries minister Santosh Mohan Dev said of the seven sick central PSUs in Bengal, six would be revived, including Bridge and Roof, Braithwaite and Burn Standard. Hindusthan Cables, however, would not be revived, he said.

 Copal Art to launch fund for finer senses

 JAYATI GHOSE

 New Delhi, Dec. 17: The Indian art market is on an upward spiral, not just by getting global recognition and prices, but also by emerging as an attractive asset class for Indian investors.

 To tap into this Rs 1,000-crore art industry, Delhi-based Copal Art Limited, a collector and auctioneer of rare Indian contemporary art, will launch the countrys biggest art fund of Rs 150 crore in January. This is an ambitious venture, but Ajay Seth, chief mentor of Copal Art, is unfazed. The segment in India is growing by almost 30 per cent per annum, he said.

 The art house gives exit options to its investors to sell the art pieces on appreciation through gallery sales or online auctions booking profits the way a normal investment fund does.

 Copal Art had launched two art funds last year of Rs 10 crore each and Seth has plans to come up with another Rs 500-crore fund by April 2007, apart from opening three new Copal art galleries at Gurgaon, Dubai and Singapore.

 Our last two funds saw appreciation of 30-60 per cent, increasing my optimism for the current art fund, said Seth, adding that the Indian art market had the potential to develop into Rs 5,000 crore industry within the next two years.

 Copal Arts move comes at a time when more and more investment banks in India are looking at art as an investment for their clients and are advising them to buy art, which can provide attractive returns such as real estate or equity.

 The Copal Art Investment Fund would be an open-ended, delivery-linked fund having no minimum or maximum investment limit, said Seth.

 Since this is a delivery-linked fund, the artwork is physically delivered, unlike in other art funds. Moreover, with no lock-in period, the investor could dispose of the art piece anytime after final delivery and book profits like in any ordinary fund investment.

 An investor selects pieces of art from Copals internal collection, which has been created over a period of three years through a rigorous process of selection. 

 The company then prepares an art portfolio based on an investors risk-return profile, which is reviewed on a regular basis by an internal financial team.

 The investor is also updated about his portfolio through monthly newsletters, apart from being educated on various forms of art and new artists.

 We have tied up with well-known as well as upcoming artists to buy art. We also provide an investor with various options and information ranging from the artist category to the category where the artwork belongs. This is very important from the investors point of view, said Seth.

 According to analysts, art funds are expected to mop up about Rs 400 crore in the coming months. Apart from Copal Art, Crayon Capital has already said it will mobilise around Rs 40 crore for its art fund, while Yatra Art Fund is aiming to garner up to Rs 100 crore from its second fund.

 Earlier, in August, Osians Connoisseurs of Art had raised Rs 102 crore for its art fund. Analysts said that the art industry is still in its nascent stage, compared to developed art markets in the US, UK and Switzerland.

 But they agreed that Indian art was gaining demand. Recently, Sothebys and Christies conducted auctions of Indian contemporary art, and garnered Rs 153 crore, said art connoisseur Arijit Basak.

 But Basak does not look at his eclectic collection as an investment. He bought works by popular artists and some younger emerging artists because he liked them.

 He said while works of art can be viewed as good investments, the best reason to purchase a work of art is not for placement in a fund but for veneration and love of the work itself.

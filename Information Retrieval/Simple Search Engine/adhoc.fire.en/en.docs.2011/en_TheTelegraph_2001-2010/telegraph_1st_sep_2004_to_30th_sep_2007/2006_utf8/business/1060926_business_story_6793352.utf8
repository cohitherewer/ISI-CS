 Bank in north on Vijaya buy list

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Sept. 25: Mangalore-based Vijaya Bank is looking at acquisitions to increase its domestic presence in the north. 

 The banks chairman and managing director, Prakash P. Mallya, said, We would start looking into acquiring a north-based bank after March 2007 and hope to finalise it by the end of the next year. 

 However, he refused to specify whether the target was a public sector bank or a private one. 

 There are several priorities before the bank as far as acquisitions or mergers are concerned. It should be a mid-sized strong bank with optimally positioned workforce, synergy of business operations, compatible technology base and having most of its branches in north India. There are already a few such banks in north India, which are worth looking at, Mallya said. 

 At present Vijaya Bank falls in the mid-sized bank category and we want to enter the large-sized section, for which acquiring an equally strong bank is essential, added Mallya. 

 Analysts speculated Punjab and Sind Bank (P amp;SB) could be a possible choice for acquisition. The bank has over 400 branches in the north of the country. Its net profit in the first quarter ended June 2006 was Rs 46.87 crore. 

 P amp;SB was kept under a scanner by the financial ministry in the past. However, restrictions on it were lifted after its performance improved. 

 State Bank of Patiala with over 600 north India-based branches and a net profit of Rs 303 crore in the fiscal ended March 2006 could be another contender, analysts speculated. 

 Public sector Vijaya Bank, which posted a net profit of Rs 72.63 crore for the quarter ended June 2006, has also decided to mop up around Rs 700 crore under Upper Tier-II capital and Rs 200 crore under Lower Tier-II capital before the year-end, said Mallya. 

 Despite mobilising Rs 250 crore under Lower Tier-II capital at a coupon rate of 9.25 per cent recently, the bank still finds it difficult to maintain its capital adequacy ratio (CAR) at around 11.5 per cent to meet the requirements under the Basel-II regime from next fiscal.

 With the proposed Rs 900-crore Upper and Lower Tier-II issue, the bank expects to comfortably have a CAR of over 11.5 per cent even under the Basel-II regime. The banks current CAR stands at 11.55 per cent, which is likely to fall by 100-200 basis points on account of Basel-II norms. 

 Vijaya Bank, which expects to cross the Rs 50,000-crore mark in business by September 29, is confident of posting a net profit of at least Rs 300 crore for this fiscal. The bank expects a total business of Rs 60,000 crore by March 2007. 

 Its net interest margin was at 3.34 per cent in June and the bank expects it to cross 3.4 per cent.

 Mallya said the bank planned to open overseas branches in Hong Kong, China and Dubai and was awaiting a nod from the RBI. It had initially set a target of crossing a 1,000-branch network by the end of the current fiscal and submitted applications to the RBI for opening 143 branches. It also plans to open an exclusive branch for women in the Northeast. 

 With the delay in obtaining the necessary approvals till date, the bank now expects to reach a size of at least 950 branches by fiscal end from the current level of 925 branches. 

 The bank will make its foray into the life insurance sector with Punjab national Bank. On business alliance similar to that formed by Corporation Bank, Indian Bank and Oriental Bank of Commerce, Mallya said, It is too early to say anything on this. We will look into the merits and demerits of such a move, and we are looking into that.

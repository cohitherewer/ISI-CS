 Budget battalion takes position

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 9: The government has made up its mind about the budget team. Finance minister P. Chidambaram will do the honours on February 28 and his lieutenant for the big day will be expenditure secretary Adarsh Kishore, who has been appointed finance secretary. 

 Chidambaram remains the finance minister despite speculation that he might be shifted to home or external affairs and former RBI governor C. Rangarajan might take his place. All speculations were put to rest when he met industry leaders today for pre-budget consultations. 

 Sources said the finance minister decided to start the meetings only after it was clear that he would not be disturbed during the budget-making process. 

 There have been rumours that a top economist close to the government might be inducted as finance secretary in a manner similar to Montek Singhs appointment as finance secretary during Manmohan Singhs tenure as finance minister. 

 Sources said the IAS lobby rallied its forces to ensure that Kishore was elevated to the key job.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 IT hub set for a makeover

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Fund splash

 Calcutta, Aug. 12: Sector V, the IT showcase of a resurgent Bengal, is getting ready for a major facelift.

 Under the newly-formed Nabadiganta Industrial Township Authority (NITA), a fund would be set up with contributions from the 170-odd IT companies and other biotech and pharma companies operating in the area.

 We have spoken to the corporate houses in the region about the fund and have received a good response from them. The first step would be to conduct a detailed study, which would highlight the areas that need to be worked on and prepare a roadmap, said S.A. Ahmed, chairman of the Nabadiganta Industrial Township Authority.

 The authority is yet to decide on the agency that would conduct the survey.

 The detailed study would touch upon various aspects from roads to signage, unauthorised makeshift food outlets, pedestrian walkways, street lighting, recreational, transport and security issues of people working in the area. Safeguarding wetlands will be another focal area.

 The Urban Development Authority looks after the projects in Sector V.

 The Urban Development Authority has sought expressions of interest (EOIs) for an estimated Rs 200-crore drainage and water supply project for the area and a Rs 25-crore project for beautification. The expressions of interest for a food park would also be issued shortly.

 Ahmed said the city and the state were plagued by land constraints. However, self-sufficiency cannot be brought by agriculture alone. Emphasis on industry is required too, he said. 

 For a state that has based its resurgence on information technology, it is crucial that the jewel in the crown, Sector V, should reflect the sentiments of the state, Ahmed said.

 The fund would be one of the first steps towards achieving that objective, Ahmed added.

 At the last count, around 30,000 to 40,000 people work in Sector V in the information technology and the BPO companies. The number is expected to go up to 200,000 in another three years as the industry is growing at 70 per cent annually.

 The total area is around 430 acres.

 The Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry has set up the Nabadiganta initiative in Salt Lake Sector V to address problems facing the local IT industry.

 The body will submit periodic reports to the chief minister and the IT minister after organising stakeholder meets and discussion forums.

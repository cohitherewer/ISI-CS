 HDFC Bank hikes PLR by 150 basis points to 13%

 Lending rates raised 50 basis points in June 

 New car and personal loans likely to become costly

 Interest rates on deposits raised by 50 to 75 basis points

Mumbai, Dec. 22: HDFC Bank today hiked its benchmark prime lending rate (PLR) by 150 basis points to 13 per cent, the third to do so after ICICI Bank and Centurion Bank of Punjab. The bank has also raised rates on deposits by 50 to 75 basis points.

 The decision comes after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) announced a 50-basis-point hike in the cash reserve ratio (CRR) to 5.50 per cent on December 8. This is the second time this fiscal that HDFC Bank is raising rates. It upped rates by 50 basis points in June.

 Senior bank officials said the increase in June was not sharp enough, though borrowing costs were higher. Since then, deposit rates for retail customers have risen by over 100 basis points across various tenures and the margin of increase for bulk deposits was more. Moreover, liquidity has also tightened in recent times, they added.

 Though bank officials said the increase in PLR would not lead to repricing of loans across the board, sources said fresh car and personal loans were likely to become costlier.

 Last week, Centurion Bank of Punjab increased deposit rates by 25-50 basis points across various maturities. The bank also raised its PLR by 50 basis points to 13 per cent. The bank said the rate revision was in line with the prevailing trends.

 This came only a day after ICICI Bank raised rates on floating rate home loans and corporate advances by 50 basis points. The countrys largest private sector bank also increased rates on domestic term deposits by 25-50 basis points across various tenors. Following the hike, ICICI Banks benchmark advance rate for corporate loans and its floating reference rate (FRR) for consumer loans, including home, were revised to 13.75 per cent and 10.75 per cent respectively.

 With private sector banks increasing rates, the focus is now on public sector banks. Though these banks are not ruling out a hike, a 25-50-basis-point increase is likely to come only next month. However, few of them have raised deposit rates, an indication that interest rate on advances is also set to go up.

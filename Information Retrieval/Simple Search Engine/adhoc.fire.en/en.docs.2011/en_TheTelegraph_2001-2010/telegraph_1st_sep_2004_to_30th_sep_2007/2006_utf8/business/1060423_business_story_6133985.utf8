 Private role in non-metro airport update

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Ground plan

 New Delhi, April 22: The government has decided to involve private companies in developing hotels, retail spaces at 35 non-metro airports, which will soon be modernised.

 The government will entrust the job of air-side developments to the state-run Airports Authority of India and take on partners from among private bidders to develop city- side facilities like retail malls and hotels. 

 AAI has asked two consultancy firms ? Washington-based Louis Beger Group Inc and Delhi-headquartered Intercontinental Consultancy and Technocrats ? to prepare a technical and economic feasibility report for the development of non-metro airports. 

 AAI has also asked consultant Capital Fortune to study the cargo and passenger potential of these airports. The reports will cover areas of airport operations, facilities at the airport and connectivity for both domestic and international flights. These will take into account requirements for the next 25 years.

 Reports are being prepared for Tiruchirapalli, Indore, Bhopal, Nagpur, and Visakhapatnam too.

 The air-side developments will include runways, parking bays and ATCs. Malls, passenger entry, baggage handling will be part of the city-side construction. 

 Officials said the larger part of the income for any airport comes from parking slots given to global airlines. In terms of revenue, an airport earns about 60 per cent of its revenues from the air-side and 40 per cent from the city-side. 

 However, city-side facilities are more profitable as capital investments are far less. This should make taking over city-side alone more lucrative to private players, officials said. 

 A prime-time parking slot at Londons Heathrow airport costs as much as a million pounds. They also point out that this kind of income could help AAI generate part of the Rs 40,000-crore needed to fund the governments ambitious plan to modernise and, in some cases, build anew some 80 airports. 

 Keeping the air-side, which is more security sensitive, with a state-run agency, will also address the concerns of the intelligence bureau and the Left. 

 The plan to develop the top non-metro airports has been undertaken as air-services to India are growing at a fast pace and the number of bays and runways at metro airports are inadequate to cope with this kind of growth. The India-Britain route alone is expected to see 1400 new services a year from next year onwards. Air travel out of India is increasing by 25 per cent annually.

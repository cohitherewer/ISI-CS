 Unveiling the annual supplement to the foreign trade policy today, commerce minister Kamal Nath said focus product and focus market schemes would be introduced to ramp up exports of labour intensive goods from rural and semi-urban regions and open up markets in Africa and Latin America.

 He said goods exports had already crossed the $100-billion mark, and the new initiatives would propel it beyond $120 billion in 2006-07.

 Announcing a special package for gems and jewellery, Nath said, I want to see Mumbai on the same footing as the diamond market in Antwerp and the emerging centres of Dubai and Tel Aviv.

 The policy has plenty of boosters for gems and jewellery to cater to changing needs and facilitate easy product movement, besides allowing import of metal scrap for refining.

 The focus product scheme would include value-added fish and leather products, stationery items, fireworks, sports goods and handloom and handicraft items.

 The minister also announced a special agriculture and village industry scheme.

 Under the new policy, services exports in Indian currency would qualify for benefits under the served from India scheme. Moreover, benefits for the scheme earned by one service provider can now be utilised by another group firm, including hotels.

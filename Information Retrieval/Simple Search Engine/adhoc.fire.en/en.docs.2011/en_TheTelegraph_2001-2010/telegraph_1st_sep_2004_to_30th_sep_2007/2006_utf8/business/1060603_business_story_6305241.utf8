 Tide Water fate hangs in balance

 S.P.S PANNU 

 New Delhi, June 2: ONGCs chances of taking over Tide Water Oil appear to be dim following the exit of Subir Raha from the upstream oil major.

 According to sources, the proposal is expected to be taken up only after the appointment of a new chairman, which could take a good three months.

 Former chairman Raha, an IOC-man before taking charge at ONGC, had initiated measures to diversify into refining and marketing of petroleum products. 

 As part of the strategy, ONGC under Raha acquired Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL), making an entry into downstream marketing of petroleum products.

 Tide Water Oil fitted with Rahas plans, as it was an established player in lubricants with an annual profit of over Rs 10 crore. 

 He realised the potential in marketing lubricants from MRPL retail outlets and was keen on strengthening the Veedol brand.

 Lubricants carry higher margins, though it has a smaller share of the market compared with petrol and diesel. 

 ONGC acting chairman R.S. Sharma is unlikely to press ahead with the proposal as he has taken charge only temporarily. 

 Some ONGC officials feel that in the post-Raha era the PSU is likely to focus more on its core areas of exploration and production, a strategy favoured by the petroleum ministry as well. 

 The acting chairman has already said that ONGC would work closely with the petroleum ministry.

 Raha had told the petroleum ministry that ONGC was ready to take over Calcutta-based Tide Water on the basis of the due diligence on Andrew Yule. 

 Since Tide Water is under the heavy industries ministry and ONGC under the petroleum ministry, inter-ministerial meetings are necessary for the takeover.

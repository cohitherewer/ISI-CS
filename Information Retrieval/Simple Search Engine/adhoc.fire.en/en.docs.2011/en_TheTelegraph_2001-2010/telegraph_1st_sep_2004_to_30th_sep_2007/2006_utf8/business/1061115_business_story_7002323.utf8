 A step ahead

 Mumbai, Nov. 14: DLF Ltd, the real estate major, has resolved differences with minority shareholders over allotment of debentures. This could pave the way for the revival of its IPO to raise Rs 13,600 crore from the capital market.

 At the extra ordinary general meeting (EGM) held today, the shareholders have approved the issue of 81,983 or 2 per cent unsecured redeemable debentures of Rs 100 each to minority shareholders, who had earlier filed a complaint with market regulator Sebi, alleging that they did not receive the letter of offer for the debenture issued in December last year.

 The minority shareholder issue was the major reason for the collapse of its much-hyped IPO in August, and the company had to withdraw its draft prospectus with Sebi after failing to get the required regulatory approvals.

 The minority shareholders are being offered debentures on the same terms and conditions as previously offered so that they do not lose out, a company official said.

 The EGM was attended by almost 55 shareholders and their representatives were also present, the company release said.

 The members further approved that the debentures, on issue and allotment and on being fully paid-up, be converted into equity shares in the ratio of 10 equity shares of Rs 10 each for every one debenture of Rs 100 each held by minority shareholders.

 It also gave nod to splitting the shares so issued into 5 shares of Rs 2 each for every Rs 10 paid-up share.

 Besides, the shareholders also approved a further bonus share issue of seven equity shares of Rs 2 each for every share of Rs 2 held after the conversion of the debentures into equity shares and subsequent splitting of shares.

 The company has about 1,000 minority shareholders, whose holding amounts to about 0.42 per cent of the total paid up capital.

 There were no lapses committed by the company in respect of the offer of debentures made to the shareholders in December 2005, but keeping the interest of the minority shareholders and to maintain their goodwill, the board decided to revive the lapsed offer of debentures to the minority shareholders, the release said.

 K P. Singh-owned DLF is renewing its effort to tap the capital market to raise Rs 13,600 crore, to be utilised to acquire land, meet the construction cost and repay loan.

 The DLF issue would be larger than the ONGC public offer, which had raised Rs 10,500 crore, to fund its expansion programmes and future growth, DLF chief financial officer Ramesh Sanka had said.

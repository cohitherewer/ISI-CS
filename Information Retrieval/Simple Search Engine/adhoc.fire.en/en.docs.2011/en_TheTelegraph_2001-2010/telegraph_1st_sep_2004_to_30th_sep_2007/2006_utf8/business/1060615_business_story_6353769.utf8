 L amp;T joins hands with Kuwait firm

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, June 14: Larsen amp; Toubro Ltd (L amp;T) has entered into a joint venture with a subsidiary of Kuwait-based Bader Al Mulla group. The new company will focus on construction projects in oil amp; gas, power and infrastructure, with a primary focus on electro-mechanical construction in Kuwait.

 The joint venture, Larsen amp; Toubro Kuwait Construction WLL, will be registered as a local company in that country. 

 The venture is expected to enable both the companies to benefit significantly from the construction boom in Kuwait, particularly in oil refining and infrastructure development sectors.

 Bader Al Mulla has a strong business presence in Kuwait and possesses insight into the markets requirements, trends and prospects, L amp;T informed stock exchanges today. 

 The company will bring to the joint venture its impressive track record and technical expertise in construction of projects in various sectors, as well as its project management skills, it added.

 This joint venture agreement comes soon after L amp;T chairman A.M. Naik led a high-level delegation to Kuwait and announced the companys intention to develop long-term relationships with industries in the Gulf Cooperation Council region. 

 L amp;T is actively scouting for alliances with companies that shared its vision and complement each other.

 The Kuwait government is planning to invest several billion dollars in the development of the hydrocarbon sector and infrastructure. 

 Given the nature of L amp;Ts main businesses that include technology, engineering and construction, infrastructure development, power plants and distribution, the company said it would benefit from Kuwaits growth plans.

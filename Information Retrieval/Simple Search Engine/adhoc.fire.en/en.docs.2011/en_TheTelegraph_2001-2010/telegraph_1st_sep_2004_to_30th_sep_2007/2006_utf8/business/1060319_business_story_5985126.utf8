 Chidambaram: Pragmatic 

 New Delhi, March 18: Finance minister P. Chidambaram today said the government would try not to tamper with the tax rate but indicated that customs and excise duties would be reduced over the next few years to Asean levels.

 The finance minister, who was speaking in the Lok Sabha while introducing the Finance Bill 2006, said he wanted the coming fiscal to be a year of consolidation with moderate and stable tax rates. 

 There is no reason to tinker or tamper with the tax rates every year and consequently ... there were very few tax proposals or changes this year.

 Chidambaram said the country was moving towards Asean level of customs duties and had moved half a step towards bringing down the rate to 12.5 per cent. He said the country would eventually bring down duties to a range between 5-10 per cent to make Indian industry comparably efficient with Asean nations. He said ultimately the cenvat rate would be brought down to 14-16 per cent. 

 The service tax would be merged to bring about a general goods and services tax regime over a 4-year period. We have given ourselves a 4-year time period. We will be working with the state finance ministers on this and come up with a road map for a goods and services tax, Chidambaram said.

 The tax regime has given a huge boost to the automobile and cotton textile industry in the past and the government wanted to replicate this in other areas such as food processing, leather and paper, he added. 

 Demanding changes in tax policies, several members of the Lok Sabha urged the finance minister to raise the taxation level on corporate India, levy new taxes on rich farmers who were outside the tax net while sparing the elderly and the lower middle class.

 CPM MP Rup Chand Pal said, The effective corporate tax is half the world average. The effective rate comes to about 20 per cent and that is also evaded. He wanted the effective rate to be raised while taxes on small industry and senior citizens to be reduced. The government should frame its resource mobilisation policies (taxation policies both direct and indirect) in letter and spirit of the common minimum programme of the UPA government, Pal said.

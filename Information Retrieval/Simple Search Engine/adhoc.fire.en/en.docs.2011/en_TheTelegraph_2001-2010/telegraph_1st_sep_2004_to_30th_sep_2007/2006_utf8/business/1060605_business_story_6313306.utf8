 Fruits of labour

 Don?t withdraw from your PF when you switch jobs, says Srikumar Banerjee

 After working for less than four years in a publication in Delhi, 28-year-old L. Rajkumar quit his job last year to join another company.

 Rajkumar decided to withdraw his EPF (employees? provident fund) accumulation from his previous employer and started contributing to a fresh provident fund account with the new employer. 

 But when Rajkumar finally got the money, he was told that he would have to pay tax on the amount. Rajkumar was taken aback. He didn?t know that the withdrawal of EPF money before the completion of five years attracted a tax.

Not before five years

 Withdrawal from the provident fund account before five years is considered as income in the hands of the employee during the year it is withdrawn and is taxed at the same marginal rate at which the employee pays income tax. 

 ?This provision has been kept to stop misuse of the fund (EPF) which has been set up to provide a safeguard for retirement,? says Prakash N. Dubey, an income tax commissioner.

 As job opportunities increase and more employees go in for fixed-term or contractual employment, job hopping has become commonplace. But do not withdraw PF money every time you switch jobs. 

It?s tax-free

 Remember, contribution to a PF account is tax-free (up to Rs 1 lakh) under section 80C of the Income Tax Act. The accumulation and withdrawal (after five years) are also tax-free. But this may change after the introduction of the exempt-exempt-tax regime that finance minister P. Chidambaram plans to introduce.

How much do I pay?

 Under the Employees? Provident Fund Scheme 1952, an employee?s contribution is capped at 12 per cent of the basic monthly salary up to a maximum of Rs 6,500. This is matched by a similar contribution by the employer. If the employer is willing, an employee can contribute up to 20 per cent of the basic salary. However, in such a case, the employers contribution remains at 12 per cent. The additional 8 per cent contribution by the employee is seen as voluntary.

Private trusts

 If you are working with an organisation that manages the employees? provident fund on its own or its management is given to a private trust, such as the one like the Birlas, there may not be any maximum salary clause as in the case of the EPFO. The contribution is calculated as 12 per cent of the basic salary with a matching amount from the employer.

 By withdrawing from the provident fund account, you lose the employers contribution and the interest accruing to your kitty. 

A higher return

 Second, there are few investment options available in the market that can match provident funds ? Employees? Provident Fund or Government Provident Fund ? in terms of returns. At present, an 8.5 per cent rate of interest is paid on these funds (while it is 8 per cent on Public Provident Fund). Besides, the interest is compounded annually. These make employees? provident fund peerless among all retirement investment avenues.

 Let us illustrate this with an example. Let?s assume a 30-year-old male employee plans to retire at 60. His current basic salary is Rs 15,000 per month, which he expects to grow by 10 per cent every year. With an EPF contribution of 12 per cent per month, his total accumulation before retirement will be Rs 1,35,40,135. Even with a 5 per cent increment in basic salary every year, his accumulation will grow to Rs 61,80,785 in 30 years.

 If we take into account the tax benefit on contributions, the effective return will be higher than any other retirement investment option, including Public Provident Fund. If you stay with the EPF for at least 10 years, you will be eligible to receive 24 per cent of the balance in your provident fund account as pension once you turn 50. And upon attaining 58 years, you will start receiving full pension under the Employees Pension Scheme.

Non-refundable loan

 Third, unlike any other investment, you can also take a non-refundable loan up to 90 per cent of the money in your EPF account. However, there are specific occasions for which you can take the loan and you need to complete five years of contribution. 

 With all these advantages, it is always beneficial to transfer your provident fund account to your new employer whenever you change a job, rather than closing the existing account and opening a new one again. You may point at the long procedures involved in transferring an EPF account with one employer to another. This is a real pain as of now. Though officially the EPFO shouldnt take more than a month after an employee submits the Form 13 (for transfer of EPF account) duly attested by the new employer, they usually take more than six months. Following it up with the officials of EPFO is another headache.

 But the government is planning to expedite the process of allotting a single 14-digit EPF number to every employee, which can be used irrespective of the employer one is working with. Even if one is transferred from one state to another or joins a new company in another state, one won?t need to close a provident fund account and open a new one.

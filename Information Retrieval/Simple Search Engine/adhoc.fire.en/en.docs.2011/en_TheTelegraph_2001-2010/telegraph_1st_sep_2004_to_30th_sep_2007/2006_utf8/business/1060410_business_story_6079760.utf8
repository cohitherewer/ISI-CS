 Feud over ethanol blend

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Fuelling debate

 Mumbai, April 9: Ethanol as a fuel may be big business in Brazil, but in India, sugar companies are unhappy despite the government allowing a blend of 5 per cent ethanol with petrol.

 Upset by the tardy manner in which oil-marketing companies are pursuing the blending programme, sugar manufacturers want the Centre to make ethanol mixing mandatory and not optional. The sugar industry pointed out that while they have invested over Rs 900 crore in installing ethanol capacity, oil companies have lifted only scanty quantities.

 Sources said in August 2002, the then government notified the mandatory blending of 5 per cent ethanol with petrol in nine states and four Union territories. 

 The states are Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu while the four Union territories are Goa, Pondicherry, Chandigarh and Delhi.

 However, on October 27, 2004, the government superseded the notification and made ethanol-blending conditional on the price of ethanol for oil companies being on par with the price of the fuel for alternative uses and the price of imported petrol.

 Later, after a follow-up by the industry to bring the ethanol programme back on track, oil-marketing companies issued fresh tenders for the purchase of ethanol on January 2005.

 It was in June last year that the government issued fresh tenders for purchasing ethanol in nine states and four Union territories. While oil-marketing companies began lifting alcohol stocks from sugar mills in Uttar Pradesh in July last year, the quantities taken were scanty. Even as the tenders of most other states have not been finalised, oil companies do not appear to be committed to pursue the ethanol programme, sources said.

 In such a scenario, while a leading sugar manufacturer is believed to be pursuing with the government the case to make ethanol mixing mandatory, at the industry level, the Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA) wants a long-term commitment from the ministry of petroleum. 

 It has also asked the government to extend the programme to all the states. Sources said the ministry was now willing to enter into a long-term arrangement for the purchase of ethanol for the next three years.

 Though the Centre has not indicated any move towards mandatory blending of ethanol with petrol, the secretary of the ministry of petroleum has agreed to consider the sugar industrys demand for extending the programme on an all-India basis at a meeting convened in March this year.

 Sources said ethanol blending is likely to become mandatory after necessary infrastructure is created in the states that are not covered under the programme.

 9% growth, 7 crore jobs in 11th Plan

 New Delhi, Oct. 18: The Centre has agreed on an Eleventh Five-Year Plan (2007-12) format that aims to speed up growth to 9 per cent and create 7 crore jobs. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has, however, set a more ambitious target of 10 per cent.

 The plan expects to bring about a faster and more inclusive growth by relaxing labour laws, de-reserving small-scale sectors like textiles, reducing import and production duties and encouraging both contract and cooperative farming. 

 However, the plan has to be endorsed by states in a meeting of the National Development Council in December before it is implemented next year.

 Singh, along with cabinet ministers and members of the Planning Commission, who met here today to finalise the format, decided to bridge the divide between the rich and the poor by pushing farming and labour intensive industry growth. Development activities for some minorities, backward castes, scheduled castes and tribes will be taken up to improve their access to basic civic amenities, jobs, skills and education.

 Singh, however, made it clear that higher spending is a necessity (but) this cannot come at the cost of fiscal prudence. Under the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act, the government is committed to reduce budgetary deficit. Demands for higher plan allocation will now have to be juggled by matching increase in state income or by farming out work to the private sector.

 The approach paper also seeks to raise more jobs in manufacturing and services, and reduce educated unemployment to below 5 per cent. But the plan admits that the rate of inflation is likely to remain at an average high of 4 per cent for the entire period. 

 It states that though there has been some softening in oil prices from the peak of over $70 a barrel, current assessments are that oil prices will remain high ... This could exert contractionary pressures on the economy.

 The approach paper also wants to take forward the process of de-reserving the small-scale sector. Nearly 600 product lines are still reserved for the small-scale sector, including the textile industry. The policy paper, which sets the agenda for the next five years, says the process of de-reservation of products for small-scale sector will continue.

 The paper also seeks to bring in changes in the contract labour act, which advisers say are already being worked on.

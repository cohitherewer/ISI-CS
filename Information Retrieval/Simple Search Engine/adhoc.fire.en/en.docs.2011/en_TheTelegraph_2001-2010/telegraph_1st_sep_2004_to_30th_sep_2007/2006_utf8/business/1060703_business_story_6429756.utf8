The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Share swing freezes RPG retail outfit offer

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Calcutta, July 2: Snubbed by share volatility, RPG Enterprises has deferred the initial public offering of its retail venture.

 The group, which earlier said it would either make a private placement or an IPO or a combination of both to fund its expansion plan in retail, believes this is not the appropriate time to dilute equity.

 Sanjiv Goenka, vice-chairman of RPG Enterprises, said the retail business was unlikely to get a fair valuation.

 We think that the business could get double the valuation in a years time. As a result, there will be no private placement or IPO of the retail business now, Goenka told The Telegraph.

 The group has decided to fund the expansion from internal accruals.

 We will invest about Rs 100 crore in the retail venture in 2006-07, he added.

 Goenka admitted that volatility in stock markets deferred the IPO. He said the business would have a far higher valuation in a year.

 RPG Enterprises restructured its retail business in October 2005 by bringing all retail formats, except Music World, under the Spencers brand.

 There are four formats in the retail business ? Spencers Fresh, Spencers Daily, Spencers Super and Spencers Hyper. All formats, based on the size and offerings, operate in the hypermart segment. Now the group has brought Music World under its retail division headed by Sumantra Banerjee. 

 RPG Retail will post a turnover of close to Rs 1,000 crore this fiscal. Goenka said during the exit month of 2006-07 (March), which is the performance indicator for the retail industry, the company would post a turnover of Rs 95 crore.

 This will go up to Rs 130 crore in June and Rs 146 crore in December of 2007-08, he added.

 The retail business is also expected to turn positive by the last quarter of this fiscal.

 In 2007-08, the retail business is likely to have a turnover of Rs 2,000 crore, up from Rs 400 crore in 2005-06. During the next nine months, the company will more than double its number of stores to 123 from 57.

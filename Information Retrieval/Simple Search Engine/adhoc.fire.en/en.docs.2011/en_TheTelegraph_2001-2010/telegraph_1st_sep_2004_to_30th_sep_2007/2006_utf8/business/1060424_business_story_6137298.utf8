 Ulips: Pie in the sky?

 The returns are better when investment and insurance aren?t combined, says Srikumar Bondyopadhyay

 If your insurance agent tells you that a unit-linked insurance plan (Ulip) is the best of both worlds, take it with a pinch of salt.

 The rise in the net asset value of the Ulip that the agent is trying to hardsell may not truly reflect the growth in your investment fund.

Hidden charges

 Insurers levy a number of charges, including the mortality charge, on a monthly basis by deducting units from your kitty. These charges are exclusive of the annual costs that insurers deduct from a policyholder?s annual premium before allocating for the investment fund.

 These costs significantly reduce the investment fund of a policyholder.

Now out in the open

 So far, insurers didn?t disclose to policyholders the different fees and charges and how frequently these were deducted from the premium or the fund value. 

 Thanks to the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority, they will have to explicitly state these charges and their calculations in their product brochures from July 1.

 It could prove to be a field day for policy buyers as they can then easily compare the cost and benefits of Ulips of different insurers. Insurers may also reduce their Ulip costs as a number of them, such as ICICI Prudential Life Insurance, Kotak Mahindra Old Mutual Life Insurance, Aviva Life Insurance and Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance, have already said they would soon come out with modified plans. 

 Even then, the very nature of costs involved in a Ulip makes it less attractive. 

Points to ponder

 Instead of being swayed by what the agent says, ask the person to calculate a few things for you.

 First, how much annual premium will you have to pay for a given sum assured under a basic unit-linked plan for, say, 15 years.

 Second, what will be the notional value of your investment fund after 15 years assuming a 10 per cent annual rate of return. Make sure that the agent takes into account all charges and fees deductible from your fund corpus.

 Third, what will be the annual premium if you instead buy a pure term assurance plan having the same sum assured and for the same premium paying term.

 Fourth, calculate the extra premium you will have to pay per year if you have to buy a basic Ulip instead of a term assurance plan. 

 If this extra is invested every year in a mutual fund, you can build a larger investment fund (See tables). And this is despite the fact that you won?t get back the premia you paid towards the term assurance plan. Moreover, this option gives the same tax benefit as in a Ulip.

How does it work?

 To illustrate our position, we have used the charges and fees of an endowment Ulip of a leading private sector insurer. 

 If a 32-year-old healthy male wants to buy this plan for a sum assured of Rs 6 lakh and for a term of 15 years, he will have to pay an annual premium of Rs 80,000. During each of the first two years, the insurer will allocate 73 per cent of the annual premium, or Rs 58,400, to the investment fund; the rest it will deduct as costs towards agents? commission and other initial charges.

 Besides this, the insurer will deduct a mortality charge, a fund management fee and an administrative charge on a monthly basis by knocking off units from your kitty. These charges can add up to Rs 500-600 a year.

 The Ulip investment, thus, builds a corpus of Rs 5,43,490 when the policyholder attains the age of 35 assuming an annual return of 10 per cent.

Premium numbers

 Now let?s see what happens if the person buys a term assurance from this insurer on similar terms. 

 The annual premium works out to be Rs 1,782.

 The remaining Rs 78,218 (Rs 80,000 ? Rs 1,782) can be invested in an equity-linked savings scheme of a mutual fund. 

 The policyholder gets Rs 5,90,216 from the mutual fund investment when he is 35. 

 The difference in fund values in the two options increases as one becomes older.

 Even for tax savings, this investment option wins hands down.

 Thus, insurance and investment yield better results when treated separately than when clubbed together.

 New Delhi, May 23: State-owned MTNL today announced it would charge its landline customers a mere Rs 1.20 for a three minute call between Delhi and Mumbai.

 The new rate will come into effect from June 1, MTNL chief R.S.P. Sinha announced in the presence of Union communications minister Dayanidhi Maran.

 At present, MTNL charges Rs 1.90 a minute for a call between Delhi and Mumbai.

 BSNL, the other telecom PSU, charges about Rs 2.40 a minute for STD calls throughout India, except between Delhi and Mumbai, while private operators charge up to Rs 2.65 a minute.

 Other operators are expected to follow suit to remain competitive in the lucrative Delhi-Mumbai segment.

 MTNL, which has licence to operate only in the metros of Delhi and Mumbai, has 38 lakh fixed-line users in both these cities put together.

 Sinha said his firms move has nothing to do with BSNLs recent slash in the rates for calls that its customers make to other fixed-line networks like Reliance and Bharti by 75 per cent to Rs 1.20 per 3-minute call. However, most analysts felt it was an answer of sorts. 

 Maran said this is a fallout of the policy decision by department of telecom to bring down the licence fee for NLD and ILD to a uniform Rs 2.5 crore from Rs 25 crore and Rs 100 crore, respectively.

 MTNL, which launched its own STD operations between Delhi and Mumbai today, has tied up with Tata-owned VSNL for traffic carriage based on the lowest rates offered by VSNL.

 MTNL has been paying huge carriage charges for its calls routed outside Delhi and Mumbai. By tying up with VSNL we shall be buying huge bandwidth capacity at a cost of Rs 2.64 crore annually thereby saving Rs 8-10 crore, MTNL officials said.

 MTNL is also setting up two new customer care centres ? one in Mumbai and the other in Delhi ? to its existing four for landline, broadband, GSM and WiLL services. The move is being seen as one which is expected to address growing competition from the private telecom players in the country.

 The new MTNL centre is an update to our current service centres in Mumbai and other states. It will have a complete database of MTNL subscribers. No work of the centre will be outsourced to a foreign or a private body, said Sinha.

 Bharat Ophthalmic faces closure

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, June 16: The government has finally decided to bite the bullet. The cabinet today approved the closure of Bharat Ophthalmic Glass Ltd, a proposal that has been recommended for several years.

 A corpus of Rs 9.8 crore has been created to offer a voluntary separation scheme to the existing employees of the Durgapur-headquartered firm.

 Both the Bureau of Industrial and Financial Reconstruction as well as the Bureau of Reconstruction of Public Sector Enterprises had recommended downing the shutters of BOGL, as it could not be revived. 

 The cabinet also approved keeping the voluntary separation scheme for all employees open on the rolls of BOGL for three months and to settle all employee related dues, including wages and statutory dues.

 The company has been closed down under the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947.

 Fisheries board

 The cabinet committee of economic affairs (CCEA) has also approved Rs 2,100 crore for setting up the National Fisheries Development Board to improve fish production in the country. The money will be invested over the next six years. 

 The board will bring professional management to fisheries and aqua-culture and help increase annual fish production by 3.9 million tonnes at the end of the six-year period, said Pranab Mukherjee, defence minister, after the cabinet meeting.

 The board will carry out programmes like intensive aquaculture, reservoir fisheries, brakish-water aquaculture, mariculture, seaweed cultivation, develop infrastructure and streamline domestic marketing.

 The cabinet also approved creation of the required number of posts, setting up of a governing body and an executive committee. The board will be set up under the Societies Registration Act, 1960.

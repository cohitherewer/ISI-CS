 China pricks Aiyars energy bubble

 S.P.S. PANNU 

 Aiyar: Low pitch

 New Delhi, Jan. 9: Petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar has scaled down the length of his proposed visit to Beijing as the Chinese authorities are not keen to raise the pitch of the oil diplomacy between the two countries. Aiyar has cut short his visit to four days from the week-long planned earlier.

 While some agreements for general technical co-operation in the hydrocarbon sector are expected to come through, major joint-venture deals between Indian and Chinese oil firms for acquiring foreign assets are not likely to be signed.

 The Chinese response to the recent Asian buyers and sellers meet hosted by India was also lukewarm as the Asian giants ambassador to India attended the conference while other countries were represented by their ministers or vice-ministers.

 In fact, the junior level representation by China had posed a problem for Russia as the energy minister had himself arrived from Moscow. 

 Bound by protocol, the Russian minister had skipped the deliberations after making his inaugural speech and was not present when the joint statement was announced. 

 Aiyar, being a seasoned diplomat, tackled the situation by hosting a separate dinner for his Russian counterpart.

 The ministers oil diplomacy with China made some headway when ONGC-Videsh and China National Petroleum Corporation jointly picked up PetroCanadas stake in the Syrian oilfield. 

 OVL had also picked up a stake in the Greater Nile oilfield in Sudan in which CNPC already holds a stake. However, the Chinese firm had opposed OVLs entry, while the Sudan government had insisted on Indias participation for geopolitical reasons. 

 The Syrian deal is a move forward in India and Chinas co-operation in the hydrocarbon sector.

 In the past, the two countries have competed mainly for oilfields in which West was not interested. The Chinese have been aggressively outbidding OVL and, in the process, they have been clinching deals at a much higher cost than they otherwise would have done. 

 Aiyar knows that hard commercial realities will dominate the Chinese thinking, but he does not rule out opportunities where they can come together in a win-win situation. During his visit, he will try to set the stage for such deals to follow. 

 It has also become evident that Chinese companies, with deeper pockets than OVL, are far more ambitious in their quest for overseas oil and gas assets and are willing to take greater risks. 

 The $4.5-million bid for Unocal, which the Chinese lost purely on account of political reasons, reflects their growing ambitions in acquiring hydrocarbon assets in the West.

 Similarly, the Chinese are investing over $2 billion in Nigeria, while the Indian government has stopped OVL from entering the African country due to the high-risk involved on account of political instability.

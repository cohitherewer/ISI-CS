 Roadshows to woo IT firms to Bengal

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Oct. 29: The state IT department, along with West Bengal Electronics Development Corporation Limited (Webel), will organise roadshows in New Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore between November 2006 and January 2007 to woo investors to Bengal. Such a measure comes at a time when the IT sector in the state is plagued by problems of land acquisition and procedural delays in projects, besides the possible formation of a Citu workers association.

 We are planning to organise roadshows in the first phase. These will include a corporate dinner with all IT companies at a given location. Our aim is to invite new investors as well as instil more confidence in existing ones and urge them to look at the state for their expansion. Meetings will also be organised with specific companies and the opportunities in the state will be showcased, said Debanjan Datta, managing director of Webel.

 Webel has also appointed Hanmer amp; Partners as its public relations and image consultant.

 The state also plans to invite the chip making companies and other high-end biotechnology firms involved in knowledge process outsourcing.

 If the roadshows are successful, the state IT department and Webel plan to hold similar roadshows in Chennai and Hyderabad.

 The roadshows assume significance as they come at a time when the IT sector in the state is going through a rough patch, said industry experts.

 Such roadshows would help keep the momentum and continue the good work achieved by participating in annual events like BangaloreIT.in, said Datta.

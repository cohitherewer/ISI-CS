 Mumbai, June 3: Reliance Energy (REL), the Anil Dhirubhai Ambani group company, has gone beyond a proposed 5600-mw power plant in Uttar Pradesh. The company is now implementing an ambitious rural electrification programme in the state. REL has so far lighted up 2,200 villages there and plans to supply power to 5000 more villages by February next year.

 REL officials said the company?s rural electrification plan is a government-aided project under the Rajiv Gandhi Grameen Vidhyuteekaran Yojana and is being implemented by the state.

 REL has covered 18 districts in the state since August 2005, while the project will take up electrification of 7,220 villages covering about 97,000 below-poverty-line (BPL) families. 

 ?About 2,200 villages now have electricity. Work in the other villages will be completed by February 2007. Electrification of these villages entails setting up of 54 new sub stations, augmenting 89 old substations and laying of transmission lines. 

 The ultimate objective is to ensure an assured supply of power to every BPL family, sources in the company added.

 It?s not REL alone which is involved in rural electrification. NTPC is also pursuing a similar project in the country by taking up distributed generation (DG) projects at villages that do not have power.

 In February this year, UP chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav had appealed to all companies to achieve the fixed targets under the rural electrification scheme in villages by June 30.

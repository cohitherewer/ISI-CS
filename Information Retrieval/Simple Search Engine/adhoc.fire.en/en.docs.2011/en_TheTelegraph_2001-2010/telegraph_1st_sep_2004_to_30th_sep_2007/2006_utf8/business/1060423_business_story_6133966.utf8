 Reddy warns against crude spiral 

 Reddy: Watchful

 Washington, April 22 (PTI): India today warned that the spurt in global oil prices posed an imminent risk of rising inflation, thereby putting pressure on interest rates, especially in oil-importing developing countries. 

 It is now widely recognised that rising international oil prices pose a grave concern for the global economy in view of limited spare capacity, and continuing geo-political uncertainties, RBI governor Y. V. Reddy told the International Monetary and Financial Committee (IMFC) here. 

 Reddy cautioned that the present state of increase in oil prices could result in an abrupt revision of inflationary expectations. 

 This, in turn, could raise interest rates, exacerbating the costs associated with the expected corrections of the overvalued asset markets, particularly housing markets, in the developed countries and the required adjustments to the growing global current account imbalances.

 However, he said, Inflationary pressures remained modest in 2005 despite rising global oil prices. While global headline inflation picked up slightly, core inflation remained contained during 2005. In recent years, stable inflationary expectations across the globe, reflecting in part the increasing credibility of central banks worldwide, has been one of the most important elements of the growth revival.

 Reddy, leading the Indian delegation for this years spring meetings of World Bank and the IMF over the weekend, said in spite of many positive aspects of global economy painted in the latest world economic outlook of the IMF, the continuing volatility of global oil prices and ever-widening global imbalances continue to be the principal challenges needing immediate attention. 

 Investment demand lagging behind savings was yet another concern in a number of countries, Reddy said, while pointing out that the international community will have to take note of potential adversities posed by bird flu. Oil price hikes have also led to non-fuel commodity prices, which could further push inflationary pressures, he said. 

 On the supply side, we reiterate the need for investment, oil conservation measures, greater dissemination and transparency of oil market data and improvement in market structure and behaviour. On the demand side, policy makers should continue to be vigilant for any signs of a pickup in inflation in the period ahead, said Reddy.

 The 13-billion-euro company already has a presence in houseware and powder coating segments in the country. Coatings comprise the largest segment of the company with sales reaching 5.55 billion euro globally.

 For decorative coatings in India, we are making a business plan to cover products, brands, supply and sourcing strategies. This will take us a few months. We are interested in the decorative coatings market in India and will enter it soon, said a company spokesperson in a written reply to The Telegraph today.

The total size of the paints market in the country was Rs 12,000 crore in 2005 and it was close to 1.4 million tonnes in terms of volume. The market is growing at a rate of 12-15 per cent.

 The growth rate in the decorative market is much higher. In any developed market, one-third of the paints market consists of decorative paints, said Sumeet Budhraja of Edelweiss.

Both the units are expected to have a minimum capacity of 20,000 tonnes and will have the provisions to scale up to 40,000 tonnes.

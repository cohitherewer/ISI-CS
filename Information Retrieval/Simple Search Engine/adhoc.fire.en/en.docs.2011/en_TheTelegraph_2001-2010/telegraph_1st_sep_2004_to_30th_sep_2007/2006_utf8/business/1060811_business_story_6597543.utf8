 Ranbaxy to sell unit in Ireland 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug 10: Ranbaxy Laboratories has decided to divest its 100 per cent stake in its manufacturing facility in Cashel, Ireland.

 In a notice to the Bombay Stock Exchange, the company said after the recent acquisition of Terapia plant in Romania, there have been significant efficiencies to be gained from consolidating the companys European manufacturing operations. This is consistent with the companys strategy to make Romania the strategic hub for markets in Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States. 

 The Irish unit, Rima, was acquired in 1996. Essentially a formulation plant, it catered to the European market.

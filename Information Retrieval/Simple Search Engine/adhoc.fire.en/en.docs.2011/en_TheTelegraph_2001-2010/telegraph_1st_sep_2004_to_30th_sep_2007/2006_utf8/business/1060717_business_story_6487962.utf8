 MphasiS BPO on the prowl

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 16: MphasiS BPO is scouting for firms in financial accounting and HR process outsourcing.

 After acquiring a controlling stake in EDS, MphasiS expects to leverage the sales network of the Texas-based company to widen its reach and expand its client portfolio.

 The tactical side of the integration process should be completed within a year, after which it will be easier for us to chalk out our plans in detail. Of the 20,000 people to be hired this fiscal, around 60 per cent would be for the BPO division, said Sandeep Dhar, president of MphasiS BPO.

 Dhar could not elaborate on the size of the buyouts but said the deal size would be substantially larger than $20 to $30 million that the company would have looked at before acquiring EDS. 

 MphasiS operates out of Ahmedabad, Noida, Pune, Bangalore and Mangalore and Tijuana in Mexico.

 The combined workforce of EDS and MphasiS is 14,000.

 We have to closely watch how the integration process shapes up and accordingly decide on geographical expansion, Dhar said.

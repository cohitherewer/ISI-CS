 Calcutta, Aug. 11: Tata Steel managing director B. Muthuraman said India must aim to enhance its steel production to over 100 million tonnes (mt) by 2020.

 We are in a position to produce over 100 mt of steel, and we must do it. If China can produce nearly 300 mt of steel every year, why cant India? Muthuraman, who took over as the president of the Indian Institute of Metals, said here.

 He said there would be roadblocks and problems, but these were common in other countries also. 

 Even China, the producer of about 300 mt of steel, faced it, he said. 

 Per capita steel consumption in India should be increased from the present level of 30 kg, he added.

 Muthuraman said the world crude steel production had reached 1,132 mt in 2005 with an average annual growth rate of 6 per cent over the last five years.

 With hectic activity in all-round development of infrastructure projects, including roads, ports, airports, railways and housing, India should sustain a consistent overall growth rate of about 9 per cent, he said.

 Muthuraman said aluminium was the second most important metal in the developing economy and India, with its vast resource of bauxite, was poised for substantial growth.

 Currently, aluminium smelting capacity is at one million tonnes, which should rise to two million tonnes in next five years. 

 Pointing out that service sector was given more priority by professionals than the manufacturing sector, Muthuraman said there should be an emphasis on the manufacturing sector in a large country like India to achieve growth.

 If we have to grow at the rate of 10 per cent, we have to do more. We have to convince the young people about a career in the manufacturing sector. We require them for the industry, manufacturing, processing and marketing, he said. 

 One important aspect was the availability of trained and sufficient human resources to serve national growth, he said.

 He said the Indian Institute of Metals would take steps in this direction and co-operate with concerned government departments on policy formulations.

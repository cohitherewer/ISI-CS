The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Hard landing now, easy takeoff later

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 WAITING FOR CLEARANCE

 New Delhi, Jan. 1: Fog or no fog, rain or no rain, the queues for aircraft trying to take off or land in the skies are growing longer every day and it is taking its toll on passenger patience.

 Mumbai airport, which handles more than 200 flights every day, often has aircraft waiting in the sky for up to 45 minutes for permission to land or take off.

 The capital city or even other metros like Calcutta and Chennai where fewer flights come are not immune to this ordeal. The Delhi air traffic control often delays landing permission in the busy morning and evening hours by at least half-an-hour. Said Indian Airlines director Anil Goel, ?It?s a lucky aircraft which manages to land in time.?

 It is not really traffic control?s fault. Blame it on too many flights. From less than 80 aircraft flying Indian skies, the number has just doubled.

 Moreover, airlines have ordered 220 new aircraft from global aircraft makers and plan to buy more to service the booming domestic sector. 

 Says G.R.Gopinath, founder of Deccan Air, ?We are focused on the domestic market. It?s growing at a phenomenal rate.? India?s average annual air travel is just 0.1 trips per person, a fraction of the global average of 2. Last year, Sydney-based consultancy Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation (CAPA) found that the Chinese took only 0.13 flights per capita in 2003, lagging behind Malaysia (0.60), Thailand (0.25), the Philippines (0.19) and Indonesia (0.15).

 For every extra minute an airline has to keep its planes flying as a result of this congestion, it incurs an additional fuel cost Rs 6,000 per aircraft.

 The way out is, of course, simple. Construct more runways at major airports. But then that is said more easily than done. The Mumbai airport is ringed by slums. Delhi has space but it also has problems with a privatisation plan.

 Calcutta and Chennai have still to decide how to go about solving this problem. A high-powered parliamentary panel on transport has recommended developing greenfield airports for both Delhi and Mumbai instead of going in for costly makeovers of existing cramped airfields.

 There will be other growth pains as well. Airlines on a growth trajectory are already hit by a severe shortage of pilots and aircraft engineers and are trying to hammer together a ?no poaching pact? among themselves. 

 ?A surge in aviation growth in the Asia-Pacific region quickly absorbs whatever supply there is,? admits Kapil Kaul, vice-president of CAPA.

 ?Airport infrastructure will come of age. New pilots will get trained. The short-term future might look messy, but the long-term is bright,? says Sudipto Bose, an independent aviation analyst.

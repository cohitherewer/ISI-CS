It used to be at 7 per cent two years ago.

 The revenues generated from non-metro towns and cities, which was at 10 per cent of the turnover value two years ago, is expected to go up to 25 per cent this fiscal covering 50 towns and cities.

 We recently acquired more space and started a brand new office in Calcutta with seven employees, which is expected to go up to 20 by the end of 2007. Cisco Systems has already added 20 tier-II partners and the increased sales force will be utilised in servicing over 500 customers in and around Calcutta, said Jangoo Dalal, senior vice-president and country manager of Cisco Systems (India) Pvt Ltd.

 The SMB growth in the east is at its highest at 40 per cent, while the national average is 25 per cent.

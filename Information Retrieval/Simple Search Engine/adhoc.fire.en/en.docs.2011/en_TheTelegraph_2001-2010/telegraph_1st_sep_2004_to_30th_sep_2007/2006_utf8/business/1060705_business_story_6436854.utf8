 Patni to pay $33 m additional tax

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, July 4: Patni Computer Systems is set to restate its financial results for 2003 and 2004 following a tax review of its US operations. The company has to take up additional tax liabilities of $23-$33 million.

 The US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) had started with the tax review of Patnis operations for the years 2001 and 2002 and expanded it to cover 2003 and 2004.

 The review in respect of years 2001 and 2002 is close to complete, and as a result of that process, the company is re-assessing its obligations for corporate taxes, payroll and related taxes, interest and related expenses for the years 2001-05, and is revising its earlier estimates in respect of such obligations, Patni said.

 After the IRS review, the company is planning to restate its 2003 and 2004 financial statements under US GAAP to reflect additional tax liabilities.

 Part of these liabilities would be stated in the results of 2003-04 and between $4 million to $14 million will be recorded in the companys results of the quarter ended June 30, 2006, Patni said.

 The company currently does not expect that any adjustment will be taken in its 2005 financial statements.

 While a portion of the additional tax provisions will be recorded in the financial statements for 2003 and 2004, it will be done through a restatement saying that the revisions represent a correction of an error.

 Patni, however, did not reveal the details of the review. 

 The review will delay the filing of PCS annual report with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). It is expected to be done by July 15.

 The news saw the Patni scrip sagging on the bourses. On the BSE, the share closed at Rs 325, down Rs 9.80 or nearly 3 per cent over its last close.

 Patni has forged a strategic alliance with Clear Technology Inc, a software solutions company serving the insurance financial services and healthcare industries. Under the agreement, Patni will provide worldwide process consulting and system integration services for Clear Technologys insurance and financial services solutions.

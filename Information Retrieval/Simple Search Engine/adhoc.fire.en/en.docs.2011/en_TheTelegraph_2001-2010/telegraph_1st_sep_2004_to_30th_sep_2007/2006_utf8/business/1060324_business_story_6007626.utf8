 Cabinet clears 3% hike in DA

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 23: The Union cabinet today approved a 3 per cent hike in dearness allowance for government employees in what appears to be a poll-eve gesture. Assembly elections are round the corner in four states and a Union territory.

 Parliamentary affairs minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, however, refused to make any announcement, saying certain decisions that the cabinet had taken were referred to the Election Commission.

 The decision on dearness allowance was disclosed by commerce minister Kamal Nath informally to journalists after the meeting.

 With Assembly elections in Bengal, Assam, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Pondicherry round the corner, the sop for central government staff is expected to send the signal that the government cares for them. Moreover, most state governments benchmark salaries for their staff to the Centres pay scales.

 Telecom FDI

 The cabinet today extended the deadline for telecom companies to comply with the guidelines on foreign direct investment by four months.

 The cabinet gave its ex-post-facto approval to the July 2 deadline set by the government. Telecom companies had time till March 3 to comply with FDI norms to raise the FDI ceiling from 49 per cent to 74 per cent, but the government had issued a notification extending the deadline by four months.

 In another decision, the cabinet approved the sale of the entire equity holding of ITI Ltd in its joint venture, Fibcom India Ltd. 

 DEPB scheme

 The government today extended the duty entitlement passbook (DEPB) scheme by another year as a new plan for exporters was not yet finalised.

 The government had decided to scrap the scheme as it was not WTO-compatible and replace it with a new one to provide incentives to exporters.

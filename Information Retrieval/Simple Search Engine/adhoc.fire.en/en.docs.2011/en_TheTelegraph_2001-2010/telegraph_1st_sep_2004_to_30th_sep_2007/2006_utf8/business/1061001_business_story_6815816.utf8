 Lupin bucks merger trend

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Check point

 Mumbai, Sept. 30: The pharmaceutical industry, in recent times, has been witnessing mergers and acquisitions of different scales. But heres one that has not progressed according to the plan.

 Lupin has decided not to pursue the purchase of Belgian firm Artifex Finance CVA. The deal would have given Lupin control over an anti-malarial unit of the company.

 In May, Lupin, which is a major player in the anti-TB and cepholosporin segments, had signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to acquire a 51 per cent stake in Artifex Finance along with its subsidiaries, including Dafra Pharma Ltd.

 Based on subsequent discussions, both the parties have now mutually agreed not to pursue the said MoU and to independently pursue their respective business plans and continue discussions for possible areas of co-operation in the future, a press statement issued today by Lupin said without elaborating on the reasons behind this move.

 While sources said Lupin was unhappy over a due diligence report that was conducted on the Belgian company, it is understood that the management of Dafra was not keen on handing over management control to Lupin. This, however, could not be verified with the Lupin management.

 The acquisition of Artifex would have enabled Lupin to gain an entry into the anti-malarial segment, thereby complementing its existing portfolio. 

 Dafra is a dedicated anti-malarial company that provides a complete basket of ACTs, including a paediatric suspension, and it holds a patent on a new combination therapy that cures malaria in 24 hours. The unit has developed a marketing and distribution network covering over 25 countries in Africa and it works with the national malaria boards in various countries.

 Earlier this year, the World Health Organisation had urged pharmaceutical companies to stop selling Artemisinin, a malaria drug that is based on an ancient Chinese herbal remedy, as single-drug treatment because this hastens the development of resistance to the medicine. It now recommends the use of Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs), in order to ensure high cure rates of malaria and to reduce the spread of drug resistance.

 Lupin managing director Kamal Sharma said the company continues to be interested in anti-malarials despite the deal not going through.

 FDA approval

 Lupin has received approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the US for the companys abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) for Lisinopril-HCTZ tablets, which is indicated for the treatment of hypertension.

 The company has informed the Bombay Stock Exchange that it had received the approval for Lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets in different strengths of 10mg/12.5mg, 20mg/12.5mg and 20mg/25mg.

 Feminine fuss about hot wheels

 Shop talk

 New Delhi, Sept. 27: Women love to juggle options whether in boyfriends or in cars.

 A recent JD Power Asia Pacific 2006 study brings out this trait among female new-vehicle buyers in India. 

 With more cars to choose from, women are playing true to type by considering more models than men do before making their final purchase decision.

 Men might see this as an infuriating habit among the ladies they shop with in big malls but carmakers love to see prospective buyers fuss over their purchases as it gives them the opportunity to tom tom the merits of the vehicles they sell.

 The study says 50 per cent of female new-vehicle buyers in India consider at least one other model before purchasing their vehicle.

 Males who predominantly tend to drive the cars zero in on their vehicle of choice without too much of a fuss.

 If men are from Mars and women from Venus, the stark difference between the sexes shows up in the way they buy the vehicles as well.

 Men tend to concentrate on the price and the finance-related aspects, while women tend to focus on styling.

 And no points for guessing the next finding. All brand new vehicle shoppers largely settle for the less expensive option.

 The introduction of new competitively priced models in the small car segment partly explains the surge in female shopping activity, said Mohit Arora, director-India, at JD Power Asia Pacific in Singapore.

 The study identifies as many as 48 possible reasons why shoppers may reject a new vehicle in favour of others.

 In general, shopping activity in the new-vehicle market has increased by a negligible percentage point this year over 2005, states the study.

 The study states that Maruti Suzuki beats others in persuading shoppers to consider the brand, with nearly 45 per cent of shoppers eventually buying a Maruti model.

 Customers who shop for cars of companies like Hyundai, Tata Motors and Toyota Kirloskar Motors tend to check out more models before they decide on one.

 But customers who prefer to buy cars from Skoda, Mahindra and Chevrolet dont consider second options too often.

 This possibly reflects the unique selling propositions offered by these brands in an attempt to discourage shoppers from considering other models, said Arora.

 However, given the vast number of options available in the new-vehicle market, the challenge for manufacturers is to persuade shoppers to at least consider their models, while simultaneously working to improve sales processes at the dealership.

 These practices help manufacturers close more deals and maximise their returns on investment, the study said.

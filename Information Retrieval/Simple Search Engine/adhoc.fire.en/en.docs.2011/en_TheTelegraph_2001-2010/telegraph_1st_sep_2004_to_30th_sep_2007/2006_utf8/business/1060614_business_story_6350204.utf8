 UTI Mutual readies third overseas option

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 13: UTI Mutual Fund has drawn up a third offshore investment scheme in case market regulator Sebi does not approve of its two proposed schemes ? Global Titans 50 Index and Global Navigator Fund. 

 We will come up with a new offshore investment scheme, Desh Videsh Fund, if Global Titans and Global Navigator funds do not get the regulators nod, said a senior official of UTI Asset Management Company Pvt Ltd. 

 The Desh Videsh Fund will invest at least 65 per cent of its corpus in domestic companies and the remaining 35 per cent in companies abroad 

 The US-based State Street Global Advisors, with which UTI entered into a strategic tie-up last year, will advise it on overseas investment.

 UTI had proposed to invest at least 80 per cent of the money to be raised from domestic investors under its Global Navigator scheme in companies listed on the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the remaining 20 per cent in domestic companies. Global Titans 50 Index was supposed to be a pure index fund based on the Dow Jones.

 The two offshore investment schemes of UTI Mutual Fund, which has over Rs 30,000 crore of assets under management, have been on hold for quite some time. In its last budget, the finance ministry has allowed domestic mutual funds to invest up to $2 billion in overseas securities and has also removed the clause that they could invest only in those foreign companies which hold at least 10 per cent in an Indian subsidiary. Following this, mutual funds now have a wider choice compared with just 45 companies earlier.

 After the budget announcement, Sebi had asked the Association of Mutual Funds in India (Amfi) to suggest guidelines regarding overseas investments by domestic mutual funds. Amfi had set up a committee which submitted its report on June 1. However, Sebi has not yet made the details of the report public. 

 UTI is also awaiting the market regulators approval for its proposal to take over a technology firm. Being a mutual fund we are not allowed to buy out a company. This needs a special amendment in the acts governing mutual funds and we are hopeful Sebi will soon give its nod to our proposal of acquiring a technology firm, the UTI official said, adding that the fund house has already short-listed the firm but declined to divulge further details.

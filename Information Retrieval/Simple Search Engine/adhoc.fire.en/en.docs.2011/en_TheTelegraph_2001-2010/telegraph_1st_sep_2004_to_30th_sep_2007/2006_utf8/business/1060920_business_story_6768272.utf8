 Lalu roots for loco factory in Bihar

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Looking ahead

 New Delhi, Sept. 19: Railway minister Lalu Prasad has proposed to set up a locomotive factory at Marhaura in Saran district of Bihar and a rail coach factory at Rae Bareilly in Uttar Pradesh.

 Lalu Prasad told the parliamentary consultative committee for MPs attached to his ministry here today that the new factories would meet the increasing demand for more engines and coaches and also generate employment in these areas.

 Moreover, railway stations at the four metros and some big cities will have world-class standards, complete with modern facilities like shopping malls, food plazas and underground parking, the minister said.

 Union ministers of state for railways R. Velu and Naranbhai J. Rathwa, members of the Railway Board and other senior officials from the ministry and Konkan Railway Corporation were also present at the meeting. 

 The railway minister said accidents at railway crossings had become a burning issue. It has been seen that either the level crossings do not fulfil the prescribed parameters for construction of road over bridges (ROBs) or road under bridges (RUBs) or there is reluctance on the part of state governments to meet the 50 per cent expenditure to be paid by them, he added.

 The minister said demands are being raised for more level crossings. This is because immediately after the railway track is laid, villages and settlements come up in nearby areas.

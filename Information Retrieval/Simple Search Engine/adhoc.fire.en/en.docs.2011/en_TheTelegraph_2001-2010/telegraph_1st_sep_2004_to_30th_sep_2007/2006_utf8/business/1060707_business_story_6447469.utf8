 New Delhi, July 6: Bharti Airtel today launched a fixed wireless phone service based on GSM technology. It has also introduced a tariff of Rs 1.20 for a three-minute call to all local and intra-circle mobiles under the new service.

 Bharti has a small fixed-line base and is concentrating only on high-margin customers in this segment.

 The fixed-line market in India is currently under-served largely because of inadequate infrastructure, said Sanjay Kapoor, joint president of Bharti. 

 Bharti will roll out the service in 4,000 towns and villages, but plans to gradually extend it to the rest of the country.

 The tariff for the Bharti service ? christened Airtel Mega ? is Rs 1.20 for a three-minute local, intra-circle call to mobile phones. This means that only 40 paise a minute will be charged for a local as well as intra-circle (within a telecom circle) call to any mobile for both GSM or CDMA, Kapoor said. Calls to fixed phones will be charged at Rs 1.20 per minute, while STD calls will cost Rs 2.40 per minute.

 Reliance Communications recently launched a fixed wireless plan ? Hello Capital ? with a tariff of Rs 1.20 for three minutes within its own fixed wireless network in 19 state capitals.

 Airtel Mega would also offer value-added services like hello tunes, SMS and caller ID.

 The company is targeting 1 million subscribers in the first year and the service will be available with pre-paid and post-paid tariff options.

 The fixed wireless phone will have a 10-digit number. These will look like desktop phones, with one cordless option. As part of the introductory offer, the company is offering free home-to-mobile calls.

 Our research has shown that 70-80 per cent of outgoing calls are to mobile phones and we have fixed the tariff accordingly, said a senior Bharti official.

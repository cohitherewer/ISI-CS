 Mumbai, June 16: In a big-ticket acquisition, leading offshore drilling services provider Aban Loyd Chiles Offshore Ltd (Alco), today said its Singapore subsidiary would scoop up a 33.76 per cent stake in Norway-based Sinvest ASA for $445 million. 

 Aban Singapore Pte Ltd yesterday entered into a share purchase agreement with the Skeie Group to acquire 20,491,870 shares in Sinvest, which is listed on the Oslo bourse.

 Alco said the total equity value of Sinvest is $1.32 billion and the enterprise value is $2.25 billion. The substantial stake in Sinvest would help Aban Loyds business and would place it into the league of top 10 offshore drilling service providers in terms of assets under management, it added.

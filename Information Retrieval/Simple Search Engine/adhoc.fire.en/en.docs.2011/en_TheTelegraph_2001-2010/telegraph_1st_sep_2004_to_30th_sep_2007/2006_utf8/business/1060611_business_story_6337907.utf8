 Bangalore, June 10 (PTI): N. R. Narayana Murthy today said he would step down as chairman and chief mentor of Infosys Technologies on August 20, the day he turns 60, and made it clear that he was ready to continue as non-executive chairman of the Nasdaq-listed software firm.

 ?I will be completing 60 years of age on August 20. If the board of directors in its meeting on July 10 and 11 would decide that I should continue as non-executive chairman for whatever term that they want me to be, I will be thrilled and privileged to continue in that capacity,? he told reporters in response to questions after the companys 25th annual general meeting here.

 At the same meeting, the board of directors would decide on the next chief mentor as the position has to be donned by an executive person, ?somebody who comes to the office everyday and spends at least eight hours a day,? he said. Infosys was floated with a capital of Rs 10,000 in 1981. It clocked a revenue of $2.15 billion in 2005-06, and has today over 52,000 employees and a market capitalisation of around $20 billion.

 On plans after retirement from Infosys, Murthy said his presence on the board of several companies and universities abroad would keep him busy, and ruled out joining politics.

 ?All that I would say that I do spend a large part of my time outside of India because I am on the board of several companies, on the advisory boards of several companies and universities in the US, Europe and Asia Pacific. That will keep me busy, definitely,? he said. ?Anyway I am not interested (to get into politics).? 

 Best is yet to come

 Narayana Murthy said the best is yet to come for Infosys, and wanted that women should constitute 50 per cent of the workforce in the company in the next 25 years.

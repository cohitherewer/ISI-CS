 Cairn in big-bang flotation drill

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Oct. 12: Cairn India, a subsidiary of Cairn Energy Plc, today filed offer documents with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) for its maiden offer in December. Cairn India could raise $1.5-2 billion through the offering, thereby making it Indias largest IPO till date. 

 Cairn today said preparations are on track for the IPO launch in December 2006, assuming that the required approvals come through and market conditions remain favourable. 

 As part of these preparations, Cairn India has filed a draft offer document with Sebi. The draft red herring prospectus will also be filed with the Bombay and National stock exchanges, the company said. 

 The flotation will involve an offer of 53.85 crore Cairn India shares. 

 The parent will hold 69.5 per cent in Cairn India following the flotation. 

 In line with regulatory requirements and market practice in India, the prospectus includes details regarding Cairn India and the offer of new shares but does not include pricing information and other information, which has not yet been finalised. 

 Though Cairn did not disclose the price band for the proposed offering, it is understood that the IPO could be the largest in India so far.

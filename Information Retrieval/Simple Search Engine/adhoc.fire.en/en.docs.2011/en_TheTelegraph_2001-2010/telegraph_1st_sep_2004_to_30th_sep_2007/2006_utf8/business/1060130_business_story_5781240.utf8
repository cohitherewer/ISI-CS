 Revival potion for rural banks

 ON YOUR ACCOUNT

 Mumbai, Jan. 29: Union finance minister P. Chidambaram is likely to announce a recapitalisation package worth Rs 4,000 crore for certain loss-making regional rural banks (RRBs) in the Union Budget 2006-07.

 The measure will come at a time when these RRBs are being merged into a single entity within a particular state by their sponsor commercial banks to improve performance. Such a merger process has resulted in the number of RRBs coming down to 162 from 196.

 It is estimated that by March, their number will be further lowered to 65. The sponsor banks hold 35 per cent of the RRBs equity. The remaining stake is split between the Centre (50 per cent) and the state governments (15 per cent).

 Sources said though the performance of RRBs have improved over the last couple of years, a few still suffer losses. It is expected there will be around 65 RRBs by March. Of them, nearly one-third will be loss-making, they added.

 Banking circles expect the Union finance minister to announce a Rs 4,000-crore recapitalisation package or make certain budgetary provisions to resuscitate the loss-making RRBs.

 The total amount of funding estimated is close to Rs 4,000 crore. This is likely to be split between the three stakeholders ? the Centre, state governments and the sponsor banks. The Centre may pump in close to Rs 2,000 crore with the rest coming from the other two, sources added. 

 RRBs do not expect any resistance from the state governments to such a proposal as they have been taking an active interest in improving the banks financial health.

 Bengal, for instance, is keen to merge the RRBs to form a single entity. However, this proposal has met with a roadblock as a couple of the sponsor banks are not keen on transferring the ownership to another bank.

 The three commercial banks that sponsor RRBs in the state include United Bank of India, Uco Bank and State Bank of India. Among them, while United Bank of India has amalgamated five of its RRBs into one, Uco Bank has merged three such banks.

RBI move

 The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has permitted IT-enabled rural outlets of corporate entities, agri business centres and NGOs to act as intermediaries to provide financial and banking services in these banks, a move seen by the unions as allowing outsourcing in PSU banks, which they would oppose.

 A recent RBI notification said this was being done to ensure greater financial inclusion and increase the reach of the banking sector. 

 It has been decided in public interest to enable banks to use the services of NGO/self-help groups, micro finance institutions and other civil society organisations as intermediaries in providing financial and banking services through the use of business facilitator and correspondent models, it said.

 The United Forum of Bank Union, an umbrella group of 10 unions, representing over 10 lakh workers, has opposed the decision saying this defeated the purpose of spending Rs 4,000 crore by various banks in the last one year to modernise facilities for customers.

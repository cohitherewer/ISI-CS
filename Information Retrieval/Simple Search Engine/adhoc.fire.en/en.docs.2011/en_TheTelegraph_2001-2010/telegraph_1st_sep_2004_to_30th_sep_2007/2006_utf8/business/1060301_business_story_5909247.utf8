The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Economic logic of political balance

 GUEST COLUMN - ANUP K. SINHA

 One good sign about Indian economys 

 improved performance is that while there is still considerable 

 interest in the Union budget proposals, the hype preceding 

 its presentation has diminished. Perhaps, this is a result 

 of the fact that budgets are no longer dramatic in terms 

 of announcements that break with the past or contain major 

 new policy signals. In other words as the economy grows 

 on an impressive and reasonably stable path, budgets become 

 more predictable and reflect continuity with the past. The 

 latest budget is in that sense a mature exercise, reflecting 

 the economic priorities of the government, tempered by the 

 political balancing act that coalition governance entails.

 The news has been good on the 

 macroeconomic front. Growth and inflation rates are both 

 acceptable numbers. 

 In the backdrop of this macro 

 picture, the fiscal management (and the target regarding 

 fiscal deficit) is relatively easier. The service tax has 

 been increased and broadened, but is anyway not being considered 

 steep enough to distort incentives for growth. The fringe 

 benefit tax is obviously contentious and there has been 

 an attempt to rationalise it. It is important that it does 

 not stifle business development. However, it should not 

 be a screen for perquisites that dodge income tax. On this 

 tax, my feeling is that there will be some learning and 

 fine tuning yet, in the next two or three years before we 

 can come to a steady state.

 The finance minister has mentioned 

 about a mix of head and heart going into the preparation 

 of the budget. That should be obvious. In a polity such 

 as ours, no consensus can ever emerge where purely rational 

 decisions are not blended with compassion. 

 I will briefly comment on two 

 measures contained in this budget. The first pertains to 

 the special need for letting farmers access institutional 

 credit from banks, and the need to ensure a low cost of 

 credit to sustain farm growth at 4 per cent. Institutional 

 credit, its easy access and low cost are certainly import 

 for agricultural growth. However, I think the time has come 

 to take a fresh look at land distribution, operational holdings 

 and agricultural technology. 

 The second is about urban growth 

 of theme cities and the funding of proposals from West Bengal 

 and Karnataka. The concept of theme cities such as a health 

 city or an IT city are novel.

 It signals government endorsement 

 of a new type of urban agglomeration that might have very 

 focussed sector wise economic effects. I am not very confident 

 about single themes being able to induce general urban growth. 

 Under the the Fiscal Responsibility 

 and Budget Management Act, RBI will no longer be the debt 

 manager and underwriter of the last resort for government 

 borrowings from April 1, 2006. This will help the RBI to 

 focus on monetary policy while the government borrowing 

 strategies will be disciplined by market conditions. This 

 will be a significant break from the past. If open market 

 operations are to be significant instruments of monetary 

 policy, the RBI will have to develop greater accuracy in 

 predicting liquidity needs of the market. 

 On the other hand, as far as budgetary 

 expenditure plans are concerned and the governments 

 borrowing programme there could be some unanticipated shocks. 

 This year will be a test case as to whether, on its own, 

 the government can manage to find the best prices and exert 

 adequate influence on the interest rate structure in a developing 

 but hardly mature bond market.

 The sophistication of budget making 

 is not often an indication of how well the economy actually 

 performs. It should also be remembered that the human 

 face is yet to wear a smile.

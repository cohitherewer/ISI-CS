 Aussie help for Bengal mines

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Nov. 22: Australia is keen to help Bengal in deep mining of coal and share the technologies it uses for safe mining.

 Australia is a leading coal exporter accounting for 30 per cent of global trade.

 Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee held talks on this with Ian Macfarlane, the Australian minister for industry, tourism and resources.

 We had discussions and the chief minister seemed keen on upgrading the deep mining technology for coal. Australia has a long-standing experience in this sector and also in safe mining technology. Further discussions would continue through the Australian ambassadors office here, said Macfarlane.

 Bengal, which has witnessed accidents and loss of lives through illegal mining, has 72 closed mines which the state government wants the Centre to hand over to the Mineral Development Corporation. 

 Some of these mines are so deep that the state does not have the requisite machinery for mining. Countries like Australia and South Africa, however, have the required technical expertise.

 Australia also contributes over 50 per cent of the trade in metallurgical coal. The country has become a popular destination for investment in coal leases.

 Though traditional leases are closely held by existing players, the Australian coal industry will expand to add 92 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of new capacity.

 Macfarlene also held talks with the Coal India authorities.

 The issues discussed were the availability and supply of technology to the Indian coal industry and Coal Indias investment opportunities in Australia.

 The investment could either be through 100 per cent ownership or part ownership of an existing operation.

 Australia has 36 per cent of the worlds low-cost resources of uranium but since India is not a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the country is unable to supply to India.

 Indian investments amount to A$1 billion and the Australian government is also funding a study of the Indian gas market to identify opportunities for trade in this sector.

 BSNL finger on the pulse

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 17: Bharat Sanchar Nigam (BSNL) today slashed the rates for calls that its customers make to other fixed-line networks like Reliance and Bharti by 75 per cent to Rs 1.20 per 3-minute call. Earlier, calls to these networks were charged at a 45-second pulse which placed the cost of a 3-minute call at Rs 4.80.

 The rate cut was announced on the day that the International Telecommunication Union celebrates as the World Telecom Day and corrects one of the major discrepancies in call tariffs.

 The state-owned telephony giant also reduced call charges within the circle to other networks by 25 per cent by reducing the rates from Rs 1.60 a minute to Rs 1.20 a minute. For calls from BSNL fixed phones to other fixed networks over 50 km, pulse rates were increased from 45 seconds to 60 seconds.

 There is a 25 per cent reduction in intra-circle calls from landline subscribers to other networks with the tariffs being reduced from Rs 1.60 per minute to Rs 1.20 per minute. The wireless-in-local-loop (WiLL) service of BSNL has been made cheaper and tariffs brought on a par with the BSNL landline rates.

 The BSNL rates will now be among the cheapest in the country and easily top Reliance lowest call rate of 75 paise per minute, or Rs 2.25 per 3-minute call, for calls to other networks.

 The pulse rate for calls made over distances greater than 50 km has been increased to 60 seconds from 45 seconds.

 Since last September, the number of mobile phone subscribers have exceeded the landline users and the likelihood of making calls outside the network are much greater. Todays rate cuts address a pressing issue for all its landline users.

 The tariffs have been simplified making them uniform for both on-net and off-net calls. In an attempt to make tariffs simpler and to encourage greater traffic in the fixed-line business, we have rationalised the pulse rate for fixed-line customers, said A.K. Sinha, chairman and managing director of BSNL.

 The disparity was there due to the per minute access deficit levy where a BSNL-to-BSNL local call was charged at Rs 1.20 for three minutes while it was Rs 4.80 a minute for the other networks. 

 Similarly, from fixed BSNL phones to WiLL phones of other networks, the pulse rates have been increased from 45 seconds to 60 seconds, while to its own network this was increased from 90 to 180 seconds. Calls from BSNL fixed phones to cell networks of other operators would now be charged at 60 seconds pulse rate instead of 45 seconds. 

 From a BSNLs WiLL network to fixed network of other operators, the pulse rate would now be 60 seconds from the earlier 45 seconds, while for its own network, this would be 180 seconds instead of 90 seconds earlier.

 From a BSNL WiLL phone to another WiLL network, the new pulse rates are 60 seconds for other networks instead of 45 seconds and to other cellular operators, it will now be 60 seconds pulse instead of 45 seconds.

 The tariffs have been simplified. Uniform charges for both own network and other networks from fixed lines and WiLL services of BSNL have been made cheaper and tariffs have been brought on par with fixed line charges, Sinha said.

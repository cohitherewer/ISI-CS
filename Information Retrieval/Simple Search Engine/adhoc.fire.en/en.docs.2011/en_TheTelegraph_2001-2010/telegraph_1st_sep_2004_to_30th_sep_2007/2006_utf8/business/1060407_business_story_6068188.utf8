 Sebi norm to put new MF offers on slow lane

 Calcutta, April 5: New fund offers (NFOs) from mutual funds with no entry load may soon become a thing of the past. The number of new offerings is also likely to reduce considerably in the coming days.

 A Sebi circular on rationalisation of issue expenses on Tuesday puts mutual funds in a bind ? asset management companies will have to bear the entire issue expenses, pass it on to investors or share the burden with investors.

 According to the circular, open-ended (mutual fund) schemes should meet the sales and distribution costs of plans from the entry load and not through initial issue expenses. This becomes applicable to all open-ended schemes launched on and after the date of the circular or April 4, 2006.

 Fund houses are most likely to increase or impose an entry load in their forthcoming schemes, thereby passing on a part of their initial issue expenses to investors, said Rajiv Shastri, CEO of Sahara Asset Management Company.

 Technically, mutual funds can raise the NFO entry load up to 6 per cent from 2.25 per cent now, if they have to meet their initial issue expenses from it. But such a move is unlikely because it will put off investors from subscribing to a new fund. Asset management companies will have to rework their draft offer documents awaiting Sebi approval to accommodate the new expense structure. In any case, a marginal rise of 0.5-0.75 percentage point in the entry load is expected in the schemes that will be launched soon, Shastri said.

 UTI Asset Management Company executive director D.S.R. Murthy said, Mutual funds will have to significantly lower their issue-related expenses. All our NFOs come with an entry load of 2.25 per cent, which we may not have to increase as our issue expenses are much lower than others. 

 But if we talk about the fallout in general, investors should not expect an NFO without an entry load from now on. Moreover, there will definitely not be as many NFOs as in the past, he added.

 The market regulator allows companies to spend up to 6 per cent of the NFO funds on initial issue expenses relating to advertisements, distribution, commissions, publication of issue materials and documents. The companies have so long been amortising or dividing the initial expenses in equal instalments over five years and charging the same to the schemes fund.

 While some fund houses have been charging a part of their expenses to an entry load levied on the NFO, others have been offering funds with no entry load and amortising the expenses over five years, said Dhirendra Kumar, CEO of Value Research.

 CSN joins the Corus with 475-pence counter-offer

 OUR BUREAU AND AGENCIES

 Nov. 17: Brazils Companhia Siderurgica Nacional (CSN) has approached the Corus Group with a takeover offer that threatens to outsmart Tata Steels bid for the Anglo-Dutch steelmaker.

 In an official statement to the London Stock Exchange on Friday, the Brazilian group said, CSN has approached the board of Corus regarding a proposal to acquire the company at a price of 475 pence per ordinary share in cash. 

 CSNs offer of 475 pence per share tops an earlier agreed bid by Tata Steel of 455 pence per share. While the CSN offer values Corus at $8.5 billion, the Tata bid pegs the companys worth at $8.1 billion.

 The CSN overture comes 17 days before the crucial extraordinary general meeting where Corus shareholders are slated to vote on the Tata Steel offer made on October 20. 

 However, the Corus share price stayed ahead of the offers, closing 4.8 per cent higher at 495-1/2 pence on LSE.

 Late in the night Corus acknowledged a counter-offer for its acquisition by CSN but reserved its comments.

 Corus notes the recent announcement by CSN and confirms that it has this afternoon received an approach by CSN, a Corus spokesperson said.

 She said, A further announcement by Corus will be made in due course.

 Tata Steel, however, remained tightlipped and company officials said they had no comment to make at this point of time.

 The combination of CSN and Corus would create a top five global steel group with 24 million tonnes of annual steel production and, by 2010, approximately 50 million tonnes of annual iron ore production, CSN said.

 Experts believe CSNs move will spark off a bidding war and Tata Steel will have to come out with a better offer. 

 Though CSN said the final offer would be contingent upon the completion of due diligence, formalisation of financial arrangement and approval of the Corus board, the Brazilian company indicated that it is not averse to even a hostile bid. 

 CSN, of late, has bought into Corus and now owns 3.8 per cent stake through market purchases. 

 A combination of CSN and Corus would create a global powerhouse with market leading positions and exceptional distribution networks across both developed and emerging markets, CSN chief executive Benjamin Steinbruch said in a statement.

 Reacting to the CSN move, Standard Life Investments, the largest investor in Corus with a 7.5 per cent stake, said, It is not surprising that another bidder has emerged. It will be interesting to see how events develop.

 New Delhi, April 19: Ranbaxy Laboratory has reported a marginal rise in net profit at Rs 71.4 crore for the first quarter ended March 31 compared with Rs 70.8 crore in the same period last fiscal.

 The board today approved the audited accounts for the year ended December 31, 2005 and the unaudited results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2006.

 It has recommended a final dividend of Rs 6 per share. Last fiscal, the company had paid an interim dividend of Rs 2.50 per share, bringing the total dividend to Rs 8.5 per share for 2005.

 Ranbaxys global consolidated sales grew 12.03 per cent at Rs 1,275.3 crore during the first quarter compared with Rs 1,138.3 crore in the year-ago period, the company said.

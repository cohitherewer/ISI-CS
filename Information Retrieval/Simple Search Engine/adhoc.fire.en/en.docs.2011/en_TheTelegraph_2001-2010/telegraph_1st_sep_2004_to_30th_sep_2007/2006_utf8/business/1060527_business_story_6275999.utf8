 Calcutta, May 26: The Bengal government and the Hunan province of China will soon enter into a strategic tie-up for co-operation in economy, trade, science and technology among others.

 Officials of the Hunan province and the state government signed a letter of intent today in the presence of the governor of Hunan province, Zhou Bo Hua, and Bengal industry minister Nirupam Sen.

 At an interactive session organised by Ficci-eastern region and Calcutta Chamber of Commerce today, Sen said the delegation of industry executives from Hunan has chosen Bengal as their first destination in India.

 While Hunan houses industries in the automotive sector, machine tools and aero engines apart from 10 million-tonne capacity of steel production, Bengal is a power-surplus state with expertise in engineering, steel and other industries, the minister added.

 Sen said Hunan and Bengal have the possibility of co-operation in several sectors.

 The Hunan governor said he was impressed with the presentation on industrial scenario in Bengal.

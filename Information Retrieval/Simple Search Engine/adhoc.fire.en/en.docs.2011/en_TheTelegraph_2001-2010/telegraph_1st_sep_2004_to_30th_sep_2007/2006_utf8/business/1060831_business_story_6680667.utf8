 Cool car

 New Delhi, Aug. 30 (PTI): German luxury carmaker BMW today said it would begin production here early next year and expected to sell around 1,000 units in the first year of operations. It will manufacture the 3 and the 5 series models here.

 The first car will be delivered to our dealers by February or March next year and we hope to have 8-9 dealers across major metros by 2009, BMW India president Peter Kronschnable said in Gurgaon, where the company will have the headquarters of its Indian subsidiary.

 Kronschnable said the company is investing 20 million euros (Rs 110 crore) to set up a plant in Chennai. The plant will have an initial production capacity of 1,700 units per annum on a one-shift basis.

 While deliveries of the 3 series cars would start by March, the locally-produced 5 series models would be available by May-June, he added.

 These will be available in both petrol and diesel versions and will carry a localisation of around 10 per cent to begin with, he said. 

 Kronschnable said the company, which will be employing 150 people at its factory and another 50 at its headquarters, would have dealers in cities such as Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Bangalore and Chandigarh. He said BMW saw India as a strategic market with high potential.

 We expect to sell 5,000 units in the luxury car segment in 2007, which will cost over Rs 20 lakh. We hope the figures will double by 2010.

 Going by the initial testing, the locally produced cars will have adaptations specially designed for the Indian market, including higher ground clearance, protection plate under the engine and additional air filter.

 When asked whether the company has plans to introduce the 7 series models and four-wheel drives, Kronschnable said the company would decide on this after 2009 and it would follow the completely-built-unit import route till then.

 Asked if BMW had plans to bring cars from group company Mini, he said a decision would be taken after 2009, after taking into account the prevailing market conditions at that time.

 BMW is also setting up a financing arm through its Indian subsidiary, which will take care of the needs of its dealers and potential customers.

 We are about to sign an agreement with banks for this purpose, which is likely to be announced in the next four to six weeks, Kronschnable said.

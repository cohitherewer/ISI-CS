 Raman Roy to tango with Lankan firm

 Roy: Dream weaver

 Colombo, Jan. 4 (PTI): John Keells Holdings, a diversified Sri Lankan firm, today announced a joint venture with Raman Roy and Associates to set up a $22-million call centre in New Delhi by mid-April.

 The 1,000-seater operation in the Capital will allow the Sri Lankan conglomerate a foothold in the lucrative business process outsourcing (BPO) business in India, which is set to grow at 10 per cent annually, company officials said.

 The strategy will show us which part of the BPO chain we should focus on, John Keells director Ronnie Peiris told reporters.

 Sri Lanka has been playing catch up to India to get a slice of the $700-billion BPO business. But serious players have skipped the island due to lack of infrastructure and trained staff although the literacy rate is second to Japans.

 The BPO business in Sri Lanka is small in size ... Theres a shortage of skilled people, too. We are fairly confident that these things can be overcome as the project moves along, said Raman Roy.

 The joint venture has selected India for the initial phase due to the countrys established brand presence in the global BPO market, Peiris said. If we want to make a foray into the BPO business, it would be foolhardy to start off with building a Sri Lankan brand. India was the natural first choice of everyone on John Keells team, Peiris added. 

 Roy said the BPO operation would offer services ranging from the basic data entry work to high value-added knowledge process outsourcing business (KPO).

 BPOs mainly deal with customer care and technical support through communications, telemarketing and transaction processing. A KPO involves high-end processes like legal, valuation, research, investment researches, patent filing and insurance claims.

 John Keells is the second largest listed firm in terms of market capitalisation in Sri Lanka and it has diversified to logistics, leisure, food and beverage, property development, financial services and information technology.

 It, however, has always performed below expectations and the company chairman Susantha Ratnayake hopes the partnership would grow to become a sizeable part of our portfolio.

 With around 30 operators, Sri Lankas BPO industry is worth about $100 million, according to a survey.

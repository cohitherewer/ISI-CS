 Posco buys 9.8% in Uzbek gas field

 Seoul, Dec. 23 (Reuters): Posco, the worlds third-largest steel maker, has secured a stake in an Uzbek natural gas field in a bid to obtain stable energy resources, a company spokesperson said on Saturday. 

 Posco had acquired a 9.8 per cent stake in the Uzbek field from a business lobby group, the Korea Federation of Small and Medium Business, the two groups said in a statement. 

 South Korea holds a 20 per cent stake in the Uzbek gas field with state-run Korea National Oil Corporation (KNOC) having 10.2 per cent. 

 Posco would pay about 8 per cent of its share of profits from the field to the lobby group, after deducting expenses, once the field proved successful, the groups said. 

 We want to secure stable energy resources, especially gas, by entering the energy business, the Posco spokesperson said. 

 In August, KNOC signed a $20-million production-sharing pact with the Uzbek government that could secure for South Korea 36 million tonnes of liquefied natural gas (LNG) equivalent to natural gas. 

 The deal was finalised almost a year after a preliminary pact that included Russias Lukoil, Uzbekistans state oil and gas holding Uzbekneftegaz, Malaysias state oil firm Petronas and Chinas CNPC, parent of listed PetroChina. 

 Uzbekneftegaz said the deal covers a period of 35 years and entitles investors to a 50 per cent share in revenues. The five partners all have equal shares in the field. 

 South Koreas energy ministry said the Aral field may hold as much as 8 trillion cubic feet of gas, although the final reserve figure will be confirmed only after appraisal drilling.

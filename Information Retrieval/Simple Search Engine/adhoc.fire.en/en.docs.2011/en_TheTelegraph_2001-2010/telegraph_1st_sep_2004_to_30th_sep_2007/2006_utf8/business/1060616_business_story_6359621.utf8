 Calcutta, June 15: Cashing in on the new fund-raising opportunities, Uco Bank is planning to restructure its capital base.

 In January, the Reserve Bank allowed banks to raise tier I capital through innovative instruments, such as perpetual non-cumulative preference shares, which will help public sector banks raise funds without diluting the stakes of existing shareholders, particularly the government. This unsecured and paid-up capital will not include voting rights as in case of equity shares.

 ?We are ready with our numbers and we will put the proposal before the board when it meets on July 7,? said chairman-cum-managing director V. Sridar on the sidelines of the third annual general meeting of the bank here today.

 ?Once the board okays it, we will send it to the finance ministry and the RBI for their approvals,? he added.

 The board will also take a decision regarding closing some of the loss-making branches. 

 Uco Bank will also raise Rs 1,100 crore, including tier I and tier II capital, before the end of this month, according to Sridar.

 ?We have already raised Rs 250 crore out of this and will raise Rs 300 crore through perpetual bonds early next week. We want to raise the remaining amount within this quarter before the rate of interest starts inching up again,? Sridar said.

 The bank has not proposed any dividend for 2005-06, as it wants to utilise the profit earnings for additional capital requirements to keep pace with the business growth and comply with Basel II norms that come into effect from March 31 next year.

 The city-based bank, which reported a decline in net profit at Rs 197 crore for 2005-06 against Rs 346 crore in the previous fiscal, expects profitability to remain under pressure this fiscal as well.

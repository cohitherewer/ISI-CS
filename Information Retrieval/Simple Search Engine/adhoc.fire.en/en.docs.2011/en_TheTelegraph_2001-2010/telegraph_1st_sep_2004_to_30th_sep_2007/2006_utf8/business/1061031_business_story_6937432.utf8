 Govt fixes wheat MSP at Rs 750 per quintal

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 30: The government today jacked up the minimum support price (MSP) of wheat to Rs 750 per quintal for the forthcoming rabi marketing season with elections in the wheat growing states of Punjab and Uttar Pradesh round the corner.

 The new MSP is Rs 100 per quintal higher than last years Rs 650 per quintal. Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh as well as senior Congress leaders from Uttar Pradesh had made a strong pitch for an election-eve sop for farmers.

 The MSP for wheat has been fixed at Rs 750 per quintal. This is an adequate and remunerative price, finance minister P. Chidambaram said after a meeting of the cabinet committee on economic affairs.

 Last year, the government increased the MSP of wheat by Rs 50 per quintal but later came under political pressure as this was not considered adequate. It then announced a Rs 50-per-quintal bonus in April, taking the effective MSP to Rs 700 for last year.

 However, there was some heartburn among farmers over the late announcement of the bonus as some of them had already sold their crop. This time around, the government did not want to be caught on the wrong foot from political standpoint.

 On the increase in the economic burden for the government due to the higher wheat MSP for the next season, agriculture minister Sharad Pawar said, The increase in MSP is likely to put an additional burden of Rs 400-500 crore.

 In 2005-06 rabi marketing season, the government was able to procure only 92 lakh tonnes of wheat against the targeted 164 lakh tonnes, owing to large quantities of purchase by private traders directly from the farmers at higher prices.

 The low level of procurement led the government to allow import of the foodgrain in early February this year, after a gap of six years.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Scare vanishes in air

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 24: Lalu Prasads budget has tried to make competition stiffer for low-cost airlines, which have been luring away passengers from prestigious trains like the Rajdhani Express, by cutting the first and second AC fares and offering easy upgrades to these classes.

 However, airlines say they are not scared of the fare cut. SpiceJet director Ajay Singh said, We dont think we will lose out. The cuts announced by the railway minister will stimulate more travel and the passenger shift will be from the third AC to the second or first AC and not from airlines. 

 Singhs logic is that airlines are offering faster movement ? a couple of hours of flying time compared with 17 hours by train between Delhi and Calcutta for instance. Just a reduction of Rs 200 will not offset the time differential, Singh said.

 The fares offered by airlines still remain attractive. Flight costs between Delhi and Calcutta or Mumbai start from about Rs 1,500 and can go up to about Rs 3,500. Fares for Rajdhanis second AC between the capital and Calcutta is about Rs 2,000, while first AC would cost nearly Rs 3,700. 

 The railway budget shows that low-cost airlines are making a huge impact ? the railways are certainly concerned, Singh quipped. Lalu has cut fares for first AC travel by an average of 18 per cent and second AC by 10 per cent. It has also announced that travel between metros will be faster by an hour.

 Air Deccan chief G.R. Gopinath said, Our fares are 10 to 15 per cent higher than those of the railways. But we are not going in for an immediate price restructuring as we feel we remain more competitive because of the time factor. The time factor is too big .... Chennai to Delhi takes days while we take a couple of hours.

 But airline sources said low-cost airlines will consider perking up services, from a totally no-frills airline to something more, mainly on account of the push from normal airlines like Indian Airlines and Jet Airways, which too have been dropping fares even as they maintain service standards. 

 With the railways threatening to improve food and other facilities, it may be time for them to take a call.

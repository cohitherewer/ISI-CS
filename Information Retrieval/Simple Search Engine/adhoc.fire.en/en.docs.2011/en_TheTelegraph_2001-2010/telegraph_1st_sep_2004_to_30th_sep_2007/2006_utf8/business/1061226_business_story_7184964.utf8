 DS Group to diversify

 JAYATI GHOSE

 New Delhi, Dec. 25: The Rs 900-crore Dharampal Satyapal (DS) group is scripting a strategy to focus on the food business. 

 DS Group plans to bring packaged foods under the Catch spice brand, which is popular as table salt and pepper. The Catch branded food products will include papads, pickles, jams, jellies, ketchups and heat-and-eat soups.

 The packaged food category is on a roll, and we want to leverage our strength of high quality and strong distribution network to enhance our brand presence in this sector, said Bhavna Sood, vice-president of DS Group. 

 Not only is the group keen to diversify, but it also wants to consolidate its position in each product segment, said Sood. However, the investment details are yet to be finalised. 

 Catch spice, which currently has a growth rate of 40 per cent, is expected to grow by over 70 per cent with the introduction of its ready-to-eat product category.

 According to the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci), the ready-to-eat segment is estimated at Rs 100 crore and is set to grow at a rate of 70-80 per cent in the next few years.

 The owner of the Catch brand will also launch Catch Colas carbonated cold drinks made from spring water in cola, orange and lemon flavours. 

 The response to the initial test marketing was positive and the company plans to roll out Catch Colas in early 2007. The company also plans to launch ready-to-eat low-calorie snacks, such as roasted channa, soon, said Sood.

 Sood said, The under-25 segment is the major consumer of our brands. Market studies show they are looking for healthier alternatives even in carbonated soft drinks.

 According to industry analysts, beverages will be among the fastest growing segments in the next few years. 

 Of the Rs 6,000-crore beverages segment, non-carbonated drinks, including fruit juices, comprise only about 15 per cent, while sweetened carbonated drinks rule the majority of the market.

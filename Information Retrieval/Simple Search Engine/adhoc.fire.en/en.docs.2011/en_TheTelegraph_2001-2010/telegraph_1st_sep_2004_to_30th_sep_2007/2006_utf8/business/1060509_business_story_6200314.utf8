 Ranbaxy will row

 New Delhi, May 8 (PTI): An out-of-court settlement of the feud over Ranbaxy founder Bhai Mohan Singhs will is seemingly imminent between Analjit Singh and Malvinder, Shivender duo, the present promoters of Ranbaxy and Fortis respectively, with the Analjit camp willing to smoke the peace pipe.

 In my personal capacity, I am trying to go for an out-of-court settlement, counsel for Analjit and executor of the will A.K. Sharma said.

 What we gather is that they (Malvinder and Shivender) are also willing for an out-of-court settlement. But they have not approached us so far, he added.

 Sharma, however, said, We will not make the first move.

 Both Malvinder and Shivender, however, declined to comment.

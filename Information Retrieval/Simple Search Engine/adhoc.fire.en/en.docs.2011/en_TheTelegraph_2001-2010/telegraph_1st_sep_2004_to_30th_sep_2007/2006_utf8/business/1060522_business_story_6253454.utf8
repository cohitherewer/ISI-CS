The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Steel prop for Amethi

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY 

 Jain: On the prowl

 New Delhi, May 21: State-run Steel Authority of India Ltd is likely to take over the jinxed steel plant of Malvika Steel at Jagdishpur, located in the Gandhi family pocket borough ? Amethi. 

 We are in talks with financial institutions who now run the company, SAIL chief V.S. Jain told The Telegraph. 

 The Rs 3,000-crore project was one of the big flop shows in steel in the nineties. Promoters Usha group of Delhi-based Rais raised large sums from the public, while financial institutions were coaxed into taking a sizeable exposure in the project. However, the project was a non-starter, forcing at least one FI ? IFCI ? to go belly-up over the arrears of the promoters. 

 Jain said, SAIL is working on a policy to bring the producer near the market and we feel the plant will help us cater to the north Indian markets, especially the construction market. We will study what is the real worth of the project before making naming the price ? we will certainly not pay what has been sunk into the project.

 The project started off as a unit for 8 lakh tonnes of sponge iron and 1.2 million tonnes of iron pellets, only to be converted into a 6.35 lakh tonne integrated steel plant. After 10 years of abortive attempts, the Rais cited adverse market conditions to down shutters in 1998. Malvika Steel owed IFCI about Rs 1,040 crore and UTI about Rs 256 crore. 

 Interestingly, Kulwant Rai, the Rai family patriarch, was the government nominee on the board of IDBI from 1994 to 2000. 

 More than its no-show, the location of the plant in Amethi has made it an attention grabber, because of the close links of the region with the Gandhi family.

 Jain, however, denied any political motives behind the business proposition.

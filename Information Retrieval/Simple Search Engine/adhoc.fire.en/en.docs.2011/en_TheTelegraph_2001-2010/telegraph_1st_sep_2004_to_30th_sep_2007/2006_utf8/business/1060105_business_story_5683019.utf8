 Tata car price

 Bangalore, Jan. 4 (PTI): The much-awaited Rs 1 lakh car from the Tata stable may not carry that tag as steel prices have gone up, a Tata group official indicated today.

 The Rs 1 lakh car will be on the roads in 2007-08. Prototypes have already been made. Its now a matter of sourcing materials, said J.J. Irani, director of Tata Sons.

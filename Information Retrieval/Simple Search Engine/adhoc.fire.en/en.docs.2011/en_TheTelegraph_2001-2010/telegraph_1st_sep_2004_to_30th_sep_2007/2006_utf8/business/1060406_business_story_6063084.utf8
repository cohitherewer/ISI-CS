 H2O Plus to set up more outlets

 URVASHI KAUL

 New Delhi, April 5: Within a year of its entry in India, Chicago-based high-end cosmetics maker H2O Plus is set to expand its reach.

 Encouraged by the response and queries about H2O products, the $100-million firm will add four exclusive stores and 30 sale points. 

 The expansion plan is expected to cost about Rs 1.6 crore. 

 H2O offers a range of water-based skin care products made from marine ingredients mixed with vitamins and minerals. The marine-based skin care products were launched in India in March, 2005. 

 H2Os skin-care products contribute 60 per cent to its revenues. 

 It also offers spa, bath and body care products, gift sets and accessories. 

 The high-end skin care products are targeted for women in the age group of 25-39 years. 

 Its products are priced between Rs 490 and Rs 6,000 with the average price of a H2O Plus item being Rs 1,200. 

 Currently, the brand has four stores and 15 counters in India. 

 By the end of this year, we are looking at a total of 38 points for sale, said Garima Makkar, brand manager, H2O Plus. 

 The company plans to add three stores in Delhi and one in Mumbai. At present, it has two stores in Delhi and one each in Mumbai and Chandigarh. 

 We had a good 25 per cent growth in 2005-06, which was far beyond our expectation, Makkar said. 

 The company is also talking to leading retailers in India for selling H2O products through their chains.

 Sports Station (India) Pvt Ltd is H2Os domestic distributor and retailer.

 Still on: Sick PSU selloff

 New Delhi, July 9: The storm raging over the Prime Ministers fiat against disinvestment has not deterred government officials from working on a recommendation of the Planning Commission to sell sick PSUs through negative bidding. This means that a company seeking to buy a sick firm should also bid for the amount of debt it will take over.

 A note of the commission ? Agenda for economic policy and institutional reform ? circulated to policy makers tells the Centre to auction all PSUs that cannot be revived.

 In the UPAs Common Minimum Programme, it was decided to shut down or sell moribund PSUs.

 The Board for Reconstruction of Public Sector Enterprises (BRPSE), under P.K. Basu, is reviewing sick PSUs and recommending revival package, shutdown or selloff.

 The sales of these sick PSUs are in limbo after Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs directive. Officials said they would continue their work but would implement the plans only after divestment is revived.

 The government and the BRPSE decide on a sick PSU after evaluating its cash flow, profitability, growth rate and earning power as well as its capability to implement a turnaround strategy. The government would no longer extend any sovereign guarantees for loans taken for revival.

 According to the new policy, the strategy for those companies with zero net worth is negative bidding through debt write offs.

 Till now, the government wrote off debts before sell- off. The interest burden as well as the principal amount along with penalties and taxes were borne by the government.

 Since such costs were at times higher than the amount earned by the government, planners feel a negative bidding will prove less expensive. Officials said after the confusion over such sales or shut downs is resolved, the government could also consider a strategy of bringing in private partners to revive sick PSUs instead of merely preparing revival packages.

 The allies (of UPA) may oppose this solution but there are PSUs which cannot be revived by the government alone. Some require fresh technological or financial expertise which only certain private firms can bring in, they said.

 If the government decides to rope in a private partner, it would have two options: either induct a minority partner, which will provide technical or financial expertise but not have management control, or a majority partner with management control if the firms revival is a risky proposition.

 The decision to induct a private partner would depend on the need for technical, managerial and commercial expertise, officials said.

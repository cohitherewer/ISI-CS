 PNC Financial to buy Mercantile 

 New York, Oct. 9 (Reuters): PNC Financial Services Group Inc said on Monday it had agreed to buy Mercantile Bankshares Corp in a cash and stock deal worth about $6 billion.

 The proposed price of $47.24 a share represents a 28 per cent premium to Mercantiles closing stock price on Friday.

 PNC said it expected the transaction to add to earnings in 2008 and estimated the internal rate of return at about 15 per cent.

 The US regional banks have been consolidating in recent years to spread their costs across more customers.

 Mercantile Bankshares, whose shares closed at $36.78 on Friday, is a Baltimore-based banking company with 240 offices in northern Virginia counties and Maryland.

 Pittsburgh-based PNC has agreed to pay about 52.5 million shares of common stock and $2.13 billion in cash. The agreement calls for the exchange of 0.4184 PNC shares and $16.45 in cash for each share of Mercantile.

 Two Mercantile directors will join the board of the combined company. Mercantile chief executive Edward Kelly will be appointed a PNC vice chairman upon close of the transaction.

 New oil hunt round to get off the block

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 4: The petroleum ministry has completed the spadework for the sixth round of oil hunt under the new exploration licensing policy (Nelp VI) this year.

 A senior petroleum ministry official said all the clearances required from the environment, defence and external affairs ministries have already been obtained. This will make it easier for oil companies to begin operations.

 In the earlier rounds, some oil companies had to obtain these clearances after they had signed the contracts for the blocks and there were some complaints in this regard.

 Around 40 blocks are likely to be offered in this round compared with the 20 for which contracts were signed under Nelp V. These blocks will cover both offshore and onshore areas.

 The sixth round will be carried out on the same lines as the fifth with roadshows to woo prospective overseas investors. 

 The petroleum ministry is banking on the KG basin finds to lure bigger foreign oil companies this time.

 Earlier, only smaller foreign companies such as Cairn Energy of the UK and Niko Resources of Canada had taken up oil and gas exploration blocks in the country.

 However, with British Gas recently joining hands with the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation in some blocks in the KG basin, other global oil and gas companies could follow suit, a senior official said. 

 The government is keen to jack up domestic oil and gas production through more FDI and better technology in this sector to reduce dependence on imports.

 Indias oil imports have risen to 76 per cent and are expected to reach 80-85 per cent in a few years. Despite new gas discoveries in the country, which are expected to be available by 2008, the shortfall may continue to be 50 per cent.

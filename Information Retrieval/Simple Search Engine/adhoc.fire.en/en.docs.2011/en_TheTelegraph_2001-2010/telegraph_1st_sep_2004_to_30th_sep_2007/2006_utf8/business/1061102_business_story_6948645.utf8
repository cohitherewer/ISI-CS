 Rs 100-cr Lodha salvo at BK Birla

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Calcutta, Nov. 1: The alleged below-the-belt campaign against Rajendra Singh Lodha by the Birlas has landed the group patriarch Basant Kumar Birla in a legal soup.

 Lodha today slapped a petition in Calcutta High Court, seeking a damage of Rs 100 crore from B.K. Birla and a few others.

 Justice Aniruddha Bose, who heard the case, directed the warring groups to file their affidavits by November 15 and fixed the date for hearing of the petition on November 27, with high priority.

 The case pertains to various publications that the Birlas are said to have issued since July 2005.

 These include a number of letters, articles and emails circulated by the Birlas to their friends, business associates and city-based industrialists.

 Along with B.K. Birla, Navin Suchanti, director of Pressman Advertising amp; Marketing Ltd, and Sarvadaman Ray, general secretary of Centre for Social Equity (CSE), an NGO, have been named in the Lodha suit. 

 Moreover, the two organisations, Pressman and CSE, have also been named in the suit.

 I had earlier said that my client will initiate civil and criminal proceedings against people who are engaging in such slander campaigns. This is the first of the actions my client has taken today, Debanjan Mondal of Fox and Mondal, solicitor for Lodha, said.

 The suit has been filed to restrain the respondents from publishing such defamatory statements, Mondal added.

 When contacted, the Birlas denied having any hand in the publications. 

 Reacting to the suit filed by the Lodhas, they said: It is not of any importance to us. We are not afraid of such cases.

 The petition specifically mentions about a special feature article that appeared in the Calcutta edition of a business daily on August 24, 2005. It did not mention the name of the author.

 Subsequently, the paper issued a clarification and then tendered an apology.

 Later the newspaper told Lodhas advocate that the said publication was carried as an advertisement in good faith as it was received through Pressman. 

 It also disclosed that the advertisement was issued at the instruction of Pressman and on behalf of Sarvadaman Ray, the general secretary of CSE.

 Sources close to the Lodhas claimed Ray was also the president of Vidula Consultancy Services, a BK Birla Group company.

 Todays case marks a new turn in the acrimonious battle over the control of the Rs 5,000-crore MP Birla empire.

 The Birlas and the Lodhas have filed many cases, both civil and criminal, since July 2004 when the 1999 will of the late Priyamvada Birla was made public.

 New Delhi, Jan. 5: The empowered group of ministers today fixed Rs 620 per share as the floor price for selling the government?s 8 per cent residual stake in Maruti Udyog Ltd. 

 The last date for submission of bids is January 11, which will be opened a day later. The sale, open only to PSU financial institutions (FIs) and expected to fetch the government around Rs 1,432 crore, has drawn 36 contenders.

 Senior officials said, ?All eligible public sector banks and insurance companies, besides the likes of Exim Bank and Sidbi, have submitted the expression of interest ? official jargon used to describe an intention to buy.

 Though the floor price has been kept at a substantial discount to the going rate of shares, which were quoted at Rs 672.30 on Dalal Street today, the Centre expects a large number of potential buyers and a good price. 

 FIs buying the stake will get a strong foothold in the country?s largest carmaker at a time when the auto industry is gearing up for a big leap in sales.

 ?If the institutions had tried to acquire such a large number of shares from the open market, it would have pushed up the price of the stock substantially,? an official said.

 However, the government has reserved the right not to sell the entire 8 per cent slice of equity in Maruti if it ?does not approve? the would-be buyers. This could happen even if their bids are above the floor price.

 The shares have a lock-in period of six months and the minimum bid size has been kept at Rs 10 crore. In all, 23,112,804 shares are on the block. Once sold, the Centre?s stake in the company will come down to 10.24 per cent.

 The price-earning (P/E) ratio of the Maruti stock now is 19.4, based on the current market price of around Rs 672. 

 While a single institution can bid for the entire chunk, its total holding should not exceed 10 per cent of the equity.

 The government has opted for the ?French auction?, under which the highest bidder gets the entire lot it has sought; it is followed by the second-highest and the third-highest bidder.

 SBI Capital Markets and Kotak Mahindra Capital are advising the Centre on the transaction. 

 Proceeds from the sale will go into the national investment fund, 75 per cent of whose kitty is used for social sector projects and 25 per cent for wobbly public sector companies.

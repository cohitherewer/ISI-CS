 New Delhi, April 5: Commerce minister Kamal Nath told WTO director-general Pascal Lamy here today that India would not rush into an agreement and compromise its interests merely to meet the deadlines set for the multilateral trade negotiations. 

 What if the timelines are not met? is the first question that Nath is reported to have fired at Lamy.

 Well, that would pose a problem, Lamy is reported to have shot back. 

 The commerce minister made it clear at the two-hour meeting that while timelines or deadlines are important, this cannot be at the cost of the development content of the Doha round, which was launched with the aim of reducing global trade imbalances so that developing countries could benefit.

 Nath and Lamy discussed issues relating to agriculture and non-agricultural market access that have to be settled by the April 30, 2006 deadline mandated in the Doha and Hong Kong declarations.

 After the meeting, Nath said the massive agriculture subsidies in developed countries ensured Indian farmers are kept out of the global trading system by putting them at a disadvantage vis-?-vis costs.

 I have highlighted that agriculture in India is not a commercial activity, but a way of life and no deal that leads to its displacement was acceptable, the minister said.

 Nath said any tariff reduction commitment must take these sensitivities on board and that is why developing countries under the aegis of G-20 had proposed special products and special safeguard mechanisms. Pointing that India had medium, small and infant industries, he said developed countries had taken many years to nurture their industries and developing countries should be allowed to do the same.

 Lamy told journalists there is a general council meeting on April 18 in Geneva and if there is forward movement, a ministerial meeting could follow. 

 He said, We are approaching the moment of truth in the next few days. Developed countries like the EU and US will have to reduce subsidies in agriculture. Their agriculture tariffs should also come down, but developing countries like India, Brazil and South Africa will have to reduce their industrial tariffs.

 This round is the development round and trade needs to be rebalanced in favour of developing countries, Lamy said.

 He said India had a lot more to gain than it has to concede and there was a need to weigh options in offensive and defensive areas.

 India will have to make its contribution on tariff reduction and the Hong Kong agreement provided enough policy space in this regard.

 Indicating that there had been progress after the Hong Kong ministerial agreement, Lamy said technical negotiations had widened and there was a possibility of a deal by April 30.

 Lamy is also meeting Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, finance minister P. Chidambaram and BJP leader Murli Manohar Joshi.

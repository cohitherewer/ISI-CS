 Saint-Gobain to step up investments

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Sriperumbudur, Feb. 17: Saint-Gobain, the global leader in glass production, will substantially step up its investments in India in the next five years, chairman and CEO Jean Louis Beffa said. 

 The companys second float glass plant with a capacity is 800 tonnes per day and built at a cost of Rs 800 crore in the SIPCOT industrial park was inaugurated by Tamil Nadu chief minister J. Jayalalithaa here today.

 Saint-Gobains first float glass plant was started in 2000 with a capacity to manufacture 650 tonnes of glass per day.

 The Fortune 500 company headquartered in Paris is bullish over Indias projected economic growth rate of 8 per cent. We will place India as a priority zone for our Asian investments, Beffa told a news conference. Saint-Gobain is poised to become a 40-billion-euro group in 2006.

 Saint-Global Glasss president Jacques Aschenbroich and Anand Y. Mahajan, chairman of its India arm, Saint-Gobain Glass India, were also present at the inauguration.

 The complex in Sriperumbudur is one of Saint-Gobains biggest and the new unit has the integrated facility for making architecture and automotive glass.

 The Indian automobile sector was also growing by leaps and bounds with players like Hyundai putting up a plant in the vicinity, Beffa said. This will be an asset for us both in the domestic and international markets.

 He said Saint-Gobain had recently acquired India Gypsum and BPB plc, manufacturers of plaster boards. With these acquisitions, the company will be able to synergise float glass with construction products, higher performance materials and specialised products like solar control glasses.

 Apart from Saint-Gobains two units in Pune, the company has set up an engineering unit in Bangalore to build equipment for its operations worldwide as well as its basic mills in France, Beffa said.

 At its World Glass Complex here spread over 177 acres, Saint-Gobain has invested more than Rs 1,400 crore, said B. Santhanam, president of the companys South Asia glass operations. 

 The new plant will be the hub for Saint-Gobains glass exports with 50 per cent of the produce exported to South Korea, Australia, New Zealand and West Asia, Santhanam added.

 Jayalalithaa said although the company was exploring sights in the northern and western parts of the country as the major domestic markets for glass are there, her government was successful to convince Saint-Gobain to set up its expansion project in Sriperumbudur.

 The company has invested Rs 30 crore to make the glass complex environment-friendly, besides setting up a rain water harvesting mini reservoir at an investment of Rs 5 crore, she said.

 Stating that a recent survey by fDi magazine of the Financial Times Group had ranked Tamil Nadu first for its potential to attract foreign direct investments, Jayalalithaa said her vision was to take the state to the league of fast developing regions like Brazil, Ireland and Malaysia.

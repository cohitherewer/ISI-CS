 UTI eyes infotech firm

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Nov. 4: UTI Asset Management Company, the largest mutual fund in the country which manages assets over Rs 30,000 crore, will acquire an information technology firm to reduce the number of its registrar and transfer agents to one from three at present. The firm will also provide business process outsourcing (BPO) services for accounting to global fund houses and financial institutions. 

 We have shortlisted a few companies and negotiations are on, said U.K. Sinha, chairman and managing director of UTI Asset Management Company Pvt Ltd. He, however, declined to reveal details of the target companies. Our plan is to reduce the number of registrar and transfer agents to one in the near future. Recently, we have reduced our R amp;Ts to three from four, he added.

 Besides, we are also planning to provide BPO services to financial institutions, including global fund houses, which are planning to outsource their accounting services. We are publishing the net asset value data for 150 schemes on a daily basis. We have a good foreign presence too. With the required infrastructure and expertise in place, we would like to provide BPO services for accounting, Sinha said. 

 The fund house will soon sign an agreement with Indian Farmers Fertiliser Cooperative Ltd (IFFCO) and a cooperative bank in Maharashtra for micro pension scheme for their employees. The IFFCO deal is likely to be signed next month. Under this agreement, UTI will provide a micro pension scheme to 40,000-50,000 employees of the fertiliser company in Punjab and Karnataka to start with. We will also sign a similar arrangement with a mid-sized cooperative bank in Maharashtra, Sinha said. He, however, declined to name the bank. 

 UTI has already sold micro pension schemes to 25,000 members of SEWA, a self-help group based in south India and 40,000 members of COMPFED, a cooperative of milk producers in Bihar. The mutual fund has also recently entered into a pact with Bank of India for providing micro pension schemes to the banks SHG customers.

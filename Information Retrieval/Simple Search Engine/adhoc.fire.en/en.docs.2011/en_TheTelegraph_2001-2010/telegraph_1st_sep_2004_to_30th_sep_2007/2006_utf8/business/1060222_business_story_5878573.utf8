 New Delhi, Feb. 21: Titan Industries today launched Xylys, a Swiss-made wristwatch brand for the premium segment, priced between Rs 10,000 and Rs 33,000.

 It has unveiled 61 variants of the Xylys brand, which will compete with international brands like Tissot and Rado. 

 The company is also talking to two foreign fashion watch-brands for distribution in India.

 Talks are on with two luxury watch brands from abroad, but we will be able to name them only after April, said Bijou Kurien of Titan Industries.

 The distribution tie-up with the foreign brands will be in line with the arrangement Titan has with Tommy Hilfiger watches. It could be a marketing or licensing arrangement, he said.

 At present, the total size of the watch industry in the country is pegged at Rs 2,000 crore. Of this, the market for premium watches is about Rs 250 crore.

 With the new brand, we aim to capture about 15 per cent of the premium watch market, Kurien said.

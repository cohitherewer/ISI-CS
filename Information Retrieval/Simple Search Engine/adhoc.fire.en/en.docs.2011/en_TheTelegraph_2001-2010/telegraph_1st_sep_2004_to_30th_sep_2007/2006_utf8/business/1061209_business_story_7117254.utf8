 Ray of hope for IPO-unlucky

 Chidambaram: Good news

 New Delhi, Dec. 8: Finance minister P. Chidambaram today said scamsters who had cornered shares in the IPO racket that raged between 2003 and 2005 would be dislodged and fresh shares would be allotted to deserving applicants. He, however, didnt spell out the mechanism that would be adopted to identify the new beneficiaries.

 Irregularities have taken place and we have detected the beneficiaries (of the scam). We have caught them and punished them, Chidambaram informed the Lok Sabha.

 A system has been put in place to detect such irregularities in future so that no one could make multiple applications during any IPO, Chidambaram said. It has now been made mandatory to quote permanent account number (PAN) to make fresh application.

 Investigations carried out by market regulator Sebi had revealed that the IPO scam began with the Maruti Udyog flotation in June 2003. The scamsters had opened fictitious demat accounts and made multiple applications to boost their share allotment prospects. Since the number of fictitious demat accounts in the Maruti issue was small less than 500 the issue was not covered in the sweep of the first interim Sebi order in April this year.

 The scam supposedly ended with the Suzlon Energy IPO in September 2005. The number of fictitious demat accounts involved in this issue was 21,692. 

 There were 105 IPOs in the period between 2003 and 2005 but Sebi had focused on 21 IPOs where 23 demat account holders received off-market credit of shares from 500 or more dematerialised account-holders. Basically, shares that were cornered by small players were eventually transferred to the accounts held by big scamsters.

 Just over three weeks ago, Sebi came out with its second interim report which ordered two depositories National Securities Depository and Central Depository Services and eight depository participants (DPs) to pay a disgorgement amount of around Rs 116 crore. 

 The government appears to be determined to carry the redressal process further by talking about issuing fresh shares to the deserving applicants. At this stage, it is difficult to say how many scam-hit issues will be covered.

 Sebi chairman M Damodaran had also spoken of compensating legitimate applicants who were cheated out of their allotments by scamsters.

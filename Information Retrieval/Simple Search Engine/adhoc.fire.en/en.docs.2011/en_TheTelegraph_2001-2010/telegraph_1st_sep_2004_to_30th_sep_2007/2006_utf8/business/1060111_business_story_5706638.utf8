 VW keeps road to India open

 Pischetsrieder: Its on

 Mumbai/Detroit, Jan. 10: Volkswagen AG, the leading German carmaker, will decide within the next year whether to go ahead with plans for a new large assembly plant in India.

 In an interview at the North American International Auto Show, Bernd Pischetsrieder, chairman of the board of management of Volkswagen AG, said India was an important market for Volkswagen.

 Pischetsrieders statement is the first clear comment from a top Volkswagen executive indicating that the German carmaker is still seriously considering plans to enter India. 

 If Volkswagen were to build a new plant it would be full-size with the capacity to make anywhere from 2,50,000 to 3,00,000 units per year at full production, Pischetsrieder said.

 Last June, Volkswagens plans to establish an assembly plant to make utility vehicles at Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh almost evaporated in a blaze of controversy after a top Volkswagen executive behind the project was embroiled in a corruption scandal.

 Helmut Schuster was forced to resign after enquiries revealed that he had forced the Andhra Pradesh government to pay Rs 27 crore into an escrow account held Vashishta Wahan, a special purpose vehicle that he had floated. The suspicion was that this a bribe to get VW to establish its plant in the state.

 Talks between the Andhra government and the VW authorities in Wolfsburg, the carmakers headquarters in Germany, have continued since. In November, a four-member team from VW checked out another 500-acre site in Andhras Nellore district.

 VW is represented in India by its Czech-based subsidiary Skoda which has a plant in Aurangabad that was built five years ago. Oddly enough, Skoda was also embroiled in controversy with its managing director Imram Hassen replaced suddenly in the last week of December by Lucas Folc, the chief of finance.

 When the announcement was made, it was suggested that Hassens contract had ended and he was returning to Europe. Yesterday, however, Skoda Auto said it had fired the head of its India operations. Dirk Grosse-Leege, Volkswagens communications chief, said Imran Hassen was dismissed because of differences over management issues. He refused to say more.

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Jan. 31: Mahindra amp; Mahindra today beat market expectations by announcing a 75 per cent jump in earnings for the third quarter ended December 31. The automobile behemoth posted a net profit of Rs 233.50 crore for the reporting quarter against Rs 133.2 crore in the previous corresponding period. 

 The gross sales and income from operations for the October-December quarter this fiscal stood 23 per cent higher at Rs 2496.8 crore vis-?-vis Rs 2022.3 crore achieved in the same period last year. 

 The net sales went up by 25 per cent to Rs 2207.2 crore for the three-month period from Rs 1772.3 crore a year ago. 

 The company recorded a 25 per cent growth in its net sales for the nine months ended December 2005, too. Its net sales on December 31 stood at Rs 5933.8 crore against Rs 4749.9 crore on December 31, 2004. Profit before tax was Rs 648.5 crore against Rs 500.8 crore a year earlier. 

 According to the company, the improvement in earnings was due to strong performance in its two major business divisions ? utility vehicles and light commercial vehicles. 

 M amp;M sold 29,594 utility vehicles during the October-December period this fiscal compared with 28,497 vehicles in the corresponding quarter last year. The sales growth was driven by a strong demand for the Scorpio CRDe and the new Bolero variants, the company said in a statement. 

 In the LCV (with load carrying capacity up to 4 mt) segment, vehicle sales declined 7 per cent to 1,541 units. Its exports, however, grew to 1,432 vehicles during the quarter from 819 vehicles in the previous corresponding quarter. Encouraged by the buoyed performance, M amp;M projected a robust outlook for the current quarter.

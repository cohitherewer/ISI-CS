 SBI raises deposit rates

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Dec. 8: State Bank of India (SBI), the countrys largest bank, today raised interest rates on domestic term deposits by 25 to 75 basis points in a move that could compel other commercial banks to revise their deposit rates as well.

 The across-the-board hike came as a surprise since its chairman .P. Bhatt had indicated on Friday that interest rates were likely to remain stable in the short term.

 Banking analysts say that SBIs move to raise deposit rates is a result of the sharp gap that banks face in their advances and deposit growth. While commercial banks have seen lending rise by more than 30 per cent, deposit growth has been only at over 18 per cent. In such circumstances, a hike in deposit rates can draw resources into the banking system to feed the demand for loans.

 SBI last raised deposit rates on August 18. The margin of the latest revision is higher in the case of deposits with longer tenures. The bank revealed that deposits between 7 days to 14 days would now yield an interest rate of 3.75 per cent against 3.50 per cent earlier. Similarly, interest rates on deposits between 15 days to 45 days will now command an interest rate of 5 per cent from the earlier 4.75 per cent.

 Deposits with a duration of 46 days to 179 days will now earn interest at 5.50 per cent from 5.25 per cent earlier. Deposits between 180 days to less than 1 year will command an interest rate of 6.50 per cent from December 11 from 6.25 per cent earlier.

 However, there has been a much sharper rate rise in the case of deposits of over a year. Even as interest rate on deposits of 1 year to less than 3 years will yield 7.50 per cent (6.75 per cent), that between 3 years to less than 5 years will have an interest rate of 7.75 per cent (7 per cent earlier) and deposits having maturity of 5 years and above will bear an interest of 8 per cent (7.25 per cent).

 Observers who track SBI aver that with this hike, SBI now has one of the best interest rate structures among commercial banks. For instance, Bank of Baroda (BoB) offers 7.25 per cent for deposits of over a year and 7.50 per cent for deposits of over 5 years while ICICI Bank gives an interest rate of 7 per cent on deposits of over 5 years.

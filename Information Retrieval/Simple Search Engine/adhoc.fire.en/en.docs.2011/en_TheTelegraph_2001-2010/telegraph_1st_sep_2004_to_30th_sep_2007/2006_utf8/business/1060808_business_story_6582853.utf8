 Calcutta, Aug. 7: The state government will set up a tourism infrastructure and investment board for the first time in the country. 

 The board would be instrumental in steering investments towards projects and also consider various infrastructure issues related to tourism, state tourism minister Manab Mukherjee said at an interactive session organised by the Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

 The tourism ministry will appoint a public relations consultancy for media affairs. 

 It is in the final stages of appointing an international consultant, who would help the board draw up a tourism policy and formulate strategies to attract investments. The minister said 25 to 30 projects have already been identified for future development, including Buddhist tourism.

 Mukherjee will also meet the tourism industry officials in Jalpaiguri to discuss the areas tourism potential. He will meet the tea estate owners separately in Siliguri at the end of the month.

 It took close to eight years for the tea garden owners to get involved in tourism projects. But the ministry expects more participation from their side, Mukherjee said.

 The state government had developed two estates under the West Bengal Tea Development Corporation Ltd for tea tourism on a pilot basis.

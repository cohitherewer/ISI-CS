 US says tit-for-tat, tough time for domestic exports

 S.P.S.PANNU

 New Delhi, Aug. 8: Indian 

 exports could be badly roiled as the United States has decided 

 to review the duty-free benefit that it extends to a range 

 of goods imported under the generalised system of preferences 

 (GSP) .

 The US action is aimed at India and Brazil and appears to have been triggered by the tough stand they adopted at the failed trade talks in Geneva.

 US Trade Representative Susan Schwab has said, One of the concerns that Congress has raised is that GSP benefits go largely to a few countries while many developing countries are not trading much under the programme.

 The review I am announcing today, the first in 20 years, will help make certain that we are administering the programme consistent with statutory criteria, Schwab said.

 India is one of the biggest beneficiaries of the programme and officials are concerned about its impact on Indian exports.

 However, commerce and industry minister Kamal Nath said he could not comment on the possible loss of GSP benefits until the full details were made available to him.

 The US is Indias largest trading partner accounting for over 20 per cent of its exports. Goods such as gems and jewellery, which form some the key exports, are covered under GSP. 

 The United States imported $26.7 billion worth of goods under the GSP programme in 2005. The 32-year-old programme waives import duties on thousands of products from 133 developing countries and expires at the end of the year unless renewed by Congress.

 With many key lawmakers opposed to the renewal, the Bush administration will review whether to limit, suspend or withdraw the eligibility of 13 countries, including India and Brazil, that shipped more than $100 million worth of goods to the United States under the programme in 2005 or accounted for more than 0.25 per cent world goods exports, Schwab said in the statement.

 The other targeted countries include Argentina, Croatia, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, the Philippines, Romania, Russia, South Africa, Thailand, Turkey and Venezuela.

 The Bush administration will also consider whether to withdraw presidential waivers that give those 13 countries and six others unlimited duty-free access for certain products.

 Kamal Nath has set an export target of $126 billion for the current financial year in order to double the countrys merchandise exports in three years from a level of $63 billion in 2003-04. The US decision on GSP could make the achievement of this target that much more difficult.

 The multilateral trade talks had collapsed with the US refusing to budge on the issue of slashing farm subsidies and the developing countries, represented by India and Brazil, standing firm on not throwing open their markets to the influx of cheap western goods.

 Even EU trade commissioner Peter Mandelson blamed the US for the breakdown in the multilateral trade talks. 

 He had said, The US was unwilling to accept or indeed acknowledge, the flexibility being shown by others in the room and, as a result, felt unable to show any flexibility on the issue of farm subsidies.

 Schwab, however, claimed the United States remains committed to a robust, ambitious and a balanced round; unfortunately our trading partners were more interested in the loopholes than in market access.

 BoB to pay fine for flouting act

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, May 30: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has slapped a Rs 5-lakh fine on the Bank of Baroda (BoB) for violating provisions of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 by failing to include liabilities or the deposits of its overseas branches in its calculation of net demand and time liabilities (NDTL).

 A banks cash reserve ratio (CRR) or statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) is obtained from its NDTL that comprises demand and time deposits. With external liabilities left out of the NDTL, the incidence of the CRR and SLR on the bank was lower than required, sources said.

 The RBI said when it inspected the books of BoB it found that the bank had netted (subtracted) the items representing internal and external liabilities in the inter-office (inter-branch) accounts, resulting in under-estimation of the outside liabilities for computation of NDTL and maintenance of CRR/SLR.

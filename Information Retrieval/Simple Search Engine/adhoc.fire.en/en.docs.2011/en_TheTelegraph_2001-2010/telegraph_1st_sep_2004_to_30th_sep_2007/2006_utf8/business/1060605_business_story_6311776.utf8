 Price humility lesson for market debutantes

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, June 4: The stock markets have cratered in the past three weeks: and the first pock marks are beginning to show up in the primary market segment ? the rub-off effect is going to force new issuers of stocks to pause and reconsider their strategies.

 The savage meltdown in the secondary markets over the past three weeks has forced two companies ? Deccan Aviation and Prime Focus ? entering the capital market for the first time to extend the closing dates for their issues and pare the price band.

 There?s a clear message that is now going out to the new issuers of capital: get real, you can?t hope to demand astronomical prices for your shares and expect the issues to be oversubscribed.

 It?s happened in the US as well where the Nasdaq slumped by over 6 per cent last month; three companies there had to lower the price range of their initial public offering (IPOs) because of weak market conditions.

 While the behaviour of broader markets here can be attributed to the apathy of the investor class towards IPOs, there are several pointers for those planning to raise funds through new issues or even a follow-on offering.

 The key issue is pricing. Merchant bankers say to understand this, one must go back to last month when four issues opened for subscription: Deccan Aviation, Unity Infraprojects, Rathi Udyog and Gangotri Textiles. The Deccan Aviation issue was just about oversubscribed while Unity Infraprojects was over-subscribed by two times. The other two issues barely managed to sail through.

 Although these four offerings came at a time when the secondary equity markets were collapsing, merchant bankers associated with the issues admit that the response would have been better had their pricing been more realistic in line with the market conditions.

 ?These issues were filed for approval with the market regulator at a time when the stock markets were going great guns. But the problem arose as their issues opened for subscription at a time when the benchmark index was struggling even at 10,500. Unfortunately, their pricing gave the impression that the BSE sensex was at over 12,000. Therefore, there were fewer takers,? says a merchant banker.

 Conceding that his firm had started asking prospective issuers to be more conservative in pricing if they wanted to offer new shares at this juncture, the official said the tepid interest in new issues had been brought on by the shake down of stock market values on the bourses.

 An analysis of the bidding pattern for these IPOs reveals that mutual funds, banks and financial institutions have suddenly gone coy on new issues. The foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have continued to bid for these IPOs but less aggressively than before.

 ?Mutual funds and institutions are just like other investors. Why should they bid for a share when the markets are caught in a massive correction? The funds can always pick up these issues later in the secondary market,? says a spokesperson from one such fund.

 The official may have a point as recent studies have shown that many new issues and follow-on offerings have been badly mauled after they have been listed. 

 In several cases, the stocks are quoting below the issue price. Given such a past, analysts are advising retail investors to be extremely choosy while investing in a new issue.

 ?Though the quality of issues have vastly improved than that was seen in the early 1990s, investors should only buy new shares in well-recognised companies. As for other offerings, it would be prudent for them to buy after these shares are listed and more information is available,? says an official who handles portfolio management service for a leading brokerage.

 The new issue market is agog over the flotation by DLF Universal Ltd, which is being touted as the largest capital issue in the country. Last month, the company filed the draft red herring prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) to raise an estimated Rs 13,600 crore. 

 DLF plans to enter the markets with an issue of 20.2 crore shares at a premium to be decided through the book-building process. Although the company has said the issue is on track, the buzz is that the price is not likely to be as high as Rs 700 on the top end of the band.

 But amid all these developments, there is still a silver lining for investors and issuers. Prithvi Haldea, managing director of Prime Database, reckons the biggest positive factor in the new issue market is that despite the mayhem in the secondary market, none of the IPOs devolved on merchant bankers. 

 A new issue is required to raise at least 90 per cent of the funds it sets out to raise, and any shortfall has to be met by merchant bankers. Haldea says this underlines the fact that the market for new issues is still robust.

 One big plus for all investors in new issues is that the chances of being allotted shares have brightened for everyone.

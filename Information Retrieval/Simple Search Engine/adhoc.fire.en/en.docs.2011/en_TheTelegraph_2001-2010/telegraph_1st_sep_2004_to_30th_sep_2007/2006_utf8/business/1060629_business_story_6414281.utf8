 London, June 28: Is time running out for the world?s most powerful traders to wrap up their current round of global commerce talks? 

 On the eve of the crucial WTO mini-ministerial meeting in Geneva, commerce minister Kamal Nath made it clear to the US, European Union and other developed countries that interests of Indian farmers were not negotiable issues. 

 Nath, who was the first to downplay hopes ahead of Hong Kong talks, accused the US and the EU of creating a ?suicide round?.

 Nath, on the way to Geneva, told The Telegraph, ?There is a growing disquiet that the contours of the development dimension of this round are not yet apparent. What does development mean? Surely it cannot mean disturbing farmers? livelihood and de-industrialisation of developing economies,? he said. 

 Nath has written a letter to all WTO trade ministers that the Geneva round should address the issue of farmers ?frontally and substantially?. He said member countries must recognise the stark reality that the situations of developed and developing countries differ on crucial aspects of trade liberalisation involving commercial issues. 

 ?For developing countries, such sensitivities involve the survival and well being of their poorest citizens, the bulk of whom depend on agriculture for their livelihoods. Therefore, I insist again that as far as we are concerned, livelihood security and subsistence of the poor are non-negotiable issues,? he said. 

 Nath was in London to address the India-UK business leaders forum jointly organised by the Commonwealth Business Council and the Confederation of Indian Industry.

 In his letter to WTO trade ministers, Nath said in agriculture India had all along been pressing for very substantial reductions in trade distorting subsidies that the developed countries have been providing to their agriculture sectors. 

 Referring to industrial tariffs, Nath said developing countries should not be prevented from developing their infant industrial sectors. 

 ?An over-ambitious programme of tariff liberalisation can permanently foreclose the possibility of industrial development in many developing countries ? and in some cases, actually leading to de-industrialisation,? he said and added ?that is unacceptable for us.?

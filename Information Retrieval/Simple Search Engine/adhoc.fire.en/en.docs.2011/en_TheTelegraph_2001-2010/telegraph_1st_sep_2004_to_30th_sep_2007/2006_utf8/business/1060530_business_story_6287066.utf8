 Hind Lever investors okay buyback plan

 Manwani: In control

 Mumbai, May 29: The shareholders of Hindustan Lever Limited (HLL) have approved a share buyback proposal.

 However, it has been passed as a special resolution that authorises the board to buy back the companys shares. No decision was taken on buyback details like the time period of the offer.

 The developing and emerging market contributes over 60 per cent of the growth of Unilever and has double the growth rate than the developed markets, HLL chairman Harish Manwani said at the companys annual general meeting.

 By 2010, consumer spending in these markets will overtake that in developed countries and India will be at the forefront with its continued high GDP growth, Manwani said.

 Estimates suggest that an additional 1.2 billion consumers across the world will buy packaged goods for the first time by 2010 and the bulk of these consumers will be from India and China.

 India is the major contributor in the developing and emerging markets, which has the highest priority in Unilevers total operations, followed by China, Indonesia and Thailand. We will further strengthen HLLs position, he added. 

 Keeping that in mind, we recognise the huge potential which exists in the food processing segment. Unilever has a huge branded foods portfolio and we would also like to expand the portfolio in India, said Manwani.

 HLL plans to introduce Pureit, its water purifier solution in a phased manner across the country.

 We have been test marketing the product in Tamil Nadu and have been studying the business model, including the service infrastructure, which it would require, said Douglas Baillie, chief executive officer and managing director, HLL.

 In India, an estimated 700 million consumers use HLL brands every day and nine of our brands are among the top 20 most recognised brands in the country, said Manwani.

 Tata plays loyalty card in plastic plunge

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Feb. 15: The Tata group today teamed up with SBI Card and MasterCard International to launch a credit cum coalition loyalty card ? The Tata Credit Card.

 The card will be available in three categories ? Privilege, Premiers and Leader.

 While the Tata Group has set a target of having 2 million customers in five years, its edge is the loyalty programme that is being offered. 

 Bombay House, the headquarters of the Tata group, is confident about the success of its new line of business as it has a strong value proposition for the customer. 

 The credit card offers customers the chance to earn and redeem points across multiple categories. As a result, the customer is not limited to redeem his points at one store or through a redemption brochure but can actually shop with any participating brand and redeem points instantly.

 For every Rs 100 spent, a customer can earn up to six Tata Reward points from partner brands and 1 point when they shop anywhere else using the credit card. To begin with, customers can use the credit cards and avail benefits from Tata group companies that include Tata Motors, Voltas, Tata AIG, Westside, Star India Bazaar, Landmark Bookstores, Taj Hotels, Titan and Tata Indicom among others. The other partnerships include that with Indian Airlines, Air-India, Jet Airways and Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd.

 Initially the card will be available in Delhi, Mumbai, Calcutta, Jamshedpur, Bangalore and Hyderabad. By May, it will be available to customers in all major cities of the country.

 SBI Card is a joint venture between State Bank of India and GE Capital. It will provide administrative and other support such as call centre processing for the Tata group.

 The Tata Credit Card was today launched by Tata Sons chairman Ratan Tata and A K Purwar, chairman, State Bank of India (SBI).

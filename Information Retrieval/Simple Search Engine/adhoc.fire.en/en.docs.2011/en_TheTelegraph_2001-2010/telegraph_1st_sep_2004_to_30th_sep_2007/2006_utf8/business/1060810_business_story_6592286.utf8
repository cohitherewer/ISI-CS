 Seagate earnings take a plunge

 San Francisco, Aug. 9 (Reuters): Seagate Technology, the biggest US computer hard-disk drive maker, said on Tuesday its quarterly net profit plunged 98 per cent due principally to costs from acquiring rival Maxtor Corp. 

 Seagate also said it planned to repurchase as much as $2.5 billion of its stock over the next two years, after buying back about $400 million of stock in the quarter ended June 30. 

 Seagate shares fell 4.4 per cent in extended trading to $19.80 after closing 3.5 percent lower on the New York Stock Exchange. Seagate said average selling prices fell as personal computer makers cut prices to compete, and it offered a revenue forecast for this quarter short of analysts expectations. 

 Weve been very surprised at some of the pricing that some of the people have done in the market as they try to grab share, chief executive Bill Watkins said in an interview.

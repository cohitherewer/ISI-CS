 Rupee prop underway

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chidambaram: Help at hand

 New Delhi, July 19: The Reserve Bank is likely to intervene soon through state-run banks to prop up the rupee. 

 Top North Block officials said that the extreme volatility of the rupee was not exactly something we like and hinted that the government would try to reverse the trend.

 We should not forget the rupee was 47 to the dollar in 2003 also, finance minister P. Chidambaram told newspersons here today. 

 He said the rupee value reflected demand and supply conditions, adding that it is stable in terms of the real effective exchange rate (REER), the most appropriate indicator of its performance.

 The rupee today plummeted to more than three year closing lows of 47 per dollar following fresh dollar demand from oil companies as well as corporate houses. 

 Analysts said the rupee suffered at the hands of high oil prices that has triggered speculation in markets. 

 They said exporters unwillingness to sell dollars also caused the slide, while the RBI is yet to intervene to defuse the situation.

 Equity markets, too, are in a bear phase, falling by over two per cent, amid steady withdrawals by foreign institutional investors.

 North Block officials believe the weak rupee is a result of rising oil prices, which have hit $78 to a barrel, and current account deficit which is slated to come near 1.5 per cent of GDP this year. 

 Market tumbles

 The stock market tumbled for the fifth consecutive day and nosedived past the 10,000 mark during todays trading session. 

 Buoyed by a recovery in the Asian stock markets and fall in oil prices, the sensex opened higher at 10320.59 and surged to hit a high of 10406.21 in early trade. 

 However, concerns over falling rupee and selling by FIIs and mutual funds triggered s sell-off in the markets, which saw the index tanking to a low of 9972.73. 

 The indicative index ended the day just a shade over the 10000 mark at 10007.34, losing 219.44 points or 2.15 per cent.

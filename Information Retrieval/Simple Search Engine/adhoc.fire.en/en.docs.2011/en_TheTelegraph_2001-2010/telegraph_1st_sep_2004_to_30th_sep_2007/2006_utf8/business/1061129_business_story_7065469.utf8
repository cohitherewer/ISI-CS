 Wipro to hire more foreigners

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Premji: Global force

 New Delhi, Nov. 28: Wipro plans to have more foreign employees as it expands its business in Europe and South America. 

 The company expects foreign employees to make up 25 per cent of its total workforce in future against 5 per cent at present.

 Wipro chief Azim Premji today said as part of its policy to go global, the company would have to employ more local nationals in the countries to which it was spreading its wings.

 The company has big plans for France and Germany where it has a relatively small presence. 

 Wipro is expecting more incremental revenues from Europe in future, Premji said at a book launch on the sidelines of the India Economic Summit here. The book on Wipro and Premji is written by Pulitzer prize winning journalist Steve Hamm of Businessweek. 

 Premji said, We are strong in Scandinavian and Benelux countries and are building business in Germany and France. That does not mean that the revenues from the US will shrink. Since our penetration level in Europe is lower, the revenue will go up in the years to come.

 Premji said although Wipro had acquired three companies in the US and another three in Europe, mergers and acquisitions were not the only way to expand overseas. The company would set up its own units as well, he added. 

 He said the company would target acquisitions in the range of $50-100 million.

 Premji, however, declined to divulge further, saying, I cannot give closed information. 

 Premji told The Telegraph that Wipro was waiting for the Bengal government to allot it land at Rajarhat to set up its new facility. 

 After the land is allotted, it would take 15 months to construct the new facility, he said.

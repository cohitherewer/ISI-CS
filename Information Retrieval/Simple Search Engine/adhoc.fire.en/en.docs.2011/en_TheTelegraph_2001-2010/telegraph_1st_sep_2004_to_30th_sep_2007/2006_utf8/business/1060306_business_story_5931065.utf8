 Spotlight on emerging markets kitty

 Money matters

 The sensex continues to defy gravity, in spite of the fact that all that the Union budget has done is to meet the extremely low expectations of the market. It?s the old liquidity story once again, now that the uncertainty of the budget is out of the way. And just to get an idea of the kind of liquidity we?re talking about, Emerging Markets Portfolio.com research points out that net inflows into global emerging market funds in the first eight weeks of 2006 are only slightly lower than net inflows into these funds for the whole of 2005. Add to that the money raised by domestic mutual funds that are getting jittery about sitting on cash while the market shoots up, and you have a strong rally.

 The big question therefore remains: where is global liquidity heading? 

 In a recent note to investors, Michael Hartnett, Merrill Lynch?s chief equity strategist for global emerging markets, has pointed to three nasty trends. One, equity prices in the Saudi Arabian market fell 10 per cent in three sessions, the message being lower oil prices. That will mean lower surpluses to invest in markets like India as well.

 Next, yields in the Japanese bond market have moved up to five-year highs ? that too will affect liquidity. And third, volatility in the US treasury market is up 9 per cent from multi-year lows reached recently, which means that risk aversion is rising.

 Consider also that the European central bank has raised rates by another 25 basis points, while there are cracks in the consensus that the US Federal Reserve will stop its series of rate hikes soon. There are also an increasing number of indications that the US housing market is cooling off. In short, while there?s still plenty of liquidity sloshing around, the tide could be starting to turn.

 That?s precisely the conclusion reached by Morgan Stanley?s economics head for Asia-Pacific, Andy Xie. Xie points to emerging bond markets, where risk premiums have declined from an average of 352 basis points in the first half of 2004 to 52 basis points at present. The rise in emerging market equities reflects this drop in the risk premium on emerging market bonds. Xie believes that while momentum is still strong, the near zero risk premium on emerging market sovereign debt suggests that the boom is nearing its end. He points, in particular, to the rise in Japanese interest rates, which could end the ?carry trade? ? borrowing in cheap yen to invest in US treasuries. The concern is that if the carry trade ends, US long-term interest rates may climb. Xie says India?s sensex, China?s H-share index, and Japan?s TOPIX are where risk-takers have been congregating and these are consequently most at risk from an upturn in the risk premium.

 The contrary view is that there?s a fundamental reason why money is moving out of the US to emerging markets. As Pimco bond guru Bill Gross puts it, the US has exhausted its savings, lost its competitive edge and squandered its educational heritage. ?We have grown soft,? says Gross, while ?they (emerging markets) have grown stronger?. 

 ?We have lost a sense of why we have prospered ? they have learned to replicate our work ethics of yesteryears,? he added. The solution for the US, he says, will be ?currency devaluation, inflating away of long-term pension liabilities, and payment of rising healthcare expenses via higher personal and corporate taxes. Investment markets in the United States will not ultimately prosper under such an increasingly odorous environment. It is only sensible, therefore, to diversify globally?.

 Is it any wonder then that while the sensex and Brazil?s Bovespa have gone up by 249 per cent and 247 per cent respectively in the last three years, the Dow has risen by a mere 38 per cent?

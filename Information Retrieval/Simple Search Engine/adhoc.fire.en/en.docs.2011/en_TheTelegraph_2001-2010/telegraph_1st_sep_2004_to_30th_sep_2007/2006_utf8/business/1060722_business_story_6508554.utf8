 Calcutta, July 21: Exide Industries is planning to acquire a manufacturing facility in Germany this fiscal. It is exploring the potential of one of the many storage battery plants that have been put up for sale there. 

 We have already visited a few of them and are now examining the pros and cons of buying one, said S.B. Ganguly, chairman and chief executive officer of Exide Industries. However, the company is yet to decide whether it would buy out such a facility or enter into a joint venture with a local partner.

 Speaking on the sidelines of the companys 59th annual general meeting here, Ganguly said such an acquisition would help Exide serve its clients in the European market better.

 Exides UK subsidiary Espex Batteries Ltd has been catering to the European market. Espex has clocked a net profit of ?27,396 and a turnover of ?1.624 million for the year ended March 31, 2006.

 Ganguly also said his company would invest between Rs 100 crore and Rs 120 crore this year to expand capacity. 

 Of this, Rs 40 crore has already been spent to increase the industrial battery manufacturing capacity at its Haldia facility and set up a new factory adjacent to the existing plant. 

 The new plant will commence operations by December and manufacture traction batteries catering only to the export market, Ganguly said. 

 In a bid to export more batteries, Exide Industries is also expanding the manufacturing capacities at its Hosur, Pune, Shyamnagar and Taloja plants. We export 20,000 cells a year, which contribute not even 10 per cent to the total turnover. We want to increase this to 40,000 units a year, Ganguly said.

 Exide Industries today reported robust earnings for the April-June quarter this fiscal. Net profit rose to Rs 38.1 crore from Rs 24.2 crore in the same period last year. Gross sales stood at Rs 563.49 crore against Rs 417.45 crore a year ago.

 The company has clocked profits despite the rising raw material prices, especially lead.

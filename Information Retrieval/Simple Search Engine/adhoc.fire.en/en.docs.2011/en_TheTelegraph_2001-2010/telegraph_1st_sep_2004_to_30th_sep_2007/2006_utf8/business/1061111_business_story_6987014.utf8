 Better outlook for rich nations

 Paris, Nov. 10 (Reuters): The economic outlook for the Group of Seven industrial nations has improved, an Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) report released on Friday showed, but it also pointed to slowing growth in the euro area.

 The Paris-based OECD said its composite leading indicator for the G7 area rose to 105.6 in September from a revised 105.2 in August. Italy was the only one of the seven countries to post a decline.

 The figure for the 30-nation OECD area also improved, to 109.6 in September from a revised 109.1 in the previous month. A less volatile measure, the six-month rate of change, rose 2.5 per cent in September for the OECD area compared with 2.1 per cent in August.

 But that same indicator for the euro zone countries rose 2.7 per cent, slower than the 3.1 per cent rise in the previous month.

 The latest composite leading indicators suggest that slow economic expansion lies ahead in the OECD area, the OECD said.

 September 2006 data show improved performance in the CLIs (composite leading indicator) six-month rate of change in the United States and Japan, but weakening performance in the Euro area.

 Behuria: Looking ahead

 Raipur, Oct. 27: The Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) has expressed its interest to join hands with the Chhattisgarh government for the commercial production of bio-diesel. The state government and the oil major has agreed to set up a high-level committee that would work out an action plan within a month before proceeding with the project. 

 IOC chairman Sarthak Behuria called on Chhattisgarh chief minister Raman Singh during the chief ministers recent visit to New Delhi and discussed about the possibilities of joint venture in bio-diesel production. 

 To start with the work, the state government and the IOC had agreed to constitute a working group comprising senior officers of the Chhattisgarh government and the IOC to prepare an action plan for the project. 

 The group will have one member each from the states forest Department, Chhattisgarh Renewable Energy Development Agency (CREDA) and senior officers of Indian Oil Corporation. 

 The group will explore the pros and cons of commercial production of bio-diesel and present a model to the state government within a month. Under the proposed project, the state government will provide one lakh hectare of land to the IOC, which will extract bio-diesel from jatropha and sell it through its outlets in the state, managing director of Chhattisgarh Bio-fuel Development Authority (CBDA) S K Shukla told The Telegraph. 

 According to Shukla, the project will generate employment among rural youth, make productive use of the states wastelands and contribute to the growth rate of the state.

 The CBDA has cultivated jatropha the plant for bio-diesel in 88,000 hectares across 16 districts in the state. 

 Behuria yesterday told media persons in New Delhi that IOC could hire 33,000 farmers and labourers to cultivate jatropha in one lakh hectares. By cultivating jatropha in three hectares, one family can earn up to Rs 60,000 per annum. 

 IOC wants to build machinery for production of one lakh tonnes of bio-diesel in Chhattisgarh. The oil major will also provide technical know how, all necessary materials and other ancillary services for production of bio-diesel and will develop mechanism for the purchase of bio-diesel. 

 Raman Singh has hailed the proposal of IOC and said that it endorsed the efforts of Chhattisgarh government in promoting bio-fuel.

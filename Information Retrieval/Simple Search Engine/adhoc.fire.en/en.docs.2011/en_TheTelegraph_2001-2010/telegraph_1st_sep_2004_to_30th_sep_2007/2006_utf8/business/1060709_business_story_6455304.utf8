The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 AllBank arm in makeover mode

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 8: AllBank Finance, the non-banking finance subsidiary of Allahabad Bank, will start functioning as a Tier-1 merchant banker in three to four months. 

 We have already received the merchant banking licence and we are now looking for a chief executive officer for the division, said Allahabad Bank chairman and managing director .N. Singh. He was speaking at the annual general meeting of Allahabad Bank today. Singh added that AllBank Finance would now function on the lines of SBI Capital Markets.

 The paid-up capital of AllBank Finance has been reduced to Rs 15 crore from Rs 60 crore after the bank received an approval from the department of company affairs recently. The bank had earlier approached Calcutta High Court for a merger of AllBank Finance with itself. Under the current stipulations, the minimum capital requirement for a merchant banker to start operations is Rs 5 crore.

 Allahabad Bank has received Rs 45 crore after the capital restructuring of AllBank Finance, Singh said. The public sector bank, along with its other nominees, hold the entire stake in AllBank Finance. 

 The money will add to our Tier I capital and increase the capital adequacy ratio, he added. 

 Singh said the banks proposal to set up a joint venture with Punjab National Bank in Kazakhstan has received the approval of both the Reserve Bank of India and the government of Kazakhstan. 

 PNB will hold a 60 per cent stake in the joint venture, while the remaining 40 per cent will be with us, Singh said. 

 The joint venture will buy a bank in Kazakhstan. PNB is considering the options, but a target bank has not been finalised yet. The initial equity capital of the joint venture will be decided depending on the value of the acquisition. However, we are looking at a figure of $15 million (Rs 70 crore) for the acquisition, he added.

 For its proposed non-life insurance venture, Allahabad Bank and its other Indian partners, namely Indian Overseas Bank, Karnataka Bank and Dabur, are waiting for an approval from Japanese insurer Sompo and a clearance certificate from Japanese regulator FSA (Financial Services Agency), before signing the shareholders agreement. Sompo has been called up by FSA for some clarifications relating to its audit reports. The insurer is yet to give us a no-objection certificate from FSA, Singh explained. 

 Meanwhile, the Indian partners have appointed Ernst amp; Young to look into the specifics of the venture plan.

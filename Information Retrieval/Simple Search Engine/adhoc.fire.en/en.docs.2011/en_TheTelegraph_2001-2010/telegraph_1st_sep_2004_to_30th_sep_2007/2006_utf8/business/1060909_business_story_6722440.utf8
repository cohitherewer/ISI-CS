 Inflation rate rises to 5.01%

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Sept. 8: The rising rates of essential goods, including fruits, pulses and vegetables, pushed up the countrys wholesale price index to 5.01 per cent for the week ended August 26 from 4.91 per cent in the previous week.

 Retail prices rose at an even faster rate, which meant more burden on households.

 Finance minister P. Chidambaram, however, played down the impact of rising prices. He said, Although the 5.01 per cent figure is technically above 5 per cent, this is not something to be alarmed about.

 Its our intention to keep it below 5 per cent. There has been some supply disruptions in vegetables and fruits. There continues to be some pressure on wheat and pulses as well, he told reporters.

 He said the ministry of food and consumer affairs was best equipped to address issues of supply of wheat and pulses.

 Given the difficulties on the supply side for wheat and pulses, we will consider whatever steps can be taken to keep inflation below 5 per cent.

 Earlier this year, the rate of inflation had crossed the 5-per-cent mark in the week ended June 17 and June 24, touching 5.22 per cent and 5.44 per cent, respectively.

The government had revised the final inflation figure 

for the week ended July 1 to 5.21 per cent from the provisional estimate of 4.96 

per cent. The Centre has been trying to keep the rate of inflation in check by 

banning the export of pulses, cutting the import duty on wheat and allowing non-state 

companies to import wheat and sugar to stockpile and drive down prices. A good 

monsoon and a bumper paddy crop is expected to help bring down food prices.

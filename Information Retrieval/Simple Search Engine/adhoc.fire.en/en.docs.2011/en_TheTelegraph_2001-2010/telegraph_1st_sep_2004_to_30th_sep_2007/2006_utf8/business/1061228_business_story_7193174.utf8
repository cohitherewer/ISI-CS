 Mittal not keen to hold post of chairman

 London, Dec. 27 (PTI) Steel tycoon Lakshmi Mittal has made it clear that he is not keen on becoming chairman of Arcelor-Mittal next year.

 Arcelor-Mittal, the worlds largest steel producer could start looking for an outside non-executive chairman when Joseph Kinsch retires next year, Mittal said.

 I dont have the aim of being the chairman, Mittal, president and chief executive of the company, told the Financial Times.

 When Mittal Steel finalised the 18 billion purchase of Arcelor, Mittal had indicated that he would become chairman when Kinsch retires next year. But since then he had become chief executive after Roland Junck, a former Arcelor manager appointed in August, was moved aside last month.

 Though he admitted that he could do both the job as chief executive and chairman, Mittal said, I dont have the aim of being the chairman.

 To address concerns that Mittal would have too much control if he took on both roles, the steel group, producing 110 million tonnes steel per annum, could start a search for an outsider to share some power with Mittal who owns 45 per cent of the company. His son Aditya Mittal is in place as the groups finance chief.

 Another possibility, Mittal said, was that Joseph Kinsch formerly Arcelor chairman could continue beyond his intended retirement date.

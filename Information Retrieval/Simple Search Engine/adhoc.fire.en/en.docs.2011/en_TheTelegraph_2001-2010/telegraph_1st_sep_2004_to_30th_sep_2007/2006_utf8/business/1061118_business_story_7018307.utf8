 Hutchison disconnects local IPO call

 Calls barred

 London, Nov. 17 (Reuters): Hutchison Whampoa, the Hong Kong-based conglomerate, has said it no longer sees a need to list its Indian mobile phone venture, or any of its 3G mobile businesses.

 The time has gone now, group managing director Canning Fok said on the sidelines of a product launch in London when asked about the possible listing of Hutchisons Indian business.

 After we listed HTIL (Hutchison Telecommunications International Ltd), I dont need a listing in India, he said.

 Hutchison had originally planned to list Hutchison Essar, Indias third-biggest mobile operator, sometime this year, but Fok said disagreements with its Indian partner meant that the planned flotation had been abandoned.

 When you have disagreements, you dont go listing, Fok said, adding that even the original plan to list the business was principally to honour a promise made by Hutchison to its partner.

 Hutchison and Indias Essar group are locked in a dispute over the proposed merger of another mobile operator purchased by Essar with Hutchison Essar. 

 Hutchisons emerging markets telecom arm, HTIL, owns a majority stake in Hutchison Essar, which is the biggest mobile operator in Mumbai and whose market value has been estimated by analysts to be well over $10 billion.

 Fok also ruled out listing any of the groups 3G mobile phone businesses, saying the time for a flotation had passed. 

 The need for flotation is not there anymore. We are concentrating on taking the business into making money, he said. 

 Contrary to market speculation, he said the group also had no plans to sell any of its 3G mobile assets, on which it has spent $25 billion over the past few years. 

 The chief executive of larger rival Vodafone, Arun Sarin, was quoted in many UK newspapers as saying on Wednesday that the British mobile market was ripe for consolidation and that he would look at Hutchisons 3UK if it came on the market.

 If 3UK were to put their assets up for sale, I think we would look at them, Sarin was quoted as saying.

 Calcutta, Feb. 22: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has for the first time instructed the finance and commerce ministry representatives to jointly conduct a meeting with various export organisations every six months.

 This landmark decision to involve the commerce and finance ministries simultaneously was taken after the different export organisation representatives met the Prime Minister. The Union finance and commerce ministers and other cabinet members were also present at the meeting on January 24.

 Exporters were represented by the Engineering Export Promotion Council (EEPC) and members from export-oriented sectors like gems and jewellery, textile, apparel, synthetic, electronics, the Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO) and 100 per cent export-oriented units (EOUs), EEPC chairman Rakesh Shah said.

 The Prime Minister was apprised of the transformation undergone by the export industry in the last decade. He was also told about the lift in the international profile, including hosting 24 international events by organisations like EEPC in a year, Shah said.

 Shah expects engineering exports to go up to $19 billion, exceeding the target of $18.3 billion. This would comprise 19.5 per cent of the countrys total exports. The growth will be fuelled if more than 100 items listed under the Directorate-General of Commercial Intelligence and Statistics (DGCIS) is brought under engineering exports.

 The entry into the Chinese market requires a different strategy and approach and more information is required regarding the kind of engineering items required in that market. The EEPC will appoint a leading consultancy firm to conduct a feasibility study for the Chinese market, said Shah.

 New Delhi, May 10: Yamaha Motors India plans to invest Rs 300 crore over the next three years and will also set up a second plant in south India soon.

 ?We are likely to invest about Rs 300 crore over a period of three years. Funds for this will be arranged from internal accruals and other sources, including money from the parent company,? said Takahiro Maeda, Yamaha Motors director and executive vice-president (marketing).

 The company may also consider setting up a new plant in south India by 2010. ?Our target is to sell above one million bikes by 2010 for which we would need a new production unit,? Yamaha Motors India CEO and managing director Tomotaka Ishikawa said. He said considering the distribution network, the company would prefer to have its plant somewhere in south India.

 Yamaha Motors plans to ramp up its production capacity at the Greater Noida facility from 4 lakh units to 6 lakh units by the end of this year, Ishikawa added.

 The motorcycle manufacturer, which has a market share of 5 per cent in India, hopes to corner at least 15 per cent by 2010.

 Yamaha Motors today launched a 125-cc Gladiator, which was earlier showcased at the auto expo. The bike is priced between Rs 41,990 and Rs 44,990 (ex showroom Delhi). 

 The company is also planning to launch two models each year till 2010. ?The end of this year will see another model in the standard segment,? Maeda said. ?In future we will consider getting international motorcycle models to India as well,? he said.

 Last year, between January and December, the company sold 2.5 lakh units of motorcycles in India and exported approximately 50,000 units to neighbouring countries.

 In the current year, the company hopes to sell 3 lakh units in the domestic market and export about 60,000 to one lakh units to Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and the Philippines, among other destinations. 

 The company has posted a turnover of Rs 760 crore last year and is looking at an increase of 40 per cent in the current fiscal, said Maeda. 

 According to Maeda, the 125 cc segment constitutes 20 per cent of the entire motorcycle market, which grew to 7.5 million units in 2005. This segment is expected to grow to 40 per cent soon, he said.

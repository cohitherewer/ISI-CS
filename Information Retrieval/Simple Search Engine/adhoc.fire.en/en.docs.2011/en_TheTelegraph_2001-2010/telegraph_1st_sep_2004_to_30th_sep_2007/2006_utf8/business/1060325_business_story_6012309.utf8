The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 India gives Japan, China a tough fight

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 24: India is poised to become the largest investor from Asia in the UK overtaking Japan and China and one of the top four investors globally.

 A Commonwealth Business Council study will list all British companies in India and the Indian ones operating in the UK, said Mark Dolan, director of UKs Inward Investment Group in India.

 The study, which is due in April 2006, will provide a detailed analysis of the current investment scenario in both the countries. We will then have a clear idea about investments from India in the UK and vice versa, Dolan said.

 Currently, India is the eighth largest investor globally in the UK and the third from Asia after Japan and China.

 About 60 per cent of the Indian investment in Europe go to the UK.

 Global investments in the UK for the first three quarters of this fiscal comprised 37 per cent in IT (business process outsourcing and software development), 16 per cent in financial services, 13 per cent in pharmaceuticals and healthcare and 5 per cent in auto components.

 The UK trade and investment business awards 2006 have also been launched to strengthen trade relations.

 The awards will be given to knowledge-based companies from India and the UK in categories like investor of the year, business partnership of the year, innovation and entrepreneurship. 

 To encourage small and medium enterprises (SMEs), a special award has been instituted for start-up success stories of SMEs in the UK or India, Dolan said.

 The awards are for firms of Indian and British origin excelling in knowledge-based industries, including information and communications technology, software, business process outsourcing, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, healthcare, automotive and engineering services.

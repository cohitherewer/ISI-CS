 No subsidy for private oil firms

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 4: Petroleum minister Murli Deora today ruled out any government subsidy to private oil companies like Reliance on the sale of petrol and diesel.

 There is no question of subsidy for private players. We have sympathy but you do not expect the government to fund private players, Deora said.

 The public sector companies have to sell petrol and diesel at fixed prices, but private companies are free to set their own prices. 

 However, since public sector companies are dominant players in the market, auto fuel sold at higher prices cannot attract customers. This has resulted in a crisis for Reliance. 

 Reliance dealers are up in arms as their customers have deserted them and they fear bankruptcy as they have to pay back loans to banks. As many as 50 per cent of the 1,200-odd petrol pumps selling Reliance products are dealer-owned. 

 They want the company to compensate them for their losses. 

 Reliance was trying to assure them that it was in touch with the government to get a level playing field. Which in effect meant that it would also get compensation from the government on the same lines as the public sector companies Indian Oil and Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum.

 Deora statement today clearly comes as a setback for Reliance in its attempt to bring its dealers around to its viewpoint. 

 Although Reliance Industries had recently raised dealers commission, this did not help as the sales volumes had dried up.

 Rattled by the protesting dealers, the company has now offered to bear their interest burden for the first three months. 

 The petroleum ministry is of the view that Reliance cannot be equated with the public sector oil companies which sell kerosene and LPG to domestic consumers at highly subsidised prices. Reliance on the other hand sells its LPG and kerosene to the public sector companies at international prices. 

 Similarly the company gets a much higher price for its natural gas produced at the western offshore Tapti and Panna-Mukta fields than what ONGC gets for its gas.

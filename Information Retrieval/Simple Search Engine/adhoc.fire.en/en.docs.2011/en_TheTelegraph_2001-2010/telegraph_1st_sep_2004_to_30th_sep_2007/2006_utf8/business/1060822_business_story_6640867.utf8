 Recipe for check on food prices

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 Stock-taking

 New Delhi, Aug. 21: The Congress government has cooked up a novel plan to keep food prices in control eat more chawal and less roti.

 The plan is simple: this year there has been a bumper paddy crop. The government plans to cash in on that and load more of the crop in its silos. With more rice coming to the market, prices will automatically come down and the government hopes people will switch from roti to chawal.

 We are taking no chances after the wheat debacle.... the rice crop is a bumper one this year and we are buying a third of it. It will be sold through the public distribution system as an alternative to wheat to keep food prices in check, top officials said.

 We know from experience that an average Indian buys both the grains but varies the amount of purchases, keeping in view food preferences and prices. With rice in plentiful at reasonable prices, demand for wheat will slacken bringing down its prices too. 

 The government, through its agencies, has already bought some 28 million tonnes of the bumper crop of 91.04 mt of rice this year. It hopes to end the season next month by buying another 2 mt, taking its total paddy procurement to nearly 30 mt or an unprecedented one-third of the crop! 

 This is nearly 50 per cent more than what the government bought last year. 

 Reduced wheat stocks in government silos in the beginning of this year, a lower crop output and low procurement sent wheat prices rising to Rs 1,000 a quintal in January, an increase of 40 per cent in just one year. 

 The government managed to bring down prices to Rs 850 a quintal by announcing wheat imports by the middle of this year. Prices have, however, started firming up again with speculators making big money as the wheat stock ordered by the government are yet to reach Indian shores. 

 India has contracted purchases of 3.9 mt of wheat since March this year, the first wheat imports in six years. However, less than half of that have actually reached Indian ports. State-run agencies managed to procure only 9.2 mt of wheat from domestic farmers this year. Production of wheat was also down to 69.48 mt compared with a target of 75.5 mt.

 Government stocks of wheat were estimated at 8.2 million tonnes on July 1, nearly 9 mt lower than the required level of 17.1 million tonnes at that date. But rice stocks stood at 11.4 mt, nearly 2 mt more than the buffer norms of 9.8 mt. Now with the bumper crops, this stock is estimated to have gone up to 25 mt. 

 The wheat imports when they actually arrive will help dampen prices ... but the huge stock of rice we are building up will be the main weapon in keeping food prices down, officials said. A good monsoon has already helped bring down fruit and vegetable prices, now the hope is that rice will hold down foodgrain prices.

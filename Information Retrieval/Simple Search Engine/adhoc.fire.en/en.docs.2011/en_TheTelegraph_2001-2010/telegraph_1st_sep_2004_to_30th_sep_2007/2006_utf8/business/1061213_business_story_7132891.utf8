 Teletech for selling and distributing Polycoms voice

 Polycom, the global video and

 launch a range of India-centric voice over internet protocol 

 (VoIP) and video conferencing products by the first quarter 

 of 2007.

 By 2007, Polycom will launch 

 VoIP products with features acceptable to India enterprises 

 at penetrative prices to scale up volumes, said Yugal

 to reach out to a major proportion of the small and medium 

 enterprise section as well as the newly emerging SOHO market.

 suite of business software.

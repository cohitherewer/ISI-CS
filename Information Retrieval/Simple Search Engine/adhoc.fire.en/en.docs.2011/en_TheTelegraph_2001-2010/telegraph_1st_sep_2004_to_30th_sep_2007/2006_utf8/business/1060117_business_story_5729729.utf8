 New Delhi, Jan. 16: Small cars still sell the most. Nobody perhaps understands this better than Maruti Udyog Limited (MUL), whose bread and butter offering ? M800 ? continues to be its cash cow.

 However, more and more Indian small car buyers are upgrading to the slightly larger family coupes and auto majors are seeking to cash in on this. But small cars still remain a big draw for everyone for obvious reasons. 

 Maruti has announced plans to invest Rs 2,178 crore by 2008 and would add five more cars to its stable, including a diesel vehicle, over the next five years ? most of these will be either family coupes or small cars. 

 We will be able to offer Indian customers a compact diesel car that will combine the latest technology with path-breaking looks. This car will be available by the end of 2006 calendar year, said Maruti Udyog managing director Jagdish Khattar.

 Japanese giant Toyota is also developing a small car, reportedly with its subsidiary, Daihatsu. 

 The tie-up between Mahindra amp; Mahindra and French automaker Renault also aims at offering a small car from the M amp;M stable. 

 Analysts tracking the developments in the domestic auto market said Volkswagen could also roll out a small car in India.

 Marutis pavilion at the Auto Expo displays the sports utility vehicle Escudo, alongside the Solio ? a vehicle specifically designed for the physically challenged.

 The new car plant and the new diesel engine facility will begin production at the end of this calendar, said Khattar. He also said additional investments would be made for introducing new models, research and development and upgrading the existing models.

 Not to be left behind, Tata Motors unveiled a spanking new version of Indica. The company also announced an alliance with Italys Fiat SpA to co-operate on dealer network sharing and also get access to new markets. The alliance will help Tata get new technology and enhance its product portfolio along with overseas expansion, group chairman Ratan Tata said at the 8th Auto Expo here.

 According to the agreement, a selection of Fiat cars will be available at the Tata dealers along with after-sale services and spare parts from March 2006.

 The Tata-Fiat agreement is more important for the latter as it is planning to revisit its small car strategy for India with the launch of the Grade Punto even as it is desperately seeking to shore up its sales after plunging into the worst crisis in the recent history. This alliance enables us to increase out customer base in India and provide superior service and facilities to our existing customers, said Fiat chief executive officer Sergio Marchionne.

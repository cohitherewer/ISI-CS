 LSE rolls out red carpet

 New listing

 Shanghai, April 14 (Reuters): The London Stock Exchange expects to win at least 20 Chinese listings in 2006, as Europes biggest bourse takes aim at the growing field of young Chinese entrepreneurial firms looking to raise capital.

 A team of LSE officials is co-ordinating with Chinese regulators to encourage more qualified Chinese companies to go for London listings this year, said Jane Zhu, the bourses top Asia-Pacific executive.

 At the same time, the exchange also wants to attract more privately-owned Chinese firms to its Alternative Investment Market (AIM), a second-tier board aimed at smaller but fast-growing companies.

 For China, we are targeting two types ? big-sized state-owned firms, like Air China, and small but (high) potential privately-owned companies, Zhu said in a roundtable interview in Shanghai, Chinas financial hub.

 Air China Ltd, the countrys biggest airline, listed its shares in Hong Kong and London in a $1.2-billion IPO in December 2004.

 We expect at least 20 Chinese firms to go for listing on our AIM this year, said Zhu, adding that 16 Chinese firms launched initial public offerings on AIM in 2005. On average, an AIM IPO can raise $10 million.

 The LSE wants to take business from its transatlantic rivals, the New York Stock Exchange and the tech-oriented Nasdaq.

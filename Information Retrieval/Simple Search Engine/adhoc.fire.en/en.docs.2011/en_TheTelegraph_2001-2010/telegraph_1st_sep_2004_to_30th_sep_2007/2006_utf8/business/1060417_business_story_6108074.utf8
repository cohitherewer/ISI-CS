RISING FORTUNES

 Calcutta, April 16: Private life insurance companies have posted a growth of over 80 per cent in 2005-06 and they are lining up fresh capital infusion to keep up the pace.

 Kotak Mahindra Old Mutual Life Insurance Company, a joint venture between Kotak Mahindra and Old Mutual Life Insurance of South Africa, has reported a 100 per cent growth in its first premium income in 2005-06.

 Our first-year premium from regular premium policies has jumped to Rs 349 crore in 2005-06 from Rs 174 crore in the previous fiscal, said Kotak Life vice-president Subhasis Ghosh. The total premium income (first-year premium plus renewal premium) grew 76 per cent to Rs 640 crore from Rs 454 crore a year ago, he added.

 Its promoters have decided to pump in Rs 50 crore fresh equity capital to expand branch network and double its direct agent force.

 We will open 24 branches across the country and of this, three will be in the eastern region ? Jamshedpur, Jorhat and Tinsukhia, Ghosh said.

 The company hopes to double its premium income in 2006-07. To achieve this, it will launch four plans ? two unit-linked and two conventional ? this fiscal. The new unit-linked plans will have lower charges.

 However, its first premium income from single-premium policies has declined to Rs 170 crore last fiscal. This is because of a conscious effort on our part to reduce focus on selling single-premium policies, Ghosh added.

 Another private life insurer, Aviva Life Insurance Company, also hopes to register a 100 per cent growth in annualised premium equivalent (which includes first year regular premium and 10 per cent of single premium) during the year to December 2006.

 For the 12-month period ended December 31, our average premium equivalent was Rs 314 crore and we hope to grow by triple digits this year, too, said Vivek Khanna, director-marketing of Aviva Life Insurance Company India Pvt Ltd.

 The average premium size of the life insurer has also increased to Rs 35,000 on the back of a bancassurance network with 22 banks. In January, Aviva promoters pumped in Rs 139 crore into the insurance joint venture, raising the equity capital base to Rs 459 crore. The fresh capital was infused to stem the solvency margin and meet expansion needs.

 The private insurer has decided to expand across the country, particularly in rural areas. Currently, the company has 104 branches.The rural market presents a big opportunity for us, Khanna said. We have already launched specialised branches in rural areas and have also started selling simple unit-linked products there, he added.

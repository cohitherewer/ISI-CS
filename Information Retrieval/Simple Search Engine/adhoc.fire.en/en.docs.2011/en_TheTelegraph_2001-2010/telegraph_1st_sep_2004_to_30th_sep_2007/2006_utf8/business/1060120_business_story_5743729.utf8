 Genpact keen to buy firms

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Jan. 19: Genpact, formerly GE Capital International Services, is looking at acquiring two or three firms in the next couple of years. 

 Although the firm is yet to decide on sectors it will target, it is likely to consider firms in banking, insurance, financial and accounting services, supply chain, and human resources, said Pramod Bhasin, president and CEO. 

 We will not look at Indian companies due to the high valuation but focus on firms from the UK and US, he said.

 Genpact is planning to expand and is scouting for locations in Bhubaneswar, Goa, Mohali and Nagpur. 

 The company is set to close the calendar year 2006 with a turnover of $625 million, out of which 70 per cent is slated to come from India. Last year, Genpact had reported a turnover of $490 million. The company is growing at the rate of 25 per cent annually. 

 Recently, Genpact has signed a 5-7 year contract with Germany-based technology group Linde for providing financial and accounting services valued at $60 million. 

 The companys centre in Delhi will partly service the contract, Bhasin said.

 The Calcutta centre, which employs about 70 people, will increase the strength to 1,500 in the next two years.

 Sensex tumbles on US worries

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Nov. 28: The bellwether index of the stock market sensex today gave up 172 points on worries over the impact of a slowdown in the US economy coupled with weak global cues.

 The sensex slide was led by technology stocks and the index ended at 13601.95, its biggest fall since September 11 this year.

 While the fall provided the much needed correction, market mavens were a wee bit apprehensive ahead of the release of key US economic data. If the data indicates a slowdown in the US economy, brokers felt shares could witness fresh selling pressure.

 The sensex, which closed at a new peak yesterday, opened sharply lower at 13690.67 and later pierced the 13600-mark to hit a low of 13577.38. Thereafter, it gained a little to close at 13601.95, a net fall of 1.25 per cent, from 13773.59 yesterday.

 On the National Stock Exchange (NSE), the S amp;P CNX Nifty dropped 47.15 points or 1.19 per cent to close at 3921.75 from previous close of 3968.90.

 Yesterday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped by 58.46 points after the worlds largest retailer Wal-Mart Stores gave a disappointing sales forecast. 

 The Nasdaq composite index also dipped by 54.34 points, its biggest decline since June 5 whereas in Asia, the Hang Seng slumped 564.48 points, Singapore ST 53.13 points, Nikkei 30.12 points and Kospi 13.66 points.

 The rise in global crude oil prices to above $60 a barrel also partly weighed negatively on share values.

 Technology stocks were the worst sufferers on worries that they will be badly hurt if there is a slowdown in the US. Infosys Technologies fell Rs 60.40 to 2,166.75, Wipro Rs 15.45 to Rs 586.20, TCS Rs 8.15 to Rs 1149.60 and Satyam Computer Rs 14.30 to Rs 450.20.

 The broad-based BSE-100 index dropped by 84.82 points to 6,898.60 from the previous close of 6,983.42.

 The BSE-200 index and the Dollex-200 were quoted sharply lower at 1,636.87 and 609.12 at close compared with 1,657.40 and 617.93 respectively. The BSE-500 index also declined by 62.03 points to 5,196.96 from the last close of 5,258.99.

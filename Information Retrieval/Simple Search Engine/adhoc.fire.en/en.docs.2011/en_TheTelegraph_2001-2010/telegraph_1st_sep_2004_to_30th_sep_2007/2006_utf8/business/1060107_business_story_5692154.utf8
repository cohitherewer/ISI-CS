 Run a Google search on Motorola handset

 Las Vegas/London, Jan. 6 (Reuters): Motorola Inc plans to put Google Incs Internet search technology into the software that runs its mobile phones and work with Kodak to make on-the-go Web surfing and photo swapping easier, the companies have said.

 This year, the worlds second biggest cellphone maker will start letting customers bring up a Google search engine at the touch of a button on some phones, the two companies said. Motorola also said it has signed a 10-year deal to work with photo technology company Kodak to make camera phones easier to use.

 As mobile players around the world work to add everything from music and video to photography and Web surfing to their offerings, Google, Motorola and Kodak want to be the driving forces to make such services easier to use.

 Google chief executive Eric Schmidt said his company, which runs the worlds most popular Web search engine, made the agreement because he believes that in the future mobile devices will be where consumers access the Internet most often.

 People are going to spend all their time on it eventually, said Schmidt, referring to the mobile Internet. He expects that much of that usage will come from the combination of phones that can pinpoint user location with its localised search software.

 The most obvious thing is maps, Schmidt said at Motorolas press event at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, the largest electronics show in the US.

 The firms said their three-year pact is not exclusive, but Schmidt said Motorola was the obvious partner because of the success of its Razr phone, which has become a design icon. At least one analyst believes that quicker access to Web search will lead many more people to use the Web on cellphones.

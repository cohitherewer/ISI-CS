 Baalu turns fund heat on port chiefs 

 S.P.S. PANNU 

 New Delhi, July 23: Shipping minister T.R. Baalu has pulled up the chiefs of major domestic ports for failing to fully utilise the funds allocated for development.

 The minister has reportedly said at a recent meeting that although the overall plan budget for port development was low given the requirements of this vital infrastructure, this could not be fully utilised.

 The minister told the chairmen to bring to his notice immediately any difficulty that they apprehend in completely utilising these funds so that remedial action can be taken instead of surrendering the funds later.

 Baalu also took stock of the projects being undertaken to deepen the approach channels to the ports as a shallow draft is a major problem.

 The Calcutta Port Trust told the minister that it has sent a proposal to the ministry regarding river regulatory measures to improve the draft of the Hooghly river and was still awaiting clearance. 

 According to senior ministry officials, the detailed project report has been circulated to the appraising agencies for their comments and had not come in yet.

 The Paradip port chairman said the first round of tenders invited for deepening its approach channel had to be scrapped as the quotes were extremely high. He said even the lowest bid was about Rs 100 crore more than the estimated cost of Rs 135 crore for the dredging work required.

 According to the chairperson of the Mumbai Port Trust, the port had been able to spend only Rs 19.23 crore in 2005-06 because the project for constructing two offshore container berths got delayed.

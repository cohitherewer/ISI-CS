 Cost bite in Alcoa net

 LOW OUTPUT

 New York, Jan. 10 (Reuters): Alcoa Inc, the worlds biggest aluminium producer, has posted a disappointing decline in fourth-quarter profit as a result of lower production due to hurricanes, strikes and restructuring costs.

 The company said it was still affected by higher-than-expected costs for raw materials and energy, although it does not see such substantial price spikes in 2006. 

 Shares of the first Dow Industrials company to report in the earnings season fell after-hours, dampening some market euphoria on a day when the Dow closed above 11,000 for the first time since 2001.

 Are we satisfied? The answer is no, chairman and chief executive officer Alain Belda said. But I cannot minimise our accomplishments in 2005, he added, referring to restructuring and cost-cutting plans put into effect. Belda said Alcoa had anticipated input costs ? raw materials and energy ? would rise approximately $600 million in 2005, while they in fact ended up being $747 million over the previous year. 

 Belda said: In 2006, we will battle some of the same pressures, but there is a feeling that unless there is a big change in oil prices, the majority of the pressure is under control and the actions we have taken should result in an improvement over 2005.

 LPG sales tax rejig to help retailers

 Whats in store

 New Delhi, March 1: The rationalisation of sales tax on cooking gas in this years budget will not provide immediate relief to consumers though it will give some fillip to loss-laden oil retailers.

 The Union Budget for 2006-07 has paved the way for a uniform sales tax on cooking gas in the country that currently varies between 8 and 14 per cent among different states.

 With LPG brought under the declared goods category, states will not be able to charge more than 4 per cent sales tax on the commodity. 

 While West Bengal, Bihar and Orissa are currently charging a sales tax of 12.5 per cent, Assam and Jharkhand are charging 9 per cent and Mizoram 8 per cent. 

 Under the new dispensation, downstream oil marketing companies ? Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum ? will get a respite of around Rs 1000 crore as they are losing Rs 190 on every LPG cylinder sold to households. 

 The high sales tax that the state governments are charging on LPG is seen as an anomaly as oil companies are losing money on the sales of subsidised cooking gas. 

 While the situation was tolerable when the oil companies were making overall profits, it cannot continue as the oil companies have plunged into the red and are headed for the sick bay, a senior official said.

 The cash-strapped state governments will obviously lose some easy pickings once the proposal is implemented in fiscal 2006-07. 

 However, the uniform sales tax rate will not provide immediate relief to consumers as the oil companies are not in a position to pass on the sales tax benefit to them.

 ATM charge

 In an attempt to step up tax collections, finance minister has included 15 new services under the service tax net, including ATM operations, maintenance and management. 

 As far ATM is concerned, the incidence of tax with be on service providers. Banks outsource the maintenance, operations and management of ATM services to specialised companies such as NCR.

 Besides their own ATM network, most banks have tied up with other banks enabling each others customers to use their ATM networks.

 Customers of State Bank of India (SBI), for instance, can withdraw cash from 5500 ATMs of SBI and its associate banks and also from 5000 ATMs of other banks such as Andhra Bank, HDFC Bank, Punjab National Bank, Uco Bank and UTI Bank.

 While withdrawal of money from State bank ATMs comes free of cost, customers have to pay Rs 20 plus a service tax of 10.2 per cent every time they withdraw money from the ATMs of other banks.

 These cross-bank ATM transactions may get slightly costlier, said a senior banker.

 The finance bill also clarified that remitting money through demand draft and other non-cash instruments is a taxable service.

 Banks offer various instruments for remittance of money including demand drafts, pay orders, telegraphic transfer (TT), electronic transfer of funds and bankers cheque.

 Importantly, some banks had increased the fee, also called the service charge, on these instruments, last year when the service tax rate was increased from 8 per cent to 10 per cent.

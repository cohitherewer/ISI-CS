 Dhoot: Cash hope

 New Delhi, Sept. 18: The Videocon group is looking at setting up two multi-product SEZs in Maharashtra.

 These will be set up in Pune and Aurangabad at an initial investment of Rs 2,000 crore.

 For this purpose, the group today signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the state government of Maharashtra.

 The SEZ will be a joint venture between Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) and Videocon, and a special purpose vehicle has been floated for the project, said a group official.

 The group plans to set up SEZs in Bengal as well.

 The group aims to create job opportunities for 50,000 people in the state, a company release said.

 While group officials refused to divulge further details, sources said Videocon is in talks with the Bengal government for the same.

 Meanwhile, it is learnt that the group is likely to change its plans to set up an IT software and hardware SEZ in Rajarhat. It is now looking at Sankrail in West Howrah for a 2,500-acre multi-product SEZ.

 Sources say the group has also decided to acquire 100 acres at Siliguri for an IT and biotechnology SEZ.

 Company officials said Videocon has also secured land in Gujarat and plans to enter the segment in South India as well.

 The initial investment by the Videocon group through group company Videocon Realty Infrastructure Limited (VRIL) will be around Rs 2,000 crore, said Venugopal Dhoot, chairman and managing director of Videocon.

 Videocon is also looking for a foreign equity partner in VRIL, he said, while ruling out listing of the company.

 The two SEZs in Maharashtra are expected to attract an investment of Rs 25,000 crore and is targeted to create 50,000 jobs in Pune and 75,000 in Aurangabad.

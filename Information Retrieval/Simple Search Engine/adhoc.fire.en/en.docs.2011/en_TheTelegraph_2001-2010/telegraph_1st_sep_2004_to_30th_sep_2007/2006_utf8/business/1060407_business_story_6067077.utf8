 Ford brushes aside bankruptcy fears

 MICHELINE MAYNARD

 Ford Jr: Hopeful

 Detroit, April 6: Ford chief William Clay Ford Jr said on Wednesday that he was confident the automaker could solve its financial problems and that a bankruptcy filing was not an option. 

 He said the company remained profitable and had plenty of cash on hand. But the brutal pace of competition in the auto industry, he said, meant companies had to throw out their assumptions about the business and be prepared for instant change. 

 Fords remarks came as he was honoured as the industrys executive of the year by the Automobile Industry Action Group, a non-profit association of auto companies. 

 Although Ford earned $2 billion worldwide last year, it lost $1.6 billion on its North American car business. 

 In January, Ford ordered the second revamping of his five-year tenure as chief executive. 

 Called the Way Forward, the plan calls for cutting 30,000 jobs and closing 10 plants through 2012. Fords plan was announced a few weeks after General Motors, which lost $10.8 billion last year, revealed its own programme to close all or part of a dozen plants and eliminate 30,000 jobs through 2008. 

 GMs troubles, and the bankruptcy of its biggest parts supplier, Delphi, have led to speculation that GM might file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. 

 Analysts say the fallout from a GM filing could damage Fords recovery efforts. 

 Ford said executives were continually studying what might happen to the company, based on the quickly deteriorating conditions in the industry. 

 He would not say if a GM bankruptcy was one of those possibilities, but said he was not considering such a move for Ford. 

 We dont see it at all, Ford said. He pointed to the companys cash, which stood at $25 billion at the end of 2005, as well as to the profitability of Ford Credit, the companys financing arm. 

 Were going to keep our strengths like Ford Credit, Ford said, indirectly referring to GMs sale on Monday of a 51 per cent stake in its financing unit. Were going to keep our liquidity. quot; 

 But Ford went on, Were acutely aware of how precarious this industry is. Its really up to us to be nimble enough to react. quot; Despite the gloom surrounding the industry, much of Fords speech was lighthearted. 

 Asked which Ford model excited him the most, Ford quipped, quot;Except for my wife, you mean? quot; The answer, he said, was the Ford Mustang, adding, quot;I have a whole bunch of them. quot; 

 A bunch of Ford family members, meanwhile, were on hand for Fords speech. They included his cousins Edsel B. Ford II, Elena Ford and Henry Ford III, Edsel Fords son, who recently joined the auto company. 

 Ford, who has pushed the company to be more innovative, said his priority was quot;to get honesty on the table quot; in his dealings at Ford. 

 quot;Too often in corporate America, you sit around the table, quot; Ford said, quot;everyone nods their head and agrees to stuff they know isnt true, and then they go out and the hallway talk starts. quot;

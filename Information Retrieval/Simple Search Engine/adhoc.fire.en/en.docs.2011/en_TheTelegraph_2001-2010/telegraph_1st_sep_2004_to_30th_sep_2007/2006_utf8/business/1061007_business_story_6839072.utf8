 VSNL shares soar on hint of land deal

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Oct. 6: Shares of Videsh Sanchar Nigam Ltd (VSNL) today surged on news that the Telecom Commission had decided to demerge its 773-acre land and that a proposal to this effect has been sent to the Union cabinet for its approval. 

 Demerger of the land, whose value is estimated to be well over Rs 7,000 crore, is expected to unlock significant value for its shareholders.

 The VSNL share was a favourite in both the exchanges. 

 On the BSE alone, it spurted 9.26 per cent to finish at Rs 432.40 after opening at Rs 413.25 and rising to an intra-day high of Rs 452. Compared with its previous close, the scrip finished with gains of Rs 36.65. Close to 43.90 lakh shares of the Tata group company changed hands, resulting in a turnover of Rs 192.11 crore.

 Reports said the Telecom Commission had decided to demerge VSNLs 770-acre land that lie in various parts of the country and it has put up a proposal for the Cabinets approval. It is understood that a special purpose vehicle (SPV) will be set up to hold the land.

 When VSNL was divested in 2002, this land was kept out of the entire process. The Tatas then picked up 25 per cent in the company, following which they made an open offer of 20 per cent to shareholders of VSNL. 

 The government continues to hold 26 per cent in VSNL. While the government continues to have its rights on the land, it will hold 51 per cent in this SPV. Close to 20 per cent will be held by those investors who had tendered their shares when the Tatas made the open offer and the remaining will vest with the existing non-promoter shareholders of VSNL.

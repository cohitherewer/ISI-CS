 Ceat bets on truck radials

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Calcutta, Dec. 3: Ceat Ltd is planning to set up a unit to manufacture radial tyres for trucks and buses.

 The RPG Enterprises-owned company has two plants at Nashik and Bhandup in Maharashtra making cross ply truck and bus tyres, car radials and OTR (off the road) tyres.

 Any new facility would typically have a capacity of 30,000-50,000 units and entail an investment of Rs 300-400 crore.

 However, the company is yet to take a decision, RPG Enterprise vice-chairman Sanjiv Goenka said.

 We are still evaluating the options, he told The Telegraph.

 Ceat has identified radial tyres as a key growth area as globally trucks and buses have shifted from cross ply to radial.

 Ceat is undergoing brownfield expansion at its two existing plants. However, the company will need a new location for the truck-bus radial.

 The management is expected to decide on the new unit within the next six months.

 Meanwhile, Ceat has undertaken expansion of car radial capacity from 40,000 units to 100,000.

 It is also expanding the capacity of cross ply truck tyres from 150,000 units to 170,000 a month. Moreover, it is tripling the production of high margin OTRs from 20 tonnes to 60 tonnes a month. 

 The brownfield expansion could cost about Rs 75-80 crore and the work for it has already started.

 Arnab Banerjee, vice-president (sales and marketing) of Ceat, said the company was expecting a better margin by changing product mix.

 We want to take up our EBIDTA margin to 10 per cent to finance the future expansion, he said.

 OTR, for instance, gives a better 

 margin than passenger or commercial vehicle tyres. OTR is 

 used especially in the infrastructure and mining sectors.

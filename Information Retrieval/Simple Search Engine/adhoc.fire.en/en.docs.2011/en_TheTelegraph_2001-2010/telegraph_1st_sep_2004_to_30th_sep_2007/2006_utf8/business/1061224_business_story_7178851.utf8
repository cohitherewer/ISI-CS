 News Corp, Liberty Media bury the hatchet

 Murdoch: Peace at last

 New York, Dec. 23 (Reuters): Media barons Rupert Murdoch and John Malone have ended a two-year battle, with Malones Liberty Media agreeing to swap a $11-billion stake in News Corp for control of satellite TV provider DirecTV and other assets. 

 The deal will secure Murdochs grip on News Corp, the global media empire he founded from a single newspaper in Australia. It also will mark the return of Malones Liberty Media as a major player in US television programming and distribution. 

 During 2006, we converted many passive investments into strategic operating businesses, but this transaction is the largest and most important, Liberty Media chief executive Greg Maffei said in a statement. 

 DirecTV and the regional sports networks represent a critical step in our efforts to transform Liberty Media into a well-positioned, focussed operating company, he said. 

 News Corp, owner of the 20th Century Fox movie studios and MySpace, one of the fastest-growing Web sites, said it will exchange its 38.4 per cent stake in DirecTV Group Inc, $550 million in cash, and three regional sports networks for Liberty Medias 16.3 per cent stake in News Corp. 

 The swap, which the companies expect to close in the second half of 2007, amounts to a $11-billion stock buyback for News Corp, considered one of the biggest in corporate history, UBS analyst Aryeh Bourkoff said. 

 Its a great deal for News Corp and Liberty given its a tax efficient resolution of the ownership structure, he said. 

 The deal ends two years of negotiations between long-time associates and rivals Murdoch and Malone, who once helped rescue the News Corp chief from near bankruptcy. 

 Malone had quietly snapped up close to a 20 per cent voting stake in News Corp in 2004, a move that spooked Murdoch, who enacted an emergency poison pill provision to block a potential hostile takeover within days of Liberty Medias disclosure. 

 The Friday deal should remove the threat of Malone from News Corp, but in giving up the top US satellite TV operator, Murdoch also loses a hard-won position atop the US media distribution business. His $58-billion company controls newspapers and satellite TV holdings in Italy, the United Kingdom and Asia.

 Calcutta, Feb. 20: A delegation from the Pakistan Tea Association (PTA) is likely to visit India during the end of March or early April. They will explore business opportunities in Calcutta and south India.

 The delegation will comprise 8-10 members. The last time a PTA team visited India was in 2004.

 The PTA has already sent a letter to the Indian High Commission seeking assistance for visa formalities of the PTA delegates in view of Pakistans increased tea imports from India, said Gautam Bhalla, executive director of Warren Tea and chairman of Indian Tea Associations (ITA) export sub-committee.

 Last year, Pakistan imported close to 9.5 million kg of Indian tea, which comprises 7 per cent of the countrys imports of 130 million kg.

 Speaking to The Telegraph from Karachi, Sahim Khan, manager (tea division) of Tapal Tea, one of the largest organised tea buyers in Pakistan, said the time is ripe for Indian tea, especially north Indian tea, to make in-roads into Pakistan.

 We have heard of a possible trip to India and would definitely send a representative as part of the delegation, Khan said.

 It takes about four weeks for the visa formalities to be completed, Khan added.

 The ideal time for the delegation, which would first come to Calcutta and then move on to south India, would be the end of March or early April when buyers would be able to sample the first flush, Bhalla said.

 About 75 to 80 per cent, which is nearly 85-90 million kg by volume, of Pakistans CTC tea is imported from Kenya, which is currently experiencing drought conditions resulting in prices sky-rocketing on a weekly basis, Khan said.

 Pakistan has traditionally sourced tea from south India because of steep prices of the north Indian tea. Only organised players like Tapal and Unilever Pakistan ? major packet tea buyers ? sourced quite an insignificant percentage from India.

 The loose tea or the wholesale market in Pakistan cannot afford the prices that north Indian tea commands, which is slightly above the international rates, Khan said.

 Pakistan requires a constant supply of tea and is heavily dependent on imports, mainly from Kenya. Indian tea, with its seasonal nature, lags behind in exports. Pakistans per capita tea consumption is among the highest in Asia. 

 In India, the production in May is particularly good and of a very high quality but after that, there are risks of the quality declining with increased domestic consumption dictating prices, said Khan.

 According to Khan, north Indian tea export could rise significantly this year as there has been a tremendous price escalation in Kenya.

 There are certain constraints in the procurement process, including comparison of samples and the time taken to bring the shipment to Pakistan privately. For instance, it takes three to four weeks for Tapal to ship tea from Mombasa to Karachi, Khan said.

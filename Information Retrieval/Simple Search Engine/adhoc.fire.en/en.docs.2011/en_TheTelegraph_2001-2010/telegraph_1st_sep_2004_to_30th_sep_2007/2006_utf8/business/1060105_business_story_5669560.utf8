 Supply sweeteners soon

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 4: The government will release some 3.65 million tonnes of sugar in the January-March quarter to keep its market price in check during the wedding season. 

 India had a bad sugar harvest in 2004-05. But it improved a lot in 2005-06. However, sugar price in the wholesale market has risen more than 58 per cent from around Rs 1,200 a quintal two years ago to nearly Rs 1,900 a quintal now. 

 According to market sources, the price of the politically sensitive commodity ruled at about Rs 1,600 a quintal even in August last. 

 The government not only sells sugar to poor families through a nation-wide chain of ration shops, it also controls the buffer stock of the commodity which it releases in the open market at times to keep prices in check. 

 We have drawn up this increased release programme to rein in on prices, officials in the agriculture ministry said. 

 The sugar industry expects that the output of the commodity in the current fiscal will cross 18 million tonnes thanks to a good harvest of sugarcane, but this is still lower than the 20 mt produced in 2003-04. 

 The increase in sugar price is being seen with great concern ahead of state assembly elections, due in the first three months of the new calendar year. Any further increases in prices could turn into a political issue, said sugar industry experts. 

 Earlier, elections have been lost and won many a times on the issue of onion and sugar prices going up. In 1998, the BJP lost the Delhi state assembly elections on the issue of spiralling onion prices.

 For the ruling coalition, the price increase represents both an opportunity as well as a danger, said top officials in the ministry. 

 Cane farmers in the northern states were very angry with the NDA and the Samajwadi party for not being able to get the sugar mills to release payment arrears due to them. Several bailout packages announced earlier for the sugar sector were of little help because not much money flowed to the farmers.

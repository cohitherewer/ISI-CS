 Govt move to tone up ONGC money muscle

 S.P.S PANNU AMP; JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 New Delhi, Aug 10: The finance ministry has granted ONGC-Videsh (OVL) the freedom to make investments up to Rs 1,000 crore on its own, to enable the company to quickly seize business opportunities in a booming oil market.

 Government approval is necessary only for investments of more than Rs 2,000 crore, while permission from the committee of secretaries is sufficient for investments between Rs 1,000 crore and Rs 2,000 crore. The proposal will soon be tabled before the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs.

 At a later stage, the OVL board will be empowered to independently make investments up to Rs 2,000 crore, while the committee of secretaries will get the mandate on investments between Rs 2,000 crore and Rs 4,000 crore.

 OVL now has the freedom to make investments up to Rs 300 crore, a piffling sum given the sharp increase in the value of overseas assets due to skyrocketing oil prices.

 The limited freedom has put OVL on a weak wicket vis--vis its rivals, especially the Chinese companies, which are very quick on the take in a competitive asset market that is working on increasingly thin acquisition deadlines.

 The Centre also plans to refashion its policy on credit lines and aid to governments to help OVL and other Indian oil companies buy assets. 

 The process has already started in Nigeria, where OVL has made an acquisition and is expected to take up projects such as developing the railways. 

 Similarly, Ecuador is another oil-rich country that wants to throw open its doors to public sector oil companies of other countries with the broader objective to promote economic development.

 Given the politics of oil, OVL requires the backing of the government to clinch deals. The government feels the OVL bids can be spiced up with aid to pick up assets in Africa and Latin America.

 OVL is now Indias largest transnational company with 21 properties in 12 countries. As many as 10 of these acquisitions were made in 2005-06.

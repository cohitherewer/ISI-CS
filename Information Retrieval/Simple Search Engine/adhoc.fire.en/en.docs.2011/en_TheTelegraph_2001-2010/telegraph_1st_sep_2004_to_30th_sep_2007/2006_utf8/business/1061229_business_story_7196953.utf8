 Essar, Vodafone table bids

 London, Dec. 28 (PTI): Triggering a bid war for Hutchison-Essar, which is being valued at up to $18 billion, Essar and UK-based Vodafone have made their offers to acquire Hutchison Telecom Internationals (HTIL) stake in the venture.

 After the visit of top brasses of both companies Essar vice-chairman Ravi Ruia and Vodafone CEO Arun Sarin British media reported, quoting unnamed sources, that the two suitors have made their respective offers.

 Essar, the joint venture partner in Hutch-Essar with a 33 per cent stake, has offered $11 billion (about Rs 50,000 crore) for HTILs 67 per cent stake, putting the enterprise value of the JV at $16.5 billion.

 However, Vodafone has submitted an offer valuing the company at $17-18 billion, the Financial Times reported.

 No comments were available from Vodafone, Essar and HTIL.

 HTILs parent Hutchison Whampoas finance director Frank Sixt has said the group would not entertain any offer below $14 billion. This was interpreted as the valuation of HTILs 67 per cent stake, thus pegging the enterprise value of the JV at $21 billion.

 Meanwhile, Bharti, in which Vodafone has a 10 per cent stake, was yet to get a final word from the UK-based operator on its plans to buy out the Hutch stake. We have not heard from Vodafone on their final position on Hutch-Essar, a Bharti spokesperson said.

 Speculation is rife that after Vodafone acquires Hutchison Telecoms stake, it would exit Bharti by paying a premium.

 Shares of HTIL rose for the second consecutive day today, taking the Hong Kong stock market to a new peak above 20000 points. The stock surged 1.1 per cent to close at HK$18.94. Vodafones shares were trading 0.7 per cent or 1 pence down at 142 pence a share on LSE.

 FM not surprised

 New Delhi, July 25: The price scourge was terrifying enough for the government to seek a rate hike from the RBI. North Block has been pushing for a cheap credit regime for some time but earlier this month at a meeting with the RBI brass it suggested raising the rates.

 The RBI did increase the reverse repo rate ? the rate at which it borrows overnight from other banks ? by a quarter percentage point to 6 per cent.

 Finance minister P. Chidambaram, who favoured easy loan availability for industry and the construction sector, today said, The whole exercise (higher bank rate) is to contain inflation ... I am not surprised at this increase.

 The government had so far managed to keep the bank rate low to ensure cheap credit to industry. With industry and services growing by 9-10 per cent, the focus is on inflation, which is around 5 per cent now. 

 The Indian economy, like others in Asia, have been ravaged by inflation that has been stoked by the runaway rise in oil prices. 

 Inflationary pressure and a steep increase in the demand for dollars from oil importers have devalued the rupee by Rs 2 a dollar in recent months. 

 The government hopes the rise in reverse repo rate will drain out the surplus cash from the banking system and cool down prices. The government feels prices will come down as less money is available to chase goods in short supply.

 It was worrying ... the inflation rate has been going up too fast. We know that in another 15-20 days, food prices will come down but petrol is something we cant control, said top North Block officials. 

 Petrol prices again crossed the $75-a-barrel-mark today in global markets. The government subsidises the difference between global and domestic oil prices with oil bonds. 

 However, if the government allows PSU oil firms to raise petrol and diesel prices in tandem with global price hikes, the inflation rate will shoot up further.

 North Block also feels the rate hike will give banks the cushion to raise deposit rates. 

 With the rate of growth of credit far surpassing the rate at which money is parked with banks, the banking system is fearing a cash crunch.

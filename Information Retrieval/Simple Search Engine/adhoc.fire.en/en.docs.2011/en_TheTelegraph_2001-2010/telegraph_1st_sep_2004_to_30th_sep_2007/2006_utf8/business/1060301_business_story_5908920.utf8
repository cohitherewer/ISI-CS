 Synthetic textiles to become cheaper

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Feb. 28: Synthetic textiles are set to become cheaper as finance minister P. Chidambaram has lowered the excise duties on man-made fibres and filament yarns to 8 per cent from 16 per cent in the Union Budget for 2006-07.

 Chidambaram has reduced the import duties on man-made fibres and yarns from 15 per cent to 10 per cent. Moreover, custom duties on intermediates used to make fibres have been lowered. 

 Import duties on raw materials such as di-methyl terephthalte, purified terephthalic acid and mono ethylene glycol have also been reduced from 15 per cent to 10 per cent. Import duty on yet another raw material will also be brought down to 2 per cent.

 Industry circles said the net impact of all these moves would be fabrics made from man-made materials such as polyester yarn would now be cheaper. The decision to bring down import duties on many raw materials is expected to keep prices of synthetic fibre and yarn under check.

 Though consumers using synthetic yarn and fibre are rejoicing, analysts said Chidambarams proposals would not have pleased RIL as import duties on its products (PTA, MEG and paraxylene) have been brought down.

 Chidambaram had earlier granted significant relief to the cotton textile industry. Announcing the 2005-06 budget proposals, the finance minister said while the cotton textile industry has benefited from the relief granted two years ago, the man-made textile industry is also a growth and employment-driver and it deserves encouragement.

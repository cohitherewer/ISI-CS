 Man profit likely to beat forecast

 London, March 31 (Reuters): Man Group, the worlds largest listed hedge fund firm, expects profits before tax and performance fees for last year to be better than market expectations. 

 At 8.15 am, Mans stock was up nearly 3.5 per cent at ?24.90. 

 Analysts expect profit before tax and exceptional items in the year ending March 31 to jump to around $1.2 billion from around $860 million last year. The consensus forecast for performance fees is for a number above $420 million, reflecting the strong performance of Mans flagship AHL fund, compared with $119 million a year ago. 

 Very strong figures; better then they had led the market to expect ... expect the stock to be strong today, a trader said. 

 Man also said its most recent product launch, Man IP 220, will raise about $2 billion, above analysts forecasts of more than $1 billion. 

 The first phase of the launch closed in early March, raising $0.9 billion and is included in the sales and funds under management figures for the year to end March. 

 Sales for the year are estimated at $9 billion, with 58 percent of that coming from private investors and 42 per cent from institutional products. For the three months to end-March, sales are estimated at $3.4 billion. 

 Funds under management are currently estimated at more than $48 billion.

 Former HP chief surrenders

 Dunn: Taking a stand

 San Jose, Oct. 6 (Reuters): Former Hewlett-Packard Co chairman Patricia Dunn surrendered at a Silicon Valley courthouse on Thursday afternoon on felony charges for spying on reporters and company directors.

 Superior Court judge Alfonso Fernandez released Dunn, who is due to start treatment for ovarian cancer on Friday, on her own recognisance after a three-minute hearing.

 Dunn sat quietly in the courtroom after arriving about 20 minutes early, speaking a single word, Yes, when asked if she agreed to return for arraignment on November 17. Her surrender and appearance in front of the judge is the latest development in a boardroom leak scandal that has tarnished the reputation of a company that has previously championed privacy and aspired to a code that its founders called the HP Way.

 In HPs probes, investigators impersonated company board members, employees and journalists to get their private telephone records.

 Dunn, who resigned last month and appeared last week before the Congress to testify about the investigation, has said she regrets the way the probe was handled, but does not accept personal responsibility for any deceptive tactics used.

 California Attorney General Bill Lockyer filed charges on Wednesday against Dunn and four other defendants because of tactics used in HPs effort in 2005 and 2006 to find the source of leaks to the media.

 Dunn, repeating a portion of her congressional testimony, told the 60 Minutes news magazine television show in an interview to be broadcast on Sunday that to think other companies do not pursue investigations would be unwise. If you think that Hewlett-Packard is the only company that has an investigations force, youre being naive, she said in the interview. Every company has investigations. Investigations by their nature are intrusive.

 According to Dunns attorney, Jim Brosnahan, these charges are being brought against the wrong person at the wrong time and for the wrong reasons and they were false.

 They are the culmination of a well-financed and highly orchestrated disinformation campaign, he said. 

 All five defendants named face four felony charges: conspiracy; fraudulent use of wire, radio or television transmissions; taking, copying and using computer data; and using personal identifying information without authorisation. Each count could bring a maximum of three years in prison. 

 Also charged are former HP ethics officer Kevin Hunsaker and investigators Bryan Wagner, Ronald Delia and Matthew DePante of information supplier Action Research Group.

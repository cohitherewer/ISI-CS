 New Delhi, Oct. 31: Nokia Corporation today bagged a Rs 1,840-crore ($400 million) contract to expand the digital networks of Bharti Airtel. 

 The three-year contract relates to expanding Bhartis GSM, GPRS, and EDGE networks in eight telecom circles, including Mumbai, Maharashtra, Goa and Gujarat, and deploying a wireless application protocol system (WAP) across the country.

 Our network leadership across India is a critical driver in the Bharti Airtel success story. Our partnership with Nokia reinforces our commitment to this cause, said Manoj Kohli, president, Bharti Airtel.

 Bharti, which operates in all the 23 telecom circles in the country, has a subscriber base of 22.5 crore.

 As specified in the contract, Nokia will monitor Bhartis network from its Chennai facility. The company will also deploy its WAP solutions across Airtels national network to enhance Airtels mobile packet core network capabilities. 

 The WAP gateway will ensure easy use of data services, increasing the consumption of content on the Airtel network. Nokia will also provide consulting services and integrate the WAP gateway into a multi-vendor environment.

 The contract also has stringent service level agreements and performance parameters for both the parties, which are designed to provide quality service to subscribers.

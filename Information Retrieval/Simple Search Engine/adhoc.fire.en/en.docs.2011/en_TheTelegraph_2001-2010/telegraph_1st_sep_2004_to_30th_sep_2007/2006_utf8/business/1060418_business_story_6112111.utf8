The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Legal trap in LSE buyout bid

 Tie-up trouble

 London, April 17 (Reuters): Legal advice given to a potential bidder for the London Stock Exchange warns of a regulatory tangle lasting years if LSE shareholders accept a takeover by a US bourse, the Financial Mail on Sunday reported.

 The newspaper said a document discusses how the LSE would face extra costs from a tie-up, but did not name the potential bidder.

 Last week, Nasdaq Stock Market snapped up almost 15 per cent of the LSE after a takeover offer of $4.2 billion (?2.4 billion) by the US company had been rebuffed.

 The Business newspaper said on Sunday Asian stock markets were interested in building up stakes in the LSE.

 Quoting sources, the newspaper said that exchanges in Asia, including those in South Korea, Taiwan, China and India, were looking to follow Nasdaqs move to buy shares in the LSE.

 The LSE has already attracted interest elsewhere.

 The New York Stock Exchange has said it is in talks on a strategic transaction, and a source familiar with the situation told Reuters on Saturday the LSE was one of the parties to the discussions.

 Some analysts have said the Big Board might also target either Amsterdam-based Euronext or Germanys Deutsche Boerse AG, the two other big European markets.

 The 300-year-old LSE, which has been wooed by suitors as varied as Australias Macquarie Bank and Deutsche Boerse, said this week it was considering talks on tie-ups with other exchanges but could thrive on its own. 

 The London Stock Exchange expects to win at least 20 Chinese listings in 2006, as Europes biggest bourse takes aim at the growing field of young Chinese entrepreneurial firms looking to raise capital.

 A team of LSE officials is co-ordinating with Chinese regulators to encourage more qualified Chinese companies to go for London listings this year, said Jane Zhu, the bourses top Asia-Pacific executive.

 At the same time, the exchange also wants to attract more privately-owned Chinese firms to its Alternative Investment Market (AIM), a second-tier board aimed at smaller but fast-growing companies. 

 quot;For China, we are targeting two types - big-sized state-owned firms, like Air China, and small but (high) potential privately-owned companies, quot; Zhu said in a recent roundtable interview in Shanghai, Chinas financial hub.

 Air China Ltd, the countrys biggest airline, listed its shares in Hong Kong and London in a $1.2-billion IPO in December 2004. 

 quot;We expect at least 20 Chinese firms to go for listing on our AIM this year, quot; said Zhu, adding that 16 Chinese firms launched initial public offerings on AIM in 2005. quot;On average, an AIM IPO can raise $10 million. quot; 

 The LSE wants to take business from its transatlantic rivals, the New York Stock Exchange and the tech-oriented Nasdaq.

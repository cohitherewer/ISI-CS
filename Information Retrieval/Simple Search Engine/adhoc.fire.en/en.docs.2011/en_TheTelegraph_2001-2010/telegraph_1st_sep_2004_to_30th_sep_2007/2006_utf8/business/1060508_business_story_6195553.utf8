 Calcutta, May 7: Godrej Consumer Products Ltd, with a capital expenditure kitty of Rs 110 crore, will set up two factories ? one for soap at Baddi in Himachal Pradesh and another for personal care products in Sikkim.

 Godrej Consumer Products (GCPL) also plans to upgrade one of its existing factories and is scouting around for more acquisitions in Southeast Asia, Far East, West Asia and Latin America.

 The soap factory at Baddi will have a capacity of 50,000 tonnes per annum.

 The plant in Sikkim will deal with personal care products like hair colour. We will also upgrade the plant in Malanpur, said Hoshedar K. Press, executive director and president of GCPL.

 GCPL has already acquired UKs Keyline Brands Limited, which manufactures, markets and distributes the Keyline brand portfolio.

 We are a cash-rich company and therefore financing is not a problem. The acquisition should create a complete synergy with our existing business like Keyline Brands. Our definition of possible markets is one characterised by the presence of black hair in the population, Press said.

 The company is also planning to bring mens grooming products like Erasmic from the Keyline stable that used to be available in the country years ago.

 Innovation is the key to all our product developments starting from launching the first fairness soap, Godrej FairGlow, to the first anti ageing soap, Evita. We are looking at launching these two products besides the powder hair-dye sachets in markets like the UK as early as possible, where we could utilise Keylines distribution channels, Press said.

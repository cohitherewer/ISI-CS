 Import balm to nurse price scar

 New Delhi, Sept. 1: The government today listed some firefighting measures to check the untrammelled price rise of essential commodities. It will ensure higher supply of wheat, sugar and pulses through imports at reduced rates of duty and will ban export of pulses and sugar. 

 Secretary consumer affairs Labyendu Mansingh said 10 ships are on their way with a consignment of 5.25 lakh tonnes of wheat. Of these, seven are expected to arrive in India by the end of this month, he added.

 In addition, shipments of 37,000 tonnes of urad and 12,300 tonnes of moong dal were expected to arrive next week from Myanmar through nodal agency Nafed, Mansingh said.

 Consumers have been scalded by the rising prices of items of essential consumption such as wheat, sugar and pulses, due to domestic shortages and hardening of international prices. 

 Mansingh said the government has imposed fresh restrictions on the movement of essential commodities and on stocks with traders. This was done through a order that kept in abeyance an earlier directive easing movement of food items covered by the essential commodities act. 

 The order, valid for six months, will not apply on movement of commodities from surplus to deficit states and on imports.

 Mansingh said two ships with 92,000 tonnes of wheat had arrived in April and May, while six ships had dropped their consignments at the end of last month. Besides, two ships had docked at Visakhapatnam and Chennai with 80,000 tonnes of wheat.

 In the meantime, the Centre is advising states to ensure availability at reasonable prices.

 Inflation rate 

 The inflation rate for the week ended August 19 is 4.91 per cent compared with 4.92 per cent the week before. Edible oils were cheaper and industrial fuel prices were down marginally. 

 However, prices were higher for mass consumables such as vegetables, fruit, wheat, bread and buns, vanaspati, coconut oil, spices, bajra and maize.

 The wholesale price index for all commodities rose by 0.2 per cent to 205.1 points from 195.5 points a year ago. The annual inflation rate was 3.71 per cent in the corresponding week last year.

 Tatas sound Cairn on oil alliance

 CHANDRALEKHA TULAL AND SAMBIT SAHA 

 Open offer

 Mumbai/Calcutta, Aug. 14: Tata Petrodyne is likely to form a consortium with Cairn Energy to bid for oil and gas exploration blocks under the sixth round of the new exploration licensing policy (Nelp-VI).

 The wholly-owned subsidiary of Tata Sons, which is engaged in the exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas, will look after the groups business in the oil and gas sector.

 Since the company had limited exposure in the sector, it held talks with various domestic and global oil players to partner in the bid.

 According to sources, the company has finally identified Cairn Energy, who is the operator of CB-OS/2 block, one of the three blocks Tata Petrodyne has interests in. 

 The Tatas will not hold more than 30 per cent in the consortium, though the final details are still being worked out, the source said. 

 However, when contacted, V.K. Sharma, executive director of Tata Petrodyne, said, We are yet to finalise our partners and are currently conducting technical evaluations.

 We have not yet decided on the number of blocks we plan to bid for and it will depend on our assessment and reserve capacity. 

 Nelp-VI will offer 55 blocks, including 25 onshore, six shallow water and 24 deepwater.

 The government had also made a simultaneous offer of 10 blocks under the third round of the coal-bed methane policy (CBM-III) for exploration and production of coal-bed methane, the bids for which closed on June 30. 

 Cairn Energy has neither denied nor confirmed the development. David Nisbet, director of Cairn Energy Plc, said: All I can say is that Cairn is participating in NelpVI. We will not comment on market speculation. The name(s) of our partner will be known only after September 15.

 At present, Cairn is the operator of the Ravva oilfield on the eastern offshore and it has developed the Lakshmi gas field in western India. The company has so far committed more than $2 billion investment in Rajasthan. The company hopes to produce 200,000 barrels per day oil by 2010.

 More plans

 Apart from bidding for the domestic oil exploration licence, Tata Petrodyne is keen to acquire other assets both at home and abroad. 

 Tata Sons brought the company back into its fold in line with the groups strategic focus to become a major player in the oil and gas business.

 Tata Petrodyne, incorporated in 

 1993, was initially promoted by Tata Industries with the 

 objective of spearheading the groups foray into the upstream 

 segment of the oil and gas industry.

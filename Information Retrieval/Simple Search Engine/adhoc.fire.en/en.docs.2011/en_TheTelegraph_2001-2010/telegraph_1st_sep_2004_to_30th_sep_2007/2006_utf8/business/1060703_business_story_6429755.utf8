 Twin props for market surge

 Last week we had two items of information that were, on the face of it, good news for the markets. 

 First, of course, was the language of the US Fed rate hike. Analysts were mostly of the view that while caution was needed, the language of the Fed communiqu? was milder than Bernanke?s earlier pronouncements. That?s why markets across the world rallied, on the hope that the Fed may pause after its latest rate hike. The sensex?s rebound on Friday is part and parcel of that optimistic interpretation of Fed policy.

 But what did the Fed really say? Here?s the crucial bit: ?The extent and timing of any additional firming that may be needed to address these risks will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.? In other words, the Fed will adjust its course of action based on the data. The consensus seems to be that the Fed would like to pause, if the data allows it to.

 Does that mean liquidity will flood back into global markets? Even if the Fed may have reached near the end of its tightening cycle, that?s not true of other central banks. Investors are now pricing in rate increases of 75 basis points by the European central bank by the end of the year, thanks to solid growth in Europe. And everyone knows that the Bank of Japan is all set to abandon its zero rate policy for overnight money. 

 So even if the Fed stops raising rates, tightening will continue elsewhere, which will impact global liquidity, which is what our stock markets are so dependent on.

 But it?s not as simple as that. Japanese money supply, for instance, has increased sharply in the last few weeks, re-supplying much-needed liquidity. Somebody must have decided that the tightening had been too abrupt and something needed to be done to soothe the markets. At the same time, the tightening is far from over and the current bout of optimism could be short-lived.

 The other piece of good news is India-specific and is about the unexpected current account surplus of $1.8 billion in the January to March quarter. Compared with the previous quarter?s deficit of $3.8 billion, it?s a pleasant surprise. Analysts had pointed out that a widening current account deficit sucks out liquidity, which would add to the distress caused by dwindling FII inflows. That fear has been laid to rest.

 What caused the turnaround? Compared with the previous quarter, the trade deficit was lower by $356 million while net invisibles were higher by $5.2 billion, so it?s mostly software exports, remittances and much lower net outflow of investment income that was responsible for the turnaround.

 Is it sustainable? Trade data for April-May show the merchandise deficit growing by 12 per cent on a year-on-year basis. That?s lower than the 13.3 per cent year-on-year rate during January-March 2006. Non-oil imports grew at 19 per cent in April-May, which shows that there?s no sign of a decelerating economy. Nor is the January-March quarter particularly seasonal when it comes to remittances or software exports. 

 Clearly, India?s current account balance is far more robust than hitherto believed. That should imply less pressure on the rupee, more liquidity and more support for the India story.

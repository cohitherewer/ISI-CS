 IOC to step up on gas outletspumped up

 S.P.S. PANNU 

 New Delhi, July 30: Indian Oil Corporation plans to increase the number of its auto LPG dispensing retail outlets from 80 filling stations to 200 as carmakers such as Maruti go in for LPG-run vehicles.

 Senior officials told The Telegraph that the equipment for setting up an LPG dispensing facility costs around Rs 50 lakh and these units have been set up at retail outlets which are already selling petrol and diesel in order to reduce costs.

 Since the commercial viability of these filling stations is of utmost consideration, the expansion is taking place in phases. While 55 new filling stations will soon be commissioned, the rest will follow depending on the increase in demand.

 There are around 150 auto LPG retail outlets across the country with Hindustan Petroleum and Bharat Petroleum having set up about 35 each. Most of these are located in the metros and big cities. 

 There are about 17 auto LPG filling stations in Calcutta, while Delhi and Mumbai have 27 each. The gas seems to be more popular as an auto fuel in the southern cities with Bangalore boasting of 36 retail outlets, Chennai 32 and Hyderabad 15. There are about 10 filling stations in Pune. 

 The gas is about 30 per cent cheaper than petrol as a car fuel. It also has the advantage of being more eco-friendly as vehicular emissions are lower.

 However, customers have to put up with the disadvantage of having no LPG dispensing stations on the highways and they have to go to select outlets to get their fills even in the cities.

 Oil company officials believe some outlets should be set up on highways as well if LPG has to become more popular.

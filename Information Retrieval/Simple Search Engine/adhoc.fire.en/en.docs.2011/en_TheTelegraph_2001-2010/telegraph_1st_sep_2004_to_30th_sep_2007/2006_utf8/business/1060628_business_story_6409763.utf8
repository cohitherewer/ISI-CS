 Ore exports to Japan, Korea cut

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 27: Iron ore exports to Japan and South Korea have been scaled down to a maximum of 6.78 million tonnes per year in the fresh agreements signed with these countries for 2006-11.

 The quantity for this fiscal has been fixed at 3.5 million tonnes, which is about 50 per cent lower than that in the previous year.

 The new long-term agreements with Japan and South Korea have been signed. Iron ore exports to these two countries during 2006-11 would be in the range of 2.70 million tonnes to 6.78 million tonnes, Christy Fernandez, additional secretary in the ministry of commerce, said.

 The previous agreement ended on March 31. The permissible quantity of exports during 2001-06 was in the band of 9.6 million tonnes to 16.5 million tonnes per year.

 However, this included exports to China by the National Mineral Development Corporation. The new agreements provide for exports by NMDC to Japan and Korea only and Chinas requirements will now be handled by trading firm MMTC. A separate agreement for this will be drawn up next month in Beijing.

 NMDC primarily sells high-grade ore with iron content of more than 65 per cent from its Bailadila mines in Chhattisgarh and Donimalai mines in Karnataka. Exports have been scaled down in view of the rising demand of ore for new steel projects.

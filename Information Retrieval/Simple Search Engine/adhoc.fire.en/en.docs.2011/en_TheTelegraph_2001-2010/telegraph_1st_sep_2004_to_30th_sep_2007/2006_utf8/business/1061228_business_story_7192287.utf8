 IOC to upgrade outlets

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Daga: Moving ahead

 Calcutta, Dec. 27: Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) has stepped on the gas to automate its retail outlets in large scale, to maintain its leading position in the domestic market. 

 The company has placed orders for automating over 900 outlets. It has 80 such outlets.

 The automation not only creates better customer relationship management, but also ensures transparency to the consumer.

 It brings down the human interface in fuel refilling. The bill to the customer will have transaction details such as sales person, time of delivery and even the nozzle.

 The process will be useful to those car owners who depend on others to refill cars.

 We plan to automate all those retail outlets selling more than 200 kilo litre per month, G C Daga, director (marketing) of IOC, said.

 IOC with 15,000 outlets is the largest retailer in the country.

 Daga said that the company plans to automate 1,000 outlets after the first phase. 

 The cost to IOC on automation is Rs 20 lakh a pump.

 The target is to automate 2000 outlets by the end of next fiscal that would involve an investment of Rs 400 crore.

 The technology is being sourced from global majors such as Rosemann of the US, Hectronic of Germany and CMC of India.

 Auto LPG

 IOC also plans to increase the number of auto-LPG dispensation pumps to 200 from 86.

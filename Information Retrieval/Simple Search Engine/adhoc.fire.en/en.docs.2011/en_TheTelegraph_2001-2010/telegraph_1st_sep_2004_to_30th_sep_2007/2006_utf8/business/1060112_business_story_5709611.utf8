 Calcutta, Jan. 11: Andhra Bank will focus on increasing the volume of business as it feels it is difficult to sustain a high net interest margin in future. This is because the spread between deposit and lending rates is becoming narrower.

 Net interest margin is going to come down in the coming years and therefore, we have decided to focus on increasing the volume of business. For this, we will reach out both within and outside India, said Andhra Banks general manager V.R. Venkataraman at a roadshow organised in the city for the banks follow-on public issue.

 The bank has 16 branches in Bengal and will open three more before March. It will also set up a representative office in Dubai for which approvals from the host country and the Reserve Bank of India have come.

 Andhra Bank is coming out with its second public issue offering 8.5 crore shares, constituting 17.53 per cent of the banks post-issue paid-up equity capital. Following the public offer, the governments share in the bank will come down to 51.55 per cent from 62.50 per cent.

 The price band for the 100 per cent book built issue will be determined on January 13. However, the upper price band is unlikely to be set at more than 5 per cent discount to the current market price of Rs 103, according to merchant bankers.

 Andhra Bank did not put up a good performance for the half-year ended September 30 ? the earnings during the March-September period in 2005 fell to Rs 203.50 crore from Rs 294.58 crore in the preceding six months.

 This was because we suffered investment losses, said Venkataraman, adding that the bank has already provided Rs 158 crore as depreciation of investment in addition to what had been provided earlier.

 Besides, the transfer of investment to the held-to-maturity category is also expected to bring down the amortisation level in the fourth quarter, he said.

 Meanwhile, Andhra Bank has been able to bring down its net non-performing assets to 0.26 per cent of gross advances following which it virtually didnt have to make provision for bad debts during the first half of the current fiscal. For the second half, too, the bank may not be required to make provisions for NPA.

 This means that a larger part of the banks operating profit will now be available for arriving at the net profit, which is expected to increase in the September 2005-March 2006 period.

 The bank is also focussing on increasing its fee-based income, which witnessed a significant increase during the first six months to Rs 80.15 crore from Rs 61.32 crore a year ago.

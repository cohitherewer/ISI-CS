 Barista brews growth potion

 Calcutta, May 28: After remaining flat for some time, the local coffee market has started posting a 4-5 per cent growth for the past couple of years. Cashing in on this growth curve, leading coffee chain Barista Coffee Co Ltd is all set to break even in the next three months.

 The company was haemorrhaging even in December 2005.

 While coffee prices are slated to increase within the range of 5-7 per cent shortly, Barista will not raise it beyond 5 per cent and it will do so gradually over the year.

 Studies on coffee consumption by the Coffee Board reveals that while tea as a beverage rules indoors, coffee is the preferred choice for lifestyle and outdoor consumption. While the board is promoting coffee and its antioxidant properties, we will be driving domestic consumption by introducing home brewing kits with a brewing machine and Barista beans in the next three months, Partha Dattagupta, chief executive officer of Barista Coffee, said on the sidelines of a retail seminar today.

 The profitability margins of such food and beverage chains are coming under pressure with the real estate boom. 

 The rent-to-revenue ratio has been adversely affected with property prices increasing by almost 30 per cent in the last six months, Dattagupta said. Its impact would be on the new properties.

 Barista hopes to tackle this by increasing efficiency in supply chains. It used to outsource its food, but now it will open a central kitchen in Delhi by July followed by another one in Mumbai.

 The installation of SAP retail across all stores is also expected to reduce costs by 3-4 per cent due to better inventory management. It already has a differential pricing varying between 7 and 10 per cent for smaller towns.

 Barista is planning to expand the franchisee model of operation, which has been implemented in three of its 140 outlets. It will be introducing the model in 10 more cities.

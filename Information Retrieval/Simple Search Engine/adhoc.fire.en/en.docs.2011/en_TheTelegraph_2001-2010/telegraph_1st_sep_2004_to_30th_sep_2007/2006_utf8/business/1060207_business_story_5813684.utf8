 Pipeline to choke Haldia cash flow

 S.P.S. PANNU 

 New Delhi, Feb. 6: With Indian Oil Corporations Rs 1200-crore Paradip-Haldia oil pipeline scheduled for completion in May, the revenue from Haldia port may shrink next fiscal as the crude oil traffic will be diverted to Paradip. IOC expects to formally commission the pipeline in June. 

 Senior IOC officials told The Telegraph that the pipeline was scheduled for completion in March, but it is delayed by two months as heavy rains during monsoon had made it impossible to carry out the work. However, work has resumed in full swing and it will be completed in May.

 Iranian offshore oil exploration company is laying the single-point mooring in the deep waters off the Paradip coast and the offshore portion of the pipeline as it is an expert on the job.

 The pipeline will enable IOC to save Rs 500 crore per year in transport costs and will boost the profitability of both Haldia and Barauni refineries.

 At present, crude comes in medium-sized ships to the mouth of the Hooghly river from where smaller vessels carry it to Haldia. This trans-shipment is a costly affair and has adversely impacted the operations of the Haldia refinery. 

 The lower cost of transporting crude will help IOC expand the capacity of the Haldia refinery from 4.6 million tonnes to 7.4 million tonnes. 

 In the long run, the increased output of the refinery will generate higher revenue for the state and more traffic for the port as well. This is expected to offset the revenue loss arising out of the withdrawal of smaller vessels.

 According to officials, the expansion of the refinery cannot take place under the current high-cost transport system at Haldia.

 Once the single-point mooring and the pipeline are put in place, IOC can hire very large crude carriers (VLCC) to import crude, which can be docked in the deep water off the Paradip coast. The cost of transporting crude in VLCCs is about half as much as smaller ships. 

 The 350-km pipeline is being laid underground utilising the latest horizontal-directional drilling technique to go beneath as many as 17 riverbeds and other water bodies. Laying the pipeline under the river is considered safe both from natural calamities like heavy floods and from terrorist attacks.

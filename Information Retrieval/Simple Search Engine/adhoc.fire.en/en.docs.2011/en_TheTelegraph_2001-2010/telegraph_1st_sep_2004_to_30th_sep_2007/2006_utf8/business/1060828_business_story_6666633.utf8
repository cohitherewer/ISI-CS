 City port gets nudge to tap real estate riches

 S.P.S. PANNU

 LAND-LOCKED

 New Delhi, Aug. 27: The shipping ministry wants Calcutta Port Trust to develop its prime real estate along commercial lines to generate funds for strengthening its infrastructure.

 Shipping secretary A.K. Mahapatra said the Calcutta port owns vast stretches of priceless real estate, which includes heritage buildings. These valuable assets are lying idle at the moment and there is tremendous scope for converting them into commercial space for which there is a huge demand in Calcutta.

 The ministry believes this would enable the port trust to increase its earnings, which could then be ploughed back to modernise the port and develop ancillary infrastructure.

 The railways has initiated the move to turn its huge real estate in big cities into commercial money-spinners, and the shipping ministry appears to be thinking on similar lines. 

 The ministry is expected to rope in large construction industry players for its projects. The proposal, however, is still in a preliminary stage and the details are being worked out. 

 The railways has hired real estate consultant Insignia Brooke to conduct a feasibility study on real estate development. It expects to generate Rs 130 crore in the current fiscal through utilisation of idle space. Around 50 railway stations have been identified for the push into property development. 

 The railways is planning to offer its equity in the form of land, while the private player, which could be a hotel chain or a bank, could take the land on lease and pay the railways a share. The railways proposal to set up budget hotels has been kicked off with over 60 hoteliers showing interest in five sites at Chandigarh, Sealdah, Vijayawada, Secunderabad and Madurai. 

 The eligibility criteria for bidders include owning and operating a hotel, with a minimum turnover of Rs 5 crore, for at least five years. 

 Those who bid for the build-operate-transfer arrangement of the hotels, are required to pay a mix of fixed and variable components in the form of revenue share each year to the IRCTC, the nodal agency for the process.

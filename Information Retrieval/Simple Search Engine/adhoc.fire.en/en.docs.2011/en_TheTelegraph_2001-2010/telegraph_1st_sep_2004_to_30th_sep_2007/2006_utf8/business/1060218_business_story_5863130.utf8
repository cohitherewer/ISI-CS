 AIG to acquire Taiwan insurer

 Hong Kong, Feb. 17 (Reuters): American International Group, the worlds largest insurer by market value, said on Friday it had agreed to buy Taiwans Central Insurance in a deal worth up to T$6.05 billion ($187 million) in stock.

 AIGs wholly owned Taiwan subsidiary, AIG Direct Marketing, will pay between T$5.92 billion to T$6.05 billion for Central Insurance, the countrys sixth-largest insurer.

 AIG, which has a long track record in Asia and is a big foreign player in markets like China and Thailand, said the addition of Central Insurance would make it the third largest general insurer in the market by direct gross premiums written.

 Polaris Securities, one of Central Insurances biggest shareholders, would work with AIG Direct Marketing to develop plans to sell Central Insurances products in Taiwan, the company said.

 Central Insurance has 40 business units in Taiwan and two representative offices in Guanzghou and Shanghai, quot; said the companys president, Charles Sung.

 Central Insurance shareholders will receive redeemable preferred shares of AIG Direct Marketing in exchange for each share of Central Insurance in a deal expected to close during the third quarter.

 Unichem buy

 Alliance UniChem Plc, the drug distributor that agreed last year to merge with Boots Group Plc said in London on Friday it had acquired a 96 per cent stake in Russias AP Apteka Holding Ltd.

 UniChem said it had paid around ?18 million ($31.2 million) for Russias fifth largest pharmaceutical wholesaler, with a network of 20 depots across the country, and assumed approximately ?10 million of net debt.

 The group said it estimated the Russian pharmaceutical wholesale market to be worth over ?3 billion and anticipated low double-digit percentage growth for the foreseeable future.

 Last week, The Office of Fair Trading said Boots Groups acquisition of UniChem could go ahead if the enlarged company agreed to sell up to 100 shops to address competition concerns.

 Shares in UniChem closed at 881 pence on Thursday, valuing the group at around 3.2 billion pounds. 

 Boots closed at 708 pence, valuing the group at around 3.4 billion pounds.

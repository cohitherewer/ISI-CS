 Bengal puts up high-voltage show

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 13: Bengal has emerged among the top five performers in the domestic power sector. Last year, it was ranked eighth.

 In Bengal, the gap between the average revenue realisation (ARR) and the average cost of supplying (ACS) each unit of electricity is higher only than that in Goa. The lower the gap, better is the commercial viability of a state electricity board.

 The latest study on state power utilities shows that Bengal has managed to reduce the gap between its ARR and ACS to 3 paise for the year ended December 31, 2005 from 30 paise in the previous year. Chhattisgarh comes next with a gap of 10 paise. Maharashtra, Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh follow with gaps of 23 paise, 30 paise and 40 paise respectively. 

 Delhi, with a gap of 58 paise, is clubbed with Punjab, Karnataka and Rajasthan where the difference between ARR and ACS is high.

 The study, carried out by rating agency Crisil, has been sponsored by the Union power ministry for a better insight into the performance of state power utilities that have been judged on nine parameters.

 Bengal has also scored well for substantially reducing its aggregate technical and commercial losses (AT amp;C) to 25 per cent from 33 per cent in the previous year. This has been attributed to comprehensive energy audit, strict implementation of anti-theft laws and vigorous collection efforts by the state electricity board. 

 The state has been commended for a relatively high proportion of sales on a metered basis compared with other states. Its power sector has generated a net cash profit for the year because of trading operations and reduced transmission and distribution losses. The study expects the profit position to improve further this year.

 On the negative side, the study highlights the poor capital structure of the state utilities reflected in the huge debt burden and negative networth. The low plant load factor of thermal plants and high manpower levels are cause for some concern although the productivity has improved. 

 The state electricity board has not got any subsidy from the government in the last four years. This is a positive factor that reflects the sustainability of the revenue model of the power sector.

 In contrast, subsidy from state governments is an area of concern for Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka, Rajasthan, Haryana, Punjab and Maharashtra.

 The Bengal government has also announced a subsidy of Rs 20 crore for the state electricity board as it has reduced the cost of power to farmers from Rs 1.65 per unit to Rs 1.25 per unit. However, this sum is considered too small to affect the fiscal health of the government.

 Despite the improved financial position, the Bengal power sector has been ranked fifth as far as the overall performance is concerned. 

 This is largely because the study has given a very low score to the state government for not implementing the reforms related to unbundling the board on functional lines and separating the power generation and transmission and distribution activities.

 SBI to keep 15% of IMD proceeds

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 5: The State Bank of India (SBI) today said it would retain about 15 per cent of the $7.3-billion India Millennium Deposits (IMD).

 We will retain 15 per cent of the IMD proceeds, which will be over Rs 4,000 crore, SBI chairman A.K. Purwar said after a meeting with finance minister P. Chidambaram.

 The $5.5-billion IMD, which was launched in 2000 by the SBI, raised hard currency deposits at a high interest rate of 8.5 per cent on deposits denominated in dollar, 7.85 per cent on pound sterling and 6.85 per cent on euro deposits. The deposits had a maturity period of five years. The redemption includes both the principal and interest accrued on the deposits.

 Several other banks, including ICICI Bank, IDBI Bank, Union Bank of India and Bank of Baroda, will tap a major portion of the IMD redemptions, which started on December 29. 

 Purwar, however, admitted that the redemptions have exerted an upward pressure on short-term interest rates, but added that the situation has eased. The overnight call money rates had increased to 7 per cent in December end ? higher by a significant margin than the benchmark repo rate of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), which is pegged at 5.25 per cent.

 The government has allayed fears about any liquidity problem after the redemption of the India Millennium Deposits as there was enough liquidity in the system backed by forex reserves of nearly $145 billion.

 The government will also go ahead with the scheduled market borrowing programme. It is expected to borrow Rs 58,000 crore in the second half of the current fiscal, of which Rs 10,000 crore will be raised in January alone.

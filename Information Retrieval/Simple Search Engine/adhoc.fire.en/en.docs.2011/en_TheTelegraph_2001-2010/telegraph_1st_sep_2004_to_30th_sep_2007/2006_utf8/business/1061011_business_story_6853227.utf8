 Calcutta, Oct. 10: UTI Bank today entered into a pact with the National Small Industries Corporation (NSIC) to spruce up its loan portfolio for small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Under the agreement, NSIC will forward the credit proposals of micro, small and medium enterprises to UTI Bank.

 We will sanction loans after appraising the proposals, said S.K. Mitra, senior vice-president, eastern zonal office, UTI Bank. However, we will be able to reach out to a greater number of small and medium units through our tie-up with NSIC, he added.

 NSIC has launched a scheme to facilitate sanction of term loans as well as working capital by commercial banks to SMEs by preparing their loan proposals, performance and credit rating and other documentation. Any small-scale industry can avail of this facility from NSIC free of cost, said S.K. Sinha, director (planning and marketing), NSIC.

 However, NSIC charges a fee for performance and credit rating and the amount depends on the annual turnover of the small-scale unit. This fee is subsidised up to 75 per cent by the central government and a small-scale unit with a higher credit and performance rating can also avail of a lower interest rate than its non-rated or low-rate peers.

 So far, about 200 SMEs in Bengal, Jharkhand and Orissa have got themselves rated, said P.N. Tripathi, adviser to zonal head, eastern zone, NSIC.

 NSIC has similar arrangements for mobilising loan proposals of small-scale units with United Bank of India, Uco Bank, Oriental Bank of Commerce, Bank of Maharashtra, Yes Bank and Central Bank of India.

 While a number of public sector banks are offering a lower rate for small-scale units with high credit and performance ratings, UTI Bank is not offering any such preferential rate as of now. Our SME lending portfolio is very young. We may offer preferential rates for better-managed units in future, Mitra said. The bank currently offers loans to SMEs at a sub-PLR rate varying between 9 per cent and 12 per cent. UTI Banks prime lending rate is now 13 per cent.

 UTI Banks lending to the SME sector was Rs 585 crore at the end of 2005-06, reflecting a year-on-year growth of over 89 per cent from Rs 309 crore in the previous year. Till September 30 this financial year, we have disbursed Rs 700 crore. This is excluding Rs 50 crore lent under the scheme for collateral-free loans to small-scale units. By the end of 2006-07, we aim to increase our SME lending to Rs 1,000 crore, said Bimal Bhattacharyya, vice-president (advances and forex), eastern zonal office, UTI Bank.

 UTI Bank is also likely to sign a bancassurance agreement with its promoter, Life Insurance Corporation of India. LIC is believed to have made a presentation to the UTI Bank board. As of now, UTI Bank doesnt have a bancassurance tie-up with a life insurer. It has one for non-life insurance with Bajaj Allianz General Life Insurance Company.

 Hacker defaces Trai website

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Oct. 5: Telecom watchdog Trai was caught unawares last week by a hacker who broke into its website and made merry with the contents. 

 The hacker code-named - Pablin 77 prised open the server of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) and messed with some of the links on the website. 

 Though the intruder is still at large, the Trai said it has secured its servers and prevented loss of sensitive data. 

 No damage has been reported and all the documents were recovered in original shape, claimed Trai secretary Rajinder Singh.

 The regulator has lodged a complaint with the cyber crime branch of the government and sought its assistance to nail the intruder. 

 The regulator is also internally investigating the issue. Singh said an internal team of experts was probing the case and would submit a final report in the next 10 days. 

 The team will submit its report... on the improvements that are required to stop further hacking of the website, he said.

 Defacing of Indian websites is at an all time high, says a report by the Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-IN) that tracks such incidents. About 1,311 Indian sites were defaced in July 2006 against only 151 in January this year. 

 Although reports blame Pablin 77 for the intrusion, Singh said it was not clear whether that person was responsible. Pablin 77 is an international hacker who attacks only government websites.

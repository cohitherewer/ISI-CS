 Ranbaxy UK outfit faces trouble

 Bitter pill

 New Delhi, April 5: The serious fraud office (SFO) of the UK will bring criminal charges against Ranbaxy (UK) Limited for alleged anti-competitive conduct in the supply of penicillin-based antibiotics from 1996 to 2000.

 Criminal charges will also be filed against four other companies and seven individuals. The companies are Goldshield Group Plc, Merck KgaAs Generics UK, Norton Healthcare Ltd and Kent Pharmaceuticals. 

 According to the SFO, these companies fixed the prices of blood thinner warafarin and penicillin-based antibiotics that were sold to the National Health Service.

 The SFO has alleged that the National Health Service was defrauded of millions of pounds. The investigation, called Operation Holbein, lasted about four years. During this period a number of raids were conducted at homes and offices.

 Ranbaxys headquarters here, however, said the company was unaware of any wrongdoing by its UK subsidiary. Ranbaxy (UK) Limited has not yet been informed of the substance of either the allegations against it or the evidence on which they are based and is, therefore, not in a position to comment. The company is not aware of any wrongdoing, it said in a statement.

 Ranbaxy (UK) Limited is a responsible company committed to upholding the highest standards of corporate governance and best practices. The current operations of the company remain unaffected by these developments, it added.

 The nine individuals, who will be served notices, are Denis William Neill and John Stephen Clark of Kent Pharmaceuticals; Jonathan Raymond Close and Nicholas Mark Foster, both formerly of Norton Healthcare; Luma Auchi, formerly of Regent-GM Laboratories (which is now in liquidation), Michael John Frederick Sparrow, formerly of Generics UK; Anil Kumar Sharma, formerly of Ranbaxy UK, and Ajit Ramanbhai Patel and Kirti Vinubhai Patel of Goldshield Group plc.

 Calcutta, July 21: Calcutta Telephones is set to spend Rs 2,200 crore this fiscal to upgrade the Calcutta circle.

 Almost Rs 500 crore will go to strengthen the IT backbone of the telecommunications network.

 We will also launch the prepaid facilities on land linesfrom August 1 in the city. In the first phase, about 30,000 PCOs in and around the city will be offered the facility, said S.K. Chakravarty, chief general manager of Calcutta Telephones.

 In the second phase, private lines will be offered the service.

 Calcutta Telephones had invested Rs 1,100 crore last year, of which Rs 600 crore was spent on CellOne, Rs 100 crore on broadband, Rs 150 crore on intelligent network and a similar amount on IT infrastructure.

 The company has increased the number of base station towers for its CellOne network to over 500 and plans to add another 330 in the next six months.

 Chakravarty admitted that the project is six months behind schedule. However, the progress is good and the company plans to build 75 towers next month.

 For this, the final two lowest bidders L1 and L2 will be chosen for the three zones ? south, east and north. They will be selected in August or September for the Rs 21,000-crore contract to link 45.5 million lines. Of the 45.5-million lines, around 20 lakh will be in Calcutta. A similar number of lines will be set up in the rest of the state over the next three years.

 BSNL has also awarded Nortel Networks (India) Pvt Ltd the responsibility of upgrading and installing seven million connections in the Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) network in the southern and eastern zone.

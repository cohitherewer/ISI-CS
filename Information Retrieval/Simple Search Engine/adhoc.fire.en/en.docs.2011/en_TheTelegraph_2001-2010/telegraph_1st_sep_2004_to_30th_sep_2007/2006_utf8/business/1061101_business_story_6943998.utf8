 Mumbai, Oct. 31: Borrowers of home or car loans need not worry, at least for now. With the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) leaving key rates, including the reverse repo, unchanged, bankers are forecasting a stable interest rate regime in the short-run.

 The increase in the repurchase rate will raise borrowing costs for banks, said Prakash P. Mallya, chairman and managing director, Vijaya Bank. But it will not have any impact on home or auto loans.

 Mallyas views are echoed by other bankers who point out that interest rates are likely to remain unchanged at least till the end of this calendar year.

 Calling it a delicate balancing act, bankers said though repo rate hike would not impact home and auto loans, lenders having liquidity problems may raise loan rates for personal, real estate, consumer goods and equity market. 

 Welcoming RBIs policy stance, an Oriental Bank of Commerce official said repo rate hike signals that productive sectors should get sufficient credit, while non-productive sectors should pay a little more. 

 Punjab National Bank executive director K. Raghuraman said RBIs repo rate hike is a caution about credit growth, specially for banks who are aggressive towards market. He added that those banks borrowing from RBI to meet liquidity demand may jack up interest rates.

 Apart from interest rates remaining where they are, home loan takers have another comforting factor from the credit policy. The Reserve Bank today said some banks, while lending for housing, do not fully indicate the circumstances and factors governing floating rates and reset clauses.

 Asking banks to review all practices which are less than fair or transparent, the central bank told them that borrowers should be given an opportunity to obtain fair and transparent terms that is consistent with legal requirements and fair practices.

 According to bankers and housing finance companies, the reset clause differs from one company to another. 

 In case of some like HDFC, the reset is done three months after first disbursement. But in case of many other banks, the reset is done quarterly. The loan takers are usually not aware of when the reset takes place as they are more worried about getting the loan, said a banker. 

 While internationally Libor is the benchmark for a banks prime lending rate (PLR), in India, it is largely that particular banks cost of funds which determine the PLR.

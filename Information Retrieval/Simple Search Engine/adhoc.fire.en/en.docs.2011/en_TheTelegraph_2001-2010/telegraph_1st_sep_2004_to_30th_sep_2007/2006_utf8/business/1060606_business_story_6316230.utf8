 Formula fails to satisfy oil firms

 S.P.S. PANNU 

 New Delhi, June 5: The package announced to bail out the oil companies today falls short of their expectations as the finance ministry has managed to thwart the move to slash excise duties which form the bulk of the outgo on taxes.

 The modest reduction in customs duties, which will save the oil firms around Rs 4,100 crore, will be neutralised to a large extent with the introduction of the new pricing formula based on trade-parity.

 The new formula will give 20 per cent weightage to export prices which are lower than import parity prices. The price that the oil companies will now fix for their products will, therefore, be lower, leading to a Rs 2,200-crore reduction in realisation.

 However, the oil companies had come in for criticism on the import-parity pricing formula as they do not really import the diesel and petrol and yet charge a notional cost for shipping, insurance and port charges. But the flip side of the coin is that they have to pay a 5 per cent duty on crude oil even though they have to sell the LPG and kerosene produced from it at subsidised prices. 

 The skewed tax structure is reflected in the fact that although the oil companies have been reeling under skyrocketing crude prices and consumers have been paying increased prices for petroleum products. The governments earnings from the petroleum sector have shot up from Rs 96,000 crore in 2002-03 to Rs 126,000 crore in 2005-06.

 Unlike the advanced countries where excise and customs duties are imposed on the quantity of goods to raise a specific amount of revenue, the Indian duty structure based on the value of the product shoots up each time the prices are raised. This anomaly has not been corrected in the current round despite the recommendations of the Rangarajan committee which supported the measure.

 While the government has agreed to issue Rs 28,000 crore worth of bonds, these will be issued in tranches and it is here that the finance ministry has been arm twisting the oil firms in the past.

 During the last fiscal, the bonds had been considerably delayed, thereby putting immense financial strain on the oil companies. The petroleum ministry had to urge the prime minister to direct the finance minister to issue the bonds as the oil companies had to take recourse to borrowings at high costs. 

 Although the bonds can be offloaded in the market to raise money, this can only be done at a discount as a result of which the oil companies do not get the full value. 

 The oil companies naturally prefer any package that puts hard cash in their hands. 

 The ad hoc measure of issuing bonds and the inter-ministerial wrangle that precedes every bond issue also tends to introduce an element of uncertainty for the oil companies.

 Petroleum minister Murli Deora had wanted a formal price stabilisation fund contributed through the enhanced cess on crude oil that Chidambaram had introduced in his budget. This impost of Rs 2,500 per tonne on crude is expected to mobilise a whopping Rs 7,500 crore for the government.

 The petroleum ministry had expected that with the left parties also backing the move they would be on a strong wicket vis-a-vis Chidambarams team. But this has not happened in the current round.

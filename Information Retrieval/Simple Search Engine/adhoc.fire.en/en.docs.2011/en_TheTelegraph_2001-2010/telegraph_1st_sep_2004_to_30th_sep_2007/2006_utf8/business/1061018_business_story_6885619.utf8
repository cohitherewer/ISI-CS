 Wal-Mart to buy China store chain

 Hong Kong/Shanghai, Oct. 17 (Reuters): Wal-Mart Stores Inc has agreed to buy a Chinese hypermarket chain for about $1 billion to become the top foreign player in Chinas fragmented retail market, a source familiar with the situation said on Tuesday. 

 If approved by Chinese regulators, the deal to buy Trust-Mart, a closely held Taiwan company with 100 supercenters in China, would push Wal-Mart past Carrefour SA for the most supercentres in China, Asias second-biggest retail market. 

 Spokespeople with Wal-Mart and Trust-Mart declined to comment on Tuesday. 

 Supercentres, also known as hypermarkets, are giant stores that sell a wide range of general food and merchandise. 

 Wal-Mart beat Carrefour out in bidding for the Trust-Mart stores, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday, citing sources. 

 Trust-Mart posted sales of about 13.2 billion yuan ($1.67 billion) at its Chinese hypermarkets in 2005, according to the China Chain Store and Franchise Association, well above Wal-Marts 9.9 billion yuan in its Chinese stores. 

 By comparison, Carrefour had sales of 17.4 billion yuan at its Chinese hypermarkets in the year, while Germanys Metro recorded sales of 7.5 billion yuan, the data showed. 

 But Chinas retail market worth about $500 billion according to research firm Euromonitor is still dominated by Chinese chains, analysts said, with the foreigners lagging far behind industry leader Bailian Group Co Ltd, which was created in 2003 through a merger of four major retail firms. 

 When Wal-Mart expands, supposedly they are going to enjoy better economies of scale, said retail analyst Selina Sia, who is with the UBS in Hong Kong. 

 The market is still highly fragmented. None of the chains have a dominant power to take leadership, but there are more domestic firms than foreign ones. 

 The top 100 retailers in China account for only 10 per cent of the sector, accounting firm Ernst amp; Young said in a recent report. 

 Established in 1997, Trust-Mart employs more than 30,000 people at its hypermarkets in more than 20 provinces across China, and says it offers nearly 20,000 different products. 

 Acquisition is the game. If you can buy x number of stores in one scoop ... then you have increased size to help you cut down on the cost of supply. Its just the right thing to do, said Jack Huang, chairman of the Greater China Practice of international law firm Jones Day, who closely tracks M amp;A trends in China. 

 This acquisition will also open the door for more to be done by Wal-Mart, Carrefour and their other competition, he said.

 Price snag in Sahara acquisition

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Flight delayed

 New Delhi, Jan. 11: Jet Airways has hit an air pocket in its buyout of Air Sahara, which is insisting on a higher price.

 The differences have meant the two sides are still away from a deal, though talks to arrive at one have been continuing. There is no deal signed with Jet. We did talk to them for a strategic tie-up. We have synergies, said Air Sahara executive vice-president Alok Sharma.

 Sahara had made it known since October last year that it was open to the idea of merging with other airlines. A prospectus offering a stake to private bidders was also floated but those who showed interest ran into a high asking price of Rs 3,300 crore to Rs 4,500 crore. 

 Sharma refused to answer queries on whether Sahara was in talks for a partial stake sale or an outright sellout. We are consolidating into a big airline. We are the countrys largest capitalised carrier. To expand further, we are exploring all options, he said.

 Kingfisher and SpiceJet had also set their sights on the airline but ultimately pulled out of talks, which, sources say, started in July last year. Even Jet had opened lines of communication around that time. Politicians from Uttar Pradesh, the cradle of the Sahara group, were intermediaries in the talks, say sources. 

 Jet, which has been in talks for quite some time despite repeated off and on denials, has been willing to offer between half to two-thirds of the asking price but Sahara has not scaled what it perceives is the right value ? between Rs 3,300 crore and Rs 4,500 crore. 

 Ernst amp; Young has valued us at a certain level, Sharma said, indicating the airline believes that the valuation was right. The Sahara honcho also said that talks would continue with Jet and there are no time frames for talks. 

 Sharma also cited a confidentiality clause which forbade him from disclosing the names of fund managers with whom Sahara had held talks at one point of time. Equity investors like Blackstone, Temasek Holdings and Carlyle are believed to be among them.

 Sources said most airlines that negotiated for a deal balked at the price that was quoted by Sahara. What made the terms look even more stiff was the fact that Sahara did not own aircraft and ran its services with leased planes.

 Saharas real wealth lies in intangibles, one of which is the huge cluster of routes it is free to fly to, if fleet permits. These include its services to the UK and US. The other asset it has is the staff strength and its network. Sharma said his airline has been booking profits for the last two years and posted a Rs 26-crore profit in the previous one.

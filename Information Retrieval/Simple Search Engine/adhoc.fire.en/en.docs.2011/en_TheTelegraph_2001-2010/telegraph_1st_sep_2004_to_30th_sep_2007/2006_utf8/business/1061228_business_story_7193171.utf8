 Hutch sets floor price of $14bn

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Costly call 

 Mumbai, Dec. 27: As Ravi Ruia of Essar and Arun Sarin of Vodafone hunker down separately for parleys with Hutchison honchos in Hong Kong, Hutchison Telecom has put out word that it wont even sniff at an offer that values its 67 per cent stake in Hutchison Essar Ltd, its Indian wireless subsidiary, at less than $14 billion.

 This effectively puts the enterprise value for Hutchison Essar at over $ 20 billion as the bidding battle among the four players Essar, Anil Ambanis Reliance Communications, Vodafone of the UK and Maxis Communications of Malaysia enters a gripping endgame this week. Orascom Telecom, which has a 19.3 per cent stake in Hutchison Telecom International and thereby an indirect 10 per cent stake in Hutchison Essar, is also hovering in the wings.

 Essar has reportedly stumped up an offer that values the unit at $18 billion and will clearly need to up its bid value if it hopes to stay in the race. The Ruias have two things going for them: they have a 33 per cent stake in the Hutchison Essar and hold a crucial right of first refusal should Hutchison Telecom choose to sell its stake.

 Both Ravi Ruia, vice-chairman, Essar group and Arun Sarin, CEO, Vodafone were believed to have arrived at Hong Kong with their investment bankers in tow for confabulations with senior Hutch bosses. 

 Officials of Essar group however, denied that Ravi Ruia was in Hong Kong. He is very much in Mumbai, they added.

 Despite this denial, sources from the $ 15 billion group are not disputing their interest in Hutchison Essar. The group has always said that it is interested in raising its stake in Hutch-Essar. Therefore, yes we are interested, but things are still at an early stage, they added. 

 Though there are doubt in the minds of certain observers about the conglomerates ability to raise funds of such a magnitude to finance the deal, sources said it wasnt all that difficult these days to raise the money.

 India is a hot market. Moreover banks are confident about the potential of Hutch-Essar in the vastly untapped Indian telecom sector. Therefore, raising funds should not be a problem, the source said.

 The Essar group is understood to have roped in Morgan Stanley as its advisor and reports say that it has got a line of credit from Citigroup and others for over $10 billion.

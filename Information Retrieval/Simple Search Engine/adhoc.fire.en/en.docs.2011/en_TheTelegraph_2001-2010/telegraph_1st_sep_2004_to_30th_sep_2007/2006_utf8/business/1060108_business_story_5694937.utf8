 Chidambaram: Quick action

 New Delhi, Jan. 7: Finance minister P. Chidambaram has asked states to speed up the process of signing agreements to implement the Rs 13,596-crore cooperative revival package.

 The cabinet has approved a revival package for the short-term rural cooperative credit structure as recommended by the task force headed by A. Vaidyanathan.

 The government has given an in-principle approval to the report of the task force on revival of short-term rural cooperative credit structure. We hope the states will agree to implement the package, Chidambaram said in a letter to chief ministers and heads of union territories.

 Nabard has been asked to make a detailed presentation of the package, it said.

 Chidambaram said a draft memorandum of understanding would soon be sent to the states. The revival package is aimed at reviving the cooperative credit structure and make it a well-managed and vibrant medium to serve the credit needs of rural India, especially the small and marginal farmers. 

 It seeks to provide financial assistance to bring the system to an acceptable level of health, introduce legal and institutional reforms necessary for their democratic, self-reliant and efficient functioning, and take measures to improve the quality of management. 

 All three components are equally important and should be treated and implemented as an integrated package, Chidambaram said in the letter. 

 Financial assistance will be extended to wipe out accumulated losses, cover invoked but unpaid and uninvoked guarantees given by the state governments and other dues to the cooperative credit structure from them, and increase the capital to a specified minimum level. 

 In order to ensure that the cooperative credit structure continues on sound financial, managerial and governance norms, technical assistance will also be provided to upgrade institutional and human resources of the CCS. 

 The package will include assistance to bring all cooperatives, including primary agricultural credit societies, to a minimum capital to risk weighted assets ratio (CRAR) of 7 per cent.

 The liability for funding the financial package will be shared by the Centre, state governments and the cooperative credit structure based on origin of loss and existing commitments. 

 The proposed financial assistance is a one-time measure only and states would have the option to not participate also.

 Rules tweaked to curb swing

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, June 16: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) today imposed stricter margin rules in the spot market where the sensex waltzed its way to a 339-point gain on the back of its record run yesterday.

 Sebi said investors would have to pay margin upfront to the broker, while taking a trading call. The circular said applicable value added margin (VaR) should be calculated at least five times daily against the prevailing practice of once a day.

 Sebi has asked BSE and NSE to implement this norm from July 10 and other exchanges from August 28. 

 Analysts said the move would protect the interests of brokers and curb excess volatility that has characterised trading of late.

 Yesterday Sebi chairman M. Damodaran said the regulator was considering various measures to curb volatility.

 Meanwhile, the sensex pierced the 10000-mark today before losing ground to close at 9884.51, still 339 points up from the last finish.

 The mood, however, is one of cautious optimism. There is a feeling of the worst being over for equities yet global developments are under the scanner for their likely impact on the domestic market.

 Trading today was influenced by world markets ? the Dow Jones gained 198.27 points on Thursday and the Nasdaq 58.15. The Nikkei gained 408.58 points today; Hang Seng 407.57; Singapore ST index 71.48 and Kospi 42.79 points. Goaded by the global surge, investors rushed to buy shares that were still available at reasonable valuations. 

 Anagram relief

 The Sebi today lifted the ban on proprietary trading put on Anagram Securities Ltd (ASL). 

 ASL was identified as one of the 

 financiers of the master account holders and an ultimate 

 beneficiary of the shares cornered by key operators in various 

 initial public offerings between 2003 and 2005.

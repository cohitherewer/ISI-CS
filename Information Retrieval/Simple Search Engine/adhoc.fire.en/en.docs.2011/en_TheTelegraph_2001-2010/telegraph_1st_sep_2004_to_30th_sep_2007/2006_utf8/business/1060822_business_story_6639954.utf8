 Govt revs up to sell Maruti rump stake

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 On the fast lane

 New Delhi, Aug. 21: The ministry for heavy industries has given its approval for the sale of the governments remaining 10.27 per cent stake in Maruti Udyog Ltd but its finance counterpart will now have to take a call on the issue.

 Heavy industries minister Santosh Mohan Dev said an inter-ministerial group, which would include representatives from finance and law ministries and the department of company affairs, would take the final decision and also work out the manner in which the stake would be offloaded.

 Earlier, Dev indicated that his ministry was willing to part with this stake.

 Based on the current market price of the companys scrip on the stock exchanges, the government is likely to raise over Rs 2,500 crore. 

 As all divestment in public sector companies is off for now, sale of shares in erstwhile PSU Maruti will offer much-needed resources to the government.

 The government has raised nearly Rs 1,567 crore by divesting 8 per cent of its stake in Maruti Udyog in January this year.

 Bids from eight banks and financial institutions were accepted by the empowered group of ministers at an average price of Rs 678.24 per share.

 The floor price for the offer was set at Rs 620 apiece. 

 The shares were sold with a lock-in period of one year and this condition is likely to be retained this time around as well. 

 A total of 36 banks and financial institutions had bid for the shares. The Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), which was allotted 1.68 crore shares, had been given the largest share of the stake being divested followed by the State Bank of India, which was given more than 39.29 lakh shares.

 Before that, the government had 

 held a 45.8 per cent stake in Maruti, comprising 13.23 crore 

 shares of Rs 5 each.

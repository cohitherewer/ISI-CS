 Clarity lapses smudge sticky asset market

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, June 11: Even as the market for sticky assets is growing with the entry of foreign and private sector banks, there is concern over lack of transparent practices by selling banks. This might deter participants from buying such assets, the sales of which had gathered momentum in recent times.

 The Asset Reconstruction Company (India) Ltd (Arcil) started the purchase of bad loans from banks and financial institutions. Since then, other players have shown interest. Foreign and private sector banks such as Kotak Mahindra Bank, Deutsche Bank and Standard Chartered Bank are some of the bidders in auctions of such loans.

 Moreover, the stage is now set for the entry of foreign institutional investors as they have been allowed to invest in security receipts that are issued by the company buying the loans. Security receipts are similar to bonds issued by asset reconstruction companies to banks when they buy bad loans from them. These security receipts can be redeemed later.

 However, the market continues to lack certain provisions necessary to draw wider participation, sources said.

 In many cases, transparent practices are not being followed by selling banks as they fail to disclose the reserve price (the minimum price which a seller will accept at an auction), they added. Moreover, deals are also being called off by sellers without citing proper reasons.

 Sources said while bidders spend considerable money and resources to participate in the bidding process, transparent practices are necessary to encourage international participation. They feel the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) need to come out with specific guidelines for auctioning sticky assets.

 Recently, a bank called off a bid without elaborating on the reasons. It could be that the bid was below the reserve price. However, the bank had not disclosed the reserve price. We are now in a nascent market. If this continues, investor participation could be affected, a source said.

 It is mostly public sector banks which have put some of their non-performing assets (NPAs) on the block. Before March this year, the State Bank of India (SBI) and a couple of its associate banks sold some of their NPAs. Six banks recently auctioned 15 portfolios that had principal outstanding dues of Rs 5,300 crore. Kotak Mahindra Bank, Standard Chartered Bank, Arcil and Deutsche Bank participated in the bids. Among them, Arcil has acquired an aggregate debt of Rs 21,000 crore from banks. The portfolio covers industries like textiles, power, steel and cement.

 L amp;T issues $100m overseas bonds

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Jan. 5: Larsen amp; Toubro Ltd, the engineering and construction company, will raise $100 million through the issue of foreign currency convertible bonds (FCCBs) in the international markets to finance its capital expenditure and overseas acquisition plans.

 The FCCBs have a face value of 10 million yen per bond and a conversion price of Rs 2,498.45 per bond, which is at a 35 per cent premium to L amp;Ts closing price of Rs 1,850.70 on the Bombay Stock Exchange on Wednesday. The bonds will be redeemed at the end of five years at 103.30 per cent of the face value.

 This is the first Japanese yen-denominated convertible bond issue launched from India.

 L amp;T officials said the issue would increase the companys resource base, as it aims for accelerated organic and inorganic growth. There are many segments where the company wants to grow through the inorganic route internationally. These include marine installations apart from its other core activities, they added.

 In a communication issued to stock exchanges today, L amp;T said it has priced an accelerated 5-year 0 per cent coupon yen denominated FCCB of $100 million. The bonds are convertible into global depository receipts representing the equity shares of the company at the option of the bondholders.

 The bonds are expected to be listed on an international stock exchange. The issue was launched after local trading hours on Wednesday.

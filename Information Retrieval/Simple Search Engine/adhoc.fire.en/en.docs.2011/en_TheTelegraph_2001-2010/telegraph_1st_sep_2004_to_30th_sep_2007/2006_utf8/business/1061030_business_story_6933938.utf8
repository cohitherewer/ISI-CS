 Apex bank scales may tilt towards growth

 Guardian Act

 Should the RBI raise interest rates in its review of monetary policy on October 31? One way of looking at the issue is to check why it raised the repo and reverse repo rates by 25 basis points in July.

 This is what the RBI said at that time: There are disturbing signs of demand pressures, especially continuing high credit growth, that could exert upward pressure on prices when associated with supply shocks such as from oil. These pressures have the potential for impacting stability and inflation expectations The global outlook for growth is positive but downside risks in regard to inflation and re-pricing of risks in financial markets need to be recognised On balance, a modest pre-emptive action in monetary policy is appropriate at this juncture while being ready to respond flexibly and promptly by closely monitoring the related developments.

 It also pointed out, The annual policy statement of April 2006 warned of three key risks from global developments for emerging economies, including India: potential escalation and volatility in international crude prices; a disorderly unwinding of global imbalances; and a hardening of international interest rates along with the direction of movement in setting monetary policy. Since then, the evolution of the global economy seems to indicate that each of these risks is materialising; in fact, these risks appear to have heightened in recent months.

 Many things have changed since then. International oil prices have eased considerably. The US Federal Reserve hasnt changed its policy rate in its last three meetings and Japan has indicated that it is in no hurry to tighten further. The latest data show that US GDP growth has been a mere 1.6 per cent during the July-September quarter and many analysts expect the Federal Reserve to start cutting interest rates early next year. Stock markets across the world have not only recovered from the crash in May but many have scaled new heights. Everybody is now predicting a slowdown for the global economy. 

 The net result has been lower interest rates: in India, the 10-year government bond is now at 7.6 per cent, compared with 8.3 per cent in July, when the repo rate was raised. Whats more, the rupee is at a five-month high, unlike at the time of the last quarterly policy review, when it was under pressure.

 What hasnt changed? Bank credit continues to grow very strongly, but there too, a clear deceleration is being seen, with the annual rate of increase slowing from 33.1 per cent on June 30 to 29.3 per cent on October 13. Money supply growth (year-on-year) is 19 per cent, higher than the 18.1 per cent at the end of June. Its still far above the RBIs target of 15 per cent for the year. True, inflation according to the WPI index is 5.26 per cent, a four-month high, but thats still lower than the 5.44 per cent reached in mid-June.

 In other words, theres no longer the compelling reason for raising rates as existed at the time of the July review. At a time when the global economy is slowing, it may be time to give a longer rope to domestic demand. In its never-ending attempt to fine-tune that delicate balance between inflation and growth, this is the time for the RBI to err on the side of growth.

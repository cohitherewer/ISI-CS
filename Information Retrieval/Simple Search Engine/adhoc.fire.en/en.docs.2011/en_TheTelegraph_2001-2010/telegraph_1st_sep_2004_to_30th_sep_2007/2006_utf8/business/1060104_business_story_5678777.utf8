 Govt pulls petro punches till budget

 S.P.S. PANNU 

 Refill time

 New Delhi, Jan. 3: The government is unlikely to raise the prices of petroleum products till the budget next month.

 An increase in the prices of petroleum goods may be considered only in end-February depending on international oil rates, a senior petroleum ministry official told The Telegraph. 

 Given the current price trend, the government hopes it can avoid a hike till the Union budget by issuing oil bonds and through the burden sharing system. 

 If prices turn volatile, the government would prefer to tinker with the tax structure rather than pass on the burden to consumers. 

 The petroleum ministry is confident that its demand for a revenue-neutral tax structure for the sector would be cleared in the budget. The finance ministry has so far blocked the move to replace the current ad valorem system of customs and excise duties.

 Sources said petroleum secretary M.S. Srinivasan had a discussion yesterday with the high-powered Rangarajan committee, which was set up to evolve a long-term pricing mechanism for petroleum products. This includes the rationalisation of the distorted tax structure on petroleum products as well.

 According to sources, the committee appears to be waking up to the need for a change in the ad valorem system of excise and customs duties based on the price of crude and petroleum products. This value-based tax system imposes an additional burden on consumers and oil companies alike each time international prices go up.

 When international prices of crude go up, the customs duty on each barrel also shoots up.

 Similarly, when global rates of petroleum products shoot up, consumers have to shell out more not only for the increased prices but also for higher excise duties on these products. 

 At times when domestic prices are kept on hold in order to shield consumers from skyrocketing prices, the oil companies are made to pay the extra excise duty as well. 

 Most European countries and Japan have a revenue-neutral tax structure on crude and petroleum goods that is levied on the quantity of the products bought. Any increase in the price of these products does not result in higher taxes. 

 The petroleum ministry has been pushing for such a proposal but the finance ministry has been shooting it down. 

 Petroleum ministry officials said the Rangarajan committee has to submit its recommendations directly to the Prime Minister. Once the Prime Minister accepts the recommendations, the finance ministry will have to fall in line, the officials added.

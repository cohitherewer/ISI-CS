 Criminal complaint against Analjit

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 20: Nimmi Singh, the mother of Malvinder and Shivinder, today filed a criminal complaint against Max chairman Analjit Singh and others before a city court. Analjit, who is Nimmis brother-in-law, is the chief beneficiary of Ranbaxy founder Bhai Mohan Singhs disputed will.

 In her complaint before the additional chief metropolitan magistrate, Nimmi, the eldest daughter-in-law of Bhai Mohan Singh, has alleged that Analjit along with four others had intimidated and assaulted her and her daughter-in-law.

 Earlier this month, Nimmi had also filed an FIR on this issue with the Tughlaq Road police station, New Delhi.

 The court is yet to take cognisance of the complaint filed by Nimmi.

 The complainant, however, filed a case in the court only after the police refused to register an FIR.

 Meanwhile, Analjit has also filed a defamation case against Nimmi for allegedly orchestrating events to malign his image. He had filed the complaint at the additional chief metropolitan magistrate of the Patiala court on July 18.

 After this development, any out-of-court settlement in the family tussle appears unlikely, sources said.

 On July 2, Malvinder and Shivinder had filed a police complaint against Analjit, accusing him of criminal intimidation and assault.

 Analjit said in a statement issued by his lawyer that the accusations were false and mischievous.

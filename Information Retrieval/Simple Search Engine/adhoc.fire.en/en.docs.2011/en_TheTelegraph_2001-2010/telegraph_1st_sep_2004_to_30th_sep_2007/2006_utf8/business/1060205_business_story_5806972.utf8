 Tata Motors lists growth drivers

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Feb. 4: Leading automobile maker Tata Motors has identified small commercial vehicles and pick-ups as future growth drivers within its commercial vehicle (CV) portfolio.

 The pick-up industry is growing at a rate of 25 per cent in terms of volumes, P. K. Verma, head, sales and marketing of Tata Motors, said.

 The hub and spoke logistics facility being developed in the country is giving boost to pick-up segment sales, he added.

 Pick-up vehicles contribute 20 per cent of commercial vehicle sales, which is expected to go up 25 per cent in the future. In the last four years, sales have been growing by 48 per cent compounded annually.

 Tata Motors enjoys a 40 per cent market share in the pick-up segment nationally.

 Verma was recently in the city to launch flat load body model 207 DI EX which belongs to the pick-up segment.

 The company has recently launched a new product ACE in select markets. ACE has less than 1 tonne load capacity. The vehicle has been a complete sellout in all the markets and as a result Tata Motors is adding fresh capacity.

 The commercial vehicle segment is likely to grow at 10-11 per cent during the current fiscal. Out of the three lakh CV units sold in the country, 52,000 of them were pick-up vehicles.

 In the east, the companys market share in the pick-up segment is less than that in the heavy commercial vehicle (HCV) segment.

 Calcutta, Oct. 4: The export of German machinery to India is expected to reach 2 billion euros by the end of 2006 with renewed interest of German companies in fluid power, mining machinery and food processing. Bengal is also seen to attract a portion of these exports with German firms keen on the state.

 A delegation of VDMA or the German Engineering Federation will visit Calcutta with representatives from its 36 specialised sectors and member companies.

 Bengal is gradually moving up the preference ladder of German companies, especially in sectors like auto components, mining equipment and food processing. German companies are willing to go beyond exporting high-end machines to India to setting up 100 per cent subsidiary or joint ventures. With VDMA having one of its oldest Asia offices in Calcutta, we are focusing on the industrial resurgence of the region, said Rajesh Nath, director, VDMA Liasion Office, Calcutta.

 In fluid power, JDS Technologies from Calcutta has started an assembly facility with Hansaflex of Germany. Plans are afoot to start a manufacturing facility in a phased manner. 

 The top brass of German firm Hunger was in Calcutta and held talks with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to set up a 100 per cent subsidiary in the city. Discussions are on regarding various parameters like land and investment, said Nath.

 VDMA sees a lot of opportunity in mining and coal and is organising the International Mining and Machinery Exhibition in the city from November 22 to 25.

 A couple of German companies are eyeing opportunities in the mining machinery sector. There has been a tie-up between UT Limited and Essar in this area. There is an Indo-German working group on coal, which facilitates such interaction, said Oliver Wack, head of Southeast Asia foreign trade division, VDMA (German Engineering Federation).

 Wack said the governments decision to allow 100 per cent subsidiaries has boosted the confidence of German companies.

 According to Engineering Export Promotion Council (EEPC), India exported Rs 651.82 crore worth of engineering and manufacturing items to Germany last fiscal.

 Industrial standards

 The German ministry of commerce intends to set up a working committee with India to harmonise various industrial standards to facilitate bilateral trade in engineering and manufacturing items.

 Preferred destination

 India will always come second after China as an investment destination of German companies. Germanys machinery export to India in 2005 stood at 1.5 billion euros while it was 8 billion euros to China. However, the importance of India is increasing as non-tariff trade barriers in China like certification and sampling become more troublesome. Intellectual property rights is another area of concern and Chinese firms do not encourage joint ventures, Wack said.

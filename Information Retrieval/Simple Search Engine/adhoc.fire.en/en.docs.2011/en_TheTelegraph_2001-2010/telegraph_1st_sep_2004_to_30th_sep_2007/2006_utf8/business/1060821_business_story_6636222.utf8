 Dredging Corp looks for ally

 New Delhi, Aug. 20: The shipping ministry has asked the Dredging Corporation of India (DCI) to look at the joint venture route to expand its operations and hit back at the tendency of foreign companies to form cartels in this area. 

 Shipping secretary A.K. Mahapatra told The Telegraph that ONGC, Indian Oil, Larsen amp; Toubro and Shipping Corporation of India figure on the list of companies that DCI would approach for a joint venture to buy dredgers to augment its fleet.

 There is huge demand for dredging services in the Indian ports as the channels need to be deepened. 

 Dredgers, however, are in short supply. Taking advantage of this situation, dredging companies appear to have formed cartels and are quoting exorbitant prices for undertaking operations.

 Sources disclose that the Paradip port had to cancel the tenders it had invited for deepening the channels as the prices quoted by the dredging companies were too high. 

 Even the lowest prices quoted was Rs 100 crore more than the estimated cost of Rs 150 crore for the dredging work. The port has now invited tenders for the second time for the same project. 

 Among the area of operations of the DCI is the Hooghly, as the Calcutta port requires constant dredging due to silting. 

 The shipping ministry feels there is tremendous scope for expanding the operations of DCI as all the major ports have plans to deepen their approach channels so that bigger ships can come in. 

 This has become necessary as worldwide there is a trend among shipping companies to go in for bigger vessels as these bring down the cost of operations due to economies of scale. 

 While the country lacks dredging capacity, it is amongst the worlds largest market for such operations. Most of the Indian ports are shallow and constant dredging is required for maintaining the water depth in some ports, while others have to be further deepened to increase the capacity of the ports to take in bigger ships.

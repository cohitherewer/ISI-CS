 Govt cautious after oil scar

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY AND S.P.S. PANNU

 New Delhi, Sept. 5: The withdrawal of the strike by oil officers brought little relief to the government as it is now dogged by concerns over a likely chorus of demands from officers of other PSUs for a pay hike.

 The government is also grappling with the issue of differential pay hikes as high profits from their monopoly status make it easier for oil PSUs to accede to demands for substantial hikes than other concerns who earn lower profits. If there are differential increases (between PSUs) which is one proposal we have been studying for some time ... we may have a different kind of agitation on our hand, focusing on equality of treatment, said senior finance ministry officials. 

 Already officers of steel PSUs and NTPC are demanding a revision in their salaries, while Air-India is planning a 20 per cent raise for its 5,500 employees that would bloat its salary and wage bill by Rs 100 crore.

 Meanwhile, oil sector officers today called off their strike following assurances from petroleum minister Murli Deora and minister for department of public enterprises Santosh Mohan Dev to resolve their pending issues expeditiously.

 The apprehensions are the assurances will boomerang on the government as they relate mainly to pay hikes.

 In its letter to Deora, the Oil Sector Officers Association (OSOA) said, In view of the assurances and positive response to resolve our issues, we have decided to withdraw our proposed agitation. The union also told their members that the strike was on hold for three weeks. 

 The union claimed that it had given the government three weeks to resolve its demand for higher salaries. If the government accedes to the demand, officers will get a starting salary of Rs 50,000 a month. 

 This is in line with the salaries of global oil companies in India and in other parts of South Asia, though much higher than the salary in other PSUs.

 OSOA has demanded a merger of 50 per cent of the officers DA with their salaries along with a share in the profits of the oil companies, as recommended by the Justice Mohan committee on revision of the salary of executives in public sector enterprises.

 OSOA, which represents officers of all the public sector oil companies Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum, Hindustan Petroleum, IBP, ONGC and OIL claims that the government has reneged on their promises made through an MoU way back in 2000.

 Calcutta, Jan. 22: Reliance Infocomm has taken telecom freebies a step further by introducing free outgoing calls of limited denomination on entry, middle-level and high-end camera phones with a nine-month validity.

 We are offering Rs 2000 worth free talktime on LG 5340, 6230 colour handsets and LG 2340 (black and white). The offer also includes 2000 free SMSs, Reliance Infocomm president-wireless S.P. Shukla said.

 Each of the LG 5130 and 2430 handsets would get talktime worth Rs 1000 and all the offers are valid for nine months.

 The handset prices range from Rs 2000 to Rs 8000 and might vary slightly in various states.

 The offer is open till stocks last and Shukla sees no problems on the stock front during February.

 Existing customers could also upgrade to this offer while exchanging handsets.

 There are no restrictions on the usage of the free limited outgoing and the Reliance standard tariff plan is applicable. A customer needs to recharge after the first two months and then every month and could do it with the lowest denomination available.

 The lifetime incoming free offer has also been extended to the prepaid fixed wireless phone (LSP 400 model) by making a one-time payment of Rs 2,999, excluding service tax.

 The one-time payment ensures connectivity for life and Shukla said the definition of lifetime would be akin to those given by life insurance companies, wherein the customers assume that the company will outlive them.

 The outgoing calls on the prepaid fixed wireless phones will cost Rs 1.10 per pulse under the default 275 plan.

 This first-of-its-kind offer on fixed wireless phones also allows the flexibility to choose other recharge vouchers.

 Reliance Infocomm had launched lifetime incoming free on post-paid fixed wireless phones two weeks ago.

 Bharti move

 Sunil Mittals Bharti group is set to enter the niche Internet protocol TV (IPTV) segment where video content would be offered through its telephone lines. 

 UTStarcom, which is the technology partner of Bharti in this venture, has installed a digital headend in Gurgaon where the trial run is on with some free-to-air TV channels and other video content, sources said. UTStarcom is building the entire IPTV architecture for Bharti. This includes the headend and the digital set-top boxes.

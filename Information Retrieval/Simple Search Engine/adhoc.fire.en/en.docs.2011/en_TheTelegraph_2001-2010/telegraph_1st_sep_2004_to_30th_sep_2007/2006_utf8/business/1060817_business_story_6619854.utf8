 M amp;M faith in Maharashtra

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Aug. 16: After General Motors placed its bets on Maharashtra, Mahindra and Mahindra (M amp;M) today announced its plans to set up its new project in the state. 

 The company today announced a Rs-550-crore investment to set up its new plant at its existing manufacturing facility in Nashik. It will manufacture a new multi-purpose vehicle platform code named Ingenio. 

 The decision to launch our most prestigious project after Scorpio and Logan in the state is a tribute to a partnership that began with our inception. Now, some of our most advanced facilities are in this state, said Keshub Mahindra, chairman of the Mahindra group. The companys earliest plant was in Mazgaon. 

 With this additional investment, the production capacity at the existing plant in Nashik will increase to 1.5 lakh vehicles per annum. The production of the new vehicle is expected to commence by 2008. 

 Two weeks ago, GM signed a deal with the state government to set up its second manufacturing facility in Maharashtra where it intends to make the Chevy Spark, its small car.

 The state offers many advantages, including access to a large reservoir of skilled and technical manpower and a well developed supplier base, said Pawan Goenka, president (automotive sector) at M amp;M. 

 Goenka added the positive experiences with existing facilities in Nashik, Kandivali, Igatpuri and Nagpur had helped the company decide to get Ingenio in the state. The plant will generate employment for over 500 people in Nashik and will also provide opportunities to more than 2,500. 

 Given the success of the Scorpio and the proposed launch of the Logan next year, we are confident that Ingenio too will attract investment and create employment opportunities, said Maharashtra chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh. 

 M amp;M is the leader in the utility vehicle segment with a market share of around 45 per cent. 

 The company had posted a 39 per cent rise in sales at 13,136 units for July 2006 over the corresponding period of the previous fiscal at 9,454 units. 

 During this period, 3,043 units of Scorpios were sold against 2,390 units last year, marking a 27 per cent increase in sales for the flagship product from M amp;M stable. 

 Besides the Scorpio, sales of M amp;Ms utility vehicle range rose 23 per cent to 5,872 units from 4,774 units last July. 

 On a cumulative basis, from April to July, the most significant change in sales was primarily seen in the export market that grew by 34 per cent. The company exported 1,984 units against 1,480 units for the cumulative period last year. 

 M amp;M had reported a 41 per cent surge in its net profit at Rs 204.2 crore for the first quarter of the current fiscal against Rs 145.3 crore in the corresponding period of last year. Gross revenues and other income for the quarter was Rs 2,548.6 crore, an increase of 23 per cent over the same period last year.

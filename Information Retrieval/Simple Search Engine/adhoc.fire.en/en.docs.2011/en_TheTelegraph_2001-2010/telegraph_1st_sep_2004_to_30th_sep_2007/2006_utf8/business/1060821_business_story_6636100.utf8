 US growth trend gives the jitters

 Dollar deals

 Scarcely had the scare over a rise in global inflation abated than a new fear has raised its ugly head the fear of a slowdown in US growth. Some US economists have even predicted that the US economy will plunge into recession, as the air goes out of the mortgage bubble and the American consumer, the Titan holding up the global economy all these years, finally collapses.

 These fears seem to have infected fund managers as well, if Merrill Lynchs global survey of fund managers for the month of August is any guide. The report finds the highest level of pessimism on the global economy ever since the survey began; the highest pessimism on the Asian economy since 2001 because of an expected slowdown in world trade; the third highest level of pessimism on global profits and the lowest level of risk appetite since March 2003. For emerging markets, apart from the bad news on risk appetite, the other negative factor is the finding that the percentage of fund managers considering going overweight on emerging markets in the next twelve months is the lowest since 2001. As BCA Research sums up, the economic risks are on the downside until some relief arrives, via lower bond yields, a weaker dollar and/or a sizeable energy correction. 

 The independent research house says that emerging market stocks are more correlated to US growth than to US interest rates and so lower growth will hurt them. It recommends shifting out of emerging market equities.

 But investors arent listening. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index has outperformed the World Index comfortably both this month and this quarter. Merrill Lynch, on the other hand, concludes from its survey that there are just too many bears for a selloff and says instead that the short-term contrarian call is for a bounce in emerging markets. 

 Fund flow data also indicate that money is flowing back into emerging market equities, a fact amply evident from the buying by FIIs in the local market.

 The other bit of good news that the Merrill survey unearths is that a third of fund managers are overweight on cash. This implies that favourable developments, like lower oil prices, should see some of that cash getting deployed. Its far from clear, however, what direction either growth or interest rates will take. Lending in Japan, for instance, is at a 10-year high. In the UK, economic growth accelerated in the three months to July. In Europe, the French economy is growing at the fastest rate in five years. Investment demand in India is robust, and if the RBI emulates the US Fed and stops its interest rate hikes, debt-fuelled consumer demand too should continue to be strong.

 Its also possible that investors are finally starting to discriminate between emerging markets. MSCIs BRIC index, for instance, for Brazil, Russia, India and China, is up 22.7 per cent this year against a rise of only 8.9 per cent for the broader emerging markets index.

 In short, itll be some time yet before the markets are able to make up their mind about growth and inflation. No wonder everybody in the markets expects a correction after the last rally. 

 Positive news that will signal the end of the correction will include evidence that the US is achieving a soft landing, oil prices are coming down, inflation is receding and lower bond yields.

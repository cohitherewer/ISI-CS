 Patel lists future growth areas

 Pune, April 8 (PTI): Agriculture and civil aviation are the new areas that hold great promise of growth in India after telephony and it will put the country on the path of economic progress, Union civil aviation minister Praful Patel said here today.

 Ever since it was liberalised in 1991... the Indian economy has evolved a great deal and things are looking better in one sector after another, Patel said in his convocation address at the Symbiosis Institute of International Business.

 It is now the turn of the civil aviation and agri-business sectors after telephony broadband to take India further to its objective of attaining economic self-sufficiency, the minister said.

 Reliance, Bharti and others have plans to invest thousands of crore of rupees in the agri-business. As far as civil aviation is concerned, some 30 to 40 lakh jobs would be created in this sector in another five to ten years, particularly for pilots and engineers, he said.

 The minister, however, said the country still needed huge investment in the field of civil aviation.

 We had recently ordered 111 aircraft for the Indian and Air-India for about $10 billion (Rs 45,000 crore), Patel said.

 Look at the kind of investment required in civil aviation here... compared with other countries we are nowhere in this sector. If there are 8,000 and 5,000 commercial planes flying in the US and western Europe respectively, the number in India is just 210, he said.

 Citing examples of Dubai and Singapore, he said a strong civil aviation industry could boost up the tourism sector.

 The real challenge before us was to build the infrastructure. Delhi and Mumbai do not make up India, the size, geography and population of which are both its weakness and strength. We want to build airports, cargo complexes, cold storage etc at as many places as possible and are also in the process to develop a grid, the civil aviation minister said.

 There is also a proposal to set up an integrated cargo complex in Nagpur, where cargoes from everywhere can be transhipped before being redistributed to their actual destinations, Patel said. 

 Though sometimes it looks like we are still stuck up with petty things like linguistic and caste issues, on the other hand we get to see a new India growing exponentially, the minister said. It is an exciting time to be in, especially for young students... It is right time to integrate our economy and think with the world. We cannot afford to live in isolation, Patel, who awarded degrees for the two-year post-graduate programmes in international business and agri-business management to 155 students, said.

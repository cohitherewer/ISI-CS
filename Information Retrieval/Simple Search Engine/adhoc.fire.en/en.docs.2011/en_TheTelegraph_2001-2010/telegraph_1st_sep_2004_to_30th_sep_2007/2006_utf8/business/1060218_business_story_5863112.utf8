 New Delhi, Feb. 17: Sebi chairman M. Damodaran is looking for an appropriate mechanism to resolve the conflict of interest between a corporate entity that owns a stock exchange and is also listed on the same bourse. 

 A stock exchange is the first place of regulation. We have to guard against undermining the role of compliance by a corporate entity who owns a stock exchange and is also listed, Damodaran said at the release of an Assocham report on valuation and ownership of stock exchanges.

 The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has formed a committee to go into the details of these issues. We expect the committee to submit its report within six to eight weeks, he said. 

 Stock exchanges after corporatisation have now become for-profit entities. This is bound clash with regulatory functions. The issue deals with the function as well as the sensitivity of information and the market positions of brokers, traders and clients.

 On the issue of allowing foreign direct investment in corporatised stock exchanges in India, Damodaran said it first needs to be decided whether the investor would be given voting rights or not.

 The Assocham study has recommended that FDI up to 49 per cent from entities related to the financial sector be permitted in stock exchanges. 

 The majority holding of 51 per cent would always remain with domestic entities, which would ensure that Indian entities control the bourses, the study said.

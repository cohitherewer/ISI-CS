 New procedures to hit M amp;As

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 At a cost

 Mumbai, Oct. 15: Mergers and acquisitions (M amp;As) take a long time to complete in India because of an elaborate procedure of acquiring approvals from shareholders, creditors, courts and regulators.

 It usually takes anywhere between three and six months to go through the entire rigmarole.

 But now the process could become a lot more complicated and more time consuming. Blame it all on a combination of provisions in the Competition Act 2002 and the Companies (Second Amendment) Act 2002, which will slow down the process of mergers considerably.

 Legal eagles say once the Competition Commission of India (CCI) and the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) become fully operational, merger practitioners will have to deal with a new set of procedures that will delay the consummation of merger deals.

 Cyril Shroff, partner, Amarchand Mangaldas, feels that in the existing structure, it takes three to six months to complete a merger/amalgamation or an acquisition. 

 But the six-month timetable may turn into a 30-month process, he warns. 

 For starters, the Companies (Second Amendment) Act 2002 got presidential assent in January 2003, but it hasnt been notified.

 Before this act could be notified, the legal validity of certain provisions relating to NCLT was challenged in Madras High Court, which asked for certain modifications.

 The high courts already overburdened with a huge volume of cases were unable to quickly wrap-up hearings relating to amalgamations and mergers. 

 The company law tribunal act was passed to take the burden off the courts.

 Similarly, matters were also pending with bodies like the Appellate Authority for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction and Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction. Therefore, the government constituted a committee headed by Justice V. B. Eradi to review these laws. After the committee made various recommendations, the Companies (Second Amendment) Act, which provides for setting up of NCLT, was tabled. 

 The NCLT is supposed to combine the work of the BIFR, the Company Law Board and the high courts. 

 Shroff avers that while the court process has worked well so far, the air of authority that it commands have worked in favour of various transactions. Moving away from a court process throws us into a different realm altogether. There is a fear as to how this process will pan out, who will manage the tribunal and so on, he adds. 

 The functions of the CCI, which was born after the Competition Act 2002 was enacted, are clearly defined. 

 While the CCI shall prohibit anti-competitive agreements and abuse of dominance, and regulate combinations (merger or amalgamation or acquisition) through a process of enquiry, it shall give opinion on competition issues on a reference received from an authority established under any law (statutory authority) or the central government.

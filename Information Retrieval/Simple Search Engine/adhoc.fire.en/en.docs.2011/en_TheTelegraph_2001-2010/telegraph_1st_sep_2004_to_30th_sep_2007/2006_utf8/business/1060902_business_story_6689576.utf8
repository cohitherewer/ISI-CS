 Alcatel plans to buy Nortel unit

 Paris, Sept. 1 (Reuters): Alcatel unveiled a preliminary agreement to buy Nortels third generation cell phone network unit for $320 million on Friday, aiming to achieve greater scale amid cut-throat price competition.

 The deal, which will help the French communications network provider push into tough markets such as China, comes as it tries to drum up investor support for its acquisition of US rival Lucent.

 Shareholders are to vote on the Lucent deal on Thursday.

 I think they got a reasonable price. But you are looking at putting together three different platforms so the execution of this is going to be a challenge, said Richard Windsor, analyst at Nomura in London.

 Alcatel, which is currently looking at how it will combine its mobile operations with those of Lucent, said it had signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding to buy Nortels UMTS radio access business (UTRAN) and related assets.

 It expected a significant majority of employees of Nortels business to be transferred to Alcatel and said the acquisition would give it 14 new UMTS customers.

 This is a key step in Alcatels strategy to further strengthen its UMTS market position, Alcatel said in a statement.

 Alcatel said the deal remained subject to the execution of a definitive agreement and closing conditions but it expected to complete it in the fourth quarter, the period during which it plans to wrap up its merger with Lucent.

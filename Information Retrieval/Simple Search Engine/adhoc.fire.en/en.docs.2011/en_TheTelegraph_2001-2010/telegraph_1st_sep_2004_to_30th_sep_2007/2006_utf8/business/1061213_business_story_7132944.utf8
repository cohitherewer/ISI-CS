 Hiring in east to remain buoyant

 SOHINI MOOKHERJEA

 Calcutta, Dec. 12: The employment outlook for the first quarter of 2007 in the east is buoyant at 28 per cent. However, it is way behind other regions, which all have an outlook of above 40 per cent.

 This was revealed by the Manpower employment outlook survey, which studies the hiring intentions of employers in services, finance, real estate, insurance, mining and manufacturing, oil and gas, transport and utilities and wholesale and retail trade for the first quarter of 2007.

 Though the eastern region outlook at 28 per cent is lagging behind other regions, the first quarter of a year is usually slow as hiring plans are drawn up but are not confirmed, said Soumen Basu, executive chairman of Manpower India.

 The net employment outlook is the difference between the percentage of employers expecting an increase in total employment and the percentage expecting a decrease.

 The 28 per cent outlook in the eastern region represents a dip of nine percentage points from that for the previous quarter and three percentage points from the same quarter last year.

 The resurgence of manufacturing in the east and the spurt in IT and IT-enabled services are evident as the survey shows maximum activity in these two sectors.

 Of the 4,742 employers surveyed nationally, 41 per cent expect an increase in hiring in the first quarter of 2007, 2 per cent anticipate a decline and 50 per cent expect no change. 

 Mining and construction firms have increased their quarter-over-quarter net employment outlook by five percentage points. The outlook for the public administration and education sector reduced by nine percentage points from the previous quarter.

 In the east, 868 employers were surveyed. Of them, 31 per cent felt that there would be an increase in hiring tendencies and only 3 per cent predicted a decline. Around 62 per cent felt there would be no change while 4 per cent were unsure about their hiring plans.

 Even though a large percentage of employers in the east are optimistic about hiring more in the next quarter, the number of employers who do intend to hire has decreased by 15 percentage points from that in the previous quarter.

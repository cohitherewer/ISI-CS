 Adlabs to list FM outfit

 New Delhi, April 23 (PTI): Anil Ambani-controlled Adlabs Films Ltd (AFL) today approved the demerger of its FM radio business and announced that the new entity would be listed on the stock exchanges.

 The board of directors approved the proposal for demerger of the FM radio business to a wholly-owned subsidiary, SPV, the company said.

 Under the scheme, SPV would issue shares to all shareholders of Adlabs in the ratio of two free shares of the SPV for every one share of AFL.

 The demerged company is proposed to be separately listed on the BSE and NSE to provide liquidity to all the shareholders. The demerger will not have any impact on the share capital of AFL, the company said.

 The board also approved the amalgamation/merger of two subsidiaries of AFL ? Entertainment One (India) Ltd and Mukta Adlabs Digital Exhibition Pvt Ltd ? with the company. The demerger is subject to approvals from shareholders, regulatory authorities and the high court.

 Adlabs said the demerger would benefit the company by creating an independent focussed organisation to lead the FM radio business.

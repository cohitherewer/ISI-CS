 Q amp;A

 Joint venture

 If an NSC is purchased in joint names who will claim the tax benefits of the full amount? 

 D. Mohanty, Rourkela

 If both the account holders are working, both can claim tax deduction on a 50:50 basis. But if the second account holder is your non-working spouse, you can claim the tax deduction on the entire investment.

 Brother, brother

 Im a senior citizen and file income tax returns every year, though I dont have any tax liability. I want to gift my unemployed younger brother Rs 25,000 every year. He will invest it in post office monthly income scheme. Do I have to pay any income tax of the POMIS interest income by my brother?

 Narendra Lal Kundu, Hooghly

 You can gift the amount to your brother and for this you dont have to pay any tax. Neither do you have to pay any income tax on the interest earned by your brother from the POMIS. As your brother is unemployed, his annual income must be less than Rs 1 lakh and his interest income will not be taxable either.

 Points to ponder

 Is a PPF with the post office taxable under the present finance act? I shall attain 65 years in October 2007 and my annual income is unlikely to cross Rs 1,85,000 in future. Do I have to file income tax returns in the next year?

 Basudeb Sarkar, Konnagar

 vestment in public provident fund made either through banks or through post offices is tax exempt at all stages. Investment, accrued interest and withdrawals are all tax exempt. From the next assessment year, i.e., 2007-08, you dont have to file income tax returns.

 Lost shares

 I had bought some shares and debentures from PAL Peugeot, which are not tradable anymore. What can I do?

 S. Malakar, Shillong

 The stock has been debarred from trading on the stock exchanges from 1999 as the company became defunct. Since the company doesnt exist anymore you cannot do anything about those shares.

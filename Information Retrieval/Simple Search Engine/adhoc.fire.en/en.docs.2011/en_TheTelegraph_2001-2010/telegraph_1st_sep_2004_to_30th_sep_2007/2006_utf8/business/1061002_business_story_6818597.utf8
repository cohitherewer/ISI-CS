 Cement prices set to trek north

 Demand drive

 Mumbai, Oct. 1: The cement industry is on a roll. 

 A strong uptrend in prices is projected as demand escalates after the monsoons.

 Industry circles feel that from this month cement prices may regularly firm up by Rs 3-5 per bag because of a strong demand. 

 We are likely to see frequent price increases from here on. There could be a hike every 15 days or so, says a source. 

 The projections are for a growth of 10 per cent by the end of this fiscal, against an average of 8 per cent growth in the previous years.

 There are two reasons for this bullish outlook. 

 The industry, which has in the past seen excess supply, is not in such a situation now. While demand is expected to remain firm, fresh capacity addition will not occur till 2008.

 There could be a reversal of the cycle by 2009. But one must remember that though many capacities will come up by that time, demand may also rise as some special economic zones (SEZs) will take shape. However, at this point of time, what will happen by 2009 on the price front remains hazy, adds a cement analyst of a domestic brokerage.

 Estimates say that close to 50 million tonnes could be added to the existing capacity after three years, with both greenfield and other expansions coming on stream. 

 French construction group Lafarge has already announced its intention of setting up a 3-million-tonne unit at an investment of over $200 million. 

 The AV Birla group, ACC and Gujarat Ambuja are also expected to come up with increased capacities. The industry now has an installed capacity of over 160 million tonnes.

 Demand for the commodity is usually weak during the monsoon season as construction activities take a break. However, during the current calendar year, cement prices have been on an upward trajectory.

 Sources said prices have firmed up on an average by Rs 32 per bag between January and June. 

 When compared with the same period last year, cement is expensive by Rs 50. For August too, average prices stood at Rs 200 per bag, a gain of Rs 40 on a year-on-year basis.. 

 Prices increased across all the four regions during this period.

 The stock markets have been scooping up cement stocks over the past few trading sessions. Brokerages across the board are also bullish on their outlook for the industry.

 Cement prices have remained remarkably resilient during the monsoon season of 2006 and have come down by barely 2 per cent since June 2006, says a CLSA report. 

 The report adds that as construction activities in India pick up after the monsoon season, cement prices will rise further with possible shortages emerging during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. 

 We have raised earnings estimates for cement companies by 5-20 per cent, CLSA said.

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 22: BIL International, the holding company of UKs leading hospitality chain Thistle Hotels, is planning to enter India with its international brand, Guoman Hotels.

 The company today formally announced its tie-up with the Nijhawan Group, appointing the latter as its sales and marketing representative in India. The group will also be the Indian marketing representative for Thistles UAE partner, Rotana Hotels.

 To begin with, we want to be present in at least four big cities at one time. Our consultants are working on the India plan. We are looking at Bangalore, Mumbai, Delhi and Chennai. A decision will be taken by the end of this year, said Sanjay Nijhawan, area general manager, Thistle Hotels. 

 The group will be present in both four star deluxe and five star categories, he said.

 Nijhawan, however, declined to comment on the quantum of investment. 

 We are a private company, so we cannot disclose our investments. But funds are not an issue, he said.

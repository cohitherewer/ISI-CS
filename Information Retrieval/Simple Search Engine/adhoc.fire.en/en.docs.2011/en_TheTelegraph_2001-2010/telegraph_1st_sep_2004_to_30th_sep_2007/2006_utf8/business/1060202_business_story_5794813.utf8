 Borrowers feel rate pinch

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Feb. 1: Retail borrowers will soon have to brace for a round of rate hikes. After the Housing and Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) raised home loan rates yesterday by half a percentage point, IDBI followed suit with a 25 basis point hike today. There are indications that other private sector and select nationalised banks will raise rates over the next few days. 

 Other major banks in the country, including State Bank of India (SBI) and ICICI Bank, have indicated that they are also closely watching the developments and are expected to announce their stance on lending rates by this weekend. 

 SBI managing director T.S. Bhattacharya said the bank would hold a meeting on February 4 to decide on any revision in home loan rates.

 The rate increases come soon after the Reserve Bank of India raised the short-term reverse repo (the rate at which it mops up surplus liquidity) and repo (rate at which it infuses liquidity) by 25 basis points each and signalled an upward movement in interest rates. 

 HDFC had hinted in the recent past that it would raise interest on housing loans as its cost of borrowings had shot up. 

 Although public sector banks have for now maintained that there will be no change in interest rates on retail loans, banking industry sources do not rule out the possibility if major banks choose to follow HDFC and IDBI Bank in order to maintain the spread between their borrowings and lendings.

 Public sector banks, it may be recalled, recently raised interest rates on domestic term deposits.

 HDFC raised its home loan rates by 0.5 per cent across the board with effect from today. HDFC officials said the rates had been increased to maintain the margin between lending and deposit rates. 

 The financial institution has also increased its deposit rates by 0.25 to 0.5 per cent.

 According to the new rate regime, a fixed-rate home loan will bear an interest of 9.25 per cent to 10.5 per cent depending on the loan amount, while the floating rate will vary between 8 per cent and 8.75 per cent. 

 While announcing the rate hike, IDBI chairman V.P. Shetty said the realignment was done to reduce the gap in yield and cost. 

 SBI chairman A.K. Purwar had earlier hinted at a hike in retail lending rates in view of the tight liquidity in the market. 

 However, Punjab National Bank has ruled out any change in retail lending rates till March. 

 UTI Bank retail head Hemant Kaul said the bank was constantly evaluating the scenario. However, they have not yet taken any final decision. HSBC is also watching the developments.

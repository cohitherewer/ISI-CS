 Calcutta, April 11: Bankers are willing to lend more to small and medium enterprises provided they get themselves rated by credit rating agencies.

 Public sector banks have been asked by the Union finance ministry to double their credit flows to the SME sector in the next five years. This means PSU banks should increase their lending to the SME sector to Rs 1,35,000 crore by 2009-10 and to Rs 1,00,000 crore in 2006-07 itself, said United Bank of India executive director Sunanda Lahiri speaking at a CII-organised conference here today. 

 Banks are willing to lend more but they insist that the SMEs get their credit-worthiness rated by some agency. The Small Industries Development Bank of India (Sidbi) has co-promoted the SME Credit Rating Agency (SMERA) in partnership with Dun amp; Bradstreet and other public sector and private sector banks. Almost all PSU banks have already tied up with SMERA to rate their SME borrowers and are even partly bearing the cost for the same. The banks are also offering a discounted rate of interest to SMEs with higher ratings. 

 A rated SME will not only be able to get a bargain rate of interest and hence reduce their cost of finances, they can also leverage this credit rating to attract venture capital or private equity funds, said ICICI Bank SME head Vijay Chandok.

 Banks have been lending the SMEs working capital, measured at 20 per cent of the total turnover of an enterprise, up to Rs 5 crore. However, things are changing. Banks are now ready with more loan products, including term-loan, to cater to the SME sector. 

 Banks are focusing more on SMEs not only because it is a regulatory obligation, it also makes more business sense, said Uco Bank planning and development deputy general manager Prabir K. Dutta. The loan recovery rate for the SME segment is better than that in other sectors. Besides, bankers are realising that concentrating only on big corporate borrowers leads to lopsided capital risks. Hence, a diversification of their borrowers portfolio by including more SMEs will result in risk-reduction before the implementation of the Basel II norms, he added.

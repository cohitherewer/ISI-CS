 Chartered institute holds out hope for inter students

 SRIKUMAR BONDYOPADHYAY

 Calcutta, July 7: Students enrolling for chartered accountancy and completing the intermediate stage will no longer be confined to articleship if ICAIs plan to award an official degree to these students takes shape.

 According to ICAI president T.N. Manoharan, the institute is considering the feasibility of awarding a degree to those who have passed the intermediate but not the final exams.

 Every year, more than 7,000 students enrol themselves, but only around 3,000 graduate and become qualified chartered accountants. The others drop out after the intermediate stage without any official degree.

 They (those who drop out after the intermediate stage) can take up articleship now. But without an ICAI official degree, they cannot be employed as professional accountants, said Sumantra Guha, a former president of ICAI eastern regional council.

 If the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) can give an intermediate degree, these students can be employed better and their services can also be exported, said Rahul Bose, a chartered accountant in Ernst amp; Young.

 Outsourcing of accountancy services by developed countries from India and other south Asian countries are increasing. The institutes in Pakistan and Sri Lanka are giving an Accountant Technician degree to students who have passed the intermediate stage, but not the finals of chartered accountancy. The services of accountant technicians have thus been made exportable. We should do similar things here too, Bose said.

 An official degree for students who have cleared their intermediate exams was deliberated by the central council members one-and-a-half years ago. But the idea was shelved, said Abhijit Bandyopadhyay, member, central council, ICAI. The demand is now being raised again from many quarters. The central council is most likely to consider the issue again soon, he added.

 ICAI will soon come out with an accounting standard for financial instruments, including derivatives. 

 The draft of the accounting standards will be put up for consultation in September. The final draft will be ready by December-January, Manoharan said.

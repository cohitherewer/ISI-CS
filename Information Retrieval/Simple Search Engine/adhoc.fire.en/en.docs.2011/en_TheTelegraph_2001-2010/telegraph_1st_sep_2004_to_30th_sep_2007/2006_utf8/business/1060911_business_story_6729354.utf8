 US outfits preferred catch for India Inc

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 10: The US is the most preferred destination for overseas acquisitions by Indian companies, accounting for investments worth $225 million between April 2005 and January 2006.

 This has been highlighted in a report jointly prepared by consultancy and audit firm Ernst amp; Young and the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci) based on RBI data.

 A break-up of the acquisitions made in the US between 2004 and 2006 shows that the software and BPO sector accounted for the largest share at 58 per cent.

 This was followed by the healthcare sector comprising pharmaceuticals, biotech and healthcare services, which accounted for 17 per cent of the deals.

 The remaining 25 per cent of the acquisitions were in telecom, textiles, automotive and financial services. 

 Indian enterprises have contributed significantly to the US economy. They are no longer just outsourcing partners. Indian companies are assisting in enhancing productivity, managerial talents and bailing out bankrupt American companies, the report said.

 India Incs investments also increased exports and provided a global platform to small and mid-sized companies.

 According to the report, key decision drivers for investing in the US are access to foreign markets, accessibility of funds and production facilities, presence of strong regional clusters in the US and access to technology.

 Not only are Indian companies creating jobs and boosting wages, investments from India are strengthening US manufacturing and contributing to rising productivity. Indian investments bring in managerial talent, provide quality training and help US companies penetrate foreign markets, it added.

 Indian investments in US companies give them access to the distribution network of these multinationals and knowledge about local tastes, enabling them to increase exports to newer markets.

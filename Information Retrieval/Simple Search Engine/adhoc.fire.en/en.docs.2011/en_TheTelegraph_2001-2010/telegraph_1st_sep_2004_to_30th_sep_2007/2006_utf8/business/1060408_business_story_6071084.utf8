 BAE keen to fly out of Airbus nest

 Exit plans

 London, April 7 (Reuters): BAE Systems Plc, Europes biggest defence firm, said on Friday it was in talks to sell its 20 per cent stake in Airbus to Franco-German-Spanish firm EADS, which owns the rest of the planemaker.

 Discussions are at an early stage and a further announcement will be made if and when appropriate, BAE said in a brief statement to the London Stock Exchange.

 We believe that now is the right time for us to divest our Airbus shareholding to allow us to concentrate on our core transatlantic defence and aerospace strategy, BAE chief executive Mike Turner said. The statement came a day after the BBC had reported that BAE planned to sell the stake in order to expand its US defence business.

 The stake is valued at 3.5 billion euros in EADS books but analysts expect any sale to be worth ?3 billion to ?4.5 billion ($5.26 billion-$7.88 billion), buoyed in part by the current high level of EADS and BAE share prices.

 Sector analysts have said BAE was expected to sell its stake in civilian airliner maker Airbus at some stage, likely spending the proceeds in the US defence sector.

 Disposal of Airbus (and BAEs remaining European interests) could clear the way for a major US merger, Numis Securities analyst Andrew Gollan said in a research note. BAEs Turner is due to meet the head of Britains department of trade and industry today regarding the Airbus stake sale, the BBC reported.

 There has been no announcement and, therefore, it would be inappropriate to comment, a ministry spokeswoman said. 

 Political concerns

 The deal could provoke political concerns about keeping Airbuss wing-making technology as well as some 13,000 Airbus jobs in Britain, concerns which EADS and Airbus said were without basis.

 We are fully committed to 

 the UK and to Airbus highly skilled employees, 

 said an Airbus spokeswoman, noting its UK facilities are 

 already owned by Airbus, not BAE.

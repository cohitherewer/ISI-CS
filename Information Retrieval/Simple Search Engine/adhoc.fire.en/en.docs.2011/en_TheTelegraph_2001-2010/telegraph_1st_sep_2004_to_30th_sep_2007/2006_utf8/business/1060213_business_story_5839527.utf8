 BK Group cements Northeast unit plan

 SAMBIT SAHA

 ON THE MOVE

 Calcutta, Feb. 12: Calcutta-based BK Group will set up the largest cement plant of the Northeast in Assam.

 The unit would have a capacity of 1.5 million tonnes, higher than the combined installed capacity of all other existing cement plants.

 The group now has a 3-lakh-tonne unit in Assam called Vinay Cement and it is notable among the local players. The demand in the Northeast market is pegged at 3.1 million tonnes with an annual growth of 12-15 per cent.

 Close to 70 per cent of the requirement is met from outside supply and as a result, the cement prices are the highest in the Northeast.

 French multinational Lafarge, the largest cement player in the world, has the biggest market share there even though it does not have any unit in the Northeast. Total local capacity adds up to 1.3 mt with no national players being present there.

 We hope to cash in on the demand-supply mismatch in the region. The demand is set to grow much faster if the proposed hydel and road projects take off, Ritesh Bawri, executive director of Calcom Cement India Ltd, said.

 Calcom is the special purpose vehicle created by the group to execute the Rs 414-crore project where the government of Assam and private equity ILFS Trust Company Ltd have picked up stakes.

 The project is being developed in a split location basis with the clinker and the grinding units at different places. The clinker unit is located at Umrangsho, close to a limestone mine.

 The grinding unit at Lanka is close to a railway line and the proposed East West Highway. The project is being financed at a debt-equity ratio of 1:1.8. The company has been able to tie up the debt portion of Rs 268 crore.

 It has also arranged about Rs 76 crore of equity through promoters contribution, ILFT and the Assam government.

 We are exploring the options of private equity and an initial public offering (IPO) to raise the equity, Bawri said adding the decision would be taken in the next 3-45 days.

 The commercial production from the unit is expected to start by March 2007. It has started placing orders for machinery. In the first year of full commercial production, the company is expecting a 70 per cent capacity utilisation. A turnover of Rs 395 crore in the first year and Rs 552 crore have been projected by the management.

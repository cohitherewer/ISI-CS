 Guessing game on market mood

 How will the market behave after the budget? Brokerages have been busy studying how the markets fared after earlier budgets. 

 Kotak Securities, for instance, points out that the BSE sensex has fallen for six consecutive years in March, starting from March 2000. While the average gain for the sensex in these years has been 2.2 per cent in February, March has seen an average loss of 6.3 per cent. 

 Refco Research has done an analysis of pre- and post-budget sensex returns from 1991-92 onwards. They find that the sensex had a pre-budget rally eight times, while it went down before the budget in the remaining eight.

 Post-budget, the sensex moved up on six occasions while it gave negative returns on 10 occasions. In the eight years, which had a pre-budget rally, the market declined after the budget four times while it continued to go up in the remaining four occasions. 

 Merrill Lynchs analysis finds that of the 13 budgets from 1993 onwards, the sensex gave negative returns on seven occasions a week after the budget, on 10 occasions a month after the budget and after nine budgets the negative returns persisted even three months later.

 But, as they say, the past is no guide to the future. Consider the current fundamentals. Valuations are high, market breadth has been lacking, corporate earnings growth is slowing down, interest rates are rising and theres a huge supply of IPOs hitting the market with fresh paper. In spite of plenty of FII money coming in, the market is reluctant to go higher. In short, its a tired market. 

 For all these reasons, market players mostly believe that the budget will be used as an excuse to sell. Not because its likely to cause any major disappointment, but simply because players would use the opportunity to book profits.

 Reliance Communications

 All eyes are on Reliance Communications Ventures (RCoVL), which will probably be listed on March 6. 

 The Anil Ambani group has released the proforma results of Reliance Communications Ventures for the December quarter, which adds up the numbers for Reliance Infocomm Ltd, Reliance Communications Infrastructure Ltd, FLAG Telecom and Reliance Telecom. 

 The results show a turnaround from a negative profit after tax of Rs 250 crore in the first quarter and Rs 18 crore in the second quarter to a net profit of Rs 310 crore in the third quarter. Its obviously a signal to the market.

 Compared with Bhartis December quarter revenues of Rs 3,026 crore, the Reliance telcos garnered revenues of Rs 3,327 crore. But while Bhartis operating margin was 37 per cent, RCoVLs was 25.5 per cent. Thats why RCoVLs net profit was Rs 310 crore compared with Bhartis Rs 545 crore. Net margin was 9.3 per cent for RCoVL and 18 per cent for Bharti. Clearly, RCoVLs valuations should be at a substantial discount to Bhartis, more or less at the 35 per cent discount that analysts have been estimating.

 The other signal lies in the announcement that Reliance Infocomm and Reliance Communications Infrastructure have seen a write-off of Rs 4,500 crore on account of bad debts and slow-moving inventory. While this cleans up the balance sheet, the lower valuation of these two companies will impact their merger ratio with Reliance Telecom. That in turn will affect the public shareholding in RCoVL, because the telecom companies that will be merged into RCoVL have different levels of public holding. 

 Reliance Infocomm, for example, has a higher public holding and the lower its valuation, the lower the public holding in the final merged entity.

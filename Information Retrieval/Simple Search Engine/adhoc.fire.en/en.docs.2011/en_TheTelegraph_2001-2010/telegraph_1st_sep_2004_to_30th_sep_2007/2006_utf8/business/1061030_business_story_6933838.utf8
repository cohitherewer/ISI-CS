 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 29: The apex industry chambers have prepared their wishlist and and started lobbying with the government for incentives in the union budget 2007-08 which is due in another four months. 

 In a precursor to the pre-budget memorandum, the industry has asked the government to come up with a phased withdrawal of central sales tax (CST) before 2009.

 CST should be lowered by 100 basis points every six months. The government should come up with a clear direction on the entry tax policy to be adopted by the states post-CST and spell out how it will merge with VAT. Also, the ceiling with respective upper and lower limit rates for various products and documentation required under zero CST, the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci) has stated in its recommendations.

 ONGC braves subsidy spill

 New Delhi, April 16: The Oil and Natural Gas Corporation has reaped the benefits of the crude price rally in 2005-06. Despite having to shoulder a subsidy bill of nearly Rs 12,000 crore, the company has clocked a net profit of Rs 14,175 crore during the year.

 Taking stock of ONGCs provisional unaudited results here today, chairman Subir Raha said earnings have gone up by 9 per cent from Rs 12,983 crore registered in the previous fiscal. Turnover also increased 9 per cent to Rs 50,900 crore from Rs 46,712 crore in 2004-05.

 The average price of ONGC crude during the fiscal was $42 per barrel after a discount of $23 per barrel to the national oil companies as subsidy towards LPG and kerosene.

 The average price of crude realised by the company in 2004-05 was $37 per barrel after a discount of $4 per barrel.

 However, ONGCs crude output in 2005-06 at 24.4 million tonnes (mt) was lower than the target of 26.6 mt because of the fire that gutted the offshore Mumbai High North platform. 

 The ONGC group, which also includes ONGC-Videsh (OVL) and Mangalore Refineries and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL), has clocked a 6 per cent rise in net profit at Rs 15,485 crore. 

 Raha said MRPLs net profit actually declined to Rs 380 crore from Rs 880 crore in the previous fiscal because of a freeze on prices of LPG, kerosene, diesel and petrol by Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum. This is unfair and ONGC has taken up the issue with the petroleum ministry, he added.

 The turnover of MRPL has gone up by 36.3 per cent to Rs 28,214 crore and its capacity utilisation was 125 per cent.

 Raha said OVL has recorded a 22 per cent rise in net profit at Rs 930 crore on a turnover of Rs 7,600 crore.

 LKB-Centurion swap ratio fixed at 5:7

 OUR BUREAU

 Sept. 4: A swap ratio of 5:7 has been proposed for the merger of Lord Krishna Bank (LKB) with Centurion Bank of Punjab. 

 Centurion Bank of Punjab also plans to raise funds up to Rs 422 crore through a preferential issue. The issue will see ICICI Ventures holding a 4.5 per cent and Bank Muscat a 20 per cent stake post-allotment in the merged entity. 

 Centurion said the additional capital would enable the bank to maintain a strong capital position and provide the support that the bank needs to ensure accelerated growth. 

 The merger proposal was approved by the boards of both banks today. Although there is no cash consideration involved (the merger has been done through the swap route), the deal is valued at over Rs 342 crore. LKB shareholders with five shares will receive seven shares of Centurion. 

 Rana Talwar will be the chairman and Shailendra Bhandari the managing director and chief executive officer of the merged entity. Mohan Puri, who will have some stake in the merged entity, will join the board of CBoP, subject to regulatory approvals. 

 Centurion chairman Rana Talwar said: The proposed merger with LKB firmly establishesCenturion Bank of Punjabs role as an industry consolidator. The merger of Bank of Punjab with the erstwhile Centurion Bank has been an unqualified success. We are confident that the proposed merger will accelerate the banks growth momentum and help it become the best full service bank in the country. 

 LKB director Mohan Puri added: The proposed merger is in the best interest of all stake holder-customers, employees and shareholders as all of them would greatly benefit from being part of a larger, rapidly growing bank. 

 According to Shailendra Bhandari, managing director and CEO of Centurion Bank of Punjab, the merger will provide the bank with an opportunity to build on its strengths in Kerala and the rest of India. Centurion has 14 branches in Kerala. 

 The banks have no plans to retrench staff or close any of the rural branches. The scheme of amalgamation provides for a one-time increment to all existing employees of LKB.

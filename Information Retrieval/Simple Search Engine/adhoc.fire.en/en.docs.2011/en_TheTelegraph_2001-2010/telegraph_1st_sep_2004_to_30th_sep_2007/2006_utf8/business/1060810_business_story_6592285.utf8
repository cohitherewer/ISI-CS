 India boosts Aviva half-yearly profit

 Door of Fortune

 London, Aug. 9 (Agencies): Outsourcing to India has enabled insurance major Aviva, the worlds fifth largest insurer, to register an operating profit of 1.699 billion for the six months till June 30, 2006.

 The operating profit was 27 per cent higher than the 1.318 billion achieved in the six months till June 30, 2005, it was officially announced today.

 Besides outsourcing, strong performance across all businesses and geographies was attributed to the outstanding result.

 Asia as a whole accounted for 386 million profit during the period a growth of 80 per cent, it said. 

 Aviva, under pressure to show growth after UK rival Prudential rebuffed its merger approach in March, also benefited from UK pension reforms, which encouraged consumers to save more, and from favourable weather and the integration of motor services firm RAC in its general insurance business. 

 These are record interim results a high-growth business firing on all cylinders, with plenty more gas in the tank, chief executive Richard Harvey said in a conference call. 

 The results are pretty much in line, if not slightly better than they had guided at the time of the AmerUs deal, said analyst Mikir Shah at Fox-Pitt, Kelton. 

 These are probably peak earnings for the non-life business. You cant expect the combined ratio to improve any further from here, he added.

 The insurer posted its best ever combined operating ratio costs and claims as a percentage of premiums of 92 per cent, well ahead of its stated 98 per cent target. A figure below 100 per cent indicates a profit.

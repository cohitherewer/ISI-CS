 Mutuals trio to manage selloff money

 GAURAV CHOUDHURY

 New Delhi, April 16: The top three public sector asset management firms ? SBI Mutual Fund, UTI Mutual Fund and LIC Mutual Fund ? will manage the money proposed to be raised from the sale of government equity in PSUs.

 The three companies have been selected as fund managers for the recently constituted National Investment Fund (NIF). 

 The funds raised by selling the Centres stake in state-owned firms will be parked with the NIF.

 Sources said the government appointed several fund managers so as to preserve the competitive spirit between fund managers and provide comparative performance yardsticks for the evaluation of fund managers.

 The allocation of funds to these asset management companies will be decided by the chief executive officer of the NIF, based on the suggestions of an advisory board.

 A part-time advisory board for the NIF has already been constituted. Its members are, S.B. Mathur, former chairman of LIC; B.D. Narang, former CMD of Oriental Bank of Commerce, and D.H. Pai Panandiker, president of the RPG Foundation.

 The NIF is yet to appoint a CEO, who would be selected through the central staffing scheme. 

 The CEO, who would be a bureaucrat, would have a supervisory role. While selecting an officer for this post, the persons qualifications and experience would be kept in view, sources said.

 While 75 per cent of the annual income of the fund will be used to finance selected social sector schemes, mainly in health and education, the remaining 25 per cent will be used to meet capital investment requirements of central public sector enterprises that can be revived.

 Sources said the government was setting up appropriate mechanisms to review regularly and monitor the functions of the National Investment Fund.

 The system of audit will be incorporated in agreements to be entered with fund managers, sources said.

 The fund managers will manage the funds under the discretionary mode of the portfolio management scheme laid out in the Securities and Exchange Board of Indias guidelines.

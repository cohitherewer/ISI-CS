 Anil firms clear air on fractional shares

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, April 26: The Anil Ambani group has assuaged shareholders fears about the fate of odd lots or fractional shares that will result from the merger of four group companies by saying that they will consolidate these shares and offload them in the market. The proceeds will later be distributed pro rata among eligible shareholders.

 While Reliance Capital Ventures Ltd (RCVL) is proposed to be amalgamated with Reliance Capital Ltd (RCL), Reliance Energy Ventures Ltd (RVL) is set to be merged with Reliance Energy Ltd (RCL).

 For the merger of RCVL with RCL, a share exchange ratio of five shares of RCL for every 100 in RCVL has been proposed. Similarly, a swap ratio of 7.5 shares of REL for every 100 shares of REVL has been recommended for the amalgamation of these two companies.

 RCVL and REVL are the twin entities among the four that came up as a result of the split in the Reliance empire.

 Shareholders of RIL got one share each of these four companies for every share they held. However, the swap ratio proposed for the merger of RCVL and RCL and REL led to the possibility of fractional shares. For instance, a shareholder of RIL who has 100 shares of each of these four demerged entities will get 7.5 shares of REL after the merger goes through.

 Concerns about these fractional shares were seen among shareholders at the extraordinary general meetings (EGM) of both RCVL and REVL today. Many of them wanted to know if the two companies would compensate for such fractional shares or combine them and later offload in the equity markets.

 Allaying these worries, company secretary Mohan Shenoy said all such fractional shares would be consolidated and disposed of in the markets. The net proceeds will be distributed among eligible shareholders.

 Three EGMs were held by the Reliance-Anil Dhirubhai Ambani group in Mumbai today to secure shareholders approvals for the merger of REVL with REL and RCVL with RCL.

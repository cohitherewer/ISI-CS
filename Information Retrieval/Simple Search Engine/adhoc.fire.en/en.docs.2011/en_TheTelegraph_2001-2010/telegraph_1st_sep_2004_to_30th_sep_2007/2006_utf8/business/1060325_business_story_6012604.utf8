 Bonds come in handy for Indian Oil

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, March 24: Indian Oil Corporation expects to end this fiscal at the same level of profit as last year (Rs 4,800 crore) after it received its second tranche of bonds worth Rs 3,542.95 crore from the government on Thursday. 

 However, under-recoveries or net revenue loss of Rs 5,000 crore on petrol, diesel, LPG and kerosene will prevent the company from maximising its profit on a higher sales turnover.

 IOC had a sales turnover of Rs 1,50,000 crore in 2004-05 and expects to end the current fiscal with a turnover of around Rs 1,80,000 crore.

 IOC director-finance S.V. Narasimhan said the revenue lost on the transport and cooking fuels would amount to Rs 1,700 crore for the month of March.

 The second tranche of bonds, which comes close on the heels of the first tranche issued earlier this month, has also gone to Hindustan Petroleum and Bharat Petroleum. The two companies received bonds worth Rs 1,144.74 crore and Rs 1,062.31 crore, respectively. 

 Narasimhan said the oil companies were losing Rs 2.40 per litre on petrol and Rs 4.40 per litre on diesel as domestic fuel prices have not been raised to match international rates.

 The major blow came from LPG, which was being sold at Rs 245 per cylinder below the actual price and kerosene, which was being sold at Rs 13.75 per litre below its real price. 

 IOCs borrowings have risen from about Rs 17,000 crore in March 2005 to Rs 25,000 crore by the end of this fiscal, Narasimhan said.

 IOC chairman Sarthak Behuria has said that the cash-strapped company would be selling these bonds in the market to raise funds to meet its tax obligations and repay its debt. 

 Meanwhile, IOC has also signed its annual MoU with the petroleum ministry for the financial and physical performance targets for 2006-07. The company has received an excellent rating for 2005-06, which shows that the government has taken into account the compulsions of the company. 

 According to an IOC statement, While financial performance, including gross sales and profit, as well as throughput of both refineries and product pipelines continue to be the key parameters, project implementation has been given due weightage in the context of the large capital investments planned by the company.

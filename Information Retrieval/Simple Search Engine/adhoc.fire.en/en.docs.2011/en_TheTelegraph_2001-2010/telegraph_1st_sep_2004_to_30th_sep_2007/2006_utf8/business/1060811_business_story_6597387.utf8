 Calcutta, Aug. 10: Volvo India Private Limited will outsource automotive components worth 70 million euros to its global operations this year.

 Of these, 75 per cent will comprise forgings and castings. Volvos sourcing from India has grown by 40 per cent over last year.

 Sourcing of Indian auto components, especially high technology ones, for Volvos global operations has been steadily increasing over the years. However, the forging and casting units are still scattered in the country. The formation of special economic zones would help form clusters and consolidate them. India has an edge over China in terms of outsourcing high technology components to Volvo globally, said Eric Leblanc, managing director of Volvo India.

 Of the 560,000 heavy-duty trucks sold globally in a year, one third by volume is sold in Asia. So it makes perfect sense for us to form a platform for component sourcing companies from India and China, said Mansoor Ahmed, vice-president-marketing, Volvo India.

 To bring down the cost of vehicles, Volvo needs to cut down its component cost by at least 30 per cent than that prevailing in Europe and the US.

 The company has an installed capacity of 1,200 units, including cars and trucks, and sold 600 trucks and 400 buses last year.

 Volvo India would double its volume by adding another shift in the next two years.

 A little over 30 per cent of a truck and around 20 per cent of a bus are indigenously built.

 Between 120 and 150 units are exported every year to Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.

 The eastern region comprises 25 per cent of the companys heavy-duty truck sales.

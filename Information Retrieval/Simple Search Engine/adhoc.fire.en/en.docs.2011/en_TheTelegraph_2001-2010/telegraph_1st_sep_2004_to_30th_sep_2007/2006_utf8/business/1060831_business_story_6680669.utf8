 Hind Lever sells close to 2% of Tata Chem 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Aug. 30: Tata Sons, the holding company of the Tata group, today acquired close to 2 per cent of Tata Chemicals from Hindustan Lever (HLL) through a block deal on the bourses today. 

 The deal will raise the Tata group stake in Tata Chemicals to over 30 per cent.

 The block deal saw HLL selling 42.50 lakh Tata Chemicals shares to Tata Sons at Rs 222.10 per share, putting the transaction value at around Rs 94 crore. 

 HLL held 5.55 per cent of Tata Chemicals equity or over 1.19 crore shares as on June 30. The Tata group controlled over 28.62 per cent through Tata Sons, Tata Investment Corporation, Voltas, Tata Coffee and 12 others. Tata Sons alone owned 12.31 per cent.

 Recently, chairman Ratan Tata told shareholders of Tata Tea that the group is keen to raise its stake in the company. The Tatas hold 28.60 per cent in Tata Tea through Tata Sons, Tata Investment and Tata Chemcials.

 In July, the board of Tata Steel had approved a proposal to offer, on a preferential basis, securities to Tata Sons. It offered 2,70,00,000 shares at Rs 516 per share (involving an amount of Rs 1,393.20 crore), apart from 2,85,00,000 warrants, where each warrant would entitle Tata Sons to subscribe to one share of the company against payment in cash.

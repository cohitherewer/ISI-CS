 Closed funds rule roost

 CHANDRALEKHA TULAL

 Cash woes

 Mumbai, July 30: With the stock markets badly pummelled in the last few months, the flow of new mutual fund schemes have started to dry up.

 Even more telling is the sudden and curious absence of open-end mutual fund schemes. They have now been replaced by three-year closed-end schemes in all the major categories: diversified equity, hybrid or other speciality schemes. 

 Just take a look at the numbers. Seven closed-end funds have been launched since April against three open-end schemes. 

 More importantly, there are 11 closed-end schemes lined up, while there are none in the open-end category. The reason: mutual fund managers say that it is because of the uncertain and volatile equity market conditions. 

 In the prevailing market conditions,investors should take long-term view on equityinvestments and there could be a short-term dip in returns. Therefore, it is prudent to launch closed-end funds in such a scenario, says an equity fundmanager.

 However, Dhirendra Kumar has a different take on the trend. If one notices, the trend of launching closed-endfunds has emerged since the Securities and ExchangeBoard of India (Sebi) rationalised the initial issue expenses of new fund offers, said Kumar. 

 According to a circular issued by the Sebi on April 4, initial issue expenses will be permitted for closed-end schemes only, while open-end schemes have to meet the sales, marketing and other such expenses connected with sales and distribution of schemes from the entry load and not through initial issue expenses. 

 Although a mutual fund can charge a maximum load of about 6 per cent, competitive pressures do not allow the fund houses to do so. Thus, an average equity scheme charges an entry load of about 2-2.5 per cent,while a hybrid charges about 1.5 per cent.

 Even if we keep all this aside, it does not make anysense to invest in a closed-end fund, no matter what an investor thinks of the fund or the fund house, Kumar said.

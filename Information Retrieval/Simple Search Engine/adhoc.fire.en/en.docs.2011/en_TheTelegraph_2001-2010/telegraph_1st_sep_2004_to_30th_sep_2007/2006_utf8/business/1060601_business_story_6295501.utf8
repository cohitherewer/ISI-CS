 Calcutta, May 31: Dabur Foods, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dabur India, will invest Rs 100 crore over the next three years to modernise and expand capacity at its existing fruit processing and packaging plants in Nepal, Bengal and Jaipur. Close to 50 per cent of the funds will be invested in the Siliguri plant.

 ?We will invest between Rs 40 crore and Rs 50 crore in setting up a unit to make frozen fruit products and a packaging unit at our Siliguri plant during the next three years,? said Amit Burman, chief executive officer of Dabur Foods.

 At present, the company?s main packaging plant is in Nepal. ?The packaging line at the Siliguri plant will supplement the Nepal unit in future,? he said. The company has recently acquired another packaging plant in Jaipur.

 The fruit processing plant of Dabur Foods was set up in Siliguri in 2004 at an investment of Rs 25 crore.

 ?This plant was built with the export market in mind. However, exports have been low as of now because a large part of the products are used in our other plants,? said Burman, who is also the executive director of Dabur India Ltd.

 The Siliguri plant has exported goods worth Rs 15 crore in 2005-06. The Burmans are planning to ramp up exports from this facility to Rs 100 crore by 2010. The plant processes pineapple fruit pulp and concentrate, which have a huge demand in the global market.

 ?The global demand for pineapple juice and other products of the fruit is estimated at over $1.4 billion,? Burman said.

 ?We are also planning to process other fruits such as mango, pink guava, white guava and pomegranate at this facility. Besides, we may relocate the manufacturing of our Homemade brand of products at the Siliguri unit,? he added. 

 Dabur Foods is aiming at a turnover of Rs 500 crore by 2009-10 against Rs 191 crore in 2005-06. Last fiscal, the company recorded an after-tax profit of Rs 12.5 crore and the target for this year is Rs 35 crore. 

 It is planning to set up a fruit processing plant in Chittoor from where it is already procuring mango pulp and concentrates from vendors on a long-term contract basis.

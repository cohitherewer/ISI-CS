 Focus on finer points of ore export

 Ore story

 Calcutta, Sept. 12: The Prime Ministers Office (PMO) has asked the steel ministry to prepare a report on the domestic consumption of iron ore fines, following objections by steel makers to the export of such fines. The joint plant committee (JPC) of the steel ministry will do the study. 

 India exports 90 million tonnes (mt) of iron ore of which 65 mt is fines or dust of iron. The rest are lumps, which cost more. 

 The mines ministry supports the export of fines because it feels Indian steel makers do not use enough fines to make steel.

 However, the steel industry has countered this claim by saying that fines are used in the pellet or sinter plant which is their preferred route to make steel.

 The study is in the wake of recent controversies surrounding the Hoda Committee report that proposed export of iron ore. 

 Steel companies, led by integrated players like Tata Steel, Steel Authority of India (SAIL), JSW Steel, Essar and Ispat, have objected to the proposals of the committee, forcing the PMOs intervention.

 They have also received support from Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee who wrote a letter to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh seeking ban on export. Bhattacharjee also opposed the recommendations of the Hoda Committee formed to give shape to the national mineral policy.

 While JPC will collate data on the use of fines over the last three years, the committee of secretaries set up by the PMO to study the objections of the steel makers to the Hoda recommendations, will make a forecast on its future use. 

 During the meeting with the committee last Friday, the three leading chambers CII, Ficci and Assocham on behalf of the steel makers said they were concerned over the export of fines and made a projection on the future use of fines.

 The steel industry argued that 76 per cent of the steel produced in India using iron ore follow the sinter or pellet route. Of the 43 mt steel produced, 38 mt is iron ore- based and the balance is scrap-based. 

 China has been on the forefront of using fines. Given the cost advantage fines have over lumps, many new units are taking this route called agglomeration since pellet cannot directly be used in blast furnace.

While high-grade lumps, having iron ore content of 

over 65 per cent, is sold at around Rs 2,500 a tonne, fines come at a much lower 

cost of Rs 1,000 a tonne.

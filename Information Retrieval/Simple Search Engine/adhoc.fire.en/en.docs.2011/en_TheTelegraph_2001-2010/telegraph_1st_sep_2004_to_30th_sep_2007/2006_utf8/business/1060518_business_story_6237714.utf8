 Rise in tea exports 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 17: Indian tea exports rose 22 per cent in March this year to touch 146.91 lakh tonne compared with 120.82 lakh tonne in the same month last year.

 However, the value realised in March was lower at Rs 120 crore against Rs 122 crore in the year-ago period, according to the data released by the Tea Board.

 Tea exports had fallen during January and February but picked up in March. The rise in tea exports is attributed to the drought in Kenya, which sharply lowered the tea output of the African country.

 A trade delegation from Pakistan also visited India last month to explore possibilities of importing tea, as it had earlier sourced tea in large quantities from Kenya.

 In 2005-06, tea exports dropped to 1,810.64 lakh tonne from 2,058.12 lakh tonne in the previous year.

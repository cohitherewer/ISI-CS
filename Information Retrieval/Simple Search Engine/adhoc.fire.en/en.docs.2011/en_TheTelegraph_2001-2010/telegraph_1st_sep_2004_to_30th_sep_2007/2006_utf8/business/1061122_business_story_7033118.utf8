 Calcutta, Nov. 21: Khaitan Electricals will raise around Rs 31 crore through private placement to fund its expansion plans. These include launching two retail formats nationally Khaitan City for electrical products and Khaitan Fantasy for designer underlight fans.

 The company, which expects around Rs 350 crore turnover this fiscal, expects to almost double it to Rs 700 crore by 2007-08. An additional Rs 300 crore is expected from the two formats over the next two years.

 We will possibly issue fresh shares and the decision would be taken at our EGM coming up shortly. A portion of the funds will be used for the retail formats. Khaitan City will stock the entire range of Khaitan products only, including fans, isolators, distribution boxes, miniature circuit breakers and residual current circuit breakers. We would open 100 stores by the end of next year and 20 shops nationally through franchisees by December 2006. Our investment would be Rs 2 lakh per store, said Sunil Khaitan, vice-chairman and managing director, Khaitan Electricals.

 Khaitan Fantasy would sell only premium underlight Khaitan fans ranging from Rs 7,000 to Rs 1 lakh.

 The company will invest Rs 10 lakh per store.

 Khaitan Electricals expects the Fantasy outlets to add Rs 100 crore to the turnover in the next two years. The Khaitan City stores are expected to add Rs 200 crore to the companys topline during the same period.

 The company is also setting up another manufacturing unit at Dehradoon in Uttaranchal with an investment of Rs 12 crore.

 The unit will start operations by March 2007 with a capacity of 1.5 million fans, Khaitan added.

 A major sourcing contract for Walmart is also on the anvil, which is likely to be finalised by March 2007.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Exide tests Pak pitch for future innings 

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Ganguly: Aiming right

 Calcutta, Feb. 1: Our men in blue may not be on the best of terms with their Pakistani counterparts on the field, but corporate India has found in cricket an opportunity to promote its interests in the neighbouring country.

 Exide Industries, the largest lead acid battery manufacturer in the country, has joined hands with Exide Pakistan to promote the brand Exide during the ongoing cricket series between the two countries.

 Exide will pay 85 per cent of the cost of advertising inside the stadia, while Exide Pakistan, a different corporate entity, will chip in with the remaining amount.

 P.K. Kataky, director (auto) of the Raheja-owned Exide, would soon be leaving for Pakistan to explore the relationship further. He would meet S.I. Ahmed, managing director of Exide Pakistan.

 However, the Indian company would not gain much out of the arrangement now since export of battery is not allowed at present.

 But the company is thinking long term, chairman S.B Ganguly said. Unlike in India, the brand in Pakistan is small with a small market share. 

 We are looking at an opportunity when trade barriers between the two countries is relaxed. We can look at a much larger co-operation then, Ganguly told The Telegraph.

 The local company hopes to strengthen its brand presence in Pakistan so that it opens on a strong wicket when export is allowed to that country. Moreover, experts said, the Indian company might consider picking up a stake in future.

 Exide has had a strong association with cricket. Wicket keeper M.S. Dhoni is Exides brand ambassador now. 

 Exide promotes the brand wherever cricket is played keeping in mind the television viewers. The Exide brand was originally owned by Chloride Group Plc of the UK before it was sold off separately in different countries. Exide Industries owns the right to use the brand in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.

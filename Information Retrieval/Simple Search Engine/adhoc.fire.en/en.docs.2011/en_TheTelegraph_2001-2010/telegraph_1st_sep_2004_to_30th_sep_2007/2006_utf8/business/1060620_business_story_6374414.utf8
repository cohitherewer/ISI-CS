 Iran gas deal on fast track

 Deora: Showing the way

 New Delhi, June 19: Petroleum minister Murli Deora is optimistic about the liquefied natural gas (LNG) deal with Iran coming through.

 The petroleum ministry said Deora had discussed the LNG deal and the Iran-Pakistan-India (IPI) gas pipeline project with Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation conference in China.

 Deora also met Iranian oil minister Kazem Vaziri-Hamaneh. In these meetings, Deora has emphasised that the implementation of the LNG supply agreement between the oil companies of Iran and India needs to be expedited.

 According to the ministry, the Iranian President has assured Deora that the issues will be considered and the supply of LNG would be expedited.

 India and Iran had signed an agreement in Tehran in June 2005 on LNG supply. However, the deal has got stuck over the price issue. According to Indian officials, the price was settled in the agreement. But Iran said the agreement was not final and gas prices have shot up since then.

 Deora has reiterated Indias commitment to the pipeline project. He said the discussions on project structure, route, gas pricing and framework agreement by the three participating countries are on a fast track.

 A secretary-level meeting of the three countries was recently held in Islamabad.

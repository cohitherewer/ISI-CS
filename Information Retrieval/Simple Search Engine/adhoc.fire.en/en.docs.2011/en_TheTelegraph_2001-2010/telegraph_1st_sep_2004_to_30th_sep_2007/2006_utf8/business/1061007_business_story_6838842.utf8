 Plan panel not in favour of SEZ sops

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Oct. 6: The Planning Commission today said concessions to special economic zones (SEZs) should be on a par with those provided to infrastructure projects.

 This view expressed by Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia comes only a day ahead of a crucial infrastructure meet in the capital. SEZs should be given a treatment similar to any other infrastructure project and there should be no concessional finance, Ahluwalia said on the sidelines of a function to inaugurate the new building of market regulator Sebi.

 Endorsing the views of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), which recently directed banks to treat lendings to SEZs on a par with those to commercial real estate, Ahluwalia said he was not in favour of concessional benefits and additional incentives to SEZs. These zones involve a lot of construction for real estate development and should be treated in a similar way as any other infrastructure project, he added.

 Ahluwalia had said as SEZs are infrastructure projects, they should not get additional benefits. He also said prime agricultural land should be protected and states should give fair prices for land that will be acquired. He, however, added that the ministry of finance was only concerned about revenue loss due to misuse of tax sops.

 North Block is apprehensive that revenues will take a hit as many entities will float SEZs merely to take advantage of tax benefits. 

 At the recently concluded conclave of Congress chief ministers at Nainital, Sonia Gandhi had asked state governments not to allow prime agricultural land to be diverted for industrial purposes, including SEZs.

 Farm growth

 The Planning Commission and the ministry of agriculture are jointly formulating a new set of policies in the Eleventh Five-Year Plan, aimed at doubling agricultural growth, Ahluwalia said.

 quot;We are engaged in formulating the policies to double the growth in agriculture and bring it close to 4 per cent, quot; he said.

 Apart from agriculture, the eleventh plan will also look into quality education and health to make the growth all inclusive.

 On October 18, the Planning Commission would meet to discuss the approach paper on the eleventh plan related to agriculture, he said.

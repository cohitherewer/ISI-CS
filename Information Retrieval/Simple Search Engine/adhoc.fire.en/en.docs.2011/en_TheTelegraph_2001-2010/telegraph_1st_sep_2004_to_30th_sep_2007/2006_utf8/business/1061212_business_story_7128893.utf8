 Cairn provides some respite

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Dec. 11: The IPO of Cairn India was oversubscribed on the opening day today, indicating investor confidence in its fundamentals, as shares got trashed in the secondary markets, with the sensex plummeting by 400 points. 

 Bids received by the company were for 43.01 crore shares, more than the issue size of 32.88 crore shares. 

 Investment bankers were happy with the response, on a day of great selling pressure on stocks.

 They said the issue received good response at the top end of the price band, and the interest from the qualified institutional buyers (QIBs) was positive. Cairn India had announced a price band of Rs 160-190 per share, with a target to raise around $1.4 billion.

 However, the issue received a strong response from only foreign institutional investors (FIIs). There were bids for 42 crore shares against the quota of 19.72 crore shares for QIBs. 

 All the bids were from FIIs and none from banks, financial institutions and insurance companies.

 In the non-institutional category, there were bids for 40,775 shares against a quota of 3.28 crore shares; for retail investors, there were bids for 15.65 lakh shares against the allotment of 9.86 crore shares. 

 Sources close to Cairn, however, expect greater interest from these two segments in the coming days. 

 The issue will close on December 15.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 17: Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) and Stroytransgaz (STG) of Russia have signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to pursue economically attractive pipeline projects in India and abroad.

 The MoU was inked by A.M. Uplenchwar, director (pipelines) of IOC, and L. Bokhanovskiy, first vice-president of STG, in the presence of Russian Prime Minister Mikhail E. Fradkov and commerce minister Kamal Nath.

 IOC and STG have earlier been partners in a consortium with Essar Construction Ltd for implementing the 133-km Baroda-Ahmedabad-Kalol gas pipeline project of Gujarat State Petronet Ltd.

 The two companies also jointly bid for the 300-km Iraq-Jordan crude oil pipeline project. 

 Stroytransgaz is a leading Russian construction company in the oil and gas sector. It has implemented projects worldwide, involving design and construction of pipeline systems and gas and oil storage facilities. It has executed projects in Russia, Greece, Turkey, Finland, the US, Iran, Algeria and India. 

 IOC is also highly experienced in pipeline design and engineering, construction supervision and maintenance of pipelines. 

 Uplenchwar said IOC is expanding its existing network of nearly 10000 km of crude oil and petroleum product pipelines across the country.

 The company is implementing projects like the 330-km Paradip-Haldia crude oil pipeline, the 132-km Dadri-Panipat R-LNG pipeline, the 112-km product pipeline from Koyali to Dahej and the 274-km product pipeline from Koyali Refinery to Ratlam.

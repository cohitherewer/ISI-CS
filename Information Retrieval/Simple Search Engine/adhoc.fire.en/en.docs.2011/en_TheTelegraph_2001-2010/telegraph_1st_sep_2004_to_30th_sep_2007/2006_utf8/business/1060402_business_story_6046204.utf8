 Mittal corporate office in Jharkhand

 SUDHIR KUMAR MISHRA

 Ranchi, April 1: World?s number one steel producer Mittal Steel will set up its corporate office in Jharkhand. The company today appointed Sanjib Sengupta as its general manager. Sengupta was Hindalco?s senior vice-president, administration and corporate affairs, before joining Mittal Steel.

 Sengupta will look after Mittal Steel?s operations in Jharkhand, where it will set up a 12-million-tonne integrated steel plant at an investment of Rs 55,000 crore. 

 During the last week, Mittal Steel officials inspected Kharsawan, south of Chandil and Karra-Govindpur near Khunti to select the right spot for setting up the steel plant and are expected to see a few more in the coming weeks. 

 Canada-based Hatch Associates has been appointed consultant for the plant. The officials said an office of the company would be soon be set up in the state. 

 Mittal Steel chief executive Sanak Mishra, along with his general manager and consultants, met chief minister Arjun Munda today and told him that the detailed project report of the steel mill would be submitted soon.

 According to the memorandum of understanding signed by steel baron Laxmi Niwas Mittal and the state government in October last year, the detailed project report has to be submitted within a year. ?Our ground work is progressing steadily. We have already engaged consultants and contacted major suppliers for technical equipment and skilled manpower. As the Jharkhand government too is extending us full support, I find no reason why this project will be delayed,? Mishra told The Telegraph.

 ?It is going to be one of the largest steel plants in the world. Our men are working on the project round the clock and the keen interest shown by the Jharkhand government is giving us moral boost. There are absolutely no hurdles. I also met the state secretary for science and technology three days ago and discussed the modalities for setting up our technical training centre here and carrying out our apprenticeship programme in the existing institutes till our own institute becomes functional,? said Mishra.

 Sources said development commissioner T. Nandkumar today proposed that he would arrange Mittal Steel?s meeting with the principals of engineering colleges, polytechnics and ITIs, where the details of carrying out an apprenticeship programme could be discussed at length.

 At one stage it was being speculated that the Mittals might not be coming to the state because of the dispute over Chiria Mines. The state government also had not identified any other iron ore reserve for the company. But, Mishra clarified that the dispute over Chiria mines will never hinder the progress of the steel project and that everything would be smoothly sorted out through mutual talks.

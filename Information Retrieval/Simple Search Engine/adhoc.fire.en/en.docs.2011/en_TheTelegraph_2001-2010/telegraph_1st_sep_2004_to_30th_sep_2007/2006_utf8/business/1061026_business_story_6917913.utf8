 Telecom firms cash in on backdrop tones 

 JAYATI GHOSE

 New Delhi, Oct. 25: If youre chilling out at a pub and want to pretend you are caught in traffic, you can choose a traffic jam BGM or background music while talking to your boss over the phone.

 BGM is a customised service that lets you play a song or scenario music like sound of cars, birds chirping, baby crying of your choice while talking on the phone.

 More and more cellphone users are opting for different background tones and this has sent cash registers of telecom companies ringing. In the last six months, more than 10 lakh background tone subscribers have bought more than 30 lakh background songs. The usual trend is to change songs once or twice every month.

 Among the value-added services introduced this year, BGM has become the biggest grosser both in terms of revenue generated and customer subscriptions, said Savinder Sarna, head marketing, Cellebrum Private Limited, an integrated telecom value-added service solutions provider.

 With teenagers and the youth always looking for innovative means of entertainment, BGM has the potential to become a 20-30 per cent contributor to the total revenue generated in the Rs 3,000-crore and growing value-added service market, said Sarna.

 Bharti officials said, BGM has contributed a major chunk of the total revenue generated by value-added services.

 Value-added services contribute around 12 per cent to Bharti Airtels kitty, around 8-10 per cent for Spice and Idea, and around 11 per cent towards total revenue generated by Reliance Telecom.

 BGM is different from the caller ring-back tone solution, where the music is played before the call is connected. In BGM, music is played after the call is connected. Cost for the service varies from operator to operator. There are three kind of charges the activation charge, the chosen background song and per minute cost of the song.

 But rates are competitive with activation or subscription fee around Rs 20 per month, per song download cost varying between Rs 10 and Rs 15, and per minute cost of song charged at Re 1 for most telecom operators, said Pravin Juneja, owner of Delhi-based Cariano Telecom.

 Relief for rural banks

 Mumbai, April 18 (PTI): The Reserve Bank today simplified and liberalised the branch licensing policy for regional rural banks (RRBs) as these are an important instrument for delivery of rural credit.

 In the annual policy statement for 2006-07, the apex bank has permitted RRBs to open or shift offices after obtaining clearance from empowered committees.

 Till now, regional rural banks had to seek the RBIs approval by sending a request, which had to be duly recommended by the sponsor banks, through the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (Nabard).

 In view of the importance of RRBs and to strengthen them, the central bank had encouraged sponsor banks for state-wise merger of RRBs. In this context, the government has issued notifications providing amalgamation of 93 rural banks into 27 new ones, sponsored by 15 banks in 12 states.

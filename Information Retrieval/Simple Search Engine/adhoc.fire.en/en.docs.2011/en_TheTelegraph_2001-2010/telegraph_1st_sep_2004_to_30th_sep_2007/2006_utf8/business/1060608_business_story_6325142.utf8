 Land stocks scalded

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, June 7: As real estate giant DLF Universal Ltd prepares for its initial public offering (IPO), the equity markets have been punishing property and real estate scrips.

 This could be attributed to the broad market trend ? the benchmark BSE sensex has shrunk to 9756.76 from well over 12000 in May. 

 Many scrips that are indirectly related to real estate have received a pounding. Such scrips were the stock market darlings during the bull run, as soaring real asset prices saw investors rushing to build positions. However, the situation has now changed.

 More than 60 scrips have fallen anywhere between 5 per cent to 90 per cent from their 52-week peaks due to the meltdown. The irony is there are no buyers at low levels though sellers are abundant.

 Like the broad market trend, the mid-cap and small-stocks have received the battering. However, there are some well known names too. Shares of Bombay Dyeing, pursued by investors for its real estate, is now ruling at Rs 490.20, more than 50 per cent lower than its 52-week high. Or take Mahindra GESCO: the shares today closed at Rs 492.25, a 62 per cent fall from its 52-week high.

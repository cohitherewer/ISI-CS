 OF STAKE CHURN IN LOCKER ROOMS

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 11: Union Bank of India will pick up a 15 per cent stake in the proposed asset reconstruction company (ARC) promoted by Standard Chartered Bank.

 According to an official, Union Bank has in-principle decided to invest Rs 15 crore to pick up a 15 per cent stake in the joint venture company, which will have two other public sector banks ? Oriental Bank of Commerce and Jammu amp; Kashmir Bank ? besides StanChart.

 In January, StanChart got all regulatory approvals for setting up an asset reconstruction company and subsequently floated a special purpose vehicle for distressed asset business.

 Since then, StanChart is in talks with several public sector banks to set up the asset reconstruction company with an initial share capital of Rs 100 crore. The company is likely to be named Special Asset Reconstruction Company Private Ltd. 

 StanChart had said it would hold a 49 per cent stake in the asset reconstruction company, amounting to Rs 49 crore, through its Indian subsidiary, Standard Chartered Investments and Loans (India) Ltd. 

 Union Bank is the first among the public sector banks partnering the joint venture to agree in-principle to pick up a stake in the company. However, it has not been finalised yet though the board has agreed to the proposal, said the Union Bank official.

 Oriental Bank of Commerce is yet to decide on how much stake it will pick up in the company. The proposal is there for some time and we are going to take a decision soon, said a bank official.

 As of now, the Asset Reconstruction Company of India (Arcil) is the only one such company that is operational. Arcil is promoted by ICICI Bank, State Bank of India and IDBI.

 A second asset reconstruction company, ASREC (India), is also set to be operational in Mumbai soon. Bank of India, Allahabad Bank, Indian Bank and Life Insurance Corporation of India are the shareholders of ASREC, which is promoted by UTI-I with a 49 per cent stake. The government has allowed Standard Chartered Investments amp; Loans (India) Ltd to acquire a 10 per cent stake in ASREC (India) Ltd.

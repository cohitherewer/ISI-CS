 ONGC-Videsh to resume work in Iraq

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Deora: Looking ahead

 New Delhi, Sept. 13: Petroleum minister Murli Deora has assured Iraqi oil minister Hussain Al-Shahristani that ONGC-Videsh (OVL) was ready to resume exploration work, which was suspended because of the war, in block 8 in Iraq.

 Deora has told his Iraqi counterpart that India would fully support Iraq in its reconstruction, including active participation in the downstream oil sector of Iraq, an official statement said.

 Deora made the assurance following the Iraqi ministers request at a bilateral meeting on the sidelines of the third Opec International Seminar in Vienna.

 Deora also expressed OVLs interest in beginning negotiations on the Tuba oilfield in Iraq.

 At a bilateral meeting with his Nigerian counterpart, Deora pushed through Indian Oils request for more crude being made available from the African nation through a term contract.

 Edmund Daukoru, Nigerias minister of state for petroleum and the current president of Opec, said Nigerian crude oil production is on the increase and it would favourably consider the Indian request to enhance the term contract volume as and when additional volumes are available.

 Daukoru sought Indian investment in the downstream oil sector in Nigeria and Deora said the MoU signed between IOCL and the state of Edo in Nigeria to set up a refinery should be put on fast track.

 India imports 12 million tonnes of high quality bonny light crude from Nigeria, of which only 2 million tonnes are under term contract. The rest have to be picked up as spot cargoes. These introduce an element of uncertainty as many nations could be competing for the same cargo at any particular point.

 A term contract assures that the quantity is made available when required and allows for better planning. Sourcing more crude from Nigeria is also part of the countrys policy to diversify its sources of crude purchases so that excessive dependence is not placed on any particular region.

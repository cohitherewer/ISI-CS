 Return relief for salaried under study

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 Keeping it simple

 New Delhi, Dec. 28: Those who earn nothing over and above their salaries might not have to file income tax returns, if tax is deducted at source. The government is considering this option even as it is looking at redesigning last years Saral form.

 Last year, a longer Saral form had sparked off protests, though the income tax department persisted with the form.

 The government is now considering ways in which this form can be redesigned after receiving the feedback from chartered accountants, assessees and members of Parliament.

 We want Saral to be really saral (simple). But the concept of stating ones gross income from all sources, mentioning the loans taken during a year and then netting it off, will remain, revenue officials said.

 However, in the process, the government is also looking at a suggestion to do away with filing income tax returns by people with pure salary income, whose tax is being deducted at source and returns filed by the company.

 Income-tax officials, however, said few people had pure salary income as at the very least, an individual would have interest income from ones bank account. Negligible income from other sources could be ignored but not substantial interest, dividend or rental income, said officials. The fact that most people have mixed income makes accepting this proposal difficult.

 Officials said implementing such a proposal would depend on how well the department was able to finetune its data mining wing the tax information network. A good data mining system would be able to check if taxpayers, who claimed to have a pure salary income, were actually having multiple sources of income (from stocks, bonds, real estate, besides salaries).

 If the government eventually agrees to do away with annual information returns for such taxpayers, it will not only mean less hassle for the people but also less paperwork for the I-T department.

 Officials said the number of people in this category are yet to be ascertained.

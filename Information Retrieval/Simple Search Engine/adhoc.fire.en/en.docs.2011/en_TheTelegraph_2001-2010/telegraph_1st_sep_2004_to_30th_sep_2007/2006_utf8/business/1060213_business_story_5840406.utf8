 Differential act

 An arbitrage fund, with 9-10% returns, is a great place to park your money, says Srikumar Bondyopadhyay

 It is a peculiar situation. All the asset classes ? gold, interest rate, equities, real estate ? are simultaneously gaining in prices. This has never happened before,? says Manish Sonthalia, vice-president of equity strategy at Motilal Oswal Securities, a leading brokerage firm in the country.

 The point Sonthalia is trying to make is that investments are getting riskier by the day. This is more so in stock markets, which have embarked on a gravity-defying climb.

 What to do 

 Stock derivatives provide a hedge against wild fluctuations typical to the present market situation. But the complex nature of these instruments and their trading have kept small investors at bay.

 ?However, small investors can take shelter in the hybrid schemes of mutual funds,? says Biren Mehta, the fund manager of JM Equity and Derivative Fund. ?Hybrid funds use more than one asset clas to give a return that is not correlated with any one particular asset class,? he explains.

 One may look at a structured product called the arbitrage fund.

 New concept

 An arbitrage fund is a relatively new concept in India. An arbitrage exists when an asset is traded in two different markets at two different prices. The price difference determines the extent of the arbitrage.

 In the stock market, the scope for arbitrage lies between the spot market (where equity shares are bought and sold) and the derivatives market (where the rights to buy or sell a stock at a future date are traded at a predetermined price). For example, if a particular stock, say ABC Ltd, can be bought at Rs 50 a share and sold simultaneously in the futures market at a price of Rs 52 for a one-month futures, the price difference is the quantum of arbitrage.

 However, this difference changes depending on the outlook of an individual stock and the general price movements in the stock market.

 Small worries

 For small investors, it is not often possible to hedge their stock market investments with corresponding deals in the derivatives market. But mutual funds can cash in on the arbitrage opportunity existing in individual stocks and fetch unit holders a return that is often higher than those in their liquid or cash plans. 

 At present, only 3-4 mutual fund houses are offering arbitrage funds. These include JM Mutual Fund, Prudential ICICI Mutual Fund and Benchmark Mutual Fund. At least 7-8 other fund houses have already filed draft prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Board of India to launch their schemes. 

 ?However, it should be borne in mind that arbitrage funds are basically cash or liquid funds though they are being positioned as open-ended equity schemes,? says Dhirendra Kumar, chief executive of Value Research.

 Great expectations

 If you invest in an equity fund, you would expect returns from your investment along the lines of the sensex or nifty. In a debt fund, you would expect that if the interest rate goes down, you would get higher returns and vice versa.

 But in an arbitrage fund, the fund manager doesn?t pick a stock expecting its price to go up, but to sell it simultaneously in the derivatives market at a marginal premium. It gives a debt fund like return, but with risks that are not there in a debt fund.

 ?With the short-term interest rate rising and the Reserve Bank revealing its intention to tame the inflation by manipulating short-term interest rates through its repo and reverse repo rates, investors should avoid debt funds at this moment. Debt funds are likely to give diminished returns,? says Nilesh Shah, chief investment officer, Prudential ICICI Mutual Fund. 

 ?Currently, arbitrage gives a return between 12 and 14 per cent per annum,? says Shah. 

 But mutual funds are not permitted to invest more than 50 per cent of their fund corpus in equities and derivatives. The remaining 50 per cent they can hold in any other debt instruments. So, the overall return from an arbitrage fund is around 9-10 per cent annually. The equity and derivative component of an investment gives a return of 7 per cent (14 multiplied by 0.5) and the debt component gives a return of 2-2.5 per cent assuming that the rate of interest (the return on a debt instrument) is 4.5 per cent for less than a year.

 ?However, with so many arbitrage funds in the pipeline, the Rs 16,000-crore arbitrage market (at present) appears to be self cannibalising,? Kumar says.

 High court reserves order on HPL case

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 11: Delhi High Court today reserved its judgment on the petition filed by the Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI) against the Company Law Board order deferring allotment of Haldia Petrochemicals (HPL) shares to the financial institution.

 IDBI argued that its agreement with HPL, under which the company was to issue shares equivalent to the money lent for corporate debt restructuring, should remain out of the CLBs purview. It also said the implementation of the agreement had nothing to do with the dispute between The Chatterjee Group (TCG) and West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation.

 The IDBI counsel said, Even though we had not been made a party to the proceedings at the CLB, the board should have restrained from passing an order deferring allotment of HPL shares to us. 

 TCG, however, said, The writ petition is not maintainable as IDBI should have moved Calcutta High Court within 60 days of CLBs passing the August 4 order.

 The TCG counsel also argued that if more shares are allotted to IDBI as the corporate debt restructuring package suggests, TCG would become a minority stakeholder.

 The financial institution had alleged that TCG obtained the interim order by suppression of material facts regarding its arrangement with Haldia Petrochemicals. 

 The CLB, while allowing the 7.5 per cent share allotment to IOC in HPL, had restrained the company from allotting shares worth Rs 135 crore to IDBI till the final disposal of the case.

 The CLB felt that issues could not be decided without hearing the entire matter. The CLB had issued an injunction order on August 4 last year.

 IDBI is the principal lender in a consortium of 52 financial institutions. HPL has a debt burden of Rs 3,000 crore.

 IDBI had contended that the CLB had acted beyond the scope of the petition as there was no prayer restraining issuance of shares in its favour.

 The financial institution had also alleged that the order had come in the way of implementing the package approved for the corporate debt restructuring of the company.

 IDBI had appealed to the CLB on August 2, 2005, seeking allotment of shares. The CLB had ruled that the decision on IDBIs application would be taken at the time of final hearing on the main petition.

 However, IDBI had sought to vacate the status quo order. 

 The Chatterjee group had approached CLB alleging acts of oppression and mismanagement in the affairs of HPL. 

 TCG had alleged that HPL had proposed to allot shares worth Rs 150 crore to IOC and if the allotment took place, TCG being in the majority, was likely to be reduced to a minority.

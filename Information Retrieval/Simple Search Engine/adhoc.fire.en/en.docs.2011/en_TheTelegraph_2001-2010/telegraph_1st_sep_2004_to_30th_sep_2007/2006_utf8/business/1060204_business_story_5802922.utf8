 Calcutta, Feb. 3: Hutchison Telecom East is expanding its retail operations in Bengal through franchisee outlets and shops on wheels.

 The company plans to increase the number of Hutch stores and Teleshops ? the smaller service outlets ? from 46 at present in the city to 100 in and around Calcutta in the course of next three months, Hutchison Telecomm East chief executive officer Sridhar Rao said.

 In Bengal, the company plans to add 10 Hutch shops to the existing 12 and raise the number of Teleshops from 65 to 150 in the next four to five months.

 We will develop the outlets on a franchisee model and provided we find the right partners and location, Hutch will provide the interiors and the personnel, Rao said.

 Hutch also plans to increase its service coverage in the suburbs and the districts. It has launched mobile vans or Hutch shops on wheels, which would initially cater to the suburbs of the Calcutta telecom district, coupled with North and South 24 Parganas, Howrah and Hoogly.

 The company will start with one van and gradually increase the number to five or six and spread them to other districts. The project entails an investment of Rs 20 to Rs 25 lakh. The vans will visit a specified route on a particular day and will be available on a pre-determined spot for a couple of hours.

 The services will include additional online connectivity and bill printing on the move.

 This mobile service was launched in Mumbai followed by Karnataka and Gujarat about a year back.

 The vans have been designed exclusively for Hutch by Dilip Chhabria, a leading automobile designer.

 Orissa gets tough with laggards

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, April 11: The Orissa government will cancel the MoUs signed by five private companies as they have failed to take any initiative to execute the proposed steel plant projects.

 These are Maharashtra Seamless Limited, AML Steel amp; Power, Sunflag Special Steel, Stas Steel India Limited and Sterilite Iron amp; Steel Company Limited.

 The decision was taken at a high-level meeting, convened to review the progress on the proposed steel plant projects.

 The review showed that five out of 43 private companies, who have signed MoUs with the state government to set up steel plants, have not taken any initiative to acquire land and get forest clearance. They have also ignored the reminders from the government.

 Maharashtra Seamless and AML Steel amp; Power had proposed to set up steel plants at Kalinga Nagar in Jajpur district, Sunflag Special Steel in Sambalpur, Stas Steel in Cuttack and Sterlite in Keonjhar.

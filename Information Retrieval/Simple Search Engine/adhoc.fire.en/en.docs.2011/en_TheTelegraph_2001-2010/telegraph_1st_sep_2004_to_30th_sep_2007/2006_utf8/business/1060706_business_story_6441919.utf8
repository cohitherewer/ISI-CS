 India Inc sets terms for job guarantee

 New Delhi, July 5: India Inc today agreed to participate in the governments job guarantee scheme, provided labour laws are relaxed to facilitate contract employment.

 They (industry chambers) offered to give 100 days of guaranteed employment in factories if labour laws were made flexible, finance minister P.Chidambaram said after a meeting with captains of industry here today. The government guarantees jobs for 100 days in its rural infrastructure programmes. 

 The industry wants loss-making firms be permitted to shut shop quickly after compensating employees.

 Provisions in the industrial disputes act, which upholds the right to strike and setting up of labour courts, also need to be changed to keep outside its purview establishments employing up to 500 workers.

 Changes in the industrial employment act should facilitate transfers within and between enterprises, industry said. The act must also suitably define work conditions in special economic zones (SEZs).

 Unions are livid with these suggestions. Aituc head and CPI leader Gurudas Dasgupta said the proposals were an attempt to legalise the hire and fire ideology of the corporates and flies in the face of the objectives of the job guarantee scheme that aims at enhancing the welfare of the poor.

 This is a retrograde move which will take away jobs and reduce the number of earning days, Dasgupta said.

 He said the proposals would make job tenure less secure in labour-intensive industries, such as in garments and shoes, by replacing provisions for more secure employment with conditions that would generate a new category of temporary workers. No new jobs would be added, we fear such a move will simply replace one kind of workers with another, Dasgupta said. 

 Reservation push

 At the meeting today with Chidambaram and the finance ministry mandarins, industry honchos tabled a proposal that would warm the cockles of the reservation lobby.

 Chidambaram said the ministry would look into the suggestions of Ficci that the government offer fiscal sops to promote manufacturing clusters in districts with a high population of scheduled castes and tribes. 

 Probable sites for such clusters are districts with over 40 per cent SC/ST population. Ficci has identified around 27 districts and some industries for this purpose. 

 Though attractive, the proposal drew immediate flak from several quarters. Former member of the Planning Commission, S.P. Gupta, said the proposal was a rehash of a flop government scheme ? the backward districts industrialisation scheme that promised sops to industries in backward areas. Gupta said the plan degenerated into a scam as businesses extracted concessions by setting up fake industries. 

 We should not try to play around with the logic of economic geography which is at the heart of why industries are located either near markets or near raw material sources, Gupta said.

 The meeting today also discussed proposals to speed up growth and put a leash on inflation. Besides Chidambaram, five government officers in the rank of secretary were at the meeting. Representatives of Ficci, CII and Assocham were also present.

 The meeting also discussed the industry proposal of a national fund to buy hi-tech companies abroad and for the freedom to self certify instead of allowing government officials to inspect and certify. 

 Finance ministry officials said the government will examine the proposals and if deemed appropriate they would be considered for inclusion in the next Budget.

 Cabinet okays SCI joint venture

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, March 4: The Union cabinet today cleared a Shipping Corporation of India (SCI) proposal for investing $20.88 million in a joint venture with three Japanese shipping companies for transporting liquefied natural gas. 

 SCI will own a 33.77 per cent in the joint venture company which will be registered in Panama. The joint venture will transport LNG for the Dahej expansion project of Petronet LNG, information and broadcasting minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi said after the cabinet meeting.

 The other partners in the venture are Mitsui OSK Lines of Japan with a stake of 33.77 per cent, Nippon Yusem Kabushiki Kaisha with 21.64 per cent share and Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha holding 10.82 per cent.

 SCIs share in the joint venture may go down to 26 per cent if Petronet LNG or its nominee exercises the option to take up a 23 per cent share, the minister said. 

 Petronet LNG is a joint venture company of GAIL (India), ONGC, Indian Oil and Bharat Petroleum. The company is already importing 5 million tonnes per annum of LNG at its Dahej terminal in Gujarat. 

 SCI along with its Japanese partners is already engaged in transporting natural gas in liquefied form from Qatar. Currently, the joint venture is using two cryogenic ships on the Qatar-Dahej run.

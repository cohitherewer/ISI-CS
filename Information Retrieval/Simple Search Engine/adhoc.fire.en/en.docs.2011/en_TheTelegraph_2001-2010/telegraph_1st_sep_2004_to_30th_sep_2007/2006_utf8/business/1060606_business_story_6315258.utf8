The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Futures trade in jute resumes

 AMIT CHAKRABORTY

 Calcutta, June 5: Futures trading in raw jute resumed today on the East India Jute and Hessian Exchange after over four decades. The enthusiasm was high among local traders amid a promise of total transparency by the management.

 Seven members participated in the symbolic August delivery trade today and many people wanted in become active members. Arun Seth, president of the exchange, told The Telegraph nearly 100 people associated with the trade are likely to enrol after they are convinced that the exchange operations are transparent.

 Futures trading in all agro-commodities was banned in 1964 by a government order on fear of widespread hoarding and price speculation following the war with China and an impending war with Pakistan.

 In the symbolic trading, nearly 150 truckloads of the representative raw jute grade, TD-4, came up for bidding. Eventually just about three deals were documented, according to an exchange spokesperson.

 This being the end of the current jute year (July-June), the new crop for August delivery contracts were transacted today. Official sources said the price bid opened at Rs 1,240 per quintal and closed at Rs 1,236.

 The jute commissioner had set a reasonable price of Rs 1,468 per quintal amidst speculation in raw jute prices in the futures trade conducted by the Multi-commodity Exchange and National Commodities and Derivatives Exchange in November-December 2005. The order also notified all transactions beyond the reasonable price as illegal. Forward Markets Commission (FMC) chairman S. Sundareshan, who flagged off the futures trade resumption in the city exchange, said the commission had decided to promote commodity-specific regional exchanges.

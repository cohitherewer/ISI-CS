 Alcatel twin deals in rough patch

 POWER PLAY

 Paris, March 31 (Reuters): Alcatels bold bid to clinch a telecoms merger with US rival Lucent and simultaneously pull off a satellites deal with defence electronics group Thales has run into some political obstacles, French newspapers said on Friday.

 The La Tribune and Les Echos newspapers said President Jacques Chirac was refusing to be hurried into approving a deal between Alcatel and Thales, because he wants European defence group EADS involved in any defence electronics tie-up.

 The board of Alcatel, which held inconclusive talks on Thursday over its planned tie-ups but noted talks with smaller rival Lucent Technologies were continuing, is set to meet again over the weekend.

 In an effort to scotch daily speculation over the impact of a deal, especially on sensitive military projects on both sides of the Atlantic, Alcatel said on Thursday it would make no further comment until the negotiations with Lucent were wrapped up.

 The French company reiterated, however, that the proposed merger ? worth some $35 billion when it was announced last week ? would be carried out at market prices, implying Alcatel would be left with around 62 per cent of combined stock. 

 Following todays board meeting, Alcatel states ? as we indicated in our joint statement last week, Alcatel and Lucent are engaged in discussions about a potential merger of equals that is intended to be priced at market, the company said in the statement read out by a spokesperson in Paris.

 As we have said the companies will have no further comment until either an agreement is reached or the discussions are terminated.

 Alcatel left investors guessing over the fate of a parallel effort to fold its military satellite and other sensitive space activities into Thales in return for an expanded stake in the French defence electronics maker, Europes largest.

 But sources familiar with the talks said the process had been complicated by political and industrial disagreements over whether the space alliance should be widened to include the space activities of Airbus parent EADS, dominated by French and German interests.

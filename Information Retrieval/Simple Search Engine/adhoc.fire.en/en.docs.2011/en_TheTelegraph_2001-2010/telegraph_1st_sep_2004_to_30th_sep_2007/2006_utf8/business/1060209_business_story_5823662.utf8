 Singh: Finding a way out

 New Delhi, Feb. 8: Petroleum minister Murli Deora today met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to discuss the pricing of petroleum products to give some respite to the loss-making public sector oil companies.

 The Prime Minister will hold another meeting with Deora and finance minister P. Chidambaram at which a decision will be taken on the prices of petroleum products and issue of oil bonds.

 Deora said the government was not in favour of increasing LPG and kerosene prices as they were essential commodities used by the poor and the lower-middle class. However, the government has to strike a balance between the burgeoning losses of the oil companies and the existing subsidy system.

 The C. Rangarajan committee is expected to recommend a modest increase in petrol and diesel prices and a reduction in duties ? points that are likely to be taken into consideration while preparing the budget. The committee, which has been appointed to evolve a long-term pricing policy, will submit its final report next week.

 There are still some issues to be addressed. We hope to submit the final report on Tuesday, Rangarajan said after a meeting with the petroleum minister.

 He said the measures being suggested in the report are aimed at preventing losses suffered by public sector oil companies on account of a government freeze on prices despite an increase in global crude oil rates.

 The committee is considering hiking the prices of petrol and diesel by up to Rs 2 per litre and reducing customs duty to 7.5 per cent from 10 per cent at present. The government has indicated that any price hike is likely to come with the budget when the recommendations of the committee will be weighed. 

 We need to see how we can restore the financial health of the public sector oil companies by adjusting the duty structure, raising government subsidy and issuing oil bonds, he said.

 The government ban on raising fuel prices despite a rise in international crude rates has resulted in Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum, Hindustan Petroleum and IBP suffering a net loss of Rs 2,898 crore this fiscal. 

 Deora also said he would seek a level-playing field for ONGC as it was getting only $1.8 per million British thermal units (mbtu) for its natural gas while private companies like Reliance were allowed to get the market price, which is currently in the vicinity of $5 per mbtu.

 However, the move is bound to face a tough resistance from the power and fertiliser ministries as the gas is used to produce electricity and fertilisers, both of which are sold at regulated prices.

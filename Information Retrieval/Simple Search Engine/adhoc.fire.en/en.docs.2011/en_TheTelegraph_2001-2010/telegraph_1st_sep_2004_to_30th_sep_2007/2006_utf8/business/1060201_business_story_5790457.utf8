 Bullion prices dazzle

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Jan. 31: Gold glittered today on the bullion market and registered its lifetime high of Rs 8,170 in Mumbai. 

 The precious metal saw a spurt in buying by stockists and retail jewellers on concerns of a further hike in global prices with markets spooked by worries over Irans nuclear programme and the incoming Hamas-led Palestinian government. 

 Gold prices in the world market shot up to a 25-year high as gold for immediate delivery rose by $2.50 or 0.4 per cent to $570.85 per troy ounce. 

 In Mumbai, standard gold (99.5 purity) opened higher at Rs 8,150 and continued to rise to close at Rs 8,170, a Rs 100 gain over yesterdays close of Rs 8,070. 

 Pure gold (99.9 purity) opened at Rs 8,190 and closed Rs 100 up at Rs 8,210 over yesterdays close of Rs 8,110. 

 The previous life-time high was Rs 8,100 for standard gold and Rs 8,145 for pure gold recorded on December 21 last year.

 Gold prices have continued to remain firm for the last two months and the Indian prices have been affected by the global trend. This has adversely impacted the physical demand for the precious metal since demand is always slow with prices on the higher side, said Srikanth Subarayan, product manager-gold, National Commodity and Derivatives Exchange. 

 The physical demand for gold has now become one-third of its peak volume in November, he added.

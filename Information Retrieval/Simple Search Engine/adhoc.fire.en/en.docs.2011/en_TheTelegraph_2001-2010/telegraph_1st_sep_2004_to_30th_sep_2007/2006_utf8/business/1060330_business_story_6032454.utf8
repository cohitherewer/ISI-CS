 States asked to plug PDS leakage

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 29: The Centre has asked state governments to prepare a time-bound programme for a continuous vigil on the public distribution system (PDS) and work out an action plan to check diversion of foodgrain from the PDS.

 State governments themselves will have to set up a good monitoring system, said Union agriculture minister Sharad Pawar at a conference of state food ministers here.

 He called upon the states to formulate an action plan and send it to the Centre. 

 A review meeting will be held after six months, the minister said.

 We also need to undertake micro-level planning to ensure that the undernourished and vulnerable people and those living in inaccessible areas become food-secure on a sustainable basis, he added.

 It is unfortunate that diversion of foodgrain is continuing unabated despite all measures taken. It affects the food security of vulnerable sections of the society. In spite of self-sufficiency in foodgrain, the problem of food insecurity continues, Pawar said.

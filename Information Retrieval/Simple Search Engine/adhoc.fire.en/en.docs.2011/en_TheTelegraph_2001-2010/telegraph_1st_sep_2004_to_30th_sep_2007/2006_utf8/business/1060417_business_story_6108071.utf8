 SOHINI MOOKHERJEA

 Big plans

 Calcutta, April 16: S Kumars Nationwide Limited (SKNL) has set up a subsidiary, Brandhouse Retail Limited, to carry out its expansion plans. It will open 100 Reid amp; Taylor stores and 30 exclusive home textile outlets by the end of the year.

 The company is also set to launch a mid-priced menswear brand in August.

 We plan to bring three international luxury or super premium brands to India. The talks are in various stages of finalisation, said Tarun Joshi, chief executive officer of Brand House Retail Limited.

 The company aims to take the number of Reid amp; Taylor stores to 45 from 24 in the next four months. By the year-end, the brand should have 100 outlets, each with an area of 2000 sq ft and an investment between Rs 25 lakh and Rs 30 lakh, Joshi said.

 In Calcutta, the stores will come up at Park Street, Lindsay Street, Gariahat and Salt Lake.

 The first phase would cater to tier I cities. The company is eyeing Patna, Siliguri, Guwahati, Ranchi, Bhubaneswar, Cuttack and Jamshedpur in the east.

 Reid amp; Taylor, which has a market share of 15 per cent, is growing by almost 35 per cent against a category growth of 2-3 per cent.

 The recently launched home textile brand ? Carmichael House ? will develop fabric (bed, bath and table linen with furnishings) for the international market.

 The home textile brand would be present in 700 to 800 multi-brand outlets by next month.

 The company also plans to develop 30 exclusive large format stores by the year-end, Joshi said.

 SKNL has recently appointed actress Sushmita Sen to endorse the brand and plans to spend between Rs 15 crore and Rs 20 crore on promotion.

 Each store would have an area of 1,700 sq ft and require an investment of Rs 30 lakh. The strategy is to have a mix of high-street and mall stores.

 Joshi said Bangalore would have a high-street store, while the one in New Delhi would be inside a mall. Mumbai and Calcutta would have a mix of both.

 SKNL has recorded a sales turnover of Rs 861.83 crore in 2005-06 and expects it grow to Rs 1,081.40 this fiscal. The company expects to double its sales to Rs 1,802.20 crore by 2009-10. The S Kumars brand contributes over Rs 500 crore to the sales turnover.

 The company expects its three relatively new divisions of high-value fibre cotton (HVFC), home textiles and ready-to-wear to grow steadily between financial year 2008 and 2010.

 SKNL also plans a business process outsourcing (BPO) service for the institutional/workwear garment division supplying finished garments, embellishments and accessory maintenance.

 Rich pickings

 With big-ticket investors choosing to stay out, closed-end funds offer good returns, says Srikumar Bondyopadhyay

 The tagline of an advertisement for a closed-end equity scheme of a mutual fund reads: You have to give time for certain things to grow investment is one of them. 

 The unsaid message of the tagline is that if investors really want big-buck returns, they need to stay invested for a sufficient period of time. This message somewhat militates against the reasoning that you need to time your entry into the market if you want best returns.

 Wanna time it?

 Mutual funds are in the business by peddling the message that it isnt important to time the market. No one can time the market and even investment gurus have seldom got it right on a regular basis. It is a dictum that has been around for a long time. What prompted fund houses to preach the virtues of long-term investment in equity afresh? 

 Heres the backdrop 

 Studies found that trading in mutual fund schemes has become so commonplace that most investors view equities as short-term investments and the average holding period in equity mutual funds declined to eight to nine months by 2005 from three to four years in the early 1990s, when mutual funds used to offer mainly closed-end schemes. 

 The net flows into the mutual fund schemes over the last couple of years were low despite a record increase in gross collections and a buoyant stock market, pointing to a huge churn in investments in mutual funds. 

 Mutual funds have become vehicles for institutions and high net-worth individuals who churn their investments in quick succession without bearing their share of the cost of the funds and thereby eat into the investment of small investors. 

 Small is big now

 Finance minister P. Chidambaram has put an end to this unfair system that was loaded against small investors. At a meeting in Mumbai with the Securities and Exchange Board of India in June this year, Chidambaram discussed whether the income tax benefits extended to equity mutual fund schemes should be discontinued or not. 

 Sebi soon directed that initial issue expenses for open-ended funds could not be amortised and must be charged during the new fund offer period itself. Basically what this meant was that the big-ticket investor who flitted in and out of schemes would also have to share the burden of these expenses instead of loading it on to those who stayed invested in the scheme. 

Change in the air

 The result: hardly any new open-ended scheme has been on offer since then. Mutual funds instead have started offering closed-end schemes. 

 Mutual funds can, over a period of five years, amortise the initial issue costs in closed-end funds.

 Second, fund managers now get the much-needed sticky money for wealth building and wont have to perform under the constant pressure of redemption as in an open-ended scheme. 

 While a number of open-ended schemes could raise thousands of crores of rupees since December last, closed-end equity funds could manage only a few hundred crores. 

 This implies that big-ticket investors are staying away and only genuine investments are coming into closed-end funds. 

 Its a different game

 The closed-end schemes that are being offered now are significantly different from those of the 1990s. Those were typically for a longer horizon, some with a tenor of as many as 15 years. Most did not have an early exit option and investors could only exit by selling the units on stock exchanges. With no market makers, the liquidity was poor and the units traded at huge discounts to their net asset value. 

 But in new schemes, investors are given a more frequent exit option, as quickly as quarterly or half-yearly, based on the NAV of the fund. However, there is an exit load to the extent of the unamortised portion of the cost. For example, if you want to exit the fund after one year, you will have to pay an exit load of 4.25 per cent. But there is no entry fee for joining the scheme. 

 Better bet

 For small investors, the new closed-end schemes are better as the charges they have to pay for an early exit is much lower than the discount at which the units would have traded on the bourses. For example, Morgan Stanley closed-end equity fund is now trading at a 15 per cent discount to its current net asset value. The scheme matures in February 2009. 

 It is argued that fund managers of closed-end funds are able to invest keeping the long term in mind. However, a manager will have to necessarily keep liquidity in mind while investing because of the regular redemptions being offered via an early exit option. 

 The history of closed-end funds in India is not inspiring. Nevertheless, these can add value to an investors portfolio. On a rolling 15-year basis, the sensex has always given a positive return since its inception, the maximum being 27 per cent compounded annually and the minimum, 13 per cent.

 TCS delivers a scorcher

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Oct. 16: Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), the countrys largest software company, today reported a second-quarter profit of Rs 1,019 crore on the back of strong growth in volumes. Its revenues surged 42.43 per cent year-on-year to Rs 4,495 crore. 

 TCS officials said at this pace of growth, the company would be on course to record revenues of $4 billion by the end of this fiscal. Last week, rival Infosys said it would emerge as a $3-billion company. TCS reported a 50.5 per cent growth year-on year in its international business and almost 10.8 per cent growth quarter on quarter. 

 There has been close to 11 per cent growth in volumes this quarter and there has also been a slight improvement in pricing. Our margin expansion has given us such strong growth this quarter, chief financial officer S. Mahalingam said. 

 The EBIDTA margins improved by 305 basis points in the second quarter. The company has seen almost 300 basis points improvement in its margins, out of this 67 basis points has come from the onsite-offshore shift, 50 basis points from forex rates and the rest from cost efficiencies, Mahalingam said.

 Shifting more work offshore may have not helped in the revenue but the margins have certainly seen an improvement as a result, he said. There has also been a close to 3.5 per cent improvement in the margins of existing contracts. 

 The companys integrated full-services model, including Business Intelligence, Consulting, Infrastructure and Assurance services, is driving growth with large customers leading to a 50 per cent jump in the number of customers with over $50 million in annual revenues to 15 during the second quarter, said N Chandrasekaran, global head of sales and operations. 

 Going forward the company will focus more on improving offshore margins, Mahalingam said. The companys offsite business has gone up from 38 per cent to 41 per cent internationally. 

 The company added 58 new clients in this quarter. It had close to five contracts of close to 50 million clients in the pipeline. In the one million-dollar band, the number of customers has gone up from 258 to 274. Its global network delivery model is being rapidly adopted by global customers. 

 Its global development centres in Brazil, China, Uruguay and Hungary are gaining scale with the Brazilian centre crossing the 1,000-employee mark. 

 There has been an addition of 8,919 employees during the second quarter. In India, there were 3,764 campus hires and 4,200 lateral hires. 

 TCS continued to maintain an attrition rate of 10.6 per cent, including BPO. At the end of the second quarter, the total employee strength stood at 78,028.

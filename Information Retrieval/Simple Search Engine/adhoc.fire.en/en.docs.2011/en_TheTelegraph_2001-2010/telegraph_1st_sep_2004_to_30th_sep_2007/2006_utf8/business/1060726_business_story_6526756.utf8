 Ambani duo in fresh duel

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mukesh: Foul and fair

 Mumbai, July 25: The battle between the Ambani brothers escalated today with the Anil camp accusing the Mukesh side of violating every major commitment of the settlement reached between the sides in June 2005.

 The latest salvo was fired after the Mukesh side said last week that its employees were not permitted to use the food plazas and other facilities in the Dhirubhai Ambani Knowledge City at Navi Mumbai, which is now under the control of Anil Ambani.

 The latest spat revolves around the agreement between the two sides over the gas supply from Reliances (RIL) Krishna Godavari basin which should flow to Reliance Energy (REL) to meet the latters feedstock requirements. 

 Sources from the Reliance-ADAG group said according to the agreement, RIL was required to supply close to 28 mmbtu of gas to Reliance Natural Resources (RNRL), which will flow to REL. 

 While the gas will be used for power generation, RNRL has been maintaining that the price of gas under the agreement is the same as the price of gas supplied by RIL to National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) with the price being discovered through a process of international competitive bidding.

 They now allege that the Mukesh Ambani group wants to dishonour the gas supply agreement by delaying the entire process of getting the price of supplying this gas approved by the government. Incidentally, reports said the government was opposed to the sale of gas by RIL to RNRL at a price of $2.3 per mbtu. 

 The Centre is learnt to be opposed to this pricing as it feels that it could lead to a revenue loss. The government earns royalty on gas generated from fields in the country.

 They are deliberately delaying the whole process, sources from R-ADAG said, a charge that the other side rubbished.

 RIL has always fulfilled all its obligations and commitments and would continue to do so in future, a spokesperson from RIL said.

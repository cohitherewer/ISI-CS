 US pact holds out deal hope 

 Kuala Lumpur, Aug. 25 (Reuters): The United States and Asean signed a trade and investment agreement on Friday that opens the door to possible free-trade talks.

 US trade representative Susan Schwab signed the Trade and Investment Framework Agreement in Malaysia with the 10 member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean). 

 The can-do spirit of the members of Asean reflects the can-do spirit we are so proud of in the United States, Schwab said after signing the pact. 

 The agreement with Asean represents an important step forward in trade relations with the region.

 The US is the biggest buyer of Asean goods and the regions largest foreign direct investor, pumping $8.7 billion into the region last year, Asean data shows. 

 In 2004, US demand accounted for 14 per cent of Asean exports. The framework agreement seeks to lower non-tariff barriers to trade and investment and is a necessary first step if both sides want to begin free-trade negotiations. 

 Washington has played down this prospect, though it has a free-trade deal already with Singapore and is in free-trade talks with Malaysia and Thailand.

 Work to build on the pact will 

 involve development of an ASEAN single-window facility to 

 smooth the flow of goods to the United States, and cooperation 

 to foster trade in agricultural goods and new drugs, Malaysian 

 Trade Minister Rafidah Aziz said.

 Spectrum price tag on 3G

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Dear, dear

 New Delhi, Sept. 11: The department of telecommunications (DoT) has decided to tag on a spectrum charge for 3G or third generation services though the quantum and method of pricing has yet to be determined. The 3G services will carry a spectrum charge, said a senior DoT official. The government is still undecided on the method of pricing.

 For 2G and 2.5G, telecom operators did not have to pay separate spectrum charges as these services were offered on the same voice telephony spectrum. However, 3G services need a different spectrum band, the official said. 

 At present, there is a raging debate within the industry on how the spectrum should be allocated. Ratan Tata sent a frisson through the industry by suggesting that there should either be an auction or a flat fee of Rs 1,500 crore for 3G spectrum; Reliance Infocomm and other players are insisting on a payout of Rs 300 crore plus a revenue sharing structure.

 It is still not clear whether 3G spectrum will be priced through an entry fee and annual revenue share or other methods like auction or beauty contest, the official said. Operators now pay a revenue share of 6 per cent to the government. The official also said DoT would decide whether a separate licence was required to offer 3G services after going through the relevant proposal of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai).

 Telecom operators oppose the move, arguing that their current unified access services licences allow them to offer 3G services.

 The Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) the GSM cellular industry lobby also feels that if a selection process needs to be adopted, the auction route should be avoided as it leads to irrational bidding. 

 India is a price-sensitive market, and auctioning of spectrum will result in higher prices, the brunt of which will have to be borne by the end users, COAI director-general T.V. Ramachandran had said in his letter to Trai.

 However, the finance ministry is firm that auctioning is the best route to determine licence fee or revenue share to be paid by telecom firms as spectrum is a scarce resource and the government should let market forces decide. 

COAI, however, believes that although auction could 

determine the highest price for spectrum, high licence fees would either force 

the exit of some firms as happened in some cases in India during the 2G auction, 

or signal post-entry collusion.

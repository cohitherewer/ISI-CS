 CESC numbers glow

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Goenka: Good show

 Calcutta, Jan. 31: CESC Ltd, the flagship of RPG Enterprises, has recorded a 15.6 per cent growth in net profit for the third quarter ended December 31 at Rs 37 crore compared with Rs 32 crore in the same period last fiscal. This was possible on the back of increased operational efficiency and reduced interest cost.

 We have been able to post a strong performance despite an average tariff reduction of 22 paise this year, RPG Enterprises vice-chairman Sanjiv Goenka said.

 The power utility company has also posted a 11.5 per cent growth in its net profit at Rs 135 crore during the first nine months of the current fiscal compared with Rs 121 crore in the corresponding period last year.

 The total income of the company during the quarter was Rs 598 crore, up 7.9 per cent from Rs 554 crore over the same period last year.

 During the first nine months, the income was Rs 1,974 crore, up 9.4 per cent from Rs 1,804 crore. The interest costs have come down by around 17 per cent in the third quarter because of progressive repayment of loans.

 CESC has about Rs 2,000-crore worth loan in its books. Goenka said the company would continue to repay loans from its cash flow.

 While financial management is paying off, the company is also on the job to improve operational efficiency. For instance, transmission and distribution loss in the first three quarters is around 16 per cent.

 Budge Budge 

 Goenka said the proposed 250-mw unit at Budge Budge has received environmental clearance. We hope to make financial closure for the project by June, he said.

 The company is floating tenders for the equipment at present. There are two units at Budge Budge now generating 500 mw. This would be the third unit there, which may see an investment of Rs 1,000 crore.

 Ashok Leyland

 Commercial vehicle maker Ashok Leyland today reported a marginal 1.6 per cent rise in net profit for the quarter ended December 31, 2005, at Rs 54.5 crore against Rs 53.6 crore in the corresponding period last fiscal.

 Calcutta, June 27: Jay Shree Tea amp; Industries Limited has lined up Rs 40-50 crore to acquire gardens in Assam.

 The company produced 14.84 million kg of Assam tea in 2005-06 compared with 14.27 million kg in 2004-05. The total production stood at 20.19 million kg for last fiscal, up from 19.86 million kg in 2004-05.

 ?We are looking for gardens that will help us step up our orthodox production. We want to convert around 20 to 25 per cent of the Assam production to the orthodox with the government providing a subsidy of Rs 3 per kg,? said D.M. Jain, managing director of Jay Shree Tea amp; Industries Limited.

 Jay Shree Tea is also managing two sick Darjeeling gardens since 2003 and 2005. 

 Jain said North Tukvar Tea Company Limited, a subsidiary of Jay Shree Tea, may consider buying these gardens eventually.

 Tea comprised 73.43 per cent of the company?s gross turnover during 2005-06.

 The company generated a total income of Rs 237.04 crore last fiscal compared with Rs 220.73 crore in 2004-05.

 Profit after tax increased from Rs 6.28 crore in 2004-05 to Rs 10.65 crore last fiscal.

 Export revenues, which are expected to cross Rs 30 crore this fiscal, increased to Rs 24.83 crore from Rs 22 crore in 2004-05.

 The company has spent Rs 6 crore to upgrade technology at its call centre at the Software Technology Park in Salt Lake and increase its seats from 90 to 200. Of the total investment, Rs 1 crore was used for capacity expansion.

 ?The call centre could not make headway as its size was not economically viable globally. Efforts are also on to utilise the facilities during the day,? Jain added.

 Auction prices

 In the Calcutta auction today, the Jultibari orthodox sold for a record Rs 2,390 per Kg. It was purchased by Greenfield Exports. The Jutlibari garden belongs to Gillanders Arbuthnot amp; Co Ltd.

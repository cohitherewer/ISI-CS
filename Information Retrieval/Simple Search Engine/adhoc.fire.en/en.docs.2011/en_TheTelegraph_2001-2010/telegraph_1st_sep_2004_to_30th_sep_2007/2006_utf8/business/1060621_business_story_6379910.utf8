 ZTE runs into security wall

 VIVEK NAIR

 Mumbai, June 20: The Chinese are finding it extremely difficult to open a beachhead in Indias vast telecommunications space with two leading players, Huawei Technologies and ZTE Corporation, being stonewalled over security concerns.

 Just over two years ago, Huawei Technologies had submitted an application seeking permission to invest in a manufacturing unit, but failed to win the necessary approvals. Now, ZTE Telecom India Pvt Ltd (ZTE India), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Shenzen-based ZTE Corporation, has also run into a security tangle.

 ZTE India, which is engaged in the manufacture of telecommunication equipment, has failed to secure approvals to undertake new activities such as after-sales service, cash-and-carry wholesale trading and trading in high-tech equipment as the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) has raised objections. 

 At its meeting held last month, the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) put off a decision on ZTEs expansion proposal.

 ZTE India has a paid-up capital of Rs 92 lakh and the subsidiary had approached the FIPB with a plan to increase this capital by allotting additional shares worth Rs 5.05 crore. 

 Of the present paid-up capital of Rs 92 lakh, ZTE China holds 92,0461 equity shares, while ZTE Kangxun Telecom Co Ltd of the Peoples Republic of China holds one equity share. ZTE wants to enter into after sales service directly and through authorised service agents appointed across the country. 

 The company also wants to get into cash-and-carry wholesale trading. It aims to import telecommunication products, such as mobile phone handsets and accessories, to carry on wholesale trade. 

 Since February 2, wholesale trading through the cash-and-carry licences has been placed within the ambit of automatic approvals. However, ZTE had approached FIPB before that date.

 Available documents show that the proposal was referred to the ministry of external affairs (MEA). The MEA advised that the comments of the Intelligence Bureau and RAW should be obtained. 

 RAW raised objections and recommended that the ZTE proposal should be rejected. 

 It is understood that the security agency raised serious apprehensions about the likely fallout of the permission to ZTE to expand its activities. 

 The apprehensions raised were of a broad nature. The security agency did not specify any particular acts of commission and omission by ZTE.

 With reports from other security agencies awaited, the FIPB deferred a decision on the proposal.

 Seal on Mitsubishis Haldia plan

New Delhi, Sept. 18: The government today cleared 26 FDI proposals, including a Rs 342-crore investment by Mitsubishi Chemicals in Bengal and Rs 405 crore by British Gas (BG).

 The government also approved the indirect holding of Egypts Orascom in Hutchison Essar.

 Mitsubishi Chemicals has been allowed to bring in Rs 342 crore as additional investment and lump sum fee beyond the limit permitted under the automatic route for foreign direct investment (FDI) for its Haldia project. The additional funds will help it expand its capabilities in purified terephthalic acid (PTA). 

 BG will utilise the money for its piped natural gas business in Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. The company will build the infrastructure to distribute gas for industry and vehicles in the two states. 

 The government has allowed Scotlands Cairn Energy to set up a holding company to hunt for oil and gas. Cairn will not bring equity capital but has indicated transfer of shares through swapping. The finance ministry said the 26 proposals were worth Rs 993 crore. 

 Hutch-Essar stake

 Hong Kong-based Hutchison Telecom has obtained the clearance to raise its stake in Hutchison Essar to 68 per cent, including the 10 per cent held indirectly by Orascom. The government has taken on record the increase in foreign holding from 49 per cent to 68.09 per cent without any fresh equity. 

 The proposal ran into rough weather after Essar queried the sale by Hutchison Telecom of 19 per cent of its equity to Orascom that allowed the Egyptian company to have an indirect holding in Hutchison Essar. 

 Essar said Hutchison did not seek its approval on the deal with Orascom. It raised issues of security over an Egyptian company with investments in Pakistan holding equity in an Indian company. 

 Essar shot off letters to the PMO, the defence minister and the communications minister to review the shareholding policy in telecom in this regard. The issue was also taken up by the national security adviser. 

 The clearance may allow Hutchison to make an IPO, which was put on hold due to the uncertainty surrounding the proposal. Hutch is the first foreign company, which has increased its stake in an Indian telecom company beyond 49 per cent, after the government had allowed FDI up to 74 per cent in telecom.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Five-year plan sets sights on 40-mt output

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Oct. 20: From a minnow churning out a meagre 5.3 million tonnes of steel for last 98 years, Tata Steel is now well on its course to become a 23.5-mt powerhouse just ahead of its 100 years of existence. 

 Though the Corus deal will place the home-grown company in the top bracket of global steel industry, it refuses to rest on its laurels.

 Soon after announcing the agreement with the Corus Group, Tata Steel managing director B Muthuraman said it now aimed to have a capacity of 40 million tonnes over the next five years with revenue of $32 billion. 

 At present, the entire Tata group, with businesses as diverse as software, hotel, tea, power and chemicals, tots up a revenue of $22 billion.

 The total steel making capacity of the country currently stands at about 40 mt today.

 A close look at the greenfield opportunities that Tata Steel is currently pursuing shows that though the target is ambitious it is highly gettable.

 Though Tata group supremo Ratan Tata did not rule out the possibility of further acquisitions going forward, projects in the three states, Iran and Bangladesh will be enough to reach or even surpass the projected level.

 The company is adding 5 mt capacity at Jamshedpur where its existing unit is located. It also wants to set up a 12-mt unit in Jharkhand in two phases while a memorandum of understanding (MoU) has been signed for a 5-mt greenfield plant in Chhattisgarh, which will also be set up in two phases.

 However, the greenfield project which is closest to fruition is the 6-mt plant at Kalinganagar in Orissa.

 Muthuraman said orders for the plant were being placed and the first phase would be ready by 2009. Tata Steel is also pursuing projects in Iran (3 mt) and Bangladesh (2.4 mt).

 Steel industry experts, however, feel expanding fast through organic route, as compared with acquisitions like Corus, will be far from easy. 

 All the projects are linked to the availability of raw material be it iron ore (locally) or cheap fuel like natural gas (abroad).

 Tata skirted any comparison with Laxmi Niwas Mittal, who is at the top of the heap. 

 I dont think our sights are set to equal or better Lakshmi Mittal, Tata said.

 Asked how long Tata Steel will take to close in on Arcelor-Mittal following the acquisition of Corus, he said the company had no such targets.

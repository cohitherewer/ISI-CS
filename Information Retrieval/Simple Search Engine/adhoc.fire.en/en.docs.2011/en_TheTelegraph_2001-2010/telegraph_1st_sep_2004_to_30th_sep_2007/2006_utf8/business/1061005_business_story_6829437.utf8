 Essar raises $530 m to fund expansion 

 Mumbai, Oct. 4 (PTI): The Ruia family-promoted Essar group has raised over Rs 2,400 crore ($530 million) as loan from international markets to fund its ongoing expansion programmes in existing areas of businesses.

 According to investment banking sources, Essars stake in Hutchison Essar Ltd, the countrys fourth largest mobile service provider, would be used as the security for the loan.

 Hong-Kong based Hutchison Telecommunications International holds a 67 per cent stake in Hutchison Essar, while the remaining 33 per cent is held by the Ruias.

 An Essar spokesperson confirmed that the group has raised the loan. The spokesperson said the loan would help the groups expansion initiatives in existing areas of businesses.

 The Essar group is currently expanding its various business segments, such as steel, oil, power and shipping.

 Standard Chartered Plc is believed to have arranged the loan, which included the equivalent of $120 million in Indian rupee and $410 million in greenback, the sources said.

 The Essar group is consolidating all its businesses in India and worldwide under a Cayman Islands-based global holding company Essar Global Ltd.

 The restructuring process has been under way for the past six months and Ernst and Young has been guiding the group. 

 With the completion of the restructuring, Essar Global will emerge as a diversified conglomerate with interests across six businesses steel, oil and gas, power, shipping and logistics, telecom and BPO and construction.

 Telecom arm delist

 Essar Teleholding, the telecom arm of the Essar group, has fixed the price for delisting its shares from the stock exchanges at Rs 4,990 apiece, higher than its proposed offer price of Rs 4,949 per share.

 The company had announced last month its plans to make itself a closely-held private entity by offering to acquire all the outstanding shares not held by the promoters, estimated at over 1.68 lakh shares and representing 3.37 per cent of its equity capital.

 Essar Teleholdings has informed the Bombay Stock Exchange that the price discovered through a book-building process for the purpose of delisting the shares from all exchanges where they are listed is Rs 4,990 per share, at which maximum number of shares have been tendered.

 Sebi paves way for corporate bonds

 OUR BUREAU

 Mumbai, May 15: The roadmap for a unified exchange traded corporate bond market is now ready ? less than three months after finance minister P Chidambaram promised to initiate steps to create one. 

 A five-member committee set up by Sebi today announced a two-phased plan to create a single trading platform for corporate bonds. 

 The first phase envisages setting up a system to capture all information on trading in corporate bonds as accurately and as close to execution as possible through an authorised reporting platform, the committee said. Sebi will mandate all entities, including brokers, to report trades to the assigned exchange within a specified period of time. 

 In the second phase, market participants will gain experience with trade reporting. Online anonymous order matching of trades will be done with the help of electronic trading platforms by authorised stock exchanges. Such trading platforms can be set up by the stock exchanges or jointly by regulated institutions. Sebi would prepare the guidelines in this regard.

 The committee favours the BSE or the NSE to take the initiative in setting up the platform as they can build on their existing infrastructure. The committee is tilted towards the BSE as it would eliminate conflict of interests... as the shareholders of NSE are banks and financial institutions which by the very nature of their operations are the entities interested in wholesale debt market dealings. 

 After trading on the BSE platform gets stabilised, attempts could be made to delink this activity to a subsidiary jointly set up by the NSE and BSE, with separate clearing and settlement facilities, in about two years.

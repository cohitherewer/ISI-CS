 WPP profit rises 30% in first half

 Sorrell: Ambitious

 London, Aug. 18 (Reuters): WPP Group, the worlds second-biggest advertising and marketing company, said its first-half profit climbed almost 30 per cent on growth in most of its markets, with even lacklustre Britain showing signs of recovery. 

 The owner of ad agencies, including JWT and Young amp; Rubicam, said pre-tax profit for the six months to the end of June was 287 million, or 316 million excluding goodwill, amortisation and other items, at the upper end of analyst expectations.

 Revenue rose 16 per cent to 2.86 billion. Organic revenue, which excludes currency fluctuations and recent acquisitions, was up 5 per cent, ahead of the median analyst forecast of 4.5 per cent. 

 Asia-Pacific is still the engine for growth, while the continued US momentum is encouraging, Numis Securities said in a research note. 

 By region, WPPs like-for-like growth was up 9.4 per cent in Asia-Pacific, Latin America, Africa and West Asia, 4.5 per cent in North America, 4.5 per cent in continental Europe and 1.2 per cent in the UK. 

 Good numbers but as ever, generally hawkish comments from CEO Martin Sorrell, but the stock had a good run expecting this, said one trader. 

 News of a nascent recovery in the countrys media sector will come as a relief to television, newspaper and radio companies, which have struggled through most of the year due to a sluggish economy and sharp declines in ad spending on traditional media. 

 Its stabilised in the first six months but its still not as buoyant as were seeing in continental Europe, chief executive Martin Sorrell said in an interview. I think it will continue to be a bit mucky but next year may be a bit better.

 WPPs online, interactive and direct marketing businesses now make up 20 per cent of revenues, still behind traditional advertising and media buying but growing much more quickly.

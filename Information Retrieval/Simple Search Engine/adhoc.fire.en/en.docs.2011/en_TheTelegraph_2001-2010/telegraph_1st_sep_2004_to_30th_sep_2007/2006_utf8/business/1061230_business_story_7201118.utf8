 Rate hike to boost SBI numbers

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 29: The recent hike in lending rates will help the State Bank of India maintain its profitability.

 The hike in prime lending rate (PLR) will help us maintain profitability. We expect net interest margin to remain at 3 per cent by the end of this fiscal, SBI chairman .P. Bhatt told reporters here.

 Earlier this week, the countrys largest commercial bank had increased the PLR by half a percentage point to 11.5 per cent. The decision is expected to make all loans linked to PLR, whether corporate or retail, expensive.

 SBIs net profit dipped by 2.53 per cent to Rs 1,184.49 crore for the quarter ended September 30 compared with Rs 1,215.36 crore for the same quarter last year.

 The latest PLR hike is the third in the year for SBI. The bank had earlier raised the rate by 50 basis points in April from 10.25 per cent to 10.75 per cent and again in August to 11 per cent.

 Bhatt said SBI also planned to raise Rs 2,000 crore via tier II bonds by March-end.

 He reiterated that SBI would come out with its follow-on public offer next year.

 If the SBI amendment bill is passed by Parliament, it would provide a leeway to the bank to raise further equity, he said.

 The amendments pertain to bringing down the minimum stake the Reserve Bank must hold to 51 per cent from 55 per cent at the moment. At present, RBI holds a little over 59 per cent in SBI.

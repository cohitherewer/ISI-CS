 Big 3G tieup in the works

 Tokyo, April 7 (Reuters): Matsushita Electric Industrial Company and NEC Corp said on Friday they are in talks with top cellphone chip supplier Texas Instruments Inc over a possible cooperation in 3G mobile phones, in what would be the latest cross-border alliance for embattled handset makers in Japan.

 Matsushita and NEC said chip maker NEC Electronics Corp and Panasonic Mobile Communications Co ? Matsushitas cellphone unit ? are also involved in the talks, but declined to go into details, adding nothing concrete has been decided.

 But a source close to the talks said the five companies aim to set up a joint venture to develop microchips and software used in third-generation (3G) mobile phones based on W-CDMA technology to cut costs and offer competitively priced cellphones.

 The microchips, which would control communication functions of mobile phones, will be used in products offered by Matsushita and NEC. They will also be sold in overseas markets where high-speed 3G services are picking up.

 News of the potential alliance lifted shares in NEC, whose earnings have been weighed down by its loss-making mobile phone operations. 

 The comments from Matsushita and NEC, Japans two largest cellphone makers, come after a report in the business daily Nihon Keizai that the five firms would set up a mobile phone components venture in Japan as early as this summer.

 The new entity will likely be capitalised at about 10 billion yen ($85 million), with NEC and Panasonic Mobile each taking a stake of about 30 per cent, while Matsushita, Texas Instruments and NEC Electronics will split the rest equally, the paper said.

 NEC and Matsushita are two of the first companies to offer 3G phones based on the W-CDMA format, but they each only hold a few per cent of the global market, putting them far behind industry leaders such as Nokia and Motorola Inc.

 In Japan, a stronghold market 

 for NEC and Matsushita, competition is intensifying as the 

 mobile phone market saturates and overseas vendors, including 

 LG Electronics Inc and Nokia look to boost their presence, 

 prompting domestic makers to cut costs and seek alliances.

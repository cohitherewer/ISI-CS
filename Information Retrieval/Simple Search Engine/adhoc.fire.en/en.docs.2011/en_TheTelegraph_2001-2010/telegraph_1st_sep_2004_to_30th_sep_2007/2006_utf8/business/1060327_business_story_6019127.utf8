 FDI lessons from Red Land

Soon after making his announcement about the need for capital account convertibility, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh told business leaders that India would need $1.5 trillion in the next five years to sustain a GDP growth of more than 8 per cent, of which $70 billion should be FDI. Analysts have said that, if we want a 10 per cent growth, we need foreign investment to supplement domestic savings. The exponential growth in SEZs is also aimed at attracting more FDI.

 Sure, more foreign investments will be more than welcome. But capital account convertibility is unlikely to be a driver. FIIs are already free to buy equities or sell them and repatriate the money. Real estate has also been opened to them. True, there?s a low ceiling for investment in debt but then, with interest rates going up, who wants to invest in debt? And FDI has nothing to do with convertibility on the capital account ? otherwise China, with its pegged currency, would not be the country to receive the largest amount of FDI.

 More importantly, Chinas average GDP growth rate between 1978 and 1990, was 8.5 per cent, well above Indias average rate of growth even in the past three years. From around 6 per cent in the early eighties Chinas growth rate went up to 15 per cent in the mid-eighties before declining to around 5 per cent in 1990. And the 8.5 per cent average is an estimate arrived at after adjusting for over-estimation ? the official figure is 9 per cent. The period before 1990, however, was also the period in which FDI inflow into China was low. FDI inflow was just $1.77 billion between 1979 and 1982 and it rose to $3.49 billion in 1990. That?s well below India?s FDI of $5.6 billion last fiscal. The point is that China achieved an average growth rate of 8.5 per cent per annum even when FDI inflows were low.

 It?s also said that the main reason why India does not attract FDI is because of the lack of infrastructure. But Yasheng Huang, a China expert at MIT, points out that China?s high rates of growth in the eighties were achieved in spite of the fact that its infrastructure was very poor at that time. China?s infrastructure was built only after it had accumulated the required resources to build it as a result of many years of high growth.

 As a matter of fact, much of Chinas superb infrastructure was built after foreigners started to invest, not before. This is easily seen from the data: In 1991, FDI was $4.37 billion and it more than doubled the next year to reach $11.01 billion, doubling again to reach $27.52 billion in 1993. FDI inflow into China is now around $60 billion per year. Ironically, FDI into China took off only after the Tienanmen Square massacre and after Deng assured foreign investors that China was committed to market reforms. As the world realised the force of the China story, eager investors wanted to buy into it.

 Back home in India, FDI went up to $5.6 billion last fiscal, but that was still lower than the $6.1 billion we attracted in 2001-02. This fiscal, FDI between April and January has been $4.3 billion. With the India story having been sold so successfully, India now has the same opportunities that opened up for China in the early nineties. And as the Chinese example shows, it doesn?t take very long for the FDI trickle to turn into a flood.

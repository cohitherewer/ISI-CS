 PSUs embrace tech to turn coal into gas

 Calcutta, Nov. 12: The government is targeting commercial utilisation of underground coal gassification (UCG) by 2010-11. The technology helps in burning underground coal that cannot be extracted and the resultant gas is supplied through pipelines.

 The ministry has already approved Neyveli Lignite Corporations proposal to fund a pilot project for underground coal gassification in lignite reserves in Rajasthan, said coal ministry secretary H.C. Gupta, while addressing a three-day workshop on UCG organised by Indo-US Dialogue Working Group on Coal and Asia Pacific Partnership Coal Mining Task Force here today. 

 Neyveli Lignite (NLC) has taken up a Rs 11.25-crore UCG project for power generation at Rajasthans Barmer district. NLC has also signed an MoU with the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) to study underground coal gassification in its lignite mines in Tamil Nadu and Rajasthan, Gupta said. 

 Meanwhile, NLC, in a joint venture with Mahanadi Coalfields, is looking for a site to set up a 1000-mw power plant in Orissa. NLC is also in talks with Central Coalfields Ltd to build a 1000-mw power plant at Karanpura.

 ONGC has signed an MoU with Moscow-based NMRC-Skochnsky Institute of Mining for technical collaboration in UCG. It has also signed a joint venture pact with Coal India to undertake pilot projects in two areas under CILs command. 

 UCG has high prospects because of its advantages, such as no land requirement for overburden or fly ash disposal and no exposure of miners to hazardous underground mining. However, a number of issues have to be addressed before commercial exploitation of coal energy through UCG becomes a reality in the country, he added.

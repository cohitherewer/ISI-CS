 Steps to rein in sugar prices

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 29: The government is considering lowering duty on sugar and importing 1 million tonnes to cool down prices that have risen to Rs 21,000 a tonne in north Indian mandis. 

 Sugar in global markets is ruling at about $438-445 a tonne or Rs 19,700-20,000 a tonne, slightly lower than in India. However, if duties are reduced from the current 60 per cent to around 20 per cent, the imported sugar will still be costlier than the domestic variety after paying shipping charges and duties.

 However, officials said direct bulk imports from sugar producing countries could result in lower prices. Prices of the commodity had risen from around Rs 12,000 a tonne in the wholesale market two years ago to nearly Rs 19,000 in December when the government last intervened by releasing its stock in the market.

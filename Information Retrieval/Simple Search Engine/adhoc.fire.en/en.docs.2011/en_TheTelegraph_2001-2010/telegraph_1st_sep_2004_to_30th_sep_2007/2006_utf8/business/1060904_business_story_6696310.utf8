 Forced saving

 Hazy about provident fund schemes? Srikumar Bondyopadhyay fills you in

 When you join a company, 12 per cent of your basic salary is deducted every month on a mandatory basis towards a provident fund, which is tax exempt. A matching contribution by the employer is also added to this savings that accumulate till you retire.

 Provident fund (PF) is the most important social security for salaried people. Hence, PF constitutes an integral part of financial planning of any salaried individual. How one handles ones provident fund will make a huge difference to ones financial goals.

 An employee can join a provident fund in three ways: first, by saving in an unexempt fund, the Employees Provident Fund under the Employees Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO); second, by investing in a company-run exempt fund approved by the EPFO; and, third, by subscribing to a company-run excluded fund.

 If you dont know about exempt and excluded provident funds, here is an account. 

 If you are working in a company that employs more than 20 people, the company comes within the ambit of the Provident Fund Act. All such companies have to comply with this act, which requires them to subscribe to a provident fund trust. 

 Companies can join the unexempt Employees Provident Fund, which is administered by the EPFO set up under the PF act. 

 They can opt for a private provident fund trust, which is exempted under section 17 of the PF act and approved by the EPFO, but doesnt come under the direct administration of the EPFO. Such an exempt fund is, however, obliged to give at least the rate fixed by the EPFO. The exempt funds are covered by the PF act.

 Companies can also create a private fund which is excluded from the purview of the PF act, but is set up under the provisions of the Income-Tax Act governing provident fund exemptions. The income tax authority specifies the investment pattern for provident funds and only those that abide by the guidelines are eligible for income tax benefits.

 Why are there so many provident funds? 

 Exempt and excluded fund managers say they give a better return than the EPF. There are two reasons for this: first, they dont have to pay administration and other charges to the EPF and, second, these employees funds claim to be better managed in private hands than the EPF. 

 This is not entirely true. While exempt funds are bound to give a minimum return which is the EPFO-declared interest rate, there is no such assured or declared rate of return in excluded funds.

 The investment regulations for provident funds at present do not allow them beyond government debt instruments. In a falling interest rate regime, it is tough to fork out a 9.5 per cent interest (till 2004-05). 

 While the EPF went in for deficit funding for the last two years, exempt funds managed with employers tried to make up for the deficit by transferring company resources. 

 When the EPFO revised its interest rate to 9.5 per cent in 2004-05 after two years, many exempt funds had been paying out an interest rate of 8.5 per cent; they had to credit the remaining 1 per cent from other accounts.

 The situation is even worse when it comes to excluded funds. There is no official statistics available for them. It is estimated that the size of funds under the management of excluded funds may be anywhere between Rs 80,000 crore and Rs 1,00,000 crore. The total fund size of the EPF and exempt funds is Rs 2,20,000 crore.

 When an excluded fund defaults, there is no other way to settle the claim but to go to court. This is because these funds dont come under any regulator and they are outside the purview of the PF act.

 The EPF and exempt funds, on the contrary, are administered by the EPFO. Excluded funds dont give pension and insurance benefits like the EPF and exempt funds.

 In the case of the EPF and exempt funds, contributions made by an employee and the employer is defined. But that is not so in the case of excluded funds. The trust rules allow for a lower contribution by the employer for excluded funds.

 For the EPF and exempt funds, the contribution breakup is: EPF employer 3.67 per cent, EPF employee 12 per cent, EPS (employee pension scheme) employer 8.33 per cent (up to a basic salary of Rs 6,500), EPS government 1.16 per cent, and EDLI (employees deposit-linked insurance) employer 0.50 per cent.

 The total savings thus works out to be 25.66 per cent. However, the percentage is only 24 per cent in case of excluded funds.

 EPF is more tax efficient than the other two. 

 Withdrawal of money before a minimum of five years of membership in either exempt fund or excluded fund is taxable. 

 Another important point about the EPF is that the trust cannot use the unclaimed kitty for any purpose. The EPF has recently started an initiative through advertisements in the media and dialogue with employers to trace employees who havent collected their money years after maturity. 

 How many exempt and excluded funds do this?

 People dont withdraw their money from us because here they get a high assured return, said an EPF official. The money lying in the unclaimed accounts with the EPF attracts interest at the declared rate.

 New Delhi, Jan 15: Heat, Zeus, Gladiator and many more. The mean machines are gearing up.

 Even as quite a few biggies ? Royal Enfield, Honda, LML and Kinetic ? decided to give this year?s auto expo a miss, there was enough tech, power, style and pizzazz on display at the show.

 In terms of sheer footfalls, Bajaj stole a march over its peers. On display was a powerful DTS-Fi, equipped with a rear disc brake, oil cooler and projector headlamps. The bike is expected to hit the roads within this calendar year.

 There was also the Pulsar 180, a bigger and sturdier version from the Pulsar range, due for launch anytime during the next 12 months. Then there was the Sonic, a bike primarily aimed at the flashy and flamboyant urban teens.

 Bajaj did not disappoint the classical scooter connoisseurs either. While there was the lean and sleek Kristal for the college-going girls, it also displayed the Blade that has a distinct Italian macho style and gait. 

 The next-generation Wave from the Bajaj stable had a sneak preview. 

 According to Rajiv Bajaj, managing director of Bajaj Auto, the company is planning to roll out more models this year.

 Yamaha Motor India, which has lined up an investment of Rs 300 crore over the next two years, had the Gladiator on show. However, not much is known about the technical and engine specifications of the bike. The company?s new CEO, Tomohaka Ishikawa, hinted that a roll out from the group could be expected soon.

 Also on display was the 50th anniversary R1, the new 17,000-rpm R6, the sturdy M1 and the Stratoliner, FZs, although they are not meant for the Indian market, at least for now.

 Yamaha?s entry into the scooter segment remained speculative.

 Interestingly, the company is planning to launch ?urban lifestyle and commuter shops?. The shops are expected to be on the same lines as Probiking showrooms of Bajaj Auto.

 Suzuki is re-entering India with its motorcycles after two years since it had snagged ties with TVS. The Japanese automaker unveiled two bikes ? the Heat and the Zeus for the mass market here.

 The company also announced its plan to enter the scooter market in India. The two 125-cc motorcycles will be launched commercially in March this year. The Heat is targeted at the rural and semi-urban markets.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 GSPC needs $3 bn for eastern drill

 S.P.S. PANNU

 Wheel of fortune

 New Delhi, July 3: Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation is targeting commercial production from its eastern offshore deep-sea gas field by the end of 2008.

 A senior official told The Telegraph that Gujarat State Petroleum (GSPC) would need around $3 billion to develop the field.

 Reliance Industries is also aiming to start commercial production from its giant D6 field in the Krishna-Godavari basin at around the same time. 

 Global oil firms Exxon-Mobil, Total, British Gas and British Petroleum are believed to have evinced interest in the GSPC-discovered gas field in the KG basin. 

 These firms have made presentations to the state-owned company on their respective business models for the gas field. Global firms prefer buying discovered oil and gas fields than invest in exploration blocks as they promise quick returns with less risk. Flush with funds, these companies can afford the more expensive discovered fields.

 While domestic firms like ONGC, GAIL and Indian Oil Corporation have also expressed interest in picking up a stake in the field, the GSPC official said, No formal offer has been received from any Indian company. The Gujarat government is likely to select the partner after considering the techno-economic inputs provided by GSPC.

 Among Indian firms eyeing a stake in the gas field, ONGC is the clear front runner. The petroleum ministry will also back ONGC since its core competence lies in this area. It also has deeper pockets than GAIL or IOC. 

 GSPC has struck gas again in the second well spudded in the field which confirms that the field has substantial reserves. 

 GSPC claims that the field contains more than 20 trillion cubic feet of gas on the basis of the first successful well which flowed 10 million standard cubic feet of gas per day from only a 10 metre interval.

 However, director-general of hydrocarbons, V.K. Sibal has said an estimate of the reserves cannot be made on the basis of a single well and the results of further production testing would have to come in before arriving at a creditable figure.

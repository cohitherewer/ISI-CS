 Big business

 Mumbai, Oct. 4: Welspun Gujarat Stahl Rohren Ltd has formed an alliance with Volzhsky Pipe Plant (VTZ), a member of the TMK group, Russias largest manufacturer and exporter of pipe products in the oil and gas sector. Welspun will invest close to $150 million in the joint venture where it will hold a 40 per cent stake.

 The transaction will provide for the transfer of TMKs long diameter (LD) pipe business to the joint venture. Welspun will deliver high-tech longitudinal submerged arc welded (LSAW) pipe welding line, bending facility and external and internal coating lines on the site of Volzhsky Pipe Plant in the Volgograd region of Russia.

 The start-up of LSAW is scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2007 by which the joint ventures total capacities are expected to be more than 1.2 million tonnes per annum of large-diameter welded pipes.

 LD pipes are used in the construction of oil and gas trunk pipelines. Russias largest consumers of these products are Gazprom and Transneft. TMK also sells line pipes to Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and other countries of CIS and the Caspian region.

 TMK general director Konstantin Semerikov said, The TMK-Welspun association enables the company to expand its participation in pipeline projects not only in Russia and the CIS but beyond. The product offering, coupled with unique production facilities that enable TMK to execute large-scale orders, will contribute to the development of the oil and gas industry.

 We look forward to consolidate our global presence through the formation of this joint venture, said B.K. Goenka, Welspuns vice-chairman and managing director. He added that the partnership will complement Welspuns submerged arc weld production capabilities with TMKs strong regional presence and extensive sales and marketing expertise, thereby enabling the partners to provide products for onshore and offshore line pipe requirements.

 Dollar climbs to five-month high

 London, Oct. 10 (Reuters): The dollar surged to this years high against a broadly weaker yen on Tuesday and hit a 5-month peak versus the Swiss franc, driven by expectations the US economy might be in better shape than previously thought. 

 Last weeks revisions to US non-farm payrolls data and recent upbeat comments from Federal Reserve officials made some investors rethink the possibility the US central bank would cut interest rates next year. 

 Investors are eyeing this weeks releases of the minutes of the Feds September policy meeting and the Beige Book, the Feds snapshot of the health of the economy, for more clues on rates. 

 The dollar managed to strengthen (since the payrolls). We will receive lots of important data this week that will give an assessment on the Feds situation, said Johan Javeus, currency strategist at SEB Merchant Banking in Stockholm. 

 In any case (a US slowdown) is not a clear-cut signal for selling dollars because it will cause central banks outside the U.S. to stop raising rates. 

 By 1135 GMT, the dollar had risen to a 10-month high of 119.69, up 0.4 per cent on the day. 

 The dollar also hit a three-month high of $1.2533 per euro and a 5-1/2 month peak of 1.2695 Swiss francs. The yen, which fell after North Korea said on Monday it had conducted a nuclear test, has been under pressure due to Japans low interest rates. 

 Even if the BoJ has begun raising interest rates its a slow process. The yen will remain hampered by low interest rates. Also as Japanese growth improves, this all goes to raise domestic risk appetite. Japanese investors will become more prone to investing abroad, Javeus said. 

 US outlook 

 Since the large upward revision to US non-farm payrolls data last week, markets have trimmed expectations the Fed would cut interest rates from the current 5.25 per cent next year. San Francisco Fed President Janet Yellen said on Monday risks were tilted toward higher inflation even as growth has slowed.

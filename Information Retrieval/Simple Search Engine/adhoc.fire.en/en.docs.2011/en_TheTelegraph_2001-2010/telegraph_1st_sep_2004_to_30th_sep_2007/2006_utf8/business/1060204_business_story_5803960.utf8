 Banks want tax relief on new bonds

 Chidambaram: Help at hand

 Mumbai, Feb. 3: Bankers are expecting finance minister P. Chidambaram to provide tax sops to perpetual bonds in this years budget to attract investors. The Reserve Bank of India had recently allowed banks to raise resources through perpetual bonds and other innovative instruments.

 Such incentives, they said, would be crucial in creating an appetite for these instruments as they have not yet been tested in the domestic market. 

 Last month, the central bank announced detailed guidelines to enable banks to raise funds by issuing additional instruments such as innovative perpetual debt instruments (IPDI) eligible for inclusion as Tier 1 capital and debt capital instruments, which can be included as Upper Tier II capital. This will provide the banks additional options for raising capital funds to meet the increasing business requirements as well as the upcoming Basel II norms that will be implemented from March 2007.

 While public sector banks such as Union Bank of India are tapping the equity markets, industry sources said nationalised banks will look at raising capital through the new instruments by the end of this calendar year.

 Though bankers have welcomed the Reserve Bank move, they feel that there will be some initial problems since these instruments are new to the market. 

 There will be some teething problems. These relate to the pricing and periodicity and creating a market for such instruments. We also need to convince investors to buy them. The finance minister, who has taken a great deal of interest in allowing banks to issue such innovative instruments, will have to come up with some tax incentives to make it attractive for investors, a senior Dena Bank official said.

 At present, the interest income earned by an individual after investing in bonds that are largely infrastructure- related or those issued by municipal corporations are tax-free. 

 There are also capital gains bonds issued by NHAI or Nabard. 

 Other instruments such as equity-linked savings schemes of mutual funds also provide tax benefits for investments up to Rs 1 lakh.

 Calcutta, July 14: The National Association of Software and Services Companies (Nasscom) wants the old software technology parks of India (STPI) model to continue. The association is not in favour of the new special economic zone (SEZ) act, which puts a minimum land requirement of 25 acres for IT parks.

 The organisation has also suggested that a hybrid model be built based on both models as the new provision in the SEZ act would prefer larger companies by default.

 ?The current SEZ act, with its minimum requirement of 25 acres for IT projects, may be suitable for manufacturing units but not for a sector like IT. We are not in the business of land development. Many small and medium companies cannot afford 25 acres, whereas the industry thrives on small start-ups which become future big guns,? said Kiran Karnik, chairman of Nasscom.

 Karnik was speaking at Nasscom ITeS/BPO Conclave East 2006.

 The association has been trying to convince the government to modify the act for IT companies. Moreover, tax exemptions under the STPI model expires on March 31, 2009, and IT companies have to opt for the SEZ counterpart.

 However, Jairam Ramesh, minister of state for commerce and industry, feels differently.

 When contacted, he said, ?Indian IT companies do not need tax sops to be competitive. They have and, therefore, could leverage many sources of intrinsic competitive advantage. If anything, the manufacturing sector needs tax breaks.?

 Karnik in turn added that stipulations on the export quantity or rate of employment in the SEZ act for IT companies would have been more plausible.

 As a result of the land clause, the maximum benefits are being reaped by developers who often hike rent rates from Rs 25 to Rs 30 per sq ft to Rs 150 per sq ft as they know the company will get SEZ benefits, Karnik said.

 ?Around 40 per cent of our employees are women, so it?s not viable for us to move too far away from city limits. But within the city area it is next to impossible to acquire 25 acres. And in order to avail of the exemptions post March, 2009 there is no way but to become a part of such an SEZ project,? said N. Ranjit, chief executive officer (BPO services), HCL Technologies.

 The industry feels another form of licence Raj is being encouraged with the stipulation of 150 SEZs.

 The STPI benefits have worked effectively till date unlike the SEZ benefits, which are restricted to a geographic area.

 Thus the whole programme of decentralised growth, which is beginning in the IT sector, could be hampered by the area-specific SEZ act.

 The exports from ITeS and BPO services is expected to cross $8 billion this fiscal, which was $6.3 billion a year ago.

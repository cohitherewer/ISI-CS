 Flender gets new chief

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 4: Flender Limited has announced a change in its top management following a change in its holding structure.

 The industrial gearbox company has declared Thirumala Rao as the new managing director designate with immediate effect.

 Rao takes over from S. Mullick, who had been the managing director since February 2003.

 Rao had joined Flender as a trainee and rose to head the Kharagpur Works. After about a year elsewhere, he again joined Flender. He will formally take over as the managing director on October 1, 2006.

 With Flender now becoming a part of the Siemens conglomerate, both the companies stand to derive substantial synergistic advantages. Siemens is a leader in automation and drives. The portfolio of Flender will further complement its offerings and consolidate its position in the fast growing industrial market, said Udo-E Land, chairman of Flender.

 Flender AG (a 100 per cent subsidiary of Siemens AG) and Siemens hold a 50 per cent stake each in Flenders.

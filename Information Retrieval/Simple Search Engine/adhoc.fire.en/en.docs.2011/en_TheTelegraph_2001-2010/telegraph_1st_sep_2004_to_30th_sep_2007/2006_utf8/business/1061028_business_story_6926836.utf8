 State reaches out for yen funds

 Sen: Nippon connection

 Calcutta, Oct. 27: Bengal has sought closer economic ties with Japan, which already has a significant presence in the state.

 Industry minister Nirupam Sen, industry secretary Sabyasachi Sen and WBIDC managing director Debasis Som discussed with Japanese government officials and with representatives of Japanese agencies, chambers of commerce and private companies the possibility of investments for Bengal during their recent visit to the country.

 The visit is important since Japan, which has made its single largest investment in the state, was peeved with the states decision to hand over the construction of the Kukrahati-Raichak bridge to the Salim Group of Indonesia.

 The Japanese government had funded six flyovers in Calcutta and supported many power projects. The state government was also courting the Japanese for the bridge which will reduce the distance between Calcutta and Haldia.

 Sen, briefing the media on his Japan trip, said he explained the circumstances behind the Salim Group winning the contract.

 To compensate, the state has sought Japanese participation in a bigger infrastructure project the East- West Metro corridor for the city.

 Sen did the pre-marketing for the project as a precursor to a formal proposal to Japan.

 The proposal will be forwarded to the Centre which will decide on whether to recommend the project for financial assistance.

 We are yet to send a formal proposal to Centre. We have apprised the Japanese government that such a proposal would come its way soon, he said.

 The government also invited Japan to set up a industrial park exclusively for Japanese small and medium enterprises (SMEs) that will offer an ambience akin to their taste and choice.

 Sen also met representatives of Japanese auto majors and visited some of their factories, including Toyota Motors and component maker Denso Corporation. 

 He also met representatives of government agencies such JBIC, Jetro and JICA.

 On his return from Japan, the delegation had a stopover at Singapore where they met former prime minister Goh Chok Tong, among others.

 He held discussions with Changi airport and Singapore sea-port officials for their possible participation in developing the second airport in Calcutta and a deep sea port on the Bay of Bengal.

 The Centre is set to appoint a consultant to do the feasibility study for deep sea port.

 Sabyasachi Sen said that 13 international companies would make a presentation before the committee on November 3 in Calcutta.

 The Centre has approved Rs 20 crore for the study.

 Nirupam Sen, on his trip to Japan, met Katsuhito Asano, senior vice-minister for foreign affairs, Mitoji Yabunaka, deputy minister for foreign affairs and Masakazu Toyoda, director-general of the trade policy bureau.

 The issues discussed in these meetings included setting up manufacturing projects in India including Bengal, infrastructure facilities in the state and state support, including fiscal benefits to special economic zones.

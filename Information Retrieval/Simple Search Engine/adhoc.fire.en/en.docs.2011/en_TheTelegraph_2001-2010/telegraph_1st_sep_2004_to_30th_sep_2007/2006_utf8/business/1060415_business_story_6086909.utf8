 Orascom awaits Hutch call on board berth

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, April 14: The first deadline has come and gone ? and Orascom still doesnt have a nominee on the board of directors of Hutchison Essar Ltd.

 An Orascom nominee should have been appointed to the Hutchison Essar board no later than March 31 under the terms of the shareholders agreement that Orascom Telecom Holdings and Hutchison Telecommunications Investment Holdings Ltd (HTIHL) signed on December 21 last year.

 Under the deal, Orascom bought a 19.3 per cent stake in Hutchison Telecommunications International (HTIL).

 The stake purchase in HTIL had also given Orascom Telecom ? the Egyptian telecom services provider which is aggressively expanding into markets in South Asia ? a 10 per cent indirect stake in Hutchison Essar and the promise of a director on its board.

 The deal also said that till such time that an Orascom nominee came on board, the Egyptian company should have an observer status on the Hutchison Essar board. The agreement also said Hutchison Telecom would facilitate the process. 

 Hutchison doesnt appear to have pushed for a board position on Hutchison Essar for an Orascom nominee ever since the Ruias of Essar approached the department of telecommunications (DoT) for a clarification on whether or not government approvals were required for such a backdoor entry by Orascom into Indias telecom sector.

 The Ruias, who claim to be the largest single stakeholder in Hutchison Essar with an over 33 per cent holding, are clearly miffed that the Hong Kong conglomerate did not consult it at all before closing the deal with Orascom.

 The whole issue turned even more controversial after national security adviser M.K. Narayanan informed the DoT that Orascom posed a threat to the country because of its telecom investments in neighbouring Pakistan and Bangladesh.

 A Telegraph questionnaire sent to Hutchison Telecom met with a guarded response. Asked whether the two sides had agreed to extend the March 31 deadline and how soon they expected an Orascom nominee to find a place on the Hutchison Essar board, a Hutchison Telecom spokesperson said: These are matters between the parties concerned. If and when required or appropriate, announcements will be made.

 A similar questionnaire sent out to Orascom Telecom drew no response.

 Thinking big

 Orascom has big ambitions in South Asia: it already runs Mobilink, a leading cellphone service provider in Pakistan, and Banglalink in Bangladesh. Its now looking at two new markets ? India and Israel. Oddly enough, the Orascom thread binds both countries.

 In Israel, Orascom is looking to pick up a stake of about 10 per cent in Partner Communications from Hutchison Telecom and this is subject to government approval which hasnt yet come through. If and when it secures approval to pick up the stake in Partner Communications, Orascom will be able to exercise an option to pick up another 3.69 per cent stake in HTIL and thereby increase its indirect stake in Hutchison Essar.

 Hutchison Telecom stonewalled questions on this as well.

 In one sense, it doesnt really matter when Orascom gets its nominee on board at Hutchison Essar. The Egyptian company now has two nominees ? owner Naguib Sawiris and Aldo Mareuse ? on the board of HTIL and will, therefore, surely have access to all documents and will be privy to all the deliberations of the Hutchison Essar board.

 Next step forward

 The government now has to come out with an unequivocal policy on telecom takeovers which will clearly state whether telecom companies like Orascom can pick up an indirect stake in Indian telecom companies by acquiring shares in overseas holding companies. Orascom and Hutchison dont think they have done anything wrong; the Ruias and the Left parties feel there is something amiss if the government has no oversight over stakeholders in Indian telecom companies.

 There have been reports that the government will insist on approvals by the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) before deals like the Hutchison Telecom-Orascom agreement can give effect to shareholding and board-level changes in Indian telecom companies.

 There is just a possibility that Hutchison and Orascom may be asked to seek FIPB approval as well. When asked to comment on such a possibility, the Hutchison Telecom spokesperson said: Hutchison Essar complies with regulations at all times and it will do likewise with any changes as and when they are introduced. Our policy is not to comment on regulatory changes that are reported to be mooted.

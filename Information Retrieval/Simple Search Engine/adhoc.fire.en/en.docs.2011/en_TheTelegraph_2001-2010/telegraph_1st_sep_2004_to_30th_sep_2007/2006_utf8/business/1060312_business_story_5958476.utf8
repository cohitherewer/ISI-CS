 Sriperumbudur, March 11: The world?s largest mobile phone maker Nokia opened its first manufacturing facility in India at Sriperumbudur in Chennai.

 ?India is amongst the top five telecom markets in the world and we estimate that the country will become the world?s second biggest mobile device market in terms of volume by 2010,? said Jorma Ollila, chairman and chief executive officer of Nokia. 

 Nokia?s factory in India, set up at a cost of $150 million, is its tenth such facility in the world and the fourth in Asia. 

 However, the factory will initially manufacture only low and mid-range GSM handsets, including the Nokia 1100 model. 

 ?We are adding significant presence in the Asia Pacific region and we expect our India operations to play a key role in supporting the growing demand for mobile handsets and network infrastructure in the region. We will gradually make India an export hub catering mainly to the Southeast Asian countries,? said Ollila. 

 Built up in 23 weeks, the plant commenced commercial production from January 2 this year and has already made over one million handsets. The facility currently has around 1100 employees. 

 ?The Nokia factory in India will become profitable in the first year of operations,? said Raimo Puntala, senior vice-president (operations and logistics) at Nokia. 

 India, with a wireless user base of 85.4 million, adds more than four million new users each month and low-cost phones are fuelling the demand growth in a cost-sensitive market. More than 50 million handsets are expected to be sold this year in the country, compared with 34 million last year. Service providers are expanding networks in hitherto untapped rural areas where two-thirds of the population lives. 

 The Union government has set a target to more than double the total number of mobile-phone users in the country to 200 million by next year and is encouraging local manufacturing of equipment and cheaper handsets to meet this goal. ?We want to reach a figure of 500 million telephone lines by 2010,? said J.S. Sarma, chairman, Telecom Commission. 

 ?We are also working closely with telecommunication service providers to reduce the cost of ownership and make more affordable and attractive handsets,? Ollila said. 

 Nokia also announced that 8 to10 global and domestic component suppliers and service providers will be located within the Nokia India Telecom Industry Park.

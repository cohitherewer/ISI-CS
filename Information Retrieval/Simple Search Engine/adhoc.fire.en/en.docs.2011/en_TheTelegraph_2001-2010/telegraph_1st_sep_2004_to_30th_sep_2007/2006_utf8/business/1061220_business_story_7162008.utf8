 Glaxo clinches Danish drug deal

 London, Dec. 19 (Reuters): GlaxoSmithKline Plc has bought global rights to Danish biotech company Genmabs most promising new drug, a treatment for leukaemia, in a record deal worth up to $2.1 billion, the two firms said on Tuesday. 

 The agreement is the biggest ever clinched by a biotech company, eclipsing a $2-billion alliance between ImClone Systems Inc and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co that was revised down in 2002 when ImClones drug Erbitux hit snags. 

 Genmab shares surged as much as 24 per cent to a new all-time high of 424 Danish crowns in early trading, valuing the business which has yet to make a profit at close to $3 billion. 

 The deal is the latest in a string of product acquisitions by large pharmaceutical firms eager to tap biotech know-how to boost their drug pipelines, and the price paid reflects the fierce competition for late-stage assets. It covers HuMax-CD20, an experimental human antibody in late-stage development for CD20 positive B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and follicular non-Hodgkins lymphoma. 

 The drug, which is also in Phase II trials for rheumatoid arthritis, is similar to MabThera/Rituxan from Roche Holding AG and Genentech Inc. 

 Genmabs chief executive said she was confident that HuMax-CD20, which is expected to be filed for regulatory approval by 2008, could generate well over $2 billion in annual sales. 

 I think potential sales are higher than that and when you see the deal value, you can see that they (Glaxo) believe (that) also, Lisa Drakeman told Reuters in a telephone interview. 

 Some analysts have pencilled in potential sales of as much as $5 billion in cancer and arthritis, she noted. 

 Jyske Bank analyst Frank Andersen, who forecasts peak sales of $2.8 billion, raised his rating on Genmab shares to buy from accumulate on the deal, saying that regulatory approval for HuMax-CD20 for its three uses would put a fair value of 470 crowns on the stock.

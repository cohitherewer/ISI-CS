 Sebi turns heat on mutual funds

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, April 4: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has cracked the whip on mutual funds. 

 The market regulator has brought in new norms for dividend distribution to curb the lure of hefty payout to sell mutual fund schemes. 

 According to the circular issued today, the dividend amount and the record date fixed by the trustees will have to be communicated to the public within one day and the record date has to be within five days of the issue of such notice. 

 Advertisements featuring dividend rates will also have to indicate prominently that the net asset value of the fund will come down to the extent of the pay-out after the dividend record date. 

 The mutual fund industry feels that though the move to curb the misuse of dividend payout is in the right direction, it might not prove to be significant.

 Mutual funds always plan dividend internally and all sales activity are centred around that. They will only get the dividend quantum and the record date mandated legally prior to the record date, said Dhirendra Kumar of Value Research. 

 So, while it might not alter the way the funds are sold, it will be a step towards bringing about some sanity in the whole process, said fund analysts. 

 The market regulator has also disallowed open-ended mutual fund schemes to amortise initial issue expenses to the fund. Only close-ended mutual funds have been permitted to charge such expenses to the fund. 

 For open-ended schemes, sales, marketing and other expenses shall be met from the entry load and not through initial issue expenses. 

 Since closed-ended schemes have been allowed to amortise initial issue expenses, they shall not be able to charge entry load.

 It is a very significant move and is extremely beneficial for mutual fund investors, more so for the long-term and retail investors, Kumar said.

 Earlier, mutual funds were allowed to amortise the initial issue expenses, which could be as high as 4-5 per cent, for an extended period. 

 While many investors opted out of the fund in the short run, long-term investors stayed back to bear the burden of such costs, which could then go up to as much as 10 per cent, Kumar said. 

 However, some fund houses like Fidelity, Franklin Templeton and Birlas have been charging issue expenses from the entry load and not to the fund. Now, this clear guideline will ensure the same for others too, he added.

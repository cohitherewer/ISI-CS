 Assocham budget offer

 New Delhi, Dec. 26 (PTI): Assocham has submitted its pre-budget wish list to the finance ministry, which seeks to integrate multiple indirect taxes under goods and services tax and promote investments in the country. 

 The chamber has chalked out a strategy to sustain the current growth level of 8 per cent and subsequently put India on a growth trajectory of over 9 per cent during the Eleventh Plan period, Assocham said in a statement.

 In its pre-budget wish list, the chamber sought measures to increase productive investment, promote India as a hub for entrepreneurs and encourage repatriation of profits from overseas. It also sought creation of a common market for growth and competitiveness and integration of multiple indirect taxes under GST.

 The government should set up an empowered committee consisting of state and central government representatives to finalise the structure of GST and road map for its implementation, the statement said.

 The chamber has also suggested phasing out the CST or reducing it to 2 per cent from April 1, 2007.

 India needs to increase the rate of investment from the current 33-34 per cent to 39-40 per cent of GDP for accelerated economic growth. A large portion of this has to be invested on key infrastructure sectors such as power, ports, roads, airports, roads, mining and services, Assocham president Anil Agarwal said.

 Assocham recommended that where the Indian shareholding in an overseas company is more that 40 per cent, the dividend remittance from such company to India should be exempted from Indian income tax.

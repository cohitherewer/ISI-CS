 Calcutta, April 8: The Goodricke Group is looking at agriculture as a possible avenue of diversification in India. 

 Camellia Plc, Goodrickes holding company in the UK, has expertise in crops like edible nuts ? macadamia and pistachio ? as well as citrus fruits like grapes, pineapple, avocado, arable crops and rubber.

 We are conducting a study internally to chalk out possibilities. The venture could be located in Bengal or outside, wherever opportunities are more. Camellia has made such successful diversifications in countries like Bangladesh, said M.C. Perkins, chairman of Camellia Plc.

 The company has no immediate plans of acquiring tea gardens but is open to the idea if it finds the right garden at the right price, said Peter A. Leggatt, chairman of the Goodricke group.

 The Indian operations would mainly update existing infrastructure like the instant tea plant in north Bengal at Aibheel Tea Garden to meet demand, said Krupakaran David, managing director of the Goodricke Group of Companies.

 The worlds instant tea consumption is around 8000 tonnes. India, Kenya and Sri Lanka together produce this amount. Therefore, the market for instant tea is very price conscious. Moreover, there is a slowdown in Japan, David added.

 Goodricke, which produces 600 tonnes of instant tea, exports it to the Philippines and Malaysia .

 Goodricke is also looking at product developments in India in segments like green tea and a low-cost tea variety for factories in Kenya and Sri Lanka. 

 The company would also look at other instant tea variations like flavoured tea, flavoured powder, boutique tea customised for buyers and other variations like tablets and paste.

 Camellia, which operates tea gardens and other allied activities in Bangladesh, Kenya, Malawi, UK, the US and Brazil, has lost around 2-3 million kg due to the Kenyan drought. Production in Kenya is down by 20 per cent.

 David said Goodricke will not participate in the tea tourism project, in which bungalows on tea estates are let out to tourists, as the company does not have spare properties. A meeting with the chief minister has also taken place in this regard.

 The packet tea business of Goodricke witnessed a volume growth of 19 per cent and the current production is 6 million Kg with a market share of 5 per cent which the company expects to consolidate further.

 The company had a gross turnover of Rs 210 crore in 2005 compared with Rs 193 crore in 2004. 

 Prices remained subdued and substantially lower than in 1998 when the last Kenyan drought took place. In 1998, the price of north Indian tea had peaked to Rs 80.22 per kg, which fell to Rs 71.59 per kg in 2004 and further dropped to Rs 63.58 per kg in 2005.

 Darjeeling tea prices attracted a small premium but the price of Assam orthodox fell by Rs 20 per kg as Iran did not operate in the market last year. 

 The total manufactured crop output was marginally higher at 17.7 million kg compared with 17.23 million kg in 2004, which includes a crop loss of 1.3 million kg due to the 14-day strike in Dooars.

 RCoVL overseas deal at a premium

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, March 22: Reliance Communications Ventures Ltd (RCoVL) has completed its international offering of foreign currency convertible bonds (FCCBs) at a conversion price of Rs 480.68 ? a premium of 50 per cent to the closing price of the share on Tuesday.

 The FCCB offering fetched $500 million. The bonds have a maturity period of five years and one day and carry an yield-to-maturity of 4.65 per cent per annum, which the company says reflects a competitive pricing of Libor minus around 50 basis points.

 The FCCBs are expected to be listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange. 

 According to RCoVL, if the FCCBs are fully converted into stocks, the equity capital would increase by around 4.62 crore shares. This would represent only 2 per cent of the fully diluted equity capital after the recently announced reorganisation in the group. Deutsche Bank was the sole bookrunner for the transaction.

 On the Bombay Stock Exchange, the RCoVL scrip closed at Rs 305 after opening at Rs 318. 

 The Reliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group company came out with the offering to compete more effectively with its peer group at home and abroad. 

 The company has outlined an ambitious investment plan spread over the next few years in various segments of its operations. 

 RCoVL is expected to raise more money through preferential offers to investors other than its promoters in the near future.

 Calcutta, June 17: India will become Nokia?s second largest market by 2010. The company plans to invest over $10 billion in the country, which is the fourth largest market in the world now. By 2010, India is expected to manufacture 10 per cent of the world?s mobile handsets too.

 ?Our Chennai plant, Nokia?s 15th manufacturing unit, was set up in a record 24 weeks. It was commissioned in January this year. We have manufactured 1 million handsets between January and March 2006,? said Devinder Kishore, marketing director of Nokia India Private Limited.

 The company, which has already introduced more than 20 models in the first half of this year, plans to launch as many, if not more, in the second half.

 About a million handsets were manufactured in the country last year, according to the Indian Cellular Association (ICA). This year, however, India should be producing around 15 to 20 million handsets, some of which will be exported. By 2007, the number should rise to 30 million.

 Going by the increasing demand for mobile connectivity, with 4.5 million GSM users added every month in India, ramping up the operational facilities in the country in the coming years seems natural for Nokia.

 ICA expects the handset-manufacturing 

 sector in the country to produce 30 million handsets annually 

 by 2009.

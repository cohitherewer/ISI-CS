 New Delhi, Feb. 10: The government is in favour of bringing in labour reforms, but not the hire-and-fire system.

 Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia today said this at a pre-budget seminar here organised by CPI-controlled trade unions. 

 Ahluwalia said, Rigid labour laws are hindering the domestic jobs market and increasing the cost of manufacturing. We (the UPA government) have categorically said we were not in favour of hire-and-fire of employees. But there should be some flexibility in the labour laws. We need to find a consensus.

 The Plan panel executive head said flexible labour laws, contract farming and speedy infrastructure development were vital for attaining a 10 per cent economic growth. 

 However, CPI leaders Gurudas Dasgupta and A. B. Bardhan both strongly opposed the idea of labour law reforms and introduction of contract farming. 

 Bardhan also blamed the Congress-led alliance leaders of being under the influence of business chambers and not its allies. We have a complaint ? the Prime Minister, deputy chairman of Planning Commission and finance minister are always in the company of CII, Ficci and Assocham, Bardhan said.

 He said, The government reduces tax rates when industry chambers demand so, but it doesnt pay heed to Left parties who have demanded imposition of new taxes and hike in some of the existing taxes. 

 Presenting the CPIs budget wish list, Bardhan said the government should mobilise additional resources by asking public sector units to pay a small portion of their cash reserves, restoring capital gains tax and strengthening securities transaction tax.

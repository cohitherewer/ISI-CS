 Strategic pact with UTI Mutual Fund

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, March 25: UTI Mutual Fund (UTI MF) and State Bank of India (SBI) today entered into a strategic tie-up whereby the countrys largest bank will sell the entire bouquet of UTI MFs schemes through selected branches.

 The tie-up is seen as an attempt by SBI to shore up its fee-based income. The bank also distributes the schemes of SBI Mutual Fund (SBIMF), the countrys sixth largest mutual fund. For UTI Mutual Fund, which is the largest mutual fund in the country, the distribution agreement with SBI would enhance the reach of its schemes. SBI has initially identified 48 centres in India where UTI MF products will be sold.

 U.K. Sinha, chairman amp; managing director of UTI AMC, said, With this tie-up, customers can invest in the various schemes of UTI MF at SBIs branches.

 The tie-up will enable SBI to leverage its unmatched branch network and customer base to cross-sell a range of mutual fund products and thus open a new revenue stream. For UTI Mutual Fund, the tie-up with SBI will enable it to tap SBIs huge network and customer base, chairman A.K. Purwar said.

 Europe sees no virtue in protectionism

 Vienna, April 8 (Reuters): Europe must resist protectionism and find other ways of meeting the challenges of globalisation, finance chiefs from several European Union countries said on Saturday. 

 The comments came at talks in Vienna where EU ministers were due to meet their counterparts from 13 Asian countries including China, whose emergence as a cheap and powerful trading competitor is rocking the industrialised nations. 

 British finance minister Gordon Brown said protectionism and the failure to liberalise markets for supplies of things such as gas and electricity was costing Europe billions of euros and should be shunned. 

 ?It?s surely not the way,? said Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker, who chaired some of the talks during a three-day gathering in Vienna. 

 ?Europe?s response to globalisation can never be protectionism,? Swedish finance minister Par Nuder said. 

 Debate about protectionism in Europe has resurfaced because of government hostility to takeover bids for some key companies and concern over the French government?s decision to pursue what it calls a policy of ?economic patriotism?. 

 European Commissioner Charlie McCreevy, also at the talks, said some governments were not practising what they preached. 

 ?It?s obvious that many member states have a protectionist reflex,? McCreevy, whose job is to try and ensure a properly functioning market for goods and services at EU level, told Austrian daily ?WirtschaftsBlatt?. 

 Controversy over protectionism and hindrance to trade goes well beyond Europe, with the US and European governments increasingly concerned about a flood of cut-price imports from China since the end of a decade-old quota system last year. 

 Moreover, US politicians are increasingly raising national security concerns in a Congress election year as a reason for holding up foreign takeovers ? in two recent cases by companies from Dubai. 

 ?If we saw more protectionism in the US in an election year, that would be harmful to the whole world economy,? said Sweden?s Nuder.

 Adapting to China

 European ministers, due to be joined by the Asians later in the day, were also pushing for China and Asia more generally to let their currency exchange rates appreciate to levels that would make competition in export markets fairer. 

 The Vienna talks began with the 12 euro zone countries on Friday and then expanded to all 25 European Union ministers and central bankers, ahead of sessions on Saturday and Sunday with counterparts from Asia. 

 Global growth is expected to remain healthy at more than 4 per cent this year, with China growing three or more times as fast as Europe, the US and most of the long-industrialised nations. 

 Adapting is proving particularly hard in some of Europe?s big economies such as France, where Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin has sparked strikes and demonstrations by proposing a new labour law to make hiring and firing easier. Big business ramped up the pressure on governments to do more liberalising and less interfering.

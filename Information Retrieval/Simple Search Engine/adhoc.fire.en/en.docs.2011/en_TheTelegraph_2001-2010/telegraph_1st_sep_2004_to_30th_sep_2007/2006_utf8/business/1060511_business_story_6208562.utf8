 Telecom duo told to end row

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 10: The department of telecom has asked two state-owned PSUs, BSNL and MTNL, to resolve their dispute over carriage charges and STD traffic dues as soon as possible, said a senior DoT official.

 On Tuesday, telecom secretary J.S. Sarma convened a meeting of the CMDs of BSNL and MTNL, A.K. Sinha and R.S.P. Sinha, and asked them to sort out the differences either by Friday or latest by Saturday, the official added.

 MTNL, which has received the licence to operate national long distance (NLD) services, is now working out the cost structure of STD services between Delhi and Mumbai and has sought competitive carriage charges from BSNL.

 BSNL has slapped a Rs 900-crore demand on MTNL as outstanding dues towards access deficit charge and for carrying NLD traffic during 2005-06.

 An NLD licence will enable MTNL to offer STD services without having to use the network of either BSNL or any other private operator. 

 Sources said MTNL plans to keep BSNL out of the hugely profitable Delhi-Mumbai circuit where it wants to use its own NLD network to provide services. 

 At present, BSNL charges 65 paise per minute as carriage fee.

 An interconnect committee set up by DoT, which looks into various financial disputes between the PSUs, will also look into the current dispute. 

 BSNL officials said MTNL was free to choose any private operator to carry its long distance traffic, but it should settle BSNLs dues for 2005-06. MTNL was supposed to settle carriage bills on a monthly basis, which it has not done, the official said.

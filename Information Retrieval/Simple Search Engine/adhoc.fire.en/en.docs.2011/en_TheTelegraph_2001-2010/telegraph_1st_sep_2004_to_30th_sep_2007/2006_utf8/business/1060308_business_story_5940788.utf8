The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 AT amp;T rivals poised to counter merger

 DAWN C. CHMIELEWSKI

 Wake-up call

 Los Angeles, March 7: AT amp;Ts plan to acquire BellSouth fuelled speculation Monday that the combined companies much smaller competitors, namely Verizon and Qwest, would be forced to make deals of their own to keep up with a rejuvenated Ma Bell. 

 New York-based Verizon Communications, which in January acquired MCI, might be the first to make a move. One potential takeover target is Alltel Corp., the regional wireless carrier in Little Rock, Ark., with 11 million subscribers. 

 Its rural cellular assets would compliment either Sprint Nextel or Verizon ? quot;all good reasons why Alltel could show up on Verizons radar, quot; wrote Bank of America analyst David W. Barden in research note issued Monday. Investors agreed, sending Alltel shares surging $2.29 Monday, to $66.61. 

 Verizon also might acquire the 45 per cent of Verizon Wireless now owned by Britains Vodafone Group Plc, which would position it to compete better with AT amp;T. By acquiring BellSouth, AT amp;T would have full control of the largest US wireless company, Cingular Wireless. The market may see Verizon as a motivated buyer that could come to Vodafone with a deal it cant refuse, Barden said. 

 Qwest, the Denver-based phone company, once supplied long-distance and data services to BellSouth. AT amp;T expects to save $200 to $300 million next year in BellSouths out-of-region long distance and data costs ? some of which will doubtless come at the expense of Qwest, notes Citigroup analyst Michael Rollins. 

 Qwest probably will look for acquisition targets in long-distance service ? exploring opportunities with telecommunications and cable operators, said analyst Ping Zhao of CreditSights. 

 In a conference call Monday with analysts, AT amp;T chief operating officer Randall Stephenson said he expected about 10,000 people to lose their jobs over the next three years as a result of the acquisition, on top of the 13,000 job cuts that occurred with the integration of SBC with AT amp;T. The deal is expected to close within 12 months. 

 Most observers predict the AT amp;T-BellSouth combination will clear federal regulatory hurdles within 10 months. After all, neither the justice department nor the federal communications commission stood in the way of two earlier telecommunications combinations ? SBCs acquisition of AT amp;T or Verizons purchase of MCI. In those deals, regulators determined that the competitive landscape had changed dramatically since the 1984 breakup of the old AT amp;T and that phone companies now compete with Internet phone services and cable companies for customers.

 FCC chairman Kevin Martin said Monday the agency would review the $67.1-billion deal to determine whether it was in the best interest of consumers.

 Bruce Fein, an antitrust lawyer in Washington, DC, said that quick approval was still likely. This merger is likely to move more quickly through the regulatory review process than the Verizon merger or the AT amp;T-SBC merger, Fein said. The general analysis of markets has been done and the competitive landscape grows more and more intense by the day. 

 Several consumer groups Monday said they would ask federal regulators to reject the deal, saying it would reduce competition and drive up prices. They plan to argue that that acquisition directly would affect consumers across the Southeastern US, where AT amp;T no longer would compete with BellSouth for local or high-speed Internet service. 

 The cable industry similarly expressed qualms about the competitive threat posed by AT amp;T and BellSouth ? which it notes has a market capitalisation greater than the entire cable industry.

 , but is nonetheless seeking reforms to speed its entry into home video. 

 In the last decade, the Bell monopolies have all but wiped out their telephone competitors; they have swallowed their long-distance competitors; and with the announcement of the AT amp;T-BellSouth merger, they are on the verge of re-creating Ma Bell, wrote Kyle McSlarrow, chief executive of the National Cable amp; Telecommunications Association trade group. And only one competitor really stands in their way: the cable industry. quot;

 Asset flight hurts mutuals

 SRIKUMAR BONDYOPADHYAY

 Calcutta, July 10: Falling stock prices and rising interest rates are taking a toll on mutual funds, eroding their assets under management. The total corpus has been depleted by Rs 10,809 crore in June.

 The latest data by the Association of Mutual Funds in India (Amfi) suggest that a rise in interest rates and a consequent churn in debt schemes have eroded the asset base more than redemption in equity schemes.

 According to the Amfi data, there was a net outflow (total redemption minus total sales from the new and existing schemes) of Rs 4,593 crore in June, of which Rs 3,338 crore was contributed by debt schemes ? income, liquid/money market and gilt.

 However, the net outflow of funds due to increased redemption in June contributed only 42.5 per cent of the total depletion. The rest was due to fall in stock prices.

 Investors across all categories also invested less in mutual fund schemes last month than they did in May. While mutual funds could mobilise Rs 1,51,995 crore by selling units of their existing schemes and new plans introduced in May, they were able to garner Rs 1,36,187 crore in June.

 The deceleration in fund flows to mutual funds last month was also evident from the fact that while 12 funds launched in May could mobilise Rs 8,635 crore, 24 new fund offerings (NFOs) in June could collect only Rs 7,421 crore.

 The deceleration was more pronounced in growth-oriented schemes. The sales of growth schemes by mutual funds in April was Rs 5,504 crore. It shot up to Rs 15,538 crore in May and slid to Rs 4,383 crore in June. Equity-linked savings schemes and balanced schemes too shared the same fate.

 Fund outflow (read redemption) from these categories, however, remained almost at the same level over the last three months. Therefore, it is the slowdown in purchase or investment in growth, balanced and equity-linked savings schemes that led to the depletion in assets under these categories.

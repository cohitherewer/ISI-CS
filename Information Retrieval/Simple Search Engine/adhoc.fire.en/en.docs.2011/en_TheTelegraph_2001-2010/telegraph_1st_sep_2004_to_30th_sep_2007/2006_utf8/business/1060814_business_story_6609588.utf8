 LOOSE CHANGE

 ICICI Lombard General Insurance has tied up with Air-India to offer special discounts to students travelling abroad for higher education. Students having a valid ticket of Air-India can buy ICICI Lombard Student Medical Insurance at a special discount. The insurance covers the student from departure to arrival in India by providing facilities such as cashless hospitalisation, and cover against passport loss, baggage loss, personal accident, bail bond, sponsor protection, study interruption and personal liability. The policy is also extendable.

 ICICI Bank and American Express have launched the ICICI Bank Gold American Express Card, which offers a host of international and domestic travel benefits. The card also comes with a comprehensive rewards programme offering five I-miles for every Rs 100 spent on it. The I-miles can be redeemed for vouchers from select airlines like Air Sahara, Indian Airlines, Jet and Singapore Airlines. 

 IRDA has ruled that a customer will have to disclose ones bank account details and income proof if one wants to buy a life insurance policy, especially if the annual premium, including top-ups, is more than Rs 1 lakh. A premium amount of more than Rs 50,000 cannot be paid in cash.

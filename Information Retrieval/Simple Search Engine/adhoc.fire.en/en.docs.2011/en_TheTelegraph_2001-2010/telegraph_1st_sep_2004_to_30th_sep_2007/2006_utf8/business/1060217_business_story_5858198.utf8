 Calcutta, Feb. 16: Ireland is keen to enhance bilateral trade ties with India in sun-rise sectors like information technology, IT-enabled services (ITeS) and biotechnology. It perceives Bengal to play a key role in these areas and also in tea, engineering products and food and beverage industry.

 The bilateral trade between the two countries posted a steady growth over the last few years and it reached Rs 1,725 crore in 2004-05.

 A business delegation of 100 members from Ireland is currently visiting the country.

 Speaking at a seminar on Indo-Ireland trade opportunities at the Bengal National Chamber of Commerce and Industry today, Kieran Dowling, ambassador of Ireland to India, said one of the corner stones of the Irish growth story has been the social partnership and improved industrial relations with India.

 ?We are expecting greater growth, especially with the signing of agreements in biotechnology and one in the field of IT,? Dowling said.

 ?There are many systems which have been put in place on the macro-level, like mutual agreements and wage contracts for harmless relations between workers, industries and the government,? he added.

 Ireland is also keen to extend historical and cultural ties with Bengal, which have been existing traditionally.

 Plans are also afoot to develop, expand business and partnership arrangements in diverse sectors, including industrial engineering, training and consultancy.

 Firms like Biocon and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) are present in Ireland. TCS employs 90 people in Ireland to service multiple clients in that country and the UK.

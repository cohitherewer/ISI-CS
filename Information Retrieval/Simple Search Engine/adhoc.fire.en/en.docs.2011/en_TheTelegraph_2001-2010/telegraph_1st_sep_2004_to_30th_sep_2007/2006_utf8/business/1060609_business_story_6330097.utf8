 Answers elude airport recast

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Take-off time

 New Delhi, June 8: The Centre will consult the ruling Left Front in Bengal and the DMK-led Tamil Nadu governments on the modernisation of Calcutta and Chennai airports. The issue is upgrade either by state-run airport developers or by private firms.

 After a meeting of the Prime Ministers council on infrastructure, civil aviation minister Praful Patel said no decision has been taken on these two airports. 

 The Left wants Calcutta airport to be developed by the Airports Authority of India and officials said this route is the likely option. Chennai, however, may be privatised, but a final decision will be taken only after consulting the DMK. 

 We will find the way forward in the shortest possible time in consultation with the two state governments, may be within the next three months. Besides Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore and Hyderabad, these two airports are major gateways and they have to be upgraded on a priority basis, Patel said.

 A decision to privatise Delhi and Mumbai airports earlier this year sparked nationwide strikes by airport workers who were supported by Left parties.

 The Delhi airport has been taken over by the GMR group-led consortium, which includes German airport operator Fraport and Eraman Malaysia. The contract to revamp Mumbai ? the busiest airport in the country ? was won by a consortium led by GVK Industries Ltd and Airports Company of South Africa.

 An empowered group of ministers headed by defence minister Pranab Mukherjee will soon start consultations with the two state governments. 

 We will broadly go by what the state governments want. After all, in both states our allies are ruling, Patel said. AAI has already started modernisation of the Calcutta international airport, to be done in two phases. 

 The programme, which will cost close to Rs 750 crore, includes completion of a fully automated international cargo terminal, expansion and strengthening of both the runways to be able to take bigger aircraft and a second module to be added to the domestic terminal.

 Nokia prefers to connect directly

 Reaching out

 Mumbai, Feb. 20: Nokia ? the world?s largest mobile phone maker ? is preparing to take a more hands-on approach towards distribution of its products in India. The move threatens to undermine an ?exclusive? distribution arrangement it has with HCL Infosystems. 

 Nokia, which is due to inaugurate its brand-new plant in Chennai on March 11, today signed a new agreement with HCL that appears to take the ?exclusivity? out of the arrangement though executives from both companies denied it.

 HCL Infosystems had virtually built the market for Nokia phones in India and the decision to rework the arrangement triggered a slump in the stock. The HCL scrip opened at Rs 238.70, but plummeted to an intra-day low of Rs 154.85 on the news. However, it recovered from these lows to finish at Rs 180.10, a loss of Rs 77.95 or 30 per cent over Fridays close.

 The sharp dip in its share price was triggered by worries that any change in the arrangement could hurt the companys balancesheet. More than 70 per cent of HCLs revenues on a consolidated basis, come from office automation and telecommunication business that includes the sale of Nokia phones.

 HCL Infosystems scrambled to limit the damage by dashing off an explanation to the markets, investors and analysts. A statement issued by HCL said: quot;Today, Nokia and HCL Infosystems jointly announced a long-term distribution strategy for further developing the rapidly growing Indian mobile phones market. Nokia has extended its distribution agreement with HCL for the next several years. quot;

 The explanation raised more questions than it answered. First, it was silent on whether or not Nokia had dropped the exclusive tag on the 10-year-old arrangement. Second, the statement was vague about just how long the new arrangement was for. Intriguingly, the statement said: ?Nokia has no current concrete plans of appointing a second regional distributor in India at this stage for GSM mobile devices. quot; This raised the possibility that it could do so in the future, if it chose to.

 Sources said Nokia had already started practice runs at it Chennai plant and the new marketing strategy was clearly designed to quot;establish better control over the logistics chain?.

 A spokesperson for Nokia said that HCL Infosystems would continue as their exclusive distributor in India. She said that since the cellular market has shown explosive growth, Nokia will now quot;address the market directly quot; in some places in India but didnt specify which ones.

 ?There is a need for a large distribution network that will meet the projected market growth of 200 million subscribers by 2007. As growth is expected to come from smaller cities, it calls for more developed distribution network. Therefore, in some markets of the country, Nokia will approach the distributors directly,? she added.

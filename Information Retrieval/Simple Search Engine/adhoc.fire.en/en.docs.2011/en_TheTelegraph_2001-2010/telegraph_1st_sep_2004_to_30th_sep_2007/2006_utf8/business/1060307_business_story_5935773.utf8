 Distressed oil firms get a helpline

 Deora: Friend in need

 New Delhi, March 6: Petroleum minister Murli Deora today managed to get some post-budget concessions for oil companies from finance minister P. Chidambaram. 

 Sources said Chidambaram has agreed to allow cash-strapped oil marketing firms to borrow funds from the Oil Industry Development Board (OIDB). Also, government guarantees will be extended to them for loans to import crude oil. 

 The finance minister has reportedly agreed to take a re-look at the services tax imposed on oil drilling and survey services related to the upstream exploration and production sector. 

 According to sources, Deora told Chidambaram that Indian Oil Corporation, Bharat Petroleum Corporation and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation were facing difficulties in obtaining loans from banks for working capital requirements as they had taken recourse to increased borrowings due to under-recoveries from the sale of LPG, kerosene, diesel and petrol.

 He requested the finance minister to permit these companies to borrow from the OIDB as oil firms have contributed towards these funds which were not utilised. The finance minister is reported to have acceded to the request. 

 Similarly, the provision of government guarantees on loans to import crude will allow oil companies to borrow at a lower rate of interest at a time when crude prices have skyrocketed. Chidambaram has also agreed to consider waiving of service tax on drilling and survey activities required for oil exploration. 

 Deora is reported to have told Chidambaram that the country needs foreign technology for striking oil and gas discoveries. Since oil exploration is a high-risk and high-cost business, companies like ONGC and OIL should not be saddled with further taxes in their quest for oil and gas. 

 Chidambaram is reported to have asked the petroleum ministry to submit a list of core and essential services required for oil exploration, so as to consider them for exemption from service tax. 

 He has also agreed to release both the tranches of oil bonds to IOC, BPCL and HPCL before March 15. These companies will get oil bonds of around Rs 10,500 crore at 5.5 per cent coupon rate of interest.

 Calcutta, Feb. 26: A number of global and domestic power companies are keen on implementing the proposed ultra mega power projects in the country.

 Union power minister Sushil Kumar Shinde said China Light and Power Holding, US-based AES and a Korean company were among the 20 firms that visited two of the five sites for which the ministry has floated expressions of interest (EoI). 

 ?Most of the domestic companies are also eager to participate in these five ultra mega projects,? Shinde said here today. He had earlier laid the foundation stone for a 500-mw unit of NTPC at Farakka.

 Each project would have a generation capacity of 4000 mw, entailing a combined investment of Rs 75,000 crore.

 So far, the ministry has sought EoIs for Mundra in Gujarat and Sasan in Madhya Pradesh. 

 NTPC has also thrown its hat into the ring. Its chairman C.P. Jain confirmed that the company would bid for both the projects. While the Mundra project, which would use imported coal, would be located in the coastal region, the Sasan project would be based on domestic coal.

 Union power secretary R.V. Shahi said utmost flexibilities would be provided private and public sector companies to execute the projects. 

 ?There could be joint ventures and consortium among national as well international companies,? Shahi said. 

 Whoever gives the best tariff would be awarded the contract, he added. Shahi said EoIs for the other three projects would be notified within the next fortnight. 

 Dabhol operations

 The second block of the Dabhol power project (740 mw) will be operative from May 1, the power minister said. In absence of gas, the unit would run on naphtha to meet the severe power shortage in Maharashtra. The re-gassification terminal of the project, now named Ratnagiri Gas and Power Pvt Ltd, would be ready by September.

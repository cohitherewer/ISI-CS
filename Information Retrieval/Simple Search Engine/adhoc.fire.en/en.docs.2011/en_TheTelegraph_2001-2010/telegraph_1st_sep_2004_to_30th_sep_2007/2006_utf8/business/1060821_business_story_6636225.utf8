 PSUs get top rating from Dun amp; Bradstreet

 Mumbai, Aug. 20 (PTI): Public sector units (PSUs) have stolen the limelight in the Dun amp; Bradstreet (D amp;B) survey of Indias Top 500 Companies 2006.

 Seven public sector firms enjoy leadership positions among the top companies from 20 sectors identified by D amp;B. The survey was released last week in Mumbai. The seven companies are NTPC Ltd in power-generation, transmission and distribution; ONGC in oil and gas-exploration; the Steel Authority of India in iron and steel; Nalco in non-ferrous metals; Gail (India) Ltd in gas-processing, transmission and marketing; MMTC Ltd in trading and Shipping Corporation of India in shipping and logistics.

 In 1997, when the first edition of D amp;B survey was published, 63 PSUs featured among the top 500 companies and contributed to 47 per cent of the total revenues. In 2006, there are 76 PSUs on the list with their share in total revenues rising to 56 per cent. 

 Even the 26 unlisted PSUs that made the list had total income greater than $9 billion.

 D amp;B also found that Indian companies were on an acquisition spree last year with 236 acquisitions worth $4.3 billion, amounting to almost half of Indias $8-billion FDI inflow.

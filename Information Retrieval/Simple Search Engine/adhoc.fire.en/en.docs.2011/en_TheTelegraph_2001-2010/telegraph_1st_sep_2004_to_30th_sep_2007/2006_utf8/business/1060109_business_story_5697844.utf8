The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Commodity tsar times it right

 Larry Williams in New Delhi

 New Delhi, Jan. 8: Larry Williams, the poster boy of commodities trading, is betting big on the India story and willing to take on a million-dollar challenge to ?stand up and show off a bit?.

 ?The long-term story of India appears to be very bullish. I am willing to start trading in the commodities futures market with a base capital of $1 million,? the 63-year-old Williams told The Telegraph.

 Williams is perhaps best known for his short-term trading seminars where he trades $1 million in real time and then gives 20 per cent of the profit to attendees.

 His was among the first ?big? names in the commodities markets of the West. Many analysts credit the American for popularising trading in commodities in the 1960s as a profitable investment option.

 The current regulatory norms do not permit investment by foreign entities in domestic commodities trading. Williams, however, is hopeful that things would change soon. ?It will surely be opened up for people like me in the next one year, if not in the next six months,? he said.

 The government has already finalised the draft of the Forward Contract (Regulation) Amendment Bill. The draft amendment bill contains proposals for setting up a Forward Markets Appellate Tribunal on the lines of the Security Appellate Tribunal (SAT) formed under the Sebi Act. It will also pave the way for an options market for commodities. At present, option in goods is totally prohibited.

 Commodities futures trading has increased manifold, especially after setting up the three national multi-commodity exchanges. Commodities futures trade value has increased from a meagre Rs 34,495 crore in 2001-02 to Rs 7,80,000 crore by September this year. 

 The government has notified about 100 commodities for futures trading. Trading is being conducted in 81 of these through 24 recognised associations.

 He also wishes to buy a pole for Delhi?s Jantar Mantar ? the medieval structure used for mapping astral positions ? so that it shows correct time.

 New Delhi, Aug. 8: Chinese consumer electronics company TCL is considering setting up a manufacturing facility in India. It also aims to garner a 10 per cent market share by selling one million colour television sets by 2007.

 We are looking at setting up a manufacturing base here (India). The feasibility study is on and we are in talks with some people. It will take at least a year for the plant to be operational, said Richie Liu Hongqi, managing director of TCL India Holdings.

 He said senior officials, who will visit India next month, will probably decide on this issue.

 Hongqi said, From a global perspective, India is a key location not only as a market but also as a manufacturing hub. However, he declined to elaborate on the level of investment in India.

 Initially, our plant will cater to the demands of the Indian market but eventually, it will serve as a hub to service other countries as well, he said.

 Meanwhile, company officials said the parent company is also looking at gradually shifting manufacturing from France and Poland and service the requirements of European countries from India.

 Aiming to be among the top three brands in the next three years, C.M. Singh, vice-president of TCL India, said, Last year, we sold about 3.5 lakh units. This year, we are aiming about 6 lakh units, which will take our market share to about 7 per cent this year.

 According to 2005 figures, the company had cornered a market share of 4 per cent.

 TCL India plans to open 30 exclusive showrooms and 94 service centres across the country.

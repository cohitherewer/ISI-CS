Tata Steel on track in Orissa

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Raring to go

 Calcutta, May 28: Shaking off months of uncertainty, Tata Steel has finally got cracking on its integrated steel project at Kalinganagar in Orissa.

 This will be the companys first greenfield project outside Jamshedpur where it has a 5-million-tonne plant.

 The Tata Steel project is the first among the high-profile projects ? including Posco and Mittal Steel ? announced in the last two years to get off the blocks.

 The company was ready to place orders for construction for the first module of three million tonnes, T. Mukherjee, deputy managing director (steel), said.

 We have decided on the technology and had talks with suppliers. The preparation is in the final stage. We will place the orders in June-July, Mukherjee told The Telegraph.

 The company, in its 99th year, will set up a 6-million-tonne plant in Orissa. The first module of 3 mt will start production in 2009.

 The first phase involves an investment of Rs 6,000 crore. Bulk of the orders for this phase will be placed in the next one to two months.

 Tata Steel will churn out flat products from Orissa. It will put up a blast furnace, a sinter plant and a coke oven plant.

 Besides infrastructure like water and power ? a captive plant will be commissioned ? the company will build railway tracks as well.

 We are creating infrastructure keeping in mind the requirement of the entire project, Mukherjee added.

 The company had signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Orissa government in November 2004 for the project. After the orders are placed, the government will offer the mining lease for iron ore to the company.

 The company was allocated 2,000 acres for the plant at Kalinganagar, which is becoming a hub for the steel industry in the state. The Tata Steel move assumes significance as the state had faced stiff resistance while acquiring the land.

 Twelve tribal people were killed in police firing on January 2 this year when their protest turned violent.

 Mukherjee said the land acquisition was not over yet, but the issue of rehabilitation that sparked off the problem has been settled peacefully.

 Tata Steel and other companies are facing similar challenges in other states where people are being displaced to make way for industry.

 The company has lined up two more greenfield projects in Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh. It is also exploring possibilities in Bangladesh and Iran.

 The company has also acquired Singapore-based NatSteel and Thailands Millennium Steel recently. By putting Kalinganagar on stream, the company is likely to get a headstart over Posco and Mittal Steel in greenfield facilities.

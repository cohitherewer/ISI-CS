 Clean reach

 Calcutta, May 21: City-based Arpita Agro Products, maker of neem-based household cleaner, Nimyle, is set to go national.

 The company plans to reach out to 1 lakh retail outlets in the north and south in three years. It has earmarked Rs 1 crore for annual ad-campaigns.

 Arpita Agro has become a leading maker of neem-based products, grossing over Rs 7 crore annually.

 According to managing director Jaideep Majumdar, a fully automatic plant has been set up to increase production three times by the year-end to cater to the national market.

 The company currently makes about 1 lakh tonnes of the neem-based liquid mixed proportionately with citronella, tulsi and other essential oils.

 Apart from flagship brand Nimyle, which accounts for 80 per cent of the turnover, Arpita Agros home product range include Nimit, a mosquito, fly, ant and insect repellent, and Nimclean, a liquid kitchen utensil cleaner.

 Arpita Agro has also launched Nimgreen, an insect repellent for organic farming.

 The company wants to widen its reach to make people all over the country aware of neem as a natural disinfectant, Majumdar said.

 The company currently sells its products in Bengal, Jharkhand, Bihar and Orissa through 180 distributors.

 Majumdar said marketing the companys products has already been initiated in the south. Around 22 distributors have been appointed to cater to retail trade in Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu.

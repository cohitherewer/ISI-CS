 Analjit in talks with nephews 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 1: Analjit Singh, chairman of Max Healthcare, has resumed talks with his nephews Malvinder and Shivender Singh to settle the legal issues arising from patriarch Bhai Mohan Singhs will.

 Last month, Analjit filed a probate in the court to validate his fathers will.

 I am in talks with my nephews to settle the legal issues which I have inherited as part of my fathers will, Analjit said.

 He had been appointed by Bhai Mohan Singh as his sole legal representative.

 Analjits lawyer said, He would like to settle issues outside the court at any given point.

 Sources close to Malvinder and Shivender, the promoters of Ranbaxy and Fortis Healthcare respectively, said, While the lawyers are preparing to represent their case, we see some hope for an out-of-court settlement since the two parties concerned are in talks.

 The legal tussle between Bhai Mohan Singh and his son Parvinder ? the late father of Malvinder and Shivender ? centred around 24 lakh shares of Ranbaxy, which are claimed to have been owned by the patriarch directly or through different trusts.

 The will had decreed Analjit, if and when the court ruled favourably, to sell the shares and give the proceeds to the Bhai Mohan Singh Foundation.

 I have nothing to gain. All that I am doing is to fulfil my fathers wishes, he said. 

 Analjit, however, said he had nothing to talk with his brother Manjit Singh, who has disputed the will and also claimed his share in the properties and assets held by their parents.

 Anil: Sticking to his word

 Mumbai, March 31: Two Anil Dhirubhai Ambani group companies ? Reliance Energy (REL) and Reliance Capital (RCL) ? are issuing over two crore shares to promoters against outstanding warrants that were issued last year. 

 The conversion, which comes as part of the preferential offer made last year, will consolidate promoters? holdings in both these companies.

 REL informed the stock exchanges that at a meeting of the committee of directors held today, the company has allotted over 1.04 crore shares at a price of Rs 573 each to the promoters against the outstanding warrants issued on August 2 last year. These shares will be subject to a lock-in up to August this year. The shares will be picked up by AAA Project Ventures Pvt Ltd, a promoter group company.

 After the share allotment, the paid-up capital of the company will go up to 21.23 crore shares and the networth will increase to around Rs 6954 crore.

 RCL has allotted close to 1.55 crore shares at a price of Rs 228 apiece to the promoter. Due to this allotment, the paid-up equity share capital of RCL will increase to 22.28 crore and the net worth will rise to Rs 3918 crore.

 A day after the settlement of the seven-month dispute with elder brother Mukesh, Anil Ambani had announced that he would be investing close to Rs 3000 crore in REL and RCL. This was to be done by subscribing to a preferential offer made by both these companies. While the group invested around Rs 2,000 crore through the preferential offer made by RCL, close to Rs 1000 crore was invested through the same mode in the utilities major. 

 The infusion was done to generate long-term resources for these companies apart from strengthening their financial position. 

 In RCL, for the quarter ended December 31, 2005, the promoters held 60.33 per cent of its equity. During this period, close to 38 lakh shares were allotted upon conversion after the preferential offer. 

 The remaining holding is split between institutional investors who hold 22.95 per cent, the Indian public at 13.07 per cent and others, which comprise private corporate bodies and NRIs/OCBs. The promoters hold 50.97 per cent in REL.

 Its not only in REL or RCL that Anil Ambani is showing his personal commitment by infusing funds through a preferential offer. Recently, the group announced similar plans for Reliance Natural Resources Ltd (RNRL).

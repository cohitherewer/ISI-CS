 Srikumar Bondyopadhyay talks about the virtues of prepaying your long-term home loan

 In its June 12, 2005 issue, the Time magazine chose this headline for its cover: Home $weet home Why were going ga ga over real estate.

 There are three main reasons for the unprecedented real estate euphoria, particularly in the residential sector, in the country over the past few years: higher disposable income, lower cost of finances and last, but not the least, income tax benefits. However, the long-term nature of the loan and the available tax benefits make home loans unique. 

Its a long story

 A housing loan is usually taken for a long period, anywhere between 10 and 25 years. This long-term nature of the loan has a significant implication for interest outgo. 

 At the same time, one can take advantage of the tax benefits available on the payments of principal and interest of a home loan and lower the net effect on ones personal finances. 

 So, it is very important to carefully choose the loan tenure and the repayment schedule in order to save on the interest outgo and tax. Prepayment of the outstanding principal is crucial in this scheme of things.

The chosen one

 But before going into the modus operandi, lets see how a bank or a financial institution determines the amount of loan one is eligible for.

 The loan eligibility (home loan) of a borrower depends on his or her repayment capacity. The repayment capacity is considered at 40 per cent of the net income, including income from other sources, in case of salaried persons with net annual income of up to Rs 2 lakh and at 50 per cent of net income for people with net annual income above Rs 2 lakh. 

 For example, if you have a net monthly income of Rs 20,000, you will be eligible for a loan of Rs (20,000 X 0.50/836 =) 11.97 lakh for a repayment period of 25 years (Rs 836 is the EMI per Rs 1 lakh for the loan period at an interest rate of 8 per cent). 

 It should be noted that shorter the loan tenure, higher the EMI (see Table 1) for the same amount of loan. However, banks and financial institutions generally charge a higher interest rate for longer loan tenures. The EMI per Rs 1 lakh for a 25-year loan is much less than the EMI for a 5-year or 10-year loan. 

 This, in other words, means that one can get a higher amount of loan simply by choosing a longer repayment schedule. 

Cuttin the long story short

 If you are worried about the interest you will have to fork out on a 25-year repayment schedule against a 10-year term, just hold on. You can take advantage of the prepayment clause to reduce the interest burden and claim a higher tax benefit at the same time. 

Its easy now

 Banks and housing finance institutions are now offering principal prepayment facility up to 25 per cent of the outstanding balance in a year (after one year the EMI payment starts) without any penalty. 

 Note that while calculating the loan eligibility, banks and housing finance institutions dont take into account the annual increments in the pay packet of the salaried borrower. You can use part or whole of this annual salary increment to prepay the loan principal outstanding at the end of every year and can also claim income tax benefit up to Rs 1 lakh under section 80C on the total amount of outstanding principal (the principal component of EMI plus the prepayment amount) repaid in a year. Additionally, one can claim income tax deduction up to Rs 1,50,000 under section 24 towards interest payment on housing loan during a financial year.

Rest in peace

 When it comes to prepaying a housing loan, one must choose a financier offering EMIs on a daily rest or the monthly rest basis. In a daily rest EMI, the interest component is calculated on the principal outstanding at the end of every day. In a monthly rest option, the calculation is done on a monthly basis. 

 In other words, the principal prepayment is taken into account to calculate interest from the next day in case of daily rest or the next month in case of monthly rest. In the case of an annual rest option, the prepayment takes effect after a year. 

Send your money to work

 Now, if you plan to prepay your home loan too with a part of your salary increment every year, make it work a little more for you by depositing the incremental salary in a recurring deposit every month with your lender bank. You can earn a 6 to 7 per cent interest on a recurring deposit for a year. 

Count your ... blessings

 Usually, the EMI is kept unchanged on prepayment and the term of the loan gets reduced reflecting the reduced principal outstanding. 

 Assume you have availed of a Rs 7-lakh loan for 10 years at an 8 per cent interest on monthly reducing balance with an EMI of Rs 8,500. If you were to leave the loan outstanding for 15 years without prepaying any amount, your total payments towards your loan would be Rs 10,20,000. 

If you now start prepaying Rs 1,000 every month, your 

loan tenure reduces to 8.5 years and the savings you make on the total interest 

outgo works out to Rs 60,500.

 The savings resulting from prepayment is considerable. The earlier you prepay, the more you are likely to save. Even taking into account a 2 per cent penalty on outstanding principal at any given point of time during the loan tenure, the prepayment of loan makes sense because the savings in interest outgo is higher. 

But does it make sense to use the incremental salary 

in prepaying the housing loan rather than putting it in some other investment 

avenues? Prepayment of housing loan wins hands down even when compared with an 

annual return of 10 per cent post-tax from an alternative investment.

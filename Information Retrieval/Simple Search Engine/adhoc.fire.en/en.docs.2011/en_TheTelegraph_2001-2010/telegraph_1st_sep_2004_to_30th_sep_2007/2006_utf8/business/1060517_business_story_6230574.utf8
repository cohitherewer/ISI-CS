The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Amrit set to switch on alternative power plan 

 AMIT CHAKRABORTY

 Calcutta, May 16: City-based realtor Amrit Group has entered into the non-conventional energy business. The company plans to set up a rice-husk-based power plant in Bankura district that is entitled to carbon credit.

 To be located at Bankati village, the unit will be commissioned by the middle of next year. The power will be supplied through normal grid to users in Bankura where there is a shortage of electricity.

 The engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contractor of the project is Cethar Vessels, a Bangalore-based boiler manufacturer, according to the Amrit Group director K.K. Bagchi.

 Promoted by K.C. Dujari, Amrit Group has developed a plot of 3.5 lakh square feet in the fringes of the city, in Howrah and Hooghly districts. It is now developing a 2.5 lakh square feet space.

 The group decided to foray into non-conventional energy after its diversification plan for a ferro-alloy plant in Bankura failed to take off for lack of power.

 Bagchi told The Telegraph that the West Bengal State Electricity Board has offered to distribute the power. While the cost of production is estimated at Rs 2.20 per unit, West Bengal State Electricity Regulatory Commission has fixed a price of Rs 3.35 for selling power to the WBSEB, Bagchi said.

 The company is set to sign a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Ireland-based Eco-Securities for carbon credit under the Kyoto protocol. 

 Bagchi said annual entitlement of carbon emission ratio (CER) to the company should be around 50,000 units at rates varying between $4 and $8 per unit. Bagchi explained that the rates for CER fluctuate on the basis of demand and generation of bio-energy that is monitored by United Nations Framework for Convention on Climate Change.

 A separate company, Amrit Bio-Energy and Industries Ltd, has been formed to implement the Rs 45-crore non-conventional power project. While the promoter will put in Rs 11.31 crore, the balance will be obtained as bank loans. 

 According to a survey conducted by the group, around 1,100 tonne of rice husk is available daily within 60-km radius of the plant. The plant would require about 300 tonnes of rice husk per day and the company will enter into an agreement with rice mills in Bankura and the adjoining district for steady supply of the input. 

 The project will use combustion route for which the minimum economic size is around 6 mw. Apart from rice husk, the boiler would also be capable to use wood waste as input, Bagchi noted. 

 Amrit Group directors will soon meet chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee for fast clearance from the state pollution board.

 Base metal prices harden

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, April 17: Base metal prices in the country are aligning themselves with global trends.

 Aluminium majors Hindalco and National Aluminium Company Limited (Nalco) today announced big price increases and Hindustan Zinc followed suit. 

 Nalco raised prices of aluminium products for sale in the domestic market by Rs 4,000 ($88) per tonne from April 16 to align with firm global prices. The average rate of various grades of aluminium ingots has been raised to around Rs 1,27,000 per tonne. 

 Hindalco also raised the prices of aluminium by Rs 4,000 per tonne from Rs 1,23,300 per tonne earlier for primary aluminium and extrusions. The hike was necessitated with the hike in prices in the London Metal Exchange (LME), the company spokesperson said. 

 Hindustan Zinc Ltd (HZL) raised its price by 2.29 per cent from Rs 1,57,100 per tonne to Rs 1,60,700 per tonne. 

 Meanwhile, domestic steel utility JSW Steel raised the prices of HR steel by up to Rs 3,500 per tonne. This price rise was imperative in view of the rising price of zinc, a crucial alloy needed for manufacturing of steel. 

 On the LME, zinc has risen by 60 per cent since the beginning of the year, with the stockpiles plunging 53 per cent in the past 12 months. 

 Supply chain scarcity and rising labour and capital costs of expansion are putting additional strain on producers ability to respond to strong demand growth. 

 This year marks the fifth year of rising base metal prices spurred by above-trend industrial production growth in Brazil, Russia, India and China. 

 According to metal analysts, the metal manufacturers have increased the prices of their products to be in tandem with the growing demand of metals in the world metal exchanges, especially the London Metal Exchange (LME). 

 With strengthening demand, lower inventory levels, supply scarcity based on mining, labour and environmental issues, the base metal prices are expected to remain firm, said Sunil Ramrakhiani, head, IL amp;FS Investsmart Commodities. 

 Aluminium prices are expected to increase by $400 to 600 from the current levels of $2,571 per tonne over the next six months. 

 Zinc prices are also poised to harden by $300 to 500 from the current price of $3,085 per tonne on the LME.

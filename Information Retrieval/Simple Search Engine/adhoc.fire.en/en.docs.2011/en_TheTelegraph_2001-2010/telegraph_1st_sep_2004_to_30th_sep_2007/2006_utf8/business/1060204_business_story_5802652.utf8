 Mittal finds support in Brussels chamber 

 Brussels, Feb. 3 (INEP): The Europe India Chamber of Commerce (EICC) on Friday voiced concerns about the politicisation of Mittal Steels bid to acquire Arcelor. 

 Allowing politics to interfere into the free market economy is a dangerous trend that will only harm the economy of Europe, warned Sunil Prasad , secretary-general of the Brussels-based EICC. 

 The hostile reaction of the politicians against Mittals bid also shows the economic immaturity of Europeans in the age of merger and acquisition as a part of globalisation process, Prasad said. 

 This further exposes the double standards being practised by the European Union and its policymakers, he said. Prasad is also president of the Global Organization of People of Indian Origin in Belgium. 

 Those opposed to Mittals acquiring Arcelor are talking of possible job losses without giving Mittal an opportunity to speak of his plans and policies to strengthen Arcelor in the global steel map, he noted. 

 Mittal has created thousands of jobs in Europe by buying sick and closed industries, which had lost all hope of rehabilitation. 

 It is very surprising to learn the reaction from politicians from France in particular. When French industrial giant Lafarge took over several cements and other allied industries in India, the Indian government welcomed it as a part of free economy and globalisation, Prasad said. 

 The fact that Arcelor shares jumped to 30 per cent is also an indication of the positive impact of the acquisition. 

 The United Steel workers International has expressed support for Mittal Steel as they see the same benefits that others have received from the acquisition of American steelmakers, Prasad added.

 Meanwhile, Mittal Steel is set to close its only majority-owned steel factory in Luxembourg, sources said.

 The plant, where Mittal owns 75 per cent and Arcelor 25 per cent, is likely to close in 2009 or 2010, said spokesperson Guenter De Backer.

 The factory at Schifflange in southern Luxembourg employs 200 people, who are all expected to be taken on at other Arcelor plants, he said.

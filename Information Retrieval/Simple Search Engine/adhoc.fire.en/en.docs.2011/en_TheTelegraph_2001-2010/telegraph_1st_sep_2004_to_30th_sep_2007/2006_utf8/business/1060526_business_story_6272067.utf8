 Lupin buys Belgian firm

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, May 25: Lupin Limited, the Desh Bandhu Gupta headed pharmaceutical company, will acquire a 51 per cent stake in Belgiums Artifex Finance CVA for an undisclosed amount.

 The company has entered into a memorandum of understanding for acquiring the stake in the Belgian company along with its subsidiaries, including Dafra Pharma Ltd (Dafra).

 Dafra is a dedicated anti-malarial company that provides a complete basket of Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs), which are used to treat malaria. According to Lupin, this includes a paediatric suspension, which is a unique offering. 

 Dafra also holds a patent on a new combination therapy that cures malaria in 24 hours. It has a marketing and distribution network covering over 25 countries in Africa and works with the national malaria boards in various countries.

 Lupin has a significant presence in the anti-TB segment and has been pre-qualified by the World Health Organisation (WHO) for supplies to global drug facility and other multilateral organisations. 

 Lupin plans to leverage its experience and credibility in supply of drugs to WHO-related programmes. Along with Dafra, it plans to develop new therapies for use by WHO and other bodies. 

 Lupin will also use Dafras infrastructure and distribution network in Africa to market its range of products.

 Commenting on the acquisition, Gupta, who is chairman of Lupin, said, This acquisition is a strategic initiative and will leverage the companys TB franchise with the WHO. Lupins R amp;D will be able to add considerable value and move pipeline projects faster to the market. 

 Dafra president F.H. Jansen said, Dafra has long been engaged in the development and marketing of new generation anti-malarial drugs. The high-quality R amp;D capacities of Lupin together with Dafras experience in ACTs will lead to great synergies on R amp;D and manufacturing. The partnership is a massive leap forward in the fight against malaria.

 The WHO earlier this year urged pharmaceutical companies to stop selling Artemisinin, a malaria drug based on an ancient Chinese herbal remedy, as a single-drug treatment. This treatment hastens the development of resistance to the medicine. 

 WHO now recommends the use of ACTs in order to ensure high cure rates of falciparum malaria and reduces the spread of drug resistance. 

 Lupin shares were trading at Rs 1,120, up 3.10 per cent, on the BSE today.

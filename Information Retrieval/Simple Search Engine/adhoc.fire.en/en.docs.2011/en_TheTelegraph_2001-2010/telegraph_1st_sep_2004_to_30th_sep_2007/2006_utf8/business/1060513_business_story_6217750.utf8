 Industry growth slows

 New Delhi, May 12 (PTI): Growth in industrial production has slowed down to 8 per cent during 2005-06 compared with 8.4 per cent in the previous fiscal.

 The slowdown has been due to a steep decline in the growth of the mining sector and moderate fall in the growth of manufacturing and electricity sectors during 2005-06 year-on-year, the official data released today showed.

 Growth in industrial production had also slowed down to 7.7 per cent in March, against 9.8 per cent in the same month of 2005. 

 Mining sector growth fell drastically to 0.7 per cent in 2005-06. Manufacturing sector growth declined marginally to 9 per cent last fiscal against 9.2 per cent in the previous year.

 The electricity sector also witnessed a slight fall in its growth at 5.1 per cent during last fiscal against 5.2 per cent in the previous year. The trend was similar in March as well.

 Call centre database to boost security

 New Delhi, Jan. 18 (Reuters): The information technology and call centre industry today launched a database for its workforce that it hopes will boost data security after reports of theft surfaced last year.

 The sector directly employs a million people, and indirectly about three times that number in jobs ranging widely from transport and security to catering and housekeeping, and vowed last year to better monitor its employees and raise privacy standards.

 The database containing personal and work-related information would enable employers to verify a staff members credentials while police would be able to track the background of workers. 

 The domestic call centres were hit in April 2005 by a $400,000 online credit card fraud after workers enticed bank customers to part with personal details.

 A month later, a British newspaper alleged that a call centre worker illegally sold secret data of British bank customers to an undercover reporter. The firm denied the charges saying it did not have such data or any clients in the UK.

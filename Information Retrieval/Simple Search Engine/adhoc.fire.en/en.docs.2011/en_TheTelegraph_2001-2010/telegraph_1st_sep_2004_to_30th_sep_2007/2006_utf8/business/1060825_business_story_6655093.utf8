 Freight corridor gets wheels

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 24: The cabinet today approved a special purpose vehicle under the ministry of railways to implement the ambitious Delhi-Calcutta and Delhi-Mumbai dedicated freight corridor project at an investment of Rs 22,000 crore.

 Parliamentary affairs minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi said after the cabinet meeting that an empowered committee has been set up to implement the project. The committee will have the cabinet secretary as the chairman. It will resolve the dispute among ministries over the implementation of the project.

 Das Munshi said the Cabinet decision will help in the time bound execution of the project through focused attention to planning, financing, construction and maintenance of the project.

 The freight corridor, which will be parallel to the Delhi-Calcutta and Delhi-Mumbai railway lines, will also encompass Chennai at a later stage. The overall investment in the project is Rs 66,000 crore. The finance ministry wanted the private sector to have a stake in the SPV, but railway minister Lalu Prasad Yadav had put his foot down on the proposal.

 Yadav had said that the private sector could participate through other avenues, though the exact mode of participation has not yet been ascertained.

 The World Bank and the Asian Development Bank will partially fund the project, though the exact funding pattern is unclear in the absence of a business plan.

 Deutsche to foray into consumer banking

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, July 26: Deutsche Bank will enter consumer banking over the next six months. It has also sought the approval of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to set up more branches and a non-banking finance company (NBFC) in the country.

 Following its retail rollout last year, Deutsche Bank today launched a full suite of credit cards. The bank is now present in seven cities through eight branches and around 30,000 retail customers.

 Gunit Chadha, managing director and chief executive officer, India, said Deutsche Bank now has a balancesheet size of over Rs 12,000 crore. He said the bank wants to offer more services to strengthen its foothold. Its current bouquet of offerings include asset and wealth management, equity broking and corporate and investment banking.

 Deutsche Banks foray into consumer banking will include offering personal loans, auto loans and mortgage finance. Consumer finance is expected to be rolled out in the next 6-12 months. This demonstrates Deutsche Banks commitment to India, he said.

 Chadha said the bank has made an application with the central bank to set up an NBFC. Since the RBI is firming up fresh regulations for foreign banks that are setting up NBFCs, Deutsche Bank will decide on the details of its company only after these guidelines are out. 

 After the guidelines are announced, we will decide whether the NBFC will focus on consumer finance or corporate finance, he said. The banks parent had earlier infused a capital of 292 million euros into the Indian operations.

 Colin Grassie, chief executive officer, Deutsche Bank AG, said the banks experience in India so far has been positive and this is the largest and fastest growing country in terms of revenues and number of employees.

 Deutsche Banks feature-rich suite of credit cards comes in the Classic, Gold, Platinum and Corporate categories. 

 A customer can personalise a credit card by choosing from over 40 designs which have been selected across categories as diverse as music, wildlife, zodiac signs, sports and child art. This feature has been introduced for the first time in India.

 Shameek Bhargava, head of cards ? Asia-Pacific of Deutsche Bank, said, Our credit cards have been designed in line with the banks customer-centric approach.

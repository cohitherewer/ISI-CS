 Q amp;A

 Return ticket

 I turned 65 on May 1 this year. I have been filing income tax returns since 1997. From 2000, my annual income became less than the taxable limit. Do I have to file IT returns in 2007-08 assessment year?

 Arun Kumar De, Calcutta

 No, you dont have to file income tax returns in 2007-08. Persons with annual income less than the taxable limit but satisfying the one by six criterion ? owning a house, a telephone connection, a car, credit card, membership to a club, or having travelled abroad ? are required to file income tax returns till 2006-07 assessment year. From 2007-08, the criterion has been withdrawn.

 Counting gains 

 Will senior citizens have to club short-term capital gains on sale of shares or mutual fund in total income?

 P.K. Roy Choudhury, Calcutta

 Yes, short-term capital gains will have to be included in the calculation of gross annual income. However, the tax rate on the capital gains will depend on whether you have paid the securities transaction tax (STT) or not. If STT is paid, the short-term capital gains tax will be 10 per cent. Otherwise, the tax rate will depend on which income tax bracket you are in.

 Fixed on deposits 

 I am 79 years old and will have a gross total income of Rs 2.10 lakh in financial year 2006-07. I want to make two fixed deposits of Rs 25,000 each in a nationalised bank for a period of five years. On maturity will the principal amounts be taxable?

 Hiren Banerjee, Behala

 No. The principal amount will not be taxed. Only the interest amount will be taxable and the tax will be deducted at source under the current provisions. Your total annual income is more than Rs 1,85,000 ? the threshold income limit for senior citizens for income tax. Hence the tax on your interest income from the fixed deposits will be deducted at source. However, you can claim a deduction of Rs 50,000 from your income under section 80C for investing in fixed deposits for five years.

 Mumbai, Jan. 5: UTI Bank Ltd, the leading private sector bank, will raise up to $1 billion through medium-term notes to fund its overseas expansion. As part of the plan, a branch will soon come up in Singapore.

 The bank has, however, ruled out further equity dilutions even as business continues to be on an upswing both in corporate and in retail segments. The branch in Singapore, to be opened in February, will be followed by several others abroad. 

 UTI Bank has applied for licences in many Asian countries, where it aims to capitalise on the intra-Asia trade generating from India, said P.J. Nayak, chairman and managing director.

 Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of a function here today, Nayak said the organic route has been preferred for growth overseas. The Singapore branch will conduct offshore and merchant banking businesses. 

 Since the bank cannot accept retail deposits there, the plan is to support operations through funds raised from medium term notes (MTN), apart from remitting capital from India. Such funds will not lead to asset-liability mismatches.

 We have not put an exact number, but preliminary suggestions say it could be up to $1 billion, he said. The bank is in the process of obtaining ratings from Standard amp; Poors and Moodys for the MTN borrowings, which could be done in tranches.

 Nayak said corporate banking is showing strong growth and retail business is also faring well on account of a structural shift that has helped many customers acquire retail assets.

 SAIL seeks Canada coal stake

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 New Delhi, Oct. 25: The Steel Authority of India Ltd the countrys largest steel corporation has set its sights on two coal mining companies Western Canadian Coal and Excel Coal of Australia. However, Western Canadian appears to be a more viable target for SAIL.

 SAIL, which has been hunting for coal equity abroad for some time now, is keen on picking a stake in these two companies as they produce the hard coking coal that fits its requirements. 

 Unlike Tata Steels takeover of Corus, the state-run steel behemoth is interested in a minority stake of up to 10 per cent in the coal mining companies along with a deal that allows them first right of refusal to 30-40 per cent of the output of the companies. 

 Chairman S.K. Rungta confirmed that SAIL is looking for equity holdings linked to long-term supply contract and added that these two firms are among his targets. 

 SAIL has signed a long-term contract with Western Canadian Coal for supply of 6 lakh tonnes of hard coking coal a year from its Wolverine mine project. The mine has a capacity to produce 3 million tonnes of high-quality coking coal per annum (mtpa), though Western Canadian has the right to produce 2.4 mtpa. Western Canadian also operates the Dillon Mine and Burnt River mines. 

 The Canadian firm has good cash flows. Its first quarter results this year showed sales of $30 million and a net profit of $7.5 million. Though the distance is a hindrance, SAIL feels the quality of coal will compensate for the freight cost. 

 Excel, Australias third largest coal mining firm, was up for sale for some time, evincing interest from SAIL.

 Ultimately, the coal mining company was bought over by the London-based Peabody, the worlds largest private coal miner, for $1.4 billion last month. SAIL still plans to negotiate with Peabody for a stake and a long term contract, said sources. But with Peabody aiming to merge it with its Australian mining operations, the transaction appears to be a difficult proposition. 

 SAIL is also looking at possible joint venture projects in Poland and Russia. However, the Polish deal is getting delayed as the Poland government is yet to firm up its privatisation plans for coal, while the Russian deal is proving to be unteneable because of complicated logistics involved in bringing the coal to port.

 The partnerships were envisaged as three-way joint ventures among Coal India, SAIL and Russian and Polish companies. SAIL has been looking around for equity in foreign coal companies, similar to the strategy adopted by ONGC, ever since its long term supplies from Australia were hit two years back.

 The company has earlier decided not to buy the Tahmoor mine in Australia and the Maruwai mine in Indonesia after a due diligence revealed the absence of significant reserves. 

 A tentative tie-up with BHP for this is likely to peter out, mainly because the second part of the tie-up to give BHP equity in iron ore joint ventures in India is not yet coming through. 

 Coal prices have come down drastically now, but SAIL had suffered two years back when supplies were suspended by two long-term suppliers after prices had shot up way beyond contracted prices.

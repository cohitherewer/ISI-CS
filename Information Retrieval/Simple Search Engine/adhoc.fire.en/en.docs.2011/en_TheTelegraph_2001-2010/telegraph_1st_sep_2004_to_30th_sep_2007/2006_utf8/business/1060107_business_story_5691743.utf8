 Fiscal deficit on target

 New Delhi, Jan. 6 (PTI): Enthused by a robust revenue collection and prudent expenditure management so far this year, the government today expressed confidence that it would be able to meet the fiscal deficit target for this fiscal.

 Higher economic growth and borrowings within the budgeted level this fiscal will also help government keep the fiscal and revenue deficits within the targeted level, official sources said.

 Two-thirds of the plan expenditure has already been incurred during the first nine months of this fiscal, they said, adding that expenditure now is not bunched towards the end of the year to meet the targets.

 Next year, the situation will be even easier as the growth is expected to be higher, the sources said.

 The state governments have also shown improvement in their financial health with the implementation of the Twelfth Finance Commission recommendations, which turned out to be a bonanza for them.

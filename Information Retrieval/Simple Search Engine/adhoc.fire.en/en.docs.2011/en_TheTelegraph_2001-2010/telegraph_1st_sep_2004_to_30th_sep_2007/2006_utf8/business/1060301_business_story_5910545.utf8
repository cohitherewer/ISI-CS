 A feast for food processing

 Mumbai, Feb. 28: It is celebration time for the food processing industry.

 While presenting the Union Budget for 2006-07, finance minister, P. Chidambaram has proposed to fully exempt from excise duty condensed milk, ice cream, preparations of meat, fish and poultry, pectin, pasta and yeast. 

 Recognising the benefits of the food processing industry in agriculture and job creation and its importance to consumers, food processing will be treated as a priority sector for bank credit, Chidambaram said.

 Nabard will create a separate window with a corpus of Rs 1,000 crore for refinancing loans to the sector, especially for agro-processing infrastructure and market development. The government will also set up the National Institute of Food Technology Entrepreneurship and Management. 

 The Paddy Processing Research Centre at Thanjavur will be developed into a national-level institute, he said. 

 Chidambaram said excise duty on ready-to-eat packaged foods and instant food mixes such as dosa and idli mix will be reduced from 16 per cent to 8 per cent.

 He also proposed customs duty reduction on packaging machinery, which serve a wide variety of industries, including food-processing. 

 Rating the budget as neutral, Milind Sarwate, CFO of Marico Industries, said, There are positives, such as reduction in import duty on plastics, which may help reduce packaging costs and lower FBT on travel expenses.

 He, however, pointed out a few negatives such as increased MAT, fresh countervailing duty of 4 per cent on imports, increase in the service tax rate from 10 to 12 per cent. 

 Reducing the excise duty on aerated drinks may not be all that beneficial to us in the processed food industry. A reduction in their cost would put pressure on our products like fruit juices, said M.P. Pusalkar, executive director and president (foods division) of Godrej Industries Ltd. 

 The Budget is also expected to help the domestic vanaspati industry since import duty has been increased from 30 per cent to 80 per cent.

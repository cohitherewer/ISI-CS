 Local demand drives infotech

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 10: Indian IT vendors are focusing more on the domestic market, which is set to grow from $3.5 billion last fiscal to $4.3 billion this year.

 The Nasscom IT User Survey 2005 has shown a rise in IT adoption in organisations at operational and advanced levels.

 Recognising the growing interest, Nasscom has commissioned an in-depth analysis of the domestic IT services market this year.

 The 300 organisations surveyed in four months revealed that for small and medium enterprises (SMEs), the personal computer (PC) to employee ratio ? a key determinant of IT use in organisations ? ranged between 10 and 30 per cent.

 About 67 per cent of the organisations surveyed have more than 90 per cent of their PCs connected to a local area network (LAN). Organisations with less than 25 per cent of their PCs connected are considering upgrading to 100 per cent in the next few years.

 Only 28 per cent of the organisations surveyed have more than 90 per cent PCs connected to the Internet.

 According to the survey, security remains an area of concern. 

 Only a few organisations have adopted advanced security systems solutions, while a large percentage still depend on anti-virus and firewalls.

 The findings show that the industry is keen to invest more with 75 per cent of the respondents having traced the returns on investments made on IT.

 The domestic industry is also outsourcing parts or the entire IT infrastructure to specialised vendors for globally competitive standards and practices.

 Another sign of increasing IT use is the automation of business processes wherein 35 per cent of the surveyed organisations have moved to a level where most of the processes are automated.

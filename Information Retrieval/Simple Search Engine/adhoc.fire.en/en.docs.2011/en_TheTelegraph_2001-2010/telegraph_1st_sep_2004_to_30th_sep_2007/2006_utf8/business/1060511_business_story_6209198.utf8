The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 SEZ roadblocks cleared

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, May 10: The empowered group of ministers (EGoM) has cleared a major hurdle before special economic zones by resolving the thorny issue of the minimum area requirement.

 By and large all issues have been satisfactorily resolved, commerce minister Kamal Nath said after the meeting.

 The group decided that the minimum area for the infotech SEZ would be one lakh square metres of built-up area and the physical area would not be considered. Similarly, bio-tech SEZs would also follow this built-up area criterion. 

 The differences between the commerce and the finance ministry on the minimum area required in key infotech and bio-tech areas were settled with the group going in for the built-up area criterion rather than the total geographical spread of the zone. This is being seen as a victory for the commerce ministry. 

 A senior commerce ministry official told The Telegraph that a proposal had been cleared for setting up 148 SEZs, of which some were less than 25 hectares. However, their notification was held up due to serious differences between the commerce and the finance ministries over the size of these zones. Now the SEZs can be notified. 

 The finance ministry had favoured a minimum size of 25 hectares because a small size would mean revenue leakage. The commerce ministry wanted a minimum size of 10 hectares. 

 Sources said the PMO had intervened and saw more logic in the commerce ministrys case as the objective was to promote exports and generate jobs through the SEZs. 

 As a concession to the finance ministry, the EGoM decided that no unit located in a domestic tariff area would be allowed to shift to an SEZ. The finance ministry dug its heels on the issue as it felt this large-scale conversion of units would lead to a huge loss of revenue. 

 The EGoM has decided that at least 25 per cent of the housing in the SEZs would be reserved for the employees working in the zones. This will put some check on turning these SEZs into real estate projects instead of meeting the main objective of promoting exports. 

 The issues related to the gems and jewellery sector were also resolved and senior officials of the department of revenue and the commerce department will work out the implementation procedure. 

 For science and technology SEZs, Kapil Sibal, the minister concerned, will submit a report on the various proposals that have been drawn up by his ministry and the EGoM will meet again next week to take a final decision on the issue. Issues relating to the food processing industry were also resolved. 

 Some of the minor issues that 

 were settled between the revenue secretary and the commerce 

 secretary over the last two days were also endorsed today.

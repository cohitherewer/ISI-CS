 More time for Basel II

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Oct. 31: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) today gave commercial banks in India more time to comply with Basel II norms. 

 Banks can now wait up to March 31, 2009 to move to this new framework against the earlier deadline of March 31, 2007. 

 In its mid-term review of the annual policy statement for the year 2006-07, the RBI explained that this decision has been taken after appraising the state of preparedness of the banking system. 

 It has been decided to provide banks some more time to put in place appropriate systems so as to ensure full compliance with Basel II, the central bank explained. 

 However, foreign banks operating in India and Indian banks having presence abroad have to migrate to the standardised approach for credit risk and the basic indicator approach for operational risk under Basel II by March 31, 2008. 

 All other scheduled commercial banks have been encouraged to migrate to the new system along with them and not delay it beyond March 2009. 

 The steering committee will continue to interact with banks and the RBI and help in the implementation of Basel II. 

 Under the standardised approach, banks are required to use risk weights which are dependent on credit ratings. These credit ratings are to be assigned by external credit assessment institutions which have been found eligible by the Reserve Bank. 

 Speaking to newspersons after presenting the credit policy, RBI governor Y.V. Reddy said across many countries a set date has been fixed for the implementation of Basel II norms.

 He pointed out that while the US has so far not committed to these regulations, China has also chose the same path. Though the Indian banking system has always aligned with global best practices, a system of phased introduction has been followed here. 

 We even implemented the Basel I in phases and it worked successfully, the RBI governor said. 

 Explaining why foreign banks operating in India and Indians having presence outside the country have to first migrate to this new approach, he said this will provide an opportunity to learn for those who do not have an overseas presence. 

 From an institutional framework point of view, the RBI has done well by giving banks in India an extra year preparation time for compliance with Basel II. 

 While all banks and the regulator have been working towards this objective, any extra time will help banks get a full handle on tough issues like operational risk identification and measurement. They can also fine-tune the rating system for small and medium companies, said Gautam Vir, managing director and CEO, Development Credit Bank (DCB).

 BoB raises term deposit rates

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Jan. 2: In a move which could force other banks to look at their deposit rates, Bank of Baroda (BoB) today raised the interest on domestic rupee term deposits in the maturity bracket of one to less than five years by 25 basis points.

 The bank, which is slated to hit the capital markets soon with a follow-on public offering, has revised the interest rates of term deposits and NRO deposits. BoB told the stock exchanges that for domestic rupee term deposits of less than Rs 1 crore, the revised rate for deposits with maturity of 1 year to less than 2 years will stand at 5.50 per cent from 5.25 per cent.

 Similarly, for deposits of 2 years to less than 3 years, the revised rate stands at 5.75 per cent (5.50 per cent) and deposits of 3 years to less than 5 years will earn a higher interest rate of 6 per cent (5.75 per cent). 

 The bank has left interest rates on other categories unchanged. The revised rates came into effect from Monday. According to the bank, term deposits of senior citizens will attract an additional interest of 1 per cent for all maturity slabs on their fresh as well as renewal term deposits.

 Even as the bank raised interest rates on domestic term deposits and NRO deposits, Union Bank of India, revised upwards the interest rates on its Foreign Currency Non-Resident (FCNR) and Non-Resident External (NRE) term deposits.

 While the rates for one year NRE (rupee) and FCNR (B) deposits of dollar and the euro have been raised, interest rates on majority of longer maturity deposits have been reduced from the existing rates.

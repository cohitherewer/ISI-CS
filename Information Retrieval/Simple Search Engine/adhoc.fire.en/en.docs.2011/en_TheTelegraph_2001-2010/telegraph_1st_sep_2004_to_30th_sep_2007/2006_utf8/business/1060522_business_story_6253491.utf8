 Business confidence on a high

 New Delhi, May 21 (PTI): Non-manufacturing firms are likely to outperform manufacturing units in terms of investments during the next six months starting April, a study has revealed.

 Business confidence index (BCI) among the non-manufacturing firms engaged in provision of services is significantly higher compared with manufacturing firms, according to the business outlook survey conducted by CII. 

 The industry body took opinions from manufacturing and non-manufacturing units, and about 88 per cent of the respondents plan to increase investments during April-September 2006. CII said the BCI has increased 2.1 points at 69.3 during April-September 2006, compared with the corresponding period in the previous year. 

 The GDP for the year 2006-07 is expected to grow at a rate of more than 8 per cent.

 The increased confidence index reflects that larger number of responding firms have appraised current conditions for the growth of the overall economy, it said.

 The first half of 2006-07 is expected to be better in terms of increase in new orders, as 83 per cent of the respondents expected new orders to increase in the next six months.

 Zee arm heads for solo run

 New Delhi, March 26 (PTI): Zee Telefilms is looking at restructuring its businesses, including hiving off its distribution setup into a separate entity.

 It can be a possibility, a senior official said when asked whether the company was considering detaching its cable distribution arm Siti Cable into a separate company.

 The statement assumes significance in the wake of the companys notice to the bourses earlier this week that a board meeting will be held on March 29 to consider, among other things, a corporate restructuring.

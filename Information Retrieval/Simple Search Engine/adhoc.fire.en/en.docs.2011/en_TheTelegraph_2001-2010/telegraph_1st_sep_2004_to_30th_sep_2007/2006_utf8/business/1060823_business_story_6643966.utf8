 Auto parts park near Tata car plant

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 22: The Engineering Export Promotion Council (EEPC) plans to shift the location of the proposed auto component park from Uluberia to Hooghly, close to the Tata Motors plant.

 The EEPC will submit a revised proposal to West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation (WBIDC) next week. The Rs 2,000-crore park is to be set up by the EEPC and WBIDC.

 We needed close to 400 acres, which the government could not allot in Uluberia. Our members also wanted the park to be closer to the new Tata Motors plant in Singur, said Ravi Sehgal, chairman of EEPC (eastern region).

 The park would house around 40 to 45 units.

 Industry feels the park would herald a resurgence of the auto component sector in the state.

 Such parks can help the Automotive Components Manufacturers Association (Acma) enlist more members and open a new office in Calcutta. The association had shifted base to Jamshedpur from Calcutta, said Beni Daga, member of Acma eastern region.

 Acma has only 25 members in the eastern region while there are 234 members in the north.

 The $6.7 billion domestic auto component industry is set to reach $17 billion by 2012 with a CAGR of 15 per cent.

 There has been a shift from the replacement segment, which used to comprise 88 per cent of the market 10 years ago, to original equipment manufacture (OEM), which constitutes 55 per cent at present.

 Exports will reach $5 billion by 2010 from $1 billion in 2003-04.

 The EEPC is considering dividing the park into heavy and light engineering units, Sehgal said.

 The heavy engineering unit would be located in Uluberia while that for plastics, steering wheels and other light engineering components would be set up in Hooghly, if land could be acquired close to the Tata Motors plant in Singur.

 The largest export market for automotive components is the US at 31 per cent and the UK at 30 per cent followed by Asia at 18 per cent and Africa at 11 per cent and West Asia at 8 per cent.

 There are about 237 domestic auto component companies which are Acma members with a turnover between $1 and $5 million, 149 companies with a turnover between $5 and $50 million and 16 companies between $50 and $500 million.

 Acma has also commissioned and completed a study with McKinsey and PwC at a cost of Rs 10 crore on the opportunities and emerging areas of the domestic auto component industry.

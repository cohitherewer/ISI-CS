 Jute tech mission set to take off

 AMIT CHAKRABORTY

 Calcutta, Sept. 2: The Rs 230-crore jute technology mission is set to take off next month.

 The five-year mission, chalked out by the Union textiles ministry, aims to attract Rs 500 crore fresh private investment in the composite jute mill sector to modernise plant and machinery.

 At a meeting on Tuesday, the ministry has cleared four mini missions covering raw jute farming research, transfer of technology, fibre marketing infrastructure, diversified product and machinery development and mill modernisation.

 A kitty of Rs 100 crore has been earmarked for incentives to mills to encourage installation of modern plants. As much as 20 per cent of the incentive amount would be doled out for fresh capital investment by mill owners on new plant and machinery.

 To avail of this incentive, jute mill owners, who have been traditionally shy of investing on modernisation and machine upgradation, would have to cough up Rs 500 crore. 

 The mission includes a Rs 60-crore project to set up jute parks for diversified products in all the areas where the crop is grown. This includes Tripura, Assam, Bengal, Bihar, Orissa and Andhra Pradesh.

 Originally planned as a mission for the Tenth Five-Year Plan period, the project for overall development of the jute sector will extend to the Eleventh Five-Year Plan. 

 The tenure of the mission is for five years from its official launch, which is likely to be mid-September, sources said.

 Broken into various mini missions, Union agriculture ministrys research, education and co-operation wing will take care of research and farm practices and transfer improved technology at the farmers level. As much as Rs 120.41 crore has been earmarked for these purposes.

 The Jute Corporation of India under the textile ministry is to be given Rs 38.60 crore to ensure efficient market linkage of raw jute and establishment of storing facilities both at the farm level and also nearer to the markets.

 The ministry has also set aside about Rs 10 crore to train workmen and supervisors and ensure total quality management (TQM) at various levels.

 NTPC nuclear foray hinges on US deal

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, Nov. 10: The National Thermal Power Corporations (NTPC) foray into nuclear power generation will depend on the outcome of the Indo-US nuclear deal, chairman and managing director T. Sankaralingam said.

 NTPC has decided to increase the eleventh plan capacity addition from 17,333 mw to 21,941 mw, which would make the company a 51,000-mw plus company by 2012. NTPC will also diversify into hydro-electric and nuclear power generation, Sankaralingam added.

 We have been doing the preparatory work to set up nuclear plants, looked at certain sites and consultants have carried out the preliminary studies, he said while announcing the companys performance highlights for 2005-06.

 Sankaralingam said the Centre has set a huge rural electrification target for NTPC, under which 40,000 villages will get power in Bengal, Orissa, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh.

 NTPC Electric Supply Company Limited (NESCL), a subsidiary, will take up power distribution activities and will also be associated with the rural electrification project under the Rajiv Gandhi Vidyutikaran Yojna of the Centre.

 An MoU has been signed with Arunachal Pradesh for commissioning two hydro-electric projects to generate 4,500 mw of electricity, the NTPC chief said. 

 This will include a 4,000-mw hydro project at Etalin and another 500-mw project at Attunli in that state, he said. 

 He said NTPCs Simhadri 1,000-mw station would be expanded to generate another 1,000 mw. Tenders had already been issued for the expansion, he said.

 NTPC was also in the process of finalising a memorandum of understanding with the Sri Lankan government to set up a 500-mw coal-based power plant near Trincomalee.

 The company was also exploring the possibility of a barter deal with Nigeria under which it would set up a power plant and import LNG from that country, he said.

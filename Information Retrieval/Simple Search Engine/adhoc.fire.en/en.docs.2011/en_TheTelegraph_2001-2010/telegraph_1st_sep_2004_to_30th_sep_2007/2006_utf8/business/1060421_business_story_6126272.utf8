 Dunlops Sahagunj to reopen today

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 20: The Sahagunj unit of Dunlop in Hooghly will come back to life tomorrow with the beginning of maintenance work there.

 Unlike the colourful event that marked the re-opening of its Ambattur unit 10 days back in Chennai by chairman Pawan Ruia, this one will be a quiet affair.

 The company management has avoided any celebration here as it fears this could be labelled as a political move to appease the ruling Left just ahead of the second-phase of Assembly polls.

 A group of 50 workers will enter the factory at six in the morning. To begin with, extensive cleaning operations will be undertaken at the sprawling complex, which was shut for the last five years.

 It would take about 4-5 months for tyres to roll out again, Ruia said.

 It will take about 10 days to assess what needs to be done there, he added.

 The Sahagunj factory will roll out tyres for light commercial vehicles, heavy commercial vehicles, off-the-road tyres and industrial products like conveyor belts.

 Before closing down in 2001, the factory had a capacity to produce 90 tonnes a day.

 Dunlop now plans to raise it to 120 tonnes a month within four months of starting production.

 It will produce 40 tonnes a day in the first month, go up to 60 tonnes a day in the second, 90 tonnes a day in the third and 120 tonnes a day in the fourth.

 The management has initially estimated an investment of Rs 125 crore for capacity expansion and maintenance. It will require another Rs 100 crore as working capital.

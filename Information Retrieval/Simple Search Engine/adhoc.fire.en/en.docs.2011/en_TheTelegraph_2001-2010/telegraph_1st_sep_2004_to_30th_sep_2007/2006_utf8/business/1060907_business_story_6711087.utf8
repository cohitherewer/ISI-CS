 Nissan launches Qashqai for Europe

 Paris, Sept. 6 (Reuters): Japans Nissan unveiled the Qashqai small four-by-four car for Europe, aiming to ride a wave of demand for off-road vehicles despite high fuel costs. 

 Based on the platform of the Renault Megane and built in the Nissan factory at Sunderland in Britain, Nissan aims to sell over 100,000 cars a year from February 2007. 

 Nissan said the car, a so-called crossover named after a Nomadic tribe in Iran, will cater for customers who want a more dynamic design but are not attracted to the large, aggressive nature of a compact sports utility vehicle (SUV). 

 Apart from Europe, Qashqai will be exported from the Sunderland factory to Japan where it will be named Dualis west Asia and additional overseas markets. 

 The Qashqai is described as a crossover, as it combines attributes of a classic passenger car with those of a 4x4. 

 The top half of Qashqai has a sleek dynamic form with a distinctive shoulder line, which rises at the rear a design cue similar to that of the Nissan Murano. 

 The lower portion resembles a SUV due to large, pronounced wheel arches and a slightly elevated ground clearance.

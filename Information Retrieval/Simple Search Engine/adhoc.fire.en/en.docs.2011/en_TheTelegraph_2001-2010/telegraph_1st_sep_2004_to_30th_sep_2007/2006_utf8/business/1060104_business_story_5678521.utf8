 HSBC top gun to hang up boots

 CASH OUT

 London, Jan. 3 (Reuters): Global bank HSBC said on Tuesday its chief operating officer, Alan Jebson, would retire at the annual investor meeting in May and that it had hired the chairman of Rolls Royce as a non-executive director.

 HSBC, the worlds third-largest bank, did not announce a replacement for Jebson, a 28-year HSBC veteran, whose departure is the latest change to the banks executive board after it announced in November that chairman John Bond would retire in May and be replaced by current chief executive officer Stephen Green.

 A spokesman said the bank would make an announcement later in the year about how Jebsons responsibilities, which include managing HSBCs global property portfolio and IT systems, would be handled.

 HSBC said Simon Robertson, 64, chairman of Rolls Royce and a former chairman of investment bank Dresdner Kleinwort Benson, had been appointed as a non-executive director.

 HDFC to hike rates again

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, March 21: Home loan seekers are in for another shock. 

 Within one-and-a-half months of raising its home loan rates by 0.5 per cent across the board, HDFC plans another rate hike next week. HDFC had raised home loan rates on February 1.

 HDFC officials said it may raise home loan rates by another 0.5 per cent from April 1. However, details have not yet been finalised.

 The liquidity conditions in the market have not improved, which is the prime reason behind the rate hike, the officials said. 

 The government and the Reserve Bank of India are taking steps to improve the liquidity in the system and once that happens, the rates may come down, they added. 

 The rates have been increased to maintain the margin between its home loan rates and cost of funds, HDFC officials said. 

 At present, HDFC charges a fixed rate between 9.25 per cent and 10.5 per cent on home loans, while its floating rate varies between 8 per cent and 8.75 per cent

 However, ICICI Bank is not considering any rate hike this time. The banks home loan head Rajeev Sabharwal said, At present, we are not looking at increasing our rates. We will take a decision based on the broad interest rate movements in the market.

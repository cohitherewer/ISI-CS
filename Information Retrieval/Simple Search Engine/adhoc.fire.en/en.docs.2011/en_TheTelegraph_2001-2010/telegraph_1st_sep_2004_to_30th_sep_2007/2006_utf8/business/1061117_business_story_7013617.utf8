 Tata firm in drug pact with Merck

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Nov. 16: Advinus Therapeutics, a Tata group firm, has entered into a drug discovery and clinical development collaboration with Merck amp; Co. Advinus will conduct research and pre-clinical trials in metabolic disorders for Merck.

 Advinus will receive $150 million for two targets ($74.5 million each) that will initially be covered by the collaboration. Advinus is also eligible for royalties on sales of any products that result from the collaboration. 

 Though the collaboration will begin with two target programmes, it could expand to include others over a period of time. The partners have already identified 10 targets, of which work will begin on two. This is Mercks first research-based collaboration in India.

 Rashmi Barbhaiya, CEO and managing director of Advinus, said, This agreement reflects Indias emerging role in bringing innovative and life-saving drugs to the market with speed and cost-effectiveness.

 The Merck-Advinus deal is similar to the pact that was forged between Ranbaxy Laboratories and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) in 2003. That deal covers discovery and development of new drugs in urology, anti-diabetic, anti-bacterial, asthma and anti-fungal segments. 

 Ranbaxy was responsible for optimisation of a lead discovery and generation of a candidate that could be developed into a drug. Barbhaiya was president (research and development) of Ranbaxy when the deal was inked.

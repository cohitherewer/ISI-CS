 New Delhi, June 11: Buying a car might just leave a bigger hole in your pocket. The uptrend in raw material costs and the recent hike in fuel prices have hit carmakers.

 Leading manufacturers are hinting at increasing prices by 2-3 per cent. This could mean Rs 4,500-15,000 hike in small car prices. 

 At the moment we are evaluating the impact of the fuel hike and have not taken any decision. Manufacturers cannot completely absorb the hike, so it would be passed on to consumers, said P. Balendran, vice-president, General Motors India

 In keeping with the oil price rally, cost of raw materials used in making a car is expected to go up. Prices of many commodities, including aluminium and other composite materials, are set to go up.

 Balendran said usually an above normal fuel price hike, which is the case this time, pushes car prices by 2-3 per cent because the transportation and input costs also go up.

 Battery carmaker is likely to raise the prices in the near future. Prices of aluminium and plastics have gone up by a huge margin, said the companys deputy chairman and chief technical officer Chetan Maini. 

 We are contemplating a hike in prices as we have been absorbing the input costs increase for a while now. We would be taking a call on the rising car price soon., Maini said. 

 Industry sources said, the countrys largest carmaker, Maruti Udyog Ltd, could also pass some of the burden to customers. 

 Maruti officials, said, A decision would be taken in a few days. At the moment, we cant say by what per cent it would increase.

 The government recently raised the prices of petrol by Rs 4 and diesel by Rs 2. 

 Sources said leading carmakers are assessing the overall impact. The rise in fuel costs, coupled with higher raw material prices, will eventually jack up car prices.

 The growth in car sales in May has been higher than the demand for motorcycles. While car manufacturers sold 30 per cent more, the growth in bike sales was 24.6 per cent during the month. 

 According to the figures released by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers, 88,814 cars were sold in May against 68,519 in the same month last year, recording a growth of 29.6 per cent.

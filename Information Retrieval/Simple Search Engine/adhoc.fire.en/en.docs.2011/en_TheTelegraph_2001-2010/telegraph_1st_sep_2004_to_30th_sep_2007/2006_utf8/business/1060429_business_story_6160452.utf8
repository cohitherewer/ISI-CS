 Banks to face RBI music

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 The heat is on

 Mumbai, April 28: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) may levy a harsher punishment on erring banks implicated in the IPO scam if they are found to have violated its guidelines other than the know your customer norms (KYC) for which monetary penalties have already been imposed on some of them.

 Halting a banks branch expansion plans is one such option before the RBI. On Thursday, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) referred to the RBI the names of some banks who were found to have provided IPO finance to fictitious or benami applicants. The market regulator had come out with an interim report on its investigations and stunned the bourses by barring 24 entities from participating in the equity markets.

 While officials from the RBI did not comment on what would be the central banks next step, sources in the banking industry said the RBI would first try to see if new banks have been involved in the whole affair.

 The RBI will see if new banks are there. It will then investigate their role and on what parameters have they failed. If they are found to have violated the KYC norms, monetary penalties will be levied, the source added.

 In January, the RBI had imposed monetary penalties ranging from Rs 5 lakh to Rs 20 lakh on Indian Overseas Bank (IOB), HDFC Bank, Vijaya Bank, Citibank, ICICI Bank, Bharat Overseas Bank and Standard Chartered Bank for violating KYC norms. Later in February, monetary penalties ranging from Rs 5 lakh to Rs 25 lakh were levied on HDFC Bank, ING Vysya Bank and IDBI Ltd.

 Experts feel that if the banks on whom monetary penalties have already been levied are again found to have failed in fulfilling KYC norms, they will not be punished again by the RBI. However, if they are found to be guilty on other counts, administrative action could be taken.

 After the Harshad Mehta scam came to light and some banks were found guilty, the RBI increased their cash reserve ratio requirements and put on hold their branch expansion plans. While it cannot raise the CRR now, it certainly can curtail a banks expansion plans, the expert added.

 Sebi yesterday directed HDFC Bank, IDBI Bank, ING Vysya Bank and Centurion Bank of Punjab Ltd to not open fresh demat accounts.

 Banking circles say that it will take at least a month for the RBI to finish the process of identifying carelessness on part of the banks, establishing it and giving them a personal hearing.

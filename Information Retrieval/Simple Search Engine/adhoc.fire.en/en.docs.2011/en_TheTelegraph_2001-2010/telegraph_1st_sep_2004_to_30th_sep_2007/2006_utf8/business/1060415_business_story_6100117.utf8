 Car sales in Europe up 4.1%

 Frankfurt, April 14 (Reuters): Another solid sales month by Fiat and Volkswagen helped new car registrations in Europe rise 4.1 per cent in March to nearly 1.79 million vehicles, industry data showed on Friday.

 Calendar quirks of the Easter holiday ? which fell in March last year and comes in April this year ? also flattered the data for registrations, which closely mirror sales.

 Many markets had two extra selling days versus a year earlier and Denmark had three.

 The positive result, partly due to an extra working day in all countries...confirms the good start of the year, Brussels-based European car industry group ACEA said.

 Italys Fiat led gains, thanks to new models and robust growth in its domestic market amid good consumer sentiment. New registrations for the group rose nearly a fifth year-on-year on the back of a 28.3 per cent increase at its core Fiat brand.

 Germanys Volkswagen group also kept up momentum from a freshened product line-up. It generated a 9.6 per cent rise in new car registrations, paced by double-digit percentage growth at the key Volkswagen brand and by Czech brand Skoda.

 Despite volume growth, carmakers still face intense pressure on margins from a price war that shows no signs of abating. Even the premium segment is feeling the margin squeeze amid chronic overcapacity in the sector.

 Renault continued to slump, down 4.8 per cent. Surging sales of its low-cost Logan could not offset a 6.8 per cent decline in Renault brand sales.

 Registrations of DaimlerChryslers premium brand Mercedes-Benz advanced 14.4 per cent and Chrysler sales rose by more than a quarter, but registrations of the Smart brand of small cars fell by 23.6 per cent.

 Asian carmakers, whose reputation for quality and affordable prices have helped them penetrate the European market, had a mixed month.

 Suzuki Motor Corps figures jumped by 19.2 per cent, extending its strong showing this year and boosting its market share in March to 1.6 per cent. Mazda Motor Corps numbers also went up nearly 16 per cent last month.

 South Koreas Kia Motors grew less quickly than the market and remained well short of growth rates in 2005 when it was the fastest-growing brand in Europe. Its registrations edged up 0.5 per cent in March. Toyota brand sales gained 4.9 per cent while its Lexus premium brand shot up 85.2 per cent to 5,135 cars.

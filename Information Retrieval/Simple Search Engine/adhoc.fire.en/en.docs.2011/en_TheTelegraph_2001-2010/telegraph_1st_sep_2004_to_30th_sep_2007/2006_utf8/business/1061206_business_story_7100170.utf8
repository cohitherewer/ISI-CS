 Govt tab on gas prices

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Deora: In control

 New Delhi, Dec. 5: Natural gas producers like Reliance Industries and Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation will have to get the governments approval for the formula they will use to calculate the price of the gas price, petroleum minister Murli Deora said in Parliament today.

 The formula, on the basis of which gas pricing is done, ... shall be approved by the government, Deora told the Rajya Sabha. 

 Deora said a committee, headed by a joint secretary in the petroleum ministry, has recommended drawing up transparent guidelines for approving natural gas pricing to calculate government revenue from gas fields. The government revenue comprises profit petroleum, which is the percentage of oil or gas produced from a field that the government is entitled to as the owner. Besides, the government also gets a fixed royalty from the field.

 The committee was constituted after the ministry rejected Mukesh Ambani-controlled Reliance Industriess proposal to sell gas from its eastern offshore KG basin field to Anil Ambanis proposed power plant near Delhi. The petroleum ministry found the price of $2.34 per million British thermal unit (mBtu) was not arrived at on an arms-length basis.

 The committee was a departmental one and was entrusted with the valuation of government take under the production sharing contracts. It did not include members of other ministries, he said while replying to supplemetaries.

 However, the committee had sought the views of various stakeholders across industries.

 Dinsha Patel, minister of state for petroleum and natural gas, said in a written reply to another question that the valuation of gas would be done based on most recent competitively determined price in the region duly indexed to the present.

 Patel said long-term contracts have a clause for periodic gas price reviews.

 If price is reviewed according to the contract, it may become the new reference price. For the interim period, it may be linked to a percentage increase in the price of furnace oil, which is not only the cheapest liquid fuel but has also shown the least price volatility in recent years.

 If the actual price at which any producer supplies to a consumer happens to be higher than the one arrived at by the above methodology, the higher price shall be reckoned for the government take, he said.

 The director-general of the directorate general of hydrocarbons (DGH) and director of the Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell would jointly calculate and determine the valuation based on the committees recommended methodology.

 DGH shall also be responsible to ensure that the gas producer remits the governments take (profit petroleum and royalty) accordingly, he said.

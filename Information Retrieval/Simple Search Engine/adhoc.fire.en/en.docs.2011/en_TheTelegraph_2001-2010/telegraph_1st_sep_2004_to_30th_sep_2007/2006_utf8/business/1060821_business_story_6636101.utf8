 North Block plugs TDS leak

 Calcutta, Aug. 20: Businesses with an annual turnover of Rs 40 lakh and professionals with an annual receipt of Rs 10 lakh will now have their taxes, including fringe benefit tax and tax deducted at source, certified by chartered accountants. 

 In a notification last week, the finance ministry has amended the tax audit format (Form 3CD) for these assesses. 

 In the new format, auditors would not only certify the value of fringe benefits, they would also disclose instances where tax is deductible but not deducted at all; the shortfall due to lower deduction; tax deducted late and those deducted, but not paid to the government.

 Auditors will now file their report in a new Form 3CD, to be annexed with the return of the company. 

 Self-certification on fringe benefits, will, however prevail for businesses with less than Rs 40 lakh turnover and professionals earning less than Rs 10 lakh.

 The norm for accountants till now is to reveal the cases where tax was deducted but remitted to the government beyond the due date.

 It is an onerous responsibility on the practising chartered accountants in the area of tax deducted at source (TDS), said T.N. Manoharan, president of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. The Central Board of Direct Taxes has revised the Form 3CD with advice from the ICAI. 

 While the government has accepted most of our suggestions on changes in Form 3CD regarding the valuations of fringe benefit taxes, it has increased the responsibility of auditors to even certify whether thousands of transactions carried out by the assessee company are TDS deductible and whether the TDS has been deducted at all or not, whether there is any short fall on account of lesser deduction, whether the tax was deducted late and whether it was deducted but not paid to the government, Manoharan said. 

 He added that this was an onerous job as the auditor will have to check every transaction of the assessee and get the TDS receipts. The TDS task, along with the valuation of fringe benefits, will definitely increase the workload of tax auditors. But, whether auditors will increase their fees depends on the agreement between the individual assessee and the chartered accountant(s) concerned, Manoharan said. Auditors will also have to certify transactions that convert capital assets into stock in trade.

 Calcutta, Nov. 8: Bharat Hotels is in talks with private equity funds to raise money to finance its Rs 1,000-crore expansion plans in the next three years.

 The company is also open to the option of listing on local bourses. Jyotsna Suri, chairperson of the group, said a decision could be taken in three to four weeks.

 The company had filed a draft red herring prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Board India (Sebi) for an initial public offer (IPO) in May but the stock market crash forced it to defer the plan.

 Arvind Sachdev, senior vice-president (finance) of the company, said Bharat Hotels would raise around Rs 400-450 crore.

 The promoters, the Suri family, hold about a 74 per cent stake, while the rest is with different corporate bodies and individuals.

 Following the dilution of equity, promoters stake will go down to 60 per cent.

 Bharat Hotels runs seven properties in the country under the Grand banner. It has acquired the Great Eastern Hotel in Calcutta and is building four hotels in Ahmedabad, Chandigarh, Jaipur, and Bekal (Kerala backwaters). The group is looking at two more hotels in India.

 Sachdev said the company was in talks to build a 700-room hotel in Dubai.

 Lalit Suri, the founder of the group, had initiated the talks for this 50:50 venture but his untimely death last month had put a break to the talks. 

 Sachdev said discussions have resumed for the first overseas venture by the group.

 The expense for the Dubai project will be over and above the Rs 1,000 crore being lined up. 

 Bharat Hotels has tied up debt worth Rs 350 crore, while Rs 200-250 crore will be raised through internal generation. 

 Once the local expansion, with 14 hotels spread across the country is ready, the group plans to introduce budget hotels chains as well.

 Bharat Hotels was delisted the bourses three years back. 

 Meanwhile, Suri said the company would spend Rs 120 crore for the Great Eastern hotel. She will meet chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to apprise him of the plan.

 One of the issues that may crop up is removal of tenants from the hotel arcade. Negotiations are on for a year now without much success.

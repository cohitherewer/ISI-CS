 Panel to vet Paradip plan

 SUBRAT DAS

 Bhubaneswar, July 14: The Centre and Orissa will jointly set up a high-level task force to explore the possibility of establishing a petrochemicals and petroleum refinery investment region at Paradip with Indian Oil Corporation as the anchor tenant.

 Chief minister Naveen Patnaik mooted the proposal to petroleum minister Murli Deora at a meeting on Thursday. 

 Patnaik has suggested that IOC should act as the anchor tenant for promoting the investment region at Paradip. Both have agreed to constitute a joint task force for this purpose, official sources said.

 The CM has also urged the Union minister to expedite the execution of the proposed 15 MMTPA oil refinery-cum-petrochemicals complex to be set up by IOC in Paradip at an estimated cost of Rs 25,000 crore.

 The IOC project, originally a 9 MMTPA fuel refinery at an estimated cost of Rs 7,500 crore, has been scaled up to a 15 MMTPA export-oriented grassroots refinery along with a petrochemical plant.

 Former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had laid the foundation stone for the 9 MMTPA oil refinery in June, 2000. However, the project continued to hang fire for four years over tax concessions.

 Finally, the Orissa government conceded to IOCs demands and on February 16, 2004 granted a package of incentives, including deferment of sales tax for product sales, waiver of central sales tax and sales tax on purchase of materials, machinery and equipment for commercial production.

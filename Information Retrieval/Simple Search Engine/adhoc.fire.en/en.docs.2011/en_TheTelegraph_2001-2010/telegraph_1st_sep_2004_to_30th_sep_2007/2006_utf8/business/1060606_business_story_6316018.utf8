 Motorola to set up base for handsets

 Buzz gets louder

 Mumbai, June 5: Motorola of the US plans to establish a plant in India to make mobile handsets following the lead of its Finnish rival Nokia.

 We will come out with an official announcement very soon. At this point it will be very premature to say anything, Lloyd Mathias, director (marketing-India, mobile devices) told The Telegraph. 

 He refused to give any details about the size of the plant or its location. 

 I cannot comment on the location of the facility, but it obviously will be at a place where the volumes are high, Mathias said. Our focus at the moment is to revamp our India operations and increase our market share. 

 Nokia recently invested close to $150 million in its Chennai?based manufacturing facility which is supposed to support the growing demand for mobile handsets in the Asia-Pacific region. 

 The Nokia facility has already manufactured close to one million handsets in India since it started its operations in January 2006. 

 Currently Motorola, one of the pioneering companies in mobile phone manufacturing is lagging behind Nokia in terms of market share. 

 To increase its reach, the company has inked a pact up with Bharti Teletech, the manufacturer of the Beetel phones, for a distribution tie-up. As a result of the tie-up inked in 2005, the company has got access to Bharti Teletechs 250 distributors and 11,000 retailers.

 For its rural push, Motorola has also tied up with the DCM group to supply cheaper handsets for its rural initiative Haryali and ITC for its e-choupal project. Our distribution is up four times and brand awareness is up 16 times, he said refusing to give away actual numbers.

 A manufacturing facility also becomes an important driver for the company since India is now the headquarters of its high growth markets which comprise four zones: India, South East Asia, Africa and the Far East. 

 According to industry reports, India has emerged as the second largest mobile handset market and is poised for explosive growth by 2007.

 Industry observers say that India could well become a global hub for mobile handset manufacturers in the first quarter of 2006. The Indian mobile subscriber base is expected to touch 100 million by 2007.

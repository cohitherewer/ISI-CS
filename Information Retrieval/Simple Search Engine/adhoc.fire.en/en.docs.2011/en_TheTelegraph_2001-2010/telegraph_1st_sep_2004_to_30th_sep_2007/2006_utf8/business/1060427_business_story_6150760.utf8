 Boeing sells more, beats forecast

 Flying high

 New York, April 26 (Reuters): Boeing Co said on Wednesday that first-quarter profit rose a greater-than-expected 29 per cent, as the No. 1 US aerospace company recorded higher sales of its commercial planes.

 Its shares dipped 1.3 per cent in pre-market trading after hitting an all-time high earlier this week.

 Boeing, which dominates the surging world market for jetliners with Europes Airbus, reported quarterly profit increased to $692 million, or 88 cents per share, from $535 million, or 66 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter.

 Excluding a one-time gain from a tax settlement, Boeing posted a profit of 85 cents per share, topping Wall Streets estimate of 76 cents per share.

 Revenue rose 12 per cent to $14.3 billion, below analysts forecast of $14.6 billion.

 Boeing, along with Airbus, is benefiting from a boom in commercial jet orders with a resurgence of the travel sector. Last year, Boeing received a record 1,002 commercial plane orders and got another 176 orders during the first quarter.

 Sales in Boeings commercial jet unit increased 48 per cent to $7.1 billion in the first quarter, as it delivered 98 planes, up from 70 planes in the year-ago period.

 Its defence unit, second only to Lockheed Martin Corp in leading big programmes for the Pentagon, did not fare as well. Sales fell 6 per cent to $7.2 billion overall due to a drop in work on satellites and the sale of its Rocketdyne business, which makes rocket propulsion systems.

 Looking forward, Boeing reaffirmed its full-year 2006 profit forecast of $3.25 to $3.45 per share, and its 2007 profit forecast of $4.10 to $4.30 per share. It is forecasting revenue of $60 billion for 2006, and $63.5 billion to $64.5 billion for 2007.

 Boeing shares traded down $1.11 at $84 on the Inet electronic brokerage system from a close at $85.11 on Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares hit an all-time high of $87.24 on Monday.

 Its shares are up about 27 per cent in the past three months, on top of a 36 per cent gain last year, making the stock the second best performer in the Standard amp; Poors Aerospace and Defense index, which is up 18 per cent in the past three months.

 Boeing shares are trading at about 20 times forecasted earnings for 2007, making it the most expensive in the S amp;P Aero index, which is trading at about 16 times forecast 2007 earnings.

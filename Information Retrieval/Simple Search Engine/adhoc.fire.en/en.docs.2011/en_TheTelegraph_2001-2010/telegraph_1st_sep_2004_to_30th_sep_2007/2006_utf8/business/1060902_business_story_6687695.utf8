 Microsoft Xbox 360 by month-end

 New Delhi, Sept. 1 (Reuters): Microsoft Corporation will start selling its popular Xbox 360 gaming console in India by the end of September, a company official said on Thursday.

 Microsoft hopes the ongoing economic boom that has boosted incomes and spurred spending will contribute to higher sales of the entertainment device.

 The Xbox 360 will be available from September 23, Mohit Anand, country manager for Microsoft Indias entertainment amp; devices division, told reporters.

 The US software firms product will hit the market before Diwali, when many companies pay annual bonuses to workers. The festival is on October 21 this year. 

 Microsoft will offer the Xbox 360 console, its controller along with a game for Rs 19,990. 

 Traditionally, buying activity in Asias fourth-largest economy peaks during the last three months of the calendar year due to a string of festivals, including Christmas.

 Anand declined to comment on sales numbers but said contribution from India was already factored into holiday season sales.

 Microsoft will offer the Xbox 360 console, its controller along with a game for Rs 19,990. In the United States, it sells the Xbox 360 and a controller at between $299 and $399, while a game costs another $50-60.

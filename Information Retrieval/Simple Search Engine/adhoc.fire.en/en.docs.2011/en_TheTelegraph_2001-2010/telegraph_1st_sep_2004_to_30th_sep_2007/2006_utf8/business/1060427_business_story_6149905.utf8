 Tata Metaliks in race for Kulti

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Calcutta, April 26: Tata Metaliks (TML) has bid for Kulti Works of Indian Iron and Steel Company (IISCO). The Works has been put on the block by the Steel Authority of India.

 Today was the last day for submitting expressions of interest (EoI).

 Sources said four companies have put in their bids. All of them are from the iron and steel industry. 

 Besides players from the east, a company from the western region is also believed to have submitted an EoI.

 TMLs bid comes at a time when the companys growth plans in Kharagpur have come to a halt because of a delay in land acquisition. The Works comes with an area of 238 acres. It might provide the company an opportunity to move out of Kharagpur for steel and casting expansion.

 TML managing director Harsh K. Jha, however, refused to comment on the bid.

 If successful, this will be TMLs second acquisition. It recently bought a pig iron plant in Maharashtra.

 The largest pig iron manufacturer in the country is now planning to foray into steel making and casting.

 After the EoIs, preliminary data will be circulated among interested parties. They will then carry out due diligence following which, final bids will be called. SAIL aims to conclude the deal by the second quarter of this fiscal.

 The successful bidder will get the Works, a light casting mill, a DVC power sub-station and a water pumping station.

 There is a colony of 2,300 residential units, a golf course and a club outside the Works. It is, however, not mandatory for the buyer to take up the township as well.

 The Works, set up in 1870 as Bengal Iron Works Company, became part of Indian Iron amp; Steel Co in 1936.

 Both the units of IISCO ? Burnpur and Kulti located in Burdwan district ? are now with SAIL following the merger of the two earlier this year.

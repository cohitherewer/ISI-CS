 New Delhi, Feb 11: General Motors today launched the Aveo, its mid-size sedan in the Indian market. The Aveo will compete with the City of Honda, the Fiesta of Ford and the Accent from the Hyundai stable. 

 GM will also be launching the Aveo-UVA, its premium hatchback, by June to take on Marutis Swift. 

 Though the Aveo was launched by GM vice-president Jim Queen in Bangalore today, the car will be available to customers only after the Union budget is presented as General Motors is awaiting the new tax structure before announcing the price of the car.

 We want to see what the government does for the automobile industry in the forthcoming budget. Accordingly, we will set the prices, a company executive said. 

 The sedan will be available in two engine capacities ? 1.4 and 1.6 litre petrol variants. 

 Sources say, the Aveo is expected to be priced at around Rs 5.5 lakh.

 The Aveo is the first of the three new Chevrolet products that are likely to hit the Indian road in the first six months of this year. It will be joined by Aveo-UVA and Optra SRV.

 The new sedan will be built at GMs manufacturing facility at Halol in Gujarat.

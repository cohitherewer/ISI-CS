 Tata-Fiat pact picks up pace

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Grand plans

 Mumbai, Nov. 10: If Renault and M amp;M are shifting into high gear to expand their motoring alliance, the Tatas and Fiat of Italy are roaring down the same autobahn.

 Tata Motors and Fiat are planning to use the Italian companys production facility in Cordoba, Argentina, to manufacture 1 tonne pick-ups that will be sold in various Latin American and overseas markets under both Tata and Fiat brands. 

 In India, the joint venture will produce small diesel engines and transmissions apart from Fiats Grande Punto and the Linea.

 Early this week, Alfredo Altavilla, Fiat Autos business development manager, mapped out to analysts the contours of the new grand alliance. In a presentation, he said the joint venture would make cars and power trains (basically engine and transmission systems) at Fiats plant at Ranjangaon in Maharashtra.

 The cars will be meant for both Indian and overseas markets. Over 2.50 lakh small diesel engines and matching transmissions will also be made annually. The expected overall yearly output of the Grande Punto, the Linea and Tata models is put at over 1.30 lakh units. 

 The Linea, a sedan, is scheduled for a worldwide launch in the first half of next year.

 According to Fiat, the sharing of dealer network and assistance/spare parts sale would rise over the next three years. It will go up to 200 by 2009 from 45 points of sales now.

 In March this year, Fiat and Tata Motors entered into an arrangement for joint collaboration. 

 At the annual general meeting of Tata Motors held in July, chairman Ratan Tata indicated some of the crucial elements of the arrangement. He told shareholders that both companies were looking at the possibility of joint manufacturing at Fiats plant in Ranjangaon near Pune. The duo was also exploring the possibility of exchanging products wherein a Tata Motor vehicle will be badged as a Fiat and vice versa.

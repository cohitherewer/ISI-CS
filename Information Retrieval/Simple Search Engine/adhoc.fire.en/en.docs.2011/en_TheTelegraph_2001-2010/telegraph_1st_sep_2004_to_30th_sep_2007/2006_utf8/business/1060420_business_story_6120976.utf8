 Orascom ball now in FIPB court

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 19: The department of telecom (DoT) has sought clarifications from the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) on whether Orascom Telecoms investment in Hutchison Telecom International Limited (HTIL) violates the existing FDI norms.

 Egypt-based telecom service provider Orascom Telecom had acquired a 19.3 per cent stake in HTIL, which also gave the former around 10 per cent indirect stake in Hutch Essar. 

 Hutch Essar is a cellular phone service provider with a major subscriber base in Delhi and Mumbai among other places in India.

 Press Note 5, which defines the contours of FDI in telecom in India, states that 74 per cent FDI can be made directly or indirectly in the operating company or via a holding company. The remaining 26 per cent will be owned by resident Indian citizens or an Indian company. 

 Orascoms stake in Hutch has come under government scrutiny on grounds of security threat as Orascom is a leading telecom player in Pakistan and Bangladesh as well.

 The DoT, it is learnt, has informed the Prime Ministers Office (PMO) that Orascoms acquisition of 19.3 per cent equity in Hutchison Telecom International is not a security threat to the companys operations in the country. 

 Sources said clarifications had been sought on several issues in the context of the fact that a promoter is the one who has a direct equity stake in the licensee company, and not the holding or subsidiary company of the promoter. 

 Hutchison Telecommunications, HK, remains the promoter of Hutchison Telecommunications International and this has not changed. 

 Hutchison Telecommunications International remains the promoter of Hutchison Telecom (India), Mauritius (the direct shareholder in Hutchison Essar) and this too, has not changed, a source said.

 It, therefore, needs to be clarified whether any prior regulatory approval is required if an investment is made in the international promoter company who is not actually the licensee in India, sources said.

 Sources said in the context of the Orascom-Hutch deal the government has to keep in mind that theres a very thin line between shareholding and the capacity to influence policies. 

 It is a difficult issue whether a shareholding in a company will influence the policies or whether MNCs coming into this country (while being in other countries as well) are an equal security hazard, sources said.

 Calcutta, Aug. 25: Emami Limited is in talks for a technical tie-up to open an ayurvedic spa chain in Thailand, Indonesia, the United Kingdom and India.

 The company, which is expecting a 35 per cent rise in turnover this fiscal at Rs 600 crore, is set to tap the domestic market with its ayurvedic range.

 The turnover will be achieved by the merged entity of Emami with JB Marketing Limited, which has a distribution network of 24 depots, 2,200 distributors, 1,200 sub-distributors and a direct coverage of three to eight lakh outlets.

 The company says it would be the first-of-its-kind exclusive international Ayurvedic spa chain in the country.

 We also want to make Boroplus a global brand. The company is in talks with international consultants to strategise and formulate a roadmap and would invest Rs 25 to Rs 30 crore, said R.S. Agarwal, chairman of Emami.

 The project would be backed by the research facility of Himani Ayurvedic Science Foundation.

 The company is also expecting a 40 to 50 per cent growth in its exports to 52 countries at Rs 40 crore.

 The focus markets for exports would be CIS, Africa and West Asia.

 There is a special Gold and Ayurcare range for export markets. The offshore markets are looked after by Emami UK, Emami Bangladesh and Emami International FZE that are especially set up for this, Agarwal said.

 The company has also entered into a distribution alliance with 45 department stores in the UK and has introduced a special line of products for the NRIs there.

 Emami has also entered the hair dye category with test launches of Mr Black and Mrs Black hair dye.

 This fiscal, the company plans to test launch fairness creams, a memory booster syrup and many other products for the domestic market.

 More spectrum for telecom

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Talking point

 New Delhi, April 19: Telecom companies, which have been snarling at each other over spectrum allocations, will finally get more bandwidth on the airwaves. 

 The government today announced a Rs 1,000-crore project aimed at releasing an additional 45 MHz of spectrum for civilian telecom use by converting wireless operations of defence services to a more efficient optic fibre network.

 The release of more spectrum ? which is expected in the next two to three months ? will end the clamour for more bandwidth and will enable the private telecom players to ramp up their 2G operations and maybe also draw up plans for an eventual 3G rollout.

 At present, the major portion of defence wireless services is based on microwave technology, which is not as efficient as the optic fibre system which will replace it in phases.

 We have begun the project involving officials from both the ministry of telecom and defence. The department of telecom (DoT) will be spending Rs 1,000 crore, DoT secretary J.S. Sarma said on the sidelines of a conference organised by Assocham here.

 The project is expected to be completed within the next two to three months.

 Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) will execute the project and the spectrum released would be allocated to operators for 2G (existing mobile services) as well as 3G (next generation mobile services) services. 

 Sarma said the project was implemented as an alternative strategy to meet the immediate demand for spectrum allocation to telecom operators. This is over and above the long-term plan to get the defence department to release some more spectrum.

 A group of ministers (GoM) headed by defence minister Pranab Mukherjee will look into the issue of releasing additional spectrum from defence services to telecom operators. 

 The GoM is, however, yet to conduct its first meeting on this issue. 

 Sarma said a great deal of controversy had arisen over spectrum in the telecom sector for quite some time and now with the joint initiatives of ministries of defence and telecommunications the issue would shortly be settled for good.

 Convergence to slash telecom licence cost

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 20: The telecom regulator today came out with the first roadmap for the convergence of telecom and broadcasting services and suggested that the cost of a unified licence should be slashed to Rs 5 crore from the earlier level of Rs 107 crore. It also said the cost of the licence should eventually go down to Rs 30 lakh after five years.

 The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) unveiled its final recommendations on a convergence regime by suggesting that there should be ?full flexibility in spectrum allocation to take full advantage of new services and new technologies for existing services that may evolve with time.?

 ?Convergence of technologies is rapidly blurring the boundaries between telecommunications and broadcasting. It is necessary for the legal and regulatory framework to adapt to this convergence and actively promote it. This would also help in facilitating competition,? it added.

 Spectrum allocation has been the most contentious issue that has riven the telecom industry with the cellular service providers using GSM technology (principally Hutch and Airtel) lobbying hard against the grant of more radio frequencies to the CDMA players (basically Tata Teleservices and Reliance Infocomm).

 Trai tried to steer clear of this issue and said ?spectrum allocation should be technology and service neutral to the extent possible so as to avail of the full benefits of a converged licensing regime.?

 It recommended the establishment of a unified regulator for telecommunications and said the contours of the new regime should be based on the Communications Convergence Bill 2001. ?There should be converged regulatory regime. The starting point for this exercise should be the Communications Convergence Bill, 2001,? it said.

 However, several changes need to be made in this bill. Content regulation should be kept out of the purview of the converged regulator. The division of powers between the government, TDSAT and Trai should also broadly correspond to the current position, it added 

 Trai said the cost of the unified licence should be slashed to Rs 5 crore because of the sharp fall in the cost of the national long distance (NLD) and international long distance licence from Rs 100 crore and Rs 25 crore respectively to Rs 2.5 crore now. These cuts have taken place since Trai framed its first set of recommendations for a unified licensing regime back in January 2005 when it had suggested a unified licence fee of Rs 107 crore.

 The regulator said the government should immediately accept the unified licensing regime that it recommended in January 2005 and not wait for legislative arrangements which ?may take considerable time?.

 Trai urged the government to undertake a complete review of the policy on foreign direct investment (FDI) for the various sub-sectors in telecommunications and broadcasting ?so that there is consistency in policy and a level-playing field between competing technologies?.

 In another set of recommendations on next-generation networks (NGNs), Trai has called for reconsideration of local loop unbundling which can expedite the uptake of broadband through the existing copper loops by bringing in competition.

 NGNs enable the service providers to provide a wide range of services ? voice, data, video ? over the same platform. In addition, NGNs also enable fixed-mobile convergence and substitution resulting into reduced demand on mobile services spectrum. 

 Trai also recommended delicensing of spectrum in 5.1 to 5.3 GHz band for outdoor usage and also identification of some additional spectrum for broadband access. 

 The major thrust of Trai?s recommendations is to bring out the urgent need for converged/ unified licensing regime ?to enable NGN networks to be utilised to their full capabilities and promotion of broadband in the country?.

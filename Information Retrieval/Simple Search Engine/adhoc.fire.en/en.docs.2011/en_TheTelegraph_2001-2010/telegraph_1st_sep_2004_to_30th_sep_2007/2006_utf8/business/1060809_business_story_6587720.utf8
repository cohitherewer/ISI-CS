 Steel shines on S amp;P chart

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Aug. 8: Standard amp; Poors (S amp;P), the international credit rating agency, today affirmed its BBB corporate credit rating with a stable outlook on Tata Steel. 

 S amp;P also affirmed its BBB rating on Tata Steels $500-million seven-year senior unsecured bank loan facility. 

 The ratings are supported by Tata Steels position as one of the lowest-cost steel producers in the world, its increased geographical diversity, and its broader product mix, said S amp;Ps credit analyst Anshukant Taneja.

 The rating derives its cost competitiveness from Tata Steels integrated business and improved operating efficiency through modernising facilities and introducing innovative processes. 

 The companys recent acquisitions of Singapores NatSteel and Thailands Millennium Steel has also widened its manufacturing base in Southeast Asia. 

 The rating on Tata Steel also benefits from the companys moderate financial profile and robust domestic demand for steel, which is expected to expand 7-8 per cent a year, said Taneja added. He, however, added that the rating is constrained by inherent industry risks, increasing exposure to project-related risks, and integration challenges from its acquisitions.

 Tata Steel is exposed to cyclical steel prices, resulting in some unpredictability in its earnings. Although prices have recovered in recent months, hot-rolled coil prices dropped to about $410 per tonne between April-December 2005, from an average $595 in January 2005, the rating agency noted.

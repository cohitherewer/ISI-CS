 UTI Bank mops up $150 m

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Aug. 5: UTI Bank has become the first bank to raise foreign currency hybrid capital just a few days after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) allowed domestic banks to do so. 

 The private sector bank raised $150 million through 15-year subordinated Upper Tier II bonds on Friday. The bonds were priced with a fixed coupon of 7.25 per cent, equivalent to a spread of 231.5 basis points over the 10-year US treasury, or a yield of 7.23 per cent.

 The bank, which had already established its medium term notes (MTN) programme, had the Upper Tier II structure built into the programme to raise the capital. Under Basel II norms, Indian banks have to shore up their capitals to provide for market risk and to support the expansion of their balance sheets. 

 While this was the first international debt offering by UTI Bank, the transaction has pioneered the market for regulatory capital for all Indian banks to follow. 

 According to UTI Bank, the actual trade was priced at less than the tighter end of the guidance at 172 basis points against the initial guidance of LIBOR plus 175-200 basis points.

 Moreover, investors showed a good appetite for the issue.

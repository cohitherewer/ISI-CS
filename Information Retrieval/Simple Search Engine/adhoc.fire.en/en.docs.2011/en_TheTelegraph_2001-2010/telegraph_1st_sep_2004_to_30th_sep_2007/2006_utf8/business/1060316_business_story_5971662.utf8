CLB blueprint to end Haldia Petro stake row

Rays of hope

 New Delhi, March 15 (PTI): The company law board has suggested a four-point compromise formula to end the legal battle between The Chatterjee Group and the Bengal government over Haldia Petrochemicals Ltd. 

 According to the formula suggested by CLB chairman S. Balasubramanian, TCG becomes the largest shareholder till Haldia Petro comes up with an initial public offering.

 It also proposes that all agreements between The Chatterjee Group (petitioners) and the government (represented by West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation) relating to share transfers held by the latter to the former would be treated as cancelled.

 Further, WBIDC will also refund whatever part payment TCG has made to it for transfer of shares.

 Balasubramanian also suggested that TCG would not contest the Rs 150-crore share allotment to Indian Oil Corporation and financial institutions led by IDBI in terms of corporate debt restructuring package worth Rs 135 crore.

 After the allotment of shares to IDBI, the petitioners (TCG) will be allotted such number of equity shares (roughly Rs 395 crore) which could increase their shareholding to 51 per cent. The allotment will be on a par as in the case of IOC and IDBI, he suggested.

 He also proposed that HPL would go for an IPO by the book building process or otherwise within a set timeframe of three to four months.

 If the formula suggested by Balasubramanian is accepted by TCG, IOC, the Bengal government and financial institutions led by IDBI, HPL will have an immediate cash flow of Rs 395 crore, which can be utilised to repay outstanding debt and reduce the debt-equity ratio.

 Besides, it gives WBIDC the option to divest its share either fully or in part through the IPO. IDBI also gets its loan repaid and will have an option to sell the allotted shares in the open market.

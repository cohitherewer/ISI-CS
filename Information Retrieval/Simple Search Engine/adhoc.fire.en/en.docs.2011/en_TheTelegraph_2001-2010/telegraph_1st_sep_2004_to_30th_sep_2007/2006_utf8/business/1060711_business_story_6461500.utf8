 North Bengal awaits tea fund potion

 Ramesh: Fund support

 Siliguri, July 10: North Bengal is poised to become one of the biggest beneficiaries of the special purpose tea fund (STPF). 

 The region will receive Rs 1,400 crore from the Rs 4,500-crore fund set up by the Centre for re-plantation and rejuvenation of the tea bushes in the next 15 years, said Jairam Ramesh, minister of state for commerce and industry, at a meeting with various stakeholder associations of the north Bengal tea industry in Siliguri.

 Around 60,000 hectares in Bengal needs replantation or rejuvenation. In Darjeeling, 11,000 hectares of tea bushes require rejuvenation. Around 38 per cent of bush age profile is above 40 years.

 The productivity of gardens in north Bengal is suffering and a major reason is the age of the bushes. The fund, which was delayed and was slated to kick start from November 1, would help address a part of the productivity issue, Ramesh stated.

 The minister also pointed out that 15 gardens were closed in Jalpaiguri district, some due to structural problems and others because of transient issues.

 He urged the state and the district authorities to provide him with a quick analysis of five gardens that fell sick due to structural problems within a month.

 The commerce ministry, Ramesh said, had already received proposals from INTUC and Citu on the revival of sick gardens. 

 In a scheduled meeting with the commodity boards and the banking secretary on July 14, banks like Nabard have agreed to have a look at such proposals.

 The state and the Centre have been a failure in terms of negotiating and devising a strategy for sick gardens. The central government is ready to look at and support viable alternative models of sick garden revival programmes, Ramesh assured.

 In his last meeting with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, the chief minister was keen on allowing the use of tea estate land in Bengal for other commodities like rubber, spices and medicinal plants along with tea.

 The Tea Board has been asked to prepare a proposal on the economic viability of such alternate cropping.

 The Centre was also keen on doing something for the 15,000 small growers in Bengal who account for 25 per cent of the tea output.

 The small growers have been nurtured and play a key role in other tea producing countries like Sri Lanka and Kenya. These growers boost the local economy by fostering homegrown entrepreneurship, Ramesh said.

 The Centre may also consider setting up cooperative processing units like the ones promised in Assam.

 The Tea Board is planning to take a delegation of small growers to Kenya to study the small growers pattern there.

 The minister would also be writing to major corporate houses like Duncans, Andrew Yule and Tata Tea to participate in the ailing Jalpaiguri auction centre.

 Ramesh also urged the state government to chalk out a plan for a 60 to 70-acre common auction facility centre.

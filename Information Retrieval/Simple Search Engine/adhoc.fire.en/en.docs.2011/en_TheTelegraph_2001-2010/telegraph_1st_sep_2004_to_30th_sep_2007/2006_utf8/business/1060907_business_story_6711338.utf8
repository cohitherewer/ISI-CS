 Final drill on methane hunt

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Calcutta, Sept. 6: The empowered committee of secretaries, responsible for awarding coal-bed methane (CBM) blocks, will meet tomorrow to make its final recommendations to the cabinet.

 The committee will take stock of the charges levelled by the Anil Ambani group on discretionary marking by the director-general of hydrocarbon (DGH), which led to the Ambani-led consortium losing two blocks.

 Sources close to the Anil camp said the minutes of the last meeting of the committee that took place on August 10 was changed thrice to suit the claim of DGH that technical parameters were laid down before bids were received and evaluated.

 Fifty four bids were received for 10 blocks under the third round of CBM bidding. The licences were to be awarded by August 31, 2006. But the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA), chaired by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, deferred a decision and sent it back to the empowered committee.

 Tomorrows meeting is expected to be attended by petroleum, coal, finance and law secretaries.

 Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group (ADAG) companies Reliance Natural Resource Ltd (RNRL) and Reliance Energy Ltd (REL) teamed up with GeoPetrol International and the consortium was the preferred bidder for four blocks.

 The consortium claimed that it could win two more blocks if the DGH did not use discretionary powers.

 ADAG is concerned about three points out of hundred where the DGHs discretion can make a difference. 

 These three points may prove decisive in selecting the winning bidder where two or more bidders have more or less equal points in all other criteria.

 Of the three points, two are for technical assessment and one for any other work.

 The draft note of the August 10 committee meeting that was sent to the CCEA said, The DGH had divided these two points (technical assessment) among the following parameters, but after receipt of the bids on 30.6.06, before the bid evaluation was undertaken by DGH.

 However, in the final note sent to the CCEA, some alterations were made. It read: The DGH has divided these two points among the following sub-criteria even before the bids were received and opened on 30.6.06.

 The minutes of the meeting that circulated among the members of ECS read: The DGH had divided these two points among the following parameters, before the bid evaluation was undertaken by DGH.

 DGH has all along maintained that parameters were described in notice inviting offers (NIO).

 ADAG said the government would get more revenue if the two contentious blocks were awarded to its consortium instead of the GAIL-Arrow Energy consortium.

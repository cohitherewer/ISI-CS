 BA figures gain height

 Ups and downs

 London, Aug. 5 (Reuters): British Airways (BA) reported a 20 per cent rise in first-quarter profit on Friday helped by fuller planes, but its shares fell as it warned of a tougher second half and higher-than-expected labour costs. 

 BA, Europes third-largest airline, raised its guidance for sales this year after filling more first-and-business-class seats but said the second-half would be tough as airlines discount tickets amid stiff competition.

 It is going to be a year of two halves. We dont expect to see the strong revenue performance we saw in the first quarter to continue through the year, chief executive Willie Walsh said, echoing comments from rival Ryanair this week. 

 Operating profit for the three months to June 30 was 211 million compared with 176 million a year ago, and revenue jumped 12.5 per cent. 

 The result was in line with analysts consensus forecasts of 213 million in a wide range of 193 million to 267 million, according to figures provided by the company. 

 BA said its load factor a measure of how well it is filling planes in the first quarter was up 2.7 points to a record 78.3 per cent. 

 BA shares fell 1.5 per cent to 383-1/4 pence by 08:28 am. The stock has risen about 34 per cent in the last 12 months relative to an 8 per cent rise for the DJ Stoxx European travel and leisure index. 

 It was broadly in line (with expectations). Revenues were better but costs were worse. There was good and bad news but both were expected, Oriel Securities analyst Gerald Khoo said. 

 The airline said costs excluding fuel would be slightly higher due to the impact of pension contributions on its rising labour bill. BA has previously tipped flat costs for the year. 

 Fuel costs climb 

 Fuel costs would be 550-600 million higher as expected. BA and other airlines have partly offset record oil prices with passenger fuel surcharges. 

 Walsh told Reuters the airline had no immediate plan to raise fuel surcharges despite rising oil prices. The airline has 65 per cent of its fuel needs for the year hedged at $62. 

 Walsh declined to comment on a joint US-UK investigation into alleged cartel activity over airfares and fuel charges.

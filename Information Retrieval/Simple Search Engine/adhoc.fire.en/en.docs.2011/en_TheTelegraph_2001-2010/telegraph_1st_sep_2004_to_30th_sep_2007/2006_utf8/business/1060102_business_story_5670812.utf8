The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Back-office fights blues 

 M. RAJENDRAN

 New Delhi, Jan. 1: Kkaran Bahree and Pratibha Srikant Murthy represent the two faces of the tragedy that engulfs Indias BPO industry, which teeters between its rogues and victims.

 Rape, murder and fraud ? the BPO industry was rocked by shame and scandal in 2005 and the way it blundered through the crises hasnt inspired a great deal of confidence.

 Bahree was accused of ripping off records of overseas clients handled by his firm and selling it to an undercover reporter from Sun, the London tabloid, in a sting operation. 

 Pratibha, an employee of HP GlobalSoft in Bangalore, was raped and murdered by the driver of the van that had come to pick her up for the late-night shift, sending another frisson of fear through women working in call centres. The industry has tended to brush these incidents away as mere aberrations. 

 Nasscom feels that the issue of safety and security are of prime concern. Nasscom president Kiran Karnik says, The industry is alive to the problem and is constantly evaluating these measures. There is no one-stop solution that can resolve it. 

 However, Pavan Duggal, a senior cyber law expert, feels that the BPO industry is trying to duck its responsibility for both the Bahree and Pratibha episodes. He says unless the Indian ITeS sector takes a few measures like external audit of its security (of data) and safety (for its employees), it runs the risk of losing jobs from their foreign clients. 

 Commenting on the rape and murder of the HP employee in Bangalore, Karnik says it was an unfortunate incident. He described it as a crime that just happened with an employee of a BPO company. However, Karnik is quick to add that companies are taking measures using technology like global positioning system (GPS) and physical measures to combat such problems.

 Nasscom vice-president Sunil Mehta says, quot;We have collected best practices and are circulating it among our members. The use of route mapping and optimisation software in addition to other physical measures would form part of it. quot; 

 A senior executive in IBM Daksh says, We have implemented a route mapping and fleet management software and we use a combination of manual and technology to offer maximum security to our staff.

 Atul Kunwar, chief of e-Funds International, another BPO firm, says, We have our own software for fleet management and till date it has functioned effectively.

 ONGC, Shell ink pact

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Jan. 19: The Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) today signed a memorandum of understanding with Anglo-Dutch firm Royal Dutch Shell for co-operation in oil and gas exploration and production, refining and renewable sources of energy.

 The areas of potential co-operation specified in the agreement include increasing output from producing fields in India and joint bidding in exploration acreage rounds here .

 The MoU was signed by ONGC chairman and managing director Subir Raha and Shell (India) chairman Vikram Singh Mehta.

 Raha said the two companies would look at joint exploration in blocks owned by ONGC and develop surface coal gassification projects.

 The collaboration will extend to possible participation by the two companies in the petrochemical plant at Hazira and export of products from Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd.

 Raha said with this pact there are higher chances of ONGC picking up a stake in Shell?s $660-million Hazira LNG import terminal in Gujarat. 

 ONGC, which has a 20 per cent stake in the Sakhalin-1 project in Russia, was looking at possibilities of picking up a stake in Shell-operated Sakhalin-II, he added.

 The duo will also evaluate the setting up of a joint venture bitumen business in India and joint business opportunities in marine fuels and lubricants. 

 Shell and ONGC will set up a steering committee to assess the areas of co-operation.

 The partners will also evaluate options to exploit the potentials of stranded ONGC natural gas resources. 

 They will tap opportunities in setting up joint coal gassification facilities in India and co-operate in generating renewable energy, such as wind energy for power.

 Mehta said, ?Shell is not present in the upstream business in India. This MoU will fill the gap.? 

 Petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar said, ?The MoU covers areas of my deepest concern. It would network Shell?s immense knowledge base with ONGC?s technical know-how.? 

 ?We have to exponentially increase our domestic production of oil and gas. Shell?s partnership will help do that,? he added.

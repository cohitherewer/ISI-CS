 Fortis pre-IPO fetches $33m

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Dec. 5: Fortis Healthcare, part of the Ranbaxy group, has issued 1.19 crore shares to Quantum and Blue Ridge for an aggregate amount of $33.33 million.

 Quantum is an international fund set up by George Soros.

 While a maximum of 5.96 million equity shares each will be issued to Quantum and Blue Ridge, Fortis said it will be at a price that is equal to the IPO price. 

 The shares to be issued to Quantum and Blue Ridge will be subject to lock-in after the IPO, according to the regulations of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi). Fortis had filed its draft red herring prospectus with Sebi on September 29 for entering the capital market with its IPO of over 5.66 crore shares. 

 Subsequent to the pre-IPO investment, the number of equity shares to be issued to the public in the IPO would be reduced to the extent of the number of shares issued to Blue Ridge and Quantum. According to the prospectus filed with the market regulator, Fortis has left a provision of a maximum of 17,884,614 equity shares for a pre-IPO placement.

 Commenting on the development, Shivinder Mohan Singh, managing director of Fortis Healthcare and Escorts Heart, said: We are overwhelmed at the response and the keen interest shown in the pre-IPO offer. This investment benchmarks an encouraging value range for our company. 

 Fortis Healthcare has a network of 12 hospitals, primarily in North India, and 16 satellite and heart command centres (15 in hospitals across the country and one heart command centre in Afghanistan).

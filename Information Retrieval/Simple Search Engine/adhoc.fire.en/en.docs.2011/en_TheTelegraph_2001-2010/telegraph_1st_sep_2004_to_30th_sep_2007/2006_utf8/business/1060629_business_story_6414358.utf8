 Tough time for bankers

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, June 28: The 25 basis point hike in reverse repo and repo rates by the Reserve Bank, which has led interest rates to firm up, is not the only challenge that bankers are facing.

 After witnessing robust credit offtake for the past couple of years, bankers may witness a drop in credit demand on account of rising interest rates.

 And this is not all. With bond yields slated to rise, balance sheets of some public sector banks could be hit since they would have to make higher investment provisions as they mark to market their investments in bonds.

 Sighting these key possibilities, leading investment banker Merrill Lynch has brought down its earnings forecast for the entire sector by 5-20 per cent in a recent report. 

 Merrill Lynch expects yields on the benchmark 10-year government security to rise by at least 85 basis points this fiscal against its earlier estimate of 50 basis points and an additional 45 basis points in the subsequent year.

 The report ? Rising Rate Hedges; Revising Rates and Estimates ? has downgraded Canara Bank and Vijaya Bank due to their high vulnerability to rising bond yields. 

 Due to a rise in lending rates, Merrill Lynch expects loan growth to slowdown to 24 per cent this year, marginally lower from its earlier projection of 25-26 per cent.

 Loan growth momentum could decelerate more sharply in 2007-08 as rates continue to rise and loan growth could potentially fall to around 18 per cent by 2008, especially if some of the infrastructure projects are impacted by rising rates, the report said.

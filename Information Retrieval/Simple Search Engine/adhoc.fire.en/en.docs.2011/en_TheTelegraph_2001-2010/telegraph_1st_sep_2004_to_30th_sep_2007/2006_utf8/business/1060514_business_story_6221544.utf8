 Adani lands in Mumbai

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, May 13: The Ahmedabad?based Adani Group has got the land rights for close to 10 lakh square feet of land in the commercial hub of Mumbai ? the Bandra Kurla Complex. 

 According to industry sources, the deal is expected to be priced at close to Rs 700 crore.

 ?Land in and around the complex cannot be bought or sold because most of it is on a 99-year lease. So a developer can just buy the rights to develop the land,? said a real estate analyst. 

 Once the rights are passed on to developers, it is completely up to them to develop the land and sell the space in their own way. 

 The developer, in this case the Adani Group, in turn can develop property over the land and can sell. 

 Refusing to give any details, the Adani Group spokesperson said, ?Negotiations are at a preliminary stage right now. We have a board meeting sometime this month and will discuss the detail plan for the deal. We have formed an SPV for the transaction called Adani Realty.? 

 Housing Development and Improvement India Limited, a 12-year-old construction company, which has been involved in development activities in the western and the eastern suburbs of the city, is said to have sold off the rights to the land. The company, which claims to part of the Dheeraj Group, is promoted by Rakesh Wadhwan. 

 ?I confirm the transaction, but will not be able to divulge any details. It will not be in our business interest to give out any more details,? A.K. Gupta, spokesperson for Housing Development and Improvement India Limited, said today. 

 The Adani Group, known primarily for its export-oriented business, has in the past five to six years diversified into logistics with the opening up of its private port in Mundra in 2000. The company now has a supermarket chain and is into gas distribution business in Gujarat. 

 The Bandra Kurla Complex has seen a flurry of activity in real estate in the recent past. 

 Starting with the Diamond Bourse that bought land at Rs 42,500 a sq mt in 1995, prices surged when Citibank forked out Rs 86,000 a sq mt in 2000. Reportedly, when Jet Air bought early this year, it was priced at Rs 1,53,000 per sq mt per FSI. At two FSI, the effective price was Rs 300,000 per sq mt. 

 By the end of this year, an additional 800,000 sq ft of commercial space will be added. The convention centre, for which Mukesh Ambanis Reliance Industries outbid brother Anil Ambani, is expected to come up in four years? time.

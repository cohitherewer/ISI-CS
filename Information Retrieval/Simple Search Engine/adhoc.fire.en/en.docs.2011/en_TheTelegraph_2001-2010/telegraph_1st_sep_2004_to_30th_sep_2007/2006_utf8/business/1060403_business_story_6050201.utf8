 Cell-shocked by mobile virus

 URVASHI KAUL

 New Delhi, April 2: Is your cellphone throwing tantrums ? switching off without warning, sending junk messages to your contacts, resetting your handset icons, locking the key pad far too often and typing what you don?t intend to?

 If you are wondering whether it is a hardware problem, think again. Your handset could have been attacked by a mobile virus.

 Viruses are no longer restricted to your personal computer. They have the potential to turn your handset into ?quite a junk?.

 A mobile virus gene- rally attacks multi-functional smart phones that have features like Internet connectivity and in-built cameras. Currently, smart phones that operate on the Symbian operating system, Bluetooth (enabled devices) and the Windows system are the ones that are in danger.

 The viruses enter through email attachments, multi-media system (MMS), SMS spam or while you browse the Net. Industry experts feel mobile devices will increasingly come under attack from viruses, especially handsets with wi-fi cards.

 ?The threat of mobile viruses in India at the moment is not severe. However, India already has 45-50 million mobile subscribers and by the end of 2007, the target is likely to reach about 200 million. Of this, even if 40 per cent are smart phone users, you can imagine what we are looking at,? said Kartik Sahani, sales manager of McAfee India.

 As more mobile handsets give way to smart phones, virus writers are likely to capitalise on this trend, said Niraj Kaushik, country manager of Trend Micro.

 ?Although only a fraction of mobile users are using sophisticated phones that are at risk, the virus threat to mobile phones is real and quite dangerous,? said Kaushik.

 Mobile viruses can hack your smart phone, control it, reduce its battery life, look up your contact list, destroy stored data and even listen to confidential conversations.

 ?The fact that mobile phones are always switched on and networked, makes them even more vulnerable than PCs,? said Kaushik. 

 Bharti and Hutch spokespersons said virus attacks have nothing to do with service providers as their job is to provide network connection. Handset manufacturers, along with anti-virus companies, have to lead the virus prevention drive.

 While McAfee is talking to handset makers for imbedded anti-virus solutions in smart phones, it is also offering downloads from its website, Sahani said. Trend Micro has entered into a global agreement with Ericsson to offer anti-virus solutions on its mobile devices.

 The software companies are also exploring ways to involve telecom operators in this battle against viruses. 

 ?As the capabilities of smart phones increase, enterprises should protect themselves from the growing threat that these devices can pose,? said an Ericsson spokesperson. 

 Industry experts feel the fact that market leaders are working towards creating solutions to counter mobile viruses calls for an increasing need to recognise the problem.

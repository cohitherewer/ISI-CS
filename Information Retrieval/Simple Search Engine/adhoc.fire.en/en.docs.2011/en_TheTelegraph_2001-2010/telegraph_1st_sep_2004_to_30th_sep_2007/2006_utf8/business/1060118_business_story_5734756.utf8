 New flight roster for airport update

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 17: In a new twist to the airport update saga, the committee of secretaries (CoS) now wants to hand over GMR-Fraport the task to develop Delhi airport. For Mumbai, it is in favour of rebidding.

 In future, it wants the government to look into the possibility of using the special purpose vehicle route as suggested by the Sreedharan committee to modernise airports. 

 The Sreedharan committee had recommended scrapping of the current bids. Instead, it wanted either the Airports Authority of India to float SPVs to fund the development of the two airports taking on foreign airports as partners or else go in for limited bidding among the pre-qualified aspirants. 

 Faced with several alternatives offered by the Sreedharan committee and now the CoS, the group of ministers will have to take a final decision on January 24. 

 Sources said members of the CoS believe the government should go ahead with the privatisation of the Delhi airport as the Sreedharan committee has not objected to the selection of GMR-Fraport combine, which was selected by the consultants to the bidding process. Officials, however, warn that such a move may not be legally or politically tenable. If the bid for Delhi airport is accepted while those for Mumbai are refused, it could open up the possibility of legal duels. Moreover, the Left has accused the consultants of having links with both Reliance-Airport Mexico and GMR-Fraport. Any move to award the Delhi contract to GMR could upset the Left.

 Facelift for Bombay High

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Hunt for Black gold

 Calcutta, Sept. 10: The Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) plans to invest Rs 12,000 crore in Bombay High. The company is preparing a re-development plan for the field that meets 14 per cent of the countrys oil requirement and accounts for 38 per cent of the domestic production.

 Work on this programme will begin next year and continue for the entire duration of the Eleventh Five-Year Plan period.

 It will help ONGC maintain the production level at 12.5 million tonnes a year, thereby containing normal annual losses.

 Production from any oil and gas field start declining after reaching a peak. Fresh developments, such as drilling new oil wells, are required to sustain the level. ONGCs last re-development plan had cost Rs 9,000 crore.

 N.K. Mitra, director (offshore) of ONGC, said the board would consider the matter by the middle of next year.

 Under the plan, 17 to 18 wells will be drilled and two platforms will be set up. 

 The reserves at Bombay High, located 161 km north of the Mumbai coast, are expected to last until 2030.

 ONGC produced 49.6 million tonnes of oil and oil equivalent gas last year.

 Marginal fields plan

 ONGC plans to invest between Rs 8,000 and 10,000 crore to develop 29 marginal fields. The company has 89 such fields.

 Mitra said ONGC was hoping to get 12-15 million standard cubic metre of gas and 5-6 million standard cubic metre of oil per day from these fields by 2012.

 The board has cleared the first series of investment. I expect it to approve all development plans by May-June next year, he added.

 The gas from these fields will fetch non-administered prices.

 The company did not develop the fields when international crude oil prices were low. The rise in prices in the last two years has made development of these fields profitable. 

 Moreover, ONGCs failure to bring in any new large production assets in the past few years has prompted it to explore existing sources.

 However, re-development of producing fields and development of marginal fields will only arrest natural decline in production, not increase it.

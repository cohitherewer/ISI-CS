 Voting right check on 26% FDI in bourses

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Anxious wait

 New Delhi, Sept. 21: The finance ministry has prepared a note to allow 26 per cent foreign direct investment in stock exchanges though with a lower voting right. 

 An inter-ministerial group will vet the note and give its in-principal clearance before the proposal comes up before the cabinet. There are reservations within some sections of the government over allowing foreign investment in stock exchanges, which are seen as vital to the economy. 

 There is a feeling that once sold to a foreign investor, it would be difficult to monitor the activities of a stock exchange and ultimately, at some stage, the control may go to a foreign corporation about whom India may not be too happy, officials said. 

 However, some officials feel that even if FDI is allowed in bourses, safeguards could be built in by placing conditions on re-sale of shares. 

 The North Block note wants to limit FDI in stock exchanges at 26 per cent. However, voting rights may be capped at 5-10 per cent. Finance ministry officials are in touch with both the regulators the Securities and Exchange Board of India and the Reserve Bank on this issue.

 Sources said Sebi is in favour of 26 per cent FDI in bourses. The market regulator feels that with stock exchanges being corporatised and broker members asked to bring down their ownership, the vacuum could be filled by FDI. 

 Officials do not expect foreign investors to be interested in any stock exchange in India other than the BSE and the National Stock Exchange.

 There is also a possibility that a decision on FDI in bourses may have to wait till a code on security clearances is formulated. The government wants to bring in such a code for sensitive sectors like telecom and aviation.

 The Bombay Stock Exchange had reportedly made it clear that 26 per cent of the stake would be sold to strategic investors and the remaining 25 per cent through an IPO.

 Over a month back, Nasdaq officials met their counterparts in BSE, giving rise to speculation that the technical exchange would pick up a stake in it.

 BSE has appointed Kotak Mahindra Capital as its financial adviser for the demutualisation process.

 Buyout leash on China oil giant

 Hong Kong, Jan. 3 (Reuters): Minority shareholders in Chinas top offshore oil and gas producer, CNOOC Ltd, rejected a proposal that would allow its state-owned parent to acquire overseas assets on behalf of the group, dealing a setback to the groups expansion ambitions.

 Shares in CNOOC, which last year lost its $18.5-billion takeover bid for Unocal Corp to Chevron in the face of stiff political opposition in the United States, fell by nearly 2 per cent in early Tuesday trade before recovering to HK$5.25 ? the same level as their previous close.

 CNOOCs proposal would have changed a non-competition agreement with the companys unlisted parent, state-owned China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC),allowing the parent to engage in competing business in China and overseas, as long as it had the listed companys consent.

 Since CNOOCs 2001 listing, it has focused on offshore exploration and production activity while its parent has focused on downstream projects, such as liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals.

 Under the rejected amendment, the overall group would have had more flexibility in making overseas acquisitions.

 The proposal had been opposed by Hong Kong shareholder activist David Webb, who had said on his www.webb-site.com: We urge investors to vote against this value-destroying proposal. Why give up something so valuable for nothing?

 CNOOC said in a statement late on Monday that it regretted the outcome of the vote. Nonetheless, we still believe that the proposed amendments ... if passed, would be beneficial to the Company and its shareholders as a whole, CNOOC said in the statement.

 Furthermore, the company could have the right to acquire projects from the parent company when they are beneficial to the company. It would provide opportunities for the future development of the company, and the interests of the company, as well as minority shareholders, would be sufficiently protected.

 CNOOC had hoped to adopt a structure that would allow its unlisted parent to conduct riskier business ? a model followed by its bigger rival, PetroChina Co Ltd.

 Chinese oil giants are searching the globe to secure supplies to fuel the worlds second-largest oil-consuming nation.

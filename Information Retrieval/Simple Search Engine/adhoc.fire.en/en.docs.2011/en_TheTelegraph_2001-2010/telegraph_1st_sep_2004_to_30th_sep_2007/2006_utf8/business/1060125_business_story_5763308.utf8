 Mallya: In search of truth

 Mumbai, Jan. 24: Vijay Mallya, chairman and managing director of Kingfisher Airlines Ltd, today criticised Air Deccan honcho G.R. Gopinath for putting a wrong spin on the initiative by four airlines to form an association and lobby the government for equitable allocation of airport infrastructure facilities among airlines.

 Mallya denied Gopinaths claim that the meeting of the chieftains of the four airlines ? Kingfisher Airlines, Air Deccan, Go Airlines and IndiGo ? held on January 17 was aimed at opposing the creation of a Jet-Sahara monopoly. 

 I am surprised at Gopinaths statement wherein he states that the alliance was formed only to take on the Jet/Sahara monopoly. It is regrettable that Gopinath has chosen to make insinuations and contradict a memorandum signed by himself which is self explanatory, Mallya said in a statement.

 To buttress his argument, Mallya released the minutes of the meeting that was held at his Napean Sea Road residence which was signed by Mallya, Gopinath, Jeh Wadia of Go Airlines and Rahul Bhatia of IndiGo.

 The minutes indicate that the meeting had unanimously agreed to form an association called Indian Airline Operators Association, which would collectively represent to the government the need to provide a level-playing field. The aim was to seek equitable allocation of overnight parking slots at various airports, prime time departures and arrivals, terminal facilities, shared services, and outsourcing. 

 The group would also lobby the government to lower taxes on aircraft fuel and allow hedging.

 The alliance members had also agreed not to hire licensed manpower from each other. However, they decided to share technical manpower and training instructors. They also wanted to establish a common compensation package for all licensed expatriates. Almost all the airlines have been hiring pilots from abroad to deal with a shortage of trained personnel.

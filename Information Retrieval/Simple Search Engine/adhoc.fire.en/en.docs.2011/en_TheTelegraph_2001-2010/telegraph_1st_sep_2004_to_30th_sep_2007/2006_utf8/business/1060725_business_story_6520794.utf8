 Spentex buys Uzbek spinning company

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 24: Spentex Industries has acquired Tashkent-Toyetpa Tekftil Limited, a state-owned spinning company of Uzbekistan, for Rs 380 crore.

 Spentex will acquire two manufacturing facilities located in Uzbekistans capital Tashkent and in Toyetpa, which are the largest manufacturing units in central Asia, managing director Mukund Choudhary said. 

 The two units have an installed capacity of 220,000 spindles and a weaving capacity of 236 air jet looms.

 The deal has made Spentex the countrys largest spinning firm with an installed capacity of over 5,70,000 spindles, Choudhary said.

 Spentex will pay the deal amount over four years. the company has formed a subsidiary, Spentex Tashkent Toyetpa, in Uzbekistan for the transaction, which would be funded by a mixture of internal accruals, equity and borrowings. 

 The government of Uzbekistan has given Spentex a number of incentives, including a 50 per cent discount on raw cotton, exemption on corporate taxes, customs duty and value-added tax. Spentex will have to pay a 6 per cent income tax compared with other exporters 12 per cent.

 Spentex exports 50 per cent of its cotton yarn produced in India. It plans to export 100 per cent of its cotton yarn produced in Uzbekistan to Europe, South America, Far East and Canada.

 The acquisition is the first foreign direct investment by an Indian company in Uzbekistan.

 The acquisition is in line with our inorganic growth strategy. With proximity to east European markets and availability of quality cotton locally, it makes strategic sense for us to be present in Uzbekistan. We will also benefit from low labour and power costs, Choudhary said.

 Uzbekistan is the second largest exporter of cotton globally and the fifth largest producer after China, the US, India and Pakistan. 

 The country exports nearly 80 per cent of its produce.

 Sources said Spentex is also actively considering an acquisition of another state-owned company in Egypt. 

 Confirming this, Choudhary said, It now depends on how soon the government of Egypt can process things.

 Spentex, which took over Indo Rama Textiles and Amit Spinning Industries earlier this year, is looking at acquisitions both at home and abroad.

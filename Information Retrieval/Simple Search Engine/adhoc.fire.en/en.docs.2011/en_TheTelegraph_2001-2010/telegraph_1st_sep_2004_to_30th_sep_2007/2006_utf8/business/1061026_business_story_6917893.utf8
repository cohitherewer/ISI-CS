 Calcutta, Oct. 25: Usha Martin is aiming at nearly three-fold increase in its topline at Rs 5,000 crore as it expands its capacity in speciality steel and value-added products such as bars, wire and wire rope.

 The wire rope manufacturer has planned an outlay of Rs 1,300 crore in the next three-and-a-half years to reach this target, managing director Rajeev Jhawar said.

 After the expansion, speciality steel production will reach 1 million tonnes and value-added products 400,000 tonnes.

 The new capacities will be added in phases so as not to stretch the companys balance sheet.

 Moreover, the extra capacity will not come all at a time in the market so that the latter can absorb it, Jhawar said.

 Usha Martin will fund the project with Rs 500 crore of debt and Rs 800 crore of equity and internal accruals.

 The company has already raised Rs 200 crore through global depository receipts and a placement to promoters.

 Debt worth Rs 475 crore has also been tied up, Jhawar said, adding that generating Rs 600 crore will not be difficult.

 The company has started captive mining of iron ore and expects to soon meet all its ore requirements through the captive route.

 It has also been allotted coal mine blocks and expects to start mining in six months.

 With a captive power plant coming up, Usha Martin will have complete control over its raw materials, leading to expansion of operating margin from 20 to 30 per cent in future.

 To increase production of value-added steel in India, the company has acquired 10 acres in Chennai to set up a bright bar manufacturing plant that would go on production in two years from now. 

 This necessitates an investment of Rs 25 crore.

 Profit up

 The company has posted a 49.7 per cent jump in net profit on consolidated basis in the first half to Rs 58.2 crore from Rs 38.87 crore. 

 Net sales grew by 18.6 per cent to Rs 985 crore from Rs 830 crore.

 On a standalone basis, net profit in the second quarter grew 60 per cent to Rs 23.72 crore from Rs 14.85 crore. 

 In the same period, net sales grew by 19 per cent to Rs 351.45 crore from Rs 295.35 crore in the same period last year.

 Calcutta, Aug. 14: Tata Steel is scouting for mining opportunities in manganese in South Africa, which has about 80 per cent of the worlds economically mineable ore reserves.

 The company is also looking at opportunities in coal and chrome mining.

 The greenfield project would require an investment of $120 million.

 We have been allocated land for our ferro chrome project in Richards Bay a port in South Africa. We have also got the environmental clearance from the South African government. We are looking at extending opportunities to other mining activities in manganese and coal, said P. Roy, executive in charge, ferro alloys and minerals, Tata Steel.

 The ferro chrome project will be flagged off on August 21, while commercial production will start between October and December 2007.

 The plant will make high carbon ferro chrome with a chrome content of more than 64 per cent and will have a capacity of 134,500 metric tonnes per annum during the first phase.

 The project will see participation of Tata Steel and Tata Africa, the groups holding company in South Africa, on a 90:10 basis.

 The project involves taking high-quality chrome ore from India and converting it into ferro chrome in Richards Bay and exporting the finished product to customers worldwide.

 South Africa is the worlds largest producer of ferro chrome, accounting for more than 55 per cent of the total production. It has 12 billion tonnes of mineable manganese reserves. While the tonnage might be higher in China and Ukraine, the metal content is lower than the ore produced by South Africa.

 Cheap electricity, coupled with South Africas expertise in technical and marketing dominance, makes it a lucrative proposition, Ray added.

 Four companies dominate the South African manganese production Samancor, Assmang, Vanadium and Highveld Steel. 

 Around 40 per cent of the production is exported to ferro alloy producers while the remaining is converted to alloys and manganese metal which are then exported.

 Fringe tax blunts export edge

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 14: Commerce and industry minister Kamal Nath has informed finance minister P. Chidambaram that the fringe benefit tax (FBT) and the service tax were having an adverse impact on Indias export competitiveness. 

 The minister had taken up the issue as part of the pre-budget discussions following complaints from exporters that the imposition of FBT on sales promotion tours and free sale samples were affecting marketing of Indian products. 

 Exporters consider such tours crucial for diversifying their product base and venturing into new markets. 

 The minister has also asked the high-level board of trade, headed by prominent industrialist Kumar Mangalam Birla, to provide suggestions for the forthcoming budget as well as the annual supplement of the foreign trade policy to be announced in March this year. 

 He has received the reports of the study groups set up last year by the board of trade. He has asked the board to narrow down the recommendations to three or four issues that have a major impact on exports.

 The minister has promised that the recommendations would be finalised soon and sent to the relevant departments for speedy implementation within a definite time-frame.

 He has also come out in favour of revamping the target plus incentive scheme for exporters to make it more focused and ensure that the scheme actually fulfiled its objectives.

 SBI to feed credit with big bond offer

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, June 8: To meet the robust credit demand, the State Bank of India will issue close to Rs 2,000 crore of bonds this fiscal.

 The country?s largest bank today informed stock exchanges that its board has approved the raising of unsecured and rated rupee subordinated/upper tier II bonds not exceeding Rs 2,000 crore during this fiscal. 

 The bonds will be issued in tranches with a mini- mum maturity of over 60 months. 

 These bonds may be issued either by private placement or through book-building, the bank added.

 Subordinated bonds are repaid after other loan obligations of the issuer have been met. It, therefore, commands a higher interest rate.

 Earlier this year, previous SBI chairman A.K. Purwar said the bank would raise Rs 2,000 crore through a subordinated debt issue. 

 He said the bank was looking at raising resources through new instruments such as hybrid capital, which is likely to be floated by the end of 2006-07.

 The bank had raised close to Rs 3,300 crore through a subordinated debt issue in December last year to meet demand for credit. 

 As credit requirement of firms and other borrowers are on the rise, the bank has drawn up plans for another issue.

 In January, the Reserve Bank announced guidelines to enable banks raise funds through additional instruments such as innovative perpetual debt instruments eligible for inclusion as tier 1 capital, and debt capital instruments eligible for inclusion as upper tier II capital. 

 This would help banks raise additional funds to meet both credit requirements and Basel II norms, which would be implemented from March 2007. 

 The central bank had said banks could issue upper tier II instruments in the Indian currency. 

 However, they will have to obtain prior approval from the RBI on a case-to-case basis for issuing upper tier II instruments in foreign currency.

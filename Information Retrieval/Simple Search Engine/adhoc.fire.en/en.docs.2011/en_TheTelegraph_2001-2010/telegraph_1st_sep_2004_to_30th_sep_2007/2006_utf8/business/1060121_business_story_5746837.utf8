 Calcutta, Jan. 20: United Bank of India (UBI) has written off bad loans worth Rs 38 crore from its books to bring down its gross non-performing assets (NPAs) by 2 per cent. However, the net NPA ? another measure of asset quality ? during the reporting period dipped marginally to 2.19 per cent of net advances from 2.45 per cent.

 Gross non-performing assets as a percentage of gross advances is considered an indicator of a bank?s asset quality. For the nine months ended December 2005, the bank has shown an impressive cut in gross NPA to 4.83 per cent from 6.76 per cent during the corresponding previous period. 

 ?We wrote off sticky loans of small magnitude from our books last month,? said P.K. Gupta, chairman of United Bank of India. 

 ?Last year, the finance ministry permitted scheduled banks to write off bad loans of small magnitude ? up to Rs 50,000 ? and we took this opportunity to clean up our sticky assets by Rs 38 crore,? he added.

 However, the bank has recovered bad loans worth Rs 185 crore during the nine months compared with Rs 82 crore in the year-ago period. This was reflected in the net NPA improvement. The city-based bank, which had an accumulated loss of Rs 278 crore till March 2005, hopes to wipe it out by the end of the current fiscal. ?For the nine months of 2005-06, we have earned a net profit of Rs 175.42 crore (Rs 165.97 crore in the year-ago period). We are left with only Rs 100 crore to make up during the remaining three months. Hopefully, we will be able to wipe out the losses by March 2006 and be back in the black next financial year,? he said.

 The bank also plans to come out with a bond issue to raise tier II capital up to Rs 300 crore out of the Rs 425 crore it is entitled to. ?We will take a final call on this after reviewing our asset-liability positions. At the end of December, we had a capital adequacy ratio (CAR) of 15.6 per cent against 15.08 per cent in December 2004. So, we are comfortably placed,? said Gupta. 

 However, the bank?s CAR has declined from over 18 per cent as on March 2005 to the present level. ?This was because of an unprecedented growth in advances,? the chairman said. The bank?s total advances between April and December grew 34.91 per cent to Rs 14,256 crore from Rs 10,567 crore in the year-ago period. Deposits increased 14.8 per cent to Rs 27,324 crore from Rs 23,803 crore.

 These figures show the bank?s asset size does not match its liabilities. ?But that is not going to pose any problem for us as our CAR is quite high. If need be, we can liquidate our SLR position, which, at present, stands at 39 per cent ? almost 14 per cent higher than the required 25 per cent,? Gupta explained.

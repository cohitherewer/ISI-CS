 ONGC-Mittal steps on the gas in Nigeria

 S.P.S. PANNU

 In full steam

 New Delhi, July 9: To be viable in Nigeria, the ONGC-Mittal combine will have to produce half-a-million to one million barrels of crude daily from two blocks.

 ONGC-Videsh managing director R.S. Butola told The Telegraph that given the quantum of investments in the project, we will have to produce at least 500,000 to 1 million barrels of oil per day to make it viable.

 While the upfront fee for exploration has been kept low, the Nigerian government expects the oil firms to invest in power, railways and downstream oil refinery.

 About $6 billion will be invested in phases, to be calibrated with the hydrocarbon potential of the exploration block. The investment schedule is dependent on the quantity of oil produced from the fields.

 Butola said after the legal formalities for acquiring the blocks are over, the company would scout for a deepwater rig for drilling. There is currently a scarcity of rigs in the international market and hiring one could take time.

 Otherwise the blocks are ready for drilling operations as all the seismic surveys have been completed. The geological data indicates that the two blocks have a rich potential, he added.

 There could be some delay in finding a rig as there is a shortage of such rigs for deepwater areas 

 The rigs are also in demand as global majors have stepped up the hunt for oil due to the crude price rally.

 The Nigerian government is awarding exploration blocks in lieu of investments as it faced flak for failing to alleviate poverty despite huge oil finds. 

 The army has also been deployed to thwart plans of rebels to disrupt operations of oil companies.

 The rebels consider the companies as allies of the government and have often resorted to kidnappings of personnel.

 OVL sources said Nigeria has put up for bidding another 14 blocks, besides the 60 that are on sale. Blocks have also been withdrawn from multinational operators such as Shell, Chevron, and Total.

 The listed blocks are intended to encourage investors to build power plants and set up downstream facilities.

 A number of blocks will be offered as part of a deal to privatise the Kaduna refinery, a project in which a Chinese consortium has shown an interest.

 Denim makers seek to beat sales lull

 Mumbai, Sept. 17: Domestic denim manufacturers are looking at a clutch of other options besides selling the fabric itself to counter the challenges prevailing in the industry.

 Amid softening prices and excess of production, the players are re-orienting their strategies to overcome the business cycles the industry is known for. While manufacturers are either tapping the booming retail sector to ramp up sales, enhancing their own footprint or focussing more on jeans, there are other strategies being adopted. 

 Raymond Ltd has tied up with a European firm and Arvind Mills is also understood to be exploring a few other options. On the other hand, KG Denim is firming up plans to open 200 exclusive retail showrooms in the country. Others in the industry are looking branding. 

 The manufacturers are making these moves after suffering six months of difficulty in the industry. Even as capacities went up, the fabric was not much in demand, affecting not only sales, but realisations as well. During the first quarter of this fiscal, Arvind Mills saw double digit decline in both volumes and realisations. 

 It is evident that apart from selling only the basic variety of the denim fabric, value addition and getting closer to the consumer has become the buzzword. These initiatives are taking various forms. While some are concentrating more on garments, others are looking to have a wider presence both in India and abroad. 

 The extent of a price crash in value-added fabrics is much less than in the basic fabric. Market circles say that Arvind Mills, which has the capacity to produce 110 million metres per annum, is aiming to convert the denim into jeans on a much larger scale. The Ahmedabad-based company is understood to be eyeing Indias retail sector to market these jeans as private labels.

 Unconfirmed reports also say that the company is looking to relocate a part of its denim capacity in countries where there is a huge demand and open services that could be used by brands in the industry itself. On the other hand, Raymond Ltd joined hands with UCO NV, a European denim company. The 50:50 joint venture company, known as Raymond UCO Denim Pvt Ltd, having its executive headquarters in Belgium, will be engaged in manufacturing and marketing of denim fabrics.

 The entity will have manufacturing facilities spread across the US, Europe and Asia with a combined fabric capacity of 80 million metres and a vast global marketing network. 

 Similarly, the Coimbatore-based KG Denim, which supplies to well known brands such as Lee Cooper and Zara, is looking at an extensive footprint as one of the options. It proposes to open 200 exclusive retail showrooms in the country.

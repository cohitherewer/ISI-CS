 Domestic power at differential rates

 Calcutta, July 11: Differential power tariff for households may become a reality shortly, if the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) has its way.

 Under such a scheme, consumers will have to pay a higher tariff during peak hours, while the rates will be less during the off-peak period.

 The concept, which is prevalent in long distance telephony like STD, is in practice for high-tension (HT) consumers in the commercial and industrial sectors.

 ?We are planning to introduce this scheme in at least two states on a pilot basis,? Ashok Basu, chairman of CERC, said.

 Speaking at an interactive meeting organised by the Merchants? Chamber of Commerce (MCC) today, Basu said CERC hoped to introduce the scheme in all states in the next two years.

 ?The idea is to balance the load. There will be an incentive for consumers to use less power during the peak period,? he added.

 India has about 125,000 mega watt of installed power generation capacity, but the peak period deficit is 12 per cent.

 So far 16 states, including Bengal, have introduced ToD (time of day) tariff for high tension consumers.

 The biggest roadblock for introducing this system is that the existing meters would have to be changed.

 Basu said special meters have to be installed to record differential use within a day. This would entail sizeable investment, which distribution companies may be wary of doing.

 In the ToD system, a day could be divided into three or four periods, depending upon the demand.

 Cheapest power could be available during the night, between 10 pm and 6 am. Evenings generally witness highest demand and the tariff could be steepest during that time. The day-time tariff could be in between the two. 

 Once this method is implemented, a consumer could actually lower his bill by intelligently consuming power, experts said.

 Multi-year tariff

 CERC is also proposing to introduce a multi-year tariff fixation practice in the states.

 Under this formula, the state electricity regulatory commission would announce a tariff for at least five years. 

 Distribution companies would not have to come to SERC every year for tariff fixation. ?A set formula could be introduced that will take care of variables like fuel cost in the interim period. They do not have to come to SERC for this,? Basu added.

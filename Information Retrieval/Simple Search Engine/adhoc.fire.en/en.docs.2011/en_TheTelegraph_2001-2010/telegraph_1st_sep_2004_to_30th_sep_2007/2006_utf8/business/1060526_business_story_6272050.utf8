 Coal mines on buy list

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 Jain: On the prowl

New Delhi, May 25: The Steel Authority of India 

is planning to acquire two coal mines in Russia and Australia. 

 We are looking at the two mines that have been offered to us. We will see if the coal is suitable. It has to mesh with our coal requirements, SAIL chairman V.S. Jain told The Telegraph. 

 We could be equity partners in such coal projects or take up a position jointly with Coal India or Rashtriya Ispat Nigam, he said. The only condition is it has to be very good grade of coal, he added. 

 SAIL has been scouting for equity in overseas mines ever since its long-term supplies from Australia were hit two years back. With coal prices rising, the steel-maker needs to ensure quality coal supplies. 

 Earlier, SAIL had decided not to pick up stakes in Australian mine Tahmoor and Indonesian mine Maruwai, as the due diligence study revealed that they did not have significant reserves. A tentative tie-up with BHP for this is likely to fizzle out.

 SAIL had also looked at other Russian and Polish mines, but they did not meet the requirement.

 Jain said SAIL was still keen on a merger with RINL and Manganese Ore India Ltd, but the government has to take a call on this. 

 Both SAIL and the government feel that RINL should be merged with SAIL to create a larger behemoth. However, local political opposition has stymied the plans till now. 

The new entity, if created, would have a combined 

crude steel production of 16.2 million tonnes.

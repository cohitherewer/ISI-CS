 McLeod Russel to retire high-cost debt

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Khaitan: Fund raiser

 Calcutta, July 19: McLeod Russel India Ltd is planning to raise up to $30 million through global depository receipts or private placement of equity shares.

 The board will consider the proposal at its meeting scheduled for July 27.

 We will seek the boards approval for various modes of financing up to an amount of $30 million. After the boards approval, we will seek the same from shareholders. The money will be utilised towards retiring debts, said Aditya Khaitan, managing director, McLeod Russel India Ltd.

 The decision to opt for GDR or a private placement of shares will be taken after the approvals come through.

 Earlier, the company said it wanted to reduce the debt burden by Rs 150 crore this fiscal.

 McLeod Russel posted a profit after tax of Rs 23 crore for the fiscal ended March 31, 2006 against a loss of Rs 20 crore in the previous year. Turnover rose to Rs 512 crore from Rs 320 crore in 2004-05.

 The 2005-06 numbers reflect the consolidated figures of McLeod Russel and Williamson Tea, which was merged with the company under the scheme of amalgamation.

 McLeod Russels interest burden stood at Rs 475 crore as on March 31, 2006. The yearly interest cost for the company is Rs 45 crore.

 For acquiring Williamson Tea, McLeod Russel had borrowed Rs 180 crore from ICICI Bank to be repaid in 10 years and Rs 18 crore from IL amp;FS for acquiring the Doom Dooma gardens from Hindustan Lever.

 Doom Dooma was acquired in January for Rs 70 crore. Out of this, McLeod Russel will pay Rs 51 crore to HLL in the course of the next three years.

 In keeping with its earlier strategy of servicing debt through sale of investments in companies like McNally Bharat and Kilburn Chemicals, McLeod Russel had also utilised Rs 8 crore proceeds from the sale of shares in Eveready and India Foils to reduce the debt burden.

 McLeods exports, which stood at 22 million kg in 2005-06, is expected to go up to 25 million kg this fiscal. This includes 1 million kg set aside for Pakistan, following the Pakistan Tea Associations recent visit to India and their interest in north Indian tea.

 McLeod, which produces around 70 million kg annually, expects the crop to be down by 1 million kg this fiscal and it aspires to become a 100-million kg company in the next couple of years.

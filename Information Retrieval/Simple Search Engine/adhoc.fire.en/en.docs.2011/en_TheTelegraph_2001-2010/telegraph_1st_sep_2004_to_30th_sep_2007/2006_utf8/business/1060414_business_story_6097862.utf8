 New Delhi, April 13: Maruti Udyog Limited, the country?s largest car manufacturer, will buy Suzukis 30 per cent equity in the joint venture, Maruti Suzuki Automobile India Limited (MSAIL), and then merge the high-end carmaker with itself.

 Maruti, which is setting up a second manufacturing facility in Haryana, would undertake the merger to realise the synergies at the operational and management level between the two companies, MUL managing director Jagdish Khattar said. 

 The directors of Maruti met today and agreed on the merger, which will be implemented retrospectively from April 1, 2006.

 In MSAIL, Maruti holds a 70 per cent stake, while Suzuki Motor Corporation holds the remaining 30 per cent.

 Khattar said the merger procedures would be completed by September, before Maruti starts operations from its new facility. He, however, refused to disclose details of the terms and conditions of the deal.

 Built at an investment of Rs 1,524.2 crore, the new plant will have a capacity of 1 lakh units to be scaled up to 2.5 lakh units by 2008-09. Commercial production will start by the end of this calendar year.

 To arrive at the price of Suzukis stake in MSAIL, which has a paid-up capital of Rs 40 crore, a five-member panel will examine the financial, legal and company law implications of the merger.

 ?The merger of MSAIL and MUL will create value for all stakeholders. It will retain all the benefits of the earlier arrangement and enable the management to focus on critical issues of business operation,? said Maruti chairman S. Nakanishi.

 The merger will transfer the debts of MSAIL to the books of Maruti, but Khattar said this would not affect the profitability of the car major.

 MSAIL has raised funds through a syndicated loan organised by the Japan Bank for International Cooperation.

 Khattar said there would be some change in the debt-equity ratio of Maruti after the merger due to the transfer of MSAIL?s debts into its books.

 On a query of a similar merger involving the other joint venture between Suzuki and Maruti ? Suzuki Powertrain ? Khattar said there was no such proposal. ?That is a different joint venture and will see Suzuki manufacturing diesel engines under licence from Fiat, including for foreign markets,? he said.

 Marutis share price, which opened at Rs 841 on BSE, dipped to Rs 814 before the merger news propped the scrip to Rs 881.85. It closed at Rs 870.05, up 3.41 per cent.

 RPG to spread retail cheer in the east

 ARUNDHATI BAKSHI-DIGHE

 Mumbai, April 7: The RPG group will bring Spencer, its retailing brand, to Calcutta by the year-end. 

 The group has drawn up a grand retailing plan for eastern India. It has acquired close to 200,000 sq feet in the region, including Orissa, Bihar and Jharkhand. 

 The company plans to open four stores in Calcutta. It also plans to open stores in Durgapur by August. The format will be both hypermarket and super market. 

 We will focus on the key towns in the eastern zone, with the initial focus being on Calcutta, J.H. Mehta, president of Spencers Retail, told The Telegraph. The company plans to start with hyper and super markets followed by the daily formats. 

 The former FoodWorld outlets are now called Spencers Daily. The hypermarket is a large format store. 

 quot;We have already signed up locations adding up to over 200,000 sq feet in the eastern region. More locations will be tied up as we go. Normative costs are in the region of Rs 1,500 per square feet, quot; he added, but refused to divulge actual investment figures. 

 The biggest of the four stores planned for Calcutta will come up at the South City Mall. The others will be spread across the city, including one near the Rashbehari Avenue and the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass. 

 The company also plans to open five stores in New Delhi. The Spencer brand is present in the western Mumbai suburb of Malad and Kandivli, and in Ghaziabad, near Delhi. 

 RPG Retail has recently revived the Spencers brand name for its retail formats. The renaming started with the former FoodWorld outlets being called Spencer Daily. The company has retained 49 of the 93 Foodworld outlets and plans to have four retail formats called Spencers Hyper, Spencers Super, Spencers Daily and Spencers Fresh, which will cater to different customers. Spencers first store opened in Hyderabad in June 2001. 

 RPG Enterprises comprises more than 20 companies spanning seven business sectors ? retail, technology, entertainment, power, transmission, tyres and specialities.

 Calcutta, Jan. 17: Punjab National Bank (PNB) will phase out its low-yielding loans to improve its net interest margin.

 The banks low-yielding advances primarily comprise corporate loans. Banks, in general, lend money to blue-chip and top-rung companies at less than their prime lending rates (PLR).

 With the spread between interest rates on deposits and lending narrowing down, the bank is now feeling the pinch of lending to highly rated companies at sub-PLR. 

 We will phase out our low-yielding loans across all sectors ? agriculture, retail and corporate, Punjab National Bank chairman and managing director S.C. Gupta said.

 Agreeing that the low-yielding loans are the highest in the corporate sector, Gupta said, Be it a AAA rated or a AA rated company ? it doesnt matter much. The credit risk is more or less the same. We will stop lending at low rates.

 The banks net interest margin has improved from 3.87 per cent on March 31 last year to 3.99 per cent on September 30. During the same period, average yield on loans improved to 8.37 per cent from 8.12 per cent.

 The bank is also undergoing organisational restructuring whereby seven of its regional offices have been moved to a three-tier system from an earlier four-tier one. The bank has created seven zonal offices ? North Delhi, North Punjab, J amp;K, Northeast, Orissa, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka ? which were earlier an integral part of one or the other zonal offices. These new zonal offices will now have more decision-making autonomy and hence will be able to generate more business for the bank, said Gupta. We expect an additional Rs 2-3 crore business coming from these centres before March 2006, he added.

 Punjab National Bank, which has clocked a total business of Rs 1,73,282 crore for the first six months of the current fiscal, hopes to surpass the Rs 2-lakh-crore mark by March 2006. The bank will also open four overseas branches during this calendar, said Gupta. We have got the approval of the RBI to set up full-fledged branches in Singapore and Hong Kong, a subsidiary in Canada and converting our representative office in the UK into a subsidiary, he added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Running out of steam

 Sensex may be surging, but returns on equity mutual funds won?t be more than 15%, says Chandralekha Tulal 

 The stated or non-stated objective of any diversified equity fund is to beat the market indices.

 In 2003, arguably the Year of the Bull, the equity funds posted phenomenal triple-digit average returns of 111.35 per cent. In contrast, the indicative index ? sensex ? rose 72.79 per cent, while the nifty increased by 71.9 per cent. In the comprehensive annual rankings of mutual funds by Value Research, even the worst performing equity fund posted a return of 65.46 per cent, while the best of them gave 177.13 per cent.

 In 2004, the bull ran out of breath and the sensex rose a moderate 13.08 per cent during the year, while nifty yielded 10.68 per cent. Equity funds posted an average return of 25.78 per cent, with the best fund paying out 68.59 per cent.

 In 2005, the equity funds have struggled to stay just ahead of the sensex: the average returns hovered at 44.5 per cent compared with 40.21 per cent posted by the sensex. However, the best fund gave returns of 78.37 per cent.

 Broken promises 

 So, what happened to the sterling performances posted by the mutual funds, their claims of professional fund management and unspoken vows of beating the market? 

 Says A.K. Sridhar, chief investment officer of UTI Mutual Fund, ?Compared with previous years, the market has become more matured. In the earlier years, there were numerous undervalued stocks, which were handpicked by fewer players. But now, with larger players and lesser reasonably valued stocks, it will be difficult for mutual funds to beat the market indices.?

 ?The superior performance posted by the funds in the earlier years was mostly due to the turnaround from lower levels and significant concentration in the midcap stocks, which posted phenomenal returns. However, this major mid-cap movement was not captured by the large-cap constituent sensex and nifty and thus the returns posted by the funds showed a substantial difference,? Value Research CEO Dhirendra Kumar said. 

 ?In contrast, the secular mid-cap uptrend was broken during the recent phase of market correction and has not recovered since then. Most of the upsurge has come about in large-cap stocks. However, since most funds still have sufficiently large exposure to mid-cap stocks, the return differential with large-cap sensex and nifty has paled,? he added. 

 Peep into the future

 Should we now stop expecting the diversified mutual funds to beat the market returns? 

 ?With the sophistication achieved by the markets and the near perfect nature, the diversified funds will be in a position to beat the market returns for another two years or so. The funds would, on an average, provide 10 to 12 per cent more returns than the indices,? said Sridhar. 

 Keeping in mind the higher expense ratio charged by these funds compared with the index funds, does it make more sense now to invest in the latter? 

 ?The issue of higher expense ratio has not yet become so significant with the funds continuing to post superior double-digit returns. Over the next 2-3 years, only equities will post higher returns than any other investment class and will give at least 2-3 times more returns than the debt market,? added Sridhar. 

 ?However, after a couple of years, it will become difficult to outperform the market and the question of expense ratios would start creeping in. Then, investing in index funds might make more sense,? he added. 

 ?Keeping that in mind, the fund houses, at least the larger ones, will aggressively market their existing schemes in contrast with the recent phenomenon to raise funds through new fund offers to keep a check on the high initial expenses vis a vis high return expectations,? he added. 

 So, what is the outlook for the coming year? 

 ?The outlook does not seem too bright for 2006,? says Kumar. ?It will become increasingly difficult to post superlative returns after three consecutive years of huge surges,? he adds. ?Investors should have moderate expectations from the equity funds and should not expect to make easy money as they did even this year,? Kumar said. 

 The expected returns for the year should be a conservative 10 to 12 per cent, says Kumar. Sridhar, however, is a bit more optimistic and asks investors to expect returns of three times the inflation figure from the equity funds. So, with inflation hovering around 5 per cent, the expected returns should be about 15 per cent.

 MphasiS yes for EDS offer

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Rao: The right choice

 Mumbai, April 4: The MphasiS BFL board today put its stamp of approval on EDS?s $380-million conditional offer to acquire a 52 per cent stake in the technology services company, but the market beat down the stock which tumbled almost Rs 4 to close at Rs 211.90.

 The MphasiS BFL board met in Delhi this morning. Directors who missed the meeting gave their approval by phone. Later, Jerry Rao, CEO and chairman of MphasiS, said in a statement: ?We support this transaction and look forward to its successful closure. We are excited about the opportunities for growth and the potential for enhancing our customer offerings.?

 The board added in a statement: ?The board of MphasiS has taken note of the offer from EDS and sees it as a positive endorsement of the company?s strengths and welcomes EDS?s interest. The board will support fully whatever action the shareholders take with respect to this offer.? 

 ?This offer is complementary to our overall strategy to enhance EDS?s presence and capabilities in India,? said company chairman and chief executive officer Mike Jordan. 

 But the market reacted with disdain. ?Institutional investors feel the rate offered by EDS is not high. I am sure EDS will be looking forward to re-negotiating with investors,? said a market analyst. 

 Industry insiders say EDS has made an open offer both to the market and the promoters in general, unlike the i-flex-Oracle deal where Oracle had already bought out the promoters? stake and then made an open offer, giving all the stakeholders a say in future revision of the offer. 

 The market expects close to a 5 per cent revision of the offer price. ?But it may be too premature to predict right now. The share prices, as you can see, have actually come down,?? sources said. 

 EDS has already said the deal is conditional on its acquiring 83 million shares, representing approximately 52 per cent of the outstanding MphasiS shares, and that it hopes to close the deal in the third quarter of this calendar year. According to reports, EDS has issued a newspaper advertisement which says it retained the right to revise the offer price or the number of shares till June 1.

 ?We expect the revised price to be near the Rs 225 levels,? said an analyst. The market does not see any new factors supporting a higher share price. The MphasiS results, to be announced on April 11, are expected to be average.

 CEOs see over 8.5% growth

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 15: India Inc expects growth to cross 8.5 per cent this fiscal, backed by strong corporate earnings and a good performance in industrial production. 

 Nearly 77 per cent of the 250 CEOs surveyed by industry chamber Assocham are certain that Indias GDP will cross 8.5 per cent this fiscal.

 However, 18 per cent of those polled feel it is difficult to sustain an over 8 per cent growth as agriculture has not performed very well. Against a 3.9 per cent growth registered in the last financial year, growth in the farming sector may not exceed 3 per cent this year owing to late sowing of kharif crops and the rub-off impact on the rabi crops, said the survey. 

 Industry, which has a 26.1 per cent weightage in the GDP, has, however, shown an impressive performance in the first six months of the current fiscal.

 The index of industrial production went up by 10.9 per cent in the April-September period compared with 8.5 per cent in the corresponding period last year. The manufacturing sector topped the table with a 12.1 per cent growth.

 Industrial growth figures for the first six months make us share the optimism of the RBI and the IMF. We are a little ambitious and are projecting growth at 8.5 per cent for the current year, said Assocham president Anil Agarwal.

 TCG accuses Bengal of hiding facts

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 4: The Chatterjee Group (TCG) today reiterated that the Bengal government had suppressed facts regarding transfer of shares in Haldia Petrochemicals Ltd (HPL) to Indian Oil Corporation (IOC).

 The counsel for the group told the Company Law Board, The allotment of shares to IOC was done through suppression of facts and was against the expectations of my client. 

 TCG wants the allotment of shares to IOC cancelled. The hearing will continue tomorrow.

 The counsel said by transferring the shares to IOC, HPL would become a government-owned company, and TCG, which is the majority shareholder, would be reduced to a minority.

 IOC has been allotted a 7.5 per cent stake in HPL for Rs 150 crore.

 We were completely in the dark regarding the so-called arrangement between IOC and HPL management over the share transfer agreement, the TCG counsel said.

 It alleged that the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation (WBIDC) had allotted shares worth Rs 150 crore to IOC without taking the Purnendu Chaterjee-headed TCG into confidence.

 The IOC board accepted the proposal of share transfer on September 24 ? the same day that it was passed by the HPL board.

 Later, Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee also assured Chaterjee that IOCs role would be limited to a portfolio investor only and IOCs holding would be restricted to only Rs 150 crore worth of shares, the counsel said.

 TCG alleged that the share transfer was done in the minimum possible time and no due diligence was carried out by IOC before accepting the shares.

 We were not even given an opportunity to see the draft prepared to transfer the refinerys share, alleged the counsel, adding that the board was misled by the HPL management.

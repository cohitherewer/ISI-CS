 New Delhi, June 7: Advertising revenues are expected to shoot up by 8-15 per cent this fiscal as the world gears up for the FIFA World Cup 2006 football tournament, which is barely two days away.

 Leading Indian web portals and mobile service providers are beefing up their football content to attract football-crazy customers and advertisers for the world cup event. 

 The Indian arm of leading website Yahoo, one of the official sponsors of the World Cup, expects up to 32 million surfers to lap up 4 billion pages of FIFA news and trivia. 

 Pearl Uppal, director (sales) at Yahoo! India, said, We see high engagement of our users with Yahoo! India Sports and expect sizeable online advertising for the soccer world cup.

 Industry sources said large companies have shown interest in advertising on the websites during the event. They have estimated the ad spending on TV and Internet to be over Rs 100 crore.

 In its world cup special, web portal Sify would be offering special features like live text scores, match highlights, videos from the venue, image galleries, football match archives since 1932, pages on teams and players, past tournaments and preparations. They would also carry news reports, contests, best of blogs and video-based quiz. 

 Mobile service providers are also gearing up to reap in from the opportunities thrown up by the World Cup.

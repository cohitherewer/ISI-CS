 FIPB clears Lladros retail plan

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 6: The Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) has cleared Spanish porcelain maker Lladros application for opening retail boutiques in India. 

 Lladros proposal is for a joint venture to open retail boutiques to sell products under its brand in India. Lladro will hold a 24 per cent stake in the venture, while the rest would be with its Indian distributor, Spa Agencies. 

 The venture would be called Lladro India and invest around Rs 22.5 crore to set up retail boutiques. The Spanish company, however, has the option to increase its stakeholding to 49 per cent by 2009.

 The proposal of Lladro would now have to be approved by the finance minister.

 With the FIPB approval to Lladro, the number of cases where FDI has been allowed in the retail sector has gone up to three. The board, however, did not give a go-ahead to UK-based Alpha Airports proposal for entering the airport retail segment.

 Alpha Airports, which had applied for setting up a fully owned subsidiary to carry out retail activities at airports has not got the boards nod, official sources said.

 Airbus deal with IA takes off

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, Feb. 20: Indian Airlines today signed a $2-billion deal with French aviation company Airbus Industrie to purchase 43 aircraft to replace its ageing fleet.

 The agreement was signed by Kiran Rao, Airbus vice-president (marketing and contracts), and Indian Airlines chairman V. Trivedi in the presence of French President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.

 Under the agreement, the first aircraft will be supplied in October or early November and all the planes will be delivered by the middle of 2010, Rao said. Among the planes to be delivered are 19 A-319 jets, four A-320s and 20 A-321s.

 The acquisition of 43 aircraft of the A320 family will allow Indian Airlines to step up growth and modernisation, expand its market and improve the quality of its product offering, said Trivedi.

 The board of Indian Airlines had cleared the proposal to buy the aircraft in April 2002, although the government approved the proposal only in September 2005 after several rounds of discussions and price negotiations.

 Bilateral trade

 The French President, who earlier met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, said, the two countries have decided to double bilateral trade over the next five years. This may seem audacious, but it is realistic, he added. 

 Chirac also assured India of full support from France in developing its economic infrastructure. He upheld the investments of Saint-Gobain and Lafarge in India.

 The internationally recognised expertise of Veolia and Suez is also mobilised to contribute to the progress that you (India) are expecting in urban planning, water and waste management, the President added. Our main operators and equipment manufacturers are ready to join in your efforts to secure energy requirements, he said.

 Meanwhile, commerce minister Kamal Nath has also set a target of a billion-dollar sustained foreign direct investment from France annually. Inviting investment from French companies, the minister said, There is tremendous scope for co-operation in infrastructure ? roads, ports and energy.

 Nath said he is looking forward to the next meeting of the India-France joint committee in May, which he will co-chair with Christine Lagarde, French minister for international trade.

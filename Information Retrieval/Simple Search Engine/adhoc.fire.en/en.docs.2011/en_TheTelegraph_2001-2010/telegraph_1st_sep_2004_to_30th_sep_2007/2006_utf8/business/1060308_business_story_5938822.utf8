 Tata Steel goes abroad for funds

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Strong base

 Calcutta, March 7: Tata Steel will raise $500 million or close to Rs 2,250 crore through the external commercial borrowing (ECB) route to fund its growth projects and acquisition plans.

 The company today signed an agreement in Singapore to this effect.

 The ECB would comprise Japanese yen equivalent of $495 million and $5 million in dollars.

 The syndicated term loan facility was for $400 million (or its equivalent in yen) with a greenshoe option of $100 million (or its equivalent in yen).

 The issue was oversubscribed and the company decided to exercise the greenshoe option. The loan has a maturity of seven years and 17 banks participated in the loan facility. There are nine main lead arrangers and key banks are Standard Chartered /Calvon and HSBC.

 The coupon of the loan will be London inter-bank offer rate (Libor) plus 45 basis points. Tata Steel borrowed in Japanese yen, as the cost of funding of Japanese loan is lower than the other sources of funding.

 Last year, the company had passed a special resolution to raise up to Rs 5,000 crore to meet its long-term capital requirement.

 The ECB money is over and above the $300-million loan it raised from the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the private sector arm of the World Bank.

 Tata Steels appetite for fresh funds is understandable given its ambitious expansion plans.

 The company plans to raise its steel production capacity to 15 million tonnes (mt) by 2010 and to 30 mt by 2015. It is also eyeing acquisitions of raw material sources like coking coal mines abroad.

 The company now has a total steel making capacity of 8.7 mt after the latest acquisition in Thailand.

 It now has a 5-mt steel mill at Jamshedpur, 2-mt capacity at Natsteel in Singapore and 1.7-mt at Millennium Steel in Thailand.

 It is expanding capacity at the Jamshedpur works to 6.8 mt and setting up greenfield steel plants at Orissa, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand. It is also planning steel projects in Bangladesh and Iran. 

 The Tata Steel stock closed at Rs 468.30, down by Rs 5 or 1.06 per cent from its previous close, on the National Stock Exchange.

 Sick LML set to get admitted to BIFR

 Bumpy ride

 New Delhi, Sept. 8 (Agencies): Dogged by prolonged lockout of its manufacturing unit and inability to make a turnaround, LML, the Kanpur-based two-wheeler manufacturer, today declared itself a sick unit.

 The board of directors of LML, which met today and approved the audited accounts of the company for the period April 1, 2005 to August 31, 2006, has decided to refer the company to the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR).

 The company has informed the Bombay Stock Exchange that after taking into consideration the continued lock-out of two-wheeler operations and the present prevailing condition, coupled with the uncertainty of generation of profits in near future, the board has decided to reverse the provision of deferred tax asset (DTA).

 As a result, the net worth of the company as on August 31, 2006 has been completely eroded and consequently it has become a sick industrial unit under the Sick Industrial Companies (special provisions) Act, 1985, it said.

 Company officials, including managing director Deepak Singhania, were not available for comment despite repeated attempts.

 LML, which sold once-successful models like 100 cc Freedom, had completed a financial restructuring last year that put it on a recovery path, reducing the heavy debt burden of Rs 310 crore to around Rs 108 crore.

 It had also then raised fresh funds of nearly Rs 228 crore by issuing equity and preferred shares and convertible bonds to overseas investors such as Credit Suisse First Boston.

 However, trouble started brewing afresh in the company earlier this year when workers struck work in March and the company declared a lockout at its plant in Kanpur since then.

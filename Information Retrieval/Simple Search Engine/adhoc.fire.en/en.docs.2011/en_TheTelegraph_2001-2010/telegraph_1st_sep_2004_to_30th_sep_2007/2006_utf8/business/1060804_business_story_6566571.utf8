 ONGC Videsh to acquire US company

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 3: The government today gave the go-ahead to ONGC-Videsh Ltd (OVL) to acquire Ominex de Columbia in partnership with China National Petroleum Corporation.

 The cabinet committee of economic affairs has permitted OVL to go ahead with the acquisition, finance minister P. Chidambaram said.

 Ominex de Colombia is owned by Ominex Resources Inc, a US exploration and production company with oil and gas assets in seven states.

 However, the US firm wants to exit this field.

 Chidambaram said OVL could either use its own funds or get parent company ONGC to finance the acquisition. He refused to divulge details due to commercial reasons which carry a confidentiality clause.

 However, sources said OVL had submitted a joint bid with the Chinese company for Ominex de Columbia, which has onshore producing, as well as exploration blocks, in Columbia.

 The net proven reserves of the company are around 157 million barrels.

 This will be OVLs second joint overseas project with the Chinese after the Great Nile project in Sudan.

 OVL will acquire Ominexs 20,000-barrels-per-day onshore oil block in Columbia as part of its project Amazon.

 Sources said the CCEA considered various geopolitical risks, which are normally deterrents to investments in the region, before approving the proposal.

 Sugarcane price

 The CCEA has also approved a proposal to fix the support price for sugarcane at Rs 80.25 per quintal for the 2006-07 sugar season with a basic recovery of 9 per cent. Cane growers will be given a premium of 90 paise for every 0.1 percentage point of recovery above the level of 9 per cent basic recovery.

 The support price stood at Rs 79.50 per quintal during the 2005-06 sugar season. A sugar year runs from October to September.

 Central Electronics recast

 The CCEA gave its nod to the financial restructuring of Central Electronics Ltd. A 10-year moratorium has been allowed to the public sector on its loan of Rs 12.3 crore. The company will also be allowed to avail of a Rs 9.68-crore grant, which had lapsed since it was unable to spend it last fiscal.

 Car sales up 28% in July

 Boom time

 New Delhi, Aug. 8: Lower taxes and discounts by car manufacturers pushed Indias domestic car sales up 28.4 per cent to 81,038 units in July. The motorcycle segment, however, witnessed a modest growth of 13.3 per cent.

 As many as 10 of some 11 car makers in the country, including Maruti, Hyundai, Tata Motors, Ford and General Motors, registered a healthy growth.

 According to figures released by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam), Toyota Kirloskar is the only car company which saw numbers fall as sales stood at 509 units in July against 549 units in the same month last year.

 Car sales in the first four months of this financial year have grown 24.8 per cent to 3,24,671 units against 2,60,025 units in April-July 2005.

 Analysts believe this growth is due to the 8 per cent excise duty cut on small cars in this years budget, high economic growth, rising disposable incomes and a cyclical upsurge in demand after it shrunk to single-digit last fiscal.

 However, hardening of interest rates as well as a rise in costs of input is a constant cause of concern for the industry.

 In the two-wheeler market, motorcycles continued their healthy run despite a marginal 2 per cent decline in the numbers of Hero Honda. The companys sales fell to 2,18,515 units against 2,23,150 units in July 2005.

 Propped up by Bajaj Auto, TVS Motors and Yamaha India, bike sales rose 13.3 per cent in July to 4,53,152 units against 3,99,778 units in the same month last year.

 Overall bike sales in the April-July 2006 period grew 20.5 per cent to 20,61,972 units against 17,10,266 units in the same period last fiscal, said Siam.

 On the scooter and scooterettee side, a near four-fold rise in sales of Honda motorcycle and Scooter India saw numbers go up 37.5 per cent in July at 76,495 units against 55,627 units in the same month last year.

 Overall two-wheeler sales in the month, comprising mopeds, scooters and bikes, were up 15.3 per cent at 5,57,466 units against 4,83,089 units in July 2005.

 As for commercial vehicles, sales were up 37 per cent in the domestic market in July at 32,647 units against 23,827 units in the same month last year. This was boosted by higher numbers of Tata Motors and Ashok Leyland.

 In the medium-and heavy-commercial vehicles segment sales were up 41 per cent to 19,144 units against 13,566 units as goods carriers saw a healthy growth in demand.

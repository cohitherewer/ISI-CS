 Calcutta, Nov. 10: The Bengal government may pick up a stake in the spot market proposed to be set up by the Multi Commodity Exchange in the state by January. 

 According to sources, the government has shown keen interest in developing the spot market for agricultural commodities in the state and has also agreed to amend the Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) Act to facilitate the setting up of the spot market.

 However, the government has not confirmed the move.

 Like in many other states, agriculture markets in Bengal are established and regulated by the state APMC act, according to which wholesale marketing activities in agriculture commodities cannot be carried out outside the areas declared as agriculture market, such as mandis.

 MCX has proposed to set up a spot market for agriculture commodities in the state as a subsidiary of the National Spot Exchange a joint venture between MCX, its promoter, Financial Technologies India Ltd (FTIL), and the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India (Nafed).

 While the National Spot Exchange has been promoted as the holding company for spot markets of non-perishable commodities, MCX has also formed Safal National Exchange in partnership with FTIL and the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) for perishable commodities.

 Meanwhile, the state government has allowed MCX to start trading in futures contracts in potatoes.

 After three years of operations, commodity exchanges feel the need of a well-developed spot market in the country to sustain growth. At present, there are many imperfections in spot markets, including warehousing and cold storage facilities. Because of this, only a small percentage of futures contracts turn to physical deliveries, said Kewal Ram, member of Forward Markets Commission, the regulator of commodities markets.

 Spot market is a state subject while futures markets come under the jurisdiction of the central government.

 The Centre has come out with a model APMC act for states to adopt so that the development of spot markets can be facilitated.

 A Warehousing Receipt and Development Bill is also pending before Parliament and the bill proposes to set up a separate regulator for warehouse and cold stores in the country, Ram said. After this is enacted, warehouses and cold stores will be accredited, he added.

 An amendment to the Futures and Contracts Regulation Act is also pending before Parliament. Once the amendment is approved, we will get an appellate authority. The finance ministry had suggested that the Securities Appellate Tribunal assume the role of the appellate authority for commodities markets as well. However, this will call for an amendment to the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act too, Ram said.

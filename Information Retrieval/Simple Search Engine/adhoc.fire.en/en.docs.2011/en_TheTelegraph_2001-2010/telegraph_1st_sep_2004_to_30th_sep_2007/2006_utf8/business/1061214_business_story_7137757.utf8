 Sensex makes a turnaround

 OUR BUREAU

 Mumbai, Dec. 13: The sensex bounced back by 186 points today after a three-session battering, amid high volatility as select foreign funds grabbed the buying opportunity and cornered sizeable chunks of shares.

 Swinging wildly between 13223.00 and 12830.38, the Bombay Stock Exchange 30-share sensitive index ended the day at 13181.34, a net recovery of 186.32 points or 1.43 per cent over Tuesdays close of 12995.02. 

 The nifty of the National Stock Exchange also recouped by 48.30 points or 1.30 per cent to close at 3765.20 from its previous close of 3716.90.

 Foreign institutional investors used the sharp downward correction to create fresh positions, brokers said.

 Some leading foreign funds, particularly the US-based Fidelity Investments, have been making purchases in several counters, they added. FIIs reported net investments of Rs 422 crore in cash on December 11.

 Banking and capital goods shares, which witnessed heavy battering in the last two days, staged a sharp recovery with their indices jumping by 193.74 points or 2.97 per cent and 198 points or 2.26 per cent at close.

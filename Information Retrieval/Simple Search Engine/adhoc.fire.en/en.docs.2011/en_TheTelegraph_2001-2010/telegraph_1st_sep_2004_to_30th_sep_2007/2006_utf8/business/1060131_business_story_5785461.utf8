 Mittal steels for adversity

 London, Jan. 30: Indian-born Lakshmi Mittal was sniffily put down today by Guy Dolle, chief executive of Arcelor, the Luxembourg-based company that Mittal Steel is trying to buy for $23 billion (?12.8billion). 

 Dolle predicted that the takeover battle might last for between four and six months and commented dismissively: ?The issue is that there are two categories of steel, the high-end and the low-end ? Arcelor produces perfume whereas Mittal makes eau de Cologne.? 

 Mittal, 55, who has so far experienced only the sweet smell of success as he has built up the worlds biggest steel company, is facing a sceptical reaction from the governments of France, Spain, Luxembourg and Belgium who are worried about Arcelors 94,000 employees. 

 As Mittal today launched a charm offensive in Paris, his press conference was followed by that of Dolle who described the takeover offer as ?ridiculous?. 

 In Paris, Mittal had an hour-long meeting with Thierry Breton, the finance minister of France. Arcelor employs nearly 30,000 people from that country. 

 Breton expressed concern that Mittal had not discussed his plans with Arcelor before announcing his bid. 

 But he also stressed that Mittal was ?free to do what he wants?, which some observers interpreted as a strong indication that France was not planning to intervene on Arcelors behalf. 

 At his news conference, Mittal explained he had to move quickly because details of his plans were starting to leak out. 

 ?This merger is not about job reductions,? he said.

 Mittal signalled he was open to discussion about management posts or the board of directors but would not change his bid. 

 Mittal is due to travel to Luxembourg for a meeting tomorrow with its prime minister, Jean-Claude Juncker, before moving on to Belgium on Wednesday, where he will have talks with European Commissioner for Competition Neelie Kroes. 

 He has already offered to locate the headquarters of the merged company in Luxembourg, which holds 5.6 per cent in Arcelor and where 6,000 employees are resident. 

 The government of Belgium is also seeking more commitments before it agrees to any sale of its 2.4 per cent stake in Arcelor. 

 Industry experts said neither company would want to give an inch in the ensuing battle.

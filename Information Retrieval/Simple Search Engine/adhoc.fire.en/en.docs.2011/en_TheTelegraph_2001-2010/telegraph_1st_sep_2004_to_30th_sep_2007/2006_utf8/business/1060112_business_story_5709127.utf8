 Dubai, Singapore rush to gain P amp; control 

 Looking for anchor

 Singapore, Jan. 11 (Reuters): Dubai and Singapore are struggling for control of ports and ferries firm P amp; in a multi-billion dollar bid to extend their reach in Asia and expand their regional transport centres. 

 Singapores PSA, a port operator owned by government investment arm Temasek, has approached P amp;, the London-based company said, and may offer ?3.5 billion ($6.2 billion). That would trump a ?3.33-billion offer by state-backed Dubai Ports World. 

 Shipping experts say the deal is strategic for both bidders. PSA needs to strengthen its position in India, while Dubai Ports World aims to become a global player in ports although few port assets are up for grabs. 

 PSA is interested because of the P amp; ports in India and Australia. They (P amp;) are very strong in these two markets, said John Ong, a former PSA senior executive who now runs his own port consulting business Channels amp; Trends. 

 PSA runs just one small port in the south of India and none in Australia, while P amp; has four terminals in India, one in Sri Lanka and four in Australia. 

 P amp; said on Tuesday the approach from PSA valued its stock at 470 pence per share, compared with an earlier offer of 443 pence a share from Dubai Ports. Temasek confirmed the move, but it and PSA declined to comment on details. P amp;s shares jumped over 6 per cent to 498 pence in early trade on Wednesday in London. 

 A counter bid has been rumoured ever since Dubai announced its plans at the end of November, and talk gained momentum when PSA began to buy shares in P amp;. 

 Industry watchers have long expected PSA to make a major acquisition, and a successful offer would make it the worlds biggest ports group ? surpassing Hong Kongs Hutchison Whampoa ? while securing Singapores strong trade and transport links. 

 Container ports is a rapidly maturing business in Singapore and PSA is doing the right thing. It was pretty clear from the start that PSA would have to go up against Dubai after they made an offer, said a transport analyst at a Singapore stockbroker. 

 A multi-billion dollar bidding war will not be a problem for either of the companies involved, both of which are backed by wealthy governments eager to invest abroad. 

 Generally, there is a sense that PSA is an aggressive bidder and payer, said an analyst at a European bank in Singapore. 

 Temasek is set to receive some S$900 million ($551 million) in cash next month from a payout of excess funds by Neptune Orient Lines, a container liner it controls. 

 Its a strategic buy (for Singapore) and they have the money, said a senior banker who is not involved in the deal. 

 Dubai, part of the United Arab Emirates and a beneficiary of higher oil prices, is scouring the globe for corporate assets, while Singapores Temasek last year spent billions of dollars on stakes in Chinese banks. 

 Both Dubai and Singapore are relatively small in area and population but harbour global ambitions, and are increasingly competing head-to-head to secure their positions as regional transportation, tourism, and financial centres. Both are important air and sea ports, essential infrastructure for boosting trade and tourism. Both want to boost visitor arrivals and investment in their respective economies. 

 PSA still handles more than half of its total container volume in Singapore ? the worlds busiest container port ? but is under pressure to reduce its dependence on the city-state. 

 PSA, the worlds second-largest container port operator, bought two sets of port assets for more than $1 billion in Hong Kong ? home of its arch-rival Hutchison ? last year to give it better access to Chinas booming export and import market.

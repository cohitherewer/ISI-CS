 Mallya grounds Sahara buyout

 Mallya: Soft landing

 Mumbai, Jan. 8 (PTI): Vijay Mallya today said he was not interested in buying Air Sahara any more as his own venture, Kingfisher Airline, has been doing well.

 At this moment, I can tell you that kingfisher is not interested in buying Air Sahara. My airline is doing well. Why should I think of buying another one? Mallya said.

 Kingfisher had tabled a bid to buy Air Sahara a couple of months back, and the amount offered was believed to be $510 million. Ernst and Young, advisers to Air Sahara, had valued the airline at $750 to $1 billion.

 Air Sahara had initially planned to sell a 25 per cent stake, but later decided to sell off the entire airline business. It appointed Ernst and Young as the advisor for a possible transaction.

 In early November, global equity investors were among a pack of eight firms that offered to buy into Air Sahara. Rono Dutta, president of the airline, had confirmed that eight firms have made offers and that two to three would be shortlisted. We are considering all offers at present... Our plan is to work with private equity participation, but at this moment, we are considering all offers we have received, including those from other airlines.

 At that point, Air Sahara wanted to raise money for fleet expansion. The airline, looking at a fleet size of 65 over the next five years, wanted to bring in about 15 narrow-bodied aircraft over the next one-and-a-half years, besides leasing five wide-bodied ones. 

 Kingfisher IPO

 Ruling out stake sales in Kingfisher Airlines ahead of its initial public offer slated to be launched this year, Mallya said there was no plan to cut the holding. Some foreign and private firms have shown interest. Five or six private equity firms are interested. I am not thinking of a stake sale before the public offer,he added.

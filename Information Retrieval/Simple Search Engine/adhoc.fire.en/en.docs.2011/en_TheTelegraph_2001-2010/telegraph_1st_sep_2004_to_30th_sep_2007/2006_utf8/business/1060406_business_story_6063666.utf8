 Daimler yet to decide on EADS stake 

 Frankfurt, April 5 (Reuters): DaimlerChrysler has not yet decided how big a stake it will hold in aerospace group EADS in the long term after it sells a 7.5 per cent stake next year, the German carmaker said on Wednesday.

 DaimlerChrysler said late on Tuesday it had entered a forward sales agreement with banks that will lower its stake in EADS to about 22.5 per cent as part of a carefully coordinated move with fellow EADS investor Lagardere.

 The supervisory board approved reducing our stake by 7.5 per cent on account of this transaction. There have been no further decisions, a DaimlerChrysler spokesman said.

 In its statement on Tuesday, DaimlerChrysler said it and Lagardere would remain core shareholders in EADS but did not specify what stake it intended to keep. 

 Daimler shares rose as much as 2.5 per cent to 49.24 euros on the news and were up 1.4 per cent at 48.68 euros by 0823 GMT.

 EADS shares fell 4 per cent to 32.88 euros in Paris and 4.3 per cent to 32.87 euros in Frankfurt, making them the biggest decliner in the German mid-cap index MDAXI.

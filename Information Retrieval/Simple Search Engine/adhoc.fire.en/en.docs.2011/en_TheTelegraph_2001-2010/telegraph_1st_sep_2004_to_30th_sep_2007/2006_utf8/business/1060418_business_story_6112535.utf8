 Stocks in triple-ton comeback

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, April 17: After last weeks horrendous meltdown, the sensex roared back today to regain most of the losses, turbocharged by the strong guidance put out last Friday by Infosys and a slate of strong earnings results from Gujarat Ambuja Cements and HDFC Bank.

 Recording its biggest rise in a single trading session since May 18, 2004, the sensex leapt 302.45 points (2.6 per cent) to settle at 11539.68. On that day, the sensex had risen 372 points to 4877.02. Nifty jumped 87.75 points or 2.6 per cent to settle at 3433.25. 

 The near term market movements may be more stock specific and will be driven by the quarterly numbers of the companies and business outlook by company managements, said Manish Sonthalia, vice-president (equity strategy), Motilal Oswal Securities. 

 While almost all the sectors look good, technology and the cement sectors will be in focus post Infosys and Gujarat Ambuja figures, said Sonthalia. 

 The BSE IT sector was the biggest gainer among the sectoral indices, advancing 232 points or 5.98 per cent. Infosys jumped 7 per cent to Rs 3,231 on a volume of 6.43 lakh shares. 

 TCS jumped 6.21 per cent to Rs 1,908.40 on 4.64 lakh shares. 

 According to the market watchers, after Infosys announced a liberal 1:1 bonus and Satyam stated that its board will consider a bonus issue along with Q4 results, there were hopes that TCS may also unveil a bonus plan. 

 TCS, which announced a 1:1 bonus after market hours along with strong quarterly numbers, is expected to provide the ballast to tomorrows trading session. 

 Satyam Computers was up 7 per cent at Rs 826, while Wipro ended 5.50 per cent up at Rs 543.50. 

 Also, the Reserve Bank of Indias annual credit policy announcement tomorrow will decide the fate of the banking sector. If the apex bank decided to keep the bank rates untouched, it will mean well for the banking stocks, he added. 

 HDFC Bank rose by 0.6 per cent to Rs 811.25. ICICI Bank rose 3 per cent to Rs 583.50 and State Bank of India gained 1.8 per cent to Rs 935. UTI Bank gained 5 per cent to Rs 334.90 on its results. 

 Base metal makers gained as global copper and zinc prices hovered near record highs and as domestic aluminium firms raised prices from April 16. The BSE Metal Sector Index jumped 410.25 points (4.3 per cent) to settle at 9817.59. 

 Nalco jumped 8 per cent to Rs 315.90, Madras Aluminium gained 6.9 per cent to Rs 450, Hindalco rose 4 per cent to Rs 200, while Hindustan Zinc gained 5 per cent to Rs 793 and Sterlite Industries advanced 2.6 per cent to Rs 2,260.

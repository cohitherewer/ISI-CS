 Alert on fake demat shares

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, June 19: The market regulator has decided to crack down hard to stamp out a growing menace: fake demat shares.

 The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) today released a discussion paper that outlines the measures it intends to take to address the problem and suggests certain amendments to the existing regulations.

 The paper suggests that one of the steps would be to put greater onus on the depositories to ensure that the securities are not dematted in excess of listed or issued capital of a listed company. 

 Sebi has taken certain measures in the past to address these concerns. Despite various measures initiated by Sebi, the problems arising out of excess demat have not been resolved, says the paper.

 One of the measures that it had taken in the past was to slap a penalty of up to Rs 25 crore on any person involved in pernicious practice of dematerialising more shares than have been issued by the company. The regulator has never found enough evidence to nail any one on this count till date.

 But the menace doesnt appear to have blown away. So, the regulator has now suggested that the responsibility should be on all entities involved in the process of dematerialisation, namely, the issuer, its registrar, the depository participant and the depository, apart from the investor who holds the shares. 

 According to another provision, the primary responsibilty for correct reconciliation of total issued securities with those dematerialised lies with the depository. 

 However, in absence of proper clarification, there remains the concern that other players who would not be able to ensure proper reconciliation might be penalised.

 Thus, the paper says there is a need to correctly identify the respective responsibilities of each entity, while the depository should develop the system. It has put responsibility on the depositories to reconcile records of issued, listed and dematted securities. 

 Once the system is established by the depository, each of the other persons will be responsible to fulfill his part of duty properly and will be liable for any lapse in his sphere of duty, says the paper. 

 The regulator has proposed certain amendments to the Sebi (Depositories and Participants) Regulations, which cover three classes of transactions to prevent excess dematerialisation and outlines the process flow post amendment. 

 The amendments broadly cover capturing of distinctive numbers in the depository system, casting responsibility of the depositories to obtain the confirmation from the issuer and the designated stock exchange regarding granting of listing permission before permitting dematerialisation.

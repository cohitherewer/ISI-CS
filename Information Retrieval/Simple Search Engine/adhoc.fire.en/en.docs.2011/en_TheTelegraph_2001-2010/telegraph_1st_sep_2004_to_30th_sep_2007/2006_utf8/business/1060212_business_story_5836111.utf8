 Volkswagen wields the axe to reinvent itself

 Tough time ahead

 Frankfurt, Feb 11 (Reuters): Volkswagen may cut up to 20,000 jobs in the next three years at its core VW brand in a sweeping restructuring programme that could also lead to a reduction in production capacity, it said on Friday.

 Shares in the worlds fourth-largest carmaker rose more than 8 per cent to a high not seen in more than three years following the news, helped as well by better-than-expected 2005 earnings and a upbeat forecast for 2006.

 VW said it expects higher operating profit before special items and slightly higher revenue this year.

 Just one day after French rival Renault disappointed the market with a strategy plan based mainly on sales growth and new models, VW announced a programme that includes reorganising its car parts business, improving productivity and achieving full plant utilisation ? in part through adjusting capacity.

 In the next three years up to 20,000 direct and indirect employees within the Volkswagen Passenger Car brand could be affected by this restructuring programme, the company said in a statement.

 Chief executive Bernd Pischetsrieder told reporters later though he had no plans to shut any plants or cancel VWs in-house wage agreement that protects the 100,000 highly-paid workers at its six western German plants from layoffs through the end of 2011.

 He also played down the scale of job cuts he envisaged. The point is not to cut 20,000 jobs, he said.

 The carmaker has already promised to make thousands of German jobs redundant, but only through early retirement and voluntary termination packages that could lead to hundreds of millions in restructuring costs. 

 Balance sheet boost

 Due primarily to 3.5 billion euros gross earnings boost from its ForMotion efficiency programme, Volkswagen reported a 70 per cent rise in operating profit to 2.79 billion euros even after posting a hefty one-off charge of 351 million euros last year.

 Profit before taxes, a key figure since it includes the contribution from VWs two joint ventures in China, rose nearly 60 per cent to 1.72 billion euros. After tax, the group earned 1.12 billion euros, a gain of just over 60 per cent.

 Volkswagen proposed raising its dividend to 1.15 euros per ordinary share from 1.05 euros the previous year.

 Net cash flow at its core automotive division increased 30 per cent to 2.39 billion euros, helped by restrained investment spending. Analysts closely watch its cash management due to VWs difficulties in the past to finance its own growth from its main business.

 With its balance sheet strengthened, VW plans to buy back up to 2 billion euros in bonds issued by its automotive division. It also plans to cancel all 41.7 million treasury shares it owns.

 VW had very strong earnings in the fourth quarter, but it was not only the numbers that were good ? overall, the tone is more optimistic now than after the third quarter, analyst Stephan Droxner of Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg said.

 The cancellation of treasury shares and the bond buyback indicate that their financial position has improved, he added.

 Despite strong success in its home market of Europe, losses in China and the United States have punched a gaping hole in Volkswagens income statement, wiping off hundreds of millions of euros in earnings.

 Pischetsrieder has stepped up efforts to boost profitability, initiating a bold plan to increase earnings before tax to 5.1 billion euros in 2008 on the back of a 10 billion euro gross improvement.

 Much of the hard work will have to be pulled by its venerable VW brand, which has had to fight harsh currency headwinds and a model line-up that failed to entice buyers in China and the US markets.

 The stock trades at a premium to the rest of the sector, valued at 14.7 times forecast 2006 earnings per share, according to Reuters Estimates.

 Fellow German restructuring play DaimlerChrysler, which has significant business in both the premium and mass market, trades at 13.4 times estimated 2006 EPS, while Renault and PSA have multiples of 7.65 and 8.9, respectively.

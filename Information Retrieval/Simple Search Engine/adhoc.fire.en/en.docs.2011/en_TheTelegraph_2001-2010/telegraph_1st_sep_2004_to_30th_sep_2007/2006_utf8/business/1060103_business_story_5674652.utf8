The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Low key in opening note

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Jan. 2: Markets chose to start the year on a flat note, a far cry from the fireworks in the last days of 2005 but still well poised for bigger leaps in the new year.

 The sensex ended the day with a modest loss of 7.79 points at 9390.14 compared with its previous close of 9397.93 in a see-saw session stalked by jitters over whether indices have soared too high to stay that way for long.

 The 30-share barometer opened above the 9400-mark at 9422.49 and hit 9457.09, its highest ever, as investors went on a buying binge. However, the rally lost some steam in the dying hours of trading, which saw a clutch of local investors sell off some of their shares to rake in profits. 

 The NSEs nifty also wound down to 2835.95 after opening at 2836.80 compared with the weekend finish of 2836.55. It moved in a fairly wide range of 2849.45 to 2825.40.

 FIIs, which hoisted stocks to peaks not seen in the history of stock trading in India by shovelling $10.5 billion last year, also kept purchases commitments low today.

 Some experts were warning of an immediate correction, though they acknowledged that the undertone in the market remained bullish on account of the economys good health and expectations that corporate India will yet again deliver robust numbers for the third quarter of this financial year. With the government expected to continue with reforms, many expect the sensex to test 10,000 ahead of next months budget.

 Behind the relative calm of Dalal Street lay a rally in mid-cap and many small-cap stocks, which showed gains even as the market movers suffered reverses this afternoon. 

 Reliance Industries, ONGC, ICICI Bank, Hero Honda, Infosys were among the big shares to have lost value.

 The volume of business on BSE fell to Rs 2,811.42 crore from Rs 3,935.85 crore on December 30. ICICI Bank totted up the highest turnover of Rs 271.25 crore followed by Reliance Industries (Rs 118.93 crore), GTC (Rs 101.49 crore), SBI (Rs 99.31 crore) and GNFC (Rs 75.76 crore).

 In the forex market, the rupee tumbled to 45.09 against the dollar compared with Fridays finish of 45.04.

 Fertiliser shares were a big draw, lifted by reports that the government might do away with some subsidies.

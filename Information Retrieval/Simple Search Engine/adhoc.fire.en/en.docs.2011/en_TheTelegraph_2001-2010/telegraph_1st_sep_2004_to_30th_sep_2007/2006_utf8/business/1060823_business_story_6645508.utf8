 InterContinental profit climbs, shares slip

 ON Firm ground

 London, Aug. 22 (Reuters): InterContinental Hotels, the worlds largest hotelier, has reported a 30 per cent rise in half-year profits and healthy current trading, but its shares slipped on a lack of news about a cash return to shareholders. 

 The British group, which operates InterContinental, Crowne Plaza and Holiday Inn hotels, said on Tuesday its outlook for 2006 was positive as it shrugged off the threat of an alleged plot to blow up airliners and recent West Asian conflicts.

 The company, which operates more than 3,600 hotels and 540,000 rooms globally, said it saw excellent trading across the world in the first six months of 2006 and now had more than 1,000 new hotels in its worldwide development pipeline. 

 But its shares were the FTSE 100 indexs biggest loser, off 1.8 per cent at 887 pence by 9:20 am British time, following strength in the last few weeks and disappointment there was no new announcement on the amount and timing of a return of cash to shareholders. 

 The trading update was positive but there was profit taking after a reasonable bounce and no new announcement of cash returns, said analyst Mark Reed at Teather and Greenwood. 

 The shares had weakened to nearly 830p in early August on fears of a slowdown in US consumer spending, but then recovered to outperform the FTSE 100 this year by 3 per cent. 

 The hotelier posted a first-half 2006 operating profit from continuing operations of 107 million, just above analyst forecasts of 96 million to 104 million. It added that it had seen no signs of a slowdown in the United States and no weakness in worldwide forward bookings. 

 We have traded well in July, and we are not seeing any softening in forward bookings. Our outlook for the rest of the year remains positive, chief executive Andrew Cosslett said at a half-year results conference call. 

 He was confident the impact of the alleged threats to Trans-Atlantic airliners would be minor and he had seen no impact in the West Asia outside the conflict area of Lebanon and northern Israel. 

 The company said further returns of funds would be made to shareholders as part of its hotel asset-disposal programme, but a decision on the timing and amount would be made not later than February 2007. Disposal proceeds in excess of 400 million will be received in the second half, the group said. 

 The group has sold or agreed to sell 175 hotels for 3 billion since its creation in 2003, and has almost completed the return of 2.74 billion promised to share-holders. It now owns 1 billion of assets, largely its flagship hotels in London, Paris, New York and Hong Kong, with most of the rest of its hotels managed or franchised.

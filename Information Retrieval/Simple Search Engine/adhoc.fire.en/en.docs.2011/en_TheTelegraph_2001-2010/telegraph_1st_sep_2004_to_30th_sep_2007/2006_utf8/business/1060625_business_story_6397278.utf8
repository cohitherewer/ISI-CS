The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Ambani spat continues

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, June 24: Sparks continued to fly between the Ambani brothers today. The Reliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group (R-ADAG) accused the other of deliberately subverting provisions of a broad settlement reached between the two groups on June 18 last year.

 Anils camp said the proposal to establish a cargo airport as part of the Special Economic Zone (SEZ) that Mukeshs group has proposed to set up in Haryana amounted to a blatant violation of agreed terms.

 Sources in R-ADAG today said RIL or the Mukesh group cannot enter the airport sector. According to the agreement, the sector is reserved for Anil, who is now raising objections to the way the RIL group made changes in the non-compete agreement, which would enable it to enter the airports business under certain conditions. These changes, made on January 12 this year, it has been pointed out, are irrelevant as it was wrongfully executed by the Mukesh group when four of the younger brothers companies were still under Mukeshs control.

 The argument of the RIL group that they can build airports in SEZs is untenable because there is no such provision in the agreement of June 18. It is misleading and false to say that building an airport is necessary, integral or incidental to the development of an SEZ. This is only a devious argument by the RIL group to wrongfully enter a business reserved for the Anil Ambani group. Moreover, an airport in an SEZ cannot be for captive use by RILs own business, sources said today.

 The comments came a day after 

 Mukesh announced the massive SEZ project in Haryana. Gautam 

 Doshi, a director in R-ADAG, had objected to the plan of 

 establishing a 2000-mw power plant saying that neither RIL 

 nor its affiliates can promote power projects. However, 

 RIL has contested Doshis contention saying anything 

 incidental to a core business project by the 

 group was well within their right and such projects were 

 not part of the agreement.

 Immelt: Looking ahead

 Mumbai, May 30: Jeffrey Immelt, chairman and CEO of General Electric Company, today articulated a grand plan for its Indian operations that would see it ramp up revenues to $8 billion by 2010.

 Addressing a gathering of the Bombay Chamber of Commerce and Industry here today, Immelt announced a $250-million investment in infrastructure and healthcare projects in India and said the $149.70-billion technology, media and financial services company would expand its industrial and financial presence in the country.

 ?India is a market set to realise its potential. The next 10 years are critically important for India in terms of infrastructure and economic development as the country progresses toward becoming one of the largest economies in the world. Success will require depth in areas where GE excels: infrastructure and technology,? Immelt said.

 Back in November, GE had announced it would be reinvesting all of its proceeds from the settlement of the Dabhol power project ? valued at $145 million ? in Indian infrastructure projects and in equity stakes of projects sponsored by GE?s strategic customers. 

 Today, the GE honcho announced that the company would add another $100 million to this India Development Fund. Immelt said the group was interested in India?s banking sector and would scout for opportunities as soon as the rules were relaxed. ?We remain interested in entering the banking sector in India, in line with Reserve Bank of India guidelines,? he said.

 ?GE is bullish about the financial services sector in India and will invest as appropriate to grow its commercial and consumer financial services businesses,? Immelt said. 

 GE Consumer Finance ? known to consumers as ?GE Money? ? aims to double its revenue by 2010, continuing to invest aggressively in credit cards, home loans, personal loans, and life insurance. With its partner, the State Bank of India, GE is a leading provider of credit cards, with over 2.5 million customers. The company also plans to add 250 GE Money retail branches over the next three years.

 A large real estate investor throughout Asia, GE is targeting India as one of the most attractive opportunities, having entered the country a year ago through a joint venture with Ascendas. GE also provides leasing and equipment financing in high-growth sectors such as construction, transportation, healthcare and information technology, and wants to grow its portfolio by two to three times over the next three years.

 GE plans to invest the development fund corpus to come up with technological solutions to help India address its most pressing needs. 

 A part of the funds will be invested in Dr. Naresh Trehan?s Medicity project, a world-class integrated healthcare facility in New Delhi.

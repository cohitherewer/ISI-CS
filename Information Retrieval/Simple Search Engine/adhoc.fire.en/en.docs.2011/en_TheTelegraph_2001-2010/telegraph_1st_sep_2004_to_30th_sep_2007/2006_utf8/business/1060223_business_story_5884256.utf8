 GAIL gives more time to IPCL

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Feb. 22: GAIL has extended till March the deadline for Reliance Industries-owned IPCL to sign an agreement on natural gas supplies. 

 Earlier this month, GAIL had issued a notice to Reliance saying it would stop gas supplies to IPCL unless the company signed an agreement on supplies within a week. 

 IPCL had sought some more time to sort out the matter at their end. In the meantime, they had offered security through a bank guarantee against the short payment, which GAIL has consented to, said a GAIL official. 

 At the heart of the matter is a marketing margin of 10 cents per million British thermal unit that Reliance does not want to pay GAIL, although other customers are paying it. GAIL supplies 1.03 million standard cubic metres of gas per day to IPCL. If GAIL snaps supply, IPCL will have to use naphtha as a substitute, which is far more expensive.

 Q amp;A

 Gifts galore

 My father has gifted me some money. None of us pay income tax. Do we need a legal deed for the gift? 

 I am a private tutor. How should I show my income while applying for PAN? Will I have to file I-T returns if I get a PAN? 

 Suman Kumar, Dhanbad 

 If the gift is an immovable property, such as a house, it has to be transfered through a legal deed and the same has to be registered. Movable property can be gifted either by a gift deed or by simply delivering the gift. So, you need not make a legal deed if you receive the gift. 

 You can show your income as income from profession when applying for PAN. You need not file returns if your total annual income is less than Rs 1,00,000. 

 Queue of queries

 I have earned Rs 1,38,000 through sale of shares. Is the amount taxable? 

 Are dividends on shares and interest earned on savings bank account/recurring deposit account taxable? 

 I have lost my PAN card. I have made an FIR with a local police station and have applied for a duplicate card with the assistant income tax commissioner. What else should I do? 

 Nripendra Haldar, Calcutta 

 Whether your income from the sale of shares is taxable depends on how long those were in your possession. If you were holding them for more than 12 months, you need not pay tax on the sale proceeds. Otherwise, you will have to pay a tax on the gain amount.

 Dividend on shares is tax free in the hands of the receiver. Interest income on savings/ recurring deposit account is taxable at source.

 For your PAN card, follow it up with the I-T department.

 Out of the net

 I am a senior citizen and a pensioner. In the returns I have filed since assessment year 1998-99, my tax liability was nil. I dont fall under the one-by-six criteria. Do I have to file returns for the assessment year 2006-07 and onwards? 

 N.C. Moitra, Panihati 

 You are not required to file income tax returns in assessment year 2006-07 and afterwards according to the current provisions of the income tax rules.

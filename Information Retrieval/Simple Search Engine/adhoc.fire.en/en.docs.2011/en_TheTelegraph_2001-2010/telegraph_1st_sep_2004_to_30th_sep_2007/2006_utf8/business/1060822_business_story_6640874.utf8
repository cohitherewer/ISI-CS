 High-speed PSU turnaround

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Dev: Proactive

 New Delhi, Aug. 21: The department of heavy industries has turned around as many as 36 PSUs in the last two years, from a combined loss of Rs 821 crore in 2004-05 to a gross profit of Rs 825 crore in 2005-06.

 Announcing this today, minister for heavy industries Santosh Mohan Dev said, Companies like Braithwaite amp; Co which were headed for the sick bay earlier are now doing well.

 Dev said Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has approved a Rs 328-crore package as salaries for loss-making PSUs, with Rs 168-crore for units under his ministry. These include Andrew Yule and Burn Standard. The cabinet approval for the package is expected before the pujas. 

 The restructuring packages for 10 PSUs, including Richardson and Cruddas, Bridge amp; Roof, HMT (Bearings), Heavy Engineering Corporation and Cement Corporation of India, have already been approved by the government. 

 This involves fresh cash infusion of Rs 365 crore and equity participation by the government of about Rs 2,850 crore.

 The government will, however, have to tap new sources of funding as the plan to use proceeds from divesting stakes in other PSUs was abandoned in the absence of sell-offs.

 Dev said an option was to allow companies to sell their surplus land to finance revival plans. HMT has already sold land in Bangalore to raise Rs 200 crore. 

 The land would be sold in a transparent manner to the highest bidder and the chief secretary of the state concerned would also be associated with the committee that undertakes the bidding exercise, he said.

 The minister said only chronic loss-making PSUs with almost no chances of survival would be closed after clearing the dues of workers. These include Durgapur-based Bharat Ophthalmic Glass and seven units of the Cement Corporation of India. 

 Dev said his ministry has performed the healing job on loss-making capital goods units. The industry, which suffered a phase of prolonged recession, is witnessing a spike in growth. 

 The growth rate had jumped to 13.3 per cent in 2004-05 and further to 15.5 per cent in 2005-06. Prospects during the current year were even brighter as the growth recorded during the first quarter had shot up 21.1 per cent.

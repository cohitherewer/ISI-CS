 New Delhi, June 1: The domestic software industry is expected to grow between 25 and 28 per cent to touch $36-38 billion during fiscal 2006-07. 

 Last fiscal, the software services industry beat a growth forecast of 26-27 per cent and grew by more than 31 per cent.

 Exports grew 33 per cent year-on-year to $23.6 billion, up from $17.7 billion revenues earned in 2004-05.

 According to a forecast by the National Association of Software and Services Companies (Nasscom), the software and services exports are likely to post a lower growth rate this fiscal on account of a larger base. The exports growth is projected at 27-30 per cent.

 Nasscom president Kiran Karnik, said, The demand for outsourcing will remain strong. We usually give conservative forecasts. We are also looking at a larger base for the year ahead.

 According to him market indicators are strong. There is a large untapped offshore market that will sustain growth and help win clients. There are chances of cross-border mergers and acquisitions, stable pricing with a marginal upward bias, and a gradual shift in the outsourcing debate, he added. 

 Revenues from the domestic market grew 24 per cent in 2006. 

 The apex software industry body feels the government has to boost the domestic market through various policy measures, including an increase in IT spending, procurement through on-line means and deregulation of various sectors that would pave the way for improving efficiency through greater spending on IT.

 The number of employees in the IT and ITeS sector grew to 1.3 million in the last financial year, from 1.05 million in the previous year. 

 While IT software and services added over 120,000 people, ITeS-BPO added 100,000. The exports segment is estimated to employ close to 930,000 people.

 Tug-of-war 

 over Nalco selloff

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Ola: Tough stand

 New Delhi, June 20: The feud within the government over Nalco stake sale was out in the open today with mines minister Sis Ram Ola saying his ministry does not favour divesting the governments holding in the company. 

 We will agree only if the selloff proceeds are made available to Nalco for its expansion, Ola said. We are against disinvestment of profit-making PSUs under the mines ministry and Nalco has been doing reasonably well.

 Two years ago, the UPA regime mandated that proceeds from divesting the governments equity in public sector units will be deposited in the National Investment Fund.

 The Left parties are also unwilling to sell.

 Ola was responding to queries over a finance ministry proposal to sell 10 per cent of the governments 87 per cent holding in National Aluminium Co Ltd. 

 The finance ministry has circulated a draft note in the cabinet seeking to come out with a public issue for the stake sale, which is expected to generate Rs 1,500-1,800 crore.

 North Block had also wanted to split Nalco shares prior to the equity selloff to make it attractive to retail investors. 

 In view of the high market price of the Nalco share, it would be necessary to consider splitting the shares in order to provide affordability to small investors and to allot shares to a large number of investors, the finance ministry said in a note for the cabinet committee on economic affairs for off-loading 10 per cent stake in Nalco through a public offer.

 Ola said the aluminium company has been asked to expedite the second phase of capacity expansion at its plant in Angul in Orissa. 

 The mines ministry, which controls the blue-chip firm, wants the stake sale stayed till Nalco completes the ongoing expansion.

 The company is undertaking a Rs 4,091-crore expansion project to increase the aluminium smelter capacity at Angul from 3.45 lakh tonnes to 4.6 lakh tonne and raising the power production from 960 mw to 1200 mw. 

 Along with this, the company will expand bauxite mining capacity at Pattangi in Koraput district and Kodingamal in Raigada district, enhancing mining capacity by 15 lakh tonnes.

 Officials said Nalco was also exploring possibilities of setting up an aluminium smelter in the Gulf to leverage on the low electricity rates, which is a major component for producing aluminium.

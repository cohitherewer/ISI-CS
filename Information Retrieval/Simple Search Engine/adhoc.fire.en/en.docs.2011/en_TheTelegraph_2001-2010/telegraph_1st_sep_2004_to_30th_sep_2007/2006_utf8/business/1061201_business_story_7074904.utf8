 Bank exposure to NBFCs capped

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Nov. 30: To provide a level-playing field in the financial sector, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) today issued revised draft guidelines for non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) and their association with the banking sector. 

 According to the circular, banks in India, along with foreign banks, will not be allowed to hold more than a 10 per cent stake in a deposit taking NBFC. However, investment in housing finance companies have been exempted. 

 According to bankers, this is expected to impact certain foreign banks, including Citibank, Standard Chartered and GE Capital, which have significant retail exposure in the country through the NBFC route.

 All such NBFCs promoted by foreign banks and operating as subsidiaries in the country shall be treated as part of the banks operations and would be brought under the ambit of consolidated prudential regulations. 

 The guidelines also say that a banks exposure to a single NBFC, both deposit taking and non-deposit taking, shall not exceed 10 per cent of the banks capital funds, while the total exposure has been limited to 40 per cent stake. However, this limit may be exceeded by 5 and 10 per cent respectively, if the additional exposure is on account of lending to the infrastructure sector. 

 All non-deposit taking NBFCs will have to maintain a minimum capital adequacy requirement of 10 per cent. They will also have to comply with the single and group exposure norms, which are applicable to deposit-taking NBFCs. This means that they will have to restrict their exposure to a single borrower up to 15 per cent of their owned funds, while the exposure to any single group of borrowers will not exceed 25 per cent of its owned funds.

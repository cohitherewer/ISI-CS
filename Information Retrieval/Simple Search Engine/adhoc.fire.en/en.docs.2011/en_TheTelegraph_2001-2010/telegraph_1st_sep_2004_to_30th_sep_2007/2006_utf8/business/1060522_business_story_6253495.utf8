 Tata Ryerson plans for foreign trip

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Calcutta, May 21: Tata Ryerson Ltd (TRL), the 50:50 joint venture between Ryerson Tull of the US and Tata Steel, is sniffing opportunities abroad.

 The company has marked three countries ? China, South Africa and Dubai ? to set up its shops.

 TRL acts as a service centre for the steel industry, supplying products designed to meet customer needs.

 Tata Ryerson has three centres in India ? Jamshedpur, Pune and Faridabad ? while Ryerson Tull has 122 across the globe.

 We are studying the prospects of these markets. A decision for the international venture would be taken in another six months, said Sandipan Chakravortty, managing director of TRL.

 TRL is keen to leverage the opportunities available in China which is the largest producer of steel accouting for 25 per cent of the global production.

 The companys interest in South Africa, on the other hand, is of a different nature. The Tata group, including Tata Motors and Tata Steel, is expanding its base in the country. Dubai also is in the epicentre of a massive construction boom taking place in the Gulf, and therefore offers a big opportunity to TRL. It is also a strategic location to enter Central Asian, European and African markets.

 The company would probably look for local partner for various benefits in all these counties. The global venture will also depend upon the priorities set by the two partners. While Ryerson is willing to take the company out of India, Tata Steel is keen that it concentrates more at home.

 Skoda rolls out growth plans

 A STAFF REPORTER

 OWNERS PRIDE

 Calcutta, May 11: Skoda Auto India has registered a 25 per cent growth in sales in 2005 and aims to be present in nearly all segments of the domestic car market in the next three years.

 The company is studying the possibilities of introducing models in the local market from its international stable.

 We currently assemble all the 13 models available in the domestic market at our facility in Aurangabad. But buoyed by our growth, we are looking at introducing more models. The region has evolved to play a major role in Skoda Autos plans globally, said Lukas Folc, managing director of Skoda Auto India.

 Last year, the company doubled its capacity from 15,000 units to 30,000 at its Maharashtra facility.

 Folc said Skoda is the only luxury carmaker in the country to have three operational lines. The overall sales target for 2006 is 13,500 vehicles. In 2005, the carmaker sold 8,953 vehicles.

 We have also started the process of building the brand in Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka, Folc said.

 Skoda is currently putting in place the infrastructure, dealership and service support in the above locations.

 As far as launches are concerned, Folc only stated that they are currently evaluating options for upcoming announcements.

 The company has a marketshare of over 25 per cent in the luxury car segment and plans to augment its share by such aggressive plans to tackle the Indian market.

 The firm has recently launched the Skoda Octavia Classic with an ex-showroom price of Rs 11,67,442 in the city.

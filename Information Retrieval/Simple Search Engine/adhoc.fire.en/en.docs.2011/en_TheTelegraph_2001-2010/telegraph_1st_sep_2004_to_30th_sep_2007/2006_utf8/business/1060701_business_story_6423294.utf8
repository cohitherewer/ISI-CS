 Jet targets Sahara boss

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Caught in bad weather

 Mumbai, June 30: Nixing the possibilities of an out-of-court settlement, Jet Airways today moved Bombay High Court to recover the Rs 500-crore advance to Sahara Airlines chief Subroto Roy. The advance was made in January when Jet agreed to buy Sahara for Rs 2,300 crore ? a deal that got scuppered last week.

 Jet transferred Rs 500 crore into an escrow account for Sahara. Though company officials refused to comment, sources said the case was against Roy since he personally guaranteed the refund of the advance if the deal got terminated.

 The share-purchase agreement specified that Air Sahara would refund Rs 500 crore within seven days. The case will come up for hearing later. 

 Jet pulled out of the Sahara deal as some pre-conditions for the deal failed to materialise. Jet had also moved the Supreme Court over the payment of the Rs 500 crore within a week of termination of the pact.

 In its application before the Supreme Court on Wednesday, Jet said according to the share purchase agreement Sahara was committed to return the Rs 500-crore advance. This repayment will be made within seven days from the expiry of the agreement.

 Jet also sought a stay on an interim order of the Lucknow district court that put a freeze on the escrow account. 

 Jet had last week filed an arbitration petition in Bombay High Court urging the court to restrain the respondents from issuing notices to the escrow agent to claim the advance.

 Jet said it had paid Rs 500 crore on March 29 as advance to the escrow agent for purchase of Sahara in keeping with an agreement which was subject to conditions precedent. The agreement said if the conditions were fulfilled by June 21 then the respondents would be entitled to claim Rs 500 crore from the escrow agent.

 Jet also claimed it was entitled to close the agreement without giving notice to any party if the conditions were not fulfilled by June 21. 

 Lucknow hearing

 The Lucknow district court hearing a petition by Sahara today deferred hearing till July 29, after being informed by the counsels that a petition had been filed in the Supreme Court seeking transfer of the cases. 

 District and sessions judge Shiv Charan Sharma directed that the interim order restraining Jet from making any withdrawal from the escrow account and ICICI Bank from releasing any money will continue till further orders.

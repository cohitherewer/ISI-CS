 India joins elite gas club

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 20: India joined the exclusive club of USA and Japan today by establishing the presence of massive gas hydrates in its deep waters in the eastern offshore Krishna-Godavari basin, the petroleum ministry said.

 According to petroleum minister Murli Deora, a 128-m thick gas hydrate layer indicating massive to dispersed gas hydrates in the KG basin has been struck that can produce natural gas.

 The drilling, coring and logging of gas hydrate bearing sediments in the Indian offshore areas started on May 5 under the National Gas Hydrates Programme using the drillship Joides Resolution through an agreement between the directorate general of hydrocarbons and a US consortium.

 The drilling has met with significant success in establishing the presence of sizeable reserves of good quality gas hydrates in the sedimentary basins in India. Results from the second site in the KG basin are particularly remarkable, the ministry said.

 The gas hydrate samples have been physically collected for the first time in the country. 

 These samples have been collected at the surface, even though the surface temperature is about 37 degrees Celsius. 

 It implies that there are massive hydrates present in the subsurface, which is also corroborated with the help of logging while drilling and wireline logs. 

 In this particular well, a total thickness of gas hydrate bearing a layer of up to 128 m is indicative of the presence of significant quantities of gas hydrates in the area.

 Deora said, This marks a significant development. The research and development work is in progress to develop a commercially viable technology to produce natural gas from gas hydrates, which is so far not available anywhere in the world. Development of this unconventional source of energy could meet a large part of our ever increasing demand for gas in the decades to come.

 The drilling programme will be completed in four phases in about 115 days at a cost of about $36 million. The project is being funded by the Oil Industry Development Board. 

 The results of this R amp;D effort have started pouring in and are reported to be better than expected. 

 The gas hydrate signatures were earlier seen in the seismic data and through other geo-scientific data carried out in selected areas, where drilling activity is now in progress.

 Airport cop set to be given wings

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 New Delhi, Nov. 29: The government plans to have a law to set up an airport economic authority, which will fix tariffs on services in airports, monitor standards and ensure a level-playing field among airport users. 

 Top civil aviation ministry sources said such a regulator was necessary to arbitrate on the conflicts, in the provision of services, that are expected to rise with the growing trend of privatisation of operations at airports.

 The aims and objectives of the airport authority are to fix, review and approve tariff structure for all aeronautical services at airports, monitor pre-set performance standards and ensure a level-playing field for airport users and operators. 

 The Naresh Chandra committee on airport modernisation had proposed a body that would not only have the regulatory powers of the directorate general of civil aviation (DGCA) but also be a quasi judicial body like the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). 

 However, the civil aviation ministry the DGCA is under this ministry decided against setting up a body with such sweeping powers, preferring an airport regulator instead. Several ministries, including the Planning Commission, however, prefers a regulator with greater powers, and the ministers concerned are likely to raise this issue when the act comes up before the cabinet.

 The proposed regulator will have powers to resolve any disputes arising either between airports or between new airports and the government.

 Besides checking price cartels or oligopolistic behaviour in the fixing of different airport fees, the regulator will arbitrate on disputes relating to abuse of monopoly, prescribe and enforce minimum standards for all agencies and ensure a level-playing field.

 The regulator is also expected to stop discrimination against airports by the Centre in the allotment of flights of global carriers. State governments in the past have often accused the Centre of step-motherly treatment in allocating rights or nudging foreign airlines to fly to certain cities and not to others.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 It?s a bankable option

 With 5-year bank deposits now eligible for tax relief, seniors have an opportunity, says Srikumar Bondyopadhyay

 After finance minister P. Chidambaram presented his budget for 2006-07 on the last day of February, Ambarish Mukherjee ? a 68-year-old pensioner ? changed his daily routine. 

 He no longer wakes up late; instead he goes to the market early to make sure that he returns home by 10 am.

 Instead of showing up at the neighbourhood library or a friend?s place for a game of chess or cards till lunchtime ? which was his daily routine until recently ? Mukherjee is on to something else.

 The retired government official shows up at one bank or the other before the clock strikes 11 and heads straight towards the manager?s chamber. His only query: What?s the rate of interest that he would get on a fixed deposit of more than five years?

 A taxpayer pensioner, Mukherjee knows his numbers. Bank fixed deposits with a maturity of five-years and above is allowed tax deduction up to Rs 1 lakh under section 80C from fiscal 2006-07. This tax advantage has made bank fixed deposits more beneficial for senior citizens who continue to remain income taxpayers. 

 For non-taxpayer elderly people, however, the post office monthly income scheme and Senior Citizen Savings Scheme are still better. 

 Post office returns

 In his 2004-05 budget, the finance minister had withdrawn the benefit of tax deduction on interest income under section 80L. Under this section, one could claim a tax deduction of up to Rs 15,000 on interest income. 

 Following this, interest income from the post office monthly income scheme (POMIS) ? the most popular avenue for senior citizens? savings ? became taxable. The applicable rate corresponds to the tax bracket in which the account holder falls. 

 The post office monthly income scheme, despite giving an interest rate of 8 per cent per annum, loses much of its sheen because of this tax provision. For example, if a senior citizen?s income is taxable at the rate of 20 per cent, the effective rate of return from a post office monthly savings scheme reduces to 6.4 per cent.

 However, a 10 per cent bonus on maturity was the rescuer. But the finance minister has also taken it back with effect from February 13 this year. This means that new or renewal deposits will no longer fetch the 10 per cent bonus on maturity after six years. 

 The withdrawals of the tax benefit and the bonus is a double blow for senior citizens who regarded POMIS as the best hedge against rising costs of living.

 The other aspect that has blunted the attractiveness of the post office scheme is the Rs 3 lakh investment limit for individuals. Three persons can jointly open an account, but even here, the overall investment ceiling is Rs 9 lakh. 

 Senior citizens plan

 The Senior Citizens Savings Scheme, which can be opened either in a bank or in a post office, bears an interest rate of 9 per cent. But again, the interest income is taxable (at the marginal tax rate of an account holder) in the absence of section 80L benefits. 

 Besides, one cannot invest more than Rs 15 lakh in one account and cannot withdraw the money before five years. Providing for taxes at the rate of 20 per cent, the effective rate of return thus works out at 7.2 per cent. 

 Better alternative

 Bank deposits of five years and above have now been brought under section 80C from the next financial year. Senior citizens ought to take a hard look at this option as banks are now free to decide their deposit rates and almost all the banks give senior citizens a 0.5 to 1 per cent higher interest rate. 

 Banks usually pay interest between 6.50 and 7.25 per cent on their regular fixed deposit schemes of five years and above. Senior citizens can get between 7 and 7.75 per cent on such deposits with the added advantage of tax deduction. The effective return on a five-year bank fixed deposit thus works out to between 8.75 and 9.6 per cent (at the 20 per cent tax rate). 

 Besides, there is no cap on how much money one can put in such a term deposit. Banks even give a differential interest rate depending on the deposit amount. For example, deposits of more than Rs 15 lakh earn a 0.25-0.5 per cent higher interest rate than deposits less than Rs 15 lakh. 

 Why Mukherjee is checking out the interest rates with every bank is now understandable. Mukherjee is out shopping for the best interest rate bargain. Isn?t it time you did the same?

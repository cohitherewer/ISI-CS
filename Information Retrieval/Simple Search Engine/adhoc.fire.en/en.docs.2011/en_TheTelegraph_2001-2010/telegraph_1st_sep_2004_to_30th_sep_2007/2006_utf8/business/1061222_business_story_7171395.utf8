 Exports to US lose shine

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 21: Exports to the US, especially in gems and jewellery, could be hit under the new trade law approved by President George W. Bush on Wednesday.

 The new laws have imposed restrictions on duty-free benefits that the US extended to a range of goods imported under the generalised system of preferences (GSP).

 The US appears to have hit back at India and Brazil for their tough stand at the WTO.

 The US is Indias largest trading partner, accounting for over 20 per cent of its exports. Gems and jewellery are covered under the GSP. A target of $20 billion was set for gems and jewellery exports in 2007.

 Venezuela, Thailand, Ivory Coast and the Philippines can also lose trade benefits because of recent changes that the Congress made to the US generalised system of preferences programme for developing countries.

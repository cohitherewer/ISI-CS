 CEO forum charts reform agenda

 New Delhi, March 20 (PTI): The US-India CEO forum has come out with a far-reaching reform agenda, including opening up the retail sector and raising FDI caps in insurance, banking, print media and broadcasting.

 In a 26-point agenda to create an enabling environment to attract more foreign investment, the US-India CEO forum wanted specialised courts to enforce intellectual property rights laws.

 The report tabled in the Lok Sabha today stressed on power sector reforms to ensure the sanctity of contracts, encourage competition, promote market-driven tariffs and set up a separate regulatory and adjudication authority.

 It also suggested relaxation of the US government rules to transfer high technology to India and extension of Comsat rules to India and Isro. 

 According to the report, the US should allow and accelerate transfer of dual use technology to India and liberalise the US visa regime for service providers in IT and nurses.

 The forum, comprising selected CEOs from both countries, was given a mandate to develop a roadmap for increased business partnership and co-operation between the two countries.

 The document, tabled by the minister of state in PMO, Prithviraj Chauhan, on behalf of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, has recommended specific action in 15 business sectors with the potential for significantly increasing trade and investment through policy initiatives.

 The forum wanted India to consider reducing restriction on FDI in the retail sector, move ahead on urban land reforms, streamline the regulatory, tax and duty structure, and revamp stamp duty and title registration regimes. It suggested India should consider treating dividends from overseas companies in the hands of Indian residents on a par for tax with domestic dividends to make outward FDI no less attractive.

 According to the report, tariff and non-tariff barriers should be reduced in all products, agricultural and manufactured, over a specified period of time by both the US and India. 

 It stressed the need to foster speed, efficiency and transparency in the bidding process for build-operate-transfer contracts in infrastructure in India. 

 Elaborating on liberalisation of the US visa regime, the forum said wherever the US was facing shortages of trained personnel, visa regime should be eased, including quantitative restriction and yearly quotas of such visas.

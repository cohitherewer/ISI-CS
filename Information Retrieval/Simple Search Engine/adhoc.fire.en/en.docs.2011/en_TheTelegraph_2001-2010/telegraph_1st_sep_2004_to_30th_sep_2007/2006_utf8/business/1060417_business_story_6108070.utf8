 MFs line up for pension booty

 GAURAV CHOUDHURY

 Anxious wait

 New Delhi, April 16: Mutual funds just cant wait for the opening up of the pension sector amidst expectations of superannuation funds providing a big bulge to their earnings kitty.

 Besides opening up the pensions market, the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) Bill is also expected to open up a major source of funds for the equities market.

 A senior executive of UTI Asset Management Company said mutual funds would provide the perfect foil for growth of the pensions market in India. 

 Pension is an advise-based product. There is a need to have adequate expertise, track record, capital requirement, risk management and qualified staff for the fund management company, he said.

 There is no need to reinvent the wheel, but rather leverage the experience and infrastructure of insurers, mutual funds, banks and post-offices, said Naren N. Joshi, chief representative of ING Insurance.

 Joshi said the marketing, distribution, compliance and record-keeping norms of the new pension system are similar to the rules in the mutual fund and insurance sectors. Therefore, qualified insurance and mutual fund companies should also be entrusted to function as pension fund managers in the new system, said Joshi.

 Mutual fund analysts said allowing pension funds to invest in equities would lower volatility on the bourses. Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) are the major investors in the stock markets followed by mutual funds. However, unlike FIIs, pension funds are long-term players. By its very nature and its intricate correlation with the demographic cycle, pensions are long gestation investments, an analyst said.

 Under the new pension system that the bill seeks to introduce, an investor will have complete control over the pension contributions. One will be able to select a professional pension fund manager (PFM) from a pool of competing pension fund managers registered with the PFRDA.

 Each PFM in this system will offer a choice of three simple and standard pension schemes with different risk and return profiles.

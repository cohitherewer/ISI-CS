The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 ZTE to hire more for Calcutta centre

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Buzz gets louder

 Calcutta, Dec. 29: ZTE Telecom India Private Limited is looking at expanding its engineering centre in the city.

 The China-headquartered company, which currently employs 60 people at the centre, is expected to raise the headcount by three times. The centre provides hardware and operations support for ZTE handsets in the country.

 We have also informed the state government that we want 20,000 sq ft space, preferably in Sector V, Salt Lake or Rajerhat, D.K. Ghosh, chairman and managing director of ZTE Telecom India, said.

 ZTE also clarified that it has not yet abandoned talks with BSNL for CDMA phones and infrastructure in the city.

 ZTE has a handset assembly and support plant in Manesar near New Delhi.

 The company is believed to have received a $700-million order for GSM equipment, including base transceiver stations (BTS), receivers and soft switches, from Reliance Communications.

 The equipment will be supplied to Reliance after the communications ministry allots the spectrum for the companys proposed GSM services, according to reports.

 We cannot comment on the deal. Some announcement could be forthcoming by February-end. As of now, we are just a vendor like Ericsson, Nokia and Huawei, Ghosh said.

 ZTE is set to bring in a host of products, including low-cost handsets. It has a range of telecom technology, including the latest in Wi-Max with IEEE platform or the low-cost CDMA infrastructure for rural areas.

 Reliance is believed to be planning to issue a tender for 75 million GSM lines. This will be nearly twice the size of the tender issued by Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd for 45 million lines for equipment worth about $5 billion.

 The companys expansion plans would depend on how such supply contracts and joint ventures work out.

 Datawind Corp

 Canada-based telecom firm Datawind Corporation has given a Rs 450-crore proposal to the state IT department to manufacture surfer boxes, a device that will connect mobile phones with television, enabling exchange of content.

 The firm has launched a low-priced pocket surfer in the city. 

 The project would provide employment to around 1,000 people. If the state government can pitch in Rs 150 crore, we will add another Rs 150 crore and arrange for the rest from the IMF or World Bank, said Harjinder Singh, CEO, India operations, Datawind Corporation. 

 The company has already launched its pocket surfer in Delhi. It is selling around 1,000 pieces a month.

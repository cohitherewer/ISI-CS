The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Anil has more than just four

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Feb. 9: How many companies did the Anil Ambani group get through the demerger? Four? Think again. Its actually 189. In comparison, the Mukesh group got just 52.

 Of course, this doesnt take into account the large swathe of investment companies, most of which have gone to the Mukesh group. That could go into a couple of hundred at a very conservative estimate.

 Anils Fab Four ? which have been stripped away from Reliance Industries ? are Reliance Energy Ventures Ltd, Reliance Communications Ventures Ltd, Reliance Natural Resources Ltd and Reliance Capital Ventures Ltd.

 But the handover was not restricted to the four entities; rather it covered the business areas that these represented ? coal-based power business, gas-based power business, financial services business and telecommunications.

 The communications business is the largest group with 149 companies. The main companies in this field are Reliance Infocomm Ltd (RIC), Reliance Communications Infrastructure Ltd (RCIL) and Reliance Telecom Ltd ? all of which the Anil group intends to merge. The others are subsidiaries or affiliates of either RIC or RCIL. This group also includes the Flag Telecom group of 31 companies that Reliance acquired in 2003 for $207 million.

 The ADA group also gets 26 companies engaged in energy-related operations ? gas and coal-based. The biggest company in this group is Reliance Energy, which has 18 subsidiaries or affiliates. There are seven other power generating companies in this group. One power company ? Reliance Wattage ? has since been renamed Reliance Natural Resources Ltd and will buy gas from Reliance Industries and supply it to the power companies within the group.

 The financial services business has 10 companies, including Reliance Capital, and two insurance companies ? Reliance General Insurance and Reliance Life Insurance.

 There are four other companies in unrelated areas. Two deal with property ? Reliance Land Pvt. Ltd and Property Chlorosulf Pvt Ltd. Mudra Communications is an advertisement firm, while Reliance Transport amp; Travel is a travel agent.

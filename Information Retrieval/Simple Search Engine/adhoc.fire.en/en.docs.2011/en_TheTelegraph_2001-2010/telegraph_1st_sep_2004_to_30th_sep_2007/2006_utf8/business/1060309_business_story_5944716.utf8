 Surge in foreign investment

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, March 8: Inflows of foreign direct investments (FDI) in the country jumped by over 300 per cent in January this year compared with the same month last year. 

 Commerce minister Kamal Nath said the major chunk of this incremental FDI came into the manufacturing sector. This will augur well to help increase the share of manufacturing in the gross domestic product (GDP) to the targeted 24 per cent from 16 per cent at present. Increasing investments in manufacturing not only means creation of more jobs but also the fact that modern technology is coming into the country, the minister added. 

 Nath said the foreign investments into equity up to the third quarter of 2005-06 has been $4.34 billion. This represents a 60.5 per cent increase over the corresponding previous figure of $2.7 billion. 

 The major investing countries during January have been Germany which accounted for 35 per cent of total FDI flow, UK with 26 per cent, Mauritius 22 per cent, Singapore 6 per cent and the US with 2 per cent.

 The major sectors inviting investment in January this year were chemicals, power, oil refining, agricultural machinery, pharmaceuticals. The services sector accounted for 4 per cent of the FDI inflows.

 New Holland Tractors, GVK Power and Micro Links, a printing ink manufacturing company, attracted the highest FDI during the month.

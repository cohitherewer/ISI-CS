 Dhoot: Big plans

 Calcutta, Sept. 19: Electrolux, in association with Videocon, is planning to set up a greenfield manufacturing unit at Kashipur near Nainital in Uttaranchal at an investment of Rs 150 crore.

 The plant will initially make colour televisions, airconditioners and refrigerators. Later on, we will produce washing machines from this unit, Electrolux managing director Anirudh Dhoot said after launching a range of washing machines with 5 kg to 7 kg capacity for the eastern market.

 The new plant will be operational by April-May next year and will manufacture 5 lakh refrigerators and 3 lakh airconditioners a year to start with, Dhoot said.

 Last year, Videocon bought Electrolux Kelvinator, the Indian arm of Sweden-based AB Electrolux, and the process of amalgamation of the two companies were completed in July this year. The Electrolux washing machines launched today will be totally imported from AB Electroluxs manufacturing plant in China and are priced between Rs 6,500 and Rs 15,000. However, from next year onwards, we plan to manufacture these here at our facilities at Shahjanpur in Rajasthan and Warora in Maharashtra, said Dhoot.

 So far, we had only one semi-automatic washing machine model. But with the launch of five Electrolux models three automatic and two semi-automatic we expect to increase our market share in washing machines to 8 per cent from 3.5 per cent at present, said Madhav Nene, deputy general manager, marketing, Electrolux.

 According to Nene, the company will introduce kitchen products such as hobs and chimneys from the Electrolux stable in the near future. Recently, it introduced frost-free refrigerators, which are being imported from AB Electroluxs manufacturing facility in Thailand. 

 As the festive season draws near, consumer durable manufacturers are out to lure customers with new technology and thereby increase their market share. Recently, Godrej amp; Boyce launched its EON range of frost-free refrigerators and LG Electronics India its high-tech micro-ovens, refrigerators and flat panel televisions. Electrolux aims to achieve a sales turnover of Rs 650 crore this year with the introduction of the new category of washing machines and refrigerators.

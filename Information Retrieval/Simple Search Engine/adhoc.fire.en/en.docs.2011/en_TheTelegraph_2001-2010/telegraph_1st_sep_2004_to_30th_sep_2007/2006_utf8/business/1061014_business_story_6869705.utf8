 Calcutta, Oct. 13: The Yash Birla group is planning to invest Rs 550 crore in its businesses in the next financial year. It has identified five sectors engineering, auto component, power solutions, textile and lifestyles as focus areas.

 Chairman Yashovardhan Birla said each segment has tremendous potential and the group has big expansion plans for all of them.

 The biggest chunk of investment about Rs 200 crore will go into the textile business run by Birla Cotsyn, making it a fully integrated player from spinning to fabrics.

 Eventually, the group wants to create its own brand and set up a retail chain across the country.

 Engineering and auto component run under flagship Zenith Birla will bag an investment of Rs 131 crore, which is being raised through a public offer.

 The group has also recently concluded a public issue of about Rs 50 crore in Birla Power Solutions. 

 The company, which pioneered gensets in the country, is eyeing the non-conventional energy sector, especially the solar segment. 

 The lifestyle division, which includes spas, a furniture chain and publishing, will also get substantial management and financial patronage from the group.

 Yash Birla was in the city for the roadshow of the Zenith Birla follow-on public offer.

 Zenith Birla, manufacturer of steel pipes and machine tools, will offer 2,38,18,182 shares at a price of Rs 55 per share during October 16-20.

 Out of the total public issue, the promoters will subscribe to 45,45,455 shares at a price of Rs 62 per share.

 The capital raised from the issue will be used to set up a mechanical tube plant that will start functioning from November next year. 

 The company is eyeing the oil and gas transportation market and auto component sector from the product coming out of the new unit.

 At present, the company has three plants at Khopoli, Aurangabad and Nashik. The new plant will also come up at Khopoli. Zenith Birla earns half of its annual revenue (total Rs 320 crore) from overseas market, mainly the US and West Asia.

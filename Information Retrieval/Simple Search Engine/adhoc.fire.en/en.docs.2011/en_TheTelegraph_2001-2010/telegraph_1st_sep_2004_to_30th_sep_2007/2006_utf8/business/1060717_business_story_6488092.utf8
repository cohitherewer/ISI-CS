 Nano magic to fight diesel dirty tricks

 S.P.S. PANNU

 Checkpoint

 New Delhi, July 16: The PSU oil majors have roped in Authentix of the UK to introduce a patented marker in kerosene to check the rampant use of the cooking fuel to adulterate diesel. (Authentix uses nano-technology to develop its markers.)

 A senior petroleum ministry official told The Telegraph that the marker of the British company would be added to the kerosene supplied to PDS outlets from October 1. If the kerosene is mixed with diesel, the marker will change the colour of the mixture indicating adulteration. 

 The oil majors ? Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum? have opted for this mechanism as the existing tools are ineffective.

 Authentix will also participate in the project as an independent certifying agency. 

 When apprehended by sleuths, some petrol pump dealers alleged that the diesel may have been tampered with en route to the stations. 

 There have also been cases of company officials conniving with the dealers and transporters to adulterate diesel.

 The price disparity between diesel and kerosene ? it is more than Rs 20 ? is the crux of the problem. Unscrupulous retail pump owners mix cheap kerosene from the public distribution system (PDS) with diesel to rake in a fast buck.

 The price of kerosene has been suppressed as it is the poor mans fuel. It is supplied at around Rs 9 per litre, while diesel has a tag of over Rs 30 per litre. The PSUs supply close to 8 million tonnes of kerosene to the PDS. 

 According to the National Council of Applied Economic Research, as much as 38.6 per cent of this kerosene is used in adulteration.

 Since both kerosene and diesel are middle distillates with similar ignition points, the two fuels can be mixed. Diesel is the highest selling fuel in the country with about 40 million tonnes sold annually. 

 The sale of petrol is about 8-9 million tonnes annually. Although some adulteration of petrol do take place with solvents and naphtha, the magnitude of the problem is much less. 

 Since diesel is consumed by the farm sector and trucks plying on highways, they are supplied by retail outlets located in relatively remote areas. Hence, it is difficult for oil firms to keep a tab on adulteration.

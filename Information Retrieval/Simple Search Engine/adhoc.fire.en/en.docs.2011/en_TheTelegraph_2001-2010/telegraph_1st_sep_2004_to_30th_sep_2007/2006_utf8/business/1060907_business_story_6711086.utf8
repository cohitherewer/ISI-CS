 Vivendi buys BMG in $2-billion deal

 A new tune

 London, Sept. 6 (Reuters): Vivendis Universal Music has agreed to buy BMG Music Publishing for 1.63 billion euros ($2.1 billion) in a long-expected deal that makes the worlds biggest seller of recorded music also the largest in music publishing. 

 German media conglomerate Bertelsmann AG, BMG Music Publishings parent company, also said on Wednesday it was settling litigation related to file-sharing service Napster that will see Vivendi receive $60 million. 

 Vivendi, the French media and telecom group, topped offers from six other bidders for BMG Music Publishing, which owns the rights to thousands of songs, including ones by Coldplay, Christina Aguilera and Barry Manilow. 

 It was seen as a frontrunner in the auction from the time it was tipped Bertelsmann would sell BMG earlier this year. A person close to the deal also told Reuters a deal was close on Tuesday. 

 Publishers have been increasingly coveted by investors because they are partly shielded by many of the piracy issues that have rattled the music industry. 

 In addition to generating revenue when CDs or downloads are sold, music publishers make money by licensing songs to be performed live and for use in films and television shows. 

 The acquisition of BMG Music Publishing is a unique opportunity to grow our music publishing business and enhance the value of Universal Music group at a time when the music market is improving, supported by technological innovations and digital sales, Vivendi chief executive Jean-Bernard Levy said. 

 Bertelsmann, which is selling its music publishing arm to help fund the 4.5-billion-euro buyback of a stake in the company, said the agreement would increase its net income by about 1 billion euros. 

 BMG, the worlds third-largest music publishing company, had 2005 revenue of 371 million euros, accounting for about 2 per cent of Bertelsmanns total.

 The deal price represents about a 9.6 multiple on BMGs net publishers share (NPS), the sectors most closely watched cashflow figure, according to figures supplied earlier by sources familiar with them. Bertelsmann did not disclose BMGs NPS. 

 It is a lower multiple than has been paid for other music publishers, although previous deals have been for much smaller businesses such as Acuff-Rose and Dreamworks.

 Also, copyrights to more and more songs are reverting back to songwriters or their heirs, reducing the future earnings of many catalogues. 

 For example, in 2013, copyrights granted to a publisher before 1957 and in 1978 can be terminated by a songwriter, and each year following, additional copyright grants can be terminated.

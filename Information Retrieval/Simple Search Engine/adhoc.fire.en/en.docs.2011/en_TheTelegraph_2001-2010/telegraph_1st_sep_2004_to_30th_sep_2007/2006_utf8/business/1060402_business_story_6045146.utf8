 General Motors close to selling unit

 Cash call 

 New York, April 1 (Reuters): The board of General Motors is edging toward a decision on whether to sell a controlling stake in General Motors Acceptance Corp. (GMAC), its financial services business, for about $11 billion, sources familiar with the negotiations said.

 A consortium that includes hedge fund Cerberus Capital Management LP and a private equity unit of Citigroup is viewed as a front runner for the GMAC stake.

 A deal could be announced as soon as Monday, but has not yet been approved by the GM board, the sources said.

 The sources said another investor group led by private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts amp; Co. is still interested in the GMAC stake, but that the Cerberus group is ahead at this stage.

 On March 23, a consortium of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, Five Mile Capital Partners LLC and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners bought 78 per cent of GMACs commercial mortgage unit, GMAC Commercial Holding Corp, for $1.5 billion and assumed $7.3 billion in debt owed to GMAC.

 A sale of a controlling stake in GMAC would help generate much-needed cash for GM, which earlier this month said its loss in 2005 was actually $10.6 billion ? $2 billion more than the company had previously reported.

 By comparison, GMAC, which provides automotive and commercial financing as well as mortgage and real estate services, earned $2.8 billion last year.

 GM said in October it wanted to sell a controlling stake in GMAC to a strategic partner in order to restore the financing units credit rating to investment-grade status.

 However, the sale of the stake has proved a complicated process. If GM is unable to structure a deal for the stake, it may opt to sell GMACs residential mortgage operation ResCap or another part of GMAC, analysts say.

 We are still actively engaged in pursuing a sale of a controlling interest in GMAC, said GMAC spokesperson Toni Simonetti.

 Simonetti would not confirm if the GM board would meet in coming days to consider the sale of the GMAC stake. There was no regularly scheduled April meeting, she said. 

 Cerberus, named after the three-headed watchdog in Greek mythology that guards the gates of hell, made its name as a distressed asset buyer and has grown to become one of the largest hedge fund traders and buyout firms in the world.

 Former US vice-president Dan Quayle chairs Cerberus Global Investments, a unit of the New York-based firm.

 Cerberus may secure some funding for the GMAC stake bid from its portfolio firms, including Aozora Bank of Japan, sources said. Japans Norinchukin Bank may also join the Cerberus bid.

 Despite the developments, some analysts remain sceptical whether the GMAC stake sale will be completed.

 GM on Tuesday filed its delayed annual report, restating financial results for several years and warned that there was no guarantee GM would succeed in selling a majority stake in GMAC.

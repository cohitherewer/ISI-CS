 Tesco sales meet forecast

 Buying Binge

 London, Dec. 5 (Reuters): Britains biggest retailer Tesco Plc met forecasts on Tuesday with a slower rise in UK sales in the third quarter but signalled it would continue to outstrip rivals going into the key Christmas trading period.

 Strategy and finance director Andrew Higginson said Tesco was looking good moving into the final three weeks of crucial Christmas trading amid warnings British retail faces one of its worst holiday shopping seasons on record.

 Theres all to play for, but so far so good, we are looking forward to having a good Christmas, he said.

 Underlying sales at Tescos core British business rose an expected 5.6 per cent in the 13 weeks to November 25, down from a 6.6 per cent pace in the second quarter, as price cuts and a boom in its online business failed to offset a subdued market.

 Its shares traded down 1.4 per cent at 392.65 pence by mid-morning, among the biggest fallers on the UKs benchmark FTSE-100 index. Last month, the stock touched a record high of 407-1/2 pence.

 Exane BNP Paribas analyst Tim Attenborough said Tesco has posted a very respectable set of numbers.

 But theyre in line and Tesco watchers over the years have become used to better than that, he said.

 Woolworths slip

 Tescos report came as sweets to entertainment retailer Woolworths said its full-year profit could plunge to less than half last years total after a poor start to Christmas trading, supporting some analyst predictions the high street could suffer its worst holiday season in a quarter of a century.

 The general-stores group said like-for-like sales in the 18 weeks to December 2 were down 6.5 per cent, with slow sales of Christmas products and lower prices for entertainment goods offsetting strong demand for toys.

 A spokeswoman said analysts full-year profit forecasts currently ranged from 27.6 million to 46.6 million. 

 In order to achieve results for this financial year around the lower end of market expectations, we will need to achieve a sales uplift for the remainder of the Christmas trading period and continued improvement in the margin, the firm said in a trading update.

 A spokeswoman said analysts full-year profit forecasts currently ranged from 27.6 million to 46.6 million.

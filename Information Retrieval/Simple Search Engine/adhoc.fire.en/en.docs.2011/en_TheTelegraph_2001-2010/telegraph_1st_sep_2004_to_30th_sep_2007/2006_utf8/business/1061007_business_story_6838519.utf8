 Marico set for African safari

 ARUNDHATI BAKSHI DIGHE 

 Mumbai, Oct. 6: Marico plans to leverage the opportunities generated by the acquisition of the Egyptian hair care brand, Fiance, to prise open the vast African market.

 Africa has always been a key market for us and we could be looking at countries such as Kenya and Tanzania and also countries that are around Egypt, Marico CFO Milind Sarwate told The Telegraph today. However, the company needs more information on African markets to take on established players, Sarwate added.

 He said the company was not only interested in Africa but also the markets of Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Philippines. 

 The companys earnings from its international businesses in 2006-07 is Rs 117 crore, which is almost 10 per cent of its revenues for the fiscal.

 However, the company, which has made five acquisitions in the last eighteen months, does not consider inorganic growth as its mainstay. It is just that the acquisitions have been of the high visibility types in the past we still believe more in organic growth. We have grown almost 20 per cent organically and inorganically it is between 17 and 18 per cent, Sarwate said. 

 The company has taken the acquisition route in countries having high import tariffs but with a sizeable domestic market.

 The Marico CFO said some countries have encouraged domestic industry by setting import tariffs at a high level. 

 In such countries, it makes sense for us to acquire a brand. If the market is sizeable and the brand has a good reach, we look at a possibility. The Egyptian brand, Fiance, was one such, he said. 

 Camellia and Aromatic, the two soap brands which the company acquired in Bangladesh, also fell in the same category. 

 In India, Marico has raised its market share in coconut oils to 60 per cent from 8 per cent after the acquisition of Nihar from HLL, while in perfumed hair oil its market share is 75 per cent. 

 Sarwate said the strategy in India was to acquire strong regional brands and market it to other regions. 

 The company acquired Manjal, a leader in Kerala, and marketed it in Tamil Nadu.

 Marico has 17 brands in the beauty and wellness segments, which are its main focus areas. Analysts expect Marico to report a growth of 20.9 per cent year on year.

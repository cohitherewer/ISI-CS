 Hutch plays the cash card for BPL Mobile

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Aug. 3: The Hutchison group today asserted in the Mumbai high court that it was ready to stump up another Rs 44 crore and close the deal on BPL Mobile Communications, but the Ruias said they werent interested and asserted their right to walk away from the deal.

 In January, Hutchison Essar signed an agreement with the Ruias to acquire and then merge BPL Mobile Communications, the cellular service provider for Mumbai, with itself. The deal fell apart last week after the department of telecommunications (DoT) failed to approve the merger by the July 31 deadline.

 Hutchison Telecom International Ltd has a 67 per cent stake in Hutchison Essar Ltd (HEL), while the Ruias of the Essar group hold another 33 per cent.

 The cracks in the relationship between the two warring partners in Hutchison Essar Ltd was all too evident today when the court heard the arbitration petition filed by Hutchison Essar Ltd (HEL) seeking to restrain the Essar group from selling BPL Mobile to a third party. Hutchison Essar argued that it wanted to close the deal and had the right to waive certain conditions in the sale agreement signed in January but the Ruias contested this assertion.

 The Ruias also alleged that Hutch had been trying to cripple BPL Mobile as a competitor. 

 Justice Nishita Mhatre, who heard arguments put forth by the counsel for both Hutch and Essar, later reserved her order for August 10. At the hearing that lasted for around four hours, Hutch lawyer Iqbal Chagla submitted to the court that the joint venture was willing to pay the remaining amount of Rs 44 crore to complete the BPL Mobile merger deal. HEL, he said, had already deposited an amount of Rs 1,616 crore.

 In its petition, Hutch submitted that a dispute had arisen between the parties to the share purchase agreement even though Hutch had the right to waive certain conditions.

 It pointed out that under the agreement, the vendors (BPL Communications) right was only to receive the agreed purchase consideration. Hutch Essar, it added, has already paid 97.5 per cent of the said consideration and was ready to pay the remaining amount. 

 The petition noted that Hutch Essar had the right to sell the shares in question to a third party after ensuring that the Essar group had received the agreed purchase consideration. 

 The Essar group, however, contested Hutchisons stand and argued that an onerous condition relating to a regulatory approval could not be waived, much less unilaterally by Hutch Essar. Permission from DoT was a joint obligation of Hutch Essar and BPL Mobile Communications, it argued.

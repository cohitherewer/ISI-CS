 Please-all formula for ore exports

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 New Delhi, Sept. 19: The tug-of-war over ore exports between rival lobbies has yielded the strands of a compromise formula that proposes not a ban but a cap on exports of this scarce resource. The proposal, at a nebulous stage, however, could lead to the phasing out of exports of high-grade lump iron ore. 

 The other possible spin-off of the tussle over exports between ore exporters and the domestic steel industry is provisions in the iron-ore policy for FDI in mining and auction of reserves rather than the less transparent process of allocating the resource.

 The new formula seeks to balance the conflicting views held by ore exporters and steel makers on the draft national mineral policy the committee to make the recommendations was chaired by Planning Commission member Anwarul Hoda that favours freeing of exports.

 Senior government officials said unrestricted exports, particularly of high-grade ore, could hurt domestic steel majors in the long run. A contest over scarce raw materials is emerging. We cant just go ahead and give away our strategic reserves of high-class ore even as others are doing the opposite, senior officials in the Planning Commission said.

 The commission is veering towards a policy that makes it mandatory for foreign importers to set up steel plants in India. The aim should be to encourage value-added exports ... let them convert ore into steel for their car-making or other needs here itself, officials said. 

 The Left, too, feels that Indian companies should get first priority over the ore.

 The officials, however, feel that a blanket ban is unjustified as the reserves are sufficient to meet the demand of both steel makers and exporters. The officials estimate the reserves to be 25.24 billion tonnes; of which a mere 531 million tonnes were exploited between 2000 and 2005.

 After considering these pros and cons of the proposal to ban exports, the officials favour a cap.

 The officials said the present norm of allocating ore either on the basis of MoUs or investment commitments in a state does not yield the best price for the resource and does not help in attracting FDI in mines.

 The states are losing out and many players are getting access to rich mines merely on the basis of vague promises. The central government could try build a consensus with ore rich states to evolve a system of auctioning of ore reserves for both captive consumption as well as for independent mining, officials said. They admit that the proposal may not satisfy some steel makers who may try to scuttle it.

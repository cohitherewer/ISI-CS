 Commodity prices to simmer down

 Aluminium and copper prices rose to two-month and one-month highs respectively last week before profit-taking set in. Metal prices are now well above the depths they plumbed in mid-May, when a wave of selling in commodities set the stage for the crash in the stock market. But will the bounce last? What is the outlook for commodities in the long-term? Will prices go even higher? These are some of the tough questions that two international financial institutions attempted to tackle recently.

 The Asian Development Bank (ADB) was first off the mark when it released the update to its Asian Development Outlook for 2006. It includes long-term forecasts for commodity prices to 2015. If the price levels for 2005 are taken as the base, the ADB predicts that the prices of practically all commodities will be lower in 2015. Forestry and fishery products are the only items that are projected to have prices higher in 2015 than in 2005. And this trend towards lower prices for most commodities occurs despite the big impact that the economies of China and India are having on commodity prices. The ADB obviously believes that prices have already gone up too far too fast. The reason for the fall in prices is simple higher commodity prices will coax out higher supply. Chevrons huge oil discovery in the Gulf of Mexico is a case in point, as is the rapid addition of refinery capacity in the Persian Gulf area. Clearly, the ADB believes that current levels of commodity prices, including crude oil prices, are unsustainable. It projects the price of crude oil per barrel at a low $43 in 2015.

 The IMF is of the same opinion. Chapter 5 of its World Economic Outlook is titled: The Boom in non-fuel commodity prices can it last? It believes that over the medium term, metals prices are expected to retreat from recent highs as new capacity comes on stream, although probably not falling back to earlier levels in part because higher energy prices have increased production costs. That said, the timing and the speed of the price reversal is uncertain, because with current high capacity utilisation rates and low inventories, markets are very sensitive to even small changes in supply and demand. For 2006, non-energy commodity prices are expected to rise on an average by about 21 per cent, according to World Bank estimates. In 2007, the IMF says prices are expected to decline moderately (about 5 per cent), because supply is improving rapidly. In other words, while commodity prices may be volatile in the short-run, they are headed downwards in the long-term.

 Global growth

 The ADB and the IMF also have similar perceptions about global growth both are warning that it will slow in 2007. The IMF is the more pessimistic, warning of a one-in-six chance of growth falling below 3.25 per cent. The European Commission, however, believes that growth in Europe will be only slightly lower in 2007 than in 2006. As for India, the ADB has upped its projection for 2006 to 7.8 per cent, a rate of growth that it forecasts will continue in 2007. In short, while global growth will slow next year, India will continue to do well. So far, emerging markets have depended on conditions in the US as far as fund flows are concerned. Well soon know whether fund flows to faster-growing countries like India can decouple from conditions in the US.

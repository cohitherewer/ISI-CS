 China queers gas-deal pitch

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Jan. 10: China has stolen the march over India on the Myanmar gas front. While the home team was busy bargaining over the price of the gas, PetroChina has signed an MoU with the Myanmar authorities for lifting 6.5 trillion cubic feet (tcf) from the A1 block.

 The gas is proposed to be supplied by an overland pipeline to the adjoining Kunming province in China from the offshore gas field in Myanmar.

 The Indian delegation negotiating with the Myanmar authorities were taken by surprise when they were told that an MoU had already been signed with Petrochina last month. The gas will be supplied over a period of 30 years. 

 India was aware that the Myanmar authorities were talking to the Chinese company but they had not expected the deal to come through. The delegation had to cut short its visit. Some members have returned home, while the others have proceeded to China as part of petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyars delegation to Beijing.

 This is not the first time the Chinese have beat India in oil and gas deals. Given their deep pockets, the Chinese companies can afford to spend more and clinch the deals.

 ONGC-Videsh and GAIL have a 30 per cent stake in the A1 block, but this share is not sufficient to go in for a pipeline to bring the gas, a senior OVL official told The Telegraph. 

 Myanmar is also supplying natural gas to Thailand through an overland pipeline and had wanted India to pay the same price. However, India was not willing to pay more than $3.5 million per mbtu as the power sector would not find it commercially viable. 

 With international prices of crude oil going through the roof, natural gas prices have been moving in tandem and Myanmar had reason to further harden its stand.

 India was banking on the fact that Myanmar would come round as India presented a huge market for gas over the long run. But that applies to China and moreover, it is willing to pay more. 

 South Koreas Daewoo is the operator at the A-1 block. OVL has a 20 per cent share, while GAIL owns 10 per cent. However, the Myanmar government is entitled to the major chunk of the gas in the block as part of the production sharing deal.

 India had proposed to build a $1-billion 290-km trunk line from the west coast of Myanmar to Bengal via Bangladesh to import gas from the A-1 block and possible reserves in the adjacent A-3 block, in which OVL and GAIL also hold a 30 per cent stake. The government had also planned to use the Myanmar-Bangladesh-India pipeline to bring stranded gas in the north-east to consumption centres.

 Commercial production from A-1 block, located in the Shwe field is expected to commence by 2009.

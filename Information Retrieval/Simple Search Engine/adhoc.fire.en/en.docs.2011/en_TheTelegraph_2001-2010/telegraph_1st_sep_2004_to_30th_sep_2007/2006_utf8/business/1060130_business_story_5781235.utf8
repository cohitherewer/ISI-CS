 Orissa turns heat on Reliance Energy

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, Jan. 29: The Orissa Electricity Regulatory Commission (OERC) has initiated proceedings to suspend the licences of Reliance Energys three distribution companies ? Nesco, Southco and Wesco ? for violating the terms and conditions of the electricity distribution licence.

 The three distribution companies ? Western Electricity Supply Company of Orissa Limited (Wesco), North Eastern Electricity Supply Company of Orissa Limited (Nesco), Southern Electricity Supply Company of Orissa Limited (Southco) ? cater to 2.72 crore customers over an area of 123,000 square kilometre. 

 In an interim order on Friday, the commission issued notices to Nesco, Southco and Wesco asking them to file affidavits by March 1, 2006 and fixed March 8 as the next date for hearing.

 Prima facie, they (distribution companies) have violated the terms and condition of their respective licences, and it is necessary in the public interest to suspend the licences and appoint an administrator for each of the licencee to discharge the functions, the order stated. 

 On September 3 last year, Sarat Chandra Mohanty, the president of Nikhila Orissa Bidyut Shramik Mahasangh, had petitioned the commission to cancel the licences of the three distribution companies of Reliance Energy on the ground that they were not arranging funds, increasing manpower and streamlining the management, thus violating the terms and conditions of the licences. 

 The commission viewed that the three distribution companies are unable to discharge the functions or perform the duties imposed on them under the provisions of the Electricity Act, 2003 and have persistently defaulted in complying with the directions given by it.

 The commission appointed three special officers and a few other persons to assist them to monitor the operation of the three companies and file a status report on their activities and management.

 Former Gridco director S.P. Ghosh, senior general manager P.N. Bisoi and joint director (engineering) of OERC, D.K. Satpathy, have been appointed as special officers for Nesco, Southco and Wesco, respectively.

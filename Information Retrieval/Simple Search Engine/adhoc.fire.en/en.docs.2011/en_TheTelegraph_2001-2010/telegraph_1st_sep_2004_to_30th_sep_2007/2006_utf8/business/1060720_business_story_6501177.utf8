 Deora rules out hike in oil prices

 Deora: Showing the way

 New Delhi, July 19: Petroleum minister Murli Deora today ruled out an increase in prices of petroleum products at home even though crude has soared past the $70-per-barrel mark globally. 

 There is no question of going in for a price hike at present, the minister said.

 The relentless increase in international crude prices has hit the national oil companies, which are losing even more money than they did at the time of the last price hike in early June.

 Although the government had taken a decision that the oil companies would be allowed to raise petrol and diesel prices if the average price of crude went above $70 per barrel, it is not easy to implement such rate hikes because of political reasons.

 The oil companies, however, are looking for the governments signal to increase prices as they are losing heavily on the sales of LPG, kerosene, petrol and diesel. 

 Meanwhile, Deora told members of the parliamentary consultative committee that the government of Assam has decided to reduce the sales tax on the increase in auto fuels to the tune of Rs 0.69 per litre for petrol and Rs 0.29 for diesel.

 He said Assam joins eight other state governments ? Andhra Pradesh, Delhi, Goa, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Uttranchal ? who have reduced the sales tax on petrol and diesel following his appeal.

 Deora said other states should also reduce the increased component of sales tax for the benefit of consumers.

 Global crude rates

 Oil prices sagged today as traders held the view that Israels offensive with Lebanon would not engulf the region, and ahead of fresh US crude inventories data, dealers said.

 New Yorks light sweet crude for delivery in August, fell 41 cents to $73.13 per barrel before the official opening of the US market. In London, Brent North Sea crude for September delivery dropped 30 cents to $74.06 per barrel.

 Intel revenue forecast cut

 Rough patch

 New York, March 4 (Reuters): Intel Corp. cut its revenue forecast on Friday amid weaker-than-expected demand and a loss of market share to rival chip maker Advanced Micro Devices Inc. 

 AMD, a much smaller company that has traditionally trailed Intel, has recently pressured the chip giant with technological gains that have given it an edge in performance and power use, especially in the market for servers that run businesses.

 Shares of Intel, the worlds biggest semiconductor maker, fell as much as 3 per cent to a 17-month low before mostly recovering. 

 It was the biggest drag on both the S amp;P 500 index and the Nasdaq. AMD shares rose initially then fell nearly 4 per cent on fears that it, too, would be hit by weak demand.

 The technology bellwethers warning confirmed concerns voiced in recent weeks by analysts, some of whom lowered profit forecasts for Intel because of tougher competition.

 This may say more about Intels competitive position against AMD than it does about some broad-based slowdown in the technology arena, said Rick Meckler, president of LibertyView Management.

 ThinkEquity analyst Eric Ross expects the market share losses mark the start of a long-term struggle for Intel.

 Next quarter is going to be just as difficult (and) market share losses are going to continue, said Ross, who put a sell rating on Intel shares two weeks ago.

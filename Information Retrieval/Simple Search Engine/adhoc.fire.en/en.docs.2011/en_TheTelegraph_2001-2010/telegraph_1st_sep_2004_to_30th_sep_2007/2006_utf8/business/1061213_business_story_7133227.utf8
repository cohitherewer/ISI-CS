The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Spotlight on Standard Life in Corus battle

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Support system

 Calcutta, Dec. 12: Tata Steel may be seeking the help of Standard Life Investment, the largest shareholder of Corus, to support its bid and thwart CSNs aim to acquire the Anglo-Dutch steelmaker.

 Standard Life, which holds a 7.8 per cent stake in Corus, had come out strongly against Tatas first offer of 455 pence, saying it was lower than expectation.

 When contacted, a Standard Life spokesperson neither confirmed nor denied whether Tata Steel had sought its help in its bid for Corus.

 We are clearly in a competitive situation, said David Cumming, head of UK equities for Standard Life Investments, in a statement. We will await developments. 

 When asked if an approach had been made from the Tatas and the nature of assistance sought by them, the spokesperson told The Telegraph: We dont tend to comment on who we are meeting and if so what the nature of that meeting is.

 Tata Steel also did not comment on the overture.

 Industry observers believed that Tata Steel might seek Standard Lifes backing in case there is a matching bid with CSN for Corus.

 Tata Steel had raised its bid on Sunday to 500 pence only to be topped within hours with a 515 pence offer by the Brazilian steelmaker on Monday.

 The development gains significance given that CSN and its associates now hold close to 20 per cent stake in Corus. CSN itself holds a 3.8 per cent stake in the London-headquartered company.

 UBS and Goldman Sachs Group, who are advisors to CSN, and Barclays, which is part of the banking syndicate financing the bid, had in their latest filing with the London Stock Exchange revealed they held 7.36 per cent, 4.01 per cent and 4.2 per cent stake respectively in Corus. 

 Compared to this, neither the Tata group nor its associates, have any significant stake in Corus.

 In case of a tie in the price offer, it could be anybodys guess who the UBS, Goldman Sachs Group or Barclays would be supporting even as they maintained that asset management business, through which they hold stakes in Corus, and advisory role are separate.

 Industry observers pointed out that if Standard Life Investment came on board, it would help the Tatas pre-empt CSN, which had mounted a bid to take over Corus in 2002 that fell apart.

 Tata Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Tata Sons, holds 2,125 Corus shares. However, as these Corus shares are held either by members of the Tata Steel group or by Tata Limited, they are excluded from the definition of scheme shares.

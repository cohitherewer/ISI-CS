 L amp;T in pact with Swedish truck outfit

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Sept. 11: Larsen amp; Toubro Ltd (L amp;T) has joined hands with Swedish heavy vehicle company Scania to distribute its multi-axle trucks in India. 

 The heavy-duty trucks will cater to the construction and mining sectors. According to L amp;T, they will complement its range of hydraulic excavators that are widely used in mining and construction projects around the country. 

 Robust construction activities in recent times have raised demands for heavy trucks. Around 2,500 trucks catering to construction and mining are sold every year.

 Scania, with a turnover of $8.8 billion, is a leading manufacturer of trucks of capacities exceeding 16 tonnes. It also makes heavy-duty buses and engines for mining, power generation and marine applications. About a million Scania vehicles operate in Europe, Latin America, Asia, Africa and Australia. 

 It also manufactures industrial and marine engines. 

 L amp;T today said the tie-up with Scania will strengthen its presence in mining and construction. The companys offerings to these sectors include a broad range of hydraulic excavators, loader backhoes, vibratory compactors, aggregate crushing systems, stacker-reclaimers and surface miners. The trucks will be imported and sold through L amp;Ts distribution network for mining and construction equipment. L amp;T will, however, not invest in any equity at this stage. 

 A Scania statement said it targets the Indian construction segment, where there is an increasing demand for robust European heavy trucks with a high technical content.

 By adding Scanias multi-wheeler construction trucks to its product portfolio, L amp;T can offer its mining and construction customers a full range of construction equipment, said Scanias president and CEO Leif stling. 

 He added that India will become a significant market for Scania in future, considering the steadily growing economy, the development of the export industry and continued expansion of the motorway and logistics infrastructure.

 Calcutta, Jan. 9: Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation is ready to promote the Bengal government?s proposed chemical hub at Haldia to the global investing community. 

 The $20-billion company offered to help out the state after it decided to set up a second unit of its own in Haldia. The Japanese giant operates in 50 countries and has a huge network among the global chemical business community.

 The company will use its network to promote Haldia as an investment destination for chemical and petrochemical- based industries.

 ?Mitsubishi Chemical has a global presence. We interact with many people in the chemical trade. We will spread the good word about Haldia to them,? an official said.

 A high-level team from Mitsubishi Chemical was in the city today to formally announce the investment proposal for the second unit of purified terephthalic acid, a raw material for polyester products.

 The team met chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and industry minister Nirupam Sen at Writers? Buildings.

 Bhattacharjee said Haldia was emerging as an industrial hub with a special focus on the chemical and petrochemicals industry.

 ?It is a red letter day for the state. I am very happy,? he said.

 Mitsubishi Chemical was initially apprehensive about the infrastructure at the port town. However, it feels the state is taking steps to improve facilities. ?The government is very supportive,? the official added.

 Mitsubishi Chemical wants the road and port to be further developed. ?The port is big but more vessels will call once the chemical hub comes up. We have been telling the Centre and the state to look into it,? he said.

 Mitsubishi Chemical will also share its experiences with the state to help it develop the right model for a chemical hub. Observers feel the company?s decision to more than double the capacity in Haldia will attract more investment.

 WBIDC role

 The state has agreed to invest in the proposed $370-million expansion plan of MCC PTA. It holds a 5 per cent stake in the company through West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation. MCC wanted the corporation to keep the stake in its Indian venture by contributing in its expanded equity.

 Industry gets right cooking gas wrongs

 Calcutta, April 9: Oil companies have put a brake on the illegal diversion of domestic LPG for industrial use.

 Since price of LPG for households is heavily subsidised by the Centre and industrial consumers paid the higher market price, diversion was rampant causing shortage of the gas in homes.

 However, oil companies have largely checked this practice after they initiated a demand management exercise following the shortage of LPG in September last year.

 In that period, oil companies led by Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) accepted new bookings only three weeks after delivery of the last cylinder.

 The then petroleum minister, Mani Shankar Aiyar, had put the lid on the illegal diversion and urged state governments to impose stiff penalties against such practices.

 Though the crisis had ended soon after, oil companies have persisted with the three-week waiting period with encouraging results.

 In Calcutta alone, use of industrial LPG has increased two-and-a-half times since September.

 LPG demand from IOC by industrial consumers in Calcutta went up to 288.19 tonnes a month in March 2006 compared with an average demand of 129.11 tonnes a month between September 2004 and March 2005.

 In the Bengal circle, demand between Septemeber 2005 and March 2006 increased from 165 tonnes a month to 385 tonnes.

 These figures show that diversion has been checked to a large extent. Volumes could not have gone up so much otherwise, an IOC official said.

 During the same period, sale of domestic LPG has also gone up. 

 However, growth in new customers has far outpaced that in sales. 

 IOC has the largest share in the LPG business in the country.

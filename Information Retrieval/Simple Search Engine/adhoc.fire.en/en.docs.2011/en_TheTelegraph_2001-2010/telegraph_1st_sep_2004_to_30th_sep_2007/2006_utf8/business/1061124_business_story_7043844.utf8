 Mumbai/Calcutta, Nov. 23: Tata Steel honchos went into a huddle today to decide whether or not to up the ante in the high-stakes battle with Companhia Siderurgica Nacional (CSN) of Brazil for Anglo-Dutch steelmaker Corus.

 Last week, CSN trumped Tatas offer with a tentative offer of 475 pence per share. The Tatas had tabled a bid of 455 pence that valued Corus at $8.1 billion.

 The Tata Steel board has reportedly decided to raise its offer but is extremely squeamish about getting into a protracted bidding war.

 The board meeting today lasted almost three hours, but officials were tightlipped about the outcome.

 The meeting was attended by the top brass of the company, including chairman Ratan Tata and managing director B Muthuraman.

 Available information suggests that the Tatas will prefer to play a waiting game. Although the Tatas may raise the bid from their original offer price of 455 pence per share, this will only be done after CSN comes up with a formal offer.

 The buzz is that CSN will wait till the end of next week, giving the Tatas very little time to respond before the crucial December 4 extra-ordinary general meeting where the Corus shareholders will vote on the Tata offer.

 Investment banking sources said the Tatas were likely to first match the offer made by CSN. This will tilt the balance slightly in their favour as they have already won the approval from Corus on October 20 for their proposal to create the worlds fifth-largest steelmaker.

 There are indications that the Tatas may seek a firm commitment of support from Corus, if they decide to raise the bid. When contacted, a Corus spokesperson declined to comment on this development. 

 According to the City Code of Takeovers and Mergers of UK, the Corus board can recommend only one offer. In case Corus backs CSN, it has to pay a separation fee. 

 In the meantime, CSN today said its a better fit for Corus. Tata is a nice fit for Corus, but we think that we probably are the best fit, Jose Marcos Treiger, CSNs head of investor relations, said in Amsterdam today.

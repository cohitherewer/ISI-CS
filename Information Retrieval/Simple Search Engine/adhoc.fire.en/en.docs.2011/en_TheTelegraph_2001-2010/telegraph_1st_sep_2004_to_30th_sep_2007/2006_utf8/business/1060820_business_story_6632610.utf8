 Mittal choice limited to four Orissa sites

 PRABUDDHA S JAGADEB

 Bhubaneswar, Aug. 19: Mittal Steel is now zeroing in on four possible locations for its proposed 12-million-tonne integrated steel plant in Orissa. 

 The company had earlier picked seven sites but the list was pruned following the submission of the feasibility report of Mecon earlier this week.

 After the announcement of the steel project in Orissa last month, Mittal Steel honchos made aerial surveys of seven proposed sites in Balagopalpur and Somnathpur tahsils of Balasore district, Chudamani tahsil in Bhadrak district, Khallikote and Kanisi tahsils in Ganjam district and Patna and Champua tahsils in Keonjhar district. 

 Most of these sites are located adjacent to ports like Dhamra, Gopalpur and Bahabalpur.

 The company officials then went back and asked Mecon to do a technical feasibility study to assess the viability of a steel plant.

 The fours sites suggested by the Mecon study are Patna in Keonjhar, Basudevpur in Bhadrak, Balgopalpur in Balasore and Khallikote of Ganjam, said state steel and mines secretary L. N. Gupta.

 Mittals India CEO Sanak Mishra, however, said the company might look for more sites before it conveys its land requirement to the state government. 

 These are Mecons preliminary assessment and we may still look at more possible locations, Mishra told The Telegraph.

 Mishra said before finalising the site we will look at physical factors such as land, water and connectivity as well as non-physical factors such as environmental impact and displacement.

 The CEO, however, said an MoU may still be some time away and refused to give a date. 

 We will talk to the task force of the state government about the sites and try to finalise the date. This is going to be a huge plant and we want to do things in a transparent manner. In fact this is the company policy and we are getting good co-operation from the state government, he said.

 Gupta said Mecons choice of four likely sites is a positive development. They have cited the suitability of the sites for the plants and we shall do everything to see that Mittals get the land they need.

 Sources said that among the four sites, Balgopalpur in Balasore looked most favourable. The site is unhindered, unobstructed, not forested and not encroached. It is not within a flood-prone zone.It has rail links, connecting Balasore to Nilagiri passing through the proposed site and excellent road connectivity, said a state government official.

 The company has been offered around 5,640 acres of encroachment-free land in Balgopalpur. Besides it is only 65 km from Dhamra port.

 CII to list top 10 growth glitches

 GARIMA SINGH amp; GAURAV CHOUDHURY 

New Delhi, April 23: The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) is preparing a 10-point action plan to be placed before the government shortly.

 We are in the process of finalising the action plan and will present it to finance minister P. Chidambaram in the first week of May. The action plan will identify obstacles to growth and include an array of suggestion to sustain the current momentum, newly elected CII president R. Seshasayee told The Telegraph.

 Chidambaram is expected to meet industry captains in the first week of May to discuss issues relating to the economy.

 The decision to meet corporate honchos was taken by the minister during his immediate post-budget interactions with India Inc held under the aegis of the CII last month.

 Seshasayee said there were several contentious issues, which the industry chamber would take up with the government. Besides the job quota issue, which has assumed a political centre-stage in recent days, the CII president said there were other areas such as labour laws, disinvestment and privatisation of mining that would be discussed with the minister.

 We sincerely feel that the mining sector holds the key to Indias growth momentum. We have to find ways of using our fossil fuel resources optimally to meet the energy demands commensurate with the anticipated growth, he said.

 Although the CII has been in favour of allowing privatisation of the mining sector, it may be recalled that the Left parties have voiced its opposition in no uncertain terms.

 Labour law is another contentious issue. For some reason or the other, flexible labour laws have become synonymous with the notion of hire-and-fire. This is not the true picture. Flexible labour laws will only help in multiplying employment opportunities in the organised sector, Seshasayee said.

 On corporate governance, he said, it has taken roots in India but it is an evolving process. Citing the example of independent directors, he said, Independence is a cultural issue. The critical question is how much the promoters of companies deem themselves as trustees of the entities. The emphasis should be on value brand leadership and this cannot be prescribed by any arithmetic formulae or law.

 Tea auction sales beat retreat

 SOHINI MOOKHERJEA

 Calcutta, Oct. 25: The volume of tea sold at various auction centres between January and August has dipped considerably compared with last year, while the unit price has appreciated, according to the latest figures compiled by the Tea Board. 

 This comes at a time when the Tea Board and the commerce ministry have set a target to route 100 per cent tea through auctions by the next one year and revive the e-auction system.

 Four north Indian auction centres together sold 179.14 million kg between January and August compared with 204.06 million kg during the same period last year.

 South Indian auction centres of Cochin, Coimbatore and Coonoor sold 93.09 million kg last year between January and August compared with 87.74 million kg this year.

 Since auctions handle only loose tea in bulk packages, those in packets are traded privately. However, the sale of bulk package privately is also becoming an important primary marketing channel. This, coupled with drought-like conditions resulting in crop losses, have resulted in lower volumes at auction centres, a source said.

 The drop in volume was marked by a sharp price correction. The price per kg for north Indian tea, which stood at Rs 64.74 in 2005 between January and August, rose to Rs 72.30 per kg during the same period.

 South Indian tea, which fetched a unit price of Rs 43.37 per kg, also shot up to Rs 50.13 per kg.

 However, globally, the average auction price at the Indian centres was one of the lowest at $1.44 per kg. The average price was $2.03 per kg at Mombassa and $1.85 per kg at Colombo.

 The drop in quantities sold was sharper in north Indian centres like Calcutta, Guwahati, Siliguri and Jalpaiguri. The volume in Jalpaiguri dropped by 75 per cent from 0.5 million kg last year to 0.1 million kg during the same period this year.

 Buyers in north Bengal prefer the older auction centre of Siliguri instead of the newer one at Jalpaiguri with the former registering a marginal drop of 6.6 per cent.

 Discussions are on to set up a 60 to 70-acre tea park with the help of the state government between Jalpaiguri and Siliguri to resolve this problem. The park will have common warehousing, auction and other facilities that could be used by both the centres.

 Calcutta, which is the oldest centre and hosted its first auction in 1861, has recently got the hardware in place to launch the e-auction system.

 Currently, 50 per cent of domestic tea is sourced through auctions, 10 per cent through e-auctions and the best quality tea is often privately sold, Union minister of state for commerce and industry Jairam Ramesh had said.

 The government is keen to popularise the auction system as it offers the most transparent price discovery mechanism.

 Conoor operates on 100 per cent electronic mode, while manual switching is allowed in Coimbatore and Kochi. The Siliguri centre was mired in e-auction usage charge dispute four months after the inauguration in 2004.

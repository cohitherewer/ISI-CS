 Calcutta, Feb. 7: Bharti Tele-Ventures Ltd plans to launch fixed telephony services in the city under the Airtel brand from April.

 The company will start the services on a modest scale with 50,000 lines. They will offer it at competitive rates and bundled with the handset manufactured at the company?s plants in Goa and Punjab.

 ?The strategy for the fixed-phone service is different and it is city-specific rather than circles and the requirement for different city varies. Airtel is currently present in 75 cities, which is set to go up to 85 cities,? said Rajan Mittal, joint managing director, Bharti Tele-Ventures.

 The groundwork for copper-based connections has been going on. While broadband services is present in a limited scale, it will be launched after the fixed-line services.

 The company has already invested Rs 980 crore in Calcutta and Bengal and plans to invest another Rs 1,100 crore in the next one year. On the whole, for the eastern region it has invested Rs 700 crore, which is slated to go up to Rs 1,800 crore during the same time.

 ?The rapid growth in the region has led us to set up our eastern region headquarters in the city,? Mittal added.

 Bharti has been given a 3-acre plot in Nonadanga, off the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass where the state urban development authorities plan to set up the single largest 70-acre south eastern central business development (CBD) project for institutional and commercial purposes, including schools, hospitals, eco-friendly industries and others, said Ashok Bhattacharya, state urban development minister.

 About 10 acres from this project has been given to the information technology (IT) department.

 The IT department has given the land to Bharti on a 99-year lease at a price of Rs 1.2 crore per acre.

 A new road connecting Nonadanga directly to the EM Bypass is also being constructed, Bhattacharya added.

 Demat put on the mat

 For those entrapped by the IPO scam, Chandralekha Tulal provides clues to find a new depository participant

 Every scam that rocks the market sends retail investors scrambling to protect the hard-earned money that they have invested.

 Nothing can be more galling for them than to find that the long hours they spent in the queues to hand in their applications for a handful of shares in a public flotation were wasted because some clever manipulators had used a variety of stratagems to corner the shares.

 The latest Sebi order, which unearthed the extent of the scam and the people responsible for it, brings some relief to the man on the street.

 But the punishment meted out to Karvy and Pratik depository participants (DP) also means that their clients now have to find another DP within the next 15 days.

 Here is an FAQ to explain what you need to do.

 Which are the other DPs I can go to?

 Apart from imposing a ban on Karvy and Pratik Stock Vision, the regulator has directed 12 other entities to desist from opening fresh demat accounts. They are HDFC Bank, Dindayal Biyani Stock Brokers, Centurion Bank of Punjab, Infrastructure Leasing amp; Financial Services, Wellworth Shares and Stock Broking, Motilal Oswal Securities, Khandwala Int Fin Services, IDBI Bank, Jhaveri Securities, ING Vysya Bank, Pravin Ratilal Share amp; Stock Broking and Infinite Financial Services.

 However, the National Securities Depository Ltd (NSDL) has close to 300 registered DPs, while the Central Depository Services Ltd (CSDL) has over 550. Their names and addresses are provided on the websites of NSDL and CDSL. Names of some of the more visible ones are mentioned in the table.

 Can I open a demat account with any DP?

 Technically, you can. However, many DPs have their own terms and conditions for accepting clients. For example, an ICICI Direct applicant has to take a demat account along with a trading and savings bank account. 

 Some banks which are DPs only allow their clients to open demat accounts with them, such as HSBC.

 Should I first close my account with Karvy or Pratik?

 No, Sebi has given 15 days during which your account remains active. So, before closing your existing account with Karvy or Pratik, open a new one with another DP and transfer your shares to that account.

 What are the costs I have to incur?

 DPs do not charge any account opening fees. However, you have to pay an annual account maintenance fee, which again varies across DPs. It would depend on your relationship with the DP. In the case of banks, it would depend on whether you maintain an account with them.

 I have two demat accounts, one with Karvy and the other with HDFC Bank, which has been directed not to open fresh accounts. Where does that leave me?

 HDFC Bank has just been instructed not to open fresh accounts. However, the existing account holders can continue to operate them. Thus, you can just transfer your shares from your Karvy account to the HDFC Bank account. This way you won?t have to open another account. Any investor, who has multiple accounts, can just transfer their shares.

 How do I close my account with Karvy or Pratik?

 You have to request for an account closing form and fill out the necessary details.

 How long does it take to open a new account? Are 15 days sufficient?

 A typical account opening procedure takes one to five days. It will take another 24 hours to transfer your shares from one account to another. Therefore, the 15 days should be sufficient as it means working days and does not include holidays.

 What are the documents required to open an account?

 You have to submit proofs of identity and residence and a photograph along with a duly completed application form. Execute the DP-investor agreement to be made available by the DP. Most importantly, Sebi has now made the submission of PAN card details mandatory while opening an account. So, be sure to carry your PAN card. PAN cards are required for all the members in a joint account.

 Will the DP give me any documents?

 Your DP will give you a copy of the signed DP-investor agreement for your record, which will contain the rights and obligations of both the parties and the fee structure. It will also give you a Client ID once your demat account is opened. This Client ID along with your DP ID number forms a unique combination. Both these numbers should be quoted in all your stock dealings. You will also get instruction slips for depository services like dematerialisation and delivery instruction for trades. These slips will bear pre-printed serial numbers and your client-ID pre-stamped. Preserve these carefully. You will also get a list of deadlines for giving instructions for depository activities like transfer for effecting sale and purchase.

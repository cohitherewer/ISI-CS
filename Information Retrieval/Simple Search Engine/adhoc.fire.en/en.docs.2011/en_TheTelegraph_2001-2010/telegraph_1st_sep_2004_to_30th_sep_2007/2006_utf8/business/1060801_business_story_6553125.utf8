 Murugappa pulls out of Orissa project 

 DEBABRATA MOHANTY

 Bhubaneswar, July 31: The Murugappa group has dropped its plan for a 3-million-tonne greenfield steel project in the Kalinganagar industrial complex of Jajpur.

 The board of Tube Investments of India (TII), a group outfit, in its meeting yesterday decided not to proceed with the steel project and announced its withdrawal from the MoU signed with the Orissa government in April last year. TII has reported a profit of Rs 89.46 crore in the first quarter of this fiscal.

 The group, with a turnover of Rs 5,200 crore and factories in 12 states, has a strong presence in farm inputs, engineering and cycles, sugar, abrasives, finance, general insurance, sanitaryware, plantations, bio-products and nutraceuticals.

 A senior group official said nothing much had happened on the project after the company inked the MoU. Under the agreement, the group was to build a 3-million-tonne unit at Kalinga Nagar in Duburi by 2009 at a cost of Rs 3,480 crore. The group also planned to set up a 60-megawatt captive power plant on 2,500 acres.

 Company sources said the project in Orissa would have been implemented through an independent overseas company with expertise in steel making. With the partner showing little interest, the group shelved its plan as steel making is not a core competence of the group.

 Regarding withdrawal of the MoU, Orissa steel and mines secretary L.N. Gupta said, We have not received any official communication from them. Steel and mines department officials said the company did not choose the site for the steel plant. Early this month, the company along with six others who had signed MoUs were sent show cause notices by the state government for poor progress.

 The state has signed 43 MoUs for as many steel plants with a projected output of over 58 million tonnes. Steel and mines minister Padmanabha Behera said the state has decided to cancel the MoU of Maharashtra Seamless, which had proposed to set up a 0.48-million-tonne steel plant at Kalinganagar in Duburi.

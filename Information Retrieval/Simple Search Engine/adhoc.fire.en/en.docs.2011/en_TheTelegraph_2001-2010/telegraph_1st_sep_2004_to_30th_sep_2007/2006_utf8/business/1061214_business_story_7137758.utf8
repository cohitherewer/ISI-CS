 Oil duo poised to get Yemen blocks

 In good company

 New Delhi, Dec. 13: The Indian Oil Corporation-Oil India combine has emerged as the frontrunner for two oil exploration blocks in Yemen as part a consortium led by PT Medco Energi Internasional of Indonesia.

 A senior Indian Oil official told The Telegraph that the Indian duo had put in a joint bid with the Indonesian oil firm and Kuwait Energy Co.

 Medco, which will have a 45 per cent stake in the two blocks, 82 and 83, will be the operator. The two blocks are reported to be located in close vicinity of other producing fields. Kuwait Energy Co will hold the remaining 25 per cent stake.

 Like the Indian companies ONGC-Videsh, OIL and Indian Oil, Jakarta-based Medco is also looking for overseas oil and gas assets. The company, which is the largest in Indonesia, has four drilling contracts in the US and one each in Libya, Oman, and Cambodia.

 Yemen is the smallest crude producer on the Arabian Peninsula, pumping 426,000 barrels a day of oil in 2005.

 Meanwhile, ONGC and the Mittal group are in talks with Total of France and Anglo/Dutch firm Shell to farm out a stake to these companies in the two deep-sea blocks in Nigeria which Indian duo were jointly awarded this year.

 The move is being made as Total and Shell have experience in deep-sea exploration in Nigeria. 

 An official said ONGC and Mittal Energy (OMEL) will give Total of France an 18 per cent stake in Block 279 and 26 per cent Block 285 in Nigeria. The Indian companies also want Shell to join as a partner in the block with a 10-15 per cent stake, he said. OMEL had agreed to pay $50 million to the Nigerian government for Block 285 and $65 million for Block 279. Total and Shell will have to pay an amount in proportion to their shareholding.

 According to the deal that is being worked out with Total, OMEL will have the right to take a stake in the French companys Block 215. 

 ONGC chairman and managing director R.S. Sharma confirmed the talks with Total and Shell for the Nigerian blocks but refused to divulge details on the ground that the negotiations were governed by a confidentiality clause.

 The Akpo field, about 200 km off the Nigerian coast, is operated by Total. Block 246 was carved out of the larger block that held the Akpo field. The French company has considerable knowledge on the blocks prospects.

 Lakshmi Mittal will also pay Russias Lukoil $980 million (Rs 4,410 crore) to buy a 50 per cent stake in a Kazakhstan oil firm which he is expected to later transfer to ONGC-Mittal Energy Ltd. 

 Mittal Investment will buy a 50 per cent stake in the Russian companys wholly owned subsidiary in Kazakhstan, Caspian Investments Resources. 

 The deal with Mittal Investments, planned for completion in early 2007, also covers a debt of $160 million held by the venture. Caspian Investments Resources has reserves totalling 270 million barrels of crude.

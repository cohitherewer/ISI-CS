 CHANDRALEKHA TULAL 

 Mumbai, May 16: A bonus wave has hit the bourses ? and Tata Motors is set to be the latest to consider a big reward for its shareholders.

 Market sources said there was a strong buzz of excitement that Tata Motors would declare a bonus on Friday when it is due to announce its annual results for the year ended March 31. A company spokesperson refused to comment on the market speculation.

 The stock has risen sharply in the recent past and touched a 52-week high of Rs 997 on May 9.

 Tata Motors has huge reserves on its balance sheet, which has swelled to Rs 3,749.60 crore for fiscal 2005 from Rs 2,145.25 crore for fiscal 2002.

 The company has made five bonus issues till date with the last one in 1995 in the ratio of 3:5. If it announces a bonus issue this year, it would come after a gap of 10 years. It would also be the first since the company started manufacturing cars seven years back.

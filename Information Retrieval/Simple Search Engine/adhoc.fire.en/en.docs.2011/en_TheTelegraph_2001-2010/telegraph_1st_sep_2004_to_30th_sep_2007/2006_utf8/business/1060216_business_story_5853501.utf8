 Mittal bid pits Nath against EU

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Nath: Going by the book

 New Delhi, Feb. 15: Commerce minister Kamal Nath has flung the WTO rule book at EU trade commissioner Peter Mandelson over the attempts of European governments to block LN Mittal from buying out Luxembourg-based rival Arcelor.

 Nath shot off a letter to Mandelson today saying attempts to thwart Mittals $22.3-billion acquisition bid violated EUs commitment to the WTO accord, which provides for national treatment to cross-border investment.

 Nath has pointed out that Mittals bid was covered under this provision.

 The minister has also written a letter to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, requesting him to take up the issue with French President Jacques Chirac during the latters visit here.

 The governments of France, Luxembourg and Spain have objected to Mittals hostile bid. Labour unions, who are worried about job losses, have also opposed the move.

 Nath said in his letter to Mandelson that the EU had requested India that this sort of national treatment for cross-border investment should be provided on a reciprocal basis.

 This does not seem to be happening in letter and spirit. It impinges upon the ongoing WTO services negotiations. We view it with serious concern, the letter adds. 

 What is happening does not seem to be in consonance with the letter and spirit as India would like to see that national treatment is accorded to all cross-border investments, he said.

 Regarding allegations that racism against Mittal was preventing him from gaining control of Arcelor, Nath said these were issues to be settled by experts in industry and governments cannot get involved in it. But as far as national treatment for cross-border investment was concerned it was not an issue of passport or colour of a person, he added. 

 The Netherlands-based Mittal Steel has made a bid to take over Arcelor, which would create a steel company with an output three times larger than its three nearest rivals combined.

 OneIndia rental cheaper

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, June 13: Bharat Sanchar Nigam today slashed the monthly rental on its OneIndia plan by Rs 74 to Rs 225. The current monthly rental is Rs 299 and the new tariff will come into force from July 1, a senior official said.

 Under the plan, the state-run telecom firm will also offer users 25 free calls a month. Earlier there were no free calls. 

 According to March figures, the OneIndia Plan has close to 3.4 lakh subscribers, senior officials said.

 BSNL had launched the OneIndia Plan last year, paving the way for uniform local and STD call rates. It means calls made to any destination within the country will be treated as calls made within a state. Recently, the company slashed call rates to other fixed-line networks like Reliance and Bharti by 75 per cent to Rs 1.20 per 3 minutes.

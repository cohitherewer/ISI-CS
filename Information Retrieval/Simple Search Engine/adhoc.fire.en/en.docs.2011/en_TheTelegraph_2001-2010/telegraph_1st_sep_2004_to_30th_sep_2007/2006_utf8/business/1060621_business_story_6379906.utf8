 Calcutta, June 20: Calcutta, the oldest surviving tea auction centre in the world after London closed down in 1998, is all set to join the e-auction club. It will be ready to use the test software version by March 2007. The ultimate aim is to integrate the eight auction centres in the country through the e-auction platform.

 The Calcutta centre, which conducted the first tea auction in India way back in 1861, was the only location excluded from the e-auction loop, which included Kochi, Conoor, Coimbatore. Guwahati and Siliguri were included in the loop, only to be discontinued later. Jorhat and Dibrugarh tea auction centres would also be on e-auction shortly.

 Around 200 laptops worth Rs 2 crore were lying unpacked for the last one year with the centre. About 45 have been set up so far.

 ?Just as in gems and jewellery, we have set a target for Mumbai to become the next Antwerp in the next five years, Calcutta could take up the mantle of Mombasa and become a world centre for tea auctions,? said Jairam Ramesh, minister of state for commerce and industry.

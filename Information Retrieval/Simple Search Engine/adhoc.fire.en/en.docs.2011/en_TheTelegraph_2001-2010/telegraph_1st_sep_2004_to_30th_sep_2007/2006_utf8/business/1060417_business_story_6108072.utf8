 Diamonds add sparkle 

to Indian export show

 Boom time

 New Delhi, April 16: Indian gems and jewellery exports grew by 10.31 per cent during April-December 2005, reaching the $12.08-billion mark, over the corresponding period in 2004. 

 The growth has primarily been driven by the cut and polished diamond (CPD) segment, an ICRA study said. 

 While gold exports declined by 3.2 per cent year-on-year during the first nine months of fiscal 2006 to Rs 11,592 crore, CPD exports increased by 11.2 per cent year-on-year during the same period to Rs 38,272 crore. 

 The gems and jewellery sector is expected to further record a good performance due to the growth in the US and Japanese economies, coupled with an upbeat domestic economic environment, according to the study. The Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion Council has set a target of reaching $20 billion in exports in 2006-2007 on the basis of the positive growth in the sector. 

 According to the study, bank credit to the sector increased by 25 per cent year-on-year at the end of October 2005 because of increased exports.

 The study, however, points out that despite the healthy growth in exports, the operating margin of the gems and jewellery industry has been declining because of increased costs on employee and raw materials as well as pricing pressures. 

 The industry had for the last few years grown consistently at 15-20 per cent. However, the last two quarters of fiscal 2005-06 witnessed diminishing exports, primarily because of a slowdown in the US, the largest market for the Indian gems and jewellery sector. 

 According to export figures available for 2004-05, US, Hong Kong and UAE were the top export markets for the Indian gems and jewellery products followed by Singapore and Belgium, accounting for nearly 80 per cent of total exports.

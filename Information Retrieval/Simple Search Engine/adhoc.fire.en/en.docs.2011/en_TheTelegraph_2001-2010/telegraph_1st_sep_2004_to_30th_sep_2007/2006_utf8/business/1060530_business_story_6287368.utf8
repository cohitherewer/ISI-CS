 Videocon tunes in to fast-track funds

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, May 29: Exactly three weeks after the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) allowed corporate India to raise funds through a new capital raising method ? the qualified institutional placement (QIP) ? consumer electronics maker Videocon Industries Ltd was the first off the block to announce that it would seek shareholders approval next month to raise money through this method.

 The QIP is a process through which corporate houses can place securities with institutions. These securities can be later converted into shares.

 Under the Sebi guidelines, the specified securities issued through QIPs should be on a private placement basis. The market regulator has stipulated that a minimum of 10 per cent of the securities in each placement should be allotted to mutual funds.

 Videocon Industries today informed stock exchanges that an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) of its shareholders will be held on June 26 to seek approval for placement of equity shares or securities other than warrants which are convertible into or exchangeable with equity shares under the recent guidelines issued by Sebi, dated May 8, 2006 for qualified institutional placement.

 Although the company did not disclose the sum that it would raise through this process, merchant bankers expect many other corporate houses to join the bandwagon in the days to come. 

 There are several reasons for the emergence of this new bandwagon. At a time when the economy is growing at over 8 per cent and many companies need funds to expand operations and set up new projects, QIPs will provide them the much required resources in a short span of time. It also does not make them subject to limits that are seen in the case of alternative instruments like external commercial borrowings (ECBs).

 A major positive that goes in favour of the QIP is that corporate houses can avoid coming out with a time consuming IPO wherein they have to comply with various regulatory and disclosure requirements. Since the time when a particular company announces a public issue and the offering actually kicks off, a lot of things can happen. The QIP mitigates such market risks, says a merchant banker who did not wish to be identified.

 Recalling the positive feedback that the regulator had received when it had invited suggestions from the market community, the merchant banker said the only factor going against QIP is that it does not involve the retail investor.

 Arcelor sticks to buyback plan

 Guy Dolle: Hitting back

 Brussels, May 13 (Reuters): Arcelor, the worlds second-biggest steel maker, would proceed with a 5-billion-euro (?3.4-billion) share buyback, its latest weapon to fend off a takeover by larger rival Mittal Steel. 

 It also reported first-quarter core profit that beat analysts estimates and constituted the Luxembourg-based groups best defence against its unwanted suitor, chief executive Guy Dolle said in a conference call after the announcement.

 Arcelor deputy CEO Michel Wurth said in an interview on Luxembourg radio that the buyback was an answer to the Mittal offer, because it allows the board to establish the value of our shares and offer shareholders that price.

 Dolle, who had previously valued Arcelor at between 33.7 billion and 40.7 billion euros, said the shares would be bought back above the market price. 

 Mittal also reported lower first-quarter profit on Friday, along with US justice departments clearance for its bid. Chief executive and founder Lakshmi Mittal said he hoped his offer would be cleared by bourse regulators next week and swiftly put to shareholders. 

 The 5-billion-euro buyback of up to 150 million shares is another defensive gambit in a battle that turned nastier on Thursday when Arcelor said it had filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the US against its unwanted suitor. 

 Arcelor said its earnings before interest, tax, debt and amortisation (EBITDA) fell to 1.427 billion euros in the first three months of the year from 1.697 billion in the same period last year. The result was above the average forecast of 1.33 billion euros in a Reuters poll of analysts. 

 Sales in the quarter rose 17.3 per cent to 9.565 billion euros from 8.157 billion a year earlier. 

 Dolle said in a statement that core profit had fallen because market conditions had changed completely, with massive materials cost increases and lower spot prices. 

 But he told Reuters after the results that he felt comfortable his company would hit its target of 7 billion euros in annual core profit by 2008. 

 He also said Arcelor would continue to look for partnerships or tie-ups, despite being under attack by its rival. 

 Fortunately, industry life goes on, he said, announcing that he hoped to finalise the acquisition of a 50 per cent stake in Moroccan steel group Sonasid by the end of May. 

 We are ready to sign at the end of the month, he said. 

 Dolle said he had yet to meet Romain Zaleski, who became indirectly the second-biggest shareholder in Arcelor after the Luxembourg state through his holding firm Carlo Tassara International, which recently acquired over 5 per cent of the steel firm. 

 Other members of Arcelors management had held talks with Zaleski, Dolle said. 

 I hope to meet him in the coming weeks, Dolle said. 

 Arcelor shareholders will vote on the buyback on May 19.

 But Dolle said he expected the shareholders would hold a second meeting at the end of June because it was unlikely that 50 per cent would be represented at the first.

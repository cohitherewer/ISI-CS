 India, Germany in alternative fuel pact 

 New Delhi, Sept. 9 (PTI): India and Germany today agreed to join hands to meet the auto-energy challenge through co-operation in developing alternative fuel strategies. 

 Indo-German bilateral trade has been growing and the two countries are already working together in three other areas. We are adding a fourth joint working group in the auto sector, which will look into future alternative fuel strategies, Union heavy industries minister Santosh Mohan Dev said while inaugurating a symposium. 

 A memorandum of understanding (MoU) was signed today between the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam) and its German counterpart Verband Der Automobileindustrie (VDA). According to the MoU, Siam and VDA will co-operate in areas such as diesel engine, alternative drives and fuels and will work towards fuel-efficient engines.

 Stressing the need for the two countries to co-operate in the development of alternative fuel technologies, Ulrich Kasparick, German parliamentary secretary, federal ministry of transport, said co-operation should start right from the research and development at the university level. 

 If the automobile sectors of both the countries are able to take a leading position in the global stage on the bio-fuel and alternative fuel technologies, it would be good for both the economies, Kasparick added. Siam and VDA will assist each other in the development of fuel-efficient innovative drive systems, including clean diesel technology under the MoU. 

 Highlighting the importance of the co-operation between the industry bodies of the two countries, Siam vice-president Ravi Kant said the initiative will be mutually beneficial to both the countries and we would gain from each others experience and expertise.

 He said the agreement would seek future co-operation especially in the areas of diesel engines, alternative drives and fuels and for working towards fuel-efficient engines. VDA president Bernd Gottschalk said the German automotive industry was looking to offer its technological competence to its Indian counterpart.

 It is a perfect start for intensifying our exchange of ideas and knowledge. Protecting the climate and environment and providing sustainable, clean and efficient mobility for future generations is a challenge for both Germany and India, Gottschalk said.

 The heavy industry ministry, which is taking the initiative for Indo-German co-operation in alternate drives and fuels, is looking at the co-operation between the two industry bodies to provide inputs to policy making in India.

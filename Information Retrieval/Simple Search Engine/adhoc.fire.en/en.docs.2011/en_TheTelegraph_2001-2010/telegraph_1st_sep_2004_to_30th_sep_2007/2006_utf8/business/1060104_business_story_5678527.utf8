 Ears cocked for Motorola gizmos

 BORDERS BLUR

 New York, Jan. 3 (Reuters): Motorola, the worlds No. 2 cell-phone maker, on Tuesday revealed details of its plans for iRadio, a subscription music service that will go on sale this year. It also unveiled a new home-phone that consumers could link with cell-phone and Web phone services.

 The new offers come as mobile network operators are developing services such as mobile music downloads and seeking to improve wireless coverage at home by adding short-range home network links to cellular phones.

 The iRadio service, in some respects, puts Motorola in competition with XM Satellite Radio Holdings and Sirius Satellite Radio, which sell radio subscriptions for car and home radios. Sirius also sends music to Sprint Nextel phones.

 Motorolas iRadio service will first run on the Rokr E2 cell phone, which, unlike the first Rokr phone, will not include Apple Computers popular iTunes music software. Motorola aims to sell the service and phone via mobile operators. Motorola said in October its first cell phone for iRadio would be able to hold about 70 hours of music.

 The iRadio service will include 435 commercial-free radio channels, including genres such as Heavy Metal, Rockin Cowboys and Angry Women. Its satellite rivals also provide specialised music channels, often without ads.

 iRadio will let users download channels on the computer and transfer them to play on their phones or on car or home stereos, like satellite radio.

 The iRadio service will cost about $7 (?4) a month but it may vary depending on which wireless phone service the subscriber uses.

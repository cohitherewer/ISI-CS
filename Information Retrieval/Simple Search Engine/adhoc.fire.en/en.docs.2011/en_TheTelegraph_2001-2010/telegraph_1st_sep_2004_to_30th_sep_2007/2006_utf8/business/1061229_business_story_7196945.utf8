 Cabinet nod for special tea fund

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi, Dec. 28: The cabinet committee on economic affairs (CCEA) today gave its approval for setting up a special purpose tea fund (SPTF) under the Tea Board to fund replantation and rejuvenation activities.

 This is expected to help more than 340 tea companies, which are facing problems of low productivity and old plantations. 

 The scheme is expected to increase yield, lower the cost of production and improve quality, which will lead to a higher price realisation, a government release said.

 The estimated outlay of Rs 567.10 crore for the SPTF will be applicable till the end of the Tenth Plan (remaining part of 2006-07) and in the Eleventh Five-Year Plan.

 The government feels the SPTF will not only boost global competitivness of tea, but will also result in higher collection of cess, sales tax/VAT and income tax.

 The SPTF is expected to generate employment at the rate of 22 million person days per year. The disbursement of the fund was supposed to start by November 1, 2006.

 Move on wage dues

 The CCEA has also approved a budgetary support to meet outstanding statutory dues, salary and wages of defaulting central public sector enterprises (CPSEs) under the department of heavy industries. 

 It would mitigate the hardships of employees, thereby motivating them for better output, and preparing them to achieve the goal of reviving the company, said an official release. 

 The Board of Reconstruction of Public Sector Enterprises gave its recommendations on the revival of 34 CPSEs, of which 20 have been approved by the government. These include Heavy Engineering Corporation, Hindustan Antibiotics and NTC.

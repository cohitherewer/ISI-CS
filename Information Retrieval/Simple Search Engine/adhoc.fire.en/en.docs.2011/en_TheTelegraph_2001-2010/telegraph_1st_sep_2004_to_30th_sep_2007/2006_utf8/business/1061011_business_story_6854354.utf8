 Key Mumbai role in Amgen research 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Oct. 10: Amgen, the worlds largest biotech company, is coming to India. 

 The $15-billion firm may soon set up a research centre in Mumbai as part of its plan to make the country a key part of its research setup. 

 Amgen, a human therapeutics company, pioneered the development of novel products based on recombinant DNA technology and molecular biology and launched the biotech industrys first blockbuster medicines. 

 Amgen is now a Fortune 500 company, having units in more than 30 locations outside the US. 

 The company has a research facility in Germany. 

 It appears that attracted by the potential of India as a major research amp; development base, Amgen may soon put up a research centre in the countrys commercial capital through a wholly owned subsidiary. 

 The Thousand Oaks, California-based company has apparently been allured by available qualified personnel. 

 Unconfirmed reports also said that the forthcoming centre in Mumbai would be much larger than the one in Germany. 

 Indias strength on the research front can be gauged from the fact that even as many leading companies are interested in setting up operations here or conducting clinical trials, a strong number of those conducting research are also Indians.

 According to estimates, close to 30 per cent of research around the globe is done by Indians. 

 On the other hand, attracted by a multi-racial population, a vast pool of qualified professionals and equally reputed institutions, India has seen many multinational pharmaceutical companies conducting clinical trials on their investigational drugs. 

 While GlaxoSmithkline, Pfizer, Novartis, and AstraZeneca are already in the midst of undertaking clinical research in the country, the US-based Merck amp; Co, operating here as MSD India, recently identified India to conduct clinical trials on its investigational cervical cancer vaccine, Gardasil, for which it joined hands with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). 

 Amgen, which spends over $5 billion on research, has more than 40 molecules in its pipeline in various stages of development.

 Some of its key products include Epogen, which is used to bring immediate improvements in end-stage renal disease patients, and Aranesp.

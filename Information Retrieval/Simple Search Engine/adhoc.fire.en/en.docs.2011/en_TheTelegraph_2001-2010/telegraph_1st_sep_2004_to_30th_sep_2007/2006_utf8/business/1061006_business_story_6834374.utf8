 Lifeline for ailing ECL

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Oct. 5: The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs today approved a financial package that would see the infusion of Rs 2,956.83 crore into the ailing Eastern Coalfields Ltd (ECL) and waive debt burden to the tune of Rs 721.38 crore.

 Finance minister P. Chidambaram told reporters after the meeting that the infusion of funds would come from internal accruals of the company over the next six years and would be used to increase coal output. Coal India will waive an unsecured loan of Rs 519 crore extended to ECL. In addition, interest to the tune of Rs 202.38 crore on this loan will be waived. ECL has also been exempted from paying electricity duty at the rate of Rs 18 crore every year for five years. 

 As part of the restructuring package, Coal India will convert Rs 1,532 crore that ECL has in its current account into equity share capital as a result of which the negative net worth of ECL would be reduced in the same proportion. The finance minister said the arrears of the national coal wage agreement would be disbursed in three instalments by March 2007. 

 Road revamp

 The CCEA today approved the six-laning of national highways comprising 5,700 km of the Delhi-Calcutta-Chennai-Mumbai-Delhi golden quadrilateral and 800 km of other sections at a cost of Rs 41,210 crore. Chidambaram said Rs 35,692 crore of this investment is expected to come from the private sector on a build operate and transfer (BOT) basis. The balance Rs 5,518 crore will be met by the government as viability gap, cost of land acquisition, utility shifting and consultancy.

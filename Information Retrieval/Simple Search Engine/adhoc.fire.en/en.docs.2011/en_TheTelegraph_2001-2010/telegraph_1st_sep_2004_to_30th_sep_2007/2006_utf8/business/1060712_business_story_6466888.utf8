 Calcutta, July 11: Confusion over plot allocation is adding to the woes of the state information technology department, which is plagued by high real estate prices and land scarcity.

 The stalled IT park project of Ascendas India is a case in point. The company was in talks with the state IT department for land, which was to be procured by the Housing Infrastructure Development Corporation (Hidco).

 ?We were negotiating with the Bengal government for the allocation of land to develop an IT park in Rajarhat. A key requirement for the project is a plot of at least 25 acres or 10 hectares to comply with the new special economic zone (SEZ) act for IT projects. While we had all the support from the chief minister?s office, we have not yet been allocated the requisite land and hence could not begin work,? an Ascendas India official said. The company had applied for 20 acres for its SEZ before the new act came into force.

 Hidco managing director R.K. Tripathi said in a city chamber of commerce meeting today that Ascendas had been allocated 20 acres but was yet to take possession because of price issues.

 State housing department sources said the company had been allocated the land but refused to pay Rs 2.16 crore per acre and take possession of the plot. ?In keeping with its SEZ plans, Ascendas India has now asked for a 25-acre plot and is yet to be allocated the same,? said state IT secretary Siddharth.

 Land prices in Rajarhat have become one of the greatest stumbling blocks for IT companies with Hidco refusing to lower the existing rate of Rs 2.16 crore per acre.

 Hidco was supposed to give 200 acres to the state IT department in December 2003 but ended up giving only 30 acres.

 The confusion seems to be rooted in the changed land requirement in the new SEZ act.

 Wipro, which has been allocated 40 acres, is yet to buy the plot and start work because of high prices.

 IT department sources said Tata Consultancy Services had asked for 50 acres and Satyam for 25 acres 9-10 months ago. But discussions had not progressed and the projects were shelved or transferred to other cities.

 Even Infosys, which has asked for 100 acres, could not be accommodated at Rajarhat. The company was shown land owned by West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation (WBIDC) further away.

 Of the 48 IT SMEs, which have been allotted a total of 21 acres, Hidco has cancelled the allocation for 11 such firms due to non-payment.

 ?At Rs 87 lakh per acre, the land price in Calcutta is becoming prohibitively high compared with other cities like Chandigarh, Pune and Hyderabad,? said C.P. Gurnani, president of Tech Mahindra Limited ? a company that has set up a 12-acre campus away from Rajarhat at the Bantala SEZ.

 The IT department needs 600 acres by December 2006. However, it is yet to come close to the figure as 200 acres in Jagdishpur will be available around 2007-08 and in Dankuni earliest by 2010.

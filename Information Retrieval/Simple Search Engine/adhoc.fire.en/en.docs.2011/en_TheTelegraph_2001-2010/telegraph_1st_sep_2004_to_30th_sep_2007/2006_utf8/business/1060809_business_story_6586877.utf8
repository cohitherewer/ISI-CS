 Rising freight rates buoy GE Ship 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Aug. 8: Great Eastern Shipping Company Ltd (GE Shipping), the Rs 2,282-crore shipping and offshore services company, is getting just the sort of ballast it needs to buoy its business: a rise in world freight rates.

 Shipping freight rates, which till recently had softened, have started firming up ahead of the winter season in the US and Europe.

 Shipping industry experts say freight rates both on the dry bulk and tanker segments are now heading north. Rates have firmed up between 70 per cent and 76 per cent for Suezmax and very large crude carriers (VLCC) and 53 per cent for the Aframax segment.

 For GE Shipping, rising freight rates should come as a relief since a likely demerger of its offshore division would have taken away a profitable centre of operations. The offshore sector has been on a roll in recent times with charter rates booming on account of increased exploration activities.

 During the first quarter of this fiscal, the company witnessed average earnings from crude earnings falling to $26,582 per day compared with $26,922 in the corresponding period last year while dry bulk rates fell sharply by around 30 per cent.

 The equity market is agog with speculation that GE Shipping now wants to revive the demerger plan as freight rates have begun to show an improvement. 

 GE Shipping has informed stock exchanges that the board will meet tomorrow to discuss the situation arising out of the non-completion of the demerger scheme. The board is likely to consider various restructuring options available, including seeking fresh approval from the high court to complete the demerger arrangement.

 Last week, GE Shipping announced that it was not proceeding with the scheme of demerger of the offshore services business as all the conditions have not been fulfilled within the stipulated time.

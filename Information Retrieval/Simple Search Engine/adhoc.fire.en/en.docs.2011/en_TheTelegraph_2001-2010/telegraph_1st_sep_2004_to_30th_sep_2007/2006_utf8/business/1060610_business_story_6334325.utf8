 Borrowing becomes costlier

ICICI takes lead in lending rate hike

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, June 9: Just a day after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) tweaked its key interest rates, the reverse repo and the repo rate, ICICI Bank announced a steep half a percentage point hike on all retail and corporate loans.

 Housing loans of the bank will now be dearer by 50 basis points across the board. While the interest rates on floating home loans have been raised to 9.5 per cent, it now stands at 10.75 per cent for fixed home loans.

 Even as many banks are now assessing the impact of the surprise announcement made yesterday by the RBI, it seems that a few private banks will follow ICICI Banks lead in raising rates. Sources said HDFC Bank and IndusInd Bank could take a decision soon.

 It is learnt that an asset liability committee meeting at IDBI Bank is slated for tomorrow and that the bank may take a decision in a weeks time. 

 However, customers of public sector banks can breathe easy ? at least for the next few days. 

 Most of the nationalised banks are not inclined to raise interest rates for now. Sources added that the Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC), another key player in the housing finance market, is also unlikely to tinker with its current rate structure.

 On Thursday, the RBI had raised the reverse repo, the rate at which it buys funds from banks, and repo (the rate at which it lends to banks) by 25 basis points each in an effort to rein in inflation after the recent increase in fuel prices.

 Chanda Kochhar, deputy managing director of ICICI Bank, told The Telegraph that the decision on the rate hike was taken after assessing the prevailing market conditions. 

 She said normally market-based interest rates soften after the January-March period. But this didnt happen this year and the bank was forced to revise its lending rates.

 The bank had raised interest rates in May. Kochhar said at that time, the bank had not fully passed on the increase in costs to the consumer as it had expected interest rates to soften. The present hike will now pass the rest of the cost burden to the customers.

 Kochhar, however, does not expect offtake to suffer with the rise in interest rates. 

 I dont believe so. Though rates have gone up over the past one year, they are competitively placed. More importantly, the customers affordability has gone up, she added. 

 The ICICI Bank deputy managing director felt that interest rates were unlikely to come down in a hurry.

 ICICI Bank is the leading player in retail credit business. For the fiscal ended March 31, 2006, its housing loan portfolio stood at Rs 25,740 crore, giving the bank a 31 per cent market share. Similarly in auto, its loan portfolio stood at Rs 17,325 crore.

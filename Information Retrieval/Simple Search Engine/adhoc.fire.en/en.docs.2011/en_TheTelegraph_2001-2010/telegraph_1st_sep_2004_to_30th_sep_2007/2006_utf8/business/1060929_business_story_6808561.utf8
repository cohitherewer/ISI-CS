 Early takeoff hint for foreign flight right

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Patel: Flying high

 New Delhi, Sept. 28: The government may relax the criterion that an airline needs to operate at least five years before getting the right to fly to foreign countries. The move will allow new carriers to fly to the Asean countries. 

 The civil aviation ministry today said it would also direct state-run oil companies to reduce jet fuel prices to help the struggling airline industry.

 The ministry, however, will not bar new players entry restrictions will only help existing operators to consolidate their operations but will tighten scrutiny of new applications to keep out non-serious players. 

 I will be taking up the issue of high jet fuel prices with oil companies as well as with the petroleum minister, civil aviation minister Praful Patel said here today. The minister wants the oil companies to pass on the fall in the price of crude to the airlines by reducing fuel costs. He said he would also take up with the state governments the high taxes on the fuel. Patel today held a powwow with airline chiefs on the shortcomings of the industry and ways of redressal.

 Though the minister refused to commit himself on allowing the newer airlines to fly to the Asean countries, he, however, said policies keep evolving ... we will see what is needed. 

Senior officials said the government may change the 

criterion at least for the Asean region, with which India has signed a treaty 

to open up its four big cities Chennai, Delhi, Calcutta and Mumbai to almost 

daily flights by any Asean carrier. Airlines expect a decision in December, allowing 

them to prepare their schedules for the next summer.

 Diktat on IPO loans to crimp super rich

 VIVEK NAIR

 Tough act

 Mumbai, Nov. 19: Big-ticket initial public offerings (IPOs) may have some reason to worry after the Reserve Bank (RBI) tightened banks exposure to the capital market.

 The RBIs recommendation that individuals cannot raise more than Rs 10 lakh from all banks to invest in new offerings could hurt subscription from the high net worth individual (HNI) category. 

 At present, 50 per cent in an IPO is earmarked for qualified institutional investors (QIBs) and 35 per cent for retail investors while 15 per cent is reserved for HNIs. 

 Investors in the HNI category are the ones who heavily rely on bank funds to subscribe to IPOs. Capital market circles say though retail investors also resort to bank funding, the scale is limited. Most of the leveraging is done by investors who fall in the 15 per cent category. Therefore, the impact of the RBI draft norms may be felt only in that category. Overall, they will not hurt new issues, says Prithvi Haldea of Prime Database. 

 Market circles add that some investors within the HNI category make multiple applications to obtain allotment. They are also the ones looking at short-term listing gains. 

 These are investors who go for large amount of bank finance during an IPO. They usually sell these shares after they are listed on the bourses, says a broker. He says such a practice is usually observed in offerings from large firms or the much-awaited ones. 

 Although companies fall under the HNI category, they do not resort to bank funding. The people who normally go for bank financing could be executives, traders, doctors, lawyers or even brokers, an analyst said. He added such IPO finance is usually available at an interest rate of 15 per cent. Haldea says such investors account for 5 to 6 per cent within the HNI section. 

 Recalling the more recent instance of the Parsvnath IPO, which was available at a price band of Rs 250-300 per share, sources said the acquisition cost for investors who went in for bank finance was Rs 160 per share. If they have to make a profit, the Parsvnath share should list at a minimum price of Rs 460 per share. It is perhaps because of this trend that the RBI has come out with the tough norms, sources added. 

 The apex bank has also tightened norms for bank lending to investors who play the markets. However, brokers do not expect it to affect the equity markets when it reopens on Monday. It will not have any impact on the secondary market on Monday. If the markets fall, it will be due to other reasons, said V. K. Sharma, head of research at Anagram Stock Broking. 

 Others who agree with Sharma said the RBI figures state that banks lending to capital market during 2005-06 was Rs 22,077 crore against Rs 15,860 crore in the previous fiscal. This is only a fraction of the market capitalisation of over Rs 8 lakh crore of the sensex (on a free-float basis).

 Strict vigil on rising inflation

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 30: Higher prices of pulses, fruits, vegetables and some fuels have driven up inflation to 5.44 per cent for the week ended June 17 from 5.24 per cent in the previous week. 

 The inflation had crossed the 5-per-cent mark during the week ended June 10, for the first time this year. 

 The weekly data on wholesale prices-based inflation captured the cascading effect of the price hike in petrol and diesel but did not reflect anti-inflationary measures taken by the government on June 22.

 ?It?s worrying ... the inflation rate is going up fast. We know that another 20-30 days will see food prices coming down but petrol is something we can?t control,? said senior North Block officials. 

 A senior economic analyst working for HSBC Treasury said he expected inflation, calculated on a yearly basis, to stay at over 6 per cent ?even though we may actually see a small fall in weekly numbers over the next few weeks because of a statistical base effect (higher base reflects lower growth)?.

 The level of price rise could be gauged from the fact that the inflation was way down at 4.10 per cent during the corresponding week of the previous year.

 Action replay

 The government today said rising prices are certainly a cause for concern and it will take further action to contain them. 

 ?The situation is being monitored at every level. We are addressing it (rising inflation). We are trying to address it with a slew of measures which we hope will be effective. We will take further action if the need arises,? a key finance ministry official said.

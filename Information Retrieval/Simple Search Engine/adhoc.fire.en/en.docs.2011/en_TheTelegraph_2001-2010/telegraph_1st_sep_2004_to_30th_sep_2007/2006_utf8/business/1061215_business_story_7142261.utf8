The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Ruias set to roll out open offer for Dunlop

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Ruia: Going by the rules

 Calcutta, Dec. 14: The 

 Ruia group will make open offers for tyre makers Dunlop 

 and Falcon to abide by the directive of the Securities and 

 Exchange Board of India (Sebi).

 The market regulator had asked Wealth Sea Pte, the Singapore-based Ruia group company, to start work on the offers by December 15.

 In a letter to Sebi today, Wealth Sea said it would make the offers, but sought time till the end of January to start the process.

 We may even come out with an announcement before January-end, Pawan K. Ruia, chairman of the group, told The Telegraph, while confirming the development.

 Wealth Sea said it needed more time because it was not possible to complete the formalities now in Singapore where most of the offices will be closed for Christmas and New Year.

 The offer price for Falcon will be Rs 148 a share, which is the closing price on November 28, 2005 when the Ruia group took over the company.

 For Dunlop, the price is Rs 10 a share since trading was suspended in the scrip.

 The Falcon stock today hit a years high of Rs 141 on a bouyant Bombay Stock Exchange, a gain of Rs 10.75 or 7.76 per cent. Trading today was also higher than the daily average volume of the past two weeks.

 In the last seven days, the stock gained Rs 18.85 or 15.43 per cent.

 The delay in the open offers may not affect shareholders who will get an interest of 10 per cent on the offer prices from June 2, 2006, the deemed date of closure fixed by Sebi for the offers.

 A back-of-the-envelope calculation shows that Ruia will have to shell out close to Rs 26 crore for the offers, besides the interest payments.

 The Ruia group had earlier argued against making the mandatory open offers for 20 per cent additional shares since it did not acquire the shares of Dunlop and Falcon directly and the deal was done overseas.

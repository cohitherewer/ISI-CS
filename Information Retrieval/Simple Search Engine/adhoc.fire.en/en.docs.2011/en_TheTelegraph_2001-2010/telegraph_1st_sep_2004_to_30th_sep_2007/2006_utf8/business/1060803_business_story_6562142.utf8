 Tea output beats forecast

 SOHINI MOOKHERJEA

 Calcutta, Aug. 2: Tea production in the first half of the year has increased around 11 per cent over the last-year period, beating industry forecast, according to Indian Tea Association figures. 

 Production in Kenya has declined by 19 per cent to 134 million kg from 166 million kg in the corresponding period last year due to the prevailing drought-like conditions. Kenya is also expected to lose another 7 to 8 million kg in the next three months.

 While the exact figures are being consolidated at the Tea Board, sources said the overall production for the first-half seems to have made up for earlier losses.

 This is contrary to industry experts predictions of a 20-million-kg decline in the first-half production. The all-India tea production figures compiled by the Tea Board from January to June 2005 was 312 million kg.

 Till May 2006, production was down by 15.4 million kg to 223.9 million kg from 239.3 million kg last year.

 Exports till May 2006 were down to 59.4 million kg from 68.5 million kg in the year-ago period. Till May 2006, Indian exports fetched a unit price of $1.81 per kg against $1.98 per kg in the same period last year.

 Kenyan tea fetched an average unit price of $2.06 per kg for the half-year period compared with $1.59 in the same period last year. 

 Globally, tea prices are on the rise but oversupply at times forces down prices, Tea Board chairman Basudeb Banerjee said.

 The International Tea Committee said there has been a supply growth of 25 per cent over the last 10 years, while India and China together produced 53 per cent of the total crop and also consumed 40 per cent of the global supply. Prices had been at an average of $1.5 per kg till tighter supply, higher prices and weaker currencies of producing countries kicked off the upward price trend from the beginning of this year, Banerjee said.

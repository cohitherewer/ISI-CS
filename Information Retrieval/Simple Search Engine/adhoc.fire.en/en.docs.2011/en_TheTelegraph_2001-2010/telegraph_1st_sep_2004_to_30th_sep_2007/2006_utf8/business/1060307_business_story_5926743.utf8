 Shift in production strategy to help CLW

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Chittaranjan, March 6: In a much-needed relief to Chittaranjan Locomotive Works (CLW), the Railway Board has cleared a three-year production target for the locomotive manufacturer.

 Since the inception of CLW, the Railway Board had been approving annual production target for the company. But it had been found that procurement of raw materials takes up a lot of time thereby upsetting the production schedule and leading to a huge cost overrun. 

 Considering the techno-economic need of the present time, the Railway Board has realised that it is imperative for CLW to bring down cost of production.

 CLW, which has been suffering from a severe order crunch for more than a decade, will produce nearly 200 locomotives from the next fiscal.

 CLW general manager Sukhbir Singh said, procurement of materials before commencing a fresh production series consumes almost eight months every fiscal. This had been injuring our exchequer. So we had planned for a strategic change and sought for a three-year production target.

 Singh said, We wanted immediate infrastructure revamp at CLW and, according to our projected target, we will be able to bring down the price of locomotives to less than Rs 10 crore from the 2006-07 fiscal. 

 At present, each CLW loco cost Rs 12 crore. 

 According to Singh, the board has approved Rs 40 crore for immediate purchase of machinery and plant equipment.

 For the first time, we are also allowed to procure necessary gadgets on our own, bypassing the Central Organisation For Modernisation of Workshops, an agency regulating the logistics, he added.

 CLW will be producing a minimum of 550 locomotives by 2008-09, out of which 140 will be three-phase high-tech locomotives especially designed for the Indian Railway with a maximum 200 kmph.The company has produced 101 locomotives till January in the current fiscal. 

 Recently the company has developed Dr Silver, a three-phase freight electric locomotive, in association with the Indian Space Research Organisation with a remote diagnostic capability. Dr Silver will be flagged off shortly by railway minister Lalu Prasad. 

 To augment its production capacity, CLW plans to increase the number of its technical hands. Singh said, We expect to absorb 179 trade apprentices by the next fiscal.

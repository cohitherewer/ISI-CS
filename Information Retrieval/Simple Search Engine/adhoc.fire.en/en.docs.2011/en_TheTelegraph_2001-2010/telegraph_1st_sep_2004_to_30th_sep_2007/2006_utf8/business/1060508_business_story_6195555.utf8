The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Sharp keen to regain cutting edge in India

 Calcutta, May 7: Sharp India Ltd is set to be back in the black after incurring losses for consecutive quarters.

 We will post a net profit for the fourth quarter ended March 2006, said Prasun Banerjee, sales and marketing vice-president of Sharp India Ltd. 

 According to Banerjee, Sharp India has been able to bring down its quarterly losses to Rs 1.03 crore in the third quarter from Rs 4.10 crore in April-June period last year by embarking on an aggressive business expansion drive.

 We are targeting a turnover of Rs 500 crore by 2008 against Rs 125 crore last fiscal, Banerjee said. For the current fiscal, the company has set a target of 60 per cent growth at Rs 200 crore, he added.

 After buying out joint venture partner Kalyani group in Sharp India, Sharp Corporation of Japan now holds an 80 per cent stake in the Indian subsidiary. 

 While Korean conglomerates such as LG and Samsung had tapped opportunities in the Indian mass market segment early and cornered the largest market share, the Japanese giants had hitherto been sitting idle catering only to the premium segment. But the Goldman Sachs report (2003) on BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India and China) economies gave them a knee-jerk and the Japanese firms have started to look at the Indian market afresh. 

 This is evident from the fact that Sony has drastically brought down the prices of its products to a level which is competitive with those of the Koreans, and Sharp Corporation has increased its stake to 80 per cent in Sharp India reflecting a greater commitment to Indian market, said Banerjee.

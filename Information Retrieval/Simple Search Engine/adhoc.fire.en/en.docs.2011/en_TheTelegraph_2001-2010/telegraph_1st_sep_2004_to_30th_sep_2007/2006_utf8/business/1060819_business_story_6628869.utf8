 Dell fares well in Asian market

Tokyo, Aug. 18 (Reuters): Dell Inc, the worlds 

largest personal computer maker, posted revenue growth in Japan, China and India 

in the April-June quarter, its Asia-Pacific regional head said on Friday.

 The companys revenue grew only 2 per cent in Japan, but jumped 31 per cent in China and 63 per cent in India, even as Dell said in the US on Thursday that its group quarterly profit dropped 51 per cent on slower revenue growth as it cut prices to gain market share.

 I think we (Dell as a whole) got a little too aggressive in pricing strategy. But in Asia we did see good elasticity, Dells regional head Steve Felice told reporters in a conference call. In Asia, we saw very solid profitability.

 Asia, which accounts for 14 per cent of Dells revenue, has been a bright spot for the company, which is under pressure from an informal audit by the US Securities and Exchange Commission and the recall of 4.1 million batteries made by Sony Corp.

 We will continue to provide competitive pricing, Felice said when asked if Dell would lower prices in Asia still further for market share. We will continue to stress not just prices but that customers will get the best product for the best value.

 Felice said the companys plan to launch Dimension consumer desktop PCs with microprocessors of Advanced Micro Devices could have a profound impact on its growth in China.

 Customers asked us to expand the product line to include AMD, and the Dimension line has a lot of appeal in China. Weve had good growth in China so far and this will help us accelerate that, he said.

 In Japan, Dell sold 14.5 per cent more PCs in the April-June quarter than a year earlier on aggressive pricing, nudging out Fujitsu to become the second-largest PC supplier in Japan after NEC Corp. in the quarter, according to research firm IDC.

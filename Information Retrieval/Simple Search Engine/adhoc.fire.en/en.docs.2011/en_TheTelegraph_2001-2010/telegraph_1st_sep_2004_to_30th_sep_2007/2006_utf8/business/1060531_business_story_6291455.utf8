 New Delhi, May 30: The State Bank of India will complete the acquisition of Kenyas Giro Commercial Bank and PT Bank Indo Monex of Indonesia in the next two months.

 We will acquire these two bank within two months, SBI chairman A.K. Purwar said today. He was speaking at a function that celebrated two hundred years of the SBI.

 Senior SBI officials said the bank will complete its acquisition in a phased manner. SBI will initially acquire a 55-60 per cent stake each in these two banks and gradually increase its holding.

 The Reserve Bank of India has already given an in-principle approval, after which SBI started a due diligence exercise on these two banks.

 The Central Bank of Kenya has approved the acquisition. However, approval from Indonesias regulator is pending.

 In October last year, SBI had entered into an agreement to buy 76 per cent of Giro Commercial Bank for $7 million. 

 Nairobi-based Giro Commercial Bank was formed after the merger of Giro Bank with Commercial Bank in 1998 in the wake of a liquidity crisis faced by small banks in Kenya.

 It is a closely held bank with an asset base of $60 million in August 2005. The bank was founded by people of Indian origin, with six branches in Nairobi, Mombassa and Kisumu.

 SBI already has offices in Nigeria and South Africa. This is SBIs second acquisition this year after the $8-million purchase of Indian Ocean International Bank in Mauritius in February. 

 SBI has been eyeing banks in Asia and Africa to expand overseas operations to 15-20 per cent of its profits in two to three years compared with 5-6 per cent now.

 Speaking on the occasion, finance minister P. Chidambaram asked SBI to prepare itself to face competition both from domestic and foreign banks. In the near future, SBI will have to play a very major role with an outward leaning growth strategy.

 He said the share of retail lending in India is still modest compared with international standards at 10 per cent of GDP against 50-60 per cent in Asian countries like Malaysia and Singapore and 90-100 per cent in developed countries.

 On the recent crash in the stock market, Purwar refused to specify the quantum of purchases that SBI made but said it was a good buying opportunity. He said purchases were made by dealers on behalf of the bank.

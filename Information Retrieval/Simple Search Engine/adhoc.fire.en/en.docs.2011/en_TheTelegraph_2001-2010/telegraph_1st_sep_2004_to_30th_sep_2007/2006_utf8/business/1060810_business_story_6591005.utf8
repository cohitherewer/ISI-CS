 Nicco debt rejig package okayed

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 9:Nicco Corporation Limited would restructure debt worth Rs 210 crore by March 2012.

 Calcutta High Court and financial institutions have approved the companys debt restructuring package.

 We believe that the future is bright and the CDR package would help the company retain a positive financial performance in the quarters ahead. The package will include interest rate reduction, part write-off of funded interest term loan and profit on sale of land, building and infrastructure of the erstwhile jelly-filled cable factory to Nicco Biotech Limited, chairman Rajive Kaul said at the 23rd annual general meeting of the company.

 The CDR cell has approved the restructuring in two phases, the interim one beginning in June 2005 and the final one in March 2006.

 The interim phase comprised financial restructuring, moratorium in repayment of principal, funding of interest for four months and conversion of Rs 9 crore institutional loan into equity.

 The debt restructuring exercise has helped the company post a profit after tax of Rs 68 lakh in 2005-06 for the first time in the last five years.

 In the final phase, the land, building and infrastructure of the telecom cable unit at Kalyani will be transferred to Nicco Biotech Ltd. The surplus machinery of the jelly-filled telecom cable will be used to set up North Eastern Cables Limited, a cable company in Assam.

 North Eastern Cables would start operations in a year, Kaul said.

 The package included infusion of fresh capital of Rs 20 crore. This would help the company complete its restructuring by March 2012. Earlier, the completion date was set at March 2018.

 Under the package, the Bengal government has converted Rs 4.81 crore sales tax loan into an eight-year soft loan with a moratorium of three years.

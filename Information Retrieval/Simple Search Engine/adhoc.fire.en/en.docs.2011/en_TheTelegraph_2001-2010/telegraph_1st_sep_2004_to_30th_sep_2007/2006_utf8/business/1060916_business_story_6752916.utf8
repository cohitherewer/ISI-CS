 Millennium Telecom pulls out of ILD race

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 15: The Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited (MTNL) has withdrawn the application seeking international long distance (ILD) licence from the department of telecommunication (DoT) for its joint venture company, Millennium Telecom Company.

 MTNL has, however, not withdrawn the ILD licence that it had applied for to start services from Delhi and Mumbai. MTNL had applied for two ILD licences, one on behalf of Millennium Telecom and the other for itself to expand to overseas markets from the two metros Delhi and Mumbai. 

 Senior DoT official Gobind Singhal confirmed that it has already sent a letter of intent (LoI) to MTNL towards its ILD application. 

 MTNL CMD R.S.P. Sinha said, Millennium Telecom is not prepared to pay Rs 2.5 crore towards the ILD licence fee. So we have withdrawn the application.

 Millennium Telecom can rethink the issue of ILD licence after formally signing the joint venture next week, he added.

 The ILD segment, with players like Reliance, Bharti and Data Access, is highly price-sensitive and competitive. Millennium Telecom is a joint venture between MTNL and Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL), which will oversee the building and operating of the undersea cable business of the PSUs. Millennium Telecom will lay a Rs 1,800-crore undersea cable to Singapore and a similar sub-marine link to West Asia, which will then be extended to the US and Europe.

 Sources from both PSUs had earlier confirmed that the shareholders agreement will be finalised next week and would be signed by both partners.

 Millennium Telecom would be a 51:49 joint venture, with MTNL holding the larger stake. Both PSUs have finalised the structure and sorted out all issues involved in setting up of the JV. According to the deal, Millennium Telecom will only act as an infrastructure provider and not as an international long distance service provider.

 MTNL, which has added 10.5 lakh subscribers in 2005-06, taking its market share to 19 per cent, is looking forward to acquiring the ILD licence in India so that it can expand its operations in the country and provide lower long distance tariffs to its consumers.

Earlier this week, the PSU had bid for a second national 

telecom operator licence in Kenya along with BSNL.

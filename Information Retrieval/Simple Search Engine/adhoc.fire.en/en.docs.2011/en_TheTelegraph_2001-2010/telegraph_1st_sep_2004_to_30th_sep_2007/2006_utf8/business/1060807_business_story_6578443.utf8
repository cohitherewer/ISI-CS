 Radico uncorks $75m funds plan

 Calcutta, Aug. 6: Radico Khaitan aims to raise $75 million from overseas to fund its expansion and acquisition plans. 

 Rabo India Securities, the Indian arm of Netherlands-based Rabobank, will advise the company on the acquisitions, both in India and abroad.

 The company plans to float cumulative compulsory convertible preference shares to some foreign institutional investors to raise $75 million, a Radico spokesperson said. 

 For buying out brands as well as companies in the domestic market, we are actually looking at the eastern and western regions where we do not have a significant presence. Besides, we would like to buy those companies or brands which complement our portfolio, a Radico official said. 

 The official said the company was not interested in Jagatjit Industries which reportedly was planning to sell its liquor division. Jagatjit manufactures the popular Aristrocrat and Bonnie Scot whiskey brands. There are contradictory reports about Jagatjit planning to sell its liquor division. If you look at our recent acquisitions, you will understand that we would rather prefer to buy a strong regional player with a strong brand, the official added.

 Radico Khaitan bought eight key brands of Brihan Maharashtra Sugar Syndicate for Rs 35 crore last September. 

 At the extraordinary general meeting in June, the shareholders approved the proposal to raise up to $125 million through FCCBs, global depository receipts and other instruments.

 The Delhi-based company was also in the race to take over Shaw Wallace.

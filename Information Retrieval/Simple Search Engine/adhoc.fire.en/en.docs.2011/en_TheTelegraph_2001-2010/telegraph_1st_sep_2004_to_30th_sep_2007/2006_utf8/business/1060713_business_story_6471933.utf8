 Blue amp; Blues sets up shop in Gurgaon

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 12: Blue and Blues ? a premium leather accessories brand from Italy ? today entered the Indian market by opening a showroom at MGF Mall in Gurgaon. The products will also be available at leading retail outlets across the country.

 Blue amp; Blues is expected to become a Rs 35-crore brand in three years in India, said Praveen Agarwal, director of Blue and Blues Fashions Pvt Ltd. The company plans to invest about Rs 10-12 crore over the next few years on retail expansion. These outlets are to be company-owned, but we may also consider the franchisee model.

 He said the company was considering setting up a new manufacturing unit in north India to cater to domestic as well as export markets.

 The manufacturing facility could be set up as a JV with the Italian parent and would meet domestic as well as export requirements, he said.

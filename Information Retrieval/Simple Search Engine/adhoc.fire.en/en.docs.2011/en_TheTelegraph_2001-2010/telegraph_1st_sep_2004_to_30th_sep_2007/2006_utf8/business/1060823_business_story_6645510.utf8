 New Delhi, Aug. 22: Tyre company Goodyear India is more than doubling the capacity at its plant in Aurangabad at an investment of Rs 80 crore over the next couple of years.

 Post-expansion, the plants production capacity is expected to increase from 4,500 to 10,000 tyres a day.

 We have already invested Rs 80 crore on capacity expansion at our Aurangabad plant. The expansion will be complete in the next two to three years, said Antonio Capellini, chairman and managing director (South Asia) of Goodyear. 

 Goodyear has a second manufacturing location at Ballabgarh in Haryana.

 The company plans to set up 300 shop-in-shop multi-brand outlets across the country at an investment of Rs 50 crore.

 Goodyear will set up 50 such stores in 2006 and will add another 250 by 2008.

 Apart from offering the whole range of Goodyears latest tyres, these showrooms will also offer a range of value-added products and services, Capelleni said.

 The first six stores will be opened in Chennai, followed by 12-15 in the north, south and west and 3-5 in the eastern region. We had sales of about Rs 900 crore in 2005-06 and hope to cross the Rs 1,000-crore figure this fiscal, said Capellini.

 In addition to passenger car tyres, those for commercial vehicles also contributed to the revenue of the company.

 Other tyre companies with Rs 1,000-crore sales include MRF, Apollo, JK Industries and Ceat. 

 According to Capellini, the company hopes to grow faster than the industry. 

 The industry is expected to grow at around 15 per cent and we would grow 2-3 per cent more than that, he said.

 The automobile industry is expanding, however, tyre companies in India are facing high costs of inputs as prices of rubber and other petro-based ingredients have increased.

 JK Industries and Apollo have already announced price hikes as margins have come under severe pressure.

 However, Capellini said, We have to see the market dynamics before going in for any such decision.

 At present, the tyre major enjoys a 15 per cent market share.

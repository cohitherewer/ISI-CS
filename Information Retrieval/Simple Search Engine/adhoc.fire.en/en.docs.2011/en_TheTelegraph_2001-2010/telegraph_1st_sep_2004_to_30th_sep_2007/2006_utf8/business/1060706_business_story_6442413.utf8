 Analjit hits back, family rift deepens

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 5: Max Healthcare chief Analjit Singh today launched a counter-attack on his sister-in-law Nimmi Singh and nephew Malvinder Singh, CEO of Ranbaxy, accusing them of orchestrating events to malign him. Analjit is the chief beneficiary of Ranbaxy founder Bhai Mohan Singhs disputed will.

 A statement issued by the lawyers of Analjit said the accusations were false and mischievous and are emphatically denied. Various events were orchestrated at the behest of Nimmi Singh to prevent certain ongoing work at 15 Aurangzeb Road (the family house). It is categorically denied that the ongoing work was being carried out in any part of the premises being occupied by Mrs Singh and her family, Analjit said.

 He claimed that the entire property was owned by Delhi Guest House Pvt Limited and therefore, the question of his men trespassing on property owned by Nimmi did not arise.

 Meanwhile, Nimmi said the life of the entire family was under threat.

 This is not the way to carry on an amicable relationship. I was attacked, threatened and physically abused by goons who said not one member of the family of Parvinder Singh, including grandchildren, will be alive, she said.

 The conflict has cropped up over a wall being allegedly constructed within the Singh familys joint property at 15, Aurangzeb Road. 

 Meanwhile, Nimmi, the eldest daughter-in-law of Ranbaxy founder Bhai Mohan Singh, has still not filed a first-hand information (FIR) report on the alleged attack by her brother-in-laws men.

 C.L. Mina, sub-inspector of Tughlaq Road Police Station, New Delhi, said, No FIR has been lodged with us on this issue. Our senior officials may meet both parties and help them opt for an out-of-court settlement. As of now, we have referred the case to NDMC.

 He said the police is not concerned with the construction or demolition of any wall in the joint property of the Singh family. He said the issue was not under their jurisdiction but under that of the municipal authorities.

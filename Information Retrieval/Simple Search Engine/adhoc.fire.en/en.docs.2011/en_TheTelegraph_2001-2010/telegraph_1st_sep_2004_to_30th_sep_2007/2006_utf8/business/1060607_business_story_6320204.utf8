 GM sets March date for Spark rollout

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Balendran: Upbeat

 New Delhi, June 6: General Motors India (GMI) is likely to roll out the Chevy Spark from its Halol facility in Gujarat by March 2007.

 It will be a refurbished version of Daewoo?s small car Matiz. 

 The Spark will mark GMI?s entry into the volume car market in India.

 ?The Spark will be manufactured at our existing facility in Halol and will be launched in March next year,? said P. Balendran, vice-president of GMI. The new car will give competition to small cars like the Alto and Santro.

 GMI has set a target of cornering a 10 per cent market share by 2010 by selling more than 2 lakh units. At present, its market share is between 2.5 per cent and 3 per cent. 

 According to analysts, a significant increase in GMI?s market share is possible if the company is successful in the small car segment.

 Meanwhile, sources say GMI has firmed up plans to set up its second manufacturing facility at Talegaon near Pune in Maharashtra.

 General Motors has been considering setting up a second plant since it gave up its plans to acquire Daewoo India?s assets. 

 It had narrowed down on two states ? Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra.

 Company officials, however, did not confirm the development. 

 ?We are looking at many options for increasing our existing capacity...setting up another base is just one of them. We have not finalised Maharashtra as our second location. The company will make an announcement in the next three to four months?, said Balendran.

 The company will hike the capacity at Halol to 85,000 units from 60,000 by year- end. 

 will take GM India?s investments to Rs 1,400 crore.

 Officials, however, made it clear that the company does not intend to increase the capacity at Halol above 85,000 units.

 On whether the second plant will become an export hub for GM India, Balendran said, ?I cannot disclose anything at this moment?. 

 At present, the company exports the Chevrolet Optra, Tavera and Aveo to Bangladesh and Nepal.

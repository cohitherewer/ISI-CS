 Heavyweights steel for ore export battle

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 6: Iron ore exporters and steel makers have started lobbying against each other in New Delhi.

 Ore exporters, led by Karnataka-based miner Rahul Baldota, met Prithviraj Chavan, the minister of state in Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs office, and commerce minister Kamal Nath.

 Steel bigwigs Sajjan Jindal, B. Muthuraman, Vinode Mittal and Pawan Ruia and representatives of SAIL and Vizag Steel are expected to start their campaign on Friday by meeting the secretaries of steel, mines, finance, industry and commerce. 

 Several chief ministers, including those of Bengal, Jharkhand and Orissa, have already written to the Prime Minister on their behalf.

 The Left parties have already shown support for steel mills and opposed the policy of unrestricted iron ore export, which has been advocated by the Hoda committee. Local units of the BJP and Congress parties in Karnataka and Jharkhand have, however, been supportive of iron ore exporters.

 What we are trying to say is that there is enough iron ore in India to satisfy the needs of steel mills and have enough leftover for exports ... some 75 per cent of the ore mined here is for exports. What will happen to all this if we dont export? asked Baldota. 

 The iron ore exporters, mainly from Karnataka, Jharkhand and Orissa, hope to meet Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia, mines minister of state Subirami Reddy, steel minister Ram Vilas Paswan and secretaries of all the departments concerned in the next seven days.

 Steel makers, however, argue that India should follow a policy similar to that of China and Russia and gradually phase out export of high-grade ore, which should be kept for domestic steel makers. India currently consumes about 35 kg of steel per head, but this figure is expected to increase to 300 kg by 2020. Hence, any long-term policy should take this future consumption and production in mind, they said. 

 Muthuraman, in notes sent to the Planning Commission, said this means Indias steel output has to increase from 180 mt annually to 450 mt. Steel lobbyists argue this means India will need some 720 mt of iron ore by then and point out that steel makers have floated plans to do so by signing pacts with state governments for new steel mills and expansion of older ones. 

 But iron ore exporters have a different stand. Some 43 MoUs were signed with the Orissa government and 40 with Jharkhand for steel mills. This happened over a four-year period. Nothing has happened till date. We believe these MoUs are not signed to set up steel mills, but merely to block each other from taking any position of advantage, argued Siddharth Rungta, president of Rungta Mines. 

 H.C. Daga, senior president of Aditya Birla groups Essel Mining, said, The real fight is between big steel mills and secondary steel makers who could benefit if independent mining operations expand and is able to supply them too with high grade raw iron ore. What big steel mills want is captive ore supplies which starve others.

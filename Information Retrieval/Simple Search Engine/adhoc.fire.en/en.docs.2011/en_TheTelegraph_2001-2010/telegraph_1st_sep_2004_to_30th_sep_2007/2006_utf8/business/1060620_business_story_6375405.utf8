 Sensex rallies on FII support

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Mumbai, June 19: The sensex rally continued for the third day in a row on strong buying support from foreign institutional investors (FIIs) and the market regulators decision to take steps to curb market volatility.

 The 113.33-point gain in the bellwether index was led by Reliance (RIL). 

 Brokers said apart from RIL, other counters also saw investor interest, though buying remained selective. The markets, which were largely influenced by a downtrend in Asia during the day, boosted at the fag end of the session, driven by a firm trend in early trade in European bourses.

 While Asian markets like Japan, Singapore, Korea and Hong Kong witnessed a bearish trend, their European counterparts such as London, Germany and France remained strong in early trade.

 The BSE sensex, which swung between 10049.94 and 9755.21, opened firm at 9903.11 and then drifted to the days low of 9755.21 on weak Asian cues.

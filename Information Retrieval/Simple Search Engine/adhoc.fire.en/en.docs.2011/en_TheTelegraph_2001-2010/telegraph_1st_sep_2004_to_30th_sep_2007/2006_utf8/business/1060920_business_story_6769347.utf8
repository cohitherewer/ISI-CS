 Fag-end jitters to sensex rally

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Sept. 19: Large-scale profit booking saw the sensex make a sharp U-turn in late trading session today and plunge by over 100 points to end below the 12000-level. 

 The index has been on a high since it got clobbered on September 11 and had gained 520.61 points since then. 

 According to dealers, this bout of correction was expected as the index was showing signs of fatigue at the higher levels. Unless the market consolidates at 11900-12000, it will be difficult to sustain the higher levels, an analyst said. 

 The bellwether index opened firm at 12103.44 compared with yesterdays close of 12071.30 and hit an intra-day high of 12152.60. 

 Foreign institutional investors have been active buyers in the cash segment during the last week. They invested a net of Rs 1,444 crore till September 15. On Monday, they bought shares worth a net of Rs 106.40 crore. 

 However, on heavy selling near the days close, the sensex collapsed 237.39 points to hit a low of 11915.21 and later ended at 11970.47, a fall of 100.83 points or 0.84 per cent over its previous close. 

 The selloff spread across the counters, which took the steam from the mid and small cap stocks also. Of 2,603 shares traded on the Bombay Stock Exchange, 1,589 declined against 944, which gained, while 70 shares remained unchanged. The trading volume was, however, high at Rs 3,706.58 crore against yesterdays Rs 2,898.56.

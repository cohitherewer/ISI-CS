 SAIL scouts for mines in Poland, Russia

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 New Delhi, Jan. 4: Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) is considering joint ventures to take over greenfield coal mines in Poland and Russia.

 Teams from the steel company had visited Poland and Russia to look at the mines being offered, which were new blocks in existing coal belts, SAIL chairman V.S. Jain told The Telegraph.

 Jain said he would look at three-way joint ventures with Coal India and Russian and Polish companies to tap these offerings. We are open to talks on stakes, but will insist on long-term deals for coal supplies from these mines ... our supplies could be higher than the pro-rata norm fixed by the equity stake we pick up, he added.

 SAIL has been looking around for foreign coal equity in a manner similar to the oil equity hunt launched by ONGC after long-term supplies from Australia were hit.

 Earlier, after due diligence in Tahmoor and Maruwai ? mines in Australia and Indonesia, respectively ? the company had decided not to buy as they did not have significant reserves. A tentative tie-up with BHP for this is likely to die out.

 The Russian and Polish offers are, however, considered better blocks as they are virgin mines.

 Last year, SAIL had come under a cloud over spot coal purchases made after its Australian suppliers claimed their mines had been flooded.

 Commercial director S.K. Rungta, who was co-ordinating a committee which bought coal, was in a controversy after several MPs wrote letters attacking the purchase decisions. Rungta went on leave and steel minister Ram Vilas Paswan conducted a probe into the deals.

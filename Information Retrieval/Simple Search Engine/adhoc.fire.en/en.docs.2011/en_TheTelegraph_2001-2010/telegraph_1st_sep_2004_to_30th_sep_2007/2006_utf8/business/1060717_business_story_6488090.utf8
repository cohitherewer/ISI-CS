 Ship builders ride the crest of order boom

 Hard at work

 Mumbai, July 16: Indias shipbuilding industry, like its counterparts elsewhere, is on a roll.

 The shipyards in India are buzzing with activity ever since the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) has directed the global shipping industry to start using double hull oil tankers by 2010.

 Even as existing Indian shipbuilding companies face robust order books, the bullish phase has also seen new applicants venturing into this business.

 Take the case of ABG Shipyard, the largest private sector shipyard in the country. Its order book position stands at around Rs 2,310 crore, which includes 48 ships that are under construction. In 2006, the company has received orders worth Rs 1,017 crore. The big orders have come from ESL Shipping, Finland for Rs 275 crore, Lamnalco of Cyprus for Rs 132 crore and Sea Tankers Management Company, a part of John Fredriksen Group, for Rs 270 crore.

 Public sector Cochin Shipyard and Larsen amp; Toubro (L amp;T) have order books worth Rs 960 crore and Rs 440 crore respectively. L amp;T, a relatively new entrant in this area, recently announced that it has secured an order for four ships from Zadeko Ship Management of the Netherlands even as other leading shipping companies across the world have also contacted the company to augment their fleet. The engineering firms venture into shipbuilding is being met through its modern complex at Hazira in Gujarat.

 While these order books may pale in comparison to the demand put on other shipyards in Korea, Japan and China, they still convey an optimistic picture. Shipping industry circles reveal that due to the IMOs decision that prevents them from using single hull tankers four years hence, overseas shipyards are fully booked till 2009. South Korean shipyards are finding their order backlog shooting to over 1,000 vessels. South Korea and Japan currently account for more than 60 per cent of the ships on order in terms of dead weight tonnage (DWT).

 India, in this context, is only beginning to make its presence felt in the global scene. Industry observers say the country can grow at a faster clip due to inherent advantages that the sector has. India, they add, can score on competitiveness on account of its skilled and cheap labour force. This is a major positive factor considering the fact that ship building costs have gone up in recent times. Moreover, there is also the presence of the steel fabrication industry, which is an added advantage.

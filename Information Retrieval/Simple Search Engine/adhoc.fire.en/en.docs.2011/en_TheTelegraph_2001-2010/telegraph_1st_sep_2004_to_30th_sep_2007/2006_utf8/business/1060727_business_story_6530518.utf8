 Calcutta, July 26: BOC shareholders will have to wait till September to know the details of an expected open offer by German engineering company Linde Group after it buys out BOC Plc.

 Linde Group proposed to acquire BOC Plc in January. Earlier this month, the company received clearance from the United States Federal Trade Commission for the proposed acquisition of BOC Plc.

 E.R. Raj Narayanan, managing director of BOC India Ltd, where BOC Plc holds a 54.8 per cent stake, said the acquisition would be completed by September. We are not clear of what the exact procedure will be. But, as we understand, the issue of open offer will be decided only after September, he said.

 He said the identity of BOC would be retained by Linde for the time being. At a later date, the German company will take a call on the issue.

 The integration of Linde with BOC, which already has a leadership position in the gas business in the country, will create a formidable force.

 Linde will bring project engineering skills while BOCs strength lies in gas business. The German firm has a base in Baroda. 

 After the integration, the two companies will jointly bid for projects in steel, petrochemicals and chemicals.

 Steel now accounts for 60 per cent of BOCs business. The company is negotiating for a large project from Reliances greenfield refinery at Jamnagar. BOC signed a long-term contract to supply gas for an expansion programme underway at JSW Steel Limited (JSW) at Bellary, Karnataka.

 Quarterly figures

 BOC has posted a net profit of Rs 28.5 crore in the April-June quarter of 2006-07 compared with Rs 11.36 crore in the corresponding quarter of the last fiscal, mainly on the back of extraordinary earnings of Rs 24.29 crore from the sale of property at Chennai.

 In the same period, net sales went up from Rs 102.14 crore in the first quarter of last fiscal to 109.09 crore.

 Bad weather spells 

doom for tea output

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Hard at work

 Calcutta, June 5: North Indian tea production is down by 14 million kg in April.

 Bengal produced 9,298 kg compared with 17,096 kg in April 2005. Production from January to April, including Darjeeling, Dooars and Terai regions, was down to 24,452 kg from 30,860 kg during January-April 2005.

 The total north Indian production, including Assam, stood at 32,755 kg against 46,621 kg in April 2005.

 Sporadic showers have brought intermittent relief. But dry spells, coupled with temperatures hovering between 35 and 37 degrees and extreme weather conditions, have resulted in this drastic shortfall, experts said.

 North India produced 84,380 kg in the January-April period compared with 95,299 kg in the year-ago period.

 Total south Indian production, however, fared better at 23,674 kg against 23,083 kg in April last year.

 North Indian tea exports stood at 3,996 kg compared with 4,652 kg in April 2005. The unit price was Rs 120.82 per kg against Rs 130.80 per kg in the year-ago period. Around 18,156 kg were exported from January to April against 23,917 kg in the same period last year.

 ESI benefits

 The Employees State Insurance (ESI) scheme might now be extended to tea employees. Tea was excluded from ESI benefits till now because it is a seasonal product.

 We will consider bringing tea employees within the ESI fold following the recommendations of the parliamentary standing committee, said Ramesh Inder Singh, director-general, ESI Corporation.

 The proposal would be placed before the ESIC board in its June 15 meeting. Workers of gardens and factories that are open for more than seven months a year would be eligible for this scheme.

 Yahoo boss takes stock of his share

 Semel: Profit time

 San Francisco, April 15 (Reuters): Yahoo Incs chief executive Terry Semel exercised options on 7 million shares, which after deducting the prices paid for the stock, netted him $173.6 million in 2005, the company said in a US regulatory filing on Friday.

 Semel, the chairman and CEO of the worlds largest Internet media company, also received restricted stock now worth $7.8 million and out-of-the-money options to buy 3.3 million shares as 2005 compensation, Yahoo said in the filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.

 A former Hollywood movie mogul turned Internet investor, Semel took over as Yahoos top executive five years ago. He held another 17 million in unexercised options at the end of 2005 that could be worth roughly $236 million.

 On joining Yahoo in 2001, he was granted options to buy 20 million shares, which fully vested in April 2005. From 2003 through the end of 2005, Semel sold Yahoo shares worth around $429 million.

 The options on 3.3 million shares awarded to Semel in 2005 include 2 million shares at a strike price of $34.75 and a bonus option on 1.3 million shares in lieu of cash, with a strike price of $40.68, or 33 per cent above the price on the day of the grant, according to Yahoo spokeswoman Joanna Stevens.

 Based on Yahoos closing price on Thursday of $31.13, the current value of these options is zero. Yahoo stock has lost 20.5 per cent of its value since the start of 2006.

 The value of the restricted stock, which was $8.69 million on the day of the grant, has since fallen to $7.8 million.

 In contrast, Semel received options to buy 7.2 million shares in 2004. These included a bonus option of 1.8 million shares and an annual review option of 4 million shares, resulting in a total current value of $59.6 million. An additional 1.4 million shares were granted in December 2004 at a strike price of $37.08, which remain out of the money.

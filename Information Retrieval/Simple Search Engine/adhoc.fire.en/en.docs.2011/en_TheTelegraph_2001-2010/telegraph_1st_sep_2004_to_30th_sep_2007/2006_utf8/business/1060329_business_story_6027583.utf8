 Hind Lever packs price-push punch

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Costly proposition

 Mumbai, March 28: Hindustan Lever Ltd (HLL), which has a new expatriate chief executive finally in place, is beginning to flex its muscles.

 The FMCG giant has decided to raise the prices of its stellar brands such as Surf, Lifebuoy and Fair amp; Lovely as it seeks to once again dominate the marketplace. 

 Its part of a strategy that has been hammered out over the past few months under which HLL plans to raise the prices of its dominant brands even as it battles for a greater marketshare. 

 About two years ago, the company was forced into an unwinnable war with Procter amp; Gamble that started an aggressive round of price cuts. 

 That phase appears to be over. 

 This is the third round of price increase by the FMCG behemoth since February last year when it raised the prices of Surf Excel Quickwash, Surf Excel Blue and Rin Advanced Powder close on the heels of Procter amp; Gamble (P amp;G) hiking prices of some packs of Ariel and Tide. 

 Two kg Surf Excel Matic will cost Rs 280 against Rs 250, an increase of 12 per cent, while 1.5 kg Surf Excel Blue will cost 3 per cent more at Rs 110 from Rs 107 earlier. 

 A 100-gm bar of Lifebouy will now cost Rs 10 against Rs 9 earlier, a hike of 11 per cent. Fair amp; Lovelys 25-gm tube will now be 7 per cent dearer at Rs 30 against earlier Rs 28. 

 The price of Lakme range has been increased for the first time in two years. 

 A 200-gm Lakme sunscreen pack will now be 10 per cent expensive at Rs 154 against earlier Rs 140. 

 The second round of price increase was brought about in November last year when the consumer goods majors further hiked the prices of detergent brands, Surf Excel and Ariel by 4 to 5 per cent. 

 This time around, P amp;G is watching the situation to see how things unfold before deciding on its response. But the market analysts are fairly certain that they will also follow suit. 

 However, as opposed to the open price war between the two companies a couple of years back, the domestic consumer goods giants seem to have decided to take cues from the market dynamics rather than fight a bitter competitive battle, said FMCG analysts. 

 The FMCG sector has been witnessing significant growth for the last four quarters and the outlook remains positive for the current year also, riding on return of pricing power to the manufacturer and strong GDP growth resulting in strong consumption demand, they said.

 Asset prices keep RBI on the edge

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Close vigil 

 Mumbai, March 18: The Reserve Bank of India is not unduly worried about inflation. Instead, the central bank feels the impact of the increase in asset prices and credit have emerged as major challenges that could lead to financial instability.

 The observations were made by the RBI in its report on currency and finance, which was released here today. 

 In the area of monetary policy, the low and stable inflation coupled with very strong banks have changed the monetary dynamics. Consequently, while rising inflation is no longer a major concern, excessive increase in asset prices and credit have emerged as major challenges facing the central bank as this can lead to financial instability, the RBI said in its report. 

 Inflation, as measured by the wholesale price index, is at 4.02 per cent, below the RBIs estimate of 5-5.5 per cent for the year ending March 31, 2006. 

 Even as the inflation has remained low, the central bank has often voiced concern about rising asset prices. 

 It has also been worried about the pace of growth in credit as it may lead to an asset bubble.

 However, the central bank was quick to indicate that inflationary pressures might resurface again as the second round impact of higher crude oil prices was yet to be felt by the country. 

 The possibility of a higher degree of second round effects and its implications for inflation expectations continue to be a matter of concern, the report added. 

 RBI believes if inflation expectations are anchored at low levels, a proactive monetary policy can ensure a stable and low interest rate regime that is conducive to maintaining the momentum of economic growth. 

 For the medium term, the RBI listed increasing openness of the Indian economy and the management of liquidity following strong capital inflows as the challenges. 

 The central bank is of the opinion that as there is a trade-off between excessive volatility in financial markets and exchange rates, it has to properly balance its sterilisation operations.

 The RBI added that the implementation of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act 2003 was likely to have a bearing on the size and evolution of the money and government securities markets in the coming years. 

 The act will put an end to RBIs participation in primary auctions of central government securities from April 1 this year. According to the Reserve Bank, this would call for greater co-ordination with the government for ensuring stability in the financial market.

 On the other hand, it will provide the central bank greater control over the composition of its balance sheet and provide flexibility in monetary operations. 

 In the forex market, the report said, further liberalisation of the capital account in line with the recommendations for capital account convertibility could pose fresh challenges for RBI. 

 While the Reserve Bank has continued to conduct banking business of the government, the view that has gained prominence is that the apex bank should assign retail banking business of the government to agency banks with a view to ensuring that, in the long run, it will maintain only the principal accounts of the government, leaving day-to-day banking business to commercial banks functioning as its agents.

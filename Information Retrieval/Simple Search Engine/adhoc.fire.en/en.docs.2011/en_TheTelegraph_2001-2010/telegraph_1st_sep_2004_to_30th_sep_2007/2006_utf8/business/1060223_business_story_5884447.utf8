 Europe bourses mull merger

 Frankfurt, Feb. 22 (Reuters): Deutsche Boerse wants a merger with rival Euronext to create a truly pan-European securities market group, the German stock market operators chief executive said on Wednesday.

 A merger between Deutsche Boerse and Euronext would be a major step towards integration of the European financial markets as a whole, CEO Reto Francioni told a news conference.

 Elaborating on remarks about Deutsche Boerses quest for talks with Euronext he had made in a statement on Tuesday, Francioni said a merged Deutsche Boerse-Euronext group would be a natural nucleus for the further consolidation of European stock exchanges.

 We are inviting Euronext in particular and other potential partners to a continuation of a dialogue with the aim of achieving European stock exchange consolidation, he said.

 A Euronext spokesman said the company, which runs the stock exchanges in Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels and Lisbon, would examine closely Deutsche Boerses fresh merger talks invitation.

 Kevin Byram said Euronext was open for talks but that differences of opinion remained between it and Deutsche Boerse.

 Shares in Deutsche Boerse were 0.3 per cent higher, while Euronext shares were up 0.4 per cent.

 Francioni said he was convinced that positive solutions are within reach but declined to give a timetable.

 Deutsche Boerses supervisory board was not informed in advance of Francionis plans for merger talks with Euronext, two sources close to the supervisory board said.

 No hostile bid 

 The supervisory board met on Tuesday to review the companys fourth-quarter and full-year 2005 accounts.

 I can confirm that the supervisory board did not discuss the matter, one source said. We must see what Francioni actually wants.. The supervisory board does not want a hostile bid, the source said.

 Asked why the supervisory board had not been informed, Francioni said had not been necessary as Deutsche Boerse had not started any actual merger negotiations.

 Consolidation would strengthen European securities markets in relation to non-European operators, particularly those in the United States, and would also make European capital markets more attractive for investors and issuers, Francioni said.

 A combination of Deutsche Boerse and Euronext would create the first truly European exchange organisation capable of asserting a claim to global leadership, he said.

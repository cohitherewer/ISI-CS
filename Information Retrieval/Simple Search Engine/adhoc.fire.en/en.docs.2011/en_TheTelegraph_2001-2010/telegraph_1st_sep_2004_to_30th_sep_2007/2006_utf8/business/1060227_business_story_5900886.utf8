 Polls keep nerves on edge

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Feb. 26: With only a day left for Palaniappan Chidambaram to unveil the Union Budget for 2006-07, Dalal Street is nervous at point 10200. The moot question plaguing investors minds is whether the finance minister will be able to go ahead with his reform measures against the rising pressures from the Left allies, particularly when elections in some states are due in the next few months.

 It is the election factor rather than the pressure from the Left that is worrying stock market pundits more. There is a lurking fear that Chidambaram will take recourse to populist measures and junk hardcore reform moves, given the upcoming Assembly elections. Incidentally, Tamil Nadu, the finance ministers home state, is also going in for Assembly elections this year.

 People are nervous and cautious before the budget. There is a fear that the finance minister may walk the populist way ahead of the Assembly elections and amidst Left pressure. This has kept many investors away from the markets at current levels. Investors are holding back their cash which they may put in only after the budget, said a portfolio manager associated with a large brokerage.

 The stock market indices, which are at the threshold of record highs, need a strong signal from the finance minister through his budget so that they continue chugging ahead from current levels.

 This is because other cues suggest some challenging times ahead for equities. 

 While interest rates are rising, uncertainty over crude oil prices still remains. Corporate Indias rosy margins during the second quarter have started fading in the third quarter and the fourth quarter doesnt hold any promise in particular.

 The jury is still out on whether equities will see a massive slide if the finance minister fails to include hardcore reform measures in his budget proposals. While a few believe that shares could come under intense selling pressure as they are over-valued at this point of time, there are others who point out that ample liquidity with key investors, such as mutual funds and foreign institutional investors, will stem any drastic decline.

 The mutual funds have raked in more than Rs 6,000 crore through new schemes. A large part of these funds are waiting to be deployed. Therefore, if the markets do fall, we could then see the mutual funds coming and making purchases, said a broker.

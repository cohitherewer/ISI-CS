 Calcutta, July 12: Tata Motors is looking for new export destinations for its blockbuster mini-truck, ACE. It has already doubled the mini-truck capacity at its Pune plant to 60,000 units.

 The company is also firming up plans to launch a rural transport vehicle (RTV) next year.

 The model, which has been indigenously designed to penetrate the sub-one-tonne segment populated by three wheelers, has undergone a host of innovations to cater to domestic demand ? from delivery van to garbage tipper ? and might don a new look for the expanding export market.

 ?There are currently 42,000 ACE plying on Indian roads and it has created a new segment with innovative features. We have ensured that the mini-truck caters to a host of industries with multiple applications,? said Shyam Mani, vice-president, sales and marketing, Tata Motors.

 The company, which exports to Sri Lanka, plans to extend to other Saarc countries and also look at markets where there is a considerable Tata presence like Latin America, South Africa, Indonesia and Thailand.

 The sub-one-tonne category in which ACE operates recorded a sales of 1.36 lakh vehicles last year.

 The company is open to increasing the tonnage or add air-conditioners and power steering in addition to the existing combination switches and other car-like features.

 The RTV will expand the utility of the truck as a study conducted by Tata Motors has revealed that around 68 per cent of its business comes from suburban or rural areas.

 Tata Motors plans to sell one-lakh mini trucks this fiscal. Regarding utilising the Uttaranchal plant to manufacture ACE, Mani said the details are being worked out.

 The twin-cylinder, 16bhp truck priced at Rs 2,49,225 was rolled out in Bengal today. It was the company?s 10th launch in the country.

 ?The south and Maharashtra comprises around 70 per cent of ACE sales and we hope that after it is launched in this region, the options available in intra-city goods transport will expand,? Mani added.

 The company has increased its point of sales from 200 in 2004 to more than 500 and plans to have 1,000 sales point across the country by 2007.

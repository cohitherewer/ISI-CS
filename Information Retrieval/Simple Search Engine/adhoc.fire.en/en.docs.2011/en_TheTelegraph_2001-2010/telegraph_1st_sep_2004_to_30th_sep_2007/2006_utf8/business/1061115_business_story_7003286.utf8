 Vodafone beats half-year forecast

 Clear signal

 London, Nov. 14 (Reuters): Vodafone Group Plc topped forecasts for half-year earnings and tweaked up some of its full-year expectations on Tuesday despite continuing tough European mobile markets, sending its shares to a 12-month peak. 

 British-based Vodafone said earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) for the first half to September 30 rose to 6.24 billion, well ahead of forecasts of between 5.98 billion and 6.19 billion. Underlying earnings per share also came in well ahead of the average market forecast at 5.98 pence, and Vodafone stuck to its full-year forecasts for organic mobile revenue growth of 5-6.5 per cent and EBITDA margins 1 percentage point lower. 

 However, it raised its outlook for free cash flow to 4.7-5.2 billion after it deferred some one-off taxes by a year and said it expected its effective tax rate for the full year and future years to be lower than previously indicated. 

 The operating performance looks solid. The tax charge is a little bit lower which helped the earnings and the cash flows. But lower taxes are still cash in the bank. Very little to complain about, I would say, said Richard Marwood, fund manager at AXA Investments, a Vodafone shareholder.

 CEO Arun Sarin, who faced shareholder discontent earlier this year over the groups slowing growth and strategy, said the growth had been flat in its mature European markets while its businesses in developing markets of eastern Europe, west Asia, Asia and Africa had grown 14 per cent. 

 Pricing is coming down Id say 15 per cent in our European markets. The fact that we are adding a lot of customers helps us maintain our revenue (growth) of about 6 per cent, said Sarin. 

 Vodafone said it had added 12 million new customers in the half year, taking its total base to 191 million users.

 Surprise knock 

 The group unveiled a surprise 8.1-billion ($15.5 billion) knock to the goodwill value at its German and Italian units, blaming higher interest rates along with pricing and continued regulatory pressures in the German market. 

 The fresh impairment charge dragged it to a headline loss of 4.55 billion. A similar impairment charge led Vodafone to report a 21.8-billion loss in the last fiscal year, the biggest in European corporate history. 

 However, shares in the group, already up 26 per cent in the last 3 months, shrugged off the headline losses and rose as much as 4 per cent, taking them to levels last seen just before interim results in November last year. 

 By 1012 GMT, the stock was up 1.7 per cent at 138-1/4p. 

 The stock still trades at nearly 13 times next years forecast earnings, compared with 14.1 per cent for the European telecom sector. 

 Morgan Stanley raised its price target for the stock to 155 pence from 145p. 

 Vodafone raised its interim dividend by 6.8 per cent to 2.35 pence a share, and reaffirmed plans to pay out 60 per cent of its earnings for the full year. The company has already stopped share buybacks this year, after spending billions last year. 

 It also paid out a special dividend of 9 billion last August, principally from the proceeds of its Japanese units disposal to Softbank Corp earlier this year. CEO Sarin, under whose watch the once acquisitive behemoth is making selective disposals to refine its portfolio, doused hopes it could exit France or the Swiss markets in a hurry. 

 Sarin said Vodafone was happy with its 44 per cent stake in French mobile operator SFR and the chances of its sale to partner Vivendi were highly unlikely and if anything, the group was interested in increasing its stake at the right price.

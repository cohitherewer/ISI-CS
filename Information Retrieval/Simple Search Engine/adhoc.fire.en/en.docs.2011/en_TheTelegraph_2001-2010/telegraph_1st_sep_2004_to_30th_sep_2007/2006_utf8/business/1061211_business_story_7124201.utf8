 Cairn to ship Rajasthan crude

 S.P.S. PANNU 

 Strong flow

 New Delhi, Dec. 10: In what appears to be an olive branch for Mangalore Refineries and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL), Cairn India Ltd is ready to participate in the laying of the 500-km pipeline from its Rajasthan oilfield to ensure the evacuation of crude begins in the first half of 2009. The project is expected to cost $500 million. 

 Cairn is aware that ONGC is not keen to let its subsidiary, MRPL, shoulder the entire burden of laying the pipeline. This could lead to a delay in the project, which would adversely impact Cairns revenues. 

 Cairn Indias chief executive officer Rahul Dhir said the company did not want to get caught in a situation where its Rajasthan field starts producing oil but there is no pipeline.

 He said to avoid such a situation, Cairn would look at the option of participating in the pipeline project to ensure it is completed in time.

 Dhir said the pipeline would cost around $1 million per km, which is 1.5 to 2 times the cost of a normal oil pipeline. 

 The cost of laying the pipeline is much higher because the crude in the Rajasthan field is of a waxy nature and tends to solidify even at normal temperatures. Other crudes are available as liquid. 

 To prevent the crude from solidifying, the temperature of the pipeline will have to be maintained at a higher level and thermal coating would be required to ensure this.

 Cairn has been maintaining that the production sharing contract allows selling the crude at the well head tankage of the Rajasthan field. At the same time, the company wants to sell the crude at international price. 

 MRPL, on the other hand, wants to factor in the cost of the pipeline in the crude price, as it would be saddled with a huge investment for the pipeline in addition to the cost of crude otherwise.

 Dhir said about half the crude it produces would go to the government and any discount in the price of the crude would also impact the government share. 

 But the problem would be sorted out with the involvement of the government, and Cairn was interested in meeting its time schedule for producing crude by the first half of 2009, he added.

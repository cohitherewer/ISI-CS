 Novartis makes way for Crucell in Berna bid

 Calling the shots

 Zurich/Amsterdam, Jan. 10 (Reuters): Swiss-based drug maker Novartis said it had decided not to make a takeover offer for vaccine maker Berna Biotech, clearing the way for a roughly $450-million bid by Dutch biotechnology firm Crucell NV.

 After completion of due diligence and an assessment of the potential benefits and risks of an acquisition, Novartis has decided not to make an offer for Berna Biotech, Novartis said.

 Crucell shareholders are expected to vote on the companys plan to take over Berna for around $450 million at a meeting later on Tuesday.

 We think the combination with Berna is a good one and it is up to the shareholders to decide, Harry Suykerbuyk, head of investor relations at Crucell, said.

 Berna is preparing for a shareholders meeting on Wednesday to seek approval for Crucells offer, which is endorsed by the target companys management. Crucell intends to fuse the two firms to create a larger vaccines player.

 Berna shares had slipped 8.6 per cent to 14.30 francs and Crucell was down 3.6 per cent at 21.6 euros at 0935 GMT.

 Crucell, which announced on Tuesday a cash position at the end of 2005 of 111.7 million euros ($134.9 million), has offered 0.447 new Crucell shares per Berna share, worth around 15.50 francs per Berna share, valuing the firm at slightly over 580 million francs.

 After Crucell made its interest clear, Novartis said that it too, was looking at the Swiss vaccines company, with a view to incorporating it with Chiron Corp, the Californian vaccine firm which Novartis offered to buy last year.

 Analysts at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein said Novartiss decision to walk away was good news for investors in the Swiss healthcare giant since it implied the group would not overpay or buy something just for the sake of it.

 Dutch brokerage Petercam said in a note that the complementarities between Chiron and Berna are lower than Novartis expected, hence reducing the appeal for the Swiss company.

 Petercam analysts also said: Berna management supported the Crucell bid and Novartis was afraid of a brain drain if it would continue.

 Novartis has a reputation as Europes most aggressive acquirer in the pharmaceutical sector, having spent $14 billion last year to boost its drug and vaccines businesses.

 Raymond plans city Zapp store

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Oct. 4: Raymond Ltd, which launched its second kids apparel store Zapp! in Mumbai today, is planning its next big store in Calcutta within the next fortnight. 

 The company, which recently made its foray into the kids wear segment with Zapp!, already has a store in Ahmedabad. The Zapp! stores come under Raymond Apparel Ltd, which is a 100 per cent subsidiary of Raymond.

 The Calcutta store will be bigger than the Mumbai one and will be close to 2500 sq ft, double storied and situated at the Forum Mall, Shreyas Joshi, president of Raymond Apparel Ltd told The Telegraph here today. 

 However, he said, Our store coming up in Pune at 4,000 sq ft will be the largest followed by Calcutta . 

 The company is not only planning single brand outlets, but is looking at multi-branded outlets and malls too. 

 We plan to have close to 10 stand-alone Zapp! stores by the end of this year and 70 point of sale stores (multi brand outlets) by March 31, 2007 , Gautam Singhania, CMD of Raymond said talking about the future plan of the brand. 

 The company is targeting kids of four to 12 years with these exclusive stores. According to a Technopak report, the kids market is valued at Rs 5,000 crore and is growing at a rate of 20-25 per cent. Some of the other major players like Pantaloon have entered this market recently. The company expects revenue of about Rs 30 crore from this format by 2008. 

 It costs around Rs 40 and Rs 50 lakh to set up a store and could take up to two years to break even depending on the response that we get, said Joshi. He, however, refused to divulge the total investment made by the company in this particular brand.

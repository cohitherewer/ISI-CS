 GMR issue priced at Rs 210

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Aug. 7: GMR Infrastructure has set the issue price of its maiden offer at Rs 210, the lower end of its estimated price band of Rs 210-250 per share. The company has raised over Rs 800 crore from its maiden offering. 

 The offering was over-subscribed by nearly seven times. When the issue closed last Friday, the qualified institutional buyer (QIB) portion was oversubscribed nearly 10 times, though the response was not as good in the HNR and retail categories. At the upper end of the band, GMR Infrastructure would have raised Rs 954 crore.

 GMR Infrastructure plans to invest part of the issue proceeds in various infrastructure special purpose vehicles, which are now in the development stage. Part of the IPO proceeds would go into its power trading, transmission and distribution foray. 

 The company had offered 3,81,36,980 shares in a price band of Rs 210-250. The offering opened a day ahead of Tech Mahindras IPO. 

 Analysts said though both these issues received good response from QIBs, the response from other two categories were relatively subdued, which indicates the cautious mood still prevalent among retail and other investors. 

 In the case of GMR Infrastructure, reports say the retail portion was not even fully subscribed.

 GMRs expertise are in the areas of development and operation of power plants and road projects.

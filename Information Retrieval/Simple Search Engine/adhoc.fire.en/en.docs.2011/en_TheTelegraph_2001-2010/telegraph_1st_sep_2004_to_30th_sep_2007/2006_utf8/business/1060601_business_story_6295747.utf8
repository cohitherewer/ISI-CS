The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Bengal date with bigwigs in January

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, May 31: Come January and Calcutta will play host to delegates from 27 countries, including at least four former Prime Ministers from as many countries of Europe and North America.

 The event, to be held under the aegis of the World Council for Corporate Governance, will be an opportunity for the state to showcase itself to a global audience, which will also include potential investors.

 Madhav Mehra, chairman of the London-based council, said a group of investors from the UK would come calling as well. The council is getting in touch with different state machinery, especially the chief ministers office, to send invitations to heads of states.

 At present, former Prime Ministers of The Netherlands, Portugal, Canada and Sweden have confirmed their attendance, Mehra added.

 Around 500 delegates will attend the 17th World Congress on Total Quality during January 12-14. More than 40 per cent of them would be from foreign countries. The theme will be enhancing corporate value through stakeholder engagement. The city will host this event for the first time.

 Bengal is now said to be one of the hottest destinations for investment in the country. Many people have heard about it but not experienced the ground reality. This will be an opportunity for them, he said.

 Information technology and food processing are two key sectors that the state government would highlight.

 The organisers have got in touch with these two departments. It is likely that some other departments would join the forum to make a strong sales pitch for the state.

 Observers feel that such interaction, even with former heads of states, would dispel some misgivings about Bengal.

 Rate hike cuts UBI profit

 Calcutta, June 14: United Bank of India (UBI) is feeling the pinch of a rising interest rate on its bottomline.

 The bank?s profit from operations slipped to Rs 643.85 crore in 2005-06 from Rs 689.64 crore in the previous fiscal primarily because of a higher provisioning of Rs 110 crore for depreciation of investment. The bank may have to provide for more if the interest rate continues to rise.

 ?Given the global situation, domestic rates may tighten more. In the face of a rising interest rate since last year, banks? treasury income are drying up,? said UBI chairman-cum-managing director P.K. Gupta on the sidelines of the third banking conclave organised by Ficci here today.

 Bond prices are inversely related to interest rates. A rise in the interest rate increases a bond?s yield and reduces its price. Therefore, banks? investments in government securities and corporate debt papers have significantly declined over the last one year. 

 ?The yield on 10-year government papers has increased to 7.52 per cent as on March 31, 2006 from 6.72 per cent a year ago. And between March this year and till yesterday it went up by another 30 basis points,? said Gupta. 

 However, banks do not have to make any provisioning in their balance sheets for any book-loss (loss in papers only) in investments under the held-to-maturity (HTM) category. And a bank is permitted to hold only 25 per cent of its investments in this category.

 The remaining investments can be held under the available-for-sale (AFS) category. Banks are required to make a provisioning in their profit and loss account for investment depreciation under the AFS category only.

 Till March, UBI had 18 per cent of its investments under the HTM category. The bank had transferred 6 per cent more to this segment from the AFS category. 

 ?After the last transfer to the HTM category, we had little room left there. Therefore, for any increase in interest rates we will have to make a depreciation provisioning,? Gupta said. This may affect the bank?s profitability this fiscal, too. In May, UBI?s AFS portfolio stands at over Rs 3,000 crore.

 A rising interest rate has also affected the bank?s credit growth. The non-food credit offtake in the banking sector has slowed down since the beginning of 2006-07. After the recent rate rise by the Reserve Bank of India, it has slowed down further.

 ?We had targeted a 31.5 per cent credit growth to Rs 21,000 crore in 2006-07. But so far, the growth has been in the range of 27-28 per cent,? Gupta said. ?However, we will continue to focus on increasing the share of low-cost deposits to our total deposits. The ratio as on March 31, 2006 is 46.2 per cent,? he added.

 Meanwhile, the bank has sought the approval of the Bengal government to merge its regional rural banks in the state into a single entity. ?We have already done it in Asom,? Gupta said.

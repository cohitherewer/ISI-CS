 Go-slow sign to Posco

 Naveen Patnaik: Cold feet?

 Bhubaneswar, Oct. 24: Orissa chief minister Naveen Patnaik has advised South Korean steelmaker Posco to go slow with its plans for the 12-million-tonne steel plant in Jagatsinghpur district in view of local resistance.

 A delegation of Posco officials, including vice-president (corporate strategic planning) Ki Hoong Park, independent director Jun Kung Woo and outside director Wook Sun, met the chief minister here last evening with a request to help expedite the land acquisition process.

 Posco needs 4,004 acres to build the steel plant and has so far acquired 1,135 acres of government land. The company is facing stiff resistance from residents of Gadakujang, Nuagaon and Dhinkia gram panchayats spread over 400-odd acres and located almost in the middle of the project area. The villagers have also prevented the company from starting a socio-economic survey by Mumbais Tata Institute of Social Sciences.

 Earlier this month, Narmada Bachao Andolan leader Medha Patkar led a group of protesters to Naveen Niwas here demanding an open debate on the merits of the Posco project. Before that, veteran journalist Kuldip Nayar expressed solidarity with villagers and activists sitting on a hunger strike in Bhubaneswar to protest against the project.

 With the protests gaining momentum, the chief minister reportedly asked the Posco delegation to win the confidence of the displaced people and be patient about the progress of the project. He also advised them to set up an industrial training institute for the local youths.

 Reiterating that the first phase of the mega project would be commissioned by 2010, the Posco officials said the company would take steps accordingly. They requested Patnaik to expedite the land acquisition process and forest land diversion.

 Responding to the request of the Posco team, the chief minister said he would make a recommendation for prospecting licence only after the land acquisition problem was sorted out. The prospecting licence and mining lease application submitted by the company have been pending with the government since last year.

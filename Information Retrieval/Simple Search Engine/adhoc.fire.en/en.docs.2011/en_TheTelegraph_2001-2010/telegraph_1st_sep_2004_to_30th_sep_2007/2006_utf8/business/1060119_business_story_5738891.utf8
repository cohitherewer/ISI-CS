 Calcutta, Jan. 18: Bharti Tele-Ventures Limited is awaiting the spectrum policy to roll out its 3G network in the country.

 AirTel, Bhartis cellular service provider, operates on the global system for mobile communications (GSM) platform. The 3G network will open up unlimited opportunities for mobile users, enabling them to see and hear video clips, and send and receive multimedia content and information much faster than is possible over the present networks.

 This, in turn, will enable a service provider to deliver information and entertainment on the move or on-demand.

 Rolling out the 3G network in the main cities at the current price will entail an investment of $1 billion (Rs 4,400 crore- Rs 4,500 crore), Bharti Enterprises chairman Sunil Bharti Mittal said on the sidelines of the partnership summit organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII).

 The specifics on the spectrum policy regarding pricing, allocation and the type of licence fees are issues awaiting clearance from the Centre, Mittal said. 

 A committee, comprising members from the defence and the communications and broadcasting industry, has been set up to formulate the policy. 

 Mittal said Bharti, with the expertise of its stakeholders like Vodafone and Singtel, has the technical knowhow to carry out the rollout of the 3G network. 

 The company would use the wide band code division multiple access (WCDMA) ?a variation of the original CDMA mode of transmission.

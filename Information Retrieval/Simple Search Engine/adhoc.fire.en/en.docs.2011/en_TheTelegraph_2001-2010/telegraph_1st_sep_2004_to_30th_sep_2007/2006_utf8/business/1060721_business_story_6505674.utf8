 Calcutta, July 20: Just as a man is known by the company he keeps, a country is known by the brand it houses ? Japan is identified with Sony, Korea with Samsung and Finland with Nokia. 

 Kevin Lane Keller, EB Osborn professor of marketing at the Tuck School of Business, Dartmouth College, feels it will be interesting to watch how corporate groups like Tata and Reliance emerge in the next few years as they are likely to play an important role in enhancing the equity of Brand India in the international market.

 ?In contemporary times, very often the image of a country is influenced by a strong brand that achieves global leadership from that nation. This has been the case with Nokia from Finland and Samsung from Korea. India?s services industry is well known across the world and it can only be enforced by the emergence of a global brand from the country,? Keller said.

 Brand India is going through a transition at the moment and the next 10?15 years would be crucial as to how the brand develops in the international arena.

 Indian brands should strive to underline their presence in the global market through strong performances and competitiveness, Keller added.

 India is using its contact points quite efficiently by featuring on the covers of international magazines like Time, Newsweek and also getting noticed at international forums.

 ?Countries are brands just like other products, services and organisations. They have set expectations associated with them, which affect perceptions and behaviour. These have to be leveraged to a country?s advantage,? Keller noted.

 The old P?s of marketing ? product, place, promotion and price ? have been replaced by people, processes, programmes and performance, making marketing an extremely inclusive activity.

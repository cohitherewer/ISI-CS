 Los Angeles, Sept. 9 (Reuters): California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger apologised yesterday for calling a Latina state lawmaker very hot in private remarks obtained by a newspaper although the legislator herself said she wasnt offended.

 Schwarzenegger made the comment about Republican lawmaker Bonnie Garcia during a closed-door meeting with members of his staff last spring. A tape recording of the informal session was obtained by the Los Angeles Times, which printed them on its front page.

 I mean, they are all very hot, the governor said of Cubans and Puerto Ricans, according to the paper. They have the, you know, part of the black blood in them and part of the Latino blood in them and together that makes it.

 According to the Times, the film star-turned politician was referring to the fiery personalities of Cubans and Puerto Ricans in general and of Garcia in particular.

 Anyone out there that feels offended by those comments, I just want to say Im sorry, Schwarzenegger said. I apologise because that was not the intention.

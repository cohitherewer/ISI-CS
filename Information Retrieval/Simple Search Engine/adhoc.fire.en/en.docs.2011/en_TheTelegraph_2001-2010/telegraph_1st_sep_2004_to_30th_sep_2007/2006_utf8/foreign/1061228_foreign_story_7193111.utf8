 Wall Street women still feel the squeeze

 New York, Dec. 27 (Reuters): Even though Wall Street investment banks have made diversity a top priority for the past decade, it may take several more years before women and minorities gain a foothold in the ranks of senior management.

 That forecast comes from industry experts, investment bank diversity chiefs and trends in hiring data.

 Minorities and women continue to be squeezed in Wall Streets promotion pipeline when it comes to attaining senior positions those at the managing director level and above that reaped multimillion-dollar bonuses this year.

 The numbers indicate the squeeze is real, said Subha Barry, head of diversity at Merrill Lynch amp; Co.

 On an upbeat note, Barry said she would be surprised if Merrill Lynchs diversity in the middle to senior management ranks doesnt mirror in five years the composition of the companys board of directors. Its board includes several women and minorities, including chairman Stan Neal, who is black.

 In the past four years, Merrill Lynchs entry-level hires for diversity are 100 per cent better, she said.

 The top and the bottom have to meet. The middle is where the work has to be done, Barry said.

 For nearly a dozen years, Barron Harvey has watched Wall Street put its best foot forward mentoring, recruiting and hiring black students at Howard University in Washington.

 Harvey has a front row seat as the dean of Howard Universitys business school. While theres plenty more to do, he said Wall Street companies have done a good job of increasing awareness among undergraduate and graduate students about careers in investment banking.

 Lets face it, banking is not a career thats promoted in high school or in the community, Harvey said. You get exposure through someone who has reached out to you in high school or during your collegiate career.

 Wall Street companies say they put considerable effort into building diversity within their ranks. Our commitment to diversity is unparalleled, No. 2 investment bank Morgan Stanley says on its website.

 Not to be outdone, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the worlds largest investment bank, says its work force represents 150 nationalities and speaks 84 different languages. At Goldman Sachs, diversity is a business imperative.

 From 1993 to 2004, overall diversity at the management level in the financial services industry changed only slightly, the US government accountability office said in a report this year.

 San Francisco, Nov. 8 (Reuters): California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger won re-election by a landslide after distancing himself from fellow Republican President George W. Bush and taking a moderate stance, results today showed.

 The former Hollywood star beat his Democratic opponent, state treasurer Phil Angelides, by 17 points with 99.6 per cent of yesterdays vote counted. What a fantastic evening; I love doing sequels, Schwarzenegger told supporters in Beverly Hills. But this without any doubt is my favourite sequel.

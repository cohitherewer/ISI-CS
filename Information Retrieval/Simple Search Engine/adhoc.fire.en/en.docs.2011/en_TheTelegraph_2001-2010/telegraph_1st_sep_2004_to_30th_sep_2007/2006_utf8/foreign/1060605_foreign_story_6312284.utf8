 Court bars pet visit

 Madrid, June 4 (Reuters): A Spanish court has ruled that dogs should not be treated like children with allocated visiting rights when it comes to divorce cases.

 A Spanish man was originally given permission by his wife to visit Yako, a golden retriever, when they separated but he appealed to a lower court when she stopped him from seeing the dog. The court ruled in his favour and set up visiting hours.

 But the provincial court of Barcelona then overturned that decision, saying it set a precedent for pets to be treated like children in divorce cases.

 This sort of litigation is rare, given that common sense and reason dictate that people should not take such cases to court, court papers said. 

 Whats in a name?

 Los Angeles (Reuters): If you have ever wondered whats 

in a name, consider: Brooklyn, Moxie Crimefighter, Bluebell Madonna, Suri, Phinneaus, 

Apple and, debuting just last week, Shiloh. All these are names that celebrities 

have bestowed upon their newborns in their quest for the unusual, outlandish or 

off-the-wall. Consider plain Bill boring and banned. Experts say it is only a 

matter of time before the latest trendy new names spread to the general public. 

For example, ordinary people in the Bronx could start naming their children Brooklyn 

? a name British soccer star David Beckham and his ex-Spice Girl wife Victoria 

chose for their son. Although some name experts think the public might embrace 

Brooklyn as a first name, they might not jump at the name another former Spice 

Girl, Geri Halliwell, gave her daughter ? Bluebell Madonna, named after bluebells, 

which she saw everywhere before the birth and the singer whom she adores.

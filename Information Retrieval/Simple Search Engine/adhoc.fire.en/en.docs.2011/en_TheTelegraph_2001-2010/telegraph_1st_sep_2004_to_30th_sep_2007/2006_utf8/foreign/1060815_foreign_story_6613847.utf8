 Islamabad, Aug. 14: A week after putting Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT) founder Hafiz Mohammad Saeed under house arrest at his Lahore residence, Pakistan today vowed to ban the LeTs parent organisation, the Jamatud Daawa (JD), after the UN has officially done so.

 We will freeze assets and seal infrastructure of the JD the moment it is proscribed by the UN, interior minister Aftab Ahmad Khan Sherpao told The Telegraph in Islamabad.

 The Jamat is currently under close watch, Sherpao said, adding that Saeed was put under house arrest as a precaution.

 However, the minister did not disclose what really prompted the authorities to detain Saeed for a period of one month. However, they stressed that the government would take further action once the party was outlawed.

 Saeed, who presently heads the JD, abandoned the LeT a few days before President Pervez Musharraf outlawed it along with five other extremist organisations in January 2002.

 The defunct LeT has been sharply criticised by New Delhi for its alleged terrorist acts in India and its support to Kashmiri militants.

 Formed in 2001, the JD has been actively engaged in relief activities in Pakistani Kashmir after the October 8, 2005, earthquake which killed over 75,000 people and left more than 3.5 million homeless.

 While Pakistans government allowed the JD to take part in relief efforts, the US and Indian governments criticised the decision.

 Sherpao also confessed that Musharraf praised the Jamat for its relief activities in Pakistani Kashmir.

 But this does not mean that we will not take any action if there is evidence of JDs involvement in undesirable activities, he said.

 According to a New York Times report, British and Pakistani investigators are looking into the possibility that the Jamat, whose name means the Association of the Call to Righteousness, passed the earthquake donations raised in British mosques to the plotters who had planned to blow up 10 US bound aircraft, according to a person familiar with the investigation.

 One former Pakistani official close to the intelligence department there, said the charity provided the money for buying plane tickets for a practice run and the attacks themselves. The money is believed to have come directly from the groups network in Britain and was not sent from Pakistan, the former official said.

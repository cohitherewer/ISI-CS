 Nepal panel questions Gyanendra

 J. HEMANTH

 Kathmandu, Oct. 12: King Gyanendra today was questioned by a commission probing his alleged role in the suppression of the pro-democracy movement in April this year.

 The monarch, revered for more than 200 years as an incarnation of Vishnu, formally received a questionnaire today from the Rayamajhi Commission. The panel was set up in April to probe the excesses committed by the royal regime during the anti-monarchy movement. 

 The questionnaire was sent to the Narayanhitti Palace after commission members decided that it would be humiliating for the king to appear in person. 

 The panel has so far questioned 1,000 people, including ministers, army personnel and police officials, for their roles against the movement. 

 The commission decided to question the king after former cabinet members accepted collective responsibility for the suppression of the movement. Since the king was the chairman of the cabinet, the commission decided to record his statement as well, a member of the commission said.

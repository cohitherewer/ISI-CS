The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Moss design

London, Sept. 20 (Reuters): Kate Moss will 

design a collection for Topshop, the British fashion chain announced today, saying 

it aimed to turn clothes created by the supermodel into a global brand.

 The deal, timed to coincide with London Fashion Week, marks the biggest upswing yet in the fortunes of the British model, who a year ago was shunned by the industry after being caught on camera snorting what appeared to be cocaine. It is also a coup for Topshop, giving the British chain, famed for selling catwalk styles at discount prices, a fresh dose of high fashion glamour just as it plans to launch a flagship store in the US next year. Kate has a unique position as a true fashion icon and I look forward to helping develop Kate Moss for Topshop into a global brand, Topshops owner, retail tycoon Philip Green, who is chairman of the Arcadia group, said.

 The announcement confirms speculation sparked by Mosss surprise front row appearance at Topshops catwalk show at the start of this week, where she had paparazzi bulbs flashing as she sat giggling and gossiping with Green.

 Pictures of Moss, who is feted as a style icon by British fashion editors, in Topshop clothes which she buys herself ensure the item sells out in days.

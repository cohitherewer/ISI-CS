 Barbra booed for Bush abuse

 New York, Oct. 13 (Reuters): Some of Barbra Streisands fans have some advice for the diva as she makes a rare US tour shut up and sing.

 Streisand, 64, an ardent Democrat, has used the opportunity of her first US tour in 12 years to snipe at President George W. Bush, employing a Bush impersonator to sing a duet with her while blasting the administrations policies.

 Not all members of her audience, who paid up to $250 for a ticket, have appreciated her politics. During a performance at New Yorks Madison Square Garden this week, one concertgoer yelled out, asking if the concert was a fundraiser. Streisand replied: Shut the f--- up!

 Streisand apologised to the audience of about 20,000 people for losing her temper, but her outburst in her show alienated some fans who have written to newspapers to rebuke her. One fan, Margaret Ferrante, said she was outraged to hear Streisand ridicule an audience member.

 She turned a display of her phenomenal musical talent into a profanity-laden attack on people, Ferrante wrote to the New York Daily News yesterday. I love her voice but could not in good conscience ever pay to see her perform again.

 Talkative egg

 BRIAN MCGINLEY

 London, July 31: It could be an answer to the prayers of people who, quite literally, cannot boil an egg. Or at the very least, a godsend for a new generation of students struggling with the most basic of culinary tasks.

 Revolutionary self-timing eggs designed to overcome the perennial problem of how to avoid runny whites and overcooked yolks will appear on supermarket shelves in the coming months. The eggs are marked with logos in thermochromic invisible ink, which turns dark when it reaches a certain temperature. Inks have been created to appear after three minutes to indicate a soft-boiled egg, after four minutes for medium and after seven minutes for a hard-boiled egg. Shoppers will be able to buy the eggs of their choice in cartons marked soft, medium or hard.

 The project was launched by the quality assurance scheme Lion Quality Eggs in response to thousands of people asking how to boil eggs properly. Gilly Beaumont, of B amp;H Colour Change, which developed the logos, said: We are still perfecting t hetechnology, but we are very excited at the prospect of sorting a problem that has wound people up at breakfast time for decades.

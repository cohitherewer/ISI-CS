 Fried Coke

 New York, Oct. 27 (Reuters): A new fast food is making its debut at US fairs this autumn fried Coke.

 Abel Gonzales, 36, a computer analyst from Dallas, tried about 15 different varieties before coming up with his perfect recipe a batter mix made with Coca-Cola syrup, a drizzle of strawberry syrup and some strawberries.

 Balls of the batter are then deep-fried, ending up like small doughnuts which are then served in a cup, topped with Coca-Cola syrup, whipped cream, cinnamon sugar and a cherry on the top.

 It tastes great, said Sue Gooding, a spokeswoman for the state fair of Texas where Gonzales fried Coke made its debut.

 Cow power

 New York (Reuters): Vermonts 

 Green Mountain College is getting greener with a new programme 

 that uses cow manure to generate power. The Green Mountain 

 College in Poultney aims to cut its greenhouse gas emissions 

 by joining Central Vermont Public Services Cow Power 

 programme, which harvests waste from local farms.The programme 

 capitalises on a byproduct from one of the states 

 top industries, with a typical Vermont dairy cow producing 

 around 13 gallons of manure daily.

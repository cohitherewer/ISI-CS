 Pervez in foreign hand charge

 Musharraf: Adamant

 Islamabad, Jan. 17 (PTI): Refuting allegations of human rights violations in southwest Balochistan by Pakistani security forces, President Pervez Musharraf tonight said the saboteurs are being helped by people from outside Pakistan and they would be dealt with accordingly.

 In an address over state-run radio and television, Musharraf said: Serious concern is that people from outside Pakistan are also helping them. We know who they are and we will deal with them.

 However, Musharraf did not name any country unlike in a recent television interview where he accused India of financing the rebels.

 Pakistan officials had directly accused India after New Delhi expressed concern over the deteriorating human rights situation after Pakistani forces used helicopter gunships and jet fighters to target Baloch nationalist forces.

 In tonights address, Musharraf said allegations that Pakistani security forces violated human rights by killing women and children were not true as no soldier would ever do such a thing. 

 He dismissed as absolutely wrong the impression being created by vested interests that a military operation is underway in parts of Balochistan.

 Only the paramilitary Frontier Corps were deployed and they acted in self-defence against anti-development elements, he said. 

 Please believe me the army is not involved in any operations. It is the constabulary and it is the job of the corps to enforce law and order, he said.

 Musharraf said the action by the paramilitary forces was warranted after rockets were fired at a meeting he was scheduled to address at Kolu town last month followed by a rocket attack on the helicopter in which the inspector general of police was travelling.

 What do you expect us to do. Garland these people and pat them on their back. This is not my training, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Cut-king plan put off

 J. HEMANTH

 Koirala: No rush

 Kathmandu, May 15: The Seven-Party Alliance (SPA) today deferred its plan to clip the wings of King Gyanendra and take Nepal to the threshold of becoming a republic.

 A meeting of the ruling coalition this morning decided to postpone the controversial resolution till the cabinet, which is headed by Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala, is expanded.

 The meeting, which was held at Koiralas official residence, was attended by CPN (UML) general secretary Madhav Kumar Nepal, Nepali Congress (Democratic) president Sher Bahadur Deuba, Peoples Front Nepal (PFN) chief Amik Sherchan and Nepal Workers and Peasants Party chairman Narayan Man Bijukchhe.

 Madhav Kumar Nepal later said that the decision to defer the resolution was taken after Deuba sought more time to discuss the contents of the decree.

 Sources told The Telegraph that Koirala endorsed Deubas views and decided that the resolution could have far-reaching implications.

 Therefore, the leaders decided, that every point in the resolution should be debated thoroughly. 

 The sources said Koirala and Deuba felt that the move to rename His Majestys Government as the Government of Nepal and the Royal Nepalese Army as Nepal National Army was premature.

 PFN leader Lilamani Pokharel said that the meeting failed to set any deadline for making the resolution final. However, the cabinet will be expanded within three days to induct seven representatives of the Nepali Congress, six of the CPN-UML, four of the NCD and one each for the rest of the constituents of the seven-party alliance, he said.

 Yesterday, the SPA had agreed to introduce the landmark resolution in parliament this afternoon. The draft resolution has listed out 10 points, including scrapping the powerful Raj Parishad, putting all royal institutions under the parliament and vesting powers in the House to enact, amend and annul laws.

 Bug fear in coats, ties

 London, Feb. 20 (Reuters): Doctors should stop wearing ties and traditional white coats to work because they might be responsible for spreading deadly hospital superbugs, according to a report today.

 The British Medical Association (BMA) said ties performed no beneficial function in treating patients and, as they were rarely washed, were a potential bug haven.

 Washing hands properly was the most important action medical staff could take to help stop the spread of the so-called superbugs. However other steps, such as doctors abandoning ties and other functionless clothing, could also help minimise the risk.

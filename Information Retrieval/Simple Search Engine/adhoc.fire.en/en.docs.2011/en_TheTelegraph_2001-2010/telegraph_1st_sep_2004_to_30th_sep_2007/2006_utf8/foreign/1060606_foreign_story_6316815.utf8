 Incentive for Iran 

 Tehran, June 5 (Reuters): European Union foreign policy chief Javier Solana arrives in Iran late tonight to deliver an offer of incentives aimed at persuading it to abandon its plans to make nuclear fuel.

 Peru polls 

 Lima (Reuters): Former President Alan Garcia beat a fiery ex-army nationalist in Perus runoff election on Sunday, staging a political comeback after his 1980s government ended in economic ruin, rebel violence and accusations of rights abuses. 

 Iraq sentence 

 Baghdad (Reuters): A Baghdad court sentenced an Iraqi man to life in prison on Monday in connection with the 2004 abduction and killing of an Iraqi-British aid worker. Mustafa Salman was convicted on what appeared to be charges of abetting aid worker Margaret Hassans murder, an official said. 

 Somalia

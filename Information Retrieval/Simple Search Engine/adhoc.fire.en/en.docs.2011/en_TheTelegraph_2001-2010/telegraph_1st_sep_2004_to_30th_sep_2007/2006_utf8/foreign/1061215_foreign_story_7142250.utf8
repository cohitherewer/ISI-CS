 Serial killer leaves clues

 CAROLINE DAVIES AND DAVID SAPSTED

 London, 

 Dec. 14: A potential signature for 

 the Ipswich serial killer became apparent last night when 

 it emerged that all five bodies had been left naked except 

 for their jewellery.

 Detectives hunting the killer of the young prostitutes, who are believed to have been strangled or smothered, are trying to establish the significance of this finding and will study unsolved murders elsewhere in Britain for similarities.

 Police sources confirmed that jewellery had been left untouched on the bodies of Tania Nicol, Gemma Adams and Anneli Alderton, and two unidentified women who are believed to be Paula Clennell and Annette Nicolls.

 The jewellery includes rings and necklaces. But it will not be known until the killer is caught whether the items were left because he hurried, or could not remove them, or that he was interested only in removing clothing. Detectives and psychologists are also trying to decode clues about the way some of the bodies were left apparently laid out, possibly with voyeuristic overtones. Some investigators suspect that the main impulse of the man, who has a car, was to dump the victims within yards of a road and speed away.

 Officers suggested that it was too early to establish similarities with a number of murders of women in East Anglia in the early 1990s and said nothing from the study had leapt out to help the Suffolk detectives. Officers were also said last night to be examining a handbag found in Ipswich containing a pair of underwear, a toothbrush and toothpaste. 

 Police said the significance of those finds could not be assessed until scientific analysis was complete.

 Ban cloud on Korea

 United Nations, Oct. 14 (Reuters): The UN Security Council expects to impose arms and financial sanctions on North Korea for its reported nuclear weapons test, with US intelligence pointing to confirmation that it took place.

 Russia and China submitted new amendments to a US-drafted UN resolution, which are expected to delay the vote by several hours, but US ambassador John Bolton said he was confident the resolution would be adopted today.

 In Washington, a preliminary US intelligence analysis has shown radioactivity in air samples collected near a suspected North Korean nuclear test site, a US official said yesterday, five days after Pyongyang announced it conducted the test.

 Thats right, though this is only a first look. People have been saying all along that the working assumption is it was a nuke, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

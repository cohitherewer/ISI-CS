 Jessica faces $100-m suit

 Simpson: Brand bother

 Tarrant Apparel Group of Los Angeles accuses Simpson of breaching the multimillion-dollar deal by failing to wear or be photographed in the clothes and has even named another brand of blue jeans as her favourites. Simpsons lawyer denied the charges.

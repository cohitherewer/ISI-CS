 Close secret prisons, UN panel tells US

 Geneva, May 19 (Reuters): The UN committee against torture told the US today it should close any secret prisons abroad and the Guantanamo Bay facility in Cuba, saying they violated international law.

 The 10 independent experts, who examined the US record at home and abroad, urged President George W. Bushs administration to rescind any interrogation technique that constituted torture or cruel treatment of foreign terrorism detainees.

 It cited use of dogs to terrify detainees, water-boarding which is a form of mock drowning, and sexual humiliation.

 The US should ensure that no one is detained in any secret detention facility under its de facto effective control and investigate and disclose the existence of any such facilities, said the committee, which has moral authority but no legal power to enforce its recommendations.

 Detaining persons in such conditions constitutes, per se, a violation of the convention, said the committee which examines compliance with the 1987 UN Convention against Torture, or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.

 The US is holding hundreds of terrorism suspects, most arrested since al Qaidas September 11 attacks in 2001, at its prisons in Afghanistan, Iraq and Guantanamo Bay. 

 Washington, which sent 30 senior officials to Geneva in early May for the committees two-day hearings, defended its treatment of foreign terrorism suspects held abroad, saying there had been relatively few actual cases of abuse.

 Suicide clash

 Prisoners wielding improvised weapons clashed with guards trying to stop a detainee from committing suicide at the Guantanamo Bay prison, the military said.

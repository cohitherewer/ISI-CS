 Halle keen to adopt child

 Berry: Natural woman

 New York, May 2 (AP): Halle Berry says she wants to adopt a child ? someday. 

 I will adopt if it doesnt happen for me naturally, the 39-year-old actress said in a recent interview with TV newsmagazine Extra. I will definitely adopt. And I probably will adopt even if it does happen naturally.

 However, Berry has no immediate plans to join the ranks of celebrity moms like Angelina Jolie, who is pregnant, and Gwyneth Paltrow and Katie Holmes, who recently gave birth. There are too many babies being born, Berry joked. No, no, nows not the time.

 Berry is reportedly dating 30-year-old model Gabriel Aubry. She has been married and divorced twice.

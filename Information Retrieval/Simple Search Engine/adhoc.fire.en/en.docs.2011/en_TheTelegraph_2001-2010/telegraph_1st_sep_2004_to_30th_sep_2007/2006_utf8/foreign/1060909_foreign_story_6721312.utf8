 Baluchistan blast kills 6

 Quetta, Sept. 8 (Reuters): A bomb exploded next to a clinic in Pakistans gas-rich Baluchistan province today, killing six people and wounding several, police said.

 Police said they suspected insurgents fighting for greater autonomy and a bigger share of profits from Baluchistans gas resources were responsible for the blast in the town of Rakhni.

 Women released

 Lahore, July 10 (AP): Eight women were released from a jail in Pakistan today, days after President Pervez Musharraf amended a harsh Islamic law giving them the right to be freed on bail, officials said.

 Musharraf signed an amendment on Friday to the controversial Hudood ordinance, allowing women awaiting trial on charges of adultery and other minor crimes to get bail. 

 The eight women, aged between 20 and 30, were released from Kot Lakhpat jail in Lahore, capital of the eastern Punjab province, said Sarfaraz Mufti, chief of prisons in Punjab. More releases were expected soon.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 US options open

 Washington, March 7 (Reuters): The US will not allow Iran to have nuclear weapons and Tehran faces meaningful consequences if it persists in defying the international community, vice-president Dick Cheney said today.

 Cheney also re-affirmed that the US was keeping all options on the table in its determination to prevent Iran from developing nuclear arms. The Iranian regime needs to know that if it stays on its present course the international community is prepared to impose meaningful consequences, Cheney said. Senior US officials have repeatedly refused to rule out the use of force, saying all options are on the table. For the past year, the administration has focused on supporting diplomatic efforts, but US rhetoric has become more muscular as diplomacy failed to resolve the issue.

 Buddy in a box

 London, July 25 (Reuters): He fits in a cars glove box, appears at a flick of a switch and when a woman has finished using him, she can just pull the plug and he deflates.

 Hes the Buddy on Demand, a blow-up man launched today with the aim of making solo female motorists feel less nervous about driving at night.

 According to research by the inflatable friends creator, insurer Sheilas Wheels, 82 per cent of women feel safer with someone sitting in the car beside them and nearly a half dont like driving alone in the dark.

 Were not saying that an inflatable man is the only answer but we do hope it will give women extra confidence and make journeys in the dark less fearful, said a spokeswoman for Sheilas Wheels.

 Delivery was terrifying: Jolie

 Jolie: First breath

 New York, June 17 (AP): Angelina Jolie, in her first US interview since the birth of her daughter last month, says the experience was frightening.

 You know, because youre there for the birth, which I wasnt for my first two kids, youre just suddenly terrified that theyre not gonna take a first breath, the 31-year-old actress says in an interview on CNNs Anderson Cooper 360.

 That was my whole focus. I just wanted to hear her cry. Jolie gave birth to Shiloh Nouvel Jolie-Pitt on May 27 at a private clinic in the resort town of Walvis Bay in Namibia. The baby, healthy and weighing 3.2 kg, was delivered by Caesarean section.

 In excerpts of the interview, Jolie says Brad Pitt was in the operating room for the delivery. He was in the operating room, yeah, yeah, she tells Cooper. And we had amazing doctors. And everybody was so lovely.

 Jolie and Pitt, 42, have since left Namibia with their newborn daughter and two older children: 16-month-old Zahara, adopted from Ethiopia, and 4-year-old Maddox, adopted from Cambodia. 

 Both Maddox and Zaharas surnames have been legally changed to Jolie-Pitt.

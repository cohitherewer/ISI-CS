 Potter tears

 London, June 26 (Reuters): Author J.K. Rowling confessed yesterday that she was feeling sad that her days penning the Harry Potter books were almost over.

 But, as ever, she steadfastly refused to reveal any plot twists in the tale of the teenage wizard when she went to a garden party for 2,000 children at Buckingham Palace.

 Rowling, now writing the seventh and final book in the saga that has already sold over 300 million copies, said: I am feeling sad as it is the last one. But so far, so good.

 Pressed on when the book would be ready for publication, she would only say: Im doing well I think. You can never really tell till you get near the end. I am not quite there yet.

 Timor text

 Dili, East Timor (Reuters): When East Timors Nobel 

Peace Prize laureate Jose Ramos-Horta resigned his government posts, he did so 

via a mobile phone text message. Ramos-Horta said that he had sent an SMS to Prime 

Minister Mari Alkatiri announcing his intention to quit on Sunday, and received 

a reply in the same format from the premier. I explained myself in a subsequent 

text message, he said.

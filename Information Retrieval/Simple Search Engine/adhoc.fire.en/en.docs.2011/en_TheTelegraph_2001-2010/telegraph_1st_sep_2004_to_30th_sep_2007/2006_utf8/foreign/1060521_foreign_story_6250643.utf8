 Suu Kyi meets UN official

 Yangon, May 20 (Reuters): Senior UN official Ibrahim Gambari met detained Myanmar Opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi in a Yangon guest house today, her first contact with an outsider in three years, a government source said.

 The meeting followed an audience between Gambari and Than Shwe, the ruling military juntas supremo, in his new jungle capital. It lasted for about an hour, according to the source, who asked not to be identified. There were no further details. Suu Kyi, 60, has been under house arrest for the last three years.

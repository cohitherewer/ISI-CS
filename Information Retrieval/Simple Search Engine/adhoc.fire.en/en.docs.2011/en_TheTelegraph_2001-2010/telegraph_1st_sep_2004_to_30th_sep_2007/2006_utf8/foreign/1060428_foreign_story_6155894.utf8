 Iraq leader sister killed

 Baghdad, April 27 (Reuters): Gunmen killed the sister of Iraqi vice-president Tareq al-Hashemi in Baghdad today, interior ministry sources and two officials in his party said.

 They said Meysoun al-Hashemi was gunned down in the Hay al-Ilaam section of Baghdad. The killing comes after one of his brothers was killed on April 13. Hashemi, a Sunni Arab, was appointed on Saturday in efforts to form a unity government.

 The brother of another leading Sunni politician, Saleh al-Mutlak, was found dead this month after he was kidnapped.

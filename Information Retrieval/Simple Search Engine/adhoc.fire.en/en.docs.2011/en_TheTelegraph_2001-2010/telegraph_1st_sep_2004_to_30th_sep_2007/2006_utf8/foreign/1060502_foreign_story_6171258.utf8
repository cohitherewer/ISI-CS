 Dubai plans to build worlds largest hotel

 Dubai, May 1 (Reuters): Dubai is planning to build the worlds largest hotel as part of a $27 billion resort project unveiled today to spearhead the Gulf emirates drive to become a global tourism hub.

 Promotional video of the Bawadi project showed a 10 km long resort strip that resembled Las Vegas without the casinos ? its 31 hotels modelled on ancient Egyptian palaces, Hollywood, Londons Houses of Parliament and even the moon.

 Dubais fantastic, even bizarre developments, including a ski slope in the desert and man-made islands shaped like palm fronds, helped draw some 6 million tourists last year to a tiny desert land that is fast running out of oil.

 Dubai hopes to make that 15 million tourists a year over the next decade even as its richer neighbours plough record oil revenues into new mega-projects to try to emulate Dubais success.

 The launch of this project effectively signals the next major phase in tourism development in Dubai as we look forward to the next eight years of major growth, said Saeed al-Muntafiq, chief executive of Tatweer, the Dubai government-owned project developer.

 Muntafiq said at the launch ceremony that Dubai, one of seven members of the oil-exporting United Arab Emirates, would need to build 70,000-80,000 new hotel rooms over the next decade to meet its expansion plans.

 Bawadi will have more than 29,000 hotel rooms, nearly double the number now available in Dubai, and will be able to host more than 3 million tourists by 2016.

 The centrepiece of the resort will be the 6,500-room Asia Asia Hotel which Tatweer says will be the largest in the world. 

 The first phase of the project, which includes the Asia Asia hotel, will be operational by 2010. Tatweer will invest 40 billion dirhams ($10.9 billion) in the project, building the Asia Asia and Bawadis infrastructure, Muntafiq said. The rest of the money will come from investors.

 Toddler on jury

 New Bedford (Massachusetts), Jan. 17 (AP): Kaylee Reynolds had a problem when she recently received a summons to serve on a jury. She wasnt old enough to read it.

 The two-year-old has quite a few years to go before she reaches the minimum age of 18 to serve on a state jury. Lucky for Kaylee, Massachusetts jury commissioner Patricia Reynolds seemed willing to let it slide for a while. Well give her a 16-year grace period, Wood told the Standard Times of New Bedford.

 Besides her questionable understanding of the concepts of guilt or innocence, there are other reasons why its best to wait for Kaylee to serve. Her mother, Patricia, says Kaylee gets really cranky if she doesnt get her noontime nap.

 Car return

 Los Angeles (Reuters): A Corvette sports 

 car stolen when it was brand new in New York 37 years ago 

 has been recovered in California and will be returned to 

 its rightful owner, authorities said on Monday. The 1968 

 car, which vanished from Alan Posters garage in the 

 borough of Queens on January 22, 1969, was identified as 

 stolen as it was being loaded on a container ship for Sweden 

 last November. The car had recently been purchased for $10,000 

 by a man in Sweden who was unaware it had been stolen nearly 

 four decades earlier.

 Clue trail

 Berlin (Reuters): A bungling German thief left a Hansel and Gretel-style trail of feathers which led police from the crime scene to his front door, authorities said on Tuesday. Police in the western city of Bochum said the man ripped open his quilted jacket as he broke into a shop to steal a karaoke set and did not notice it was leaking feathers all the way home. A witness saw the break-in and quickly told police.

 Lanka feelers to India

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 21: Sri Lankan foreign minister Mangala Samaraweera arrived here tonight on his second visit in a month to brief the government about the rapidly deteriorating situation in the island nation.

 Samaraweera will meet Prime Minister Manmohan Singh tomorrow and also hold talks with national security adviser M.K. Narayanan.

 Narayanan will later fly to Chennai to brief Tamil Nadu chief minister M. Karunanidhi, who is concerned over the situation in Sri Lanka. 

 The state is facing an influx of Sri Lankan refugees who fear a war with the LTTE could break out any moment. Karunanidhi and Tamil Nadus political leaders want India to play a pro-active role in ending the crisis.

 India, which has preferred to be in the background and backed Norways efforts to bring peace to the island, is concerned as Norwegian facilitators have expressed frustration in bringing the two sides back to the negotiating table. 

 In a last-ditch effort to salvage the peace process, Norway has asked Sri Lankan and LTTE representatives to reach Oslo.

 Indian officials said Samaraweeras visit should be seen as part of the continuing high-level political dialogue between Delhi and Colombo.

 India wants to avoid a situation where the Norwegians are forced to leave the peace process mid-way as they provide the only channel of communication with the LTTE.

 In the past, Delhi has used this link to pass on messages of restraint to the Tamil Tigers.

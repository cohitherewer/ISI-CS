 Monarchy role angers Maoists

 Kathmandu, Aug. 7: Nepals fragile peace process suffered a serious setback today with two senior Maoist leaders criticising Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala for advocating a role for King Gyanendra and the monarchy in the new political set-up.

 Reacting to Koiralas call for giving space to the king in politics, Maoist deputy chief Baburam Bhattarai said the Prime Minister and his government were putting obstacles before the peace process. 

 He said that Koiralas statement was in violation of the agreements reached between the Maoists and the Seven-Party Alliance (SPA). 

 The Prime Ministers comment is highly objectionable. The Prime Minister and his government are hampering the peace process, Bhattarai told the general meeting of the Federation of Nepalese Chamber of Commerce and Industry (FNCCI) here today.

 In an address to the FNCCI gathering yesterday, Koirala said all sections, including King Gyanendra, should be given space in Nepali politics to ensure there was no residual desperation and frustration.

 Much to the discomfort of the rebels, who have been fighting for the abolition of the monarchy and the creation of a republic, Koirala has been strongly advocating a ceremonial role for Gyanendra in the new political set-up.

 The Prime Minister also said that a give and take policy will be the underlying principle in the peace process. If we do not give any space to the Maoists, they will be desperate. Similarly, if we do not give any space to the king, he will be frustrated. This explains why we have decided to do what we are about to do, he added.

 During his two-hour long address to the FNCCI, Bhattarai also sought to calm fears that the Maoists were against the industrial sector. 

 Our policy is not to extort money from the businessmen, Bhattarai said, adding that the disputes between the workers and owners should be sorted out through discussions.

 In a separate development, Dinanath Sharma, a senior member of the Maoist team, hinted that the SPA was beginning to show signs of dumping the Maoists after using them to suit its narrow political ends.

 Addressing a seminar organised by the Indigenous Nationalities Peace Commission here today, Sharma said that nearly 1,000 Maoists lost their lives while being used to serve the SPAs interests in the aftermath of the 12-point agreement between the two sides.

 He said the attack on the Thankot police post in Kathmandu was staged at the SPAs request.

 Book praise surprises Amis

 Amis: Amazed

 London, Oct. 3 (Reuters): 

 Martin Amis has had his fair share of terrible reviews in 

 recent years, so he is as surprised as anyone to be basking 

 in critics praise for his latest novel House of 

 Meetings, set in the gulags of Stalinist Russia.

 The British author of works including The Rachel Papers, Money and London Fields has said he gave up reading reviews long ago. But, as with many other writers and actors, he is happy to allow good ones to slip through the net.

 I do the Julian Barnes method, which is get your wife to read them and then pass on the good ones, Amis said, referring to his fellow British novelist.

 I think Ive read all of them. Yes, its been a long time since Ive had nice reviews, since The Information really. Its nostalgic as well as gratifying.

 Critical attacks on his work reached a climax in 2003 with Yellow Dog, but House of Meetings has been described as his best novel since London Fields in 1989.

 Amis has produced a memorable novel and a memorable protagonist, wrote the Observer newspaper at the weekend.

 House of Meetings tells the story of two brothers sent to a slave camp in the barren wastelands of northern Russia in the 1940s, where they barely survive among humans who behave more like savage animals.

 It is interwoven with details of the 2004 Beslan school siege in which 333 hostages died, and statistical reminders of how brutal life in Russia remains today.

 Over here, now, theres no angling around for your male midlife crisis, the narrator writes. It is brought to you and it is always the same thing. It is death.

 It is Amiss way of suggesting that Russia is a mess today as it was under communism, and that history and geography have not been kind to the country. He also believes there is an air of fatalism about Russians that affects how they act.

 In a country where people have never had a say determining their own state, this breeds an incredible subliminal area of total irresponsibility, because what youve done has never mattered, its never affected your fate, Amis said.

 House of Meetings comes just four years after Amiss Koba the Dread, a non-fiction work about western intellectuals approval of communism. He puts his fascination with the country down to its literature, which he read as a young boy.

 Oprah grouse

 New York, July 18 (AP): Oprah Winfrey and her friend Gayle King want to be clear: they are not gay.

 In the August issue of , the Oprah Magazine, 

the talk-show host explains that some people misunderstand her close friendship 

with King. I understand why people think were gay, she says. 

There isnt a definition in our culture for this kind of bond between 

women. So I get why people have to label it ? how can you be this close without 

it being sexual? 

 In a long article, Winfrey, 52, 

 and King converse about their 30 years of friendship and 

 four-times-a-day phone calls. 

 King, who hosted The Gayle King Show in 1997, is an editor of , the Oprah Magazine.
